<P><STRONG>    The young-viewers&#146; chat-show Ask Aspel, hosted by longtime
British TV      veteran Michael Aspel, featured Kate on September 5, 1978.  The
appearance was      preceded by a repeat airing of part of Kate&#146;s second
lip-synch of this song for the     U.K. TV programme Top of the Pops, summer
'78.   Kate is dressed in a     white gown similar to that worn for the &quot;official&quot;
video of the song.     Some multiple-image video effects are also very similar. 
Her backing was      from a large studio ensemble, with whom Kate had had
minimal opportunity to      rehearse. Nevertheless, the result is very
professional, far more assured than      her first Top of the Pops performance. 
Kate then appears live, both for an      interview and telephone call-in segment
, and to perform the song      &quot;Kashka From Baghdad&quot; solo with her own
piano-accompaniment.       Although this was a chidren's programme, its host was
more polite and      asked more intelligent questions than most of Kate's
interviewers had      done up until that time.      Kate appears extraordinarily
poised in the interview segments, and her      solo performance of Kashka is
completely assured. All in all, a very      satisfying early clip.    </STRONG>
