<P><STRONG>    This, the only performance Kate has ever given of her music for
    American television, is still a vivid memory in many U.S. fans' minds.    
After a very sincere introduction by Eric Idle, Kate appeared in a    
shimmering gold body-stocking and perfectly crimped and plaited hair,    
sitting cross-legged atop a grand piano. The accompanist was Paul     Shaffer
(now a nationally famous musician in his role as leader of a     late-night
talk-show's rock band), and additional off-screen backing     was heard as well.
This performance is also the only unexpurgated     version on film, so far as I
know. Kate's choreography is brilliant     throughout, and adds considerable
nuance to the lyrics' meaning. Later     in the programme she re-appeared to
perform Them Heavy People. For this     song she was dressed in a heavy
trench-coat and wore a large Borsalino     hat--much as in the version performed
for the Tour of Life, but without     her accompanying dancers. The backing
sounded live, and included female     and male backing vocals. Her performance
of both songs was absolutely     flawless, and her enigmatic expression at the
conclusion of each--like     the whole presentation--was quite unprecedented on
American     television. Finally, Kate appeared on-stage during the end-credits,
    along with all the other guests and cast-members.    </STRONG>   </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE>
