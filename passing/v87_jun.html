<P><STRONG>    The Story So Far: a forty-five-minute documentary on Kate's    
career to date, compiling videos as well as excerpts from earlier     interviews
with Kate by Daniel Richler (see number 28) and Christopher     Ward (see number
35); and adding a follow-up interview with Kate     conducted in 1987 by Laurie
Brown at Kate's home in England.<BR>             Aired on Canadian TV, summer
1987. (The Laurie Brown interview     was also broadcast by itself as a
half-hour programme on Canadian TV.)<BR>          This interview is one of the
best of all video-taped interviews to     date. All of Laurie Brown's questions
are carefully researched,     considered and worded, and Kate's answers,
consequently, are frank and     very enlightening. The interview was conducted
at Kate's own home in     England, and there are one or two shots of the back
garden and the     interior of one room. Kate is clearly in the midst of
recording:     although the lighting is not flattering, she does appear heavier
than     she had during the 1985 promotional tour--no doubt a quite temporary   
 condition brought about by the long and sedentary work-schedule. By the    
time of this writing Kate is probably as lean and fit as ever--in    
preparation for the Tour of Life II (!).    </STRONG>   </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><STRONG>    Good Rockin' Tonight, Much Music, The New Music, Toronto
Evening News<BR>      Excerpts from interviews (all dating from the same    
day, in the same Toronto studios) conducted by Christopher Ward, Nan     Devitt
and Daniel Richler in late November, 1985.<BR>     These interviews have a
strikingly better atmosphere than their     U.S. counterparts, which had been
conducted only a day or two before.     Much of the credit for this must go to
the excellent interviewing     techniques of the Canadian hosts, particularly
Mr. Ward and Mr.     Richler. Both men had prepared well for their interviews
and both show     evident respect for their guest on camera. Kate responds,
consequently,     with greater frankness and fluidity than she had in any other 
   interviews of the 1985 promotional campaign.    </STRONG>   </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE>
