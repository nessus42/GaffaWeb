<P><STRONG>    This is much more a promo video than the film excerpt that the
earlier video  was. Kate is wearing sunglasses about half the time, she's
dancing a lot, alone and  together with her male partner, no band can be seen,
quite a lot of solarizing effects  are used, many more locations are filmed than
in the first video, several film  excerpts from The Line, The Cross And The
Curve are shown, together with the  vocal parts of these pieces.     </STRONG>

<P><STRONG>    The new Kate video was played at 12:00 AM CST, so those on the
west coast can  catch it in an hour or so. A warning...Kate was obviously told
by record weasels to  make a video for the &quot;American market&quot; and she
is obviously poking fun at that.  The new &quot;American&quot; bits have Kate
wearing *sunglasses* (we only have one photo  and one bit of video of Kate in
sunglasses, and both times she was outdoors) and  carrying and prop microphone
and stand around in perfect &quot;rock star&quot; form.    </STRONG>   </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>

<P><STRONG>    I like to make my own initial observations about art, if it's
not very difficult to do  so, before reading someone elses. Having said that,
here are some of my own  observations and/or ponderings:  
</STRONG></P>
<P>In making the RbG US video she is being a rubberband girl and not resisting
the  &quot;wind&quot;. The existence of the video fits the song. </P>
<P>The video is rather MTVish; she met the request/challenge to make it and 
directed it *herself*. How many artists can say that about any of their videos?
It's  cool to see that she can kick some ass (IMHO) even if she's not totally on
her turf;  that's a greater test of ones strength. It sounded like she enjoyed
making it and  made it pretty fast (is that right?) so I can imagine her
thinking, &quot;So you want an  American video, huh? *chuckle* *poof* with a
twist.... now on to something really  challenging...&quot;. If she didn't enjoy
it at all then I wish she hadn't made it though. I  enjoyed watching it, which
doesn't necessarily mean I want all of her videos to be  like this one. </P>
<P>From a different view, clips from the movie are shown, with phrases like &quot;You
 are under the spell of the red shoes,&quot; and then immediately &quot;It's
really happened to  ya.&quot; Is this video an example of the spell? Or is it a
break from the spell? This video  is different for her. </P>
<P>Right after singing &quot;Here I go...&quot; she is dancing in a straight
jacket with the  rubberband man *but* the jacket is untied and the long sleeves
are flapping about  while she makes the rubberband noises. Is she being freed by
not resisting the  &quot;wind&quot; or is she showing the restrictions in making
this video. Perhaps it's both:  having as much freedom as she can, given a
limitation. No one ever has total  freedom. Maybe it means nothing. Art also
depends on the eye of the beholder and  I've eyed enough; my eyes are tired.
</P>
<P>Is she sort of making a female sign at the end?? </P></BLOCKQUOTE>  </TD></TR></TABLE>
