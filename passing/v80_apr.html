<P><STRONG>    Lip-synch/video, taped March 20, 1980, for the U.K.     TV
programme The Dr. Hook Special. Also includes interview.      This video was
made shortly before the programme aired. It involved     some rather complicated
video effects. Kate is featured in a rather     bizarre costume: on her the
right side she resembles a staid Victorian     lady in mourning dress; on the
left side a glittering, liberated young     woman in a silvery jumpsuit, with
bright lightning-streaks painted down     her &quot;side&quot; of Kate's face.
Her figure is lit so that only the     &quot;repressed&quot; side of her costume
is visible during the verses of the     song, and mainly the &quot;free&quot;
side during the choruses.     After the performance ends, Kate is seen sitting
among the members     of the American pop group Dr. Hook, whose ill-spoken
members crack     childish, bathroom-humor asides about and to Kate. Kate, of
course,     takes everything with good grace, smiling nervously throughout.    
Finally, after a stunningly ignorant and illiterate introduction by a     member
of Dr. Hook, Kate's video (never commercially released) for     Delius is shown.

<P><STRONG>    (Also shown November 25, 1980 as part of a       programme
about the composer Frederick Delius from the U.K. TV series     The Russell
Harty Show) This     video, which was never included among Kate's commercial
video packages,     was made very quickly but after careful preparation (see
Paddy Bush's     reminiscences about the shoot in an issue of the Newsletter).
The     setting is a quiet, lazy English riverbank filled with reeds and grass. 
   By the bank is a wheelchair-ridden old man, his body covered by a    
throw-rug, his head obscured by a large yellow disk resembling a sun.     This
figure presents an image of Delius much like the one which was     depicted in a
BBC television film about Delius's late years which was     directed by Ken
Russell in the early 1970s and which had greatly     impressed Kate as a child.
Gliding along on the river is a young     swan-girl, represented by Kate in a
gossamer white gown with wings. The     imagery for this performance might
nearly as well have served to     illustrate Kate's cover version of Donovan's
Lord of the Reedy River,     as well, so compatible is the imagery. (No video
was ever made for the     Donovan song.) Also note the re-use of the sun-mask in
a scene from the     Breathing video.    </STRONG>   </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE>

1980.     This is the brief interview during which segments from the

had been &quot;banned&quot; by the British music-video programmes.    </STRONG>
