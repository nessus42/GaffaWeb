      <P>Love-Hounds is the mailing list version of
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</A> for those people who
        do not have usenet access. This means that anyone with the ability to
        send and receive mail can take part. |&gt;oug /\lan, founder of
        Love-Hounds, did only later provoke the people on
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.misc">rec.music.misc</A> to let him create
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</A>. Together, the
        mailing list and r.m.g. form an informal fan club called &quot;Love-Hounds.&quot;
      </P>
      <P> To post something to both, the
        <A HREF="love-hounds-request@gaffa.org">mailing list</A> and the
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">newsgroup</A>, you best send an email to
      </P>
      <P> love-hounds@gaffa.org </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P> If you think you want to be on the safe side you might want to
        subscribe to the <A HREF="love-hounds-request@gaffa.org">mailing list</A>
        as well as to the <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">newsgroup</A>, because
        minor problems with the software might cause some messages lost on one
        of the sides. (This hasn't happened for a long while now.) </P>
      <P>Love-Hounds comes in two flavors:
        <A HREF="mailto:love-hounds-digest-request@gaffa.org" TARGET="">digest</A>
        and <A HREF="mailto:love-hounds-request@gaffa.org" TARGET="">bounce</A>.
        If you subscribe to the digest version, you will receive a digest once a
        day containing all messages sent to the list since the last digest. If
        you subscribe to the bounce version you will receive each individual
        message as it is sent. You can subscribe or unsubscribe to either
        version of the list at will. </P>
      
      <P>To subscribe to the digest send mail to
        <A HREF="mailto:love-hounds-digest-request@gaffa.org">love-hounds-digest-request@gaffa.org</A>.</P>To
      subscribe to the bounce version send mail to
      <A HREF="mailto:love-hounds-digest-request@gaffa.org">love-hounds-request@gaffa.org</A>.
      
      <P>In the subject line include the single word &quot;subscribe&quot;, &quot;unsubscribe&quot;
        or &quot;help&quot;. Leave the body of the message blank.</P>
      
      <P>To send a message to the list, address it to love-hounds@gaffa.org.</P>
      
      <P>If you have access to <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/News/Usenet/">USENET</A>,
        you may prefer to read the newsgroup <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</A>
        rather than the mailing list. The contents of both the newsgroup and
        mailing list are identical. </P>
      
      <P>On AOL, you can reach rec.music.gaffa by typing keyword &quot;USENET&quot;
        or &quot;Newsgroups&quot; to reach the Internet Newsgroups section. From
        there, you can subscribe to rec.music.gaffa either by:</P>
      
      <P> A: Selecting &quot;Add Newsgroups&quot; and following the hierarchy
        downward from the choices you're given (i.e., &quot;rec.&quot; then &quot;rec.music&quot;
        then &quot;rec.music.gaffa&quot;) and subscribing once you've selected
        the group name </P>
      
      <P> B: Choosing &quot;Expert Add&quot; and typing in &quot;rec.music.gaffa&quot;
        at the prompt. Once you've subscribed, choosing &quot;Read My Newsgroups&quot;
        from the Internet Newsgroups screen will present a list of all the
        newsgroups you're subscribed to, including rec.music.gaffa. </P>
