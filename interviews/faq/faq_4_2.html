      <P> Normally Katefans are nice people. Hey! We
        all share at least one similar taste in music! Nevertheless r.m.g shares
        something with every other usenet newsgroup - that is, there are
        flamewars.
        Even the nasty kind. No one likes them, so the best <A HREF="jgun.jpg">way
          to deal</A> with rude and/or uninteresting posts is to ignore them and
        post something positive and interesting. </P>
      
      <P> >Newbies are explicitly invited to take part in the conversation. Be it that you
        want to know something not in this FAQ, be it that you think you have a
        piece of information to share, be it that you think you know some
        other music you think should be known by more people. (Though I'd say
        you should at least like Kate :-) ...) </P>
      
      <P> Abbreviations commonly used on Love-Hounds include common Usenet
        conventions such as IMHO (In My Humble Opinion), ROFL (Rolling on the
        floor laughing), as well as sideways faces, known as &quot;smilies&quot;
        such as :-). Also used here are the initials of Kate's songs, such as
        RUTH for <A HREF="../sensual/l_ruth.html">Running Up That Hill</A>
        (sometimes known as DwG for Deal with God ;^). </P>
      
      <P> A new one commonly seen is /+) or |X( or any combination, such as
        |+). This is, of course, Kate's film <A HREF="../moments/3_3.html">&quot;The
          Line, the Cross, and The Curve&quot;</A> (Sometimes abbreviated to the
        less cryptic-looking TLTCTC). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
