      <P> Kate's only Tour (the &quot;Tour of Life&quot;) happened in 1979, and
        fans old enough to experience this first hand are the lucky ones. Kate
        never said she won't ever tour again, but don't expect anything. </P>
      
      <P> There's a video tape (&quot;Live at
          Hammersmith Odeon&quot;) and a 4 track EP from the tour. The video
        unfortunately only contains half of the show. The recordings of the rest
        had some technical problems and the result wasn't up to par with Kate's
        standards. The video (now available in PAL and NTSC) is also available
        in a video+CD double pack, so Kate finally
        has an official live album. The only other source are vinyl bootlegs
        which all are of a very bad sound quality, since they were done from the
        audience with late 70's equipment. There are plenty of CD pirates from
        the video tape. Since there is now an official CD of this, please
        consider buying it, especially if you do own one of the bootleg copies.
