      <P> This area is divided into the different albums as well as a section
        for the home demo recordings and for miscellaneous tracks. </P>
      
      <P> The lyrics for all of the songs can be found on both gaffa relevant
        ftp sites: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net">ftp.uu.net</A> and
        <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uwp.edu">ftp.uwp.edu</A>. They are too long to be
        cited here. The file </P>

      <P> contains all lyrics up to The Sensual World and its singles,
        including all non-official songs and all non-official parts of the
        lyrics (backing vocals, spoken passages etc.) </P>
      
      <P>Lyrics can also be found on the web at various sites, including: </P>
      
      <P><A HREF="../sensual/index.html">http://www.gaffa.org/sensual/</A>
      </P>
      
      <P> Right now there are areas where I haven't found the time to say
        something. Feel free to contribute! </P>
      
      <P> More information about most of the songs can be found in the
        archives, so sometimes I will only give a pointer to a long story if it
        is too long to be cited here in full. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P> Kate has never commented on any bootleg material, and so she hasn't
        said anything about these as bootlegs. But she has said plenty of things
        about these recordings - generally to the effect that there are about
        200 or more of them (20-30 have been 'released' on bootlegs) and that
        they should remain buried and will never re-record any of them. The
        sound quality of all of them reminds of a boombox set to 'record' in a
        living room. Nevertheless most fans do LOVE these songs and would almost
        kill to hear the rest. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
