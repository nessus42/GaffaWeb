      <P> To ensure that every message from the newsgroup
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</A> also finds its way
        into the mailing list <A HREF="mailto:love-hounds-request@gaffa.org">Love-Hounds</A>,
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</A> is a moderated
        newsgroup. This means that to post an article to r.m.g you have to send
        it as an email message to the moderator who has to approve the article.
        In r.m.g's case the 'moderator' is the receiving address for the list,
        i.e. love-hounds@gaffa.org. More intelligent news software does know
        about this and if you post an article instead of sending it to the
        moderator's address these systems act in one of three ways: </P>
      <OL>
        <LI> Your article is thrown away. This is the reason why a lot of new
          readers don't find their articles in the news system. If you
          experience this, you have to use the love-hounds@gaffa.org address by
          yourself.</LI><br>
        <LI> Your article is repackaged and forwarded to the moderator. While
          doing this, the news software insists on creating a new header. This
          is responsible for most of the postings with some news system as the
          sender and without any subject. It may be the case that your article
          actually is shown correctly on your news system, especially if the
          system forwarding it to the moderator isn't yours. In this case you
          might wonder why replies or follow-ups to your articles don't have any
          subject. If you experience this, you should either bug your system
          administrator (to change the behaviour to the third one below) or use
          the email address.</LI><br>
        <LI>Your article is directly forwarded to the moderator. This is
          perfectly ok, since then your name and subject lines survive. </LI>
      </OL>
      <P> Be assured again that no article you write is thrown away due to its
        contents or your person. It's just the wrong way of posting it, since
        the whole process is fully automated. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
