November 1985 saw Kate make her first promotional trip to the
United States in seven years. Although mainly New York-based,
Kate did take the opportunity to make a brief visit to Canada,
during which she gave the following interview to <I>Christopher
Ward</I> from the <I>Much Music</I> TV show...</FONT>

<P>
CW: Please welcome my guest Kate Bush! Congratulations on the
success of Hounds 0f Love.</P>
<P>
KB: Thank you, it's fantastic.
</P>

<P>
CW: The UK is no surprise, but it looks like North America is
finally falling in line! Are you happy about that?</P>

<P>
KB: I'm very happy. It's always great when people like.your
music.</P>

<P>
CW: You said that you anguished long over this record. Is that
typical for you recording-wise?
</P>

<P>
KB: I think so, yes. I think, certainly since the third album
(<I>Never Forever</I>) it has been like that. It just seems to be a
long process. You go into it not expecting it to be that
involved, and before you know it, it's dragging you behind it
until it is finished.</P>

<P>
CW: Is that partly a result of having your own studio now?</P>

<P>
KB: Yes, I think it was the last album (<I>The Dreaming</I>) that made
me realise that I needed one, because I was being so prohibited
by the amount of money it was costing every hour, that I felt
it was actually anti-productive to what I wanted to do. I work
very experimentally and it takes time, so it really made sense
to get our own studio together.</P>

<P>
CW: You moved to the country fairly recently, is that part of
the process of building a home studio as well?</P>

<P>
KB: It did really. It was a kind of re-organisation I wanted to
do between the last album and this, where I moved from the city
to the country, I got the studio together and I just took some
time to get back into training and that sort of thing. I think
I made some of my best decisions during that time.</P>

<P>
CW: Are you becoming more reclusive as a result?</P>

<P>
KB: I think I have extremes where I am very
reclusive when I'm working and then totally non-
reclusive when I come out to promote and .., say
to people <CITE>"here's the album"</CITE>.
</P>

<P>
CW: Would you consider your self a social
creature at the best of times? Do you have a
community of musicians, aside from your family
obviously, with those you work with, who you would
regularly and party with?</P>

<P>
KB: Yes, I think there is, again, two parts of me. 0ne that is
a very social beast and the other side of me is probably quiet
and likes to work alone. In fact, I can't really work if
there's more than a few people around.</P>

<P>
CW: Do you have special work habits that you subscribe to? Do
you have a special place you go to work, a certain environment
and certain hours? Do you do that?</P>

<P>
KB: I think the studio has become that disciplined place I can
go to now. It used to be my music room, wherever I had the
piano. And I think it has helped me tremendously to actually
have an environment where I can go, to work. It just makes it
that much easier for me to concentrate.</P>

<P>
CW: And do you set hours that you go there?</P>

<P>
KB: Not actually set hours. It depends how I
feel, but normally I would go there and work for
a certain amount each day, depending on how well
the ideas are coming through.</P>

<P>
CW: I've mentioned the old video's, and you said
that you would like to see Breathing. What is it
particularly about that one that you felt was a
success?</P>

<P>
KB: I think it is one of the few that I've done that I can
actually say that I am quite happy with some of the things that
we did in it. With Breathing, I think it had such a strong
story that it was easier for us to visualise something that we
felt was powerful.</P>

<P>
CW: The song sounds like it was built on visual ideas to begin
with to some extent?</P>

<P>
KB: I think that when I am writing songs, I do have quite
strong visual ideas, but they're not necessarily video ideas if
you know what I mean. I think in order to get to a place, or to
consider yourself in someone else's position, you try to
imagine an environment and I think, in some ways, you think
quite visually about that.</P>

<P>
CW: You suffered a fate in the early days of your career as
being somewhat of a pin up girl in the British pop mags! How
did you deal with that?</P>

<P>
KB: I think what worried me, was that it was going to stop
people taking my music seriously. I've always found it very
complimentary if people say that they find me attractive, and
my worry is really that it would get in the way of my music.But I don't think 
that that has been a problem. I think people do seem to except music for its
own sake</P>

<P>
CW: And does your sexuality have a role in your music?</P>
 
<P>
KB: Well, I think that's something that I find
very confusing, because I think the essence of
all art is sexuality. And sexuality...., I
mean I don't suppose I understand it fully,
but I always tend to think that, that it's 
something that is projected and that sexuality is really where
art is at. It's a much more subtle form of expression.</P>

<P>
CW: There was an interview last year where you said <CITE>"The artist
is just like a magpie, picking out little bit's of gold and
storing them away to use later"</CITE>. What are you picking through
these says?</P>

<P>
KB: I think the whole process is like that. You're continually
looking out for lyrical ideas, musical inspirations, people
that would be good to work with. All the time, you have to keep
looking and listening because it's that accumulation of things
that all your ideas and work depends on.</P>

<P>
CW: What are you looking at and listening to these days?</P>

<P>
KB: Well, at the moment, I'm caught in the middle of a big
promotional trip. It's interesting for me, I'm getting a great
deal of feedback from people which is incredibly rewarding.
And also, I suppose, 0ne positive side of it is that it makes
you think about areas of yourself and your music that you
wouldn't do unless people were asking you these questions.</P>

<P>
CW: So you don't have any current obsessions in terms of film,
or music, or art that you might pass onto us?</P>

<P>
KB: I think my current obsessions are films. Between the last
album and this one, I got very into our video machine at home
and taping lots of films off the television. I think they have
been very inspirational for me. And I think that perhaps my
video work is moving away from being theatrical and dance
orientated to perhaps being more cinematically influenced.</P>

<P>
CW: We have the video to <I>Sat In Your Lap</I>. Do you have a few
thoughts on that to pass along?</P>

<P>
KB: That was one of the fun video's that we did, where the song
is about the search for knowledge and I suppose we just wanted
to have a bit of fun in this video and try to express that
we're looking for that thing.</P>
 
</P>
CW: As early was 1980, you were experimenting with the
<I>Fairlight</I>computer musical instrument. Has that changed the way
you approach creating music?</P>

<P>
KB: Yes, very much so. I think it was one of the best things to
happen for be alongside rhythm machines. Not only has it helped
with the initial writing process where I'm getting associations
off the sounds straight away as I start writing the song, but
also from the arrangement point of view where if I want stings
or bass on a track, I can work out an arrangement on the
Fairlight with that particular sound. And then, if I want, I
can get the real musicians in to re-do it.</P>

<P>
CW: I think you were one of the first artists that I ever knew,
along with perhaps <I>Peter Gabriel</I>, who use the Fairlight at all.</P>

<P>
KB: I was very lucky in that I was at the studio where they
decided to demonstrate the machine at the very early stages. It
had only been in the country for one day while they were
setting up the company. And as soon as I saw it, I knew that I
had to have one, and that it was going to become a very
important part of my work.<P>

<P>
CW: Are you an aggressive business person? we hear stories that
on the first album a very young Kate Bush insisted that
<I>Wuthering Heights</I> be the first single against some resistance.
Is that true and are you in fact very aggressive about your
business? .</P>

<P>
KB: I don't know if I'm aggressive about my business, but I do,
a lot of the time, feel strongly about what I want or how I
want to see it presented. It is an expression of me at some
point and it seems wrong that as soon as it goes out into the
world, that it should leave me and my expression behind.
Wuthering Heights, I felt, was much more an interesting single
that perhaps some that were being suggested at that time. And I
just felt that it was a good idea at the time to hang out for
it. I did feel strongly about it.</P>

<P>
CW: It certainly paid off. A number one in the U.K.!</P>

<P>
KB: Yes.</P>

<P>
CW: Do you rely on dreams a lot for inspiration
for your songs?</P>

<P>
KB: It's strange, but a few people have started
asking me that question recently and I would
say no, that I can't actually think of any song
that a dream his directly inspired.</P>

<P>
CW: Are you a keeper of a dream diary or
something like that?</P>
 
<P>
KB: No I'm not, no.</P>

<P>
CW: It's interesting that there is a surrealist
quality to some of your songs that might tend
one to think that....but not the case?</P>

<P>
KB: No, not consciously.</P>

<P>
CW: I want to ask you about the second side of
the <I>Hounds 0f Love</I> LP. It's a conceptual piece
called <I>The Ninth Wave</I>. What led you to that
concept and how did you go about developing it?</P>

<P>
KB: It's quite hard to pin point the initial inspiration, but
I'm sure that it came from a combination of war movies where
people were...., soldiers were either thrown out of the ship or
a plane into the sea, and that whole strength of.imagery of
water, of the sea. This enormous great power with this tiny
little human being in it. And I suppose, the whole parallel
too. Like sensory depravation, where if you're in the .water
long enough, your mind starts travelling. So it gave me a
vehicle to travel to different places and yet keep a theme.</P>

<P>
CW: Did you take yourself to an isolation tank or anything to
achieve that particular sensation?</P>

<P>
KB: No. No, it's something that I would certainly like to
experience. But I spend a lot of time writing, particularly the
lyrics, by water. I was staying by the sea, by likes, so a lot
of the time there was water stimulus.</P>

<P>
CW: We have your brand new video for <I>Cloudbusting</I>, also from
Hounds 0f Love, and I read an article in <I>Number 0ne</I>magazine
and they said something very unusual happened during the
shooting of it! Is that all rumours?</P>

<P>
KB: (Laughing) Yes, I can't think of anything.</P>

<P>
CW: They talked about ghosts and all sorts of things.</P>

<P>
KB: Did they?</P>

<P>
CW: Do you want to straighten out any of these rumours for us?</P>

<P>
KB: Well, as far as I know, there was no ghost present,
although there were lots of human beings, and a particularly
good actor called Donald Sutherland.</P>

<P>
CW: 0f course, a well known Canadian actor as well.</P>

<P>
KB: Absolutely, yes.</P>

<P>
CW: So tell us about the video. What were you trying to
accomplish?</P>
 
<P>KB: I really wanted it to be a short piece of film. I didn't want it to be seen
as a promotional clip, or even a video, but as a film. And part of that idea was having an actor, hopefully a great actor that would play the part of the father, and myself playing the part of the young boy. And the song was inspired by a book that's all about the special relationship between.. the guy who wrote the book and his father. His father was a very respected psycho-analyst/psychiatrist and had lots of theories about life-energy and rain, and also had this machine called <I>Cloudbuster</I> which could make it rain. So, together they'd go out in the desert to make it rain. This was a special moment for the child.</P>

<P>CW: And what book is that?</P>

<P>KB: It's called <I>A Book Of Dreams</I>, and the man who wrote it is <I>Peter Reich</I>. And unfortunately, the peak of the book is that his father is arrested. His beliefs were considered outrageous, people (being) afraid of what they don't know, especially at that time.. It was very hard for the child to cope without his father. And in some ways, the connection with rain for him, every time it rains, he thinks of his father. So it's a positive way of coping without him.</P>
