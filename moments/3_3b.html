<BR> Subject: the film</P>
<P>IED hopes, too, that Kate &quot;won't give up the day job,&quot; but does
not concede that  TLTCATC is a less-than-superior artifaKT. Whether some viewers
(Peter Chow?)  enjoyed the extended twirling shots of &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;
or not, they were  obviously done not for want of imagination (Kate Bush lacking
imagination?!) but to  reach intended expressive and dramatic ends. In fact, the
camera twirls at other  points in the film, too, and these sequences' cumulative
effect on the eye is either  hypnotically or nauseatingly vertiginous (depending
on the aesthetic receptivity and  gastric constitution of the viewer), but
hardly boring! It is amply evident that the film  is a work of unqualified
genius, and absolutely without flaw. </P>

(Ulrich Grepel) <BR> Subject: Shoedance dialogue </P>
<P>&gt; With all this quarreling I still don't have the answer to previous
questions like  what's being said on the Shoedance remix by those two voices.
</P>
<P>That's a scene from the film after Miranda Richardson enters through the 
mirror and wants to make Kate draw the line, the cross and the curve. Lindsay 
Kemp also says something in there which is a) not understandable and b) (IMHO) 
not very relevant (I didn't understand it anyway...). I didn't understand some 
things, especially in the beginning when Miranda is quite hectic in trying to
explain  how she came there. </P>
<P>M: What am I here? I don't[?] want[?] to be here. I don't understand how
this has  happened. </P>
<P>K: What the hell is going on - look without[?]. </P>
<P>M: Oh please! You must help me. </P>
<P>K: What have you done to yourself? </P>
<P>M: There was an accident, a big fire. I looked[?] over[?] me, my hands are
all  burned and blistered. There was so much smoke I couldn't believe it. I
could, I  was trying to find my way out of for years[?]. You must help me! Help
me... </P>
<P>K: How can I help you? </P>
<P>M: I can't use my hands. I can't use my hands, I have to get back ... back
... home  ... There is only one moment left for me to return. And it lies in
your hands now. </P>
<P>K: Don't worry, you'll get home! </P>
<P>M: You need three pieces of paper. </P>
<P>K: There's some on the piano. Will this do? </P>
<P>M: Yes. You draw a line on the first piece. </P>
<P>K: Like this? </P>
<P>M: Yes ... A cross ... </P>
<P>K: Yes. </P>
<P>M: Good! ... A Curve ... </P>
<P>K: Here. </P>
<P>M: Thank you. Is there something I can give you in return? The red shoes
perhaps? </P>
<P>K: The pretty red shoes? </P>
<P>M: Take them, they're yours. As a gift. Gimme a cause. </P>
<P>Bye, Uli </P>

<P>In fact the line &quot;She tricked ya y'know?&quot; is the key to Miranda's

shoes to her feet. By writing  out the symbols and giving them to the victim the
spell is transferred. </P>

GRAHAM.G.R.DOMBKINS@msm.bhp.com.au <BR> Subject: We saw TLTCTC last night! :-)
</P>
<P>Hi all! </P>
<P>Well we finally got to see the TLTCTC in NSW last night. It was such a
relief to  see it after trying so hard for so long to get it here. I spent last
weekend getting  ready. IO got my sister to help me whip up a new KT T-Shirt
(all black with a big  with logo on the front) and I also bought some cheap
white tennis shoes and bright  red fabric paint to attack them with. By the time
Wednesday rolled around I was  looking very much the part of the 'Fucking KaTe
Bush Fanatic' (tm). </P>
<P>EMI was ready, they had invited a heap in 'industry' people along. I had got
a  list of about 90 KaTe fans in NSW lined up to come. I was off to Sydney by
2:00pm  with a mate of mine just to make sure I'd be there in plenty of time for
the opening  at 6:00pm. You know it's really funny just how much bright shiny
red shoes stick  out when you walk around! :-) I did a little music shopping
before I got to the  theater and picked up Tori's 'Past the Mission' CD singles
Part 1 &amp; 2 and the new  KaTe 'Eat The Music' CD Single with ETM, ETM
(extended), You Want Alchemy  and Shoedance. It's got one of those
Scratch-and-Sniff CD covers! :-) I'm not sure  whether it's Australian or an
import. Anybody know? </P>
<P>Anyway, I got to the theater by 5:30pm and it didn't take long for all the
KaTe  fans to start to arrive. It was great to get to talk to a heap of fellow
KaTe fans here  in Oz!! :-) By 6:00pm we had a fair sized crowd milling around
outside but no sign of  anybody from EMI. The chap in charge of the theater let
us all in and then went to  load up the film which had only just arrived (he
said it was a great print). I mingled  and tried to talk to as many other people
there as I could. It turned out that the  were a fair few reps from various
music mags and columns there as well but NO EMI :-/ </P>
<P>I was sort of elected as being in charge so I got everyone in and seated
whilst we  waited for *anybody* from EMI to turn up. They all got there enmass
at about  6:30pm. We all settled back for the film. They forgot to turn the
sound on for the  first 15 seconds and then it wasn't turned up to normal volume
till after RbG. :-/  Having got through all that it was on with the film! I
won't go into any kind of  description since it has been described here enough
already except to say that we  were all totally blown away! We spent most of the
time in rapt silence except for the  bit where *everybody* got dizzy in ETM (I
looked around at that point and noted  that almost everyone was moving in time
with KaTe. :-) I also had to crack up at the  point just after KaTe first sings
The Red Shoes and is 'sitting' on the ground with  her legs going crazy. &lt;he
he&gt; :-) </P>
<P>I had a great time, thoroughly enjoyed the film and was ready to see it all
again  straight away. In fact many people around the theater shouted 'Again!'
after it had  finished but we had to get out of there since they had another
crowd of people ready  to come in and watch a few old Twilight Zone episodes.
</P>
<P>I talked to some of the EMI people after the show to see if the showing of
the  film around the rest of Australia was still on or not. They said no!! 8-(
But then  when I asked them what if I got the theater organized they said they'd
be happy to  give me the film. So it looks like I'm going to need a somebody
from each state to  help organize a theater so we can get this thing shown
around. At the moment I  have Nick Langmaid in Victoria and Frederic in
Queensland. Any other takers? SA?  WA? Tas? Another good thing was they said it
would be going across the Tasman to  New Zealand so you Kiwis take heart, it'll
be there! </P>
<P>Well that's about it from me for now. I hope I haven't bored you all too
much  with this write up but I'm still buzzing from *finally* getting to see the
film. YAH!  :-) See you all later. </P>

<P>I bought a copy of TLTCTC last night. The place I got it from had one copy
(not  one left, but they only ordered one TOTAL). I thought Kate was wonderful.
She put  a lot into her performance I think (and she smiled some too!). My
favorite part was  the Red Shoes sequence with Kate dancing around the skulls
and such. Miranda  Richardson and Kemp were great too. All in all, a nice little
piece of film. </P>

<P>Well, I'm back from the Chicago Showing of TLTCTC. </P>
<P>All I can say and perhaps the best praise I can give the movie is that
despite the  fact that I had to spend over ten hours of my weekend on the road
just to spend  about 45 minutes watching a movie, IT WAS WORTH IT. </P>
<P>Of course it didn't hurt that they did a drawing before the showing and I
was  one of maybe a dozen winners of a 12&quot; picture disk of Rubberband Girl.
</P>
<P>I could go on and on (and on) saying good things about the movie. I think it
 didn't hurt that I'd heard some less than five-star reviews of the movie which
had  lowered my expectations; but even if I had been expecting a superb movie, I
 wouldn't have been disappointed.  I don't see any reason why anyone who liked 
TRS album wouldn't like the movie. (as for people who don't care for TRS, I
still  think a lot of them might enjoying watching Kate for a bit.) </P>
<P>I'm determined to keep this post short, but I still need to mention the fact
that I  did actually get to meet Chris and Vicki very briefly after the movie.
I'd kinda  figured out who they were just from seeing Chris's Love-hounds shirt,
but I didn't  know for sure until afterwards. It was a bit unfortunate that I
was still dizzy from  the Eat the Music segment and dazed from the culmination
of my trip in the form of  the movie to properly introduce myself. Anyway, it
was really nice to see some other  people from this forum in a kate-positive
atmosphere... </P>
<P>One more comment, I was very surprised to see how emotional the ASIL 
segment turned out to be...I had truly expected MoP to be the one song that most
 affected me, but just seeing Kate's expressions during ASIL really tore at my
heart. </P>
<P>One more comment, (ok, this is really the last one),  this was the first
time I've  ever had to sit relatively still during RG. Probably the last time
too. As focused as I  was on watching Kate, the song still made me feel the need
to move. </P>
<P>in hopes that everyone who hasn't seen it already will enjoy TLTCTC as much
as  I have, </P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">&quot;The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve&quot; </H3>
<H3 ALIGN="center">A musical/fantasy film by Kate Bush </H3>
<P>Starring: </P>
<P>Kate Bush </P>
<P>Miranda Richardson </P>
<P>Lindsay Kemp </P>
<P>Lily </P>
<P>Stewart Arnold </P>
<P>Peter Richardson </P>
<P>Written and directed by Kate Bush. </P>
<P>Yesterday we had the pleasure of seeing this 43 minute film at a theater in 
Chicago. The film print was gorgeous, and we sat right up front so we could bask
in  the glorious color and detail. In my opinion, the film isn't anywhere near
brilliant,  but Kate doesn't pretend to be Kubrick. Also, Kate's not a very good
actress, and  there are a couple of bits that are downright embarrassing, even
to huge KB fans.  Still, Miranda Richardson *can* act, and Kate *can* sing, and
there's more than  enough here in other areas to make it a treat for the eyes
and ears. </P>
<P>Kate knows she's not an actress, and wisely lets Miranda chew up the scenery
 and steal the show. Even if I weren't a Kate fan, I'd love this film just for 
Miranda's evil character. Kate's strengths are her voice and music, her sense of
 color and style, and her wonderful facial expressions. Speaking of facial
expressions,  this film could (and surely will) provide a wealth of still-frame
gifs and jpegs. Those  eyes! </P>
<P>Kate's idea of humor is sometimes roll-your-eyes slapstick silly and at
other  times weird, and the film provides lots of laughs. The film can also
provoke a few  tears too, at least for me, during the &quot;Moments Of Pleasure&quot;
section. I don't know  that that part would affect non-Kate Bush fans in the
same way though. To be  honest, I have no idea what non-Kate fans would even
think of this film as a whole,  and I'm curious to know. </P>
<P>All the songs in the film are from Kate's album The Red Shoes, which isn't a
 concept album. Kate had to work out a story linking 5 other unrelated songs to
the  title track, which was itself inspired by Michael Powell's film The Red
Shoes . Kate  decided to make the film after the album was finished, but before
it was released to  stores. Some of the videos in this film were shown on MTV
and various music video  shows, while others are specific to the film. </P>
<P>What follows is a synopsis of the film. Since TLTCTC (or /+( or /x) among
other  variations) is basically an extended music video, and the ending is never
in question,  I give more and complete details wrt the plot than I normally
would with a &quot;regular&quot;  film. It might be more than some people want
to know though, so read at your own  discretion. </P>
<P>................................................</P>
<P>The film opens with the song &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; and &quot;Kate&quot;
is shown in a dance  studio with a group of musicians and another dancer
(Stewart Arnold). They're all  rehearsing a dance routine for the song. The
key-word here is &quot;rehearsing&quot; and I  emphasize it because it has a
loose and &quot;unfinished&quot; look. This portion was shown as  a video in the
UK and I've heard complaints that it looks unprofessional. Of course!  It's
supposed to look like that. There are even a few scenes where Kate stands there 
doing nothing but fiddling with her sweater. My take on it is that those are
bits to be  &quot;filled in&quot; later by other dance moves. This seems to be
confirmed when, after the  rehearsal is cut short (by some silliness involving a
huge runaway fan and Peter  Richardson), Kate asks Arnold to show her a dance
move he had in mind. They  rehearse it in front of the very large mirror that
lines one wall of the dance studio.  It's obvious that Kate's not happy with her
dancing, and she seems tired and  depressed. The rehearsal is further delayed
when the lights go out because of a  thunderstorm, and everyone leaves the room
except for Kate. </P>
<P>(Just to make it clear, I put quotes around &quot;Kate&quot; because, of
course, it's a  character after all. She's not playing herself. Unfortunately,
no character names are  ever given, with the exception of Lily, so I have no
choice but to use the real names  rather than character names) </P>
<P>Kate lights a candle, which marks the beginning of &quot;And So Is Love&quot;
with the  character singing of the sadness in life and love. There's a beautiful
section involving  a disoriented bird....(hey, it's a synopsis, not a
play-by-play)...and at the end of the  song Kate is shocked by the Miranda
Richardson character who runs out of the  mirror (from the &quot;otherworld&quot;)
in a wild costume and with her hands bandaged.  Miranda is under the spell of
The Red Shoes, and she tricks Kate into helping her  break the spell. (The spell
is that the shoes can't be taken off and anyone who  wears them *has* to dance,
no matter how tired.) The trickery involves Kate  drawing a line (signifying a &quot;path&quot;)
and a cross (signifying the &quot;heart&quot;) and a curve  (signifying a &quot;smile&quot;)
on 3 pieces of paper and giving them to Miranda. This leads  into the song &quot;The
Red Shoes.&quot; </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the spell is then transferred to Kate. Miranda disappears
back into  the otherworld and Kate follows, where she is suddenly turned into a
witchy dance  diva. Her dress is transformed, her hair is wild and loose, and
she dances like a  madwoman. Luckily, she's helped by a mysterious and kindly
man (played by  Lindsey Kemp) who has just enough power to temporarily calm the
dancing shoes,  but not enough to break the spell. He knows what Kate has to do
though, and he  takes her to an elderly mystical woman named Lily who also knows
all about the  spell and who helps Kate. </P>
<P>Lily tells Kate that she (Kate) must &quot;sing back the symbols&quot; and
starts her off on  her quest to break the spell by teaching Kate a ritual. This
ritual (inspired by a real  pagan ritual) invokes the protection of Kate's four
guardian angels, and helps lead  Kate on her &quot;path.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Lily&quot; (the song) is followed by &quot;Moments Of Pleasure&quot;
after Kate is told by Kemp  that she must call upon the ones she loves.
Remembering and singing about the  people she's loved and lost (those who've
died) helps to give Kate back her &quot;heart.&quot;</P>
<P>The last symbol Kate needs to get is her &quot;smile&quot; and it's not easy
consid-ering the  odd and alien situation she's in, not to mention Miranda's
taunting. Kate's  realization that she's getting stronger and that Miranda is &quot;losing,&quot;
plus a large  helping of voodoo during &quot;Eat The Music&quot; finally breaks
the spell. </P>
<P>There's more to the film, but that's enough of the &quot;plot&quot; to give
an idea of how it  all fits together. And it *does* work, at least for me. The
film has some major flaws,  to be sure, but who cares? There's more than enough
here to enjoy and have fun  with. It's packed with details, color, motion,
music, and lots of fun references to  other films/works ranging from &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot; (of course), &quot;Curse Of The  Demon,&quot; &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot;
&quot;The Company Of Wolves,&quot; a bit of Hitchcock, a bit of film  noir, and
all kinds of other things. Kate has lots of friends in the film business, 
including Terry Gilliam and Julian Doyle (the director and editor of Brazil 
respectively) and they've had a great influence on Kate. (Btw, Julian helps out
as  technical advisor and Gilliam has some fun as a cameraman on the film). </P>
<P>Kate does show promise as a director, and has a *great* sense of color and
style.  It's a beautiful movie to look at, and many scenes and details stick in
the mind long  after the film is over. For me, a few of these would be the
wonderful costumes (by  Hazel Pethig), the crazy slow-motion &quot;air dance&quot;
in the first musical section, the  beautiful candlelight-and-lightning lighting
during &quot;And So Is Love,&quot; Miranda and  Kate's back and forth singing
(Miranda lip syncs) at the beginning of &quot;The Red  Shoes&quot; and Kate's
wild dance-on-the-skulls in the last part of that same song, Lily's  &quot;circle
of fire,&quot; the floating snow scenes at the end of &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;
and the  disorenting voodoo swirling during &quot;Eat The Music&quot; among
many, many other  scenes. </P>
<P>We've been lucky enough to see it in the theater twice; once at a theater in
a  London suburb, and again Sunday. We've also seen it on video many times; once
at  the Konvention in May (where it was introduced by Kate herself), a few other
times  with friends, and a couple more times by ourselves. Even though we bought
the  video, we'll also buy the laserdisc. I just can't see us getting tired of
it. Sure, we're  hard-core fans, and it's a treat for us, but I do think there's
lots here to  recommend it to the casual (or new, or even potential) fan too. As
Lily says in her  song, &quot;take what I say with a pinch of salt&quot; [ger: &quot;mit
Vorbehalt&quot;] and just enjoy the  visuals and music without analysing it to
death. </P>

<P>From: IEDSRI@aol.com <BR> Date: Thu, 3 Nov 1994 10:49:13 -0500 <BR>
Subject: Let The Line, The Cross and The Curve be analyzed to life! </P>
<P>The following may read like an angry attack of Vickie's recent posting about
 &quot;The Line, The Cross and The Curve&quot;. IED apologizes in advance for
the appearance  of hostility. He assures everyone that his hot humor is not
directed at any person, but  rather at an attitude which he perceives as common
among a large (and growing)  number of people both in rec.music.gaffa and in the
world at large. Ordinarily IED  would say nothing about trends in society, but
when those trends threaten to affect  the reception of the work of Kate Bush, he
has no choice but to voice a protest,  however feeble or disorganized it may be,
however bad-tempered it may sound. </P>
<P>With all due respect, then, IED disputes Vickie's claim that this movie is &quot;full
of  flaws&quot;. He also questions her concluding admonition that we &quot;not
analyze [the movie]  to death&quot;. </P>
<P>&quot;The Line, The Cross and The Curve&quot; is not in the least
error-ridden; as for the  danger of over-interpreting the movie's subtleties,
well, let it merely be said that the  analyses that have reached this forum to
date scarcely raise such a danger. </P>
<P>IED is impatient with such a know-nothing, facilely populist attitude toward
Kate  Bush's art, an attitude which after an incubation over many years
threatens to  strangle the flow of earnest Kate Bushological discourse both in
rec.music.gaffa and  in Homeground. It is a supercilious, patronizing attitude,
one that pre-supposes that  anything a given audience has failed to notice or
consider in a work of art (even,  apparently, after prolonged or multiple
exposure) must be of no importance, or is at  best a &quot;mistake&quot; by the
artist. </P>
<P>Even when the artist in question is Kate Bush! &quot;Don't think about it
--just 'feel  it!'&quot; we are so often instructed (as if Kate's early words
were self-explanatory -- as  if feeling were not as much an achievement of the
mind as of the heart). Yet what  better art to establish the intellectual
complexity of human emotion than that of Kate  Bush? What better proof of the
intricacies that constitute the expressive purity of  great art than the latest
production of Kate Bush? </P>
<P>The majority of critics who espouse such an attitude are of course welcome
to  continue to bask in the limp climes of their own flabby thinking. IED,
however,  appeals to the rest of you to pay attention to what you see and hear
in &quot;The Line,  The Cross and The Curve&quot; (as in all of Kate Bush's
work), whether you experience  it once on a television screen or five times in a
movie theater. If you do, he has no  doubt that you will recognize as a Great
Untruth the claim that &quot;the film isn't  anywhere near brilliant.&quot; </P>
<P> &gt;All the songs in the film are from Kate's album The Red Shoes, which
isn't a  concept album. </P>
<P> Is this true? Is it really accurate to say that there is no &quot;concept&quot;
underpinning  the album? Certainly there is no explicit narrative linking the
songs together. But  there is a wealth of thematic, lyrical and musical
interactivity among the tracks. The  conceit of the line, cross and curve alone
comprises the themes of all the other  tracks on the album, in one sense or
another. </P>
<P> &gt; Kate had to work out a story linking 5 other unrelated songs to the
title track,  which was itself inspired by Michael Powell's film The Red Shoes.
</P>
<P> The apparent assumption here is that the decision to make a film preceded
some  kind of forced, artificial concocting of a &quot;plot&quot; for a movie
after the fact. This  judgement was shared by numerous loutish critics in the
print media. But the  incorporation of the images of the line, cross and curve
in the track &quot;The Red  Shoes&quot; is incontestible proof that this is not
so. </P>
<P>Kate Bush's artistic leap, in conceiving of the film, was to recognize and
exploit  in a broader medium the applicability of five songs from her album to
the overriding  theme of the titular song. Once she had seen how each of those
five songs could be  used so as to lend a new narrative context for the album's
pre-existing but  essentially non-linear narrative theme, the &quot;story&quot;
took an organic, logical shape. It is  a fundamental misinterpretation of the
process to say that Kate &quot;had to&quot; work out a  story; rather, a story
naturally evolved out of an all-embracing, philosophically  consistent theme.
</P>
<P>Furthermore, the influence of the Powell/Pressburger film is perhaps more 
obvious but no more important than that of Jacques Tourneur's &quot;Night/Curse
of the  Demon&quot; (which owes its central dramatic theme -- that magic symbols
written on  paper and transferred between two people may invest one with a curse
drawn from  the other -- to the short story &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; by
M.R. James). Kate Bush's  extraordinary decision to fuse these two historically
distant but remarkably  compatible morality-plays by setting the girl of the red
shoes on a journey of  self-discovery through the medium of magical runes is,
exactly, &quot;brilliant&quot; -- as is  her subtle but undeniably consistent
referencing of the two source themes  throughout the film. </P>
<P>One could argue, indeed, that this flair for the alchemical fusion of
pre-existing  themes -- this aesthetic cross-breeding, as it were -- is a key
virtue of Kate Bush's  artistic method, one which can be traced in songs from
her earliest years of  productivity and regularly throughout the residue of her
oeuvre. In &quot;The Line, The  Cross and The Curve&quot; that virtue is perhaps
(and this is typical of Kate Bush) more  quietly displayed than ever, even as
the vehicle chosen (a 43-minute film) is in some  respects her most ambitious to
date; but that virtue is no less real for its subtlety. </P>
<P> &gt;The rehearsal is further delayed when the lights go out because of a 
thunderstorm, and everyone leaves the room except for Kate. </P>
<P>Yes, and why? This device allows the character to light a candle. Doesn't
that  suggest anything? Does anyone see the irony in the scene that follows?
</P>
<P> &gt;There's a beautiful section involving a disoriented bird. </P>
<P>Some details can of course be overlooked in a synopsis of &quot;The Line,
The Cross  and The Curve&quot;, but this one mustn't. It's the first expression
of the theme's  possible lines of resolution and of Kate Bush's increasingly
serious philosophical  preoccupations as they are expressed in the new film.
</P>
<P>What is the setting's significance? </P>
<P>Why is the setting lit by a candle? </P>
<P>To what or whom does Kate's character address the song -- a song which,
judging  from the lyrics alone, apparently refers to a love relationship
ostensibly shared by  two living people? </P>
<P>What is the bird doing? </P>
<P>Who is the bird? </P>
<P>What happens to the bird? </P>
<P>What does Kate's character do to it? </P>
<P>How does she part with the bird? </P>
<P>Where is the bird finally placed, and how does that refer both backward, to
the  album's theme, and forward, to a later pivotal scene in the movie? </P>
<P>IED doesn't presume to have arrived at definitive answers to these
questions; far  from it. But it doesn't take a lot of thought to recognize that
these questions are,  without any doubt, being posed -- that the events which
transpire in the room with  the bird during the song &quot;And So Is Love&quot;
are meaningful, and meaningful in an  extraordinarily rich and deeply personal,
yet (within the terms set forth by the  movie) logical way. Once this fact is
recognized, our procedure through the  labyrinth that follows can at least hold
some promise of useful, enlightening analysis. </P>
<P> &gt;Unfortunately, the spell is then transferred to Kate. Miranda
disappears back  into the otherworld and Kate follows, where she is suddenly
turned into a witchy  dance diva. Her dress is transformed, her hair is wild and
loose, and she dances like  a madwoman. </P>
<P>Isn't there something else to be noticed about Kate's costume? Is she merely
a  &quot;witchy dance diva&quot;? </P>
<P> &gt;Remembering and singing about the people she's loved and lost (those
who've  died) helps to give Kate back her &quot;heart.&quot; </P>
<P>How? Also, is this the first evidence of her &quot;heart&quot; in the movie?
What does Kate  really seem to be saying about &quot;heart&quot;? </P>
<P> &gt;The trickery involves Kate drawing a line (signifying a &quot;path&quot;)
and a cross  (signifying the &quot;heart&quot;) and a curve (signifying a &quot;smile&quot;)
on 3 pieces of paper and  giving them to Miranda. </P>
<P>But these secondary signifiers (the line, cross and curve) refer in turn to
further  indirect signifiers (a path, a heart, a smile). Do these primary
symbolic references  not have more crucial meanings? If it is acknowledged that
they do have more basic  and helpful significance, how then can the argument
sensibly be made that &quot;The  Line, The Cross and The Curve&quot; does not
support further analysis? </P>
<P>This movie is crammed, absolutely packed, with symbols, symbols which 
inevitably refer to additional underlying symbols. All of these in turn point to
and  encompass an unmistakably direct and unaffected emotional core. Therefore,
the  surrounding and defining presence of these multivalent symbols -- much like
the  magical angels, the circle of fire, the slips of paper, and the procession
of dead  friends, all of which surround and describe the protagonist's soul at
different points  in her journey -- must be investigated seriously, if we are to
have any hope of  understanding the essential personal and universal
significance of &quot;The Line, The  Cross and The Curve&quot;. </P>
<P>Please, Love-Hounds, just this once -- let's do analyze it to death. </P>

<P>Date: Fri, 4 Nov 1994 14:35:29 -0600 (CST) <BR> From: Keith DeWeese x422 &lt;kpd000@dns.colum.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: First writing--\ X U </P>
<P>After watching \ X U so many times that my tiny thumb has practically fused 
itself to my remote control console (this makes keystroking rather tricky), I
have  come to the conclusion that I have been waiting for the film for a very
long time. I  do not mean since I first heard that Kate was making a film. No, I
have been waiting  since I first heard Kate speak of her appreciation of the
film medium, of the  inspiration with which her favorite films have provided
her. Of course, she speaks of  film viewing always, even when she speaks of
music making and listening. The  moving image coupled with sound has fascinated
her since she was &quot;little Katey  Bush&quot; and first confronted by Cathy,
the ghost orphan of the moors. </P>
<P>Yet, as deeply grateful as I am that Cathy found middle-c in the barn, I
cannot but  help wonder what turns the whole story would have taken had she
found a Bolex  camera laying in the straw, too. I imagine... </P>
<P>My favorite Cathy film, CAMILLA [sic]/COMING UP...a child's vision so much 
more delicate than [Sangster's?] crass vampire lovers or Vadim's ponderous death
 pleasures...maybe more at Dreyer's vampire twilight...and, as usual, on to the 
LeFanu source just to make sure she got her research right... </P>
<P>I am certain, too, that I was waiting for Kate's film since first viewing
Argento's  SUSPIRIA and INFERNO, Jordan's COMPANY OF WOLVES, and Paradjanov's 
THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES, all films that come to mind when I watch \ X U. </P>
<P>And, thankfully, when I watch her film, I do not really think of NIGHT OF
THE  DEMON or THE RED SHOES. That she should be inspired by the films only 
witnesses the brilliance of her imagination. She draws the films together then 
practically chucks them in favor of their antecedants. I am stunned. Upon first 
viewing the film, I was taken in by the color, the dancing, the music--as usual,
but  thought, &quot;Hmm, now that plot is something else. What? I'm not sure.&quot;
</P>
<P>Later, after a dozen more viewings, I realized that on my first viewing I
had  failed to cast out the film I had made in my mind in order to make room for
Kate's.  I did the same thing back in 1983 when I first viewed the
Hammersmith-Odeon  show. I also realized that, as savvy as I like to think I am
with regard to certain  areas of knowledge, I was hit hard by what I can only
term Kate's embarassment of  riches. So many ideas, so many viewpoints, so many
colors--it takes my breath away.  Indeed, that is what I was waiting for, it's
what I wanted. </P>
<P>I am glad \ X U is not the the sum of the old chestnuts. NIGHT OF THE DEMON 
has its specific time, its specific place, as does THE RED SHOES. I cannot
really  determine where I am at or what time it is when I watch Bush's work, and
that is  what makes it, for me, marvelous. </P>
<P>First, damn the lights, put them out and out again! Mourn the past. Call
down the  Symbolist's black bird, and, in a love-death, let it rest in state on
red velvet. </P>
<P>Second, conjure up a femme-fatale from a child's holiday pantomime. I do not
 know if it was first written by Andersen, Wilde, or Hoffmann--perhaps all three
 and Ovid, too, perched on Kate's shoulder, whispering the story in her ear.
And, as  a critical success, the story might be read another way: gynoerotikon.
Dear Angela  Carter is happily weeping in her grave. </P>
<P>Next, call down Annie [Beasant?] and just try tangling with her over issues
of  political correctness inherent in the casting of mere men as genderless
psychopomps. </P>
<P>Truly, I do not even know where to begin with regard to the Jacobean devils
and  the Bosch Lucifer under winged-foot. </P>
<P>One might be quick to write off \ X U as a simple variation on Carroll's 
THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS and Baum's THE WONDERFUL WIZARD  OF OZ, but think more
of the court fantasies of 18th century France...think of  Beauty trapped in the
Beast's chateau, looking into her enchanted mirror which  enables her to view
performances at the opera or ballet, then wishing she was  there...but unlike
Beauty who must be satisfied with the vicarious thrill, the  unnamed, red-shoed
dancer is forced through the glass and given a part in some old  world
vaudeville cum morality play. </P>
<P>Jolly, red devil-ettes of the dance-hall Hell mock the prostrate, writhing,
and  black Lucifer undone by both purifying water and the dancer suddenly
translated  like Mary in the Dormition. Ave means wings, too. </P>
<P>If you've read this far, thank you. Have to go. </P>

<BR> Subject: IED's TLTCTC Analysis </P>
<P>Having obtained my laserdisc of TLTCTC yesterday and watching it 3 times in
a  row, I'm throwing in my 2 cents with IED's analysis. I think criticizing the
film's  plot is like saying four Dali canvases aren't as interesting as a
Peanuts strip because  there's no joke in the last panel. I disagree with IED
only insofar as I don't want to  deconstruct the work right now - I'm content to
let it wash over me (not unlike  some of the films of David Lynch, which TLTCTC
bore some resemblance to at  points). It did make me look at several of the
songs in a new light, particularly &quot;Eat  the Music&quot; -the image of a
shaman convulsing, his eyes rolling back, while he  puppets Kate struck me as
pretty darn eerie, a feeling I now associate with the  disarmingly-upbeat song
itself. Now that's art.

Subject: Kate Bush: another art reference (TLTCTC) </P>
<P>A typically veiled reference of influence by Kate Bush: </P>
<P>In /XU, &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; [IED means &quot;ASIL&quot;. --WIE]
features a  deceptively simple section showing Kate's character lighting a
candle while singing  as though to herself. Her face is lit almost entirely by
the candle's flame. During a  later part of this segment she picks up a black
bird (itself a symbol in Kate Bush's  work since 1978 or earlier, as you all
know) from a book, where it has landed, dead  from colliding with a closed
window. On one open page of the book is an image. </P>
<P>IED has identified this image as a color reproduction of a famous oil
painting,  &quot;Joseph the Carpenter&quot; (c. 1645, 129.9 x 101 cm., Musee du
Louvre, Paris) by the  French Baroque artist Georges de la Tour (1593-1652). Why
is it here? Those familiar  with la Tour's style will immediately recall
intimate interior scenes of figures  revealed by the soft, warm light of a
candle. &quot;Joseph the Carpenter&quot; is a la Tour icon  in this respect.
Kate Bush was acknowledging the artist's direct influence in this  scene.
Typically, however, this reference is extremely well hidden. Yet further proof 
of the importance of details in Kate Bush's aesthetic. </P>

<P>IED goofed. No excuses made, but an explanation for this mix-up is offered,

these  two songs as revealed in the movie. IED had had no idea that &quot;And So

<BR> Subject: More: \ X U </P>
<P>&quot;[...feather on the breath of God...],&quot; an association with
Hildegaard von Bingen. </P>
<P>I believe this woman who is dancing is always dancing with preternatural
beings,  hence her surprise by, but not fear of, the malicious, red-shoed
tricksie. And though  I know the feathered adornment atop the trickster's head
is a representation of  some small, black bird, I like toying with the idea that
the woman is the Black Swan  of the lake. </P>
<P>The burned and bandaged hands are part of a ruse, of course, but, perhaps,
her  fingers came too close to the devil's fork, from which red slippers once
dangled--an  old French folktale, &quot;The Old Maid's Red Slippers,&quot; comes
to mind. Also, Karen, of  Andersen's story, snatches her ragged, red shoes from
the stove. </P>
<P>I have memory of this, from an early December 1993 telephone interview
session:  when asked, &quot;What inspired the song and your film?&quot; Kate
answered, &quot;The story I  know is about a young woman who wears magic, red
slippers each night and goes  off dancing with the fairies until she's
exhausted.&quot; I'm intrigued by this answer  because it does not recall the
plot of Andersen's tale but does recall the story  collected by the Grimms, &quot;The
Dancing Princesses,&quot; I believe, and the British  folktale of Kate
Crackernuts or Crackercorn. </P>
<P>Seemingly, too, the woman tricked is compelled to journey to not just one
but, at  least, three underworlds by agents of increasing power and spiritual
dominion. The  coniving diva is something of a dwindled entity, perhaps a fallen
angel of one of the  lower orders. She is rather like the doppelganger of
Dante's Virgil leading the  woman to the snowy, frozen, innermost point of the
Inferno. I might conjecture, too,  that Lily, as an extension of the Mary
concept, is seated in Purgatory, a place of  weeping but not inescapable. Lily
is motherly, she is enthroned, she is in blue, she is  first seen through a veil
of water-like substance (Mary, meri, mer-). She knows  there is suffering, yet
certain prayers will deliver the woman from eternal  damnation. </P>
<P>Then, oddly, the most harrowing excursion...into &quot;Moments of Pleasure.&quot;
The  woman is known to cherish family and friends, so imagine the horror of
never or  barely touching them again, seeing them float just outside of reach,
Tantalus's reach  for sure, in desolation, in a snow storm, without anchor. Then
a sobering slap, a  crash to a field of snow spread over by her heart. Seems
rather like a season in Hell to me. </P>
<P>\ X U is personal and catholic at once. </P>
<P>The woman's race to snatch back her symbols leads her to the Elysian Fields
for  a time. There, once she has recovered her three golden apples, she is
fortified. But it  is not only her strength that defeats the wicked one: she
stuns her enemy against a  wall of running, purifying water. I do believe that
Lily-Mary takes care of the rest. </P>
<P>Like so many baroque and renaissance paintings of mixed-metaphysical and 
mixed-cultural elements, Kate does a very good job of depicting &quot;where Hell
and  Heaven dance.&quot; I like knowing that she is &quot;quite a happy little
soul.&quot; </P>
<P>I have neglected Kemp's character in the film. Next time. Thanks for
reading.</P>

<P>I finally saw TLTCTC and loved it! Actually I was not expecting it to be as 
entertaining as it turned out to be, mostly because of the, let's say, 'subdued'
 comments of some of the other postings. </P>
<P>I know I saw IED's comments on the movie posted earlier (I should have kept 
them to read them after I saw the movie..bummer), but I was wondering peoples' 
ideas of the bird symbolism. Seems to me that Miranda and Kate turned
'bird-like'  after the Red Shoes transformation. Bird feathers in their costume,
etc. In fact some  of the publicity photos from the KBC magazine showed them
with a bird hat (I  don't think they wore these in the film). Any ideas on this
bird thing??? </P>

<P>Richard Hamilton asks... </P>
<P>&gt;What is Lindsay Kemp's character? I thought perhaps he was the devil,
but I  kinda doubt it. </P>
<P>Lindsay Kemp plays the character which gives Kate the clues she needs to &quot;sing
 back the symbols.&quot; I remember a while back someone using the phase &quot;...helps
 Kate.&quot; On one level I agree. He does tell her what she needs to
know...along with  Lily. But doesn't he seem a bit devious? When I first saw his
grin whilst &quot;Kate's&quot;  legs were swooshing about I thought for sure
that he was the bad guy. (I have not  seen the Red Shoes, so I'm only going on
what I've seen in TL,TC&amp;TC.) As the  film progressed I learned that he was
helping out, but that initial perception still  stayed. Has anyone else felt the
same way? </P>

<P>I absolutely agree. This film was not intended to be riveting drama. It's a

<P>...
</P>
<P>IED cannot, however, resist offering (again) an example of Kate Bush's
attention  to thematic (not narrative) continuity in TLTCTC: the &quot;And So Is
Love&quot; segment  which our Knight praised for showing Kate &quot;simply
sitting beside a candle and  singing&quot; is actually packed with personal and
mysterious symbols: the bird (who  portends [or not?] Kate's character's
imminent struggle to break through her own  inhibitions -- she wears a birdlike
headdress in thematically echoic scenes that  follow) is laid to rest by the
protagonist with ceremonial solemnity on &quot;the 'V' of  the velvet&quot;,
next to an open book on which can just be made out a painting of St.  Joseph by
Georges de la Tour, after whose distinctive lighting effects the scene is 
modelled. 
</P>
<P>There are several other subtle points made in that scene alone (note the
fruit and  the sheet-music, for example), which IED encourages other fans to
explain for  themselves. But these points alone should be enough to make one
reconsider hasty  assumptions about the relative simplicity of certain parts of
Kate's work -- as it is all  the art of Kate Bush, so is it all imbued with the
curious, matchless grace of her  mind. So, enjoy, by all means! Praise, without
restraint (as Wieland has just done, to  his great credit)!
</P>
<P>But please, don't patronize; in the end, you'll be the poorer for it.

<BR> Subject: 3SAT-epilogue: TLTC&amp;TC 
</P>
<P>Hi! 
</P>
<P>Still somehow besides myself, I will try to write some thoughts on the 3SAT 
repeatings also: 
</P>
<P>TLTC&amp;TC: The quality was almost the same as on my VHS-video, but they
used  german subtitles, so finally little Wieland got the story and what's it
all about! The  translations were very accurate. So, if someone needs this
subtitled version... 
</P>
<P>Some comments: 
</P>
<P>- I love the man in the beginning, the one with the fan, how he waves his
hands  against the fan, very funny.
</P>
<P>- The painting in the book. I always wondered, how IED could identify this
one. I  only see something white, spots on a black page. Is is better on the
laserdisk?
</P>
<P>- before she jumps into the mirror: She's walking on tiptoe, but she grows
more  than 30 cm when she started. I think, it's not possible to walk like this,
but what's  the trick here?
</P>
<P>- TRS: I'm still irritated, why she enjoys dancing on bones and skulls.
Okay, she  enjoys dancing, but in hell? Maybe she's not herself here, this is
the voodoo? 
</P>
<P>(But why is this picture on the Cover of the MoP-single?)
</P>
<P>- during the scene with Kate sitting on the floor with her shoes/legs
twirling  through the air: &quot;Take them off, take the shoes off.. they burn..
please.&quot; - Why did  L. Kemp enjoys it? &quot;It's really happening to ya&quot;
he's smiling and laughing. Is he  some kind of mad? Who is he? Does he know,
that everything comes to a good end? 
</P>
<P>- I love the scene before MoP, where you can see Kate's eyes only, turning
round  and round. This eyes-only angle looks very beautiful, but I don't know
why.
</P>
<P>- During the first refrain in MoP: She sails out of the open window into the
night  with the sky full of stars -&lt; Eternity/Time/Moments... falling
stars... moments...  every star one moment?
</P>
<P>- after MoP, when she rises from the snow and says: &quot;I can't hear you!&quot;
-She  looks sooo beautiful... 
</P>
<P>Do you remember the front of KBC No.11? One of my favorites.
</P>
<P>- Maybe someone can identify the notes, that can be seen after MoP? You can
see  almost one full page of something. Anyone, who can play them? We have so
many  experts here. Try it! Maybe it gives some new inside? 
</P>
<P>- The scene with Kate and Miranda wrestling: 
</P>
<P>LK: &quot;RUN!&quot; 
</P>
<P>KB: &quot;I can't!&quot; 
</P>
<P>MR: &quot;She can't&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yes, there's a humorous element in it. But I saw it not before you told me, 
Andrew! It's too obvious: She *CAN'T*! It's physically impossible to run, buried
 under someone elses body. 
</P>
<P>- to Brett: Re: your idea that Kate before the mirror is &quot;Cathy&quot;
and Kate behind  the mirror is &quot;Kate&quot;. Maybe Kate is &quot;Cathy&quot;
and Miranda is &quot;Kate&quot;? 
</P>
<P>Cathy, the creative genius must help Kate, the popstar? Mmmh, mmh, mmh... 
</P>
<P>And maybe Kemp is also little bit Kate? The THIRD Kate? The one, who looks 
down at these foolish little girls, seeing their problems in the true relation?

</P>
<P>These are very interesting points and I watched the film under these
premises.  For example in TRS Miranda's words are sung by Kate. Does that
indicate, they are  the same person? Why did Cathy got the shoes from Kate? To
feel, how it feels? It's  an interesting point, but it works not always. But one
can discuss it In Every Detail  (IED) and at length! And, if you're right: At
the end Cathy (the introvert!) wins!  Interesting. 
</P>
<P>- the end is open: What happens after the waterfall with Miranda buried
alive  under rubble? 
</P>
<P>What can Kate (Cathy?) can tell us now afer this experience? Kate buried and
 Cathy free? (at last, GLC.)
</P>
<P>Watch the film again! You can discover so many things. It's a Magical
Mystery  Tour! 
</P>
<P>        WHO ARE YOU, KATE??? 
</P>
<P>Best wishes 
</P>

</P>
<P>Hello Love Hounds, 
</P>
<P>Thanks Uli, thanks Weiland, for the advance notice of KaTe's 3 Sat
appearances. 
</P>
<P>-+) aired in its entirety with (thank you 3 Sat) no commercial interruption.
The  picture quality, being PAL, of course was excellent. One thing I noticed
this time  while watching it: After KaTe loses the papers to Miranda, each comes
back to her  in a form of foreshadowing prior to the actual occurrence. The line
(path) comes to  her at the end of 'Lily', when she's laying down and Lily says,
&quot;...the spell is  broken&quot;. The cross (heart) burns into the sheet of
music after she calls upon those  she loves (MoP). The curve (smile) is
virtually omnipresent during 'Eat the Music',  as each of the dancers has a
paper smile up to their mouths while dancing. 
</P>
<P>Having not seen -+) for some time, it was terrific to once again experience
the  mastery of this film, especially 'ASiL'. 
</P>
<P>3 Sat later aired Bio's Bahnhof, from 1978. It featured KaTe singing 'Kite'
and  'Wuthering Heights', a literally live performance of her 'Wuthering
Heights' 7  inch single, with b-side.  These were true performances, not
lip-syncs. KaTe looked  beautiful, wearing a red, flowing dress to about
mid-calf. She had high heels (not  super high heels) on, and was wearing what
looked like a red orchid around her  throat. Her fingernails were red, and she
was wearing a very thin bracelet and  micro-earrings, barely noticeable. 
</P>
<P>There was no interview shown prior to 'Kite', or between the performances. 
KaTe began 'Kite' with her back turned to the audience (looked to be about 400
or  so to my eye). The band, about 20 feet behind her, were wearing
predominantly  white - bell bottoms, no less. This, I thought, was not her
finest performance, I'm  sorry to say. 'Kite', while not anywhere near being a
favorite KaTe song of mine, is  extremely difficult to get to sound right in a
live performance, IMHO, and she  shouldn't have tried.
</P>
<P>After 'Kite' was over, a backdrop featuring a wilderness scene - trees and a
 spewing volcano - was lowered in front of the band. KaTe went immediately to
the  front of the stage and sat down for WH. This performance was terrific, I
thought.  KaTe basically did the same dance as was in her original video of the
song, but she  had to hold the microphone, and that was a little clumsy for
KaTe.
</P>
<P>KaTe got a good round of applause after each song, but the audience was very
 still during the performances. After WH, Bio hugged KaTe and told her, &quot;Kate,
that  was great!&quot;  He told her to &quot;Remember, when you make it big -
and I know that  you will - to say you got your start here...&quot;  Bio tried
to get KaTe to repeat  something in German, she tried, but didn't quite get it
right. Bio plucked a rose  from a woman in the audience and presented it to
KaTe.

<P>[Wieland and Brett] 
</P>
<P>Kate or Cathy in the Glass in the vid: well that was my thought too, and
given the  context in which they begin, it works. OTH, I know nothing of the
movie that  inspired it either, so ??? My impression of Kate's lyrics and other
ideas is that it is  often made of motley (not an insult) in the sense that she
makes much of &quot;a little bit  here, and a little bit there&quot;. I suspect
from the disingenuous remarks she makes  about Love and Anger in the MTV Sensual
World interview that she is fairly aware  of her subject matter, and just as
aware that good art makes for interpretation, so  she seldom strays into the
explicitly literal. 
</P>
<P>Karen seems to have a good understanding of the layering technique of
threaded  symbols. It is a very good technique when what one wants to express is
deeply  personal and not up for public review. That's a tough line to walk for 
singer/songwriters. One can only write &quot;Love Me Do&quot; once, then one
finds that  journalism and short stories are the next logical step after the
surreal. I think that  the step from vids to movies was a bigger leap than could
be afforded. But as she has  said herself, &quot;writing songs is what's
important&quot; and what comes out of that  naturally leads to vids, which leads
to movies but she hasn't quite crossed that line  yet. She is learning a lot,
evidently. I do wish she would work more outside that cozy  world of hers,
though. It's warm by the hearth, but smoke gets in your eyes and  sleep comes
too early to the working girl.

<P>BTW, that interview is one of my favorites. She is a pleasant sort in jeans
and  little makeup, and she is quite attractive. That is the Kate that would be
fun to know  more about. Maybe we go too far with the Kate or Cathy bit. As I
said, for me its just  an attitude I take to keep some healthy respect for the
woman. It's a long way to  Welling from Huntsville, but hurt feelings travel
faster than tachyons (or would that  be slower...somebody dial Hawking's Chair
and ask).

<P>so much for shutting up. this list is such a temptation....

Subject: De la Tour in ASIL 
</P>
<P>About the ID of the Georges de la Tour painting in the ASIL section of
TLTCTC:  the image is a bit clearer in the laserdisk version. Even so, it took
IED quite some  time to identify the image, which reveals the way he likes to
spend his spare hours.
