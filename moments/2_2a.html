12:30:30 GMT <BR> Subject: Rubberband Girl single (UK) 
</P>
<P>..was released yesterday, if you didn't know. 
</P>
<P>CD single is EMI CDEM 280, I expect the cassingle and 7&quot; are TCEM 280
and  EMG 280 respectively, but I haven't checked. 
</P>
<P>Cover is the same photo I described from the MM ad. The inside has another 
photo (psychedelically solarised) from what looks like the video shoot - KaTe is
 wearing a straightjacket (!) and is being held by a small male dancer. There
are  some unidentifiable musicians in jeans in the background. The CD itself is
a  half-picture disc with the straightjacket photo in full colour on one half. 
Interestingly, the photos aren't by JCB, but by Guido Harari - somebody tell me 
where I've heard that name before? 
</P>
<P>Recording and mixing is by Del (groan 8-) - there seems to be a bit of
noticable  clipping at the peaks, drums could maybe be more emphatic. 
</P>
<P>The Extended Mix isn't particularly interesting - just the vanilla mix
juggled  around and with a bit of extra guitar and some bass drum. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; is a different kettle of fish. Very dark,
desolate mood, drum  machine + mournful violin (Nigel, maybe?) + very grungy
(probably not the right  word) guitar. Sparse vocals, heavy, obscure lyrics. The
cheesey pseudo-Amercian  accent kinda spoils it for me, though. Still doesn't
sound like KaTe's music to me  but at least it's reasonably wierd. 
</P>
<P>OK, so what does the Eat the Music single look like? 
</P>

</P>
<P>Hi all, 
</P>
<P>Well I've had my copy of RBG for 4 days now and (fortunately) had the chance
 to listen to it for all that time BEFORE I got back to read some gaffa this
morning. I  like to try and formulate my own ideas and feelings for music before
I let others  start to influence me. 
</P>
<P>Cover: 
</P>
<P>WOW, don't you just love it! When Stephen coined it the 'ninja KaTe' picture
I  had to agree with him. 
</P>
<P>Rubber Band Girl &amp; RBG (Extended): 
</P>
<P>To those who seem to be having second thought about this one I can only say
this.  Listen to it A LOT!! Listen to it LOUD!! I can just imagine KaTe in a
wild dance to  this one. It just contains so much energy. 
</P>
<P>Big Stripey Lie: 
</P>
<P>The KaTe I remember from TD and THoL. What a great song. It even has LOTS 
of KaTe screams (which I live for). I want MORE of this. 
</P>

<P>Date: Mon, 13-Sep-93 01:58:18 PDT <BR> From: briarpatch!billy@uunet.UU.NET
(Billy Green) <BR> Subject: New Singles--some thoughts 
</P>
<P>RUBBERBAND GIRL: I haven't see anyone else mention this yet--Kate's 
free-form vocalisation in the middle is very Middle Eastern, vertical music
sounding,  very like pop recordings I've heard from Islamic cultures. She starts
with a skat-like  &quot;ra-ba-da-ba&quot;, then holds and quavers the vowel
through the rest of the vocalisation.  It also has the sound of a vocalised
guitar solo. (Did I say something about blending  musicalities?) 
</P>
<P>The lyrics are about wishing to be more flexible. This one I can easily see
in the  context of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. Flexibility and rigidity
definitely play into that story. 
</P>
<P>It definitely has the same playful spirit that was present in &quot;The Big
Sky&quot;. For  example, the &quot;Here I go&quot;, followed by the rubbery
octave glissandos, proving that she  is a Rubberband Girl because her vocal
cords, at least, can be flexible. 
</P>
<P>BIG STRIPEY LIE: Take the pop-funk rhythm section from &quot;I'm Still
Waiting&quot;,  the violin overlay from &quot;Experiment IV&quot; and the
screaming from &quot;Get Out Of My  House&quot;. (BTW, did anyone ever notice
that the drum track for &quot;I'm Still Waiting&quot; is  almost identical to
Janet Jackson's &quot;Miss You Much&quot;? They are, in fact, almost the  same
speed. Try dancing to &quot;I'm Still Waiting&quot;, though. :-) 
</P>
<P>Very menacing and dark. A warning to someone to run away before getting 
trapped by the lie. 
</P>
<P>There is an interesting contradiction in the screamed lyrics. The scream is
very  growly and raspy, but it is saying, &quot;I want to help you/Never want to
hurt you/You  know I could be good for you.&quot; So, is this the Big Stripey
Lie? Given that the words  are words of comfort and soothing, yet they are
delivered with a growly scream, I  would think probably so. 
</P>

</P>
<P>IED agrees with Scott Telford that it sounds like Kate's own voice doing the
 &quot;male&quot; backing vocals on Rubberband Girl. 
</P>
<P>P.S.: IED has spotted the hidden KT sign, have you?

<P>Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1993 01:09:11 -0400 (EDT) <BR> From: Peter Byrne
Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: bass tracks for
EtM, RBG, and BSL 
</P>
<P>We also did some systematic earballing of the bass tracks for EtM, RBG, and
BSL  since one the particular virtues of my Shahinian Obelisk speakers (driven
at 600  watts/channel available power) is a notably dry, uncolored, but serious
bass. The  colors of the bass tracks on these songs are distinctively different.
EtM has the sound  of big stage speakers, some of that pushed-to-
the-limit-of-travel clipping that  makes for a 'live' sound--consistent with the
rest of the mix. RBG has a growling,  rough, orange-colored bass sound--heavy in
a completely different way. BSL has an  astonishingly intense, direct,
clear-to-the-bottom line, whose clarity of timbre plays a  major part in setting
up the violin of Nigel Kennedy to be so searingly  consoling/disconsolate at the
end. 
</P>
<P>This is going to be a messy album, people.

GMT <BR> Subject: New US single 
</P>
<P>I haven't seen anyone else mention it, so I will. The second U.S. single
from TRS  is now out your local store. 
</P>
<P>It's Rubberband Girl, RBG remix, Show a Little Devotion (or something like
that)  and Home for X-mas. 
</P>
<P>I didn't buy it because I was at a Musicland and they wanted $7.00 for it.
Is  &quot;Home for X-mas&quot; the traditional one we all grew up on or is it an
original with the  same name? Its good that at least this one has 2 new tracks.

<BR> Subject: December will be Magic (again!) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Show a Little Devotion&quot;: 
</P>
<P>Not a bad song, but certainly not one of Kate's better efforts. Sounds sort
of like  something you'd hear over the end credits for some mediocre film. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Home for Christmas&quot;: 
</P>
<P>This is a cute song! Putting aside any opinions about the aestetic value of
Kate's  post-HoL stuff, or the production work thereof, you have to admit that
the actual  task of playing the (non-synth) instruments is done staggeringly
well; that's where  Kate's reputation as a perfection remains inarguable (for
the record, *I* think,  IMNSHO, that the production &amp; aestetic values of TSW
&amp; TRS are perfect, too, with  a couple of exceptions I won't get into here).
ANYWAY, in this song it's NICE to  hear the acoustic guitar being played rather
badly. It's certainly the most HUMAN  song Kate's done since, oh, &quot;Under
the Ivy&quot;. (I'm not comparing the two - I'm just  saying that sometimes KATE
BUSH the Major Deity tends to overwhelm whatever  work I'm listening to of
hers). 
</P>
<P>Oh, for those keeping score, I STILL think the re-mix of Rubberband Girl is
the  second-best re-mix (next to The Big Sky) Kate's done. Actually, those and 
Cloudbusting are the only TOLERABLE re-mixes she's done.

<P>Hello--I'm kind of biased toward Rubberband Girl; it's my 2-yr-old
daughter's  favorite song (and her first CD), and we have a fun wobbly dance for
it...
