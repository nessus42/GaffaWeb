Promo Plans 
</P>
<P>The glossy flyers for The Red Shoes that have been mentioned are part of the
 marketing materials for TRS that were completed before the release date was 
pushed back. Also included in those materials was a two page flyer describing 
Columbia's plans for marketing TRS. 
</P>
<P>Here are some of the more interesting bits... 
</P>
<H3>Overview 
</H3>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>The building of her own studio and her no-tour policy only helped further 
enshroud Kate in mystery and privacy. But information on her recordings sped 
through an amazingly sophisticated network of fan clubs, fanzines and computer 
on-line networks. The legion of Kate's incredibly loyal and dedicated fans - the
 &quot;Love Hounds&quot; - will purchase any and all material on her, from books
to  photographs to overseas releases. 
</P>
<P>They also celebrate Katemas parties - yearly celebrations that take place on
 Kate's birthday - to talk about their favorite artist - Kate! ... 
</P>
<P>Kate is also making another first - a 60-minute film based on The Red Shoes
.  This film will contain six videos for the following songs: &quot;Eat the
Music,&quot; &quot;The Red  Shoes,&quot; &quot;And So Is Love,&quot; &quot;Lily,&quot;
&quot;Moments of Pleasure,&quot; and &quot;Rubberband Girl.&quot;  Again a first
- six fully-completed videos for album tracks done prior to the album's 
release! ... 
</P>
<H3>Retail 
</H3>
<P>The Alternative accounts will receive four-color advance flyers complete
with  in-store date and package art one month prior to the album's release. We
will also  plan listening parties for alternative accounts in all major markets.
... 
</P>
<H3>Midnight Madness Sale/ Film Screenings 
</H3>
<P>The idea here is simple - create monster anticipation for day one of this
release  by staging screenings of Kate's film in select markets. These
screenings will be  tied-in with local alternative radio stations, retail and
video outlets. The timing is as  follows: Alternative radio for &quot;Eat The
Music&quot; on September 7th. The Red Shoes will  be in stores on October 5th.
Alternative radio will be given the promotion in their  market and will announce
the film screening at a local theater and a midnight  madness sale at a local
record store. 
</P>
<H3>Promotional Visit 
</H3>
<P>We are hoping to have Kate in New York for two weeks sometime in September. 
</P>
<H3>Special Packaging 
</H3>
<P>A special, limited-edition digipak of The Red Shoes will be available 
simultaniously with the regular release. This special digipak will include extra
 photos, a sticker and four-color disc, as well as added bonus tracks - the
extended  mixes of both &quot;Eat the Music&quot; and &quot;Rubberband Girl.&quot;
... 
</P>
<H3>Press 
</H3>
<P>The first official word on The Red Shoes will be sent out via press release
at the  end of July. Advance music will be sent out to select, targeted music
publications,  critical press, and MTV News. Of course, word on this release has
already spread  and commitments are already in from the likes of Rolling Stone,
People, Mondo 2000,  Details, Harper's Bazaar, and Elle. 
</P>
<P>College Press: A press conference with 10-15 major college papers will take
place  during Kate's promotional visit to New York in September. 
</P>
<H3>Video 
</H3>
<P>The first clip serviced will be &quot;Eat the Music.&quot; Detailed video
promotions are still  under discussion. 
</P>
<H3>P.O.P. 
</H3>
<P>Advance four-color CD header card with in-store date. 2 x 3 artist blow-up. 
Double sided flat. 
</P>
<H3>Sales History 
</H3>
<P>Kate's last release, The Sensual World , has sold over 1.5 million copies 
worldwide, with domestic sales nearing Gold status. 
</P>
<H3>Selling Points 
</H3>
<P>o Kate is a world-renowned artist - known for her brilliant work and her
legions of  loyal fans. 
</P>
<P>o The Red Shoes is her most personal work to date, and features surprise
guest  artists. 
</P>
<P>o Since Kate releases a record every three years or so, the anticipation for
The Red  Shoes has already saturated the alternative world and beyond. The
so-called &quot;Kate  Network&quot; has been talking about this release all
summer. 
</P>
<P>o The film of this release, plus its six videos, will be a major tool in
marketing this  record. 
</P>
<P>o The special digipak will bring added attention at the retail level. The
quantities  won't last! 
</P>
<P>o Expect immediate action on all alternative fronts.

</P>
<P>Thanks, Richard Caldwell, for posting the press-kit text (or excerpts). Very
 interesting. For what it's worth, IED has been told by employees at no fewer
than  three stores in Manhattan that the album is being delayed until January
not only by  Sony but by EMI (UK) as well. One person claimed to have a friend
who works in  Sony's Alternative department (do they have such a department?)
who reported  that the reason for the delay was a last-minute decision to
coordinate the album's  release with the forthcoming movie, and to include
Kate's track &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; in  the movie itself. Of course, this is
all probably mere speculation, but if true, it might  mean not only a delay in
the album's release but some re-packaging of the product,  as well as
significantly altered (and increased?) though delayed publicity in the U.S.

<BR> Subject: Release Dates ? 
</P>
<P>Just to mention that according to (he thinks) New Musical Express (unless it
was  Melody Maker), Rubberband Girl was listed at no. 7 on their UK charts. IED
did not  understand whether this represented a rise from the previous week, or
whether  their rating system was very different from the UK polls cited in
Love-Hounds  heretofore; but in any case, no. 7 is not bad, is it? 
</P>
<P>What IS bad is all this uncertainty about the album's release date! Whatever
the  date is, you'd expect all offices of both record companies would know what
it is,  wouldn't you? He means, what if you were told that God was going to be 
descending from on high and had chosen your place to stop for a bite, wouldn't
you  want to get the date straight? Last summer the local McDonald's in Des
Moines  wanted to know exactly what the President's schedule was, so they could
be ready  with fresh fries and so forth. So here EMI and Sony have been
entrusted with the  release and promotion of a new album by THE GREATEST LIVING
ARTIST, and  they're like,

<P>&quot;Uh, wut? Kate who? Oh, yeah, somebody tol' me about her once...She's,

</P>
<P>Stefan complained that Kate's chart position is of no importance. IED
disagrees.  News that the first single release from the first KT album in four
years has sunk to  number 36 in three weeks -- this is bad news, but news worth
knowing. Not only  might her chart positions have potential influence on her own
decision whether to  tour or not (although that would appear to be a settled
issue now anyway), it could  also affect her EMI's promotional plans, the
media's plans to cover the album's  release, as well as Kate's own plans to make
herself available to the media. A  serious commercial flop in England could even
affect Columbia/Sony's plans for the  U.S. release -- for example, 
</P>
<P>It's already less likely that Sony will choose to release Rubberband Girl as
the  album's second single in the U.S. In fact, Sony might soon review all
follow-up plans  (assuming anyone in that company is at all aware of what
they're doing). Might they  opt instead for &quot;And So Is Love&quot;, which
(in IED's opinion) fits much more  comfortably into U.S. AOR formats than
Rubberband Girl? Or might they decide not  to release a second single at all,
and cut back severely on all their plans for a big  marketing blitz here in
November/December? As of the October 2nd edition of  Billboard Magazine, btw,
there was still no sign of ETM in the top 100 US singles  chart.

<BR> Subject: MisK. 
</P>
<P>Did anyone mention that a photo accompanying the Q Magazine review of TRS is
 new? It shows Kate sitting in a long pale-colored dress (b&amp;w photo), on
which is a  print (possibly hand-painted?) of the kind of fruits (sliced-open
pomegranates and  mangos, etc.) mentioned in ETM and photographed on the ETM
single cover. For the  record, Andy Gill's review is typically patronizing and
ignorant, despite being more  or less positive. 
</P>
<P> P.P.S.: IED saw (but was not allowed to keep, alas!) an updated version of
the  retailers' info-sheet about TRS. It was a tinted paper pamphlet which
repeated  virtually the entire original text verbatim, including the list of
magazines with  &quot;commitments&quot; to cover the album. The most significant
changes were: on the front,  the new release date is listed as &quot;Nov. 2/9,
1993&quot;; and inside, there is no longer any  mention of Kate's visiting the
U.S. for promotional purposes (let alone her visiting in  September!). 
</P>
<P> P.P.P.S.: The advertisement for the album in Q has a much sharper print of
the  album cover than has been seen heretofore. As Karen Newcombe suggested to
IED  earlier, it looks as though the KT sign appears twice on the cover... 
</P>
<P> P.P.P.P.S.: She is.

<P>By the way, the U.S. CD is available at Rebel Records in Manhattan as of
this  morning, and probably at Record Runner, as well. Both shops are in
Greenwich  Village. They were also making posters and badges available, and
Record Runner  was handing out extra CD-booklets (or posters, whatever). Both
shops were  recruited (as, apparently, were a great many shops throughout the
U.S.) by  Columbia to have a special Kate Bush Day, and were playing the album
from noon to  5 p.m., and were giving away the signed lithograph as a
door-prize. No sign of the  video-single here, however; nor any word on when the
long-form video would  become available, or the U.S. special-edition of the CD.

<P>Hiya, 
</P>
<P>Today I've got a letter from the Kate Bush Club. Basic info, nothing new: 
</P>
<P>- Release date of TRS Nov. 1st everywhere except US where it's Nov. 2nd.
Well,  I  got it on Oct. 28... 
</P>
<P>- The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve will be shown on November 13 at the
London   Film Festival. Lisa says it might be difficult to get tickets since
it's for  members of  the British Film Institute at first and only if tickets
are left  they'll go on sale.  Anyone got one? 
</P>
<P>- They hope that the video may be released before Christmas though this
isn't   definite yet. 
</P>
<P>- Next single MoP, should be released during second half of Nov. 
</P>
<P>- This letter is going out in SAE's (I was lucky, see below), Replacement
SAE's   should be marked SAE3 to avoid getting the same info again. Do only send
one   SAE each time if you don't want to get the same info twice. 
</P>
<P>- Kate has done interviews for the November issues of Q and Rolling Stone.
Anyone  found the Rolling Stone one? 
</P>
<P>Together with this letter I also got the money back I did send in to join
the club :-(.  Lisa says they are in the process of changing their membership
structure. She says I  will be informed when the album magazine is out.

<BR> Subject: Kates voice 
</P>
<P>Hey there... 
</P>
<P>About Kates voice: she once said in an interview back in 1985 on TV, I guess
it  was a Dutch programme else someone would have known it on this list, that
her  voice was lowering - then already! She said she was rather intruiged by the
idea that  her voice would be like some other female artist (I don't know
off-hand, it could be  Joni Mitchell or Janis Joplin, I'd have to watch the
recording if I have time),  lowering with each new album. So Kate is not really
bothered with her voice - why  are you all? 
</P>
<P>Finally, this discussion about the supposed original track order is, as
others have  already pointed out, rather stupid. The order of the song lyrics on
the lyric sheet is  &quot;jumbled&quot; simply because of lay-out problems. Try
to do this at home: fit 'The red  shoes' under 'Rubberband girl' and you'll see
it cannot be done. 'Top of the city'  would fit under 'And so is love', but then
'Why should I love you' couldn't have  fit anywhere. It's really simple! Why
else would the A-side be in the 'normal'  order? I mean really, this is getting
very ridiculous.

requested that. Les &amp; I  had cards for KaTe and I even had some hand-made

and took them. Hopefully they're in KaTe's  hands now....

</P>
<P>As others said, the windows were covered up last night at the CFNY studio in
 downtown Toronto. According to the people there this was a condition imposed by
 the record company. 
</P>
<P>I'm not sure whether it was the petition we signed outside, or a clever
trick by  CFNY to get around the record company rules, but Kate ripped down the
papers  herself near the end of the interview. 
</P>
<P>Then we all went a little bit crazy.

<BR> Subject: Paranormal 
</P>
<P>IED must agree with Rob Henderson, who asks for general tolerance (at the 
least) from skeptical Love-Hounds when the subjects of paganism and magic(K) 
arise. Whether sensible and level-headed or not, it is unquestionably relevant
to any  discussion of the new album, and IED for one would be grateful to learn
more about  it (he awaits Jason Pascucci's essay with great interest). Also,
Rob, you needn't feel  that Kate's position on the subject of the paranormal is
still politely neutral -- in one  of the most recent interviews she was asked
point-blank whether she believed in it,  and her one-word answer (obviously
designed to protect herself from ridicule by her  interviewer) was &quot;Yes.&quot;
It is therefore IED's great pleasure to be able to state  categorically that the
paranormal does indeed exist. QED. IED, too. 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick (IED) 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Would someone PLEASE reassure IED (and other Love-Hounds, too, no 
doubt) that SOMEONE managed to record Kate's appearance on Canadian 
television?? Also, could someone be helpful enough to transcribe and post both
the  Canadian radio interview and the television interview, so that those of us
to whom  Kate's opinions MATTER MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF can have the chance to
read  them? Thanks, folks.

<P>&gt;Does anyone know about the relationship between Kate and Joseph

know J.C.? Can  anyone enlighten me on this subject? Thank you. 
</P>
<P>Joseph Campbell has been dead for a while, so I kind of doubt if they have a
 close relationship. Kate could have been reading JC's works and may have been 
impressed enough to credit him (posthumously) on the album. Or this could be 
another person named Joseph Campbell.

<P>Hi there! 
</P>
<P>Well, this weekend I had a heart-warming Kate Experience that I swear is 
true... 
</P>
<P>I was checking out a new record store in the area (contrary to popular
belief, I  do NOT live in record stores! I live in bookstores, but take frequent
holidays into  record stores). I was in one corner of the store, when I saw two
girls, about ages 5  and 7, shuffling down the corrider chanting &quot;KateBushKateBushKateBush&quot;
like a  mantra being chanted on a sugar rush. A few minutes later, I saw the
elder one  holding up a copy of TRS, waving it at her Mom in that universal kid
way of saying  &quot;If you don't get this for me, my life will have no meaning!&quot;,
whining in that  irritating way that only little kids and Morrisey can do,
saying &quot;Buy this, Mommy!  Buy this, Mommy! Buy this, Mommy!&quot; Then the
Mom sighed in that universal Mom  way, saying, &quot;OK....&quot;

</P>
<P>Armin Michel wrote: 
</P>
<P>&gt; Where did you get the name of John GIDMAN? I own the German edition of 
TRS (Printed in UK) and the name of the bass player credited is John GIBLIN.
This  John Giblin also plays bass on... 
</P>
<P>Gidman was the name in an article recently posted to rec.music.gaffa, and is
 presumably a transcription error. To quote: [SOS-article] 
</P>
<P>&gt; One of the distinguishing aspects of tracks such as `Rubberband Girl'
and `Big  Stripey Lie' is the pumping five-string bass sound, courtesy of John
Gidman playing  in the recording area &lt;??Disparity Alert&gt;. His G&amp;K amp
was placed in the studio  kitchen (for separation from the drums) and miked with
an Electrovoice RE20. &quot;I  just wound it up so it was really distorted,&quot;
says Palmer, &quot;and used tons and tons of  compression so that is was really
pumping. Then again, the way he plays sounds  really good no matter what you do
to it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Evidently there are differences in the credits between the US and German/UK 
versions of TRS. In the US, D'Olivera is credited with bass on &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot; and  drums on &quot;Big Stripey Lie.&quot; The aforementioned
interview with Del implies that  John Gidman [Giblin] played *bass* on &quot;Big
Stripey Lie.&quot; The US CD credits Kate (I  believe) with bass as well as
guitar on &quot;Big Stripey Lie.&quot; I don't recall Giblin's name  being
listed *anywhere* on the US CD liners, but you are implying that he is  credited
on the German/UK version. Which song[s] is he credited for? &quot;The Red 
Shoes?&quot; Unless everyone is completely sick of this thread, perhaps a
comparison of  liner credits (if there really are any discrepancies) between UK,
German/UK, and  US versions could be posted. 
</P>
<P>In any case, D'Olivera remains a mystery man, so far as I know, and still a 
reasonable candidate for pseudonymity. May be Prince, may not be, may be a 
catch-all name for anybody who, for whatever reason, is not to be credited. I
listened  to &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; quite carefully last night, and as far
as I can tell, &quot;D'Olivera's&quot;  drums are a loop of no more than 4, and
maybe as few as 2 measures. Sound familiar  to anyone? To quote the article
again, re: &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;He'd looped a four-bar section from the chorus of the song that
Kate had  written and just smothered 48 tracks with everything you could
possible imagine:  Guitars, keyboards, drums, voices. I sat there and thought,
`Well, this is great, but  what are we going to do with it?' [...] Basically,
then, a case of pick `n' mix; &quot;Here  it is, take what you want&quot;? &quot;That's
exactly what it was. Because she'd said to him `I  want you to sing this bit
here and I want you to sing that bit there', and he'd sung  it, but he'd done it
over the loop that he made up. So, we had this piece of vocal that  she wanted
but it was everywhere, all the way through it, so we had to take the bit  that
we needed and put it in where we wanted it... 
</P>
<P>Plausible scenario: album is &quot;finished,&quot; Kate is fooling around
with guitar, hits on  inspiration for BSL (reportedly, it was recorded as a
last-minute &quot;stocking-stuffer&quot;,  and was recorded relatively quickly).
Del sets up a loop of Prince's drum part from  &quot;Why Should I Love You&quot;
(as also reported in the above-mentioned article, Prince's  drums were
eventually eliminated from the mix of WSILY), Kate jams, and voila! A  new song
is created!

<BR> Subject: Karen's party 
</P>
<P>Last night was Karen's wonderful party screening The Line, The Cross, &amp;
The  Curve. 
</P>
<P>It was a very small gathering - besides Karen &amp; myself, there was the
one and  only IED, as well as Lightning1 and Larry Hernandez (it struck me as
ironic that  everyone who was there were all also Bay Area Katefans on AOL.
Maybe I should  post it there, but I haven't got my new modem working (yet);
I've been having too  much fun with my new CD ROM drive. But I digress). 
</P>
<P>Anyway, as a stunning coincidence, that very morning I found a place having
a  sale on Fruitopia(!), so I bought two of everything. (Everyone generally
agreed that  it's STILL sugar water. But actually the Raspberry Lemonade is
pretty good,  IMHO). 
</P>
<P>While waiting for pizza, we sat around chatting about various Kate-related
(and  non-Kate related) things, and everyone was making fun of Chris'n'Vickie
(but I  wasn't supposed to tell you, so you didn't hear that from me, OK?) 
</P>
<P>One disspointment - I was going to take IED's photo to model the Lovehounds 
shirt, but he wore an elegent black Halloween Party shirt, so they took my
picture  instead. I'll post here after I've developed and scanned them (should
be later this  week), if anyone wants to post them somewhere so folks can
download and/or ftp  'em. 
</P>
<P>We then watched IED's copies of 8 of the Fruitopia ads. If you took out the 
goddamn type, they would actually be quite beautiful. However, on most of them,
if I  didn't know, I would never have guessed it was Kate doing the music. Karen
then  showed 5 of the ads (two which IED didn't have, including the one they did
for  movie theatres, which, not surprisingly was the best one). 
</P>
<P>Then, our feature presentation - TLTC&amp;TC. This is my third time seeing
it, and I  caught many things I didn't see the first two times - including an
actual, coherent  plot. (I think IED will post later, and will probably do a
better job at it than I could). 
</P>
<P>Finally, we ended the night watching &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot; (AKA &quot;Night
of the  Demon&quot;), the film where Kate got the sample &quot;It's in the
trees! It's coming!&quot; as well  as several visual images for the Hounds of
Love video, as well as a couple she used  for TLTC&amp;TC. Also, there was a
scene in there which was Stanley Kubrick  &quot;borrowed&quot; for &quot;The
Shining&quot; (which, in turn, Kate used as partial inspiration for  &quot;Get
Out of My House&quot;). Also, I finally now understand the line in the opening
song  of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, &quot;Dana Andrews as runes gave him the
 prunes/and passing them used lots of skill.&quot; Even the Kate Konnection
aside, this is  is a great film. (Then how come I never saw it before?) Stev0
sez: See it! 
</P>
<P>Actually, driving home was the highlight of the evening for me, 'cause NPR
was  playing a re-make of Orson Welle's &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, starring
Gates McFaddin,  Brent Spiner, Wil Wheaton(?), and Leonard Limoy(!). 
</P>

have done  to REALLY appeal to the Gen X crowd.

<P>IED cannot praise highly enough the latest issue of Homeground (No. 54,
Winter  '94). Congratulations to Peter FitzGerald-Morris, and to Krys and Dave,
for giving us  a new level of excellence to appreciate and aspire to. Not only
does this issue contain  several Kate Bush news bits that have not appeared in
Love-Hounds (no mean feat  that, in itself!), but there is an always interesting
(though by no means infallible!)  review of The Red Shoes album by
rec.music.gaffa's founder |&gt;oug /\lan, and an  absolutely fascinating and
beautifully written article from our own KLN (Karen  Newcombe) which offers
inspired insight into symbolism in &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;. As if  that
weren't enough, there are also several photographs of Kate Bush that have  never
(to IED's knowledge) appeared anywhere before.

<P>&lt; Why was Red Shoes recorded in Abbey Road studios, and not in her own?
She  stated in interviews that her own studio was one of the best decisions
she's ever  made - although one of the most expensive as well. 
</P>
<P>I think that only the orchestra sessions were done at AR because the
recording  room at her place is too small for big recordings. 
</P>
<P>In the past she has also used AR for the mastering stage (after mixing). She
 doesn't have the equipment for doing production mastering, especially the PQ 
coding for CD masters. The stuff she does have - DAT and CD-R recorders - are 
only for personal masters that she can listen to outside of her studio on a
regular  hi-fi.

18:11:37 -0500 <BR> Subject: Kate on MuchMusic
</P>
<P>Hi all! 
</P>
<P>Kate herself was there, got briefly up in front of the crowd (I was in the
second  row - even on stage she looked so tiny!) and thanked us all, then
retreated to the  back of the theatre as the film was shown. 
</P>
<P>It had been put about quietly that she would be giving an interview (the one
 mentioned above) at CFNY after the show, so en masse we went to their Bloor &amp;
 Bathurst St. studios (it's quite an affair, for those who aren't Torontonians,
a  street-level glassed in studio where they have quite a lot of celebrity
interviews and  the like...). 
</P>
<P>I can't tell you how disappointed we all were (there were about 150 of us 
gathered outside the studio) to arrive and find the windows had been *papered 
over* at the request of EMI Canada!!! And - guards had been stationed at the
door!!!  Can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>Despite this (you can bet if Nirvana or somebody like that was inside that 
papered-up studio there would have been a riot - but KB fans are so much better 
mannered...), we all remained calm, and took turns peering through a tiny rip in
 the paper (if you can believe it!) to get a glimpse of Kate, doing the
interview (which  was being piped out onto the street so we could hear her even
if we couldn't see  her...) - and smoking BTW... 
</P>
<P>After about 15 minutes of the interview, we managed to get a hurried
petition  signed by all the people present, and slipped it in to Kate via one of
the door guards  who also thought the paper was a bit stupid - and, at the next
commercial break,  KATE HERSELF CAME OVER AND RIPPED THE PAPER DOWN OFF THE 
WINDOWS! 
</P>
<P>Well, I can tell you, we all went quite mad with cheering and waving and all
that,  and she smiled quite beautifully at us, waved and then went back to the
interview.  She spent the rest of the time talking on the radio, smoking and
waving at us  making fools of ourselves outside the window. A friend of mine had
a video camera  and caught some great moments on tape. 
</P>
<P>In any case, it was a truly wonderful experience for me. This was my first
chance  to see the lady in person. She seemed quite down-to-earth, as she was
dressed in  jeans and sneakers and a black leather jacket. And that smile!!!
I've been a fan since  1982, and I've always thought that Kate had a warm smile
in the photos I've  collected, but to actually be in the way of one of those
grins is a totally different  thing, indeed. 
</P>
<P>Anyhow, just thought I'd put in my two cents about the interview. Despite
the  fact that the over-paid executives at EMI Canada made total idiots out of
themselves  (and I did hear quite a bit of flak on CFNY about the papered-up
window lunacy  over the next week), it was a truly memorable experience. 
</P>
<P>Best Regards, Steve.
