<BR> Subject: Mailbag 
</P>
<P>Andrea inquires of IED his reason for raising the subject of charter air
flights,  suggesting that he might have special knowledge of a tour. The answer
is no,  Andrea. IED read Peter's amazing HGFLASH, and assumed (rightly, as we
have  since learned) that Kate would not appear on British television to present
a track  from a forthcoming album if there were not a real plan to release that
album; and  that Kate might be planning to tour, too, as she had said she might,
back in 1990. IED  did not mean that a flight was planned in order to attend the
Aspel show appearance  (though it would probably be worth it). Special knowledge
of a tour? No. Faith that  something good is going to happen? Yes! 
</P>
<P>No, the list of guest musicians does not seem like &quot;too many stars&quot;!
This is Kate  Bush we're talking about here. Even on a clear night in Yosemite,
when the stars  seem to fill more space than seems possible, you can always spot
the North Star --  the added company makes it seem even brighter, if anything.
And when you wish  upon a star, your dreams come true... 
</P>
<P>IED thanks HOMEGROUND for their considerate timely postings of late, which 
he can confidently say have brightened the world of a great many people, not
just  the world of this grateful fan. Thanks, Peter. 
</P>
<P>Take care, everyone. IED will unfortunately soon be heading back into
computer  oblivion, there to remain until sometime after Katemas 1993. He will
continue to be  reachable here until June 18, and by phone, as of July 1, at
415/555-0683[vm]. And he will  find ways to keep abreast of philo-canine
KonversaTions in the meanwhile.

<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is a well-known SAD story about a ballet dancer.
Can't  remember the details of the story since its been years since I read it
except that it's  very very sad.  Like someone dies. Knowing Kate's love for
literature, maybe this  story is a basis for a song and the album title?

</P>
<P>If it's the same story I'm thinking of, the magic ballet slippers make the
dancer  dance until she dies. It's the sort of thing one reads to little girls
who want to  become ballet dancers; if they have the sort of temperment to
become ballet dancers  they will think that it's the most tragic and wonderful
story they have ever heard  and will devote their lives to ballet. If they are
sane they will be repulsed and forget  all about ballet and go back to playing
with their &quot;My Little Pony.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&gt;Knowing Kate's love for literature, maybe this story is a basis for a
song and the  album title? 
</P>
<P>Kate's really not a great reader. Her knowledge of the story is probably
based on  a specific movie. Most of her fiction-based songs are based on films
she has seen,  rather than the books. 
</P>
<P>Wuthering Heights was based on a TV movie, The Sensual World was based on a 
reading of Molly's speech by Siobhan MacKenna, Houdini was based on the movie 
with Tony Curtis (fictionalized ending), The Infant Kiss was based on the film
The  Innocents, 
</P>
<P>The only songs known to be based on books rather than movies are Get Out Of 
My House was inspired by The Shining, Cloudbusting by A Book Of Dreams. 
</P>
<P>Kate has other songs inspired by TV and Movies, Pull Out The Pin, Hammer 
Horror. She has said that she really doesn't read much fiction, and prefers 
non-fiction.

</P>
<P>I know The Red Shoes from a different angle. 
</P>
<P>One night on Entertainment Tonight, Leonard Maltin had a story on films that
 made great use of the old (as opposed to the current) Technicolor process. &quot;The
Red  Shoes,&quot; he reported, is considered the film that used the Technicolor
process to  greatest effect. I believe he said it was also available on
videocassette or videodisk (or  both). 
</P>
<P>BTW, the old Technicolor process created three negatives--red, green, and
blue.  [I believe these were created by shooting black &amp; white film through
red, green, and  blue filters in the camera] These three negatives were then
used to produce the  single distribution copy. This process results in a very
wide color range--rendering  accurately subtle pastels to bright, fully
saturated primaries [much like Kodachrome  slide film]. The first Technicolor
film was Gone With The Wind. In The Wizard of  Oz, Dorothy's shoes were changed
from silver (in the original script) to &quot;ruby&quot;  because the producer
[I think] said, &quot;If I'm paying for Technicolor, we're going to  use it!&quot;

</P>
<P>I started to transcribe the Hans Christan Andersen version of &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot;  but it's so moralistic I'm having second thoughts. A pretty girl
wears red shoes to  church, because they're beautiful, and is punished by being
unable to stop dancing  until her feet are cut off. She repents, the churchgoers
'forgive' her, and she dies  and goes to heaven. Happy ending! (ha!) 
</P>
<P>Compare this to &quot;Why should I whisper in church, because they say it's
sacred  ground? My sacrilege will do you good!&quot; 
</P>
<P>How does the movieplot compare? My Guide says it's a trite story of a dancer
 who's forced to sacrifice romance for art. Hardly seems connected. 
</P>
<P>If it's the HCA story, I hope she gives it a twist... 
</P>
<P>To me the news of Kate's TRS film is the most hopeful omen of sustained new 
inspiration. But when O when will it play in the USA????

</P>
<P>Actually, the three colors used in the three-color process were red, blue
and  YELLOW - the three basic colors. The other colors came from combinations of
the  three basics, i.e. blue + yellow = green. (Those art classes in second
grade finally  came in handy!) 
</P>
<P>&gt;The first Technicolor film was Gone With The Wind. 
</P>
<P>Watch Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (made a year  before GWTW)
and say that. :) The first film in &quot;true&quot; Technicolor was actually a 
cartoon, Walt Disney's FLOWERS AND TREES. The first film to be credited as a 
feature-length live-action motion picture in Technicolor is a 1935 movie called 
BECKY SHARP. 
</P>
<P>OBKate: This talk about the new album certainly displays the truth of that 
humourous statement of last week: &quot;Kate Fans Have Mass Orgasm.&quot; :) 
</P>
<P>And before we dismiss Jeff Beck, listen to his work on Roger Waters' superb 
album &quot;Amused To Death.&quot; Since Waters and Gilmour apparently can't be
in the  same room together, Waters turned to Beck for that Floydish sound. He
does a  terrific job on that guitar.

<P>&gt; someone sez technicolor negatives were red, YELLOW, and blue 
</P>
<P>No, I believe the original poster is correct, and the third color is in fact
green. 
</P>
<P>The primary colors of *pigment* are red, yellow, and blue, but the primary
colors  of *light* are red, green and blue. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is almost certainly referring to the fairy tale,
and not the wizard  of oz. If it were the latter, it would be &quot;The Ruby
Slippers&quot;. 
</P>
<P>There are a lot of different versions of the red shoes story. as i recall
all of them  involve vanity in one sort or another, or pride, and the punishment
is generally to be  danced to death by the shoes. 
</P>
<P>pretty grim, but very bushy stuff when you think about it.

<P>==== Aspel interview quotes ================ 
</P>
<P>Transcribed by Flump (D.M.Woodhead) 
</P>
<P>Q: What do you do, sit at a keyboard, or what? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yeah, a keyboard. And we tend to put stuff straight onto tape so I'm
actually  working onto tape and then I'll play the tape back, and, you know,
work to the  stuff that's on there, so... 
</P>
<P>Q: What about lyrics? Yours are very passionate and provocative, do you get 
inspiration anywhere? 
</P>
<P>KB: I think it is illusive stuff, but I think really the biggest inspiration
is people,  people are just so inspiring, they're fascinating and wonderful and,
I think that  nearly every idea that a person has had, has probably at some
point come from  another person. 
</P>
<P>[Question about the title &quot;Red Shoes&quot;] 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, it is very much connected with the film. I was lucky enough to
meet  Michael Powell, the director of The Red Shoes before he died and he was
such a  sweet man, he was really sweet, I thought one of Britain's best
directors and he  had a very strong effect on me, he was a very sweet man and he
seems to have  popped up in two or three of the songs that are on the album. 
</P>
<P>=== &quot;Red Shoes&quot; artistic sources ============= 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was a 1947 Technicolor classic by Michael Powell
and Emeric  Pressburger. The title refers to the title of a ballet
within-the-film, based on a Hans  Christian Andersen fairytale about a girl
punished for her vanity (in wearing red  shoes to church) by being unable to
stop dancing until she cuts her feet off, and dies.  In the film, this was made
a metaphor for sacrificing one's life to art. 
</P>
<P>Martin Scorsese counts it one of his favorite films, for one example. The
ballet is  beautifully danced and daringly filmed (ambitious-for-the-time
special effects).  Definitely recommended for serious Katewonks! 
</P>
<P>==== Kate and Prince controversy ============= 
</P>
<P>Andrea: &quot;I think it would be the ultimate mark of a good producer to be
able to  add one's talent without adding one's personal style to someone else's
work.  ...Prince's footprint on Kate's album will only be exactly where she
wanted it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>From Stev0 &quot;the scared&quot; Berlin: 
</P>
<P>What will happen when Kate collaborates with Eric Clapton and The Little Guy
 in Purple? Maaaybe something bad, Maaaybe something good...

<P>Hello Chaps, 
</P>
<P>Just a quick ammendment to the last flash: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Big Stripy Lie&quot;, the B-side of the first single &quot;Eat the
Music&quot; is in fact a track  from the album; 
</P>
<P>It looks like the first US single will in fact be &quot;Eat the Music&quot;
same as in the UK.

<BR> Subject: What a difference Kate makes... 
</P>
<P>Another thing that can put me into mode 3: New Kate! I can't tell the
source, but  we've actually heard 3 more new Kate songs! Tonight we heard: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eat The Music&quot; 
</P>
<P>(It is indeed salsa-ish, and I like it a lot. It will be great as a single
and I think the  video will be lots of fun.) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; 
</P>
<P>(This is the song that Prince is on, we're pretty sure. Think &quot;Ken&quot;
or &quot;I'm Still  Waiting&quot; and know that this belongs on the same shelf.
It's very understandable  why Sony wanted this song as the 1st single. I bet it
will be the 2nd. Kate fans with  heart conditions had better get their
nitroglycerine perscriptions re-filled.) 
</P>
<P>&quot;And So Is Love&quot; 
</P>
<P>(Beautiful!! Classic Kate ballad, except that it's bluesy and ballsy. Eric
Clapton's  guitar is on this one. Patented Eric Clapton.) 
</P>
<P>Apparently, these 4 songs (the 4th is &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;) were
very carefully  chosen to be presented to Sony here in America. They're
definitely  &quot;commercial&quot;-sounding, as commercial as Kate can sound.
Which is fine with me,  Kate needs a hit. Well, she doesn't &quot;need&quot; a
hit, but it would be nice. Why not? Hits  or not, I like them (and will almost
certainly come to love the ones I don't already)  and I'm very much looking
forward to the rest of the album. 
</P>
<P>I know that lots of gaffains will *hate* these songs, but I'm willing to be
suprised  :-/ :-)

-0500 (CDT) <BR> Subject: The Red Shoes FAQ #2 (w/much new info)   
</P>
<P>[Attention! This is Pre-History! There are several errors due to
misinterpretation  or lack of information! --WIE] 
</P>
<P>Title of forthcoming Kate Bush album: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (TRS or tRS) 
</P>
<P>Release date: Tues. Sept. 14, 1993 (simultaneous UK and US?) 
</P>
<P>Featuring: Dave Gilmour, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Prince (aka O{+&gt; )
[these four  guitarists get one track each-- Clapton's other three rumored
performances were  apparently replaced], Lenny Henry, and the Trio Bulgarka. 
</P>
<P>A forty-minute [?] video/film that Kate is making now, called &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot;,  should include 6 or 7 of the songs. 
</P>
<P>== Complete track list =================== 
</P>
<P>   </P>
<OL>
<LI>Rubber Band Girl     </LI>
<LI>And So Is Love     </LI>
<LI>Eat the Music     </LI>
<LI>Moments of Pleasure     </LI>
<LI>The Song of Solomon  	+     </LI>
<LI>Lilly   	|     </LI>
<LI>The Red Shoes  	|     </LI>
<LI>Top of the City   	| The &quot;Red Shoes&quot; sequence?     </LI>
<LI>Constellation of the Heart  	|     </LI>
<LI>Why Should I Love You 	|     </LI>
<LI>You're the One   	+
</LI></OL>
<P>All songs are reportedly credited to Kate alone, though various magazines
have  reported Prince wrote one track, and RBG certainly *sounds* like he could
have  written it. 
</P>
<P>== The first single ============== 
</P>
<P>The first single should be out August 16: &quot;Eat the Music&quot; backed
with a  non-album cut, &quot;Big Stripy Lie&quot;. 
</P>
<P>An extended version of EtM entitled &quot;The Madagascan Mix&quot; will be
available on  the 12&quot; picture disc and the CD single. 
</P>
<P>A plan to have the first US single be &quot;Rubber Band Girl&quot; was
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>Andrea's theory of the (puzzling) title &quot;BSL&quot;: Stripes are usually
used to draw  attention to something. Think of cross-walks. If we apply this
theory to a lie, then  we can (perhaps) safely assume that the lie referred to
here is &quot;obvious&quot;. 
</P>
<P>== Lyrics ====================== 
</P>
<P>1. Rubber Band Girl 
</P>
<P>(Featuring Prince on guitar and bv's) 
</P>
<P>[see <A HREF="2_1.html">Lyrics Section</A> --WIE]
</P>
<P>2. And So Is Love 
</P>
<P>[VERY low key song, Clapton on blues-guitar, and the same mournful
pipe-organ  voice as Rocketman?] 
</P>
<P>[see <A HREF="2_1.html">Lyrics Section</A> --WIE] 
</P>
<P>3. Eat the Music 
</P>
<P>[jungle sounds, then fast jangly strummed guitar, and *loud* bass,
eventually  trumpets and Caribbean bv's] 
</P>
<P>[see <A HREF="2_1.html">Lyrics Section</A> --WIE] 
</P>
<P>4. Moments of Pleasure 
</P>
<P>[Duration 5:16, piano and beautiful strings. 
</P>
<P>This may after all be the version used on TRS.]

<P>The case of George the Wide [of Judge the Wipe?] 
</P>
<P>On a balcony in New York <BR> It's just started to snow 	[Dec '78 SNL
appearance?] <BR> He meets us at the lift 	[Michael Powell???] <BR> And I can

really love me? <BR> Hey there Bill   	[Bill Duffield, lighting man, who died

</P>
<P>First listen: &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; performed on &quot;Aspel &amp;
Co&quot; 20th June 1993  (live show, lipsynched performance). 
</P>
<P>==== Aspel interview quotes ============ 
</P>
<P>Q:  What do you do, sit at a keyboard, or what? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yeah, a keyboard. And we tend to put stuff straight onto tape so I'm
actually  working onto tape and then I'll play the tape back, and, you know,
work to the  stuff that's on there, so... 
</P>
<P>[Question about the title &quot;Red Shoes&quot;] 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, it is very much connected with the film. I was lucky enough to
meet  Michael Powell, the director of The Red Shoes before he died and he was
such  a sweet man, he was really sweet, I thought one of Britain's best
directors and  he had a very strong effect on me, he was a very sweet man and he
seems to  have popped up in two or three of the songs that are on the album. 
</P>
<P>KB: &quot;I think I prob'ly am truly mad.&quot; 
</P>
<P>=== &quot;Red Shoes&quot; artistic sources ============ 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was a 1947 Technicolor classic by Michael Powell
and Emeric  Pressburger. The title refers to the title of a ballet
within-the-film, based on a Hans  Christian Andersen fairytale about a girl
punished for her vanity (in wearing red  shoes to church) by being unable to
stop dancing until she cuts her feet off, and dies.  In the film, this was made
a metaphor for choosing between devotion to art, and  devotion to love. 
</P>
<P>Martin Scorsese counts it one of his favorite films, for one example.
Definitely  recommended for serious Katewonks! 
</P>
<P>Other Michael Powell flicks: Black Narcissus, The 49th Parallel, Ill Met by 
Moonlight, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), One of Our Aircraft is 
Missing, Peeping Tom (1960 shocker, also with Moira Shearer), The Spy in Black, 
The Thief of Bagdad (1940 version) 
</P>
<P>== 1994: the year of red shoes? =============== 
</P>
<P>Apparently Disney is also doing a Red Shoes movie, and there's a Broadway 
musical planned by that name to open in January. 
</P>
<P>== Tour speculations ================== 
</P>
<P>Among the reasons to assume NO tour: 
</P>
<P>1) We get a movie instead 
</P>
<P>2) On Aspel, she was asked about touring, and said nothing hopeful, just: &quot;I
think it  was a bit rough for me being so exposed publicly, I found that a bit
rough. And  then I suppose I wanted to just retreat and work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>3) She *lipsynched* the Aspel show. 
</P>
<P>4) She reportedly turned down an offer to do MTV Unplugged.

<P>The new edition of &quot;Q&quot; magazine has a news item about the new
single (out of  date info: &quot;Eat the Music&quot; on Aug 16) with an
accompanying colour photo. It looks to  me like it's one from an album cover
shoot: full-length shot of KaTe in a black  ballerina-style dress and red ballet
shoes, with her hair up, against a grey fabric  background. Oddly, what appears
to be two extra arms (dark and muscular) are  visible behind KaTe, like a male
dancer about to lift her by the waist, but ther rest  of the dancer doesn't seem
to be visible...(must be a pretty small guy 8-)

<P>Seems like this could be a still from the promo film Kate has been shooting.
You  can see part of the other dancers head (the ear) as well as the bottom of
his legs - I  know Scott you could not take your eyes off Kate! Also, maybe he
is bending his  knees ready to lift Kate - either that or they got Ronnie
Corbett to dance! 
</P>
<P>I don't think the album cover will feature a full length shot of Kate. My
choice is  for a chocker close up of a pair of red shoes or is that too corny.

<P>Near the end of last night's &quot;Annie Nightingale Request Show&quot; on
BBC Radio 1 -  the (only?) superb show on 1FM, Annie announced: 
</P>
<P>Now, a record arrived at Radio 1 this week, and I thought: Wow, this is
exciting.  A CD, and it had Kate Bush &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; and I thought:
Um, that's exciting -  new Kate Bush record. I put it on; this is what
happened... 
</P>
<P>Female voice reading: 
</P>
<P>  &quot;She those trees bend in the wind. <BR> I feel they've got a lot
more sense than me. <BR> You see, I try to resist. <BR> A rubberband bouncing
back to life. <BR> A rubberband bend the beat. <BR> If I could learn to give
like a rubberband, <BR> I'd be back on my feet. <BR> The music comes later.&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;Annie N&quot; again: And that was it, the voice of Kate Bush, and it's
obviously a  collector's item and no, you can't have it. [It didn't sound much

on the  BBC Radio 1 breakfast show on Monday for a 30 min chat and played the
single.

<P>When asked about touring, she said she would not be touring this album. 
(AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!)

<P>The  single has also been played on the national commercial rock station

<P>  List Price: $5.95/$6.49

<P> Eat The Music is the first new music from Kate Bush in nearly four years.
It is  mearly a taste of what's to come: the album, her first in four years,
will be out on  October 6th. The title is &quot;THE RED SHOES&quot;. 
</P>
<P>This maxi-cassette and CD-5 contain the album version of Eat The Music , as 
</P>
<P>well as the 12&quot; version. Big Stripey Lie can also be found on the
upcoming album.  The special treat here is Kate's version of the classic Elton
John song Candle In The  Wind . This track has never before been released in
America. 
</P>
<P>----------------------
</P>
<P> This is poorly xeroxed onto pink paper. The single pic bag looks (it is
really hard  to tell) like Kate's hands holding a half of some sort of melon,
over a background of  half pieces of various fruits, papyia, peaches, pears,
plumbs...

a  cartwheel, in a dingy-looking studio, wearing some strange baggy dark grey
