(Miller, Ben) <BR> Subject: And So is Love releases 
</P>
<P>TheKBC-mailing also mentioned the fourth TRS single, And So Is Love which 
will be relased in two formats in early November. The CD will contain 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>ASiL,     </LI>
<LI>the US Mix (?) of Rubberband Girl     </LI>
<LI>and the 12&quot; version of Eat the Music.    </LI></UL>
<P>A deluxe version will come in a box and feature post cards, like those in
the MoP  single, I assume. There will also be a standard CD single version and a
7&quot; vinyl  version in a poster bag. 
</P>
<P>This is not going to be released in the US, so start hunting those import
shops.

<BR> Subject: ASIL UK update 
</P>
<P>I've managed to get hold of one of the limited edition 7&quot; discs in my
lunch hour.  These are actually numbered, although whether there are only 5000
is not certain.  My copy is numbered 0130 so as I've seen one as high as 3110
then maybe 5000-9999  would be an reasonable number. They were selling for 99
pence in the Virgin  Megastore and they had about 10 copies, I saw at least
another 15 between 2 HMV's  and 1 Spinadisc store. I reckon on 25-30 copies in
Coventry alone,so over the whole of  the UK maybe 5000 is too small a number to
be realistic. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, the poster comes in a 12&quot; sleeve which has a pocket to hold the
7&quot;  picture disc. The picture on the disc is the same as the sleeve for the
CD and cassette  single. The poster has photos on both sides,one side is the
same as the picture sleeve,  and the other is a new black and white photo, the
photos were taken by Anthony  Crickmay.

Newcombe&quot; &lt;kln@crl.com&gt; <BR> Subject: U.S. Versions 
</P>
<P>Dear jmalone, 
</P>
<P>The first time I heard those supposed &quot;U.S.&quot; versions was when I
bought the  ASIL single. Quite a surprise. 
</P>
<P>I wasn't even going to listen to them, assuming they were the same as the 
extended versions released here. RBG is definitely not. The ETM seems to have 
artfully pulled some of the vocals into the foreground and emphasized them, but
I  haven't gone back to the remix released in the U.S. to check it against this
version.

12:55:55 GMT <BR> Subject: Re: Please clear up the US/UK mix someone! 
</P>
<P>&gt; Can someone PLEASE explain what the And So Is Love CD5 extra tracks are
all  about? What does &quot;US Mixes&quot; mean? 
</P>
<P>The Eat the Music track is the extended mix from the US EtM single. 
</P>
<P>The Rubberband Girl track is the dance remix (can't remember the mixer's 
name) that was intended for release in the US - the one played at the
Convention, I  guess (most of us had gone for food by that time...)
