</P>
<P>I've just finished watching a taped episode of The Comic Strip Presents
which  was broadcast here a few days ago. Listening to the song over the closing
credits, I  thought &quot;that sounds like Kate&quot; ... and sure enough it
was. The episode was called  Wild Turkey. 
</P>
<P>I mention this because without having any of the KT reference files on hand
I'm  not sure if this is a known fact. I have the videotape here, so I guess I
could upload a  .wav file to some FTP site if it's of any interest. 
</P>
<P>The song didn't strike me as particularly memorable, but maybe I'll listen
to it  again just to be sure ...

</P>
<P>Yup! That's Home for Christmas which was just recently officially published
as a  b-side for (some of) the Moments of Pleasure singles and as a b-side of
the US  version of the Rubberband Girl single. 
</P>
<P>It's a known fact, though Home for Christmas is, especially before the 
publication on the singles, the less-talked-about and most-obscure Katesong
around. 
</P>
<P>It's a nice piece! (And the first Katesong that features an acoustic guitar
that  prominently)
