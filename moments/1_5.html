 be the biggest and best event to date. Apart from showing Kate's film, 'The
Line,  The Cross &amp; The Curve' the day will feature loads of rare video,
including a new  interview (filmed in Canada) in which Kate talks at length
about the film and the  album. There will also be a mastermind quiz that
everyone can take part in, live  music from fans and brand new merchandise that
will be available for the first time  at the convention. The convention will end
with the largest Kate inspired party/disco  ever held. Everything you need to
know about the day will be included with your  tickets.

<P>Date: 09 May 94 02:36:51 EDT <BR> From: Peter Manchester &lt;72020.366@CompuServe.COM&gt;
<BR> Subject: Convention! 
</P>
<P>The last bat just flew to roost in front of this morning's rising sun, and I
sit in  front of my host family's ACORN 3 RISC machine here in London, plugged
into my  CIS account, trying to use the COMPOSE editor in MAIL and clearly
having a  problem with it. 
</P>
<P>I took copious notes yesterday at the Convention, and will eventually have
time  this week to transcribe them with appropriate elaborations. but for now
just this  greeting and brief report. 
</P>
<P>Yes, she did appear. At about 7:45, the stage elevator hove her into view to
 introduce &quot;The Line, The Cross, &amp; The Curve.&quot; 
</P>
<P>First, however, there was some spillover business from the raffle. One last 
number needed to be drawn, for the Japanese Gold Record of &quot;Lionheart&quot;
I believe  it was, and some luckly lad Bill not only got to get up on stage with
Kate and shake  her hand he had the presence of mind to duck back one last time
for a quick kiss on  the cheek, which was returned, to the vicarious joy of
several hundred of us. 
</P>
<P>Quick survey of high points as seen from dawn the next morning, with a cup
of  coffee just barely beginning to set in: 
</P>
<P>Del Palmer's cool wit and splendid generosity during the auction, he and
Dave  from &quot;Homeground&quot; on stage together--pumping the bidding at some
points (for the  great cause of the Great Ormund Street Children's
Hospital)--breaking it off at  others to the benefit of some bidder who had
touched Del as deserving. 
</P>
<P>Paddy Bush on an unusual box guitar, singing a song that I took to be &quot;the
Rain&quot;  with transparent joy. 
</P>
<P>The Top Twenty All Time Homeground Kate Bush Favorites video compilation, 
as it moved up the Top Ten in particular--incorporating much rare TV appearance 
material. 
</P>
<P>The spectacularly entertaining Mike Winter dance group's interpretation of  &quot;Ken.&quot;

</P>
<P>This moment here: 
</P>
<P>Andy Marvick and I had set off from our perch on the steps of the downstairs
 seating, left center to the stage, to the third level where there was allegedly
food  service. It was during the first break, and we were in a bit of a rush. I
thought he  was right behind me, and having reached the food service window (and
realized  there was going to be no time to get any), I looked around for Andy
and he was  nowhere to be seen. I shortly found him on the stairs, holding the
arm crutches of a  largely lame young man who was slowly pulling his way up
using the guardrail.  Andy's spontaneous gesture of assistance had clearly been
proferred so quietly and  naturally that it was simply no big deal. 
</P>
<P>Well, enough for now. I need to pack and train up to Shropshire for the day.
It  will take me awhile to digest this, my first ever pilgrimage to see Kate in
person.  While I got no closer than to breathe air in the same space with her it
was worth it.  &quot;I hope to see you all again,&quot; she said. &quot;Say when
and we'll be there,&quot; I nearly  hollered. But we shall simply have to wait
and see.

</P>
<P>Not a bad day yesterday at the Convention! Music was good, Kate was there to
 introduce the film, Del was amusing, quiz was good etc. 
</P>
<P>The only negative points was the food situation, the hippodrome catered for
400  when they were told to cater for at least 1000!! The other point was the 
disorganisation of Love-hounds this time, after the last convention it was a
little  disappointing. I know that people congregated together but something
wasn't quite  there. In answer to Graham the same team won the quiz as last
time. The only  Love-hounds I really spoke to were Neil Calton and Stephen
Thomas. The film was  not bad really although Kate shouldn't give up the day
job!! Three new tracks were  played, (1) Cover version of Sexual Healing, (2)
The man I Love (the Larry Adler  thingy), (3) New remix of Rubberband girl.
Sorry this is short and confused but my  head is still spinning!

12:48:28 GMT <BR> Subject: Yet Another Convention Report 
</P>
<P>Certainly a day to remember! 
</P>
<P>From the top.... 
</P>
<P>At around 10:45 there were only around half-a-dozen people waiting outside
the  Hippodrome, include (as I later discovered) IED. The only other Love-Hound
I  found outside the Swiss Centre was David Smith and together with fellow
Edinburgh  fan Dmitri Ross, we joined the queue at about 11:20. A larger group
of Love-Hounds  (Geoff, Vickie, Uli, Kerry etc.) appeared in the queue behind
shortly afterwards.  Doors opened around 12:10. Most of the Love-Hounds
clustered loosely to the left of  the central aisle on the stools and steps down
to the floor - Andy, Neil and Steve:  where were you? Pity you missed us 8-( 
</P>
<P>Paddy was there performing material from his forthcoming album &quot;Skyscraping&quot;
 with Colin Lloyd-Tucker (also making an appearance) under the name &quot;Bushtucker&quot;
 (like it!), Del was there auctioning collectibles with Dave (a one-off signed
CD-R of  the album went for 600 pounds!), and of course Kate was there, but not
for long,  only to introduce the film and pick the gold disc raffle winner a
second time (it  wasn't deliberate that the first one picked was invalid, was
it? 8-) 
</P>
<P>The fans' performances ranged from an acoustic guitar adaptation of RutH 
(believe me!) to an almost a capella Big Sky with a two-chord electric guitar 
accompanyment by &quot;Loney Planet&quot;, to an excellent Wuthering Heights by &quot;Rare
 Flowers&quot;. The aircraft-carrier-style elevator built into the stage was
used extensively. 
</P>
<P>The &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; track Andy mentions is from a forthcoming
Davey Spillane  album - yes, there were Uillean pipe in the arrangement! The new
US dance mix of  Rubberband girl was brought along by Kate herself on a DAT,
apparently. Anybody  still around when it was played? 
</P>
<P>Despite at least four different Love-Hounds quiz teams, including a A-team
of  IED, Doug, Chris and Uli, the quiz was won by The Norfolk Alchemists team
again. 
</P>
<P>After going out to a nearby Chinese after the showing of TLTCTC (the video 
projector wasn't brilliant, but few are, I think), those of us who didn't have
tubes or  buses to catch returned, waving tickets at shouts of &quot;You can't
go in there, it's a  private party&quot;, around 10:30 and spent some time with
Peter before the Hippodrome  shut up shop for the night. IED and I also met one
of the Alchemists, who showed us  her prize shoebox. 
</P>
<P>And I still haven't mentioned the freebie free-for-alls (ouch!), the new
poster,  the ticket poll video top 20, the US Rubberband Girl video, The Pink
Mules... 
</P>
<P>All proceeds and profits were donated at Kate's request to Great Ormond
Street  Hospital in London. 
</P>
<P>Thanks to IED for the nametags and Chris for the rubberbands!

<P>Hello Friends, 
</P>
<P>As I sit here I have a great collection of Lovehounds standing behind me,
Andy  Marvick, Doug Alan , Mark Semich, Chris n' Vickie, Cherryl Aittama. They
have to  rush for a train so they can't add something to this message, but I
just want to say  the Convention went very well, and it was great to see all of
you. 
</P>
<P>Note from IED -- All of us here owe a huge debt of gratitude (if not loads
of KIT  KAT bars, etc.) to Peter and Krys and Dave of Homeground (and Lisa of
KBC) for  their amazing work. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;oug says 'Hi!' and we all have to run now, but thanks to everyone for a
great  KonvenTion (Vickie says 'everyone says hi!' - and we do) (Min -sorry I
couldn't  reach you, Brit Tel attacked me when I tried to use their phone from

</P>
<P>Sorry I didn't see any of you on Sunday. I heard an announcement for a meet
of  RMG bods but was embroiled in trying to grab Dave Cross for a word on the
subject  of food (the lack of). He didn't believe there was a problem, as they
had told the  management to expect 1000+ people and he couldn't relax the no
re-admission  condition. I have to admit that following this conversation, I and
an accomplice talked  a bouncer into letting us sneak out to a restaurant!
Sorry, Dave - Food is a  PRIORITY OVERRIDE condition!!! :-) 
</P>
<P>What else... Oh yes, I thought the &quot;Pink Mules&quot; thing was
marvellous. Very well  observed humour. I'm sure nobody would have been
offended. Come to think of it,  I probably enjoyed it more that TLTCATC!

<P>Sorry Peter, but this is a completely unfair remark. Dave had the
responsibility of  running the entire show. He could not simply break off what
he was doing at any  one point either to chat or to deal immediately with
something that had come up. He  pursued the food problem as soon as he could.
You should have seen him tear into  the Hippodrome manager when he showed little
interest in the problem. The  hippodrome were told to expect 1,000. Apparently
they chose only to cater for 400.  We'll probably chose only to pay half the
bill.

</P>
<P>[Fans-performances:]
</P>
<P>I thought Lonely Planet were excellent - they were technically very good and
 their interpretations of the KaTe songs they played were interesting. However,
Rare  Flowers were awful IMHO - almost all that accompaniment was programmed
(and  virtually identical to KaTe's original) and the singer went horribly out
of tune. They  might as well have mimed to KaTe's version. 
</P>
<P>[Love-Hounds quiz teams]
</P>
<P>Well, I argued in favour of either one mega Love-Hounds team or the sharing
of  knowledge between teams, which would have increased our chances of winning.
We  might have had the problem of distributing the prizes among 16 or so, but at
least  we'd have had the prizes. I can console myself with the thought that the 
Love-Hounds B Team (Alanna, Meredith, Mark and myself) did better than the A 
Team on the last question (name all KaTe's songs with &quot;love&quot; in the
title) - we got 5  compared to the A Team's 3.

Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: The Quiz 
</P>
<P>After two lovely days in Shropshire this week after the Convention, I have 
returned to the maelstrom of final exam week, and won't have a prayer of 
expanding my notes for a post before the weekend. As the day wore on Sunday, I 
found that the notes I was taking on a couple of sheets of paper in my pocket
were  becoming something like an Official Minutes for the love-hounds I was
seated  among, and I want to do them justice before very long. 
</P>
<P>Meantime, even if out of order, I feel duty bound to comment on points
arising in  the newsgroup. 
</P>
<P>[Quiz-questions:]
</P>
<P>I know *I* don't have a list of the questions! I was on the lh `B' team
(Meredith  Tarr, woj, Geoff Parks, me), and it was all we could do to come up
with preliminary  answers as Peter Fitzgerald-Morris read the 20 questions in a
stately but nevertheless  relentless way. Homeground will publish them, but
probably with the answers, and  Graham has a point in wishing to work on the
questions themselves. Here's a few  that I remember (they have to be asked quite
precisely--though none of them were  `trick' questions). General proviso:
answers should be as complete as possible ! 
</P>
<P>Q. Who directed the 1940 film that influenced the song &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;
and the  film &quot;The Line, the Curve, &amp; the Cross.&quot;? 
</P>
<P>Q. Name every Kate Bush song that has the English word `love' in its title. 
</P>
<P>Q. Which Kate Bush song includes the words, &quot;You know that I'll be
waiting&quot;? 
</P>
<P>Q. Who is the historical figure Kate has mentioned as contributing to the
theme of  the song, &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;? 
</P>
<P>Q. What Kate Bush song was inspired by a film by Ken Russell? 
</P>
<P>Those are just the ones that come to mind right away--but they give you a
flavor  for the event. Limit yourself to ten minutes, and with no opportunity to
consult  anything except your memory, and see how you do! 
</P>
<P>As to our being skunked again by The Norfolk Alchemists, Geoff Parks points 
out: [...  text deleted ...]
</P>
<P>I have to take the fall on this one. There were some 12 or 15 of us grouped 
together just to the left in front of the stage. About half an hour before the
Quiz  itself, answer sheets were distributed with the instructions that players
should  organize themselves into groups of 4, with each group taking a name that
they  would enter at the top of the sheet. We got ahold of a handful, and it is
an index to  the confusion of our discussion as to how we should arrange
ourselves that Geoff's  and my recollections of who were on the `Love-Hounds B'
team differ. 
</P>
<P>Geoff strongly urged that we form a Committee of the Whole, so to speak, but
I  was troubled by the fact that the instructions from the stage stipulated that
there  should be teams of four. If we won, suppose (and it was emphasized that
the  winning team would receive precisely four of the special shoebox editions
of TRS),  and 12-15 of us trekked up on stage together, I had a real concern
that it would look  like No Fair! and the love-hounds name would be disgraced.
We really milled  around for quite a while on this, with no real progress, until
finally Chris Williams  turned to me and asked for an ethical consultation. At
that point--and with time  becoming rather urgent--I proposed that we form
ourselves into teams of four, with  our `A team' being |&gt;oug, IED, Chris
Williams, and Uli. My view prevailed. 
</P>
<P>In retrospect, I still think I was right--though I was certainly undercut by
the  fact that the winning Norfolk Alchemists were six. That is still not 12 or
15, however,  and anyway, I think the bitter truth is that even if the whole
batch of us had been  one group, we wouldn't have done any better. Yes, the B
team got 5 song titles with  `love' in them, over the A team's 3: but the
correct answer is 7! NONE of us got the  name of the second director of &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot; after Michael Powell, though Andy  immediately realized that
there was a second credit and that his name was the key  to the question. 
</P>
<P>I don't know what the Norfolk Alchemist's secret is--they are six young
people,  mostly female, and they got 17 out of the 20 questions right-- but they
have beat us  love-hounds twice in a row now. Next time, I say take no
prisoners! Field a team of  4, 5, 6, but let's set up to draw from *our*
strengths. Delegate someone to write  down the questions (the fact that we were
not organized to do that was a major  planning flaw). And have two or three of
us bring *fast* laptops with things like The  Garden indexed for instant access.
Maybe (if another 4 years go by before a new  Konvention) the machine could
support a satellite connection from the floor to a  network gate and the whole
newsgroup could get online in support! 
</P>
<P>Anyway, to come back to the sad truth: we fielded our best this time, and
they  were in fine form too. Several of the questions were devious, but not in
any way  unfair. In fact, I have to say Peter F-M's quiz was very, very
skillful.

<P>Date: Thu, 12 May 1994 14:05:34 +0000 <BR> From: nbc@inf.rl.ac.uk <BR>
Subject: Convention Report 
</P>
<P>I will add my impressions of the Kate Convention last Sunday to those
already  posted. 
</P>
<P>Being a Sunday I was late to get up and spent the usual slow breakfast with
the  family. Hence, it was much later than I had planned before I left the house
and I did  not get to the Hippodrome until 1.30. I therefore missed the chance
to meet other  Lovehounds in the queue and the start of the programme. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, when I did get in they were in the middle of showing some video
clips.  In the darkness the place looked absolutely packed and when the lights
did come on  later I discovered it was indeed jam full. I think the venue must
have been smaller  than last year as the only space to move around seemed to be
right at the back  behind the bar. I looked around but could see no one I
recognised nor any banners  of posters suggesting there was a lovehounds
gathering. I began to despair of finding  anyone. 
</P>
<P>While it was not very busy I took time to visit the merchandise shop where
they  were selling Red Shoes t-shirts, poster and badges. There was also a &quot;fruit&quot;
t-shirt,  and the last 2 KBC mags on sale. Near the foyer they were also selling
copies of  Paddy Bush's new CD &quot;Skyscraping&quot; (which he and Andy Tucker
were lating  signing). 
</P>
<P>There then followed some more excellent selections of Kate video clips most
of  which I had never seen before and looked as though they were taken from a 
number of TV performances from various places. There were some spot prizes 
given to people whose ticket number was drawn out and could answer a simple 
question posed by Dave. Questions were: who played didgeridoo on The Dreaming; 
who produced The Kick Inside; what profession is Kate's father in; name one of 
Kate's brothers. Unfortunately, the main quiz later was a tad hardy than that. 
</P>
<P>During one of the spots for live music (others have described the acts)
there was  enough light for me to try and spot other lovehounds. From my vantage
point I  finally recognised the top of IED's head (sorry Andy but it stood out).
I could also  see a group of people with labels stuck to their chests. I assumed
this must be  lovehounds or a group of evacuees from Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>There then followed an announcement that the food had run out, and a bit
later  there was the first of the breaks from the Convention schedule. I took
this  opportunity to wander over and see who I could find. I said hello to IED
or at least I  tried. However, during the breaks they continued to play Kate
tracks extremely loud  so we had to communicate mostly by hand signals. This
would be my main gripe  about both this and the previous Convention. Much as I
love Kate's music it would  have been really nice to have a few moments of quiet
so a few of us could actually  have talked without shouting at each other. Maybe
then we would all have been able  to meet each other. 
</P>
<P>I managed to find Vickie who very kindly gave me a copy of a Happy Rhodes 
sampler tape (thanks Vickie - I have not had a chance to listen to it yet but
will get  back to you with impressions). Then I saw the &quot;legendary&quot; |&gt;oug
Allen and had a  short chat with him and Cherryl, and was able to say a brief
hello to Mark Semich. I  saw others around like Peter Manchester and Meredith
Tarr but did not have a  chance to speak to them as at that moment the
Homeground and KBC people  started to hand out freebies and there was a lot of
commotion down the front. They  were handing out old posters, flyers, magazines,
badges etc. So where were all the  other lovehounds - well I guess they I must
have been standing close to people like  David and Scott without knowing it. I
assumed the little group were all Americans. 
</P>
<P>Round about that time Andy Semple came over to say hi and to say he had met 
up with Steve Thomas and were positioned dead central. I then went off to buy 
some raffle tickets which were in aid of the Great Ormond Street children's 
hospital, hoping to emulate my success in winning a signed video last year.
After  that the programme resumed with a showing of the TV show Kate made for
the  BBC (the one featuring the duet with Peter Gabriel). 
</P>
<P>There was then a short break while they handed out forms for the quiz and 
asked people to get into teams. I tagged myself onto the team of Andy, Steve and
 Andy's friend from Coventry. Shortly after, Peter read out 20 questions. These
were  tough. Although, I got more than last year I was still hopeless compared
to Andy and  Steve. Even though there were a couple none of us could even guess
at I thought the  total effort was not bad. I cannot remember the questions now
but Homeground  promised to list them and the answers in the next issue. 
</P>
<P>There was then a run down of the Kate top 50 as voted for by people when 
writing in for their tickets. The top 20 were accompanied by a specially
constructed  video sequence. Again, Homeground promised to put the full list in
a future  magazine. Number 1 was Wuthering Heights. My no. 1 - Cloudbusting also
featured  highly, as did Eat the Music - much to Andy's surprise and my delight.

</P>
<P>Other people have mentioned &quot;The Red Mules&quot; - one of the massive
number of 3  videos that people had sent in. The other 2 were apparently too
serious to show at  the Convention. However, &quot;Mules&quot; - made by three
long standing KBC members was  an affectionate pastiche on Kate's Red Shoes
movie. Very funny - spoilt a bit by poor  sound quality. 
</P>
<P>Paddy Bush appeared and played several weird and wonderful instruments
before  being joined by his partner from BushTucker for a track from
Skyscraping. 
</P>
<P>There was then an auction of Kate goodies conducted by Del and Dave Cross.
The  stuff they had was amazingly rare and included a white label copy of The
Red Shoes,  CD-R's of some of the recent singles, and a CD-R of The Red Shoes
which had  slightly different levels on the master and slightly different art
work. The latter went  for 600 pounds as two people were bidding against each
other. Although most things  went for over 100 pounds, on reflection the prices
were much less than any dealer  would charge considering they were nearly all
unique. 
</P>
<P>The raffle winner was drawn but no one appeared to claim the prize which was
a  gold disc from Japan for Lionheart. Runners up got goodie bags filled with
photos,  singles etc. I don't think any lovehound won anything - unlike last
time where we  had two winners. The quiz prizes (red shoe box sets) were awarded
to the Norfolk  Alchemists (who alos won last time). 
</P>
<P>Del then introduced two new pieces of music - Sexual Healing from the Davy 
Spillane album, and The Man I Love from the Gershwin tribute album. Both very 
good. 
</P>
<P>There was a showing of a Canadian filmed interview with Kate talking mostly 
about the film and the album. It ended with a showing of the US video for 
Rubberband Girl. It ended with Kate appearing from beneath the floor on the
rising  stage platform. (Surely she should have come down from the sky!). She
looked rather  uncomfortable with about 1000 flashbulbs going off and had to
squint for most of the  time. She thanked everyone for coming and raising so
much money for charity.  Talked a bit about the film and asked people not to be
too harsh as it was her first  attempt. Told us she thought we were all
marvellous and thanked us for all the  letters of support etc. 
</P>
<P>She then drew another raffle winner as the first ticket was declared void, 
presented the prize and then disappeared to wherever godesses spend their
nights. 
</P>
<P>A showing of the film then followed but as I had already seen it at the film
 festival and my bum was aching and my tum was empty I decided to head for home 
since I had to get up early the next day for a meeting at work. 
</P>
<P>The programme had been so packed there had been no further chances to meet 
other Lovehounds. I probably have missed something important but I have gone on 
far too long and there will be other reports coming up I am sure. 
</P>
<P>So a good day - many thanks to Peter, Krys, Dave and Lisa for all the work
they  put in. My suggestion for next time is have a few more breaks and turn the
music  down real low so people can meet and talk.

<BR> Subject: Convention
</P>
<P>IED had a wonderful time in England and wants to thank again the Homeground 
crew for their stunning show of generosity and Kately spirits both during and
after  the convention. IED had an absolutely marvellous time at Homeground
Towers in  the company of Peter FitzGerald-Morris, Krystyna, Pami, Mark Semich,
Chris'n'  Williams and Vickie Mapes, |&gt;oug /\lan and Cheryl Aittima. IED was
permitted to  hold forth to his heart's content, with minimal ribbing from his
polite hosts and  friends, and what more could IED ask for? Anyway, he is quite
confident that |&gt;oug  will never show anyone that video record he made of the
occasion, so IED's  reputation is safe... 
</P>
<P>Love-Hounds was not particularly disorganized at the convention, as Andy
Semple  asserts -- there was a loud shout from our spot when our name was
mentioned by  Dave Cross on stage. Anyway, it's always embarrassingly easy to
find the American  contingent(s) at Kate Bush conventions. It's IED's suspicion
that a lot of the  philocanines who had earlier announced their intention to
attend, apparently didn't  make it. Too bad, they didn't get their nametags!
Many thanks to Peter Manchester  for keeping a detailed written record of the
event as it unfolded -- no easy feat  when sitting in near darkness among a
close press of Love-Hounds, all the while  braving powerful onslaughts of draft,
chill, and decibels. 
</P>
<P>In defense of Love-Hounds Team A, who did not meet their full potential
during  the convention quiz (er, a precise score is not available at this time,
sorry), Peter F-M  told IED that the quizmasters' express aim was to frame each
question so that it  would strongly suggest one answer while in fact requiring
another, much more  obscure one. IED agrees that it would have been better had
all Love-Hounds in  attendance pooled their intellectual resources for a common
goal. One unfortunate  result of combining IED with three equally well (or
indeed, far better) versed  afficionados of KTrivia was that the team wasted
many precious minutes considering  the wealth of subtle tricks which the
questions concealed, leaving insufficient time to  write out complete answers.
The suggestion was made and enthusiastically seconded  that next time (2008?
2019?) the Love-Hounds should set up a portable satellite link  and access the
vast philocanine database, also transmitting realtime minutes of the 
proceedings to all those unfortunately unable to attend in person. 
</P>
<P>It was wonderful to meet so many Love-Hounds and to see so many old friends.
 Let's hope we can all meet again sooner than is likely. Take care, everyone.

<P>Date: Fri, 13 May 1994 02:41:44 -0400 (EDT) <BR> From: Peter Byrne
Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: Convention
summary 
</P>
<P>The day's events began at 1:10 with TRS played loud, accompanied by flashing
 strobes and clouds of stage smoke. After the song, the lift in the center of
the stage  rose with Dave, Lisa, Peter, and Chris, who greeted us, announced
that Kate would  show up to introduce TLTC&amp;TC, and ran down some of the
countries from which  conventioners had come: Japan, Finland, Australia, Sweden,
France, Israel, Italy,  Canada, and last mentioned, the US--and in that
connection, a passing reference to  &quot;some love-hounds&quot; being in
attendance. It was announced that the profits for the  day would be for the
benefit of the Great Ormund Street Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>The first two videos were the trailer for TLTC&amp;TC, and a short
documentary on  the work of the Children's Hospital. (It was about at this point
that the group of us  sitting on the steps of the lower level, just left of
stage center and precisely at the  focal point of the ceiling speakers' midrange
horns and treble drivers, perceived that  the audio volume was not just loud but
punishing, and began scrabbling for wads of  paper to stuff in our ears. Kleenex
worked for me.) 
</P>
<P>Following those videos, the first live performance took place. This was an 
interpretive dance for MoP by Marcus Echo, from France. It was in a style
related to  Kate's choreography for &quot;The Man With the Child in his Eyes&quot;
and &quot;Moving&quot;: seated  on stage, at the entrance to a circle of
candles, composed mostly of arm and upper  body gestures. I found it teetering
between precious and very affecting, with the  latter prevailing in the end
because of the dancer's real attunement to the song. 
</P>
<P>This was followed by a 40 minute compilation of rare (some not so rare)
videos: a  lip-synch of HoL with Paddy and the band, at the end of which the
male  accompanist from Kate's video entered and the two of them danced as in the
video;  the &quot;Rocket Man&quot; b&amp;w video; &quot;Delius&quot;; what
looked like an early study for &quot;Don't  Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake&quot;
for the Tour; a &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; very much  like the Hammersmith show,
except with Kate lip-synching the vocal; a fascinating  live &quot;Room for the
Life&quot; from the camera that was following Kate at the  Hammersmith show,
using what looked like the big stage `egg' familiar from  &quot;Them Heavy
People,&quot; except seen from the other side, where it was lined with red 
satin, with Kate reclining in it as though in bed; &quot;Warm Room&quot; from
the same  camera, Kate at the piano; a totally great &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;;
&quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;  with Kate at the piano; &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;
from Die Eftelung video; an unfamiliar  &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot;
lip-synched with the whole band on a metal-framed stage;  &quot;Reaching Out&quot;
made into a video with clips from HoL, TD, TBS, L&amp;A, Babooshka,  SiG, TSW,
CB, EtM, WH, Breathing, and TGaT. 
</P>
<P>Live performances followed. My notes here, scribbled in the dark (or worse
than  dark; darkness interrupted by colored strobe) read &quot;Connai Ailey&quot;.
This was a  person who soloed with electric guitar, strumming the chords to Roy
Harper's  &quot;Another Day.&quot; That was it; just an `instrumental'. He did
follow the changes all the  way through, for what it's worth. 
</P>
<P>At 2:30 there came the first break. This is when Andy and I went searching
for  food, found ourselves stranded on the third level when the first boxes of
posters and  pamphlets from the KBC and HG treasuries were being spilled onstage
to the  groping fans below us. Andy saw something rare spilling out over to the
right: &quot;Oh,  that's really rare, that's worth something!&quot; he exclaimed
in dismay. &quot;It's not rare  any more,&quot; I pointed out to console him. 
</P>
<P>Soon intermission was over and live performances resumed with Glen Vickers 
doing RutH on guitar in a sort of a shuffle, and a second song that I didn't 
recognize. Del Palmer was spotted arriving backstage. This was followed with a &quot;by
 popular demand&quot; playing of the 1979 Christmas special (with Peter
Gabriel's &quot;Here  Comes the Flood&quot; edited out), during which Andy
caught some well-deserved Zs. 
</P>
<P>Live music returned with Phil and Barbie--&quot;Lonely Planet&quot;--doing
two songs; my  notes only record &quot;The Big Sky,&quot; with the comment &quot;phrasing
ok.&quot; Then the sheets  for the Quiz were distributed, and the love-hounds
group began the discussion about  how to organize themselves that I have
previously reported. While people were  organizing themselves into teams, the
very wicked and entertaining video by Paul  Thomas, &quot;The Pink Mules,&quot;
was perpetrated. This was followed by one of the high  points for me, the Mike
Winter Group dance interpretation of &quot;Ken&quot;: 2 men, 4  women, in unisex
business dress, performing with wit, energy, and precision. 
</P>
<P>There was a short lull. Then the Top Forty from the Homeground poll of 
Convention ticket buyers, each of whom were asked to name their top ten all time
 favorate KB tunes, was announced. Numbers 40-21 were read out, but for the Top
20,  a compilation video was played, with each song getting more and more
complete play  as we approached Number One. This was EXTREMELY well done, with
lots of very  rare material from TV appearances used to supplement the official
videos of songs  that had videos in the first place. I took down the Top Twenty
list, but Peter F-M  specifically said &quot;don't bother making notes, this
list will be published in  Homeground,&quot; and I regard myself as justly
placed on notice and won't transcribe it.  Suffice to say that, considering just
the Top Ten, 4 come from HoL, and 2 each from  TKI, TSW, and TRS. 
</P>
<P>Somewhere in here the actual Quiz was administered; perhaps right after the 
countdown? Anyway, the next Event was the appearance of Paddy Bush about 5:50, 
raised up by the center stage lift, playing a soulful line on a huge wooden 
recorder-like instrument that must have been ten feet tall. He set that aside,
took up  a rectangular guitar that someone said was Madagaskar and sang &quot;The
Rain,&quot;  communicating a joy that gave me deep insight into where Kate Bush
isoming from.  He was then joined by Colin Lloyd Tucker of Skyscraping, singing
a song whose real  title I have not looked up yet, but which I noted down as &quot;We're
the Scribblers.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They were followed by &quot;Rare Flowers,&quot; two young women, one on
electronic  keyboard, the other the singer. They first did &quot;The Red Shoes.&quot;
IED, who had not  heretofore manifested himself, materialized and wrote on my
note sheet &quot;I CAN'T  BELIEVE THIS IS REALLY HAPPENIN' TO US!&quot; I
concur. It was amazing. They  followed with &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; which
was fresh in our ears because of its--let  me say `prominent'--place in the Top
Twenty countdown. I shall say that this was  ill-advised, and leave it at that.

</P>
<P>Another intermission followed, after which Del Palmer joined Dave onstage
for  the auction. I have already commented on the very humane conduct of this
event, to  which Del contributed so much with his composure and warm
intelligence. For the  record: [in GBP]

<P>This last was the single most likely of all the items auctioned to acquire a
 collector's item value far beyond its auctioned price. It was a real gift for
Del to give  it over for the auction, and an even greater generosity for him to
let it go for the bid  that was accepted. 
</P>
<P>The results of the Quiz were then announced, with the now well known fact
that  the Norfolk Alchemists won, with no other team even in sight in the
running. 
</P>
<P>There followed playings of two new KB contributions: her vocal for &quot;Sexual
 Healing&quot; from the forthcoming Davy Spillane album (sorry, but as this was
playing I  found myself commenting &quot;this is so lame!&quot;); and her
contribution to the Gershwin  album, &quot;The Man I Love,&quot; which I found
totally compelling. Together with &quot;Home  for Christmas,&quot; this latest
effort by Kate in a 40s mode strikes me as SO successful  that I would urge her
to take the hint and do a whole album of Big Band Era covers.  Sinead was not up
to it; Kate is. 
</P>
<P>There followed the full unedited tape of an interview Kate did for Canadian
TV,  where the interviewer was a little inarticulate but Kate gave him the
benefit of the  doubt and had more to say than in any of the other interviews
I've read from the  TRS release promo appearances. It ended with the video for
RBG, during which  Hippodrome security people unobstrusively took up positions
around the stage. 
</P>
<P>When the video ended, at about 7:38pm, the riser in the center of the stage
lifted  Kate Bush herself into our view, and All Rose. As mentioned, Kate drew
one last  raffle ticket, spoke of how happy she was to see us all, hoped we
would like the  film, looked forward to seeing us again. 
</P>
<P>The film then played, and with that the formal program ended. Comment on the
 film is a thread of its own, to which I will not now contribute. 
</P>
<P>I will say this. At one point when she was there among us, Kate said
something to  the effect that she had not yet recovered from the urgency and
effort of completing  &quot;The Line, the Cross, &amp; the Curve&quot; six
months ago. I very much agree with the  comments (I am not in an editor now
where I can dig up and credit the author) that  it is too bad that she didn't
throw herself with the same abandon into &quot;The Ninth  Wave,&quot; which
really was a coherent concept grouping of songs. But focusing just on  her
effort this past fall-- to get herself again into dancing shape, to deal with 
practical emergencies involving timeframes and budgets--I was deeply touched by 
her willingness to come out and appear for us at this Convention. I registered
Kate  as deeply desiring to back away from her public career right now. She was
far  enough from fighting trim that it must have been a big concession for her
to appear  for us. She wore the manish tuxedo she has used a lot recently, with
its ample  trousers and draping jacket, and used no artifices to hide from the
unforgiving stage  light her coming up on 36 as a woman who likes her smoke and
chocolate. Perhaps  there is even more going on for her than we are aware of. 
</P>
<P>We love this woman for her work, and she extends herself to meet us. This is
all  very rare and wonderful, so let us prize the friendships that we make
around her.

Subject: The Quiz - Who directed The Red Shoes 
</P>
<P>From: Peter Byrne Manchester, Subject: The Quiz 
</P>
<P>&gt; NONE of us got the name of the second director of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;
after  Michael Powell, though Andy immediately realized that there was a second
credit  and that his name was the key to the question. 
</P>
<P>Actually, the correct answer WAS Michael Powell - I believe Peter F-M was 
wrong. It is true that the credits of Powell and Pressburger's films always said
 &quot;Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&quot;.
 However, Michael Powell was the director and Emeric Pressburger was the writer.
 When the question was read out my initial reaction was to tell Andy Semple to
write  down both names but then I said no because Pressburger did not direct (he
only  directed films after he split from Powell). 
</P>
<P>[Peter F-M - can I have a consolation prize :-) ] 
</P>
<P>&gt; I don't know what the Norfolk Alchemist's secret is--they are six young
 people, mostly female, and they got 17 out of the 20 questions right. 
</P>
<P>Well they were saying that it was one of their female members who was the 
principal expert. 
</P>
<P>I did half-heartedly think of loading The Garden etc. onto my Powerbook, but
I  was not sure they would let me in with it. Anyway, given the length of time
available  to answer the questions it would have been hard to do all the
look-ups. There is no  substitute for actually knowing the answers. Also, I
think there would have been  something not quite right (not cricket you know
:-)) about winning thanks to  technology. The Alchemists won fair and square.

even  if I had thought of scribbling down the happenings, I doubt I would get

didn't express the  senitment of the lyrics; his habit of mouthing the words
also detracted from the  performance. however, in the last part of the
performance, he picked up a candle  everytime KaTe mentioned a name and
extinguished the flame when he put it back  down. as peter said, this was
particularly affecting. 
</P>
<P>&gt; This was followed by a 40 minute compilation of rare (some not so rare)
videos:  [...] a fascinating live &quot;Room for the Life&quot; from the camera
that was following Kate  at the Hammersmith show, using what looked like the big
stage `egg' familiar from  &quot;Them Heavy People,&quot; except seen from the
other side, where it was lined with red  satin, with Kate reclining in it as
though in bed; 
</P>
<P>or as though a womb. as ied and I discussed afterwards, this (or a similar
video)  has made an appearance in the &quot;live in germany&quot; video clips.
ied felt that this was a  different clip but I think that it is identical to the
one that I have. I haven't had a  chance to go back and compare though. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Live music returned with Phil and Barbie--&quot;Lonely Planet&quot;--doing
two songs;  my notes only record &quot;The Big Sky,&quot; with the comment &quot;phrasing
ok.&quot; 
</P>
<P>i was very impressed with lonely planet. the arrangement of their covers
were  strikingly different from the originals even when you accounted for only
one electric  guitar providing the instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>&gt; There was a short lull. Then the Top Forty from the Homeground poll of 
Convention ticket buyers, each of whom were asked to name their top ten all time
 favorate KB tunes, was announced. [...] Suffice to say that, considering just
the Top  Ten, 4 come from HoL, and 2 each from TKI, TSW, and TRS. 
</P>
<P>what I found interesting was that the top five were all *singles*. granted,
this can  be understood but I was disappointed that there were not more album
tracks up  there in the stellar reaches of the top ten. 
</P>
<P>&gt;Anyway, the next Event was the appearance of Paddy Bush about 5:50,
raised up  by the center stage lift, playing a soulful line on a huge wooden
recorder-like  instrument that must have been ten feet tall. He set that aside,
took up a rectangular  guitar that someone said was Madagaskar and sang &quot;The
Rain,&quot; communicating a joy  that gave me deep insight into where Kate Bush
isoming from. 
</P>
<P>i'm fairly certain that the guitar that pad was playing was a kabossy which 
erudite love-hounds will recognize as being a key instrument in &quot;eat the
music.&quot; the  tune that he played thereon had many similarities to &quot;the
red shoes&quot; and almost  seemed to be an inspiration for that song. dunno
exactly what the woodwind  instrument he played is though; it had the appearance
of a primitive bassoon and did  not sound unlike that either. 
</P>
<P>&gt; There followed the full unedited tape of an interview Kate did for
Canadian  TV, where the interviewer was a little inarticulate but Kate gave him
the benefit of  the doubt and had more to say than in any of the other
interviews I've read from  the TRS release promo appearances. 
</P>
<P>you'll note that this interview was conducted by someone from musique plus, 
quebec's version of much music. I think that explains why his english wasn't
exactly  perfect. surprisingly, this seemed to help the interview more than not
as some of his  questions, if phrased by a native english-speaker, might not
have yielded the same  answers.

(chris williams) <BR> Subject: *Actual* Konvention thoughts... 
</P>
<P>Chris here, answering a bunch of various posts... 
</P>
<P>Dr G.T. Parks replies to Scott Telford: 
</P>
<P>&gt; I thought Lonely Planet were excellent - they were technically very
good and  their interpretations of the KaTe songs they played were interesting.
However, Rare  Flowers were awful IMHO - almost all that accompaniment was
programmed (and  virtually identical to KaTe's original) and the singer went
horribly out of tune. They  might as well have mimed to KaTe's version. 
</P>
<P>I was hiding on the floor trying to shield myself with the people in front
of me.  My reaction was &quot;I thought *I* was a nervy bastard!&quot; Wuthering
Heights is one of  the most difficult to sing songs ever written, right up there
with Shadowlands and  The Star Spangled Banner. The dance troupe doing Ken was
great. 
</P>
<P>Peter Byrne Manchester: 
</P>
<P>&gt; NONE of us got the name of the second director of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;
after  Michael Powell, though Andy immediately realized that there was a second
credit  and that his name was the key to the question. 
</P>
<P>The second director was the screenwriter and was credited as co-director.
Andy  did have his last name right, but had Irwin rather than his correct name
(not  mentioned for those playing along at home.) 
</P>
<P>&gt;I don't know what the Norfolk Alchemist's secret is--they are six young
people,  mostly female, and they got 17 out of the 20 questions right. 
</P>
<P>Actually I want upstairs and *found* the leader of the Norfolk Alchemists, a
 slight, pretty, red-haired English girl named Amanda Greenaway. On behalf of 
Love-hounds I offered our congratulations. In truth, she was the entire team.
The  rest of her team wrote the questions down, scribbled the quick answers and 
produced a clean copy. I brought her downstairs to meet the Love-Hounds, 
particularly an awed Andy Marvick. She offered to not enter next time, but we 
urged her to please compete, that we would try to do better and needed the 
competition. We asked *how* she did it, and she said that she really didn't
know,  but she did own to a really good memory that could be considered &quot;photographic.&quot;
If  we *really* want to win ... all we have to do is give her a computer and an
account  and make her a love-hound! 
</P>
<P>&gt; Several of the questions were devious, but not in any way unfair. In
fact, I have  to say Peter F-M's quiz was very, very skillful. 
</P>
<P>Great questions, better than last time. One of the nasty ones was the same
as last  time (the complete name of Kate's Roy Harper duet You .) The main one
that no  one got last time was a bit UK-centric, about some public event that
Kate as  supposed to appear at, but didn't. 
</P>
<P>Actually we don't need a laptop. A complete copy of all of Kate's lyrics,
credits  (Who did the Shoedance mix? No, &quot;some cretin&quot; is *not* a
complete answer) and a  special list of &quot;IAQs&quot; (Infrequently Asked
Questions.) If someone had brought all the  CDs we would have gotten another two
questions right. 
</P>
<P>One thing to remember though - the quizmaster is reading this... 
</P>
<P>Oh well. We did need a scribe. One other thing, we handed our sheet in *far*
too  soon. If we had known that we could have spent almost another twenty
minutes  pondering I'm sure that we could have won, especially as we came up
with at least  two more &quot;love&quot; songs, one other correct answer and
realized that we had written  one question down wrong. Hell, I had the correct
answer to the name of the  co-director of The Red Shoes in my possession. This
month's issue of Empire  magazine had reviews of books about the co-director of
The Red Shoes in a bag!

</P>
<P>Thanks and thanks again to Peter, Krys, Dave Cross and all the Homeground 
KBC crew who made the KonvenTion so *SO* wonderful! Also thanks to Peter &amp; 
Krys for hosting a warm, friendly and interesting gathering at their home on 
Tuesday. Last, but not least, thanks to Geoff Parks for hosting the party in 
Cambridge on Saturday. You all made it one of the best weeks of our lives.
You're all  very wonderful! It was a special pleasure to meet all the
Love-Hounds I did, and my  regrets to those of you I didn't meet. It was all
fun, but chaotic. 
</P>
<P>If anyone is curious, Chris and I did make it to the showing of TLTCTC at
Lee  Valley on Friday night and it was wonderful to see the film, and quite a
few other  Kate videos on the big theater screen. One of the most interesting
things we noticed  was that RUTH had a different ending from the one we've
always seen before.  Instead of the panning &quot;arrow&quot; shots, the video
ended with Kate and the other  dancer (blanking on his name) rolling together on
the floor. It's the first we knew  about there being a different ending for that
video. It's unfortunate, but there were  only 9 people total in the 230-seat
theater. At the KonvenTion, I chatted with Del  Palmer about the film, and he
seemed to think that it might very well be released  on video in America, though
I won't count on it until it's actually in my hands.  We'll order a PAL copy
when it comes out in the UK.

strictness of  marking, so we were still miles behind the winners even if we did
get 14 or 15.

<P>Regarding my earlier comments of the disorgansation of Love-Hounds, the 
loudness of the music made it virtually impossible to communicate, this didn't

</P>
<P>KTrivia: IED is greatly impressed at the feat of memory performed by 
Love-Hounds who reproduced so nearly completely the list of 20 questions asked
by  Peter FitzGerald-Morris at the Convention. He feels compelled to correct one
detail  of which he is aware: in question no. 9, the name of the song on which
one of Kate's  songs is based is &quot;Sovay , Sovay&quot;, not &quot;Cerve,
Cerve&quot; or variants thereof. IED believes  that &quot;Sovay, Sovay&quot; is
a traditional Irish ballad, but he won't say any more about it, as  that might
give away the answer to the question... 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick (IED)
</P>
<P>Other Irish songs Kate fans may want to track down: &quot;O Waly Waly&quot;
(sp.?), &quot;She  Mov'd Thro' the Fair&quot;, and &quot;The Twa Magicians&quot;
-- no doubt there are many other  relevant folksongs, as well.

<BR> Subject: Convention 
</P>
<P>&gt; Arrgghh! You met Del! Don't suppose he gave any hints on the current
status of  his relationship with Kate? (he asks pruriently 8-) 
</P>
<P>:-) Nah, I didn't ask him. We talked a bit about Happy Rhodes (she had just
been  played on the main sound system, and I gave him a sampler tape) and about
the film.  I told him that we had seen it in the theater, told him how much we
enjoyed it and  how sorry we were that there were only 9 people there. I also
told him that all the  ticket stubs said &quot;The Lion, The Cross, and The
Curve&quot; :-) and asked about a general  or limited theater release in America
(besides the showings that have been held  already) and he said the chances were
practically nil, but that there was no worry,  because it was soon to be
released on video. In America? I asked. I believe he said  &quot;very likely&quot;
though my brain was addled and I don't want to put direct quotes into  his
mouth. 
</P>
<P>Del was very, very friendly and was in a place where anyone could go up and 
talk to him. I think he really likes the interaction with the fans. He told me
that he  likes going to these gatherings because he meets so many people and
sees so many  familiar faces. 
</P>
<P>I spent more time running around the parameters meeting and talking to
people  than I did watching the stage. As a result, I missed most of the live
performances  and the quiz, and much of the auction, but I met and talked to
Del, Lisa (from the  KBC), Debi Bowes (the wonderful artist who contributes to
Homeground and to  Take To The Sky, the UK Tori fanzine), all the Take To The
Sky folks (what a  *gorgeous* fanzine!), not to mention Peter, Krys, Dave Cross,
Pami and lots of other  wonderful people. I was able to hang around other
Love-Hounders who couldn't  make it down to where all the other LHers were, such
as Steve Fagg, Stephen  Thomas, Alanna (who did get her Kool-Aid &amp; Cap't
Crunch, though we forgot  grape) and probably others that I'm sorry I'm
forgetting. 
</P>
<P>I avidly watched all the rare video stuff, including the Top 20 countdown,
the  Canadian interview and most of TLTCTC. I found a great place to watch the
stuff I  wanted to watch. It was an area behind the stage that was open, but
practically  empty. Most people thought the &quot;place to be&quot; was in front
of the stage, but the cool  thing was that you could see the video just as well,
and far more comfortably, behind  the screen. The video was reversed, but it
hardly mattered, really. It still *looked*  better, because all the ambient
light was in front of the stage. The extra darkness  from behind made the images
sharper and clearer. Chris and I watched most of  TLTCTC from back there,
stretched out. I had to bring Chris back there to show  him how nice it was. I
don't know if anyone else would have come if I'd tried to  explain it. &quot;What??
Behind the screen? Are you crazy?&quot; :-) 
</P>
<P>(CYA time) 
</P>
<P>Just so it's clear, the area was *not* closed off to conventioners. I don't
want  anyone to think that we were in an area that we weren't supposed to be in.
Anyone  could have gone back there, it's just that very few did. 
</P>
<P>If there was one problem with being back there, it's that I really only saw
Kate's  back while she was on stage. My plan was to take photos of the screen
while she was  there, but when she came out I was just as excited as everyone
else and went over to  the rail to see her in rl. I was going to take some rl
photos, then go back behind the  screen for the &quot;close ups&quot; but before
I knew it, Kate was finished and gone. :-( As  far as the photos go, it ended up
not mattering anyway, since I lost the bag that had  the camera in it. Chris had
a camera too, but somehow none of those photos came  out. Boo hoo, we came away
from the KonvenTion without any photos, so memories  will have to suffice. We
should have brought 3 or 4 cameras, but who knew? You'd  think 2 would've been
enough :-) 
</P>
<P>Ah, I'm rambling...I didn't start out to make this &quot;yet another
convention  report&quot; (sorry, but why did it seem like people were sick of
hearing about the Kon  after only a few posts?). 
</P>
<P>We had a great time.

</P>
<P>Peter Manchester wrote up all the events, and I think I can add some stuff: 
</P>
<P>&gt; At 2:30 there came the first break. This is when Andy and I went
searching for  food, found ourselves stranded on the third level when the first
boxes of posters and  pamphlets from the KBC and HG treasuries were being
spilled onstage to the  groping fans below us. Andy saw something rare spilling
out over to the right: &quot;Oh,  that's really rare, that's worth something!&quot;
he exclaimed in dismay. &quot;It's not rare  any more,&quot; I pointed out to
console him. 
</P>
<P>Was that the Bill Duffield benefiz concert programme? I thought about the 
same... 
</P>
<P>[auction:] &gt;    Del's Tour program from 1979           140 
</P>
<P>&gt; This last was the single most likely of all the items auctioned to
acquire a  collector's item value far beyond its auctioned price. It was a real
gift for Del to give  it over for the auction, and an even greater generosity
for him to let it go for the bid  that was accepted. 
</P>
<P>You forgot the most important thing about Del's Tour program: It is signed
by  ALL band members. 
</P>
<P>&gt; When the video ended, at about 8:38pm, the riser in the center of the
stage  lifted Kate Bush herself into our view, and All Rose. As mentioned, Kate
drew one  last raffle ticket, spoke of how happy she was to see us all, hoped we
would like the  film, looked forward to seeing us again. 
</P>
<P>Peter D F-M: Admit it, no chance, the first ticked that noone claimed was
faked.  Half of the time that Kate was on stage was used for the raffle ticked
drawing and  handing over the Japanese gold LP for Lionheart to the lucky thief
(thief of a kiss  that is). What would Kate have done if the ticket wasn't
invalid in the first try?  Maybe she'd have sung a song? ;-)

12:38:04 -0400 <BR> Subject: The Con 
</P>
<P>Hello! I'm back from England. I had a blast at the Kon, meeting many other 
Love-Hounds, and driving down narrow, windy English country lanes at 60 miles
per  hour on the wrong side of the road with a line of cars tailgating me! 
</P>
<P>&gt; [Graham Dombkins:] WOW! Does anybody have a list of the questions?? We 
send in the gaffa &quot;brains-trust&quot; and still didn't make it?? If you
could, send just the  questions in first and let us see how well we do ourselves
with them before you post  the answers. 
</P>
<P>In order to be fair, you'd have to reproduce the environment too. First,
make  sure that you are so excited you can't think straight. Second, make sure
that there  are lots of flashing lights blinking from all directions to distract
you, and cold air  blowing on you. Thirdly, have the questions read off so fast
that you barely have time  to write the question down before the next question
is read off. Fourthly, only give  yourself about ten or twenty seconds to answer
each question. 
</P>
<P>I think that the A team was also at a disadvantage in one sense, because I
think  we are all the type of scholar who remember where information can be
found,  rather than remembering every detail of the information itself. If we'd
had a bit  more time, and access to our libraries and computers, we would
probably been able  to get all of the questions right. One particularly
frustrating question was the  question of which of Kate's songs have the English
word &quot;Love&quot; in the title. This was  frustating for me because it is
the type of the question that I could answer in ten  seconds if I were sitting
at my computer. Or given half an hour I could answer it by  going through every
album in my head and writing down every song in order and  circling the songs
with &quot;Love&quot; in the title. But my mind doesn't free associate well 
enough for them all to just pop into my head in a few seconds, especially when 
excited and distracted--it tends to get stuck on a couple of them in a tight
circle. 
</P>
<P>Other frustating questions were: 
</P>
<P>- &quot;Which song has the lyric 'You know that I'll be waiting'?&quot;.
This was frustating  because the song &quot;Under The Ivy&quot; has the words &quot;I'll
be waiting&quot;, but not the  &quot;You know&quot;. Once your mind gets stuck
on something, it is hard to get it off it  though, and none of us has listened
to &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; enough for it to be  prominent enough in our
minds to push away one of our very favorite songs, even  though we knew it was
not quite right. 
</P>
<P>- &quot;Which song was inspired by the folk song 'Cerve, Cerve'?&quot; This
is the kind of  question that you are sure you heard the answer to once a long
time ago and you  can't quite dredge it out of you memory. The answer is
probably &quot;Babooshka&quot;. 
</P>
<P>- &quot;Name the Roy Harper track which has the line 'Endless lovers follow
you' in it.&quot;  This is a really frustating question because we certainly
knew the song (&quot;You  (The Game Part II) The two halves in Flight&quot;),
but it has two subtitles, and we  couldn't remember the second subtitle (&quot;The
two halves in Flight&quot;). I knew that  it had something to do with DNA (the
song is addressed to DNA), but I couldn't  remember exactly what. I hear that
Peter Fitzgerald-Morris is a stickler for detail  on these quizzes! This is
again especially frustrating because I knew that with my  computer I'd be able
to answer it in a few seconds. (My computer really is part  of my brain, you
see....) 
</P>
<P>I think that we definitely got the following thirteen questions right: 
</P>
<P>- Who mixed the recent 'Shoedance' mix of 'The Red Shoes'? 
</P>
<P>A: Karl Blagan 
</P>
<P>- Which of Kate's video did Roy Harper appear in? 
</P>
<P>A: Breathing 
</P>
<P>- Which Go West song did Kate provide backing vocals for? 
</P>
<P>A: The King is Dead 
</P>
<P>- Which song has the lyric 'You and me babe against the world'? 
</P>
<P>A: Burning Bridge 
</P>
<P>- Name the guardian angels mentioned in 'Lily'? 
</P>
<P>A: Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, Uriel 
</P>
<P>- Who played guitar on 'Big Stripey Lie'? 
</P>
<P>A: duh..... 
</P>
<P>- Which of Kate's Video did Albert Einstein appear in? 
</P>
<P>A: Hounds of Love 
</P>
<P>- Who originally recorded 'Lord Of The Reedy River'? 
</P>
<P>A: Donovan 
</P>
<P>- Which Kate song did Hue And Cry cover? 
</P>
<P>A: The Man With The Child In His Eyes 
</P>
<P>- Which Kate track was inspired by a Ken Russell film? 
</P>
<P>A: Delius (Song of Summer) 
</P>
<P>- What is the name of a person mentioned in one of Kate's songs who comes
from  Iraq? 
</P>
<P>A: Kashka 
</P>
<P>- Which Kate song mentions 'Bolan and Moony'? 
</P>
<P>A: Blow Away (For Bill) 
</P>
<P>- Who was historical figure who inspired the song 'Heads We're Dancing'? 
</P>
<P>A: This one is kind of a trick question because the obvious answer is
Hitler, but we  believe that the answer being looked for is Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>	 IED seemed to know the answers for these questions, but I don't recall
whether  he actually got them right or not: 
</P>
<P>- Who directed the 1948 film 'The Red Shoes'? 
</P>
<P>- Name the location used for the 'Cloudbusting' video? 
</P>
<P>- Who was 'Teddy' as mentioned &quot;spinning in the chair at Abbey Road&quot;
in  'Moments of Pleasure'? 
</P>
<P>Even if we got all of these last three right, however, that would have only
given us  sixteen, and the winning team had seventeen. If Peter isn't as much of
a stickler as  I've been led to believe on the Roy Harper song, and we got all
the last three right,  we would have tied. Since Peter said that no one even
came close, I must assume that  Peter was a stickler on this, and we got several
of the last three questions wrong.

<P>Hi! 
</P>
<P>No, I'm not yet recovered from the Kon. It was tons o' fun! I do have a few 
things to note: 
</P>
<P>The quiz question to which the answer was &quot;Blow Away&quot; was actually
&quot;In which  of Kate's songs are Bolan and Moony heading the show?&quot; I
thought this question was  particularly well phrased, so it stuck in my head...
I'm afraid I was of little to no  help the Love-Hounds B team, alas, just as I
was of little help to the Love-Hounds  team at the last Kon, but hey, it was
fun. :) 
</P>
<P>Peter M., thanks much for your detailed report. (In case anyone is
wondering,  Peter Manchester also makes a wonderful and fascinating travel
companion!)

</P>
<P>Probably the late Marc Bolan of T. Rex (remember 'Bang a Gong'?,c. 1974) and
 the late Keith Moon, often called 'Moony', of The Who.

</P>
<P>Those who attended the Konvention earlier this year will remember that the
quiz  question which supposedly caused the most trouble was &quot;Who directed
the 1948 film  The Red Shoes?&quot;. Most of us answered &quot;Michael Powell&quot;
while the the quizmaster  (PDFM) wanted the answer &quot;Michael Powell &amp;
Emeric Pressburger&quot;. Well, yesterday  I picked up a CD entitled &quot;The
Red Shoes - Classic British Film Music&quot; (for a mere  #1.99). (As an aside
my main motivation was not ultra rabid KaTe fanaticism but the  fact that the CD
contains Ralph Vaughan Williams' score for the film &quot;Coastal  Command&quot;
- RVW being my favourite classical composer.) Anyway, in the booklet  there is a
copy of the &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; poster on which can be clearly read &quot;directed
 by Michael Powell written by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&quot;. I
rest my  case.

</P>
<P>In Powell's autobiography A Life In Movies he stated clearly that in his 
partnership with Emeric Pressburger, The Archers, they wrote together, with 
Pressburger doing most of the dialogue. Powell himself was the director--always.
 The joint title on some of their films expressed the fact that they were a
team. 
</P>
<P>Besides, Powell was a director before and after his work with Pressburger; 
Pressburger was not. You was robbed!

</P>
<P>Help! I'm trying to put together a little newsletter and I need some info on
the  Convention. I didn't write down all the details of the event as I was
counting on  reports here to be more complete, and so they were. However, I
didn't take copies  of anything posted to refer to and now I discover that the
University only has enough  disk space for a mere 4 days worth of Usenet
postings, after which they are deleted! 
</P>
<P>Can anybodout there please mail me with the answers to these questions:s: 
</P>
<P>Who were the performers and what did they do? 
</P>
<P>    Rare Flowers - Sang WH, Red Shoes and ??? Who are they? 
</P>
<P>    The name of the young man who danced to MoP? 
</P>
<P>    The name of the dance group who did Ken? 
</P>
<P>    Any others I've forgotten? 
</P>
<P>What was the raffle prize(s) that Kate issued? 
</P>
<P>What were the auction items and how much did they each fetch? 
</P>
<P>Who was the winning team of the quiz? What was the prize? 
</P>
<P>Who were the makers of 'The Pink Mules' film? 
</P>
<P>    (Steve Thomas was one I think.)

<P>Out of the top 50 what were the top 20 songs?
