<P>Hello! 
</P>
<P>Lily is a real character, a healer and psychic who has been helping Kate
through  the darker times over the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>She has clearly taught Kate Dion Fortune's cut down version of the lesser
ritual  of the pentagram - a potent method of defence against psychic attack. 
</P>
<P>See my review in the current HOMEGROUND (49).

<P>Uh oh. Wait till the American Fundies hear about this. They'll be playing
the  thing backwards looking for the Satanic subliminals, taking Kate to court
for every  other teen suicide, burning the thing in public, banning it from
libraries, and making  one big batch of publicity for the album...

<BR> Subject: Messages on Lily 
</P>
<P>Bravo, Graham! IED was wondering when someone would finally calm down  from
the initial adolescent impulse to trash (mindlessly) Kate's new music long 
enough to start LISTENING to it -- and thus to notice, for example, the three  &quot;buried&quot;
spoken messages in &quot;Lily&quot;, which IED has been trying to make out for
days  now. He almost agrees with you about the first two, but he believes the
full lines are  something like &quot;Here's Michael on your right!&quot; and &quot;Uriel
on your left!&quot; or  something like that. As for the third, later line, it
stands out very clearly as a spoken  sentence, but IED has yet to make out a
single word. There are also messages on  other tracks, he believes.

</P>
<P>I get a kick when I see that people who have praised Lily (which IS very
good)  have complained about Rocket Man being &quot;one of the two or three
worst things she  has ever allowed to be released&quot;. I would challenge you
to do this...make a cassette  tape. Record Rocket Man, and pause the tape just
before the the fade (when Kate is  singing her ahh, ahh, ahh's). Now start Lily,
but don't take the tape off of pause  until after the music begins (about 25
seconds in, I think). When you are finished,  run the tape back and listen to
it, the transition will be so smooth that you will  almost miss it. In fact, I
am recommending (Kate are you listening?) a Rocket  Man/Lily medley when she
appears on Letterman or SNL. Well, I can wish. 
</P>
<P>Also, I swear, if you'll turn the volume up on Lily during the &quot;prayer&quot;,
in the  background you can hear a whiny, tinny voice saying something like &quot;Will
you let  me finish? You've been talking for 20 seconds, do I get to say anything&quot;.

</P>
<P>Hello Friends, 
</P>
<P>The full Pentagram ritual is set out at page 106 of Israel Regardie's
definitive  work on the Golden Dawn system. The version taught by Lily to Kate
is similar to  that recomended by Dion Fortune's book on psychic attack. The
latter book explains  fully all the various symptoms of psychic attack and ways
of dealing with it.

</P>
<P>Pardon Me, 
</P>
<P>Does anyone know what Kate is saying in the song &quot;Lily&quot; when she
gets to the  part :   Grrrrrr...This is my space....????????....??????? 
</P>
<P>The closest I can figure is a stilted &quot;Exactly.&quot; Rather than
destroy my ears by  listening to this on my headphones at full volume, can you
give me a clue? 
</P>
<P>...cfg... Its always those damn details that keep me wide 01/05/94 awake, 
staring...at the ceiling.....is that a crack?
