<P>I'm back from Birmingham AL, a lovely city, and I'd like to thank all Love 
Hounds who laboriously typed in (and will doubtless type more) --it was
wonderful  to come home and find those waiting for me in my box. </P>
<P>I have a copy of Hans Christian Andersen's original story (which I think is
one  he collected from an elderly person long ago); it's in an old childhood
book of my  mother's. If anyone is interested I can post it Monday or Tuesday
after I'v had time  this weekend to type it up, or I could upload it (someone
needs to tell me where), or  I would be willing to make a xerox for anyone who
will send me a self-addressed  stamped envelope. </P>
<P>The story is somewhat different than what Kate has used for her movie. The 
interview in which she talked about the shoes that don't want to stop dancing,
and  which kidnap a young girl every night seems to be a fusion of both The Red
Shoes  (shoes which can't be removed and which dance endlessly) and The Twelve
Dancing  Princesses (who slip away and dance all night long and are exhausted
every day). </P>
<P>Would a few people who have preferences e-mail me at kln@crl.com and let me 
know if you'd like the story and in what format. I don't want to retype it twice
--  though it may be a tad long to send to love-hounds. </P>

<P>Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1993 20:41:55 -0700 (PDT) <BR> From: &quot;Karen L.
Newcombe&quot; &lt;kln@crl.com&gt; <BR> Subject: The Red Shoes - Andersen </P>
<P>The Red Shoes </P>
<P>by Hans Christian Andersen </P>
<P>There was once a little girl. She was a tiny delicate little thing, but she
always had  to go about barefoot in summer, because she was very poor. In winter
she had only  a pair of heavy wooden shoes, and her ankles were terribly chafed.
</P>
<P>An old mother shoemaker lived in the middle of the village, and she made a
pair  of little shoes out of some strips of red cloth. They were very clumsy,
but they were  made with the best intention, for the little girl was to have
them. Her name was Karen. </P>
<P>These shoes were given to her, and she wore them for the first time on the
day  her mother was buried. They were certainly not mourning shoes, but she had
no  others, and so she walked barelegged in them behind the poor pine coffin.
</P>
<P>Just then a big carriage drove by, and a big old lady was seated in it. She
looked  at the little girl and felt very, very sorry for her, and said to the
parson, &quot;Give the  little girl to me and I will look after her and be kind
to her.&quot; Karen thought it was  all because of the red shoes, but the old
lady said they were hideous, and they were  burnt. Karen was well and neatly
dressed, and had to learn reading and sewing.  People said she was pretty, but
her mirror said, &quot;You are more than pretty. You are  lovely!&quot; </P>
<P>At this time the Queen was taking a journey through the country, and she had
 her little daughter the Princess with her. The people, and among them Karen, 
crowded round the palace where they were staying, to see them. The little
Princess  stood at a window to show herself. She wore neither a train nor a
golden crown, but  she was dressed all in white with a beautiful pair of red
morocco shoes. They were  indeed a contrast to those the poor old mother had
made for Karen. Nothing in the  world could be compared to these red shoes. </P>
<P>The time came when Karen was old enough to be confirmed. She had new 
clothes and she was also to have a pair of new shoes. The rich shoemaker in the 
town was to take the measure of her little foot. His shop was full of glass
cases of the  most charming shoes and shinyleather boots. They looked beautiful
but the old lady  could not see very well, so it gave her no pleasure to look at
them. Among all the  other shoes there was one pair of red shoes like those worn
by the Princess. Oh,  how pretty they were! The shoemaker told them that they
had been made for an  earl's daughter, but they had not fitted. &quot;I suppose
they are patent leather,&quot; said the  old lady. &quot;They are so shiny.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, they do shine,&quot; said Karen, who tried them on. They fitted
and were bought,  but the old lady had not the least idea that they were red,or
she would never have  allowed Karen to wear them for her confirmation. This she
did however. </P>
<P>Everyone looked at her feet,and when she walked up the church to the chancel
 she thought that even the old pictures, those portraits of dead and gone
priests and  their wives, with stiff collars and long black clothes, fixed their
eyes upon her shoes.  She thought of nothing else when the minister laid his
hand upon her head and  spoke to her of holy baptism, the covenant of God, and
said that henceforth she was  to be a responsible Christian person. The solemn
notes of the organ resounded, the  children sang with their sweet voices, and
the old precentor sang,but Karen thought  only about her red shoes. </P>
<P>By the afternoon the old lady had been told on all sides that the shoes were
red,  and she said it was very naughty and most improper. For the future,
whenever  Karen went to the church she was to wear black ones,even if they were
old. Next  Sunday there was holy communion, and Karen was to receive it for the
first time.  She looked at the black shoes and then at the red ones. Then she
looked again at the  red shoes and at last put them on. </P>
<P>It was beautiful sunny weather. Karen and the old lady went by the path
through  the cornfield, and it was rather dusty. By the church door stood an old
soldier with a  crutch. He had a curious long beard; it was more red than white
-- in fact it was almost  quite red. He bend down to the ground and asked the
old lady if he might dust  her shoes. Karen put out her little foot too. &quot;See
what beautiful dancing shoes!&quot; said  the soldier. &quot;Mind you stick fast
when you dance.&quot; And as he spoke he struck the  soles with his hand. The
old lady gave the soldier a copper and went into the church  with Karen. All the
people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the  portraits looked
too. When Karen knelt at the altar rails and the chalice was put to  her lips,
she thought only of the red shoes. She seemed to see them floating before  her
eyes. She forgot to join in the hymn of praise, and she forgot to say the Lord's
Prayer. </P>
<P>Now everybody left the church, and the old lady got into her carriage. Karen
 lifted her foot to get in after her, but just then the old soldier,who was
still standing  there, said, &quot;See what pretty dancing shoes!&quot; Karen
couldn't help it: she took a few  dancing steps, and when she began her feet
continued to dance. It was just as if the  shoes had a power over them. She
danced right round the church. She couldn't stop.  The coachman had to run after
her, take hold of her, and lift her into the carriage;  but her feet continued
to dance, so that she kicked the poor lady horribly. At last  they got the shoes
off and her feet had a little rest. </P>
<P>When they got home the shoes were put away in a cupboard, but Karen could
not  help going to look at them. </P>
<P>The old lady became very ill. They said she could not live. She had to be
carefully  nursed and tended, and no one was nearer than Karen to do this. But
there was to  be a grand ball in the town and Karen was invited. She looked at
the old lady, who  aft er all could not live. Then she looked at the red shoes
-- she thought there was  no harm in doing so. She put on the red shoes -- that
much she thought she might  do -- and then she went to the ball and began to
dance. The shoes would not let her  do what she liked: when she wanted to go to
the right, they danced to the left.  When she wanted to dance up the room, the
shoes danced down the room, and then  down the stairs, through the streets and
out of the town gate. Away she danced, and  away she had to dance, right into
the dark forest. Something shone up above the  trees and she thought it was the
moon, for it was a face, but it was the old soldier  with the red beard. He
nodded and said, &quot;See what pretty dancing shoes! &quot; </P>
<P>This frightened her terribly and she wanted to throw off the red shoes,but
they  stuck fast. She tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to
her feet. So off  she danced, and off she had to dance, over fields and meadows,
in rain and sunshine,  by day and by night, but at night it was fearful. </P>
<P>She danced into the open churchyard, but the dead did not join her dance;
they  had something much better to do. She wanted to sit down on a pauper's
grave  where the bitter wormwood grew, but there was no rest nor repast for her.
When  she danced towards the open church door, she saw an angel standing there
in long  white robes and wings which reached from his shoulders to the ground.
His face  was grave and stern, and in his hand he held a broad and shining
sword. </P>
<P>&quot;Dance you shall!&quot; said he. &quot;You shall dance in your red
shoes till you are pale and  cold. Till your skin shrivels up and you are a
skeleton! You shall dance from door to  door, and wherever you find proud vain
children, you must knock at the door so that  they may see you and fear you.
Yea, you shall dance --&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Mercy!&quot; shrieked Karen, but she did not hear the angel's answer,
for the shoes  bore her through the gate into the fields, and over roadways and
paths. Ever and  ever she was forced to dance. </P>
<P>One morning she danced past a door she knew well. She heard the sound of a 
hymn from within, and a coffin covered with flowers was being carried out. Then 
she knew that the old lady was dead, and it seemed to her that she was forsaken
by  all the world and cursed by the holy angels of God. </P>
<P>On and ever on she danced. Dance she must, even through the dark nights. The
 shoes bore her away over briars and stubble till her feet were torn and
bleeding. She  danced away over the heath till she came to a little lonely
house. She knew the  executioner lived here, and she tapped with her fingers on
the windowpane and  said, &quot;Come out! Come out! I can't come in for I am
dancing!&quot; </P>
<P>The executioner said, &quot;You can't know who I am? I chop the bad people's
heads  off, and I see that my ax is quivering.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't chop off my head,&quot; said Karen, &quot;for then I can never
repent of my sins.  But pray, chop off my feet with the red shoes!&quot; </P>
<P>Then he made her a pair of wooden feet and crutches, and he taught her a 
psalm, the one penitents always sing. And she kissed the hand which had wielded 
the ax and went away over the heath. </P>
<P>&quot;I have suffered enough for those red shoes!&quot; said she. &quot;I
will go to the church  now, so that they may see me.&quot; And she went as fast
as she could to the church door.  When she got there, the red shoes danced right
up in front of her, and she was  frightened and went home again. </P>
<P>She was very sad all the week and shed many bitter tears, but when Sunday 
came she said, &quot;Now then, I have suffered and struggled long enough. I
should think  I am quite as good as many who sit holding their heads so high in
church.&quot; </P>
<P>She went along quite boldly, but she did not get further than the gate
before she  saw the red shoes dancing in front of her. She was more frightened
than ever and  turned back, this time with real repentance in her heart. Then
she went to the  parson's house and begged to be taken into service. She would
be very industrious  and work as hard as she could. She didn't care what wages
they gave her, if only she  might have a roof over her head and live among kind
people. The parson's wife was  sorry for her, and took her into service. She
proved to be very industrious and  thoughtful. She sat very still and listened
most attentively in the evening when the  parson read the Bible. All the little
ones were very fond of her, but when they  chattered about finer and dress and
about being as beautiful as a queen, she would  shake her head. </P>
<P>Next Sunday they all went to church and they asked her if she would go with 
them, but she looked sadly, with tears in her eyes, at her crutches. And they
went  without her to hear the word of God, while she sat in her little room
alone. It was  only big enough for a bed and a chair. She sat there with her
prayer book in her  hand, and as she read it with a humble mind she heard the
notes of the organ, borne  from the church by the wind. She raised her
tear-stained face and said, &quot;Oh, God  help me!&quot; </P>
<P>Then the sun shone brightly round her, and the angel in the white robes whom
 she has seen that night at the church door stood before her. He no longer held
the  sharp sword in his hand, but a beautiful green branch covered with roses.
He  touched the ceiling with it and it rose to agreat height, and wherever he
touched it  a golden star appeared. Then he touched the walls and they spread
themselves out,  and she saw and heard the organ. She saw the pictures of the
old parsons and their  wives. The congregation were all sitting in their seats
singing aloud -- for the church  itself had come home to the poor girl in her
narrow little chamber, or else she had  been taken to it. She found herself on
the bench with the other people from the  parsonage. And when the hymn had come
to an end, they looked up and nodded to  her and said, &quot;It was a good thing
you came after all, little Karen!&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;It was through God's mercy!&quot; she said. The organ sounded and the
children's  voices echoed so sweetly through the choir. The warm sunshine
streamed brightly in  through the window,right up to the bench where Karen sat.
Her heart was so  overfilled with the sunshine, with peace, and with joy, that
it broke. Her soul flew  with the sunshine to heaven, and no one there asked
about the red shoes. </P>
<P>-----</P>
<P>Well, o best beloved, there you have it. Karen, by the way, is the Danish
form of  Catherine. </P>
<P>Perhaps we can prevail on Professor Manchester to give us some background on
 the morality lessons that were laid over old folk tales during the Victorian
era to  make them suitable for frightening small children into piety and virtue.
Plenty of  mythological material here. Note similarities to Little Red Riding
Hood -- another  old story that was appropriated for the purpose of expounding a
moral lesson. </P>
<P>Hope you enjoyed it nontheless! </P>

Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: H.C. Andersen's &quot;Red
Shoes&quot; </P>
<P>Many thanks to Karen Newcombe for transcribing Hans Christian Andersen's 
version of &quot;The Red Shoes.&quot; After it she writes: </P>
<P>&gt; Perhaps we can prevail on Professor Manchester to give us some
background on  the morality lessons that were laid over old folk tales during
the Victorian era to  make them suitable for frightening small children into
piety and virtue. Plenty of  mythological material here. Note similarities to
Little Red Riding Hood -- another  old story that was appropriated for the
purpose of expounding a moral lesson. </P>
<P>The question of &quot;the morality lessons that were laid over old folk
tales&quot; is  exceptionally important--important in itself, as well as for
reaching Kate in her new  work--and I wish I had much to contribute to it.
Unhappily, all the experience I  have in studying the manipulation of mythical
material for moral effect is ancient: the  adaptation of ancient Near Eastern
myth by the Bible, and of epic and tragic  literature in Greece by the
philosophers. </P>
<P>But I'll bet the farm that there are plenty of lurkers here who know their
way  around post-medieval European folk tales well enough to have comments and 
suggestions about the scenes, themes, colors, characters, etc. in the Hans
Christian  Andersen telling of the story. I will be glad to compile and edit all
such, throw in  what I can on my own, and post the result for Halloween. </P>
<P>If you recognize what Karen Newcombe is asking about and have something to 
contribute, send me e-mail (rather than posting to gaffa/love-hounds) by Friday,
 October 29. </P>
<P>On first quick read-through, what strikes me most immediately about the HCA 
&quot;Red Shoes&quot; is the weight that the reader is expected to attach to
Karen's (Cathy's)  fixation on thinking of herself in her red shoes at her
Confirmation and at the  Eucharist--where she even forgot to join in the &quot;Lord's
Prayer.&quot; In the plot of the  story, this is the heart of the iniquity that
justifies the grotesque details of her  purgation and repentance, and it is also
the point of contact between the erotic and  the spiritual. Which is where the
magical finds its power. Children know this  instinctively and understand it
with complete authority. Efforts by adults to tame the  magical for morality
inevitably have completely contrary results with children. </P>

Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: Mythic dimension
of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; </P>
<P>I was not left lonely when I volunteered to organize research into the
mythical  aspects of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; story tradition, about which
Karen Newcombe had  expressed interest a week or so ago. Tipped off by Brian
Gallagher (thanks a ton!), I  now discover that a great deal of the relevant
work has already been done: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&gt;Date: Wed, 20 Oct 1993 08:57:24 -0700 (PDT) <BR> &gt;From:
briang@efn.org (Brian Gallagher)<BR>  &gt;Subject: RE: H.C. Andersen's &quot;Red
Shoes&quot; </P>
<P>&gt;Look into a book entitled Women Who Run With The Wolves by Clarissa 
Pinkola Estes. Chapter 8, &quot;Self-preservation: </P>
<P>&gt;Identifying leg traps, cages, and poisoned bait&quot;, reproduces an
ancient version of  the story and interprets it in the light of the author's 20+
years as a storyteller and  practicing Jungian psychologist. </P>
<P>The version Estes presents is &quot;a Magyar-Germanic version my Aunt Tereza
used  to tell us when we were children&quot; (p. 215). That means that her text
is an original,  currently in print (and a best-seller to boot), so I don't want
to transcribe it. Her  knowledge about the substance of the story and about its
traditions means that she  has probably very accurately portrayed a version
current in medieval, maybe even  early medieval times. But she also talks about
the roots of the 'red shoes' myth  motif in very ancient Persian, Indian, and
Egyptian 'threshold' rites for young  women at the time they enter into their
roles with respect to the passage of blood,  in which they paint their feet red.
There are a lot of layers between that stratum and  the early European story!
</P>
<P>Clarissa Pinkola Estes &lt;what a trip of a name to type!&gt; really doesn't
need to  reconstruct all that history in order to get at the archetypal
dimension of the one we  know from Hans Christian Andersen, about which Karen
raised her question. Her  family's version makes loud and clear the
manipulations HCA used to 'moralize'  the story. I can briefly outline the major
changes or additions he made, assuming his  source tradition was close to the
one Estes tells from. </P>
<P>First you need to know this much about Estes' interpretation: she is clear
that  the brutal ending is truthful about the nature of the red shoes. The story
is  &quot;variously known by the names 'The Devil's Dancing Shoes', 'The Red-Hot
Shoes  of the Devil', and 'The Red Shoes'.&quot; Her theme is that the girl
(called Karen by  HCA, but nameless in Estes's version) has had the Wild Woman
in her captured  and injured in instinct by the dry and near-blind rich woman
who 'domesticated'  her, so that when she later tries to let the Wild Woman out,
she is vulnerable to  &quot;Leg Traps, Cages, and Poisoned Bait&quot; (title of
the chapter). Brian generously  transcribed the specific hazards that Estes
discusses: </P>
<P>&gt;The traps: </P>
<P>&gt; #1 The Gilded Carriage, the Devalued Life </P>
<P>&gt; #2 The Dry Old Woman, the Senescent Force </P>
<P>&gt; #3 Burning the Treasure, Hambre del Alma, Soul Famine </P>
<P>&gt; #4 Injury to Basic Instinct, the Consequences of Capture </P>
<P>&gt; #5 Trying to Sneak a Secret Life, Split in Two </P>
<P>&gt; #6 Cringing Before the Collective, Shadow Rebellion </P>
<P>&gt; #7 Faking it, Trying to be Good, Normalizing the Abnormal </P>
<P>&gt; #8 Dancing Out of Control, Obsession and Addiction </P>
<P>This last, the most drastic, is the one dramatized by the story. It ends in
disaster,  with the girl quite abject. The last line: &quot;And now the girl was
a poor cripple, and  had to find her own way in the world as a servant to
others, and she never, ever  again wished for red shoes.&quot; (Several times in
the chapter, Estes talks about Janis  Joplin, as an illustration of how it can
go if the 'dancing-out-of-control' Wild  Woman gets an audience who egg her on
for vicarious excitment.) </P>
<P> I'll summarize HCA's major changes quite schematically: </P>
<P>MAGYAR-GERMANIC 	HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSON </P>
<P><EM>A little girl, poor, whose mother dies.</EM> </P>
<P>A motherless poor girl </P>
<P><EM>Taken to &quot;old mother shoe   maker&quot; for her childhood red 	 
shoes; given to her, first 	  worn when mother dies. </EM></P>
<P>Makes her own red shoes, sewn from cloth straps, crude, but she loved them
and they help her accommodate her hard life.</P>
<P><EM>Wealthy old woman in gilded 	  carriage takes her in, cleans  	  her
up, burns her shoes.</EM> </P>
<P>Big old lady portrayed as kind and feeling sorry for her, asks the parson if
she can take care of her. Shoes burned. </P>
<P>Spurious sub-plot involving Queen and  Princess, tempting Karen to vanity
and envy. </P>
<P><EM>Finds red shoes in shop of old 	  crippled cobler. He winks at  her as
the old woman, color- 	  blind, buys them for her. 	  Shoes said to &quot;glow.&quot;
</EM></P>
<P>Goes to rich shoemaker; thinks of the Princess's shoes; is told these were
made for an earl's daughter; shoes are said to be &quot;shiny.&quot;</P>
<P><EM>Confirmation on the &quot;Day of The Innocents.</EM>  </P>
<P>Merely said to be old enough to be confirmed.</P>
<P><EM>Details on red shoes in church 	 emphasize lusciousness: &quot;like 	 
burnished apples, red-washed 	  plums...bright like crimson, 	  bright like
raspberries, bright  like pomegranates.&quot;</EM> </P>
<P>Karen &quot;thought only of the red shoes,&quot; but the story details not
how she thought about them, but all the pious activities going on that she was
ignoring.</P>
<P><EM>Old soldier with red beard taps 	 the soles of her shoes with a 	 
little song that made the soles  of her feet itch. </EM></P>
<P>Old soldier with red beard simply &quot;struck the soles with his hand.&quot;</P>
<P>Old lady hides the red shoes. 	  She becomes bed-ridden, and so 	  Karen is
free to search them 	  out, obsessively. When she 	  finds them and puts them
on,   they dance her out the door. 	</P>
<P>Old lady becomes very ill. Has to be nursed and tended, but Karen is invited
to a grand ball. Looks at lady &quot;who after all could not live, &quot; at the
shoes, goes to the ball, and there the dancing shoes take over. </P>
<P><EM>A Spirit of Dread prevents her 	  from entering the churchyard; 	  he
pronounces her curse.</EM> 	 </P>
<P>Gets in among the gravestones, but is accosted by an angel at the church
door. Curse toned down, and a moralizing note on &quot;proud, vain children&quot;
is added.</P>
<P><EM>Executioner cuts off her feet, 	  the shoes dance them off into 	  the
forest, she becomes a   cripple and a servant. End.</EM>  </P>
<P>Asks feet to be chopped off so she can &quot;repent of my sins.&quot;  He
makes her wooden feet and crutches, teaches her a 	penitent's psalm.  She keeps
trying to go to church, but is blocked by the dancing  shoes. Frightened, and
seeking &quot;real repentence in her heart,&quot;  begs the parson to be taken
into service. </P>
<P> The whole rest of the 'redemption' stuff from there on is totally spurious 
preachment. How &quot;She proved to be very industrious and thoughtful. She sat
very  still and listened most attentively in the evening when the parson read
the Bible.&quot; It  gets progressively more ghastly, until finally, &quot;Her
heart was so overfilled with the  sunshine, with peace, and with joy, that it
broke. Her soul flew with the sunshine to  heaven, and no one there asked about
the red shoes.&quot; Bleuch! </P>
<P>What I expected to find as the &quot;magic&quot; in this, as a children's
story, is actually  some pretty drastic and violent action (an authenticating
aspect, as Estes makes  clear)--some pretty powerful &quot;voodoo&quot; as Kate
Bush's lyric has it. (Anybody reading  Alice Walker lately is aware that the
social pathologies around this whole area can  be pretty drastic, too.) </P>
<P>So far as I can tell at this point, in the kb song only the shoes themselves
and the  frenzied dancing come from the folk story. The dramatic situation (&quot;She,&quot;
dancing  like the Diva &lt;'Goddess', Sanskrit&gt; in red shoes, dancing like &quot;I&quot;
would love to, but  can't, because &quot;all her gifts for the dance had gone&quot;)
seems quite different. Also, it  is not clear that for Kate the shoes are the
devil's only: is the stanza with &quot;your eyes  are lifted to God&quot;
supposed to be redemptive? </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
