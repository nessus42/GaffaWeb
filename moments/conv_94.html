<P>Welcome to the 1994 Kate Bush Convention,  especially to those of you who
have travelled  so far to get here. 
</P>
<P>Today we will be celebrating the release of Kate's seventh album, &quot;The
Red shoes&quot;  and her debut film project, &quot;The Line, The Cross &amp; The
Curve&quot;. We will of course be showing the film today, plus an interview  in
which Kate talks at length about both the film and the album. We will also be
remebering the past by showing a selection of rare TV and video clips, including
the BBC 2 &quot;Kate&amp;quotl; special from 1979. Thanks are due to everyone
who sent us their Kate Top Ten (we know it was a tough job!) we will reveal the
results later. 
</P>
<P>Other things happning today include the brain stretching quiz, with some
very special prizes for the winning team, some great live music and dance from
other fans, a raffle and some surprises. The day will end with the largest ever
Kate inspired Disco/Party, a chance to hear Kate's music really loud and go
completely mad! 
</P>
<P>Many thanks to everyone who has been involved in the organisation of the
Concention and to our brave team of helpers. 
</P>
<P>Have fun! 
</P>
<P>Lisa, Dave, Peter and Krys.
