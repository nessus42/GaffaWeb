<P>During my first listen to Big Stripey Lie, I realized that the song was pure
genius.  I have endevoured to discern it's divine lyrics, and following is my
attempt at  decipherment. There are many words that I am unsure of, so please

<P>IED is compelled to point out that Kate's new music -- all of it -- is
fascinating  and blindingly brilliant. All of the negative criticism that IED
has read in this forum  of late is laughably ignorant and careless; all of the
positive comments are intelligent  and cogently argued, and amply demonstrate
their authors' unfailing musical acuity.  These, of course, are not opinions,
but self-evident faKTs. 
</P>
<P>One other thing. &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; is now universally acknowledged
as the single  greatest musical work of the twentieth century. IED is pleased to
add that there is  no question whatever of the truth of this judgment, which is
unanimous, absolute  and irrevocable. 
</P>
<P>-- andrew bolTon marvicK (IED), deafeningly blowing Kate's trumpets -- and 
sure enough, the walls of Jericho are tumbling down this very day...

</P>
<P>Happy happy joy joy, I got the Rubberband Girl single in the mail today.
(You  might be interested to know that Canada Post considers 11 working days,
i.e. two  weeks, standard delivery time from Toronto to PEI....you can fly it in
about 2 1/2  hours...) 
</P>
<P>I've already raved about RBG, but whoa! Big Stripey Lie? What the hell is
this  song? It's f890ing weird! But it's great! Whoever described it as a mud
wrestling  match between Nigel Kennedy and Neil Young was right on. Again this
shows how  talented Kate B. is, that she can do a girly pop song and something
as off the wall as  this *on the same record*. 
</P>
<P>The album should be *real* interesting. 
</P>
<P>Cheers, Fiona

<P>Date: Tue, 19 Oct 1993 01:17:35 -0400 (EDT) <BR> From: Peter Byrne
Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: BSL US and UK 
</P>
<P>Thanks to David Koehler for emailing: 
</P>
<P>&gt;Regarding the bass on the new Kate singles, I've notice a large
difference  between the BSL on the U.K. RBG single and the BSL on the U.S. ETM
single. BSL  on the UK single has the bass extended much deeper than the US
single. At first the  difference seemed slight, since I was listening on
headphones, but when put it on the  speakers I noticed that the U.K. BSL was
vibrating the room in a way the U.S.  version never did. I hope this is not an
indication of the over all level of care put into  the album! 
</P>
<P>Dead right: there is no comparison--except that unfortunately, there is. It
is very  clear that the US release has been equalized for the &lt;supposed&gt;
market. It is not  carelessness, but deliberate and unacceptable manipulation of
the artist's work. BSL  on EtM is missing a whole octave of bottom bass, and
along with that has been  goosed about 2-4db. in overall level as shown on fast
electronic level indicaters. But it  shows nearly the same on meters with true
VU ballistics. This is an eq tailored for  the kinds of FM stations that play on
the speakers in your gym. It'll put out on the  rack systems in the mall, too. 
</P>
<P>BSL on Sony/Columbia has been doctored in quite a different way than &quot;Ne
 T'Enfuis Pas&quot; in its second release. An attentive listen to the track on
TWW shows  that neither the balance nor the extension of the bass has been
altered, only the  vocal level raised. Since I tend to set my volume so that the
voice level sounds right,  that mix seemed bass-light compared to the first
release (B-side of TGaT). 
</P>
<P>In the circumstances I must suspend, if not withdraw, my characterization of
the  bass sound on EtM itself. We won't know what Kate expected it to sound like
until  we get a release that reflects her own production judgment.

<P>And I'm afraid you'll never know *that* until you get the chance to go sit
in  kate's studio and have her play the original master tape at you. it's a fact
of the  industry that there will be tweaks between the time the tape leaves
Kate's grubby  palms and the time you put the CD in your player and hit the

Many  artists do. 
</P>
<P>In the case of digitally mixed program, it's not necessary that the
mastering  process involve making any artistic or corrective changes at
all--it's simply a  format/media transfer. You can even do the mastering
yourself with a CD recorder.  In any case, it is not a &quot;fact of the
industry,&quot; nor &quot;inevitable&quot; the way it was in the  days of vinyl.

</P>
<P>Actually, as many recent interviews and reviews I've read indicate, despite
the  fact that your comments are essentially true , changes DO often occur
during the  mastering proccess to this day EVEN when they aren't nescessary.
Mastering  engineers left unsupervised often think that they're doing the artist
or company a  favor by altering the information slightly. Rudy VanGelder now
refuses any  recording project for his studio unless he is allowed to also do
the mastering there  too. This is to protect the integrity of the sound he
initially recorded. 
</P>
<P>It may not be &quot;inevitable&quot; but it is a &quot;fact&quot; of the
industry. It SHOULDN'T be (as  Dan points out), but things happen.

<P>Date:   Thu, 28 Oct 93 11:45:12 MET <BR> From: awphili@cs.vu.nl (Albert
Philipsen) <BR> Subject: Big Stripy Lie explained 
</P>
<P>This is a first attempt at giving an interpretation to Kate's new song &quot;Big
Stripy  Lie&quot;. I'll first give a transcription of the lyrics. I hope this is
mostly correct. 
</P>
<P>[see <A HREF="2_1.html">Lyrics Section</A>]
</P>
<P>My theory is that this song is about spiritual emergency. To understand what
this  is, you'll need to read the book The Stormy Search for the Self
(Understanding and  Living With Spiritual Emergency), by Christina Grof &amp;
Stanislav Grof, MD. Here is a  little quote from the back cover of the book: 
</P>
<P>Many people are undergoing a profound personal transformation associated
with  spiritual opening. Under favourable circumstances, this process results in
emotional  healing, a radical shift in values, and a profound awareness of the
mystical dimension  of existence. For some, these changes are gradual and
relatively smooth, but for  others, they can be so rapid and dramatic that they
interfere with effective everyday  functioning. Unfortunately, many health
professionals do not recognize the positive  potential of these crises, but see
them as manifestations of mental disease and treat  them with suppressive
medication. 
</P>
<P>I'll now go through the lyrics a few lines at a time, and try to explain the
song in  terms of spiritual emergency. There are three characters playing in
this song, I  think. The first is the person going through the spiritual
emergency. He/she doesn't  have any lyrics. The second person is a friend or
relative of the first, and he/she  sings the verses. The third person is the
evil psychiatrist who sings the indented bits. 
</P>
<P><EM>Oh big stripy lie moving like a wavy line<BR>  Coming up
behind-ind-ind</EM> </P>
<P>My first impression was that &quot;big stripy lie&quot; could be a reference
to the American  flag, and more specifically a reference to the American
materialistic value system. 
</P>
<P><EM>All young gentle dreams drowning in life's grief <BR> Can you hang on
to me </EM></P>
<P>A spiritual emergency is often triggered by a sudden loss, such as the death
of a  loved one or an unrequited love. 
</P>
<P><EM>Don't wanna hurt you baby <BR> Only wanna help you <BR> I could be
good for you</EM> </P>
<P>This is the psychiatrist talking, who thinks the first person is obviously
going  mad, and wants to &quot;help&quot; him/her using a standard treatment
with suppressive  medication. 
</P>
<P><EM>Your name is being called by sacred things<BR>  That are not addressed
nor listened to</EM></P>
<P>Such experiences are possible for someone going through spiritual emergency.

</P>
<P><EM>Sometimes they blow trumpets</EM></P>
<P>Sometimes things get so intense that you crumble to dust, or completely
break  down. 
</P>
<P><EM>Only wanna help you <BR> Never wanna hurt you<BR>  I know I could be
good for you</EM></P>
<P>The psychiatrist is getting more desperate. 
</P>
<P><EM>Oh my God it's a jungle in here <BR> You've got wild animals loose in
here </EM></P>
<P>People going through spiritual emergency sometimes have experiences of 
encounters with wild animals, and dying as a result of it. This could be
experiences  from a previous life surfacing. 
</P>
<P><EM>Wanna help you <BR> Never hurt you <BR> Good for you</EM></P>
<P>The psychiatrist just keeps repeating the same old stuff. 
</P>
<P><EM>Hey all you little waves run away <BR> Hmm run away</EM></P>
<P>This last bit is about the good results of the spiritual emergency. The old 
materialistic value system is rejected for something better. This is also
reflected in  the music at this point, which gets more gentle. 
</P>

<BR> Subject: Big Stripy Interpretation 
</P>
<P>Hiya kids. albert philipsen and I have been debating the various
interpretations of  big stripy lie in email. I've decided to share my lengthy
opinion on the subject with  y'all because I'm sure it's accurate :) 
</P>
<P>Basically, imagine Person A who is in totally in love with Emotionally
Damaged  Person B. Person B suffers from the usual glut of dysfunctions: fear of
committment,  fear of intimacy, disbelief in the permanence of love, etc. Person
B is likely to run  away rather than get involved with someone even if they find
that someone really  wonderful. It's too painful to open yourself up and risk
that sort of trauma again:  &quot;life is sad and so is love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Person A is the narrator of Big Stripy Lie: 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;big stripy lie moving like a wavy line coming up behind&quot;</EM>
</P>
<P>you're involved with someone, but always hanging in the distance is this
threat that  the person involved will succumb to his/her fear of committment and
run away -  the &quot;big stripy lie&quot; is something like &quot;i love you,
we'll be together forever&quot; - it's  bullshit, but you don't want to believe
it, so this lie just hangs over the whole deal  like a dark shadow. 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;all young gentle dreams drowning in life's grief/can you hang on
to me?&quot;</EM> 
</P>
<P>well, when you're young they tell you that love is beautiful and lasts
forever and  solves all your problems. you grow up to find that that's a load of
crap. hence the  young gentle dreams drowning. the narrator (presumably the less
dysfunctional  member of the relationship) is saying &quot;i see what's going on
here, but can't you  try to hang on to me? i'll keep you from drowning, really.
believe in me. i know  you've been hurt before, but this time will be different.&quot;

</P>
<P><EM>&quot;don't want to hurt you baby/i only want to help you/i could be
good for you&quot;</EM> 
</P>
<P>sung in a different voice - the voice of reason has failed, so Person A, who
is  apparently very much in love with Dysfunctional Person B just screams at
them -  &quot;don't want to hurt you&quot;, etc. you think you can overcome
years of trauma just by  yelling loud enough. it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;your name is being called by sacred things that are not addressed
or listened  to/sometimes they blow trumpets&quot;</EM> 
</P>
<P>already gone over this - the sacred things are love, committment, etc.
Person B is just  ignoring it, despite the fact that they are clamoring for
attention (blowing trumpets). 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;only want to help you&quot;</EM> 
</P>
<P>the screaming voice again, see above. 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;oh my god it's a jungle in here/you've got wild animals loose in
here&quot; </EM>
</P>
<P>Person A begins to realize that the psyche of Dysfunctional Person B is a
mess. DP  B might even recognize and admit this but still be unable to deal.
Person A is  shocked - can people *really* be so messed up? 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;want to help you/never hurt you/good for you&quot;</EM> 
</P>
<P>the screaming voice again - notice how it's getting more desperate? it's not
even  talking in complete sentences now, just fragments. 
</P>
<P><EM>&quot;hey all you little waves run away/mmm run away&quot;</EM> 
</P>
<P>this one puzzles me - either Person A is telling the &quot;little waves&quot;
to run away (ie:  make the &quot;water&quot; that is drowning DPB recede) or
they are learning to live with  the fact that DPB will run away from again
because the possibility of  committment is just too scary. either way, it still
fits with the overall  interpretation. 
</P>
<P>There you have it. What do you think?
