<P>I think the line that is hard to hear in TRS goes:  
</P>
<P>&quot;The minute I put them on, I knew I had done something wrong. All her
gifts for  the dance had gone, the red shoes can't stop dancing&quot; 
</P>
<P>So that after the brilliant dancer tricks her into taking the shoes, she
finds they  do not confer the same gifts on her. A little like putting on
dragon-scale armor only  to discover it is cursed (for any little ole role game
players out there).

<BR> Subject: Phone ringing on &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; track 
</P>
<P>This is going to sound strange, but has anyone else been listening to &quot;The
Red  Shoes&quot; with headphones on and had the volume up so lound that you
couldn't hear  anything else. I have and everytime I listen to this track I can
swear I hear a phone  ringing. The first couple times this happened, I just
thought it was the phone in my  room. But then I played the song while my
roomate was in the room and the same  thing happened. He said the phone didn't
ring. So that means that the sound is  maybe a phone ringing in the background
when the song was recorded. Does  anyone have any comments on this. By the way,
I got my copy Saturday and have  been listening to it for the last 36 hours
basically nonstop. And I'm enjoying every  second of it. All the songs are
perfect even &quot;Why Should I Love You&quot;. I don't see  why very many other
people don't like. That's only my opinion.

</P>
<P>The phone ring I hear most clearly is in Constellation of the Heart, at 2:53
into  the song. It's actually the funky organ sound that's behind the song, but
it hits just  the right tone there. It's possible that KaTe uses the organ other
places, and that's  why you hear it more than one place.

<P>Possible answer to this: 
</P>
<P>On my synthesizer I have a sound (called &quot;Bell&quot; I think) which,
when I play it  back after recording, sounds very much like a phone ringing.
It's kind of an  after-effect, and I only notice toward the end of my
recordings. It has also caused me  to remove my headphones and listen for the
telephone. Could this be caused by a  synth sound that Kate uses on that track?

Subject: new Kate UK single... 
</P>
<P>Hi... It seems like the folks at EMI UK have had a difficult time getting
their act  together! 
</P>
<P>I'm not sure if this has been posted yet or not, but it looks like the plans
to  release &quot;And So Is Love&quot; as the next single have been scrapped.
Since the video for  the song was seen on MTV, maybe it is still going to be a
single in the US, but I  don't know for sure.. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, the new UK single is &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and it's going to be
released as a  regular CD single, and a limited edition CD single with a
different track listing. I  don't know what the tracks are, but I can't wait to
find out... I think the release  date for the singles is April 5th, but I'm not
completely sure of that. It's about  time!!!

<P>Hi!

<P>Yesterday I got a letter from the KBC (SAE 3), containing two important
sheets of  paper: 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>The new British single THE RED SHOES will be released on 5th April. Together
 with a new track YOU WANT ALCHEMY it will be available on 7&quot; vinyl,
cassette  and CD. The CD will also contain 2 other tracks - the video mix of 
CLOUDBUSTING and the single mix of THIS WOMAN'S WORK. The following  week
another CD will be released. The main track will be SHOEDANCE, an  extended
dance mix. The other 2 tracks on this will be THE BIG SKY single mix  and
RUNNING UP THAT HILL 12&quot; version. The single in Europe and Australasia

</P>
<P>At the time of sending this we do not have full details of video airplay but
we do  know that The Red Shoes single video will be shown on ITV's Chart Show on
2nd  April and hopefully on quite a lot of other regional programmes so watch
out. We  will not be doing a mail out with these details as we rarely know far
enough in  advance.

</P>
<P>&gt; With all this quarreling I still don't have the answer to previous
questions like  what's being said on the Shoedance remix by those two voices. 
</P>
<P>That's a scene from the film after Miranda Richardson enters through the 
mirror and wants to make Kate draw the line, the cross and the curve. Lindsay 
Kemp also says something in there which is a) not understandable and b) (IMHO) 
not very relevant (I didn't understand it anyway...). I didn't understand some 
things, especially in the beginning when Miranda is quite hectic in trying to
explain  how she came there. 
</P>
<P>M: What am I here? I don't[?] want[?] to be here. I don't understand how
this has   happened. 
</P>
<P>K: What the hell is going on - look without[?]. 
</P>
<P>M: Oh please! You must help me. 
</P>
<P>K: What have you done to yourself? 
</P>
<P>M: There was an accident, a big fire. I looked[?] over[?] me, my hands are
all   burned and blistered. There was so much smoke I couldn't believe it. I
could, I   was trying to find my way out of for years[?]. You must help me! Help
me... 
</P>
<P>K: How can I help you? 
</P>
<P>M: I can't use my hands. I can't use my hands, I have to get back ... back
...  home  ... There is only one moment left for me to return. And it lies in
your hands now. 
</P>
<P>K: Don't worry, you'll get home! 
</P>
<P>M: You need three pieces of paper. 
</P>
<P>K: There's some on the piano. Will this do? 
</P>
<P>M: Yes. You draw a line on the first piece. 
</P>
<P>K: Like this? 
</P>
<P>M: Yes ... A cross ... 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>M: Good! ... A Curve ... 
</P>
<P>K: Here. 
</P>
<P>M: Thank you. Is there somehting I can give you in return? The red shoes
perhaps? 
</P>
<P>K: The pretty red shoes? 
</P>
<P>M: Take them, they're yours. As a gift. Gimme a cause.

<P>I've put in a couple of corrections above, and during the song Lindsey says:

</P>
<P>&quot;It's really happening to ya!&quot; 
</P>
<P>and then in the dialogue at the end he says 
</P>
<P>&quot;She tricked ya y'know?&quot; 
</P>
<P>and then goes into some spiel about singing back the symbols. These two
lines of  his are heavily repeated in the Shoedance mix of the single. 
</P>
<P>In fact the line &quot;She tricked ya y'know?&quot; is the key to Miranda's
behaviour. All  the stuff about the fire and her hands is a deceit to make Kate
write out the symbols  that will release Mirranda from the spell that binds the
shoes to her feet. By writing  out the symbols and giving them to the victim the
spell is transferred.
