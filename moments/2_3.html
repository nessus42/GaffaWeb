<P>Date: Thu, 09 Sep 1993 04:23:11 -0400 (EDT) <BR> From:
nrc@bsbbs.columbus.oh.us (N. Richard Caldwell) <BR> Subject: The Red Shoes:
First Impressions! </P>
<P>We've heard it. Yep, the whole darned thing. The Red Shoes. What do we
think?  Well read on if you don't mind spoilers... </P>
<P>But first let's talk about this single, &quot;Eat the Music.&quot; At first
glance this thing  looks like something by Carcass. It's not particularly
attractive. If this is Kate's idea  of fruit cocktail I think I'll pass. </P>
<P>&quot;Eat the Music&quot; is pretty much what I expected from some of the
comments here,  &quot;mostly harmless.&quot; The latin beat doesn't bother me,
it's just not particularly  interesting. The lyrics don't do much for me either
but I think we'll give this one a  bit more time to simmer before giving it a
thumbs up or down. If nothing else, it's  great to hear some actual brass
instruments in there instead of cheesy synth sounds. </P>
<P>Whoever decided to put the 12&quot; mix of &quot;Eat the Music&quot; right
after the original cut  should be removed immediately. It's like those mock
Monty Python endings, &quot;and  now for your listening pleasure, 9 *more*
minutes of &quot;Eat the Music.&quot; The difference  is that the extra Monty
Python bits where always interesting. So at this point I was  starting to get
concerned. I desperately want to like this new album and this single  wasn't
pushing any buttons either way. </P>
<P>Then &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; comes crunching and grinding in. Yow! Kate
referees a  grunge match between Neil Young and Nigel Kennedy? Huh? I have no
idea what  this is about yet but I love it. I just have to be sure to hit stop
before &quot;Candle in the  Wind&quot; starts which is a shame because you
really need some time to recover from  &quot;Big Stripey Lie.&quot; </P>
<P>Now I feel a bit better. My faith in Kate's ability to do something new and 
exciting, I'm ready to give &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; a fair listen. </P>
<P>Here are some very preliminary thoughts on the new album based on a first 
listening (and before you ask, no, we can't make copies). My impressions are
still  pretty sketchy, opinions are still under construction. </P>
<P>First up is &quot;Rubberband Girl.&quot; This one is good fun. I don't
understand why on  earth they didn't go with this for a single in the US.
Someone at Columbia needs to  go back to the mail room. Besides, the &quot;HIkeeba!&quot;
picture in the &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;  ad is much more pleasant to look at
than traumatically bisected produce. </P>
<P>&quot;Moments of Pleasure,&quot; as seen on TV. It's growing on me. Very
nice. </P>
<P>&quot;Song of Solomon&quot; Hmmmmmmmm hmmmmm. Don't want your bullshit, just
 want your sexuality? Is this the male or female speaking? I don't know, but
it's an  interesting song. This song includes some harmonies that are either the
Trio  Bulgarka or Kate doing a very good imitation. The good news is that it's
much more  subtle than on &quot;The Sensual World.&quot; (Not that I don't love
some of the unsubtle  parts they did on TSW, but I really didn't need any more
of the The Sensual World  sound on this album, thanks. On this track Kate even
seems to recall that you don't  have to use all 48 tracks all the way through
the song. </P>
<P>&quot;Lily&quot; starts with an old woman talking cosmic religiony stuff and
the song goes  on about protecting oneself in life with a ring of fire. Gabriel
in before, Rapheal  behind, Micheal to the right, someone else (Eurial?) to the
the left. Hmmm,  somehow I doubt that Kate is singing about Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles... </P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; tells the story of the red shoes, probably the
movie version. At  the start this sounds a lot like one of Caterwaul's mandolin
songs or Heart's &quot;Sylvan  Song.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Top of the City&quot; sounds like a fairly standard &quot;person looks
out across the city,  longing for their lost love&quot; track. No opinion, yet.
</P>
<P>&quot;Constellation of the Heart&quot; Turn the telescopes inside out and
point them away  from the Big Sky? Kinda nice, very poppy, dancey track. </P>
<P>&quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot; drips purple Prince ooze from every
chorus. And no, I  don't mean that in a derogatory way. It's a pretty good
track, actually. </P>
<P>&quot;You're The One.&quot; One word: wow. Kate rocks her blues to a lighter
shade of  pale, sits in with the Trio and jams with one of the guitar gods.
Awesome track! I  only wish it had an ending. I generally hate it when songs
fade out and this is even  worse because this song cries out for some kind of
ending. </P>
<P>Our overall impression? Very positive. Nobody is likely to compare this
album to  Kate's best work but we think it's a step forward from TSW. Lyrically
we'll have  to wait and see but musically I think Kate makes better use of her
voice and has  done some more interesting arrangements. I really couldn't judge
much about the  engineering in that first listen but perhaps that's a good sign.
</P>
<P>Did anyone notice that Love Hounds are mentioned in the promotional flyer
that  Columbia has circulated to retailers? More on that tomorrow. </P>

<P>Date: Thu, 23 Sep 1993 04:01:56 -0400 (EDT) <BR> From:
nrc@bsbbs.columbus.oh.us (N. Richard Caldwell) <BR> Subject: Re: Kate Reviews
(and more Red Shoes Impressions) </P>
<P>Top of the City. </P>
<P>Growing on me rapidly, very sad and probably very personal.  I wonder if
this song is referring to a specific place. </P>
<P>&quot;Take me up to the top of the city <BR> And put me up on the angel's
shoulders&quot; </P>
<P>This would be the highest point in some city, evidently with angel
sculptures of  some kind. &quot;Put me up on the angel's shoulders&quot; could
just be a metaphor but I  think it's supposed to be literal as well. She'd like
to get up to the highest point in  the city on this sculpture, but she would
also like to be up on the angel's shoulders  to see what her loved one is up to
now (&quot;she's no good for you, baby&quot;). </P>
<P>&gt; Oh, one of the lines in TRS is.. </P>
<P>&quot;And this curve... it's your smile... and this cross... it's your
heart...  and this line... it's your path&quot;. </P>
<P>Punctuated with some strange vocal noises. This album has lots of those 
interesting background vocals that you have to spend some time decoding. </P>
<P>My favorite so far is &quot;You're The One,&quot; another sad one. If this
song is as  personal as it seems, it's difficult to imagine Kate actually
working with Del on the song. </P>
<P>&quot;It's alright I'll come round when you're not in<BR>  And I'll pick up
all my things&quot; </P>
<P>The song opens with this dramatic phrase and goes on to build an almost 
desperate sense of loss before fading out. I mentioned before that I don't care
for  the fade out but fade-outs always seemed to me to indicate to me that the
feelings or  issues in a song remain unresolved and that may be appropriate for
this song. Still, I  think the song fades out a bit too early. </P>
<P>Another favorite is &quot;Lily&quot; the song that may be Kate's latest &quot;how
do I protect my  space&quot; song. This time, Lily advices to protect yourself
with fire and a formidable  collection of guardian angels. I mentioned a spoken
part at the beginning. Here it is,  most of it is pretty clear. I'm uncertain of
the last word... </P>
<P> Oh thou, who giveth sustenance to the universe<BR>  from whom all things
proceed <BR> to whom all things return <BR> unveil to us the face of the true
spiritual son <BR> hidden by a disc of golden light<BR>  that we may know the
trueth <BR> and do our whole duty <BR> as we journey to thy sacred f(ield?)
</P>
<P>I can't wait to hear what you folks think of &quot;Constellation of the
Heart.&quot; Missy  pointed out that this track sounds more than a little like
something from Tori Amos'  &quot;Y Kant Tori Read.&quot; Very dance poppy but
still lots of fun. There is a long part at the  end where Kate has a dialog with
her chorus. Kate's part is on the right... </P>
<P>Think you'd better wake up, captain, <BR> there's something happening up
ahead. <BR> We've never seen anything like it. <BR> We've never seen anything
like it before. <BR>
<EM>I want a full report </EM><BR> That's it. <BR>
<EM>What do you mean, that's it?</EM> <BR> Thats all you get, you'd better do
something about it. <BR>
<EM>What am I s'posed to do about it?</EM> <BR> We don't know, but you can't
run away from it. Maybe you'd better face it.<BR> 
<EM>I can't do that </EM><BR> Come on face it. <BR> etc </P>

<P>From: kuyper@aim1.aztec.co.za (Kuyper Hoffman) <BR> Date: Wed, 27 Oct 93
23:24:32 SAT <BR> Subject: tRS Released in South Africa </P>
<P>Let's face it, one way to make yourself unpopular is to make statements like
 &quot;Well, I guess I'm the first person in the Southern Hemisphere to buy The
Red  Shoes - heck possibly in the world!!&quot; even if it's probably not
strictly true :-) </P>
<P>Well at about noon (GMT) on Wed 27 Oct 1993 I walked out of Digital Music
with  my very own copy. I didn't know a Moto Guzzi 500 could pull moves like
that on my  journey to the nearest CD player. </P>
<P>Opening the packaging revealed a rather interesting CD pamphlet. Not your 
usual &quot;page-through-me&quot; affair, but rather a mini poster folded into
12. Hooray an  even number, and it matches the number of tracks on the album.
</P>
<P>One side shows KaTe being held up by (I guess) one of the dancers from the
EtM  vid. At the bottom are the production credits and the Thanks list. The
album is  dedicated to the late Hannah Bush. </P>
<P>The other side carries the lyrics. The first six are in order of appearance
on the  CD, but then follow a rather wierd pattern. What with the release being
so close,  it's not worth it for me to list all the lyrics here (apart from all
that typing - yikes!).  The lyrics are printed pretty small, and repeated
folding is going to make some lines  unreadable. They're printed in semi-opaque
dark-grey boxes on a background of  fruit. All the fruit has been neatly cut in
half. Photo credits again go to John Carder  Bush / Kindlight. </P>
<P>Unable to wait any longer at that stage I hurriedly put the disc on and
waited.  Rats, RbG is the first track - &quot;I've already heard this one, shall
I press skip, no  damnit, get a grip on yourself, listen to it properly&quot;.
</P>
<P>Somewhere I pressed STOP to see the running time (55:30) and then resumed
play. </P>
<P>Then comes And So is Love. No real comments at this stage. </P>
<P>Having only heard EtM 2wice on the radio (nothing was released here as a
single,  and I was only able to obtain the RbG single) I really enjoyed hearing
it with REAL  BASS. It's rythmns are so African and I later had it's sound
compared to that of a  local Cross-over band appropriately called &quot;Magno
Groove&quot; whom you may have seen  in a live crossing to Johannesburg during
an AIDS concert (in Wembley?) where  George Michael took lead vocals in Queen
(for the first time?). They also crossed to  U2 in LA, but I was disappointed.
BUT I digress. </P>
<P>The quiet bits of MoP remind me of TWW - just an observation. </P>
<P>I'm still getting used to The Song of Solomon &amp; Lily. </P>
<P>The title track - now there's one I know I like. I can't sit still during
this one  (well I guess the story really works). I just feel like leaping about
- not club stuff,  but a real head-nodder. More Valiha on this one, with Paddy
adding some whistles  and a Musical Bow. The whistles kinda make me think of
Jethro Tull. I'd like to  hear this one on the radio. </P>
<P>Top of the City slows it all down again (relatively to tRS). Followed by 
Constellation of the Heart. Again, still working out what I think of these. </P>
<P>BSL has been done to death on Love-Hounds, so I'll just mention it together
with  an answer to my own question of a few weeks ago -KaTe's the one on guitar.
She  makes a few guitar appearances, is this new? </P>
<P>It all rounds off with Why Should I Love You? and You're the One. </P>
<P>Much of this is going to take a good few repeated listens to get used to,
but I  definitely like it. </P>
<P>Clapton appears on: And so is Love <BR> Beck on: You're the One. <BR>
Nigel Kennedy: Top of the City &amp; BSL<BR>  Prince: Why Should I Love You?
Lenny Henry also does vocals on this one. <BR> Gary Brooker: And so is Love,
Constellation &amp; You're the One (still sounds like  his days in Procol, or
maybe that's just the Hammond) </P>
<P>Now to explain how I got it.... Well I can't - EMI in South Africa decided
that 25  Oct was a good release date, and it was in the stores today (possibly
even yesterday).  My copy is a full UK import (both booklet and CD). </P>
<P>I have delayed going on holiday until I had the album and had listened to it
a few  times, so tomorrow I'm off on my Bike. Any flames and other hate-mail
will  therefore only be read in about 2 weeks :-) </P>
<P>I hope you all enjoy tRS when your copies arrive. Only problem now is this
one  and my 2 singles don't fit in my TWW box ;-) It's tough at the top! </P>
<P>Cheers Kuyper </P>

<P>I hate those things. Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em. Anybody who comes up with
 a design like that doesn't look through their CD booklets much. They rarely fit
 neatly into the liner notes slot and folding and unfolding these things more
than a  few times tears them all up. </P>
<P>&gt; The other side carries the lyrics. The first six are in order of
appearance on the  CD, but then follow a rather wierd pattern. </P>
<P>Interesting. There are six songs supposedly included in the video, including
most,  but not all, of the first six tracks. The six songs on the video are
split on the CD by  &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot; I guess it's possible that SoS
could appear in the film without a  full fledged video, but this series of songs
just doesn't make sense to me for the  film. Why would &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;
appear last in the sequence if this reflected their  order in the film? What is
the &quot;wierd pattern&quot; of the second six lyrics? Where does  TRS fall in
this order? </P>
<P>&gt; lines unreadable. They're printed in semi-opaque dark-grey boxes on a 
background of fruit. All the fruit has been neatly cut in half. Photo credits
again go  to John Carder Bush / Kindlight. </P>
<P>Kind of a shame that the packaging would be inspired by the least inspiring
track  on the album. </P>
<P>&gt; Then comes And So is Love. No real comments at this stage. </P>
<P>Just say, &quot;Great.&quot; That covers it. This is a theme that seems to
pop up a lot in the  album. Life is sad and so is love, says Kate. Yet she told
one interviewer that she saw  this as being positive (another one of these
deals). I guess you could say so if you  look at it from the aspect that life
and love are hard at times, but it's still worth it all  and still we continue
on. </P>
<P>&gt; I'm still getting used to The Song of Solomon &amp; Lily. </P>
<P>Great and great. </P>
<P>&gt; The title track - now there's one I know I like. I can't sit still
during this one  (well I guess the story really works). I just feel like leaping
about - not club stuff,  but a real head-nodder. More Valiha on this one, with
Paddy adding some whistles  and a Musical Bow. The whistles kinda make me think
of Jethro Tull. I'd like to  hear this one on the radio. </P>
<P>The whistles have a very medieval feel, like some of Jethro Tull or Ian
Anderson's work. </P>
<P>&gt; Top of the City slows it all down again (relatively to tRS).</P>
<P>Slows it down, but cranks up the intensity as it goes on. The desperation in
this  song is incredible. It's a good thing they didn't get it too close to &quot;You're
the One.&quot;  The commulative desperation would have had folks out on ledges
all over the world. </P>
<P>I DON'T CARE IF IT'S RAININ' <BR> I DON'T CARE IF IT'S DANGEROUS <BR> JUST
TAKE ME UP TO THE TOP OF THE CITY </P>
<P>The caps are a must here. </P>
<P>&gt; Followed by Constellation of the Heart. Again, still working out what I
think of these.
</P>
<P>What's to figure out? This is, without question, Kate's tribute to Y Kant
Tori  Read. This track might seem like a throw-away at first but it really says
something  about the whole tone of the album. &quot;Looking at the big sky&quot;
is all well and good but  at some point you need to turn that telescope around
and look at what's going on  inside. This album seems to be the product of just
such a self-examination. </P>
<P>&gt; BSL has been done to death on Love-Hounds, so I'll just mention it
together  with an answer to my own question of a few weeks ago - KaTe's the one
on guitar.  She makes a few guitar appearances, is this new? </P>
<P>Wha?! Kate on guitar? Are we talking about the *lead* guitar on this track?
If  Kate went from not playing (that I know of) to playing *that well* in just
four years,  she may be a goddess after all. </P>
<P>&gt; Much of this is going to take a good few repeated listens to get used
to, but I  definitely like it. </P>
<P>Toldja! </P>
<P>&gt; I hope you all enjoy tRS when your copies arrive. </P>
<P>Done did. The CD should arrive just in time for this tape to wear out
completely. :-) </P>

<P>Date: Fri, 29 Oct 93 01:27 MET <BR> From: uli@zoodle.robin.de (Ulrich
Grepel) <BR> Subject: The Red Shoes - it's here, it's here :-) :-) :-) </P>
<P>HI! </P>
<P>Today (well, yesterday, anyhow: on October 28, 1993) the new album by Kate 
Bush, The Red Shoes, appeared in the shops in Germany. I checked two of them, 
both in Frankfurt. The first one (Virgin Megastore) had 173 (174 before I came) 
copies of the CD. Counted 'em. The second one (WOM) had a few less (about 25), 
but nevertheless it was there. Cheaper than at Virgin (Grrrr...), but what do I 
complain - 4 years of waiting finally came to an end! </P>
<P>Anyhow - I had a copy of the album on tape for about 2 1/2 weeks now (thanks
 to you know who), but it is always better to hear it from CD instead of an nth 
generation tape (THANKS nevertheless!), and especially to have the lyrics sheet.
As  I reported last Friday (Saturday, ok) the booklet actually is a small poster
of 3x4 the  size of a booklet. Side one contains the title picture, the album
credits and a poster  with Kate and Stewart Arnold (?) Side two contains a BIG
BUNCH of fruits and the  lyrics. </P>
<P>The KT-symbol is really easy to find. As reported earlier it's directly
below the  lower shoe of the title picture, turned about 90 degrees clockwise
and a bit bent. No  secret here, it's really toooo easy. The title of the album
appears above, the name of  Kate below the round picture, as seen in all German
and English ads I've seen. Not  like in the letter sized US promo sheet for the
album that I received today (thanks  Suzanne!), as there the places are
exchanged. </P>
<P>I already hacked in all the lyrics and the credits, they follow in a second
message.  Errors there are not always mine - check out for example the credits
to John  Carder: &quot;Photograpy&quot; without the second 'h'! Please check
this out as soon as you  find your version of the album - it'd be interesting if
they correct this someday.  (How about a 'first pressing' check?) Most other
errors are probably mine. </P>
<P>I'd say that the album is QUITE interesting lyrically. If Kate and Del
really broke  up then it is BY FAR Kate's most personal album so far. If not -
then it's not about  her! </P>
<P>BTW: Del is not playing any instrument anywhere on the album, he's credited
as  recorder and mixer and Fairlight programmer, and he's thanked. </P>
<P>Somehow I just knew the dedication line beforehand. I would have been 
disappointed if it wasn't this one (or one to the same effect). </P>
<P>Now you want to know how the album is? GREAT! Listen to it! Try it out!
Check  it out! (But I surely don't have to tell you all this...) I'm pretty bad
in describing  music, so I will let others do this job. Hey, therefore I am a
quick typist! </P>
<P>I think I know the next Kate Bush Club quiz question: Name all the fruits
you  can find on the album! </P>
<P>I can't wait for a certain entry to the famous PMRC list of Kate's songs
that  should be banned... Or rather more than one entry. </P>
<P>Bye, Uli </P>

thoughts </P>
<P>G'day all! </P>
<P>What a great few days! I've been off the air at the Mac World Expo in
Sydney. I  took my TRS tape with me (as well as my new copy of HomeGround #49
that had  arrived the day before, nice one Peter, Krys and Dave) but replaced
that the first day  with my own copy of the CD! :-) I didn't get much of a
chance to listen to the CD  all that day as I was busy with the Expo and then a
night out on the town with some  friends. You know how it is when something's
just fall into place, like they're just  meant to be? Well the place we all hit
for our dinner played right through 'The  Whole Story' whilst we ate. Buy time I
got back to the hotel I was tired, sore and  very sated. I lay back, turned the
lights off and listen to TRS (very loud) over  headphones. To quote her
goddessness ... &quot;Hmmmm yess...&quot; :-) The whole album  seemed to just
click for me. Till that point there were certain songs that I'd kind of  switch
off to when they came around ('Why Should I Love You' being the main  one) It's
amazing just how much you can pick out of the music when you're in that  sort of
frame of mind. Just let yourself fall into the songs. </P>
<P>It looks like everyone has been very busy whilst I've been away! </P>
<P>Kent sez... </P>
<P>&gt;Now, I have to go back and listen to it again to see if I can figure out
what's  being said behind &quot;Oh my God it's a jungle in here, you've got wild
animals loose in  here&quot; on BSL. (Still haven't figured out the 1st
interjection on RBG.) </P>
<P>I like KT's Kookaburra laugh right after she says &quot;you've got wild
animals loose  in here&quot;. As for what is said behind that whole verse, I
can't make it out at all. Also  there is a funny &quot;beep&quot; to be heard at
about 2:47 into BSL which sounds for all the  world to be a Mac beep. :-) I
noticed this just now whilst I was listening to the CD  over my Mac and reading
the news. I'm flicking the CD backward and forward and  I get this sound like a
system alert, but there is no alert! </P>
<P>Peter Fitzgerald-Morris sez... </P>
<P>&gt;She has clearly taught Kate Dion Fortune's cut down version of the
lesser ritual  of the pentagram - a potent method of defence against psychic
attack. </P>
<P>Stephen reminded me of another good description of this sort of thing from
the  Deverry series written by Katharine Kerr. The series as based deeply in
Celtic  mythos. The character Nevyn utilises the visualisation of the circle or
pentagram of  fyre (or light) guarded at four points by the Lords of Wyrd to
protect himself and  friends from 'psychic' harm. </P>
<P>Has anybody noticed what KT screams just after the 'Grrrrrr, this is my
space'  in Lily? In the left channel she screams 'Who's at left?&quot; and then
in the right  channel she screams 'Who's at right?' :-) The problem is I can't
understand what  is said about 3:25 into the track. It's in the middle of the
repeated chorus, just before  she sings 'Raphael behind me'. It sounds like (and
please don't flame me) 'Yeah  INX' !!! Anybody got any ideas about that one?
</P>
<P>She REALLY is... :-) </P>

<BR> Subject: TRS gets better/how to enjoy ETM </P>
<P>I've been listening to TRS over the weekend and I'm starting to like it more
and  more. I'd have to agree with Vickie... I don't know how people can be so
sure of  their opinions after such a short listening span. I'm also really
tempted to post a  song-by-song commentary but until I can hear each song
distinctly in my brain  without tuning on my CD player, I don't feel qualified.
</P>
<P>I will say something about Eat the Music, however, which has gotten lots of 
bashing. I'll admit that the basic musical tenant of the song is very simple,
but the  interesting thing to me is 1) Kate's vocals, and moreover 2) the
pattern of backing  vocals. Listen carefully to how the call and response works.
</P>
<P>Split me open / oo oo oooaaa ooo<BR> blah blah blah blah / oo oo oooaaaa
ooo<BR> ditty dit dit / ooaa oooaaoo ooo <BR> etc. </P>
<P>These littles responses (the BV ooo aaa ooo's) change slightly every other
time or  so, and I find that if I listen closely to these they reflect great
musical thinking. How  did she decide how to move the ooos up or down this time
or that time. This is very  subtle, but if you listen carefully you will see how
these ooo's are the genius in this  song. They take a simple melody and make it
move and sway and focus. I don't care  how much you hate the song. Just give it
a listen and concentrate on the call and  response of Kate's voice interacting
with the BVs. I find this fascinating every time.  Also, if you try and predict
what the next oooo will be, you be wrong most of the  time. </P>

Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: TRS Tracklist
</P>
<P>Maybe it was Richard Caldwell, I can't remember, but somebody the other week
 mentioned that they were experimenting with playing Side B of the new album
with  the tracks in the order in which the lyrics appear on the UK album
slipcover (or  EMI CD foldout). </P>
<P>Well, whoever you are, you found the secret. The folded sheet for the US 
Sony/Columbia CD looks to be a last-minute fudge: the fruit in the background is
 b&amp;w, and the lyrics are scattered out of any order at all--much less the
clear SideA  Side B structure of the album. But on the liner for the 12&quot;
vinyl album, and on the  folded sheet for the EMI CD (background in color, and
much heavier stock) it is  completely clear that there is a very formal Side
A/Side B construction for this set,  and that the original track order for Side
B was: </P>
<OL>
<LI>The Red Shoes     </LI>
<LI>Top of the City     </LI>
<LI>You're the One     </LI>
<LI>Big Stripey Lie     </LI>
<LI>Why Should I Love You?     </LI>
<LI>Constellation of the Heart </LI></OL>
<P>I very strongly suggest programming your CD player to play the songs in this
 sequence, making the tape for the car in this sequence, and thinking about the
songs  and the album as a whole with this sequence. </P>
<P>This is so clearly the artist's intention that I'm not even going to take
time to  comment on it now. Kate let marketing people overrule her about the UK
single  (&quot;Eat the Music&quot; was always the single in her mind, it
appears), and she let them  have their way on the Side B tracklist too. I can
hear what they were telling her:  &quot;TotC and YtO are two quiet songs back to
back, and WSILY and CotH are two  funky ones back to back; mix 'em up!&quot; She
knew that the real tracklist had already  gone to print, so what the hell, why
fight it. Those of us who pay attention had  already been alerted. </P>
<P>The album can't end with &quot;You're the One,&quot; because then it would
be lyrically  completely disconsolate, whereas musically it is stunningly strong
and collaborative  and healing. If you don't have the UK CD or vinyl releases to
guide you on this  question, just try this order for Side B out and see if it
doesn't solve a lot of  problems. The core discovery: &quot;You're the One&quot;
is answered by &quot;Big Stripey Lie.&quot; </P>

completely outweighed by the musical  sense, IMHO. The decider for me is &quot;You're

70s,  noone would have even considered playing WSoP anything other than last.

<P>My personal opinion is that the lyrics are arranged on the lyric sheet the

<P>I agree, but that's the way it is, if you just read the lyric sheet. I think
the  musical references transform the lyrics substantially. I have my own ideas
on this,  but I'm afraid I can't share them with the list, because they're too
personal. </P>

<P>Bravo, Graham! IED was wondering when someone would finally calm down  from
the initial adolescent impulse to trash (mindlessly) Kate's new music long 
enough to start LISTENING to it -- and thus to notice, for example, the three  &quot;buried&quot;
spoken messages in &quot;Lily&quot;, which IED has been trying to make out for
days  now. He almost agrees with you about the first two, but he believes the
full lines are  something like &quot;Here's Michael on your right!&quot; and &quot;Uriel
on your left!&quot; or  something like that. As for the third, later line, it
stands out very clearly as a spoken  sentence, but IED has yet to make out a
single word. There are also messages on  other tracks, he believes. </P>
<P>As well as a touching inscription on the run-out groove of the vinyl LP,
which  Kate almost certainly etched herself. </P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick (IED) </P>
<P>Btw, the album is inarguably the greatest piece of recorded music to be
released  in at least the last four years. All posted attempts to convince
otherwise have thus far  failed miserably, and have succeeded only in bringing
shame and ridicule upon their  authors. It's interesting to see with what
desperate, passionate, feverish energy  these persons rush to announce their
boredom, indifference and disinterest.  Meanwhile, of course, they fail utterly
to see the Face of the Sun which shines so  brilliantly above them all the
while... </P>

Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: Re: TRS
Tracklist </P>
<P>Craig Heath replies to my suggestion that the track order for Side B of TRS 
suggested by the UK lyric sheets reflects Kate's original intention: </P>
<P>&gt; ... I vehemently disagree with this. I think, musically, the tracks as
they are  ordered on the CD are in perfect arrangement. I can see there is an
argument for  the lyrics making more sense in the lyric sheet order, but this is
completely  outweighed by the musical sense, IMHO. </P>
<P>He provides a very telling (but not, in my view, decisive) illustration of
this last  consideration, but I need to take a point he makes later first
because the physical  evidence is actually more ambiguous than I had realized
when I posted. </P>
<P>&gt;My personal opinion is that the lyrics are arranged on the lyric sheet
the way  they are simply because they wouldn't have fit the space in a pleasing
manner if  they had been in the proper order (and I'm not going to believe that
Kate had more  control over the lyric sheet than she did over the track order on
CD). </P>
<P>I hadn't meant to suggest that Kate did not control the final track order -
of  course she did, and in that sense it is certainly authoritative. My argument
was that  the track order on the album slipcover suggested that at one stage she
had had a  different order in mind, and was talked into the one released by
marketing  considerations. I would never have entertained such an idea for an
instant if we  hadn't learned through Del Palmer that something precisely like
that happened  with RBG as the first UK single, rather than EtM which she
preferred. And I should  add that even if another order was once contemplated
this one clearly must have  things in its favor, too. </P>
<P>Obviously my whole argument depends on the premise that the order in which 
the lyrics are arranged on the slipcover is meant to correspond to the playing 
sequence. It certainly looks that way, since the Side A lyrics are in six black
boxes  across the top, in playing sequence, and the Side B lyrics are in six
black boxes  below them, in playing sequence except for the reversed positions
of YtO and CotH.  Craig is right that in the particular format of the design,
the lyrics box for CotH  wouldn't fit under the box for EtM that would be above
it. I would answer that the  design could be adapted in all sorts of ways to
work around that, and why arrange  the lyrics in two sets of six that match the
album contents exactly (except for the one  switch) in the first place, if you
don't intend people to assume that they follow the  playlist? </P>
<P>BUT! I now see that the order of the Side B lyrics on the UK CD foldout
(which  folds out to be 12 times larger and has the background fruit in color,
as against the  US which is only 8 times larger, on thinner stock, and with the
background in black  and white) is completely different from the album itself:
YtO, WSILY?, BSL, TotC,  TRS, and CotH (the Side A songs, once again, are in
correct order). I cannot imagine  defending this as a playing sequence,
lyrically or musically. Moreover, it is evident  that the order in which the
Side B lyrics have been placed is indeed chosen to  maximize the use of space,
with the longest (CotH) placed under the shortest for  Side A (&quot;Lily&quot;),
the shortest (BSL) under the longest (EtM), and so on. In addition,  the album
jacket itself prints the tracklist on the back in the same order as the disk. 
(And finally, if it is relevant, the lyrics for the US CD are in three rows of
four each,  in an order that has nothing whatever to do with the album order,
not even the  contents of each side--which both of the UK lyrics sheets
respect.) </P>
<P>Is my suggestion dead? Maybe not. Since the layout of the Side B tracks for
the  UK CD foldout does maximize the use of space, the layout used for the
lyrics on the  album slipcover does not, forcing the font to be ever so slightly
smaller than it needs  to be--but that is almost illegibly small. So there is
still a little room to argue that it  is intentional. </P>
<P>I willingly admit, however, that I lept from one piece of physical evidence
whose  ambiguity I did not fully assess to a suggestion about artistic intention
mainly  because the playing sequence I described seemed like a revelation to
me--certainly  lyrically, where Craig sees some plausibility himself--but also
musically. He writes: </P>
<P>&gt;The decider for me is &quot;You're the One&quot;, which absolutely has
to be last, because  of the &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; references (using
Gary Brooker, &quot;Doing cartwheels  'cross the floor&quot;, etc.) These are
70s references (I know WSoP was 1967, but it  didn't impinge on me until the
70s), and at any party I went to in the 70s, no one  would have even considered
playing WSoP anything other than last. </P>
<P>This is an excellent argument, very important for exploring this album,
which is  chock full of musical allusions of this kind. I agree completely that
at the end of  &quot;You're the One,&quot; some larger ending is marked, too,
with the WSoP tonality  working just as he describes. But that fits exactly into
the way I perceive &quot;Big  Stripey Lie,&quot; as marking a new beginning,
moving through grief and pain to dismisal,  and it amplifies the meaning of the
start of TotC, &quot;This chapter says, 'Put it out of  your mind'.&quot; And
CotH still sounds to me like a natural album-ender, its funky  upbeat made
ironic by the lyrics, and the little gizmo in the trail-off seeming like a  kb
'signature' (listen to the last time that the chorus can be heard singing the
line  that previously is &quot;it's gonna be paradise&quot; and see if you can
hear what they say  instead of &quot;paradise&quot;). </P>
<P>Bottom line: having thought this through once more, I think Craig's chances
of  being right are about 87%, mine about 13%. The wonderful thing is that of
course it is  a matter of simple fact what, if anything, the order of the lyrics
for Side B on the  record sleeve is meant to signify--we just don't happen to
know yet. I will therefore  cling for the time being to my tattered but still
pleasing hypothesis. </P>

the  UK addition?) The cover insert folds out to be about 1/3 larger then the US
insert  (you get a slightly bigger picture of Kate out of this) and the fruit

<P>In addition to generous and instructive things IED said about the
'tracklist'  thread, in Andy Marvick's post the other day, there was a classic
IED Mystic  Message woven into the paragraph in question. The 'code' was so far
from devious  that I take it to be a message meant to be posted (read the
letters in caps in the  paragraph, backwards): </P>
<P>I'M CLIMBING UP THE LADDER HILL BUILDING IT'S ALL THE SAME REALLY </P>
<P>This of course assimilates the ladder mentioned in &quot;Constellation of

<P> Oh and here comes the man with the stick<BR> He said he'd fish me out of

<P>It having been my great joy and privilege to have Andrew Marvick visit three
of  the past four weekends, and so to share first experiences of &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot; with  him, including the EtM and RBG videos that he otherwise would
have missed (he  has no TV in New York), I find the jumble of emotions he is
signalling here quite  moving. If it seems that IED has been
uncharacteristically scarce in recent weeks,  that is because Andy was back at
Columbia this semester completing his doctoral  disseration, and it now appears
(to his joy and terror) he has finally been invited to  prepare it for defense.
So, before turning to some last remarks on the tracklist  question, the
following message should go forth: Calling all angels! Calling all angels!  If
you're an angel, you know what to do. </P>

<P>&gt;And to those who are putting forth this ridiculous postulate that the
order of  songs on TRS is (gasp) adulterated...why not run along and invent some
more  conspiracy theories and let us do our thing? Has it not occurred to you
that perhaps  *KaTe* chose the final order of tracks, and that the &quot;original&quot;
was just a first idea?  Has it not occurred to you that she looked at the order
of the postulate and said &quot;my  God, that would sound like shit&quot;, as I
did? I mean, program your disc however you  please, but don't try and pass it
off as the &quot;real&quot; order, lyric sheet be damned. </P>
<P>Well, this is my fault; the spin I put on my initial report of the
possibility that an  alternative track order is suggested by the lyrics order on
the record sleeve, was a  bad move. Even if it is a trademark affectation of the
newsgroup, the  mock-authoritarian style is not redeemed by its irony and always
winds up  generating more heat than light. I apologize. </P>
<P>Moreover, I stipulate: the released album is authoritative and what Kate
intended  to release (it is not &quot;adulterated&quot;). No doubt there were
lots of ideas about the  playlist, and no doubt Kate discussed her ideas with
others whom she listened to  because she trusted their judgment (there was no &quot;conspiracy&quot;).
I was clearly wrong  in supposing that the playlist suggested on the record
sleeve represented an  &quot;original&quot; order intended for the album that
she was talked out of late in the  production process, since the record *jacket*
has the released order on the back, so  there is no need to suppose that
marketing considerations played any role. IED  makes the point well: </P>
<P>&gt;in ied's humbLe opinion the evidencE still weigHs in favor of peter's
original  interpretaTion. ied would demur on one minor Point, however: he sees
no reason to  assUme that the chanGe(s) to the track order must have been
prompted by  commercial concerns at aNy stage. it could well be that the track
order on sIde two  remained a matter of doubt for kate herself until shortly
Before the release date (or  even later). we siMply have no way of knowing. </P>
<P>Most true.  Still, we do have evidence that Kate can remain fond enough of
an  early (or at least alternative) version of her work to give *it* to us too:
&quot;Alternative  Hounds of Love&quot; (which still sounds to me like a way the
song wanted to go at an  early stage, that she just couldn't let go of). So the
correct form of the 'Experiment  V' hypothesis that Andy and I considered last
weekend is stated by IED: </P>
<P>&gt; or (and this is an explanation which ied fInds particularLy attractive,
though of  course it is unsupported by any faCt) the confusion Might well have
been created  deliberately, and the clues to the side's correct running order
placed on the lp's  sleeve for the dedikated to dIscover for themselves, thus to
be further delighted... </P>
<P>The inferences can be summarized: </P>
<P>The order of the lyrics on the record sleeve is NOT the maximally efficient 
nesting of the Side B songs beneath the Side A ones; the UK CD lyrics sheet is.
</P>
<P>The complete mess of an order in which the lyrics are listed on the US CD
lyrics  sheet might be a 'covering of one's tracks' (the pun here is
distracting), intended to  confuse the inattentive. </P>
<P>It is one thing to print the Side A lyrics in album sequence, the Side B
lyrics  almost entirely out of order, so that one is provoked to look for (and
promptly  discover) some other principle of arrangement (as on the UK CD). But
it is quite  another to arrange all of the lyrics for sides A and B, in discrete
groups of 6, in such  a way as entirely to match the album sequence except for a
single reversal of position  of two songs. Yes, CotH won't fit under EtM in the
format chosen, but if that's the  whole reason, that's teasing! </P>
<P>Finally, of course, there is the whole huge factor of the sheer musical and
lyrical  satisfactoriness of the suggested playlist. It's an *experience* to
hear and think of  the album that way, and it's nice to think there is a chance
it comes from Kate--an  esoteric version of the exoteric album. Craig Heath saw
some point to it lyrically  from the start, and has now made a capital
observation, picking up on my last post: </P>
<P>&gt; &lt;CH&gt; [I said YtO must be last because I interpret the WSoP
references as  indicating an ending] </P>
<P>&gt; &lt;PBM&gt; I agree completely that at the end of &quot;You're the One,&quot;
some larger  ending is marked, too, with the WSoP tonality working just as he
describes. But that  fits exactly into the way I perceive &quot;Big Stripey Lie,&quot;
as marking a new beginning,  moving through grief and pain to dismisal... </P>
<P>&gt; When I read this catalogue of emotions, it struck a chord, but my next
thought  was &quot;where is anger?&quot; Certainly my response to YtO involves
being on the cusp of  an emotional progression, and it's hard for me to
distinguish how much of that  progression is coming from clues in the lyrics and
music, and how much from my  personal psyche; however, the progression I feel
from YtO is: self-pity, then anger,  then acceptance. 
</P>
<P>YES! How blind could I be?! The last line of &quot;You're the One,&quot; &quot;just
forget it  alright&quot;, is spit out with more open rage than I can remember
ever hearing from  anyone, much less KB. There is a very natural sequence, not
just emotional but  spiritual, that anyone who's been through it will recognize:
after denial (often  enough self-pity as CH designates it), rage; then grief and
pain; then dismissal. If a  person can actually get through that (it is
precisely like going to hell), there may  come recovery (&quot;You're the One&quot;)
and the beginning of wisdom (&quot;Constellation of  the Heart&quot;). </P>
<P>Craig Heath notes: </P>
<P>&gt;Now, the difficulty I had in accepting BSL as a rejoinder to YtO is, I
must  confess, largely because I don't feel I understand what BSL is trying to
say. All I get  from it so far is anger, but that is enough for the triptych of
YtO, BSL and WSILY to  mirror that same progression of emotions (I think WSILY
is the weakest link of the  three in this theory, but it's close enough). </P>
<P>Agreed that BSL is angry; it does reach dismissal (&quot;hey all you little
waves run  away&quot;), with only the ache left (the violin line). For me, the
key to the song is &quot;Oh  my God it's a jungle in here, you've got wild
animals loose in here&quot;. &quot;In here&quot; is *in  that musical passage*,
sonically; Kate swamping the mixing desk with the almost  unbelievably
percussive walk-below-the-bottom bass line. &lt;This can *only* be heard  all
the way to the bottom on the EMI CD&gt; The credit for that performance should 
read &quot;LEAD Bass - Kate&quot;. People justly admire the guitar work, but she
doesn't play  a line on the guitar at all; it's all feedback and phasing--a
great ear, but no licks. But  that bass lead!!! You have to hear it in relation
to the sound of &quot;Ne T'Enfuis Pas&quot; in  its original mix, where Kate
herself was being a wild jungle animal, to sense the  deliverance this song and
her performance on it must have been for her. </P>
<P>It's the strength of the collaboration on &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;
that makes  that track work for me on this theory. I find Prince's work on this
cut to be  supremely tasty, even elegant--especially given the technical
situation. It sets up  Lenny Henry's verse to be as beautiful as the Trio sets
up Kate's to be at the  beginning. </P>
<P>Craig Heath to me again: </P>
<P>&gt;PBM also said: </P>
<P>&gt; [The WSoP references are] an excellent argument, very important for
exploring  this album, which is chock full of musical allusions of this kind.
</P>
<P>&gt;Would you care to be more specific? ... </P>
<P>I wish I could be. It was Andy who was boiling over with observations, and I
 should have been taking notes. He caught a lot of Captain Beefheart and
Incredible  String Band things. He picked up a theme in backing vocals on a song
here that was  an instrumental line somewhere in &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; and
was in turn some kind of  Beatles quote. I'm not musicologist enough to catch
this stuff on the fly. </P>
<P>I will share one last thing and then quit. My kately friend Margaret (whom
Andy  met) points out that the theme of RBG is among the oldest of all for Kate
Bush. In  &quot;Room for the Life,&quot; the last lines of the second verse,
</P>
<P> How long do you think, before she'll go out, woman <BR> Hey get up on your
feet and go get it now <BR> Like it or not we keep bouncing back <BR> Because
we're woman </P>
<P>Enough. I've got to go grade 17 graduate exams on Aristotle's Metaphysics. 
Interest should shift to &quot;The Line, the Cross, the Curve&quot; that
premiered yesterday. </P>

Subject: Steely Dan conneKTion </P>
<P>IED is happy to endorse Chris's comparison.  </P>
<P>In fact, he thought the musical reference Kate was making to Steely Dan in  &quot;Why
Should I Love You&quot; was extremely clear, as are several other deliberate 
references she makes to pop music past on side two of The Red Shoes (&quot;A
Whiter  Shade of Pale&quot; in &quot;You're the Only One&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow
Never Knows&quot; --particularly  the rhythm pattern and the McCartneyesque
bass-playing by John Giblin -- in parts  of &quot;Top of the City&quot;, and
Captain Beefheart in &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot;). He hadn't thought  to mention
these links until now, because it had not occurred to him that  Love-Hounds were
not already aware of them. Since Chris's suggestion has now  been unwisely
challenged, however, IED must join the discussion.   </P>
<P>Anyone doubting the Steely Dan connection should listen in rapid succession
to  the male chorus section of &quot;WSILY&quot; and to the first couple of
tracks on Steely Dan's  post-&quot;Aja&quot; album &quot;Gaucho&quot;.  The
likeness between the rhythmic sounds and chord  progressions is unmistakable --
and makes very clear, incidentally, just how silly are  some tin-eared critics'
assertions that this track is largely the work of Prince. (Kate  has already
explained the limited extent of Prince's presence on the final track,  anyway;
his primary surviving contribution is the characteristic guitar solo.) </P>
<P>Also, Kate has herself at least twice named &quot;Gaucho&quot; among her
favorite albums  -- she even played one of the most relevant tracks from that
album during her stint  as a guest dj on a 1980 radio program. The link is
therefore as well confirmed as any  reasonable student of Kate Bushology could
hope. </P>
