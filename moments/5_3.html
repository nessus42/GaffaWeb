-0400 <BR> Subject: A Bush-el of Fruitopia (SHOOT, July 1994) 
</P>
<P>Hello RMG! 
</P>
<P>This isn't my usual territory, but I do lurk in now and then. I'm usually
over on  Ecto. However, the following article caught my eye and I thought it
would be nice to  share it with you. I'm in the television postproduction
business, and one of our trade  papers, SHOOT, deals with all aspects of
commercial-making. In their current issue,  dated July 29, the following article
appears: 
</P>
<P> A Bush-el of Fruitopia 
</P>
<P>by Michael Clark 
</P>
<P>When Kate Bush took the assignment to do the music for Coca-Cola's new 
Fruitopia spots, it was indeed free rein for the British singer/songwriter
People  magazine once dubbed &quot;The Queen of Ethereal Pop&quot;. Chiat/Day,
New York, creative  director Marty Cooke and executive producer Andrew Chinich
were overjoyed when  Bush agreed to do not only one, but all nine of the spots
in the Fruitopia campaign.  Perhaps the fact that they told her she could do
anything she wanted with the scores  had something to do with it. In any case,
Cooke and Chinich were just glad to get  Bush on the job, which she did from
London with a bunch of hand-picked musicians. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In early tests, we played different music against the visuals, and
Kate Bush music  felt intuitive and right,&quot; Cooke says. &quot;It gave the
campaign a lot more consistency  than it would have otherwise.&quot; Bush, with
15 years of producing her own eclectic  albums (and video clips) in the music
business, was told only to provide a &quot;variety&quot; of  styles and moods
for the Fruiopia spots directed by Greg Ramsey out of bicoastal  Farenheit
Films. 
</P>
<P>The spots, which broke in early July in a variety of 0:30s and a 0:60 cinema
 version called &quot;What If,&quot; features intense kaleidescope-style
manipulations of  brightly colored fruit. Serendipitous text appears in the
center of the psychedelic  frame, with the soundtracks by Bush giving the spot
an almost dizzying pace. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We're very pleased...all the indications are that the music is one of
the strongest  parts of the campaign,&quot; says Chiat/Day's Cooke. Bush
supplied a variety of  soundtracks, from a version that is heavy on percussion,
to a poppy &quot;lounge&quot;  guitar/keyboard combination, to one Cooke
describes as sounding &quot;like a bunch of  Japanese schoolchildren.&quot; 
</P>
<P>For the cinema 0:60 &quot;What If,&quot; which is number one on the most
recent SHOOT  Top 10 Spot Tracks chart, Bush put down a track of very tribal
percussion with  layers of rhythmic chants that blend with the changing fields
of rotating fruit. 
</P>
<P>&quot;She said she was interested in providing a lot of variety, from
Japanese  drummers to Moroccan music...and she came through in spades,&quot;
Cooke says. 
</P>
<P>----------
</P>
<P>I for one was unaware that Kate had done this music. My son and I were 
watching teevee together recently and were both pleasantly impressed by one of
the  spots described. 
</P>
<P>Best wishes to everyone, 
</P>

<P>Thanks to Bob Lovejoy, too, for his hugely appreciated news report about the
 Fruitopia campaign! IED was unfortunately too late reading Bob's posting to do 
anything about getting a tape of the spots from Chiat/Day in time for Karen's 
fiercely anticipated postKatemas party tomorrow, but perhaps we will be
successful  later on. Meanwhile, IED (and he hopes many others in this group)
will be trying to  capture Fruitopia ads on TV in the coming days. Did Peter
FitzGerald-Morris and  the Homeground crew know of this unexpeKTed turn in
Kate's career? Btw, if  Kate has been wise enough to negotiate for residuals on
this account, she stands to  make more from the Fruitopia ads than she's ever
made from all her album and  single sales combined.

<P>I'm still in shock. I've been seeing (and hearing) these commercials for
weeks  and thinking, &quot;My god ... someone's doing a good Kate imitation.&quot;
Well, just knock  me over with a feather! By the way, I keep encountering the
commercials on  Comedy Central if you're really looking to tape them.

<BR> Subject: Fruitopia 
</P>
<P>This past Saturday I set my VCR on EP and recorded six hours of Empty-V in 
the hopes of catching some of those Furitopia commercials. Within the first hour
I  got three of the the nine ads! Unfortunately, in the remaining five hours,
though, I  got not one. So three will have to tide me over. As an extra added
bonus, I got every  episode of the second season of *Eon Flux*. What more could
a guy ask for? I am  very happy. (I'm still dizzy though from watching six hours
of Emtpy-V on fast  forward.) 
</P>
<P>The music from all three of the ads that I caught were rather new-agey. They
 were definitely Kate though! Especially number 2. I think one of the ads I saw
a  couple weeks ago was a bit more techno, but my memory is vague.
</P>
<P>Here's a brief description of the music from the ads I caught: 
</P>
<P>(1) Mellow echoey piano with a heart-beat drum pattern. 
</P>
<P>(2) Kate does drum-talk on national TV! This one was described in the
published  article posted here a few days ago as sounding like a bunch of
Japanese school  kids. I guess the author has never heard drum talk, but this is
a dead give-away  that these commercials were done by Kate (or Sheila Chandra,
but they don't  sound like Sheila). 
</P>
<P>(3) Mellow band and piano sound with bongos instead of a drum-kit. Kate
sings &quot;la  la la&quot; in the background. 
</P>
<P>Of course, the music for all three is complete genius (for music that sounds
like it  was thrown together in a couple of days for a TV commercial, that is).

</P>
<P>A couple of things: I was putting on a t-shirt this morning. The Eat The
Music  &quot;field'o'fruit&quot; shirt from the convention, with only the fruit
and not a single word  about Kate. Pretty subliminal. As soon as I had pulled it
over my head and saw the  image in the mirror (the first time I had done so
since learning about the Fruitopia  music) I flashed on the resemblance between
this shirt and those commercials. Am I  actually wearing a Frutopia advert,
rather than the Kate Bush t-shirt that I thought I  bought? I mean, I bought it
at a Kate Bush fan convention, along with hundreds of  other Kate Bush fans, so
I kind of assumed that it was a Kate shirt. So the obvious  question... was Kate
having one of her mind-bogglingly obscure joking hidden  references? &quot;I've
got a secret. See if you can find it...&quot; 
</P>
<P>(As soon as I finished typing that last sentence, the &quot;Japanese
Childern Singing&quot;  30 second spot played during the second break of the
Tonight Show. It sounds like  Japanese Childern Singing, *not* drum talk, so
this must be one of the other ones.  Actually it strikes me as kind of Steve
Reich-like, if he had more of a sense of fun.)

First Year 
</P>
<P>IED is possibly correct in thinking that Kate will make more money from the 
small pieces of music she's composed for Frutopia than from all her albums 
combined. 
</P>
<P>John Naisbitt's Trend Letter reports that the first-year marketing budget
for  Frutopia is $ 30 million (U.S.) 
</P>
<P>I hope Kate got a good sizable chunk of that!

Subject: Tree of Fruitopia? 
</P>
<P>Marcel Rijs asks whether anyone would like to send him a PAL copy of all the
 Fruitopia ads. As IED has now had several other requests for same (from 
Europe-based Love-Hounds), and is sure there are many U.S. fans who would be 
interested, he suggests that a Love-Hounds Collection Volume 2 might well be in 
order sooner rather than later (?). Thoughts on the subject, anyone? 
</P>
<P>The video for &quot;The Man I Love&quot; would be a welcome addition (does
anyone have  it?), as well as Kate's recent appearance on the UK children's
programme, &quot;Record  Breakers&quot;, which was supposed to have aired on
October 7th (did no one see it? Will  anyone report on it?) That said, let us
move on to the issue at hand: 
</P>
<P>[A more complete list can be found <A HREF="#adlist">here</A>]</P>
<P>FRUITOPIA: A LIST OF KATE BUSH-SCORED COMMERCIAL FILMS 
</P>
<P>General note: These are the TV ads (and one theatre ad). They may or may not
 correspond in some way to the radio ads, which IED has never heard. In one
respect,  however, they are different from any radio ad (and this is why they
are so  wonderful): the TV ads have no spoken-word vocal pitch to obscure Kate
Bush's  music. All the text in the ads is read-only. 
</P>
<P>Please forgive any awkwardness in IED's description of the visuals and 
(particularly) the music. It's the best he could do. Finally, IED takes no 
responsibility for the slightly nauseating tone of the texts and the names of 
individual flavors of Fruitopia. 
</P>
<P>N.B.: All the ads end with the tag line, &quot;For the mind [represented by
a simple  drawing of a head], body [stick figure], planet [sketch of Earth].&quot;

</P>
<P>01. &quot;Fighting Fruit&quot; (official Coca-Cola title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>Specific flavor touted: Fruit Integration. 
</P>
<P>The ad's text reads: &quot;The apples don't fight the pineapples in Fruit
Integration.  People could learn a lot from fruit.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions of this ad: Unique in that it shows recognizable shots
of  pineapple. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4, mid-tempo. A pretty melody by high synth, with heavy synthetic 
drum-kit rhythm (snares on second and third downbeat of each measure); halfway 
through, Kate (her voice recognizable), chants gleefully, &quot;Hey! Hey! Juice!&quot;

</P>
<P>02. &quot;Nice&quot; (official title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Specific flavor: Pink Lemonade Euphoria. 
</P>
<P>The text reads: &quot;If your mouth can't say something nice, put something
nice in it.  Please try Pink Lemonade Euphoria.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: Very yellow, with some pink -- lots of lemons, starting
out  against a black background. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4, mid-tempo. A synthetic tribal bass-drum sound on the first
downbeat  of each measure is the only percussion, and the main instrumental
music, carried by  synthetic flutes (in simple two-note chords), is a cadence of
syncopated  sixteenth-notes. Over this Kate (barely recognizable -- some
listeners originally  described this as sounding like Japanese schoolgirls)
chants what sound like (but  may not be) English words including the phrase &quot;something's
coming&quot;. 
</P>
<P>03. &quot;Passion&quot; (IED's title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Specific flavor: Strawberry Passion Awareness. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;The ancient Maori believed passion fruit was a powerful
aphrodisiac. Hey,  it couldn't hurt. Try Strawberry Passion Awareness.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: Lots of strawberries and halved apples. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4. a chorus of tribal drums, with two harmonically unrelated
descending  minor thirds (the first in staccato triplets, the second in legato
dotted quarter-notes)  the only other music. 
</P>
<P>04. &quot;Raspberry&quot; (IED's title): 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Flavor: Raspberry Psychic Lemonade. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;There is a wonderful person inside you who is dying to get out.
Please  drink a Raspberry Psychic Lemonade for him/her.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: Starts with raspberries against a black background,
also lots of  lemons. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/8. Slow bongo rhythm, with a pretty little melody by electric
piano, and a  soft synthetic bass. 
</P>
<P>05. &quot;Message of Love&quot; (IED's rather yucky title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Flavor: Lemonade Love and Hope. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;If you can't judge a fruit by the color of its skin, how can you
judge a  person that way? A message of Lemonade, Love and Hope.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: Completely yellow, nothing but lemons. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4, medium-fast tempo. Tabla drum pattern with mandolins (?) 
supporting Kate's (recognizable) &quot;drum-talk&quot; (?) -- the &quot;diggety-dah,
diggy-dah&quot;  stuff (Indian) that Sheila Chandra has made popular (though it
can be heard at the  end of Kate's1982 track, &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;,
too). 
</P>
<P>06. &quot;Soul&quot; (official title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Flavor: Citrus Consciousness. Text: &quot;This is what Citrus Consciousness
can do to  your tongue. Imagine what it can do for your soul.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: Lemons, limes and oranges. The text is revealed on the
screen  one word at a time, each word appearing simultaneously in different
parts of the  screen. 
</P>
<P>Music: 3/4, medium-slow. This is a wistful little waltz, with synthetic
pizzicato  strings setting the beat, and synthetic oboes (?) playing an odd,
childlike melody that  begins in a single voice, ends with harmony a third
below. 
</P>
<P>07. &quot;Where Were You?&quot; (IED's title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Flavor: Cranberry Lemonade Vision. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;Where were you when: the second man walked on the moon? the
Berlin  Wall went up? This commercial started? You had your first Cranberry
Vision?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: Begins with a shot of lemons that look a little like
Pacmen  against a black background. Most of the ad shows deep red cranberries
and bright  yellow lemons against a deep greenish-gold background. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4, mid-tempo. Begins and ends just with sampled (?) hand-claps; 
features a simple synth keyboard melody in block chords set against a basic
drum-kit  beat. 
</P>
<P>08. &quot;Teaser&quot; (IED's title). 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P> Flavor: no specific flavor is mentioned. This ad appeared very early in the
 campaign. Not to be confused with ad no. 9, also for no specific flavor. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;The following 30 seconds will not inspire: violent crime, a
religious  experience, conscpicuous consumption. It may, however, make you
thirsty.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: great variety of colors, none dominant. Ends with some
pale  purplish colors, turning to red (cranberries or cherries) against a
near-black  background. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4. Slow. A quiet heartbeat drum-pattern is the only percussion. A
lazy  melody by an electric piano sounds quasi-improvised. 
</P>
<P>09. &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; (official title). 30 seconds (see No. 10). 
</P>
<P> Flavor: No specific flavor is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;The summer solstice is: a pagan ritual. The summer solstice is:
the first day  of summer. The summer solstice is: a happy day for people who
practice voodoo. The  summer solstice is: the first day of Fruitopia.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: the most varied use of color, showing all kinds of
fruit in  quick succession, starting with a lot of red grapes (looking dark
gray) against a black  and red background. 
</P>
<P>Music: 4/4. Medium-slow. Cymbal-free drum-kit percussion; a heavy,
repetitive  bassline on a single minor third; weird, high melody-line by
unidentifiable synth  voice; and Kate's voice (recognizable) half-muttering
half-words, and (sampled)  again, singing what sounds like a loop of &quot;boy-boy-boy,
boy, boy-OY, boy, boy!&quot; 
</P>
<P>10. &quot;What If?&quot; (official title). 60 seconds. Wide-screen. 
</P>
<P> N.B.: This ad, twice the length of all the others, was made for screening
in movie  theatres. The ad includes the footage from No. 09 (&quot;Summer
Solstice&quot;) above, and  reveals that the shorter version was a pan-and-scan
of the wide-screen original. 
</P>
<P>Flavor: No specific flavor is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>Text: &quot;What if.. . nobody voted? you die not knowing? you never fall in
love?  extraterrestrials are us, not them? the experts are wrong? fashion does
matter?  everybody was the same color? virtual reality is reality? you hugged
the person next  to you? you are alone? there were no last names? there really
is someone out there?  you never read 'Madame Bovary'? the cynics are right? you
spill your popcorn?  everybody could draw? everybody could sing? you never
needed a passport? nobody  was hungry? tribes didn't exist? you didn't attend
Woodstock? you're thirsty? the  end is near? people stop reading? nobody had to
sleep alone? this movie changes  your life? your pet is your best friend? nobody
cried? this is all there is? Fruitopian  queries have no answers?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Visual distinctions: same as No. 09 above, but longer, and wide-screen. 
</P>
<P>Music: same as 09, only a longer re-mix. 
</P>
<P>11. Unidentified ad for a lime-flavored drink. (IED has not seen or heard
this  one.) 
</P>
<P>So here is the state of affairs in Fruitopia: IED has now collected (thanks 
enormously to Brian Leake and Karen Newcombe!) good copies of Fruitopia Nos. 01,
 02, 06, and 09 (30 seconds each) plus No. 10 (the &quot;wide-screen&quot;
theatre ad, 60  seconds long, uses a longer mix of No. 09). 
</P>
<P>In addition, he has now amassed some pretty awful copies of Nos. 03, 04, 05,
07  and 08 (30 seconds each; see above). Anyone who has any or all of these five
in  reasonably good stereo form will be sincerely thanked for making them
available for  a Love-Hounds tape. 
</P>
<P>The article in &quot;Shoot!&quot; magazine, which alerted us all to Kate's
connection with  Fruitopia, mentioned a total of nine ads, and this was
confirmed in telephone  conversations with two people connected with Coca-Cola.
It was never made clear  whether the long ad (No. 10) was not counted among
those nine because it was  really just a version of No. 09), but it appears that
this is the case. 
</P>
<P>The problem is, Karen Newcombe has assured IED that, while in Chicago a 
couple of weeks ago, she saw still another ad (no. 11), &quot;all green&quot;,
which plugged a  &quot;lime&quot; flavor of the produKT. 
</P>
<P>This news throws everything into doubt again, and leads to the question,
Could  Kate have made more than the original batch of nine tracks of music (plus
the long  version of one of them), and could another collection simply be
waiting in the wings,  or getting gradual exposure as older ads are withdrawn?
IED has tried to get a clear  answer from various ad agencies and divisions of
Coke, Fruitopia and MinuteMaid, all  to no avail thus far. But he noticed a
grape-flavored Fruitopia drink in a store the  other day, for which he has not
yet seen an ad.. .. 
</P>
<P>So he asks the Love-Hounds, has anyone captured on video this elusive &quot;lime&quot;
ad,  or any other Fruitopia ads that do not conform to the descriptions of the
ten others  posted above? If so, would he or she please contact IED via e-mail?
Wouldn't it be  nice if we could get a definitive homemade compilation of the
ads ready for inclusion  on a Love-Hounds Collection Volume 2?

<P>IED was recently told by someone at the company that actually shot the spots
 (Fahrenheit Films, in NYC) that Kate was their choice right from the beginning 
(before the ads were even shot), and that they never considered asking anyone
else.  (Of course, this would be the standard ad-agency answer anyway, probably:
you  don't want to admit you settled for your second choice.) 
</P>
<P>IED was told that she was involved with the spots from very early on. The
only  request they made was that there be a broad range of musical styles, that
no two  should sound alike.

<P>[conc. production of frutopia]
</P>
<P>My information was from Post , a magazine for the post-production business 
(editing, graphics and animation.) They had a image from the theatrical spot and
a  couple of paragraphs about the making of the spots. I can't find it at the
moment, so  this is from memory. The two designers from McKane-Ericson (sp?)
decided to use  Kate after storyboards and rough animatics (moving camera shots
of the storyboard  stills) but well before the actual production. So, we are
both right. It just depends of  the definition of the term &quot;begining.&quot;

</P>
<P>Fahrenheit was the coordinating producer on the spots. The actual production
was  done at Click 3X, a state-of-the-art New York editing and animation
facility. They  did the tabletop shots of fruit. These were used as texture maps
in a Softimage 3D  animation and the final images were smoothed and blended in a
Flame system. The  entire edit was done in D-1 component digital. 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;The agency paid for the production and Kate gets a royalty for the
music. 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED has had no confirmation of this. In fact, it was this question
which  effectively ended IED's interview with one Coke spokesperson. Does Chris
know  for a fact that Kate's contract entitles her to residuals, or whether she
may have  settled for a flat fee? 
</P>
<P>This was an assumption. Kate is the composer, musician and singer. The
latter  two might receive a lump payment, but a composer always gets royalties.
The story  went on to mention that the agency paid for studio time, but it
seemed to imply that  the spots were not done at Kate's home studio, but at a &quot;London
studio.&quot;

<P>I have to agree with Scott Telford of Univ of Edindurgh that one of the
Fruitopia  adverts doesn't sound like KaTe. So far I've seen two (I think)
adverts and one was  definitely KaTe. The second one sounded a lot like the
Cocteau Twins (and no I  can't remember the name of the lead singer.) As an
aside I actually bought a bottle  of Fruitopia, very nice, a bit pricey though.

<P>I've just been reading the latest issue of Homeground and it states that all
the  UK Fruitopia adverts are definitely Liz Fraser from the Cocteau Twins and
the  adverts with Kate's voice are not going to be shown in the UK. So, if
anyone in the  UK thinks that they heard Kate's voice on any of the adverts,

21:48:46 -0400 <BR> Subject: The State of Fruitopia 
</P>
<P>In response to Karen's suggestion, here is an updated description of all
eleven  Kate Bush-scored Fruitopia commercials seen in the U.S. to date. N.B.:
These were  NOT scored by Cocteau Twins or Liz Fraser, though IED greatly
appreciates Steve  ZPJ's report explaining that UK audiences are hearing Liz
Fraser and not Kate. IED  therefore produces the information below even though
European fans' interest in  the following may perforce remain only academic. 
</P>
<P>FRUITOPIA: 
</P>
<P>A LIST OF KATE BUSH-SCORED COMMERCIAL FILMS 
</P>
<P>General note: These are the TV ads (and one theatre ad). They reportedly do
not  correspond to the radio ads, though IED has never heard those. In one
respect,  however, they are different from any radio ad (and this is why they
are so  wonderful): the TV ads have no spoken-word vocal pitch to obscure Kate
Bush's  music. All the text in the ads is read-only. 
</P>
<P>Note that although several new (1995) Fruitopia commercials have been aired
in  the United States, only one of these actually contains new Kate Bush music
not heard  in any of the first (1994) collection. IED mentions this because
several people have  reported seeing additional 1995 spots; unfortunately, these
are simply new visuals  attached to Kate's earlier (1994) musics. 
</P>
<P>Please forgive any awkwardness in IED's description of the visuals and 
(particularly) the music. It's the best he could do. Finally, IED takes no 
responsibility for the slightly nauseating tone of the texts and the names of 
individual flavors of Fruitopia. 
</P>
<P> I.  1994 commercials: 
</P>
<H3>01.  TITLE:  &quot;Fighting Fruit&quot; (official Coca-Cola title). 30
seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>        SPECIFIC FLAVOR TOUTED: Fruit Integration. 
</P>
<P>   TEXT:  &quot;The apples don't fight the pineapples in Fruit         
Integration. People could learn a lot from fruit.&quot; 
</P>
<P>   VISUALS: This ad, like all of them, end with the tag line,          &quot;For
the mind [represented by a simple drawing of a          head], body [stick
figure], planet [sketch of Earth].&quot;          Visuals include recognizable
shots of pineapple. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/4, mid-tempo. A pretty melody by high synth,          with
heavy synthetic drum-kit rhythm (snares on second          and third downbeat of
each measure); halfway through,          Kate (her voice recognizable), chants
gleefully, &quot;Hey!          Hey! Juice!&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>02.  TITLE:  &quot;Nice&quot; (official title). 30 seconds.

<P>    FLAVOR: Pink Lemonade Euphoria. 
</P>
<P>    TEXT:  &quot;If your mouth can't say something nice, put something      
   nice in it. Please try Pink Lemonade Euphoria.&quot; 
</P>
<P>    VISUALS: Very yellow, with some pink -- lots of lemons, starting        
 out against a black background. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/4, mid-tempo. A synthetic tribal bass-drum          sound on
the first downbeat of each measure is the only          percussion, and the main
instrumental music, carried by          synthetic flutes (in simple two-note
chords), is a cadence          of syncopated sixteenth-notes. Over this Kate
(barely          recognizable -- some listeners originally described this       
  as sounding like Japanese schoolgirls) chants what sound          like (but
may not be) English words including the phrase          &quot;something's coming&quot;.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>03.  TITLE:  &quot;Passion&quot; (IED's title). 30 seconds.

powerful aphrodisiac. Hey, it couldn't hurt. Try          Strawberry Passion
Awareness.&quot; 
</P>
<P>   VISUALS: Lots of strawberries and halved apples. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/4. A chorus of tribal drums, with two harmonically         
unrelated descending minor thirds (the first in staccato          triplets, the
second in legato dotted quarter-notes) the          only other music. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>04.  TITLE:  &quot;Raspberry&quot; (IED's title): 30 seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>    FLAVOR: Raspberry Psychic Lemonade. 
</P>
<P>   TEXT:  &quot;There is a wonderful person inside you who is dying         
to get out. Please drink a Raspberry Psychic Lemonade          for him/her.&quot;

</P>
<P>    VISUALS: Starts with raspberries against a black background,         
also lots of lemons. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/8. Slow bongo rhythm, with a pretty little melody          by
electric piano, and a soft synthetic bass. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>05.  TITLE:  &quot;Message of Love&quot; (IED's rather yucky title). 30
seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   FLAVOR: Lemonade Love and Hope. 
</P>
<P>   TEXT:  &quot;If you can't judge a fruit by the color of its skin,        
how can you judge a person that way? A message of         Lemonade, Love and
Hope.&quot; 
</P>
<P>   VISUALS: Completely yellow, nothing but lemons. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/4, medium-fast tempo. Tabla drum pattern with mandolins        
(?) supporting Kate's (recognizable) &quot;drum-talk&quot; (?) --         the &quot;digguh-dah,
digguh-dah&quot; stuff (Indian) that Sheila         Chandra has made popular
(though it can be heard at the         end of Kate's1982 track, &quot;Get Out of
My House&quot;, too). 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>06.  TITLE:  &quot;Soul&quot; (official title). 30 seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   FLAVOR: Citrus Consciousness. 
</P>
<P>   TEXT:  &quot;This is what Citrus Consciousness can do to your        
tongue. Imagine what it can do for your soul.&quot; 
</P>
<P>   VISUALS: Lemons, limes and oranges. The text is revealed on the        
screen one word at a time, each word appearing         simultaneously in
different parts of the screen. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  3/4, medium-slow. This is a wistful little waltz,         with
synthetic pizzicato strings setting the beat,         and synthetic oboes (?)
playing an odd, childlike         melody that begins in a single voice, ends
with harmony         a third below.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>07.  TITLE:  &quot;Where Were You?&quot; (IED's title). 30 seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   FLAVOR: Cranberry Lemonade Vision. 
</P>
<P>   TEXT:  &quot;Where were you when: the second man walked on         the
moon? the Berlin Wall went up? This commercial         started? You had your
first Cranberry Vision?&quot; 
</P>
<P>   VISUALS: Begins with a shot of lemons that look a little like        
Pacmen against a black background. Most of the ad shows         deep red
cranberries and bright yellow lemons against a         deep greenish-gold
background. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/4, mid-tempo. Begins and ends just with sampled (?)        
hand-claps; features a simple synth keyboard melody in         block chords set
against a basic drum-kit beat. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>08.  TITLE:  &quot;Teaser&quot; (IED's title). 30 seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   FLAVOR: No specific flavor is mentioned. This ad appeared         very
early in the campaign. Not to be confused with         ad no. 9, also for no
specific flavor. 
</P>
<P>   TEXT:  &quot;The following 30 seconds will not inspire: violent        
crime, a religious experience, conscpicuous consumption.         It may,
however, make you thirsty.&quot; 
</P>
<P>   VISUALS: Great variety of colors, none dominant. Ends         with some
pale purplish colors, turning to red         (cranberries or cherries) against a
near-black background. 
</P>
<P>   MUSIC:  4/4. Slow. A quiet heartbeat drum-pattern is the only        
percussion. A lazy melody by an electric piano sounds         quasi-improvised.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>09.  TITLE:  &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; (official title). 30 seconds 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>        (see No. 10).     FLAVOR: No specific flavor is mentioned.

<P>     TEXT:  &quot;The summer solstice is: a pagan ritual. The         summer
solstice is: the first day of summer. The         summer solstice is: a happy
day for people who practice         voodoo. The summer solstice is: the first
day of         Fruitopia.&quot; 
</P>
<P>     VISUALS: The most varied use of color, showing         all kinds of
fruit in quick succession, starting with         a lot of red grapes (looking
dark gray) against a         black and red background. 
</P>
<P>     MUSIC:  4/4. Medium-slow. Cymbal-free drum-kit         percussion; a
heavy, repetitive bassline on a single         minor third; weird, high
melody-line by unidentifiable         synth voice; and Kate's voice
(recognizable) half-         muttering half-words, and (sampled) again, singing
what         sounds like a loop of &quot;boy-boy-boy, boy, boy-OY,         boy,
boy!&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>10.  TITLE:  &quot;What If?&quot; (official title). 60 seconds. 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>        WIDE-SCREEN. N.B.: This ad, twice the length of         all the
others, was made for screening in movie theatres.         The ad includes the
footage from No. 09 (&quot;Summer Solstice&quot;)         above, and reveals
that the shorter version was a         pan-and-scan of the wide-screen original.

second-generation spots, non-fruit items, among         them an acoustic guitar
and a marble head of a Greek         goddess, are thrown into the kaleidoscopic
mix.

<P>    MUSIC: 4/4. Major key. Bass tabla cadence. Kate's backing         vocals
sing &quot;Ah-wee-ay, ah-wee-oh, ah-wee-ay...&quot; and         are answered by
Kate's main vocal (very clearly         identifiable as Kate) singing some

decipher.

<P>The article in &quot;Shoot!&quot; magazine, which alerted us all to Kate's

(The music in No. 10  [&quot;What If?&quot;] is the same as in No. 9 [&quot;Summer

<P>Yes the Fruitopia adverts in the uk are most definiately the Cocteau Twins 
(Elizabeth Frazer being the lead singer). Why the Cocteau Twins ? They are one
of  the most successfull independant bands in the UK apart from of course the
Smiths  and are a favorite among students even today. Their music is unique and
has be  called among other things &quot;etheral&quot;. No lyrics are printed and
very few words can be  made out, even so it can invoke many emotions. Even John
Peel of Radio 1 fame, has  admitted to being moved to tears on hearing &quot;pearly
dew drops drop&quot;, which made  the top 40. Elizabeth Frazer who is a very
private and shy was horrified of the  thought that if the record had got any
higher they would have been asked to appear!  I have heard their music as
background in many TV programs including the South  Bank Show (I always find
this strangely distrubing). Their music is very suited to the  fruitopia image.

<P>Not that it's any great reflection on Kate's scoring, but...the most recent
edition  of Entertainment Weekly (with singer Selena on the cover) lists a few
commercials  that they like...and then a couple that they really dislike.
Fruitopia fell into the latter  category, mostly due, they said, to the irony of
a mega-corp like Coca-cola  positioning repackaged fruit juice in such a retro,
'love the planet' kind of way. 
</P>
<P>Of Kate's music, there was only a passing reference, and it was not 
flattering...but it wasn't incendiary either. They called the scoring 'quasi-new
age.' 
</P>
<P>I kinda liked the kaleidoscope effect myself, though a picture of Kate
swimming  through the stuff would've been preferred. Actually, was any image or
mention of  Fruitopia actually necessary? Couldn't they've just launched a
massive campaign to  promote Kate to the Americas? :-)

<P>What's with Fruitopia??? Those ads get in your brain and won't let go.

<P>TUESDAY, AUGUST 29</P>
<P>TRAVELLING FRUITOPIA </P>
<P>Until recently, I thought that Fruitopia simply had scary flashback
commercials  and cool vending machines that provided glass bottles of annoyingly
titled juice.  However, I clearly underestimated them. They ALSO have a
multicolored bus that's  touring the nation this summer; a bus that houses the
travelling Fruitopia Show. I  was lucky enough to catch it here in New York.</P>
<P>Play it Fruitopia man!</P>
<P>After the end of this promotional show, I spoke with Jim Hinde, singer for
the  Fruitopia tour (after he handed out complimentary bottles of &quot;Fruit
Generation&quot;). I  wanted to know if he sang original lyrics or if his songs
had a special Fruitopia angle  to them. </P>
<P>&quot;This show is basically run concurrent, but by itself in relation to
the drink.&quot; said  Jim. &quot;I haven't changed any lyrics to my songs, and
none of it is based on Fruitopia,  does that make sense?&quot; </P>

<P>THE BEST PRODUCTS OF 1994 </P>
<P>Fruitopia </P>
<P>&quot;Citrus Consciousness&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Passion Awareness&quot;
hardly sound like  Coca-Cola products. But when the Atlanta soft-drink maker
introduced these and  other flavors in its new line of Minute Maid Fruitopia
drinks last summer, thirsty  consumers could not get enough of the
noncarbonated, fruit-based beverages. With  catchy advertising and Coke's
distribution muscle behind it, Fruitopia has wasted no  time grabbing a sizable
share of the Snapple-led fruit-drink market, like a parched  softball player
after a hot game. </P>

<P>Fruitopia officially symbolizes everything in the universe that makes loyal

it.  However, in doing so, we are being bombarded with the most unpleasant 
anti-hideous violence propaganda imaginable.</P>
<P>You know how the commercials go. Psychedelic fruit, throbbing and pulsing 
rhythmically across the screen. Peaceful, lulling, psyche-penetrating music.
Then  messages flash on the screen, like: </P>

will be... <BR> Because you are so enlightened... <BR> Because you drink...

Competition? </P>
<P>Hello friends, </P>
<P>Hey, hey - juice! </P>
<P>Some days ago I received the lovehounds tape from Lightning, John and it was
a  revelation! The Fruitopia adds are so cool. I haven't seen them before. The
music is  fantastic! It fits so perfectly to the colourful pictures. It's great!
We have new KaTe  here! I made a 30 min audio tape from it, repeating all the
adds 5 times. I love it! It's  like a drug. I can listen to it for hours at
work. - I'm so mad. Maybe they are simple  in the making, but they sound so
beautiful! Smash 'em Mr. Drukman!</P>
<P>Hey, hey - juice!</P>
<P>I'm pretty sure, these will never be officially released, so you have
ultrarare  KaTe here! The best music IMHO is in &quot;Summer solstice&quot;, &quot;Fighting
Fruit&quot; (the best!  &quot;hey, hey - juice&quot;, her voice, oh god!) and &quot;Skin&quot;.</P>
<P>Hey, hey - juice! </P>
<P>Total fruit integration! I go for it! </P>
<P>Now: </P>
<P>1. what are the complete words from &quot;what if?&quot;</P>
<P>2. what do the spoken words in the japanese &quot;summer solstice&quot;
mean?</P>
<P>And, a new KBC competition (maybe): </P>
<P>3. What is Kate singing in the Ice tea spot?</P>
<P> I think it's not &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;?</P>
<P>To me it sounds like &quot;A honey on a saturday&quot; :-)</P>
<P>Thank you Andrew, Karen and John for this tape. </P>
<P>S R I , more than ever!</P>
<P>Best wishes</P>

<P>Hi Esther, </P>
<P>Since you seem to have missed the past year and a half of discussion on 
rec.music.gaffa, here's the scoop on Fruitopia: </P>
<P>Kate did at least 12 pieces of music for the Fruitopia campaign. Eleven
confirmed  pieces have been aired in the U.S. as part of a massive commercial
campaign. I  believe eleven of these are available in video form on the Total
Tape Integration  video, circulated free this summer within the rec.music.gaffa
community. If you are  interested, post a polite request on r.m.g and I'm sure
someone will be happy to  make you a copy. There are PAL copies circulating in
Europe. It's free, all you have  to do is supply a blank and pay postage.</P>
<P>Fruitopia has two 60-second ads which are intended to run in theatres. One
of  them is on the tape; the other is available for downloading from the people
who  created the whole campaign, at the Click3X web site. I don't have the web
address  right here, but you can find it in a Yahoo search. It is a darned big
file (6 MB), so be  prepared. </P>
<P>The UK campaign for some reason added a spot with Liz the magnificent
singing,  which I've only seen once in the U.S., and she didn't seem to be
wailing at all, so  there may be TWO Liz spots. </P>
<P>So that's the scoop. We've spent the past two summers in an intesive
Fruitopia  watch as we tried to capture the videos on tape -- people were
posting what shows  Fruitopia was sponsoring (such as Star Trek DS9) and we'd
man the VCRs, trying  to capture those babies during commercial breaks. Our own
IED, guardian of the  sacred faith, was able to get most of the Fruitopia ads.</P>
<P>It seems like Fruitopia is going to add new flavors, so maybe more Kate
music  will surface. In the Iced Tea campaign they re-used some of the earlier
pieces, so  they may be out of stuff.</P>
<P>Later, Karen </P>
