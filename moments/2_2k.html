<P>While listening to &quot;You Want Alchemy&quot; for about the 70th time the
other night  the phone rang and who should it be but IED. He kindly pointed out
to me that the  secondary reason this song lingers in my mind (first reason
being obvious) is that  some lovely Debussy has been incorporated into it.

<P>Has anyone mentioned yet that the classical compostion which &quot;You want 
Alchemy&quot; reminds you of is Claude Debussy's piano work &quot;Clair de lune&quot;
 (Moonlight) ?

</P>
<P>'You Want Alchemy'. 
</P>
<P>[see <A HREF="2_1.html">Lyrics Section</A>]
</P>
<P>I have to say that my favourite lines are the last but one and the one that
goes &quot;Is  he some kind of nut - or what?&quot;. That such a sarcastic
remark should be sung so  sweetly is really very funny. 
</P>
<P>I listen to it quite a lot (unlike 'Show A Little Devotion') but even though
I really  like the song, there are some serious defects that detract from my
enjoyment. The  drum sound is truely appalling; very agressive due to a
combination of harsh EQ and  all the cymbals being far too high in the mix.
There's also an unforgivably crud edit  at 3:08.5 on the word &quot;You&quot;.
The track as a whole displays some mild digital clipping  and the cello sustain
at the end has an annoying dropout on it. This could mean that  the strings were
recorded at another studio on analogue machines (like the orchestra  for MoP) or
were recorded at Kate's place a couple of years ago before the switch  to
digital. Y'know, it's at times like this that I feel like writing to Kate and
giving  her and especially Del a damn good telling off!!! I mean... would *you*
spend 100  grand on digital multi-track and mastering recorders just to show off
your latest  failures at engineering? 
</P>
<P>The argument that 'oh well, it's just a B-side...' doesn't work (not least
because  the album has got some duff engineering on it too). If you're going to
do something,  do it properly! This has always been true but is more so now that
digital technology  makes your mistakes *that* much more obvious.

</P>
<P>One other minor point (demonstrating that IED can still spin Kate
Bushological  castles on air with the best of you): Someone suggested that You
Want Alchemy  should have been on the album. This would (in IED's view) have
been impossible, as  You Want Alchemy postdates the album. Kate referred in
interviews to the making  of The Red Shoes film as a kind of Kate Bush &quot;Magical
Mystery Tour&quot;. The  reference to &quot;our own mystery tour&quot; (and &quot;a
cloudbusting kind of day&quot;) on the track  suggest that the song recounts an
experience Kate had during the filming of the  movie.

</P>
<P>Maybe I'm projecting a lot into this song's lyrics that was never intended
by  Kate, but on first listen, my interpretation sunk in and I found myself
deeply moved.  I'm not sure I can do justice to the depths I find in it, but
I'll try to hit the high  points, as I see them. 
</P>
<P>Kate sings about meeting a beekeeper, who launches into his awe, his
reverence,  his love for bees, which she first responds to with &quot;Is he some
kind of nut, or what?&quot;  She doesn't get it, this fascination with bees. But
it's not just bees. Everyone has  something they feel passionate about. Most
people keep it private, or throw  themselves into something mundane like sports
or pop music. Nobody treats sports  enthusiasts as nuts (at least, not
typically), but if you go on and on about bees, or  Egyptian hieroglyphs, or
comic books, or anything unconventional, an eyebrow will  be raised, at the
least. 
</P>
<P>These people often tend to be misfits, loners, often hurt at the way that
people  respond (or do not respond) to their passions. But in this song, Kate
seems to take a  tender step into this man's private world, to open herself and
feel and respect this  lonely man's joys. She approaches with sympathy, and for
a brief moment, she can  share his vision, and see the alchemy. 
</P>
<P>Wouldn't it be great if we could all do that: try to see the world and its
pleasures  as do the beekeepers and everyone else in the vastness of humanity?
Discover how  to take joy in all the things you've never bothered to think about
or develop interest  it? Or at least to try to help the lonely, the
misunderstood, and to give them the rare  opportunity to share their passions
with someone else?

<P>&gt; &quot;You Want Alchemy&quot;? I have it on the Red Shoes single. It's
crap. 
</P>
<P>If we define &quot;crap&quot; as being &quot;A piece of music so increadibly
wonderful that you  can never listen to any other piece of music ever again
since the other music would  pale by comparison&quot;, then I agree, it is crap.

<P>Whoever this &quot;Drewcifer&quot; character is, he's no critic. &quot;You
Want Alchemy&quot; is  many things, but one thing it definitely isn't is crap.
Flip, mindless judgements like  &quot;Drewcifer&quot;'s are, precisely, crap. &quot;You
Want Alchemy&quot; is a non-album track that  appeared as a b-side of one of the
two CD-singles of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. It is  extremely interesting, both
from a musical and a Kate Bushological perspective, and  it is well worth
hearing -- MANY TIMES, LOUD.

</P>
<P>I must confess: After seeing Kate's movie, &quot;The Line, The Cross &amp;
The Curve,&quot;  the prattle of a handful of stentorian naysayers began to worm
its way into my brain  and I began to doubt. 
</P>
<P>But now that I have experienced &quot;You Want Alchemy,&quot; I realize the
error of my  ways and recant: Yes, KATE IS GOD! 
</P>
<P>This song is pure genius. At first, I was tempted to mention a few of the
allusions  and musical forms and other such aspects of this piece that I enjoy,
but I then  realized that such scientific analysis of Kate Misses The Point and
performs a Great  Injustice to Her work. Therefore, I will let it speak for
itself:

<P>&gt; Why do I dislike &quot;You Want Alchemy&quot;?  The chord progression
is dreadfully  monotonous, the Kate-screech is wasted on the wimpy chorus, and a
charming motif  is ruined by a lack of interesting treatment. Go to town!  --
Drew 
</P>
<P>Never! IED appreciates your explanation. Naturally, he doesn't share your 
judgement that the chord progression is monotonous (though it is repetitious),
that  the Kate-screech is wasted on the &quot;wimpy&quot; chorus (though the
disharmony between  what he prefers to think of as Kate's impassioned vocal and
the [rather &quot;languid&quot;  than &quot;wimpy&quot;] chorus is striking), or
that the &quot;perfectly charming motif&quot; (which all  will long since have
identified as a quotation of a phrase from Debussy's Clair de  lune) is &quot;ruined
by a lack of interesting treatment&quot;  (though he concedes that the 
recording is more or less the same from beginning to end). Nevertheless, your
points  are instructive and do a lot to explain your opinion to this hopelessly
devout follower  of Kate.
