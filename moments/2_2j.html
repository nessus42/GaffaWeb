</P>
<P>I know she has a Solid State Logic (SSL) console, because I saw her in some
SSL  literature with her board. Those things don't go cheap. I don't know what
else she  has, but I wouldn't mind knowing. Gods knows I've begged her to let me
record or  mix something for years (that's what I do for a living). My wish came
true when I  worked on Why Should I Love You when I worked for Prince, but I
hated what he  did to that song so much it killed me. 
</P>
<P>anyway...

</P>
<P>So, lolife, tell us about this experience. We're curious little animals, the
Love  Hounds. 
</P>
<P>Did you ever get to talk to Kate in person? 
</P>
<P>What did you get from Kate to work with? One song or several? 
</P>
<P>What did Prince do with it?
</P>
<P>Is it true he sent back an enormous tape of material? 
</P>
<P>What did Kate use compared to what he sent, that is, what of his work is
part of  the song?
</P>
<P>Was what you got substantially different from what the finished work is now?
</P>
<P>Do you have a copy of what Kate sent over? 
</P>
<P>Thanks! Karen

</P>
<P>&lt; Did you ever get to talk to Kate in person? 
</P>
<P>I did, but only for a short moment. I was at home and the phone rang. I
didn't  always answer the phone in those days, because I was severly overworked.
So my  answering machine picked it up and I heard Julie, from Paisley Park,
saying &quot;Mike, I  got Kate Bush on the phone and she has some questions
about what format they  should send things over on, and I thought it would be
best if she talked to you. I,  being an admitted Kate Bush fan, freaked, but
picked up the phone and talked to  Julie. She says, Kate, I have Prince's
engineer Michael Koppelman on the phone and  he can answer your questions.
Meanwhile, my answering machine is still recording it  all, and blaring loudly.
I tell my then girlfriend to shut if off just as Kate comes on  and says Hello
Michael? (so to this day, if I could find it, i have a tape of Kate saying 
hello to me...). The conversation consisted only of her asking me if they could
send  24-track tapes and what series SSL computer disks. I also asked her if she
was going  to come to Minneapolis, and she said I don't think I'm wanted out
there right now.  Then we basically said good-bye and hung up.
</P>
<P>It's funny because Prince knew I was a huge KB fan. He was too, but not like
 me. The first time I asked him if he liked Kate Bush he said, she's my favorite
 woman. I also made him a tape of all the KB b-sides, which fucking rule. When
The  Sensual World came out he had someone go get it and we listened to it in
the studio.  He didn't dig it that much, but I knew you can't always tell right
away with a Kate  album. TSW grew on me, but it is still not her best effort.
This Woman's Work is a  masterpiece, though, and makes the whole album worth it.
But I digress. Prince is  weird, and a couple stories in this post prove it. I
may be tooting my own horn here,  but Prince has a weird ego. I think *part* of
his motivation to work with Kate was  the fact that I worshipped her, and he
knew it would impress me that he could call  her on the phone and work on her
music and shit. 
</P>
<P>ANYWAY, what led up to the phone conversation above: one day Prince's 
assistant, Therese, told me as we were talking on the phone that Kate Bush had 
called. Therese also knew I was a big Kate fan. Then, in the studio that day,
Prince  said, guess who I talked to today. Me, being stupid and unable to keep
my mouth  shut, said, Kate Bush? Prince got a little miffed, and said How did
you know that?  And I said Therese told me, and he said, hmm, I should dock here
for that. At that  point I knew I fucked up and tried to say, no, she just knew
I'm a big fan. As a side  note, I told Therese that Prince was a little pissed
that she had told me that, and she  apologized to him. Therese is a really cool
person. So, Prince tells me that he and  Kate are going to work on a tune
together. He also told me that while they were  talking he told her that his
engineer would rather work with her than him. (I  thought, wow, Prince and Kate
Bush talking about me!). 
</P>
<P>ANYWAY, Eventually the phone call above occured and the tapes arrived and I 
put them up and got a rough mix up. I still have a cassette of it. It fucking
rules. It is  1 million times better than the lame disco Prince put on it. There
was, of course, no  disco on it before Prince got his hands on it. So Prince
comes in and listens to it.  And the brutality began. First we sampled the drum
thing and synced it up to my  Powerbook so we could do MIDI. At that point, we
essentially created a new song on  a new piece of tape and then flew all of
Kate's tracks back on top of it. So now we  could run the sequencer and add all
the keyboards that Prince put on. So Prince  stacked a bunch of keys, guitars,
basses, etc, on it and then went to sing background  vocals. 
</P>
<P>When Prince does vocals, he sits right at the recording console with a 
microphone hanging over it and does his own punching in and out. So he kicks 
everyone out of the room when he sings. It took him a few hours and then he
called  me back in and played me the thick, multi-tracked background vocals he
had put  on. Now, as we all know, the song in question goes &quot;Of all the
people in the world  why should i love you&quot;. When Prince called me back in
and played me what he had  done, he had sung &quot;All of the people in the
world&quot;, instead of Of All. I said, isn't it  OF all the people in the
world? Not ALL of? He said, no, we had a little talk about  that, in his cocky
way, as if to say he had talked with Kate about changing the words  to &quot;all
of&quot; instead of &quot;of all&quot;.
</P>
<P>The next day, I was waiting at my hotel room for the call to go to the
studio when  the assistant engineer, Sylvia Massy, called and said Prince was in
the studio doing  vocals. I was surprised; i was always called well in advance
of Prince going into the  studio. When I got there he was changing all the
vocals to &quot;Of All&quot;, and was  sampling them in himself, which is
something he would normally never do himself.  My interpetation? He made a
mistake, as humans do, and didn't have the guts to  admit it. That's weird. So I
sorta poked my head in at one point and asked him if he  needed any help, and we
went on with the day. Eventually he had me do a rough  mix, and when he had
approved it, we sent it to Kate. 
</P>
<P>I got a call from Therese a few days (or weeks, I forget) later. She said,
Kate  Bush said to destroy all copies of that mix. I said, huh? Did she not like
it or  something? (my heart rejoiced, because I hated what Prince did to it) She
said, I  don't know, she just said to destroy them. Later on Prince told me,
Kate Bush liked  what we did. She said it sounded very American. So at that
point I wasn't sure if  she was even going to use it. We sent the tapes back and
she sort of split the  difference with what he sent and what's on the record.
Kate, if you read this, stick  the pre-Prince version of Why Should I Love You
out on something. And let me do a  remix of Not This Time.

<P>DISCLAIMER: The above is my perception of what occured. I was there, and 
that's what I thought of it. I did not intend to invade anyone's privacy, nor
have I  signed a non-disclosure agreement with any of the parties mentioned. I
also want to  add that I truly enjoyed my years working for Prince, but the man
treats people as if  he thinks he is actually &quot;better&quot; than them, like
he's royalty or something, and that  makes it hard to look back on working with
him fondly.

<P>Wow. Very interesting story. Sigh. I suppose it would be bad to ask you to
digitize  that rough mix of Kate's original. I'd put it up on my web site.

</P>
<P>YO! LoLife! Thanks for the tale from the upper reaches of the music
kingdom!! 
</P>
<P>How often do we get that kind of inside view? 
</P>
<P>I suppose that in some ways, Prince must'ave been fairly honest in &quot;purple
rain&quot;  as the character you present resembles the character from the
movie... say, just a bit  self-centered.
</P>
<P>Ah well, the ways of genius. I guess its Ok as long as his checks don't
bounce.

Subject: Lost Prince ?
</P>
<P>Okay, am I nuts, or does anyone else remember an interview where someone
told  a rather long and detailed story about how the TAPE containing the Prince
vocal  that Kate decided to use was lost? 
</P>
<P>I have an almost clear memory of someone being interviewed and talking about
 how they searched the studio for days trying to find this TAPE and since it
never  turned up, pulled someone (sorry bud, I've already forgotten your name,
too!) into  the studio to recreate Prince's vocal. 
</P>

<P> I believe it turned into gaffa, myself . . .
