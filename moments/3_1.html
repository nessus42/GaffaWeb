<P>Hiya, </P>
<P>just flipping channels I caught Paul King announcing 'Kate Bush'. Normally
Paul  does 'Greatest Hits', but no, this time it's for First Look! So it has to
be something  new! Watch it now (in about 8 minutes...) or tomorrow at 13:30 CET
/ 12:30 GMT.  Actually they had First Look today afternoon, but of course I
missed it then... </P>

</P>
<P>Hi </P>
<P>48 seconds... that's all Paul King showed of the new Rubberband Girl video
on  MTV First Look. Why didn't they show the complete thing? Why? WHY?!??? Well,
 then 48 seconds have to suffice for the moment! </P>
<P>First a statement I think I have to make: Rubberband Girl in fact sounds
much  better in hifi than it did in 8kHz 8bit mono soundfile. So much better
that I think  I'll start liking the song. Better: loving the song. Kate - your
voice is as beautiful as  ever, that really was the low-fi. </P>
<P>Now to the video: </P>
<P>Kate looks great, she's dancing with some male dancer who moves more or less
 exactly the way she does. Some of the movements Kate puts her feet onto the
feet of  the dancer and so they move synchronously. Looks funny. Looks great.
Did I say that  Kate looks great too? Yes I did. But it's true. No. It's not
enough: She looks  gorgeous! In the background a lot of musicians play a various
mixture of  instruments, as far as I could see Prince was not inbetween them,
even if he was  audible on BVs and guitar in the 48 seconds they showed. Well,
probably Prince was  too busy with his tour to appear in the video. Have I said
before that I think the  video is great? Yes? Doesn't matter, it can be said
repeatedly... </P>
<P>[rewind, play again...] Aaaahhhhh!!! finally! </P>
<P>Ah yes, Paul King still thinks that the album will be released on October
4th, but  he was wrong last time too... Let's just hope it will stay October
4th! At least in the UK. </P>
<P>[rewind, play again...] Aaaaahhhhhh!!!! FINALLY! </P>
<P>Actually the male dancer behind her leads her arms and legs through the
dance.  Almost like if Kate were a GIRL puppet fixed with some RUBBERBAND to
him. </P>
<P>[rewind, play again...] AAAAHHHHH!!! FINALLY!!! </P>
<P>HEY! Wouldn't that be my first song interpretation! And one that's not
questionable! </P>
<P>[rewind, play again...] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
FINALLY!!!!!!!!! </P>
<P>Well, come to think of it, her body is also stripped to the male dancer's
body. </P>
<P>[rewind, play again...] turning up volume </P>
<P>[rewind, play again...] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA... </P>
<P>KATE! Why don't you tour? Looking good and feeling fit for dancing through a
 tour? [rewind, play again...] </P>

</P>
<P>The first 3 mins were shown on The ITV Chart Show in the UK on Saturday.
</P>
<P>&gt; Now to the video: Kate looks great, she's dancing with some male dancer
</P>
<P>Stewart Arnold, I think - he's supposed to be in the film, and the video is
part of the film. </P>
<P>The musicians: there's a brass section of four, three guitarists, a bassist
and a  drummer (mostly out of shot). I didn't recognise any of them. </P>
<P>I don't think Prince had any direct involvment with this track -still sounds
as if  he influenced it though. I think all the bvs could actually be KaTe. </P>
<P>&gt; Actually the male dancer behind her leads her arms and legs through the
dance.  Almost like if Kate were a GIRL puppet fixed with some RUBBERBAND to
him. </P>
<P>Yes, for the first verse or so, Stewart (assuming it is he) is holding
KaTe's arms  and they perform the same steps in unison. Then, when KaTe sings &quot;When
I step  out...&quot;, he collapses on the floor and she steps over his arm. Then
they do a more  physical sequence involving a bit of falling over and rolling on
the floor. The  choreography is remininscent of the RutH video, with maybe a
little of the Them  Heavy People vid too. </P>
<P>Starting from the beginning, the whole video seems to be set in the dance
studio  shown in the RbG cover art.The musicians are standing around at the
sides of the  studio, and KaTe and the male dancer walk in to shot in front of
them as the camera  pans and wheels above the studio. KaTe is wearing a grey
top, baggy dark blue  sweat pants (I think that's what you call 'em), a black
cardigan and something else  tied round her waist (must be a cold studio 8-). No
straightjackets to be seen! Her  hair looks as if she's just washed it. She
never looks directly at the camera (this is  supposed to be a proper movie after
all), nor does she smile much. </P>
<P>During the instrumental break, there is a slow-motion sequence of KaTe 
boucning on an out-of-shot trampoline. Then all the guitarists parade in front
of the  camera, one of them pretends to do the solo bit....and then we cut to
the next video.....</P>
<P>Anybody seen the Eat the Music video yet? (I presume there is one?) </P>

</P>
<P>Scott Telford spoils my description by taking away almost everything by 
describing it himself: </P>
<P>&gt; tied round her waist (must be a cold studio 8-). No straightjackets to
be seen!  Her hair looks as if she's just washed it. She never looks directly at
the camera (this  is supposed to be a proper movie after all), nor does she
smile much. </P>
<P>The straitjacket was just cut off by ITV I think. That was what I called the
 surprise with respect to clothing. The last minute Kate is throwing the super
long  arms around her... </P>
<P>&gt; in front of the camera, one of them pretends to do the solo bit....and
then we  cut to the next video..... </P>
<P>And then the straitjacket is presented... </P>
<P>BTW: I think the studio might actually be a dance studio - these are the
only  ones with the big mirrors in there. And there is one: It can be seen once
for a short  time, where only the legs and feet of Kate and Stewart can be
seen... Where have  they hidden the mirror for the rest of the video? Oh,
there's another scene where  you see the mirror. Again only with Kate's and
Stuart's legs. And with the boyzs  with guitarz in the background - they are all
left-handed suddenly ;-). </P>

<P>...was shown again on the ITV Chart Show this Saturday. They didn't show any
 more of it - somehow I don't think we're going to see the whole thing on 
terrestrial UK tv. </P>
<P>While looking at the vid in slow motion I've noticed a couple of things:
</P>
<P>- I *do* recognise the drummer - it's Stuart Elliot (I think - the one who
was at  the Secret Policeman's Third Ball) </P>
<P>- There seem to be a couple of people visible throughout the video, standing
 nonchalantly right at the back of the dance studio, behind the musicians, one
of  whom is holding a paper cup. They're pretty much out-of-focus all the time,
but I  have a sneaking suspicion they're actually Krys and Dave from Homeground,
and  that Peter's been keeping stumm about their latest acting exploits 8-) </P>

<P>Well, the Spotlight just ended and they showed &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;
!! Other than  that, there was an assortment of Kate videos including Wuthering
Heights, Them  Heavy People, Breathing, The Dreaming, Sat In Your Lap,
Cloudbusting, Experiment  4 and This Woman's Work. As usual, there were mini
Kate interview clips spliced  in between the videos. All of them were taken from
interviews conducted by  MuchMusic VJ's from 1985-1989. Some text mentioned the
release of The Red Shoes  as being in early November. </P>

<BR> Subject: Rubberband Girl on Muchmusic </P>
<P>Hooray! Muchmusic played the Rubberband Girl video at the end of their  &quot;Spotlight&quot;
on Kate B. last night (as no doubt, 500 other Canucks will post - but hey,  I'm
in the second earliest time zone here so *I* get to be one of the first :) )
This was a  surprise because the &quot;spotlight&quot; is usually old videos
intercut with video of old  interviews. </P>
<P>What can I say? WOW! I love this song! Although I have a great weakness for 
girly dance pop like Bananarama, and I suspect that many people like Kate B. 
precisely because she does not do this sort of music... But doesn't it show how 
talented she is that she can do a song of this sort and do it so well? </P>
<P>As for the mystery guitarist - geez, he looked to me kind of like Phil
Collen of  Def Leppard (who is a vegetarian too!). </P>
<P>Incidentally, one of the &quot;old&quot; interview clips was from when TSW
came out. I  don't know where or when it was shot but, ahem, Kate looked really
bad. She  appeared to be a little chubby and had this horrible hairdo with about
5,000 tons of  hairspray and gel to make it all curly. Whoever did her up did a
terrible job. She  looked like Ann Wilson in the Heart videos where they try to
make her appear like  she is not overweight! Sigh... </P>

<P>Description of the new video: </P>
<P>This is much more a promo video than the film excerpt that the earlier video
 was. Kate is wearing sunglasses about half the time, she's dancing a lot, alone
and  together with her male partner, no band can be seen, quite a lot of
solarizing effects  are used, many more locations are filmed than in the first
video, several film  excerpts from The Line, The Cross And The Curve are shown,
together with the  vocal parts of these pieces. </P>

<P>The new Kate video was played at 12:00 AM CST, so those on the west coast
can  catch it in an hour or so. A warning...Kate was obviously told by record
weasels to  make a video for the &quot;American market&quot; and she is
obviously poking fun at that.  The new &quot;American&quot; bits have Kate
wearing *sunglasses* (we only have one photo  and one bit of video of Kate in
sunglasses, and both times she was outdoors) and  carrying and prop microphone
and stand around in perfect &quot;rock star&quot; form.

<BR> Subject: RbG US Video Coments </P>
<P>I like to make my own initial observations about art, if it's not very
difficult to do  so, before reading someone elses. Having said that, here are
some of my own  observations and/or ponderings: </P>
<P>In making the RbG US video she is being a rubberband girl and not resisting
the  &quot;wind&quot;. The existence of the video fits the song. </P>
<P>The video is rather MTVish; she met the request/challenge to make it and 
directed it *herself*. How many artists can say that about any of their videos?
It's  cool to see that she can kick some ass (IMHO) even if she's not totally on
her turf;  that's a greater test of ones strength. It sounded like she enjoyed
making it and  made it pretty fast (is that right?) so I can imagine her
thinking, &quot;So you want an  American video, huh? *chuckle* *poof* with a
twist.... now on to something really  challenging...&quot;. If she didn't enjoy
it at all then I wish she hadn't made it though. I  enjoyed watching it, which
doesn't necessarily mean I want all of her videos to be  like this one. </P>
<P>From a different view, clips from the movie are shown, with phrases like &quot;You
 are under the spell of the red shoes,&quot; and then immediately &quot;It's
really happened to  ya.&quot; Is this video an example of the spell? Or is it a
break from the spell? This video  is different for her. </P>
<P>Right after singing &quot;Here I go...&quot; she is dancing in a straight
jacket with the  rubberband man *but* the jacket is untied and the long sleeves
are flapping about  while she makes the rubberband noises. Is she being freed by
not resisting the  &quot;wind&quot; or is she showing the restrictions in making
this video. Perhaps it's both:  having as much freedom as she can, given a
limitation. No one ever has total  freedom. Maybe it means nothing. Art also
depends on the eye of the beholder and  I've eyed enough; my eyes are tired.
</P>
<P>Is she sort of making a female sign at the end?? </P>
<P>I think the album may do rather well here, for better or worse. I just hope
that a  large number of new KT fans will enjoy the depths of all her work and
that this  won't be like Bobby McFerrin's &quot;Don't Worry Be Happy&quot; where
everyone now  says &quot;Isn't he that don't worry be happy guy?&quot; (direct
quote) and don't realize his  talent. &quot;Isn't she that rubberband girl?&quot;
Eeeeeeek! </P>

<BR> Subject: Lip-synching </P>
<P>The reason why MTV spurned the original &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; video
*is* obvious  after seeing the movie, though: It just doesn't make any sense
taken out of the  context of the movie. It doesn't even make sense in the movie
until after the scene  is over. For the whole song we see Kate doing a dance
routine with a male dancer,  but Kate looks weary and tired through the whole
thing. We find out in a little bit  that Kate's dissatisfaction with her
performance is integral to the plot of the movie,  but if this section of the
film were just clipped into a video, viewers would just  wonder why anyone had
bothered to make a video of a singer looking tired and  weary. Also, this is a
flaw in the movie, since on first viewing, this scene isn't very  enjoyable
--you just start thinking, &quot;well Kate isn't the performer she used to be.&quot;
 You don't have any indication that this is what you are supposed to be
thinking. </P>

<P>Er... What's it all about? </P>
<P>The Video starts with KaTe kneeling while twirling (?) her head (Great Hair!
 Yum) in time to the music. Then it switches to KaTe swaying to the rythm with a
 cast of Caribbean (?) people dancing around her. There is a huge pile of fruit
in  front of them. The music floats along and the scene switches in between
people  breaking fruits, a pair of Red Shoes dancing (crushing more like it) on
the fruits and  KaTe swaying to the music. Finally, it switches to KaTe twirling
her head (like the  start of the video) with red stripes painted on her face and
it ends with KaTe  collapsing from exhaustion. </P>
<P>Throughout the video, KaTe has a very sombre/down expression on here face. 
She only smiled once throughout the entire video. </P>

<P>I personally like to hear or see things for myself before reading what
others  think but here's what I think: </P>
<P>I agree! The video really shows that. People start out dancing calmly with
almost  somber expressions but then &quot;eat the music&quot; more and more and
let go and Kate  smiles more and waves her hair around (enough to &quot;rip my
heart out&quot;) and people  close their eyes and dance freely and fruit is
split open and they start to fall down in  the fruit from exhaustion and so does
Kate. </P>
<P>My very first, and short-lived, reaction was &quot;that's all?&quot;,
probably because she  doesn't move around much, just does the same moves over
and over in the same  place but it works, it really does. I wonder if the main
male dancer is the same one  from the UK single... the rubberband support man?

Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: &quot;Eat the
Music&quot; video </P>
<P>Those who taped, or had friends who taped the premier of the video for &quot;Eat
the  Music&quot; on 120 Minutes last Sunday, have now had time to look at it a
little. Supposing  those who don't have access to it are curious, I thought I
might edit together some  of my efforts to describe it this week for Andy
Marvick, who wasn't able to catch  the broadcast and was not just curious but &quot;expiring
from the pain&quot; of missing it. </P>
<P>It is totally glorious, of course &lt;message from IED&gt;, and let me start
with the  color. One sign that it is shot on film rather than video is the
somewhat uncertain  translation for video display of the lusciousness of the
colors, which have been  perfected to make the natural ripeness of the fruit
come through. Kate is wearing a  long fitted fruit-print dress, some sort of
flowing fabric, perhaps silk. The skirt is  ample, draped to the ankles, the top
fitted, the neckline deep enough that a little  decolletage is flashed when she
wheels herself from the waist, extending the gesture  with her head so that her
hair is whipped around in circles. On her left shoulder is a  big green fabric
bow; the dress is mostly oranges and reds and greens on a calm,  rich, light
golden buff. </P>
<P>The video begins as suddenly and in-the-midst-of-things as the track,
initially  (the first 10 seconds) with Kate squatting in the midst of the fruit
and swinging her  head and hair about in the visual theme with which the video
will end. But the  actual start has Kate dressed as described, standing in the
foreground of a small  crowd who are dancing before a huge cornucopia of
tropical fruits, spilling out of  baskets into a mass that fills the bottom half
of the screen. She is swinging and  swaying to the music, and we see her mostly
in head-and-torso shots, with only a  couple of brief pairs of full body takes.
She is featured, but not to the exclusion of a  whole little crowd of fellow
party-goers who are all in the moment with her: blacks  of a variety of shades
and body types that to me spells Caribbean rather than South  American. Someone
here on lh said she looks gloomy; totally false. She is smiling all  along,
except that most of the time it is the interior smile of someone who has 
attained true sensuous abandon. This is the most erotic Kate I have seen since 
&quot;Hammer Horror&quot; in performance, or &quot;James and the Cold Gun,&quot;
except now she  has brought it a hell of a lot closer to herself. She is not
erotic as a sex object (as  indeed she has never been), but as an sensuous
subject, with whom anybody human  can identify. </P>
<P>Early on (1:15) our eye is drawn to one particular black fellow, a couple of
rows  behind her in the crowd, who seems to be in as much of a transport as she
is. A  symmetry in the construction of the video frames his initial appearance
as a soloist:  the two pairs of full-length shots of Kate lie on either side of
his introduction. But in  the early going, the main thing thrown before us is
the cut to some feet, in red ballet  shoes and semi-opaque tights riddled with
runs, shot from just at the edge of a long  skirt much like Kate is wearing,
that are tredding on the fruit and plainly making  sloppy landings and a general
mess. I couldn't tell whether the print on the skirt  marked this dancer as the
same Kate featured in the video, but it doesn't matter,  because at no point in
the video overall is Kate standing or dancing in the midst of  the fruit. She is
just behind it while she is swaying erect, and she is only in the midst  of it
when she is kneeling in the last half of the video. So this image of red-shod 
dancer's feet comes from outside the video. It doesn't seem to have a narrative 
connection to anything else however, only a thematic one (like the lighted
candles in  MoP and the RM video). </P>
<P>Anyway, insofar as anything 'happens' in the video, it is a powerful
evocation of  Dionysian frenzy. After the preview of the head swinging, and the
first theme of  Kate swaying to the music and the introduction of the rest of
the crowd, the first big  shift (2:25) has Kate kneeling in the midst of the
fruit, her dress flowing into it in  both color and liquidity to such a degree
that she almost looks like a special effect,  swaying from the hips with arms
extended in gestures that harken back to &quot;Moving,&quot;  and with two red
stripes painted onto each cheek. Now the black man we noticed  earlier comes to
stand directly behind her, and he swings his right arm in a great  circle above
her head, 'stirring' her into the circling motion that continues to the  end of
the video. It is a very athletic move on her part, and at its best moments (that
 are not consistently achieved throughout--there is some editing out of lack of 
synchronization) the effect of her fluency and the black man's stirring lead is
quite  uncanny. Just for the shoot itself, nevermind the editing, Kate had to
protract this  move to an amazing degree. She pivots from her waist, in a
kneeling position, settled  on her heels thigh deep in fruit, and rotates her
torso through 360 degrees in a way  that itself would make you a cripple without
a warmup. But then she amplifies the  swing with her head, rolling it around
from her chest and shoulders to whip the  hair, with an amplitude that would
make anybody untrained into a paraplegic. </P>
<P>Now the black dancer, who is clearly present as a soloist, not just a member
of  the corps de ballet, enters into duet with Kate with respect to technical
abandon. He  starts jerking his head around its circle with a violence that at
first made me assume  that some kind of video strobe processing was involved,
because what he was doing  would surely turn one's brain to jello. But I think
not; this is just his technical gift.  Kate just keepings wheeling herself
around with the music, but he, and the others in  the crowd, grow progressively
more frantic and extreme. At 3:30 Kate is shown  continuing her wheeling along
with two women on either side of her, and the black  man is back in the crowd.
But at 4:05 he is behind her again, as serious frenzy starts  to break out. In a
shot that goes by fast, a guy with a loose tropical yellow shirt on  grabs it at
its bosom spots and pulls it out to mimic two huge breasts. One by one,  people
start falling into the fruit pile. The other soloist goes down before Kate, and 
the video ends when she keels over--but she is not the last of the revelers to
lapse.  There are still others in the frenzy as the fade arrives. </P>
<P>The knock on this video that was heard this past week is that &quot;it's
boring&quot; and  &quot;there is no story.&quot; Perhaps the most revealing
complaint was that that Kate looks  &quot;really down&quot; in this video,
flashes only one smile. As to looking 'down'; yes,  indeed, in the
standing-swaying passage, she alternately looks out at us, then down.  But this
is no sign that she is downcast! Au contraire, she is withdrawing into the 
interior of the sensuality of her movements with the music, the liquidity of the
long  skirt. When she looks up again it is in bold acknowledgement of how she is
inviting  us to regard her, so that far from being gloomy her expression is the
serious gaze of  a woman for her lover. Finally, her &quot;one smile&quot;
(unobservant; there are two or three  takes of an extended and developing
expression) signals an abandonment to the  interior so intense that she can no
longer come out of it to meet our gaze. </P>
<P> Everything about this video serves to help us move INTO it, to find our way
into  what Andy Marvick deftly calls &quot;the moment&quot;: the moment that
wants to be eternal  but falls in with the fruit. This is why the extended
version of EtM is more perfect  than the single itself. It can only be endured
if you stop waiting for something and  enter INTO it. </P>
<P>For me, &quot;The Big Sky&quot; was a parallel experience. I found the album
track boring.  The extended remix began to redirect my attention, and the video
finally had me  giddy with joy. </P>
<P>Have I told you that I 'like' this video? I don't even know that for myself
yet.  I'm still working on simply seeing it as a Kate Bush work. This involves
looking for  the craft involved: the stagecraft; the choreography; the dancing
and the mime (with  Kate, the eyes especially); the visual production (colors
above all else); the  opportunity for the second soloist and the collaboration
involved there; and finally,  via the squooshing red dance shoes, the connection
to the still unmanifested album  &quot;The Red Shoes.&quot; </P>
<P>Kate Bush remains decidedly impatient with efforts to trivialize and
patronize her  work by personalizing her as a 'pop star'. Everything I have said
to this point has  tried to be description, not judgment or personal opinion.
Let's try our best to  discern what she is doing before we make up our minds
about whether we are  happy about it. </P>

<P>There has been a movement in the UK and other 25-fps areas to shift from
24-fps  to 25-fps for film production. Modern cameras and projectors are quite
capable of  the slight shift in speed, and the benefits outweigh the slight
increase in amount of  film used. The main benefit is the total eliminiation of
the need for *any* frame  interpolation. This is a very good thing; 24 to 25
produced more annoying artifacts  than 24 to 30. I can hardly wait to see this
film in PAL. </P>

<P>Now to the VIDEO! 8-) It reads on the spine: </P>
<P>EMI Australia <BR> Kate Bush - Red Shoe Introduction <BR> Promotional
Video <BR> Here comes the blow-by-blow of what was on it... </P>
<P>It starts with TRS logo rolling into picture from the right and then the
title  TRS/KT appearing around it with TRS to the top like the UK/Oz album
cover. The  background music swells into ASiL and then we fade into a beautiful
still of KT.  After about 5 seconds of this the TRS logo rolls past and this
sweeps us into RBG  (the original version) This video is pretty much the
standard original RBG -but- I  believe the colour is much brighter then all the
versions I've seen on TV. We get  about 3 mins of that and then just before the
'Ninja KaTe' bit we sweep into MoP  from the Aspel &amp; Co. appearance. There
is a disclaimer as this starts 'Television  Appearance'. We get all of MoP (a
beautiful clip BTW IMHO) and then sweep into  EtM. This one is NOT the US EtM
video (which I've never seen :-( ) but a series of  wonderful stills which last
about 10 seconds and then we sweep into the &quot;MTV&quot; RBG  clip. What a
scream that clip is :-) I quite like it in a perverse sort of way. Anyway,  we
get the WHOLE clip this time and to the end we also get various flashes of 'The 
Line, the Cross, the Curve&quot;. </P>
<P>Now I think this is where what I've got is different from what everyone else
has  seen. I gather from all the postings that the US love-hounds get the same
video BUT  don't get any voice over. I get full sound and voice for these small
clips from the  video (TRS soundtrack is sort of muted to the background) So I
can hear Lily say  'She's under the spell of The Red Shoes', etc. If you want
I'll transcribe all that is  said for gaffa(?) From here we sweep back to the
TRS logo which bounces away like  rubber. End video. Total play time about 13
minutes. </P>

<BR> Subject: Re: The Dead Bird </P>
<P>To perhaps increase information, in the &quot;video&quot; for ASiL there
isn't a single shot  where a moving bird becomes lifeless. A bird does hit a
dingy window and flutters  downward, off camera. This seems to be the main shot
where a bird could have been  injured. The camera was fixed on a couple panes of
a huge, wall-sized window, like  of a studio, and the bird hit there. It
certainly looks real but it would seem rather  difficult to get this shot
without some sort of preparation or tricks. </P>
<P>After that there are shots of a dead bird, almost certainly a real one. It's
probably  stuffed since I doubt they would make a fake one when there are
already stuffed  ones anyway and it seems rather stiff too. A bird is never
shown actually dying or  obviously injured anyway. Hope this helps. </P>
<P>From memory I had thought there was a shot of the bird moving after hiting
the  window but I re-watched it and was wrong. (Earlier on Kate picks up and is
holding  a live bird though.) </P>

<BR> Subject: KT on TOTP Thoughts </P>
<P>Well, I just saw Kate Bush on Top of the Pops tonight. I have waited for
this since  last Saturday, when I first heard she'd appear in the show. But I'm
sorry, I just felt  it was disappointing. </P>
<P>Some things were still the same: just like in 1978, there was a group of
people  standing around the stage, gazing at Kate in awe, as they should, and
the program  was still Top of the Pops, and she was still Kate. </P>
<P>My first disappointment was her not singing live, while other very &quot;talented&quot;
 artists like Suede and Sheryl Crow did. I had expected Kate to sing live, since
it  would be pretty futile to come on the TV for a lipsynch. She did synch last
year at  Aspel, but at least there she also did an interview. </P>
<P>The second was the rather uneventful stage choreography. Kate was
accompanied  by two female backing singers, dressed in black. She stood near
motionless, also  dressed in black. The leather jacket she wore over an
undoubtedly beautiful black  garment made her look rather pompous, FMFSS. Her
face did express great fatigue.  It seems to me Kate is very bored with the
public side of her career, and so I keep  wondering what tempted her to appear
on TOTP at all. </P>
<P>On the up side: she did sing the song professionally and conveyed the sad
emotion  of the song very well. But I was probably not waiting for
professionalism. </P>
<P>Before I have a big verbal fight with some avid fans on this list I will say
this: </P>
<P>I have long, and probably will always be, a Big Fan of Kate. There's nothing
and  no-one who can change that. I just feel she has thrown away one important
part of  her career, that being her PR. She does, besides making and releasing
her  wonderful music and films, absolutely nothing to please her fans anymore.
This  appearance on TOTP was like saying: &quot;So, here I am, look at me, I
will be gone for  three years now, and I don't want to make an effort in singing
live or do anything  extra. Don't ask me to do more, this is all you're gonna
get. I think it's enough.&quot; </P>
<P>I know, where fans are concerned nothing is ever enough, but only the
cynical  jokes about her tour in the FAQ say something about the way we perceive
Kate  these days. It makes me sad to think those questions will also apply to
all of her  public appearances. </P>
<P>&quot;Kate, are you in there?&quot; </P>
<P>- &quot;Yes. Go away.&quot; </P>
