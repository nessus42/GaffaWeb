	 <P>I went to the record store with a friend whose wife left him recently. I
		picked up "The Red Shoes", since that was the main goal of the trip. He said
		"Ah - the new Kate Bush, grab me one too." I told him maybe we'd better take
		mine home and play it first. </P> 
	 <P>He was in tears by the end of this song, and he decided he'd buy it
		later. </P>

	 <P>Upon close inspection [if you can inspect sound] the jury returns a
		verdict of 'NO TREACLE'. </P> 
	 <P>She does in fact sing, </P> 
	 <P> "sugar... honey... sugar....WHAYEE-EE-EEAHAGH.... sugar.... sugar".
		</P> 
	 <P>I can see how the fourth *word* could be construed to mean 'treacle' :-)

	 <P>Oh hello, Heidi here. </P> 
	 <P>I'm not actually able to e-mail anyone coz I don't have access to an
		account and I'm not keen with a computer really. A friend of mine who does have
		access, told me about my letter being mailed to the group, and seeing as though
		I'm staying at his house at the moment I thought I'd take advantage of this
		privelage(?). I thought I'd better add, that this letter was written a long
		time ago and it was just a little thing I noticed one day. I didn't expect it
		to get printed, I suppose I was trying to be a bit of a clever cloggs. Do
		things like this have to be taken so seriously? Okay, it's a saaad song, I
		thought that little cheeky twist at the end lifted it a bit, made it a bit more
		fly-away, y'know (sorry, just stirring!!). I'll tell you where I think it is.
		It's after the last, "sugar?" but quite a way after it, nearer the end. It's
		sung a lot lower than the "sugar?...honey?...sugar?" bit...get those headphones
		on and listen a little harder. I'm really sorry for wasting the time of all
		those millions who aren't really interested (I thought I'd better say that coz
		Garrick said I'll get flamed), it's Oh so trivial and so much so that I'm
		saying nothing more about it. ( by the way, I'm only 17 and so can get away
		with being so blummin' daft, that's my excuse). TA. </P>

	 <P>In response to Heidi (?) who wondered wheather or not Kate sang
		'treacle' at the end of 'YTO', after 'honey, sugar, honey'...the answer is yes.
		I played the song a few times to verify it, and IMHO, yes Kate does sing
		'treacle'. </P>

	 <P>You're the One (treacle): </P> 
	 <P>Because there isn't much news around, please listen again to "You're the
		One". Thank you Heidi for bring this up. I love those little mysteries and I
		think it's much nearer to Kate than most of last weeks mails. So, no one will
		flame you, Heidi! </P> 
	 <P>'TREACLE' is located as follows: (in sec.) </P> 
	 <P>4'49 first "Sugar" <BR> 4'57 "Honey" <BR> 5'04 second "Sugar" <BR> 5'13
		cry "Whayee-ee-eeahagh" or something like that<BR> 5'23 "Treacle" , in a much
		lower voice. </P> 
	 <P>There IS a word that sounds very much like "treacle", but I think, it
		can be assigned unequivocally only by someone with sound/computer-equipment.
		</P> 
	 <P>Best wishes </P>

	 <P>Hi all. </P> 
	 <P>Just my brief comments on whether KT sings 'Treacle' at the end of YTO.
		</P> 
	 <P>A few nights ago we had a small gathering, seven of us, and it was
		agreed by all that she does infact sing 'Treacle'. </P> 
	 <P>Maybe word from 'official' sources would help...Any takers? </P> 
	 <P>Cheers! </P>

		&lt;bretthar@nswbeta.nsw.BoM.GOV.AU&gt; <BR> Subject: More treacle... </P> 
	 <P>Hi KateFans, </P> 
	 <P>It seems everyone else is having a go at this one so I may as well give
		it a try. After listening closely to YTO, I tend to agree with Wieland Willker.
		</P> 
	 <P>The clue here is to realise that the preceeding "Sugar, Honey, Sugar"
		bits are actually made up of two voices, one high and one lower, presumably
		both of them Kate. Then there is the WHAAAAGA bit, which IMHO may be made out
		to be "WHaaaat are you doing???" (perhaps this just reflects my particular
		neuroses), and a little later, if you keep in mind the lower voice in the S, H,
		S part earlier, there is a word which sounds like Treacle in just the lower
		voice. </P> 
	 <P>But what the hell, anything which gets you to listen to YTO over and
		over again can't be bad. </P>
