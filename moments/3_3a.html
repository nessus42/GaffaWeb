Kate's film at the London Film Festival </P>
<P>I just received the programme booklet for the 37th London Film Festival.
Kate's  new film &quot;The Line, The Cross and The Curve&quot; will be shown at
the Odeon West  End 2 on Saturday 13th November at 17.15. The film is written
and directed by Kate  and stars Miranda Richardson, Lindsay Kemp and Kate. The
film is 52 minutes long.  This may explain the delay in the album and Kate's
concern to finish the film as she  may be very keen to ensure that the film is
ready for the festival. </P>
<P>I have attended several films at the London Film Festival in the past and it
is very  common for the director of a film to make a personal appearance at the
theatre and  introduce the film and sometimes to answer questions afterwards. I
would think  there is a good chance Kate may turn up. </P>
<P>Here is the synopsis of the film from the programme booklet: </P>
<P>We are delighted to welcome acclaimed singer-songwriter Kate Bush to the 
world of images with this, her directorial debut. Although the inspirational
source is  the music contained in her new album, her visual energy, flair and
use of colours is  simply great. The story revolves around two dancers (Bush and
Stewart Arnold)  rehearsing for a show in a hot, humid room during a storm. When
lightening strikes  and cuts the power, Kate is left alone when suddenly a
mysterious woman (Miranda  Richardson) with bandaged hands and red ballet shoes
enters through the mirror.  She tricks Kate into drawing three symbols, a line,
a cross and a curve, and handing  over her soul in return for the red shoes,
which take her through the doorway in the  mirror. A guide appears (Lindsay
Kemp), explaining that the only way break the  spell is to sing back the
symbols. </P>
<P>The film will be showing with a &quot;claymation&quot; UK film &quot;The
Wrong Trousers&quot;  directed by Nick Park. </P>
<P>Ticket prices are 6-95 (pounds). Annual members of the British Film
Institute  may book tickets by post from 18th October: both members and the
general public  may book from 29th October by mail, in person or over the
telephone. </P>
<P>BFI members using the priority booking will be limited to two tickets. After
the  29th unlimited tickets may be purchased. You can join the BFI and become a 
member of the National Film Theatre for 11-95. (ring 071-815-1374 for details).
Ticket  bookings can be made at The Box Office, National Film Theatre, South
Bank,  London, SE1 8XT. Tel. 071-928-3232 </P>

<P>From nbc@inf.rl.ac.uk Sat Nov 13 19:43:44 1993 <BR> Date: Sun, 14 Nov 93
00:25:31 GMT <BR> Subject: TLTCTC at the Odeon Leicester Square </P>
<P>I have just got back from the premiere of Kate's film The Line, The Cross
and  The Curve at the Odeon Leicester Square as part of the London Film
Festival. Kate  was there (along with Miranda Richardson) just sitting in the
middle of the cinema -  although I was quite close to her - I was to the side so
I am not sure who was with  her. Before Kate's film was a short claymation film
by Nick Park called The Wrong  Trousers. This was very inventive and very funny
and received a great ovation from  the crowd. </P>
<P>After Nick had said a few words to the audience, Kate was invited up to the 
front just before the start of her film and said a few words to introduce the
film.  She thanked all the people who had helped her, said she was a bit nervous
as it was  her first film, and said that the previous film was a hard act to
follow. </P>
<P>After a standing ovation at the end of the film she was ushered through the 
crowd by the cinema staff without saying anything else. </P>
<P>The film was highly enjoyable though from a cinematic point of view it is
unlikely  to win any oscars. Having said that, it was definitely more than just
a few pop videos  slung together. Miranda Richardson and Lindsay Kemp were
excellent but I have to  admit that Kate does not really succeed as an actress.
Her singing and dancing in the  film were excellent and even her voice over bits
were fine, but speaking to camera  she shows her inexperience at acting. </P>
<P>The film begins with Kate and the dancer Stewart Arnold rehearsing in a
studio  while the band plays Rubberband Girl. At the end of the song there is a
power cut  and as the others leave Kate lights a candle and sings And So is Love
catching a bird  that has flown into the studio. At the end of the song a
mysterious woman appears  throught the large mirror at the end of the studio.
Her hands are bandaged and on  her feet are a pair of red shoes. The woman begs
Kate's help in returning to the  other side. Because of her bandaged hands she
asks Kate to draw three symbols - a  line, a cross and a curve. Doing this, Kate
unwittingly hands over her soul and the  woman then offers Kate the red shoes. 
</P>
<P>Once the shoes are on Kate's feet she begins dancing and The Red Shoes is 
played with Richardson miming to the song. As the woman passes through the 
mirror, the red shoes take Kate there as well. At the end of the song the shoes 
continue to dance and Kate begs for help. A guide (Kemp) comes to her and as
Kate  pleads for him to cut off the shoes he tells her that the only way to
break the spell is  to sing back the symbols. Kate is taken to see the healer
Lily (herself) who tells her  what she must do as the song Lily begins. At the
end of the song Lily tells Kate that  she can get help from ones she has loved.
Kate sings Moments of Pleasure and we  see figures representing people in the
song float past her.</P>
<P>The woman (Richardson) reappears and tells Kate that she will never break
the  spell. But Kate senses that the woman is afraid of her and trys to get back
the pieces  of paper that the woman still has. Kate chases the woman and they
pass through a  room where the floor is covered in fruit. Eat the Music plays as
a group of carribean  women appear carrying the symbols. At the end of the song
Richardson is hurled  into the mirror which breaks and initially water pours
through but then fires start.  The guide urges Kate to pass back before it is
too late. Kate passes back to her side  as the power is restored in the studio.
</P>
<P>The film contained many brilliant visual moments though there were a few old
 chestnuts like the wave effects produced with a wind machine and billowing 
material. I particularly like the fruit in Eat the Music, many of the scenes on
the  &quot;other side&quot; were very effective. The Moments of Pleasure scene
was initally very  reminiscent of Don't Give Up without Gabriel with just Kate
spinning round but  developed more towards the end. The film made good use of
colour imagery  (including white for Lily's scene) and did not go over the top
with special effects. </P>
<P>There were a couple of occassions when the audience laughed when I suspect 
Kate did not have that intention. In particular, the scene where the shoes start
 thrashing Kate's legs about in all directions caused a few titters. This was
because it  was Kate's top half sticking out of the floor and someone else's
bottom half sticking  up through the floor waving their legs about frantically
(either that or Kate is a  contortionist!). Most of the time though I thought
Kate did a very good job of  directing. </P>
<P>For me the combination of the music and the visuals was a tremendous 
experience and hearing the music in this way certainly emphasised what a truely 
great album The Red Shoes is. Every song came over tremendously powerfully. And 
that includes Eat the Music which is fantastic. Buy the video when it comes out.
</P>
<P>It will be interesting to see what other people thought - I looked out for
anyone I  might recognise from the last convention but did not spot anyone
though I am sure  the Homeground crew must have been there somewhere. </P>
<P>Neil </P>
<P>P.S. Kate looked great </P>
<P>P.P.S. She really is! </P>

<P>Hello Friends, We've seen it! </P>
<P>With what seemed like hundreds of other Kate fans we attended the  premiere
of &quot;The Line the Cross, and the Curve&quot; at the Odeon West End  in
London's Leicester Square last night. </P>
<P>Kate was there with Dr Bush and Del. Before the film she went on stage to 
rapturous applause to say a few words. </P>
<P>The film is an awesome emotional experience. I was in tears for the last
part of  the &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; sequence, and held in awe when Kate
danced in the  circle formed by the four archangels in &quot;Lily&quot;. </P>
<P>I'm not up to a proper review yet. Miranda Richardson was superb, and so was
 Lindsay Kemp. </P>
<P>At the end the cinema rose in a standing ovation for Kate, who was overcome 
with tears. </P>
<P>A wonderful, wonderful, occasion! </P>

Dec 93 12:38:52 GMT <BR> Subject: Q Magazine KaTe Film </P>
<P>Below is a brief write up of KaTe's The Line, The Cross and The Curve that I
 discovered in the stories pages of Q Magazine. </P>
<P>-----------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>There was a high-profile London Film Festival premiere for the film Kate
Bush  made during the autumn as more or less an afterthought to the three-year
process  of her Red Shoes album. Shy Kate went so far as to get up on stage
before the  screening to thank &quot;everyone who'd been a part of making the
film&quot; and to speak  of her trepidation because her opus was following a
brilliant animation by Aardman,  the makers of the Creature Comforts ads. She
was proably right to be worried as  The Line, The Cross and The Curve turned out
to be not so much a movie as the  sort of linked sequence of promo vids that pop
stars are wont to hang themselves  with, given a feature-length rope. The plot
involves devils, angels, hellfire and those  bewitched red shoes. While the
metaphor may well refer to the fiendishly obsessive  nature of artistic
creativity (if you're as driven as Kate Bush, that is), the effect  suggests a
peculiarly daft corner of the '70s - Black Sabbath's preposterous devilry 
meeting Jon Anderson in whimsically mystic Olias of Sunhillow mode.  
</P>
<P>Still, if it's not exactly Saturday night at the movies, if the viewer
approaches it as opera or  ballet - sod the plot and soak in the sound and
vision - it's more lively. The six songs  come across at stunning big-concert
power and Kate dances with a wild passion  which will make devotees ache for her
to take to the boards again. On the other  hand, the buffeting she took from a
combination of hyperfans and paparazzi while  leaving the Odeon West End could
put her off a further re-emergence from the  Bush compound for some time to
come. </P>
<P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>The story review also appears with a picture of Kate alongside someone
called  Rosa Bosch (forgive my ignorance but I don't know who Rosa Bosch is).

<P>&gt;Below is a brief write up of KaTe's The Line, The Cross and The Curve
that I  discovered in the stories pages of Q Magazine. </P>
<P>&gt;The story.review also appears with a picture of Kate alongside someone
called  Rosa Bosch (forgive my ignorance but I don't know who Rosa Bosch is).
</P>
<P>I think she was just one of the organisers from the festival committee. In
fact she  did not handle the whole affair very well. Before the first film she
said its director  would come up at the end, then they would show Kate's film
and then she would  come up and speak about it. What actually happened was that
she called kate up  before TLTC&amp;TC was shown. Then after the film everyone
was a bit confused as to  whether Kate would say anything else. When no one
appeared at the front to invite  her up people did not know whether to wait or
leave. In the end Kate and her group  started to go, were surrounded by people
and it all became a bit chaotic. At the NFT  it is normal for the directors to
come up after the film and answer questions and  then they are sheparded out
through side doors. At the Odeon none of this was possible, </P>

13:41:27 -0500 <BR> Subject: Variety review of Line, Cross, Curve... (Dec.
1993) </P>
<P>From the 12/6 Weekly Variety (reprinted without permission) </P>
<P>Shy retiring British pop diva Kate Bush, 35, steps behind the lens with
mixed  artistic results in &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve&quot;, a
music promo flick high on  whimsy and low on content. Cinematic values (and
demo-quality Dolby digital sound)  make this a solid bet for special events,
however, with eight numbers sure to please  Bush afficionados. </P>
<P>Written and directed by Bush herself to promote her new album, &quot;The Red
 Shoes,&quot; the epic (played at ear-splitting volume) got a warm welcome at
its SRO  London Festival screening at a large downtown theater. It goes out on
UK homevideo  later this year. Story is a snappy variation on the 1948 Michael
Powell-Emeric  Pressburger classic &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, with Bush as a
dancer who's given a pair of  red ballet shoes that won't stop dancing by a
mysterious woman (Miranda  Richardson) in exchange for three magical symbols
(pic's title). </P>
<P>Richardson, reprising her &quot;Crying Game&quot; Irish accent, steals the
acting stakes as a  kind of wicked witch. When not warbling, Bush is colorless.
Mime artist Lindsay  Kemp, under whom Bush studied, is reliable. Pic's visual
style is relatively  conservative, far from the usual musicvid fare. Aspect
ratio is also a conservative 1.33.  Derek Elley. </P>

<P>CFNY has been giving out one &quot;double pass&quot; to see &quot;The
Curve...&quot; every hour.  You have to be the 5th caller to get thru when they
play the &quot;Free Ticket Wicket&quot;  jingle. I've called about, oh, 300
times or so today (thank goodness for speed dialing  software) but all I got
were busy signals. They said on the air that their phone is  melting from all
the calls begging for passes, but they make absolutely no exceptions  -you have
to get thru when the &quot;Free Ticket&quot; thing is happening. Even EMI does
not  have any passes (so they say). Oh well. 5 more days to try. (Are there any
secrets to  getting thru these call-ins?) </P>
<P>JUST ANNOUNCED: after the screening, KaTe will be shuttled to the CFNY 
radio station, where they will be conducting a live interview BROADCAST 
WORLDWIDE BY SATELLITE, AND TAKING FANS' QUESTIONS. Listeners are  invited to
drop by and oggle thru the window. They'd better get some cops there to  control
the mob! This will happen on Monday night at 11 p.m. (Toronto is in the same 
time zone as NYC). I don't know which line they'll use for the phone-in, but the
 &quot;contest&quot; line is (416)-870-3343. More details as they're
announced... </P>

<P>Tippi and I got in to see Kate and The Line, The Cross and the Curve!!!! I
still  can't believe it.....a week of phoning in to that contest only to hear
the &quot;BEEP  BEEP BEEP&quot; endlessly..... </P>
<P>We decided to scope out CFNY (for the interview) and the Royal Ontario 
Museum for scalpers (the going rate was $100 according to the radio)....but no
luck.  We waited at the ROM's entrance until it was 8pm.....watching many
smiling ticket  winners go in.....and then there were just seven of us
non-ticket holder s left. One  of us went in and started to plead her case and
when we all joined her inside, she  said &quot;Look...there are only seven of
us...surely there must be enough room...or even  standing room?&quot; After
several nervous moments, the hostess said &quot;I'll see what I can  do&quot;.....A
few minutes later, she came back an d said &quot;Ok....come with me....but  you
may not find seats together.&quot; </P>
<P>As soon as we were seated...3 minutes literally.....Kate was introduced and 
everyone greeted her with applause, a standing ovation...and a few &quot;We Love
You!&quot;  lines. She walked right by the aisle seats we were in....not more
than 5 feet away!!!  She introduced the film and returned to her seat at the
back row. The film was  GREAT.....but I won't go into that because others
already have. Anyway...  afterward...we went back to CFNY only to find the place
(the windows) covered  up!! We gave X-mas cards to the CFNY people for Kate and
then left so we could be  back to tape this interview..... </P>
<P>Wow....what a rollercoaster evening....!!! Thanks to Tippi for being the
optimist. </P>

<P>YIIIIIPEEEEE! </P>
<P>Les has already made a synopsis of this wonderdul KaTe evening we had. I'll
just  add some bits that Les left out. The last 2 rows of the theatre were
reserve for KaTe,  and we found seats near the middle. As soon as we set down,
the head of  EMI-Canada welcomed the fans (and got applauded) and he introduced
KaTe. As  she walked down the aisle (I was just 1 seat away from the aisle!) the
fans cheered,  whistled, screamed etc. and gave a standing ovation! Then KaTe
welcomed us to her  film, and said this is one of the very few showings it has
had, and hope that we  would enjoy it. Then she walked back up the aisle, to
thunderous applause again.  The film started - and the magic began! Since it was
described here before, I won't  repeat anything here, except that each song
segment can stand on itself as a music  video and yet is a part of a cohesive
whole - wonderful! The most moving scene is  the end of MoP, but the segment I
liked most is Lily. </P>
<P>Les observed that after the film KaTe left when the credits were rolling
-the  only entrance/exit is at the back so she did it unhindered. </P>
<P>&quot;It's really happening to ya!&quot; </P>

<P>Here's the interview from the Toronto Sun. </P>
<P>Kate Bush weaves a fairy tale </P>
<P>by John Sakamoto </P>
<P>The best fairy tales rarely conform to the &quot;once upon a time/happily
ever after&quot;  format. </P>
<P>Take Hans Christian Andersen's 19th-century &quot;bedtime&quot; story, The
Red Shoes .  A young girl receives a pair of magical shoes that transform her
into a magnificent  dancer. Unfortunately, they won't let her *stop* dancing.
They literally become a  part of her body, resisting all attempts at being
removed. Eventually, the girl  becomes so desperate, she has her feet chopped
off. Then she dies. The end. </P>
<P>Which brings us to the new Kate Bush album, also titled The Red Shoes. The 
initial attraction to the charming story above, Bush is telling a handful of
reporters  during a rare in-person interview yesterday, &quot;was the image of
dance, because it is  something I've really enjoyed being involved in. But it's
an image you can take to  almost any form of art, the idea of being possessed by
one's art. Sometimes *it*  controls you rather than *you* controlling it.&quot;
</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>&quot;The short film&quot; is The Line, The Cross and the Curve, Bush's
directorial debut,  which received an invite-only screening last night at the
Royal Ontario Museum, its  first showing outside of the London Film Festival
last month. (It will likely be  released as a home video in the new year.) </P>
<P>Incorporating a series of videos for The Red Shoe , the 50-minute, $ 1
million  production features Miranda Richardson and mime artist Lindsey Kemp.
Bush sums  up the plot this way. &quot;it's the idea of working in a rehearsal
room with a band, and  suddenly this woman appears in the room and tricks me out
of my soul, which is  represented by three symbols, and puts me under a spell
which involves the red  shows. And for the rest of the film, I have to try to
win back my soul. </P>
<P>&quot;It is,&quot; she smiles sweetly, &quot;kind of a fairy tale.&quot;

<P>MP: So tell us about your film, The Line, The Cross and The Curve. Does it
tie in  fairly closely to the original story, The Red Shoes. </P>
<P>KB: Not really to the original story. I suppose it does hop back to the
fairy story  more. But it's more the idea of working in a rehearsal studio with
a band and  suddenly this woman appears in the room and she tricks me out of my
soul but  she is represented by three symbols, and puts me under a spell which
involves  the Red Shoes. For the rest of the film, I have to try to win back my
Soul. So  it's kind of like a fairy tale that was adapted from the original one
but which  sort of turned into a modern fairy tale. I guess. </P>

<P>A short article from NOW, &quot;Toronto's weekly news and entertainment 
newspaper&quot;. </P>
<P>NOW magazine, December 16, 1993 </P>
<P>Bush on film </P>
<P>Evidently, British pop siren Kate Bush has a soft spot for Canada. Though
she  hates to fly, she made Toronto the only North American stop besides New
York on a  promo tour for her newest record, The Red Shoes , and the premiere of
her  directorial debut film, The Line, The Cross and The Curve. </P>
<P>The 50-minute short loosely links six songs from the album with the Red
Shoes  fairy tale of a dancer whose ballet slippers refuse to stop dancing. The
film is a far  cry from Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1948 classic. In
essence, it's a  long form video, and Bush is the first person to agree this
isn't the film she really  wanted to make. But since EMI is willing to pay for
it, why not answer when  opporunity knocks? </P>
<P>&quot;In a way, it was very restrictive because it's not my conceptual piece
from  scratch. Also, I'm working around the songs and I had to put myself into
the film. I  would've preferred to cast myself in a smaller role. </P>
<P>&quot;It wasn't the ideal situation because it was very rushed and we had
little money.  But it was an intense project. And I'm very glad I went through
it, even if the film  is not received well, because I learned so much.&quot;

<P>Hi everyone, </P>
<P>It was so nice. And, as paranoid as I was while sitting there in Friday
afternoon  rush hour traffic going to Berkeley, they didn't even sell out half
of the available  seats in the theatre-there was plenty of room left for many
more. The only  promotional evidence was a copy of the TRS cover poster that an
employee pinned  up in the preview area about 7:30 PM to go with the small b/w
promo pic of Kate  that they had put there earlier. However, the showing was
part of a Women's Film  Festival, and the little booklet on the festival has a
paragraph describing the film, and  a nice little b/w picture from the film
showing Kate and Miranda Richardson. </P>
<P>I got there about 6:40 and only Karen and a young guy were waiting outside
the  theatre-Charlie(?) had been there since 4:30. A little while later Steve0
arrived, and  us three Hounds went for pizza across the street. They weren't to
sell tickets until  8:30, unless you wanted to buy a booklet of 5 or so. I found
out later that some  people had managed to get tickets earlier in the day. I
guess it mattered who and  how you asked... </P>
<P>Later, Bill Wisner and friend arrived, and Dave Koehler, but it wasn't until
 around 8pm that people started arriving and forming two lines-those with tix
and  those without-we were in the &quot;with&quot; line... :-) Finally, at about
9:10, they let us in!  We took over an entire center row, about a third of the
way up, and sat there  smiling at each other. Kate's movie was the first to be
shown. I'll let Karen do the  description of the film-I was too busy savoring
the experience. But a few of my  thoughts anyway: </P>
<P>Kate was acting her heart out! It appears the various videos that have been 
released so far (RG, EtM, ASiL) are all taken from the content of the film
(based on  the posting of ASiL that someone had sent late Thursday/ Friday).
Watching the  film made me think of being able to see the &quot;whole story,&quot;
if you will. The film  starts out in a practice session for RG, and is
prettymuch as the &quot;original&quot; video for  the song was described, with
the band standing around, joining in, Kate dancing in  the straigtjacket.
Awesome. Then the band takes a break after they lose electricity.  Kate does the
ASiL portion by candlelight. Ooooohh, my heart rate... :-) </P>
<P>Lindsey Kemp was *excellent* in his role. It is so WONDERFUL that Kate asked
 him to be in this-he seemed to relish the opportunity. Miranda Richardson was 
GREAT. What a performance. As much as I appreciate the work Kate did in the 
film, Miranda's devilishly wicked role as the scheming diva was two thumbs up! I
 almost died laughing at the part where Miranda has Kate on the ground, choking 
her, with Lindsey yelling &quot;run! run!&quot; Kate lets out a weak &quot;I-I
can't.&quot; Lindsey  continues to yell &quot;run!&quot; Miranda then gives him
that wicked look, and sneers, &quot;She  can't!&quot; </P>
<P>Kate's acting was very very good, though not as polished as Richardson's. I
can  sort of see how that one critic thought she &quot;looked&quot; a little &quot;wooden&quot;
at times (I  don't think the critic actually used that word, though). But
especially after she was  fooled into accepting the red shoes-once she couldn't
stop dancing, there were many  reminders for me of her performances during the
Tour. She crossed effortlessly  between heart-wrenching pain (ASiL, Lily) and
crazy-eyed frenzy (TRS), and  seemed to get stronger as the film went on. I saw
the Hitchcock influence here and  there. I was *very* pleased that Kate is
featured prominently in the film. She still  looks as great as ever. Seasoned,
maybe a little weary from it all, but still so graceful,  so noble, so natural.
 </P>
<P>At the end, the audience applauded and yelled loudly as the credits rolled
by, and  we all screamed for a repeat, but such was not to occur. They launched
right into  the other movie without so much as letting me come back to earth
first-I think that  was the most uncomfortable part of the whole evening. No
afterplay, if you know  what I mean. :-) </P>
<P>I had trouble concentrating on the other film, which was about two women who
 smoke too much trying to find love, or something like that. The cover of The 
Dreaming album got a quick cameo appearance during the second film, but had 
nothing to do with the content of that film. I managed to sit through it, hoping
that  they'd show TLTCTC again, but they didn't... :-) </P>
<P>We all met again outside the theatre in the drizzle and smiled at each other
for a  little while before disappearing into the cool night. It was a great
evening. </P>

<P>Hello, </P>
<P>It was wonderful! Larry really captured the mood in his summary post. It was
 good to see the Katemas regulars again -- Larry, Karen, Steve0, Bill. No IED,
he was  in New York. I also met numerous other charming and devoted fans whose
names I  cannot remember. Moments before the film the excitement in the theatre
was  dizzying. Sure it was only half full, but most of the people there seemed
to be pretty  psyched. Highlights for me were ASiL (a reference to the quote in
my .sig maybe?),  MoP (beautiful!) and EtM (delerious!). I don't care much for
the song, but the EtM  section was the highlight for me. I thought Kate's acting
was a little stiff, but pretty  good overall. Miranda Richardson was &quot;over-the-top&quot;,
kind of like Jack Nicholson's  Joker, but not quite as good as Nicholson.
Lindsay Kemp was simply perfect in his role. </P>

<BR> Subject: Celluloid Heroes </P>
<P>Here's my view of The Line, The Cross, &amp; The Curve: </P>
<P>I got to Berkeley a little past 7:00, and the only ones there were: Chad,
who for  the last couple of days we have been sending an increasingly frantic
Emails back and  forth. (&quot;Tickets go on sale at 2:30&quot;. &quot;Great!
Can you pick me up one?&quot; &quot;No, wait, they  go on sale at 8:30.&quot; &quot;I'll
be in Berkeley by then!&quot; &quot;No, wait, they go on sale a half  hour AFTER
the film starts!&quot; &quot;Auuugh!&quot;), Karen, who brought this all to our 
attention in the first place and will be holding another Katemas this year and
Larry,  who already told you his adventures. </P>
<P>Larry, Karen, &amp; I went across the street for a nutrious, healthy meal of
 meat-laden pizza and beer (the pizza was meat-laden, not the beer). Chad
bravely  stood in line (although a queue of one person hardly classifies as &quot;a
line&quot;) for us.  Actually, he should get a medal for KateFanDom above and
beyond the call of duty  for waiting there since 4:00, and then get locked in a
room where they keep John  Hinckley and that woman who always breaks into David
Letterman's house. </P>
<P>By 8:00 a respectable line actually did form, and we were greeted by Bill,
our  humble pseudo-moderator. A handful of fellow lovehounds introduced
themselves,  and I forgot all of your names so I'm sorry... </P>
<P>**WARNING** PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD </P>
<P>(Although that's carrying it to extremes, for that implies there was an
actual plot) </P>
<P>Well, the film started. First, a video for &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; which
was actually  kinda, well, dull. Singer/band/singer/band. Also Kate looked like
she was trying to  stay awake while singing (only later did you discover that
this was part of what plot  there was). </P>
<P>Then some silly stuff happened that gave it all a very &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot;
feel, and  then she launched into a video for &quot;And so is Love&quot;. This
one rather disturbed me,  'cause a bird was killed in it. First she wears a dead
bird on her head, then she has  one killed for a video. Rumor has it that she
even eats chicken nowadays. I am NOT  inviting her to MY place, 'cause God knows
what she'll do to our pet African Grey. </P>
<P>Then, in a very Lewis Carollish fashion, Miranda Richardson (sporting a
funky  costume by Hazel Perthig (sp?), the same costumer for Monty Python, and a
set of  wonderful Frida Kahlo eyebrows that were just to die for) bursts through
a mirror  for the first bit of real dialog. Then they launch into &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot;; It would not  surprise anyone (with the possible exception of IED)
that M.R. is a better actress  than K.B. What DID surprise me was she was doing
a MUCH better job lip synching  to Kate's music than Kate herself was. </P>
<P>Lindsey Kemp showed up, looking like a slightly cuter and slightly scarier
version  of the Joel Grey character from &quot;Cabaret&quot;. Lily, played by
Lily (!) then appears, and  they launch into (you guessed it) &quot;Lily&quot;.
(If you think I'm skimping on the plot here,  I'm just omitting surrealistic
dream-like images. The &quot;Plot&quot; is that Kate has the  shoes M.R. had,
and L.K. is acting like a guide in the Looking-glass world to help  Kate get
back to the real world. She can only do this by giving the shoes back to  M.R.,
who refuses them, so Kate has to do it by Magic. That's it. That's the entire
plot.) </P>
<P>Anyway, the &quot;Lily&quot; number has the four archangles, Gabriel holding
up, of  course, Lilies, Raphael holding a staff (or possibly a spear, I couldn't
tell), Michael  holding a sword, and Uriel holding a bowling ball. Someone else
can figure out the  symbolism of these. </P>
<P>We then jump into a video for &quot;Eat the Music&quot;, which showed Kate
chasing M.R.  through a hall of fruit, and dancing on them. Walking on banana
peels is hard  enough - how did they run &amp; dance on them? </P>
<P>After more surreal images, a number for &quot;Moment of Pleasure&quot;
starts. In the  &quot;Hills of Time&quot; part, you can see the various people
she mentions floating by. I  wondered if the actual people looked anything like
that. </P>
<P>Finally, more surreal images flash before us, M.R. gets the Red Shoes back,
Kate  escapes back to the Real World, but M.R. performs one last piece of Magic,
and lastly  we see a pair of legs poking up from a pile of rubble -are they
Miranda  Richardson's, or are they Kate's? </P>
<P>The End. </P>
<P>The credits are worth mentioning - naturally, the entire Bush clan was
involved  (including Paddy as a dancing devil in the &quot;Red Shoes&quot;
number). The audience must  not have been entirely Lovehounds, 'cause a HUGE
cheer came up when Del  Palmer's name appeared. Also, keep a look out for other
names you will recognize  (such as the cameraman, Terry Gilliam). I forgot to
check who the Gaffer was, so I  could write to Kate to ask if they were... oh,
nevermind. </P>
<P>Following TLTC&amp;TC was a German short film (who's name I forgot but it 
wouldn't matter anyway 'cause only Uli would understand it). It was a rather
funny  woman's slice-of-life comedy (of the basic &quot;Men- can't live with
'em, can't shoot  'em&quot; variety) - well, what did you exspect at a Women's
Film Festival? Anyway, as  was mentioned, during one brief scene a stack of
albums is panned by, with a copy  of The Dreaming on top. What wasn't mentioned
was that a HUGE CHEER  erupted from the audience when this happened. </P>
<P>All in all, I give &quot;The Line, The Cross, &amp; The Curve&quot; a big
thumbs up -best  soundtrack I ever heard in any film, and I *LIKE* surreal
images! </P>
<P>- Stev0 the Critic (Wednesday night, ABC) </P>

personally </P>

<P>I'm working on a transcription of the dialogue and a good description of the
 action. Some fun things going on here -- like the blackbird in ASIL -- which
later  appears as part of her hairpiece when she goes through the mirror. &quot;Help
this  blackbird . . . there's some hair around my leg!&quot; </P>
<P>There is also the mysterious sheet music which appears on screen at several 
points while Kate is still in the studio -- when we eventually get a videotape
of this,  one of you musician folk can tell us what song it is -- or is it a
song she never used?  Is it a Prince song? </P>
<P>Kate's sense of humor is healthy and very evident in this movie . . . it is
a giant  FAN that rumbles into the studio and disrupts the RBG practice session
that  precipitates the action. What's she trying to tell us? </P>
<P>More to follow -- be patient, I can't sit at the computer for more than a
few  minutes right now. Lift with your legs! </P>
<P>P.S. Movie ran to 44 mins. I thought it was 55 mins? Where is the extra ten 
minutes? How many songs did you folks in London see in the film? We had RBG, 
ASIL, TRS, LILY, MOP, ETM. </P>

<P>I also got to the UC Theatre a bit past 7:00 and found that the tickets went
on sale  at 8:30. Two people were in line (Karen and either Chad or Larry). I am
sorry now  that I did not ask them if they were &quot;lovehounds.&quot; A signal
(some form of common  clothing or such) might be helpful to identify fellow
lovehounds. I myself clipped my  KB Staff backstage pass to my sweatshirt. </P>
<P>My two compadres (not Kate fans, but I'm trying) and I sat down not knowing 
what to expect. What it turned out to be was a series of KB videos (yes!)
loosely  held together by a fairy tale frame story (ugh). </P>
<P>steve.b@TQS.COM (Steve Berlin) writes: </P>
<P>&gt;...a video for &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; which was actually kinda,
well, dull. </P>
<P>I'm afraid I agree with Steve on this one. Staged performance videos never
turn  me on. The band seemed lost (lip-sync and gyrate ad nauseam). Loved the 
music..loved the chanteuse... </P>
<P>&gt; Also Kate looked like she was trying to stay awake while singing </P>
<P>Yes, I noticed. Was she wearing dark glasses during the song? </P>
<P>&gt; (only later did you discover that this was part of what plot there
was). </P>
<P>This was part of the &quot;plot?&quot; Please enlighten me (I can be rather
dense when it  comes to symbolism and the small details - HMMMM...great name for
a music group). </P>
<P>&gt; ..and then she launched into a video for &quot;And so is Love&quot;.
This one rather  disturbed me, 'cause a bird was killed in it. </P>
<P>I wasn't disturbed about that, because the bird wasn't KILLED, it just DIED.
I  DID find it disturbing that Kate KISSED the dead bird. If it was HER bird, or
if she  had spent some significant time and effort trying to save the bird from
its fate, I  might believe that she had enough feeling for the bird to kiss it
goodbye. As it was,  she caught the bird, held it for a while, and then let it
fly in the room before it  crashed about and died. If she was worried about its
safety, why didn't she take it to  an open door or window and let it fly
outside? I know....I'm rambling. I MUST  have missed the symbolism. </P>
<P>&gt; [Miranda Richardson] bursts through a mirror for the first bit of real
dialog. </P>
<P>IMHO, the movie would have benefited from a bit more dialog (a lot more?) to
 flesh out the plot and enhance the story. </P>
<P>&gt; ....M.R. is a better actress than K.B. What DID surprise me was she was
doing a  MUCH better job lip synching to Kate's music than Kate herself was.
</P>
<P>Considering she's not an actress by trade, I thought Kate held her own
pretty  well. Without many lines to deliver though, the acting might have been
difficult for  ALL involved. </P>
<P>&gt; [Kate] can only do this [get back to the real world] by giving the
shoes back to  M.R., who refuses them, so Kate has to do it by Magic. That's it.
That's the entire plot. </P>
<P>IMHO, it seems that Miranda Richardson's character must have WANTED to get 
the red shoes back, or else she would not have shown up again with the means for
 Kate to give them back (TL, TC, and TC). The alternative is that M.R. was
vindictive  enough to risk getting the shoes back just to taunt our poor Kate.
</P>
<P>&gt; ...and Uriel holding a bowling ball. Someone else can figure out the
symbolism of these. </P>
<P>Symbolism? Not I. </P>
<P>&gt; We then jump into a video for &quot;Eat the Music&quot;, </P>
<P>I enjoyed the ETM segment...lots of energy and color, (let's meet our next 
contestant Brand, who is a geologist, a musician, and is facinated by bright
shiny  objects). :^) This is the first time I've REALLY appreciated/enjoyed this
song. I  STILL think the song is too repetative (give us more than three
chords...PLEASE!)  but it really worked well in the TLTCTC chase sequence. </P>
<P>&gt; Finally, more surreal images flash before us, M.R. gets the Red Shoes
back,  Kate escapes back to the Real World, but M.R. performs one last piece of
Magic, and  lastly we see a pair of legs poking up from a pile of rubble - are
they Miranda  Richardson's, or are they Kate's? </P>
<P>M.R. performs one last piece of magic? I missed it (or just can't remember
it). I  think the legs obviously belonged to.... &lt;&lt;OOPS!&gt;&gt; I don't
want to spoil it for those  who haven't seen. </P>
<P>&gt; The credits are worth mentioning - naturally, the entire Bush clan was
involved  (including Paddy as a dancing devil in the &quot;Red Shoes&quot;
number). </P>
<P>Did anyone else think that the devils looked like Jon Lovitz from S.N.L.?
</P>
<P>&gt; All in all, I give &quot;The Line, The Cross, &amp; The Curve&quot; a
big thumbs up... </P>
<P>I enjoyed getting to see the videos to TRS and would go see TLTCTC again,
but  the film, as movies go, was not great. I must need to see it again to fully
comprehend  its greatness. I did, however, see its Kateness (truly awesome).
</P>
<P>&gt; ...best soundtrack I ever heard in any film... </P>
<P>With the possible exception of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, I quite
agree. The Wall -  proof that you can make a great movie sans dialog (okay, the
MUSIC supplied the  dialog). BTW, the U.C. Theatre had a fairly decent sound
system (its no THX, but..). </P>

<BR> Subject: Re: The Dead Bird </P>
<P>To perhaps increase information, in the &quot;video&quot; for ASiL there
isn't a single shot  where a moving bird becomes lifeless. A bird does hit a
dingy window and flutters  downward, off camera. This seems to be the main shot
where a bird could have been  injured. The camera was fixed on a couple panes of
a huge, wall-sized window, like  of a studio, and the bird hit there. It
certainly looks real but it would seem rather  difficult to get this shot
without some sort of preparation or tricks. </P>
<P>After that there are shots of a dead bird, almost certainly a real one. It's
probably  stuffed since I doubt they would make a fake one when there are
already stuffed  ones anyway and it seems rather stiff too. A bird is never
shown actually dying or  obviously injured anyway. Hope this helps. </P>
<P>From memory I had thought there was a shot of the bird moving after hiting
the  window but I re-watched it and was wrong. (Earlier on Kate picks up and is
holding  a live bird though.) </P>

<UL COMPACT="COMPACT">
<LI>Boy, is the plot dumb. Real dumb.</LI>
<LI>Why 50 minutes? It has a better chance of being booked if its a full-

more songs  AND allow it to have a real plot. </LI>
<LI>For you folks (and you know who you are) whose favorite shot of Kate is the
infamous &quot;leotard&quot; shot - you can clearly see Kate's nipples in the &quot;Rubberband
Girl&quot; number. Watch for it.</LI>
<LI>Best number (in terms of fitting with what story there was, and
excecution): The Red Shoes.</LI>
<LI>Everyone except Kate (especially Miranda Richardson) looks like they're
have a   LOT of fun.</LI>
<LI>My favorite song on TRS is &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, but the &quot;video&quot;
in TLTC&amp;TC is,  well, rather lame. I don't know about you folks, but I am
SICK of &quot;Spinning&quot;   imagery. It's a shame, really, EXCEPT for Kate's
appearance in it, it is actually a  beautiful video.</LI>
<LI>Yeah, I definately *LIKE* &quot;Eat the Music&quot; now.</LI>
<LI>The only other Lovehound I spotted (Saturday 7:30 show): The ever-faithful
Chad.  (Karen: What was IED's impression? Did you have to pull him away from the
screen?)</LI>

Well, I  happened to be there Friday night myself, and sat with IED and Karen

and watched it alone  before joining Andy, Karen, and the ever-faithful Chad.
Chad had to leave after the  7:30 show, but assured us he would return Saturday
(which he certainly did). </P>
<P>I can safely report that IED was KapTivly attentive, and still was able to
leave the  theatre under his own power. Now Karen, she needed some help getting
away from  the theatre, so I lured her by offering her one of my Love-Hounds

<P>Date: Fri, 29 Apr 1994 12:35:24 -0700 (PDT) <BR> From: &quot;Karen L.
Newcombe&quot; &lt;kln@crl.com&gt;<BR>  Subject: TLTCTC Plot, facial expression
</P>
<P>Hey now . . . </P>
<P>having seen TLTCTC a total of three times now I can say there is definitely
a  plot, and Kate does not look bored, she does have facial expression. It is
somewhat  more subtle that one is used to seeing on film, and compared to the
exagerrated  facial expressions of Richardson's character may seem
un-expressive. </P>
<P>But on the third pass I watched carefully and I have to say that this movie
is  subtle, beautiful to watch, and I will outline the plot for you: </P>
<P>Band practicing. Main singer having a little trouble with the dance moves.
She  leans against mirror and wishes she could really dance. Rumble of ominous 
forboding. Lights go out. Band takes a break. Singer stays in studio, thinking
about  how things used to be, how she's not young anymore. She finds a bird in
the studio,  holds it for a moment, sets it free, but it smashes into a window
and falls to the  floor. She lays it on a piece of fabric, kisses it goodbye.
</P>
<P>Just then a strange woman in a theatre costume smashes through the mirror
with  a strange story about a fire, falling off the stage, running away, burning
her hands.  She needs help getting home, and the singer obliges her by drawing
three signs on  slips of paper. The dancer convinces her to take her red dancing
shoes in trade for  her help. But as the shoes go onto her feet undertheir own
power, the singer  realizes something is wrong. The dancer takes her slips of
paper, her path, her  heart and her smile, and runs back through the mirror with
them. </P>
<P>A figure appears and beckons her into the mirror. She tries to resist, but
the  shoes take her through: she bursts across in a theatre costume similar
tothe  dancers'. She and the figure of the maestro dance through hell -- she
begs him to  remove the shoes, but the shoes get angry with her and start
kicking her about the  face and shoulders. </P>
<P>The maestro takes her to Lily, a woman of power who teaches her to summon 
the guardians of the four directions - the angels - to aid her. Lily also prays
to the  One Above to lead the singer in the true path. As the singer summons the
angels  they swarm about her, guiding her to walk forward. Michael draws a line
in the  snow with his sword -- she has called her path back to her. </P>
<P>The singer then tells us how the shoes carry her through all the cities of
the  world, dancing everywhere -- and it all seems so familiar -- but she isn't
really  there. She remembers falling into the orchestra pit from the stage, but
it never  happened to her - and how these shoes are filled with rage. She
concludes she does  not have the strength to go on. </P>
<P>The Maestro appears and tells her to call upon those she loves. As the shoes
carry  her above the roofs of the cities, she remembers all those who loved her
and helped  her. One by one, as she flies into the storm of time they come
forward to greet her.  Everyone she has lost has come back to her for a moment.
</P>
<P>As she falls through the storm a great X appears in the icy ground. The
shoes  cannot keep her aloft any longer -- the memories of her loved ones has
given her  power back over her own heart. She crashes to the ground,
unconscious. </P>
<P>The Maestro calls to her through the snowstorm, but when the singer hears
him  and awakens, she can't make out his words for the roaring of the wind. A
vicious  chuckle behind her signals the presence of the dancer, who informs her
that the  Maestro is trying to tell her to sing for her smile. The two argue --
much like two  parts of the same person will argue. </P>
<P>A chase ensues: the dancer runs off with the slips of paper and taunts the
singer  to get them if she can. They run through the snow of winter, through the
fallen  leaves of autumn, into the fruits of summer -- and as they race ahead
the singer  begins to smile and gain on the dancer, whose arm grows heavier and
heavier from  holding the line, the cross, the curve that are not hers. </P>
<P>As the two burst into the full fruit of summer, dancers fill the room
holding up  replicas of the smile on the slip of paper. These dancers surround
the singer and sing  and dance for her smile. They all fall into a trance of
ecstacy and collapse -- and the  curse is broken. The singer's smile flies back
to her, pulling the heart and the path  with it. As the slips of paper curl into
her hand, the shoes vanish from her feet and  reappear on the dancer's feet.
</P>
<P>The dancer snarls and attacks the singer, while the Maestro exhorts her from
the  background to run back through the mirror while she can. If she loses this
battle  she will not be able to return. In a burst of strenth the singer throws
off the dancer  who smashes into the mirror -- water streams down it, and it
bursts into the studio  carrying fruit and the singer -- no longer in her somber
black but arrayed in the  dress of fruit and life -- reborn through the glass
wall. </P>
<P>As she turns and watches, the ceiling collapses onto the dancer, burying
her. But  the shoes rise up through the rubble, whirring and kicking . . . </P>
<P>So - a quick summary. I think when everyone gets a chance to see this film
more  we'll all see that the facial expressions are subtle, not absent; and that
a plot does  indeed tie the whole thing together -- not just provide an excuse
to slap some videos  together. </P>

Date: Sat, 30 Apr 1994 21:57:41 GMT <BR> Subject: New interview BBC 1 (April
1994) </P>
<P>And now, faster than a very fast thing, comes a transcription of the
interview  with Kate from &quot;Good Morning With Anne And Nick&quot; broadcast
in the UK on  BBC 1 on Friday 29/04/94... </P>
<P>Presented by Tania Bryer (&quot;Good Morning&quot; Showbiz Expert). </P>
<P>Nick: Let's talk Kate Bush </P>
<P>Tania: I knew you wanted to talk Kate Bush... Your a big fan.. So are a lot
of people.  We don't see enough of Kate Bush, she hasn't toured for ages but
anyway she  had an album out last year (The Red Shoes) and now she's written,
she's starring  in and directing a film based on six tracks from 'Red Shoes' and
this is her  debut directing and acting [no it isn't - Peter] and is about a 40
minute film - we  went to a special preview; let's have a look at Kate. </P>
<P>	[clip from the track 'The Red Shoes' sequence from 'The Line, The Cross And
The Curve']</P>
<P>Tania: It's 16 years since Kate Bush's first ever single, 'Wuthering
Heights' went to  No. 1. Her theatrical image has so far been confined to a few
stage shows and her  excellent videos but now she has directed a movie, 'The
Line, The Cross And The Curve'...</P>
<P>Kate: I suppose really when the album was finished I was aware that I was
going to  have to make some videos for singles that would be released and that
to make a  film that was... maybe half an hour/ 40 minutes long would be a way
of making a  more complete statement. </P>
<P>Tania: Kate's problem was that the album had no common theme so what *would*
 be the film's story? Then she realized; The shoes *were* the story. Despite 
having written lyrics for over 20 hits, Kate found writing the script very
difficult. </P>
<P>Kate: I have a very great curiosity for words; I think there *is* a word for
 everything. It's a great gift to be very eloquent but the only dialogue that
I've  ever been involved in is in this film. </P>
<P>	[clip from Mirranda's entrance in 'The Line, The Cross And The Curve'] </P>
<P>Tania: Kate was delighted when award-winning actress, Mirranda Richardson, 
agreed to play the lead role in the film. </P>
<P>Kate: There are area where there sould have been more dialogue; I would have
liked  that but we just didn't have the time to develop the story any more but
really one  of the scenes that I think I'm the most proud of int the film is
Mirranda's  entrance into the room and the dialogue that in a way sets up the
whole story. </P>
<P>	[clips from sequence for 'Moments Of Pleasure' and 'Eat The Music' from 
'The Line, The Cross And The Curve'] </P>
<P>Tania: Kate's first 40 minute short is an impressive debut as director but
if her  movie-making career takes off, her fans are likely to see *less* of her
rather than more. </P>
<P>Kate: In this particular film I took on the role as the singer and I think
in some ways  by doing that I took on a bit too much. If I was to make a film, I
wouldn't want  to be in it so much, just maybe a tiny bit. </P>
<P>End. </P>

<BR> Subject: The Line, The Cross, and the Curve </P>
<P>All in all, though, the movie is pretty good. Miranda Richardson, as always,
puts in  a remarkable performance. This movie is reminiscent of Kate's early
music career:  it is flawed, but with signs of brilliance. Kate's use of color
is fantastic. Perhaps Kate  will be a great film director some day if she wants
to be. </P>
<P>The best scene in the movie, in my opinion, is the performance of &quot;And
So Is  Love&quot;. Very simple, but effective. Kate should have released this
song as a single for  two reasons: (1) It would have made a much better single
than any of the songs that  were released as singles (&quot;Constellation Of The
Heart&quot; should have been the other  single), and (2) it is the only section
of the film that would work when cut out of the  movie and made into a video.

Date: Wed, 11 May 1994 11:54:47 GMT <BR> Subject: The Film </P>
<P>When I saw TLTCATC the first time I was quite non-plussed about the whole 
film. This Sunday was the second view and now my view has focused a bit more. I 
like the film with an exception and a half. The clip for Moments Of Pleasure
still  makes me feel nauseous. The sight of a woman spinning on a 20' screen for
4.5  minutes is enough to induce motion sickness in any one. The key problem is
that it is  the same shot throughout; It's just not visually interesting. The
same could be said of  the sequence for Eat The Music but the saving grace is
the fact that there are a  couple of cut away shots to break it up a bit and one
of the key events of the plot  occurs during the sequence (the symbols fly out
of Mirranda's hand and flutter  down the tunnel). </P>
<P>Favourite sequence: The Red Shoes. Very good. Love the choreography. The 
dialogue scene at the start is good but Mirranda far outshines Kate who delivers
her  lines rather cheesily. It's not just here either; she was a bit dodgy in
the Les Dogs  film for the Comic Strip. Acting is not her strength. Don't take
my word for it, Kate  has expressed her own reservations about the film in an
interview that I'll get  round to transcribing from video later today! </P>
<P>The main thing to remember is that it *is* her first attempt at a short film
as  opposed to a 4 minute promo clip. And as such I think that she has done very
well.  She does have a talent for directing as you can see from excellent videos
like Hounds  Of Love. But she is used to condensing vast amounts of plot into 4
minutes. When  you've got 45 minutes to fill it becomes a very different beast
indeed. </P>
<P>In some ways it would have been better for Kate to have got her courage up 
earlier to make a film when she was thinking of filming The Ninth Wave. That has
 a definite cinematic quality to it rather than the film that we have now which
has  one central relevent song and the others have been shoe-horned into the
plot as an  after-thought. The main problem with making a film for The Ninth
Wave is that the  plot requires some expensive water type location shooting. I
can visualize it all in my  head but I can also see it costing a great deal more
than the almost exclusively  studio-bound TLTCATC. </P>
<P>So to recap... I agree with Kate when she says that she should remain behind
the  camera for her next film (except for a cameo - Hitchcock style). I do like
The Line,  The Cross, And The Curve with a couple of reservations. I am looking
forward to  her next film and I do think it is an excellent avenue for her to
pursue in  conjunction with her music career. </P>
