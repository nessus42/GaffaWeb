<P>&gt; Second, someone please correct me if I'm hallucinating again, but
didn't Kate  record &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; specifically for the Marvin Gaye
tribute? Someone who was  at last year's KonvenTion please refresh my memory! 
</P>
<P>Kate's version of &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; was actually a track by Davey
Spillane (the  Uillean pipes player on several recent Kate Bush recordings -- he
appears in the  &quot;Rocket Man&quot; video), which was intended for his last
solo CD. For some reason it  was decided not to include the track, so Kate's
vocal has so far only been heard  once in public -- at the Convention. Let's
hope it finds a home soon.

<P>&gt; According to Homegroud, Kate recorded SH with Davey Spillane for his
recent  album...only for reasons unkown, it did not appear on said album.
Forgive me if I a.)  Got the wrong artist or b.) spelled his name wrong, because
I don't have my  Homegrounds w/ me. 
</P>
<P>The reason why &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; was not included on Davey
Spillane's album  was according to the man himself because it just didn't fit in
with the feel of the  rest of the tracks. (I asked DS this question when he
played in Cambridge promoting  the album.)

</P>
<P>Hmmm... I've been lurking for a while and think that I can clear up a couple
of  points about this cover track. 
</P>
<P>Kate recorded 'Sexual Healing' for an album by folk musician Davey Spillaine
to  go on his current album 'A Place Among The Stones'. She also recorded 'The
Man  I Love' for a Gershwin tribute album. Somewhere along the line someone got 
confused and this is where the rumour of Kate recording a track for a Marvin
Gaye  tribute album started. 
</P>
<P>'The Man I Love' appeared on the Larry Adler album called 'The Glory of 
Gershwin' and the 'Sexual Healing' track didn't show up on Davey's album 
(although some people have heard it because it was previewed at the KBC 
convention last year). 
</P>
<P>I spoke to Dr. Bush a few months ago and asked him about the matter. 
</P>
<P>The reason it didn't appear on 'A Place Among The Stones' is because Davey's
 management thought that it didn't fit in with the more traditional folk
material on  the album. 
</P>
<P>However, this is not to say that the track is lost. Kate holds the rights to
that  recording and I have been told that she will *definitely* release it but
probably as a  B-side.
