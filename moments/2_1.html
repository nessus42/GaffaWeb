sense than me <BR> You see I try to resist </P>
<P>    A rubberband bouncing back to life <BR>     A rubberband bend the beat
<BR>     If I could learn to give like a rubberband <BR>     I'd be back on my
feet <BR>     A rubberband hold me trousers up <BR>     A rubberband ponytails
<BR>     If I could learn to twang like a rubberband <BR>     I'd be a
rubberband girl <BR>     A rubberband girl me <BR>     A rubberband girl me
<BR>     Oh I wanna be a rubberband girl 
</P>
<P>When I slip out <BR> Of my catapult <BR> I gotta land with my feet firm on
the ground <BR> And let my body catch up <BR>
</P>
<P>    A rubberband bouncing back to life <BR>     A rubberband bend the heat<BR>
     If I could learn to give like a rubberband <BR>     I'd be back on my feet

<P>Some moments that I've had <BR> Some moments of pleasure 
</P>
<P>I think about us lying <BR> Lying on a beach somewhere <BR> I think about
us diving <BR> Diving off a rock, into another moment 
</P>
<P>The case of George the Wipe <BR> Oh God I can't stop laughing <BR> This
sense of humour of mine <BR> It isn't funny at all <BR> Oh but we sit up all
night <BR> Talking about it 
</P>
<P>    Just being alive <BR>     It can really hurt <BR>     And these
moments given <BR>     Are a gift from time 
</P>
<P>On a balcony in New York <BR> It's just started to snow <BR> He meets us
at the lift <BR> Like Douglas Fairbanks <BR> Waving his walking stick <BR>
But he isn't well at all 
</P>
<P>The buildings of New York <BR> Look just like mountains through the snow 
</P>
<P>    Just being alive <BR>     It can really hurt <BR>     And these
moments given <BR>     Are a gift from time <BR>     Just let us try <BR>    
To give these moments back <BR>     To those we love <BR>     To those who
will survive 
</P>
<P>And I can hear my mother saying <BR> &quot;Every old sock meets an old shoe&quot;
<BR> Isn't that a great saying? <BR> &quot;Every old sock meets an old shoe&quot;
<BR> Here come the Hills of Time

the stars

we'd never change.)

<P>    Oooh and if you see the woman with the key <BR>     I hear she's
opening up the doors to Heaven <BR>     Oh and here comes the man with the
stick <BR>     He said he'd fish me out of the moon 
</P>
<P>    Ohoh here's the constellation of the heart <BR>     It is the
constellation of the heart

<P>    Oh yes it is the constellation of the heart </P>

<H2><A NAME="ywa">&quot;You Want Alchemy&quot;</A></H2>
<P>What a lovely afternoon <BR> On a cloudbusting kind of day.<BR>  We took
our own 'Mystery Tour' <BR> And got completely lost somewhere up in the hills. 
</P>
<P>And we came up on a bee-keeper, <BR> And he said &quot;Did you know they
can change it all?&quot; 
</P>
<P>You want alchemy. <BR> They turn the roses into gold <BR> They turn the
lilac into honey <BR> They're making love for the peaches. 
</P>
<P>And we're thinking, <BR> &quot;Who is this guy?&quot; <BR> &quot;Is he
some kind of nut or what?&quot;. 
</P>
<P>He said, &quot;I don't meet many people..&quot;,<BR>  &quot;I'm very busy
with the hives.&quot;. <BR> ZzzzZzzzz.. Sun's gone down.. <BR> &quot;When's my
cloud of bees coming home?&quot;. 
</P>
<P>They got alchemy. <BR> They turn the roses into gold <BR> They turn the
lilac into honey <BR> They're making love for the peaches. 
</P>
<P>And they'll do it, <BR> Do it for you. <BR> They'll do it, <BR> Do it for
you. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And if you see them, send 'em right on home to me&quot; 
</P>
<P>(what they gonna do...?) </P>
<P>They got Aaaaaaaa.. <BR> Turn the roses into gold. <BR> And they'll do it
for you 
</P>
<P>Do it for you (what they gonna do...?) </P>
<P>I'll tell Yaaaaaa...</P>
<P>Making love for the peaches. (what they gonna do...?)</P>
<P>Daaaaaamaaaaakiiiiindaaaaa honey. </P>
<P>(they do it for you)</P>
<P>They do it for you.</P>
<P>And why not...? <BR> They bring me so much pleasure.
