</P>
<P>The next single in the UK is supposed to be 'Moments Of Pleasure' and will
be  released supposedly on November 15th. I suspect EMI are releasing it in view
of the  Christmas charts, very cynical, but then most record companies are only
interested in  money! People may disagree but I think the single will do as well
as TWW did, ie  everybody you meet likes it but don't buy it!!

<P>The MoP single is out now in the UK (and I'm listening to it now, thanks to
a  handy Sun CD-ROM drive, WorkMan and Evan's walkman headphones 8-). The  track
list is 
</P>

<LI>Moments (5:20)     </LI>

<LI>December will be Magic Again (4:49)     </LI>
<LI>Experiment IV (4:24)    </LI></OL>
<P>So it seems the EMI have changed their mind since Homeground got their
inside  scoop (this *isn't* the box edition). CD-single cat number is CDEM297. I
don't think  DwbMA is the &quot;bongos&quot; version, but I've only ever heard
it on a video of the &quot;Kate&quot;  Xmas special, so I may be wrong. EIV
seems like the album mix. SaLD sounds very,  umm, commercial at the moment, but
polished. 
</P>
<P>The cover has a very nice photo of KaTe (smiling!) hitching up her skirts
and  trampling on flaming skeletons (huh?), against a red/purple background -
would  make an excellent poster. I haven't seen the EtM video but from the
descriptions  I've read, it sounds similar.

Subject: A new song of Kate??? (SALD)
</P>
<P>Hello, 
</P>
<P>I've been yesterday in a shop that is famous for its numerous imports of CD.
Of  course I first checked that there were no new CD of Kate. I had already
bought  TRS,and two 4-songs-CD whose titles are RG and EtM. But I found an other
one in  fact two! 
</P>
<P>The first one has perhaps already been presented on the list, it contains 2
CD: the  one with RG and an other one with an interview of Kate. The 2nd one
(IMHO the  most interesting one) had 4 tracks: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Moments of pleasure     </LI>
<LI>Show a little devotion     </LI>
<LI>December will be magic again     </LI>
<LI>Experiment IV    </LI></OL>
<P>I might say something wrong, but SaLD seems to be a recent song (at least I 
didn't knew it): the way Kate sings reminds me of her latest albums, whereas 
DWBMA sounds really like one of her &quot;old&quot; songs. I find SaLD really
amazing. So I  can just advice you to look after the CD.

</P>
<P>I've been working my way through The Garden recently, and in one of JCB's 
articles for the KBC magazine, decribing the recording of Never For Ever, he 
mentions some of the things KaTe and other denizens of Abbey Road at that time 
would get up to: 
</P>
<P>&quot;...Kate acts as a focus for many people with ideas, and the
conversation in the  studio could be as absurd as wondering how many times the
record-holder managed  to spin round in his chair without his feet touching the
ground, to the latest on the  Quantum theories...&quot; 
</P>
<P>So I guess that's where the line in &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; comes
from. However,  I still don't know who &quot;Teddy&quot; was (not listed in the
credits on NFE).

<P>Woops, should have waited before I said that. In KaTe's article for issue 7
of the  KBC magazine, again about NFE, she refers to Jon Kelly (recording
engineer),  herself and John Barrett (Abbey Road engineer?) as &quot;Andy Pandy&quot;,
&quot;Loopy Lou&quot; and  &quot;Teddy&quot; respectively - three characters
from an old BBC childrens' show.

<P>Most likely to be Gary Brooker. The singer, pianist, composer, and general 
leading light of Procol (note spelling) Harum. He's a good mate of Eric
Clapton's  which may be how come he gets to appear on the new KaTe. He's made at
least  three solo albums since Procol folded and last year (may have been '91) a
number of  ex-members got together to make a rather underwhelming album called &quot;Prodigal

<P>The weekly music newspaper &quot;Rumba&quot; (Finnish equivalent of NME) has
Kate on  the front, and gives the centre spread to yet another version of the
Chrissie Illey  (sp?) interview. One thing that I haven't noticed in previous
transcripts of this  interview: Moments of Pleasure was written before Hannah
Bush's death. In the  record review section TRS gets 4.5 points out of 5.

Newcombe&quot; &lt;kln@crl.com&gt; <BR> Subject: Who are Maureen, Michael?
Possible Answers 
</P>
<P>Greetings my darling rocket tails. The day before I bought TRS I picked up a
 copy of the new Dead Can Dance album, which is dedicated to the memory of 
Maureen Copper. I think it is too much of a coincidence that Kate also mentions
a  Maureen in her list of beloved departed ones, and my speculation is that
Maureen  Copper was someone in the music industry who was friends with many
people --  perhaps the Homeground Twins could verify this. 
</P>
<P>Can you really not ken who Michael was? Who did Kate come to New York to 
see? Whose movie did she take as inspiration for the album and film? 
</P>
<P>I was in New York during the blizzard last spring, on a balcony of the
Royalton  Hotel as it came roaring into town, hailing and snowing and lightning
all at one time,  and the buildings all up and down 44th Street slowly turned
into mountains -- she  captured it well, and with such simplicity.

<P>WHO IS MAUREEN? 
</P>
<P>I don't know who she is exactly, but judging from the sequence in TLTCTC 
where most of the names in Moments were represented by figures floating past 
Kate, then she was (or is) a rather large, black woman, maybe in her 30s. This 
assumes Kate would choose reasonable likenesses of the people in the song for
the  parts in the film. If this is true then the Michael at the end is not
another reference  to Michael Powell as he was displayed as a young man.

<P>The Glitch in Moment of Passion that I hear is arround 2:26. It's sort of

</P>
<P>There was some discussion a while back about a possible recording glitch on
the  new album during MoP. If by this it was meant the high-pitched I hear it
quite  consistently *throughout* the album, e.g. the end of squeak at the
beginning of the  line &quot;&gt;Oh&lt; God I can't stop laughing&quot; then
EtM, the &quot;I'll do it for you&quot;s on SoS,  throughout the title track,
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>I'd like to believe it's the release of a glottal stop--or something--at a
particularly  high pitch (I've heard it on other tracks--&quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;,
&quot;You know &gt;how&lt; to  work me&quot;, for instance), but it sounds
suspicious. I would defer to the opinion of an  expert, however. Mr. Drukman,

<P>As I posted a while back, &quot;Teddy&quot; is most likely Jon &lt;somebody&gt;,
an assistant  engineer at Abbey Road Studios during the recording of Never
Forever. The name  &quot;Teddy&quot; comes from the nicknames Andrew Powell (?),
Kate and Jon gave  themselves at the time (Andy Pandy, Loopy Lou and Teddy, from
the old Andy  Pandy childrens' TV show). I got this from an old KBC magazine
article reproduced  in The Garden.

<P>The Japanese fanzine's information about the identity of Maureen is much 
appreciated. Since the rest of its identifications are accurate, IED is not
inclined to  doubt it about this one, though confirmation would be useful. The
name of the  engineer referred to as Teddy is Jon Barratt. Andy Pandy, Loopy Lou
and Teddy  were favorites of IED's when he was a small child. Perhaps this in
part explains his  attachment to Kate Bush now -- he unconsciously sees a little
bit of Loopy Lou in  her.

<P>This saying was common enough where I grew up; it was something said to 
people lamenting about not being able to find a girlfriend or boyfriend. A
common  variant of this was &quot;for every old sock, there is an old shoe&quot;.
Basically, it was used to  mean that somewhere out there is a mate for each of
us. As to the tastefulness of  the imagery, I have no comment. ;-) Incidentally,
the place I grew up was the island  of Newfoundland in Canada which has a very
large population of people of Irish  descent. Kate's mother, Hannah, was Irish I
believe. BTW, I rather prefer your  interpretation of the saying, it's a lot
more refined than how the saying was actually  used in Nfld.
