<BR> Subject: Eat the Music Single 
</P>
<P>Scott asked: 
</P>
<P>&gt;OK, so what does the Eat the Music single look like? 
</P>
<P>Well, having just driven all over town to get it, I can tell you! 
</P>
<P>The cover is a picture of various pieces of fruit (watermelon, pomegranate,
etc.)  arranged &quot;artistically&quot; with a pair of hands splitting a
watermelon open over them.  On the back is a small picture of The Red Shoes
album. The album cover is black  with a circle taking up most of it. Inside the
circle is a black and white tinted  photograph of a mountains, clouds, etc. Over
the photo are two legs doing a dance  step. They are wearing red stockings and
(of course) red shoes.  
</P>
<P>Anyway, back to the single. The CD itself is half red and half black, with
fruit on  the red half. As for the songs, there is &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; &quot;Eat
the Music&quot; (12&quot; version),  &quot;Big Stripey Lie,&quot; and &quot;Candle
in the Wind.&quot; The remix of &quot;ETM&quot; is not very  exciting. Just
longer with a long percussion break. I don't know what to think of  &quot;BSL&quot;
having only listened to it once. I think it will grow on me more than &quot;ETM&quot;
 has, though.

</P>
<P>Well nobody else has said anything about the US single, so here goes. I just
ran  out and bought the Eat the Music single and listened to it on my lunch
hour. 
</P>
<P>The cover is a bit unexpected. Its a color photo of two hands (Kates?)
digging into  an opened melon (maybe a small watermelon). This melon is
surrounded by many  other opened (cut in half) melons and fruits (pomegranites,
guavas, mangoes, and  the like). The back of the jewel box is the same photo
only its done through a  polarizing filter or something so its very dark and
reversed densities (light is black). 
</P>
<P>Inside, there is no booklet but the words to Eat the Music are printed as
are the  musicians names. The cd itself is half black and the other half has yet
more melons  and this time bunches of grapes also. 
</P>
<P>First impressions of the music; Eat the Music is, IMHO, mediocre. It has a
calypso  type beat which is not too bad, but I must say, I didn't care much for
the chorus  about 'like a banana, want a guava, etc.' The 12&quot; version of
this song is pretty similar  but with a faster tempo and more dance-mix type
percussion. 
</P>
<P>Big Stripey Lie, I liked much better. It would be a great song if Adrian
Belew had  done the guitar solos. They're in the same vain as his stuff and he
could have just  ripped it up! 
</P>
<P>Candle in the Wind is also on this single. 
</P>
<P>Cheers. Glen

</P>
<P>Well, I have in my sweaty little hands the CD for &quot;Eat the Music&quot;.
Unfortunately,  my CD player is at home, so you'll have to wait a day for my
review of this single  (The ONLY review that matters!) 
</P>
<P>However, I can give my review of the cover: 
</P>
<P>It's completely disgusting. I love it! Freud would have a heart attack if he
saw it. 
</P>
<P>Also, to throw my voice into a couple of the sillier discussions right now
going on  here: 
</P>
<P>The drum machine is the most evil piece of technology invented. Synthisizers
are  a tool so powerful they can only be used for good or evil (quick! spot the
reference!).  Good uses of the synth: The Dreaming, Hounds of Love. Evil uses of
the Synth: Most  everything else.

<BR> Subject: My Own Humble Opinion 
</P>
<P>1) Eat The Music 
</P>
<P>Lots of fun, very bouncy and cute. Trivial, but I like it. I think it might
be the  first song on the album that I get tired of, but for now I don't mind
hearing it over  and over again. 
</P>
<P>2) ETM (extended) 
</P>
<P>Extended triviality, but I like it too. 
</P>
<P>3) Big Stripey Lie 
</P>
<P>*Very* cool! Even though I don't much care for the drum machine sound, I'll 
get over it, just because everything else about the song is interesting. I
especially like  the violin. I assume it's Nigel Kennedy....sighyummy. 
</P>
<P>4) Candle In The Wind 
</P>
<P>I *LOVE* this version!!! I've loved it since I first heard it on the &quot;Rocket
Man&quot;  CD single. I could listen to it over and over and over again. The
music, the keyboards,  remind me of Tony Bank's first solo album A Curious
Feeling and maybe that's  why I love it so much. The background vocals are lush
and ethereal, and the  forground vocal is plaintive and poignant. When Kate
sings &quot;...all the press were  hounding you&quot; it's sung with such
empathy and force that it gives me chills. 
</P>
<P>Kate knows all about being hounded by the press (before Di came along Kate
was  the most photographed woman in England) and yet she didn't have it a
fraction as  bad as Marilyn. I definitely hear this as a tribute to *Marilyn*
rather than just a  tribute to Elton John's song. I love listening to this song
on headphones because the  music and background vocals swirl around and fade in
and out in an almost  disorienting way. That slightly edgy yet lush arrangement,
plus Kate's alternating  melodic/clipped way of singing adds up to (for me) a
very haunting and disorienting  song, which seems quite perfect since Marilyn's
life was haunting and dis-orienting.  I love it, I simply, honestly, love it.

</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>Big Stripey Lie: 
</P>
<P>YAAAY!!! Brilliant!! The most uncomfortable song Kate's done since, well, 
Waking the Witch. Is it me, or does this song kind of remind you of Bowie in his
 non-ambiant &quot;Heroes&quot; era? 
</P>
<P>Candle in the Wind: 
</P>
<P>Hey, I *LIKE* this song. On the other hand, I am thinking of starting a
support  group for folks like me who like &quot;Reaching Out&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Stev0: (walking slowly to podium, his eyes watering) Hello. (pause) My name
is  Steve...and I...I love...th-th-the s-s-song...&quot;Reaching Out&quot;
(breaks down and  cries) 
</P>
<P>Vickie: Amen, Brother! 
</P>
<P>Jorn:	 Let it out! We're with you! 
</P>
<P>Anyway, this has always been my favorite Elton John song, and Kate's voice
has  never been better, and if you don't like it you can go back to your Vanilla
Ice  albums and leave this work of UTTER BRILLIANCE to me!

<P>Date: Mon, 13-Sep-93 01:58:18 PDT <BR> From: briarpatch!billy@uunet.UU.NET
(Billy Green) <BR> Subject: New Singles--some thoughts 
</P>
<P>EAT THE MUSIC is about emotional exposure. As with most Kate songs, the 
biggest clue about the song comes near the end: &quot;What am I singing?/A song
of  seeds/The food of love/Eat the music.&quot; I suppose you could consider it
emotional  violence if you don't want people to know what your feelings are, but
the intention  of the song seems to be good natured. 
</P>
<P>What splits the speaker open? Devotion. Closeness (in a relationship, one
could  assume) requires intimate knowledge of one another. Her emotions are not
difficult  to find. His, it seems, have to be ripped out of him. Notice that the
fruits depicted on  the cover and in the song are almost exclusively seed
fruits--melons, mangoes,  papayas, pomegranates--that are used traditionally as
feminine images (both literally  and figuratively). The only &quot;male&quot;
fruit mentioned in the song is a banana, which is  split to reveal that &quot;He's
a woman at heart/And I love him for that&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The song's premise is the old stereotype that women's emotions are easily
seen,  while men don't want their feelings to be known. She is willing to dig
beneath the  surface to find a feeling, caring person underneath. There are also
some sexual  overtones--the standard sensual associations of the fruits
mentioned and shown, the  reference to &quot;sticky fingers&quot;. 
</P>
<P>One problem with this song as an American single is that you will be hard 
pressed to find an American who will know what a sultana is. &quot;Sultana&quot;
is a  primarily British reference. In fact, I'm not entirely sure what it is
myself--I think  it's a raisin or a grape. (On the other hand, you'd also be
hard pressed to find an  American radio-listener who pays enough attention to
lyrics to notice a reference  like this....) 
</P>
<P>Musically, yes, it's very repetitive. I want to avoid calling it Latin music
until I  find what a Valiha is (an instrument played by Paddy and someone else).
I will  remind those who've been calling this song, &quot;bad Gloria Estefan&quot;,
that Kate's always  been ready to play with and blend musicalities in her
songs.In some of the songs on  &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, it was often hard
to tell whether the music was  Bulgarian-based or Irish-based. Remember that the
12/8 time of this song is very  Irish. Adding brass on top of that doesn't
necessarily make it &quot;Latin&quot;, although I will  admit that the repeated
trumpet duet has a decidedly mariachi feel to it--but I  wouldn't tag the song
as even vaguely &quot;Latin&quot; until the trumpets start. 
</P>
<P>I also suspend final analysis until I see how this song fits into the
context of the  story of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (which is a film I fell in
love with in high school, and  which I think Kate, with her flair for the
melodramatic, should do wonderful things  with).

</P>
<P>This is my opinion, of course, and I CAN see why others might not like it:
it is  repetitive, and the composition, while interesting is somewhat shallow. 
</P>
<P>I didn't like it that much the first time I heard it, but now I LOVE it, and
I play it  again and again, including the extended mix. 
</P>
<P>Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you WANT to like Eat the Music,
but  you just can't get into it. Here's what you do.

<LI>Turn it up very loud.     </LI>
<LI>Jump up and down to the beat. Dance! DANCE, DAMMIT! 
</LI></OL>
<P>I must admit that one of the reasons I love it so is the words: &quot;He's a
woman at  heart/And I love him for that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's a love song, to me. A complicated, difficult love, certainly, but a
love song.

<BR> Subject: Eat the Music cassette
</P>
<P>Just a note. The U.S. &quot;Eat the Music&quot; single has finally shown up
in stores on  cassette. It's selling for $5.44 at Tower, not $2.99 (the price of
most cassette-singles).  Since there are plenty of $2.99 cassingles that contain
as much material as the  cassette-EPs that sell for nearly twice as much, the
whole enterprise smells pretty  fishy. However, it's a good product, in a hard
plastic cassette case, with a four-color  cover (the same as the CD), and it
contains both versions of the title track plus BSL  and CitW. It still hadn't
appeared on the Billboard charts as of the week ending  Sept. 25; perhaps it'll
show up in the next one -- especially if the way the CD-single  was sailing out
the doors of the Greenwich Village Tower is any indication.

</P>
<P>Hi all, 
</P>
<P>I just got my copy of EtM yesterday in Sydney. Here is where I stick my neck
 out... I LIKE it. There, I've said it... Sure it's different, I'm GLAD it's
different.  There is still that ineffable KaTiness about it all and as a song
it's very listenable (is  that a word?) Anyway, the important thing is, and here
is the crux of the matter,  many of my friends who are in no way KaTe fans have
come up to me as I have  played it and RBG asked &quot;Who is that!? ... I like
it!!&quot; and isn't that what we all  want! You know, spreading the word!! 
</P>
<P>Last night when I put it (EtM) one for my other flat mates as we were doing
the  washing up Jaquie asked who it was. When I explained it was my new KaTe EtM
 CD single. I've kept all my friends up to date with the ongoing hubub on gaffa
with  the new releases. She listened for a bit more and said &quot;I don't know
what they're  talking about I like it!&quot; I felt like we were in some sort of
weird Coke Ad since we  ended up dancing around the kitchen to it whilst washing
up. :-)
