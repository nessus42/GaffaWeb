      <BR> Subject: News about Kate's next album (maybe!) </P>
    
    <P>A high-placed source, whose identity I'm not sure I should reveal, told
      me at the convention that the tour Kate was talking about is actually
      supposed to be in support of her NEXT album! Currently, the expected
      completion date is July 1991, though Kate's completion dates have been
      known to slip, as we all know. I wouldn't believe it either, but this
      source is usually very reliable. </P>

    <P>The new Homeground, no. 40, popped through my door this morning. It
      contains some interesting stuff. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, much is made of the fact that she is going to tour - they say
      they have been waiting to print that headline ever since they started the
      fanzine. It seems that very few people knew beforehand - certainly not the
      Homeground team, not even Steve Davis. It seems that a new album is set
      for Summer-Autumn '91, too.</P>

      <BR> Subject: Tour posters?</P>
    
    <P>I was just on the phone with some folks in California who publish tour
      posters. While chatting, I asked the innocent question &quot;do you have
      any Kate Bush posters for sale?&quot; expecting a quick, sorry no, we only
      do US stuff...... </P>
    
    <P>The answer? Well, it surprised me! How about: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;You know, funny you should ask that, 15 minutes ago, we were
      comissioned to do a Kate Bush poster.&quot;</P>
    
    <P>Now, knowing that they are in the business of TOUR posters. I will let
      you draw your own conclusions...</P>
    
    <P>The person I talked to said, there are no further details at this time.
      I told them I want to buy a Lithograph of this poster whatever it is going
      to be. I also mentioned they may get tons of phone calls if I tell
      everyone this &amp; it was requested that I go ahead and tell but please
      don't say who they are just yet. (They want to get the details worked
      out....) </P>
    
    <P>More details as soon as I get them.... </P>

    <P>The news is small but signifiKanT, in IED's estimation: a little sParrow
      has let IED know that Lindsay Kemp (Kate's first dance and mime
      instructor) was interviewd on BBC Radio 4 during the week of May 8th. In
      that interview he let slip that he was helping Kate &quot;with the tour&quot;.
      He offered no further information, but the evidence certainly seems to be
      mounting! </P>

      <BR> Subject: album and tour news</P>
    
    <P>Peter Fitzgerald-Morris called me last week and said that, it's certain
      that no single will be released by the end of the year. The album is still
      being worked on, but &quot;very near completion&quot; though with Kate
      that still means months more work yet to be done. The tour is still on,
      but details (tour and album) are locked up tight and will remain so for a
      while yet. That's all the Kate news he had. </P>

    <P>I'm kinda surprised that there hasn't been more talk about the KBC
      flyer, though I may have missed the talk. First off it contains a message
      from Kate which says: </P>
    
    <H3>I was really knocked out by the beautiful cards and gifts you sent for
    my birthday, you are all so very kind - thank you. The album is going well
    and I think it might be good...... </H3>

    <P>Talked to Tom this a.m. (Sat). He thought we would have heard long ago
      (2 weeks!) that he'd put out the word that he'd heard from a guy who was
      also a friend of Clapton's that Clapton's been working with Kate on her
      new one four songs, in fact (or rumor, anyway) and they claimed July was a
      poss, it's a new direction ;^);^);^) </P>
    
    <P>he thought maybe clapton was standing in for gilmour, who is injured.

    <P>I was looking for the new &quot;Recorld Collector&quot; yesterday when
      something caught my eye: The February issue of &quot;Guitar&quot; magazine
      had a cover feature on Eric Clapton. Remembering Jorn's posting, I picked
      it up and had a quick skim through the article. Sure 'nuff, Her hallowed
      name was there in the interview, in a discussion about Eric experimenting
      with differnt styles: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I did a thing with Kate Bush recently&quot; </P>
    
    <P>He goes on to say that Kate approached him, and that </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I love her music but I didn't know how I would fit in&quot; </P>
    
    <P>and </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I wondered where we'd meet, musically&quot; </P>
    
    <P>He doesn't say much more, but from the tone of the article it seems that
      they did find somewhere to meet. Btw, the quotes are from memory, but I
      think I got the gist. </P>

    <P>We just got back from SIGGRAPH and found a message on the answering

      forgotten to call last year after he said he would, but forgot. In his own
      words... </P>
    
    <P>&quot;We saw Dr. Bush on Tuesday. There is no real news unfortunately,
      the album is almost finished but Kate is still actually working on it. She
      is recording at the moment, she's been doing all sorts of things with the
      album. As time goes on it looks more likely that it's not going to be
      released this year, I know, bad news, but there you go. So anyway, that's
      it really, just wish you Happy Katemas, whatever you're doing...&quot;

      <BR> From: Andrew B Marvick &lt;abm4@cunixa.cc.columbia.EDU&lt;
      <BR> Subject: KT NEWS (Vox)</P>
    
    <P>VOX Magazine has a brief news report updating the rumors about Kate and
      Prince. As IED remembers it, Kate was seen talking intently with Prince
      after one of his recent London concerts, and the assumption was that they
      were discussing new plans to work together. The report also stated that
      there was a rumor of a four-track EP featuring recordings that the two had
      already done together, and which was never released (as we all know). This
      was supposed to be the explanation for Prince's thankyou to Kate on his
      last album. IED hopes this isn't all just a repeat of someone else's old
      posting. There was a little more in the VOX report, but IED can't remember
      how it was worded. Anyone? </P>
    
    <P>Also, IED wonders if some knowledgeable and enterprising philocanine
      might want to post this news to a Prince computer discussion group (if
      there is one), in hopes that people there will keep an ear out for any new
      four-track bootleg of Prince (with a funny-voiced Englishwoman singing
      along with him) that might crop up among the seeming thousands of such
      products that glut the Princefans' market these days... </P>
    
    <P>-- Andrew Marvick (IED)</P>
    
    <P>She really is...</P>
    
    <P>P.S.: Visitors to New York City might want to stop in at Rebel Rebel
      Records in Greenwich Village, where the proprietor keeps a poster hanging
      from the ceiling over the cash register -- a poster of Kate (from The
      Sensual World, the one with the orange band at the bottom) signed and
      dedicated to Rebel Rebel by Kate in her characteristic hand, in silver
      marker...A good place to keep up to date on Kate items when you're in
      town... </P>
