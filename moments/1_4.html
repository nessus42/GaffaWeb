</P>
<P>IED suggests everyone take the following rumor &quot;with a pinch of salt,&quot;
but for  what it may conceivably be worth, it is being repeated here: 
</P>
<P>The rumor is that Kate may after all do two brief live dates in the U.S.,
one in  New York, the other in Los Angeles. This was the talk in the ether at
Sony Records,  New York. No confirmation yet, to say the least! Almost certainly
this is not going to  happen, but then again... 
</P>
<P>By the way, the U.S. poster (normal size, not subway size) for The Red Shoes
is in  some shops in Manhattan, as are the flats.

<P>P.S.: In regard to Ed Suranyi's sensible request that some Love-Hound
inquire of  Columbia about Kate's doings while in NYC -- IED met a brick wall

<BR> Subject: Just back from Tower! 
</P>
<P>Well, what can I say. I got up to the table, and my mind went completely
blank.  Kate said &quot;hello&quot; (isn't she brilliant?) and I said &quot;hi.&quot;
She asked if I wanted her to  sign &quot;to&quot; someone and I said &quot;David.&quot;
She signed my 12&quot; vinyl Cloudbusting single &quot;To  David, with love,
Kate Bush.&quot; I said &quot;thanks so much&quot; and that was it. Perhaps some
 others had more interesting interactions. I got in just before 6PM (waited
since  1:30PM) and things were pretty rushed. The line at 6PM still went down
the block,  around the corner and down the block again. There was no way all of
those people  were going to get in. I saw Doug and Andy at the very front of the
line (6AM will  get you a great spot), and look forward to their reports. 
</P>
<P>Bye now.

SW@zis.ziff.com&gt; <BR> Subject: Kate at Tower 
</P>
<P>Well I had to work until 5:00 pm yesterday, so I didn't get to Tower until
5:20,  but I thought, &quot;she's going to be here for at least two hours, I'm
sure I'm not too  late.&quot; Oops! She was scheduled to stay until 6:00, but
ending up staying until 7:00 (out  of the Kateness of her heart). Yes, she was
still there when I got there, but the line  was AROUND THE BLOCK! It went from
the entrance to 4th Street, 4th to  Lafayette, down to 3rd (or whatever the
Street just south of 4th is), and back to  Broadway. Now that's some line. 
</P>
<P>So I won't keep you in suspense, I'll let you know right here that I didn't
get to  see her. I waited an hour and a half, and they just sent us away.
(Alright now, who's  scheduling my pity party?) BUT: I had a great time! Kate
fans are a lot of fun. I  talked with people who subscribe to Homeground, and
someone who used to get  Still Breathing, but who doesn't know if it is still
available or not (I couldn't help  him). I didn't see a single Love-Hound,
though. I'm sure the hounds who were  there got there MUCH earlier. 
</P>
<P>I heard from someone who came out after having met with her, and he said she
 was being very friendly and personable to everyone. She didn't just sign &quot;Kate
 Bush&quot;, but rather included the person's name, and a brief message. I guess
that  would have been pretty exciting, had I gotten in. I had brought the lid
from the box  set, for which I bought a silver marker (since you obviously
wouldn't be able to read  a signature in pen :-)) which cost $2.95. I don't need
this darn marker for anything  else, so I guess I wasted a couple bucks on a
dream that never came to be :-(.

Kate at Tower 
</P>
<P>I went, I saw, I forgot to say 'hi' for Fiona. Must have been because my
mind  went blank. I think that occured to &gt;90% of the fans. Rules were one
item only to  sign, no cameras. I had her sign a postcard from Orgonon and had
the presence of  mind to ask if she had ever been there to which she replied no.
It was a tough  choice between the post card and the cover of The Dreaming.
Meredith got The  Dreaming signed. We got there at noon and were just under a
half block from the  front. IED was first and |&gt;oug was second. They got
there at 6am. I as number 75 in  line according to the armbands they handed out.
Kate arrived in a white limo about  20 minutes before 4pm. I actually got to see
her around 5. Film crews from MTV and  Entertainment Tonight where there. My
wife switched on MTV last night about  10pm and just saw the Tower record logo
on a building as MTV 'news' got over. I  don't know if this was Kate coverage of
the event.

<P>Date: Sat, 11 Dec 93 23:31:16 EST <BR> From: jrp@accint.COM <BR> Subject:
Her Kateness in NYC 
</P>
<P>Greeting, beloved brethren in Kate... 
</P>
<P>Since I didn't see Andy or Doug's report, I'll make some general commentary 
before relating my experience. (BTW...Chris and Vickie...you were missed. I was 
suprised you couldn't show, and was standing next to a guy whose name I don't 
recall at the moment (an ex LH), who commented about you not being here, and  |&gt;oug
I think mentioned it also. Well...you were in our thought...at least until we 
caught a glimpse of Her. Ahem.) 
</P>
<P>First of all, I had a blast. I got in line at about 8:30 after the catching
the shuttle  from Boston. I was 22nd in line, with Andy and |&gt;oug 1 and 2
respectively. The day  went fairly quickly, I was talking to a couple of people
around me who were only  slightly wierder than I am, so it was interesting
enough. When Kate showed at 3:45  or so, reports indicated the line went all the
way around three sides of Tower  records. 
</P>
<P>After a few minutes, they let us in, in 10s. The two earlier groups averaged
about  a minute a person, but it went more quickly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>When I got in the door, I caught my first glimpse of Her...and I
thought/said (I  can't tell...) &quot;My God...She's Beautiful&quot;. While
standing in line, this sort of became  a mantra, although I could tell some of
my cognitive functions were still working...I  thought about the structure of
the sentence make sure it was &quot;My God! She's...&quot;  instead of &quot;My
God is...&quot;. Ahem. 
</P>
<P>Regardless, I finally made my way up to the front of the line, and stepped
up to  the pedestal she was sitting on. &quot;Hi&quot; quoth she. &quot;Uh...Hi&quot;
quoth I, in absolutely  brilliant form. &quot;How you doin'&quot; quoth she. &quot;Uh...oooookay.&quot;
quoth I. &quot;Who do you  want this signed to?&quot; &quot;Uh...J--Jason&quot;.
(Then, my left lobe kicked in as she was  signing...&quot; &quot;Uh, Ms.
Bush...about the song Lily...did you learn the ritual that way or&quot;  (a guy
gave me a nudge to get going, Kate finished signing my piece now) &quot;No...it's
 not a ritual, just a prayer someone taught me&quot; (Over my shoulder was I was
shuffled  off) &quot;Oh...thanks&quot; 
</P>
<P>She signed my little picture from the MOP boxed set, like she signed nearly 
everything, To &lt;person&gt;, With Love, Kate Bush, X. 
</P>
<P>So, I wandered off, and found a spot where I could KateWatch for a while,
while  talking to Doug and Andy and company. (One young lady from SanFran tried
to get  her arm signed to have it tatooed in, but Kate said something to the
effect of 'Oh, I  can't, maybe you won't like me in a few years...', and signed
something else.  That's so sweet) We showed off our new posessions, and watched
some more. She  looked so sweet there, signing and being cordial and pleasant to
everybody. 
</P>
<P>I wandered off from upstairs at about 5:00, and walked around. I found this 
young woman, medium height, medium brown hair, fairly cute who I was sure I had 
met before, and she bumped into me, and gave me a flash of recognition and
started  to say something when someone pulled her aside. 
</P>
<P>I wandered off, and went back up to see the gang, and one commented they'd 
like to interview Lisa. I blinked, and said &quot;Who's that&quot; &quot;Kate's
secretary...&quot;. Hum... 
</P>
<P>I wandered around a bit more after that, and found this REALLY GREAT 
KATE-WATCHING SPOT! Behind her pedestal was a large TRS stand-up poster  thing,
about 2 feet from the wall, and the passage was blocked by a cd rack about 5 
feet high. Well, being a large guy, if I leaned against the wall just right, I
could see  her Kateness sitting there, doing her thing, about 2 feet forward and
4 feet left of  me! And (this is the coolest part) Del was leaning against the
wall right next to me!  I tried to be inconspicuous...I didn't want Kate to be
nervous, etc. But after a while,  Del looked over, and noticed I'd been standing
in the same spot for about an hour,  and chuckled. The brown-haired girl looked
over his shoulder and waved at me,  chuckling too. (It was 6:15 about this
time). Del was keeping track of time for Kate.  (I'll note for posterity, when
he wanted to get her attention one time, he said  &quot;Puddin'...Puddin?&quot;
and then spoke when she turned... Kate was very much  concentrated on signing
and talking.) 
</P>
<P>A couple of interesting things happened...one guy with a camera wanted to
try  my spot, but couldn't get a good sight, so did a long-arm over the cd case
and  snapped blind. Del said &quot;Hey! That's cheating!&quot; and chuckled.
This guy said &quot;Can  you take one then?&quot; Del looked like he was going
to say no, then relented, and  grabbed the guys camera and snapped one off. The
guy said to me &quot;Hey! These  Tower Record guys are pretty cool&quot;...I
laughed, and said &quot;Son, son, son... you  *don't* know who that was...(etc)&quot;.
It definately made a big impression on the guy.  (For my part, I think Del is
very cool...I had envisioned him as a little more aloof  than he was...he was
just happy and joking around, a nice guy) After that, Del and I  talked off and
on about nothing important until things got wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>A few things of note. 
</P>
<P>Number one: Bootlegs. She signed some of the bootlegs (the ones I recognized
as  older) without comment, like anything else. However, one guy came up with
one  which was obviously one she hadn't seen before (I only caught a glance, but
the  picture on the cover was an older one). She showed it to Del and to a
couple other  guys, and was amiable enough to the guy, but looked over at Del
and was visibly  upset/angry for a moment, but then put on her happy face at the
next person. From  my perspective, I can tell you *I* will never purchase a
bootleg anything of hers. 
</P>
<P>Two: that picture. You know, *that* picture, the halter top one. I saw her
sign  about three of them, each with obvious distaste, directed at the picture
never at the  person. I think you can tell when she is force-smiling instead of
when she is really  happy/oh-how-cute smiling by how her eyes crinkle.
Regardless, she tries to be  sweet to everybody...I think she knows it's not
their fault. 
</P>
<P>Three: &quot;HEY, KATE! HOW ARE YOU! I LOVE YOUR WORK SO MUCH!&quot; A  few
of the more boistrous members of the line obviously startled her. I think there 
is a significant difference in culture between what she knows and what we have 
here. Instant-friendship/salesman/advertising type of forward behaviour seems to
 makes her cringe. When I think back I think I got a little smile from my 'Ms. 
Bush' instead of 'Kate'. I suspect she likes it that way. (IMO) And, it seems
that  gushing, as it's called, kind of embarrasses her a little, but I think
she's gotten used  to it by now...one poor Oriental girl who didn't speak much
English was trying to  get her thoughts out, and nearly fainted, but Kate was
gracious and let her finish,  and smiled sweetly throughout. 
</P>
<P>Four: STUFF! My goodness...it's like her birthday all over again. At the end
of  the night, she had 3 and a half full large shopping bags of *stuff*, which I
will note  got sent with her secretary after she and Del and gang left. And
flowers! They piled  them up behind her, and it took two people to carry them
all away afterwards. I  noted some of the things she got, a couple of books,
some cd's, letters, pamphlets, a  red shoe (half of a pair) some rare nicknacks,
some junk (although I'm sure it has  special significance to somebody), etc. I
do kind of wonder what happens to it. 
</P>
<P>About 20 minutes before they left, I noted Del (who had been chewing on red 
licorish(sp?) all day) said something to the effect of &quot;I'm getting hungry&quot;
in Kate's  general direction, smiling and trying to get her to leave soon. She
wouldn't have any  of it. As they were getting ready to leave, I said loud
enough for Kate to hear &quot;Ms.  Bush, that was really sweet staying so long.
Thank you&quot; She looked startled, turned  around and flashed me a sweet
smile, and Del winked at me. 
</P>
<P>Hum, let's see. They wandered off between (?) 7:15 and 7:30, and I wandered 
around the store some more. I ran into this young lady, and I wandered up to
her,  and put two and two together and said &quot;Lisa?&quot;. In my mind, she
looked like she  could be a Lisa...I'm really bad with names. &quot;Yes...and I
know we met, but I can't  recall your name&quot;, and we talked a little, how I
had figured out her name, that she's  from NY, that no I'm not a journalist: I'm
not *that* sleezy, no she couldn't do  coffee, although she'd like to (forward
of me, I know), but gave me a little squeeze  and ran off. Sweet girl, I hope to
meet her again. 
</P>
<P>So, that was it, I believe...I probably left some interesting things out,
I'm still  processing all the info. 
</P>
<P>I've decided I'm going to go to my library and do a work up on all the
aspects of  Lilly that my ingeneum can come up with, I think it would make
interesting reading  for her. I'll probably post it before sending it, maybe
next week some time. (I was  kind of thinking about doing this for LH, since I
do have a broad knowledge base in  these things, but, to be honest, the amount
of work I am going to do is only justified  by the fact that Kate might be
interested. As much as I like you guys...:) 
</P>
<P>So, that was my KateExperience. I am *very* happy, and it was only a few 
hundred dollars and some time well spent.

<P>From: nessus@twitch.mit.edu (Douglas Alan) <BR> Date: Sun, 12 Dec 1993
23:29:07 GMT <BR> Subject: Report from the frontline 
</P>
<P>My girlfriend, Cheryl, and I left our apartment in Arlington, MA, at 8pm on 
Wednesday night and I drove the |&gt;ougmobile southwest until we arrived in 
Manhattan at about 12:30am. We stayed with a friend of Cheryl's (actually her 
previous boyfriend) in his apartment near the park on West 71st Street. I got up
at  5am, after only three and half hours of sleep, to make my way downtown to
meet  Andrew Marvick (i.e. IED's alter ego) at Tower Records. Cheryl said that
she was  too sleepy to come and she'd meet me there later if I saved her a
space. After  showering, shaving, and generally making myself presentable for
Kate, and then  dressing in thermal underpants, thermal undershirt, wool socks,
heavy jeans, long  sleeve shirt, official Kate Bush Club sweatshirt, and down
coat, I hopped in the  trusty |&gt;ougmobile and made my way downtown. 
</P>
<P>I arrived at the 4th and Broadway intersection--with which I would become
very  familiar over the course of the day--slightly before 6am. I was happy to
see that no  one was there, but I was nervous about standing there all by myself
since it didn't  look too safe. I thought about parking the car in one of the
numerous spots that are  legal until 8am to be sure I'd be first in line--I
could move the car later--but  decided to look for a spot that would be legal
all day long instead. I had no luck  finding such a spot, but returned every few
minutes to Tower Records to see if  Andy has appeared yet. Eventually I saw a
gentleman standing at the corner of  Tower Records--it was now about twenty past
six--and I stopped and asked him if  he was Andrew Marvick. He was! 
</P>
<P>I told him to save my spot and I'd go park in a lot. I parked in a lot that
was  about a block away (it cost $15!) and rushed back to Tower Records. There
were  already two more people in line. I boldly asserted that Andrew was saving
my spot  until I had parked the car and inserted myself at position number two.
I told them  that I was also saving a spot for my girlfriend and they only
seemed mildly bent out  of shape. 
</P>
<P>Throughout the long wait, we four (me, Andrew, Illana, and Ed -- I'm not
sure I  have &quot;Illana's&quot; name quite right) chatted about all sort of
Bushological matters.  Illana, currently a lurker on Love-Hounds, had flown all
the way from San Francisco  for this! She spent all her money getting to New
York and had to sleep on the NYC  money getting to New York and had to sleep on
the NYC subway. Putting one's life in danger is above and beyond the call of
duty for a  Bush fan! Her dedication also showed in what she wanted autographed.
She was  going to ask Kate to autograph her arm and then go have the autograph
tattooed in!  Ed came all the way from Hampshire college in western
Massachusetts. I'm not sure  how he found out about the event--he's not yet on
Love-Hounds, but says he will  participate when he gets back to school.
</P>
<P>By 7am there were about ten people standing in line. A very nice person
behind  us in line brought us hot chocolate from McDonald's without even asking
for money  to defray his cost. Some kind guy behind us in line also gave each of
us a  beautiful promo flier for *The Red Shoes*.  The line continued to grow 
very slowly until about 10am, when it started growing at a slightly faster 
pace.
</P>
<P>At some point before noon a few guys working at Tower Records brought out
police barricades to define the line a bit more formally.  By noon, there were a
bit under a hundred people in line.  Various Love-Hounds started finding Andrew
and me and coming up front to chat a bit.  Among them were Meredith Tarr, Greg
Bossert, Jessica, David Silver, Michael Knight, Jason Pascucci, Keith (I don't
know his last name, and I think he's not on the net anymore), and several others
who I have forgotten their names because I was too overwhelmed at the time.
</P>
<P>By 1pm, our gang of four was completely starving (not to mention very cold),
and  Ed ran up a few blocks to bring us back a large half-plain, half-mushroom
pizza. I  have no idea what the quality of the pizza was, but sitting there on
the cold sidewalk  of Greenwich Village with four devoted Kate Bush fans, it was
the best pizza I have  ever eaten. 
</P>
<P>At about 2pm, Cheryl (my girlfriend) showed up and I sneaked her into
position  number three. A little while later, this nearly caused a nice
gentlemen who had  brought us hot chocolate earlier expressed his extreme
discontent at this breach of  etiquette. The wrath of a large angry mob is only
equalled by the wrath of a live-in  girlfriend, however, so I stood up the best
I could for Cheryl, and eventually the guy  calmed down, or at least seemed to.

</P>
<P>At about 3pm things started going into a higher gear.  The line was growing
at a faster rate now, until the line went nearly all the way around the city
block.  Tower Records workers rearranged the barricades again to keep us better
fenced in.  They also put paper numbered wrist bands on everyone in line;
apparently a precaution against people sneaking into the autograph area inside
the store.  A reporter from Tower Records came and talked to Andrew and me
because we were at the beginning of the line.  He said that a blurb on us might
appear in Pulse.  A camera crew from Columbia Records asked us a few questions.
They were making a news clip that would be sent off to CNN and other news
broadcasters.  A man from the New York Times gave Andrew his business card and
asked Andrew to call him when he got a chance for help on an article on Kate
Bush that he is writing.
</P>
<P>Shortly before 4pm, Kate's limo arrived. I tried to snap a picture, but a
mob of  people rushed the area and all I could see was a flash of auburn hair
that rapidly  disappeared inside a side door. It was only about ten minutes,
however, until they let  us in to meet Kate. 
</P>
<P>Andrew went first, carrying the several dozen white roses he had brought for
Kate.  Once we were inside the store, Andrew was no longer first, however--a
couple of VIP's had been allowed in front without the dues of the long, cold
wait.  The VIP's didn't take long, though, and I started up my pocket tape
recorder as Andrew walked nervously forward.  Unfortunately, the sound system at
Tower was cranked so I had no expectation that my tape would turn out
comprehensible.  Thirty seconds later it was my turn.
</P>
<P>Despite my recommendation not to gush endlessly to Kate, I did anyway. My
little  conversation went something like this (the tape I made did not turn out 
understandable): 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; is the most incredible thing I have
heard in years! You  should play guitar more often. 
</P>
<P>	[Kate smiles at this, but heck, she smiles at everything everyone says.] 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: 	I am sure you don't remember me, but I interviewed you eight
years ago in  New York. 
</P>
<P>KATE: I'm sorry, no I don't. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: My name is Doug Alan and I'm the founder of Love-Hounds, which is
an  international computer network of thirty-thousand of your fans.
</P>
<P>KATE: Ah, yes! Thank you for the beautiful roses! 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: Oh, that was mostly Andrew's doing. But everyone on Love-Hounds
really,  really, really loves you. They all think you are great. Most of them
can't be  here today, but they all want to say hi. Can I ask you a question? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Sure. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: Was the idea of Love-Hounds or anything like it in your head when
you  wrote &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;? 
</P>
<P>KATE: No, not really. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: What happens at the end of &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;? Is
the voice that's  saying &quot;I hate to leave you&quot; -- is that the
computer? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes! .... Well, it's really been a long time since I've worked on that
song. I  can't remember much now. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: That's completely understandable. 
</P>
<P>	[|&gt;oug gives Kate his rare &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; single to be
autographed.] 
</P>
<P>KATE: Who would you like this signed to? 
</P>
<P>|&gt;oug: Doug. 
</P>
<P> [Kate signs the record, 
</P>
<P ALIGN="center">	To Doug <BR>  		with Love <BR>  	Kate Bush <BR>  	X 
</P>
<P>	Would you also do one for all of Love-Hounds? 
</P>
<P>	[|&gt;oug hands her a blank white piece of paper.] 
</P>
<P>KATE: Of course. 
</P>

</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Kate's pen runs out while she writes &quot;Bush&quot;, so
that that it is  barely legible. It looks as if some corrective surgery with a
xerox machine and pencil  should be able to restore it, however.]
</P>
<P>|&gt;OUG: Thanks! Keep doing great things! 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately I could not tell from the conversation whether or not Kate had
any  previous understanding of Love-Hounds, or whether she had just responded 
positively to the flowers Andrew had given her. 
</P>
<P>I walked out of the signing area in a dazed state.  Andrew came up to me and
said &quot;Wow, Doug!  Kate talked to you for nearly two minutes!&quot; I
explained to him that half of the time was spent with Kate writing out the note
to Love-Hounds.  I had only asked for an autograph for Love-Hounds, but it was
very nice of her to write a note.  After a few minutes of chatting with Andrew,
a woman from Sony Music came up to me saying she had overheard me talking to
Kate and wanted to find out more about Love-Hounds.  She gave me her number and
asked me to call her sometime soon.
</P>
<P>Between four and seven, Cheryl and I walked around the store trying to avoid
the Tower Records workers who were very insistent in trying to direct people out
of the store if they weren't shopping.  I took many photographs, but none of
them will come out good.  A large bouquet of roses had been strategically placed
to block photographs from the only good angle that was available from the store.
 The last time Kate was at Tower, they had not done this and I had been able to
take some good pictures.  I looked around for John Carder Bush, whom I wished to
talk to--I had chatted with him at the last in-store appearance--but he was not
to be found.  Neither was Paddy.  Del was behind the table with Kate and could
be approached, but at the time I couldn't think of anything to ask him, because
I'd been concentrating on things I wanted to ask John.  (Now, of course, I can
think of a hundred questions for Del.) 
</P>
<P>While wandering around, we intermittently ran into and chatted with other
Love-Hounds and people we had met in line.  Andrew had chatted for a bit with
Del.  Illana had tried to get her arm autographed, but Kate wanted to know why. 
When Illana had explained that she was going to get it tattooed in, Kate refused
saying &quot;You'll be off me in a couple years!&quot;  Keith had given Kate one
red shoe filled with good luck charms and got the other shoe signed for his sick
mother.  Kate had seemed moved that he was concerned with his mother.  Later
Keith and seen someone trying to get a &quot;Cathy Demos&quot; bootleg signed,
but Kate had refused to sign it, and the security guards had hurriedly ushered
the guy out.  Jason had asked Kate about the ritual in &quot;Lilly&quot;.  Kate
replied that it was a prayer, not a ritual.  Ed had given Kate one of his poems.

</P>
<P>Kate was only scheduled to sign until 6pm, but at 7pm she was still there. 
Cheryl was getting tired, so we left, and the line was still all the way down
the block, around the corner, and half way down that block.  Cheryl and I went
to the Manhattan Chili Company in the West Village, where we were served
excellent chili, but I was still to wound up to enjoy it.  We then went back to
Cheryl's friend's place, where I was soon catching up on lost sleep.

<P>Date: Mon, 13 Dec 93 13:34:46 EST <BR> From: Andrew B Marvick &lt;abm4@columbia.EDU&gt;
<BR> Subject: ied's belated tower report 
</P>
<P>IED arrived at a deserted Tower Records (Greenwich Village, 4th and
Broadway,  NYC) at 6 a.m., and was almost immediately met by erstwhile leader of
the  philocanine pack |&gt;oug /\lan. Also among the very first was Alanna
(sp?), a young  (to this hoary fan) Kate admirer (and Love-Hound lurker) who had
flown in from  San Francisco just to be there. In a spirit of bonhomie we became
cold together over  the succeeding ten hours in line. By 7 a.m. there were about
ten or twelve people  behind us, but when IED checked again at 6:15 p.m at least
1,500 still remained  outside. 
</P>
<P>Our group received greetings from Keith DeWeese, Jason S(? -- sorry), Mike 
Knight, Meredith Tarr, Jessica, Greg Bossert and at least a couple of others
whose  names IED cannot, alas, recall. A pleasant atmosphere prevailed
throughout the day,  and his companions kindly saved IED's place in line when,
at about 1 p.m., he left  briefly to freshen the Love-Hounds bouquet (3 dozen
white roses). We were also  briefly interviewed by a Pulse! reporter, and IED
was handed the business card of a  New York Times journalist. Inside the store
later, a video crew for Columbia told  IED that they would be making footage of
the event available to MTV and CNN,  among others. 
</P>
<P>Finally, IED had the honor of being the first of what certainly had to have
been  something close to 500 lucky fans who actually were able to meet Kate and
have her  sign something for them. He presented the flowers to her, and (through
a fog of  unreality and questionable consciousness) heard her say, &quot;Oh,
they're beautiful!&quot; to  which IED replied trenchantly, &quot;...Euh...uh...unh...&quot;

</P>
<P>Then, getting his wits about him, he blurted that the roses were being
offered in  behalf of Love-Hounds, the international Kate Bush computer
discussion group,  which now numbered many thousands of participants. 
</P>
<P>Kate diplomatically replied, &quot;Oh, Love-Hounds! Well, thank them all for
me very  much, will you? They're lovely!&quot; IED answered with devilish wit, &quot;Umm...ur...&quot;
 Then Kate signed IED's item, and he wandered off to catch his breath, and to 
observe (with awe and mounting jealousy) |&gt;oug chatting with Kate for what
seemed  at the very least *60* seconds! IED couldn't make out the details, but
he did hear  |&gt;oug's voice saying &quot;Love-Hounds&quot; and &quot;thousands
of subscribers&quot;. And IED heard a  report later that at least one other fan
had mentioned Love-Hounds to Kate, and that  at this third reference to our
group she had launched an uninterpretable sidelong  glance at Del.  
</P>
<P>Although it may prove controverSial to mentIon it, ied cannot omit to add
that  kate looked -- alas! -- spectacularlY beautiful, even to this fan, who
normalLy  doesn't Like to AcknowlEdge such tRivia. she worE all black, with
higH-heeled  boots, opaque black tightS, a long black Dress aNd a black leather
biker's jacket.  her hair really is thAt long. 
</P>
<P>A few moments later IED noticed that Kate's engineer and erstwhile
bass-player  Del Palmer was present (the two were still clearly very much
allied, contrary to the  claims of various English journalists), and after some
strained negotiations with  officious Tower Records personnel, IED was able to
speak with him. Fortunately IED  had thought to bring along the November issue
of Future Music (which features an  interview with and photograph of Del), and
he very kindly and enthusiastically  signed this for IED, who then asked the
only question (of the many which he had  prepared to ask before entering the
holy presence) which he could remember: Is  there or is there not a spoken
message in X4, just before the line &quot;But that dream is  your enemy&quot;? 
</P>
<P>The answer, after caveats about how long it had been and how memory might
not  serve well, etc., was &quot;Yes&quot;. Del explained that during that
period they had enjoyed  &quot;playing around&quot; with the tapes, and that in
X4 Kate had (as in parts of The Ninth  Wave) spoken the line (contents still not
disclosed to lowly fan), learned how it  sounded backwards, memorized the
backwards phonetics, recorded those, and  finally laid that recording down (once
again backwards) into place, so that the final  words would *sound* backwards
but would not actually *be* backwards. He said  that they had then &quot;snipped
it up into bits&quot; and put the bits back (in what order it  wasn't clear). In
sum, Del leaves us with no better understanding of the meaning (or 
significance, if any) of the line in question, but he seemed very happy to chat
about  it, and was (like Kate) unfailingly polite and cheerful throughout. 
</P>
<P>IED then spent an hour or so in the sterling company of |&gt;oug, Jason,
Keith,  Alanna and others, idly discussing our respective thirty-second
experiences and  observing Kate's indefatigably sweet-tempered engagement with
the endless stream  of fans. As in 1985 (the date of his first, only slightly
less brief meeting with Kate)  IED came away (this time with supporting
testimony from other fans of their nearly  identically uninformative interviews)
with the impression that Kate is 
</P>
<P>a.) extraordinarily kind and friendly, and 
</P>
<P>b.) superbly, magnificently, artfully *vague*. 
</P>
<P>Altogether, a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick (IED) 
</P>
<P>  P.S.: Columbia's Marketing Manager was there, and on questioning from IED 
she indicated that aside from the occasional semi-private screening of TL,TC,TC 
there was no plan to release the film in the U.S. This might be explained by the
 question of copyright which another Love-Hound introduced in a recent posting, 
coupled with the pique which IED can imagine EMI might be feeling right now at 
the efforts Kate seems willing to make at Columbia's request but not (perhaps)
at  EMI's. 
</P>
<P>IED would point out, however, that in fact aside from this single public 
appearance and the radio interview in Toronto scheduled for this evening there
is no  real evidence that Kate has done anything at all to promote the album for
Columbia,  either -- at least in England she consented to a number of print
interviews and even  performed on television (several months ago, admittedly).
The only NYC interview  which had been announced beforehand (for WHTZ) was
cancelled, IED was  assured over the phone, &quot;by Kate herself&quot; -- could
it be that she was made aware of  the grossly one-dimensional top-40 playlist of
that station, and decided it wasn't the  right place for her?

<P>From: wentod@rpi.edu (Debra L. Wentorf) <BR> Date: Mon, 13 Dec 1993
17:28:22 -0500 <BR> Subject: The Road to the Red Shoes 
</P>
<P>Hi, fellow Love-Hounds! 
</P>
<P>It's me, the prodigal daughter -- Deb Wentorf -- after a two-year hiatus
that's  left me sadly out of touch with all of you...my fellow Love-Hounds! But
fear not!  After a bit of digging, I was able to find Ed Suranyi's e-mail
address, and he was  able to get me started back on the road to recovery. =)
It's good to be back! 
</P>
<P>But now on to the real reason for writing. Last Thursday, December 9, 1993,
will  live as a day of infamy for all of us Love-Hounds who were lucky enough to
meet --  yea, to touch and talk with -- our fair Kate. A friend of mine had told
me the  previous week that Our Beloved was going to grace NYC with Her
prescence, and  so we left Albany shortly after 8:00 for the trek down to the
Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>By the time we arrived outside Tower Records, the line was already half-way 
down one side of the block, with approximately 50-60 people ahead of our 
three-person band of merry men. As fate would have it, we'd been standing in
line  little more than half an hour when here comes this guy down the sidewalk
holding  out a sign reading &quot;Love Hound?&quot; (Y' know, guy, now that I
think of it...*did* I  ever catch your name?)  Anyway, what should he tell me
but that the &quot;guy who'd  been here since 6:00 that morning&quot; was none
other than our own Andy  Marvick...why didn't I think of that myself? So natch I
had to go up and introduce  myself to him; Doug was there, too, and I have to
admit I was amazed that you both  remembered me, guys! Of course, Andy had a big
bouquet of white roses waiting  patiently in a large paper cup for Her Kateness;
well done, guy! I'm sure she loved  them! 
</P>
<P>Okay, okay. To make a long story short, it was incredible. People were
literally  standing on garbage bins and even the side of the building in hopes
of either getting  a glimpse of her and/or taking pictures. Finally, the folks
in Tower Records caught  on and put cardboard up over the windows (bummer! we
hadn't had a clear shot at  pictures yet!!), so we were left to wait and wonder.
After a little over 4 1/2 hours of  waiting -- and dealing with numbing hands
and feet -- we were rewarded with a  spin through the revolving door that put us
in the same room with Kate. We all had  to queue around a set of racks that had
been strategically placed so as to avoid  people stampeding up to Kate, so it
wasn't until I was about 40 feet from the front  table that I was able to see
anything...I leaned a bit to the left and...there she was,  her face peeping
between the queue of people and a huge vase of red roses that  stood on one
corner of the table she was sitting at. At first, I almost cried; it didn't 
even seem *real* to be looking up there and *seeing* her. I mean, I was
awestruck. 
</P>
<P>For starters, she's lovely. I can still picture her clearly, with her dark
chestnut,  reddish-brown hair spilling down over her left shoulders as she bent
to sign another  autograph. Her eyes are amazing; they're brown, but a *light*
brown, almost  golden...and they can just as easily crinkle up at the corners
when she smiles, or  look *deep* into you. Her hands are small, and her right
one was very warm as I  shook it; it felt good in my cold one! And her
clothing...much humbler than I  expected somehow: an over-sized black leather
jacket over a black top, a navy blue  mini-skirt...slim legs clad in dark hose
and finally ending in a pair of black  cloggy-heeled shoes. 
</P>
<P>I noted this in the space of an instant; everything was a blur, pretty much.
But I  managed to tell her that meeting her was an incredible thrill and an
honor (now  *there's* an understatement for you!), and I told her that I had
been lucky enough  to have gotten an article published about her, and I told her
that I would be really  honored if she would sign my magazine. She smiled big
and said &quot;Oh thanks, that's  really nice of you to write about me...&quot;
And up came the pen. 
</P>
<P>&quot;To Deb with love, Kate Bush X&quot; appeared magically in Kate's
round, flowing  hand in the lower right-hand corner of the magazine cover, and I
barely had time to  thank her sincerely before I was whisked away by one of the
half-dozen bodyguards  or whatever they were who were hovering like vultures
around the table. I was  unceremoniously ushered out to the other side of a rope
barrier, but I barely  noticed. I had just lived through a dream.... 
</P>
<P>Anyway, still moving like I was in a fog, clutching my magazine, I went up
to the  upper level of the store, where folks like myself could admire her...if
from a-far. I  saw one guy there who was leaning on his arm, just sort of
looking down at her, and  I said, &quot; I can't believe I just met her. She's
such a lovely person...&quot; To which the  guy answered dreamily, his chin
still propped in his hand, &quot;She's a goddess.&quot; Under  any other
circumstances, it would have been funny, how he said that in that moony  sort of
voice, but judging by the atmosphere of the store, I'd say that summed the 
whole thing up pretty well. 
</P>
<P>Well, during the twenty-some minutes that I remained in the store after she 
signed my magazine, I casually went up and down the staircase that passed right 
next to where she was sitting, and just *looked* at her for as long as I dared
before  the guards inevitably shooed me away and told us to &quot;keep the aisle
clear.&quot; As  amazing as she is, folks, she's also so *normal* somehow, and I
watched and noted  the little things about her: the way she sat, poised perkily
on the very front of the  metal folding chair; the way she fiddled with the big
marking pen between  signatures (she must have been dying for a cigarette); the
way she swept her hair  back away from that amazing, shining face (indeed, she
glowed); the soft pout of her  lips as she sipped Coke from an ordinary white
styrofoam cup. 
</P>
<P>But you get the point. It was a day I won't ever forget...literally hours of
travel  and waiting in line in the cold and noise to spend about 30 seconds with
Kate. And  would I ever do it again? 
</P>
<P>It was one of those &quot;moments of pleasure&quot; Kate sings about on The
Red Shoes .  You *bet* I'd do it all again. 
</P>
<P>But that's enough for now. So, until next time, all the best to all of
you...it's good  to be home! 
</P>

</P>
<P>Well James, 
</P>
<P>Yes, I have had the briefest, surrealest, heart-racing, fan-like sort of
contact with  Kate. 
</P>
<P>December 1993, Tower Records, New York City. Five hours waiting in the
chill,  quaking as the buzz moved through the line that *she* had arrived.
Harassing and  delighting my co-fans by whipping out a tape recorder and getting
their  on-the-scene thoughts about KateFandom and being there for the big
approaching  moment. Getting inside the store, seeing the videos playing, the
Red Shoes backdrop,  just the top of the brunette head. And then, her in sight.
Really her! *HER*, for  godsakes!!! This woman who, unknown to her, was one of
my closest friends  through adolescense. I held tight clenched hands with a
white-faced woman who'd  been a stranger hours before, as we moved to the front
of the line, just barely able  to make out the tiny familiar voice offering warm
words to dazed fans. It was  painful. To know this would all be over so
soon...what to say?? Remember to look  her in the eye. Remember to say something
somewhat intelligent. Remember to give  her the book you bought her. Remember to
touch her hand. 
</P>
<P>My turn!!!!
