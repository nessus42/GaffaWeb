</P>
<P>-------------------------------
</P>
<P>The Aspel Kate Bush Interview 
</P>
<P>-------------------------------
</P>
<P>Introduction 
</P>
<P>Michael Aspel introduces Victoria Wood, a British Comedienne who, as one of 
her characters, wears a raincoat and a beret (it is relevant later!). She is
also well  known for her comedy songs. They chat, he then introduces KaTe. 
</P>
<P>MA: It is time for some more company you see, and taking over the warm seat
from  the Wood bottie is a singer whose first record in 1978 astonished
listeners with  it's originality, and her own extraordinary style made her an
instant favourite  with T.V. impersonators. She is in the habit of vanishing
from time to time but  the Garbo of pop has emerged from the shadows. Welcome,
to Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>--------
</P>
<P>Applause 
</P>
<P>--------
</P>
<P>MA: Kate, I've not seen you for a while but when we first met you were still
a  teenager and then you got this Garbo label. Did you shun publicity and the 
spotlight deliberately? 
</P>
<P>KB: Erm, I think... On some levels, yes I did, but the main thing was I
wanted to  spend a lot more time working rather than spending a lot of time
promoting the  work, it all seems to be, becoming more promotion than the work I
was doing. 
</P>
<P>MA: So you decided work was more important, and have you now been now, 
beavering away in the potting shed for your next project? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes I have. We've been working for about two to three years on this
album  that's coming out, probably, middle of september... and it's taking a
long time,  it's very intense work really, being sort of shut away in a studio.

</P>
<P>MA: And this is The Red Shoes? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes, it's called The Red Shoes, yeah. 
</P>
<P>MA: Is it based on the film, the ballet film? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well it is very much connected with the film erm, I was lucky enough to
meet  Michael Powel, the director of The Red Shoes before he died and erm, he
was  such a sweet man, he was really sweet, I thought one of Britain's best
directors  and erm, he had a very strong effect on me, he was a very sweet man
and er,  he seems to have popped up in two or three of the songs that are on the
album. 
</P>
<P>MA: Was he dead by that time? 
</P>
<P>KB: By the time I was writing the songs, yeah. 
</P>
<P>MA: Posthumous recognition... 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes. 
</P>
<P>MA: 'Cos your first number one in '78 was inspired by a classic of course: 
Wuthering Heights, and we talked about that on a little program called 'Ask 
Aspel'... 
</P>
<P>Cut to old footage from 'Ask Aspel'. Part of the Wuthering Heights studio
video is  played. Cut to KaTe and Michael as they were then, in late '70 attire.
The  audience laugh. The interview went.. 
</P>
<P>MA: That was Kate Bush with her first hit. What was the inspiration for
Wuthering  Heights, simply the story? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well I hadn't read the book, that wasn't what inspired it erm, it was a 
television series they had years ago and I just managed to catch the very last 
few minutes where there was a hand coming through the window and blood 
everywhere and glass, and I just didn't know what was going on, and someone 
explained the story, and it was just hanging around for years, so I read the
book  in order to get the research right and, wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>MA: And then it just stuck in your mind all those years? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yeah, it seemed so strong. 
</P>
<P>Cut back to present interview. Applause 
</P>
<P>MA: Well... 
</P>
<P>KB: Your little brother and my little sister! 
</P>
<P>MA: Yeeees, I think it was very cruel of the audience to laugh at you like
that!  (They laugh.) You haven't changed at all. Are you sick of references to
that  number? 
</P>
<P>KB: I think I am now. I think at the time it was fine, it was a lot of fun
but, it was  fifteen years ago and I think erm, although its nice that people
er, remember it  and remember me, it is nice to feel that when you're working on
something,  that you considered to be a contemporary artist I suppose, rather
than going  back to something such a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>MA: Well it was so different, so astonishing. Victoria, what was your first
impression  of Kate, and that . 
</P>
<P>VW: Well, when I first saw it, and I was not at a very good time in my
career, I,  well, first I though she was mad, probably, a mad woman had slipped
onto the  airwaves, and then really, I thought that it was very, very good, but
I didn't  want to acknowledge that it was very good 'cos I was feeling very
insecure at  the time, and then I read a review by Clive James and he said 'This
woman is  either a genius or she's barking mad!'. (laughter) Well it probably
falls  somewhere between the two! 
</P>
<P>MA: Yes. (to Kate) Do you think that's a fair assessment? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes I do, I think I prob'ly am truly mad. 
</P>
<P>VW: That's allright! 
</P>
<P>MA: Oh that's nice (They all laugh). The theatrics of course were some... we
all, all  admired [How do you type a stutter?], now and, of course you've been a
pin-up  since you started doing this, er, this week we had a lot of letters in
the office  when they knew you were coming and (to Victoria), I can't imagine
what  your... (cut off) 
</P>
<P>VW: Did you have any letters about me? 
</P>
<P>MA: Not one oddly enough (Laughter) 
</P>
<P>KB: Have they been sending berets? 
</P>
<P>VW: Kate needs a beret 
</P>
<P>MA: Not berets no. (Talking about Kate again) Just nice letters. But do you
still enjoy  being a male fantasy. 
</P>
<P>KB: Erm, well I not sure if I've ever really enjoyed it! 
</P>
<P>MA: Horrible question 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes it is, its a horrible question 
</P>
<P>MA: (to Victoria jokingly) Do you enjoy being a male fantasy Victoria. 
</P>
<P>VW: I love it (Laughter) 
</P>
<P>MA: Fine. And so do I, so there we are! Now, you did just the one tour in
1979 and it  was a terrific extravaganza, and you did things that Madonna is
really just  coming round to thinking of isn't she, I mean, that telephonist's
headset. Was  that your idea as well. 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, as far as I know, it's the first time it was used live, erm, 'cos
I wanted to  be able to move around and dance and use my hands and erm, at the
time, the  engineer, the sound engineer that we were working with, came up with
the  idea of actually, adapting a coat hanger, he actually used a coat hanger,
and  opened it out and put it into the shape, so, that was the prototype. 
</P>
<P>VW: Madonna wouldn't use a coat hanger, that's probably the difference, she 
would insist it was done properly. 
</P>
<P>MA: Except for opening a car with probably. But, why haven't you repeated
all this  and done another tour? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, I did enjoy it. I think a lot people think I didn't actually have
fun, but I  did, it was great. But I think I found it erm, a bit overwhelming as
well as, it  being very hard work physically I think it was a bit rough for me
being so  exposed publicly, I found that a bit rough. And then I suppose I
wanted to just  retreat and work. 
</P>
<P>MA: It did all come with a rush didn't it of course at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>KB: Yeah, those first few years were very intense yeah. It was quite
overwhelming  really. 
</P>
<P>MA: What about the image of this vulnerable, pre-Raphaelite girl. Is this a
pure  invention? 
</P>
<P>KB: Erm, well I think er, I think everyone's vulnerable, on some level. But 
pre-Raphaelite, I suppose that's erm, probably a lot to do with Wuthering 
Heights, I think a lot of people... 
</P>
<P>MA: I mean... Do you live in a gothic mansion with candelabra 
</P>
<P>KB: Er, no, not at the moment, no 
</P>
<P>MA: You mean you have ! (they laugh) 
</P>
<P>KB: (Jokingly, I think) I'm planning to. (Giggles) 
</P>
<P>MA: Oh that's nice. (To Victoria) Can I ask, what's your style in decor
Victoria 
</P>
<P>VW: (jokingly) Oh it's like Kate's, I live next door to her, semi- detached.
 (laughter) 
</P>
<P>MA: Yeeees, right, (back to Kate) what is a typical day for you? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, I do spend a lot of time working so I s'pose erm, a typical day
would be,  being in the studio, you know, just working on erm, some ideas for a
song and  stuff. Pretty boring really. 
</P>
<P>VW: What do you do, sit at, at what? A keyboard or what? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yeah, yeah, a keyboard and we tend to put stuff straight onto tape so
I'm  actually working onto tape and then I'll play the tape back, and, you know,
 work to the stuff that's on there so... 
</P>
<P>MA: What about lyrics, 'cos, I'll ask you both about lyrics. (to Kate)
Your's are very  passionate and provocative erm, do you get inspiration,
anywhere? 
</P>
<P>KB: Erm, I think it is illusive stuff, but I think really the biggest
inspiration is  people, I think, people are just so inspiring, they're
fascinating and wonderful  and, I think, you know, that nearly every idea that a
person has had has  probably at some point, come from another person. 
</P>
<P>VW: (To Victoria, jokingly) And I can't think of you giving a different
reply, to all  that. 
</P>
<P>VW: No, I'm not going to, no. I'll going to give the same reply. (laughter) 
</P>
<P>MA: Really? 
</P>
<P>VW: Absolutely! (pauses) Errm, things do come from people, what else is
there  really, if you're going to talk about any sort of human relationship:
comedy, or  whatever it has, it has to be based in life, so it has to be based
on people. 
</P>
<P>MA: (To Victoria) But, do you always do the housework first, and put off
writing -  I've read you do that. 
</P>
<P>VW: I don't, no, I don't put off , I mean, I do, I do you know, I do, deal
with poo,  first. That's always the priority with babies. 
</P>
<P>MA: (jokingly) A baby poo, Kate, you understand. 
</P>
<P>VW: Do the poo, and then do the writing. I do like Kate, in an office, all
day, just  doing, you know, just trying stuff out. 
</P>
<P>MA: I do it the other way round, I write and then have a poo. (Big laugh).
I'm sorry  about that, its time for a... (cut off) 
</P>
<P>VW: (jokingly) That's why you're not a male fantasy, if a might say so! 
</P>
<P>MA: We're going to have a break now, err, Kate will be singing for her warm
glass  of white wine later, but in a few moments we will have Lenny Henry. 
</P>
<P>--------
</P>
<P>Applause 
</P>
<P>--------
</P>
<P>Fade to commercials 
</P>
<P>When the next half of the show resumes, Lenny Henry joins the party. His 
interview commences, with many additions from Victoria. Kate meanwhile sits  and
listens, smiling and laughing occasionaly. Every so often she is brought into 
the conversation... 
</P>
<P>On the subject of Funk... 
</P>
<P>MA: Kate, do you enjoy Funk? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yeah, very much, yeah 
</P>
<P>MA: I mean, I didn't know how to phrase that question but I'm glad I asked
it.  (Kate giggles) 
</P>
<P>They (everyone except Kate) are talking about the '70s, and how crap the
clothes  were, Lenny is leading the conversation ... 
</P>
<P>MA: what about you Kate, you know, you're very simply dressed now, but
you...  (cut off) 
</P>
<P>LH: (Sarcastically) Gorgeously dressed I think you'll find, Michael. 
</P>
<P>MA: Simple elegance, that's what I was groping for (laughter). So what about
the  seventies stuff, do you go for that? 
</P>
<P>KB: No, I agree with Lenny, I mean, why go back to it when it was so awful
the first  time? 
</P>
<P>LH: Yeah it was, a lot a people say the '70s was the decade that taste
forgot, but I  think we had taste... but it was just shite! (Big laugh and
applause) 
</P>
<P>This conversation moves to talk of Lenny's musical career... 
</P>
<P>MA: To bring it up to date, I mean, as an expert Kate, you think he's got
what it  takes don't you, as a singer? 
</P>
<P>KB: I think Lenny's a really good singer - he's done some singing on the new
 album, it's really good. 
</P>
<P>MA: Yes, (to Lenny) you are on Kate's new album. 
</P>
<P>LH: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>MA: Doing what? 
</P>
<P>LH: Singing (laughter). (Sarcastically) My elephant impression Michael. (He
does an  elephant impression!). (loads of laughter) It's a biggy! 
</P>
<P>MA: I thought you might have had the odd solo in the middle of it. 
</P>
<P>LH: No, I get to sing a bit, and it er, was very exciting. Kate was
incredibly patient,  and made egg sandwiches (laughter), saying (Cockney accent)
'Go on son, give  it some'! (more laughter) So I did! 
</P>
<P>At the end of the show... 
</P>
<P>MA: (Interrupts Lenny) Well, I've just been told, miss Bush, that they are
going to  be ready for your song, so erm, thank you very much for being with us
and  perhaps you'd like to (cut off)... 
</P>
<P>KB: Thank you 
</P>
<P>MA: (continues) ...prepare your young body. 
</P>
<P>MA: (says goodbye to Victoria, Lenny and us) And here is Kate Bush with some
 'Moments of Pleasure.

<P>I have just got back from the London Weekend Television Studios, where with 
Dave and Krys we were in the audience for &quot;Aspel and Co.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I'm knackered, but I just wanted to share with you my first reactions. Think
of  &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; and step up the emotional power by a factor of
ten. This song  is emotion incarnate. It is power incarnate. It is indeed a roll
call of those people  Kate has loved and lost. If this is a pointer to the
album, then we shall be  overwhelmed.

<P>Date: Mon, 21 Jun 93 10:40:26 BST <BR> From: nbc@inf.rl.ac.uk <BR>
Subject: Moments of Pleasure - first impressions 
</P>
<P>Just a few initial thoughts on the Aspel &amp; Co. appearance. The interview
itself did  not shed much new light (and other kind soles have already posted
transcriptions)  but it was interesting to discover that it was actually meeting
Michael Powell that  inspired Kate as much as the film itself. 
</P>
<P>During the group interview sections of the programme I felt that Kate was a
bit  overwhelmed by being surrounded by Leeny Henry and Victoria Wood who can 
both talk the hind legs of a donkey. Aspel tried to get her back into the
conversation  but without much success. 
</P>
<P>As for the song well my opinion is that if it is indicative of the album as
a whole  then it means The Sensual World Part II. The song Moments of Pleasure
reminded  be very much of a cross between This Woman's Work and Reaching Out but
it may  be that the orchestration on the track on the TV show was not the album
version.  Besides the strings and piano there were some seagull noises!
Lyrically the song was  clearly very emotional and powerful (reflecting the
subject matter that Peter  described last week) with some fascinating insights
into Kate's personal world.  Examples such as an old saying her mother used to
tell her (&quot;an old sock always  finds an old shoe) and that Al Murphy was
known to her as Smurf. There were  enough rhythmic changes in the song to give
Kate's vocal range a good working out  and she sounded on good form. 
</P>
<P>I think we are in for an even more personal album then the TSW - which is 
perhaps inevitable after Kate's loss of her mother and others close to her. It
will be  very interesting to discover what kinds of songs will be chosen as
singles and the  album itself will I am sure be full of surprises.

</P>
<P>First impressions: a slow ballad with piano and great strings arrangement. I
felt  there was a drum track missing somewhere, but maybe thats just me 8-) Not
awfully  original, musically, but emotionally powerful. Very sentimental lyrics
- references to  Ma, Al Murphy (&quot;Smurf&quot;), Bill Duffield, &quot;Teddy
at Abbey Road&quot; (who?) etc.  Reminiscent of Tori Amos, but without so much
histrionics 8-) 
</P>
<P>As promised, we've made a couple of audio files from a cassette dub of
Evan's  video recording of the Aspel show and I've just put them up for anon FTP
from  ftp.epcc.ed.ac.uk in pub/local/audio/kate. At the moment we have two 
Sun/NeXT-format 8kHz 8-bit mono u-law files: &quot;moments3.au&quot; is 1.4Mb
(to fit on an  HD floppy) and comprises the first 3 mins; &quot;moments5.au&quot;
is 2.5Mb and has the full  5m20s song. Might be one or two jumps due to disk
thrashes while we were  recording it on our Indigo, but sounds reasonable to me.
If anybody wants 16-bit  AIFC format, we have that too, but they're twice as big
and we're running short of  disk... 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Flump for the transcription - my typing just isn't up to it... 
</P>
<P>KaTe looked great; blue-grey trouser suit, beige blouse. Slimmed down a bit
since  &quot;Rocket Man&quot;. Seemed a little nervous. 
</P>
<P>Can't wait to hear Lenny Henry on the album...8-)

<P>&gt; Hey there morning (?)

<P>&quot;Hey there, Mother&quot;, I think.

<P>&gt;The case [outjoys] the wine [of judgement? endures?] 
</P>
<P>It almost sounds to me like the name George, like &quot;The case of George
Norwide,&quot;  like maybe there's same court case that's been in the news and
it's not really  something funny but she still laughs at it. 
</P>
<P>Does the name &quot;George Norwide&quot; ring a bell with anyone?

Mapes) <BR> Subject: This wonderful song... 
</P>
<P>...is beautiful, simple, and moving. &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; will
take it's place  alongside &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; and &quot;Reaching Out&quot;
in my heart. This song is from  one of the many, *many* Kates I know and love. 
</P>
<P>From the beauty and power of &quot;Reaching Out&quot; to the awesome
magnificence of  &quot;Breathing&quot; to the simple vulnerability of &quot;In
Search of Peter Pan&quot; to the terrible  anger of &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;
to the sly comedy of &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; to the  passionate sexuality
of &quot;Feel It&quot; to the passionate sensuality of &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
 to the cinematic brilliance of &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; to the spooky
terror of  &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; to the confusion and yearning of &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; to the  powerful strength of &quot;Not This Time&quot; to the
pure love of homeland in &quot;Oh England  My Lionheart&quot; to the tension of &quot;Pull
Out the Pin&quot; to the comical frustration of  &quot;Ran-Tan Waltz&quot; to
the unaffected cheerfulness of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; to the searching  chaos
of &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; to the carefree silliness of &quot;Kite&quot; to
the intrigue and  larceny of &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; to the genuine gift
of &quot;Under the Ivy&quot; to frightful  horror of &quot;Waking the Witch&quot;
to the lazy vacation of &quot;Warm and Soothing&quot; to the  ghostly pining of &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; to the exotic eccentricity of &quot;Egypt&quot; to  vengeful
violence of &quot;The Wedding List&quot; to the sardonic sanctuary of &quot;Leave
It  Open&quot; to the reluctant curiousity of &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; to the
worldly seduction of &quot;In  the Warm Room&quot; to the graceful elegance of &quot;Delius&quot;
to the cool deception of  &quot;Babooshka&quot; to the puzzling labyrinth of &quot;Suspended
In Gaffa&quot; to the serene trust of  &quot;The Fog&quot; to the precarious
honesty of &quot;Love and Anger&quot; to the extraordinary and alien  &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; and on and on and on and on. 
</P>
<P>All these songs and more came from the Kate *I* know and love. The pensive 
Kate. The private Kate. The bizarre Kate. The insecure Kate. The bold Kate. The 
flashy Kate. The sexy Kate. The motherly Kate. The loyal Kate. The loving Kate.
The  sad Kate. The happy Kate. The serious Kate. The lazy Kate. The hardworking
Kate.  The smart Kate. The brilliant Kate. The human Kate. The
how-did-she-*do*-that  Kate. The peaceful Kate. The overwhelmed Kate. The
creative Kate. The morbid  Kate. The fibbing Kate. The Cathy Kate. The public
Kate. The Kate nobody knows.  The Kate everybody knows. Kate the artist. Kate
the musician. Kate the lyricist. Kate  the poet. Kate the experimentor. Kate the
storyteller. Kate the trouper. Kate the  survivor. The innocent Kate. The
cynical Kate. The beautiful Kate. The bad-hair-day  Kate. The Kate who
introduced a song of hers by saying &quot;yeah, here it is&quot; and the  Kate
who presented her songs as a 3-act &quot;play&quot; and the Kate who thinks
we're all  mad and the Kate who repeats herself endlessly and the Kate who would
really  rather not say anything at all about her songs and the Kate who loves
her family and  friends and Del and unusual musical instruments and her garden
and her cats and  her privacy. Lots and lots of Kates. The Kate who gave us 6
albums and a bunch of  b-sides and remixes and who is about to give us another
album. 
</P>
<P>So many Kates. So little time... 
</P>
<P>I already love &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; and it has been floating
through my brain  all day long. I played it on my radio show last night. 
</P>
<P>She really *IS* 
</P>
<P>Vickie 
</P>
<P>&quot;How I'm moved, how you move me, with your beauty's potency&quot; KB
