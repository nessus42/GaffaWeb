<P>To my mind, this song [BSL] falls squarely into context of &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot; if  placed in the mouth of Moira Shearer's character--her husband
and the head of the  ballet company both seduce her with these promises, but
they are, in fact, tearing  her to pieces. 
</P>
<P>(For those who haven't seen the film, it was the first film to speak poorly
of the  discipline and dedication required by ballet. The three central
characters are a young  ballerina, the head of a premiere ballet company and a
young composer. The ballet  company makes a bold move in commissioning a new
ballet of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; from  this unknown composer, and it is to be
danced by the unkown ballerina. The story  of the ballet is this: a young girl
wants more than anything to dance. A demonic  shoemaker seduces her into trying
on a pair of enchanted red shoes, and she begins  to dance. She can't stop. She
dances around the world, through beauty and terror.  In the end, she comes back
home, where she dies of exhaustion, and the shoemaker  puts the red shoes back
on display for someone else to buy--a parallel of the film's  story. The
ballerina falls in love with the composer. The head of the ballet company  (who
is secretly in love with her) makes her choose between her love for the dance 
and her love for the composer. She retires and marries the composer. When she 
returns for an revival of The Red Shoes, the head of the company tries to
convince  her to come out of retirement and rejoin the troupe. Her husband
enters, and she is  faced with the ultimate conflict: give her entire life to
her husband (for he demands  nothing less), or give her entire life to the
dance. Rather than make the choice, she  throws herself in front of a train.
That evening, the orchestra plays the score while a  spotlight shines on her red
toe shoes. Very melodramatic, indeed.)

<P>IED doubts that there is any clear connection between Eat the Music and the 
movie The Red Shoes. There is certainly a close connection, however, between Eat
 the Music and The Song of Solomon. Both the imagery and the theme are similar.</P>
<P>Btw, The Red Shoes (movie, 1947) begins and ends with stylized images of 
candlesticks -- in the first the candle-flame is tall and bright, in the second,
a single  candle sputters in its candlestick. </P>
<P>N.B. Kate's choice of Candle in the Wind, her use of the candle as a symbol
for  the departed Alan Murphy in the Rocket Man video, and the inclusion of
candles on  the piano, next to a pair of red shoes, during her performance of
Moments of  Pleasure on the Aspel show last June. The use of the image as a
symbol for death --  or more accurately, as a memorial for the dead -- is
consistent in all of these cases. </P>

&lt;fmcquarr@upei.ca&gt; <BR> Subject: The *first* Red Shoes </P>
<P>This weekend my husband rented The Red Shoes - the original film by Michael 
Powell (he hates TRS the record so I think he was trying to restore his
faith...) </P>
<P>I would HIGHLY recommend seeing it if your local video store has it. It's
very  depressing but the cinematography is excellent and the dancing is
wonderful. While  TRS the record is not based *too* closely on it, there are a
lot of themes that are  touched on in both - manipulation of talented women by
exploitative men, devotion  to art at the expense of personal life, getting into
something that appears to be  wonderful but turns out to be nightmarish.....
</P>
<P>The centerpiece of the film is The Ballet of the Red Shoes, which is an
amazing  piece of work - quite dreamlike and scary and psychedelic. </P>
<P>Well worth an evening of your time. </P>
<P>Cheers, Fiona </P>

Miller &amp; Kris Lyons) <BR> Subject: Re: Red Shoes </P>
<P>I've seen the Red Shoes a couple times and bits and pieces of it more often.
I  think it is a wonderful, beautiful movie. Here is what influmential American
Film  critic Pauline Kael had to say about it: 
</P>
<P>The most &quot;imaginative&quot; and elaborate backstage musical ever
filmed, and many  have called it great. The film contains a 14-minute ballet,
also called &quot;The Red  Shoes&quot;, based on a Hans Christian Andersen story
about a wicked shoemaker who  sells an enchanted pair of slippers to a young
girl. Delighted at first with the slippers  in which she dances joyously, she
discovers that the slippers will not let her stop  dancing and the bewitched,
exhausted girl dies. The film's story is, of course, the  same story, spelled
out in more complicated terms, with the shoemaker of the ballet  (Lonide
Massine) replaced by the megalomaniac ballet impresario (Anton  Walbrook). The
exquisite young Moira Shearer is the ballerina; the cast includes  Marius Goring
as the young composer, Robert Helpmann, Albert Basserman,  Ludmilla Tcherina,
and Esmond Knight. Blubbery and self-conscious, but it affects  some people
passionately, and it's undeniably some kind of classic. Written,  produced, and
directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, master  purveyors of high
kitsch. Choreography by Helpmann; music by Brian Easdale;  conducted by Sir
Thomas Beecham.
