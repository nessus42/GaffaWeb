      <P> A while ago two collections have been made available, both of which
        are much more interesting then anything published. They can be ftped
        from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net">ftp.uu.net</A>, as usual. See section
        <A HREF="faq_tshirts.html">6</A> for details. There are also disk versions
        of these floating around somewhere (a set in MS-DOS format, and a set in
        Macintosh format). Only requirement to get them is a) to find them and
        b) to agree to send them to the next one requesting them. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P> The Garden is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference material on
        Kate, available in
        <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden/</A>
        , including a detailed chronology of her life and career (much more
        complete then anything available anywhere else) [GARDEN01]. Also, a
        listing of all known Kate recordings, videography (which includes both
        official videos and the television appearances), and an extensive list
        of fan magazines [GARDEN02]. </P>
      
      <P> ALL of the lyrics (including background voices) to ALL of Kate's
        known songs (including unreleased songs) [GARDEN04]. All of John's and
        Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and articles for the Kate Bush Club
        Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles for the KBC [GARDEN05, GARDEN06].
        Also included are about sixty interviews [GARDEN07 through GARDEN10].

    <P> <STRONG>&quot;Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words&quot;</STRONG>
    </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P> This is Ron Hill (the [ex-]keeper of this monthly post)'s compilation
        of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and subject order,
        forming the closest we may ever see to a full-fledged Kate
        autobiography. It is available in regular text format, or in Wordperfect
        4.2 format, which makes use of Wordperfect's underlining, bolding, and
        italicizing, ability, and contains an extensive index. It is also
        available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0 versions. (Eventually
        the extra unedited interviews will be added into The Garden). </P>
      
      <P> There are also a series of <STRONG>Cloudbusting</STRONG> GIF
        (picture) files, which are located in
        <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbusting/gif/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbusting/gif/</A>
        [APPARENTLY THESE ARE TRASHED]. A title page [CTITLE.GIF and a larger
        version, CTITLEB.GIF], a title page for Part II [CSTORY.GIF] and part
        III [CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen [CREDITS.GIF], and a pic of 3 inch
        disk label [CLABEfaq_l2.gif, and a b&amp;w version CLABELBW.GIF]. There
        are also pictures for most of the albums which show the picture of Kate
        from the album cover next to a listing of songs [titles begin with &quot;O&quot;].
        There are also &quot;alternative&quot; pics for some of the albums,
        which show pictures SIMILAR to but not identical to the album covers
        [files begin with &quot;A&quot;]. There are also &quot;full&quot;
        pictures for some of the albums [titles begin with &quot;F&quot;], which
        are the raw, uncropped, pictures. </P>
