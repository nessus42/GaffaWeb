     <strong>What is a <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Food_and_Eating/Spam/">spam</a>?</strong>

<p>
     Spamming is the posting of <a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/Roadmap/MAP09.html">massive numbers of duplicate articles</a> on
     Usenet.  Spams don't have to be <a href="http://com.primenet.com/spamking/">commercial</a>, they don't even have to be
     unrelated to the discussion topic... but they usually are.  A commercial
     posting that's not really on topic probably is posted to a big number of
     other newsgroups/mailing lists too, so any not Kate-related commercial
     posting is probably a spam.

<p>
     Someone selling a few Kate Bush records is definitely not a spam.  A
     professional record dealer selling more than a few records is also not a
     spam.  (Nevertheless both should avoid posting long sales list to the
     group.  Instead post an announcement that you've got stuff to sell and
     will send the list to interested people.)).  Remember that even if you
     don't like commercial postings at all, some of us like those that are
     Kate-related.

<p>
    A 'student' praising magazine subscriptions most definitely is a spam.

<p>
     Unfortunately, spamming is not illegal.  And if it was illegal in one
     country it doesn't have to be illegal world-wide.

<p>     
     <strong>What to do about spam postings?</strong>


<ol>

<li>  Write to the relevant postmasters (politely, they're likely to have
        hundreds if not thousands of similar mails), possibly including the
        complete spam posting including *all* headers (esp. "Received:" lines).
        If writing to postmaster@spammers.site doesn't help, you can check
        the chain of postmasters in the "Received:" headers, or you can find
        out the domain servers of the spammer's site by entering the spammer's
        domain (e.g. "spammer.com") on http://www.internic.net/wp/whois.html
        and complain at the "postmaster" at that site (this assumes the
        spammer's domain isn't completely faked).
<li>  Do not mailbomb the originator.  Most of the times, the addresses
        are faked, that is, the only one not having trouble with the mail
        bomb is the spammer himself.
<li>  Do not write to love-hounds/rec.music.gaffa, we all know it as well as you do.
<li>  With repeated spams, check out with the maintainers of our moderator
         software.  <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">They might be able to do
         something about it.</a>
<li>   Most important: do not call/write/ask/whatever the originator about
         whatever he wants to offer to you.  That's what he wants to achieve,
         and that might be what's paying him (addresses = information = money).
         You can complain if you know who he is, but please: do not play into
          his hands.
</ol>

<p>   See also the net-abuse newsgroups (<a href="news:news.admin.net-abuse.misc">
news.admin.net-abuse.misc</a> etc.). Lots of the information here is from [<a href="faq_7.html#DB">DB</a>].


     P.S.: to be a bit more PC: spammers could be female as well...

     On to a more friendly subject:
