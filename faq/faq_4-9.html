<p>
     A while ago two collections have been made available, both of which are
     much more interesting then anything published.  They can be ftped from
     <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net">ftp.uu.net</a>, as usual.  See section <a href="faq_6-1.html">6</a> for 
details.  There are also disk
     versions of these floating around somewhere (a set in MS-DOS format, and
     a set in Macintosh format).  Only requirement to get them is a) to find
     them and b) to agree to send them to the next one requesting them.

<blockquote>

<p>
        The Garden is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference material on
        Kate, available in <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden/</a> ,
        including a detailed chronology of her life and career (much more
        complete then anything available anywhere else) [GARDEN01].  Also, a
        listing of all known Kate recordings, videography (which includes both
        official videos and the television appearances), and an extensive list
        of fan magazines [GARDEN02]. 

 
<p>
       ALL of the lyrics (including background
        voices) to ALL of Kate's known songs (including unreleased songs)
        [GARDEN04].  All of John's and Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and
        articles for the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles
        for the KBC [GARDEN05, GARDEN06].  Also included are about sixty
        interviews [GARDEN07 through GARDEN10].

     <strong>&quot;Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words&quot;</strong>


<blockquote>

<p>
        This is Ron Hill (the [ex-]keeper of this monthly post)'s compilation
        of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and subject order,
        forming the closest we may ever see to a full-fledged Kate
        autobiography.  It is available in regular text format, or in
        Wordperfect 4.2 format, which makes use of Wordperfect's underlining,
        bolding, and italicizing, ability, and contains an extensive index.
        It is also available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0
        versions.  (Eventually the extra unedited interviews will be added
        into The Garden).


<p>
        There are also a series of <strong>Cloudbusting</strong> GIF (picture) files, which are
        located in <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbusting/gif/">
ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbusting/gif/</a>
        [APPARENTLY THESE ARE TRASHED].  A title page [CTITLE.GIF and a larger
        version, CTITLEB.GIF], a title page for Part II [CSTORY.GIF] and part
        III [CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen [CREDITS.GIF], and a pic of 3 inch
        disk label [CLABEfaq_l2.gif, and a b&amp;w version CLABELBW.GIF].  There are
        also pictures for most of the albums which show the picture of Kate
        from the album cover next to a listing of songs [titles begin with
        &quot;O&quot;].  There are also &quot;alternative&quot; pics for some of the albums, 
which
        show pictures SIMILAR to but not identical to the album covers [files
        begin with &quot;A&quot;].  There are also &quot;full&quot; pictures for some of the 
albums
        [titles begin with &quot;F&quot;], which are the raw, uncropped, pictures.
