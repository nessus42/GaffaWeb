		<P> This area is divided into the different albums as well as a section
		  for the home demo recordings and for miscellaneous tracks. </P> 
		<P> The lyrics for all of the songs can be found on both gaffa relevant
		  ftp sites: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net">ftp.uu.net</A> and
		  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uwp.edu">ftp.uwp.edu</A>. They are too long to be cited
		  here. The file </P>

		  </P> 
		<P> contains all lyrics up to The Sensual World and its singles,
		  including all non-official songs and all non-official parts of the lyrics
		  (backing vocals, spoken passages etc.) </P> 
		<P>Lyrics can also be found on the web at various sites, including: </P> 
		<P><A HREF="../sensual/index.html">http://www.gaffa.org/sensual/</A> </P>
		
		<P> Right now there are areas where I haven't found the time to say
		  something. Feel free to contribute! </P> 
		<P> More information about most of the songs can be found in the
		  archives, so sometimes I will only give a pointer to a long story if it is too
		  long to be cited here in full. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P> Kate has never commented on any bootleg material, and so she hasn't
		  said anything about these as bootlegs. But she has said plenty of things about
		  these recordings - generally to the effect that there are about 200 or more of
		  them (20-30 have been 'released' on bootlegs) and that they should remain
		  buried and will never re-record any of them. The sound quality of all of them
		  reminds of a boombox set to 'record' in a living room. Nevertheless most fans
		  do LOVE these songs and would almost kill to hear the rest. The Experience
		  Music Project reportedly has a white tape box as part of an exhibit labeled
		  &quot;Cathy Bush&quot;. Paul Allen is reportedly a Kate fan.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
