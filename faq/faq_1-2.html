<blockquote>

     <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">Love-Hounds</a> is the mailing list 
version of <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</a> for those
     people who do not have usenet access.  This means that anyone with the
     ability to send and receive mail can take part.  |&gt;oug /\lan, founder
     of <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">Love-Hounds</a>, did only later 
provoke the people on <a href="news:rec.music.misc">rec.music.misc</a>
     to let him create <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</a>.  Together, the 
mailing list and r.m.g.
     form an informal fan club called &quot;<a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">
Love-Hounds</a>.&quot;


<p>
     To post something to both, the <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">mailing 
list</a> and the <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">newsgroup</a>, you best
     send an email to

<p>
        love-hounds@gryphon.com


<p>
     If you think you want to be on the safe side you might want to subscribe
     to the <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">mailing list</a> as well as to the 
<a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">newsgroup</a>, because minor problems
     with the software might cause some messages lost on one of the sides.
     (This hasn't happened for a long while now.)


<p>
Love-Hounds comes in two flavors: digest and bounce.  If you subscribe to
the digest version, you will receive a digest once a day containing all
messages sent to the list since the last digest.  If you subscribe to the
bounce version you will receive each individual message as it is sent.
You can subscribe or unsubscribe to either version of the list at will.
To do so send mail to <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">majordomo@gryphon.com</a> containing one or more of the
following commands:
</p>

<p>
	subscribe love-hounds-bounce<br>
	subscribe love-hounds-digest<br>
<p>
	unsubscribe love-hounds-bounce<br>
	unsubscribe love-hounds-digest<br>
</p>

<p>
You can also send a message containing the command &quot;help&quot; for more information.
</p>

<p>
You can retrieve a copy of the Love-Hounds Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
document by sending a message to <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">majordomo@gryphon.com</a> containing the following
text (note upper case):
</p>

<p>
	get love-hounds-digest FAQ
</p>

<p>
To send a message to the list, address it to love-hounds@gryphon.com.
</p>

<p>
The Love-Hounds archives and other material of interest (song lyrics,
interviews, etc.) can be found on the Internet at
</p>

<p>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa</a>
</p>

<p>
If you have access to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/News/Usenet/">USENET</a>, you may prefer to read the newsgroup
<a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</a> rather than the mailing list.  The contents of both the
newsgroup and mailing list are identical.
</p>


<p>
     You can also subscribe by using other networks (<a 
href="http://www.access.digex.net/%7Emcgatney/">America Online</a>,
     <a href="news:alt.online-service.prodigy">Prodigy</a>, etc.).  You might have to find out 
how to reach the Internet
     using your carrier; for example, on <a href="news:alt.online-service.compuserve">
Compuserve</a> this works by adding
     &quot;&gt;INTERNET:&quot; in front of the addresses.  Most of these services now have
     direct access to the usenet newsgroups, so <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</a> should be
     available directly.


<p>
     <a href="http://members.aol.com/rdteditor/rdt.htm">Richard Caldwell</a>, a fellow Love-Hound, gives you access via the Big Sky
     BBS, 24 hours a day at 614-864-1198 (up to 14.4k baud).  Only charge
     is your phone bill for a long distance call.


<p>
     Another Kate-related BBS is The Electronic Cafe at
     1-805-399-3636.  A Kate-related BBS in Canada called Night Scented
     Stock, run by the former editor of the fanzine Still Breathing.  It's
     unfortunately not connected to Love-Hounds, but may soon be.
     1-604-572-4733.
