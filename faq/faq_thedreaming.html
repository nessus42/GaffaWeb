		<P> The 'backwards' lyrics at the end of the song aren't really
		  backwards. They've been recorded backwards, but they are pretty much straight
		  forward and say &quot;we let the wierdness in&quot;. Kate listened to the phrase
		  backwards and tried to sing what she heard, which then was played backwards
		  again - resulting in a wierd sounding forward phrase. On the other hand, you
		  can hear something backwards as well: &quot;And they said they won't let me in&quot;
		  (this isn't official, while the forward phrase is - it was a long unanswered
		  quiz question in the KBC). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		Houdini:</STRONG> </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P> <A HREF="http://www.uelectric.com/houdini/houdini.html">Harry
		  Houdini</A> (born Erich Weiss) was an escapologist who managed to escape by
		  using a key that was passed to him by his wife Bess with a kiss she always gave
		  him before he was bound and drowned. (&quot;With a kiss, I'd pass the key.&quot;) Now
		  Houdini and his wife previously agreed on a secret code (&quot;Rosabel, believe!&quot;),
		  which he should use via a medium after his death to let her know about
		  after-life. At one point Bess was given the code by a &quot;psychic,&quot; but she later
		  found out that he obtained it from a former servant of Houdini's (it *was*
		  simply their favorite song, rather than some involved code.) So, it's easy to
		  see how the confusion has happened. </P> 
		<P> Bess *once* stated that a &quot;psychic&quot; had given her the code, then she
		  retracted that statement. As usually happens, the people who want to believe in
		  &quot;psychic phenomena&quot; accept want they want and disregard the rest. So the first
		  claim of contact is more widely reported than the true (but less romantic)
		  story. Kate's song is closer in the details to the Hollywood film starring Tony
		  Curtis than to the real events of Houdini's life and art. This is in no way
		  intended to disparage Kate's song, which concentrates on the *emotional*,
		  rather than the biographical aspects of Houdini and Bess' relationship. [some
		  of this by <A HREF="faq_credits.html#CW">CW</A>]</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
