		Happy Rhodes (her real name) is an independent singer/songwriter/musician from upstate New York, with 10 albums and 
		an astonishing vocal range. She's been described as having a voice that ranges from early Kate Bush highs 
		to David Bowie or Annie Lennox lows. In fact, a Happy Rhodes song has been floating around the file-sharing world for 
		years called "When The Rain Came Down" that's misidentified as being by Kate Bush and Annie Lennox. 
		If you'd like to hear 
		the song, <a href="http://wretchawry.com/happy/samples/HappyRhodes_Ecto15_WhenTheRainCameDown(CDbonustrack).mp3">here it is</a>. 
		Happy herself is a huge Kate Bush fan and learned how to sing by singing along to The Kick Inside.

      <P>The Kate Bush mailing list Love-Hounds/newsgroup rec.music.gaffa</a> was 
	  founded with the idea of being a newsgroup about &quot;Progressive Artists with
        emphasis on Kate Bush&quot; so discussions about other &quot;progressive artists&quot; 
		are generally encouraged. However, occasionally the talk about a different artist 
		grew to a point where it is appropriate to form a separate group. This is what 
		happened with <a HREF="http://www.auntiesocialmusic.com/">Happy</a>, whose song 
		&quot;<a HREF="http://www.ecto.org/lyrics/warpaint/feedthefire.html">Feed The Fire</a>&quot; 
		(from <a HREF="http://www.ecto.org/lyrics/warpaint/index.html">Warpaint</a>) was
        the most requested song on WXPN, a Philadelphia radio station. Happy Rhodes
        discussion now takes place on the mailing list founded by Jessica Koeppel in 1991 
		called <a HREF="http://www.ecto.org/">Ecto</a>.</p>

        includes many other female artists (including Kate Bush</A>), send a request to the Ecto
