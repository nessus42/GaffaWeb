      <P> The beginning (&quot;It's in the trees! It's coming!&quot;) is from
        the 1957 UK horror movie
        <A HREF="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?Night+of+the+Demon+%281957%29">&quot;Night
          of the Demon&quot;</A> (US title: &quot;Curse Of The Demon&quot;,
        original title: &quot;Casting The Runes&quot;), though Kate re-recorded
        the bit, because she couldn't get enough quality from the original. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><A HREF="bod.jpg"><IMG SRC="bod_th.gif" ALT="Cover of The Book of Dreams" HEIGHT="143" WIDTH="100"></A>
      </P>
      
      <P> This is based on Peter Reich's book &quot;A Book Of Dreams&quot; (you
        can see this book in the video, in
        <A HREF="http://web3.starwave.com/showbiz/memorybank/starbios/donaldsutherland/a.html">Donald
          Sutherland's</A> pocket). Peter writes about his experience in his
        youth, when <A HREF="http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Egoodman/orgone.html">Wilhelm
          Reich</A> (his father) got problems with the government due to his
        questionable actions as a scientist. Wilhelm got arrested and died while
        in prison, and this experience later made the then-9-years-old Peter
        write &quot;A Book Of Dreams&quot;. Wilhelm was arrested for refusing to
        appear at an arrangement hearing that resulted from a lawsuit by the
        <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/">American FDA </A> for selling his &quot;orgone
        energy accumulators&quot; across state lines. The FDA said it was
        quackery to sell these boxes made of aluminum and wood as therapeutic
        devices; Reich insisted it was serious science and refused to have
        anything to do with these &quot;spurious&quot; legal restrictions on his
        research and therapy. Of course, he was quite mad by then - this was
        nearly a decade after he claimed that <A HREF="http://www.acoreich.org/">orgone
          energy </A> was not simply the libidinal buildup that resulted from a
        lack of proper sexual release, but was also the substance out of which
        the whole universe was formed. Interestingly, several well-known people,
        including <A HREF="http://www.msu.edu/lecture/mailer.html">Norman
          Mailer</A>, had orgone accumulators. More about Wilhelm Reich can be
        found in the file
        <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich</A>
        or at the Wilhelm Reich homepage at
        <A HREF="http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Egoodman/orgone.html">http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Egoodman/orgone.html</A>.
        [part of this is from <A HREF="faq_7.html#JAC">JAC</A> (see credits
        section)] </P>
      
      <P> There is no such thing as a song called Cloudbursting (regard the
        spelling), and there is no remix of Cloudbusting called The
        Meteorological Mix, despite of what <A HREF="http://www.emirec.com/">EMI
          America</A> wants to tell us. EMI UK isn't really better, for the real
        spelling of what the world knows as the Organon Mix should have been
        Orgonon Mix (Orgonon was the name of Reich's home/center in Maine,
        <A HREF="http://www.mainelink.net/%7Epore/">Orgone energy</A> was
        Reich's subject of studies). [<A HREF="faq_7.html#IED">IED</A>] </P>
      
      <P> The song name comes from hunting clouds, not from breaking them, and
        the remix called Meteorological Mix is from The Big Sky. There are two
        remixes of Cloudbusting: The Orgonon Mix and the video version. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <STRONG>Hello Earth:</STRONG> </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P> At the end of &quot;Hello, Earth&quot; the German words are: &quot;Tiefer,
        tiefer, irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht&quot; This means: &quot;deeper,
        deeper, somewhere in the depth there is a light.&quot; They are not
        spoken by Kate, but by Gabi Zangerl, a friend of Kate. </P>
      
      <P> The choir part of this song was inspired by
        <A HREF="http://rte66.com/M/person-exact?Herzog%2C+Werner">Werner
          Herzog</A>'s film
        <A HREF="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?Nosferatu%3A+Phantom+der+Nacht+%281979%29">Nosferatu</A>
        that features a very similar chant. Recently it became known that the
        chant originates from Georgia, it's a traditional lyrical song from
        Kakheti-Kartli, the easternmost region of the (former Soviet) Republic
        of Georgia, the area around Tbilisi, the capital. </P>
      
      <P> The song is actually best transliterated as &quot;tsintsqaro&quot;
        (At the Spring, By the Source or At the Well), a boy meets girl love
        song. You might find this song, also spelled as Tshintsharo or Zinzgaro,
        on some CDs with traditional Georgian music (eg &quot;The Marvels of
        Polyphony in Sakartvelo&quot;, CD Ethnic Sound Series #17, Victor, Japan
        1987). [<A HREF="faq_7.html#W">W</A>, <A HREF="faq_7.html#CHB">CHB</A>]
