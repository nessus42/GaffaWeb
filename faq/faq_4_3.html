      <P> <STRONG>What is a <a HREF="http://www.spam.com/">spam</a>?</STRONG>
      </P>
      
      <P> Spamming is the posting of
        <A HREF="http://www.charm.net/~web/Internet/Protocols/Email/Spam.html">massive
          numbers of duplicate articles</A> on Usenet. Spams don't have to be
        <A HREF="http://com.primenet.com/spamking/">commercial</A>, they don't
        even have to be unrelated to the discussion topic... but they usually
        are. A commercial posting that's not really on topic probably is posted
        to a big number of other newsgroups/mailing lists too, so any not
        Kate-related commercial posting is probably a spam. </P>
      
      <P> Someone selling a few Kate Bush records is definitely not a spam. A
        professional record dealer selling more than a few records is also not a
        spam. (Nevertheless both should avoid posting long sales list to the
        group. Instead post an announcement that you've got stuff to sell and
        will send the list to interested people.)). Remember that even if you
        don't like commercial postings at all, some of us like those that are
        Kate-related. </P>
      
      <P> A 'student' praising magazine subscriptions most definitely is a
        spam. </P>
      
      <P> Unfortunately, spamming is not illegal. And if it was illegal in one
        country it doesn't have to be illegal world-wide. </P>
      
      <P> <STRONG>What to do about spam postings?</STRONG> </P>
      <OL>
        <LI> Write to the relevant postmasters (politely, they're likely to
          have hundreds if not thousands of similar mails), possibly including
          the complete spam posting including *all* headers (esp. &quot;Received:&quot;
          lines). If writing to postmaster@spammers.site doesn't help, you can
          check the chain of postmasters in the &quot;Received:&quot; headers,
          or you can find out the domain servers of the spammer's site by
          entering the spammer's domain (e.g. &quot;spammer.com&quot;) on
          http://www.internic.net/wp/whois.html and complain at the &quot;postmaster&quot;
          at that site (this assumes the spammer's domain isn't completely
          faked). </LI>
        <LI> Do not mailbomb the originator. Most of the times, the addresses
          are faked, that is, the only one not having trouble with the mail bomb
          is the spammer himself. </LI>
        <LI> Do not write to love-hounds/rec.music.gaffa, we all know it as
          well as you do. </LI>
        <LI> With repeated spams, check out with the maintainers of our
          moderator software. <A HREF="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">They might
            be able to do something about it.</A> </LI>
        <LI> Most important: do not call/write/ask/whatever the originator
          about whatever he wants to offer to you. That's what he wants to
          achieve, and that might be what's paying him (addresses = information
          = money). You can complain if you know who he is, but please: do not
          play into his hands. </LI>
      </OL>
      
      <P> See also the net-abuse newsgroups (<A HREF="news:news.admin.net-abuse.misc">news.admin.net-abuse.misc</A>
        etc.). Lots of the information here is from [<A HREF="faq_credits.html#DB">DB</A>].
        P.S.: to be a bit more PC: spammers could be female as well... On to a
        more friendly subject: </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
