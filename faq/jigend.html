      <P> Can't you see where memories are kept bright
        <BR> Tripping on the water like a laughing girl
        <BR> Time in her eyes is spawning past life
        <BR> One with the ocean and the woman unfurls
        <BR> Holding all the love that waits for you here
        <BR> Catch us now for I am your future
        <BR> A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land
        <BR> </P>
      
      <P> Come over here to where When lingers
        <BR> Waiting in this empty world
        <BR> Waiting for Then when the life spray cools
        <BR> For now does ride in on the curl of a wave
        <BR> And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools
        <BR> </P>  We are of the going water and the gone
      <BR> We are of water and the holy land of water
      <BR> And all that's to come runs in
      <BR> With the thrust on the strand
