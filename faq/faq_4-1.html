     Kate's first appearance in the public was a little tour through a few
     London <a href="http://www.londonmall.co.uk/pubguide/hserver.exe?pubguide+serve=_main">pubs</a> 
together with the so called KT (read: Katie) Bush Band.
     All of Kate's albums have the KT (originally <a 
href="http://www.trantex.fi/staff/heikkih/knights/portcull.htm">Knights Templar</a>) symbol
     hidden somewhere either on the cover or on the vinyl itself (see section
     <a href="faq_4-10.html">4.10</a>).  You might have to have original UK versions of the albums to 
find
     them.  The KT initials can <a href="ktad.jpg">also be seen</a> in the &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; video.

<p>
     The release of the <a href="faq_box.html">This Woman's Work boxed set</a> there appeared a new
     version of the KT symbol that includes the biological symbol for woman:

<p>
     Fans of Kate were saddened by the news of the passing of <a href="hannah.html">her mother</a> on
     Valentine's day, 1992.  (We don't know for what cause, sorry.)
