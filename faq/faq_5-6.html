     <strong>Hounds of Love:</strong>


<blockquote>

<p>
        The beginning (&quot;It's in the trees!  It's coming!&quot;) is from the 1957
        UK horror movie <a href="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?Night+of+the+Demon+%281957%29">
&quot;Night of the Demon&quot;</a> (US title: &quot;Curse Of The Demon&quot;,
        original title: &quot;Casting The Runes&quot;), though Kate re-recorded the bit,
        because she couldn't get enough quality from the original.

     <strong>Cloudbusting</strong>:


<blockquote>
<a href="bod.jpg"><img src="bod_th.gif" alt="Cover of The Book of Dreams" height="143" width="100"></a>
<p>
        This is based on Peter Reich's book &quot;A Book Of Dreams&quot; (you can see
        this book in the video, in <a 
href="http://web3.starwave.com/showbiz/memorybank/starbios/donaldsutherland/a.html">Donald 
Sutherland's</a> pocket).  Peter writes
        about his experience in his youth, when <a 
href="http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Egoodman/orgone.html">Wilhelm Reich</a> (his father)
        got problems with the government due to his questionable actions as a
        scientist.  Wilhelm got arrested and died while in prison, and this
        experience later made the then-9-years-old Peter write &quot;A Book Of
        Dreams&quot;.  Wilhelm was arrested for refusing to appear at an arrangement
        hearing that resulted from a lawsuit by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">American FDA
</a> for selling
        his &quot;orgone energy accumulators&quot; across state lines.  The FDA said it
        was quackery to sell these boxes made of aluminum and wood as
        therapeutic devices; Reich insisted it was serious science and refused
        to have anything to do with these &quot;spurious&quot; legal restrictions on his
        research and therapy.  Of course, he was quite mad by then - this was
        nearly a decade after he claimed that <a href="http://www.acoreich.org/">orgone energy
</a> was not simply the
        libidinal buildup that resulted from a lack of proper sexual release,
        but was also the substance out of which the whole universe was formed.
        Interestingly, several well-known people, including <a 
href="http://www.msu.edu/lecture/mailer.html">Norman Mailer</a>,
        had orgone accumulators.  More about Wilhelm Reich can be found in the
        file <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich">
ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich</a>
        or at the Wilhelm Reich homepage at <a 
href="http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Egoodman/orgone.html">
http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Egoodman/orgone.html</a>.

<p>
        There is no such thing as a song called Cloudbursting (regard the
        spelling), and there is no remix of Cloudbusting called The
        Meteorological Mix, despite of what <a href="http://www.emirec.com/">EMI America</a> 
wants to tell us.
        EMI UK isn't really better, for the real spelling of what the world
        knows as the Organon Mix should have been Orgonon Mix (Orgonon was
        the name of Reich's home/center in Maine, <a href="http://www.mainelink.net/%7Epore/">
Orgone energy</a> was Reich's
        subject of studies). [<a href="faq_7.html#IED">IED</a>]


<p>
        The song name comes from hunting clouds, not from breaking them, and
        the remix called Meteorological Mix is from The Big Sky. There are
        two remixes of Cloudbusting: The Orgonon Mix and the video version.

     <strong>Hello Earth:</strong>


<blockquote>

<p>
        At the end of &quot;Hello, Earth&quot; the German words are: &quot;Tiefer, tiefer,
        irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht&quot; This means: &quot;deeper, deeper,
        somewhere in the depth there is a light.&quot; They are not spoken by
        Kate, but by Gabi Zangerl, a friend of Kate.


<p>
        The choir part of this song was inspired by <a 
href="http://rte66.com/M/person-exact?Herzog%2C+Werner">Werner Herzog</a>'s film
        <a href="http://rte66.com/M/title-exact?Nosferatu%3A+Phantom+der+Nacht+%281979%29">
Nosferatu</a> that features a very similar chant.  Recently it became known
        that the chant originates from Georgia, it's a traditional lyrical song
        from Kakheti-Kartli, the easternmost region of the (former Soviet)
        Republic of Georgia, the area around Tbilisi, the capital.  


<p>
        The song is actually best transliterated as &quot;tsintsqaro&quot; (At the Spring, By 
the
        Source or At the Well), a boy meets girl love song.  You might find
        this song, also spelled as Tshintsharo or Zinzgaro, on some CDs with
        traditional Georgian music (eg &quot;The Marvels of Polyphony in Sakartvelo&quot;, CD 
Ethnic Sound Series #17, Victor, Japan 1987).  [<a href="faq_7.html#W">W</a>, <a href="faq_7.html#CHB">CHB</a>]
