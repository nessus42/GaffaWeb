		<P> On August 16, 1985 |&gt;oug /\lan thought it was time to create a
		  discussion round about Kate Bush and her absolute artistic genius. At first it
		  was 'only' a mailing list, but it soon resulted in a
		  <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">usenet newsgroup</A>. The name &quot;Gaffa&quot; comes
		  from <A HREF="../sensual/l_sig.html">&quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;</A>, a song on the
		  album <A HREF="../sensual/tsw_td.html">&quot;The Dreaming&quot;</A>, and refers to
		  gaffer's tape (that's what Kate <A HREF="http://www.lies.com/">says</A>).
		  Gaffer's tape (similar to
		  <A HREF="http://images.orgill.com/200x200/4904744.jpg">duct tape</A>, but not
		  as sticky) is used to stop people from stumbling over cabling. </P> 
		<P> The name 'r.m.gaffa' was preferred over 'r.m.katebush' to indicate
		  that discussion is not limited to Kate. Sometimes this gets too much, but what
		  to do in a four years gap between albums? Other artists discussed here include
		  <A HREF="http://www.suspended-in-gaffa.com/">various female
		  alternative artists</A> as well as Kate related people like
		  <A HREF="http://www.petergabriel.com/">Peter Gabriel</A> or
		  <A HREF="http://www.royharper.com/">Roy Harper</A>. </P> 
		<P> &quot;Suddenly my feet are feet of mud <BR> It all goes slo-mo <BR> I
		  don't know why I'm crying <BR> Am I suspended In Gaffa?&quot; </P> 
		<P> Another note about gaffa and the discussions about its meaning: </P> 
		<P> AIIEEEEEEEE! Please! Not again! &quot;It's tape!&quot; &quot;No it's not, you
		  shallow twerp!&quot; &quot;But she said it's tape in an interview!&quot; &quot;Well, she lied. Kate
		  _can_ lie, y'know...&quot; &quot;But why would she? C'mon, it's tape.&quot; &quot;No way -- far too
		  shallow for the goddess. Clearly, the song is about being mired in concepts
		  that prevent us from reaching our chosen destinations.&quot; &quot;But she said it was
		  tape&quot; &quot;It's not.&quot; (&quot;Hey guys, quit shouting. It could easily be _both_&quot;) &quot;Hey!
		  You got your gaffer's tape in my conceptual quagmire!&quot; &quot;No -- you got your
		  conceptual quagmire in my gaffer's tape!&quot; (TOGETHER) &quot;Heyyyyyyy...&quot; </P> 
		<P> Gaffa: It's <A HREF="http://www.godiva.com/">two great</A> concepts
		  that <A HREF="http://www.stim.com/Stim-x/9.2/fries/fries-09.2.html">taste
		  great</A> together. [<A HREF="faq_credits.html#GP">GP</A>] </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
