    <strong> It has really happened to us!</strong>


<p>
     May 8, 1994, London's Hippodrome.  Short list of events:

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>      lots of rare videos
<li>      lots of live music/dance from fans
<li>      three new Kate songs: <a href="http://www.sju.edu/%7Ebs065903/gershwin/homepage.htm">The Man I Love</a>, Sexual Healing, and a brand new
            US dance remix of Rubberband Girl
<li>      a raffle which got the lucky winner the Japanese gold record for
           Lionheart as well as a kiss stolen from Kate
<li>      an auction hosted by Dave from Homeground and <a href="DP_LH.jpg">Del Palmer</a> where
           super-rare (&quot;one exists, two exist, ...&quot;) stuff went away for
           2230 pounds (all profits, including these, went to the <a href="http://midge.bath.ac.uk/~ee3cmk/jog-le/GOSH.html">Great Ormund
          Street Children's Hospital</a>)
<li>      a quiz that was won by the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/United_Kingdom/England/Districts_and_Regions/Norfolk/">Norfolk</a> Alchemists the second time in a row
          (next time we will practise a bit!)
<li>      lots of merchandise, some for money, some for free
<li>      Paddy Bush and Colin Lloyd Tucker (Bushtucker) presenting their album
         <a href="Bushtucker.html">Skyscraping</a>
<li>      The biggest act of <a href="http://miso.wwa.com/~vickie/happy/faq.html">Happyvangelising</a> to date
<li>      Kate herself appearing for a couple of minutes, presenting the main
         prize of the raffle to the lucky winner and presenting her new film,
<li>      <a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/moments/3_0.html">The Line, The Cross, And The Curve</a>
<li>      Kate inspired disco
<li>      and, last but not least, lots of fun

</ul>

<p>
     Thanks to everyone involved, and see you next time!
