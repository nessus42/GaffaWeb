     <strong>Leave It Open:</strong>

<p> 
       The 'backwards' lyrics at the end of the song aren't really backwards.
        They've been recorded backwards, but they are pretty much straight
        forward and say &quot;we let the wierdness in&quot;.  Kate listened to the
        phrase backwards and tried to sing what she heard, which then was
        played backwards again - resulting in a wierd sounding forward phrase.
        On the other hand, you can hear something backwards as well: &quot;And they
        said they won't let me in&quot; (this isn't official, while the forward
        phrase is - it was a long unanswered quiz question in the KBC).

     <strong>Houdini:</strong>


<blockquote>

<p>
        <a href="http://www.uelectric.com/houdini/houdini.html">Harry Houdini</a> (born Erich 
Weiss) was an escapologist who managed to
        escape by using a key that was passed to him by his wife Bess with a 
        kiss she always gave him before he was bound and drowned.  (&quot;With a
        kiss, I'd pass the key.&quot;)  Now Houdini and his wife previously agreed
        on a secret code (&quot;Rosabel, believe!&quot;), which he should use via a
        medium after his death to let her know about after-life.  At one point
        Bess was given the code by a &quot;psychic,&quot; but she later found out that he
        obtained it from a former servant of Houdini's (it *was* simply their
        favorite song, rather than some involved code.)  So, it's easy to see
        how the confusion has happened.


<p>
       Bess *once* stated that a &quot;psychic&quot;
        had given her the code, then she retracted that statement.  As usually
        happens, the people who want to believe in &quot;psychic phenomena&quot; accept
        want they want and disregard the rest.  So the first claim of contact
        is more widely reported than the true (but less romantic) story.
        Kate's song is closer in the details to the Hollywood film starring
        Tony Curtis than to the real events of Houdini's life and art.  This is
        in no way intended to disparage Kate's song, which concentrates on the
        *emotional*, rather than the biographical aspects of Houdini and Bess'
        relationship. [some of this by <A HREF="faq_7.html#CW">CW</a>]
