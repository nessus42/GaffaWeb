     Normally <a href="katefan.jpg">Katefans are nice</a> people.  Hey!  We all share at least one
     similar taste in music!  Nevertheless r.m.g shares something with every
     other usenet newsgroup - that is, there are <a href="http://www.globalinfo.com/noncomm/firehouse/Firehouse.HTML">flamewars</a>.
  Even the nasty
     kind.  No one likes them, so the best <a href="jgun.jpg">way to deal</a> with rude and/or
     uninteresting posts is to ignore them and post something positive and
     interesting.


<p>
     <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/1945/index1.htm">Newbies</a> are explicitly 
invited to take part in the conversation.  Be it
     that you want to know something not in this FAQ, be it that you think
     you have a piece of information to share, be it that you think you
     know some <a href="http://miso.wwa.com/%7Evickie/artists/artists.html">other music </a>
you think should be known by more people.  (Though I'd say you should at least like Kate :-) ...)


<p>
     Abbreviations commonly used on Love-Hounds include common Usenet
     conventions such as IMHO (In My Humble Opinion), ROFL (Rolling on the
     floor laughing), as well as sideways faces, known as 
<a href="http://www.atcom.co.at/atcom/smileys.htm">&quot;smilies&quot;</a> such
     as :-).  Also used here are the initials of Kate's songs, such as RUTH
     for <a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/sensual/l_ruth.html">Running Up That Hill</a> (sometimes known as DwG for Deal with God ;^).


<p>
     A new one commonly seen is /+) or |X( or any combination, such
     as |+).  This is, of course, Kate's film 
<a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/moments/3_3.html">
&quot;The Line, the Cross, and The Curve&quot;</a> 
(Sometimes abbreviated to the less cryptic-looking 
<a href="http://www.music.sony.com/Music/artistInfo/KateBush_TheLineTheCrossTheCurve.html">TLTCTC</a>).
