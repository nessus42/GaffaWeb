<p>
     Kate has never commented on any bootleg material, and so she hasn't
     said anything about these as bootlegs.  But she has said plenty of
     things about these recordings - generally to the effect that there
     are about 200 or more of them (20-30 have been 'released' on bootlegs)
     and that they should remain buried and will never re-record any of them.
     The sound quality of all of them reminds of a boombox set to 'record' in a
     living room.  Nevertheless most fans do LOVE these songs and would almost
     kill to hear the rest.
