      <P> This is originally a single on its own, but has now been used in
        almost too many singles as a b-side (Experiment IV, Moments Of Pleasure
        (UK)), and is quite often used on Christmas samplers by EMI. One of
        these featured an alternate ('bongo') version of the song. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P> The <a HREF="http://www.eltonjohn.com/">Elton John</a>
        cover version <a HREF="http://www.eltonography.com/songs/rocket_man_i_think_its_going_to_be_a_long_long_time.html">Rocket Man</a>
        appeared on the Elton John and Bernie Taupin tribute album Two Rooms
        featuring a whole bunch of cover versions. Rocket Man also is available
        as a single where it is backed with another EJ cover, <a HREF="http://www.eltonography.com/songs/candle_in_the_wind.htmll">Candle
          In The Wind</a>, which is available in a normal and an instrumental
        version. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P> This cover of the 30s song was originally supposed to be included in
        the film of the same name. Unfortunately it was left out. But we were
        lucky, since the soundtrack for Brazil (which only appeared in 1992)
        includes the song. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fruitopia Commercials</STRONG> </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P> Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV for
        Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which is a
        subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company). There was also a longer
        advertisement seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music for.
        Another series of Fruitopia Commercials just started, the first one
        being spotted during a commercial break of the '95 <a HREF="http://www.oscars.org/">Academy
          Awards</a> show. The British versions of the Fruitopia commercials
        don't contain Kate's music, but rather Elisabeth Fraser from the <a HREF="http://www.cocteautwins.com/">Cocteau Twins</a>. The
        original US commercials (i.e. those with Kate's music) do have
        kaleidoscopic effects, short subtitles, and just Kate's music on the
        audio channel. Kate's voice can be heard, though there are no words to
        be understood. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
