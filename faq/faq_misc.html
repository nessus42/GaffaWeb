	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P> This is originally a single on its own, but has now been used in
		  almost too many singles as a b-side (Experiment IV, Moments Of Pleasure (UK)),
		  and is quite often used on Christmas samplers by EMI. One of these featured an
		  alternate ('bongo') version of the song, originally recorded for the &quot;Abba
		  Christmas Snowtime Special&quot;. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P> The <A HREF="http://www.eltonjohn.com/">Elton John</A> cover version
		  <A HREF="http://www.eltonography.com/songs/rocket_man_i_think_its_going_to_be_a_long_long_time.html">Rocket
		  Man</A> appeared on the Elton John and Bernie Taupin tribute album Two Rooms
		  featuring a whole bunch of cover versions. Rocket Man also is available as a
		  single where it is backed with another EJ cover,
		  <A HREF="http://www.eltonography.com/songs/candle_in_the_wind.htmll">Candle In
		  The Wind</A>, which is available in a normal and an instrumental version.

		<P> This cover of the 30s song was originally supposed to be included in
		  the film of the same name. Unfortunately it was left out. But we were lucky,
		  since the soundtrack for Brazil (which only appeared in 1992) includes the
		  song. </P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P> <STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fruitopia
		Commercials</STRONG> </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P> Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV for
		  Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which is a
		  subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company). There was also a longer advertisement
		  seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music for. Another series of
		  Fruitopia Commercials just started, the first one being spotted during a
		  commercial break of the '95 <A HREF="http://www.oscars.org/">Academy Awards</A>
		  show. The British versions of the Fruitopia commercials don't contain Kate's
		  music, but rather Elisabeth Fraser from the
		  <A HREF="http://www.cocteautwins.com/">Cocteau Twins</A>. The original US
		  commercials (i.e. those with Kate's music) do have kaleidoscopic effects, short
		  subtitles, and just Kate's music on the audio channel. Kate's voice can be
		  heard, though there are no words to be understood. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
