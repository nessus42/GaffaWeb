      <P> On August 16, 1985 |&gt;oug /\lan thought it was time to create a
        discussion round about Kate Bush and her absolute artistic genius. At
        first it was 'only' a mailing list, but it soon resulted in a
        <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">usenet newsgroup</A>. The name &quot;Gaffa&quot;
        comes from <A HREF="../sensual/l_sig.html">&quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;</A>,
        a song on the album <A HREF="../sensual/tsw_td.html">&quot;The Dreaming&quot;</A>,
        and refers to gaffer's tape (that's what Kate
        <A HREF="http://www.lies.com/">says</A>). Gaffer's tape (similar to <a HREF="http://images.orgill.com/200x200/4904744.jpg">duct tape</a>, but
        not as sticky) is used to stop people from stumbling over cabling. </P>
      
      <P> The name 'r.m.gaffa' was preferred over 'r.m.katebush' to indicate
        that discussion is not limited to Kate. Sometimes this gets too much,
        but what to do in a four years gap between albums? Other artists
        discussed here include
        <A HREF="http://miso.wwa.com/%7Evickie/artists/artists.html">various
          female alternative artists</A> as well as Kate related people like <a HREF="http://www.petergabriel.com/">Peter Gabriel</a> or
      <a HREF="http://www.royharper.com/">Roy Harper</a>. </P>
      
      <P> &quot;Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
        <BR> It all goes slo-mo
        <BR> I don't know why I'm crying
        <BR> Am I suspended In Gaffa?&quot; </P>
      
      <P> Another note about gaffa and the discussions about its meaning: </P>
      
      <P> AIIEEEEEEEE! Please! Not again! &quot;It's tape!&quot; &quot;No it's
        not, you shallow twerp!&quot; &quot;But she said it's tape in an
        interview!&quot; &quot;Well, she lied. Kate _can_ lie, y'know...&quot; &quot;But
        why would she? C'mon, it's tape.&quot; &quot;No way -- far too shallow
        for the goddess. Clearly, the song is about being mired in concepts that
        prevent us from reaching our chosen destinations.&quot; &quot;But she
        said it was tape&quot; &quot;It's not.&quot; (&quot;Hey guys, quit
        shouting. It could easily be _both_&quot;) &quot;Hey! You got your
        gaffer's tape in my conceptual quagmire!&quot; &quot;No -- you got your
        conceptual quagmire in my gaffer's tape!&quot; (TOGETHER) &quot;Heyyyyyyy...&quot;
      </P>
      
      <P> Gaffa: It's <A HREF="http://www.godiva.com/">two great</A> concepts
        that <a HREF="http://www.stim.com/Stim-x/9.2/fries/fries-09.2.html">taste great</a>
        together. [<A HREF="faq_7.html#GP">GP</A>] </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
