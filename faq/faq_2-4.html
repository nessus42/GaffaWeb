<blockquote>
<p>
      (MUSH is Multi-User Shared Hallucination.) 

<p>
      &quot;Gaffaland&quot; was set up by Stev0 in the Tinycwru MUSH.
      To access it, go to:

<p>

     telnet <a href="telnet://tinycwru.chaco.com:4201">tinycwru.chaco.com 4201</a>

<p>
     And once you're logged on, type:

     @tel #91468

<p>
     at the prompt, to get to Gaffaland.

<p>
     Once you're inside, you're in a Happy Rhodes-inspired room, but to
     get to the Kate room, go to the Artist Annex (where there are rooms
     for Kate, Tori, Sarah, etc.), then just type "Kate" to go to the
     Kate room (although you may want to look around first and also type
     HELP just so you can figure out what's happening).

<p>
     Along with a Virtual Kate Paradise ("Gaffaland"), you
     can have real-time chat with your fellow Lovehounds! [<a href="faq_7.html#SB">SB</a>]
