		<P><IMG SRC="happyrhodes.jpg" ALT="(Picture of Happy Rhodes, with Kate in the background)" STYLE="float: left" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="150"> Happy Rhodes (her real name) is
		  an independent singer/songwriter/musician from upstate New York, with 10 albums
		  and an astonishing vocal range. She's been described as having a voice that
		  ranges from early Kate Bush highs to David Bowie or Annie Lennox lows. In fact,
		  a Happy Rhodes song has been floating around the file-sharing world for years
		  called &quot;When The Rain Came Down&quot; that's misidentified as being by Kate Bush and
		  Annie Lennox. If you'd like to hear the song,
		  <A HREF="http://wretchawry.com/happy/samples/HappyRhodes_Ecto15_WhenTheRainCameDown(CDbonustrack).mp3">here
		  it is</A>. Happy herself is a huge Kate Bush fan and learned how to sing by
		  singing along to The Kick Inside. </P>

		<P>The Kate Bush mailing list Love-Hounds/newsgroup rec.music.gaffa was
		  founded with the idea of being a newsgroup about &quot;Progressive Artists with
		  emphasis on Kate Bush&quot; so discussions about other &quot;progressive artists&quot; are
		  generally encouraged. However, occasionally the talk about a different artist
		  grew to a point where it is appropriate to form a separate group. This is what
		  happened with <A HREF="http://www.auntiesocialmusic.com/">Happy</A>, whose song
		  &quot;<A HREF="http://www.ecto.org/lyrics/warpaint/feedthefire.html">Feed The
		  Fire</A>&quot; (from <A HREF="http://www.ecto.org/lyrics/warpaint/index.html">Warpaint</A>) was the
		  most requested song on WXPN, a Philadelphia radio station. Happy Rhodes
		  discussion now takes place on the mailing list founded by Jessica Koeppel in
		  1991 called <A HREF="http://www.ecto.org/">Ecto</A>.</P> 
		<P> If you want to subscribe to this list, whose broad range of
		  discussion includes many other female artists (including Kate Bush), send a
