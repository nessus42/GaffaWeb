<p>
     To ensure that every message from the newsgroup <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">
rec.music.gaffa</a> also
     finds its way into the mailing list <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">
Love-Hounds</a>, <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</a> is
     a moderated newsgroup.  This means that to post an article to r.m.g
     you have to send it as an email message to the moderator who has to
     approve the article.  In r.m.g's case the 'moderator' is the receiving
     address for the list, i.e. love-hounds@gryphon.com.  More intelligent
     news software does know about this and if you post an article instead
     of sending it to the moderator's address these systems act in one
     of three ways:


<p>
<ol>
  <li> Your article is thrown away.  This is the reason why a lot of new
        readers don't find their articles in the news system.  If you
        experience this, you have to use the love-hounds@gryphon.com
        address by yourself.


<p>
 <li> Your article is repackaged and forwarded to the moderator.  While
        doing this, the news software insists on creating a new header.
        This is responsible for most of the postings with some news system
        as the sender and without any subject.  It may be the case that your
        article actually is shown correctly on your news system, especially
        if the system forwarding it to the moderator isn't yours.  In this
        case you might wonder why replies or follow-ups to your articles
        don't have any subject.  If you experience this, you should either
        bug your system administrator (to change the behaviour to the third
        one below) or use the email address.


<p>
   <li>Your article is directly forwarded to the moderator.  This is
        perfectly ok, since then your name and subject lines survive.

</ol>
<p>
     Be assured again that no article you write is thrown away due to its
     contents or your person.  It's just the wrong way of posting it, since
     the whole process is fully automated.
