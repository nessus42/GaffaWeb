		<P>Kate's first appearance in the public was a little tour through a few
		  London pubs together with the so called KT (read: Katie) Bush Band. All of
		  Kate's albums have the KT (originally Knights Templar) symbol hidden somewhere
		  either on the cover or on the vinyl itself (see section <A HREF="faq_symbolsmain.html">4.10</A>). You might have to have original UK versions of
		  the albums to find them. The KT initials can <A HREF="ktad.jpg">also be
		  seen</A> in the &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; video. </P>

		<P> The release of the This Woman's Work boxed set there appeared a new
		  version of the KT symbol that includes the biological symbol for woman: </P>

		<P> Fans of Kate were saddened by the news of the passing of her mother
		  on Valentine's day, 1992. (We don't know for what cause, sorry.) </P>

		  <LI>She's not married (to our knowledge, although she has been
			 photographed wearing rings on the traditional finger), but you should bury all

			 1999. </LI>
