		<P> The beginning ("It's in the trees! It's coming!") is from the 1957 UK
		  horror movie <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0050766">"Night of the
		  Demon"</A> (US title: "Curse Of The Demon", original title: "Casting The
		  Runes"), though Kate re-recorded the bit, because she couldn't get enough
		  quality from the original. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P><A HREF="bod.jpg"><IMG SRC="bod_th.gif"
		  ALT="Cover of The Book of Dreams" HEIGHT="143" WIDTH="100"></A> </P> 
		<P> This is based on Peter Reich's book "A Book Of Dreams" (you can see
		  this book in the video, in <A
		  HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sutherland,+Donald">Donald Sutherland's</A>
		  pocket). Peter writes about his experience in his youth, when
		  <A HREF="http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/">Wilhelm Reich</A> (his father) got
		  problems with the government due to his questionable actions as a scientist.
		  Wilhelm got arrested and died while in prison, and this experience later made
		  the then-9-years-old Peter write "A Book Of Dreams". Wilhelm was arrested for
		  refusing to appear at an arrangement hearing that resulted from a lawsuit by
		  the <A HREF="http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/reich.htm">American FDA </A> for
		  selling his "orgone energy accumulators" across state lines. The FDA said it
		  was quackery to sell these boxes made of aluminum and wood as therapeutic
		  devices; Reich insisted it was serious science and refused to have anything to
		  do with these "spurious" legal restrictions on his research and therapy. Of
		  course, he was quite mad by then - this was nearly a decade after he claimed
		  that <A HREF="http://skepdic.com/orgone.html">orgone energy </A> was not simply
		  the libidinal buildup that resulted from a lack of proper sexual release, but
		  was also the substance out of which the whole universe was formed.
		  Interestingly, several well-known people, including
		  <A HREF="http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nmailer.htm">Norman Mailer</A>, had orgone
		  accumulators. More about Wilhelm Reich can be found in the file
		  <A
		  HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich</A>
		  or at the website of the Wilhelm Reich Museum at
		  <A
		  HREF="http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/">http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/</A>.
		  [part of this is from <A HREF="faq_credits.html#JAC">JAC</A> (see credits
		  section)] </P> 
		<P> There is no such thing as a song called Cloudbursting (regard the
		  spelling), and there is no remix of Cloudbusting called The Meteorological Mix,
		  despite of what EMI America wants to tell us. EMI UK isn't really better, for
		  the real spelling of what the world knows as the Organon Mix should have been
		  Orgonon Mix (Orgonon was the name of Reich's home/center in Maine,
		  <A HREF="http://www.orgonomicscience.org/orgoneenergy.html">Orgone energy</A>
		  was Reich's subject of studies). [<A HREF="faq_credits.html#IED">IED</A>] </P> 
		<P> The song name comes from hunting clouds, not from breaking them, and
		  the remix called Meteorological Mix is from The Big Sky. There are two remixes
		  of Cloudbusting: The Orgonon Mix and the video version. </P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P> <STRONG>Hello Earth:</STRONG> </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P> At the end of "Hello, Earth" the German words are: "Tiefer, tiefer,
		  irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht" This means: "deeper, deeper, somewhere
		  in the depth there is a light." They are not spoken by Kate, but by Gabi
		  Zangerl, a friend of Kate. </P> 
		<P> The choir part of this song was inspired by
		  <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Herzog,+Werner">Werner Herzog</A>'s film
		  <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079641/">Nosferatu</A> that features a very
		  similar chant. Recently it became known that the chant originates from Georgia,
		  it's a traditional lyrical song from Kakheti-Kartli, the easternmost region of
		  the (former Soviet) Republic of Georgia, the area around Tbilisi, the capital.
		  </P> 
		<P> The song is actually best transliterated as "tsintsqaro" (At the
		  Spring, By the Source or At the Well), a boy meets girl love song. You might
		  find this song, also spelled as Tshintsharo or Zinzgaro, on some CDs with
		  traditional Georgian music (eg "The Marvels of Polyphony in Sakartvelo", CD
		  Ethnic Sound Series #17, Victor, Japan 1987). [<A
