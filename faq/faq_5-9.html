    <a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/sensual/l_dwbma.html"> <strong>December Will Be Magic Again</strong></a>


<blockquote>

<p>
        This is originally a single on its own, but has now been used in
        almost too many singles as a b-side (Experiment IV, Moments Of
        Pleasure (UK)), and is quite often used on Christmas samplers by EMI.
        One of these featured an alternate ('bongo') version of the song.

<p>
        This is the 'teaser' for the semifans on the sampler The Whole Story.

     <strong>Rocket Man</strong><br>
     <strong>Candle In The Wind</strong>


<blockquote>

<p>
        The <a href="http://itchy.faa.uiuc.edu/elton.html">Elton John</a> cover version <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/%7Ebodohd/songs/rocket.man.html">Rocket 
Man</a> appeared on the Elton John
        and Bernie Taupin tribute album Two Rooms featuring a whole bunch
        of cover versions.  Rocket Man also is available as a single where
        it is backed with another EJ cover, <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/%7Ebodohd/songs/candle.in.the.wind.html">Candle In The Wind</a>, which is
        available in a normal and an instrumental version.

    <strong> <a href="http://poppy.kaist.ac.kr/cinema/brazil/">Brazil</a></strong>


<blockquote>

<p>
        This cover of the 30s song was originally supposed to be included
        in the film of the same name.  Unfortunately it was left out.  But
        we were lucky, since the soundtrack for Brazil (which only appeared
        in 1992) includes the song.

     <strong><a href="http://www.click3x.com/spots/fruitopia.html">Fruitopia Commercials</a></strong>



<blockquote>

<p>
        Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV
        for Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which
        is a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company).  There was also a longer
        advertisement seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music
        for.  Another series of Fruitopia Commercials just started, the
        first one being spotted during a commercial break of the '95 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Movies_and_Films/awards/academy_Awards/">Academy
        Awards</a> show.  The British versions of the Fruitopia commercials don't
        contain Kate's music, but rather Elisabeth Fraser from the <a 
href="http://garnet.berkeley.edu:8080/">Cocteau
        Twins</a>.  The original US commercials (i.e. those with Kate's music)
        do have kaleidoscopic effects, short subtitles, and just Kate's music
        on the audio channel.  Kate's voice can be heard, though there are
        no words to be understood.
