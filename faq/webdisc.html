	 <P>There are several discussion groups you can join nowadays, each with its
		own format and flavor. Here are some of the major forums: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><B><A HREF="lh.html">Lovehounds/rec.music.gaffa</A></B> - The oldest
		  Kate forum on the internet (first started in 1985), but also one of the most
		  flame- and troll- infested forums. Highly recommended for those with very thick
		  skin. Unlike the other forums, this is a usenet group/mailing list. <BR>
		  &nbsp;</LI> 
		<LI><B> <A HREF="http://pub3.ezboard.com/ 
bthehomegroundandkatebushnewsandinfoforum">The Homeground/Kate Bush News and
		  Information Forum</A></B> - The H/KBN&amp;I Forum is run by Peter
		  Fitzgerald-Morris, editor of the Homeground fanzine, and Sean Twomey, who runs
		  the <A HREF="http://www.katebushnews.com/">Kate Bush News and Information</A>
		  site. With people like that behind it, it's no wonder that this is the best
		  source for Kate news and talk that is out there. <BR> &nbsp;</LI> 
		<LI><B><A HREF="http://www.katebushforum.com/forum/">The Kate Bush
		  Forum</A></B> - A pretty straightforward Kate board with admins who work hard
		  to keep the place looking nice. <BR> &nbsp;</LI> 
		<LI><B><A HREF="http://katebush.proboards6.com/">The Sensual
		  World</A></B> - Another nice-looking board which has separate sub-forums for
		  each album for in-depth discussion. <BR> &nbsp;</LI> 
		<LI><B><A
		  HREF="http://www.atforumz.com/forumdisplay.php?f=137">Kate@forumz</A> -
		  </B>While not as feature-filled as most other Kate boards out there, what it
		  lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in a high number of good
		  posts. </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>For dozens of more groups, look at the
		<A
		HREF="http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/dir/Music/Genres/Rock_and_Pop/Artists/Complete_Category_Listing/Bush,_Kate
">Kate
		Bush</A> category of <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Groups</A> (doing
		the obvious thing of searching on "Kate Bush" is not recommended since it
		brings up very odd results), or doing a search in
		<A HREF="http://groups.msn.com/">MSN Groups</A> (recommended of those:
		<A HREF="http://groups.msn.com/KATEBUSHFanclub">Kate Bush Fanclub</A> and
		<A HREF="http://groups.msn.com/TheKickInside">The Kick Inside</A>). <BR>
