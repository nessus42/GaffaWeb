<p>
     On August 16, 1985 |&gt;oug /\lan thought it was time to create a
     discussion round about Kate Bush and her absolute artistic genius.  At
     first it was 'only' a mailing list, but it soon resulted in a 
<a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">usenet newsgroup</a>.  The name &quot;Gaffa&quot; comes 
from <a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/sensual/l_sig.html">&quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;</a>, a song on
     the album <a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/sensual/tsw_td.html">&quot;The Dreaming&quot;</a>, 
and refers to gaffer's tape (that's what Kate
     <a href="http://www.lies.com/">says</a>).  Gaffer's tape (similar to 
<a href="http://www.wholeperson.com/%7Ebooks/ph/dt/dt.htm">duct tape</a>, but not as sticky) is used
     to stop people from stumbling over cabling.


<p>
     The name 'r.m.gaffa' was preferred over 'r.m.katebush' to indicate that
     discussion is not limited to Kate.  Sometimes this gets too much, but
     what to do in a four years gap between albums?  Other artists discussed
     here include <a href="http://miso.wwa.com/%7Evickie/artists/artists.html">various female alternative artists</a> as well as Kate related
     people like <a href="http://www.cs.clemson.edu/%7Ejunderw/pg.html">Peter Gabriel</a> or <a 
href="http://www.helsinki.fi/%7Eakoskine/royharper.html">Roy Harper</a>.


<p>
        &quot;Suddenly my feet are feet of mud<br>
         It all goes slo-mo<br>
         I don't know why I'm crying<br>
         Am I suspended In Gaffa?&quot;


<p>
     Another note about gaffa and the discussions about its meaning:


<p>
        AIIEEEEEEEE!  Please!  Not again!  &quot;It's tape!&quot; &quot;No it's not, you
        shallow twerp!&quot;  &quot;But she said it's tape in an interview!&quot;  &quot;Well, 
she
        lied.  Kate _can_ lie, y'know...&quot;  &quot;But why would she?  C'mon, it's
        tape.&quot;  &quot;No way -- far too shallow for the goddess.  Clearly, the song
        is about being mired in concepts that prevent us from reaching our
        chosen destinations.&quot;  &quot;But she said it was tape&quot;  &quot;It's not.&quot; 
 (&quot;Hey
        guys, quit shouting.  It could easily be _both_&quot;)  &quot;Hey!  You got your
        gaffer's tape in my conceptual quagmire!&quot;  &quot;No -- you got your
        conceptual quagmire in my gaffer's tape!&quot;  (TOGETHER)  &quot;Heyyyyyyy...&quot;


<p>
        Gaffa:  It's <a href="http://www.godiva.com/">two great</a> concepts that 
<a href="http://www.select-ware.com/fries/">taste great</a> together. [<a href="faq_7.html#GP">GP</a>]
