    <H2>Solutions to &quot;Where are those d*mn KT symbols on all the albums?&quot;</H2>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_tki.html">The Kick Inside</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> You need a vinyl copy or an American CD. The back cover
      (vinyl) and the last page of the booklet (non-UK CDs) has a picture with
      clouds and a kite at the top. This kite's left wing shows the KT symbol.

    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_lh.html">Lionheart</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Not really difficult, just look at the wooden box.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_nfe.html">Never For Ever</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> You need a gatefold vinyl version (UK) or a US vinyl version
      with the lyrics printed on the inner paper sleeve. There's a painted rose.
      Look at its stem. </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_td.html">The Dreaming</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Look at the sleeve of Kate's jacket. Directly below the lower
      dark stripe the symbol is drawn like with a ballpen. </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_hol.html">Hounds of Love</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> You won't have luck with UK CDs, but anywhere else you can
      find it in the back cover/booklet picture directly below Kate's right
      shoulder. It is more or less turned upside down and 'made out of shadow'.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_tws.jpg">The Whole Story</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> You need a UK vinyl version of the album. In the runout area
      of the disc there's the KT symbol scratched in it. </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_tsw.html">The Sensual World</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Draw a clock onto the cover. At two o'clock there's the KT
      symbol, painted with an airbrush. It's not clearly visible on all
      versions. </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P>

        Woman's Work</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Are you really that blind? ;-) </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P> <A HREF="../faq/kt_trs.html">The Red Shoes</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Look directly above 'TE' from 'KATE' (UK version) or above 'R'
      from 'RED' (US version). There you'll find a slightly bent KT that looks
      like a projection on the ground. </BLOCKQUOTE>

        At The Hammersmith Odeon</A>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> There is none :-( </BLOCKQUOTE>
