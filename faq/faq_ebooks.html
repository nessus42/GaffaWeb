		<P> A while ago two collections have been made available, both of which
		  are much more interesting then anything published. They can be ftped from
		  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net">ftp.uu.net</A>, as usual. See section
		  <A HREF="faq_tshirts.html">6</A> for details. There are also disk versions of these
		  floating around somewhere (a set in MS-DOS format, and a set in Macintosh
		  format). Only requirement to get them is a) to find them and b) to agree to
		  send them to the next one requesting them. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P> The Garden is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference material on
		  Kate, available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden/</A>
		  , including a detailed chronology of her life and career (much more complete
		  then anything available anywhere else) [GARDEN01]. Also, a listing of all known
		  Kate recordings, videography (which includes both official videos and the
		  television appearances), and an extensive list of fan magazines [GARDEN02].
		  </P> 
		<P> ALL of the lyrics (including background voices) to ALL of Kate's
		  known songs (including unreleased songs) [GARDEN04]. All of John's and Paddy's
		  [GARDEN03] interviews and articles for the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, as well
		  as Kate's articles for the KBC [GARDEN05, GARDEN06]. Also included are about
		  sixty interviews [GARDEN07 through GARDEN10]. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

		Bush In Her Own Words&quot;</STRONG> </P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P> This is Ron Hill (the [ex-]keeper of this monthly post)'s compilation
		  of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and subject order, forming the
		  closest we may ever see to a full-fledged Kate autobiography. It is available
		  in regular text format, or in Wordperfect 4.2 format, which makes use of
		  Wordperfect's underlining, bolding, and italicizing, ability, and contains an
		  extensive index. It is also available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0
		  versions. (Eventually the extra unedited interviews will be added into The
		  Garden). </P>
