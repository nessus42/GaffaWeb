<P ALIGN="left">I remember it was that Wednesday<br>
Oh when it rained and it rained<br>
They traipsed mud all over the house<br>
It took hours and hours to scrub it out<br>
All over the hall carpet<br>
I took my mop and my bucket<br>
And I cleaned and I cleaned<br>
The kitchen floor<br>
Until it sparkled<br>
Then I took my laundry basket<br>
And put all the linen in it<br>
And everything I could fit in it<br>
All our dirty clothes that hadn’t gone into the wash<br>
And all your shirts and jeans and things<br>
And put them in the new washing machine</P>
<blockquote>

<P ALIGN="left">I watched them going ’round and ’round<br>
My blouse wrapping itself around your trousers<br>
Oh the waves are going out<br>
My skirt floating up around my waist<br>
As I wade out into the surf<br>
Oh and the waves are coming in<br>
Oh and the waves are going out<br>
Oh and you’re standing right behind me<br>
Little fish swim between my legs<br>
Oh and the waves are coming in<br>
Oh and the waves are going out<br>
Oh and the waves are coming in<br>
Out of the corner of my eye<br>
I think I see you standing outside<br>
But it’s just your shirt<br>
Hanging on the washing line<br>
Waving it’s arm as the wind blows by<br>
And it looks so alive<br>
Nice and white<br>
Just like it’s climbed right out<br>
of my washing machine<br>
Washing machine<br>
Washing machine</P>
<blockquote>
	<P ALIGN="left">Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy<br>
	Get that dirty shirty clean<br>
	Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy<br>
	Make those cuffs and collars gleam<br>
	Everything clean and shiny</P>
