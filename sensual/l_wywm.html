<P><EM>[*--&quot;Don't ignore, don't ignore me...&quot;: This &quot;mystery
message&quot;  immediately follows the Morse code &quot;S.O.S.&quot; signal.
Still undeciphered  as of October, 1988, the message is the subject of a
continuing Kate  Bush Club competition. The message is a sentence, twelve words
long,  beginning with the word &quot;Don't&quot;. Backwards, it sounds something
like:  &quot;Zwoh-nikh-noh, zwoh-nikh-noh nee, et-nee nong-widz-aw nee noy.&quot;
The  translation in the lyrics above is only the editor's guess. It is not  even
known for certain whether the message is forward- or  backward-directional.]
</EM></P>
<P><EM>[**--&quot;Listen to me, baby...&quot;, etc.: The words in this
passage, and in  one which follows later in the song are broken
up--fractured--by some  sound-treatment process known only to Kate. Similar to
passages from  Waking the Witch, these lines seem to contain different words
when  played backwards. Respectively, these are: &quot;I was here before, you 
talked to me, you said that you didn't think it was too late to help  me...&quot;;
and &quot;Talk to me, listen to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby...&quot;  These
words apparently were recorded within the momentary gaps which  break up the
forward-directional recording.]
