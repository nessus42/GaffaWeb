<P>Goodbye Norma Jean<BR> Though I never knew you at all<BR> You had the
grace to hold yourself<BR> While those around you crawled 
</P>
<P>They crawled out of the woodwork<BR> And they whispered into your brain<BR>
They set you on a treadmill<BR> And they made you change your name 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And it seems to me you lived your life<BR> Like a candle in the wind<BR>
Never knowing who to cling to<BR> When the rain set in<BR> And I would have
liked to have known you<BR> But I was just a kid<BR> The candle burned out
long before<BR> Your legend ever did</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Loneliness was tough<BR> The toughest role you ever played<BR> Hollywood
created a superstar<BR> And pain was the price you paid 
</P>
<P>Even when you died<BR> Oh the press still hounded you<BR> All the papers
had to say<BR> Was that Marilyn was found in the nude 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And it seems to me you lived your life<BR> Like a candle in the wind<BR>
Never knowing who to cling to<BR> When the rain set in<BR> Well I would have
liked to have known you<BR> But I was just a kid<BR> The candle burned out
long before<BR> Your legend ever did</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Goodbye Norma Jean<BR> Though I never knew you at all<BR> Goodbye Norma
Jean<BR> From the young man in the 22nd row<BR> Who sees you as something as
more than sexual<BR> More than just Marilyn Monroe<BR> 
</P>

<P>Goodbye Norma Jean<BR> Goodbye Norma Jean<BR> Goodbye<BR> Goodbye Norma
