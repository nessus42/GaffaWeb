Traditional, lyrics by John Carder Bush          </P>
<P><EM>[Note: The melody of this song is traditional. The lyrics most  often
heard with this melody date from a later period than the tune  itself. Kate
asked her brother John Carder Bush to compose new lyrics  to the melody for her
own recording. These are the lyrics which  follow.]</EM></P>

<DD>          When rainy nights are soft with tears, </DD>
<DD>          And Autumn leaves are falling, </DD>
<DD>          I hear his voice on tumbling waves </DD>
<DD>          And no one there to hold me. </DD>
<DD>          At evening's fall he watched me walk. </DD>
<DD>          His heart was mine. </DD>
<DD>          But my love was young, and felt </DD>
<DD>          The world was not cruel, but kind. </DD>
<DD>          Where Lagan's light fell on the hour, </DD>
<DD>          I saw him far below me-- </DD>
<DD>          Just as the morning calmed the storm-- </DD>
<DD>          With no one there to hold him. </DD>
<DD>          My loves have come, my loves have gone, </DD>
<DD>          And nothing's left to warn me, </DD>
<DD>          Save for a voice on the traveling wind, </DD>
<DD>          And the glimpse of a face at morning. </DD></DL>
