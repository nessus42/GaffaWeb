<P>     The lyrics of Kate Bush's songs pose many problems for the transcriber.
Almost all of Kate's texts are extremely complex, and are inextricably wound up
with the music to which they are set. To make matters worse, the various
official editions are not always consistent either with the recorded music
itself or with each other. Also, they are generally rather sketchy and unclear
in terms of their layout on the page and their narrative meaning (as indicated
by punctuation--or more accurately, the lack of punctuation).</P>
<P>    To be fair, the lyrics' transcription onto the printed page will always
be a difficult and frustrating task, and each editor must decide at the outset
whether to favour the poetic, the musical or the narrative aspects of Kate's
words.</P>
<P>    In this edition I have chosen to emphasise the narrative meaning of
Kate's lyrics as much as possible. This means that I have have made many changes
from earlier, official editions. I want to make it very clear at the outset,
however, that the actual words of the songs have not been changed at all. The
only changes made here consist of occasional redivisions of the lyrics' original
line structures, and the addition of narrative punctuation.</P>
<P>   My aim throughout has been to improve the clarity of the textual meaning
of the songs for reading purposes. This marks a shift from the intention of the
official transcriptions, which almost invariably appear without punctuation,
except for occasional commas which reflect musical rather than narrative
divisions.</P>
<P>   Naturally, then, this edition is not definitive, but is my interpretive
representation of the original material. Furthermore, this edition reflects my
own conviction that the song-lyrics of Kate Bush consist, for the most part, of
narrative rather than lyrical poetry-- that they tend to &quot;tell a story,&quot;
in other words, and that they can therefore be better understood in the context
of narrative prose.</P>
<P>   In deference to tradition, however, and to the poetic language which Kate
frequently uses, I have retained the convention of setting the words out in
poetic form, beginning each line with a capital letter. In addition, I have
retained many of the original divisions between verses and choruses with which
the songs were first introduced in the official editions. Here again, however, I
have tried to make additional distinctions between the first verses; subsequent
(often extended or altered) verses; bridges; and choruses or refrains,
separating these by means of blank lines between each section. Also, all
repeated choruses and refrains are presented completely, rather than simply
being referred to as &quot;Repeat Chorus&quot;.</P>
<P>   The lyrics for the song Houdini typify the problems which Kate's
song-structures pose for the transcriber who tries to present the words apart
from their musical context. Contrary to the indications given in the official
transcription of the lyrics for Houdini, the song does not return to its
original verse structure following the first chorus. The &quot;second verse&quot;
is greatly extended and takes an entirely new melodic turn. In the present
edition the song's lyrics are presented in conventional stanzas which are based
on the music's basic metre, but these should not be taken as representations of
the song's melodic design, which sometimes takes a very different form than the
verses' and choruses' structure.</P>
<P>   A few further notes: First, in an effort to avoid interrupting the
narrative flow of the lyrics, I have eliminated explicit references to &quot;Chorus&quot;,
&quot;Refrain&quot;, etc. Instead, I have indicated the shifts between verses,
bridges and choruses by means of successive indentations.     Second, where
lines are clearly understood to be the words of a distinct character other than
the narrator, I have sometimes presented those lines in quotations. (In fact, a
large number of the songs consist of dialogues between different characters, but
I have avoided the punctuation of these dialogues with quotation marks in most
cases because the give and take between the various characters is not always
clear.)</P>
<P>  Third, spoken-word passages (such as the long monologue about nuclear
explosions in the middle of Breathing, for example) are represented in indented
quotes.</P>
<P>    Finally, a word or two on the &quot;new&quot; songs. I am referring to
some twenty-two &quot;demo&quot; recordings which Kate made prior to her signing
with EMI in 1976. At this point at least two bootleggers are busy peddling
illegal copies of a tape which Kate apparently made on her own, sometime between
1972 and 1977, but probably in 1976 or 1977. Since it is inevitable that many
fans of Kate's music now have or soon will have copies of these recordings, I
have decided to include the lyrics of those songs in this edition, even though I
know that they have never been officially published. Indeed, Kate herself has so
far not even acknowledged the existence of these twenty-two songs. The emergence
of these songs has presented me with a very difficult moral dilemma, and I have
no confidence that in sharing the lyrics (insofar as I have been able to
decipher them) with other fans here, I am doing the &quot;right&quot; thing. I
have had to weigh Kate's right to privacy against several other factors: first,
the sheer, ineluctable power of the songs themselves; second, the unfairness of
my keeping my knowledge of these songs secret from other fans no less interested
than myself; and most of all, the appalling alternative prospect of saying
nothing and allowing bootleg merchandisers control the fans' information about
(not to mention the market for) the songs. I dearly hope that Kate can forgive
me for my decision, and that she will understand that my inclusion of these
unpublished lyrics here is motivated above all by a deep love of the songs.</P>
<P>   I have based my transcriptions of these twenty-two songs (five of which
are early versions of songs which later appeared on the first three of Kate's
studio albums) solely on a study of a poor transfer from the original tapes.
Consequently there are a number of words which I have been unable to make out
properly, and those words are simply omitted (replaced by dashes). Perhaps some
day Kate and EMI will decide to release an official version of these songs, and
at that point we may learn not only the missing lyrics but also the official
titles of the songs themselves.</P>
<P>    For, of course, I do not really know what the official titles of these
songs are. I have therefore decided to accord what seem to me likely titles to
the songs, and to include them in this collection under those headings. However,
I have also cross-referenced the songs by listing each song under the heading of
their first lines. This way, anyone searching for a given song should be able to
find my transcription by checking the reference under the first line of that
song.</P>
