<P><EM>[This song was composed by Donovan Leitch. Donovan performed the  song
in a sequence from the film If It's Tuesday, This Must be Belgium,  in 1968; and
later included a recording of it on his album H.M.S.  Donovan. It is through the
latter version that Kate became familiar  with the song.]

<P><EM>[As much as it pains this fan to report it, I must mention that  Kate
has made what appears to be a slight error in the course of  adapting the song
from the third to the first person (a change which  becomes possible because of
Kate's ability to assume the role of the  song's female character). In the final
verse the original line--&quot;SaDLy  they mourned and sighed&quot;--apparently
refers to an implied group of  mourners, perhaps friends and relatives, who
believe that the heroine  of the song has drowned and been lost in the river,
when in fact the  lovers--now both swans--fly over the mourners' heads. Kate,
however,  changes the pronoun &quot;they&quot; to &quot;we&quot;, in keeping
with her other shifts  from third to first person. This change unfortunately
confuses the most  likely meaning of the verse. Other interpretations which
accomodate  Kate's version are possible, however.]</EM></P>
<P><EM>[In fact, a rumour persists that Donovan himself contributed  backing
vocals to the recording, even though no official credit is  given to Donovan.
Immediately following the final repetition of the  opening line at the
conclusion of Kate's recording, what sounds like a  male voice can be heard
whispering a couple of words (so far not  deciphered by me).] </EM></P>
