<p>

All the banners stop waving<br>
And the flags stop flying<br>
And the silence comes over<br>
Thousands of soldiers<br>
Thousands of soldiers</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Who is that girl? Do I know her face?<br>
	Who is that girl?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross<br>
And she looks so beautiful in her armour<br>
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God<br>
And she never wears a ring on her finger<br>
<br>
All the cannon are firing<br>
And the swords are clashing<br>
And the horses are charging<br>
And the flags are flying<br>
And the battle is raging<br>
And the bells, the bells are ringing</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Who is that girl? Do I know her face?<br>
	Who is that girl?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross<br>
And she looks so beautiful in her armour<br>
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God<br>
And she never wears a ring on her finger<br>
Joanni, Joanni, Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God<br>
And she just looks beautiful in her armour<br>
Beautiful in her armour<br>
