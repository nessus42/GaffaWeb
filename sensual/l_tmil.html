<P>Someday he'll come along<BR> The man I love<BR> And he'll be big and
strong<BR> The man I love<BR> And when he comes my way<BR> I'll do my best to
make him stay<BR> 
</P>
<P>He'll look at me and smile<BR> I'll understand<BR> And in a little while<BR>
He'll take my hand<BR> And though it seems absurd<BR> I know we both won't say
a word<BR> 
</P>
<P>Maybe I shall meet him<BR> Sunday, maybe Monday, maybe not<BR> Still I'm
sure to meet him one day<BR> Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day 
</P>
<P>He'll build a little home<BR> Just meant for two<BR> From which I'd never
roam<BR> Who would, would you? 
</P>
<P>And so all else above<BR> I'm waiting for the man I love  
</P>
