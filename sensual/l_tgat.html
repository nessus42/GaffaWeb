<P><EM>*--&quot;A star in strange ways.&quot; In addition to the whispered
question  &quot;What's all this then?&quot; (spoken twice), additional words are
spoken in  the vicinity of this line (which seems to be a pun on Strangeways

retreat,       And tear across London using the backstreets.       Remember, be
careful, give nothing away,       The arm of the Law is as long as they say.&quot;
