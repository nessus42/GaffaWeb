<P><EM>[*--&quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;: This last line, heard nine
times, was  recorded in a very strange, &quot;double-backwards&quot; manner. As
a result, it  was extremely hard to decipher and, because it had been
deliberately  omitted from the lyric sheet, its solution became the object of a 
2-yearlong competition in the Club. There are some fans who even now  argue that
in addition to this line, another can be heard when the  track is played
backwards: &quot;They said they would let us in,&quot; or &quot;They  said they
were buried here,&quot; have become popular interpretations. But  others believe
these lines are only imagined.&quot;]
