<P><EM>    [Note: This is a traditional seafaring song from Irish sources. In 
her recording Kate Bush made no significant alterations to the lyrics;  but she
did omit two verses from the most &quot;complete&quot; version I have  been able
to trace. These verses have been restored in the  transcription below, and are
placed between brackets.] </EM></P>

<DT> 'Tis of a pretty female </DT>
<DT> As you may understand. </DT>
<DT> Her mind being bent for rambling </DT>
<DT> Unto some foreign land, </DT>
<DT> She dressed herself in sailor's clothes, </DT>
<DT> Or so it does appear, </DT>
<DT> And she hired with a captain </DT>
<DT> To serve him for a year. </DT></DL>

<DT> <EM>[The captain's wife she being on board,</EM> </DT>

<DT> <EM>Such a handsome cabin boy,</EM> </DT>
<DT> <EM>That now and then she'd slip him a kiss,</EM> </DT>
<DT> <EM>And she'd have liked to toy,</EM> </DT>

<DT> Her cheeks they were like roses </DT>
<DT> And her hair rolled in a curl. </DT>
<DT> The sailors often smiled and said </DT>
<DT> He looked just like a girl. </DT>
<DT> But eating of the captain's biscuit </DT>
<DT> Her colour did destroy, </DT>
<DT> And the waist did swell of pretty Nell, </DT>

<DT> 'Twas in the bay of Biscay </DT>
<DT> Our gallant ship did plow. </DT>
<DT> One night among the sailors </DT>

<DT> For their sleep it did destroy, </DT>

<P><EM>     [*--&quot;flurry and row&quot;: Kate seems to hear this line as &quot;flyin'
 row&quot;,which she delivers in the vaguely Irish accent which characterizes 
her delivery of the entire song. Other similarly trivial points of  divergence
may be found in her reading.] </EM></P>
<P><EM>[Kate's omission of the two bracketed verses may be explained by  their
comically baudy overtones, which would not have fit in well with  her uniquely
dark and serious interpretation of the story.] </EM></P>
