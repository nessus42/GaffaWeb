A man relives his ten-year affair with a young bride -- or is the whole story merely a hallucination in his last moments after a fatal car crash?  By far the most disturbing and enigmatic of the Comic Strip films.  Kate made her acting debut in the role of bride Angela Watkins in this film; <A HREF="r.html#miranda">Miranda Richardson</A> and Alexei Sayle portrayed Angela's parents, <A HREF="m.html#mcinnerny">Tim McInnerny</A> and Julie T. Wallace played her in-laws, and Danny Peacock earned the envy of millions in the role of her newlywed husband while Peter Richardson earned the further envy of millions as her lover.  Kate explains her participation:  <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Peter Richardson worked on the video [for <A HREF="s.html#tsws">The Sensual World</A>] and it was a lot of fun, and we stayed in touch as friends.
