I think the problem with the film, though, is that although as a piece of art it is devastating, it isn't real enough. The whole film is negatively based.  Not once during Pink's life is there a moment of happiness, which I know in every human's life there is.  Even if you have the shittiest life of all, there is always one little moment where you smile for a second or you fall in love with someone and feel happy -- maybe only for ten minutes.  In <CITE>The Wall</CITE> there is no compassion and no objectivity at all, and I actually think that certain areas of that are destructive.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#W">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="waltz"><H1>Waltz Growing Old, A</H1></A>Also known as <A HREF="f.html#feelwaltz">Feeling Like A Waltz</A> or <CITE>A Rose Growing Old</CITE> or <A HREF="i.html#ithurtsme">It Hurts Me</A>.
