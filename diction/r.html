<H1><A NAME="rantan">Ran-Tan Waltz</A></H1>

<P>A song first performed on the 1979 television special <A HREF="k.html#kate">Kate</A> and released as the b-side of <A HREF="b.html#babooshka">Babooshka</A> the following year. </P>

<H1><A NAME="really">Really Gets Me Going</A></H1>

<P>Also known as <A HREF="s.html#scaresme">Scares Me Silly</A>. This is a provisional title given to a demo version of a song which was never released. Recorded ca. 1975 with a complete band, rather than Kate alone at the piano, this song appears to be an attempt to record a more &quot;normal&quot; MOR-oriented track, and as a result it now seems more dated than any other Kate Bush composition, though the lyrics are interesting and far more ambivalent than the up-tempo music suggests. It is available only on bootleg recordings; see the <A HREF="../phoenix/index.html"> Phoenix</A> section for more information. </P>

<H1><A NAME="trsf">Red Shoes, The (film)</A></H1>

<P>A 1948 film written, produced, and directed by the team of <A HREF="p.html#mpowell">Michael Powell</A> and Emeric Pressburger (as The Archers), starring Moira Shearer, Marius Goring, and Anton Walbrook. Shearer plays a rising young dancer who is torn between her love for a composer and the demands of a perfectionist ballet impressario -- or perhaps more aptly, she is caught between the demands of two equally selfish men and her own devotion to her art. The conflict is underscored in the film by the production of a ballet based on Hans Christian Andersen's fable <CITE>The Red Shoes,</CITE> which becomes an elaborate fantasy sequence that embodies the dramatic center of the film. </P>

<P>A favorite film of dancers and dance enthusiasts for nearly half a century -- as much for its detailed and realistic behind-the-scenes view of the dance world as for the outstanding dance sequences -- this film inspired the song <A HREF="r.html#trss">The Red Shoes</A> and the film <A HREF="l.html#tltctc">The Line The Cross And The Curve</A>. A side by side viewing of the latter with the original film reveals many ways in which Kate's creative decisions were shaped by careful study of this masterpiece. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;For ten years we had all been told to go out and die for freedom and democracy; but now the war was over, <CITE>The Red Shoes</CITE> told us to go out and die for art.&quot; -- Michael Powell

<P>A song on the album <A HREF="r.html#trsa">The Red Shoes</A>. This song, a tribute to the 1948 film <A HREF="r.html#trsf">The Red Shoes</A>, provides the starting point of the film <A HREF="l.html#tltctc">The Line The Cross And The Curve</A>. </P>

<H1><A NAME="preich">Reich, Peter</A></H1>

<P>Author of <A HREF="b.html#bookofdreams">A Book Of Dreams</A>, a memoir of his childhood recollections of his father <A HREF="r.html#wreich">Wilhelm Reich</A>, which inspired Kate to write the song <A HREF="c.html#cloudbusting">Cloudbusting</A>. When the song was finished, Kate wrote to Peter Reich: &quot;It was important to me in some way to have a sense of his blessing because his book really moved me. He sent back such a lovely letter. It was an incredible feeling of returning something he'd given to me.&quot; </P>

<H1><A NAME="wreich">Reich, Wilhelm</A></H1>

<P>(1897 - 3 November 1957) A controversial psychoanalyst who took Freudian orthodoxy to an extreme and theorized that all personality disorders arose from sexual repression. Beginning his career at Freud's Psychoanalytic Polyclinic in his native Austria, Reich moved to Germany, but upon Hitler's rise to power in 1933 he was forced to leave the country. In 1942 he founded The Orgone Institute and acquired an estate in Maine which was dubbed <A HREF="o.html#orgon">Orgonon</A>. Reich came to believe that his theoretical &quot;orgone energy&quot; was not merely the result of sexual repression, but was the fundamental energy of the universe -- and that harnessing this energy through his &quot;orgone accumulators&quot; could alter the fundamental properties of matter, or even change the world's climate, creating rain on command. </P>

<P>In 1954, the American Food and Drug Administration issued an injunction against Reich for transporting his orgone accumulators across state lines. Refusing to appear at an FDA hearing -- he deemed orgone energy to be a matter of the utmost national security, and refused to divuge its alleged secrets -- Reich was charged with criminal contempt and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Reich died in a Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania on 3 November 1957. Although Reich was demonstrably insane, it remains tragic that the FDA was able to order his books withdrawn from public circulation and summarily destroyed. </P>

<P>Reich's son <A HREF="r.html#preich">Peter</A>, nine years old at the time of his father's imprisonment, wrote as an adult the autobiographical memoir <A HREF="b.html#bookofdreams">A Book Of Dreams</A>, which recounts his memories of his father. This book inspired the song <A HREF="c.html#cloudbusting">Cloudbusting</A>; in the video for the song, Wilhelm Reich -- or a fictionalized avatar of Reich -- is portayed by actor <A HREF="s.html#sutherland">Donald Sutherland</A>. </P>

<P>Opening song on the album <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A>.

She used the <A HREF="f.html#fairlight">Fairlight</A> to produce a droning sound over the rhythm, and from there the song practically wrote itself. Kate has said this song is about the inability of men and women to understand one another. If they could literally trade places, everyone concerned would be very surprised! </P>
