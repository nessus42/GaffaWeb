Francis Vincent Zappa Junior, 21 December 1940 - 4 December 1993)  The long career of this legendary singer, songwriter, composer, and multi-instrumentalist defies easy summary, spanning some 57 officially sanctioned albums and perhaps ten times as many bootleg releases.  He enjoyed a singularly devoted fan following throughout his career, with many highly successful musicians citing him as a primary influence on their own work.  Appearing on BBC Radio One with <A HREF="g.html#gamba">Paul Gambaccini</A> on the last day of December 1980, Kate selected a favorite song by Zappa, and her testimony speaks for itself:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;I think Zappa's great, and one of my favourite albums is <CITE>Bongo Fury,</CITE> where he and <A HREF="c.html#beefheart">Captain Beefheart</A> are together, so we've got two loonies on one album. It's wonderful, so exciting. And the track I've chosen is <CITE>Montana,</CITE> off of <CITE>Overnight Sensation.</CITE> For me this is one of Zappa's more commercial albums: more instant songs, but at the same time very versatile. I really do hold it as one of my favourite albums.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#Z">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="zoodle"><H1>Zoodle</H1></A>A cat (felis catus, member of family Felidae) now sadly deceased.
