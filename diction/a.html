At the midpoint in their career, Abba were then at the peak of their popularity, so this appearance would have meant major exposure.  Later, in December of that year, Kate appeared on a second Abba television broadcast, <A HREF="w.html#winter">The Winter Snowtime Special</A>.  The practice of pop stars hosting television specials eventually fell into decline, but not before Kate hosted a <A HREF="k.html#kate">special</A> of her own.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="abbey"><H1>Abbey Road Studios</H1></A>This building at Number 3, Abbey Road, London NW8 is more than just the site of the most famous Zebra crossing in the world; founded by EMI in 1931, it remains a vital and important recording facility to this day.<P>It is hard to say whether the association with the Beatles or the connection to her record label is what has drawn Kate to return to this studio so many times over the course of her career.  Kate worked on the albums <A HREF="n.html#neverfor">Never For Ever</A>, <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A>, and <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A> in Studio 2, and the orchestral parts for the albums <A HREF="s.html#tswa">The Sensual World</A> and <A HREF="r.html#trsa">The Red Shoes</A> plus the video for the song <A HREF="s.html#siyl">Sat In Your Lap</A> were recorded in the cavernous Studio 1, a huge space about half an acre in size.  On 12 November 1981, Kate attended a 50th anniversary party for the studio, and cut the birthday cake alongside singer Helen Shapiro.  In March 1986, she recorded a performance of the song <A HREF="u.html#ivy">Under The Ivy</A>  for the 100th broadcast of <A HREF="t.html#tube">The Tube</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="adler"><H1>Adler, Larry</H1></A>(b. Laurence Cecil Adler, 1914) American expatriate composer and master of the chromatic harmonica.  Given his first break by singer Rudy Vallee, Larry Adler was associated with many of the great composers of the 20th Century.  He was a close friend of <A HREF="g.html#gershwin">George Gershwin</A>, Ravel left a special provision in his will allowing Adler to play his composition <CITE>Bolero</CITE> without paying royalties, and both Darius Milhaud and Vaughan Williams wrote works especially for him. Forced to leave his native country at the height of the McCarthy blacklisting era because of alleged anti-American tendencies, Adler moved to England and has returned to the United States only twice in the past forty years.<P>The tribute album <A HREF="g.html#glory">The Glory Of Gershwin</A> was recorded as a celebration of Adler's 80th birthday; on this album Larry Adler and Kate Bush perform a rendition of <A HREF="m.html#manilove">The Man I Love</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="advision"><H1>Advision Studios</H1></A>A London recording studio.

Kate appeared in a school production of this in 1972, her third year at <A HREF="s.html#convent">St. Joseph's Senior School</A>.  Allegedly, the school magazine later reported that &quot;colourful relief was introduced at the entrance of the shepherds and shepherdesses, members of the Senior and First and Second year Choirs, who tripped in all rosy-cheeked and healthy-looking, bringing gifts for the kings.  Two of these, Catherine Bush and Sarah Brennan, later gave a short dance in honor of the kings, which was both pastorally graceful and imaginative.&quot;  The number of fans who now claim to have been there would fill the Royal Albert Hall.<P>Trivia:  The opera was originally commissioned from Menotti by the American television network NBC, which later gave Kate her U.S. television debut on <A HREF="s.html#snl">Saturday Night Live</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="anddream"><H1>And Dream Of Sheep</H1></A>This song is the starting point of <A HREF="n.html#ninth">The Ninth Wave</A>, the song-cycle which comprises side two of the album <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/anddream.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="andsoislove"><H1>And So Is Love</H1></A>A song on the album <A HREF="r.html#trsa">The Red Shoes</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/andsoisl.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="andersona"><H1>Anderson, Alistair</H1></A>A veteran session musician who plays <A HREF="c.html#concertina">concertina</A> on the song <A HREF="r.html#rocketman">Rocket Man</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#A">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="anotherday"><H1>Another Day</H1></A>A song by <A HREF="h.html#harper">Roy Harper</A> originally from his 1970 album <CITE>Flat Baroque And Berserk.</CITE>  <A HREF="g.html#gabriel">Peter Gabriel</A> and Kate performed the song as a duet on Kate's 1979 television special, the eponymous <A HREF="k.html#kate">Kate</A>.
