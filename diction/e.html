Earnshaw has become a very high-profile makeup designer in Hollywood, showcasing her skills in such recent films as <CITE>Hamlet, Cinderella, Sliding Doors, Emma, Surviving Picasso, Othello, Feast of July, Jefferson in Paris,</CITE> and <CITE>Titanic.</CITE>  Her Oscar-winning accomplishments in the latter have catapulted Earnshaw to a level of celebrity, such that she now appears in commercials for Revlon cosmetics. In the course of working on James Cameron's epic film, Earnshaw not only researched the makeup styles of the period, but worked with physicians to study the effects of hypothermia on the human body for the post-disaster sequences.  Should she be reunited with Kate in any future projects, this research may well serve her in good stead.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#E">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="earth"><H1>Earthrise</H1></A>A videocassette release of the <A HREF="s.html#spirit">Spirit of the Forest</A> performance from the television broadcast <A HREF="o.html#future">Our Common Future</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#E">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="east"><H1>East Wickham Farm</H1></A>The Bush family home.

The only musician other than her brother Paddy -- and of course, Kate herself -- to appear on every Kate Bush album to date.
