<H1><A NAME="snl">Saturday Night Live</A></H1>
<P>A late-night television program on the American network NBC which was highly
regarded in the Seventies for presenting new music.  Kate appeared on the show 9
December 1978 (after all these years, still her only performance especially for
American television) having been invited by that week's guest host
<A HREF="i.html#idle">Eric Idle</A>.  Mick Jagger and Paul Simon were reputedly
in the audience.  Receiving a heartfelt, enthusiastic introduction by Idle, Kate
performed the songs <A HREF="t.html#them">Them Heavy People</A> and
<A HREF="m.html#manwith">The Man With The Child In His Eyes</A> -- the former
with full band, the latter sitting atop a piano played by
<A HREF="s.html#shaffer">Paul Shaffer</A>.  She can also be seen in cameo
appearances at the very beginning and end of the show.  
</P>
<P>The number of American fans who now claim to have been in the studio
audience for the broadcast is slightly greater than the population of Norway.

<P>Opening song on the album <A HREF="s.html#tswa">The Sensual World</A>,
inspired by a chapter from the novel <CITE>Ulysses</CITE> by James Joyce (1882
- 1941), published in 1922.  The song was originally intended to include text
from the chapter called Penelope, an internal stream-of-consciousness monologue
by the character Molly Bloom.  Objections from the Joyce estate prevented this,
so Kate devised new text which evokes the original without infringement of
copyright.  A brief sample of the original:

American FM radio in the late 1970s, including such ubiquitous hits as <CITE>Do
It Again</CITE>, <CITE>Reeling In The Years</CITE>, <CITE>Rikki Don't Lose
That Number</CITE> and <CITE>Peg</CITE>.  Becker and Fagen parted ways in June
1981, six months after the release of the album <CITE>Gaucho</CITE>, which had
been delayed by numerous technical difficulties and financial disputes with
their record label.  The pair reunited for other projects five years later,
finally reforming Steely Dan for a successful concert tour in 1995, after which
a live album documenting the tour was released.

<P>In spite of their relative lack of success in England, Steely Dan clearly
had a great influence on Kate -- perhaps mainly in their combination of catchy
if unconventional melodies with lush arrangements and sophisticated
musicianship.  She has chosen their songs to be played during her various radio
appearances as a guest DJ, and in 1980 told <A HREF="g.html#gamba">Paul
Gambaccini</A>:

<P>&quot;I think they're very underestimated.  They're the most incredible
musicians.  This is it.  They are here -- a musician's band.  I mean, all the
musicians in this country just rave about them technically, and as songwriters. 
But you know, they're not really played on the radio, but they're just
incredible.&quot;

<P>Some years later, Kate named <CITE>Gaucho</CITE> as her favorite album by
the group, saying, &quot;For me, each album got better, and I wish they hadn't
split up.&quot;

<P>The Steely Dan song <CITE>Peg</CITE> is said to have strongly influenced
Kate's own song <A HREF="w.html#why">Why Should I Love You?</A>
