According to Kate, the song began with musing on the idea of making a deal with the Devil, and how much more powerful it would be to make a deal with the other side, so to speak.  The title was changed only after Kate was informed that a song with the word &quot;God&quot; in the title would not be played in any religious country.  Feeling that this would be, in Kate's words, cutting her own throat, she agreed to the compromise of retitling the song <CITE>Running Up That Hill</CITE> -- a decision which she told more than one interviewer she has regretted ever since.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#D">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="december"><H1>December Will Be Magic Again</H1></A>A song first performed on <A HREF="w.html#winter">The Winter Snowtime Special</A> and the television special <A HREF="k.html#kate">Kate</A>, and only released as a single nearly a year later. <P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/december.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#D">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="deeper"><H1>Deeper Understanding</H1></A>This song from <A HREF="s.html#tswa">The Sensual World</A> was partly inspired by a documentary on Stephen Hawking, the astrophysicist crippled by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, who can only talk through the use of a speech synthesizer.  &quot;It was one of the most moving things I've ever heard.

In the mid-to-late Sixties, Donovan enjoyed huge chart success with whimsical tunes such as <CITE>Mellow Yellow</CITE> and <CITE>I Love My Shirt</CITE> and the improbably stirring anthem <CITE>Atlantis,</CITE> and also collaborated with such artists as <A HREF="b.html#beck">Jeff Beck</A> and Alice Cooper.

I mean he sings like this all the time.  And again, he's an incredible song writer, lyric writer.  He can play the guitar and he has that fantastic voice.  And it seemed that he'd really got caught up in the copying of Dylan when he first signed up and was singing.  And he was wearing the hats and he was carrying the guitar and everyone thought he was just a Dylan copy, when in fact he wasn't at all.  And it seems that he's just been forgotten, he's gone under.
