She doesn't have monster limos and doesn't tell everyone to piss off all the time like what most rock stars have to do to be taken seriously. She's a cool person, and like...yeah, she's an inspirational musician. I go in there, put down some music and just suddenly it seems when we're making music that the vibe comes right in, but when we stop playing she's just like 'Do ya wanna cup of tea, mate?', that type of thing, which is a very profound statement to hear and something which always goes to my heart [raises his cup of tea] -- well, she goes to my digestive system and plays havoc, probably.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#K">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="kenny"><H1>Kenny Everett Video Show, The</H1></A>Kate appeared on this music and comedy television show hosted by former disc jockey Kenny Everett more than once in 1978 and 1979.  On one occasion, she is interviewed with cue-cards mixed up.  She is eventually reduced to hysterical laughter, unable to speak, as Everett says to the camera, &quot;We've been talking to Kate Bush...but she hasn't been talking to us!&quot;  On another broadcast, she mouths the words &quot;Remember me? I used to be Kate Bush!&quot; and later &quot;He's so sexy!&quot; with a gravelly Cockney voice dubbed in. <P>Kenny Everett (b. Maurice Cole, 1945 - 1995) worked for Radio Luxembourg, the pirate station Radio Caroline, BBC Radio One, and Capital Radio before moving on to a successful television career.  Known for being manic and outrageous in public -- he was dismissed by Radio One after making comments about the wife of the Minister of Transport, and as the keynote speaker at a Conservative conference yelled &quot;Let's bomb Russia!&quot; -- he had a troubled and contradictory private life.  Prior to his death from AIDS at age 50, Everett elevated the role of disc jockey from a person who simply played records to an all-around entertainer.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#K">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="keogh"><H1>Keogh, Paul</H1></A>A session musician who had previously worked on albums by such artists as Roger Daltrey, Kiki Dee, and Lou Reed, Keogh plays guitar on the song <A HREF="s.html#saxophone">Saxophone Song</A>, produced by <A HREF="g.html#gilmour">Dave Gilmour</A> in 1975.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#K">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="kickalbum"><H1>Kick Inside, The (album)</H1></A>The debut album by Kate Bush.<P>This album is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/albums/tki.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#K">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="kicksong"><H1>Kick Inside, The (song)</H1></A>The last song on the album <A HREF="k.html#kickalbum">The Kick Inside</A>.<P>A note on the origin of this song: &quot;Lizzie Wan&quot; (alternately &quot;Lucy Wan&quot;) is an 18th-century English/Irish folk ballad, best known as <CITE>The Ballad of Lizzie Wan,</CITE> which recounts the tragedy of Lizzie Wan, who falls in love with her brother and then kills herself while carrying his child.  Kate's original lyrics in the demo version of <CITE>The Kick Inside</CITE> included the line &quot;Welling eyes from identifying with Lizzie Wan's story&quot; making it clear that her own story refers to a modern pair of siblings who face a similar crisis.
