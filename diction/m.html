Martin first came to public attention as the head of EMI's Parlophone label in 1955, where he originally produced classical and jazz recordings, then developed Parlophone's reputation for releasing original comedy albums by the likes of Flanders and Swann, The Goons (featuring Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan) and Beyond The Fringe (with <A HREF="c.html#cook">Peter Cook</A> and Dudley Moore), and <A HREF="h.html#harris">Rolf Harris</A>.  In April 1962, Martin was recommended to Beatles manager Brian Epstein as a man who had achieved success with unlikely recording artists, and who was looking for an entry into the growing world of pop music; this led to one of the most successful partnerships in popular music, and guaranteed lasting fame for EMI's <A HREF="a.html#abbey">Abbey Road Studios</A>.  In August 1965, following an acrimonious split with EMI over their shoddy business practices, Martin and several other EMI people left to form Associated Independent Recording, a collective-type operation which went on to build two highly successful <A HREF="a.html#air">AIR Studios</A>, one in London and one in Montserrat.

I know Bill developed a close friendship with her which is more than I've had time or opportunity to do.  But Kate and I did have a couple of very nice phone calls since we last worked together.  When I rang her up about this, her interest was immediate.  That was very gratifying.  She had taken a year off from work of any kind and this was bang in the middle of it.  She opened herself to several weeks' work by taking it on, maybe more than she bargained for.  I knew she'd be good and she didn't give up until it was right. She's a real joy to work with. She is exceptionally considerate and thoughtful with people. Add to that how much she cares about what she does and the fact that she will not do something unless she feels she can give of her best.  Hats off.  She's a wonderful woman. She was very excited with the idea of singing the Irish in a way that Irish speakers would understand.  And of conveying the meaning of the song through the sounds of the words.  I helped as much as I could. She had Sean O Se's recording of Mna Na h-Eireann as reference. She was as faithful to the pronunciations as she could possibly be. It was with characteristic care and attention that she approached it.  She did not stint one bit. Of course you'll get people saying , 'Oh ,you'd know she doesn't talk Irish straight off '.  You wouldn't know it straight off.  I would defend her efforts as being totally sincere.  No matter how perfect she gets it, she's not an Irish speaker.
