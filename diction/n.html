She has used other pseudonyms: in one issue of the Newsletter, Kate is purportedly interviewed by one Auntie Hetty, though it is fairly clear that the interview is actually self-conducted, and in another issue has a lengthy discussion with an enthusiastic American cousin named Zwort (or Rodney) who appears to be equally fictitious.

Kate has said this is one of her favorite films, and it has influenced her on at least two occasions: the song <A HREF="h.html#holsong">Hounds of Love</A> begins with a quote from a line spoken in the film by Maurice Denham, and somewhat more obliquely, the film <A HREF="l.html#tltctc">The Line The Cross And The Curve</A> borrows the idea that the possession of a small slip of paper with mystic symbols can confer great power, as well as borrowing several images and set pieces.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="swallow"><H1>Night Of The Swallow</H1></A>A song on the album <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/nightoft.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="stock"><H1>Night Scented Stock</H1></A>A unique wordless performance by Kate on the album <A HREF="n.html#neverfor">Never For Ever</A>, this musical construction is composed entirely of Kate's multi-tracked vocals.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/nightsce.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="ninth"><H1>Ninth Wave, The</H1></A>The song-cycle which forms side two of the album <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A>.<P>While Kate has never spoken of the events in <CITE>The Ninth Wave</CITE> other than metaphorically, it has been speculated persuasively that the Fastnet yachting disaster may have provided partial inspiration for this work. <P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="noself"><H1>No Self Control</H1></A>Kate contributes backing vocals to this song on the album <A HREF="g.html#gabriel">Peter Gabriel</A>.  <A HREF="g.html#giblin">John Giblin</A> plays bass on this track, and later went on to work with Kate on her albums <A HREF="n.html#neverfor">Never For Ever</A>, <A HREF="s.html#tswa">The Sensual World</A>, and <A HREF="r.html#trsa">The Red Shoes</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="nollaig"><H1>Nollaig Ni Chathasaigh</H1></A>Solo violin on the song <A HREF="m.html#mna">Mna Na h-Eireann</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="nosferatu"><H1>Nosferatu</H1></A>A 1979 film directed by Werner Herzog, starring Klaus Kinski, Isabelle Adjani, and Bruno Ganz, written by Herzog from Bram Stoker's novel <CITE>Dracula.</CITE>  Kate borrowed a tune from this film for the choruses of the song <A HREF="h.html#hello">Hello Earth</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="notnine"><H1>Not the Nine O'Clock News</H1></A>On this BBC comedy show, actress <A HREF="s.html#stephenson">Pamela Stephenson</A> sucked in her cheeks to portray Kate and did a creditable imitation of her vocal style for the song <A HREF="e.html#leotard">England My Leotard</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="notthis"><H1>Not This Time</H1></A>A song released as the b-side of the single <A HREF="b.html#bigsky">The Big Sky</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/notthist.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="novercia"><H1>Novercia</H1></A>One of several companies formed to handle the business affairs of Kate Bush; each of her immediate family members is on the Board of Directors.<P>&quot;Novercia&quot; has been translated as Latin for &quot;the new woman&quot; or &quot;she who is new.&quot;  (The word is also an anagram of the name &quot;Veronica,&quot; but whether this name means anything to Kate is something only she can say...)<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#N">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="nyman"><H1>Nyman, Michael</H1></A>(b. 23 March 1944) A British composer best known for his contributions to the films of Peter Greenaway.

After working for several years as a music critic, he founded the Campiello Band, later renamed the Michael Nyman Band. He has also written operas, scores for ballet, and chamber and concert pieces. Michael Nyman arranged the strings for the song <A HREF="r.html#reaching">Reaching Out</A>.<P>Kate on Nyman: &quot;I really like his stuff -- the rawness of his strings.
