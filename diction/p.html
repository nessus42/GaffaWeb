It's an upright Bechstein.  It's absolutely beautiful, but it's not ideal for master recordings.  For me, the piano is one of the most difficult things to record well.  It sounds good in the room, but it doesn't always sound good coming through the speakers.  But I like Bechsteins, and I think Steinways are quite good.  I find that it sometimes helps for the piano to be older.

Many of his greatest accomplishments were made in partnership with the Hungarian emigre Emeric Pressburger.  Under the joint name The Archers, the pair cowrote, coproduced, and codirected a landmark series of films, including <CITE>One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing,</CITE> <CITE>The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp,</CITE> <CITE>A Canterbury Tale,</CITE> <CITE>I Know Where I'm Going,</CITE> <CITE>A Matter Of Life And Death</CITE> (formerly known in the U.S. as <CITE>Stairway To Heaven</CITE>), <CITE>Black Narcissus,</CITE> and of course <A HREF="r.html#trsf">The Red Shoes</A>.

This song was inspired by a television documentary film:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;I saw this incredible documentary by this Australian cameraman who went on the front line in Vietnam, filming from the Vietnamese point of view, so it was very biased against the Americans. He said it really changed him, because until you live on their level like that, when it's complete survival, you don't know what it's about. He's never been the same since, because it's so devastating, people dying all the time.<P>&quot;The way he portrayed the Vietnamese was as this really crafted, beautiful race. The Americans were these big, fat, pink, smelly things who the Vietnamese could smell coming for miles because of the tobacco and cologne. It was devastating, because you got the impression that the Americans were so heavy and awkward, and the Vietnamese were so beautiful and all getting wiped out. They wore a little silver Buddha on a chain around their neck and when they went into action they'd pop it into their mouth, so if they died they'd have Buddha on their lips.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P>The documentary filmmaker was Neil Davis, who worked in Southeast Asia from 1964 until his death in 1985.  Davis did indeed report the war from the Vietnamese point of view -- the ARVN (Army of the Republic of South Vietnam) point of view. This alone would not serve to make him biased against the Americans, their allies.  (It has been suggested that Kate wasn't paying very much attention while watching the documentary, or that her own expectations colored her recollection of it.)  Davis was eventually killed by a burst of shrapnel in a street in Bangkok on 9 September 1985.  <P>An excellent biography of Davis called <CITE>One Crowded Hour</CITE> has been written by Tim Bowden, a close friend of Davis. In a pleasing coincidence, the foreword of this book begins: <P><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife,<BR> Throughout the sensual world proclaim,<BR>One crowded hour of glorious life<BR>Is worth an age without a name.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P>The lines are by Thomas Osbert Mordaunt (1730 - 1809), written during the Seven Years' War of 1756 - 1763.  The biography informs us that Davis wrote the last two lines of Mordaunt's verse in the flyleaf of every work diary he kept in Southeast Asia.  Davis told Bowden it was his motto, and summed up his philosophy.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/pulloutt.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#P">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="pyewacket"><H1>Pyewacket</H1></A>A cat (felis catus, member of family Felidae).
