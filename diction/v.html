And somewhere out of my mother's imagination came the idea that Kate should learn the violin.  It seems to be a tradition that the violin is forced upon people -- I mean, there are few who take it up of their own volition!  And Kate was certainly one of those who took it up only under pressure.  So the piano was a way of exploring music in dimensions diametrically opposite to what the violin must have represented -- pure escapism!&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#V">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="violins"><H1>Violin (song)</H1></A>A song on the album <A HREF="n.html#neverfor">Never For Ever</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/violin.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#V">[Back to Index Page]</A><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="u.html">[Previous Page]</A> <A HREF="w.html">[Next Page]</A></DL></DL></BODY></HTML>
