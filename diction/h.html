The timbre of the sound is controlled by drawbars which add overtones to the fundamental sound.  By the time it turned thirty, the Hammond had become the sound of classic rock and roll.  The Hammond organ is played by <A HREF="m.html#mackay">Duncan Mackay</A> on the songs <A HREF="k.html#kite">Kite</A>, <A HREF="w.html#wuthering">Wuthering Heights</A> and <A HREF="j.html#james">James And The Cold Gun</A>, by <A HREF="m.html#monkman">Francis Monkman</A> on <A HREF="d.html#dontpush">Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake</A> and <A HREF="f.html#full">Fullhouse</A>, and by <A HREF="b.html#brooker">Gary Brooker</A> on <A HREF="a.html#andsoislove">And So Is Love</A>, <A HREF="c.html#constellation">Constellation Of The Heart</A>, and <A HREF="y.html#yto">You're The One</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="handsome"><H1>Handsome Cabin Boy, The</H1></A>A variation on a traditional song performed by Ewan MacColl, this song was released as the b-side of the single <A HREF="h.html#holsong">Hounds Of Love</A> in Britain, and on the <A HREF="h.html#holalt">Alternative Hounds Of Love</A> 12-inch single.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/thehands.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="hardiman"><H1>Hardiman, Paul</H1></A>Engineered mixes of the album <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A> at <A HREF="a.html#advision">Advision Studios</A>, provided the Eeyore effect on the song <A HREF="g.html#getout">Get Out Of My House</A>; engineer on the album <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="harley"><H1>Harley, Steve</H1></A>Leader of the group <A HREF="c.html#cockney">Cockney Rebel</A>, in a less well known credit Harley also provided vocals for the first version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical <CITE>The Phantom Of The Opera.</CITE>  Having donated half of Cockney Rebel to the recording of the album <A HREF="k.html#kickalbum">The Kick Inside</A>, Harley further gave of himself  on 12 May 1979 by appearing at a benefit concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in memory of the late <A HREF="d.html#duffield">Bill Duffield</A>, with whom Harley had worked in the past.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="harmonium"><H1>Harmonium</H1></A>A reed organ with compression bellows invented in the early 19th Century.

Starting as a painter whose work was displayed in the National Gallery in London in the late Fifties, Harris turned to performing at London's Downunder Club.  He eventually rose to national fame thanks to several successful comedic records, starting with <CITE>Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport,</CITE> which made the Top Ten on the British charts for nine weeks in 1960.  Subsequent singles include <CITE>Sun Arise,</CITE> <CITE>Johnny Day,</CITE> <CITE>Bluer Than Blue,</CITE> and <CITE>Two Little Boys.</CITE>  Following an appearance on the British children's television program <CITE>Jigsaw</CITE> Harris moved into a new career on television, hosting a variety of programs on the BBC, including <CITE>The Rolf Harris Show,</CITE> <CITE>It's Rolf On Saturday OK?,</CITE> <CITE>Cartoon Time,</CITE> <CITE>Rolf's Walkabout</CITE> and the followup <CITE>Rolf's Walkabout - 20 Years Down the Track,</CITE> <CITE>Rolf's Cartoon Club,</CITE> <CITE>Animal Hospital</CITE> and <CITE>Animal Hospital Week.</CITE>  In 1977, Rolf Harris was awarded the OBE, and in 1989 was awarded the Order of Australia.<P>His 1962 record <CITE>Sun Arise</CITE> had a profound influence on the song <A HREF="d.html#dreamsong">The Dreaming</A>, and Harris plays <A HREF="d.html#digeridu">digeridu</A> on that track.  <P>In 1980, presumably before work on <CITE>The Dreaming</CITE> commenced, Kate elaborated on her love of the track <CITE>Sun Arise</CITE>: <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;I wish Rolf would do some more musical ventures.  I think it's fantastic.  I mean, to be the discoverer of the wobble-board, and to be able to play the digeridu, and sing and write and draw.  He's a very talented man, he really is.  And I think he's very underestimated because of the areas he's got into now.  He's a sort of top television personality.  But it seems to me he's got a great deal of musical talent, and for me this track is just magic.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE> <P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="harvey"><H1>Harvey, Richard</H1></A>A musician who played recorders on the song <A HREF="o.html#england">Oh England My Lionheart</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="heads"><H1>Heads We're Dancing</H1></A>A song on the album <A HREF="s.html#tswa">The Sensual World</A>.  According to Kate, the lyrics were inspired by a friend's chance meeting with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904 - 1967), scientific leader of the Manhattan Project and father of the atomic bomb.  Unaware of the man's identity, this friend had been impressed with Oppenheimer's wit and charm, and was later considerably surprised to discover his role in history.  In the song, Kate evokes Hitler instead -- an ironic choice on many levels.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/headswer.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="hello"><H1>Hello Earth</H1></A>A song on the album <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A>.  Kate has described this song as &quot;a lullaby for the Earth.&quot; <CITE>Hello Earth</CITE> turns <A HREF="n.html#ninth">The Ninth Wave</A> upside-down, finding the protagonist on the water looking up at the stars, imagining herself up in the stars and looking down at the water.  Faced with gaping holes in the chorus after the verses were written, Kate borrowed a tune from the film <A HREF="n.html#nosferatu">Nosferatu</A>.  The tune is originally a traditional song called <CITE>Tsintskaro</CITE> (&quot;AtThe Spring&quot;) from the Kartli-Kakhetian province in the Republic of Georgia.<P>The message which can be heard immediately before the start of the song is as follows:<BLOCKQUOTE>1. voice: &quot;Columbia [Challenger?] now at nine times the speed of sound.&quot;<BR>2. voice: &quot;Roger that, Dan, I've got a solid TACAN locked on, uh, TACAN two and three.&quot;<BR>3. voice: &quot;The, uh, tracking data, map data and pre-planned trajectory are all one line on the block.&quot;<BR>4. voice: &quot;Show your block decode...&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>Parts of this message were deciphered by IED, Kevin Carosso and Weiland Willker.  Note: &quot;TACAN&quot; is a military navigational system, also used by the space shuttle. Assuming that the recordings are legitimate clips of communications with the NASA Space Shuttle, they must derive from mission STS-8, launched August 30, 1983, which was the only flight sufficiently prior to the 1985 release of the album including anyone onboard named &quot;Dan&quot; -- namely Daniel Brandenstein, who as pilot of the mission would be the person most likely to report flight data to the ground. That mission was flown on the orbiter Challenger, not Columbia.<P>At the end of the song, the words &quot;Tiefer, tiefer, irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht&quot; are recited by <A HREF="z.html#zangerl">Gabi Zangerl</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/helloear.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="henrylen"><H1>Henry, Lenny</H1></A>(b. 1958)  A British comedian and actor.

I just couldn't get near it.  I think the reward you get from her is in actually listening to her voice.  That is what is so beautiful about her, you can almost hear what she's been doing for the last three weeks.  Her singing is extraordinary.

Erich Weiss, 1874 - 1926)  An illusionist and escape artist.  Some of his most spectacular escapes were accomplished with the covert aid of his wife Bess, as when she passed a key to the bound Houdini by mouth, seeming only to be kissing the apparently doomed performer farewell -- as depicted in the song <A HREF="h.html#houdini">Houdini</A>, and on the cover of the album <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A>.  <P>Like many professional stage magicians and illusionists, Houdini was an outspoken skeptic of any claims of psychic ability or supernatural phenomena.  Prior to his death, Houdini and his wife agreed on a secret code phrase (&quot;Rosabel, believe!&quot;) he would use to contact her from beyond the grave, if there was in fact such a thing as an afterlife.  After his death, Bess said she had been given the code by a psychic, but later discovered that the man had obtained it from a former servant of Houdini's.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="houdini"><H1>Houdini (song)</H1></A>A song on the album <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A>, inspired by the life and death of <A HREF="h.html#harryh">Harry Houdini</A>.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/houdini.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="holalbum"><H1>Hounds Of Love (album)</H1></A>The fifth album by Kate Bush.  After the exorbitant studio costs of <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A>, this album was largely recorded and produced in Kate's own home studio.  She has said the album &quot;could never have been produced in a commercial setup.&quot;<P>An LP version of this album bears the additional line &quot;And a big woof for Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; Bonnie and Clyde were the two dogs seen with Kate in the front sleeve picture. Kate described in an interview that it took all day to get the dogs to settle down, and that when they first tried to take the shot Kate ended up with a dog's paw in her mouth and makeup that needed redoing. When the final picture was taken, one of the hounds actually fell asleep on her.<P>This album was reissued on vinyl by EMI in 1998, and also in an expanded CD edition with additional tracks and new liner notes.<P>This album is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/albums/hol.html"> Discography</A> section.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="holalt"><H1>Hounds Of Love, Alternative</H1></A>More than merely a remix, this is in fact a significantly different version of the song <A HREF="h.html#holsong">Hounds Of Love</A> with altered arrangements and alternative lyrics, released as a 12-inch single.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#H">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="holsong"><H1>Hounds Of Love (song)</H1></A>Title song of the album <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A>.
