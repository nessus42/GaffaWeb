In the years since then, he has crossed paths with Kate Bush several times.<P>In 1979, Gabriel recruited Kate to provide backing vocals for the songs <A HREF="n.html#noself">No Self Control</A> and <A HREF="g.html#games">Games Without Frontiers</A> on his third solo album, called <CITE>Peter Gabriel.</CITE>  (The album bears the same title as its two predecessors due to Gabriel's wish that his albums be regarded as if they were successive issues of a magazine, although this idea was subsequently abandoned.  To distinguish it from its predecessors, this album is sometimes called &quot;Melt&quot; or &quot;Melting Face&quot; in reference to the striking cover art.)  Kate's exposure to Gabriel's method of composing with a <A HREF="f.html#fairlight">Fairlight CMI</A> and a drum machine profoundly influenced her own approach to songwriting.<P>At around the same time, Gabriel appeared with Kate and <A HREF="h.html#harley">Steve Harley</A> at a memorial concert for <A HREF="d.html#duffield">Bill Duffield</A> at the Hammersmith Odeon on 12 May 1979.  At the end of the year, Gabriel made a guest appearance on the television special <A HREF="k.html#kate">Kate</A>, singing his own <CITE>Here Comes The Flood</CITE> and joining Kate for a cover version of the <A HREF="h.html#harper">Roy Harper</A> song <A HREF="a.html#anotherday">Another Day</A>.<P>Kate has joined Gabriel onstage at least once since then.  The two returned to the studio to record a new version of <CITE>Another Day</CITE> and a new song called <A HREF="i.html#ibiza">Ibiza</A>, but neither song has been released.  The only other recorded collaboration between the two which has been heard by the public is the song <A HREF="d.html#dontgiveup">Don't Give Up</A> on Gabriel's album <CITE>So.</CITE><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="gaffa"><H1>Gaffa</H1></A>A kind of sticky tape used by electricians.  The word &quot;Gaffa&quot; is a variant of &quot;Gaffer,&quot; which is in turn a corruption of &quot;grandfather&quot; and refers to the chief electrician on a film set.  Hence, &quot;Gaffer's tape&quot; or &quot;Gaffa tape.&quot;  <P>Congratulations!

Gambaccini subsequently interviewed her for the television program <CITE>Pebble Mill At One</CITE> on 29 October 1982.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="games"><H1>Games Without Frontiers</H1></A>Kate contributes backing vocals -- the distinctive refrain &quot;Jeux sans frontieres&quot; -- to this song on the album <A HREF="g.html#gabriel">Peter Gabriel</A>.  However, contrary to a widespread belief, Kate does <EM>not</EM> whistle on this track.  The whistling was done by the team of producer Steve Lillywhite, engineer <A HREF="p.html#padgham">Hugh Padgham</A>, and Gabriel himself.<P>This song is also listed in the <A HREF="../discog/songs/gameswit.html"> Discography</A> section.<P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="garfath"><H1>Garfath, Brian</H1></A>Director of the video for <A HREF="r.html#ruth">Running Up That Hill</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="garner"><H1>Garner, Alan</H1></A>(b. 1934) A British author and anthologist best known for his books for children, many of which are based in fantasy or mythology.   While his books are intended for young readers, they are in no way simplistic or childish; in fact, Garner's writing is more challenging, thoughtful, and psychologically cathartic than much so-called adult literature.  In an early issue of the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, Kate recommended Garner's &quot;Stone Quartet&quot; as wonderfully poetic examples of modern children's literature.  This was a series of four books: <CITE>The Stone Book</CITE> (1976), <CITE>Tom Fobble's Day</CITE> (1977), <CITE>Granny Reardun</CITE> (1977), and <CITE>The Aimer Gate</CITE> (1978), later published together as <CITE>The Stone Book Quartet</CITE> (1983).  These books are more simply written, and intended for a slightly younger audience than usual.  Unlike most of Garner's other works of fiction, the Stone books are not fantasy, but they contain his usual themes and, like the rest of his work, a great deal of semi-autobiographical material.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="gayfare"><H1>Gay Farewell</H1></A>This is a provisional title given to a demo version of a song which was never released.

George Gershwin was a performer as well as a composer, and often made appearances as a pianist playing his own compositions.

Terry Vance Gilliam, 22 November 1940) A member of the Monty Python troupe who has gone on to become a successful and innovative film director.  Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Gilliam quickly relocated first to Los Angeles and then New York, where he went to work for cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman, one of the creators of <CITE>Mad</CITE> magazine, on his new publication <CITE>Help!</CITE>  Working as a freelance illustrator and cartoonist, Gilliam moved to London, where he sold two comedy skits to a fledgling BBC children's program called <CITE>Do Not Adjust Your Set,</CITE> and later became resident animator on the program, a position which directly led to his involvement with Monty Python as both an animator and a performer.  When the group wished to take more control of their own work in films, Gilliam and fellow Python Terry Jones were tapped to co-direct the film <CITE>Monty Python And The Holy Grail.</CITE>  Gilliam's subsequent credits include the films <CITE>Jabberwocky,</CITE> <CITE>Time Bandits,</CITE> <A HREF="b.html#brazil">Brazil</A>, <CITE>The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen,</CITE> <CITE>The Fisher King,</CITE> and <CITE>Twelve Monkeys</CITE>; each of them are challenging and thoroughly entertaining, if sometimes bleak, films.  <P>For the soundtrack album of the film <CITE>Brazil,</CITE> Kate Bush recorded a version of the classic standard <CITE>Brazil,</CITE> but her version of the song was not used in the film itself.  Gilliam provided assistance with the video for the song <A HREF="c.html#cloudbusting">Cloudbusting</A>, and put Kate in touch with his film editor <A HREF="d.html#doyle">Julian Doyle</A>, who directed the video.  Gilliam has since offered support and technical assistance on Kate's own directorial efforts, including <A HREF="l.html#tltctc">The Line The Cross And The Curve</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="gilmour"><H1>Gilmour, Dave</H1></A>Guitarist, currently leader of Pink Floyd.  Introduced to Kate's early home demos by his Cambridge friend <A HREF="h.html#hopper">Ricky Hopper</A>, Gilmour recorded demos with Kate at his own home studio in 1973: songs recorded at this time include <A HREF="p.html#passing">Passing Through Air</A> and <A HREF="m.html#maybe">Maybe</A>.  In 1975, Gilmour produced further demo recordings at <A HREF="a.html#air">AIR Studios</A> in London, at his own expense.  These songs were another version of <CITE>Maybe,</CITE> plus <A HREF="s.html#saxophone">Saxophone Song</A> and <A HREF="m.html#manwith">The Man With The Child In His Eyes</A>, which were included on the album <A HREF="k.html#kickalbum">The Kick Inside</A>. While recording the album <CITE>Wish You Were Here</CITE> with Pink Floyd, Gilmour played this tape for <A HREF="m.html#mercer">Bob Mercer</A> of EMI, and was instrumental in securing Kate's recording contract with the label.<P>In later years his public association with Kate was less frequent.  Gilmour contributed backing vocals to the song <A HREF="p.html#pull">Pull Out The Pin</A>, and appeared live with Kate at <A HREF="s.html#third">The Secret Policeman's Third Ball</A> concert in 1987, performing the song <A HREF="r.html#ruth">Running Up That Hill</A>.  For the album <A HREF="s.html#tswa">The Sensual World</A>, Gilmour played guitar on the songs <A HREF="l.html#laa">Love And Anger</A> and <A HREF="r.html#rocketstail">Rocket's Tail</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#G">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="glc"><H1>GLC</H1></A>One of the best of the series of <A HREF="c.html#comicstrip">Comic Strip</A> television films produced for Britain's Channel Four, this 1989 production recasts the British Government's decision to shut down the Greater London Council as a Hollywood action film with Brigitte Neilsen as Margaret Thatcher and Charles Bronson as GLC Leader &quot;Red&quot; Ken Livingstone!  In fact, Jennifer Saunders plays Neilsen playing Thatcher, and <A HREF="c.html#coltrane">Robbie Coltrane</A> plays Bronson in the role of Livingstone.  <A HREF="f.html#french">Dawn French</A> rounds out the cast playing Cher in the role of nuclear disarmament advocate Joan Ruddock, who here provides a love interest for Red Ken.<P>Kate's compositions for the soundtrack complete the illusion by parodying a Hollywood style film score, including the over-the-top theme song <A HREF="k.html#ken">Ken</A>, the climactic battle of <A HREF="c.html#confront">The Confrontation</A>, and the closing <A HREF="o.html#onelast">One Last Look Around The House Before We Go</A>.
