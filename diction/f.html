On the Fairlight CMI, sounds could be digitally sampled from sources in real life, edited, or even created whole by drawing a sound wave on the monitor screen with a lightpen.  This versatility did not come cheap -- when first introduced, the Fairlight CMI sold for $27,750 American.  As a result of its expense and difficulty of use, this instrument has always been for the privileged few rather than the majority, but its sophistication and versatility have kept it a valuable tool nearly fifteen years after its invention -- something which cannot be said about most synthesizers, which tend to become obsolete in a much shorter period.<P>Kate first began using the Fairlight on the album <A HREF="n.html#neverfor">Never For Ever</A>, having been introduced to it through her collaboration with <A HREF="g.html#gabriel">Peter Gabriel</A>.  By the time of the albums <A HREF="d.html#dreamalbum">The Dreaming</A> and <A HREF="h.html#holalbum">Hounds Of Love</A> it had become her primary writing tool, pushing aside the piano.  In addition, <A HREF="m.html#mackay">Duncan Mackay</A> used the Fairlight on the songs <A HREF="a.html#allweever">All We Ever Look For</A> and <A HREF="a.html#army">Army Dreamers</A>, and <A HREF="d.html#downes">Geoff Downes</A> used it to create the stirring trumpet sounds on the song <A HREF="s.html#siyl">Sat In Your Lap</A>.<P>Kate Bush on the hardships of using the Fairlight: &quot;I used to programme it myself, but since the new software...I can't keep up.  They keep changing it as soon as I learn to programme it.&quot;<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#F">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="farrell"><H1>Farrell, Gordon</H1></A>Credited with &quot;Houdini&quot; on the song <A HREF="h.html#houdini">Houdini</A>; the line &quot;Rosabel Believe&quot; is spoken by <A HREF="p.html#palmer">Del Palmer</A>.<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="list.html#F">[Back to Index Page]</A><A NAME="fast"><H1>Fast, Larry</H1></A>A British keyboard player who has released several albums under the appelation Synergy, in addition to extensive session work supporting artists such as <A HREF="e.html#eno">Brian Eno</A> and <A HREF="g.html#gabriel">Peter Gabriel</A>.
