So, what do you do? There, on the stall at the record-fair sits <I>"The Kick Inside"</I> picture disc. Can you really justify spending £50-60 on it? What if it's the second pressing and not the original issue? Hey, wait a minute! Nobody told me there were two pressings! How do I tell the difference? Does it really matter? Well, it doesn't really matter I suppose, unless they're asking the original's price for the second pressing. Price-wise the first pressing is generally worth £10-20 more than the re-issue. And the same certainly goes for some of Kate's early British singles. So, here's a small guide...</P>

<P>
 Apart from these differences, all <I>The Single File</I> singles are in paper-type sleeves rather than the card of the originals, so that should give you a clue when buying.</P>
