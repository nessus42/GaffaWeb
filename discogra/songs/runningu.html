 After a deafening silence of many years, aside from 'The Single
File' box-set and accompanying video, Kate returned to the popscene, with what was to be her most important release since her 'Wuthering Heights'-debut&#133; .

  It had been almost three years since her last single, and even
longer since her last hit, so a big chart-success was needed. To bring Kate back to the top, and to silence all the critics who had been labelling her a has-been ever since the failure of 'There Goes A Tenner', and of course the album 'The Dreaming', which,at least from a commercial point of view, hadn't exactly lived up to its high expectations.</P>

 The single was released in August 1985, and most fans and critics
alike seemed very impressed.. .</P>

   'Running Up That Hill' entered the charts at nine, to reach
its highest position of number 3 a few weeks later. The appearances
on 'Top Of The Pops', 'Wogan' and different satellite TV-shows
certainly helped the promotion, as did the enormous media-attention
Kate's return had provoked. &quot;Bush blossoms in love&quot;
The Sun shouted from its front-page, and who could blame them?
Kate was back, and the world ought to know about it.</P></FONT>

  Thanks to the generous airplay on American alternative stations,
the single even managed to break into the Top 40 in The States,
thus finally introducing the American public to Kate Bush and
laying the foundations of a whole new fanbase.</P>

  Basically the song is about two people who are very much in
love. So much that they find it impossible to cope and are both
scared of losing eachother. If only they could swap places to
know how the other was feeling, perhaps that could take away many
fears and insecurities. To a point, the song can also be seen
as a way of trying to overcome the fundemental differences between
a man and a women, and the communication-barriers between the
two.</P>

   Musically, this is a very deep song, full of atmosphere and
emotion. It has a hook-line that slowly creeps into your unconscious
mind until you can't stop singing it. The production is thick
and heavy, with layer upon layer of music, and Kate's voice bursting
out from underneath it. The synthesizers are very 80's, and probably
the only concession Kate has ever made to modern music, but of
course not without adapting it to suit her own unique style. A
12&quot; version of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was released
as well. The extended remix only adds to the depth and intensity
of the original </P>

'Running Up That Hill' had  Kate back at the top where she belonged, and in eager anticipation, fans and critics waited for the release of "Hounds Of Love".. An album that was to be another big milestone in Kate's career</P>
