The most illustrious of all the highly-praised demo-recordings, also happens to be the most bizarre of
the bunch. Rather graphically telling the story of a relationship between a boy and girl that
dramatically ends when they both get killed in a car crash, it sounds very macabre, and the spooky,
intense, almost Lynchesque, atmosphere lingers long after the song is finished... . </FONT>

Musically this is the kind of song that would be most fitting on a Diamanda Galas-album. A grim,
disturbing, masterpiece, featuring the deep voice of John Carder Bush reading his own poetry,
combined with Kate's shrill but somehow soothing vocals singing the chorus... . </P>

'Organic Acid' is nothing like anything Kate has ever done, and possibly she will never do anything
like it again...  It's the closest she ever came to goth, and in spite of its hardhitting intensity and the
general feeling of unease that almost chokes you when listening to this song, it's still a wonderful work of art.
And one that shows us yet another side of Kate's versatility as a singer/songwriter...</FONT>
