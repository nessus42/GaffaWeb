<FONT SIZE=5> 'Wuthering
Heights' had reached number one in Britain and achieved a huge
hit-status all over the world (except for the Americas where it
took until 1985 to get Kate really noticed) and so EMI were left
with the monstrous task of choosing a follow-up.

<FONT SIZE=5>    Their first choice, it appears,
was the catchy 'Them Heavy People'. But Kate herself decided she
preferred 'The Man With The Child In His Eyes' to be the next
single. She found it important to show the listeners the versatility
of her work. Or as she put it herself: &quot;I'd like people to
listen to it as a songwriting-song as opposed to something weird,
which was the reaction to 'Wuthering Heights'. That's why this
matters so much to me and why I want the song to do well&quot;.

<FONT SIZE=5>  Some people say that this
is the nearest Kate ever came to writing a standard pop-type love
song. This track is indeed totally opposite to 'Wuthering Heights'.
Some people found it very hard to believe that this was the very
same girl who only a few weeks earlier had been singing about
Cathy's lost love in that very shrill voice&#133; . Which is of
course exactly the way Kate wanted it: &quot;If the next song
had been similar, I would have been labelled and that something
I really don't want. As soon as you get a label, you can't do
anything. I prefer to take a risk, and keep my artistic freedom.&quot;</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>   It is rumoured that &quot;The
Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; was  written when Kate was
just twelve, and recorded when she was 16. Even now, the lyrics
are still scribbled somewhere on a wall at 'East Wickham Farm&quot;
or so we're told.. &quot;The Man&#133;&quot; was in fact one of
the many tracks on the demo-tape that got Kate her recording-contract.
The track is the same as on the 'The Kick Inside'-album, with
the 'he's here, he's here'-vocals added later&#133; .

<FONT SIZE= 5>   The song itself is a slow
and sensual ballad. A swooning song, with a hint of nostalgia
thrown in for good measure. And also a simple song, based just
around the piano and Kate's warm voice. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>    The story behind it deals
with the love of a young girl for an older man. He could be someone
she's infatuated with - a teacher or a popstar perhaps. He could
be a lover. Or then again, he could be just a figment of her imagination.
That's for the listener to decide.

<FONT SIZE=5>    The video was very simple
and, like the other early ones, directed by Keif. It seems  as if
Kate is floating on the screen in a mass of white clouds, but
actually she's sitting on a perspex box to give that impression.
The movements were all her own idea, with added creative input from her brother John. Basically, Kate had the idea of someone sitting
down and telling someone something secret.  And of course the
video also saw the debut of the now famous lurex cat-suit that
at the time seemed to receive even more press-attention than the
song itself&#133; . </P>

go by unnoticed, and all the critics seemed to like it. Well, almost... :

<FONT SIZE=5> 'The Man With The Child
In His Eyes' got to number 6 in the British charts, and has since
then been the subject of many cover versions.. Dave Smith And
Judy Denny, Dusty Springfield and Natalie Cole to name just a

word about the song that not only consolidated the success of
her hit-debut but also proved her versatility as a singer/songwriter:

she herself knows if he really exists.&quot;</I>
