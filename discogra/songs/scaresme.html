One of the later demos, "Scares Me Silly", is a happy, upbeat song, with hints of "Passing Through Air" shining through. It's only one of the few demo-recordings to feature backing vocals.</FONT>

In this track, Kate describes the emotions she goes through while recording in the studio. The nerves, the sparkle in her stomach, the exhaustion when they can't get the take just right and have to try it over and over again... And finally the anxiety: will people like this? <CITE>Don't even know you, but I need you to love me too</CITE>
