This song was recorded in the Garden, Kent, and originally released on 20 November 1989 as a B-side to the "This Woman's Work 12" single in the U.K.</FONT>

With its raw vocals (the rawest since "Get Out Of My House") and hippy-dippy allure, "I'm Still Waiting" is one of those songs you either love or hate... . One of its stronger points is definitely  the nifty piano sample married to the kick drum. I'll admit it takes a while to grow on you, and it's what I'll call a typical B-side from the later days... Perhaps "Reaching Out" would have sounded like this in a rough, early-demo, stage. </FONT>

 A song about emotions, where Kate is experiencing rather than being the story-teller, and in that way it fits in perfectly with this phase of her music. After all, isn't "The Sensual World" her most sensitive album?
