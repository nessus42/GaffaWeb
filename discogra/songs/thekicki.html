Having been translated into English by Professor Grundtuig, "Lizzie Wan", an old Danish folk ballad, first appeared in Hurd's Scottish Songs 1776. Two hundred years later, the same ballad was to inspire Kate to compose one of her most haunting masterpieces: 'The Kick Inside'... <CITE>'Welling eyes from identifying with Lizzie Wan's story' </CITE></FONT>

For 'The Kick Inside', Kate has slightly romanticized the plot. The title-track of her debut-album tells the story of an incestuous relationship between a brother and a sister, that ends dramatically when the sister finds herself pregnant and decides the only way to save her and her brother's honour is by committing suicide. In the original text the unfortunate sister finds her death when her brother saves her the trouble of killing herself by chopping off her head.. : </P>

Lizzie Wan sits at her father's bower-door<BR>
weeping and making a mane<BR>
and by there came her father dear<BR>
'What ails thee, Lizzie Wan?'<BR>
<BR>
'I ail, and I ail, dear father' she said<BR>
'and I'll tell you the reason for why<BR>
there's a child between my tow sides<BR>
between my dear Billy and I'<BR>
<BR>
Now Lizzie Wan sits at her father's bower-door<BR>
sighing and making a mane<BR>
and by there came her brother dear<BR>
'What ails thee, Lizzie Wan?'<BR>
<BR>
'I ail, I ail, dear brother' she said<BR>
'and I'll tell you the reason for why<BR>
there is a child between my two sides<BR>
between you, dear Billy, and I'<BR>
<BR>
'And hast thou tald father and mother o that<BR>
and hast thou tald sae o me?'<BR>
and he has drawn his gude braid sward<BR>
that hang down by his knee<BR>
<BR>
And he has cutted off Lizzie Wan's head<BR>
and her fair body in three<BR>
and he's awa to his mother's bower<BR>
and sair aghast was she<BR>
<BR>
'What ails thee, what ails thee, Geordy Wan?<BR>
What ails thee sae fast to rin<BR>
for I see by thy ill colour<BR>
some fallows dead thou hast done'<BR>
<BR>
'Some fallows dead I have done mother<BR>
and I pray you pardon me<BR>
for I've cutted off my greyhound's head<BR>
he wadna rin for me'<BR>
<BR>
'The greyhound's blood was never si red<BR>
o my son Geordy Wan!<BR>
for I see by thy ill colour<BR>
some fallows dead thou hast done' <BR>
<BR>
'Some fallows dead I have done mother<BR>
and I pray you pardon me<BR>
for I've cutted off Lizzie Wan's head<BR>
and her fair body in three'<BR>
<BR>
'O what wilt thou do when thy father comes home<BR>
o my son Geordy Wan?'<BR>
'I'll set my foot on a bottomless boat<BR>
and swim to the sea-ground'<BR>
<BR>
'And when will thou come home again,<BR>
o my son Geordy Wan?'<BR>
'The sun and the moon, shall dance on the green<BR>
that night when I come home'<BR>

Musically, 'The Kick Inside' features Kate on piano, and using her voice as a powerful instrument to express melancholy as well as anguish.</P>

'Two In One Coffin' was one of two poems composed and recited by John Carder Bush for the British leg of Kate's 1979 'The Tour Of Life'... Used as an introduction  for 'The Kick Inside', the poem was accompanied by the pre-recorded sound of whispers, groans, and sobbing.. It most definitely added an extra dimension to the song and its startling performance.</FONT>

Turn away from the darkness<BR>
and taste the steel and water<BR>
of the wild fruit<BR>
lest the wasp rest for a moment<BR>
on the down of your arm<BR>
leave the dagger forever<BR>
tucked in your girdle<BR>
dull and warm<BR>
it's in two places<BR>
untouched by the sun<BR>
you and I<BR>
are now alive inside you<BR>
lay your head down<BR>
so that I can smell<BR>
the crushed acorns<BR>
and chestnuts in your hair<BR>
remember that certain feeling<BR>
that you know<BR>
what I know<BR>
and words will always drop away<BR>
like useless clothes<BR>
the earth must not have your blood<BR>
it must not have it<BR>
don't make me see<BR>
two in one coffin<BR>
<I>in one coffin</I><BR>
two in one coffin<BR>
<I>two in one coffin</I><BR>
sound of breath<BR>
shimmer of space<BR>
scream of birth<BR>
song of our star<BR>
sign of haste<BR>
