In July and August of 1979, something was happening in 'Air' Studios. Kate Bush and Jon Kelly were picking and remixing four tracks for the forthcoming release of a live Ep. One of those songs was "Them Heavy People". It was also the one that was picked as 'airplay'-track and got its own video to be shown on "Top Of The Pops".

"Them Heavy People" is arguably the most cheerful song Kate has ever done, with its catchy opening line 'Rolling The Ball' that you simply can't stop humming, even after the first listen.</FONT>

The song sees Kate singing the praises of human beings...: <CITE>"We humans got it all, we perform the miracles.."</CITE>. Everybody can do what they want as long as they listen and believe.. <CITE>"They made me look at myself"</CITE>..  and take notice of people who are older and wiser.. <CITE>"Break me emotionally, it's nearly killing me</CITE>... The quest for knowledge is a long, hard, and often painful road. <CITE>Oh what a lovely feeling</CITE>. But in the end, it will be worth it.. </FONT>

Kate has said about writing the song:<CITE>"It has lots of different people and ideas and things in it and they came to me amazingly easy because, in a way, so much of it was happening to me at the time."</CITE>. She also said: <CITE>"I always had the feeling it should be a single. But I never liked the album-version much. It should be more loose, you know? It's very much of a human song."</CITE>...
