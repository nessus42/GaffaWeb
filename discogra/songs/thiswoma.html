This song first saw the light of day around May 1987. It was to be used in the soundtrack of the new John Hughes film "She's Having A Baby". The soundtrack was released in the States on IRS, and has now long been deleted... </FONT>

In the context of the story, the song comes at the climax of the film. In fact it is the very first and only serious moment in what is in fact a very light-hearted movie. John Hughes' comments on Kate and the song were: <CITE> "Kate wrote a beautiful song for the ending. I sent her the scene, she watched it, she wrote it... I think it's the first time I've ever had lyrics hit certain cuts in the film."</CITE>. The film was a moderate success in the States, but not as big as previous Hughes-productions, and for a while there were talks of releasing 'This Woman's Work' as a single. But at the time, this didn't happen. In Europe, "She's Having A Baby" had its name changed to "He Said, She Said" and went straight on to video-release, never even making it to the cinema... Needless to say the film as well as the song went by practically unnoticed</FONT>

Kate herself said of the song, when interviewed by <B>International Musician</B> and <B>N.M.E</B>: <CITE>"I wrote the song to the film, and it was one of the quickest things I'd ever done. I really enjoyed being asked to do it... . The song is really self-exploring his sadness and the sudden realisation that he has to grow up."</CITE>

Finally, on November 20th 1989, EMI decided to release 'This Woman's Work' as a single. The second one to be taken from Kate's sixth studio-album 'The Sensual World'. </FONT>

The video for 'This Woman's Work' was another moving, brilliantly done, mini-film, starring Tim McInnery of 'Blackadder'-fame... . It starts with Kate alone at the piano, as the storyteller, and this particular tale has begun.. We see the husband, waiting for news, and trying desperately to control his emotions while he falls back in time, to the happy moments of his life, with his wife there laughing, comforting him... . Why can't he be there for her now? Then, suddenly he comes back to reality, and his mind is full of thoughts about the events that brought him to this place.. The hospital waiting-room.. . Then, in the final scene, he comes back to reality again, and this time there's a nurse standing over him. She smiles. Relieved that everything will be okay after all, he loses control over his feelings... . Then the piano-lid closes, and the storyteller is faded into darkness..
The video for "This Woman's Work" is definitely the most moving one Kate has ever done, even more so than that for "Cloudbusting"... </FONT>

Sadly, the single didn't quite become the success everyone had hoped for, crawling up the charts and stopping at 25 before sliding down again.. Perhaps the public wasn't ready, perhaps again the lack of promotion prevented the song from getting the necessary exposure and airplay, maybe the timing wasn't right? But regardless of chart-success, or rather the lack of it, "This Woman's Work" remains one of Kate's best songs to date, and it also showed that in a hit-parade full of dance-fodder, S/A/W and cover-versions, there was still room and recognition for an original talent.
