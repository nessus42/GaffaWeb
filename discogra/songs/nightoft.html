A couple of the songs on 'The Dreaming' seem to draw heavily from film noir.  'Night of the Swallow' being a good example. The female is straight out of the awesome <I>Barbara Stanwyck</I>-mould of Double Indemnity.  She's a domineering, passionate 
woman who not only doesn't want her lover to risk his life trafficking 
refuges because of the danger to him, but also because she'd rather have him with her instead.

This song was really the first where Kate's love for traditional Irish folk-music started showing through, with the combination of the 'Fairlight' and that amazing Irish music, creating a most spinechilling effect.</P>

The single was only ever released in Ireland, where it, unfortunately didn't do much chartwise. However, the original picture sleeve is now very much a cherished collectors'item and could fetch up to £150 on a good day...</P>

When asked whether she would ever consider bringing 'Night Of The Swallow' to the stage, complete with traditional Irish folk-musicians, Kate replied:
<CITE>'Oh, Planxty, wouldn't that be great! That would be fabulous. It would be incredibly difficult to do songs like that without Irish
musicians'</CITE>.

From talking to lots of fans and reading lots of fanzines, it seems that the overwhelming opinion is that 'Night Of The Swallow' is Kate's best song.  I tend to agree... Its intensity and passion go straight to the bone, along with the lingering desperation woven through the highly emotional lyrics.. .
