<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>When 'Sat In Your Lap' was released, it was a new
and exciting time for Kate's fans, as her music was going in a
completely new direction, and for those fans who were willing
to go along with Kate on this journey to new sounds, the rewards
were plenty.</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5> Kate said of the song:<I>&quot;I was really  frightened about this track for a long time. I mixed the song and played
it to people and there was complete silence afterwards. Or someone
would say that they liked it to me, and then go away and say what
they really thought&quot;.</I></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>From the opening beats,
the song is pushed along at a frightening speed, and you are barely
able to take in the lyrics. What you do take in, are the pounding
drums, the striking piano, and Kate's sweeping vocal performance&#133;. This was definitely a side of her that we had never seen before, and as far as style goes, people were already starting to wonder whether it had been her ambition all along, to become a female version of Adam Ant.

<FONT SIZE=5> Another thing, that was rather different about
'Sat InYour Lap' was that it was quite danceable, thanks to the
urgent beat of the drums. And indeed, this had been Kate's
intention as she later said in an interview: <I>'I'm starting
to connect my dancing to my music more. It's surprising, but in
the past I don't think I've been able to grasp the concept of
rhythm properly..'

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
               OoOoO

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>The song is all about
searching for knowledge, wanting more, seing things work for others
and wanting them to work for you to.. Or as Kate herself put it:<I>'It's
all about the quest for knowledge. Realising you actually don't
know anything at all. It's important to be reminded, sometimes,
that you're insignificant and stupid'.

<FONT SIZE=5>The video was filmed
in just two days, partly in a video-studio, and partly at 'Abby
Road'. The clip sees Kate looking very pretty, dressed in a white
tutu complete with pink leg-warmers wrapped around both her arms
and legs. And then there's of course also the infamous dunce-cap&#133;
. It would be an understatemnt to describe the video as hyperactive,
seeing there are a thousand things going on all over the place
and most of them make very little or no sense to me.. However,
having said that, it still remains one of my favourites.

<FONT SIZE=5>The critics'views on Kate's latest single were,
as usual, rather mixed:</P>

<FONT SIZE=5>The Friday before the release, the single was previewed
on BBC Radio 1's &quot;Round Table&quot;. Everyone on the show
seemed to be in favour of it, and Rick Wakeman even went so far
as to compare it to Bowie's classic 'Ashes To Ashes'.<BR>
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>The video was shown on 'Top Of The Pops', well
half of it anyway. Kate also appeared on &quot;Razzmatazz&quot;
and &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Fit&quot; to furher aid the promotion.

<FONT SIZE=5>'Sat In Your Lap' got to number eleven in Britain,
and all in all it was a very important release for Kate. The ending
of one phase and the beginning of another. One question, however,
as yet remained unanswered&#133; Would everyone be ready for &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;?</P>
