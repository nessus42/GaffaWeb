When the single for 'The Dreaming' had failed to make any significant impact on
the British charts (it hadn't even entered the top 40), another
single was needed, and more importantly one that would bring Kate
another hit.

In England 'There Goes
A Tenner' was chosen as the next release. A rather odd choice,
seeing the more catchy and commercial 'Suspended In Gaffa' had
been issued in just about every other country. But 'There Goes
A Tenner' it was to be.. .

<FONT SIZE=5>   This song had been the quickest
of all the 'Dreaming'-tracks to be completed, and it was also
one of the few songs to remain contained on one twenty-four track
tape instead of two&#133; The majority of the backing tracks were
recorded with Nick at The Townhouse, and as all of the other songs
of 'The Dreaming', 'Tenner' has to be played loud.

<FONT SIZE=5>   The single was released
on Nov 2nd, 1984, and previous to that Kate had already promoted
it on two occasions. The first being 'Razzmatazz' on September
21st, where Kate performed the single in the studio, with the
help of two male dancers. Then, the second programme was 'Pebble
Mill At One'. Kate was interviewed by Paul Gambicni and a snippet
of the video got its first (and last) airing on British television...

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>  The video was a very simply
but brilliantly done production, telling the song's story quite
perfectly&#133; . Especially the swinging of the pendulum is very
effective as well as visually appealing. It's a real pity this
clip hardly left the archives, and is now hidden away discreetly
on the 'The Single File' video.. .

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Maybe the great gap between
the promotion of the single and the actual release, plus the fact
that the very little promotion done had been on a children's tea
time show and a lunch time magazine broadcast (hardly peek viewing
for the average record-buyer/rock fan) had something to do with
the fact that 'There Goes A Tenner' came and went by practically
unnoticed.. . EMI also didn't promote it. No displays in the record-shops,
no ads in the music press, not a fly-poster to be seen&#133; Most
people probably didn't even know the single was out&#133; . <BR>

up on it though, and here's what they had to say:<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>It would be a great understatement
to say that &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; was ignored by radio-stations
(it didn't even make the Friday Night review programme) and record-buyers
alike. Barely entering the charts at number 93, then sliding down
to 95, before vanishing completely&#133; . It was Kate's first
real chart flop, and one that had many vicious voices whispering
things like 'She's a has-been' and 'She'll never have another
hit again'.. How wrong they all turned out to be, when a few years
later they were forced to eat their words with the release of
'Running Up That Hill'&#133; . </FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Finally, here's what Kate
had to say about the song, which just for the record, still remains
one of my 'The Dreaming'-favourites:<BR>
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>  <I>&quot;In that song, the
idea is that of everyone's amateur robbers, so it's like maybe
they get a bit cocky.. I dunno I've never done a robbery but I
think that in a situation like that you'd almost try to be like
the person you admire most, so perhaps they'd be like James Cagney
and George Raft. That idea was nothing really deep, it was just
handy. The real challenge of the song was to make it in a story,
but also keep it in a thirties tune&quot;&#133; . <BR>
