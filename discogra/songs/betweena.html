'Between a Man and a Woman' is the seventh track on 'The Sensual World', and deals with the delicate balance that exists between two people in a relationship, and how such a balance can be disturbed by an
interfering, if well-meaning, third person.  Kate once explained in an interview that the song emerged from a line from The Godfather, which says <CITE>"...don't interfere, it's Between a Man and a Woman."</CITE> It's exploring the idea of trying to keep a relationship together, to prevent outside forces or Western Pressures from breaking into it.

'Between A Man And A Woman' received a lot of mixed reviews, from both fans and critics alike. Some claimed that it was simply too accessible, both musically and lyrically. Where was the poetry? Where was the magic? And most of all, where was Kate?

 Anyone over the age of 16 can relate to a song like
"Between a Man and a Woman", and it was nothing like the weird territories Kate had explored before.. . There were no elves, no goblins, no whirling Dervishes... It was a simple, straight-forward song about relationships. Saying really nothing new about the subject-matter, where Kate had always had a way of making you see a situation in a way you never would have looked at it before. And whether that be a strength or a weakness of this song, I guess, is for the listener to decide... .
