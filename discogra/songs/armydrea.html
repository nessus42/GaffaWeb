The album 'Never Forever' had entered the British chart at number one (being the first ever album by a female artist to do so), and two singles had already been lifted off it. On September 22nd, "Army Dreamers" became the third.</P>

After "Breathing" with its thought-provoking lyrics and video, this was another controversial song, dealing with death. Telling the story of a mother whose son was killed in battle, it expresses sadness, regret, as well as the underlying question already asked so many times - "War, what is it good for?".. . </P>

The Lyrics were sung against what could best be described as an Irish waltz, and with Kate singing in an Irish accent. So, does that mean the situation in Northern Ireland served as inspiration for the song? "Not really" Kate was quick to reply when asked by an interviewer, "It's not specifically about Ireland. It's just putting across the case of the mother in those circumstances.. A mother who through the death of her son questions her own motherhood."

The very moving lyrics and contrasting gentle tune, make "Army Dreamers" a bitter-sweet song, and one of the most heartwrenching of Kate's entire repertoire. </P>

The critics, however, didn't seem too impressed, and decided to give it the collective 'thumbs down', a few exceptions aside:</P>

<FONT SIZE=5> Accompanying the single, was a video of Kate in full army combat gear, taking on the part of the mother. The loss and desperation portrayed in such a simple way, ending in the battlefield scene that goes dramatically wrong, only add to the strength of the song... </P>

 For a long time Kate considered this clip to be the best one she had ever made.. ."From an artistic point of view, it's the closest I ever came to a little bit of film, and it was very pleasing for me to make. Finally I video I can really be proud of... ".

Helped by the many TV-appearances, as well as generous airplay, "Army Dreamers" got to number 16 in the UK, and became a minor hit in continental Europe... At the same time, "Never Forever" was still holding strong, and as Kate's horizons widened even more, the groundbreaking "The Dreaming" was just around the corner... . </P>
