<FONT SIZE=5>Kate's 4 th  single
release - and the second one from 'Lionheart' - saw the light
on March 9, 1979, but the story of 'Wow' goes back a lot further
than that.. .

<FONT SIZE=5>Between the 18 th 
and the 21 st  of February, Kate had been in Luzern,
Switzerland, where she took part in the recording of  the Abba-Tv-Special
(best known for the barefoot-in-the-snow version of 'Wow'), and
also recorded the routine to her forthcoming video&#133; .

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Needless to say the press were
there, and in typically British tradition they went wild, over
what they considered to be a sexy shocker.  'It's Kate Bush scaling
erotic heights with her new song' The Daily Express-headline screamed;
'She's the hottest thing on stage' the Daily Mail declared; in
The Sun, the header 'Wow Is The Word' caught everyone's attention..

<FONT SIZE=5> Somewhere between the 20 th 
and the 26 th , the final video was  made back in Britain.
Directed by Keef and recorded at 'Wiltons Music Hall' in East
London. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>     On March 3rd, Kate's tour
was announced to the music press., adding even more to the media-circus..
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>    All the publicity could
only benefit the new single of course, as Kate seemed to be everywhere..
Magazine-covers, radio, local and national press&#133; . And television..
.On March 5th, Kate's video got its TV-debut on 'The
Kenny Everett Show'..  Several television-appearances followed,
including a 'Musical Chairs'-special about the making of 'Wow'.
Both Kate and Keef were interviewed, and this particular programme
is also the only time Kate has ever been seen smoking in public.
Something she later regretted, as she tries to avoid being photographed
cigarette in hand.</FONT>

 <FONT SIZE=5>Then, March 9th 
finally saw the single's official release. Most of the reviewers
seemed to like it,  a few confused exceptions aside:</P>

<FONT SIZE=5>   'Wow' entered the chart at
61, and after many more TV- and radio-appearances, including the
screening of the above mentioned Abba-special, it peaked at number
14. Despite the fact that the BBC had deemed it unsuitable for
its younger viewers and refused to show it on 'Top Of The Pops'
or any other programme, apart from the occasional fragment&#133;
.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>   The original video can still
be found on 'The Single File', but for 'The Whole Story', Kate
decided to make a new one..<CITE> &quot;I don't really like the promo
we did for 'Wow'. I think it's silly. And also the tour is a big
part of the story, was a big part of my career. I felt I should
include something about that.&quot;..</CITE> So, that's why on 'The Whole
Story', the original 'Wow' has been replaced by excerpts from
the tour.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>  A lot has been said about
the song. At the time, many people claimed it to be a criticism
of homosexuals, but this of course is way off track&#133; Kate
herself explains the story as an observation of the shady side
of show-business. Starlets sleeping their way to the top, but
never getting there; Producers saying how fantastic someone is,
but never really meaning it; Actors waiting for that one big break
that never comes&#133; Or as Kate put it herself<I> &quot;It can
be a very hard and treacherous world out there&quot;</I>&#133; .
