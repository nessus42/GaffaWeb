"The Dreaming" ends with the angst-ridden "Get Out of My House," in which Kate uses the house-analogy to describe the innermost enclaves of her being: <CITE>This house is full of  madness...This house is full of mistakes.</CITE>

Inspired by the film "The Shining" - based on that infamous Stephen King-book and starring the inimitable Jack Nicholson, "Get Out Of My House", can easily be called Kate's first angry song. "The Wedding List" in a sense was angry too, but still a lot more distant, as it was obvious that Kate was just taking on a role, guiding us through another one of her stories... The anger in "Get Out Of My House", on the other hand, is completely different. It grabs you by the throat. Not very unlike "The Shining" itself, which is easily one of the scariest films I've ever seen... </FONT>

During an interview, Kate had the following to say about the song:<CITE>"It's really fun to write from the point of view of someone who's really <EM>angry</EM>, like in "Get Out of My House" on the last album. Because I very rarely show anger, although obviously I do sometimes feel it.. . "Out of My House" and "Leave It Open" too are attempts to analyse very complex personal emotions... This is definitely not an album to play why you're doing the dishes</CITE></FONT>

I've always found "Get Out Of My House" to be Kate's exorcising song, where she lets out a lot of deep, long bottled up, feelings of anger, sadness, disappointment. The song where she finally breaks free from the limits others set her, be it the press, the record-company, people around her... . In fact, I couldn't think of a better song to close one of the best and most ground-breaking albums of the 80's... </FONT>
