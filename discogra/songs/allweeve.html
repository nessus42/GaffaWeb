<FONT SIZE=5>'All We Ever Look For', one of the most sensitive
tracks on the 'Never Forever'-album, sees Kate questioning the
roots of our many philosophies. Our parents simply looked to us,
their children, to give their lives meaning, and now we are breaking
down over anxieties they never even have the leisure to think
about. Maybe it's all just a matter of self-indulgence, wallowing
in self-pity&#133; <I>'Leave the breast and then the nest, and
then regret you ever left'&#133;</I>Aren't we all just out in
the cold, after all, and looking for a better place, trying to
get back to the womb?

<FONT SIZE=5>Philosophical questions are odd. Even philosophers
admit that, and Wittgenstein claimed that there aren't even any
real questions&#133; But they do cross everyone's mind at one time
or another. It may be a simple reaction to a surprise situation.
It could be a genuine dilemma. Maybe it's even a serious morbid
psychological doubt.. <CITE> 'Do I really exist?'</CITE>

<FONT SIZE=5>In 'All We Ever Look For' Kate asks herself , she
wonders: what are we all, ultimately, hoping to find? Are they
the real answers, or just a bit of comfort.. <I>'A God, a drug,
a great big hug'&#133; . </I>A little piece of someone else&#133;

<FONT SIZE=5>'All We Ever Look For' has a very distinctive
sound - almost like a country dance or an Elizabethan gavotte.
The tune features some kind of whistling. Almost certainly a human
whistle played back on the 'Fairlight' with unnatural precision.

<FONT SIZE=5>In the middle of the song, we hear the sound of
someone running down corridors from room to room, searching for
an answer&#133; And I can't help but wonder - could those hollow
sounds of footsteps have been recorded in the stone-floored passages
at 'East Wickham Farm'?
