 "Never Be Mine", one of the most outstanding tracks on "The Sensual World", sees Kate expressing the terrible pain of rejection with haunting vocals and the bittersweet sounds of Uillean pipes.</FONT>

Many of the songs of  this album tend to emphasize a
chasm between male and female, or rather male and female approaches to relationships. This is definitely the case for this track as well... . For some reason "Never Be Mine" always reminds me of the final scene
in "Gone With The Wind", when Clark Gable has walked out, and Vivien Leigh is left thinking about what she has lost... With the fires all around her.. <CITE>The smell of burning fields?</CITE>. So for me, this song  definitely conjures up a lot of strong imagery...</FONT>

"Never Be Mine", basically talks about the situation where a woman clings to a fantasy world (<CITE>"I
want you as the dream, not the reality"</CITE>) but lives to regret it (<CITE>"The
thrill and the hurting/I know that this will never be mine"</CITE>). Or as Kate put it herself:<CITE>""...It's that whole thing of how, in some situations, it's the dream
that a person is really enjoying the fantasy and aware it won't become reality.  So often you think it's the end you want, but this is actually looking at the process that will never get you there..."</CITE>.</FONT>

Musically, "Never Be Mine", features another collaboration of Kate and the Trio Bulgarka,
along with Davey Spillane's haunting Irish pipes. An incredible combination, that turns the track into a lingering, melancholic, and very intense listening-experience... Definitely my favourite song of "The Sensual World"</FONT>
