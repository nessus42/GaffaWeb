    <P>IED has managed to find a copy of John Carder Bush's original poem, &quot;Before
      the Fall&quot;. This poem formed the basis for John's spoken text on the
      early Kate Bush recording which bootleggers and we have mistakenly taken
      to calling Organic Acid. That is, of course, not the actual title. And
      although we still don't know what Kate's original song was called (after
      all, it was almost certainly not written for JCB's poem, but was simply
      combined with it later during performances), &quot;Before the Fall&quot;
      now seems a more legitimate (though admittedly less fun) title than
      Organic Acid. Here is the poem exactly as it was originally written (it
      includes many lines that were omitted from the recorded version, and lacks
      a word here and there as well): </P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <H1 ALIGN="center">Before the Fall</H1>
    
    <P ALIGN="center">He got her drunk very quickly:
      <BR> holding hands they found the broom cupboard
      <BR> where he had control as far as the fall,
      <BR> the rasping descent of her tights.
      <BR> When his hand covered wet hairs
      <BR> she took over among furniture wax, dust,
      <BR> the cloying yellow of polishing cloth.
      <BR> When he was sick
      <BR> she comforted him.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="center">He couldn't do it properly: the club,
      <BR> the office had left out details of delight.
      <BR> Satisfied, he would collapse out,
      <BR> puzzled at why she still squirmed,
      <BR> held on to him, tears curling into her mouth.
      <BR> This was something stories always omitted:
      <BR> that her joy would seem like pain
      <BR> when he focused after release.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="center">In the third week of the relationship
      <BR> she was tripping on organic acid,
      <BR> would stop, pick up a rained out leaf,
      <BR> would give it into his hand,
      <BR> full of dead things before they reached the car.
      <BR> When they drove she sat with mouth open
      <BR> as though photographed on the impact
      <BR> of a stomach punch, her right hand gripping
      <BR> the skin of his leg: he feared her,
      <BR> slapped out sideways into her face.
      <BR> She touched the cut with her tongue,
      <BR> gurgling gratitude for the strange taste.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="center">He stood looking through uncleaned windows,
      <BR> concentrated on the yellow of his car below.
      <BR> On the uncarpeted floor, with practice,
      <BR> she closed her eyes and drew on the cigarette.
      <BR> Twill jacket and polo-neck made him sweat,
      <BR> his nape skin red from a hair cut.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="center">Between two smokers she smiled up at him;
      <BR> as the weed approached he apologised
      <BR> suddenly wanting familiar territories:
      <BR> beer, to put his hand up her skirt.
      <BR> At the bottom of the limbed stairs
      <BR> he booted the cat, a drop kick in their twenty-five
      <BR> as he imagined her sylph laugh
      <BR> gathering chuckles around the room.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="center">There was no premonition of the wet Hog's Back,
      <BR> sports car slumped snout into a beach,
      <BR> their corpses giving the vehicle arms,
      <BR> petrol and blood at last dripping together
      <BR> but quick flashes of a planned lunch,
      <BR> cold red beef and a cherry wood fire,
      <BR> game pie and for him two pints of colder beer,
      <BR> the winter air tucking under their eye lids,
      <BR> spinning on the gravel at Clandon:
      <BR> the hand steaming from quick moisture,
      <BR> the aromatic finger drawn back into his nose.
      <BR> Dazed after mutual masturbation
      <BR> they slewed into a conservative end.
