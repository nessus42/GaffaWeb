    <P>IED: This song is radically different from the others in that
      collection, however, in that it includes a rather long poem by Kate's
      brother John Carder Bush, who recites a stanza or two between each verse
      and chorus of Kate's song. (Kate's piano continues between verses as a
      support to John's recitation.) IED cannot see any really clear connection
      between Kate's song and John's poem: the former seems to be a kind of
      lullabye to a troubled lover, and is filled with imagery of the sea. (One
      possibility, therefore, is that this is the song known as Atlantis, which
      IED has not heard but which is listed among the songs on the near-mythical
      album, The Early Years.) John's poem, however, is a far more detailed and
      explicit descriptive poem which details the progress and violent end of a
      vaguely perverted love affair. It is possible that the speaker in Kate's
      song is addressing a character in John's poem, or possibly the narrator of
      John's poem, himself; but neither of these interpretations seems likely to
      IED. (On the other hand, the reference to the beach at the climax of
      John's poem does provide for the possibility that the two are
      interconnected.) It seems more probable that Kate simply invited John to
      recite one of his poems during the performance of her song. She must have
      felt that the two works complemented each other in some intangible way;
      and IED, for one, agrees with her. </P>
