[first transcribed by Andrew B. Marvick (IED), later on improved and corrected 
by various love-hounds (e.g. Bryan Dongray, Emmy May Lombaerts, Violet... ).] 
We should all try to use the Phoenix broadcast titles, because they seem to be 
correct. At least no inconsistencies have been found. IED's titles are given in 
brackets. 
Everybody is invited and encouraged to listen carefully again to the difficult 
passages. Some are almost inaudible. Present your ideas to Love-Hounds! I have 
numbered the lines to make the discussion easier. 
I have added some annotations e.g. differences between the demos and the album 
versions and different suggestions for the uncertain lines. 
What follows are the lyrics in succession as they appear on the Phoenix broadcast 
tape.

<h3 align="center">
&quot;Hell, IED's been listening to the 1976 demos practically every day for three months 
or more now, and he still doesn't really have anything concrete to say about 
them--only that they are an unassailable, incontrovertible proof that God is living 
among us.&quot; </h3>

Differences to the album version: 

<p>
- the lines 6/7 and 20/21 are interchanged. <br>
- line 8 has an additional fourth &quot;giving it&quot; in the album version. <br>
- line 13 and 27: the &quot;Lose me&quot;'s are missing in the album version. <br>
- line 17: album version: &quot; Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read!&quot; <br>
- line 22 has four &quot;giving it&quot; in the album version. The last two in the demo version <br>
are sung in a much higher voice. <br>

The following songs are probably not from the Phoenix demos tape. 
Organic Acid belongs to the Piano Demos: 


<p>
<a name="d_acid"><h1 align="center">&quot;Organic Acid&quot;</h1></a>

<p>
IED: 
This song is radically different from the others in that collection, however, in that it 
includes a rather long poem by Kate's brother John Carder Bush, who recites a 
stanza or two between each verse and chorus of Kate's song. (Kate's piano 
continues between verses as a support to John's recitation.) 
IED cannot see any really clear connection between Kate's song and John's poem: 
the former seems to be a kind of lullabye to a troubled lover, and is filled with 
imagery of the sea. (One possibility, therefore, is that this is the song known as 
Atlantis, which IED has not heard but which is listed among the songs on the 
near-mythical album, The Early Years.) John's poem, however, is a far more 
detailed and explicit descriptive poem which details the progress and violent end of a 
vaguely perverted love affair. It is possible that the speaker in Kate's song is 
addressing a character in John's poem, or possibly the narrator of John's poem, 
himself; but neither of these interpretations seems likely to IED. (On the other hand, 
the reference to the beach at the climax of John's poem does provide for the 
possibility that the two are interconnected.) 
It seems more probable that Kate simply invited John to recite one of his poems 
during the performance of her song. She must have felt that the two works 
complemented each other in some intangible way; and IED, for one, agrees with her.

<p>
John:<br>
1 - 	&quot;He got her drunk very quickly. <br>
2 - 	Holding hands, they found the broom-cupboard, <br>
3 - 	Where he had control as far as the fall, <br>
4 - 	When his hand covered wet hair. <br>
5 - 	She took over among furniture wax, <br>
6 - 	Dust, the cloying yellow of polishing-cloth. <br>
7 - 	When he was sick, she comforted him.&quot; <br>

<p>
Kate:<br>
8 - 	Oh, hush, my friend, and sleep, <br>
9 - 	And cuddle to the wind. <br>
10 - And sleep on through the waves <br>
11 - That may wet your lover's dream. <br>

<p>
12 - We have been far through this night long hours. <br>
13 - We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh... <br>

<p>
John:<br>
14 - &quot;He couldn't do it properly; <br>
15 - The disco, the office, the pub, <br>
16 - Had left out those details of delight. <br>
17 - Satisfied, he would collapse out, <br>
18 - Puzzled at why she still squirmed, <br>
19 - Held onto him, tears curling into her mouth. <br>
20 - This was something their stories always omitted: <br>
21 - That her joy would seem like pain, <br>
22 - When he focused after his release.&quot; <br>

<p>
Kate:<br>
23 - Do sand and shells and stones <br>
24 - Peep in through your night? <br>
25 - But you should not be hurt <br>
26 - For all will pass with time. <br>

<p>
27 - We have been far through this night long hours. <br>
28 - We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh... <br>

<p>
John:<br>
29 - &quot;In the third week of the relationship <br>
30 - She was tripping on organic acid, <br>
31 - Would stop to pick up a rained-out leaf, <br>
32 - Would give it tenderly into his hand--<br>
33 - Full of dead things before they reached the car. <br>
34 - When they drove she sat with mouth open <br>
35 - As though photographed on the impact of a stomach punch, <br>
36 - Her right fist gripping the skin of his left leg. <br>
37 - Hooking the steering-wheel closer to his heart, <br>
38 - He feared her, and slapped out sideways into her face. <br>
39 - She entered the cut with her tongue, <br>
40 - Gurgling gratitude for the strange taste.&quot; <br>

<p>
Kate:<br>
41 - Do you fear the dark? <br>
42 - Then hush, and realise <br>
43 - That though the angels never come, <br>
44 - Prayers can soothe your mind. <br>

45 - We have been far through this night long hour. <br>
46 - We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh... <br>

John:<br>
47 - &quot;There was no premonition of the wet Hog's back. <br>
48 - The sportscar slumped, snout into a beech, <br>
49 - Their corpses giving the vehicle arms, <br>
50 - Petrol and blood at last dripping together. <br>
51 - But quick flashes of a planned lunch: <br>
52 - Cold red beef, white cloth by a cherrywood fire, <br>
53 - Game pie, and for him two pints of colder beer, <br>
54 - The winter air tucking under their eyelids <br>
55 - As they spun on the gravel at Clandon; <br>
56 - Their hands steaming from quick moisture, <br>
57 - The aromatic finger drawn up to his nostril--<br>
58 - Dazed after mutual masturbation, <br>
59 - They zigzagged into a conservative end.&quot; <br>

<p>
<a name="d_before"><h2 align="center">&quot;Before the Fall&quot;</h2></a><br>
IED has managed to find a copy of John Carder Bush's original poem, &quot;Before the 
Fall&quot;. This poem formed the basis for John's spoken text on the early Kate Bush 
recording which bootleggers and we have mistakenly taken to calling Organic Acid. 
That is, of course, not the actual title. And although we still don't know what Kate's 
original song was called (after all, it was almost certainly not written for JCB's 
poem, but was simply combined with it later during performances), &quot;Before the Fall&quot; 
now seems a more legitimate (though admittedly less fun) title than Organic Acid. 
Here is the poem exactly as it was originally written (it includes many lines that 
were omitted from the recorded version, and lacks a word here and there as well): 


<p>
<h1 align="center">Before the Fall</h1>

<h3 align="center">
<p>
He got her drunk very quickly: <br>
holding hands they found the broom cupboard <br>
where he had control as far as the fall, <br>
the rasping descent of her tights. <br>
When his hand covered wet hairs <br>
she took over among furniture wax, dust, <br>
the cloying yellow of polishing cloth. <br>
When he was sick <br>
she comforted him. <br>

<p>
He couldn't do it properly: the club, <br>
the office had left out details of delight. <br>
Satisfied, he would collapse out, <br>
puzzled at why she still squirmed, <br>
held on to him, tears curling into her mouth. <br>
This was something stories always omitted: <br>
that her joy would seem like pain <br>
when he focused after release. <br>

<p>
In the third week of the relationship <br>
she was tripping on organic acid, <br>
would stop, pick up a rained out leaf, <br>
would give it into his hand, <br>
full of dead things before they reached the car. <br>
When they drove she sat with mouth open <br>
as though photographed on the impact <br>
of a stomach punch, her right hand gripping <br>
the skin of his leg: he feared her, <br>
slapped out sideways into her face. <br>
She touched the cut with her tongue, <br>
gurgling gratitude for the strange taste. <br>

<p>
He stood looking through uncleaned windows, <br>
concentrated on the yellow of his car below. <br>
On the uncarpeted floor, with practice, <br>
she closed her eyes and drew on the cigarette. <br>
Twill jacket and polo-neck made him sweat, <br>
his nape skin red from a hair cut. <br>

<p>
Between two smokers she smiled up at him; <br>
as the weed approached he apologised <br>
suddenly wanting familiar territories: <br>
beer, to put his hand up her skirt. <br>
At the bottom of the limbed stairs <br>
he booted the cat, a drop kick in their twenty-five <br>
as he imagined her sylph laugh <br>
gathering chuckles around the room. <br>

<p>
There was no premonition of the wet Hog's Back, <br>
sports car slumped snout into a beach, <br>
their corpses giving the vehicle arms, <br>
petrol and blood at last dripping together <br>
but quick flashes of a planned lunch, <br>
cold red beef and a cherry wood fire, <br>
game pie and for him two pints of colder beer, <br>
the winter air tucking under their eye lids, <br>
spinning on the gravel at Clandon: <br>
the hand steaming from quick moisture, <br>
the aromatic finger drawn back into his nose. <br>
Dazed after mutual masturbation <br>
they slewed into a conservative end. <br>

<p>
1 - 	Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o. <br>
2 - 	My feet are heavy and I'm rooted in my wellios. <br>
3 - 	And I want to get away and go <br>
4 - 	From all these mirror windows. <br>

<p>
5 - 	I look at eye level, it isn't good enough. <br>
6 - 	And then I find it out when I take a good look up. <br>
7 - 	There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball <br>
8 - 	Calling me: <br>

<p>
9 - 	&quot;Come up and be a kite, <br>
10 - And fly a diamond night<br>
11 - A diamond kite, a diamond kite. <br>
12 - Ooh, what a diamond! <br>

<p>
13 - &quot;A diamond kite <br>
14 - On a diamond flight. <br>
15 - Over the lights, under the moon. <br>
16 - Over the lights, under the moon. <br>
17 - Over the moon, over the moon!&quot; <br>

<p>
18 - I feel a rush along my body, like a bullet. <br>
19 - I'm 2-D after a push-and-pull feeling. <br>
20 - And I want to get back to safe home: <br>
21 - Cause I love that dome. <br>

<p>
22 - I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind. <br>
23 - Well, I'm not sure if I want to be up here, at all. <br>
24 - And I'd like to be back on the ground, <br>
25 - But I don't know how to get down--down--down! <br>

<p>
26 - &quot;Come up and be a kite, <br>
27 - And fly a diamond night<br>
28 - A diamond kite, a diamond kite. <br>
29 - Ooh, what a diamond! <br>

<p>
30 - &quot;A diamond kite <br>
31 - On a diamond flight. <br>
32 - Over the lights, oooh, under the moon. <br>

1 - 	You came out of the night, <br>
2 - 	Wearing a mask in white colour. <br>
3 - 	My eyes were shining <br>
4 - 	On the wine, and your aura. <br>
5 - 	All in order, we move into the boudoir, <br>
6 - 	But too soon the morning has resumed. <br>

<p>
7 - 	I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon. <br>
8 - 	You look like an angel, <br>
9 - 	Sleeping it off at a station. <br>
10 - Were you only passing through? <br>

<p>
11 - I'm dying for you just to touch me, <br>
12 - And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me. <br>
13 - L'amour looks something like you. <br>

<p>
14 - The thought of you sends me shivery. <br>
15 - I'm dressed in a lace, sailing down a black reverie. <br>
16 - My heart is thrown <br>
17 - To the pebbles and the boatmen. <br>
18 - All the time I find I'm living in that evening, <br>
19 - With that feeling of sticky love inside. <br>

<p>
20 - I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon. <br>
