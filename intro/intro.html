    <P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">Greetings, wanderers of the Internet, and
      welcome to Gaffaweb! </FONT></P>
    
    <P>Gaffaweb has been assembled by a group of volunteers from the
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/love-hounds"
	 >Love-Hounds</a>
      Internet forum (a.k.a. rec.music.gaffa) with the aim
    of creating the ultimate resource for Kate Bush fans. </P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush -- singer, songwriter, musician, dancer, actress, and director
      -- has inspired a devoted following around the world, and in August 1985,
      Doug Alan created an online discussion group about Kate. At first taking
      the form of a mailing list called Love-Hounds, it soon grew into a usenet
      newsgroup called rec.music.gaffa. The name was chosen over &quot;rec.music.katebush&quot;
      to indicate that discussion would <EM>not</EM> be limited to Kate Bush
      alone. Other artists discussed in Love-Hounds / rec.music.gaffa include
      those who have been involved in Kate's work in some way, such as Peter
      Gabriel and Roy Harper, as well as those who have been influenced by her
      or likened to her, such as Tori Amos and Happy Rhodes. Together, the
      mailing list and the newsgroup form an informal fan club known as &quot;Love-Hounds.&quot;
      More information on all of this is available in the FAQ. </P>
    
    <P>There are already a number of sites on the World Wide Web devoted to
      Kate. Some of these have been incorporated into Gaffaweb itself, and
      Gaffaweb will ultimately include links to <EM>all</EM> other Kate Bush
      sites on the Web. In addition, there are selections from the best of the
      Love-Hounds archives, a comprehensive FAQ, a vast selection of images, and
      much original material specially created for Gaffaweb. </P>
    
    <P>Note: Like every other site on the Web, new things are continually being
      added to Gaffaweb. Still to come are a set of &quot;song story&quot; pages
      which will offer in-depth discussion and analysis of each of Kate's songs,
      a fully searchable database of all Kate Bush lyrics, the truly delightful
      <CITE>Cloudbusting: Kate Bush In Her Own Words</CITE> collection, a
      searchable archive of over a decade's worth of discussion and debate in
      Love-Hounds, and more. Check back often for new developments. </P>
    
    <P>Gaffaweb is intended as a source of information and entertainment for
      the devoted fan and the curious newcomer alike. If you're already a fan,
      you've definitely come to the right place. And if you're not yet familiar
      with the work of Kate Bush, we hope this is an introduction you'll enjoy.
    </P>
    
    <P>Okay, here goes. Make yourself a cup of coffee (homeground or
      otherwise), surf on, and get ready to be totally Bushwhacked! </P>
