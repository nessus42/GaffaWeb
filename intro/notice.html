<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>IMPORTANT NOTICE</H1>

26 September 1996:  It has come to our attention recently that readers of the <a href="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</a> newsgroup have not been seeing any new messages for the past several days.  In fact, new messages <EM>are</EM> being posted, but they are not making their way back through the servers which provide access to newsgroups.  While the technical problems which cause this are being sorted out, we ask that all our friends from rec.music.gaffa, and all interested newcomers, subscribe to the <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">Love-Hounds</a> mailing list, which is identical in content to rec.music.gaffa but delivered to you via e-mail.
<p>
The following description is loosely taken from the Gaffaweb <a href="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/faq/faq_1-2.html">FAQ</a>, where still more information is available:
<p>
<STRONG>Love-Hounds</STRONG> comes in two flavors: digest and bounce.  If you subscribe to the digest version, you will receive a digest once a day containing all messages sent to the list since the last digest.  If you subscribe to the bounce version you will receive each individual message as it is sent. You can subscribe to either version of the list by sending an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">majordomo@gryphon.com</a> containing one of the following commands:
<pre>
     subscribe love-hounds-bounce
     subscribe love-hounds-digest

</pre>
To <em>unsubscribe</em> from either version of the list, send an e-mail message to the same address, <a href="mailto:majordomo@gryphon.com">majordomo@gryphon.com</a>, containing one of the following commands:
<pre>
     unsubscribe love-hounds-bounce
     unsubscribe love-hounds-digest
     
</pre>
To post to the mailing list and the newsgroup, send your message to <a href="mailto: love-hounds@gryphon.com">love-hounds@gryphon.com</a>.
<p>
We hope and expect that service on rec.music.gaffa will return to normal shortly, but until it does, please join us on the mailing list!
