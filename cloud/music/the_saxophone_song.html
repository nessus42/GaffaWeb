		<DD> I wrote ``<CITE>The Saxophone Song</CITE>'' because, for me, the
		  saxophone is a truly amazing instrument. Its sound is very exciting - rich and
		  mellow. It sounds like a female. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DD> The song isn't about David Bowie. I wrote it about the instrument,
		  not the player, at a time when I really loved the sound of the saxophone - I
		  still do. No, I don't know him personally, though I went to his ``farewell to
		  Ziggy Stardust'' concert and cried, and so did he. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Um, I don't know. [<I>Laughs.</I>] The best I can say is that I
		  think in some ways the Uileann pipe is almost like a Celtic saxophone. And, so
		  we've used them a bit. (<A HREF="../../dreaming/chat_90.html">1990 Kate Bush
