		<DD> That was really quick, really straightforward. A walk in the park
		  did that one for me. I really needed one more song to kind of lift the album. I
		  was a bit worried that it was all sort of dark and down. I'd been getting into
		  walks at that time, and just came back and sat at the piano and wrote it, words
		  and all. </DD>

		<DD> I had this lovely conversation with someone around the time I was
		  about to start writing it. They were talking about this star that exploded. I
		  thought it was such fantastic imagery. The song was taking the whole idea of
		  how we cling onto things that change - we're always trying to not let things
		  change. I thought it was such a lovely <A
		  HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A> of people reaching up for a star, and
		  this star explodes. Where's it gone? It seemed to sum it all up really. </DD>

		<DD> That's kind of about how you can't hold on to anything because
		  everything is always changing and we all have such a terrible need to hold onto
		  stuff and to keep it exactly how it is, because this is nice and we don't want
		  it to change. But sometimes even if things aren't nice, people don't want them
		  to change. And things do. Just look at the natural balance of things: how if
		  you reach out for something, chances are it will pull away. And when things
		  reach out for you, the chances are <CITE>you</CITE> will pull away. You know
		  everything ebbs and flows, and you know the moon is full and then it's gone:
		  it's just the balance of things. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Bush suddenly catches herself at the crest of this philosophical
		wave. Absolute rubbish, she pshaws, laughing. Just tell them to go buy the
		record and see if they like it. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, you can't help but reach out and touch certain things even if
		  you think they might hurt. When <A HREF="../subjects/children.html">
		  children</A> reach out to touch parents it's a lottery as to whether they'll
		  get a clip round the ears or a cuddle. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> We did a really straightforward treatment on the track; did the
		  piano to a clicktrack, got Charlie Morgan [<I>Elton john's drummer</I>] to come
		  in and do the drums, Del did the <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html"> bass</A>, and
		  Michael Nyman came in to do the strings. I told him it had to have a sense of
		  uplifting, and I really like his stuff - the rawness of his strings. It's a bit
		  like a fuzzbox touch - quite 'punk'. I find that very attractive - he wrote it
		  very quickly. I was very pleased. (1989, <CITE><A
