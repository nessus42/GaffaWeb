		<DD> The last song is called ``<CITE>Cloudbusting,</CITE>'' and this was
		  inspired by a book that I first found on a shelf nearly nine years ago. It was
		  just calling me from the shelf, and when I read it I was very moved by the
		  magic of it. It's about a special relationship between a young son and his
		  father. The book was written from a child's point of view. His father is
		  everything to him; he is the magic in his life, and he teaches him everything,
		  teaching him to be open-minded and not to build up barriers. His father has
		  built a machine that can make it rain, a ``cloudbuster"; and the son and his
		  father go out together cloudbusting. They point big pipes up into the sky, and
		  they make it rain. The song is very much taking a comparison with a yo-yo that
		  glowed in the dark and which was given to the boy by a best friend. It was
		  really special to him; he loved it. But his father believed in things having
		  positive and negative energy, and that fluorescent light was a very negative
		  energy - as was the material they used to make glow-in-the-dark toys then - and
		  his father told him he had to get rid of it, he wasn't allowed to keep it. But
		  the boy, rather than throwing it away, buried it in the garden, so that he
		  would placate his father but could also go and dig it up occasionally and play
		  with it. It's a parallel in some ways between how much he loved the yo-yo - how
		  special it was - and yet how dangerous it was considered to be. He loved his
		  father (who was perhaps considered dangerous by some people); and he loved how
		  he could bury his yo-yo and retrieve it whenever he wanted to play with it. But
		  there's nothing he can do about his father being taken away, he is completely
		  helpless. But it's very much more to do with how the son does begin to cope
		  with the whole loneliness and pain of being without his father. It is the magic
		  moments of a relationship through a child's eyes, but told by a sad adult.

		<DD> All of us tend to live in our heads. In
		  ``<CITE>Cloudbusting</CITE>,'' the idea was of starting this song with a person

		<DD> It's a song with a very American inspiration, which draws its
		  subject from <CITE>A Book of Dreams</CITE> by Peter Reich. The book was written
		  as if by a child who was telling of his strange and unique relationship with
		  his father. They lived in a place called Organon, where the father, a respected
		  psycho-analyst, had some very advanced theories on Vital Energy; furthermore,
		  he owned a rain-making machine, the Cloudbuster. His son and he loved to use it
		  to make it rain. Unfortunately, the father was imprisoned because of his ideas.
		  In fact, in <A HREF="../subjects/america.html">America</A>, in that period, it
		  was safer not to stick out. Sadly, the father dies in prison. From that point
		  on, his son becomes unable to put up with an orthodox lifestyle, to adapt
		  himself. The song evokes the days of happiness when the little boy was making
		  it rain with his father. </DD>

		<DD> "<CITE>Cloudbusting</CITE>'' is a track that was very much inspired
		  by a book called <CITE>A Book Of Dreams</CITE>. This book is written through a
		  child's eyes, looking at his father and how much his father means to him in his
		  world - he's everything. his father has a machine that can make it rain,
		  amongst many other things, and there's a wonderful sense of magic as he and his
		  father make it rain together on this machine. The book is full of imagery of an
		  innocent child and yet it's being written by a sad adult, which gives it a
		  strange kind of personal intimacy and magic that is quite extraordinary. The
		  song is really about how much that father meant to the son and how much he
		  misses him now he's gone. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Open

		<DD> I found a book, nearly ten years ago now, on a shelf. I didn't know
		  anything about the writer. I just pulled it off the shelf, it looked
		  interesting, and it was an incredible story. It's written by Peter Reich, and
		  it's called A Book of <A HREF="../subjects/dreams.html"> Dreams</A>. It's about
		  himself as a child, through his eyes as a child, looking at his father and
		  their relationship. It's incredibly beautiful, it's very, very emotive, and
		  very innocent because it's through a child's eyes. His father was a very
		  respected psychoanalyst, and besides this, something that features in the book,
		  he made machines called ``cloudbusters'' that could make it rain, and him and
		  his father used to go out together and make it rain; they used to go
		  ``cloudbusting.'' And, unfortunately, the peak in the book is where his father
		  is arrested, taken away from him; he was considered a threat. So, suddenly, his
		  father is gone, so it's a very sad book as well. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Um...yes. I think ``<CITE>Cloudbusting</CITE>'' was quite like that.
		  It must have been nearly ten years ago, when I used to go up to the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">Dance</A> Center in London, that I went into
		  Watkins' occult bookshop for a look, and there was this book and it said,
		  <CITE>A Book of Dreams,</CITE> by Peter Reich. I'd never heard of his father,
		  Wilhelm Reich, but I just thought it was going ``Hello, Hello,'' so I just
		  picked up the book and read it and couldn't believe that I'd just
		  <CITE>found</CITE> this book on the shelf. I mean it was so inspirational, very
		  magical, with that energy there. So when I wrote and recorded the song,
		  although it was about nine years later, I was nevertheless psyched up by the
		  book, the image of the boy's father being taken away and locked up by the
		  government just for building a machine to try to make rain. It was such a
		  beautiful book! (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> He was quite a well-respected psycho-analyst, and he had a machine,

		  the machine at the sky and make it rain. The book was so sad, because the whole
		  thing is through the child's eye about his father. But it's been written,
		  fairly obviously, by a sad adult who, I think, had a great deal of trouble
		  coping with his father going - he was arrested by the F.D.A., and put in
		  prison, and he died shortly after that. The loss to his son must have been
		  incredible. His father always warned him that this would probably happen, but

		<DD> Well ``<CITE>Cloudbusting</CITE>'' was inspired by a book that I
		  found in a shop about nine years ago, it's out of print now. Written by a guy
		  called Peter Reich, and it's called <CITE>A Book Of Dreams</CITE>. And it's
		  very unusual, beautiful book, written by this man through the eyes of himself
		  when he was a child, looking at his father, and the relationship between them.
		  Very special relationship, his father meant so much to him. His father was a
		  psychoanalyst, very respected, but he also had a machine that could make it
		  rain, and the two of them would go out together and they would make it rain.
		  And in the book there was such a sense of magic, that it a way the rain was
		  almost a presence of his father. Unfortunately, its a very sad book in that the
		  peak of it is where his father was arrested, taken away from him, because of
		  his beliefs he's considered a threat. And it's how the child has to cope from
		  that point onwards without his father. And the song is really using the rain as
		  something the reminds the son of his father. Every time it rains instead of it
		  being very sad and lonely, it's a very happy moment for him, it's like his
		  father is with him again. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> And the song was inspired a book that's all about a very special

		  His father was a very respected psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and had lots of

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's called <CITE>A Book Of Dreams</CITE>, and the man that wrote it

		  hard for the child to cope without his father. And in some ways the connection
		  with rain, for him every time it rains he thinks of his father, so its a
		  positive of him coping without him. (1985, <CITE><A

		  name is Peter Reich, about when he was a child, it was the relationship between
		  himself as a child and his father. And it's written very much through the eyes
		  of the child. so it has an incredible sense of innocence and intimacy between
		  him and this great big man who's his father and meat everything to him. Peter
		  Reich's father was a very respected psychoanalyst who did a lot of work. And
		  one thing that's mentioned in the book, that's quite aside from his theoretical
		  work was that he had a machine that could make it rain. And the two of them
		  would go out together and make it rain. This was really where the video came
		  in, to explain all this. It really is an extraordinary book and everyone that I

		  this... I liked the title, it said <CITE>A Book of Dreams</CITE>, and took the
		  book off the shelf, I never done it before, an unknown book. And it was this
		  beautiful story by this guy called Peter Reich. And it's all about his view of
		  his father, but through the eyes of a child, so it was all about his childhood
		  and how he saw his father as this incredibly magical figure. And his father was
		  Wilhelm Reich and he was a very respected Psychoanalyst, I believe, but his
		  work became very controversial and he eventually arrested and died in prison.
		  But one of the things that features in the book is how he used to go with his
		  father cloudbusting. And his father had this machine that when you pointed it
		  up to the sky you could make the clouds disperse or you could gather them
		  together, and if you gathered them together it would rain. And the machine is
		  all based on Orgone energy, which is one of the bases of Reich's teachings. And
		  the book is just extraordinary. It's so said, but it's also got this beautiful
		  kind of happy innocence that goes with childhood. And as the guy grows up in
		  the book, in does get sadder and sadder as you can feel him hanging onto his
		  childhood. And the book really touched me, and the song is really trying to

		<DD> When we were thinking about someone to play the part of the father,

		  really, and we jokingly thought ``yeah, yeah wouldn't it be great." </DD>

		<DD> So we did actually approach his agent, who immediately said no, he
		  couldn't because he's just too busy. But a friend of ours knew a friend of his,
		  who asked him, and he gave us three days of his time in between shooting two
		  other films. And I still can't believe he did it. It was a wonderful thing for
		  him to do, give us that time. Made it a very, very special thing for me. (1989,

		<DD> Really lucky. The brief, really from the start, was that I wanted a
		  great actor to play the father. I wanted it to be a piece of
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> rather than a video promotional clip.
		  I wanted it to be a short piece of film that would hopefully do justice to the
		  original book. And let people understand the story that couldn't really be
		  explained in the song. So we wanted a great actor. We though of Donald
		  Sutherland and though ``well, chances are we won't get him, but why not try?''
		  So we found a contact and explained the story and sent the script to him, and
		  he was interested in doing it. And just happened to have the days free when we

		<DD> Well, I think I'm very lucky, really. He was the first choice. He

		  he said yes, he was interested. And it all went from there, and it all happened
		  very quickly. I must have contacted him ten days to two weeks before we

		<DD> No, not even advice, his pure presence. He puts out such an energy

		  Julian Doyle put an awful lot of work into it, and it was fantastic to work
		  with them. Everyone was just so inspired by the story really, and everyone was

		<DD> "<CITE>Cloudbusting</CITE>'' was really exciting to make. I really
		  wanted it to be like a short <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>. The
		  song was inspired by the book <CITE>A Book of Dreams</CITE> by Peter Reich,
		  which was such a strong, magical story that the plot was there and the most
		  difficult areas were trying to do the story and the characters justice, and
		  deciding how to ``distill'' all the information. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I worked with Julian Doyle as director. He was suggested to me by
		  Terry Gilliam. Terry is one of my favourite <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">
		  film</A>-makers, and I was so honoured that he got involved; and we worked very
		  hard for about five-six weeks. It seemed to make sense to treat it like a film
		  and cast actors, and I had this initial crazy idea of using a very tall actor
		  who would play the father, and myself to appear as the small boy. It
		  continually astounds me that I have the nerve to publicly announce these
		  crazes, and I'm even more surprised when they work. It seems to be connected to
		  a kind of faith? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The first move was to check that I'd be able to look boy-like or
		  tom-boyish, so we pulled ``The Team'' together. This consists of Tina Earnshaw
		  on make-up - she set about with foundation and stick-on freckles; Anthony
		  Yacomine, who designed and cut a short wig which my hair was bundled up inside
		  of; and Pamela Keats, who had brought a variety of dungarees, cardigans and
		  wellies [<I>Rubber rainboots</I>] that completed the character; and Del gave
		  options. I looked a bit like Coco the clown, and someone mentioned Harpo, but
		  we all felt with fine adjustments we could get away with it, especially when we
		  took a polaroid with Anthony standing on the chair to look tall next to me.

		<DD> One of the things that needed a lot of work was the Cloudbuster

		  went to see it in its early stages I really wondered: four cardboard tubes on
		  wheels - eek!! But by the last stages it looked great, and on screen it looked

		<DD> Another thing that needed a lot of work was the weather. We needed

		  weather to change for different scenes; and somehow - we still don't know how -
		  it did; even to the moment when it began to rain just as the light and the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> in the camera was running out. (1986,

		  right. On screen it's got to be exaggerated. So it was trying to design
		  something that would look powerful and possible of doing it but that wouldn't
		  be comical, because we didn't people to laugh at it, we wanted people to be
		  astounded by the machine. So it was really designing something that was a cross
		  between an Ack-Ack gun and a pipe organ. I just felt that it had to have these
		  huge funnels that would reach to the sky and could be moved around. And the
		  whole thing should be rotatable. And so we worked with some designers that
		  worked on the Alien and I think it looked pretty good. </DD>

		<DD> No, but it's quite a departure. I have done a couple of others that

		  working on video as well, which makes it quite different. (1985, <CITE><A
