	 <H1> Houdini </H1> 
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The side most people know of Houdini is that of the escapologist,
		  but he spent many years of his life exposing mediums and seances as frauds. His
		  mother had died, and in trying to make contact through such spiritual people,
		  he realized how much pain was being inflicted on people already in sorrow,
		  people who would part with <A HREF="../subjects/money.html"> money</A> just for
		  the chance of a few words from a past loved one. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I feel he must have believed in the possibility of contact after
		  <A HREF="../subjects/death.html">death</A>, and perhaps in his own way, by
		  weeding out the frauds, he hoped to find just one that could not be proven to
		  be a fake. He and his wife made a decision that if one of them should die and
		  try to make contact, the other would know it was truly them through a code that
		  only the two of them knew. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> His wife would often help him with his escapes. Before he was bound
		  up and sealed away inside a tank or some dark box, she would give him a parting
		  kiss, and as their lips met, she would pass him the key which he would later
		  use to unlock the padlocks that chained him. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> After he died, Mrs. Houdini did visit many mediums, and tried to
		  make contact for years, with no luck - until one day a medium called Mr. Ford
		  informed her that Houdini had come through. She visited him and he told her
		  that he had a message for her from Houdini, and he spoke the only words that
		  meant for her the proof of her husband's presence. She was so convinced that
		  she released an official statement to the fact that he had made contact with
		  her through the medium, Ford. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It is such a beautiful and strange story that I thought I had very
		  little to do, other than tell it like it was. But in fact it proved to be the
		  most difficult lyric of all the songs and the most emotionally demanding. I was
		  so aware of trying to do justice to the beauty of the subject, and trying to
		  understand what it must have been like to have been in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> with such an extraordinary man, and
		  to have been loved by him. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I worked for two or three nights just to find one line that was
		  right. There were so many alternatives, but only a few were right for the song.
		  Gradually it grew and began to piece together, and I found myself wrapped up in
		  the feelings of the song - almost pining for Houdini. Singing the lead vocal
		  was a matter of conjuring up that feeling again and as the clock whirrs and the
		  song flashes back in time to when she watched him through the glass, he's on
		  the other side under water, and she hangs on to his every breath. We both wait.

	 <P> <B> Your songs are nearly always based around a story of sorts. Is it
		important for you to have a meaning behind your songs? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh yes, I think it gets more and more so, because although on the
		  first two albums the songs were always based on something, they weren't all
		  that strong; but now I get more involved with the ideas behind a song, and I do
		  my best to make the concept as vivid and as solid as I can. On the new album,
		  for instance, there is a track about the legendary escapologist Houdini. During
		  his incredible lifetime Houdini took it upon himself to expose the whole
		  spiritualist thing - you know, seances and mediums. And he found a lot them to
		  be phoney, but before he died Houdini and his wife worked out a code, so that
		  if he came back after his <A HREF="../subjects/death.html"> death</A> his wife
		  would know it was him by the code. So after his death his wife made several
		  attempts to contact her dead husband, and on one occasion he did come through
		  to her. I thought that was so beautiful - the idea that this man who had spent
		  his life escaping from chains and ropes had actually managed to contact his
		  wife. The image was so beautiful that I just had to write a song about it.
		  [<I>The full story is quite complicated, but mrs. Houdini later stated that no
		  such contact was ever made. Kate has indicated in other interviews - conducted
		  presumably a bit later than this one - that she was aware of the dubious
		  aspects of the story, but that the beauty of the concept and imagery were no
		  less true for that. - ied</I>] (1982, <CITE><A

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That's right. He was married, and his wife was actually quite
		  involved with his whole life and his work, and she used to help a lot with the
		  tricks. And one of the things, which is what the album cover's about, is before
		  he went off into his tank, when he was all tied up and everything, she would
		  give him a parting kiss, and as she kissed him, she passed him a tiny little
		  key, which he then later used when he was in the water to unlock the chains.
		  And as soon as I heard that imagery, I just thought it was so beautiful, and so
		  extraordinary. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> He tied that into the whole side of his life where he was completely
		  obsessed with exposing mediums as frauds. I don't know if you know anything
		  about that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> No...? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This was another side of him. His mother died, and he was really,
		  really close to her, like really close. And when she died he needed desperately
		  to try and communicate with her through a medium, and he just came across all
		  these people who were basically making <A HREF="../subjects/money.html">
		  money</A> out of the art of pretending to speak to the dead, and when he
		  realized all these people were just basically ruining peoples' lives just to
		  make some money he decided - in a very positive way - to show that they were
		  frauds and tricksters. So he spent years of his life dedicating time to finding
		  any medium that said they were really authentic and proving that they were
		  completely false. So he spent years of his life doing this, and ruining
		  peoples' careers and getting an awful lot of spiritualists uptight. Before he
		  died, he said to his wife, ``i'm going to die before you, and when I do, I am
		  going to try everything I can to try and come back through a real medium. And
		  there'll be one way you know it's me, because all these tricksters are going to
		  jump on the wagon and say that I've come through and I'm going to use words
		  that only you and I know. It's a code, so you'll know that it's me, and no-one
		  else.'' So they made this code together, and when he died she went round all
		  the seances waiting for him to come through. It's extraordinary really, because
		  the thing happened on the three levels, because apparently when he first got
		  his stage set together, he was more into magic and the same kind of fraud, and
		  he would do things where he would pretend he was contacting the dead, and he
		  would tell the audience these messages from their dead people, and it was all a
		  trick. Then it happened to <CITE>him,</CITE> through his mother, where they
		  were all tricking him because he wanted to contact his mother, and then exactly
		  the same thing happened to his wife after his death, when they were all trying
		  to trick her, that he had come through. And it's just so extraordinary, that,
		  really: the whole thing with him escaping, chains and things, and then trying
		  to escape death, and this weird sort of parallel of contact and frauds. It's
		  just an incredibly extraordinary man and story. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> How did you get into all this? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I just heard about it. I don't even remember how I first heard about
		  the big thing of exposing mediums. I mean, that was what started it, because it
		  was such a strange story, the fact that he should be so obsessed with proving
		  that they weren't real. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And then I started hearing how his wife was involved, because I
		  hadn't even known he was married; and as soon as there was an emotional contact
		  with that bit - there was some woman who was really in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> with him through it all - it became a
		  perfect angle to write from, really. Especially when you thought about how,
		  even when he was dead, she spent all her time trying to be with him. It's very
		  strong stuff, I think. Beautiful. </DD>

	 <P> <B> The credits on the album. There's two mentioned, there's gordon

	 <P> <B> Really? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah! Years ago I used to go every week for these lessons, and
		  really it was great, 'cause he gave me loads of confidence in singing, which is
		  what I needed more than anything. I just used to go to him half an hour a week,
		  and by the end of the year I felt a lot more confident in myself as a singer.
		  He worked wonders! And on ``<CITE>Houdini</CITE>", i don't know if you noticed
		  at the end there are these sounds, like the backing vocal that accompanies the
		  very last ``you and I and rosabel believe'' lyric, just after the strings
		  section; and that's him. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So you gave him a mention from that point of view? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah. He sang in it. </DD>

	 <P> <B> And the ``rosabel, believe!'' bit? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Ah, well, that's actually the words that were the code, between him

	 <P> <B> Between houdini and his wife? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, and they were the words that proved to her that it was him,

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Because he was the one who actually pretended to be him, in the
		  song. The idea in the song is that it was the voice of Houdini, perhaps from
		  the other side, and in fact it was Del on the telephone. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Oh, I see. Del played that part, he played that, sort of ``role''

	 <P> <B> There's a mysterious quote on the sleeve: ``with a kiss I'd pass

		<DD> It's a little depiction from the song. I didn't even know he was

		  into his tank or jump in the river, she'd give him a parting kiss and pass a
		  tiny silver key into his mouth. He'd wander off, then take it out and unlock

		<DD> He used to be involved with spiritualists - go round exposing them

		  together so that if he or she died and the other came back through a medium or
		  something, they would know it was them, not a fraud. When he died, she started
		  going to all these seances, all frauds, but she went to one guy and he really

		<DD> It's such a beautiful <A HREF="../subjects/image.html"> image</A>:
		  for this guy, who'd been escaping all his life, to escape death and come back

		  he hadn't, so I rang up <CITE>Psychic News,</CITE> and this nice lady got all
		  these papers from the 1920s and read me this apparently official declaration
		  from Mrs. Houdini that this had happened. I feel that they were terribly in
		  love because of the whole story. She was saving his life every time. It's such
		  a great story, I couldn't resist it. </DD>

		  Houdini, I think most people know him for being the escapologist, the man who's
		  who's wriggling around in a sack on the pavement. But I started finding out
		  about a side of his life that seemed more interesting, for me, where he spent a
		  lot of years actually going around to mediums and seances, exposing the fact
		  that they were frauds. He'd try to contact his mother when she died and he just
		  met fraud after fraud and they were after his <A HREF="../subjects/money.html">
		  money</A> and as far he was concerned they were just making people very unhappy
		  just in order to get money. So he spent years just going 'round to these
		  places, and revealing the wires and revealing the technicalities and all this
		  sort of thing. But between him and his wife they made a code and it was very
		  strange because they made this so that if perhaps one of them ever died and the
		  other tried to contact them through a medium or a seance, that they would know
		  that it was really them and not a fraud. And when Houdini died his wife did
		  actually start going around to the mediums and the seances, more or less what
		  he had done when he had been alive. And the same thing for years, she just came
		  across so many fakes and people that really were not true mediums at all. Until
		  one day she had a phone call from a man who said that Houdini had come through
		  to him. So she went to see him, and he gave her the code that only Houdini and
		  her had known and as far as she was concerned he had made contact with her.
