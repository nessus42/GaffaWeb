		<DD> Yes, well apparently it is grandmother, it's also a headdress that
		  people wear. But when I wrote the song it was just a name that literally came
		  into my mind, I've presumed I've got it from a fairy story I'd read when I was
		  a child. And after having written the song a series of incredible coincidences
		  happened where I'd turned on the <A
		  HREF="../subjects/television.html">television</A> and there was Donald Swan
		  singing about Babooshka. So I thought, ``well, there's got to be someone who's
		  actually called Babooshka.'' So I was looking through <CITE>Radio Times</CITE>
		  and there, another coincidence, there was an opera called Babooshka. Apparently
		  she was the lady that the three kings went to see because the star stopped over
		  her house and they thought ``Jesus is in there.'' So they went in and he
		  wasn't. And they wouldn't let her come with them to find the baby and she spent
		  the rest of her life looking for him and she never found him. And also a friend
		  of mine had a cat called Babooshka. [<I>He laughs</I>] So these really
		  extraordinary things that kept coming up when in fact it was just a name that
		  came into my head at the time purely because it fitted. (1980, <CITE><A
