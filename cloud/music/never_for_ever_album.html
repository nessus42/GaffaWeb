		<DD> Now, after all this waiting it is here. It's strange when I think
		  back to the first album. I thought it would never feel as new or as special
		  again. This one has proved me wrong. It's been the most exciting. Its name is
		  <CITE>Never For Ever</CITE>, and I've called it this because I've tried to make
		  it reflective of all that happens to you and me. </DD>

		<DD> The album cover has been beautifully created by Nick Price (you may
		  remember that he designed the front of the Tour programme). On the cover of
		  <CITE>Never For Ever</CITE> Nick takes us on an intricate journey of our
		  emotions: inside gets outside, as we flood people and things with our desires
		  and problems. These black and white thoughts, these bats and doves,
		  freeze-framed in flight, swoop into the album and out of your hi-fis. Then it's
		  for you to bring them to life. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> It's difficult to talk about the album without you actually hearing

		<DD> For me, this was the first LP I'd made that I could sit back and

		<DD> Right, I didn't have my own Fairlight and we had to hire one in. And
		  really as soon as I met the Fairlight, I realized that it was something I
		  really couldn't do without because it was just so integral to what I wanted to
		  do with my music. I think I've always enjoyed synthesizers...I found them very
		  interesting, but I never really enjoyed all the sounds. And what really gets me
		  about the Fairlight is that any sound becomes musical. You can actually control
		  any sound you want by sampling it in, and then being able to play it. I mean
		  obviously, it doesn't always sound great, but the amount of potential
		  exploration you have there with sounds is never-ending, and it's fabulous.

		<DD> Yes, I do now. This is actually the first album that I've done that
		  on. Up until now, I've always written on the piano. It's been a very important
		  part of it. The songs came from the piano and the chords. But with this album,
		  the majority of the songs have come from the Fairlight and working with drum
		  machines and things like that. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, it's not a concept but all the songs are very different, that's
		  really why it's not a concept. But they are joined together in as much each
		  track is trying to flow into the other, although they're quite separate
		  entities, they're about different subjects. And the cover was terribly
		  important because I do feel with home taping, etc., happening, you have to give
		  people as much as you can on an album. And it's something I've always wanted to
		  buy, I've always wanted to go in and buy an album I've been waiting for. And
		  you hold the cover and you think ``oh, this is it!,'' you know, and you sorta
		  plow through it for any little bit of information. And so that's what I've
		  tried to do and we've got the most incredible artists... </DD>

		<DD> They come from very different sources, but it is mainly people.
		  Things people will say, whether they say then on
		  <A HREF="../subjects/television.html"> television</A> or to me personally or
		  even things I hear on the <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A>. It's very
		  much stimulus from other people and just the way I feel about things that I see
		  in other people, because I'm involved with people all the time, they come in
		  and out of my life. But the thing that is a continuing theme, you know, is
		  life, people. </DD>

	 <P> <B> There's on or two quite big names actually who are mentioned on the

		Are they just friends, admirers, or helped it musically, or what? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, they're probably all of those that you mentioned, they're very
		  important to me, those people. Peter I did some work with and he was very
		  inspiring and it was very important for me to write something as a gesture. Roy
		  is on the album. Roy I think is one of the true English poets and so he
		  definitely needed something said. And Herbie Flowers, he's a very special man,
		  because he makes everyone so happy. (1980, <CITE><A
