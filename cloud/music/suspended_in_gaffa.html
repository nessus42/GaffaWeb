		<DD> Whenever I've sung this song I've hoped that my breath would hold
		  out for the first few phrases, as there is no gap to breathe in. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> When I wrote this track the words came at the same time, and this is
		  one of the few songs where the lyrics were complete at such an early stage. The
		  idea of the song is that of being given a glimpse of ``God'' - something that
		  we dearly want - but being told that unless we work for it, we will never see
		  it again, and even then, we might not be worthy of it. Of course, everybody
		  wants the reward without the toil, so people try to find a way out of the hard
		  work, still hoping to claim the prize, but such is not the case. The choruses
		  are meant to express the feeling of entering timelessness as you become ready
		  for the experience, but only when you are ready. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> I could explain some of it, if you want me to: ``<CITE>Suspended in
		  Gaffa</CITE>'' is reasonably autobiographical, which most of my songs aren't.
		  It's about seeing something that you want - on any level - and not being able
		  to get that thing unless you work hard and in the right way towards it. When I
		  do that I become aware of so many obstacles, and then I want the thing without
		  the work. And then when you achieve it you enter...a different level -
		  everything will slightly change. It's like going through a time warp which
		  otherwise wouldn't have existed. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> ...But when you explain it like this it doesn't sound like
		anything. The idea is much more valuable within the song than it is in my
		telling you about it. When you analyze it, it seems silly. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">NME</A></CITE>)

		<DD> "Gaffa'' is Gaffa Tape. It is thick industrial tape, mainly used for
		  taping down and tidying up the millions of leads, and particularly useful in
		  concert situations. ``<CITE>Suspended in Gaffa</CITE>'' is trying to simulate
		  being trapped in a kind of web: everything is in slow motion, and the person
		  feels like they're tied up. They can't move. Defeat. (1984, <CITE><A

		<DD> "<CITE>Suspended In Gaffa</CITE>'' is, I suppose, similar in some
		  ways to ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/sat_in_your_lap_album_re_mix_.html"> Sat In
		  Your Lap</A></CITE>'' - the idea of someone seeking something, wanting
		  something. I was brought up as a Roman Catholic and had the imagery of
		  purgatory and of the idea that when you were taken there that you would be
		  given a glimpse of God and then you wouldn't see him again until you were let
		  into heaven. And we were told that in Hell it was even worse because you got to
		  see God but then you knew that you would never see him again. And it's sorta
		  using that as the parallel. And the idea of seeing something incredibly
		  beautiful, having a religious experience as such, but not being able to get
		  back there. And it was playing musically with the idea of the verses being
		  sorta real time and someone happily jumping through life [<I>Makes happy motion
		  with head</I>] and then you hit the chorus and it like everything sorta goes
		  into slow mo and they're reaching [<I>Makes slow reaching motion with arm</I>]
		  for that thing that they want and they can't get there. [<I>Laughs</I>] </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, that video and the one that went with ``<CITE>There Goes A
		  Tenner</CITE>,'' quite honestly, were rushed. There was very little time to do
		  them. I had to do three <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html"> videos</A> in
		  something like two months and I don't really think that if we'd had more time
		  that we would have done that. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, it's really about people that are after something that is very
		  special to them. They've seen something that they want very badly, but they
		  know that in order to get that they have to work very hard. And a lot of people
		  don't want to do the work and still want the thing at the end of it. I remember
		  when I was at school, I was always told about purgatory as being the place that
		  you went to and you saw a glimpse of God and then he went away and you never
		  ever saw him again and you were in the most tremendous pain for the rest of
		  eternity because you couldn't ever see him again. And it's a really heavy
		  <A HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A>, you know, especially for a child.
		  And I think in many ways it's a very similar thing, trying to get that back
		  that thing that you really want to see again. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> <IMG SRC="../xbm/new.gif" ALT="*" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16">Lyrically
		  it's not really that dissimilar from ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/sat_in_your_lap_album_re_mix_.html"> Sat In Your
		  Lap</A></CITE>'' in saying that you really want to work for something. It's
		  playing with the idea of hell. At school I was always taught that if you went
		  to hell you would see a glimpse of God and that was it - you never saw him
		  again and you'd spend the rest of eternity pining to see him. In a way it was
		  even worse if you went to purgatory because you got the glimpse of God and you
		  would see him again [<I>??? But you</I>] didn't know when. So it was almost
		  like you had to sit here until he decided to com back. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I suppose for me in my work, because it's such a sped up life and so
		  much happens to you and you analyse yourself a lot, you see the potential for
		  perhaps getting to somewhere very special on an artistic or a spiritual level
		  and that excites me a lot. And it's the idea of working towards that and
		  perhaps one day, when you're ready for that change, it's like entering a
		  different level of existence, where everything goes slow-mo... it's almost like
		  a religious experience. That's basically what the song's about. </DD>

		<DD> The video of ``<CITE>Suspended in Gaffa</CITE>'' was to be done as

		<DD> I saw it as being the return to simplicity, a light-hearted
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html"> dance</A> routine, no extras, no complicated
		  special effects. [<I>In fact, however, there are many very sophisticated and
		  subtle technical effects in this video, and the production design is very
		  impressive.</I>] As we were all so pleased with the previous sets - put
		  together under the supervision of a very clever man, Steve Hopkins - we asked
		  him to build another, this time an old barn with large gaps in the walls where
		  we could allow the light to streak through. We used a combination of natural
		  and artificial light, and everyone was thrilled with the sense of realism that
		  the set achieved. Steve brought in huge branches of trees that were behind the
		  gaps in the set, and a dedicated helper called ``Podge'' sat up on a piece of
		  scaffolding for six hours and enthusiastically shook a piece of tree to make
		  the light move and dance as if motivated by a furtive wind. The video did
		  remain uncomplicated - just a few effects and just one extra: but a very
		  special. one. There is one section where a child's voice says, ``Mother, where
		  are the angels? I'm scared of the changes.'' And there was only one person that
		  could be addressed to - my mother. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> When I asked her to appear in the section, contrary to my concern
		  about her nerves, she was more than obliging and said, ``Yes.'' She was
		  definitely the star of the day, and waited patiently hour after hour as we
		  slowly moved through the bulk of the shooting to eventually reach her debut. I
		  was amazed at her grace and stamina: as all of us began to wane and wilt, my
		  mother continued to blossom and glow, and her only worries were getting back
		  home in time to get dinner and hoping she would not succumb to an attack of
		  giggles during the vital moments of being on screen. </DD>

		<DD> She needn't have worried, for she is a natural professional, a real
		  star and my favourite mum. (You can see us together in action on the back
