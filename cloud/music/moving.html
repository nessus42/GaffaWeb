		<DD> Yes, yes I did. I actually wrote the song for my teacher, Lindsay
		  Kemp. But the inspiration came from whales, the big fish, you know. They just
		  sing so beautifully, and that's why they are on the beginning of the track.

		<DD> The song is almost biographical. It's about how a person discovers

		<DD> The noise is whale song. Lots of members have written to ask what I
		  think about whale hunting. Well, I'm dead against it. It would be a terrible
		  tragedy if those beautiful and noble animals were wiped out by our greed.
