	 <P><B> How do you feel about <CITE>the whole story?</CITE> were you against
		the release of a compilation album? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I was at first. I was concerned that it would be like a
		  ``k-tel'' record, a cheapo-compo with little thought behind it. It was the
		  record company's decision, and I didn't mind as long as it was well put
		  together. We put a lot of work into the packaging, trying to make it look
		  tasteful, and carefully thought out the running order. And the response has
		  been phenomenal - I'm amazed! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> How do you feel about the video compilation? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Again, I was worried initially, because of the release of <CITE>The
		  Single File</CITE> and <CITE>Hair of the Hound,</CITE> but with the opportunity
		  of getting ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/experiment_iv.html"> Experiment
		  Iv</A></CITE>'' on it, and the record company being sure there was a market, I
		  felt it could be a good idea. We spent a lot of work on ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/experiment_iv.html">Experiment Iv</A></CITE>,'' and because of
		  it almost being an ``adult'' video, we were sure we'd have trouble getting it
		  shown on TV. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Did you have trouble getting it shown? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. The video took a long time to make, and with having to write
		  and record the single with the tightest deadlines I've ever had, the video was
		  needed before we'd finished it. But we did get a minute clip ready in time to
		  be shown when the single was charting, but <CITE>Top of the Pops</CITE> refused
		  to show it, saying it was too violent! It's not violent at all, but we expected
		  a response like this. Pop promos are in a very sensitive area. They're
		  considered ``<A HREF="../subjects/family.html"> family</A> viewing", but there
		  are many sexually ambiguous <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html">videos</A> shown
		  on <A HREF="../subjects/children.html">children</A>'s TV - yet this was
		  considered too extreme. However, <CITE>The Tube</CITE> showed it in its
		  entirety, and it's now showing at the cinema with a feature
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A>, so we've made a sort of B-film!!
		  That's quite exciting. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I noticed that instead of the ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/wow.html">
		Wow</A></CITE>'' video you've pieced together footage from the live shows. Why
		is this? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Two reasons, really. Firstly, I really don't like the promo we did
		  for ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/wow.html">Wow</A></CITE>.'' I think it's silly.
		  And also, looking through the <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html"> videos</A> I
		  noticed a great absence of ``performance'' promos, and the tour was an
		  important part of the story. Also, it makes it a more interesting item for
		  people who have some of the other videos. That way it's not just ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/experiment_iv.html"> Experiment Iv</A></CITE>'' that is a new
		  visual. (1987, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate24.html">KBC 22</A></CITE>)

	 <P> <B> How do you view the changes audially and visually on <CITE>the
		whole story</CITE> album and video? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I really like the idea of the album being available on video - I've
		  always wanted to make a form of video album, but I never thought it would be a
		  compilation! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I see two main changes, although I'm very subjective. Audially, the
		  important step for me was production, which had led on to our own studio. The
		  process is so much more personal because of this. On the first two albums all
		  my arrangements were contained within the piano arrangement, which was the
		  foundation, but which was then handed over to Andrew Powell as producer to
		  interpret with his string arrangements. And the musicians and I worked in my
		  backing <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html"> vocals</A> by playing the tapes over
		  and over and singing along. But being producer I could put a lot less emphasis
		  on the piano arrangement and interpret the song through other instruments onto
		  tape, even playing around with the parts after the musicians had gone, and
		  getting our own studio meant I could build up the song straight onto tape,
		  keeping bits that worked and building up ideas even before the musicians came
		  in. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Visually, I see a shift from being inspired by
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html"> dance</A> (Lindsay Kemp being a big
		  influence), to filmic imagery (being influenced by all the films I
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> so much). I find the combination of
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> and music very exciting, and it's
		  very rare for people to concentrate on both with equal concern - film-makers
		  don't want the music to distract, and musicians don't want the visuals to be
		  stronger than the music. But when it works, it's so powerful! For instance,
		  <CITE>The Wall</CITE>, <CITE>Singing in the Rain</CITE>, <CITE>Amadeus</CITE> -
		  there are definitely people moving this way more and more. It's great. (1987,

		<DD> It wasn't chronological because we wanted to have a running time
		  that was equal on both sides, otherwise you get a bad pressing. In
		  <A HREF="../subjects/america.html">America</A>, where I'm not very well known,
		  they didn't realise it was a compilation! (1989, Tracks) NEW TRACKS: </DD>
