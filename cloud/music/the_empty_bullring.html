		<DD> This is a song that I first had ideas for quite a few years ago. It
		  is really about someone who is in <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A>
		  with someone who is obsessed with something that is pretty futile. They can't
		  get the person to accept the fact that it is a futile obsession. To put it into
		  a sort of story form: he became a matador, and got gored so badly that he
		  couldn't carry on. But at night he climbs out of the window and runs off to a
		  bullring, when there is no-one there, and he fights a bull that doesn't exist.
