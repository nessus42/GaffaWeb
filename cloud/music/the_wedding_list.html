		<DD> ``<CITE>Wedding list</CITE>'' is about the powerful force of
		  revenge, an unhealthy energy which in this song proves to be a ``killer''

		<DD> That was based on a <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>, a
		  Jeanne Moreau film I once saw on the telly, when the bride's husband was killed
		  and she sought revenge for those responsible. [<I>She spends the next 15
		  minutes relating the plot of the film, ending in a breathless flourish</I>]. It
		  was an <CITE>amazing film.</CITE> Can't remember what it was called, though.
		  [<I>The film, truffaut's tribute to alfred hitchcock, is called <CITE>la mariee
		  etait en noir,</CITE> or <CITE>the bride wore black.</CITE> - ied</I>] (1980,

		<DD> Revenge is so powerful and futile in the situation in the song.
		  Instead of just one person being killed, it's three: her husband, the guy who
		  did it - who was right on top of the wedding list with the silver plates - and
		  her, because when she's done it, there's nothing left. All her ambition and
		  purpose has all gone into that one guy. She's dead, there's nothing there.

		<DD> Revenge is a terrible power, and the idea is to show that it's so
		  strong that even at such a tragic time it's all she can think about. I find the
		  whole aggression of human beings fascinating - how we are suddenly whipped up
		  to such an extent that we can't see anything except that. Did you see the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> <CITE>Deathwish,</CITE> and the way
		  the audience reacted every time a mugger got shot? Terrible - though I cheered,
		  myself. (1981, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i80_rm.html">Record
