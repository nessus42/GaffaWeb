	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> What, sort of pickpockets in the east end, et cetera? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah. It's about amateur robbers who have only done small things,
		  and this is quite a big robbery that they've been planning for months, and when
		  it actually starts happening, they start freaking out. They're really scared,
		  and they're so aware of the fact that something could go wrong that they just
		  freaked out, and paranoid and want to go home. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Really? Is this based on any kind of
		<A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No. It's sort of all the films I've seen with robberies in, the
		  crooks have always been incredibly in control and calm, and I always thought
		  that if I ever did a robbery, I'd be really scared, you know, I'd be really
		  worried. So I thought I'm sure that's a much more human point of view. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Yeah. You see I thought it might be based on a
		<A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>. It was on telly over christmas. It
		was about a guy who was blackmailed into doing a robbery and of course he
		really was scared, the further he got involved in it and he had to carry it
		out. But he was having the sleepless nights and stuff. [<I>Kate makes noises
		expressing interest throughout this - it's clear that she has not seen the
		film.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> How did he get blackmailed? Because he'd murdered someone? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> He'd been in prison a long time, and therefore when the robbery
		took place the mafia bosses who were organising it knew they had a stool
		pigeon, and so they got him to do it. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Great! Yeah, a similar sort of thing, isn't it? I'm sure a lot of
		  these young kids, when they actually get into a situation where it is not just
		  a little job, they must be really scared. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Yeah. What made you think about it? I mean, have you run into these
		east end types before? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, no. I think it was much more the thing of watching a lot of
		  films, things like <CITE>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,</CITE> you know.
		  There are lots of films where robberies take place and yet they glorify them,
		  they always make the robbery something very heroic and fun, risky and
		  dangerous, but for me it's something incredibly scary, something that has such
		  a potential of going wrong that it's not worth the risk, and I don't think it's
		  something that should be glorified at all. I think it's something that should
		  be made very real, so that people realize it's not worth the effort - it's not
		  something that's fun, it's something that's just not worth the effort. You'll
		  end up in gaol for thirty years! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And is that the video that you were shooting in the train carriage
		on the way up to manchester, or practicing for it? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That was the one we were practicing for, yes, but only because we
		  didn't have any time, because that show came up at the last minute and we were
		  planning to rehearse all that night, so instead of doing it in the studio, we
		  did it in the back of the train. [<I>Laughs</I>] I couldn't see anything! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And how many of there were you in that guard's van? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There were just the three of us. They cleared it out for us - it was
		  really great of them, actually. Each station we stopped at there'd be various
		  guards who would pull the window down and go 'alright, then?', because they
		  were just checking us out. It was great - they cleared out all the postings,
		  chickens and pigs, and all the other things. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> You get some odd things, don't you? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> So it was a completely empty carriage, it was beautiful. The only
		  thing was we could hardly hear the tape recorder, because the noise was so bad,
		  so we were more of less having to, sort of, keep checking, and it was very hard
		  to stay stationary at a hundred and fifty miles an hour! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And that's how that kind of <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">

	 <P> </P>

	 <P> <B> That should be interesting. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> One of the bits in the song is all about waiting, and how the first
		  time they're just waiting for something to go wrong, and the second time
		  they're just waiting for the guy to blow the safe up, because when he blows it
		  up, there is so much that could go wrong. It's a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">dance</A> routine that's based on waiting.

	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's just all these ideas of people waiting. And the rest of the

	 <P> <B> How did ``<CITE>there goes a tenner</CITE>'' come together?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That was written on the piano. I had an idea for the tune and just
		  knocked out the chords for the first verse. The words and everything just came
		  together. It was quite a struggle from there on to try to keep things together.
		  The lyrics are quite difficult on that one, because there are a lot of words in
		  quite a short space of time. They had to be phrased right and everything. That
		  was very difficult. Actually the writing went hand-in-hand with the CS-80.
		  </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> It's easy to hear how the piano was used for the verses, but what
		about the choruses? Those sections are very uncharacteristic of what you'd
		expect to be written on a piano? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That was really the difficult structure of the song. I could hear
		  what I wanted, but until we put the Synclavier in there - which was played by
		  Dave Lawson - I couldn't get the full picture. I really liked what we did in
		  that. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i85_key.html">Keyboard</A></CITE>)

		<DD> Yeah, that's right. So it's like maybe they get a bit cocky... I
		  dunno, I've never done a robbery, but I think that in a situation like that
		  you'd almost try to be like the person you admire so perhaps they'd be like
		  Cagney and George Raft. They idea was nothing like deep - it was just handy!
		  The real challenge of that song was to make it a story but also keep it like a

	 <P> <B> A song of yours for which the symbolism in the lyrics really

		just a simple song about bank robbery, but the more I look at it, the more it

		<DD> Yes. It's very much a song about bank robbery. I wouldn't say it was

	 <P> <B> I dunno. It seems like...well, to me it seems every line sort of
		could parallel your <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html"> recording</A> career.
		I won't go and explain it, but like one example is ``there goes a tenner.''
		``tenner'' could be a ten-dollar [<I>Sic</I>] bill - it could also be a level
