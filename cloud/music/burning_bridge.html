	 <P><B> "<CITE>Burning bridge,</CITE>'' the other song on your ``<CITE><A
		HREF="../music/cloudbusting.html"> cloudbusting</A></CITE>'' single, seems to
		be a more desperate retelling to me of a much earlier song of yours, ``<CITE><A
		HREF="../music/passing_through_air.html"> passing through air</A></CITE>,''
		could you say something about ``<CITE>burning bridge</CITE>?" </B></P>

		<DD> Um...Again it was a song that was totally created for a b-side, and
		  I knew that it was going on the other side of ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/cloudbusting.html"> Cloudbusting</A></CITE>.'' ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/cloudbusting.html"> Cloudbusting</A></CITE>'' is not necessarily
		  an up-tempo song and I feel that flips of records should be something that
		  counterbalances the energy of the other side. So, I wanted something that was
		  relatively up-tempo, and just a fun song. I don't think the lyrics are by any
		  means profound, but it was something that I felt was fun to do and was a very
		  different energy from the a-side of the record. </DD>

	 <P> <B> It's sort of... I don't know if it's incredibly... I mean it's
		up-tempo, but it still has a sort of desperate sadness to it, don't you think?

		<DD> Actually, I think it's incredibly positive and quite trivial. </DD>
