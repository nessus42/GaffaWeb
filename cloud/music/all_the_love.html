		<DD> Although we are often surrounded by people and friends, we are all
		  ultimately alone, and I feel sure everyone feels lonely at some time in their
		  life. I wanted to write about feeling alone, and how having to hide emotions
		  away or being too scared to show <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> can
		  lead to being lonely as well. </DD>

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There are just some times when you can't cope and you just don't
		  feel you can talk to anyone. I go and find a bathroom, a toilet or an empty
		  room just to sit and let it out and try to put it all together in my mind. Then
		  I go back and face it all again. </DD>

		<DD> I think it's sad how we forget to tell people we
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> that we do love them. Often we think
		  about these things when it's too late or when an extreme situation forces us to
		  show those little things we're normally too shy or too lazy to reveal. </DD>

		<DD> One of the ideas for the song sparked when I came home from the
		  studio late one night. I was using an answering machine to take the day's
		  messages and it had been going wrong a lot, gradually growing worse with time.
		  It would speed people's voices up beyond recognition, and I just used to hope
		  they would ring back again one day at normal speed. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This particular night, I started to play back the tape, and the
		  machine had neatly edited half a dozen messages together to leave ``Goodbye",
		  ``See you!", ``Cheers", ``See you soon'' .. It was a strange thing to sit and
		  listen to your friends ringing up apparently just to say goodbye. I had several
		  cassettes of peoples' messages all ending with authentic farewells, and by
		  copying them onto 1/4'' tape and re-arranging the order, we managed to
		  synchronize the ``callers'' with the last verse of the song. </DD>

		<DD> There are still quite a few of my friends who have not heard the
		  album or who have not recognised themselves and are still wondering how they
		  managed to appear in the album credits when they didn't even set foot into the
		  studio. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate14.html">KBC 12</A></CITE>)

		<DD> We've also been using an awful lot of compression on the new album -
		  with nearly everything, in fact. It's interesting, the kind of dynamics you can
		  actually create, which is what I really never understood before. Especially
		  with voices: as you start compressing them more and more, so many different
		  levels start coming through on it - the breath particularly. And for me, that's
		  as important as the words: it's the space in between. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> In ``<CITE>all the love</CITE>'' the ``sighs'' seem to be important
		in this way. </B></P>

		<DD> Yes, it's the idea of using the breath as a voice. There was another
		  backing vocal sung by our engineer, and it's fantastic, because in the gaps
		  there are these huge passages of him going ``haahuuh!'' where you can feel the
		  breath moving past. (1982, <CITE><A
