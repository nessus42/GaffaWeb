		<DD> The song is called ``<CITE>Get Out of My House,</CITE>'' and it's
		  all about the human as a house. The idea is that as more experiences actually
		  get to you, you start learning how to defend yourself from them. The human can
		  be seen as a house where you start putting up shutters at the windows and
		  locking the doors - not letting in certain things. I think a lot of people are
		  like this - they don't hear what they don't want to hear, don't see what they
		  don't want to see. It is like a house, where the windows are the eyes and the
		  ears, and you don't let people in. That's sad because as they grow older people
		  should open up more. But they do the opposite because, I suppose, they
		  <CITE>do</CITE> get bruised and cluttered. Which brings me back to myself; yes,
		  I have had to decide what I will let in and what I'll have to exclude. (1982,

		<DD> <CITE>The Shining</CITE> is the only book I've read that has
		  frightened me. While reading it I swamped[<I>???</I>] around in its snowy
		  imagery and avoided visiting certain floors of the big, cold hotel, empty for
		  the winter. As in <CITE>Alien,</CITE> the central characters are isolated,
		  miles (or light years) away from anyone or anything, but there is something in
		  the place with them. They're not sure what, but it isn't very nice. </DD>

		<DD> The setting for this song continues the theme - the house which is
		  really a human being, has been shut up - locked and bolted, to stop any outside
		  forces from entering. The person has been hurt and has decided to keep
		  everybody out. They plant a ``concierge'' at the front door to stop any
		  determined callers from passing, but the thing has got into the house upstairs.
		  It's descending in the lift, and now it approaches the door of the room that
		  you're hiding in. You're cornered, there's no way out, so you turn into a bird
		  and fly away, but the thing changes shape, too. You change, it changes; you
		  can't escape, so you turn around and face it, scare it away. </DD>

		<DD> The track kept changing in the studio. This is something that's
		  never happened before on an album. That one was maybe half the length it is
		  now. The guitarist got this really nice riff going, and I got this idea of two
		  voices - a person in the house, trying to get away from this thing, but it's
		  still there. So in order to get away, they change their form - first into a
		  bird trying to fly away from it. The thing can change as well, so
		  <CITE>that</CITE> changes into this wind, and starts blowing all icy. The idea
		  is to turn around and face it. You've got this <A
		  HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A> of something turning round and going
		  ``Aah!'' just to try and scare it away. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> They're very often ideas that come out of other people's creations.
		  Films and <A HREF="../subjects/books.html">books</A> are very much big
		  inspirations to me. For instance, there's a track on this album that was...
		  really the whole atmosphere was inspired by <CITE>The Shining</CITE>. I read
		  the book and it was such an incredibly strong atmosphere, very creepy, very
		  haunted, and I used it to like set a song using the same atmosphere, but
		  instead of it being a hotel it being like a house, which is also a human being.
		  And just playing with the feelings that I got when I read the book and trying
		  to put that same kind and strangeness into the song. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> For me that's how real situations are. Whenever I've experienced a
		  relationship, or the people around me have, it's always ended up being
		  incredibly complicated because that's the way human beings are. Nothing is
		  simple, it always ends up being something else or dying and that's what I find
		  so interesting - the drive behind human beings and the way they get screwed up.

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The idea with that song is that the house is actually a human being
		  who's been hurt and he's just locking all the doors and not letting anyone in.
		  The person is so determined not to let anyone in that one of his personalities
		  is a concierge who sits in the door, and says ``you're not coming in here'' -
		  like real mamma. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i82_mm.html">Melody

	 <P> <B> I find the use of strong symbolism and metaphor and allusions in
		your lyrics to be extremely interesting. For example, in ``<CITE>get out of my
		house,</CITE>'' the woman who is singing the song has been left by her lover
		and feels hurt, and identifies herself with a house. This is a biblical
		allusion. When she says ``I wash the panes", it is a triple entendre, because
		she's saying she's washing the windows of her body, which are the eyes. This
		means she's crying, and by doing so, she's washing the hurt and pain away. Then
		she says ``no stranger's feet will enter me'' saying that she won't let anyone
		into her house, which is saying she won't let anyone into her body, which is
		also reinforced by the biblical use of ``feet'' as a euphemism for ``private
		parts'' The layers of meaning here, are pretty incredible. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Then a man tries to enter her life again, but she's too scared, and
		she tries to escape by <A HREF="../subjects/flying.html"> flying</A> away, but
		he turns into the wind. She then turns into a mule, perhaps for its stubborn
		ability to withstand the wind. And then he also turns into a mule. Now it seems
		that they have a ground for communication. Because mules are neuter, and they
		can communicate on a platonic level rather than a sexual level. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Now a friend of mine believes that this last part is a flaw in the
		song, because mules are not really neuter after all. They are only sterile.
		Personally, I think it isn't a flaw because the idea comes across loud and
		clear to me, and somehow it seems that ``I change into the amoeba: Ooze!
		Ooze!'' just wouldn't work so well. So the question is, what do you think of
		this interpretation? And could you respond to my friend's slight criticism?

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And what was your friend's criticism? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> He said that the ending is a flaw because mules are not really
		neuter, they are only sterile. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> What does he mean? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, it seems to me - and to him - that the end of the song is
		sort of a positive note because they've found a grounds for communication. And
		sort of on a platonic level, because mules might be seen as being platonic,
		because... </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Why? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Oh... Well... Mules are sterile... Uh... A donkey and a horse...
		You know... Have a sexual relationship, and then they have mules, and mules
		don't have <A HREF="../subjects/children.html"> children</A>, but they really
		can have sex. They just can't have children, but a lot of people actually think
		that they just don't have sex. Which isn't really true. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Right! Well, um... I think you... It's kind of weird the level of
		  interpretation that you are reading into things, because... I mean, a mule - in
		  our country - all it represents is a stupid animal. They are considered stupid.
		  [<I>This, of course, is the dominant significance of the mule as a symbol in
		  the united states, as well. The expression ``stubborn as a mule'' is
		  considerably better known in both countries than the sterile condition of the
		  animal - as the interviewer ought to know. - ied</I>] and that's the allusion
		  that was being used in that case. And it's very much a play on a traditional
		  song called <CITE>The Two Magicians</CITE> about someone who's trying to escape
		  someone, and they keep changing their form in order to escape them. But the
		  other thing keeps changing its form. And that's actually what the whole song is
		  about - someone who is running away from something they don't want to face, but
		  wherever they go, the thing will follow them. Basically, you can't run away
		  from things - you've got to confront things. And it's using the person as the
		  imagery of a house, where they won't let anyone in, they lock all the doors and
		  windows, and put a guard on the front door. But I think the essence of the song
		  is about someone trying to run away from things they don't like and not being
		  able to escape - because you can't. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But if the symbol of mules is just stupidity, at the end, then it
		would seem like it would be a negative ending, and it just sort of seems to me,
		most of your songs...a lot of them...end on up notes. And it sort of seemed
		like it was a positive note at the end. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think the mule is that kind of... the stupid confrontation...
		  I mean, there's not really that much to read into it. It was the idea of
		  playing around with changing shape, and the mule imagery was something I liked
		  audially. The whole thing of this wild, stupid, mad creature just turning
		  around and going, you know, ``Eeyore! Eeyore!'' [<I>Kate makes convincing
		  eeyore sounds.</I>] I don't know if you saw <CITE>Pinocchio</CITE>, but there's
		  an incredibly heavy scene in there, where one of the little boys turns into a
		  donkey - a mule. And it's very heavy stuff. </DD>
