	 <H1> Leave It Open </H1> 
	 <P><B> "<CITE>Leave it open</CITE>'' is the idea of human beings being like
		cups - like receptive vessels. We open and shut ourselves at different times.
		It's very easy to let you ego go ``nag nag nag'' when you should shut it. Or
		when you're very narrow-minded and you should be open. Finally you should be
		able to control your levels of receptivity to a productive end. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> Like cups, we are filled up and emptied with feelings, emotions -
		  vessels breathing in, breathing out. This song is about being open and shut to
		  stimuli at the right times. Often we have closed minds and open mouths when
		  perhaps we should have open minds and shut mouths. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This was the first demo to be recorded, and we used a Revox and the
		  few effects such as a guitar chorus pedal and an analogue delay system. We
		  tried to give the track an Eastern flavour and the finished demo certainly had
		  a distinctive mood. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There are lots of different vocal parts, each portraying a separate
		  character and therefore each demanding an individual sound. When a lot of
		  <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html">vocals</A> are being used in contrast rather
		  than ``as one,'' more emphasis has to go on distinguishing between the
		  different voices, especially if the vocals are coming from one person. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> To help the separation we used the effects we had. When we mastered
		  the track, a lot more electronic effects and different kinds of echoes were
		  used, helping to place the <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html"> vocals</A> and
		  give a greater sense of perspective. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Every person who came into the studio was given the ``end backing

	 <P> <B> One track from <CITE><A HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html">

		<DD> Yes. We actually have a thing going in this country where there are
		  people who write in every week with a new version of what they think has been
		  said at the end of the song, and no one has gotten it yet. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think there are only about three or four people who actually know
		  what has been said there. I really like that, though - the idea of all these
		  people sitting and listening over and over to the ending and wondering what's
		  being said. It's lovely, like a game. (1983, <CITE><A

		<DD> Talking about ``guessing", at last someone has discovered what's
		  being said at the end of ``<CITE>Leave It Open</CITE>'' - well done! But let me
		  tell you about some of the fascinating encounters I've had. There is a Mr. John
		  Reimers from the U.S.A. who has rung up once a week with his new version: </DD>

		<DD> "Is it...?" </DD>

		<DD> John, you're terrific! </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But I'm afraid this is just a mild case. One night I woke up to a
		  tapping on the window. It was someone hanging from a nearby tree by their feet.
		  In their hands was a card, and written on it was: ``Is it 'We paint the
		  penguins pink?''' I'm afraid I had to laugh, and shook my head. They burst into
		  tears and ran off into the moonlight. But I think the cleverest was a phone
		  call I had the other week. </DD>

		<DD> "You know, it's ridiculous. I was sitting here listening to the end

		<DD> But seriously, I have enjoyed your guesses tremendously, but I have
