		<DD> It's about a relationship being a very finely balanced thing that
		  can be easily thrown off by a third party. The whole thing really came from a
		  line in <CITE>The Godfather,</CITE> during some
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html"> family</A> argument, when Marlon Brando
		  says, ``Don't interfere, it's between a man and a woman.'' It's exploring the
		  idea of trying to keep a relationship together, how outside forces can break
		  into it... Rubbish really, but I quite like the cello. (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> "<CITE>Between a man and a woman</CITE>'' is almost a soap opera
		situation, with you trying to drive off any external interference which might
		ruin the chances of a relationship's natural growth. It's like you're saying we
		live in a fast culture - fast food, fast-edit tv, disposable pop, disposable
		sex - and, if we don't get instant gratification, we're not interested. You
		seem angry and determined. </B></P>

		<DD> Well, that's nice, because when people ask me about this song, in
		  terms of having to talk about it, it's rubbish. But yes, I think you're right,
		  it is perhaps about how you actually have that choice sometimes, whether to
		  interfere or not. You know, there's this tendency to want to leap in and take
		  over and control: ``Oh, I know best!"; when I think a relationship is a very
		  delicate balance: it's very easily tipped, and then needs to be refound
		  again.'' (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i89_mm.html">Melody

		<DD> Often it's not your problem. You have to do the right thing,
		  whatever feels right. Modern relationships are plagued with these problems.

		<DD> That was, let's get a groove going at the piano, and a pretty
		  straightforward Fairlight pattern. Then we got the drummer in, and I thought
		  that maybe it was taking on a slightly Sixties feel - not that it is. So we got
		  Alan [<I>Murphy, level 42 guitarist</I>] in to play guitar - who unfortunately
		  wasn't credited - a printing error. He played some smashing guitar. Then I
		  wanted to work with the cellist again, because I think the cello is such a
		  beautiful instrument. I find it very male and female - not one or the other.
		  He's actually the only player that I've ever written out music for. They're
		  lucky if they get chord <A HREF="../subjects/charts.html"> charts</A> normally.

		<DD> We were just playing around with a groove. We actually had a second
		  verse that was similar to the first, and I thought it was really boring. I
		  hated it, so it sat around for about six months. So I took it into a completely
		  different section which worked much better. Just having that little bit on the
		  front worked much better. Quite often I have to put things aside and think
		  about them if they just haven't worked. If you leave a little time, it's
		  surprising how often you can come back and turn it into something. (1989,
