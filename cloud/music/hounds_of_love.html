		<DD> The second song is called ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html"> Hounds of Love,</A></CITE>'' and is
		  really about someone who is afraid of being caught by the hounds that are
		  chasing him. I wonder if everyone is perhaps ruled by fear, and afraid of
		  getting into relationships on some level or another. They can involve pain,
		  confusion and responsibilities, and I think a lot of people are particularly
		  scared of responsibility. Maybe the being involved isn't as horrific as your
		  imagination can build it up to being - perhaps these baying hounds are really
		  friendly. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate20.html">KBC 18</A></CITE>)

		<DD> The ideas for ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">
		  Hounds Of Love</A></CITE>", the title track, are very much to do with
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> itself and people being afraid of it,
		  the idea of wanting to run away from love, not to let love catch them, and trap
		  them, in case th hounds might want to tear them to pieces and it's very much
		  using the imagery of love as something coming to get you and you've got to run
		  away from it or you won't survive. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Open

		<DD> "<CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">Hounds of

		  sees it as a simile of a pack of hounds that are chasing them. And instead of
		  being happy about it, terrified, so they're running for their life really.

		<DD> I think that everyone is scared of relationship on some level or

		  and white movie called <CITE>Night of the Demon</CITE>, which is just one of
		  those great movies that managed to get through a whole phase of other movies
		  that were incredibly corny and not effective, and has a real atmosphere about
		  it. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/iv85_ca3.html">Good Rockin

		called <CITE>night of the demon</CITE>. It's all about this demon that appears

		<DD> "<CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">Hounds of
		  Love</A></CITE>'' is the third single, and trying to follow the ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/cloudbusting.html">
		  Cloudbusting</A></CITE>'' video was extremely difficult. I still wanted to
		  follow the approach of making ``a short <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">
		  film</A>", and this time we wanted to suggest a piece of ``Hitchcock": a short
		  thriller. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Paddy inspired me into a <CITE>39 Steps</CITE> theme, and for the
		  two-three weeks over Christmas my life became this third video. It was
		  particularly hard organising meetings over Christmas; everyone was busy
		  partying. At one meeting someone turned up in fancy dress. The advantage was
		  that I got a brilliant crew who were free to do the shoot because it was
		  Christmas-time, generally a very quiet period. If you get to see the video, let
		  us know if you spot Hitchcock's appearance? </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Even with the work over Christmas we were still in a situation where
		  the twelve-inch and the b-side had to be rushed. Sometimes things benefit from
		  the pressure, but with only a few hours to do the b-side before the cut (which
		  had been arranged weeks before), we plumped for a totally unaccompanied
		  traditional song. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The twelve-inch of ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html"> Hounds of Love</A></CITE>'' has been
		  the most demanding so far. It's a short song, with very little tuned
		  instrumentation, so we decided to go for an alternative lead vocal over the
		  existing track, with a few changes here and there - it seemed an interesting
		  solution. Del and I re-did the vocal, the b-side and the mixes in two days
		  (that's some kind of record for me!) (1986, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> She grimaces a little selfconsciously at the mention of the video.
		That was my first real direction, she says, and then continues confidently. I
		find in incredibly exciting, and in some ways a bit frustrating that it's
		disciplined to the song that has been chosen as the single because quite often
		a song is a song in its own right, and sometimes songs] have much better
		storylines for <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html"> videos</A>. They're more
		visually oriented. So when you're working with a song that is not particularly
		visually oriented, it's incredibly frustrating. Especially if you know there is
		another song on the album that would be more visual. (1990, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> When I first heard the title of your new album <CITE><A
		HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html"> hounds of love</A></CITE>, a long
		time before the album was actually released, it seemed to me like a reference
		to fans. It sort of conjured up the <A HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A>
		of <A HREF="../subjects/the_beatles.html">the beatles</A> constantly being
		hounded by their adoring fans, who would attack them, because each fan wanted a
		little piece of their idols. So the title <CITE><A
		HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html"> hounds of love</A></CITE> seems to
		hint at a <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A>/hate relationship with
		fans. The love/hate relationship also seems to be symbolized on the picture
		sleeve to ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/running_up_that_hill.html"> running up that
		hill,</A></CITE>'' where you are aiming a bow that could be cupid's bow, but is
		also a deadly weapon. Did you have these things in mind? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No. I'd like to say straight away it's absolutely nothing to do with
		  a <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>/hate relationship with fans and, in
		  fact, that, as far as I am concerned, is something that doesn't exist. I have
		  no resentment or dislike for any of the people that like my music, at all. If
		  anything, it's a great honor for me that such nice people are attracted by the
		  music. And that song has nothing to do with fans - it's about love - it's about
		  someone who's afraid of being captured by love, and it's seeing love as a pack
		  of hounds that's coming to get them. As something they're frightened of - not
		  willing to accept. </DD>
