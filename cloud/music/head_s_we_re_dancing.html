		<DD> That's a very dark song, not funny at all! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> <CITE>"It was</CITE>'39,<CITE>before the music started."</CITE> did

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, purely coincidental. I wrote the song two years ago, and in lots
		  of ways I wouldn't write a song like it now. I'd really hate it if people were
		  offended by this...But it was all started by a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html"> family</A> friend, years ago, who'd been to
		  dinner and sat next to this guy who was really fascinating, so charming. They
		  sat all night chatting and joking. And next day he found out it was
		  Oppenheimer. And this friend was horrified because he really despised what the
		  guy stood for. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I understood the reaction, but I felt a bit sorry for Oppenheimer.
		  He tried to live with what he'd done, and actually, I think, committed suicide.
		  </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But I was so intrigued by this idea of my friend being so taken by
		  this person until they knew who they were, and then it completely changing
		  their attitude. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> So I was thinking, what if you met the Devil? The Ultimate One:
		  charming, elegant, well spoken. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Then it turned into this whole idea of a girl being at a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html"> dance</A> and this guy coming up, cocky and
		  charming, and she dances with him. Then a couple of days later she sees in the
		  paper that it was Hitler. Complete horror: she was that close, perhaps could've
		  changed history. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Hitler was very attractive to women because he was such a powerful
		  figure, yet such an evil guy. I'd hate to feel I was glorifying the situation,
		  but I do know that whereas in a piece of <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">
		  film</A> it would be quite acceptable, in a song it's a little bit sensitive.

	 <P> <B> I must ask you this - you must know what this one's about. It's
		called ``<CITE>heads</CITE>we're<CITE>dancing</CITE>'' and... I read the lyrics
		here - well, no, I'm not going to read them out but you just tell me what gave
		you the idea for this song. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This is the darkest song on the album and I think, in some ways,
		  it's not a song I would write now. But I had a friend who went to this dinner,
		  years ago. He was sitting next to this guy all evening and they were chatting -
		  they had some of the most incredible conversations: he was so impressed with
		  this guy. He was so intellectual and charming; so well-read, you know. He just
		  thought this guy was perfect - the chemistry between them... wonderful! They
		  talked all night. And the next day, he went up to his friend who had arranged
		  the evening and he said, ``Who was that guy I was sitting next to last night?
		  He was fascinating!'' And the guy said to him, ``Oh, didn't you know? That was
		  Oppenheimer!'' And my friend's reaction was absolute horror, because he had no
		  idea. And if he had known, he said he would never have behaved like that. He's
		  not even sure he would have spoken to the guy because he had such strong
		  feelings of hatred for everything that man represented. I thought that was
		  really a bizarre and interesting situation, that he should really have liked
		  this guy. He was sitting there with this person and he really liked him. But as
		  soon as he knew the guy's name, he almost wanted to throw up in absolute
		  disgust, he was so turned off by what this guy represented. And I thought, in
		  some ways it must have been a wonderful relief for Oppenheimer that night. I
		  think he himself perhaps paid the price - you know what I mean? He did not have
		  an easy conscience, that man. And I was thinking this was very interesting: the
		  idea of someone you found so charming, and later you find out they're the most
		  horrific thing you can imagine. And I thought, well, this is kind of like the
		  devil, isn't it? Where the devil is meant to be very sweet-spoken, very
		  charming, very good looking! Everything that's kind of attractive in order to
		  tempt - temptation is an attractive thing. And I thought, what about the idea
		  of someone who dances with the devil? And then I thought, you can't, you know -
		  it has to be a human. Who is the nearest thing to the embodiment of the devil?
		  It's Hitler: he is the personification of evil, as far as you can think of a
		  single being out of history. It's a very dark idea, but it's the idea of this
		  girl who goes to a big ball; very expensive, romantic, exciting, and it's 1939,
		  before the war starts. And this guy, very charming, very sweet-spoken, comes up
		  and asks her to <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">dance</A> but he does it by
		  throwing a coin and he says, ``If the coin lands with heads facing up, then we
		  dance!'' Even that's a very attractive ``come on", isn't it? And the idea is
		  that she enjoys his company and dances with him and, days later, she sees in
		  the paper who it is, and she is hit with this absolute horror - absolute
		  horror. What could be worse? To have been so close to the man... she could have
		  tried to kill him... she could have tried to change history, had she known at
		  that point what was actually happening. And I think Hitler is a person who
		  fooled so many people. He fooled nations of people. And I don't think you can
		  blame those people for being fooled, and maybe it's these very charming
		  people... maybe evil is not always in the guise you expect it to be. (1989,

		<DD> Years ago this friend of mine went to a dinner and spent the whole
		  evening chatting to this fascinating guy, incredibly charming, witty,
		  well-read, but never found out his name. The next day he asked someone else
		  who'd been there who it was. ``Oh, didn't you know? That's Oppenheimer, the man
		  who invented the atomic bomb.'' My friend was horrified because he thought he
		  should have given the guy hell, attacked him, he didn't know what. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But the point was one moment this person is charming, then when you
		  find out who he is, he's completely different. So I thought, Who's the worst
		  person you could possibly meet in those circumstances? Hitler! And the story
		  developed. A woman at a <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html"> dance</A> before the
		  war and this guy comes up to her tossing a coin with this cocky chat-up line,
		  Heads we're dancing. She doesn't recognise him until she sees his face in the
		  paper later on and then she's devastated. She thinks that if she'd known she
		  might have been able to *get* him and change the course of history. But he was
		  a person who fooled a tremendous number of people and I don't think they can be
		  blamed. It worries me a bit that this song could be received wrongly, though.

	 <P> <B> What was the inspiration behind that? This, well, once again it's
		unusual - in sort of a pop context. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it's a very dark song, and it's certainly a song I don't think
		  I'd write now. But I guess it was inspired a) by the idea of, I mean one of the
		  fairy tale images for a little girl, is to go to a fantastic ball, like
		  Cinderella does, and she meets this handsome, supposedly, prince. It was the
		  reversal of the idea. He was like the worst person you could possibly meet. But
		  that really sprung from a story that a friend of mine told me who had been at a
		  dinner years ago, and had spent the evening sitting next to this incredibly
		  charming man. Very intelligent, very witty, he just loved his company so much.
		  The next day he asked the host ``Who was that man I was sitting next to. He was
		  fascinating.'' They said, ``Didn't you realize, that was Oppenheimer.'' Now, my
		  friend's reaction to that was absolute horror, because for him Oppenheimer
		  represented such evil, because of his work with the bomb. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Sure. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But in some ways I felt a little sorry for Oppenheimer, because i
		  think he really paid for himself. He was - he committed suicide, he couldn't
		  handle what he'd done. But the whole idea of the story was so fascinating for
		  me, that he'd been so taken by this man until he knew who he was, and then it
		  was like a complete reversal. I guess that hung around in my head and I was
		  thinking, really, who's the closest embodiment to the devil, who is the most
		  evil person ever, and I think - </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, who else is there, really? But I would really hate anyone to be
		  offended by the song. It's not meant to be a glorification of that whole event.
		  It's just meant to be an exploration of the idea that evil quite often appears
		  in a charming guise, and we should all be careful. He fooled so many people,
		  and I don't think you can blame them for being fooled. But it's terrifying,
		  isn't it? </DD>

		<DD> It's the darkest track on the album and not the sort of song I'd

		  people and there's no way you could blame anyone for being fooled by that man.

		<DD> Well its a very dark story and I really think its not a song I would

		  found absolutely fascinating. And the next day he said to the host who was that
		  person I was sitting next to last night and they said that it was Oppenheimer,
		  the guy who'd been involved in creating the bomb. And my friend's react horror
		  because he just really hated what this guy stood for. His feelings completely
		  changed about the guy soon as he knew who he was. And I found that really
		  interesting, that you could be with somebody fun and so charming but then find
		  out at one point who they are, you know, its like a completely different story.
		  So I was thinking of, you know, the fairy tale of little girls where they go to
		  a ball and then they meet the charming mysterious stranger who turns out to be
		  a prince. And I was thinking, really who is the worst person you can meet as a
		  stranger, who is the embodiment of evil, you know the closest thing to the
		  Devil. And of course really the only person that stands out there in modern
		  history is Hitler and so its really saying that evil people can be so charming
		  and its so easy to be fooled by people and it's saying that how often evil
		  comes in a charming guise. So its really just exploring that and I would be
		  very worried if people were offended by the song. I really had no intentions to
		  offend anyone. </DD>
