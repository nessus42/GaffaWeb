		<DD> The song The Kick Inside, the title track, was inspired by a
		  traditional folk song and it was an area that I wanted to explore because it's
		  one that is really untouched and that is one of incest. There are so many songs
		  about <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>, but they are always on such an
		  obvious level. This song is about a brother and a sister who are in love, and
		  the sister becomes pregnant by her brother. And because it is so taboo and
		  unheard of, she kills herself in order to preserve her brother's name in the
		  family. The actual song is in fact the suicide note. The sister is saying ``I'm
		  doing it for you'' and ``Don't worry, I'll come back to you someday.'' (1978,

		  about a young girl and her brother who fall desperately in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>. It's an incredibly taboo thing. She
		  becomes pregnant by her brother and it's completely against all morals. She
		  doesn't want him to be hurt, she doesn't want her
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html"> family</A> to be ashamed or disgusted, so
		  she kills herself. The song is a suicide note. She says to her brother, ``Don't

		directly back to ``lucy wan.'' and in fact there were one or two experiments at
		the time of <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html"> recording</A> the album where
		actual sections from ``lucy wan'' were taken and processed and used in a very
		unusual way, which I'm not going to tell you about because we might try and use

		find the song ``lucy wan", you'll find all the inspiration for it. (1985,

		<DD> I think that is one of the most incredible phenomenas of the world,
		  the fact that two people can produce another person. I think it's just
		  incredible. And I think a lot of people don't respect that amazing thing
		  enough, I think to many people treat it in a selfish way. (1979, <CITE><A
