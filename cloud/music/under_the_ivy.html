	 <P><B> Those songs which you've used as flip-sides on singles, like
		``<CITE><A HREF="../music/warm_and_soothing.html">warm and
		soothing</A></CITE>", `` the empty bullring'' and ``<CITE>under the
		ivy,</CITE>'' on which you simply accompany yourself on the piano with no other
		arrangement, were those tracks recorded originally just as demos? </B></P>

		<DD> No, they weren't, but in a way they are just demos... ``<CITE>Under
		  The Ivy</CITE>'' we did in our studio in just an afternoon. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I read an interview where the interviewer asked you if ``<CITE><A
		HREF="../music/running_up_that_hill.html"> running up that hill</A></CITE>'' is
		about the contemplation of suicide. And I thought that was pretty amusing,
		because it seemed to me clearly not to about any such thing at all. On the
		other hand, strangely enough, that's just what ``<CITE>under the ivy</CITE>''
		seems to be about to me. The tone of the song is very, very sad. And it seems
		to be about longing for the lost innocence of youth - perhaps a follow-up to ``
		in search of peter pan'' a white rose is a strong image in the song. And it
		could be a symbol for friendship or innocence, but it could also be a symbol
		for death. You sing ``away from the party", and it seems like you might almost
		mean ``away from the problems and triviality of modern day life'' You sing ``it
		wouldn't take me long to tell you how to find it", and it seems like you might
		almost be addressing death itself. You mention a secret, but never mention what
		it is. Could it be the taboo we have of suicide? What are your feelings about
		this interpretation, and what were your intentions with the song? </B></P>

		<DD> Well, I think... uh, it... perhaps you are reading much more into it
		  than was originally intended when I wrote it. It's very much a song about
		  someone who is sneaking away from a party to meet someone elusively, secretly,
		  and to possibly make <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> with them, or
		  just to communicate, but it's secret, and it's something they used to do and
		  that they won't be able to do again. It's about a nostalgic, revisited moment.

	 <P> <B> Is there any reason why it's so sad? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think it's sad because it's about someone who is recalling a
		  moment when perhaps they used to do it when they were innocent and when they
		  were <A HREF="../subjects/children.html">children</A>, and it's something that
		  they're having to sneak away to do privately now as adults. (1985, <CITE><A
		  HREF="../../dreaming/doug_int.html"> Love-Hounds</A></CITE>) </DD>
