		<DD> Quite honestly, I don't think I would have chosen those five. It has
		  very much to do with the record company and what they see a market for. I did
		  want ``<CITE><A HREF="sat_in_your_lap.html"> Sat In Your Lap</A></CITE>'' to be
		  on there. It's also quite nice to get the French song on there 'cause I quite
		  like that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> The french song is a new version of ``<CITE><A
		HREF="../music/the_infant_kiss.html"> the infant kiss</A></CITE>", which
		originally appeared in english on her third album <CITE><A
		HREF="../music/never_for_ever_album.html"> never for ever</A></CITE>. The
		french version, as it turned out, was targeted for the canadian record market.

		<DD> I think there's so much aimed at the Canadian market where there's a
		  French population and the song was especially done for the French people, so it
		  made sense to put in on the Canadian version. (1983, <CITE><A
