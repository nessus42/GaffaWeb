		<DD> John Hughes, the American <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>
		  director, had just made this film called _She's<CITE>Having a Baby</CITE>, and
		  he had a scene in the film that he wanted a song to go with. And the film's
		  very light: it's a lovely comedy. His films are very human, and it's just about
		  this young guy - falls in love with a girl, marries her. He's still very much a
		  kid. She gets pregnant, and it's all still very light and child-like until
		  she's just about to have the baby and the nurse comes up to him and says it's a
		  in a breech position and they don't know what the situation will be. So, while
		  she's in the operating room, he has so sit and wait in the waiting room and
		  it's a very powerful piece of film where he's just sitting, thinking; and this
		  is actually the moment in the film where he has to grow up. He has no choice.
		  There he is, he's not a kid any more; you can see he's in a very grown-up
		  situation. And he starts, in his head, going back to the times they were
		  together. There are clips of film of them laughing together and doing up their
		  flat and all this kind of thing. And it was such a powerful visual: it's one of
		  the quickest songs I've ever written. It was so easy to write. We had the piece
		  of footage on video, so we plugged it up so that I could actually watch the
		  monitor while I was sitting at the piano and I just wrote the song to these
		  visuals. It was almost a matter of telling the story, and it was a lovely thing
		  to do: I really enjoyed doing it. </DD>

		<DD> Yes. I don't think it was released here. It was released in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/america.html"> America</A> and did OK, but not really as
		  well as his other films, which have been very successful. But it was a lovely
		  thing to be asked to write for, because it was such a moving piece of film and
		  I really like writing to visuals as well - I find that very exciting. (1989,

		<DD> That's the sequence I had to write the song about, and it's really
		  very moving, him in the waiting room, having flashbacks of his wife and him
		  going for walks, decorating... It's exploring his sadness and guilt: suddenly
		  it's the point where he has to grow up. He'd been such a wally up to this
		  point. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i89_nme2.html">NME</A></CITE>)

		<DD> There's a <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> called
		  _She's<CITE>Having a Baby</CITE>. And John Hughes, the director, rung up and
		  said that he had a sequence in the film that he really wanted a song written to
		  be with. And I'd only worked the once before on the <CITE>Castaway</CITE> film
		  - where I'd really enjoyed that - so I was extremely tempted by the offer. And
		  when he sent the piece of film that the song was going to be [<I>??? Part
		  of</I>], I just thought it was wonderful, it was so moving, a very moving piece
		  of film. And in a way, there was a sense that the whole film built up to this
		  moment. And it was a very easy song to write. It was very quick. And just kind
		  of came, like a lot of songs do. Even if you struggle for months, in the end,
		  they just kind of go - BLAH! - You know. [<I>Laughs</I>]. So that was the first
		  song that I wrote for The Sensual World album. In fact at the time we weren't
		  even sure whether to put it on the album or not. And I must say that Del was
		  very instrumental in saying that I should put it on the album, and I'm very
		  glad I did. Because I had the most fantastic response - in some ways, maybe the
		  greatest response - to this song. And I was really - I was absolutely thrilled,
		  that you felt that way about it. (<A HREF="../../dreaming/chat_90.html">1990

		<DD> John Hughes, the American director, was doing a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> called _She's<CITE>Having a
		  Baby</CITE> - a great film, very nice and comic. And he had this scene which he
		  wanted me to write a song for where it gets very heavy. The film's about this
		  guy who gets married and he likes being a kid, really - very much up in the
		  clouds - and she gets pregnant and they go into hospital, and she's rushed off
		  becuase the baby's in the breach position. </DD>

		<DD> That was a really easy song to put together; all that was added to

		  about four or five bars. But the difference it makes is extraordinary. (1989,

		<DD> I think this is the big problem with song-writing - it's this blank
		  page. You can start anywhere. There's too much to choose from, and I think
		  technology in studios is doing the same to people. There's so much to choose
		  from, so much information, that you're not working within restrictions that
		  actually help you to form a direction. I'm sure that for me, doing this, it was
		  quick and easy because the song had to be about that. It couldn't be about
		  anything else. I think that helps tremendously. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Really, the subject matter in the <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">
		  film</A> laid down the grounds for what the song was about. It's the man
		  waiting in a waiting room while his wife is in there having a baby, and there
		  are complications. So it's the exploration of someone being left on their own
		  in a big way, very suddenly. In this part of the film, the guy has to grow up,
		  he's suddenly confronted with all these terrible things, that he could be a
		  much better human being. It's moments like that that make you feel] these
		  things. </DD>

		<DD> It's a light <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A>, very a young
		  guy whose wife gets pregnant, and everything remains light until they get to
		  the hospital, and suddenly she's rushed away and he's left sitting there. You
		  get the impression that this is the moment when he has to start growing up. Up
		  until then he's been a kid, and very happily so. It's a lovely piece and in
		  some ways it's an exploration of guilt, I guess. (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> What about the obvious complications in making a video from a song

		<DD> It was interesting because the song had originally been written to
		  visuals, but the song has its own storyline as well, so then it was like making
		  a <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> of the song. Obviously (in the
		  movie) it's about a man waiting for wife having a baby. Now I didn't want to
		  put myself in a situation where I have to be pregnant. KATE LAUGHS. It's all
		  too complicated. So left it very ambiguous. And I think it looks like a little
		  film in that it tells a story. So I guess rather than talking about it, it
		  might be nice to let you see it. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> Tim is kind of sitting throughout the song, waiting for his
		  girlfriend or whoever who's in [<I>The</I>] hospital. So most of the video is
		  very distressed. You know, he's in a real distressed state and he sort of looks
		  up, and then the light goes away from the window, this spot comes down. So he's
		  just sitting in this spot and he's like he's suddenly conjuring up these
		  memories. And then I sort of step in with a raincoat and put it 'round his
		  shoulders. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/iv90_vh1.html">VH-1</A></CITE>)
