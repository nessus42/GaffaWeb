		<DD> From the age of 11, Elton John was my biggest hero. I loved his
		  music, had all his albums and I hoped one day I'd play the piano like him (I
		  still do). </DD>

		  choice of a track it was like being asked ``would you like to fulfill a dream?
		  Would you like to be Rocket Man? ...yes, I would. (1991, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Now, you're on this wonderful tribute album to elton john and
		bernie taupin, and did you have a list of which songs were available to choose
		from. How's the choice work? I was really knocked out to be asked to get
		involved in this project, because I was such a big fan of elton's when I was
		little - I really loved his stuff, he was my biggest hero, really, and when I
		was just starting to write songs he was the only songwriter that I knew of that
		played the piano and sung, and wrote songs, so he was very much my idol. And
		one of my favourite songs of his was ``<CITE>rocket man</CITE>'' Now, if I'd
		have known then that I would have been asked to be involved in this project, I
		think I would have just died! And in some ways, I owe it to myself, as that
		little girl to give her the privilege of doing this as well as myself now. And
		they basically said, would we like to be involved and I could choose which
		track I wanted, and because ``<CITE>rocket man</CITE>'' was my favourite I
		hoped it hadn't gone, actually - I hoped no-one else was going to do it.
		</B></P>
	 <P> <B> And what about the arrangement of it, which is very different to
		the original? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, yes I suppose so. I actually haven't heard the original for a
		  very long time, a long long time! [<I>Laughs</I>] And it was just I wanted to
		  do it differently; I do think if you cover records, you should try and make
		  them different - it's like remaking movies, you've got to try and give it
		  something that makes it worth re-releasing. And the reggae treatment just
		  seemed to happen, really. I just tried to put the chords together on the piano,
		  and it just seemed to want to take off in the choruses, so we gave it the
		  reggae treatment. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And now, all of a sudden, it's a hit single. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, yes, and it's even more extraordinary, because we actually
		  recorded the track over two years ago, probably just after my last telly
		  appearance! And we were quite astounded when they wanted to release it as a
		  single just recently. What's very nice is that the guitarist that played on the
		  track, Alan Murphy, who was our guitarist at the time, died not long after the
		  track was made. So this was one of the last things that he did with us, and
		  it's particularly nice for me to feel that it's not only keeping him alive, but
		  I know that he would be really thrilled to know it was doing so well, and it's
		  nice for all of us that loved Al to know that he can be a part of this now.
