		<DD> Most definitely Rocket's Tail. It shows the trio off the most, and
		  sometimes when they're singing, if you're in the same room as them when they're
		  singing, you can hear the air cracking, it's like there's so much harmonic
		  information in their voices [<I>Laughs</I>]. </DD>

		<DD> About ``_Rocket's<CITE>Tail</CITE>'' Oh God, you would ask me about
		  that one [<I>Laughs</I>]. I wrote this for the trio, really, musically, in that
		  I wanted a song that could really show them off. The other two songs that they
		  appear on were already structured and in a way they had to very much fit around
		  the song's structure to become a part of it, but this song they were there en
		  masse, really, the whole song was based around them. And I wrote it on a
		  synthesizer with a choir sound and just sang along. We put John's on and I had
		  no idea if their voices were going to work on it at all, really, so the whole
		  thing hung on the fact of whether when we went out to Bulgaria, whether it
		  worked or not. And the arranger we worked with out there was such a brilliant
		  man. In some ways, I think that the fact that we didn't speak the same language
		  made our communication much easier because he seemed to know exactly what I
		  wanted, and, really, just after a few hours he was coming up with the most
		  incredible tunes, and I just had to say ``Oh yes, I like that one,'' ``Er, no,
		  not too keen on that one,'' ``Umm, that's lovely!'' and just go away and write
		  it out. It was incredible, I've never worked like that before, so quickly with
		  someone I've never met before. It was really exciting to find that kind of
		  chemistry. </DD>

		<DD> Rocket *is* one of my cats, and he was the inspiration for the
		  subject matter for the song, because he's dead cute [<I>Both laugh</I>]. And
		  it's very strange subject matter because the song isn't exactly about Rocket,
		  it's kind of inspired by him and for him, but the song, it's about anything. I
		  guess it's saying there's nothing wrong with being right here at this moment,
		  and just enjoying this moment to its absolute fullest, and if that's it, that's
		  ok, you know. And it's kind of using the idea of a rocket that's so exciting
		  for maybe 3 seconds and then it's gone [<I>Phutt!</I>], you know that's it, but
		  so what, it had 3 seconds of absolutely wonderful... [<I>Both laugh</I>] (1989,

		<DD> Er no, [<I>She finds this hysterically funny</I>] a couple of
		  friends this song was very phallic. I was so concerned I tried to change the
		  ``it was the biggest rocket I could find'' line but ``the most expensive rocket
		  I've ever seen'' wasn't quite the same. It's just the idea a rocket is only
		  there for three seconds but those three seconds are lived fully and totally.

	 <P> <B> Yet she also finds an emotional fury in those same voices. On
		``_rocket's<CITE>tail</CITE>'' she launches
		<A HREF="../subjects/pink_floyd.html"> pink floyd</A>'s david gilmour on a
		screaming feedback guitar coda intertwined with the trio. Well, I'm sure that
		secretly dave has always wanted to be bulgarian, she laughs. Electric guitar

		<DD> It was such a buzz for me to work with him, SHE EXCLAIMS, because
		  obviously I've known him for a long time and he's done little things before,
		  like backing <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html"> vocals</A>. But I've never
		  really had a song where he could just let rip on a guitar - and it was great.

	 <P> <B> "_Rocket's<CITE>tail</CITE>'' is one of those beguiling bush songs
		that have a simple story on the surface, about an eccentric strapping a rocket
		to his back, but you want to know just where it comes from. I'm not sure if
		it's meant to be figured out, says bush, offering little help. If you want to
		figure it out, great; But again, songs should exist in their own space. And if
		they are a curious item, then that's very nice. Some people are, aren't they?

		<DD> It was so good for me to come this full circle where, as you know,
		  Dave was very involved in getting my initial signing to the record company and
		  I'd kinda written this song and I knew I wanted the Bulgarian singers to be the
		  main body of the song. And the idea is that at one point in the song the
		  character dresses up as a rocket and jumps off this bridge, and it just felt so
		  right that <A HREF="../subjects/dave_gilmour.html"> Dave Gilmour</A> should be
		  the rocket - you know, sort of... off the bridge. You know... he's kind of the
		  guitar hero isn't he? (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> No matter how precarious, though, you think
		<A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A>'s worth it, don't you? `` reaching
		out'' is full of danger - the child reaching out to feel the fire, for the hand
		that smacks...you endorse the instinct. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> "_Rocket's<CITE>tail</CITE>'' probably sums up what I'm getting at
		best. In the beginning you scoff at someone else's romantic notion. They say
		they want to be the glorious rocket, and you say you only see ``a stick on
		fire/alone on its journey/home to the quickening ground/with no one there to
		catch it'' But a verse later, you're putting on your pointed hat and strapping
		the stick to your back. It seems to me that <A
		HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> triumphs over cynicism and, whether
		you're dashed to the ground and destroyed by throwing yourself into a
		relationship or whether you survive doesn't matter. The risk, the
		vulnerability's worth taking. It's the only way you're alive, and anything's
		better than the loneliness of, say, `` deeper understanding." </B></P>

		<DD> Yeah! Yeah! There's a lot of that going on on the album, and I'm
		  really pleased that you should hear it: like, ``It might not be easy, but there
		  is a way of getting out of it, so try not to worry too much.'' (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> It was a vehicle to get their voices on a track in as dominant a way
		  as possible. So I put this down with a DX7 choir sound so it had this kind of
		  vocal feel. Then we got a drummer in and got this big Rock 'n' Roll thing
		  going. Then I got some friends in to hear what it would sound like with big
		  block <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html"> vocals</A> singing behind my voice,
		  and although they were English people that sing completely differently, it
		  still gave me a sense of vocal intensity. So these two friends must have spent
		  all day trying to sing like Bulgarians. But it was so useful, because there
		  were so many things I immediately understood we couldn't do, and lots of things
		  it felt like we could do. </DD>

		<DD> So we took it to Bulgaria and started working with this arranger. I
		  told him what I wanted, and he just went off and said ``what about this?'' and
		  they were great. He kept giving me all these things to choose from, and we
		  worked so well together. </DD>

		<DD> It was so good that we decided to hold the drum kit - it was
		  originally starting much earlier in the song. Then we let
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dave_gilmour.html"> Dave Gilmour</A> rip on it, so we'd
		  have this really extreme change from just vocals to this hopefully big Rock 'n'
		  Roll kit, with bass, and guitar solos. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes. He was the inspiration because he's dead cute. The song isn't
		  actually about Rocket. It's inspired by him but the song is saying there is
		  nothing wrong with being right here at this moment and just enjoying it to its
		  absolute fullest. It uses the idea of a rocket that's so exciting for three
		  seconds and then is gone. (1989, <CITE><A
