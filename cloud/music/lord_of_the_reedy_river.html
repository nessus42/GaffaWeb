	 <P><B> It's unbelievable. He [<A HREF="../subjects/donovan.html">
		Donovan</A>] was one of Britain's leading, hit-making solo stars of the sixties
		and a great international artist. And now it's almost as though he'd never
		existed. </B></P>

		<DD> It's ridiculous. I can't stand to see that happen to people,
		  especially someone like him. One of my favourite albums of his is <CITE>H.M.S.
		  Donovan</CITE> - which I think has been deleted now, which is even more
		  ridiculous. And it's beautiful: fantastic illustrated cover; a double album,
		  and each song is either a fairy story or something he's written to other
		  people's words. He's used Blake's poems, he's used some Lewis Carroll - a big
		  selection of fantasy stuff. And one of my favourite tracks from there, which he
		  actually wrote himself to his own music, is ``Lord of the Reedy River.'' (1980,

	 <P> <B> A song written by <A HREF="../subjects/donovan.html"> donovan</A>,
