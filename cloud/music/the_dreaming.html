		<DD> Well, years ago my brother bought ``Sun Arise'' and I loved it, it
		  was such a beautiful song. [<I>An early single by australian musician rolf
		  harris.</I>] And ever since then I've wanted to create something which had that
		  feel of Australia within it. I loved the sound of the traditional aboriginal
		  instruments, and as I grew older, I became much more aware of the actual
		  situation which existed in Australia between the white Australian and the
		  aborigines, who were being wiped out by man's greed for uranium. Digging up
		  their sacred grounds, just to get plutonium, and eventually make weapons out of
		  it. And I just feel that it's so wrong: this beautiful culture being destroyed
		  just so that we can build weapons which maybe one day will destroy everything,
		  including us. We should be learning from the aborigines, they're such a
		  fascinating race. And Australia - there's something very beautiful about that
		  country. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Poppix</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> The title actually came last. It always does. It's the most
		  difficult thing to do. I tried to get a title that would somehow say what was
		  in there. It was really bad. Then I found this book [<I>Hands me huge tome on
		  australian lore</I>]. I'd written a song and hadn't really given it a proper
		  name. I knew all about this time they call Dreamtime, when animals and humans
		  take the same form. It's this big religious time when all these incredible
		  things happen. The other word for it is The Dreaming. I looked at that written
		  down and thought, ``Yeah!'' (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> The song was originally going to be called

		  Aborigines, so I thought it would be an ideal title for the song. ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html"> The Dreaming</A></CITE>'' is such a
		  strong title, too: ``dreaming'' on its own means little, but with ``the'' in

		<DD> That's something that's been growing for years. It started when I

		<DD> The stimulus started years ago, when Paddy bought ``Sun Arise'' by

		<DD> We started with the drums, working to a basic Linn drum machine
		  pattern, making them sound as tribal and deep as possible. This song had to try
		  and convey the wide open bush, the Aborigines - it had to roll around in mud
		  and dirt, try to become a part of the earth. ``Earthy'' was the word used most
		  to explain the sounds. There was a flood of imagery sitting waiting to be
		  painted into the song. The Aborigines move away as the digging machines move
		  in, mining for ore and plutonium. Their sacred grounds are destroyed and their
		  beliefs in Dreamtime grow blurred through the influence of civilization and
		  alcohol. Beautiful people from a most ancient race are found lying in the roads
		  and gutters. Thank God the young Australians can see what's happening. </DD>

		  became wide and deep, effected to the point of becoming voices in a choir. The

		<DD> None of us had met Rolf (Harris) before and we were very excited at

		  armful of dijeridus. He is a very warm man, full of smiles and interesting
		  stories. I explained the subject matter of the song and we sat down and
		  listened to the basic track a couple of times to get the feel. He picked up a
		  dijeridu, placing one end of it right next to my ear and the other at his lips,
		  and began to play. </DD>

		<DD> I've never experienced a sound quite like it before. It was like a

		<DD> Women are never supposed to play a dijeridu, according to Aboriginal

		  away and killed, so it's not surprising that the laws were rarely disobeyed.
		  After the ceremony, the instrument became worthless, its purpose over. (1982,

		<DD> It's interesting how some songs attract lots of ideas - this was

		  Percy Edwards was among the ideas for this song, and he too was a real pleasure
		  to work with. He really is the only man who imitates the voices of animals to
		  the extent that he does, and is greatly respected for his talents. It is so
		  beautiful to watch him burst into birdsong in a studio in the middle of London.
		  I had images of him waking with the dawn chorus, taking part with blackbirds,
		  the sparrows, the thrushes... but we were in the studio with Percy, and there
		  was work to do, so he became sheep, dingoes and Australian magpies. The light

		  Percy, our fire. </DD>

		  kangaroos, but after Paddy and I explained it was the only way to get the sound
		  we wanted, he completely understood the situation and tried to communicate to
		  the kangas what they had to do. The only problem was he couldn't remember the
		  kanga word for ``Dang'' so he worked on ``Boing'' with a ``D'' (1982, <CITE><A

		  So it's not a problem really. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Something else that didn't help, apart from the virtual absence of
		airplay [<I>Kate laughs</I>] was the lack of suitable publicity. Did kate want
		``<CITE><A HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html"> the dreaming</A></CITE>''
		to succeed on the strength of song alone, rather than on an immense publicity
		campaign? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think the problem is that often there aren't publicity
		  campaigns for singles, because they don't actually seem to do much good, and
		  that's the problem. Often a single is kept under it's own weight, the fact ...
		  if it's good ... and the airplay is a big thing as well. And there's not really
		  that much you can do. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Do you regret having the record or the single out then? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, not at all. I mean if I was to make the same choice, I would. I
		  would go for that same record, you know what I mean? If I had to put the first
		  single out again I would go for that one, I'm very happy... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I remember somebody saying that the song originally had a different
		title, ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html">the
		dreaming</A></CITE>", is that right? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, no it didn't. We always have working titles for things, but that
		  doesn't mean it has a different title. It's always really been called
		  ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html">The Dreaming</A></CITE>.''

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's a long piece of wood that's hollowed out. And what they do is
		  they find the bits of wood already hollowed out, because the termites eat the
		  soft wood and literally just hollow the branch out, and they just sit and blow
		  through them. And the blowing technique is very difficult because while you're
		  breathing in through your nose, you have to breath out through your mouth. And
		  it's like a whole circularly technique so you can just keep the drone going
		  continuously. </DD>
