		<DD> Yeah, well there's one called ``<CITE>Coffee Homeground</CITE>''
		  which was in fact inspired directly from a cab driver that I met who was in
		  fact a bit nutty. And it's just a song about someone who thinks they're being
		  poisoned by another person, they think that there's Belladonna in their tea and
		  that whenever they offer them something to eat, it's got poisen in it. And it's
		  just a humorous aspect of paranoia really and we sort of done it in a Brechtian
		  style, the old sort of German [<I>??? Vibe</I>] to try and bring across the
		  humour side of it. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im78_lh.html">Lionheart

		<DD> He was a murderer who was arrested after he had escaped from Britain

		<DD> "<CITE>Coffee Homeground</CITE>'' was sort of based on a taxi driver

	 <P> <B> The sort of vignette-songs like ``<CITE>coffee homeground</CITE>''

		<DD> Well, ``<CITE>Coffee Homeground</CITE>'' would have been a song
		  where the words and the music were coming together probably at exactly the same
		  time. Actually, that's the only song which I wrote when I visited
		  <A HREF="../subjects/america.html">America</A> about seven years ago [<I>To
		  appear on <CITE>saturday night live</CITE></I>]. Which is quite interesting, as
		  it's not at all American... </DD>

		<DD> Well, actually, Andrew Powell arranged the orchestra. But the riff

		<DD> Paddy: Then translated into different instruments. As a matter of
		  fact, ``<CITE>coffee homeground</CITE>'' violently mutated. When the very first
		  demos of it were done, it had a decidedly different flavour. The brechtian
		  treatment didn't appear until much later on, that only took shape when kate got
		  the idea of treating the song with a slightly german sort of flavour. </DD>

	 <P> <B> So, with a song like that, it's kate who actually
		<CITE>conceives</CITE> what is possible, and then looks to the musicians or to

		<DD> Paddy: Oh, yes, yes. But in the case of ``<CITE>coffee
		  homeground</CITE>'' it did mutate. The brechtian feel is something that
		  appeared only gradually, during the actual <A
