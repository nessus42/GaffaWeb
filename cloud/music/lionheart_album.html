		<DD> Maybe I'm a bit too close to it at the moment, but I find it much

		<DD> I was getting a bit worried about labels from that last album;
		  everything being in the high register, everything being soft, and airy- fairy.
		  That was great for the time but it's not really what I want to do now, or what
		  I want to do, say, in the next year. I guess I want to get basically heavier in
		  the sound sense... and I think that's on the way, which makes me really happy.

		<DD> I don't really think there are any songs on the album that are as
		  close to ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/wuthering_heights.html"> Wuthering
		  Heights</A></CITE>'' as there were on the last one. I mean, there's lots of
		  songs people could draw comparisons with. I want the first single that comes
		  out from this album to be reasonably up-tempo. That's the first thing I'm
		  concerned with, because I want to break away from what has previously gone. I'm
		  not pleased with being associated with such soft, romantic vibes, not for the
		  first single anyway. If that happens again, that's what I will be to everyone.

		<DD> If you can get away with it and keep changing, great. I think it

		  trying to find out what you're doing. And, anyway, if you know what's coming
		  next, what's the point? If I really wanted to, I guess I could write a song
		  that would be so similar to ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/wuthering_heights.html">
		  Wuthering Heights</A></CITE>'' But I don't. What's the point? I'd rather write
		  a song that was really different, that I liked, although it might not get

		  were a couple of disadvantages - the fact that it was so beautiful, you
		  couldn't help but keep drifting off to the sun out there, you know, that sort

		  and the weather and everyone around was just so good, you know, you didn't feel

		<DD> It was a difficult situation because there was very little time
		  around and I felt very squashed in by the lack of time and that's what I don't
		  like, especially if it's concerning something as important for me as my songs
		  are, they're really important to me. But it all seemed to come together and it
		  was really nicely guided by something, it just happened great. And there were
		  quite a few old songs that I managed to get the time to re-write. It's a much
		  lighter level of work when you re-write a song because the basic inspiration is
		  there, you just perfect upon it and that's great. And they're about four new
		  songs so they all came together, it was great. In fact, we ended up with more
		  then we needed again, which is fantastic. (1978, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Your <A HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A> has changed

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Even on the first two records, I was doing what I'm doing now as a
		  artist, only because I was a lot younger, and I didn't have the room and the
		  space to be able to truly present my music. I had to work with a producer and
		  within certain kind of set-ups because of the fact that... that's how it was, I
		  wasn't powerful enough basically to be able to say, ``Look, I'm
		  <A HREF="../subjects/producing.html"> producing</A> this myself. This is what I
		  do.'' And that's what I do now. I think that if I had been a little older, and
		  if I'd had the experience at the time, I would have done it then, too. But I
		  was - When I was making my first album, I was 18. I had never really worked
		  with a band before, let alone a producer in a studio setup. So I just had -
		  [<I>Laughs</I>] - I mean I just about had the guts, you know, to sing and keep
		  it together. But you learn very quickly what you want. By the time the second
		  album was finished, I knew that I had to be involved. Even though they were my
		  songs and I was singing them, the finished product was not what I wanted. That
		  wasn't the producer's fault. He was doing a good job from his point of view,
		  making it sound good and together. But for me, it was not my album, really.

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think there's a lot of reasons for that. Um, a lot of it's
		  to do with the fact that I didn't really feel that I had creative control over
		  what I was doing for those first two albums. Although I'd written the songs, I
		  wasn't really taking overall control and saying what should happen. I feel very
		  much that the production of the songs has as much to do with the feeling as the
		  words and the music. And by the third album I was starting to take that kind of
		  control. I went into co-production, and actually felt that I was working in a
		  studio as someone that was in control of what they were doing. </DD>
