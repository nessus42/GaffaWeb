		<DD> Well that was based around the story <CITE>Wuthering Heights</CITE>,
		  which was written by Emily Bronte. And ah, and really what sparked that off was
		  a TV thing I saw as a young child. [<I>Apparently the timothy dalton telefilm
		  of about 1972</I>] I just walked into the room and caught the end of this
		  program. And I am sure one of the reasons it stuck so heavily in my mind was
		  because of the spirit of Cathy, and as a child I was called Cathy. It later
		  changed to Kate. It was just a matter of exaggerating all my bad areas, because
		  she's a really vile person, she's just so headstrong and passionate and...
		  crazy, you know? And it was fun to do, and it took - a night and a half? (1980,

		<DD> It's from the novel called <CITE>Wuthering Heights</CITE> - you
		  probably might know it better as the <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>.
		  It's about the end of the film where Cathy has actually died and she's coming
		  back as a spirit across the moors to come and get Heathcliff again. And it just
		  struck me very strongly because it shows a lot about human beings and how if
		  they can't get what they want, they will go to such extremes in order to do it.
		  This is exactly what she did. She wouldn't even be alone when she was dead. She
		  had to come back and get him. I just found it really amazing. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DD> When I first read <CITE>Wuthering Heights</CITE> I thought the story

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, I wrote in my flat, sitting at the upright piano one night in
		  March at about midnight. There was a full moon and the curtains were open, and
		  every time I looked up for ideas, I looked at the moon. Actually, it came quite
		  easily. I couldn't seem to get out of the chorus - it had a really circular
		  feel to it, which is why it repeats. I had originally written something more
		  complicated, but I couldn't link it up, so I kept the first bit and repeated
		  it. I was really pleased, because it was the first song I had written for a
		  while, as I'd been busy rehearsing with the KT Band. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I felt a particular want to write it, and had wanted to write it for
		  quite a while. I remember my brother John talking about the story, but I
		  couldn't relate to it enough. So I borrowed the book and read a few pages,
		  picking out a few lines. So I actually wrote the song before I had read the
		  book right through. The name Cathy helped, and made it easier to project my own
		  feelings of want for someone so much that you hate them. I could understand how
		  Cathy felt. </DD>

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's funny, but I heard a <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">
		  radio</A> programme about a woman who was writing a book in Old English, and
		  she found she was using words she didn't know, but when she looked them up she
		  found they were correct. A similar thing happened with ``<CITE>Wuthering
		  Heights</CITE>": I put lines in the song that I found in the book when I read
		  it later. </DD>

		<DD> I've never been to Wuthering Heights, the place, though I would like
		  to, and someone sent me a photo of where it's supposed to be. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> One thing that really pleases me is the amount of positive feedback
		  I've had from the song, though I've heard that the Bronte Society think it's a
		  disgrace. A lot of people have read the book because of the song and liked it,
		  which I think is the best thing about it for me. I didn't know the book would
		  be on the GCE syllabus in the year I had the hit, but lots of people have
		  written to say how the song helped them. I'm really happy about that. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> There are a couple of synchronicities involved with the song. When
		  Emily Bronte wrote the book she was in the terminal stages of consumption, and
		  I had a bad cold when I wrote the song. Also, when I was in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/canada.html">Canada</A> I found out that Lindsay Kemp, my
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html"> dance</A> teacher, was in town, only ten
		  minutes away by car, so I went to see him. When I came back I had this urge to
		  switch on the TV - it was about one in the morning - because I
		  <CITE>knew</CITE> the <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> of
		  <CITE>Wuthering Heights</CITE> would be on. I tuned in to a thirties gangster
		  film, then flicked through the channels, playing channel roulette, until I
		  found it. I came in at the moment Cathy was dying, so that's all I saw of the
		  film. It was an amazing coincidence. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, the video we made for ``<CITE>Wuthering Heights</CITE>'' was
		  probably amongst the first ever made, certainly here in this country in terms
		  of a video, and I was very influenced at that time still by Lindsay Kemp. So it
		  was very much the <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html"> dance</A> influence that I
		  was expressing. So it was really working out choreography that would just look
		  interesting, that would kind of create a persona of Cathy. </DD>

		<DD> Well, I'm not actually a big Emily Bronte fan. A lot of people think
		  I am, they presume I am. It just goes with this whole preconception they have
		  of me as a sort of big Bronte fan, a Tolkien fan, the pre-Raphaelite lady.
		  Which I think is actually a very big misconception. For me, ``<CITE>Wuthering
		  Heights</CITE>'' is the ultimate <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>
		  story. You just cannot get beyond the passion that they cover there. You know,
		  its a love affair that goes beyond <A HREF="../subjects/death.html"> death</A>
		  - they will not be stopped by <A HREF="../subjects/nature.html"> nature</A>'s
		  boundaries. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Lots of people want to know this, and there's been a lot of dispute
		  about whether it is the same date as Emily Bronte, who wrote <CITE>Wuthering
		  Heights.</CITE> I was born in a nursing home in Erith, Kent, while my parents
		  were living where they are now, in Welling. The date was July 30th, 1958.
