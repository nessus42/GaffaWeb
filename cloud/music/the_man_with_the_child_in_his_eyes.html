		<DD> The inspiration for ``<CITE>The Man With the Child in His
		  Eyes</CITE>'' was really just a particular thing that happened when I went to
		  the piano. The piano just started speaking to me. It was a theory that I had
		  had for a while that I just observed in most of the men that I know: the fact
		  that they just are little boys inside and how wonderful it is that they manage
		  to retain this magic. </DD>

		<DD> I, myself, am attracted to older men, I guess, but I think that's
		  the same with every female. I think it's a very natural, basic instinct that
		  you look continually for your father for the rest of your life, as do men
		  continually look for their mother in the women that they meet. I don't think
		  we're all aware of it, but I think it is basically true. You look for that
		  security that the opposite sex in your parenthood gave you as a child. (1978,

		<DD> Oh, well it's something that I feel about men generally. [<I>Looks

		  a lot of men have got a child inside them, you know I think they are more or
		  less just grown up kids. And that it's a ...[<I>Cameramen laugh</I>] no, no,
		  it's a very good quality, it's really good, because a lot of women go out and
		  get far too responsible. And it's really nice to keep that delight in wonderful
		  things that <A HREF="../subjects/children.html"> children</A> have. And that's
		  what I was trying to say. That this man could communicate with a younger girl,
		  because he's on the same level. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> This was about an adult who is still very much of a child and could
		  still take a delight in the innocence of things. In some men I think it's a
		  positive thing to sometimes not let go of that. I liked the idea of the
		  innocence of a person shining in their eyes. How wonderful it is that they
		  manage to retain this magic. (???, AVD) </DD>

		<DD> Well ``<CITE>The Man With the Child in His Eyes</CITE>'' just

		  dictated it, it was a very intimate song about a young girl almost voicing her
		  inner thoughts, not really to anyone, but rather to herself. And it just
		  started off where I sat down on the floor, crosslegged, and getting ready to
		  work out some ideas to the routine with the music on. And my brother Jay came
		  in and saw me sitting there and said, ``why don't you just keep it like that?''

	 <P> <B> Why did you leave the echoing ``he's here!'' - on the single of

		<DD> It was the other way round with ``<CITE>The Man With the Child in

	 <P> <B> Your lyrics have always fascinated me, but none more so than those
		of ``<CITE>the man with the child in his eyes"</CITE>. I have often wondered
		whether you found inspiration for this from emily bronte's poetry. It is her
		constant references to eternity which make me wonder: For example, ``the sea of
		<A HREF="../subjects/death.html"> death</A>'s eternity'' parallelled with your
		``telling me about the sea/all his <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>,
		till eternity." </B></P>
