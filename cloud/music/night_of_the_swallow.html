		of the songs on <CITE><A HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html"> the
		dreaming</A></CITE> seem to draw heavily from <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">
		film</A> noir. ``<CITE>night of the swallow</CITE>", the female is straight out
		of the awesome barbara stanwyck mould of <CITE>double indemnity</CITE>. She's a
		domineering, passionate woman who not only doesn't want her lover to risk his
		life trafficking refuges because of the danger to him, but because <CITE>she
		wants him.</CITE> at the end he pleads - ``would you break even my wings/just
		like a swallow/let me, let me go..." </B></P>
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, unfortunately a lot of men do begin to feel very trapped in
		  their relationships and I think, in some situations, it is because the female
		  is so scared, perhaps of her insecurity, that she needs to hang onto him
		  completely. In this song she wants to control him and because he wants to do
		  something that she doesn't want him to she feels that he is going away. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's almost on a parallel with the mother and son relationship where
		  there is the same female feeling of not wanting the young child to move away
		  from the nest. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Of course, from the guys point of view, because she doesn't want him
		  to go, the urge to go is even stronger. For him, it's not so much a job as a
		  challenge; a chance to do something risky and exciting. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But although that woman's very much a stereotype I think she still
		  exists today. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Often your female characters do seem larger then life - even you on
		stage appear larger, more dominant. Is that simply for dramatic effect?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There is certainly that element in my performance. From a writing
		  point of view I think you are talking about something that is very real-based
		  but someone to make it more interesting you have to exaggerate it a little bit.

		<DD> It's like people who tell stories, really the people who tell good
		  stories are the ones who kept the truth in essence but they exaggerate on all
		  the little areas. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i82_mm.html">Melody

		<DD> Ever since I heard my first Irish pipe music it has been under my

		<DD> I've wanted to work with Irish music for years, but my writing has
		  never really given me the opportunity of doing so until now. As soon as the
		  song was written, I felt that a <CITE>ceilidh</CITE> band would be perfect for
		  the choruses. The verses are about a lady who's trying to keep her man from
		  accepting what seems to be an illegal job. He is a pilot and has been hired to
		  fly some people into another country. No questions are to be asked, and she
		  gets a bad feeling from the situation. But for him, the challenge is almost
		  more exciting than the job itself, and he wants to fly away. </DD>

		<DD> As the fiddles, pipes and whistles start up in the choruses, he is

		<DD> We sent him a cassette, and a few days later he phoned the studio

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I thought how wonderful he was, and I heard him put down the phone
		  and walk away. The cassette player started up. As the chorus began, so did this
		  beautiful music - through the wonder of telephones it was coming live from
		  <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html"> Ireland</A>, and it was very moving. </DD>

		<DD> We arranged that I would travel to
		  <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html"> Ireland</A> with Jay and the multi-track
		  tape, and that we would record in Windmill Lane Studios, Dublin. As the
		  choruses began to grow, the evening drew on and the glasses of Guiness, slowly
		  dropping in level, became like sand glasses to tell the passing of time. We
		  missed our plane and worked through the night. </DD>

		<DD> By eight o'clock the next morning we were driving to the airport to

		  we were stepping onto the plane, I looked up into the sky and there were three
		  swallows diving and chasing the flies. (1982, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> So tell me, how did it come about that you came to bring in

		<DD> My brother Jay was a big fan of theirs and played their records all
		  the time. And when I heard them I though they were fantastic! Then one day I
		  was writing the song ``<CITE>Night of the Swallow</CITE>'' on the last album
		  and I thought: what would go really well on the chorus is a ceilidh band. So I
		  thought: ``Planxty!" </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Who came up with that beautiful melody-line on the uillean pipes?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Bill Whelan, who is a producer and also the keyboard player of
		  Planxty. It was fantastic, 'cause I sent him a cassette of a rough mix, and
		  then he rang up and said, ``Listen, do you want to hear the arrangement?'' He
		  was at home in <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html"> Ireland</A> and I was in the
		  studio here in London. And I said, ``Yeah, I'd <A
		  HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> to.'' So he said, ``Well, hang on a
		  minute,'' and he put down the phone, and then I could hear these pipes and this
		  whistle. They had my cassette going on a machine and they were playing live
		  with it over the phone, and it was beautiful! And then I heard these little
		  steps up to the phone and he said, ``Well, what do you think?'' I said
		  ``<CITE>Great!</CITE>'' It was wonderful... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Oh wow, what a pity you didn't tape it all! </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh I know! If I'd known beforehand, then I'd have had everything
		  going. It was really beautiful, a fantastic moment. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Was that a demo you sent them, or a backing track? Did they
		eventually overdub their part, or do it live with your band? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, for the actual session with Planxty, we took a 24-track tape
		  over to <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html">Ireland</A> with the complete track
		  mixed down rough on two of the tracks, also with a time-code on one track so we
		  could synch it up again with the original tape when doing a final mix back in
		  London. So the rest of the tracks were all free for Bill's arrangement and any
		  other ideas we might get. Planxty were very different to work with as
		  musicians, it was all so much fun. </DD>

	 <P> <B> "<CITE>Night of the swallow</CITE>'' flits from calm to a torrent
		of pipes and fiddles courtesy of irish band planxty. When kate sent a cassette
		of the song to arranger bill whelan in <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html">
		ireland</A> he was back on the blower in no time with an arrangement, which he
		played there and then through the cables. Kate then went over to ireland for

		<DD> They were incredible: the energy and attitude towards

		<DD> The whole idea of the song was that the choruses were this guy
		  <A HREF="../subjects/flying.html">flying</A> off. He's a pilot who's been
		  offered a load of <A HREF="../subjects/money.html"> money</A> if he doesn't ask
		  any questions. He really wants to do it, for the challenge as well, but his
		  wife is really against it because she feels he's going to get caught. The
		  verses are her saying ``Don't do it!'' and the choruses are him saying ``Look,
		  I <CITE>can</CITE> do it, I can fly like a swallow'' We used the idea of the
		  ceilidh band <CITE>taking off.</CITE> (1982, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, very much so, because my mother is Irish and when I was very

	 <P> <B> So you were brought up on the bodran and the fiddles and the pipes

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So what have you done with this particular track? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, when I wrote the song I felt straight away that the choruses
		  where just waiting for something like a Ceilidh band and it was just a matter
		  of getting in touch with the people from Planxty and seeing if there were
		  willing to do it. And I managed to contact a man called Bill Whelan, who's the
		  keyboard player in Planxty, and he arranged the whole passage in the choruses.
		  And it's really beautiful, I think it's changed the song a great deal, and
		  definitely for the better. [<I>Laughs</I>] (1982, <CITE><A
