		<DD> Well I think ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/the_sensual_world_album.html"> The Sensual World</A></CITE>'' is
		  talking specifically about the context of that within the song. The song is
		  about someone from a book who steps out from this very black and white 2-D
		  world into the real world. The immediate impressions was the sensuality of this
		  world - the fact that you can touch things, that is so sensual - you know...
		  the colours of trees, the feel of the grass on the feet, the touch of this in
		  the hand - the fact that it is such a sensual world. I think for me that's an
		  incredibly important thing about this planet, that we are surrounded by such
		  sensuality and yet we tend not to see it like that. But I'm sure for someone
		  who had never experienced it before it would be quite a devastating thing.

		<DD> I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> the sound of church
		  bells. I think they are extraordinary - such a sound of celebration. The bells
		  were put there because originally the lyrics of the song were taken from the
		  book <CITE>Ulysses</CITE> by James Joyce, the words at the end of the book by
		  Molly Bloom, but we couldn't get permission to use the words. I tried for a
		  long time - probably about a year - and they wouldn't let me use them, so I had
		  to create something that sounded like those original word, had the same rhythm,
		  the same kind of feel but obviously not being able to use them. It all kind of
		  turned in to a pastiche of it and that's why the book character, Molly Bloom,
		  then steps out into the real world and becomes one of us. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I've got a thing about the sound of bells. It's one of those

		  this image of them sitting on the hillside with the sound of bells in the
		  distance. In hindsight, I also think it's a lovely way to start an album: a
		  feeling of celebration that puts me on a hillside somewhere on a sunny
		  afternoon and it's like, mmh... Sounds of celebration get fewer and fewer. We
		  haven't many left. And yet people complain of the sound of bells in cities.

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I suppose there's a few. There's a few songs that have been
		  difficult to write. I think the most frustrating and difficult to write was the
		  song, ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/the_sensual_world_album.html"> The Sensual
		  World</A></CITE>.'' Uh, you've probably heard some of the story, that
		  originally it was written to the lyrics at the end of <CITE>Ulysses</CITE>, and
		  uh, I just couldn't believe how the whole thing came together, it was so... It
		  was just like it was meant to be. We had this sort of instrumental piece, and
		  uh, I had this idea for like a rhythmic melody, and I just thought of the book,
		  and went and got it, and the words fitted - they just <CITE>fitted</CITE>, the
		  whole thing fitted, it was ridiculous. You know the song was saying, ``Yes!
		  Yes!" [<I>Laughter from audience</I>] </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And when I asked for permission, you know, they said, ``No! No!"
		  [<I>Lots of laughter from audience</I>] </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That was one of the hardest things for me to swallow. I can't tell
		  you how annoyed I was that, um, I wasn't allowed to have access to this great
		  piece of work that I thought was public. And in fact I really didn't think you
		  had to get permission but that you would just pay a royalty. So I was really,
		  really frustrated about it. And, um... kind of rewrote the words, trying to
		  keep the same - same rhythm and sounds. And, um, eventually, through rewriting
		  the words we also changed the piece of music that now happens in the choruses,
		  so if they hadn't obstructed the song, it would have been a very different
		  song. So, to look at it positively, although it was very difficult, in the end,
		  I think it was, it was probably worth all the trouble. Thank you very much.

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> In the original piece, it's just ``Yes'' - a very interesting way of
		  leading you in. It pulls you into the piece by the continual acceptance of all
		  these sensual things: ``Ooh wonderful!'' I was thinking I'd never write
		  anything as obviously sensual as the original piece, but when I had to rewrite
		  the words, I was trapped. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> How could you recreate that mood without going into that level of
		  sensuality? So there I was writing stuff that months before I'd said I'd never
		  write, SHE LAUGHS. I have to think of it in terms of pastiche, and not that
		  it's me so much. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> The original piece, right, was just the most beautiful piece of
		  writing I've ever read. It's like this never-ending sentence, this long train
		  of thought, and the only thing that punctuates it is the word ``yes'' and it
		  very gradually accelerates. I just thought it was just one of the most sensual
		  pieces ever written. When I came to write this album, I suddenly remembered
		  this writing, and the original lyrics were from the book. I just picked it up
		  and all the words fitted perfectly to the music. I couldn't believe that the
		  two things would just come together. </DD>

		<DD> But when I applied for permission to use the words I was refused, so
		  I was *extremely* disappointed. Then I had to rewrite the words trying to keep
		  the same sense of sound, but obviously I'm not James Joyce, so it was a
		  question of keeping the same shape and creating a new story. So it gradually
		  turned into Molly Bloom stepping out of her speech in the book and into the
		  real world. In the book she's a very sensual woman, and it was the idea of her
		  stepping out of this black-and-white world into the real world and being hit by
		  the power of the sensuality of the world, the environment, the elements. (1989,

		<DD> I had a rhythm idea with a synth line I took home to work on one
		  night. While I was playing it this repeated *Yes* came to me and made me think
		  of Molly Bloom's speech right at the end of Ulysses - which I *have* actually
		  read all through! I went downstairs and read it again, this unending sentence
		  punctuated with 'yeses', fantastic stuff, and it was uncanny, it fitted the
		  rhythm of my song. (Q, 1989) </DD>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Now that was a really complicated process for a track to come
		  together. It started off with a song - no words. I'd had this idea for about
		  two years to use the words from Molly Blooms' speech at the end of Ulysses,
		  which I think is the most superb piece of writing ever, to a piece of music. So
		  Del had done a Fairlight pattern, and I'd done a DX riff over the top of it,
		  and I was listening to it at home, and the words fitted absolutely perfectly. I
		  thought God this is just ridiculous, just how well it's come together. (1989,

		<DD> That song was a hard haul. Originally I'd used Joyce's actual words

		<DD> I rewrote the lyrics to give them this lovely sensual rhythm. It was

		  bring this sensual woman into a place where she could actually touch things. In
		  the long run the obstacles I ran into made me turn it into a better song.

		  the fact that this 2D character could actually go around touching. So that's
		  what it turned into. The fact that they didn't let me use the lyrics turned the
		  song into something very different. It was such a complicated process, and

	 <P> <B> "<CITE><A HREF="../music/the_sensual_world_album.html">The sensual
		world</A></CITE>'' is about molly bloom, the fountain of lust and life in james
		joyce's dauntingly super-realist novel, <CITE>ulysses.</CITE> it's a book
		that's defeated my attempts to read it again and again, and I confess to kate
		that it gives me a hell of a lot of trouble. </B></P>

		<DD> Well, I just thought it was such an extraordinary piece of writing.
		  It's so...ooh!...It's such a beautiful style. It's like trains of thought
		  continually tumbling...You know, tumbling speech, and not kind of..."stopped.''
		  I first heard her speak being read years ago by...I'm pretty sure it was
		  Siobhan McKenna. [<I>There is in fact a recording of mckenna's reading of this
		  soliloquy, so kate is almost certainly remembering correctly. - ied</I>] And it
		  had such a femininity about it. That was my first exposure to it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And it just came together with this song. We'd written this piece of
		  music in the studio, and I thought, ``What about putting the Molly Bloom speech
		  together with this?'' So I went and grabbed the book, and it worked perfectly.
		  It just scanned - the whole song. But, unfortunately, when I applied for
		  permission to use the words, they wouldn't let me. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Obviously, I was very disappointed. It was completely their
		  prerogative, you know, they don't have to give their permission. But it was
		  very difficult for me, then, to reapproach the song. In some ways I wanted to
		  just leave it off the album. But we'd put a lot of work into it - the Irish
		  musicians had worked hard - so it was a matter of trying to rewrite the lyrics
		  so it kept the same rhtymic sense, because the words are <CITE>so</CITE>
		  rhythmic; and to keep the sense of sensuality as well, without using the Joyce
		  lyrics. So it all kind of turned into this piece where Molly Bloom steps out of
		  the book into real life, where she can actually reach out and touch things in
		  the real world. In a lot of ways, because of their lack of co-operation, it
		  transformed the track into something else. </DD>

		<DD> It's difficult to put into words, but I think, on the last album,
		  <CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">Hounds of Love,</A></CITE>
		  particularly in the production, I wanted to try and get across a sense of
		  power, and the way I related to that was very much what I consider very good
		  male music - the kind of power I found there was not what I found in a lot of
		  females' music. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's not that I was trying to write like a man or anything - but
		  there was this level of approaching the album, soundwise, that I think had a
		  male energy. But I didn't want to do that on this album. I wanted to do it as a
		  woman, not as a woman working around a man's world. This all sounds awful!

		<DD> I had been fascinated at how well the words fit to music. I found
		  myself in a situation where I would either have to shelf the song or rework it
		  trying to keep the original sense. I gradually rewrote it, keeping the same
		  rhythm of the words and the same sounds but turning it into its own story,
		  which became the idea of Molly Bloom stepping out of the song into the beauty
		  of <A HREF="../subjects/nature.html"> nature</A>. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, originally the words were taken from Molly Bloom's speech. I
		  tried to get permission, but it was refused. Obviously there wasn't anything I
		  could do about it except either forget the song or rewrite it. So, as such a
		  lot of effort had gone into the musical side of it, and we were quite pleased
		  with it, I really just re-approached the words, keeping the same rhythm and
		  texture. But it turned itself into a story about Molly Bloom's stepping out of
		  the book into the sensual world... In some ways, the lack of co-operation made
		  us work harder to turn the song into something else. So that's quite nice.

		<DD> What was interesting was the fact that through their lack of
		  cooperation, that they wouldn't let me use the lyric, the original piece, the
		  song actually became something else. So I think in many ways them not helping
		  us out turned the song into what it is. The song grew and changed into
		  something more interesting. Certainly not lyrically, but as a piece of music.

		<CITE>rosina de peira,</CITE> harmony-singing from the bahamas, and some

		and in the time in between please accept my thanks and a kiss from my sister.
		[<I>The person in question is jan libbenga, a music journalist who provided a
		tape of a version of the macedonian melody which kate subsequently arranged for
		irish instruments and recorded on this song. Unfortunately for mr. Libbenga, he
		did not wait to read the above graceful acknowledgement by paddy and kate, but
