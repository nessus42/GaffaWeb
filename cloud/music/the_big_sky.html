		<DD> The next song is called ``<CITE>The Big Sky.</CITE>'' Someone
		  sitting looking at the sky, watching the clouds change. I used to do this a lot
		  as a child, just watching the clouds go into different shapes. I think we
		  forget these pleasures as adults. We don't get as much time to enjoy those
		  kinds of things, or think about them; we feel silly about what we used to do
		  naturally. The song is also suggesting the coming of the next flood - how
		  perhaps the ``fools on the hills'' will be the wise ones. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> "<CITE>Big Sky</CITE>'' was a song that changed a lot between the
		  first version of it on the demo and the end product on the master tapes. As I
		  mentioned in the earlier magazine, the demos are the masters, in that we now
		  work straight in the 24-track studio when I'm writing the songs; but the
		  structure of this song changed quite a lot. I wanted to steam along, and with
		  the help of musicians such as Alan Murphy on guitar and Youth on
		  <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html"> bass</A>, we accomplished quite a
		  rock-and-roll feel for the track. Although this song did undergo two different
		  drafts and the aforementioned players changed their arrangements dramatically,
		  this is unusual in the case of most of the songs. (1985, <CITE><A

		  versions and eventually it just kind of turned into what it did, thank
		  goodness. (1991, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir85_r1.html">Classic

		  really about... you know the thing of when - I used to do it a lot when I was a
		  kid, we'd go out somewhere and sit up and look at the sky. And if you watch the
		  clouds long enough, they take on different shapes, you can see dinosaurs in
		  them, or castles. And at the time I was writing this album, we were living in
		  the country and my keyboards and stuff were in this room overlooking a valley
		  and I'd sit and watch the clouds rolling up the hill towards me. And there is a
		  lot of weather on this album. The countryside was a big inspiration at this
		  time, and it's always changing, it's a very different perspective from living
		  in the city, sometimes you hardly see the sky above the buildings at all.

	 <P> <B> Here again with the new album there are some songs that are fairly

		<DD> Yes. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes! ``<CITE>The Big Sky</CITE>'' gave me terrible trouble, really,
		  just as a song. I mean, you definitely do have relationships with some songs,
		  and we had a lot of trouble getting on together and it was just one of those
		  songs that kept changing - at one point every week - and, um...It was just a
		  matter of trying to pin it down. Because it's not often that I've written a
		  song like that: when you come up with something that can literally take you to
		  so many different tangents, so many different forms of the same song, that you
		  just end up not knowing where you are with it. And, um...I just had to pin it
		  down eventually, and that was a very strange beast. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> A strange beast...and you were happy with the final outcome?

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, and it was very different from the original song that was

	 <P> <B> In what way? </B></P>

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> A complete change of song? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, and that's very rare as well, but it was just one of those
		  songs. Maybe it's all to do with what the song is about, the fact that it's
		  changing all the time - the sky, always...changing! (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Del: It was like that, too, with ``<CITE>the big sky</CITE>'' on
		the new album. That song changed about three times. Originally it was radically
		different from the way it's found on the album, the melody-line, the
		interpretation, everything. But kate scrapped it and then rewrote it, retaining
		only a few elements of the original song. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Did you get in the guy youth on that track because he's highly
		thought of as a rock roll bassist? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, absolutely, the energy was right for the track, he used to
		  play with Killing Joke. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Del: Also he'd played on the original version and we thought it'd
		be good, karmically, to have him play on the later one too. And he plays that
		particular style that's just perfect for that kind of track. That was very much
		a case of getting the right person for the right thing on the right track.

		<DD> I think...[<I>Long pause</I>]... ``<CITE>The Big Sky.</CITE>''
		  That's the only one from a songwriting point of view actually caused the

		<DD> It [<I>Making a video</I>] is very like making early albums: I feel
		  a bit disappointed with the results, not having enough rehearsal, a big enough
		  budget, etc., etc., but the shoots were so much fun. It's such a good feeling
		  to work with a big group of people. I seem to like working with such a crowds.
		  On both ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">Hounds of
		  Love</A></CITE>'' and ``<CITE>The Big Sky</CITE>'' shoots there was a relaxed
		  air - both shoots involved crowd scenes, and was especially satisfying. Besides
		  a large number of performers to fill a stage and give the effect of a live
		  concert, we needed an avenue of people, from the Wright brothers to two
		  astronauts, to simulate aviation history. The Wright brothers looked remarkably
		  like Dave Cross and Peter FitzGerald-Morris, and one of the astronauts looked
		  so like Jay...We also needed a large, enthusiastic crowd, so we asked Dave
		  Cross to organise some members of the Club, and two hundred beautifully behaved
		  people arrived on the day of the shoot. It was very moving, they filled us all
		  up with energy - It made it feel like a real concert. </DD>

		<DD> All the <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> crew remarked on
		  how incredible everyone was. They had been terrified with past experiences of
		  invited audiences, but I told them they hadn't met the right ones. Everyone
		  left just as beautifully - nearly everyone with a burnt thumb from being a star
		  in the sky holding up lighters and waving. I'd never been in the same room with
		  so many stars before. </DD>

		<DD> No, I worked with John Mister as <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">
		  film</A> editor. On both those shoots we worked to very detailed storyboards,
		  and in both cases could give John a photostat of the script beforehand so he'd
		  know the gist of what we were working on. Then he'd do a rough cut by himself,
		  following the storyboard. Then we'd work together until we were happy. He was
		  great to work with, and both edits were very quick: just taking them into the
		  video suite for bits and pieces. But it would have to be transferred to video
		  for T.V. showings, anyway, so all ads [<I>Sic - does she mean 'adds' here, as
		  in 'additions'?</I>], etc., end up on video. </DD>

		<DD> "<CITE>The Big Sky</CITE>'' was a little more complicated. The
		  beginning part on the rooftops involves chromakey, where all the live action
		  goes on in front of a blue screen and then the various weather effects were put
		  in at the edit. The pieces of <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> with
		  the weather were chosen beforehand and transferred to video; they then replaced
		  the blue screen. (1986, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate22.html">KBC
