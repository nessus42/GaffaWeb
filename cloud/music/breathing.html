		<DD> No. I've thought a lot about the political aspect - this is when

		<DD> So many of them knew, you know. They hear a lot more than the media

		  frightens them, but it really upsets a lot of them. That's good - it's not nice

		<DD> When I wrote the song, it was from such a personal viewpoint. It was
		  just through having heard a thing for years without it ever having got through
		  to me. 'Til the moment it hit me, I hadn't really been moved. Then I suddenly
		  realised the whole devastation and disgusting arrogance of it all. Trying to
		  destroy something that we've not created - the earth. The only thing we are is
		  a breathing mechanism: everything is breathing. Without it we're just nothing.
		  All we've got is our lives, and I was worried that when people heard it they
		  were going to think, ``She's exploiting commercially this terribly real
		  thing.'' I was very worried that people weren't going to take me from my
		  emotional standpoint rather than the commercial one. But they did, which is
		  great. I was worried that people wouldn't want to worry about it because it's
		  so real. I was also worried that it was too negative, but I do feel that there
		  is hope in the whole thing, just for the fact that it's a message from the
		  future. It's not from now, it's from a spirit that may exist in the future, a
		  non-existent spiritual embryo who sees all and who's been round time and time
		  again so they know what the world's all about. This time they don't want to
		  come out, because they know they're not going to live. It's almost like the
		  mother's stomach is a big window that's like a cinema screen, and they're
		  seeing all this terrible chaos. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> It's great to hear you say that. From my own viewpoint that's the
		  best thing I've ever written. It's the best thing I've ever produced. I call
		  that my little symphony, because I think every writer, whether they admit it or
		  not, loves the idea of writing their own symphony. The song says something real
		  for me, whereas many of the others haven't quite got to the level that I would
		  like them to reach, though they're trying to. Often it's because the song won't
		  allow it, and that song allowed everything that I wanted to be done to it. That
		  track was easy to build up. Although it had to be huge, it was just speaking -
		  saying what had to be put on it. In many ways, I think the most exciting thing
		  was making the backing track. The session men had their lines, they understood
		  what the song was about, but at first there was no emotion, and that track was
		  demanding so much emotion. It wasn't until they actually played with feeling
		  that the whole thing took off. When we went and listened, I wanted to cry,
		  because of what they had put into it. It was so tender. It meant a lot to me
		  that they had put in as much as they could, because it must get hard for
		  session guys. They get paid by the hour, and so many people don't want to hear
		  the emotion. They want clear, perfect tuning, a 'good sound'; but often the
		  out-of-tuneness, the uncleanliness, doesn't matter as much as the emotional
		  content that's in there. I think that's much more important than the
		  technicalities. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> I wanted to write a song, and I came up with some chords which
		  sounded to me very dramatic. Then up popped the line, ``Outside
		  get[<I>S???</I>] inside,'' as I was trying to piece the song together, and I
		  thought it would be good to write a song about a baby inside the womb. Then I
		  came to a chorus piece, and decided that the obvious word to go there was
		  ``breathing", and I thought automatically that it had been done before. But
		  asking around, I couldn't understand why it hadn't, because it's such a good
		  word. Then ``breathing'' and the baby turned into the concept of life, and the
		  last form of life that would be around - that would be a baby that was about to
		  be born after the blast. It was a very personal song. I thought at the time
		  that it was self-indulgent, and it was something I just did for myself, really.
		  For me it's a statement that I hope won't happen. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> It got to the point when I heard it [<I>Pink floyd's <CITE>the

		<DD> And I think the one that was the most difficult, but the one I was
		  most pleased with was ``<CITE>Breathing</CITE>'' - that was an epic. We spent
		  three days trying to get that backing track. And the silly thing was that we
		  had all the riffs and everything by the second day, it was just that no-one

		<DD> Well, actually, I think it did incredibly well, it got to number
		  sixteen in the singles charts in this country. And it was without any promotion
		  and everyone thought, gosh, it's far too uncommercial. But I think sixteen is
		  pretty good. And also what is nice is that, although in a way it didn't really
		  get that much attention at the time, it's one of those tracks that people are
		  still talking about now, even though they may have ignored it when it first
		  came out. </DD>

		<DD> Yeah, Greenpeace approached us asking us would we like to put a

		  that I was incredibly struck at what we were doing to each other. And that just
		  one button, one bomb, could do one hello of a lot to any of us. And I thought
