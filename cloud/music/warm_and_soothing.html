		``<CITE><A HREF="../music/under_the_ivy.html"> under the ivy</A></CITE>,'' on
		which you simply accompany yourself on the piano with no other arrangement,
		were those tracks recorded originally just as demos? </B></P>

		<DD> No, they weren't, but in a way they are just demos. ``<CITE>Warm and
		  Soothing</CITE>'' was a demo-tape which we did basically just to see what Abbey
		  Road sounded like. We wanted to work there, and we went into Studio Two, and
		  really the only way we could tell if it was going to sound good was if I went
		  and did a piano vocal. So I did, and it sounded great. ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/under_the_ivy.html"> Under the Ivy</A></CITE>'' we did in our
		  studio in just an afternoon. (1985, <CITE><A
