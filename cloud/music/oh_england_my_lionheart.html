		<DD> Well, again it's similar to the last album, in as much as it's the
		  title after the title track. And the title track on this album is called
		  ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/lionheart_album.html">Oh England, My
		  Lionheart</A></CITE>.'' And it's really very much a song about the Old England
		  that we all think about whenever we're away, you know, ``ah, the wonderful
		  England'' and how beautiful it is amongst all the rubbish, you know. Like the
		  old buildings we've got, the Old English attitudes that are always around. And
		  this sort of very heavy emphasis on nostalgia that is very strong in England.
		  People really do it alot, you know, like ``I remember the war and...'' You know
		  it's very much a part of our attitudes to life that we live in the past. And
		  it's really just a sort of poetical play on the, if you like, the romantic
		  visuals of England, and the second World War... Amazing revolution that
		  happened when it was over and peaceful everything seemed, like the green
		  fields. And it's really just a exploration of that. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DD> A lot of people could easily say that the song is sloppy. It's very
		  classically done. It's only got acoustic instruments on it and it's done ...
		  almost madrigally, you know. I dare say a lot of people will think that it's
		  just a load of old slush but it's just an area that I think it's good to cover.
		  Everything I do is very English and I think that's one reason I've broken
		  through to a lot of countries. The English vibe is very appealing. (1978,

	 <P> <B> Is there a very conscious root in english culture in your writing?
		For example, the tennyson quote you used to introduce <CITE>the ninth
		wave</CITE>. And then there was ``<CITE><A
		HREF="../music/lionheart_album.html"> oh! england, my lionheart</A></CITE>'' on
		the second album. </B></P>
