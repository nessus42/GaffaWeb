		<DD> We sat in front of the speakers trying to focus on the picture - a
		  green forest, humid and pulsating with life. We are looking at the Americans
		  from the Vietnamese point of view and, almost like a camera, we start in wide
		  shot. Right in the distance you can see the trees moving, smoke and sounds
		  drifting our way...sounds like a <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html"> radio</A>.
		  Closer in with the camera, and you can catch glimpses of their pink skin. We
		  can smell them for miles with their sickly cologne, American tobacco and stale
		  sweat. </DD>

		<DD> Take the camera in even closer, and we find a solitary soldier,
		  perhaps the one I have singled out. Sometimes a Vietnamese would track a
		  soldier for days and follow him, until he eventually took him. This soldier is
		  under a tree, dozing with a faint smile and a <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">
		  radio</A> by his side. It's a small transistor radio out of which cries an
		  electric guitar. I'd swear it was being played by Brian Bath, but how could
		  that be, way out here on our stereo screen. </DD>

		<DD> I pop the silver Buddha that I wear around my neck into my mouth,
		  securing my lips around his little metal body. I move towards the sleeping man.
		  A helicopter soars overhead, he wakes up, and as he looks me in the eyes I
		  relate to him as I would to a helpless stranger. Has he a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html"> family</A> and a lady waiting for him at
		  home, somewhere beyond the Chinese drums and the double
		  <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html"> bass</A> that stalks like a wild cat through

		<DD> I saw this incredible documentary by this Australian cameraman who
		  went on the front line in Vietnam, filming from the Vietnamese point of view,
		  so it was very biased against the Americans. He said it really changed him,
		  because until you live on their level like that, when it's complete survival,
		  you don't know what it's about. He's never been the same since, because it's so
		  devastating, people dying all the time. </DD>

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The way he portrayed the Vietnamese was as this really crafted,
		  beautiful race. The Americans were these big, fat, pink, smelly things who the
		  Vietnamese could smell coming for miles because of the tobacco and cologne. It
		  was devastating, because you got the impression that the Americans were so
		  heavy and awkward, and the Vietnamese were so beautiful and all getting wiped
		  out. They wore a little silver Buddha on a chain around their neck and when
		  they went into action they'd pop it into their mouth, so if they died they'd
		  have Buddha on their lips. I wanted to write a song that could somehow convey
		  the whole thing, so we set it in the jungle and had helicopters, crickets and
		  little Balinese frogs. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> I saw a programme with a camera man on the front line in Vietnam.
		  The Vietnamese were portrayed as being very craftful people who treated their
		  fighting as an art. They could literally smell the Americans coming through the
		  jungle. Their culture of Coke cans and ice creams actually made them smell.

		<DD> Anyway, I learnt that before the Vietnamese went into action they
		  popped a little silver Buddha in their mouths. I thought that was quite
		  beautiful. </DD>
