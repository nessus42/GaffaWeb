		<DD> It's that whole thing of how, in some situations, it's the dream you
		  want, not the real thing. It was pursuing a conscious realisation that a person
		  is really enjoying the fantasy and aware it won't become reality. So often you
		  think it's the end you want, but this is actually looking at the process that
		  will never get you there. Bit of a heart-game you play with yourself. (1989,

		<DD> How interesting! God, yes, you're...absolutely right but it's not
		  something I was conscious of at all. It's a desire to have something you can't
		  have, but in a lot of cases if the dream came true it would be horrible. The
		  dream holds the fascination and power. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I wanted a sort of eastern sounding rhythm. I wrote it first on the
		  piano, though the words were completely different, except for the choruses. I
		  did it on the piano to a Fairlight rhythm that Del programmed - I think that
		  maybe because of the quality of the sounds, it was harder for Del to come up
		  with the patterns. And I was more strict - he found it much harder. I think the
		  pattern in ``<CITE>Heads</CITE>We're<CITE>Dancing</CITE>'' is really good -
		  really unusual, the best he came up with. But ``<CITE>Never Be Mine</CITE>''
		  was kind of tabla based. We got Eberhard (WEBER) over to play
		  <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html">bass</A> and he played on the whole song. When
		  we were trying to piece it together later we kept saying it just doesn't feel
		  right, so we just took the bass out and had it in these two sections. You
		  hardly notice it going out at all. I think the song has a very light feel about
		  it, which helps the whole imagery. The Uilean pipes have a very light feel, and
		  the piano is light... I think it's a nice contrast when the bass suddenly come
		  in. </DD>

		<DD> The piano on this is an upright Bernstein that has a really nice
		  sound - I think it has to do with proportions for us. We did have a big piano
		  and it's a small room, and it didn't record well. The small piano sounds much
		  bigger. </DD>

		electric piano? </B></P>

		<DD> If I write the song on piano in the studio, chances are that's how
		  it will be. If I write at home on the electric piano, or the synth, it's
		  probably going to be a synth track. I was getting worried at one point that so
		  many of the songs are all based around the piano. On <CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">Hounds of Love</A></CITE> I got away
		  from that, and most of the songs are based around the Fairlight, which gave
		  them different flavours. (1989, <CITE><A
