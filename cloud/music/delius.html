	 <P> <B> I'm wondering if this next composer was one that you were
		introduced to by your <A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A>, and this of
		course is delius. And you've written a song about him on your <CITE><A
		HREF="../music/never_for_ever_album.html">never for ever</A></CITE> album. You
		are a fan of several of his pieces. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, Delius was really introduced to me by Ken Russell, on
		  <A HREF="../subjects/television.html"> television</A>. I think people have
		  probably heard about <CITE>Song of Summer</CITE> that was shown - a beautiful
		  piece of <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A>, about Delius's later life.
		  </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> How old were you when you saw that? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I must have been about ten. But the imagery was just so beautiful,
		  you just don't forget it. It's the most incredible
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>. And if I could make a plea, I really
		  wish the BBC could show it again. There are so many people that could benefit
		  greatly from seeing it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The piece that we're going to play next is called ``Song to be Sung
		  of a Summer's Night on the Water.'' This is a line I used, in fact, in the song
		  on the album. And there's a quote from Delius as to his favourite retreat, that
		  he imagined, and I thought it would tie in rather nicely, going into the music.
		  He says: ``White butterflies flitting from petal to petal, and golden brown
		  bees murmuring in the warm, quivering summer air. Beneath the shade of the old
		  trees flows a quiet river with water-lilies, and in a boat, almost hidden, two
		  people. A thrush is singing in the distance." </DD>

	 <P> <B> [<I>An excerpt from <CITE>song to be sung of
		a</CITE>summer's<CITE>night on the water,</CITE> from a suite of three songs
		for <CITE>a cappella</CITE> choir, is played.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> An extract from <CITE>song to be sung of a summer night</CITE> by
		delius. Kate, we know that many devotees of a particular form of music are
		intolerant of others. In the early days of rock 'n' roll, for example,
		classical music-buffs would condemn rock. And unfortunately some rock fans are
		intolerant of classical music. Have any of your fans questioned the fact that
		you wrote a track about delius? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Not one. I think the thing about music is that it isn't something
		  that should be labeled; and I think it's the human element that labels it.
		  Music should be all-embracing. There should be no snobbery, because music is
		  one entity. It's not lots of different things. But no, I've not found that from
		  any of my fans, I think they're all extremely openminded people who appreciate
		  music as one thing. Not sectionalised devotees, yeah. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes that was what was responsible really for inspiring the song and

		<DD> Yes, I have. But really only in the last year and I can't understand

	 <P> <B> Fenby: Oh, I see, yes. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> What do you think frederick delius would have thought if he'd seen
		that kate bush display that we just witnessed [<I>Kate's delius video</I>]?
		</B></P>
	 <P> <B> Fenby: Well, delius was a great individualist and I think he would
		have applauded you for at least doing your thing your own way [<I>Audience
		laughs</I>] because he hated copiests, whether it was in music or anything else
		and I think he would accepted that as a very gracious tribute. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Interviewer interrupts</I>] but it is quite a great gracious
		tribute isn't it? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Fenby: It is, I think so, yes. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Harty: [<I>Interrupts kate attempting to speak</I>] you do push

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes we have. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> No, was it cathy and heathcliff, yes of course it was. Now into
		delius, where is the arrow of your powerful intellect going to fall next, I

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well I think the key is <A HREF="../subjects/emotion.html">
		  emotion</A>, Julian said it just a moment ago. The thing about Delius's music
		  is it's so emotional... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> It is. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Fenby: Yes. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> ... And really that is what art is, art is pure
		<A HREF="../subjects/emotion.html"> emotion</A>. And so anyone that is full of
		it will attract me, obviously, because I'm looking for the same thing, I'm

	 <P> <B> Fenby: But there was only one delius, wasn't there? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> Only one! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Fenby: Yeah. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Interrupts again</I>] did he... He quite liked popular music

		russel's film, do you remember, there is one evening that wind [<I>Up granford
		???</I>] he said, ``put on old man river.'' </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Fenby: Well, that reminded him of his time on a florida plantation
