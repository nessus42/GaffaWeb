		<DD> Well ``<CITE>Love and Anger</CITE>", of all the songs on the album,
		  is really the one I know the least about. I don't really know what it's about -
		  it's had so many different faces. But it was one of the first songs to be
		  written, but one of the last songs to be finished. And I think all the songs on
		  this album are about relationships. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> It was one of the most difficult to put together, yet the first to

		<DD> Obviously the imagery you get as a child is very strong. This is
		  about who you can or cannot confide in when there's something you can't talk
		  about. ``If you can't tell your sister, If you can't tell a priest...'' Who did
		  I have in the lyrics? Was it sister or mother? I can't remember. (1989,

		wouldn't keep coming back for more if they didn't enjoy the work and know
		they're appreciated. They're very good for unblocking the pipes, she says, then
		laughs at the indelicate <A HREF="../subjects/image.html"> image</A>. But the
		creative plumbing does get clogged on every album, including the sensual world.
		there's a song called ``<CITE>love and anger,</CITE>'' which I started two
		years ago and kept on shelving because it was rubbish. Paddy and dave gilmour,
		who put overdubs on it, had so much trouble with it. They kept on asking,
		``what's it about?'' and all I could say was, ``I dunno but, uh, doesn't it
		feel, uh, cohesive to you?'' well, I started bringing musicians in to see if
		they could bring it to life and john giblin, the bass player, just said, ``this
		is great!'' and came up with something fresh right away. It was so nice having
		someone put all this enthusiasm into a song I'd almost given up on. (1989,

		<DD> It's one of the most difficult songs I think I've ever written. It
		  was so elusive, and even today I don't like to talk about it, because I never
		  really felt it let me know what it's about. It's just kind of a song that
		  pulled itself together, and with a tremendous amount of encouragement from
		  people around me. There were so many times I thought it would never get on the
		  album. But I'm really pleased it did now. (1989, <CITE><A

		HEIGHT="16">"<CITE>Love and anger</CITE>'' was a track we did early on, but I
		got fed up with it and must've left it for two years. And then I thought;
		``well, maybe I'll go back to it.'' so I dug the song out, but still it nearly
		didn't go on the album because I wasn't happy at all. The tune was there, I
		just couldn't get any lyrics or work out what to do with the instruments. I
		just didn't know what I wanted to say. Really, it was a bugger, that song. And
		in some ways I still don't know what I'm wanting to say. But what the hell...

	 <P> <B> She trails off, still doubtful. But as for the message contained on
		the album she is more sure: If I'm saying anything, it's that if people are
		having a hard time and things look really dark and it seems like you can't get
		out, then try not to worry too much. It'll be alright, someone will come and
		help. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Raw</A></CITE>) </B></P>

		<DD> I couldn't get the lyrics. They were one of the last things to do. I
		  just couldn't find out what the song was about, though the tune was there. The
		  first verse was always there, and that was the problem, because I'd already set
		  some form of direction, but I couldn't follow through. I didn't know what I
		  wanted to say at all. I guess I was just tying to make a song that was
		  comforting, up tempo, and about how when things get really bad, it's alright
		  really - ``Don't worry old bean. Someone will come and help you out. </DD>

		<DD> The song started with a piano, and Del put a straight rhythm down.
		  Then we got the drummer, and it stayed like that for at least a year and a
		  half. Then I thought maybe it could be okay, so we got
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dave_gilmour.html"> Dave Gilmour</A> in. This is actually
		  one of the more difficult songs - everyone I asked to try and play something on
		  this track had problems. It was one of those awful tracks where either
		  everything would sound ordinary, really MOR, or people just couldn't come to
		  terms with it. They'd ask me what it was about, but I didn't know because I
		  hadn't written the lyrics. Dave was great - I think he gave me a bit of a
		  foothold there, really. At least there was a guitar that made some sense. And
		  John [<I>Giblin</I>] putting the bass on - that was very important. He was one
		  of the few people brave enough to say that he actually liked the song. </DD>

		<DD> When I don't know what's happening, yes. But that song was just so
		  bizarre. In some ways it's a very ordinary structure compared to the other
		  songs. I think putting the Valiha on was very important. It's a beautiful
		  sounding instrument - it looks a bit like a Zither, and it's from Madagascar.
		  It sounds like sunshine - it has this really happy, bubbly sound. I think that
		  really helped to give the song a different perspective. It's a very
		  straightforward treatment - drums, <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html">bass</A>,
		  guitar, piano - and I think for me it's one of the more straightforward songs
		  on the album. A chirpy little number. (1989, <CITE><A
