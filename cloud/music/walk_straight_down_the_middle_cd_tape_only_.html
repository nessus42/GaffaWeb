		<DD> It's a bit less worked on than the other tracks. It's about try not
		  to get caught up in extremes. My mother was down the garden when the funny bits
		  at the end were being played. She rushed in and said she'd heard some peacocks
		  in the garden! How sweet! I can't take the song seriously now. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I fancied being Captain Beefheart at that point, and it just came to
		  me: standing out, calling for help in the middle. It just went,
		  ``BBRRRROOOOAAAAAAAAA'' </DD>

		<DD> It's the idea of how our fear are sometimes holding us back, and yet
		  there's really no need to be frightened. Like ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/the_fog.html"> The Fog</A></CITE>:'' being scared because the
		  water's deep, you could be drowned; but actually if you put your feet down the
		  bottom's there and it's only waist high, so what's the problem? Just get on
		  with it: that's what I'm trying to tell myself. </DD>

		<DD> "<CITE>Walk Straight Down the Middle</CITE>'' came together very
		  quickly. It's about following either of two extremes, when you really want to
		  plough this path straight down the middle. Rather than ``WAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH":
		  being thrown from one end of the spectrum to the other. I'd like to think of
		  myself as holding the centre, whereas in fact I'm - ``WAAARRRRGGGGHHHH'' -
		  taking off all the time. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think its a very difficult question, that one, because making
		  music is such an elusive thing. I guess with a song like that, that was very
		  much just a matter of me playing around with some chords on the fairlight and I
		  came up with the tune and then of course
		  <A HREF="../subjects/eberhard_weber.html"> Eberhard Weber</A> put in his
		  <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html"> bass</A> on, gave the song such a strong
		  personality. It kind of took on a life of its own as most of these songs do.

		<DD> That song was definitely the quickest I've ever recorded anything.
		  We'd given ourselves a specific day to cut it, so I had to do it fast. The
		  backing track I'd originally recorded ages ago. At the time I wasn't happy with
		  the lyrics, and I felt the song needed more developing. When we came back to
		  hear it again, both Del and myself were really impressed with the sounds and
		  how together the song sounded; previously we thought it had been rubbish. </DD>

		<DD> I wrote the lyrics, recorded the <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html">
		  vocals</A>, backing vocals and synth overdubs in one day, which is totally
		  unheard of for me. The next day we did some more overdubs, and then mixed. I'm
		  glad it was tagged on. We made the gap longer, so that you could get a sense
		  that the album was finished, it sounds okay, but I don't think it holds the
		  same depths that the other tracks do. </DD>

		<DD> Terrible. I couldn't cope. I couldn't sit and anguish over my
		  lyrics. It was very difficult. But I think it's all right, some nice sounds,
		  nothing special. The whole thing is just an album, that's what I keep telling
		  myself. </DD>
