		<DD> So there's comfort for the guy in my band, as when he dies, he'll go
		  ``Hi, Jimi!'' It's very tongue-in-cheek, but it's a great thought that if a
		  musician dies, his soul will join all the other musicians' and a poet will join
		  all the Dylan Thomases and all that. (1981, <CITE><A

		<DD> None of those people are frightened by
		  <A HREF="../subjects/death.html"> death</A> anymore. It's almost something
		  they're looking forward to. All of us have such a deep fear of death. It's the
		  ultimate unknown, at the same time it's our ultimate purpose. That's what we're
		  here for. So I thought this thing about the death-fear. I like to think I'm
		  coming to terms with it, and other people are too. The song was really written
		  after someone very special died. [<I>Bill duffield, on the opening night of the

		<DD> Although the song had been formulating before and had to be written
		  as a comfort to those people who are afraid of dying, there was also this idea
		  of the music, energies in us that aren't physical: art, the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> in people. It can't die, because where
		  does it go? It seems really that music could carry on in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A> form, radio waves... There are
		  people who swear they can pick up symphonies from Chopin, Schubert. We're
		  really transient, everything to do with us is transient, except for these
		  non-physical things that we don't even control... (1980, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I have just finished reading shakespeare's <CITE>othello.</CITE> in
