		<DD> This is about people... well, about the modern situation, where more
		  and more people are having less contact with human beings. We spend all day
		  with machines; all night with machines. You know, all day, you're on the phone,
		  all night you're watching telly. Press a button, this happens. You can get your
		  <A HREF="../subjects/shopping.html"> shopping</A> from the Ceefax! It's like
		  this long chain of machines that actually stop you going out into the world.
		  It's like more and more humans are becoming isolated and contained in their
		  homes. And this is the idea of someone who spends all their time with their
		  computer and, like a lot of people, they spend an obsessive amount of time with
		  their computer. People really build up heavy relationships with their
		  computers! And this person sees an ad in a magazine for a new program: a
		  special program that's for lonely people, lost people. So this buff sends off
		  for it, gets it, puts it in their computer and then like , it turns into this
		  big voice that's saying to them, ``Look, I know that you're not very happy, and
		  I can offer you love: I'm her to love you. I love you!'' And it's the idea of a
		  divine energy coming through the least expected thing. For me, when I think of
		  computers, it's such a cold contact and yet, at the same time, I really believe
		  that computers could be a tremendous way for us to look at ourselves in a very
		  spiritual way because I think computers could teach us more about ourselves
		  than we've been able to look at, so far. I think there's a large part of us
		  that is like a computer. I think in some ways, there's a lot of natural
		  processes that are like programs... do you know what I mean? And I think that,
		  more and more, the more we get into computers and science like that, the more
		  we're going to open up our spirituality. And it was the idea of this that
		  this... the last place you would expect to find love, you know, real love, is
		  from a computer and, you know, this is almost like the voice of angels speaking
		  to this person, saying they've come to save them: ``Look, we're here, we love
		  you, we're here to love you!'' And it's just too much, really, because this is
		  just a mere human being and they're being sucked into the machine and they have
		  to be rescued from it. And all they want is that, because this is ``real''
		  contact. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir89_r1.html">Roger

		<DD> Yes, it is emotional disconnection, but then it's very much

		  kind of <A HREF="../subjects/emotion.html"> emotion</A> should really come from
		  the human instinctive force, and in this particular case it's coming from a
		  computer. I really liked the idea of playing with the whole imagery of
		  computers being so cold, so unfeeling. Actually what is happening in the song
		  is that this person conjures up this program that is almost like a visitation
		  of angels. They are suddenly given so much love by this computer - it's like,

		<DD> I suppose it's looking at society where more and more people are
		  being shut away in their homes with televisions and computers, and in a way
		  being encouraged not to come out. You know, there's so many people who live in
		  London in high-rise flats - they don't know their neighbors, they don't know
		  anyone else in the building. People are getting very isolated. It was the idea
		  of this person who had less and less human contact, and more and more contact
		  with their computer, where they were working on it all day and all night. They
		  see an advert in a magazine for a program for people who are lonely and lost,
		  so they write off for it. When they get it back in the mail and put it into the
		  computer, it's the idea - a bit like an old sci-fi
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A>, really - where it would just come to
		  life and suddenly there's this kind of incredible being there, like a great
		  spiritual visitation. This computer is offering this person love, and the idea
		  that they've had such little human warmth, they're getting this tremendous
		  affection and deep love from their computer. But it's so intense it's too much
		  for them to take, and they actually have to be rescued from just being killed
		  with love, I suppose. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> You know, a couple of years ago there was a lot of news about how

		  And yet I do feel there is a link. I do feel that, in some ways, computers

		<DD> I was very inspired by Stephen Hawking. Have you heard about this

		  created, as he sees it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I saw him on <A HREF="../subjects/television.html"> television</A>,
		  and it was so moving: this guy who's so close to the answer of it all, in a
		  body that was desperately...it was going, and quickly. And he was fighting
		  against the time he had left, and yet...Here was this guy who was probably the
		  closest to knowing it all, and he was speaking through this voice-processor. It
		  was almost, for me, like hearing the voice of God. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> What he was saying was so spiritual, it was not like a scientist. It
		  was someone saying, ``Well, look: it wasn't ever created and it won't end, it
		  just <CITE>is.</CITE>'' You know, this wonderful conceptualism is almost beyond
		  words, because he's gone so far through the process. Words can't explain what

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But if we ever found out, definitely, whether there's a god or not,
		it would be like definitely finding out there are aliens from outer space: The
		human race couldn't handle it, couldn't cope with not being the centre of the
		universe. And what if we found out there definitely isn't a god, what then? The
		truth would be too much to bear. The idea of <A

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We seem to be very much in the era of reason, and I think science is
		  the ultimate example of that. The other side is the instinctive, which is not
		  logical on any level. Perhaps it's the putting together of the two. You know,
		  like what you were just saying there about aliens? Most people's response would
		  be that it's just not possible because their reason says so, but then an
		  instinctive person might feel, 'Yes, this is so's because it just feels right.

		<DD> I was playing with the juxtaposition of high tech and spirituality.
		  I suppose one inspiration was a program I saw last year about a scientist
		  called Stephen Hawking who for years had been studying the universe, and his
		  concepts are like the closest we've ever come to understanding the answer. But
		  unfortunately he has a wasting-away disease, and the only way he can talk is
		  through voice process. It was one of the most moving things I've ever heard. He
		  was so close to the answers to everything, and yet his body was going on him -
		  in some ways it was the closest I'd ever come to hearing God speak! The things
		  he was saying were so spiritual, it was like he'd gone straight through science
		  and come out the other end. It was like he'd gone beyond words, and I do think
		  that there is this possibility with computers that we really could learn about
		  ourselves on levels that could take us into much deeper areas. With my music, I
		  like to combine both the old and the new, the high tech and the compassion from
		  the human element, the combination of synths and acoustic instruments. (1989,

		<DD> It's about someone being trapped in the city, in isolation at work,
		  where they just spend all the time with this computer, actually really
		  developing a relationship with it. Which a lot of people seem to do - they talk
		  to it. So the idea is in sending off this programme for the lonely lost; they
		  put it in and this sci-fi being comes out and says ``I know you're lost, but
		  I'm here to help you, we <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> you.'' This

		  can't take it [<I>Laughs</I>]. Its too much for them, its like trying to be
		  killed by love. I suppose in a way this song is saying that this world is
		  getting colder and getting more and more isolated. To experience love and
