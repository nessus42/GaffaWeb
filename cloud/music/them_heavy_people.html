		<DD> The idea for ``<CITE>Heavy People</CITE>'' came when I was just
		  sitting one day in my parents' house. I heard the phrase ``Rolling the ball''
		  in my head, and I thought that it would be a good way to start a song, so I ran
		  in to the piano and played it and got the chords down. I then worked on it from
		  there. </DD>

		<DD> It has lots of different people and ideas and things like that in
		  it, and they came to me amazingly easily - it was a bit like ``<CITE>Oh
		  England</CITE>", because in a way so much of it was what was happening at home
		  at the time. My brother and my father were very much involved in talking about
		  <A HREF="../subjects/gurdjieff.html"> Gurdjieff</A> and whirling Dervishes, and
		  I was really getting into it, too. It was just like plucking out a bit of that
		  and putting it into something that rhymed. And it happened so easily - in a
		  way, too easily. I say that because normally it's difficult to get it all to
		  happen at once, but sometimes it does, and that can seem sort of wrong. Usually
		  you have to work hard for things to happen, but it seems that the better you
		  get at them the more likely you are to do something that is good without any
		  effort. And because of that it's always a surprise when something comes easily.

		<DD> I thought it was important not to be narrow-minded just because we
		  talked about <A HREF="../subjects/gurdjieff.html"> Gurdjieff</A>. I knew that I
		  didn't mean his system was the only way, and that was why it was important to
		  include whirling Dervishes and Jesus, because they are strong, too. Anyway, in
		  the long run, although somebody might be into all of them, it's really you that
		  does it - they're just the vehicle to get you there. </DD>

		<DD> I always felt that ``<CITE>Heavy People</CITE>'' should be a single,
		  but I just had a feeling that it shouldn't be a second single, although a lot
		  of people wanted that. Maybe that's why I had the feeling - because it was to
		  happen a little later, and in fact I never really liked the album version much
		  because it should be quite loose, you know: it's a very human song. And I
		  think, in fact, every time I do it, it gets even looser. I've danced and sung
		  that song so many times now, but it's still like a hymn to me when I sing it. I
		  do sometimes get bored with the actual words I'm singing, but the meaning I put
		  into them is still a comfort. It's like a prayer, and it reminds me of
		  direction. And it can't help but help me when I'm singing those words.
		  Subconsciously they must go in. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> I've read some of his work, and recently saw the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> <CITE>Meetings With Remarkable
		  Men,</CITE> and had tea with Peter Brook, the director, afterwards. Pa and my
		  brother John are into him seriously, and I'm hoping to persuade John to write
