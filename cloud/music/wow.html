		<DD> "<CITE>Wow</CITE>'' is a song about the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/music_business.html"> music business</A>, not just rock
		  music but show business in general, including acting and theatre. People say
		  that the music business is about ripoffs, the rat race, competition, strain,
		  people trying to cut you down, and so on, and though that's all there, there's
		  also the magic. It was sparked off when I sat down to try and write a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/pink_floyd.html"> pink floyd</A> song, something spacey;
		  Though I'm not surprised no-one has picked that up, it's not really
		  recognisable as that, in the same way as people haven't noticed that ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/kite.html"> kite</A></CITE>'' is a bob marley song, and
		  <CITE>don't push your foot on the heartbrake</CITE>'' is a patti smith song.
		  When I wrote it I didn't envisage performing it - the performance when it
		  happened was an interpretation of the words I'd already written. I first made
		  up the visuals in a hotel room in new zealand, when I had half an hour to make
		  up a routine and prepare for a tv show. I sat down and listened to the song
		  through once, and the whirling seemed to fit the music. Those who were at the
		  last concert of the tour at hammersmith must have noticed a frogman appear
		  through the dry ice it was one of the crew's many last night ``pranks'' and was
		  really amazing. I'd have liked to have had it in every show. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, I think I there are probably two, for me. I've really enjoyed
		  <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">recording</A> ``<CITE>Wow</CITE>'' I'm
		  very, very pleased with my vocal performance on that, because we did it a few
		  times, and although it was all in tune and it was okay, there was just
		  something missing. And we went back and did it again and it just happened, and
		  I've really pleased with that, it was very satisfying. (1978, <CITE><A
