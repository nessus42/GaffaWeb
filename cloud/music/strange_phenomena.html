		<DD> This next song is called ``<CITE>Strange Phenomena</CITE>'' and it's
		  all about the coincidences that happen to all of us all of the time. Like maybe
		  you're listening to the <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html"> radio</A> and a
		  certain thing will come up, you go outside and it will happen again. It's just
		  how similar things seem to attract together, like the saying ``birds of a
		  feather flock together'' and how these things do happen to us all the time.
		  Just strange coincidences that we're only occasionally aware of. And maybe
		  you'll think how strange that is, but it happens all the time. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DD> "<CITE>Strange Phenomena</CITE>'' is about how coincidences cluster
		  together. We can all recall instances when we have been thinking about a
		  particular person and then have met a mutual friend who - totally unprompted -
		  will begin talking about that person. That's a very basic way of explaining
		  what I mean, but these ``clusters of coincidence'' occur all the time. We are
		  surrounded by strange phenomena, but very few people are aware of it. Most take
		  it as being part of everyday life. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Music

		<DD> Oh yes, I do. The thing about us humans is that we consider
		  ourselves it, that we know everything. I think we're abusing our power and are
		  guided by things we don't know about that are much stronger then us. But you
		  can't label them if you don't know what they are. Also, it tends to sound a bit
		  trendy like ``the cosmic forces'' and it's cruel to do that because most
		  religions have been exploited. As long as they're not misinterpreted they're
		  good because they give the individual something to hold onto. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, It's all about coincidences. And there's in fact a school of
		  thought about that called, well it's Synchronicity. And it's about all the
		  things that happen that are very similar and how one day all these really
		  strange coincidences will happen to you. And alot of these happen to me. Like
		  I'll be talking about something to someone and I'll go home and someone will
		  ring me up about the same thing. And I think it's one of our phenomenas, I must
		  admit, yeah. </DD>

		<DD> I think by what you think and how you are you attract things to you.
		  I think if you are a negative unhappy person a lot of negative unhappy things
		  could happen to you. I really believe in that, yeah. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Oh, dear. Well they do happen alot, like just being places and

		<DD> Well, it's a buddist chant actually, and I couldn't actually tell

		<DD> Club member Matthew Toreson has sent in an explanation, which he
