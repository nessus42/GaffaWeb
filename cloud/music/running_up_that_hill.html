		<DD> The first track on the first side is ``<CITE>Running Up That
		  Hill,</CITE>'' and I'm sure you will have all heard this by now. I am very
		  excited about how it's been received by people! It's so rewarding after working
		  for a long time to see that your work is being received with open arms. This
		  song is very much about two people who are in <A
		  HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>, and how the power of love is almost too
		  big for them. It leaves them very insecure and in fear of losing each other.
		  It's also perhaps talking about some fundamental differences between men and
		  women. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate20.html">KBC 18</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> It's a bit of a cliche at the moment, with so many songs called

		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> [<I>Kate is referring to two
		  then-recent pop singles, ``the power of love'' by huey lewis and the news, and
		  ``the power of love'' by jennifer rush, both of which were big hits in england
		  in 1985 - ied</I>], and the strength that is created between two people when
		  they're very much in love, but the strength can also be, um...uh...threatening,
		  violent, dangerous as well as gentle, soothing, loving. And it's saying that if
		  these two people could swap places - if the man could become the woman and the
		  woman the man, that perhaps they could understand the feelings of that other
		  person in a truer way, understanding them from that gender's point of view, and
		  that perhaps there are very subtle differences between the sexes that can cause
		  problems in a relationship, especially when people really do care about each

		<DD> "<CITE>Running Up That Hill</CITE>'' was one of the first songs that
		  I wrote for the album. It was very nice for me that it was the first single
		  released, I'd always hoped that would be the way. It's very much about a
		  relationship between a man and a woman who are deeply in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> and they're so concerned that things
		  could go wrong - they have great insecurity, great fear of the relationship
		  itself. It's really saying if there's a possibility of being able to swap
		  places with each other that they'd understand how the other one felt, that when
		  they were saying things that weren't meant to hurt, that they weren't meant
		  sincerely, that they were just misunderstood. In some ways, I suppose the basic
		  difference between men and women, where if we could swap places in a
		  relationship, we'd understand each other better, but this, of course, is all
		  theoretical anyway. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Open

		  thought, ``well, no, why not a deal with God!'' You know, because in a way it's
		  so much more powerful the whole idea of asking God to make a deal with you. You

		  was Twyla Tharp's ``Catherine Wheel'' and I think that's because she was so

		  on video that we'd taped that had a section where people were wearing these
		  photographic masks. And we just felt that it was a really interesting idea,
		  this crowd that would suddenly sort of rush in through the dance sequence. And
		  the idea of the crowd being the force of either the man or the woman and so the
		  faces change from the man to the woman. And then the idea of drowning in
		  yourself. Just sort of those kind of plays on things. (1985, <CITE><A

		the sleeve for the ``<CITE>running up that hill</CITE>'' come to be archery
		themed and the idea of lyrics on kate's back? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: The archery... Archery is something that we have been
		interested in for many years. It symbolizes the very basic learning processes,
		archery. You aim an arrow at a target and you let it go and it flies towards
		the target, it misses the middle and it moves a little bit to the left and a
		little bit low, then you know that the next arrow you're going to shoot has to
		be a little bit to the right and a bit higher. And [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] where
		you find another learning process [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] spending all the
		english summer walking up and down the hundred yards between the target and the
		[<I>??? Inaudible</I>]. And [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] a few summers ago kate was
		very active, very good actually, too. Very good [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] skills.
		Excellent [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] and it just [<I>??? Inaudible</I>]. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Jay: I think there's some levels of archery which now... In terms
		of a simple fact, you can see archery as... With the left hand holding the bow,
		as the future, and the right hand is pulling this way, it's going backwards, as
		the past. And you're the present. You could see it as the left hand as the
		passive thing, the female, and the right hand as the male. And it's obviously
		[<I>??? Inaudible</I>]. And there are a lot of esoteric levels, but I'm sure
		they're not very interesting. Perhaps they threatened to get into the [<I>???
		Single fan</I>]. </B></P>

		<DD> And the idea of the lyrics written on Kate's back was... we'd been
		  working on a series for about the last eighteen months and a photograph...
		  because I never found a photograph and a poem written on the page opposite - it
		  never seems to work. You look at the poem and you're having to read the words
		  and that's more concentrated thing, particularly these days, because less of us
		  are used to it. And then you look at the photograph and you get a much more
		  immediate reaction. So trying to balance all that's going on. And I though the
		  only way to do it was actually to write the poem in the photograph. And writing
		  it on the person, that meant you could take a portion of the person, you could
		  write your poem. You take a photograph too and get a much more complete thing.
		  So I'd done a few of those and Kate saw them and liked the idea, so we tried...
		  initially we were going to try them for the album cover, but that didn't work
		  out, it was much too busy. But it worked well I think for the single back.

		<DD> It's a kind of thread that's been running through that song. The

		  section where there's an invisible bow. [<I>Imitates end of video and
