		<DD> The side is about someone who is in the water alone for the night.
		  ``<CITE>And Dream of Sheep</CITE>'' is about them fighting sleep. They're very
		  tired and they've been in the water waiting for someone to come and get them,
		  and it's starting to get dark and it doesn't look like anyone's coming and they
		  want to go to sleep. They know that if they go to sleep in the water they could
		  turn over and drown, so they're trying to keep awake; but they can't help it,
		  they eventually fall asleep - which takes us into the second song. (1985,

	 <P> <B> The continuous flow of music on a compact disk masks the fact that
		<CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">hounds of love</A></CITE>
		and <CITE>the ninth wave</CITE> were conceived as two quite separate sides to
		the album. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes they were. I started off writing, I think, ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/running_up_that_hill.html"> Running Up That Hill</A></CITE>", ``
		  Hounds of Love", and then I think probably ``<CITE>Dream of Sheep</CITE>.'' And
		  once I wrote that, that was it, that was the beginning of what then became the
		  concept. And really, for me, from the beginning, <CITE>The Ninth Wave</CITE>
		  was a film, that's how I thought of it. It's the idea of this person being in
		  the water, how they've got there, we don't know. But the idea is that they've
		  been on a ship and they've been washed over the side so they're alone in this
		  water. And I find that horrific imagery, the thought of being completely alone
		  in all this water. And they've got a life jacket with a little light so that if
		  anyone should be traveling at night they'll see the light and know they're
		  there. And they're absolutely terrified, and they're completely alone at the
		  mercy of their imagination, which again I personally find such a terrifying
		  thing, the power of ones own imagination being let loose on something like
		  that. And the idea that they've got it in their head that they mustn't fall
		  asleep, because if you fall asleep when you're in the water, I've heard that
		  you roll over and so you drown, so they're trying to keep themselves awake.

	 <P> <B> Going back to the obscurity of some of your songs that are personal

		<DD> I think it works on the basis of: if it moves you, it could move
		  others. Hitchcock was talking about his films and saying the best subjects for
		  his films that were frightening were things that frightened him - like
		  <CITE>Vertigo.</CITE> Apparently he was terrified of heights. It seems logical,
		  doesn't it? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Yeah, sure. Hitchcock was brilliant. </B></P>

		<DD> Yes, I agree, a genius. An engineer we were working with picked out
		  the line in ``<CITE>And Dream of Sheep</CITE>'' that says ``Come here with me
		  now.'' I asked him why he liked it so much. He said, ``I don't know, I just
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html"> love</A> it. It's so moving and comforting.''
		  I don't think he even knew what was being said exactly, but the song is about
		  someone going to sleep in the water, where they're alone and frightened. And
		  they want to go to sleep, to get away from the situation. But at the same time
		  it's dangerous to go to sleep in water, you could drown. When I was little, and
		  I'd had a bad dream, I'd go into my parents' bedroom round to my mother's side
		  of the bed. She'd be asleep, and I wouldn't want to wake her, so I'd stand
		  there and wait for her to sense my presence and wake up. She always did, within
		  minutes; and sometimes I'd frighten her - standing there still, in the darkness
		  in my nightdress. I'd say, ``I've had a bad dream,'' and she'd lift bedclothes
		  and say something like ``Come here with me now.'' It's my mother saying this
		  line in the track, and I briefed her on the ideas behind it before she said it.
		  And I think it's the motherly comfort that this engineer picked up on. In fact,
		  he said this was his favourite part of the album. (1987, <CITE><A
