		<DD> I think the last album [<CITE>The Dreaming</CITE>] was very dark and
		  about pain and negativity and the way people treat each other badly. It was a
		  sort of cry really. And I think perhaps the biggest influence on the last album
		  was the fact that I was <A HREF="../subjects/producing.html"> producing</A> it
		  and so I could actually do what I really wanted to for the first time. And
		  there were a lot of things that we wanted to experiment with, and I
		  particularly to play around with my voices because there are a lot of different
		  backing vocals and things like that. So the different textures were important
		  to me. I wanted to try and create pictures with the sounds by using effects.

	 <P> <B> The album <CITE>the dreaming</CITE> was quite a radical departure

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think it is different, but I don't know if it's that
		  different. It's very different from the first two albums, but the third album
		  is where I think we started to get there. I think it was a progression, really.
		  But perhaps not such an obvious one. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But it is quite...dark, I suppose, without meaning to be negative. I
		  think it is saying...nearly all those songs are saying that people are great,
		  but they really hurt each other, and you know, look at the things we do to each
		  other. <CITE>Why</CITE> do we do this...you know, questioning. I think albums
		  are like that, they're...they are little diaries. You know, you sort of sit
		  there and write - not autobiographical things - but what you feel at the time,
		  things that move you. I think it does say a lot about you at the time. (1985,

		<DD> After the last album, <CITE><A HREF="../music/never_for_ever_album.html"> Never For Ever</A></CITE>, I started
		  writing some new songs. They were very different from anything I'd ever written
		  before - they were much more rhythmic, and in a way, a completely new side to
		  my music. I was using different instruments, and everything was changing; and I
		  felt that really the best thing to do would be to make this album a real
		  departure - make it completely different. And the only way to achieve this was
		  to sever all the links I had had with the older stuff. The main link was
		  engineer Jon Kelly. Everytime I was in the studio Jon was there helping me, so
		  I felt that in order to make the stuff different enough I would have to stop
		  working with Jon. He really wanted to keep working with me, but we discussed it
		  and realised that it was for the best. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Popix</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> I think the last album [<CITE>The Dreaming</CITE>] is about trying
		  to cope...to get through all the shit. I think it <CITE>was</CITE> positive:
		  showing how certain people approach all these negative things - war, crime,
		  etc. I don't think I'm actually an aggressive person, but I <CITE>can</CITE>
		  be. But I release that energy in work. I think it's wrong to get angry. If
		  people get angry, it kind of freaks everybody out and they can't concentrate on
		  what they're doing. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i83_nme1.html">NME</A></CITE>) </DD>

	 <P> <B> You mentioned earlier that you wanted the album to be different, to

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it's very important for me to change. In fact, as soon as the
		  songs began to be written, I knew that the album was going to be quite
		  different. I'd hate it, especially now, if my albums became similar, because so
		  much happens to me between each album - my views change quite drastically.
		  What's nice about this album is that it's what I've always wanted to do. For
		  instance, the Australian thing: well, I wanted to do that on the last album,
		  but there was no time. There are quite a few ideas and things that I've had
		  whizzing around in my head that just haven't been put down. I've always wanted
		  to use more traditional influences and instruments, especially the Irish ones.
		  I suppose subconsciously I've wanted to do all this for quite some time, but
		  I've never really had the time until now. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Popix</A></CITE>) </DD>

		  situation. Besides I occasionally try to imagine what it would be like. I think

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think that's certainly contributed to the fact that it's
		  taken a long time. But there are alot of other things as well. The songs
		  themselves were very demanding, especially emotionally. And they seemed to be
		  requiring more special sounds, new treatment, that sort of thing. So it was
		  harder to find sounds that were right and it took longer to get ideas
		  manifested. And also, I was having to work between three or four studios in
		  order to be able to get the time to make sure that the impetuous was carried on
		  and the album was finished. Because I was making an album at the same time a
		  lot of other people were and obviously everybody wanted to use the same top
		  studios in London, so I was having to move around alot, which was hard. </DD>

	 <P> <B> I would have thought if you're going to take that long over an

		kinda rescinds over the few weeks and you think, ``well maybe that wasn't a
		great song.&quot; </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Laughs</I>] that really was my biggest problem. I mean they're
		all kinds of problems like lack of confidence and worrying about things, but
		the real problem was that I was starting to lose interest in the songs and I
		was starting to worry about the songs, wondering, as you were just saying, if
		they were still as good as I thought they were when I actually wrote them. And
		you just have to be working with really good people who keep saying ``it's
		great, don't worry it sounds great.&quot; </B></P>

		<DD> The idea was that the third or fourth time a person listened to the

		  and <CITE>Magical Mystery Tour</CITE> - there just isn't a bad track on them,

		  That's the principle of music: to liberate all the tensions that exist inside
		  you. I tried to give free rein to all my fantasies. Although all of the songs
		  do not talk about me, they represent all the facets of my personality, all my
		  different attitudes in relation to the world. In growing older, I see more and

		  personality than that of the composer. As far as my lyrics are concerned, I
		  take a great deal of care; they are very oblique and describe situations that
		  are not always simple. It's not always easy, but it's necessary to make an
		  effort and listen actively, give of oneself. But even if nobody understands my
		  stories, to understand the music, once more, they must play it
		  <CITE>loud!</CITE> </DD>

		<DD> I wouldn't say that I'm not. I think I'm realistic. If you want to
		  accomplish things, you must accept compromises. That applies particularly to
		  human beings, who are so determined to get what they want that they only give
		  in when they've been defeated. It's necessary to know how to give in, to accept
		  and defer, sometimes. Situations of <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>,
		  for example, begin very simply; then, even before you can perceive it, they
		  become a spider's web of problems, so inextricable that they end in the most
		  complete chaos. I just lived through a marvelous and destructive adventure. I
		  believe furthermore that love and inter-personal relationships are the most
		  important things in existence. My family represents everything for me. And even
		  if, every time, failures repeat themselves, I never take them as such, but
		  rather as new tests on the path that I have still to run. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i86_gec.html">Guitares et Claviers</A></CITE>) </DD>

	 <P> <B> I think <CITE>the dreaming</CITE> is just about as good an album as

		<DD> That's a very difficult question. I don't know. I think as long as

		  think also, the thing about records is that they don't necessarily stop selling
		  after a year of being released. I think it's possible that <CITE>The

		  `` Houdini.'' That song is taken from Mrs. Houdini's point of view because she
		  spent a lot of time working with him and helping with his tricks. One of the
		  ways she would help was to give him a parting kiss, just as he was off into his
		  watertank or whatever, and as she kissed him she'd pass a tiny little key which
		  he would then use later to unlock the padlocks. </DD>

		<DD> The last album was very much the starting point for this one.
		  Perhaps the art work and some of the idea of <CITE><A HREF="../music/never_for_ever_album.html"> Never For Ever</A></CITE> were
		  misconstrued because although they are very fairytale; on the cover they are
		  meant to depict positive and negative emotions that are very much a part of
		  human beings - that's really what a lot of my songs are about. </DD>

		<DD> No. The thing about all my album titles is that they're usually one

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I've got this book which is all about Aborigines and Australian art
		  and it's called <CITE>The Dreaming</CITE>. The song was originally called
		  ``Dreamtime&quot;, but when we found out that the other word for it was ``The
		  Dreaming'' it was so beautiful - just by putting ``the'' in front of
		  ``dreaming'' made something very different - and so I used that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It also seems to sum up a lot of the songs because one of the main
		  points about that time for the Aborigines was that it was very religious and
		  humans and animals were very closely connected. Humans were actually living in
		  animal's bodies and that's an idea which I particularly like playing with.
