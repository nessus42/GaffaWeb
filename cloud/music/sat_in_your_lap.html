		<DD> "<CITE>Sat in your lap</CITE>'' is very much a search for knowledge.
		  And about the kind of people who really want to have knowledge but can't be
		  bothered to do the things that they should in order to get it. So they're
		  sitting there saying how nice it would be to have this or to do that without
		  really desiring to do the things it takes you to get it. And also the more you
		  learn the more ignorant you realize you are and that you get over one wall to
		  find an even bigger one. [<I>Laughs</I>] (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think very much with that one it was the combination. It was a

		  was playing with several different images of knowledge, really the lack of
		  knowledge, i.e. people like dunces and jesters. It was a real romp [<I>??? -

		<DD> I already had the piano patterns, but they didn't turn into a song
		  until the night after I'd been to see a Stevie Wonder gig. Inspired by the
		  feeling of his music, I set a rhythm on the <CITE>Roland</CITE> and worked in
		  the piano riff to the high-hat and snare. I now had a verse and a tune to go
		  over it but only a few lyrics like </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> "I see the people working," </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> "I want to be a lawyer,'' and </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> "I want to be a scholar,'' so the rest of the lyrics became
		  ``na-na-na'' or words that happened to come into my head. I had some chords for
		  the chorus with the idea of a vocal being ad-libbed later. The rhythm box and
		  piano were put down, and then we recorded the backing
		  <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html">vocals</A> ``Some say that knowledge is...''
		  Next we put down the lead vocal in the verses and spent a few minutes getting
		  some lines worked out before recording the chorus voice. I saw this vocal being
		  sung from high on a hill on a windy day. The fool on the hill, the king of the
		  castle... ``I must admit, just when I think I'm king." </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The idea of the demos was to try and put everything down as quickly
		  as possible. Next came the brass. The CS80 is still my favourite synthesizer
		  next to the Fairlight, and as it was all that was available at the time, I
		  started to find a brass sound. In minutes I found a brass section starting to
		  happen, and I worked out an arrangement. We put the brass down andwe were ready
		  to mix the demo. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I was never to get that CS80 brass to sound the same again - it's
		  always the way. At The Townhouse the same approach was taken to record the
		  master of the track. We put down a track of the rhythm box to be replaced by
		  drums, <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html"> recording</A> the piano at the
		  same time. </DD>

		<DD> As I was <A HREF="../subjects/producing.html"> producing</A>, I

		<DD> We weren't going to put it on initially, because we thought it had
		  been a single such a long time ago, but a lot of people used to ask me if we
		  were putting ``<CITE>Sat In Your Lap</CITE>'' on the album and I'd say no, and
		  they would say ``Oh why not?'' and they'd be quite disappointed. So, as the
		  album's completion date got nearer and nearer, I eventually relented. I
		  re-mixed the track and we put it on. I'm so glad I did now, because it says so
		  much about side one, with its up-tempo beat and heavy drum rhythms - it's
		  perfect for the opening track. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> The single mix is different from the album. We very much wanted to
		  do another mix. The album has a definite flavour that was confirmed by the
		  mixes, so we wanted ``<CITE>Sat In Your Lap</CITE>'' to be a part of that. The
		  voice was also deliberately lifted, because we had quite a lot of feedback
		  about the lead voice being a little quiet on the single version. (1984,

		  feedback, and I'm lucky that the people closest to me, my friends and

		<DD> Piecing the album together is becoming like a big musical jigsaw,
		  and we're only halfway through. One particular phase at Abbey Road became
		  bizarre, as <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html"> recording</A> plus video met
		  at the same point in time, and at the same place. We'd been working on two
		  tracks in the studio, just taking the odd day and evening out for rehearsals;
		  and with getting in early for meetings, it was a very busy time for everybody.
		  [<I>One of these tracks is ``<CITE>sat in your lap,</CITE>'' for which the
		  video was taped at abbey road. The first single for the new album, it had not
		  yet been released when kate wrote this part of her article, although it had
		  come out by the time the <CITE>newsletter</CITE> reached fans. The other track
		  kate refers to is ``night of the swallow'' (see below). - ied</I>] Some days
		  became very unreal, as, while going for a cup of tea you would swear you heard
		  the sound of tinkling bells as the tip of the brightly coloured jester's hat
		  disappeared around the corner. And once when I ran out into the corridor, what
		  should whizz by but a dunce on roller-skates chased by four bulls who were
		  being followed by a flying book and an unbelieving door attendant. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The video was filmed over two days, one part at a video studio, the
		  other at the audio studios. The former provided the quick, easy technical sides
		  to be performed, the latter provided the space and presence. The large parquet
		  floor was to be a feature, and Abbey Road's past, full of dancing and singing
		  spirits, was to be conjured up in the present day by tapping feet to the sound
		  of jungle drums - only to be turned into past again through the wonder of
		  video-tape. The shots were sorted into a logical order: all long shots were
		  audio studio, all others were video studio. A storyboard was drawn up and was
		  very closely worked to, being hung on the wall on days of shootings. The
		  editing was a long, difficult job, as it was comprised of many sections which
		  had to be edited together (just like the big musical one). The editor worked
		  all day and into the next morning with great skill and patience, and only when
		  someone told us did we find out it had been his birthday and he'd worked it all
		  away. </DD>

		<DD> One of the exciting things about making the video was the
		  ``accessories'' we used, such as the lovely costumes and props. The jerk-jacket
		  which we used in ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/army_dreamers.html"> Army
		  Dreamers</A></CITE>'' was used again for a short sequence, and although there's
		  a silver wire, it feels like flying. Out of the harness and into the light of a
		  timeless tunnel, as a little magician's box springs to life and the room is
		  filled with laser and skaters. (1980, <CITE><A
