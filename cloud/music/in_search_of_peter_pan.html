		<DD> Not intentionally, no. But I think that's already been done a little
		  on this album. There's a song on in called ``<CITE>In Search of Peter
		  Pan</CITE>'' and it's sorta about childhood. And the book itself is an
		  absolutely amazing observation on paternal attitudes and the relationships
		  between the parents - how it's reflected on the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/children.html"> children</A>. And I think it's a really
		  heavy subject, you know, how a young innocence mind can be just controlled,
		  manipulated, and they don't necessarily want it to happen that way. And it's
		  really just a song about that. (1978, <CITE><A
