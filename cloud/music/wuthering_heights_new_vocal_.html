		<DD> I wanted to put a contemporary mark on it. I felt it sounded like a
		  very little girl singing that to me, and the production was very much a
		  Seventies production. And although there were some other tracks in there that
		  you could say the same thing of, they weren't as blatant as that one was. If I
		  had had the time I probably would have done the same to some of the other
		  tracks. But there was just no time; there was too much to do with
		  <A
		  HREF="../subjects/recording.html"> recording</A> and writing ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/experiment_iv.html"> Experiment Iv</A></CITE>'' plus doing the
		  video. It was a very intense period to get that out on the deadline. (1987,

		<DD> Well, to be honest, I think if we'd had more time I probably would
		  have done the same with a couple of other songs. I just felt that ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/wuthering_heights.html">Wuthering Heights</A></CITE>'' felt
		  particularly dated. It <CITE>sounded</CITE> dated. The other tracks were just
		  kind of holding their heads above water. And so we liked the idea of re-doing
		  the vocal and remixing the track - not re-<A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">
		  recording</A> anything else - just so we could bring it up to date, so we could
		  give it a more contemporary sound. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I'm happy with my voice now, and I suppose I wanted to make
		  ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/wuthering_heights.html">Wuthering
		  Heights</A></CITE>'' somehow step up through the decade. It sounded very dated
		  to me: my voice sounded so young,the production sounded so '70's. I like the
		  idea of taking the song I'm most associated with, and making it me now as
		  opposed to a very young girl, as I was in '77. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> It was a strange and exiting experience re-mixing and putting a new
		  vocal to this song. When I first sang it in 1977 my voice was so different.
