		<DD> Hello everyone. This is Kate Bush and I'm here with my new album
		  <CITE>The Kick Inside</CITE> and I hope you enjoy it. The album is something
		  that has not just suddenly happened. It's been years of work because since I
		  was a kid, I've always been writing songs and it was really just collecting
		  together all the best songs that I had and putting them on the album, really
		  years of preparation and inspiration that got it together. As a girl, really,
		  I've always been into words as a form of communication. And even at school I
		  was really into poetry and English and it just seemed to turn into music with
		  the lyrics, that you can make poetry go with music so well. That it can
		  actually become something more than just words; it can become something
		  special. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im78_tki.html">Self
		  Portrait</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> Maybe another interesting thing about this album is that two of the
		  tracks, ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/the_man_with_the_child_in_his_eyes.html"> The
		  Man With The Child In His Eyes</A></CITE>'' and ``<CITE>Saxophone Song</CITE>''
		  were recorded about three years ago. This was in fact my initial plunge into
		  the business, as they say, with the help of Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd. I
		  managed to get through to him through a contact of my brothers' and at that
		  time he was looking around for unknown talent. He came along and heard me and
		  we put some things down and he put up the money for me to make my first demo in
		  a proper recording studio with arrangements. I owe to him the fact that I got
		  my contract and that I'm where I am now. Two of these original tracks that we
		  had on the demo are on the album, so maybe that helps with the variation.

		<DD> There are thirteen tracks on this album. When we were getting it
		  together, one of the most important things that was on all our mind was, that
		  because there were so many, we wanted to try and get as much variation as we
		  could. To a certain extent, the actual songs allowed this because of the tempo
		  changes, but there were certain songs that had to have a funky rhythm and there
		  were others that had to be very subtle. I was very greatly helped by my
		  producer and arranger Andrew Powell, who really is quite incredible at tuning
		  in to my songs. We made sure that there was one of the tracks, just me and the
		  piano, to, again, give the variation. We've got a rock 'n' roll number in
		  there, which again was important. And all the others there are just really the
		  moods of the songs set with instruments, which for me is the most important
		  thing, because you can so often get a beautiful song, but the arrangements can
		  completely spoil it - they have to really work together. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think it went a bit over the top [<I>In being orientally
		  influenced</I>], actually. We had the kite, and as there is a song on the album
		  by that name, and as the kite is traditionally Oriental, we painted the dragon
		  on. But I think the lettering was just a bit too much. </DD>

		<DD> I was lucky to be able to express myself as much as I did,

		  went on, put harmonies where I wanted them... </DD>

		<DD> I was there throughout the entire mix. I feel that's very important.

		  able to produce my own stuff eventually. (1978, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> How did you manage, right from the word go, to find such a great
		bunch of musicians, all of them so terribly articulate and tasteful, yet none
		of them so stylized that he might detract from your own musical identity by
		imposing something inappropriately idiomatic? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, in all fairness, the first album was all down to the producer,
		  Andrew Powell, and the engineer, Jon Kelly. As far as I know, it was mainly
		  Andrew Powell who chose the musicians, he'd worked with them before and they
		  were all sort of tied in with Alan Parsons. There was Stuart Elliot on drums,
		  Ian Bairnson on guitar, David Paton on <A
		  HREF="../subjects/bass.html">bass</A>, and Duncan Mackay on electric keyboards.
		  And, on that first album, I had no say, so I was very lucky really to be given
		  such good musicians to start with. And they were lovely, 'cause they were all
		  very concerned about what I thought of the treatment of each of the songs. And
		  if I was unhappy with anything, they were more than willing to re-do their
		  parts. So they were very concerned about what I thought, which was very nice.
		  And they were really nice guys, eager to know what the songs were about and all
		  that sort of thing. I don't honestly see how anyone can play with feeling
		  unless you know what the song is about. You know, you might be feeling this
		  really positive vibe, yet the song might be something weird and heavy and sad.
		  So I think that's always been very important for me, to sit down and tell the
		  musicians what the song is about. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> That was a very important LP - it was my first, and was very

		<DD> I think it was probably the least experimental of all the albums.
		  I'd written, say, two hundred songs from which we chose the thirteen songs that
		  went on that. And it was recorded very quickly, there was very little time for
		  experimentation. It was something that had a lot of forethought gone into it.
