	 <P> <B> I've been noticing a theme of science in the last few songs you had
		out. ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/cloudbusting.html"> cloudbusting</A></CITE>''
		was an experiment that went very well, but ``<CITE>experiment iv</CITE>'' was
		one that want wrong. But in both cases the scientists were sympathetic
		characters, but they were frustrated and manipulated. Is that what you think
		about scientists? </B></P>

		<DD> I don't think it's always what I think about scientists, but I think
		  they are fascinating in that so often they're trying to create something that
		  they consider positive, productive and very much something that would help
		  mankind, but so often along the way those good intentions end up being used,
		  particularly by other people, for completely the opposite reasons. Particularly
		  experiments that end up being used by the military, things like the atom bomb.
		  I can see that perhaps when the guy was originally playing with that idea, he
		  had no idea where he'd end up, and that I'm sure that he wouldn't have the evil
		  intentions in his head initially. He was so caught up, so obsessed with the
		  pure level of the science that he didn't actually realize how it could be used.

	 <P> <B> What do you think about scientific experimentation? Are there
		limits to the things that people should be working on? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think that's very much part of the fascination, is that people
		  have to do that, that's what human beings are about - discovering things, and
		  perhaps the problem is that they're normally always connected by forces that do
		  not have that same kind of creative curiosity. The consequences, that's the
		  problem; the consequences are quite often hindsight, rather than on the way.

		<DD> I consider music a really positive force, it's something that is
		  there to help people, to make them happy, to make them think. So many wonderful
		  things, music therapy... It's a very positive energy and there's something
		  incredibly beautiful about music. And the thought of people using sound in such
		  a negative way - and there are definitely sonic experiments that go on, that
		  are used by the military - it's so obscene. The irony of using something that's
		  so beautiful, in a way, to actually kill people rather than help them, I find
		  fascinating. (1987, <CITE><A

		<DD> It's interesting to compare my first single with this later single.
		  And it's remarkable that after nine years I am still working with the same
		  drummer, Stuart Elliot. (C.1986, AVD) </DD>

	 <P> <B> I understand you directed this clip. How did it go, and why did you
		direct it? </B></P>

		<DD> Directing is a new experiment for me - actually, it was Experiment
		  III - and with this track I had such strong visual ideas while I was writing
		  the song that I wanted to give it another go. It's the first time the video and
		  song have come together. It was very hard work, but a lot of fun. </DD>

		<DD> We filmed in an old disused hospital, and the conditions were very
		  cold and damp, but everyone got very involved and we had a great time. </DD>

		<DD> The cast included Dawn French, Hugh Laurie, Richard Vernon, Peter
		  Vaughan, Del, Paddy, Jay, Lisa and many friends. It was wonderful to work with
		  people who I admire so much, and a very exciting experience. Paddy played the
		  lunatic, and in every take his sounds were just as impressive as his visuals -
		  I wish I'd put it onto tape. He literally ``threw'' himself into the part, and
		  the crew were so impressed they applauded him - a great accolade! </DD>

		<DD> Although this was the most complicated of my directions, it was so
		  much easier for me because I appeared in it only briefly, so I could
		  concentrate on being behind the camera, which I really enjoy. And it's so nice
		  to involve the people I like - not only are they great performers, but they're
		  good to be with. </DD>

		<DD> There were some wonderful moments, like filming in East London. We
		  had a field full of ``dead bodies'' who kept moving about to get more
		  comfortable, so we had to shout out over a loud-hailer, ``Stop moving - You're
		  supposed to be dead!'' And the music shop that we created for the shot
		  [<CITE>Music For Pleasure</CITE>] was so realistic that passers-by kept popping
		  in wanting to buy some of the instruments. (1987, <CITE><A
