		<DD> I think this album for me, unlike the last album, say, <CITE><A HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html">
		  Hounds of Love</A></CITE>, where I saw that as two sides - one side being
		  conceptual - this album is very much like short stories for me. Ten short
		  stories that are just saying something different in each one and it was a bit
		  like trying to paint the pictures accordingly. Each song has a different
		  personality and so they each a need little bit of something here, a little bit
		  of that there - just like people, you know, some people you can't walk up to
		  because you know they're a bit edgy first thing in the morning. So you have to
		  come up sideways to them, you know, and it's kind of like how the songs are
		  too. They have their own little personalities, and if it doesn't want you to do
		  it, it won't let you. (1990, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> When you start out on a project like this and you've got all these
		bits of songs and ideas, do you have any idea how it's going to turn out in the
		end? Do you have something in your mind? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, I don't think I do. I think just the thought of finishing the
		  album sometimes feels so far away that I don't know how it's going to sound
		  when it's all put together. I have an idea of how it will be in my head, but it
		  isn't really something I can see from the beginning at all. It's a long
		  journey. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> There's no idea of any big thought you want to get across or
		feeling that you want it to transmit to people as they listen to it? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think if I could be that sure of something like that at the
		  beginning of an album I don't think it would take me so long to make - she says
		  haa haa!!! THe problem for me is when I come to start an album I want it to be
		  different from the album before, so I have to try and start somewhere new,
		  start from scratch. It always feels like it's the first album I'm making and it
		  always feels like I've never sung before and never written a song before, and
		  ``God, how did I do this.'' I suppose gradually, after a tremendous amount of
		  doubt, I end up starting to get a sense of what I do want to say, but I
		  definitely don't have this at the beginning. Maybe the whole process of making
		  an album is, perhaps that for me, actually trying to find out what I want to
		  say now, and it's only at the end of the album I think I discover that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So what have you discovered? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think if there's anything thematic on this album (because
		  it's not conceptual at all, they're very much separate songs) it's maybe saying
		  to people, ``Look if you're in a really bad situation, if you're feeling really
		  down, if things are really awful, it's O.K., try not to be too unhappy, maybe
		  try talking to someone, try getting out of it, because you should be happy.''
		  Maybe it's trying to be comforting. Ideally I can't think of anything that
		  would move me more than to think that someone might listen to that album and
		  actually get some kind of comfort from it. That would just be fantastic for me.
		  So hey... I hope you're out there somebody!! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But as with most of your work, you get a feeling as you listen to
		these songs; A sort of feeling of something threatening behind it all, a bit of
		menace, something a little ``things that go bump in the night'' - I don't know.
		Is that something that you want be in there - that people feel slightly
		threatened? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That's a very good question and other people have said to me that
		  they think this album is very dark, although for me I think it's my happiest
		  album really. I find some of the tracks quite funny where other people say they
		  find them scary. Although I have a dark sense of humour, maybe it is a
		  subconscious thing that just goes into my music, because I think when I was
		  writing this album that was perhaps something I was feeling a little - a sense
		  of being a bit scared. Maybe it comes out in the music. I do think it's a very
		  big self- therapy thing now - the more I work on an album the more I think it's
		  almost a process for me to try and heal myself, have a look at myself. Do you
		  know what I mean? Actually a very selfish thing in a way, but I think art is. I
		  do think what artistic people are trying to do is work through their problems
		  through their art - look at themselves, confront all these things. Does that
		  sound O.K to you? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Oh yes, that sounds very reasonable, so these are all your problems
		on this record, which you have now got rid of and you've saddled the rest of us
		with? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think it is with every album, yes, and maybe because this album is
		  the most personal one yet for me, maybe it's more obvious. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> The most personal - how did that come about? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's not that the album is written about me, not that it is
		  autobiographical, but it is the most direct process I've used for an album.
		  It's in my own studio and I had a lot of time so as not to be under pressure by
		  outside forces. I've recorded the whole album with Del so it's just myself and
		  Del in a very close relationship working together very intensely and it was
		  hard for me to write this album. To actually write the songs was very
		  difficult, and for the first time really, I went through a patch where I just
		  couldn't write - I didn't know what I wanted to say. Maybe a little like we
		  touch on earlier, I just didn't know what I wanted to say, everything seemed
		  like rubbish - you know? It seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. Somehow I
		  managed to get a sense of some meaningfulness, and that's why earlier I said I
		  think, to me now, albums are perhaps a way of helping myself, but maybe helping
		  other people too. To work through my problems maybe will help other people too.
		  To work through my problems maybe will help other people to work through their
		  problems. Maybe the meaningfulness of art is that once you've got over your
		  selfish work within it, you can give it to other people and hopefully it might
		  at least make them smile or something. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So this is less from your imagination, which you've drawn on
		before, and more the real you? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think it's probably both, because I do think they're a lot of
		  imagination gone into the sounds of the album. It's very layered and
		  imaginative from a sound point of view, perhaps more than before, but then I'm
		  so subjective that I probably don't hear this the way other people do at all. I
		  guess maybe I haven't hidden away so much in the writing of this album, maybe
		  I've been a little more brave and maybe that's why it was harder for me to
		  write. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir89_r1.html">Roger

		<DD> I just felt that I was exploring my feminine energy more -

		  in art - but I think there <CITE>is</CITE> a difference: little things, like
		  using the Trio. And possibly some of the attitudes to my lyric writing on this
		  album. I would say it was more accepting of being a female somehow. (1990,

	 <P> <B> "<CITE>The sensual world</CITE>,'' the song, is some sort of

		  dealing with someone who knows what I'm trying to say, rather than three or

		  So I'm not sure there is female sound in contemporary music. There is in ethnic
		  music, though. Now the Bulgarian singers, that's very much female music, from a
		  strong female point of view. I think it has a tremendous intensity because of
		  that, and it's very unusual for us to hear that kind of positive female
		  strength, which you don't really find in contemporary music. (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Tell me a bit about your art on this album, ``<CITE>the sensual
		world</CITE>'' Especially fascinating is this mixing of the irish/bulgarian
		sound on it which is the most unlikely thing on paper but is an extraordinary
		noise. You have those irish musicians and you have these bulgarian singers on
		some tracks and together somehow it works. It's hard understanding where your
		was at when you actually decided to go this way. So you tell me. </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I know. It's worrying isn't it...! Well, the whole process of this
		  album is so ridiculous. It's extraordinary even when I think about it, let
		  alone try to explain to people the bizarre chain of associations and events
		  that have happened to actually create this album. On this first track it's
		  Irish musicians playing a Greek tune. Again because of the Joyc'ian influence
		  in the song, I wanted to use Irish musicians and we had this straight melody
		  that went through the choruses and it was very Irish. When we had all this
		  trouble with lyrics, I had to change them and we took a new approach. I
		  remember this piece of music from about three years ago that my brother Paddy
		  had played me - a fan had sent it in, and it was this beautiful piece of music
		  from Macedonia. It was just gorgeous, and I thought, well I don't know if it
		  will work, but let's try it and it worked and that's how it's in there. But
		  there's a lot of that - things that I heard maybe three years ago or a person's
		  name that I thought I should look up from three years ago. It's sort of all
		  been jigsawed together into this album and it is a very bizarre process. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But it works. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think it does. There was a lot of experimentation went on.
		  One of my biggest problems was just trying to convince myself that it was O.K.
		  to go ahead and do what I felt I should do and not to doubt it, just to go for
		  it. I actually thought about using the Bulgarians a good six months before I
		  actually got up the guts to then try approaching them, and go to Bulgaria, meet
		  them, work with them. It was a very scary thing for me to do because of the
		  responsibility if it hadn't worked. For a start, they are such incredible
		  musicians - their music is so good. If we worked together and it was awful I
		  would have had to ditch it, because their reputation goes higher than mine and
		  I would be carrying their on the record, so it really was a bit daunting for
		  me. If I had just been brave enough to go ahead with it in the first place I
		  could have saved six months of agony. </DD>

	 <P> <B> I hear you're fairly famous in bulgaria. Is this true? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well this is what they told me. I didn't know if they were just
		  being very nice to me or wanted to make me feel wanted but, yes, they said I
		  was. I found that surprising. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So who is this trio, because they are not a bunch of ``spring
		chickens'' are they? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, they are not. They are three of the greatest female singers in
		  Bulgaria and they have been singing together for twenty to thirty years. They
		  all come from different parts of Bulgaria, they all come from little villages
		  and they're very earthy people. They've all lived very full lives, and they
		  work so hard. I've never worked with such hard-working professional people, and
		  I've never worked with women before on that level either which I found
		  fabulous. It was very exciting for me working with women creatively. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That whole process was incredible because I was really scared, I
		  didn't know if it was going to work. We arrived in Bulgaria, and they didn't
		  speak a word of English, and we didn't speak a word of Bulgarian, and the
		  communication was really stunted to start with. Within 10 minutes they welcomed
		  us into their house, so affectionate, and they sat down and sang one of their
		  songs for us. It was a beautiful song, just the three of them sitting opposite
		  this kitchen table. The eldest one Eva picked up this telephone and listened to
		  the dialling tone and went [<I>Tone</I>], and they all took their note off the
		  dialling tone [<I>Laughs</I>]. And then they just burst into song and it was
		  the most beautiful thing. It's very rarely that I'm moved by music enough to
		  want to cry, and within minutes I was sitting there with tears running down my
		  cheeks. I think in some ways this was how we communicated, not that it was that
		  extreme all the time but it was very much emotional communication between us,
		  no words could be used really, and they loved the fact that we were so moved,
		  and working in the studio consisted of cuddles mainly rather than long
		  conversations [<I>Laughs</I>] and it was wonderful. A really special
		  experience, I wouldn't have missed it for the world, it definitely affected me
		  in a big way. I'm so honoured to have worked with them, really just so honoured
		  with them as people as well as musicians, because the music speaks for itself.
		  It's just so incredible to be with people like that. </DD>

	 <P> <B> What would be your choice for the song that would best demonstrate

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Most definitely ``_Rocket's<CITE>Tail</CITE>'' It shows the trio off

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Maybe that's because, for me, the album's about relationships - the

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> How interesting. Could you give me an example? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, in ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/love_and_anger.html">love and

		about it,'' as if language betrays your aims, and then you go on to say, ``we
		could be like two strings beating/speaking in sympathy,'' which suggests that
		music, rather than language, comes closest to expressing our emotions. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah! Actually, ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/love_and_anger.html"> Love
		  and Anger</A></CITE>'' was an incredibly difficult song for me to write and,
		  when people ask me what it's about, I have to say I don't know because it's not
		  really a thought-out thing. It was so difficult for me to write that: in some
		  ways, I think, about the process of writing the song: I can't find the words; I
		  don't know what to say. This thing of a big, blank page, you know: it's so
		  big...It's like it doesn't have edges around it, you could just start anywhere.

		<DD> Yes... um... I don't think I was consious of it, but it's something
		  I'm aware of when writing songs. [<I>Has ied missed something here, or did kate
		  just contradict the first half of this sentence in the second half? - ied</I>]
		  There's such a lot you need to say through words. And it's a beautiful thing,
		  language: actually being able to put words together and say something... maybe
		  say two things in one line. But, like you say, it misses the mark so often.
		  </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> You created your own language, too, don't you? It seems when you're
		at your most sexual, your most emotional, you emit...the only word I can find
		for it is noises, but that sounds too crude. Your ``mmh yes'' on ``<CITE>the
		sensual world</CITE>'' (the most heavenly sound ever on <CITE>top of the
		pops)</CITE> and your ``do-do-do-do-do'' in
		``<CITE>heads</CITE>we're<CITE>dancing</CITE>'' are like cries that language
		has deserted you or, more positively, an attempt on your behalf to merge words
		and music, to create a new emotional language from a combination of meaning and
		sound. [<I>I</I>] remembr you used to go ``wow!'' when words failed you. It
		shivers me. It's thrilling. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think that's a lovely thing to say... Yes, often words are
		  sounds for me. I get a sound and I throw it in a song and I can't turn it into
		  a word later because it's actually stated itself too strongly as a sound. Like,
		  in ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/love_and_anger.html"> Love and Anger,</A></CITE>''
		  the bit that goes <CITE>"Mmh, mmh, mmh"</CITE> was there instantly and, in
		  itself, it's really about not being able to express it differently. Do you know
		  what I mean? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Indeed I do. Liz of the cocteau twins does it all the time. She
		never sings a lyric as such, it's all noises. [<I>Actually this is not true.
		Fraser has admitted that she picks real words and names from dictionaries, but
		simply throws them together without a narrative foundation. -ied</I>] but
		somehow, the way you burst language, the tension that leads to the victory of
		sound over sense whips your music into another dimension. It's the frustration
		that gives your songs dynamic, and the way you remedy it that makes them
		attractive. Most of <CITE>the sensual world</CITE> lp seems to be saying,
		``this can be worked out.'' [<I>Ied does not agree. Fully half the songs on the

		<DD> You see, the thing is, I always want to do something different from
		  the last record, and in some ways it's a question of putting space before the
		  last project before you can even start. After the last album I just wanted to
		  spend some time and just come down to earth again. I suppose this record took
		  about two years in total to make; we took lots of breaks in between so the
		  project actually felt like it had been going on longer, even though it's not
		  been intense work. I found it very difficult to write some of the songs on the
		  album - some were very quick, but others were long and painful. I always find
		  lyrics very hard, anyway, and the whole thing was very much a layering process,
		  just sort of putting in all the different elements, putting the jigsaw
		  together. It's not by choice it took so long; it's never fun being involved in
		  a project that long, but I just couldn't do it any quicker. It's something that
		  happens in phases, where you get times when nothing's happening - and that's a
		  good time to take a break, or else you're continually working on lyrics and
		  stuff and you get a breakthrough. You might write a song and it comes very
		  quickly, and you've maybe got lyrics and melodies for, say, another two, so you
		  get musicians in and build on those tracks. Then you let them sit for a bit and
		  go off and do something else. I think it's useful that you do 10 or 11 tracks
		  on an album, so you can keep dotting round, so, even though you always end up
		  getting sick of hearing them, you can at least keep diverting. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Having the sort of creative freedom that I've now got, having my own

		  there's pressure to, working very closely with Del as engineer, I just felt
		  incredibly lucky to be in this kind of situation. It's a real privilege and I'd
		  hate to abuse that. I think the problem with writing songs is that you want to
		  care about what you're doing, and sometimes the stuff you come up with is just
		  so banal, you just have to really wipe through it. Get rid of all the shit, do
		  you know what I mean? [<I>Laughs</I>] <CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/hounds_of_love_album.html"> Hounds Of Love</A></CITE> was very
		  much the main step, 'cause that was the first time we had our own studio, and I
		  suppose the progression from that one to this is that we've upgraded the
		  equipment. Also, on the last album, I was working with lots of different
		  engineers who could only give me a certain amount of time, because they'd
		  block-booked to someone else, and because I work so experimentally, I didn't
		  want to block-book too far ahead or I wouldn't be ready for them. Working with
		  Del, I've managed to get a bit closer again to the whole process. You know, if
		  it's not working, then we can just go home. If I have an engineer in, it would
		  be difficult to have that freedom and also to feel relaxed; there's a lot of
		  time spent getting to know each other. (1989, <CITE><A
