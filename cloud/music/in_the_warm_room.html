		<DD> I'm always getting accused of being a feminist. Really I do write a
		  lot of my songs for men, actually. In fact, ``<CITE>In The Warm Room</CITE>''
		  is written for men because there are so many songs for women about wonderful
		  men that come up and chat you up when you're in the disco and I thought it
		  would be nice to write a song for men about this amazing female. And I think
		  that I am probably female- oriented with my songs because I'm a female and have
		  very female emotions but I do try to aim a lot of the
