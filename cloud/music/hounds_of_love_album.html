		<DD> The title comes from one of the songs, which is entitled
		  ``<CITE>Hounds of Love,</CITE>'' and this album for me is like two quite
		  separate pieces of work: the a-side and the b-side. The a-side is very much
		  five individual songs that are in some way all linked by
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> as a theme, and this seemed to be a
		  title which really did sum up that side. We actually gave a title to the b-side
		  of the album as well, but because you can't have two titles for an album, so we
		  just went for the a-side title to cover it all. (1985, <CITE><A

		  they're about relationships. They're all very different subject matters from

		<DD> Much more in the day with this album than the last. And I think that

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, well I think as soon as I decided to go for the concept, I sort
		  of said, ``Oh, let's be brave and go for it,'' then the energies, the
		  synchronicities, or whatever you want to call them, started coming into play
		  and nearly everyone I was working with was a water-sign! But I think, again, a
		  lot of people have commented already on how the album seems to them very
		  elemental - you know, full with the elements wind and rain. And I can't help
		  but put quite a lot of that down to the fact that I moved out into the country.
		  Instead of being boxed in by big houses, the <CITE>visual</CITE> stimulus
		  coming in was that of fields and trees and seeing the elements doing their

	 <P> <B> Certain of the new songs, like ``<CITE><A
		HREF="../music/and_dream_of_sheep.html"> and dream of sheep</A></CITE>'' and ``

		cinematic. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think in a way they're, umm, probably the most <CITE>visual</CITE>
		  songs I've written, in that when I was writing them, I had in mind what
		  potentially might be done with them, visually, which isn't normally the sort of
		  way you go about writing a song. So it'll be interesting if we can ever
		  actually turn it into a <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>, which is
		  what I'd like to do, and to see if it takes to it well. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Do you think in your writing you've gradually departed further and

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I don't know! I suppose I have in some ways. But particularly
		  rhythmically perhaps subconsciously I've moved more <CITE>towards</CITE> that.
		  I mean the constant rhythm with fewer breaks is more in evidence on the new
		  album: though the music is changing, the rhythm keeps on going, and in a way I
		  think that actually makes it a little more commercial. But I think trying to
		  tell the story musically is the biggest concern for me now, rather than...I
		  mean, obviously the structure of the song is always important, but in a way the
		  story tends to dictate that a little bit. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I suppose the songs on side one are more to formula: Verse, verse,

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, absolutely. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Del: I would say that, in fact, probably over the course of time

		</B></P>
	 <P> <B> Kate: <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">Recording</A>, yes, but,
		compositionally, more on the second side, <CITE>the ninth wave</CITE>. The
		songs on side one were written quite quickly. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> It seems to me that perhaps <CITE>hounds of love</CITE> doesn't
		cohere so organically in terms of texture and
		<A HREF="../subjects/emotion.html"> emotion</A> as did the dreaming and that,

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think the problem with Side Two, <CITE>The Ninth
		  Wave</CITE>, is that it is an overall concept, and ideally I would have liked
		  two sides of an album to develop it. But I wouldn't like to feel the album was
		  just lots of little cameos that have been put together but rather that the
		  album does flow. It's true, the first side is very much made up of separate
		  songs. But it's so interesting what you say, because so many people have just
		  the opposite reaction in that they found <CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/the_dreaming_album.html">The Dreaming</A></CITE> terribly
		  difficult, I just don't think they could understand it. That's fascinating,

		<DD> I don't feel that it is that much more obviously commercial. I mean,

		  possible with the best production to accompany it. And to make it different.
		  And I think what makes it more accessible for people is the consistency of
		  rhythm. I can't really see that much difference, apart from how different songs
		  are anyway from each other. </DD>

		<DD> Well, I write a song because it's what I like at the time. On the

		<DD> No, I wasn't. I think a very big influence was

		  the patterns that I could hear in my head and that I wanted, so it's sort of
		  through him that we started off with the rhythmic basis that was then built

		<DD> Many hours were spent on tiny vocal ideas that perhaps only last
		  half a minute. Many hours went on writing lyrics - one of the most difficult
		  parts in the process for me, in that it's so time-consuming and so frustrating,
		  and it just always seems to take far too long for something that seems as
		  though it should come so naturally. One of the difficult things about the
		  lyrics is that when I initially write the song, perhaps half of the lyrics come
		  with it but it's almost more difficult fitting in the other half to make it
		  match than it would be perhaps to start from scratch, where, for instance, you
		  might have just hummed the tune; or where, in some cases, I wrote them as
		  instrumentals, and then the tunes [<I>??? Perhaps she meant lyrics</I>] were
		  written over the top of this. Many times I ring up Paddy and ask him to come
		  over to the studio immediately, to bring in that string-driven thing - to hit

	 <P> <B> Alright. We were talking about the studio, right? And you're gonna

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah. One of the main reasons for wanting to build our own studio
		  was the amount of <A HREF="../subjects/money.html">money</A> that it was
		  costing in a commercial studio per hour. And when you work experimentally it
		  actually becomes prohibitive when it's costing that amount of money. Plus the
		  distractions. So you've gotta find a place, and you gotta get the best
		  equipment in there that you can that you can afford because [<I>Phone rings
		  loudly</I>] obviously it's very expensive stuff. [<I>Smiles</I>] (1985,

	 <P> <B> So, I mean, you have the studio and everything, and it was to help
		make it easier, but what about the subject matter. Do you feel that these songs
		are about different things than songs on your previous album? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think the last album was quite an intense album. I think it
		  was about <A HREF="../subjects/emotion.html">emotion</A> and there were a lot
		  of things that I wanted to say that I wasn't happy with. I was feeling mankind
		  to be cruel, negative. And I think I expressed that in a lot of the songs. For
		  this album there's a completely different energy. I moved from the city to the
		  country. I was surrounded by elemental forces which I really feel feature on
		  this album. And I was feeling really happy and positive, and considering
		  mankind to be much better than on the last album. So I think it... it's got a
		  more positive energy. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> That kinda weird that you say that, because especially on the first
		side all the songs are so pessimistic, these songs about people who just cannot
		communicate. </B></P>

		<DD> On this album? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Yes. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But I think it's actually finding a way for them to communicate, if
		  they can't. The positive side is that they find a way to, and if they don't
		  then there's the hope that they can. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Ok, so then ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/running_up_that_hill.html">
		running up that hill</A></CITE>'' is just the beginning of a whole cycle?
		</B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Long pause</I>] how do you mean? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Well, cause I mean that is like a really pessimistic thing. I mean,
		two people wanting to switch places like that. Saying ``if you could feel what
		I feel now, then what?" </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But why is it pessimistic though, why is it not positive to want to
		  experience what the other person feels? For me, it's a positive thing, it's
		  saying that they can get rid of the problems, or they want to, they care enough
		  about each other to want to do that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Ok, great. So on this side then... We got the optimist... What
		caused you to write lyrics though like ``you never understood me, you never
		really tried.'' is it some personal experience? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think everyone at some times feels misunderstood. But I can't
		  think of any song that I would say was truly autobiographical. There's
		  something of me in every song, in that I'm expressing something I'm hoping is
		  interesting. But I don't think they're truly autobiographical comments in any
		  way. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/iv85_m1.html">MTV</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> Controlled. [<I>Pensive</I>] I think it's probably more constant.

	 <P> <B> Just on the lighter side, it's a wonderful cover, the album cover.

		<DD> Yes, it's a very popular question! The two dogs are friends of ours.

		<DD> It becomes increasingly difficult for me to talk about the content
