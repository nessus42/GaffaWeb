	 <P> <B> There are other areas where you have specifically taken a taboo as

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, that was fascinating. It was based on the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A>, <CITE>The Innocents.</CITE> I saw it
		  years ago, when I was very young, and it scared me, and when films scare you as
		  a kid, I think they really <CITE>hang</CITE> there. It's a beautiful film,
		  quite extraordinary. This governess is supposed to look after these children, a
		  little boy and a girl, and they are actually possessed by the spirits of the
		  people who were in the house before. And they keep appearing to the children.
		  It's <CITE>really scary</CITE> - as scary on some levels as the idea of
		  <CITE>The Exorcist,</CITE> and <CITE>that</CITE> terrified me. The idea of this
		  young girl, speaking and behaving like she did was very disturbing, very
		  distorted. But I quite like that song. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But there are those who would say it was totally perverse. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I suppose they would. And actually, I don't think I could find a
		  younger man attractive, let alone a boy. But the whole idea of looking at a
		  little innocent boy and that distortion - I mean, it's absolutely terrifying,
		  isn't it? I thought it was ingenious, great, so weird and unnatural. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But the thing is, looking at it objectively, that's a song about
		paedophilia. The strange thing is that, written by a woman, that seems
		acceptable. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's very different from a woman's point of view, and I think that's
		  also what's so interesting about it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But did it occur to you that if that song had been written and sung
		by a man, there might have been a really huge outcry? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That's something I never thought about, but I suppose you're right.
		  But a man _didn't_ write it. I don't know, it's a bit hard to understand, but
		  it was the fascination of a very soft, gentle woman who wouldn't consider
		  herself perverse at all - in fact, she _wasn't,_ that's the thing. She
		  <CITE>thought</CITE> she was being a paediathingy - but in fact she wasn't, she
		  was truly picking up a real man's energy and not a kid's, because the child was
		  possessed. It's very different if it involves a man and a little girl - the man
		  is so powerful to start with. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I was thinking of it on a political level say how would feminists
		react, if <CITE>i</CITE> wrote that song?... </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, if you wrote that song, automatically it would have some weird
		  and dangerous connotations. Because you don't normally think - and this is very
		  heavy, this - when there are attractions to <A
		  HREF="../subjects/children.html"> children</A> from adults, you normally do
		  think of it as men to girls. It's just more spoken of. And I think you're into
		  very negative, dangerous areas that would make it something very unpleasant...

		  know if anyone's seen a <A HREF="../subjects/film.html"> film</A> called
		  <CITE>The Innocents</CITE>, it initially inspired it. It's an old British film,
		  a very haunting film about a governess who goes to stay and look after two
		  children, a young boy and a young girl. And unknown to her, they're both
		  possessed by the spirits that lived in the before, the gardener and a maid. And
		  particulary the boy is in a very, very heavy possession state, he has a.. like
		  a thirty two year old man inside him as a spirit. And the governess will go to
		  give him a little goodnight and he suddenly gives her a very big passionate
		  kiss. And the song is about the woman being incredibly torn, she doesn't what's
		  happening because there's this really sweet little boy that she loves
		  maternally and yet through his eyes there's coming this really wicked, lusty
		  man. And so she can't work out what's happening, she thinks she's going mad
		  when in fact there is this terribly evil force in such a young child that could
		  never have this experience through his own age. And so she's just freaking out
		  saying ``my God, what's happening." </DD>

		<DD> The thing that worries me is the way people have started
		  interpreting that song. They <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> the long
		  word - paedophilia. It's not about that at all. It's not the woman actually
		  fancying the young kid. It's the woman being attracted by a man inside the
		  child. It just worries me that there were some people catching on to the idea
		  of there being paedophilia, rather than just a distortion of a situation where
		  there's a perfectly normal, innocent boy with the spirit of a man inside, who's
		  extremely experienced and lusty. The woman can't cope with the distortion. She
		  can see that there's some energy in the child that is not normal, but she can't
		  place it. Yet she has a very pure maternal love for the child, and it's only
		  little things like when she goes to give him a kiss at night, that she realizes
		  there is a distortion, and it's really freaking her out. She doesn't fancy
		  little boys, she's got a normal, straight sexual life, yet this thing is
		  happening to her. I really like the distortedness of the situation. </DD>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I like the idea of making the musical and subject matter at odds.
		  Like in ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/army_dreamers.html">Army
		  Dreamers</A></CITE>'' the obvious thing is to write a slow, heavy song, but if
		  you do that it always becomes too obvious, less easy for people to accept. When
		  it is something so heavy, if you disguise it in a light tune or something
		  happy, it will be accepted, and then when it's actually realised it will
		  probably hit home a lot harder. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> Some people might think it's a song about...what's the word when
		  older women fancy little boys? Paedophilia? Well, it's not actually that, and
		  it would worry me if people mixed it up with that because that's exactly what
		  worries her so much. I find that distortion very fascinating and quite sad. And
		  <CITE>frightening.</CITE> The thought of someone old and evil being inside a
		  young and pure shell, it's freaky. (1980, Oct 10, <CITE><A

		<DD> Whenever I base something on a book or a

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> "<CITE>"The infant kiss</CITE>'' had to be done on a very intimate
		basis, it [<I>Had to???</I>] be a woman singing about her own fear, because it

		``she's really frightened; She's worried,'' you could never really tell what

		<DD> I'm not actually thinking of myself falling in

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's like when a tiny kid turns round and says to you ``You're a
		  bastard'' or ``Fuck off": it's instinctive to feel repulsed by it... that
		  experience into a different situation. Otherwise I'd be writing and singing
		  about situations I've never experienced, and in order to be convincing you have
		  to have a certain amount of knowledge and conviction. It's a strange mixture, I
		  know, but I rarely write purely personal songs from experience. (1980, Oct 10,

	 <P> <B> O.k., let's go on now to another song which sounds either

		<DD> Well this track, this is really a novelty thing for me. There was a

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Um, it's called ``<CITE>The Infant Kiss</CITE>.'' But it's a
		  remarkable <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A>, very spooky. It's a
		  Fifties English film, black-and-white, and it's about the possession of two
		  children who this governess goes to stay with. And the whole film is very
		  strange. She keeps seeing things, hearing things. And she can't really work out
		  if she's going mad or whether there is something very strange happening. And
		  although this is never actually sung in the film, the theme music is from the
		  film and it's sung by a lady called Ida Cameron. And she's got a beautiful
		  voice, she sounds just like a little girl, and it's very haunting. </DD>

	 <P> <B> From the <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> <CITE>the
