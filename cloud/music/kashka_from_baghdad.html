		  ``<CITE>Kashka From Baghdad</CITE>'' that actually came from a very strange
		  American Detective series that I caught a couple of years ago, and there was a
		  musical theme that they kept putting in. And they had an old house, in this
		  particular thing, and it was just a very moody, pretty awful serious thing. And
		  it just inspired the idea of this old house somewhere in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/canada.html"> Canada</A> or
		  <A HREF="../subjects/america.html"> America</A> with two people in it that
		  no-one knew anything about. And being a sorta small town, everybody wanted to
		  know what everybody what else was up to. And these particular people in this
		  house had a very private thing happening. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Paddy: It's called a strumento da porco, that's it's real name, or
		  at least the name that portoreas [<I>???</I>] gave it - he was a writer on
		  musical instruments in the seventeenth century. </DD>

		<DD> Paddy: Well we use it for a number with an islamic flavour to it
		  called ``<CITE>kashka from baghdad</CITE>'' And it sounds like a santour which
		  is traditional arabian instrument played with hammers, just slightly. (1979,
