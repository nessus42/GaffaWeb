		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, I seem to link on to mothers rather well. As I've grown up a
		  bit I've become very aware of observing my own mother trying to observe me.
		  It's fascinating. When I was a kid I never really thought about her, about how
		  she ticks. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But I can be more objective now and I find it fascinating about
		  mothers, that there's something in there, a kind of maternal passion which is
		  there all the time, even when they're talking about cheese sandwiches.
		  Sometimes it can be very possessive, sometimes it's very real. (1980, Oct 10,

		<DD> It's not actually directed at <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html">
		  Ireland</A>. It's included, but it's much more embracing the whole European
		  thing. That's why it says BFPO in the first chorus, to try and broaden it away
		  from Ireland. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> What about the irish accent? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The Irish accent was important because the treatment of the song is
		  very traditional, and the Irish would always use their songs to tell stories,
		  it's the traditional way. There's something about an Irish accent that's very
		  vulnerable, very poetic, and so by singing it in an Irish accent it comes
		  across in a different way. But the song was meant to cover areas like Germany,
		  especially with the kids that get killed in manoeuvres, not even in action. It
		  doesn't get brought out much, but it happens a lot. I'm not slagging off the
		  Army, it's just so sad that there are kids who have no O-levels and nothing to
		  do but become soldiers, and it's not really what they want. That's what
		  frightens me. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> It's the first song I've ever written in the studio. It's not
		  specifically about <A HREF="../subjects/ireland.html"> Ireland</A>, it's just
		  putting the case of a mother in these circumstances, how incredibly sad it is
		  for her. How she feels she should have been able to prevent it. If she'd bought
		  him a guitar when he asked for one. (1980, Oct 10, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, it is. Yes, indeed. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it is a waltz. It was based very much on traditional music, the

		  very acoustic. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> ...That must... Is that one of your favorites... To be the single?
		Yes, it is. It's hard to like tracks that you create because they seem so old
		so quickly and it almost becomes a sort of objective thing where you've just
		become very close to it, so you do like it. But it's very hard to actually say
		you like or you don't like your own music, it's a very strange thing because
		it's so personal. </B></P>

		<DD> It's wonderful. It is, it's really exciting because it's been so

		<DD> The song is about a mother who lost her son overseas. It doesn't
		  matter how he died, but he didn't die in action - it was an accident. I wanted
		  the mother to be a very simple woman who's obviously got a lot of work to do.
		  She's full of remorse, but he has to carry on, living in a dream. Most of us
		  live in a dream. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> From an artistic point of view, definitely ``<CITE>Army

		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A>. And it was very pleasing for me to
		  watch the ideas I'd thought of actually working beautifully. Watching it on the
		  screen. It really was a treat, that one. I think that's the first time ever
		  with anything I've done I can actually sit back and say ``I liked that'' That's
		  the only thing. Everything else I can sit there going ``Oh look at that, that's
		  out of place.'' So I'm very pleased with that one, artistically. (1980,
