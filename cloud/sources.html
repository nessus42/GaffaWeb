	 <H1> Part IV: Sources And Credits </H1> 
	 <P>This in no way should be considered a complete or recommended list of
		Kate Bush sources. What is listed here is sources that I have access to, and
		well as the sources I need, when known. Non-interview articles (reviews, etc)
		are not included. For a more complete list of Kate sources see back issues of
		Homeground fanzine.</P> 
	 <P> Where the interviews have also been reprinted in fanzines, books, or
		bootlegs, I have noted this after the name of the interview. Sometimes they
		don't give the original date and source, so I have included an Unknown section
		for articles where I don't know the original sources. Any further information
		would be appreciated. </P> 
	 <P> Sources are followed by the date of the source, then the name of the
		interviewer, then the name of the person who transcribed the source into
		computer form, then the name of any fan magazine or book where the article is
		reprinted. The most common transcribers are given abbreviations, IED for Andrew
		Marvick and RH for <A HREF="ron_hill.html">Ronald Hill</A>. </P> 
	 <H2>Books</H2> 
	 <P>Why aren't there lots of great Kate Bush books? Since, as far as I know,
		Kate has never been interviewed for a book, all of the quotes from these books
		are originally from other sources, and, where known, have been marked as such.
		</P> 
	 <P> KATE BUSH COMPLETE - Book containing the sheet music to all of Kate's
		songs up to 1986. Also contains separate lyrics, a great chronology, many
		photos, and a discography. Although it doesn't contain any interviews with
		Kate, it was invaluable to creating this document and is highly recommended,
		especially if you don't have access to all of Kate's lyrics. </P> 
	 <P> SH - Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop) - 1983.
		Intellectual (as opposed to intelligent) book about Kate's family history,
		story, and fans. For someone who rambles on about fan obsession he seems pretty
		obsessed himself - "So I turn Kate's glossy pages, crackling and soapy to the
		touch, paper which seems limp and heavy and wet with realism, as if her images
		were oozing and perspiring into my fascinated inspection" YEEEETCH!!!! </P> 
	 <P> TWS - Kate Bush - The Whole Story (1988). Despite appearances, not a
		sanctioned book, and certainly not the whole story. Positive, but contains
		numerous factual and publishing errors. For "The Whole Story" on this book, see
		HOMEGROUND numbers 33 and 34.</P> 
	 <P> AVD - Kate Bush - A Visual Documentary (1988). Perhaps the best liked,
		non-official book. </P> 
	 <P> LOVE - Kate Bush - With Love (1988). Reprints of Kate-related articles,
		interviews, and reviews, some positive, some negative. Interesting mainly to
		see how the music press has reacted to Kate over the years.</P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <H2>Fanzines</H2> 
	 <P>Kate has fan magazines all over the world. This is only a list of the
		fanzines I have access to and have used for source material. </P> 
	 <P> <A NAME="kbc"> KBC The Kate Bush Club. Indispensible. Contains articles
		by Kate and her family, as well as wonderful photos. I have tried to use quotes
		from here as often as possible, since these are presumably the closest to what
		Kate actually feels. Unfortunately, back issues are hard to find, and most of
		us have to be content with photo-copies. How about reprinting all of these in
		book form???</A></P> 
	 <P> I only have originals of issues 2,5,8,11,13,16,17,18,23 so if you have
		any originals you don't need, let me know! The source of all these in computer
		form was The Garden, so if you have Cloudbusting you have all the direct quotes
		from Kate from the Kate Bush Club. However, the originals have many features
		which make them very worthwhile to have, including those GREAT pictures
		(wooo....). </P> 
	 <P> The KBC and Homeground together sponsored the 1990 Kate Bush Convention
		on November 17, 1990. The questions were from the audience members and the
		transcription is from Andrew Marvick. </P> 
	 <P> This is a list of all the KBCs as of April 1991. This list first
		appeared in Cariad Kate. </P>

	 <P>Homeground. Excellent independent fanzine. Contains news, discussion,
		poetry, artwork, etc. I have from issues 31 up. An interview appeared in 1985,
		by Tony Myatt, trans. by IED. </P> 
	 <P> BREAKTHROUGH - I have access to issues 5, 6, and 7 and have transcribed
		several interviews reprinted in this fanzine. Issue 5 contained the Kate
		Connection interview by Abby Sheffield which may or may not have been
		originally from Breakthrough. </P> 
	 <P> SB - Still Breathing (formerly Breakthrough). Great Canadian fanzine
		that contains all the normal stuff. Also has lots of great reprints of
		interviews with Kate, which of course are credited here to the original
		sources. I have every issue since it became Still Breathing. </P> 
	 <P> CARIAD - Cariad Kate. Great Welsh fan magazine. Contains the usual
		stuff plus lots of great reprints of interviews. I have access to issues 1-13,
		except 5. Also contains a superb collection of interviews with Peter Swales
		with Kate, Paddy, and Del in issues 3-5. </P> 
	 <P> Reaching Out. I don't have any copies of this fanzine, but an interview
		reprinted in this fanzine was originally from the KFNX interview. A few quotes,
		however were not included in the KFNX transcription I have, so they have been
		credited to Reaching Out. </P>

	 <P>THE GARDEN - This is Andrew Marvick and Co's book of reprinted and

	 <P> Love-Hounds is the source of a rather unique interview conducted by the
		founder of Love-Hounds, Doug Allen, in 1985. The views expressed by Doug are
		not necessarily those of _Love-Hounds_ as a group. Doug has asked that a
		disclaimer be added, explaining that at the time of the interview he was
		"suffering from a severe hormonal imbalance, but that he's better now."

	 <H3>Missing Print Interviews</H3> 
	 <P>------------------------ THIS LIST IS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE,
		ESPECIALLY BEFORE 1984. Use this list if you are looking for Kate Bush
		articles, like in a library, use the "have" list if you are looking through
		Kate Bush articles. It is based on the Medialog in Homeground (which I only
		have back to 1983) as well as the bibliography, which only goes up to 1983.

	 <P> </P> 
	 <H2>Versions Of Cloudbusting</H2> 
	 <P>I am attempting to make Cloudbusting available in as many different
		computer versions as possible. I would appreciate it if you could get it
		through the Love-Hounds or other networks, and if you could spread it around as
		much as possible so that I don't have to make copies. </P> 
	 <P> [NOT ALL OF THESE VERSIONS ARE ACTUALLY DONE YET]</P> 
	 <P> PRINTED - I regret that I cannot normally make printed copies, due to
		the size and mailing expenses. Now is the time to buddy up to that computer
		nerd and have him print out one of the computer versions. </P> 
	 <P> Rather than using a standard three ring binder, you may want to
		consider using a three-ring binder from a photo album. These are normally quite
		nicer. I use one from Price Club (item #4923) and it works out nicely. Also
		photocopies (hopefully color) and other photos in between the pages help break
		up the text and make it look more like a "real" book. </P> 
	 <P> TEX - A version for the TEX program may become available on Love-
		Hounds. </P> 
	 <P> AMIGA - This is the main version as it is the computer I have. It
		features fully integrated sound and pictures. All files are compressed, but can
		be used without manually un-compressing them, and can be easily un-compressed
		to print nicely or to transfer to another format. </P> 
	 <P> TEXT - Just the text files, and separate GIF files. Takes up more disks
		since these are not compressed, but can be easily transferred to any computer.
		If you have the AMIGA version, you can create just the text. If you have the
		IBM version, you can create this simply be de- compressing the files. </P> 
	 <P> WORDPERFECT 4.2 - The master files, includes underlining, which the
		text versions doesn't. It is available on Love-Hounds in IBM WORDPERFECT 4.2
		format, which loads right into IBM WORDPERFECT 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, and any later
		versions. It can also be loaded into the Amiga and presumably other computer
		versions using the IMPORT command (CTRL- F5)</P> 
	 <P> POSTSCRIPT - A postscript version may become available on Love-
		Hounds.</P> 
	 <P> IBM - I may not ever make this version. This would be set up for use on
		two or three 3 inch 720k disks, but can be easily copied to larger storage
		drives or can fairly easily be copied down to 5 inch 360k disks. Includes
		integrated text, pictures, and sampled sound on ANY IBM compatible. </P> 
	 <P> MAC - I may not end up making this version. This version will either
		consist of separate text, picture, and sound files, or an integrated version
		using HYPERCARD 2.0. I can run and create MAC programs on my Amiga, but I don't
		have a disk drive so I cannot make copies of them, except through the modem.
		</P> 
	 <P> ATARI ST - Use the text version or WORDPERFECT version. </P> 
	 <P> OTHER COMPUTERS - Suggest you download the TEXT version, or WORDPERFECT
		version, if your computer has Wordperfect. </P> 
	 <H2>SUGGESTIONS, COMMENTS, CONTRIBUTIONS</H2> 
	 <P>I can be reached on Love-Hounds or at the address below. If you have any
		sources that you feel should be included you can send me a copy or just the
		individual quote and source and where you think it should go. Of course, if you
		already have them in computer form, that is preferred. Since this is being
		distributed mainly in computer form, there is no reason why there shouldn't be
		new editions when I get new quotes or to fix mistakes. I am sure there are many
		mistakes so please be kind to them. If you REALLY like this please DON'T be
		compelled to send money (though I accept gifts!) as I don't really want to
		profit off this as these are really Kate's words. </P>
