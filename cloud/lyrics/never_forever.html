<HR><H2><A NAME="1">Babooshka</A></H2>
<BR>She wanted to test her husband,
<BR>She new exactly what to do,
<BR>A pseudonym to fool him,
<BR>She couldn't have made a worse move.
<BR>She sent him scented letters,
<BR>And he recieved them with a strange delight,
<BR>Just like his wife.
<BR>But how she was before the tears,
<BR>And how she was before the years flew by,
<BR>And how she was when she was beautiful.
<BR>She signed the letter:

<P>Chorus
<BR>All yours, Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya

<P>She wanted to take it further,
<BR>So she arranged a place to go,
<BR>Too see if he,
<BR>Would fall for her incognito.
<BR> And when he laid eyes on her,
<BR> He got the feelings they had met before,
<BR>Uncanny how she
<BR>Reminds him of his little lady,
<BR>Capacity to give him all he needs,
<BR>Just like his wife before she freezed on him,
<BR>Just like his wife when she was beautiful,
<BR>He shouted, I'm...

<P>Chorus

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="2">Delius (Song of Summer)</A></H2>
Ooh, he's a moody Old Man,
<BR>Song of Summer, in his Hand,
<BR>Ooh, he a moody old Man.
<BR>In his Hand-
<BR>'Hmm'

<P>        To be sung of a Summer,
<BR>             Night on the Water,
<BR>             Ooh, on the water-
<BR>              'In B. Fenby'

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="3">Blow Away (for Bill)</A></H2>
         One of the band told me last night,
<BR>          That music is all that he's got in his life.
<BR>So where does it go?
<BR>Surely not with his soul.
<BR>Will all of his licks and his R & B Blow Away-
<BR> Blow Away, Blow Away.
<BR> Our engineer had a different idea.
<BR>From people who nearly died, but survived,
<BR>Feeling no fear, of leaving their bodies here,
<BR>And went to a room that was soon full of visitors-

<P>Chorus
<BR> Hello Minnie, Moony, Vicious, Vicious, Buddy Holly,
<BR>    Sandy Denny,
<BR>   Please don't Thump me, Don't bump me, Don't dump me back there.
<BR>     Please don't thump me, Don't bump me, I want to stay here.

<P>Put out the Light, then put out the light-
<BR>Vibes in the sky invite you to dine,
<BR>Dust to dust, Blow to Blow,
<BR>Bolan and Moony are heading the show tonight.

<P>Chorus

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="4">All We Ever Looked For</A></H2>
Just look at your Father and you'll see
<BR>How you took ater him,
<BR>Me, I'm just another, like my brothers,
<BR>Of my Mother's genes.

<P>All they ever wanted for you
<BR>Are the things they didn't do,
<BR>All they ever wanted - a little clue;
<BR>All they ever wanted - the Truth;
<BR>All they ever wanted - a little bit of you;
<BR>All they ever wanted, but they never did get.

<P>The whims that we're weeping for
<BR>Our parents would be beaten for.
<BR>Leave the breast and then the nest
<BR>And then regret you ever left.
<BR>All we're ever looking for is another open door,
<BR>All we ever look for - another womb;
<BR>All we ever look for - our own tomb;
<BR>All we ever look for - ooh, la lune;
<BR>All we ever look for - a little bit of you too;
<BR>All we ever look for, but we never do score.

<P>All we ever look for - a God;
<BR>All ewe ever look for - ooh, a drug;
<BR>All we ever look for - a great big hug;
<BR>All we ever look for - a little bit of you;
<BR>All we ever look for - a little bit of you too;
<BR>All we ever look for - but we never do score.

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="5">Egypt</A></H2>
Follow the Nile, Deep to much deeper,
<BR>The Pyramids sound lovely tonight.
<BR>The sands run red, in Lands of thee Pharoahs,
<BR>Their symmetry gets right inside me.
<BR>I cannot stop to confort them.
<BR>I'm busy chasing up my demon.
<BR>Oh,     I'm in love with Egypt.

<P>My Pussy Queen, knows all my secrets,
<BR>I'll never fall in love again.
<BR>I drift with Dunes.
<BR>I whisper of the tombs,
<BR>They offer me Egyptian Delights.
<BR>She's got me with that feline 'guise,
<BR>Got me in those Desert eyes,
<BR>Oh, I'm in love with Egypt.

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="6">The Wedding List</A></H2>
No, I'll never give the hunt up,
<BR>And I won't muck it up.
<BR>Somehow, this was it,   I knew,
<BR>Maybe fate wants you dead too,
<BR>We've come together in the very same room,
<BR>And I'm coming for you.
<BR>Did you think I'd ever let you,
<BR>get away with it, huh?
<BR>He swooned in a warm maroon.
<BR>There's gas in your barrel,
<BR>And I'm flooded with Doom.
<BR>You've made a wake of our honeymoon,
<BR>And I'm coming for you.

<P>Chorus
<BR>All of the headlines said "Passion Crime",
<BR>"Newly Weds, Groom Shot Dead, Mystery Man"
<BR>God help the bride.
<BR>She's a widow, all in Red, with his Red, still wet-
<BR>She said (But she sure put him on the Wedding List)
<BR>I'll put him on the Wedding List
<BR>I'll get him on the the Wedding List
<BR>I'll get him on and     I will not miss.

<P>Now as I'm coming for you-All I see is Rudi,
<BR>I die with him again and again,
<BR>And I'll feel good in my revenge,
<BR>I'll gonna fill your head with lead,
<BR>And I'm coming for you.
<BR>And when it's all over, you'll roll over,
<BR>The butt of my gun,
<BR>One in your belly and one for Rudi,
<BR>You got what you gave by the heel of my bootie,
<BR>Bang-Bang, out! Like an old cherootie,
<BR>And I'm coming for you.

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="7">Violin</A></H2>
Four strings across the bridge
<BR>Ready to carry me over,
<BR>Over the quavers, drunk in the bars,
<BR>Out of the realm of the orchestra,
<BR>Out of the realm of the orchestra,
<BR>Filling me up with the shivers,
<BR>Filling me up wtiith the shivers and quivers,
<BR>Filling me up with the shivers.

<P>Chorus
<BR>Get the Bow going, let it scream to me,
<BR>Violin, violin, violin.

<P>Paganini, up the chimney,
<BR>Lord of the Dance with Nero and old Nicky,
<BR>Whack the Devil
<BR>Into my fiddlestick,
<BR>Give me the Banshees for B.V.'s,
<BR>Give me the Banshees for B.V.'s,
<BR>Jigging along with the fiddle, ooh Johnny,
<BR>Jigging along with the fiddle dee-dee,
<BR>Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee.

<P>Chorus

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="8">The Infant Kiss</A></H2>
I say goodnight-night,
<BR>I tuck him in tight,
<BR>But things are not right-
<BR>What is this? an infant kiss,
<BR>That sends my body tingling,
<BR>I've never fallen for,
<BR>A little boy before,
<BR>No control,
<BR>Just a kid and just a school,
<BR>Back home they'd call me dirty,
<BR>His little hand is on my heart,
<BR>He's got me where it hurts me.
<BR>Knockn , knock, who's there in this baby?
<BR>You know how to work me.

<P>Chorus
<BR>And all my barriers are going,
<BR>It's starting to show.
<BR>Let go, let go.

<P>I cannot sit and let,
<BR>Something happen I'll regret,
<BR>Ooh, he scares me,
<BR>There's a man behind those eyes,
<BR>I catch him when I'm bending.
<BR>Ooh, how he frightens me.
<BR>When they whisper privately,
<BR>Windy-wailey, blows me,
<BR>Words of caress on their lips,
<BR>That speak of adult love.
<BR>I want to smack but     I hold back.
<BR>I only want to touch.
<BR>But I must astay and find a way, to stop before it gets too much.

<P>Chorus

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="9">Night Scented Stock</A></H2>
(Instrumental)

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="10">Army Dreamers</A></H2>
Our little Army Boy,
<BR>Is coming home from B.F.P.O.
<BR>I've a bunch of purple flowers
<BR>To decorate a mammy's hero.
<BR>Mourning in the aerodrome,
<BR>The weather warmer, he is colder,
<BR>Four men in uniform to carry home
<BR>My little soldier.

<P>Chorus
<BR>What could he do? Should have been a rock star.
<BR>But he didn't have the money for a guitar.
<BR>What could he do? Should have been a politician,
<BR>But he never had a proper education.
<BR>What could he do? Should have been a father,
<BR>But he didn't even make it to his twenties.
<BR>What a waste,
<BR>Army Dreamers.

<P>Tears o'er a tin box.
<BR>Oh Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know,
<BR>Like a chicken with a fox,
<BR>He cannot win the war with ego.
<BR>Give the kid the pick of pips,
<BR>And give him all your stripes and ribbons,
<BR>Now he's sitting in his hole,
<BR>He might as well have buttons and bows.

<P>Chorus
<BR>
<HR><H2><A NAME="11">Breathing</A></H2>
<BR>Outside gets inside, Through her skin,
<BR>I've been out before
<BR>But this time it's much safer in.
<BR>Last night, in the sky,
<BR>Such a bright light.
<BR>My radar send me danger
<BR>But my instincts tell me to
<BR>Keep Breathing

<P>Chorus
<BR>Breathing
<BR>Breathing my mother in,
<BR>Breathing, my beloved in,
<BR>Breathing, Breathing her nicotine, breathing
<BR>Breathing the fall out-in, out-in, out-in, out-in, out-in.

<P>We've lost our chance, we're the first and last,
<BR>After the blast,
<BR>Chips of Plutonium are twinkling in every lung.
<BR>I love my beloved.
<BR>All and everywhere,
<BR>Only the fools blew it,
<BR>You and me knew life itself is breathing.

<P>Chorus

<P>What are we going to do without
<BR>Ooh, please, let me breathe,
<BR>Quick, breath in deep,
<BR>Leave us something to breathe,
<BR>Ooh, Life is-
<BR>Breathing.
