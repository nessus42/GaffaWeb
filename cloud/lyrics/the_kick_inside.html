	 <H2><A NAME="1">Moving</A></H2> <BR> 
	 <P>Moving stranger, does it really matter? <BR>As long as you're not afraid
		to feel <BR>Touch me, hold me, how my open arms ache <BR>Try to fall for me
		</P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>How I'm moved, how you move me <BR>With your beauty's
		potency <BR>You give me life, please don't let me go <BR>You crush the lilly in
		my soul </P> 
	 <P>Moving liquid, yes, you are just water <BR>You flow around all that
		comes in your way <BR>Don't think it over, it always takes you over <BR>And
		sets your spirit dancing </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) </P> 
	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H2><A NAME="2">Saxophone Song</A></H2> 
	 <P>You'll find me in a Berlin bar <BR>In a corner, brooding <BR>You know
		that I go very quiet <BR>When I am listening to you <BR>There's something
		special indeed <BR>In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy <BR>There's
		something very real in how I feel, honey </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>It's in me, it's in me-and you know it's for real </P> 
	 <P>Tuning in your saxophone <BR>Doo-ba-doo-ba-doo </P> 
	 <P>The candle is burning over your shoulder <BR>Is throwing shadows on your
		saxophone <BR>A surly lady in tremor <BR>The stars that climb from her bowels
		<BR>Those stars make towers on vowels <BR>You'll never know that you had all of
		me <BR>You'll never see the poetry you've stirred in me <BR>Of all the stars
		I've seen that shine so brightly <BR>I've never known or felt, in myself, so
		rightly </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) </P> 
	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H2><A NAME="3">Strange Phenomena</A></H2> 
	 <P>Soon it will be the phase of the moon <BR>When people tune in <BR>Every
		girl knows about the punctual blues <BR>But who's to know the power <BR>Behind
		our moves </P> 
	 <P>A day of coincidence with the radio <BR>And a word that won't go away
		<BR>We know what they'r all going to say <BR>"G" arrives, funny, had a feeling
		he was on his way </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>We raise our hats to the strange phenomena <BR>Soul birds
		of a feather flock together <BR>We raise out hats to the hand a-moulding us
		<BR>Sure 'nuf-he has the answer <BR>He has the answer <BR>Om mani padme hum.
		</P> 
	 <P>You pick up a paper, you read a name <BR>You go out, it turns up again
		and again <BR>You bump into a friend you haven't seen <BR> For a long time
		<BR>Then into another you only thought about last night </P> 
	 <P>You hear your sister calling for you <BR>But you don't know where from
		<BR>You know there's something wrong <BR>But you don't want to believe in a
		premonition </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) </P> 
	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H2><A NAME="4">Kite</A></H2> 
	 <P>Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o <BR>My feet are heavy and I'm rooting
		in my wellios <BR>And I want to get away and go <BR>From all these mirror
		windows <BR>I look at eye level, it isn't good enough <BR>And then I find out,
		when I take a good look up <BR>There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball
		<BR>Calling me- </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>Come up and be a kite <BR>And fly a diamond night <BR>A
		diamond kite, a diamond kite <BR>Ooh, what a diamond! </P> 
	 <P>A diamond kite, on a diamond flight <BR>Over the lights, under the moon
		<BR>Over the lights, under the moon <BR>Over the moon, over the moon </P> 
	 <P>I feel a rush along my body like a bullet <BR>I'm 2D, after a push and
		pull feeling <BR>And I want to get back to safe home <BR>I love the homeland
		dome <BR>I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind <BR>Well I'm not sure
		if I want to be up here at all <BR>And I'd like to be back on the ground
		<BR>But I don't know how to get down </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) </P> 
	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H2><A NAME="5">The Man With the Child in his Eyes</A></H2> 
	 <P>I hear him before I go to sleep <BR>And focus on the day that's been
		<BR>I realise he's there when I turn the light off <BR>And turn over <BR>Nobody
		knows about my man <BR>They think he's lost on some horizon <BR>And suddenly I
		find myself <BR>Listening to a man I've never known before <BR>Telling me about
		the sea <BR>All his love, 'till eternity </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>Ooh, he's here again- <BR>The man with the child in his
		eyes </P> 
	 <P>He's very understanding <BR>And he's so aware of all my situations
		<BR>And when I stay up late <BR>He's always waiting <BR>But I feel him hesitate
		<BR>Oh, I'm so worried about my love <BR>They say "No, no, it won't last
		forever" <BR>And here I am again my girl <BR>Wondering what on earth I'm doing
		here <BR>Maybe he doesn't love me <BR>I just took a trip on my love for him
		</P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) </P> 
	 <P></P><HR> 
	 <H2><A NAME="6">Wuthering Heights</A></H2> 
	 <P>Out on the wiley, windy moors <BR>We'd roll and fall in green <BR>You
		had a temper, like my jealousy <BR>Too hot, too greedy <BR>How could you leave
		me? <BR>When I needed to possess you <BR>I hated you, I loved you too </P> 
	 <P>Bad dreams in the night <BR>They told me I was going to lose the fight
		<BR>Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering <BR>Wuthering Heights. </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home <BR>I'm so cold, let
		me in-a-your window </P> 
	 <P>Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely <BR>On the other side from you <BR>I
		pine alot, I find the lot <BR>Falls through without you <BR>I'm coming back
		love, cruel Heathcliff <BR>My only one dream, my only master </P> 
	 <P>Too long I roam in the night <BR>I'm coming back to his side to put it
		right <BR>I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering <BR>Wuthering Heights
		(Chorus) </P> 
	 <P>Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away <BR>Oh let me have it, let

	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>Remember Genie, from the casino <BR>She's still a-waiting
		in her big brass bed <BR>The boys from your gang are knocking whiskey back
		<BR>'Till they get out of hand <BR>And wish they were dead <BR>They're only
		lonely for the life they led <BR>With their old friend <BR>Ooh, James are you
		selling your soul to a cold gun? </P> 
	 <P>Where lies your heart? <BR>It's not there in the buckskin baby <BR>It's
		not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud </P> 
	 <P>You're a coward James <BR>Your running away from humanity <BR>You're
		running out on reality <BR>It won't be funny when they <BR>Rat-a-tat-tat you
		down </P>

	 <H2><A NAME="8">Feel It</A></H2> 
	 <P>After the party, you took me back to your parlour <BR>A little nervous
		laughter, locking the door <BR>My stockings fall on the floor, desperate for
		more <BR>Nobody else can share this <BR>Here comes one and one makes one
		<BR>The glorious union, well, it could be love <BR>Or it could be just lust but
		it will be fun <BR>It will be wonderful </P>

	 <H2><A NAME="9">Oh to Be in Love</A></H2> 
	 <P>As the light hits you, as you shift along the floor <BR>I find it hard
		to place my face <BR>How did I come to be here anyway? <BR>It's terribly vague,
		what's gone before </P> 
	 <P>I could have been anyone <BR>You could have been anyone's dream <BR>Why
		did you have to choose our moment? <BR>Why did you have to make me feel that?
		<BR>Why did you make it so unreal? </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>Oh to be in love, and never get out again <BR>Oh to be in
		love, and never get out again </P>

		boudoir <BR>But too soon, the morning has resumed </P> 
	 <P>(Chorus) <BR>I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon <BR>You look like an

	 <P>And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me <BR>L'amour looks
		something like you </P> 
	 <P>The thoughts of you sends me shivery <BR>I'm dressed in lace sailing
		down a black reverie <BR>My heart is thrown to the pebbles <BR>And the boatmen
		<BR>All the time I find I'm living in that evening <BR>With that feeling of
		sticky love inside </P>

	 <P>Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me <BR>They
		arrived at an inconvienient time <BR>I was hiding in a room in my mind <BR>They
		made me look at myself <BR>I saw it well, I'd shut the people out of my life
		<BR>So now I take the opportunities <BR>Wonderful teachers ready to teach me

		Gurdjieff and Jesu <BR>They build up my body <BR>Break me emotionally, it's
		nearly killing me <BR>But what a lovely feeling! <BR>I love the whirling of the
		Dervishes <BR>I love the beauty of rare innocence <BR>You don't need no crystal
		ball <BR>Don't fall for a magic wand <BR>We humans got it all, we perform the
		miracles </P>

	 <P>Hey there you lady in tears <BR>Do you think that they care if they're
