	 <H1><A NAME="0">Lionheart</A></H1>
	 <P>Author: Kate Bush <BR>Album title: Lionheart </P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="1">Symphony In Blue</A></H2>
	 <BR>
	 <P>I spent a lot of my time looking at blue, <BR>the colour of my room and
		my mood, <BR>Blue on the walls, Blue out of my mouth, <BR>The sort of blue
		between clouds when the sun comes <BR>out, <BR>The sort of blue in those eyes
		you get hung up about. </P>
	 <P>When that feeling of meaninglessness, sets in, <BR>Go blowing my mind on
		God. <BR>The light in the dark with the neon arms, <BR>The meek He seeks, the
		beast He calms, <BR>The head of the good soul Department. </P>
	 <P>Chorus I see myself suddenly on the piano, <BR> As a melody. <BR> My
		terrible fear of dying, no longer <BR> Plays with me. <BR> For now I know that
		I'm needed <BR> For the symphony. </P>
	 <P>I associate love with Red, <BR>The colour of my heart when she's dead,
		<BR>Red in my mind when the jealousy flies, <BR>Red in my eyes from the
		emotional ties. <BR>Manipulation, the danger signs. </P>
	 <P>The more I think about sex, <BR>The better it gets, <BR>Here we have a
		purpose in life. <BR>Good for the blood circulation, <BR>Good for releasing the
		tension, <BR>The root of our reincarnations. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="2">In Search Of Peter Pan</A></H2>
	 <P>It's been such a long week, <BR>So much crying. <BR>I no longer see a
		future. <BR>I've been told, when I get older <BR>That I'll understand it all,
		<BR>But I'm not sure if I want to. </P>
	 <P>Running into her arms, <BR>At the school gates <BR>She whispers that I'm
		a poor kid, <BR>And granny takes me on her knee, <BR>She tells me I'm too
		sensitive, <BR>She makes me sad. <BR>She makes me feel like and old man. </P>
	 <P>Chorus They took the game right out of it, <BR> They took the game right
		out of it. </P>
	 <P> When, When I am a man, <BR> I will be an astronaut, <BR> And find Peter
		Pan, <BR> Second Star on the right <BR> Straight on 'til morning. </P>
	 <P>Dennis loves to look in the mirror, <BR>He tells me that he is
		beautiful, <BR>So I look too, and what Do I see? <BR>My eyes are full, <BR>But
		my face is empty. <BR>He's got a photo, <BR>Of his hero, <BR>He keeps it under
		his pillow, <BR>But I've got a pin-up from a newspaper, <BR>Of Peter Pan. <BR>I
		found it in a locket, I hide it in my pocket. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P>When you wish upon a star, <BR>Makes no difference who you are. <BR>When
		you wish upon a star, <BR>Your dreams come true. </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="3">WOW</A></H2>
	 <P>We're all alone on the stage tonight, <BR>We've been told we're not
		afraid of you, <BR>We know all our lines so well, ah-ha, <BR>We've said them so
		many times, <BR>Time and time again, <BR>Line and line again. </P>
	 <P>Ooh yeah, you're amazing, <BR>We think you're incredible, <BR>You say
		we're fantastic, <BR>But stillwe don't head the bill, </P>
	 <P>Chorus WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, <BR> Unbeliecable. </P>
	 <P>When the actor reaches his death, <BR>You know it's not for real, he
		just golds his breath, <BR>But he always dives too soon, too fast to save
		himself, </P>
	 <P>He'll never make the screen, <BR>He'll never make "The Sweeney", <BR>Be
		that movie queen, <BR>He's too busy hitting the vaseline. </P>
	 <P>Ooh yeah you're amazing, <BR>We think you are really cool, <BR>We'd give
		you a part my love, <BR>But you'd have to play the fool. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="4">Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake</A></H2>
	 <P>Emma's come down, <BR>She's stopped the light shining out of <BR>her
		eyes. </P>
	 <P>Emma's been run out on, <BR>She's breaking down in so many places,
		<BR>Stuck in low gear, because of her fears, <BR>Of the skidding wheels,
		<BR>(The skid of her wheels she feels). <BR>Skidding wheels, <BR>(The skid of
		her wheels she feels). <BR>Spinning wheels, <BR>(Wheel-skidding feeling). </P>
	 <P>Chorus Her heart is there, <BR> But they've greased the road, <BR> Her
		heart is out there, <BR> But she's no control. </P>
	 <P> Oh come on, you've got to use your flow, <BR> You know what it's like,
		and you know <BR> you want to go, <BR> Don't drive too slowly. <BR> Don't put
		your blues where your shoes <BR> should be. <BR> Don't push your foot on the
		heartbrake. </P>
	 <P>She's losing that inner flame. <BR>It was burning bright but she's
		losing the <BR>fight fast, <BR>She's only herself to blame, <BR>Well take of
		yourself, and remember Georgie, <BR>But she's so "O.D.'d" on weeping <BR>She
		can hardly see, <BR>That she's dropping beads, <BR>(Red, red glass is bleeding)
		<BR>Dropping beads, <BR>(Red, red glass is bleeding) <BR>Dropping beads,
		<BR>(Red, red on the parquet). </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="5">Oh England My Lionheart</A></H2>
	 <P>Oh England My Lionheart, <BR>I'm in your garden fading fast in your arms
		<BR>The soldiers soften, the war is over <BR>The air-raid shelters are blooming
		clover, <BR>Flapping umbrellas fill the lanes <BR>My London Bridge in rain
		again <BR>Oh England My Lionheart <BR>Peter Pan steals the kids in Kensington
		Park <BR>You read me Shakespeare on the Rolling Thames, <BR>That old River Post
		that never, ever ends <BR>Our Thumping hearts hold the Ravens in, <BR>And keep
		the tower from tumbling </P>
	 <P>Chorus: <BR>Oh England My Lionheart <BR>I don't want to go </P>
	 <P>Oh England My Lionheart <BR>Dropped from my Black Spitfire to my funeral
		barge, <BR>Give me one kiss in the appleblossom, <BR>Give me one wish and I'd
		be wassailing <BR>In the orchard my English Rose, <BR>Or with my shepherd
		who'll bring me home </P>
	 <P>Chorus: </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="6">Fullhouse</A></H2>
	 <P>Driving back in her car, <BR>Watching the wipers squashing the leaves
		away. <BR>Suddenly there in the road, <BR>Is your old self trying to get out of
		the rain. </P>
	 <P>I am my enemy, <BR>Mowing me over, <BR>And towing the light away.
		<BR>Somehow it just seems to fit, <BR>With that old me trying to get back
		again. </P>
	 <P>Imagination sets in, <BR>Then all the voices begin, <BR>Telling you
		things that aren't happening <BR>(But they nig they nag, 'til they're under
		your skin.) </P>
	 <P>Chorus You've really got to. <BR> Remember yourself, <BR> You've got a
		fullhouse in your head tonight, <BR> Remember yourself, <BR> Stand back and see
		emotion getting you uptight. </P>
	 <P>My silly pride, <BR>Digging the knife in, <BR>She loves to come for her
		ride, <BR>Surely by now I should know, <BR>I can control my highs and my lows,
		<BR>Bu questioning all that I do, <BR>Examining every move, <BR>Trying to get
		back to the rudiments, <BR>(If they nig and they nag, I'll just put in the
		boot.) </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="7">In The Warm Room</A></H2>
	 <P>In the warm room, <BR>Her perfume reaches you, <BR>Eventually you'll
		fall for her, <BR>Down you'll go to where the mellow wallows. <BR>In the warm
		room, <BR>She'll touch you with your Mamma's hand, <BR>You'll long to kiss
		those red lips, <BR>But when you do, it'll feel like kicking a habit. </P>
	 <P>Chorus She'll tell you that she'll stay, <BR> So you'd better barricade
		the way out, <BR> She'll tell you she's true, <BR> She'll tell you she loves
		you. <BR> She's waiting in that warm room. </P>
	 <P>In the warm room, <BR>She prepared to go to bed, <BR>She'll let you
		watch her undress, <BR>Go places where your finger long to linger, <BR>In the
		warm room, <BR>You'll fall into her like a pillow, <BR>Her thighs are soft as
		marshallows, <BR>Say hello, to the soft mush of her hollows. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P>In the warm room, <BR>She's waiting in that warm room. </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="8">Kashka From Baghdad</A></H2>
	 <P>Kashka from Baghdad lives in sin they say, <BR>With another man, <BR>But
		no-one knows who. </P>
	 <P>Old friends never call there, <BR>Some wonder if life's inside at all,
		<BR>If there's life inside at all. <BR>But we know the lady who rents the room,
		<BR>She catches them calling a la lune. </P>
	 <P>Chorus At night they're seen, <BR> Laughing, loving, <BR> They know the
		way <BR> To be happy. </P>
	 <P>They never go for walks, <BR>Maybe it's because the moon's not bright
		enough, <BR>There's light in love you see. <BR>I watch their shadows, <BR>Tall
		and slim in the window opposite, <BR>I long to be with them. <BR>'Cos when all
		the alley-cats come out, <BR>You can hear music from Kashka's house. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="9">Coffee Homeground</A></H2>
	 <P>Down in the cellar, <BR>You're getting into making poison, <BR>You
		slipped some on the side, <BR>Into my glass of wine, <BR>And I don't want any
		coffee - homeground. </P>
	 <P>Offer me a chocolate, <BR>No thank you, spoil diet, know your game!
		<BR>But tell me just how come <BR>The smell of bitter almonds? <BR>It's a no-no
		to your coffee homeground. </P>
	 <P>Chorus Picture of Crippin, lipstick-smeared, <BR> Torn wallpaper, have
		the walls got ears <BR> here? </P>
	 <P> Well, you won't get me with your <BR> Belladonna - in the coffee. <BR>
		And you won't get with your arsenic, <BR> - in the pot of tea. <BR> And you
		won't get me in a hole to rot. <BR> (put me in a six foot plot). <BR> With your
		hemlock on the rocks. </P>
	 <P>Where are the plumbers, Who went a-missing <BR>here on Monday? <BR>There
		was a tall man, <BR>With his companion, <BR>And I bet you gave them coffee -
		homeground. <BR>Well, maybe you are lonely, <BR>And only want a little company,
		<BR>But keep your recipes for the rats to eat <BR>And may they rest in peace
		with coffee - <BR>homeground. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P></P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="10">Hammer Horror</A></H2>
	 <P>You stood in the Belltower, <BR>But now you're gone. <BR>So we knows all
		the sights <BR>Of Notre Dame? </P>
	 <P>They've got the stars for the gallant hearts, <BR>I'm the replacement
		for your part, <BR>But all I want to do it forget you friend. </P>
	 <P>Chorus Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, <BR> Won't leave me alone. <BR> The
		first time in my life, <BR> I keep the lights on, <BR> To ease my soul. <BR>
		Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, <BR> Won't leave it alone, <BR> I don't know -
		<BR> Is this the right thing to do? </P>
	 <P>Rehearsing in your things, <BR>I feel guilty <BR>And retracing all the
		scenes, <BR>Of your big hit, </P>
	 <P>Oh God, you needed the leading role, <BR>It wasn't me who made you go,
		though, <BR>Now all I want to do is forget you, friend. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
	 <P>Who calls me from the other side, <BR>Of the street? <BR>And who taps me
		on the shoulder? <BR>I turn around, but you're gone. <BR>I've got a hunch that
		you're following, <BR>To get your own back on me <BR>So all I want to do is
		forget you, friend. </P>
	 <P>Chorus </P>
