I still dream of Organon.
<BR>I wake up crying.
<BR>You're making rain
<BR>And you're just in reach
<BR>When you and sleep escape me

<P>You're like my yo-yo
<BR>That glowed in the dark

<P>What made it special
<BR>Made it dangerous
<BR>So I bury it and forget.

<P>Everytime it rains,
<BR>you're here in my head
<BR>Like the sun coming out -
<BR>Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen
<BR>And I don't know when
<BR>But just saying it could even make it happen.

<P>On top of the world
<BR>Looking over the edge
<BR>You could see them coming
<BR>You looked too small
<BR>In their big black car
<BR>To be a threat to the men in power.

<P>I hid my yo-yo in the garden

<P>I can't hide you from the government
<BR>Oh God, daddy - I won't forget

<P>Your son's coming out
