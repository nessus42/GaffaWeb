<HR><H2><A NAME="1">Sat in Your Lap</A></H2>
<BR>I see the people working and see it working for them,
<BR>And so I want to join in, but then I find it hurts me.
<BR>Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap
<BR>Some say that knowledge is something that you never have
<BR>I see the people happy, so can it happen for me?
<BR>'Cos when I have no energy, there's nothing that can move me
<BR>Some say that knowledge is something that you never have
<BR>Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap
<BR>Some say that heaven is hell, some say that hell is heaven.
<BR>I must admit, just when I think I'm king (I just begin)
<BR>Just when I think I'm king, I must admit (I just begin)
<BR>Just when I think I'm king
<BR>(I just begin)
<BR>I've been doing it for years, my goal is moving near
<BR>It says "Look I'm over here" then it up and disappears
<BR>Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap
<BR>Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho
<BR>I want to be a lawyer, I want to be a scholar
<BR>But I really can't be bothered, ooh just
<BR>Gimme it quick, gimme it, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
<BR>Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho
<BR>Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho
<BR>Some say that heaven is hell, some say that hell is heaven
<BR>I must admit, just when I think I'm king (I just begin)
<BR>Just when I think I'm king, I must admit (I just begin)
<BR>Just when I think everything's going great (I just begin)
<BR>Hey I get the break
<BR>Hey I'm gonna take it all (I just begin)
<BR>When I'm king (just begin)
<BR>In my dome of ivory, a home of activity
<BR>I want the answers quickly, but I don't have no energy
<BR>I hold a cup of wisdom, but there is nothing within
<BR>My cup she never overfloweth and 'tis I that moan and groaneth
<BR>Some grey and white matter (give me the Karma Mama
<BR>A jet to Mecca, Tibet or Jeddah
<BR>To Salisbury, a monastery
<BR>The longest journey, across the desert
<BR>Across the weather, across the elements
<BR>Across the water)

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="2">There Goes A Tenner</A></H2>
Okay remember, okay remember
<BR>That we have just allowed
<BR>Half an hour
<BR>To get in, do it and get out
<BR>The sense of adventure
<BR>Is changing to danger
<BR>The signal has been given
<BR>I go in
<BR>The crime begins

<P>My excitement
<BR>Turns into fright
<BR>All my words fade
<BR>What am I gonna say?
<BR>Mustn't give the game away

<P>We're waiting

<P>We got the job sussed
<BR>This shop's shut for business
<BR>The look-out has parked the car
<BR>But kept the engine running
<BR>Three beeps means trouble's coming
<BR>I hope you remember
<BR>To treat the gelignite tenderly for me
<BR>I'm having dreams about things
<BR>Not going right
<BR>Let's leave in plenty of time tonight

<P>Both my partners
<BR>Act like actors
<BR>You are Bogart
<BR>He is George Raft
<BR>That leave Cagney and me
<BR>(What about Edward G.?)

<P>We're waiting

<P>You blow the safe up
<BR>Then all I know is I wake up
<BR>Covered in rubble
<BR>One of the Rabble
<BR>Needs Mummy
<BR>The government will never find the money
<BR>I've been here all day
<BR>A star in strange ways
<BR>Apart from a photograph
<BR>They'll get nothing from me
<BR>Not until they let me see
<BR>My solicitor
<BR>Ooh I remember
<BR>That rich windy weather
<BR>When you would carry me
<BR>Pockets floating in the breeze
<BR>There goes a tenner
<BR>Hey look! there's a fiver
<BR>There's a ten shilling note
<BR>Remember them?
<BR>That's when we used to vote for him.

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="3">Pull Out the Pin</A></H2>
Just as we hit the green
<BR>I've never been so happy to be alive
<BR>Only seven miles behind
<BR>You could smell the child
<BR>The smell of the front line's survival
<BR>With my silver Buddha
<BR>and my silver bullet
<BR>(I pull the pin)

<P>You learn to ride the Earth
<BR>When you're living on your belly
<BR>And the enemy are city births
<BR>Who need radar?
<BR>We use scent
<BR>They stink of the west
<BR>Stink of sweat
<BR>Stink of cologne and baccy
<BR>And their Yankee hash
<BR>With my silver Buddha
<BR>and my silver bullet

<P>Just one thing in it
<BR>Me or him
<BR>And I love life

<P>Just one thing in it
<BR>Me or him
<BR>And I love life

<P>Just one thing in it
<BR>Me or him, and I love life
<BR>I love life
<BR>I love life

<P>I've seen the coat for me
<BR>I'll track him 'til he drops
<BR>Then I'll pop him one he won't see
<BR>He's big and pink and not like me
<BR>He sees no light
<BR>He sees no reason for the fighting
<BR>With my silver Buddha
<BR>and my silver bullet
<BR>(I pull the pin)

<P>I had not seen his face
<BR>'Til I'm only feet away
<BR>Unbeknown to my pray
<BR>I look in American eyes
<BR>I see little life
<BR>See little wife
<BR>He's striking violence up in me
<BR>With my silver Buddha
<BR>and my silver bullet

<P>Just one thing in it, me or him
<BR>And I love life
<BR>Just one thing in it, me or him
<BR>And I love life
<BR>Just one thing in it, me or him and I love life
<BR>I love life, I love life

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="4">Suspended in Gaffa</A></H2>
Out in the garden, there's half of a heaven
<BR>And we're only bluffing
<BR>We're not ones for busting through walls
<BR>But they've told us unless we can prove
<BR>That we're doing it
<BR>We can't have it all.

<P>He's gonna wangle a way to get out of it
<BR>She's an excuse
<BR>and a witness who'll talk when he's called
<BR>But they've told us
<BR>Unless we can prove that we're doing it
<BR>We can't have it all
<BR>We can't have it all

<P>CHORUS:
<BR>      Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
<BR>      It all goes slow-mo
<BR>      I don't know why I'm crying
<BR>      Am I suspended in Gaffa?
<BR>      Not until I'm ready for you
<BR>      Not until I'm ready for you
<BR>      Can I have it all?

<P>I try to get nearer
<BR>But as it gets clearer
<BR>There's something appears in the way
<BR>It's a plank in me eye
<BR>With a camel who's trying to get through it
<BR>Am I doing it?
<BR>Can I have it all now?
<BR>I pull out the plank
<BR>and say thank you for yanking me back
<BR>To the fact
<BR>That there's always something to distract
<BR>But sometimes it's hard
<BR>To know if I'm doing it right
<BR>Can I have it all?
<BR>Can I have it all now?
<BR>We can't have it all

<P>CHORUS

<P>I won't open boxes that I am not told to
<BR>I'm not a Pandora
<BR>I'm much more like
<BR>That girl in the mirror
<BR>Between you and me
<BR>She don't stand a chance of
<BR>Getting anywhere at all
<BR>Not anywhere at all
<BR>No, not a thing
<BR>She can't have it all.

<P>CHORUS

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="5">Leave It Open</A></H2>
With my ego in my gut
<BR>My babbling mouth would wash it up
<BR>     (But now I've started learning how)
<BR>          I keep it shut
<BR>My door was never locked
<BR>Until one day a trigger come - cocking
<BR>     (But now I've started learning how)
<BR>          I keep it shut
<BR>Wide eyes would clean and dust
<BR>Things that decay, things that rust
<BR>     (But now I've started learning how)
<BR>          I keep them shut
<BR>          I keep them shut

<P>CHORUS:   Harm is in us,
<BR>          Harm in us, but power to arm
<BR>          Harm is in us,
<BR>          Harm in us, but power to arm

<P>Narrow mind would persecute it,
<BR>Die a little to get to it
<BR>     (But now I've started learning how)
<BR>          I leave it open
<BR>I kept it in a cage
<BR>Watched it weeping, but I made it stay
<BR>     (But now I've started learning how)
<BR>          I leave it open
<BR>          I leave it open

<P>CHORUS:   Harm is in us,
<BR>          Harm in us, but power to arm
<BR>          Harm is in us,
<BR>          Harm in us, but power to arm
<BR>          Harm is in us
<BR>          Harm is in us
<BR>          Harm in you and me
<BR>          What you letting in?
<BR>          Tell me what you're letting in
<BR>          Say what we're gonna let in

<P>We let the weirdness in.

``Bang'' goes another Kanga
<BR>On the bonnet of the van
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)
<BR>Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree
<BR>'Til you near him on the motorway
<BR>The tree begin to breathe
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)

<P>Coming in with the golden light in the morning
<BR>Coming in with the golden light is the New Man
<BR>Coming in with the golden light in my dented van
<BR>        Woomera

<P>CHORUS:
<BR>        DRE - A - M - T - I - ME

<P>The civilised keep alive the territorial war
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)
<BR>Erase the race that claim the place
<BR>And say we dig for Ore
<BR>Or dangle Devils in a bottle
<BR>And push them from the Pull Of The Bush
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)
<BR>You find them in the road
<BR>(See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand)
<BR>In the road

<P>Coming in with the golden light - in the morning
<BR>Coming in with the golden light - with no warning
<BR>Coming in with the golden light - we bring in the rigging
<BR>        Dig, dig, dig away

<P>CHORUS

<P>M-M-Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)
<BR>You near him on the motorway, the tree begin to breathe
<BR>Erase the race that claim the place and say we dig for Ore
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)
<BR>Dangle Devils in a bottle and push them from the Pull Of The Bush
<BR>(See the sun set in the hand of the man)
<BR>``Bang'' goes another Kanga on the bonnet of the van
<BR>(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)
<BR>You find them in the road
<BR>In the road
<BR>(See the light)
<BR>Pull of the Bush
<BR>(See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand)
<BR>Push them from the - Pull of the Bush
<BR>See the sun set in the hand of the man

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="7">Night of the Swallow</A></H2>
The night doesn't like it
<BR>Looks just like your face
<BR>On the moon, to me
<BR>And I won't let you do
<BR>What you want to do
<BR>It's funny how, even now
<BR>You're laughing
<BR>I won't let you do it

<P>If you go, I'll let the law know
<BR>And they'll head you off when you touch the ground
<BR>Ooh please,
<BR>Don't go through with this
<BR>I don't like the sound of it
<BR>It's funny how, even now
<BR>You're miles away
<BR>I won't let you do it
<BR>I won't let you do it
<BR>I won't let you go through with it

<P>Meet them over at Dover
<BR>I'll just pilot the motor
<BR>Take them over the water

<P>CHORUS: With a hired plane
<BR>        And no names mentioned
<BR>        Tonight's the night of the flight
<BR>        Before you know
<BR>        I'll be over the water like a swallow
<BR>        There's no risk
<BR>        I'll whisk them up
<BR>        In no moonlight
<BR>        And though pigs can fly
<BR>        They'll never find us
<BR>        Posing as the night
<BR>        And I'm home before the morning

<P>In Malta, catch a swallow
<BR>For all of the guilty to set them free
<BR>Wings fill the window
<BR>And they beat and bleed
<BR>They hold the sky
<BR>On the other side
<BR>Of border lines
<BR>I won't let you do it
<BR>I won't let you do it
<BR>I won't let you go through with it

<P>Meet them over at Dover
<BR>I'll just pilot the motor
<BR>Take them over the water
<BR>Like a swallow flying to Malta

<P>CHORUS

<P>Give me a break
<BR>Ooh let me try
<BR>Give me something to show
<BR>For my miserable life
<BR>Give me something to take
<BR>Would you break even my wings
<BR>Just like a swallow
<BR>Let me, let me go

<P>But you're not a swallow

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="8">All the Love</A></H2>
The first time I died
<BR>Was in the arms of good friends of mine
<BR>They kiss me with tears
<BR>They hadn't been near me for years
<BR>Say why do it now
<BR>When I won't be around, I'm going out?

<P>``We needed you to love us too, we wait for your move''

<P>Only tragedy allows the release
<BR>Of love and grief never normally seen
<BR>I didn't want to let them see me weep
<BR>I didn't want to let them see me week
<BR>But I know I have shown
<BR>That I stand at the gates alone

<P>``I needed you to love me too, I wait for your move''

<P>CHORUS:
<BR>    All the love, all the love, all the love we could have given
<BR>    All the love, all the love, all the love you should have given
<BR>    All the love, all the love, all the love

<P>The next time I dedicate my life's work
<BR>To the friends I make
<BR>I give them what they want to hear
<BR>They think I'm up to something weird
<BR>And up rears the head of fear in me
<BR>So now when they ring, I get my machine to let them in

<P>``I needed you to love me too, I wait for your move''

<P>CHORUS

<P>``We needed you to love us too, we wait for your move''

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="9">Houdini</A></H2>
I wait at the table and hold hands with weeping strangers
<BR>Wait for you to join the group
<BR>The tambourine jingle-jangles
<BR>The medium
<BR>       Roams and rambles
<BR>Not taken in,
<BR>       I break the circle
<BR>I want this man to go away now

<P>With a kiss, I'd pass the key
<BR>And feel your tongue
<BR>Teasing and receiving
<BR>With your spit still on my lip -- you hit the water

<P>Him and I in the room
<BR>To prove you are with us too
<BR>He's using code that only you and I know
<BR>This is no trick of his
<BR>This is your magic
<BR>I'd catch the queues watching you
<BR>Hoping you'd do something wrong
<BR>Everybody thinks you'll never make it
<BR>But every time you escape
<BR>Rosabel believe, not even Eternity
<BR>Can hold Houdini
<BR>       Rosabel, believe

<P>Through the glass, I'd watch you breathe
<BR>Bound and drowned
<BR>And paler than you've ever been
<BR>With you life the only thing in my mind
<BR>We pull you from the water
<BR>       Houdini

<P>You and I and Rosabel believe

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="10">Get Out of My House</A></H2>
When you left the door was (slamming)
<BR>You paused in the doorway
<BR>As though a thought stole you away
<BR>I watched the world pull you away
<BR>(lock it)
<BR>So I run into the hall
<BR>(lock it)
<BR>Into the corridor
<BR>There's a door in the house (slamming)
<BR>I hear the lift descending
<BR>I hear it hit the landing
<BR>See the hackles on the cat, standing
<BR>With my key I (lock it)
<BR>With my key I (lock it up)
<BR>With my key I (lock it)
<BR>With my key I (lock it up)

<P>I am the concierge, chez-moi, honey
<BR>Won't letcha in for love or money
<BR>My home, my joy
<BR>I'm barred and bolted, and I
<BR>      Won't letcha in

<P>CHORUS:
<BR>   (Get out of my house)
<BR>   No stranger's feet
<BR>   Will enter me
<BR>   I wash the panes
<BR>   I clean the stains away

<P>This house is as old as I am
<BR>This house knows all I have done
<BR>They come with their weather hanging around them
<BR>But can't knock my door down
<BR>With my key I (lock it)
<BR>With my key I (lock it)
<BR>This house is full of m-m-my mess
<BR>This house is full of m-m-mistakes
<BR>This house is full of m-m-madness
<BR>This house is full of, full of, full of fight
<BR>With my keeper I (clean up)
<BR>With my keeper I (clean it all up)
<BR>With my keeper I (clean up)
<BR>With my keeper I (clean it all up)

<P>I am the concierge, chez-moi, honey
<BR>Won't letcha in for love or money
<BR>My home, my joy, I'm barred and bolted and I
<BR>      Won't letcha in

<P>CHORUS

<P>Man: Woman, let me in
<BR>     Let me bring in the memories
<BR>     Woman, let me in
<BR>     Let me bring in the Devil Dreams

<P>Woman: I will not let you in
<BR>       Don't you bring back the reveries
<BR>       I turn into a bird
<BR>       Carry further than the word is heard

<P>Man: Woman, let me in
<BR>     I turn into the wind
<BR>     I blow you a cold kiss
<BR>     Stronger than the song's hit

<P>Woman: I will not let you in
<BR>       I face towards the wind
<BR>       I change into the mule
<BR>       "Hee-haw"

<P>Both: "Hee-haw"
<BR>      "Hee-haw"...
