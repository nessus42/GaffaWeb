<P><HR><H2><A NAME="14">Hounds Of Love</A></H2>
When I was a child
<BR>Running in the night
<BR>Afraid of what might be
<BR>Hiding in the dark
<BR>Hiding in the street
<BR>And of what was following me
<BR>Now hounds of love are hunting
<BR>I've always been a coward
<BR>And I don't know what's good for me
<BR>Here I go
<BR>It's coming for me thro' the trees
<BR>Help me someone, help me please
<BR>Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake.
<BR>And I'll be 2 steps on the water.
<BR>I found a fox caught by dogs
<BR>He let me take him in my hands
<BR>His little heart beats so fast
<BR>And I'm ashamed of running away,
<BR>From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
<BR>But I'm still afraid to be there,
<BR>Among your hounds of love.
<BR>And feel yours arms surround me
<BR>I've always been a coward
<BR>And never know what's good for me.
<BR>Here I go - Don't let me go - Hold me down
<BR>It's coming for me through the trees
<BR>Help me darling, help me please
<BR>Take my shores off and throw them in the lake
<BR>And I'll be two steps on the water
<BR>I don't know what's good for me,
<BR>I don't know what's good for me,
<BR>I need love, love, love, love, yeah -
<BR>your love.
<BR>Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake,
<BR>Do you know what I really need
<BR>Do you know what I really need
<BR>I need love, love, love, love.....

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="15">The Big Sky</A></H2>
They look down at the ground, missing.
<BR>But I never go in now -
<BR>I'm looking at the Big Sky,
<BR>I'm looking at the Big Sky now,
<BR>I'm looking at the Big Sky
<BR>You never understood me,
<BR>You never really tried.

<P>That cloud, that cloud - looks like Ireland,
<BR>C'mon and blow it a kiss now.
<BR>But quick 'coz it's changing in the Big Sky
<BR>It's changing in the Big Sky now.
<BR>We're looking at the Big Sky.
<BR>You never understood me
<BR>You never really tried.

<P>This cloud, this cloud says "noah,
<BR>c'mon and build me an ark"
<BR>And if you're coming - jump
<BR>'coz we're leaving with the Big Sky
<BR>And we pause for the jets
<BR>hup, hup in the Big Sky
<BR>You want my reply?
<BR>What was the question?
<BR>I was looking at the Big Sky.

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="16">Mother Stands For Comfort</A></H2>
She knows that I've beeing doing something wrong
<BR>But she won't say anything.
<BR>She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday
<BR>But she won't mind me lying
<BR>Mmh because: -

<P>CHORUS

<P>Mother stands for comfort
<BR>Mother will hide the murderer.

<P>It breaks the cage, dear escapes and takes possession
<BR>Just like a crowd rioting inside -
<BR>Make me do this, make me do that, make me do this,
<BR>Make me do that -
<BR>Am I the cat that takes the bird?
<BR>To her the hunted, not the hunter.

<P>CHORUS
<BR>Mother stands for comfort
<BR>Mother will hide the murderer.
<BR>Mother hides the madman
<BR>Mother will stay Mum

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="17">Cloudbusting</A></H2>
I still dream of Organon.
<BR>I wake up crying.
<BR>You're making rain
<BR>And you're just in reach
<BR>When you and sleep escape me

<P>You're like my yo-yo
<BR>That glowed in the dark

<P>What made it special
<BR>Made it dangerous
<BR>So I bury it and forget.

<P>Everytime it rains,
<BR>you're here in my head
<BR>Like the sun coming out -
<BR>Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen
<BR>And I don't know when
<BR>But just saying it could even make it happen.

<P>On top of the world
<BR>Looking over the edge
<BR>You could see them coming
<BR>You looked too small
<BR>In their big black car
<BR>To be a threat to the men in power.

<P>I hid my yo-yo in the garden

<P>I can't hide you from the government
<BR>Oh God, daddy - I won't forget

<P>Your son's coming out

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="18">And Dream Of Sheep</A></H2>
Little lights shining
<BR>Little lights will guide them to me
<BR>My face is all lit up
<BR>My face is all lit up
<BR>If they find me racing white horses -
<BR>They'll not take me for a buoy.

<P>Let me be weak, let me sleep and dream of sheep.

<P>Oh I'll wake up to any sound of engines
<BR>Every gull a seeking craft
<BR>I can't keep my eyes open -
<BR>Wish I had my radio

<P>I'd tune into some friendly voices.
<BR>Talking 'bout stupid things
<BR>I can't be left to my imagination
<BR>Let me be weak, let me sleep and dream of sheep -

<P>Ooh, their breath is warm,
<BR>And they smell like sleep
<BR>And they say they take me home -
<BR>Like poppies, heavy with seed -
<BR>They take me deeper and deeper

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="19">Under Ice</A></H2>
It's wonderful
<BR>Everything, so white.
<BR>The river has frozen over
<BR>Not a soul on the ice,
<BR>Only me, skating fast.
<BR>I'm speeding past trees leaving
<BR>Little lines in the ice,
<BR>Cutting out little lines,
<BR>In the ice, splitting, splitting sound,
<BR>Silver heels spitting, spitting snow
<BR>There's something moving under
<BR>Under the ice,
<BR>Moving under ice - through water
<BR>Trying to get out of the cold water
<BR>"It's me"
<BR>Something, someone - help them
<BR>"It's me".

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="20">Waking The Witch</A></H2>
"You won't burn
<BR>You won't bleed
<BR>Confess to me - Go Down"

<P>"Poor little thing
<BR>The blackbird,
<BR>Wings in the water - go down".

<P>"What is it, child?"
<BR>Bless me father, blass me father for I have sinned....
<BR>"I question your innocence"
<BR>(Help this blackbird, there's a stone around my leg)
<BR>"She's a witch"
<BR>(Help this blackbird, there's a stone around my leg)
<BR>"Uh, Damn you woman!"
<BR>(Help this blackbird, there's a stone around my leg)
<BR>"What say you good people?"
<BR>(Guilty, Guilty, Guilty).
<BR>"I am responsible for your actions"
<BR>"Wake the witch".

<P><HR><H2><A NAME="21">Watching You Without Me</A></H2>
You can't hear me
<BR>You can't hear me
<BR>You can't hear what I'm saying
<BR>You can't hear what I'm saying to you.

<P>You watch the clock
<BR>Move the slow hand
<BR>I should have been home
<BR>Hours ago - but I'm not here,
<BR>but I'm not here,
<BR>You can't hear me
<BR>You can't hear me
<BR>You can't feel me
<BR>Here in the room with you now,
<BR>You can't hear what I am saying,
<BR>You don't hear what I am saying do you.

<P>Can't let you know
<BR>What's been happening
<BR>There's a ghost in our home
<BR>Just watching you without me
<BR>I'm not here, but I'm not here, but I'm not here.
<BR>You can't hear me, you can't hear what I'm saying
<BR>You didn't hear me come in
<BR>You won't hear me leaving.

Hello Earth
<BR>Hello Earth
<BR>With just one hand help up high
<BR>I can blot you out,
<BR>Out of sight
<BR>Peek-a-boo,
<BR>Peek-a-boo, Little Earth.
<BR>With just my heart and my mind
<BR>I can be driving,
<BR>Driving home
<BR>And you asleep on the seat.

<P>I get out of my car,
<BR>Step into the night,
<BR>And lo
