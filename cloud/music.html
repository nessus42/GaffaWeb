	 <H1> Part I: The Music </H1> 
	 <P>This section is organized chronologically by order of release. Where a
		song is included on both an album and a single the quotes are listed under the
		entry for the album. Each album entry is followed by Kate's comments about the
		album in general. Following that are the entries for each song. Note that I
		have not in cluded lyrics, credits, catalog numbers, Non-British releases, EPs,
		or informati on on picture disks. Those interested in that information are
		directed to the music book <CITE>Kate Bush Complete</CITE> or The Garden. It is
		highly recommend ed that you read the lyrics to Kate's songs along with this
		Part and that you al so look at the credits, since Kate often talks about the
		musicians she works with. Also note that I have not included information on
		non-official releases.</P> 
	 <P> Of course there is much overlap between this and <A
		HREF="story.html"><CITE>Part II - The Story</CITE></A>, and Kate's music and
		life are so inter-related. In general, all the quotes about the meaning of the
		songs, albums, and <A HREF="subjects/videos.html">videos</A> are included here,
		as well as quotes on the making of the songs, albums, and videos. Part II has
		the quotes on the live and <A HREF="subjects/television.html">television</A>
		performances, chart positions, and quotes given before an album is
		finished.</P> 
	 <P> Each song entry is generally ordered to focus first on the meaning and
		inspiration for the lyrics of the song, then on the music itself, and then on
		the video (if any).</P>

		<DD> ``It means a lot to me if people are interpreting the music in the
		  way that I originally wanted it to be done. But, I do feel that music is a bit
		  like a painting, in that when you buy a painting, it's because you like it. And
		  what is important is your interpretation of what it means. That's why it means
		  so much to you. I think that applies to records as well. 
		  <P> But, as long as people are getting enjoyment out of them, I don't
			 think it matters to me. It doesn't worry me if they don't understand the way
			 that I'd hoped they would. But of course it's always nice if they do.'' </P>
