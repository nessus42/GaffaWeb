		<DD> I live alone - in southeast London - and today I don't get up until
		  late: perhaps one or two p.m. A friend of mine from the Hare Krishna temple
		  rang me up about eight-thirty, but I was too tired to natter much. About three
		  o'clock I go over to my parents' - they live twenty minutes' drive away, in
		  Kent. I'm doing a TV show in Germany on Tuesday [<I>The programme was
		  <CITE>rockpop,</CITE> and the taping was in mid-september, 1980</I>] and my
		  Mum's got some clothes to lend me. I'm going to do two numbers for the show.
		  ``Army Dreamers'' is one, and I want to dress up as a cleaning woman. My mother
		  lends me a headscarf, an old apron, and lots of my old jumble clothes. The song
		  is about a mother who lost her son overseas. It doesn't matter how he died, but
		  he didn't die in action - it was an accident. I wanted the mother to be a very
		  simple woman who's obviously got a lot of work to do. She's full of remorse,
		  but he has to carry on, living in a dream. Most of us live in a dream. </DD>

		<DD> I stay round my parents for a few hours - after all, you can't just
		  go round, take all the clothes you want and rush off - drink lots of tea and
		  eat chocolate eclairs and sandwiches, the sort of things that mothers like to
		  fill you up with. I feel absolutely delightful after that, and I go back to
		  start work on my routines for Tuesday. </DD>

		<DD> What I do is have a little cassette machine with the mixes I'm going
		  to work on, and I go into my back room where I have four mirrors propped up
		  against the wall, and I rehearse in front of them. It's all very well to work
		  out the routine for `` Army Dreamers,'' but the two dancers I work with
		  [<I>Stewart avon-arnold and gary hurst</I>] are busy - one's in
		  <CITE>Godspell</CITE> and one's in France. So I needed people who would be able
		  to perform. Paddy, my brother, he does pretty well. And the guys from the band,
		  who are natural performers anyway. I am pretty wiped out still, and I don't get
		  as much done as I could have. After working out for a while I don't feel too
		  good, so I have a bath and try some more. I work out for two or three hours,
		  then cook a meal for myself. </DD>

		<DD> I'm not a bad cook. I love making bread. It's such a wonderful thing
		  to do. So I watch the telly - the late-night movie: guys having their eyes
		  pulled out, or something really awful. Paddy has come back by now, so we have a
		  long chat and I get to bed about three o'clock. [<I>Apparently kate was still
		  sharing the family's lewisham building of flats with her two brothers. She has
		  since moved to a house of her own, situated nearer her parents's home in kent,
		  and she uses a third building as a private dance studio. - ied</I>] </DD>
