	 <P><B> Del [<I>Palmer, kate's demos engineer, mixer, bass player and
		boyfriend</I>], you played bass in the original k.t. Bush band. The guitarist
		brian bath was once telling me how one day in the mid-70s, paddy asked him to
		sit in and play with his kid sister and he was so overwhelmed, he just couldn't
		believe what he was hearing... </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Del: Yeah, and he wasn't the only one. I'd heard about kate from
		paddy 'cause I'd known him for some time. And brian had told me he'd heard some
		of her songs and they were really great, and I trusted his opinion. But I just
		had this impression that she must be older and more mature. Then at our first
		rehearsal - kate, brian and me, and a fellow called vic king on drums - I felt
		a little nervous because, you know, I felt a particular emotional involvement
		coming on right from the word go. But I also just thought: This girl's like
		just eighteen, whereas I'd been struggling for years on my bass. And I knew I
		just had to get involved some way because this was going to be
		<CITE>mega.</CITE> it was a <CITE>phenomenon</CITE> because it was so
		completely different from what anyone else was doing. And I've never had any
		desire to work with anyone else since. It wouldn't be anywhere near so
		adventurous and demanding. It's no good you sitting there laughing, kate, it's
		true! The songs always started off in a way I found instantly... Well,
		familiar. But then suddenly they'd leap off somewhere completely different, and
		I'd think, how could you possible <CITE>think</CITE> of going to
		<CITE>there</CITE> from what you were in originally? I would never have thought
		of doing that, and yet it always works! And that's the case even moreso
		nowadays. For me, a great musical artist is someone who can always keep
		surprising you with what they do, and there's very few people who can do that
		for me, very few. I've got very limited musical tastes... </B></P>
	 <P> <B> When you first met kate, was she herself aware of her own musical
		precocity, or was she totally naive about it all? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Del: I'm not sure if I can answer that one. I think maybe she kind
		of underrated how much of a talent she actually was, if you see what I mean.
		</B></P>
	 <P> <B> Is that still true, kate? </B></P>

		<DD> I don't know! This is all very interesting for me, it's almost like

	 <P> <B> Del: No, but I think you <CITE>do</CITE> underestimate yourself a
		lot. And I think you're not the only one who does. I think there's a lot of
		people in the music business and the press who underestimate what you're doing
		and what you're capable of. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Some friends of my brother were putting a band together and wanted a
		  lead singer, and I thought it was just a perfect opportunity to get some
		  experience and see what it was like. It was a lot of fun, but as I said, we
		  only did it for about three or four months and then I was in to make the first
		  album. We did clubs and just any places we could get gigs in the area. It was

	 <P> <B> Del: Anyone can set up their gear and sit down at a piano and sing
		for an hour. But not everybody can put on a whole integrated show. And as soon
		as we got our little band together years ago, right from the word go it was
		theatrics and show. We were only playing little pubs on tiny little stages like
		at <CITE>the rose of lee,</CITE> but we had a whole light show, we used dry
		ice, and all that. (1985, <CITE><A

		  the eve of the football match between Scotland and England and all these
		  Scottish boys were in there and they were mad, they were just mad. They had
		  flags waving everywhere, and no-one could see the stage because all the guys
		  were getting up on the stage and putting their arms around you, and it was a
		  bit hard to keep singing when everyone was, like, getting up on stage and
		  poking sticks in your eye. But they were good, they were good people. (1979,

	 <P> <B> Paddy: Kt bush band performances in '77. They were really quite
		interesting. They all took place in a pub in lewisham. The idea was to give
		kate a little bit a practice of preforming. She had a contract with emi and it
		was pretty obvious that the album was going to come out at some time. And it
		was [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] be an experience of directly singing to a group of
		people. And so she thought maybe it would be interesting to [<I>???
		Impression</I>] there was this place in lewisham, it was called <CITE>the rose
		of lee</CITE>, it doesn't exist anymore. The first night that we turned up,
		there were four people there. And it really hotted out about ten thirty,
		another two people came in [<I>Laughter</I>] - jay and my father. [<I>More
		laughter</I>] really, really marvelous. And then the next week it was a bit
		better, it was about... About twelve people there. The songs being sung were,
		they were mainly standards, actually. ``tracks of my tears", [<I>???
		Inaudible</I>] but then in about three weeks [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] the word
		started getting around and the club became more and more and more packed. And I
		think maybe about the fifth or six week [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] you couldn't get
		in. And this was all pre-... Before the album was released or anybody knew
		anything about kate, it was just the name of a group. [<I>Laughter</I>] I think
		about the fifth or six performance [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] that night... The
		night she first did ``james and the cold gun'' .. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> John: Yeah. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: ... In fact, that was really good. I working the lights
		[<I>Laughter</I>] and lisa [<I>??? Invented </I>] fantasicly. We were hoping to
		get these huge blocks of dry ice which we were going to try out in the night.
		They [<I>Just said... Stringing in the dust bin ???</I>] pore some hot water on
		it and watch what happens. And we did and it was phenomenal! [<I>Laughter</I>]
		six foot of [<I>Thrown ???</I>] ice over here. Kate said [<I>"What are you
		laughing about'' ???</I>] [<I>Laughter</I>] yeah, that was very, very
		impressive. I felt, I felt `` james and the cold gun'' had a very phenomenal
		effect on the audience and if anything was maybe the truest sort of insight
		into the way it was going to go. And maybe the nearest thing there was to
		anything like the tour before the tour started. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> John: Yeah, certainly... Particularly that song was the [<I>??? End
		of it</I>] for the performances that came out of the tour. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../dreaming/con_85.html">kate

	 <P> <B> How did you manage, right from the word go, to find such a great

		<DD> Well, in all fairness, the first album was all down to the producer,
		  Andrew Powell, and the engineer, Jon Kelly. As far as I know, it was mainly
		  Andrew Powell who chose the musicians, he'd worked with them before and they
		  were all sort of tied in with Alan Parsons. There was Stuart Elliot on drums,
		  Ian Bairnson on guitar, David Paton on <A
		  HREF="../subjects/bass.html">bass</A>, and Duncan Mackay on electric keyboards.
		  And, on that first album, I had no say, so I was very lucky really to be given
		  such good musicians to start with. And they were lovely, 'cause they were all
		  very concerned about what I thought of the treatment of each of the songs. And
		  if I was unhappy with anything, they were more than willing to re-do their
		  parts. So they were very concerned about what I thought, which was very nice.
		  And they were really nice guys, eager to know what the songs were about and all
		  that sort of thing. I don't honestly see how anyone can play with feeling
		  unless you know what the song is about. You know, you might be feeling this
		  really positive vibe, yet the song might be something weird and heavy and sad.
		  So I think that's always been very important for me, to sit down and tell the
		  musicians what the song is about. (1985, <CITE><A

		  hadn't come in at that moment, well, I don't know what would have happened. It
