		<DD> The <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> was something I very
		  much wanted to try. The b-side of the album was originally written with visual
		  ideas in mind, and I am intrigued by the combination of pictures and sound on
		  film. I went as far as approaching a couple of people about the idea, but I
		  found the success of the album and the rate of single releases extremely
		  demanding, especially as each single required a video, 12", single artwork...
		  It soon built up, and there was no time to even think about this film. The
		  promotion for this album almost lasted a year. By the time I'd taken a break,
		  the gap between albums was already becoming too big to consider fitting in
		  another project. I've now had a holiday and some time to do nothing, and am in
		  the process of thinking out some ideas to take into the studio. </DD>

		<DD> I was so excited that he asked me to sing on that track - It's such

		<DD> I was so thrilled he asked me to sing such a beautiful song but then
		  I got very nervous. Recording at my home studio we don't have window contact
		  between the studio and the control room, you know. We can't see each other, we
		  talk to each other through the mike and headphones, that's all. It's quite
		  isolated, the way I work, and I hadn't been to anyone else's studio for ages.
		  And then at Real World I was <CITE>terrified.</CITE> I messed it up and had to
		  come back another day to re-do it. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> It was fantastic. I'm a big fan of so many of those comedians - they
		  are so talented. For me, alternative comedy is the most exciting thing coming
		  out of this country at the moment, and to be involved in something with them
		  all was really fulfilling. I felt nervous there, too, it's been a long time
		  since I've performed live to an audience, but they were so warm. Unfortunately
		  the piano pedal jammed on the first night in `` Breathing'' and I sang to the
		  most horrific combination of chords you can imagine, so the second and third
		  nights were relatively relaxed after that! </DD>

		<DD> Singing with Rowan was hilarious. He's one of those people who can
		  make his face and body language make you laugh without him having to speak.
		  Again, I was so pleased that they asked me to take part. I wouldn't have missed
		  it for the world. I just wish I'd been brave enough to ask most of them for
		  their autographs - ``Er, Ben, would you? I say, Rick, I've got this nephew...
		  Just sign it, don't bother signing it to him...'' You know, you're meant to act
		  nonchalant, but I found myself starstruck. </DD>

		<DD> Well, I'm sure like most of you if not all of you, I'm a big fan of
		  the <A HREF="../subjects/comedy.html">comedy</A> that's happening in Britain
		  today. I think we've always been a leading voice in comedy and music, and it's
		  so good to see young people actually charging us again with comedy that's also
		  very educational. And I was very honoured to take part in that whole Comic
		  Relief event where Rowan Atkinson was performing. And I really believe that
		  comedy has a lot to offer the world. It's very important. Sometimes you can say
		  much heavier things through comedy than you could ever say seriously. So I was
		  knocked out to sing with Rowan and just to be involved in anything that they
		  were doing. (1990 Kate Bush Con) </DD>

		<DD> Michael Kamen did the orchestral arrangements. He worked on
		  <CITE>The Ninth Wave</CITE>: `` Watching You Without Me'' and `` Hello Earth.''
		  He is very clever. He did the music for the film, and was putting the
		  soundtrack album together with Terry, and they played me this beautiful
		  arrangement without a voice. I'm not sure if this piece was in the film or not,
		  but I don't sing in the film at all. It has such a 30s/40s feel, and Michael
		  asked if I would sing over it - My immediate reactions were fear and ``Yes''

		<DD> It's really frightening to me the way each album has taken longer
		  than the one before. The writing gets harder every time. The Sensual World took
		  about two-and-a-half years to make in all, but with a lot of gaps. I was going
		  quickly at first, thinking, ``Nah, piece of piss!'' Then it all seemed like
		  rubbish, and I had to stop for a while. There's tremendous self-doubt involved.

		<DD> I wanted to take time off after the Hounds of Love album. I wanted

		  wasn't happy with them. I went through a period where I couldn't write at all
		  so I spent a lot of time gardening. I thought I'd lost it. I didn't have
		  anything to say and I didn't want to go out. Nothing like that had happened to
		  me before. I went back to it bit by bit and eventually worked it through. </DD>

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, we did a compilation in between: The Whole Story. But really I
		  wanted to take a break. I'd spent a long time in the studio consistently, and
		  promoting, and I just wanted some space for myself, so I took time at home and
		  just saw friends and just retreated a bit. I wanted to look for something new
		  to say on the new album. I feel always as if I have to make some distinct break
		  between albums, so that it's just not a continuation of the one before. (1989,

	 <P> <B> The problem was that she had started too soon after hounds of love,
		she decided. I'll come off promotion of one album, start on the next and if I'm
		not careful it's nothing but a continuation and I don't want that. It's
		important for me to create some kind of wall, shut it off. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">q</A></CITE>)

	 <P> <B> What marks the sensual world is the way the electronics and
		synthesizers are organically integrated into bush's songs. When I started to
		write this album, I was in a situation where we had updated our studio we had a
		new desk, and generally just more equipment. The high-tech quality-level of our
		studio had gone right up. And I found it quite difficult to write because I
		felt overwhelmed by the amount of equipment around me. It was quite stifling,
		and I made a conscious effort to move away from that, and treat the song as a
		song. I wanted to write songs, and then just use the equipment to do what I
		wanted. Because otherwise it drags you along behind it if you're not careful.

		<DD> Something that really hit me on this album a bit like a hammer, SHE
		  SAYS, ALMOST EMBARRASSED, is that I didn't really have any hobbies, and all I

		<DD> But recently, things like gardening have now entered my life, which
		  is wonderful. I've never had a garden before, just very down-to-earth things
		  like that. Again, it's just having a bit of contact with
		  <A HREF="../subjects/nature.html">nature</A>, you know, and planting things and
		  seeing the slowness of it all. I've planted a flower bed; you have to be very
		  patient. And it's a good thing for me to work with, 'cause making an album, you
		  have to be very patient, and this flower bed helped me,
		  <CITE>tremendously</CITE>, to watch how things have to fight for space: You
		  have to get the weeds out, a little bit of water everyday, everyday a little
		  something. Odd things like that, really! (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Kate also says she frequently has to get completely away from the
		studio, and even from the songs themselves. That's really because after
		intensive periods of work, I'd feel I couldn't go any further, I'd just be so

		to them and not being able to get anywhere with them. </B></P>

		<DD> There were also periods on this album when I just couldn't write. I

		  at home, did gardening - very earthy sorts of things. Things I really needed,
