		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's been a very long time since I spoke to you. It was last year -
		  can time really keep going faster? I would like to apologise for the long gap
		  since the last magazine and fill you in on what's been happening. It seems that
		  every time I do something, it takes me longer to do. This album has taken one
		  year to record and I have never done anything so involved before. After all
		  this time, I do feel happy with the results and I just hope that you will too.
		  </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I have had a lot of help with this album. I never could have done it
		  alone, and each person has contributed something very special. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> We worked between several studios, getting time where we could at
		  the studios with the facilities we required, eventually settling in at Advision
		  Studios, where we finished all the overdubs and mixed the tracks. We also
		  worked at The Townhouse and The Odyssey, and at Abbey Road Studios, where all
		  the backing tracks were recorded. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I used several engineers, working with Hugh Padgham, Nick Launay,
		  Haydn Bendall and Paul Hardiman. All of them were very important and all played
		  major parts in how the album has ended up sounding. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Hugh worked on `` Sat In Your Lap", `` Get Out of My House", and ``
		  Leave It Open.'' Hugh was a lot of fun to work with and as the first engineer
		  on the album, he started it off in a very productive and positive way. I met
		  Hugh when I had the pleasure to sing some backing vocals for Peter Gabriel, and
		  I was very impressed with the sounds and the creative atmosphere. Hugh has
		  worked with The Police, Genesis and XTC, just to mention a few. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> We felt very pleased with the backing tracks and were excited at the
		  results; however, Hugh was too busy to continue, and so I worked with Nick
		  Launay, who had been trained by Hugh. Nick worked on ``<CITE><A
		  HREF="../music/houdini.html">Houdini</A></CITE>", ``All the Love",
		  ``<CITE>There Goes a Tenner</CITE>", `` The Dreaming'' and `` Suspended in
		  Gaffa.'' The majority of the backing tracks were recorded with Nick at The
		  Townhouse. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> We were working through the warm summer last year, and much
		  dedication was required from all to stay in the studio all day without
		  succumbing to the sun. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Nick is a very young engineer and has already worked with Public
		  <A HREF="../subjects/image.html">Image</A>, Phil Collins and John Martyn. Again
		  there was a great working relationship and we were all sad that Nick was too
		  busy to continue and that the time at The Townhouse had run out. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I moved on to Abbey Road, working with Haydn Bendall. I met him on
		  the last album when I was working with Jon Kelly. Haydn was co-<A
		  HREF="../subjects/producing.html">producing</A> Sky and I found him a very
		  patient and understanding engineer. Haydn also engineered Roy Harper's last
		  album and among many other artists, helps up and coming writers to get their
		  ideas securely on to tape, often securing record contracts at the same time.
		  Haydn worked on ``Night of the Swallow'' and `` Pull Out the Pin.'' Our
		  assistant engineer Danny Dawson, affectionately known as Dan-Dan, became part
		  of the working team on the two tracks, and it was really enjoyable. It always
		  is fun when you work with nice people. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> The two tracks are finished and Haydn's time runs out too, so... I
		  find Paul Hardiman, with a lot of help from Hugh Padgham. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Paul has worked with a great variety of acts, from Slade to Keith
		  Emerson and Soft Cell. We worked at Odyssey Studios up until Christmas
		  [<I>1981</I>], and by then Paul and I had a great working relationship. I felt
		  I could communicate with him very easily and he could get the sounds I needed
		  to hear, very quickly. We ran out of time at Odyssey and Paul suggested
		  Advision, studios he knew from experience. He took me around there one
		  afternoon on a Sunday. The studio was deserted and we went down to a small
		  control room that proved to have a brilliant sound. We were sitting listening
		  to tapes at full blast and I was falling in love with the room when the door
		  slowly opened and a rather anxious looking studio manager edged around the
		  door. He saw Paul and sighed with relief, and explained how he'd expected a
		  gang of thugs to be tearing up the studio while listening to tapes of their
		  choice - as far as he had known, the studio was empty. We asked him if there
		  would be any time for us to use the studio, and the three weeks we booked were
		  to turn into more like three months. Paul and I were very excited about
		  settling in to one studio, and Paul had some wonderful effects for sounds that
		  he'd put away for a rainy day. I'm pleased there was a lot of rain to come.
		  </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Although all the engineers were invaluable, Paul was of special
		  value. He became a constant companion during the album and I would often ask he
		  advice, knowing I would get an honest answer. He is also a very funny man, so
		  he kept us all laughing -donning silly hats and pulling funny faces. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> At Advision we met Dave Taylor - he was the assistant engineer, and
		  he worked with us for months until the album was finished and mixed. Dave was
		  also the maintenance engineer, and on quite a few nights, when we went home to
		  bed, he would be up all night twiddling inside machines or trying to figure out
		  why the digital machines weren't working. Every night we ate take-away food,
		  watched the evening news and returned to the dingy little treasure trove to dig
		  for jewels. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Now it's all finished, I think of the beginning. Twenty demos, ten
		  of which became the album. In these demos all the moods and sounds were
		  captured, and all the way through the album these demos were referred to. Often
		  the session would stop, we'd dig out the 1/4 inch tape of the track we were
		  working on, and with the original flavour and sounds strong in our heads, the
		  session would begin again. In many ways it would have been interesting to have
		  used the demos as masters, they were so spontaneous. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> <A HREF="../subjects/del_palmer.html">Del Palmer</A> engineered all
		  the demos and every night he would sit up in the cramped little control room,
		  getting different sounds for each track. He sat through hours of harmonies and
		  takes of lead vocals, replying ``I'm not bored'' as many times as there were
		  cups of tea, and nodding ``Yeah, Kate, I think it sounds great!", a phrase to
		  be echoed by Hugh, Haydn, Paul - Bless you all. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> While working on the album I can't possibly work on the dance as
		  well, and I've got very unfit over the last year. A few weeks ago I started
		  again in complete agony! But I'm not so stiff now, and we're getting the dances
		  done. We've not planned any concerts yet - I wanted another two albums before I
		  could tour them again. Now I've got that with Never For Ever and The Dreaming,
		  so it'll be nice to do another tour. The big problem is the dance as well as
		  the singing when performing, as this does put a lot of extra pressure on me
		  personally - but the determination alone to do the show always keeps me going.

		<DD> Well, for the last couple of months I've been getting back into
		  training because while I've been making the album there's been not time at all,
		  so I've been unfit for a whole year. And of course when you leave it alone for
		  a length of time coming back to it is even harder and it's very painful, you
		  know, you can't walk for days. But it's all in preparation for things that are
		  coming up in the future, for <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html">videos</A> and
		  that sort of thing. So there are a lot of areas that I have to work on all

		<DD> Oh, well, that is the first time. I think the thing that happens is

		<DD> Yes, that's definitely got something to do with it. But when you're

	 <P> <B> Do you think this one's going to be more successful than the last
		one? </B></P>

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I don't know. I don't know what to think about the singles anymore.

	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Was it your idea for it to be a single? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> What, ``<CITE>There Goes a Tenner</CITE>?'' Yes. I think I was in
		  full agreement with them. But I think I've reached a stage where, because ``The
		  Dreaming'' didn't work, we all felt - especially from an airplay point of view
		  - that in order to get airplay, which you need for a single to work, we should
		  go for one that was more obvious, and there is no doubt that ``<CITE>There Goes
		  a Tenner</CITE>'' is one of the more obvious songs. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Not that there are a lot on the album that are obvious. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, so we're just going for this and seeing what happens. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> It's quite a bold move to go in that kind of direction,
		particularly when you've been out of the limelight for a year or two. How
		sensible do you think it is, to make? It's easily the least commercial step
		you've ever done, this album, at a time when perhaps you should have been doing
		the most. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes. You see, from my point of view, although I've been out of the
		  limelight, from the last album all I was planning to do was make another album
		  as quickly as I could. But as soon as I wrote the songs I realized that it was
		  very different, and all the time I do very much want to change my art, and I do
		  actually think that the direction I'm going in is away from the commercial,
		  well the obvious commercial. But I think from my point of view it wasn't so
		  much because I was out of the limelight that I had to do something more
		  commercial, because at that time I wasn't actually out of the limelight, I was
		  just starting my next album, and I thought it was only going to take me a
		  couple of months, but before I know it the whole thing has become much more
		  involved, the songs are much more involved, and I know that it's going to take
		  me at least six months to a year to get it the way I want. So by the time it's
		  finished, I've been out of the public's eye for maybe... apart from `` Sat In
		  Your Lap,'' of course. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Which was a bit of a stopgap. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yeah. In fact, it got to number eleven, and most people forget about
		  that, you see, they just forget that that ever happened, so I've been
		  completely out of the public's eye for two years. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Well, it's funny, actually, you should say `` sat in your lap,''
		because when that came out, and all those drums, I, thought aha! She's trying
		to cash in on the old adam ant tribal drum sound. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yeah. You see, again, that was very annoying, because when I'd
		  actually started getting that together, Adam Ant wasn't really happening.

		<DD> Well, um... Obviously this was the most important step to get over

		  because the album has taken so long. And I'm going to be promoting the album
		  and doing some work in Europe and that kind of thing and making some videos for
		  the singles. And then I'll be working on rehearsing for the show, which

		<DD> Last year, after the album was finished, I decided to promote it as
		  fully as possible. When you've spent nearly a year making an album, you can't
		  let it go out into the world without helping it. In fact, the business has
		  certainly changed in the last couple of years. Everyone has to work much
		  harder, and with an absence of two years from the public eye, I had to show my
		  face again, to prove I was still alive. I did lots and lots of press - I
		  haven't done so much since the first album. It was refreshing to find that the
		  majority of journalists actually really appreciated and understood the album,
		  but I had to explain time and time again that the album hadn't taken two years
		  to make! </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I also did some TVs in England and Europe, with two dancers: Gary,
		  who you all know, and Dougie, a dancer I had met years ago when he was working
		  in Lindsay Kemp's company. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> We worked in Italy and Germany, and the response was wonderful. It
		  was interesting that as we worked more and more on the routine, ``The
		  Dreaming,'' it became tighter and tighter, and little bits were added here and
		  there, until it was so much better than the video that I wished we had had made
		  the video after the TVs. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It was a very interesting trip - we went to Rome, and as Lindsay
		  Kemp was visiting at the time, we got a chance to see Lindsay, and we had a
		  lovely evening. He cooked us a meal, and after we were so full that we could
		  hardly move, he got out boxes of his old photos and we fingered each one with
		  magical memories: shots of <CITE>Flowers</CITE> from The Collegiate Theatre,
		  the first time I saw Lindsay perform. Lindsay dressed as Mr. Punch, leaping for
		  joy. I remember the theatre being full of adults rather than children, and all
		  of us shouting ``Look behind you!'' and ``Oh, no, you don't!'' Adults
		  transported to childhood in a matter of moments - but that's the craft of
		  Lindsay's magic. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Fond memories spread across the floor - the passionate and dramatic,
		  Lindsay's shows in photo form. We carefully put them all back in their boxes, a
		  farewell dance and a big kiss goodbye. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> There is a fountain in Rome where you can make a wish and throw a
		  coin - a very magical place [<I>The trevi fountains</I>]: marble horses,
		  pulling themselves from marble waves, being driven by a marble Neptune. They
		  say the wishes come true. I've yet to see. And there's a hotel in Rome where we
		  stayed, and on the night we arrived, there was a diplomatic meeting on a higher
		  floor. The hotel was full of young soldiers - boys with guns just in case of
		  any trouble. It was a very sad sight. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I had to rehearse my number in my room, and not having a European
		  plug, I took the old one off and began to stick the bare wires into the plug
		  socket, which was hidden behind the table. All the lights went out in the room,
		  so I ran into the hall - no lights. I was half expecting to see soldiers
		  cocking their rifles, having traced the source of the light failure. I went
		  into my room, and a few minutes later the lights came back on. Gary and Dougie
		  came up later, and when I told them they started laughing - apparently the
		  whole hotel had blacked out, and the soldiers in reception had been a little on
		  edge, to say the least. So I won't do that again, and I recommend calling
		  reception to see if they'll help you out if you ever find yourself with two
		  bare wires in a foreign hotel! </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> We travelled to Milan, and then to a place near Venice, where they
		  were holding the Venice Festival. We performed `` The Dreaming.'' The festival
		  is held in a theatre with an audience of a few hundred, and goes out on TV at
		  the same time, so it was a live event, but performed to pre-recorded backing
		  tracks. The Italian audiences are absolutely wonderful, they adore anything to
		  do with art and applaud quite spontaneously if they like something. Each time
		  they liked a step in the routine there would be a ripple of applause, and it
		  was quite hard to keep going without badly needing to smile because it was such
		  a lovely feeling. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> The video ``The Dreaming'' had been made in between press and radio
		  and the trip abroad, and we were very lucky to be able to do all the shooting
		  in one day. It was an extremely ambitious shoot, which included live birds,
		  lasers, flying wires, people being buried completely under sand, not to mention
		  a beautiful set which was built of polystyrene rocks, dead spikey trees and a
		  cardboard moon and sun. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> As the hours rolled on, we were sure we would have to leave at least
		  one idea out, but with a crew who were just as eager as us to see the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> complete and as it should be, we
		  worked on into the night - past the rope made of laser light and the painted
		  men who walked out of trees to a mouth moving in the sand (all we can see of a
		  man deep under the sand; somehow it looks remarkably like Paddy, and it's the
		  last shot in our video). </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Within two months we had done Europe, P.A.s and two other videos. I
		  have never made so many videos in such a short space of time, but there was too
		  much to do, so no more time could be spent on them. A video of ``<CITE>There
		  Goes a Tenner</CITE>'' was made to promote a single in this country, and a
		  video of `` Suspended in Gaffa'' was made for the single release in the rest of
		  the world. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> As we all know, ``<CITE>There Goes a Tenner</CITE>'' bombed in this
		  country, with no airplay and a handful of the worst (and funniest) reviews I've
		  read. The video was not shown at all, but a compilation video called <CITE>Kate
		  Bush: The Single File</CITE> is due out some time soon, so keep your eyes open
		  for an official release date in the music papers. Perhaps then you could get a
		  chance to see it, along with all the others. ``<CITE>There Goes a
		  Tenner</CITE>'' was set in a derelict old room where there was a big safe.
		  There are five of us in the gang, and you might just recognise two of the faces
		  belonging to two of my favourite musicians in the band! </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Although the single in this country did not do well, it is nice to
		  know that in Europe, `` Suspended in Gaffa'' has been quite warmly received.
		  </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> The video of `` Suspended in Gaffa'' was to be done as simply and
		  quickly as possible; as always with very little time to complete it in, the
		  simpler the better. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I saw it as being the return to simplicity, a light-hearted dance
		  routine, no extras, no complicated special effects. [<I>In fact, however, there
		  are many very sophisticated and subtle technical effects in this video, and the
		  production design is very impressive.</I>] As we were all so pleased with the
		  previous sets - put together under the supervision of a very clever man, Steve
		  Hopkins - we asked him to build another, this time an old barn with large gaps
		  in the walls where we could allow the light to streak through. We used a
		  combination of natural and artificial light, and everyone was thrilled with the
		  sense of realism that the set achieved. Steve brought in huge branches of trees
		  that were behind the gaps in the set, and a dedicated helper called ``Podge''
		  sat up on a piece of scaffolding for six hours and enthusiastically shook a
		  piece of tree to make the light move and dance as if motivated by a furtive
		  wind. The video did remain uncomplicated - just a few effects and just one
		  extra: but a very special. one. There is one section where a child's voice
		  says, ``Mother, where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes.'' And there
		  was only one person that could be addressed to - my mother. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> When I asked her to appear in the section, contrary to my concern
		  about her nerves, she was more than obliging and said, ``Yes.'' She was
		  definitely the star of the day, and waited patiently hour after hour as we
		  slowly moved through the bulk of the shooting to eventually reach her debut. I
		  was amazed at her grace and stamina: as all of us began to wane and wilt, my
		  mother continued to blossom and glow, and her only worries were getting back
		  home in time to get dinner and hoping she would not succumb to an attack of
		  giggles during the vital moments of being on screen. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> She needn't have worried, for she is a natural professional, a real
		  star and my favourite mum. (You can see us together in action on the back
		  page.) </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Besides all the promotional activities, because of the decision to
		  release another single, a ``b-side'' had to be written. It is always this way
		  for me: even if things are carefully planned, things always happen at once -
		  and in a big way. I've always loved the idea of singing in a foreign language,
		  and I thought this b-side would be a perfect excuse for doing so. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Really the only language I know enough of to be able to work
		  creatively with is French, so I thought of all the odd words I know, and tried
		  to piece a story together. It's surprising how inspiring it can be to work from
		  a slightly different tangent. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> The tune came straight away, and I filled in all the lines that I
		  had no proper words for with pseudo-French sounds. Luckily Patrick, who worked
		  on Lionheart with us in Superbear [<I>Studios, in france</I>] was staying with
		  Paddy to work on some tracks, so, between him and a friend Vivienne, we worked
		  out the complete lyrics, and ``<CITE>Ne</CITE>T'enfuis<CITE>pas</CITE>'' was
		  put to tape. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Just one more trip abroad, to Paris and Germany to promote
		  ``Suspended in Gaffa,'' and that was nearly the end of the promo, and the year.

		  It's incredible that so many of you should think of me when there's always so
		  many people to think of at Christmas. Also, thank you to all of you for the
		  feedback on the album. I've had so many letters saying that you really like it.
