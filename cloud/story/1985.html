		<DD> There's not a title yet, that's always one of the last things to

		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>. I was feeling very happy when I wrote
		  most of these songs and I wanted to try to get a positive attitude as apposed
		  to the darker, anguished attitude that was a part of some of the tracks on the
		  last album. (1985, March 15, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/iv85_mm.html">The

		  album. But if I can avoid it, I do not want to get caught up in a long
		  drawn-out promotion thing that would keep me away from the creative side of
		  things. Because the longer I work on promotion, then in a way th harder it is
		  for me to get back to doing what I really like doing - recording. We do work in
		  a very isolated way, you know, most of the time it is just three of us in the
		  control-room: the engineer, Del, and myself, say. And then suddenly to go out
		  into the world to do promotion is quite a culture-shock. There are really a lot
		  of people out there, and to walk into a room with perhaps a few hundred people
		  in it and they are all looking at you, it is a very different world! And it is

		  much more time and effort - not the a-sides themselves, but the ``accessories''
		  that now accompany them. A single is not even released now until the video and
		  the twelve-inch are ready; and with the twelve-inch is needed at least a second
		  b-side. Also, if time and ideas allow, all these things should be presentable.
		  I feel a particular obligation, with the artwork of the seven-inch and
		  twelve-inch, that it should at least be interesting; and the same with the
		  video: visuals are important, and with so many images being thrown at people
		  from every side, it can be difficult to come up with ideas. (1986, <CITE><A

		  not only us but the record company and the people who run the store. On all
		  levels, because the people went right around the block which they hadn't
		  expected. They'd got a lot of police to police it, when they didn't need to,

		  that there's a much bigger market and that's all their interested in, is making
		  money. They saw a much bigger market potential because there were people from
		  15 to 50 queuing. And they'd never been able to isolate a Kate Bush fan and in
		  a sense they still couldn't. But you could see with all the signs moving round
		  and round [<I>Laughter</I>] [<I>??? Inaudible</I>]. So I think communications
		  with them are much better, yeah. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> So now, with a remixed seven-inch and twelve-inch of ``<CITE>Big
		  Sky</CITE>", we are armed with time, hopefully, to not rush the video; but
		  somehow other things always come up, and it seems no matter how long you have
		  to get something done, time always speeds up at the end of the process, and
		  there you are rushing again! (1986, <CITE><A

		<DD> I don't know, it's a very strange point in time for me here, where
		  I'm in the middle of promoting the album. And we'll be making videos for the
		  next singles next year. And sometime during this period I have to decide what
		  I'm going to do next. There are a few things that attract me equally. Going
		  straight into another album is something that I have a lot of enthusiasm about.
		  And perhaps turning the conceptual side of this album into a film, is an idea
		  I'm toying with. So, I'm not sure, we'll have to see what I'm feeling like at
		  the beginning of next year. (1985, <CITE><A
