		<DD> One hell of a day. I get up at about half ten. I don't have
		  breakfast - I never do. Just a cup of tea. The first thing on the agenda is an
		  interview with Paul Gambaccini. Before I leave I read my post, which is mostly
		  business. Most other mail goes to my fan club, which is really well organized
		  now. Fantastic. My driver picks me up at about noon. We go to a small studio in
		  Soho. I can't drive. Apart from my driver I go everywhere unaccompanied. The
		  reason I use the driver now is that it was getting ridiculous with cabs, it
		  really was. It's so much easier now, it's just wonderful. [<I>Actually kate did
		  obtain a drivers license, after one failure, in 1976. - ied</I>] </DD>

		<DD> About three o'clock we go from Soho to <CITE>Round Table</CITE> at
		  the Beeb, which Gambaccini also does. [<I>This is a radio programme in which
		  celebrity musicians and critics sit around to listen to and review new
		  records.</I>] We get there about four-thirty. A couple of kids outside - one
		  who's always there every time I go to the BBC. His name is Keith. Must be in
		  his early twenties. He always shows me things I've never seen before, like
		  posters out of record shops. Old magazines. A picture of Pink Floyd before
		  Gilmour was in it - I went WOW. I was really surprised, you know - they were
		  all autographed and everything. I sign a few things, and then go in. </DD>

		<DD> I don't have a go at anyone on the show. There's never any reason to
		  do that. After, I have to go down to Abbey Road studios to re-mix the new
		  single. We get there at about eight-fifteen. About this time I have my first
		  bite to eat of the day - a toasted sandwich and chips. And of course, lots of
		  cups of tea. The only way I can tell if I need food is when I feel sick. I
		  smoke more at night, but I still usually get through less than twenty a day.
		  John Player Special at the moment. We're still at it at three a.m. and I feel
		  fine, but the engineer wants to call it a day. He's a great engineer, and I
		  know he can finish it tonight, so I talk him into it. Come seven a.m. I'm not
		  exactly perky, but I'm still not at all tired. I'm very much a nocturnal
		  creature. My driver picks me up and I get to bed about seven-thirty a.m. </DD>
