	 <P> <B> Sure is. But it's taken a long time for her to take her show on the

		to do the tour? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Basically, it's time. When `` Wuthering Heights'' and The Kick
		  Inside took off at such a level there was a very strong demand for me to go out
		  and do promotion. I think it's a sensible thing to do, but I didn't know it
		  would take up a year. And besides, I spent most of that year recording the
		  second album. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> One of the reasons I waited was to get the show right because to go
		  on tour in this way you do need at least three months' preparation, and I just
		  didn't have the time before. You know, we were all working for six days a week,
		  twelve hours a day - and the number of hours gradually grew towards the end.

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I really need to be prepared for that sort of thing. Even for an

		  perfectionist. But I do have ideas that I don't always reach, so I guess that
		  is what I am. (1979, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i79_ps.html">Pop

		  have to carry'' So he basically invented the radio mikes that you see now, but
		  he made it out of a coat hanger. So he got an old coat hanger and kind of bent

		  perfect moment in ``<CITE>Peter Pan,</CITE>'' and a UFO t-shirt that I've been

		<DD> By the end of that tour, I felt a terrific need to retreat as a
		  person, because I felt that my sexuality, which in a way I hadn't really had a
		  chance to explore myself, was being given to the world in a way which I found
		  impersonal. When I started in this business, I felt very at home in my body. I
		  was a dancer, that was the areas I explored. And it was very scary for me those
		  next few years, because whatever I wore, whatever I did, people were putting
		  this incredible emphasis of sexuality on me, which I didn't feel. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think I was a victim of the fact that I was a young woman who was
		  writing music and the emphasis went on the fact that I was a young woman. There
		  were a lot of things that didn't fit like I was very young, I was female,
		  people thought I was attractive, and I had a very idealistic and positive
		  attitude at a time when negativity and anarchy were hip. So I was coming in
		  from completely the wrong tangent. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> If I'd seen a lot of things I could have trodden a lot more
		  carefully in those early days. But I was very young, and I didn't see them. I
		  trusted people. But all that aside, and I did have a hard time, I think what
		  I've managed to achieve is worth all that shit I went through. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. I think humans are like cars - when the petrol runs out, that's
		  it. What worries me is running out of fuel, because when you're working all the
		  time there is very little chance to do things like going to the theatre,
		  reading books, or whatever things inspire you. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> So it's very important for me to have breaks and be natural and
		  normal and re-fuel, because without that fuel inside you can't give anything
		  out. Very often I see people whose work has totally taken them over, so they
		  can see nothing else in the world. That frightens me. I am a bit obsessed with
		  my work - but I'm also concerned about being a human being. </DD>

		<DD> If people don't want to hear my music any more, I as a personality

		  same... although not as serious, perhaps! (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> There are probably a lot of pressures that I'm not even aware of,
