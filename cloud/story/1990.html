		<DD> I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> comedy. I think comedy is
		  so.... profound. And like everyone, I really love the whole new wave of comedy
		  that started with The Young Ones. I'm a big fan of all the people involved. I'd
		  seen Strike [<I>Another comic strip special</I>],and I was very impressed by
		  the look and Peter Richardson's direction. What those guys do is very special:
		  it might not always work - it's experimental - but its essence is challenging
		  and wonderful. I wanted to make a video for TSW, but I was feeling insecure as
		  a performer. Though I like being the observer rather than the observed, I felt
		  this time I had to confront myself as the observed. And what would help would
		  be to take on a part that would give me a sense of confidence and creative
		  feedback. I liked the idea of working with Peter, and I also really like the
		  attitude in their work towards women. A lot of films I sit there thinking,
		  ``That's stupid!'' We worked on the video and it was alot of fun, and we stayed
		  in touch as friends. When he was working on the <CITE>Comic Strip</CITE>
		  series, I got a script and he asked me if I'd play a part. It was a perfect
		  challenge. I thought, OK, if you're going to confront yourself as a performer,
		  here's an opportunity. I felt very honoured to be asked. It was a completely
		  different pace of working and I learned a lot. You sit around and read all day,
		  but also you're on tenterhooks. Videos are much more frightning, because there
		  I'm trying to be me rather than someone else. I quite enjoyed acting; I wasn't
		  sure I would. I'd never really wanted to be an actress, but I love film. I'm
		  not sure if I want to act again, but if an interesting director asked me, my
		  ego probably wouldn't let me say no! I love film directors, and I guess part of
		  me would eventually love to make a film-just a short one. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> In some ways this boxed set has almost put an end to an era, SHE

		  WOULDN'T REMARK IF WORN BY A SCHOOLTEACHER... I can't say what will be that

		  to bed-putting all those little sheep in a pen! (1990, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Peter gabriel, nigel kennedy, dave gilmour - these are the
		musicians to whom you're linked. Is it a social set, or do you have a social
		life that excludes music? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It depends. I do go through phases, very much so. Some are
		  professional and some are very much friends. Nigel is the fullest of the two,
		  in that we work together and he's also a great friend. He's really nice to work
		  with, and because we're friends, the communication's great. You develop an
		  almost unspoken sense of what you want, and a lot less needs to be said. They
		  trust you,you trust them. It's much easier to experiment because they're not so
		  frightened. There's a lot to be said for working with people who are close to
		  you. I've lost one of our important members of that group: Alan Murphy died
		  late last year and another friend of mine died this year. Again, that's why I
		  feel the boxed set marks the end of an era because I'll never work with them
		  again. And I do miss them, and it's made me think about a lot of things, and I
		  have consciously taken a break from work since their deaths to do nothing. I've
		  just taken six months off. I've had six months gaps between things, but always
		  carrying this project around, and I don't know why I haven't done it before.
		  I'm a bit obsessive about my work you see. But now I can see there's a part of
		  me that loves not being tied into a project, that loves just to be able to go
		  off. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Have you begun to formulate your next move? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I have, but I can't tell you because it's probably going to
		  change! I want to find a balance between the observer and the observed. I love
		  making music, and as long as I'm doing that,even if the albums don't sell,
		  there'll be a certain amount of recognition. I feel I have to accept that,and
		  learn from it and not run away from it any more... (1990, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I think I'm starting to feel different about a few things, and my
		  attitude toward live work is one. I would like to think from this point onwards
		  I could speed up, and keep the momentum of my work faster. I have a tendency to
		  think too much. I've just started writing again, and there's no pressure on me.
		  I get no sense of people expecting anything from me, because I take so long.
		  That's a very nice feeling, actually doing something in my own space. How I
		  wrote at least the last two albums was to go into the studio and write ideas
		  onto tape, as it were dump stuff on to tape, forget about it and then move on
		  to the next area. But when I first started, I always used to write on the
		  piano, and just the last couple of months, I've felt at home again writing on
		  the piano. It's such a different process, I find it quite shocking. It's like
		  suddenly you've become the memory banks; instead of dumping it on tape, it's
		  staying in you. And each time you play the song,it changes. The sense of
		  transformation is very subtle;each time you play it, something will change. And
		  by continually playing that song,it actually begins to develop, almost like it
		  takes on a life of its own. I find this fascinating - and exhausting, because I
		  have to use memory and concentration which I haven't had to use in quite a
		  while. Going back to a rooted way of working, I do feel a change in myself.
		  Maybe I'm taking the opportunity to peruse the landscape and see if there's not
		  things I could change. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Is this return to the piano a result of feeling you'd gone as far
		as you could with hi-tech? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I do feel that I've achieved things on that last album. At some
		  points when I was making it I thought I would never finish it. It was a mammoth
		  task. Just getting up the courage to get in touch with The <CITE>Trio
		  Bulgarka</CITE> took me a long time. I wanted to preserve the sense of how
		  precious they were, I didn't want to abuse it. A lot of time goes into my fear
		  and worry about something, and afterward it's all right anyway. In a way I feel
		  what I should do is jump in there and do it! </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> What are you trying to prove? Or have you now overcome that need to
		prove yourself? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> There is a big part of me that is very over-ambitious. It's
		  ridiculous! And it drags me along behind it. It's one of my qualities that I
		  can't deny in my work. I guess I'm trying to prove something to myself. But
		  perhaps rather than having to prove something, people who create feel a great
		  empty sense of hunger,a feeling of emptiness in life. And by being able to
		  create,you can somehow express yourself in a way that maybe you can't in the
		  ordinary realms of life. I really feel it's connected to religion-real
		  religion. In your teens you hit the point where there's a big
		  introversion-you're saying. Who am I? What am I going to do with myself? I
		  really felt when I was 17, which was when the whole propulsion of my creativity
		  took over. I changed very dramatically in about two years. I do feel it's an
		  introversion that all creative people go through, and a lot of it is linked to
		  religion. So many artists are looking for God, and this is where we find the
		  voice to try and speak. It's also a kind of self-therapy, trying to heal
		  yourself. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Of what? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Probably a sense of inadequacy. And through this expression you at
		  last have a voice, whether it's through painting, whatever. And I think it can
		  be a much wiser voice. In your creativity there can be quite deep attitudes,
		  and I think its got to be linked somehow with the unconscious that you're
		  tapping into. (1990, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i90_q2.html">Q

		<DD> And I've kind of been taking the approach where I go back to writing
		  on the piano again, which was how I used to work when I started. And it was
		  quite shocking for me to suddenly be left alone at the piano without all this
		  equipment, you know, where I could just press a button and I've suddenly got an
		  orchestra... And I felt really, really odd about the whole thing. But, in some
		  ways I think I'm trying to get back to a lot of things that were my roots. I've
		  started dancing again, which I never thought I'd manage. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> And I think in some ways... Like we were saying earlier, when I
		  started it was all like a sense of a mission, it was something I had to do, I
		  was, you know, working towards this. I kind of lost that a bit, and just found
		  myself making album after album, and getting further away from the writing
		  process too, so I think maybe with this album I want to... I want to try and
		  make it a little simpler, and hopefully... positive. But we'll see, won't we?
		  But I'm really pleased, that's a lovely reaction, as I've only started the

		<DD> I know it's been such a long time. All I can say is I just, in many
		  ways, haven't been ready for it. And also I don't think the time was quite
		  right for me since that first tour. I think those of you that were there will
		  know how much I did enjoy touring, it's not that I didn't enjoy it, which a lot
		  of uh, I've seen press... interview things... It's not true, I did enjoy it
		  very much. And, I would very much like to at least do some shows again, if not
		  a big tour. So, we're thinking about it now, and although it's not definite, I
		  would have thought if it's going to go ahead it will be announced in January.
