		<DD> We have to be ready downstairs by half eight, and go straight to the
		  airport. <A HREF="../subjects/flying.html">Flying</A> doesn't bother me too
		  much - only when I fly a lot in a short space of time, because then the odds
		  seem to get higher. I try to be philosophical about it - once you're in the
		  plane there's not too much to be done. Arrive in London later than morning. Do
		  an interview at the Heathrow Hotel, and have some photos taken. Then I go home
		  and feel wiped out again, so over to my parents' to sit in the sun. I
		  recuperate, and go home again. I slob around, clean the flat up - it's in awful
		  shape... I feed the cats, Zoodle and Pyewacket. Even when I'm that tired, I
		  still don't get to bed till three or four. I spend a lot of time on the phone.
