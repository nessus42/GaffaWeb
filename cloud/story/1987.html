	 <P><B> How is the new album going? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> Well, as usual it is slow, but I keep writing new songs, as I feel
		  the urge. And I now have lots of songs, but most of them have pieces missing or
		  sparse lyrics, and sorting these things out takes a lot of time. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> How are you approaching this album? Is it different from the last
		one? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Again I am working straight onto master tape in our home studio. As
		  I get ideas, I put them onto tape. Sometimes this causes more problems, because
		  I'll like parts of it and not others, but I try to re-do as little as possible.
		  I like to try and keep the performances quick and spontaneous. It's the sorting
		  out of these performances afterwards, and the rethinking of structure or
		  arrangements, that take the time. Each musician changes the feel of the track
		  dramatically, and it's important to keep the track moving in the right
		  direction and to communicate what is wanted, which in my case is achieved
		  through images, humming lines and letting the musicians do what they feel is
		  right and saying if I don't like it. It seems to have worked, so far, and I
		  always find musicians so inspiring. Quite often they'll put an edge to the
		  track that gives it greater potential, so I sit and re-think bits again. The
		  tracks continually change, and yet the original ``feeling'' doesn't seem to.
		  I'd like to think that by putting the initial ``muse'' onto tape, we've
		  captured its soul, so that whatever we put on top of it, it is, in essence, the
		  same. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Are you using a lot of synthesizers? If so, which ones, and how?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I'm using the Fairlight again, and a DX-7; but a lot of the songs
		  have been written on piano initially, and it does definitely give the songs a
		  different flavour from those written on Fairlight. A lot of rhythms are
		  arranged by Del, and we tend to keep bits and replace a lot with real drums,
		  but still keeping his ``feel'' But there are a few tracks which are just
		  synthesized drums. It's whatever works; but I am using a lot of real
		  instruments on this album. I really like working with musicians, they approach
		  things from a different angle. They have fresh ideas. </DD>

	 <P> <B> When will the album be finished? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Umm... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> When do you think it will be finished? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Umm... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Have you been doing other projects besides the album? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I've been mainly concentrating on the album and catching up on my
		  life a bit, but I did write a song for a film by an American Director: John
		  Hughes. The piece from the film is extremely moving, and I really enjoyed
		  writing to it. Let's hope when the film is released (hopefully some time in
		  '88) that you get to see it. The director has a very distinctive style (he
		  directed <CITE>The Breakfast Club,</CITE> which I really like), and I think
		  this, his latest film _She's<CITE>Having a Baby,</CITE> is well worth a watch.

	 <P> <B> You also appeared at peter gabriel's live concert at earls court.
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, it was very much a last minute decision. Peter had asked me,
		  and I wasn't sure if I was brave enough to perform unrehearsed in front of such
		  a large crowd. It is such a beautiful song to sing, but the reception from the
		  audience was so overwhelming, I couldn't hear what I was singing. So if anyone
		  reading this was there that night - sorry if I was a bit out of tune; and if
		  you were one of those people - thanks for an incredible experience, I don't
		  think I'll ever forget that welcome. It was a fantastic concert and I am,
		  again, very honoured to have been involved in Peter's work. (1987, <CITE><A
