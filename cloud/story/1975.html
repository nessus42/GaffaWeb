		  finished taking my 'O' levels at school and was coming up to the stage where
		  you start thinking about 'A' levels at the University. And I wasn't really into
		  the idea of going to University, so I thought I should leave school and
		  concentrate on my career, already having signed a contract with the record
		  company. And I wanted to do something that would show my name creatively, that
		  it would hopefully complement the music, so I decide to take dancing. I saw a
		  performance by a mine artist called Lindsay Kemp and I thought that's really
		  what I wanted to do, that kind of movement and combine it with music. So, I
		  spent the next two years writing songs and just dancing. After about 18 months,
		  I went on to be a singer in a band. We started doing gigs around local pubs,
		  doing other people's songs. After we had been doing that for just a couple of
		  months, the record company decided it was time for me to do my own. (1983,

		<DD> It did an incredible amount, especially when I started back then. I
		  had a <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">recording</A> contract, but I didn't
		  know when I was going to be making the first album, and I had, in a way, time
		  to kill and use until that point. And I had very little experience... certainly
		  the business, I mean coming straight from school. And I had almost two clear
		  years of going to the dance school, learning to dance, getting more control
		  over my body, and writing. Just using the time generally as a kind of
		  foundation for what was to happen next when the album was released and the
		  single was very successful. I think without having used the time like that,
		  things could've been very different for me. I was very lucky. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> It was really exciting for me. It was what I had been hoping for for
		  a few years. It was great. At the same time, it wasn't very easy. You certainly
		  had to fight for what you wanted and I think that's the code for anything. You
		  do have to fight for what you want. When you know that there is something that
		  you can aim for, the chances are there will be obstacles you will have to get
		  over in order to get it. (????,TWS) I FIND IT REALLY AMAZING THAT AT SUCH A

		<DD> I'm not really sure. At the time it didn't strike me as being odd in
		  any way at all. That was just what I had to do. This was it, this was my
		  mission in life. And, actually, the older I get, the more I look back on it, I
		  think how bizarre it was. I had such a feeling of time being incredibly
		  important - that I shouldn't waste any time at all, and I was very impatient
		  for the first album to be made and to come out... And, uh, maybe I was psychic
		  [<I>Laughing</I>] and I knew that in ten years it would be taking me four years
		  to make an album. </DD>

		<DD> But, I did have an incredible sense of just... needing to do it. It
		  was what I did. And I feel very lucky that I had something to actually focus on
		  at such a young age. It, well it changed my life, eventually. I wouldn't be
		  here today, now, if, you know. And, you find yourself in situations that you
		  would never have imagined. You know, I think of myself back at school, and the
		  first gig I ever saw was The Who. And they completely blew me away. And I could
		  never have imagined that I would well, be here now. It's ridiculous, really. It
		  is, it's ridiculous! [<I>Laughing.</I>] (<A

		<DD> It's a very ordinary flat, though I like it because it's got all my

		  London, because I can't drive. (????,TWS) </DD>

		<DD> I wanted to get some sort of bodily expression together to go with

		<DD> I never felt too young to be a musician. I'd written since I was

		  It couldn't have happened fast enough. School inhibited me. I had only one
		  close friend - she still is [<I>This may be lisa, who is secretary of the kate
		  bush club, among other things - ied</I>] - who I felt able to tell about the
		  record deal. It wasn't until I left school that I found real strength inside. I
		  was lucky that Dave Gilmour liked my demos, but all the rest was karma, it was
		  meant to be... (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i85_what.html">What Kate
