		<DD> Well, I think the first pop thing I ever heard which I really liked
		  was ``Little Red Rooster'' [<I>By the rolling stones</I>]. I heard it in a car
		  coming back from the shops and I thought it was fascinating. It was the first
		  song I'd ever heard where the singer was actually singing out of tune. I don't
		  mean that derogatorily. What I mean, I suppose, is that the record sounded so
		  unconventional, and I just hadn't <CITE>experienced</CITE> anyone singing like
		  that before. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> The stones had that record out around 1964, was this when you were
		about six years old? Yes, around that time, I suppose. It was really a
		fantastic <CITE>sound</CITE> - the fact that someone wasn't singing quite in
		tune and, because of that, was getting a very different
		<A HREF="../subjects/emotion.html">emotion</A> out of it. But I suppose,
		really, I first became aware of pop music around the late 1960s. I was hearing
		that sort of music through my two brothers and thinking just how good it was.
		But for the fact that my brothers were playing those records, I probably
		wouldn't have heard them, as my friends in school wouldn't have been listening
		to things like that! I think that was the earliest pop music that I really felt
		was good. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> <A HREF="../subjects/paddy_bush.html">Paddy bush</A>: But you see
		now, that's an interesting thing, because we weren't really involved in the pop

		towards traditional folk music. (1985, <CITE><A

		  Obviously when you're very young you're listening to the music that is supplied
		  to you. And I think the radio was probably my main influence getting into new
		  music. And also a large selection of forty-fives that my brothers had, that I
		  used to plow through on wet rainy afternoons and find these records that I'd
		  never heard before, people that I'd never heard before. And also it was good

		<DD> I wasn't an easy, happy-go-lucky girl, because I used to think about
		  everything so much, and I think I probably still do. I was writing songs from
		  the age of ten - and I was never really into going to discos and dances and
		  stuff. Obviously, I used to like to go and meet boys, but I mainly just liked
		  playing with the piano. I never told anyone at school that I did that, because
		  I feared it would alienate me even more. </DD>

		<DD> I was too shy to be a hooligan, but inside I had many hooligan
		  instincts. But I never even gave any lip to the teachers. And in return, none
		  of them picked on me. </DD>

		<DD> It was great. I really liked boys. I always will like boys. I was
		  popular with them. And my level of involvement wasn't just a sexual one,
		  whereas for a lot of girls it was. </DD>

		<DD> I used to get the most terrible crushes on boys, always much older
		  than me. And it was terrible. I used to think they were so beautiful. But I'd
		  never get anywhere with them. Just the old fantasy trip of getting off on
		  someone, was what it was about. </DD>

		<DD> My life as a teenager was interesting and difficult. And it was
		  important, because it stirred up all sorts of things in me. But I was very
		  lonely. And even after I left school, there were times when the loneliness
		  became desperate. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/tofy.html">The

		<DD> But reading was once a very big passion. When I was about eight or
		  nine, for about three years I got through dozens and dozens of
		  <A HREF="../subjects/books.html">books</A> and was very much into reading,
		  mostly fiction. But as soon as I began writing poems at school - basically, as
		  soon as I started getting into writing songs - everything else seemed to go out
		  the window. I'd sit down and read a book, and think how I could be writing a
		  song rather than reading. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> When I was at school, yeah that was my thing. And then I got into
