		  start with Luxembourg, but they pulled out, so I go straight to Capital.
		  [<I>Capital radio is the independent station that broke kate in 1977 by playing
		  `` wuthering heights'' months before its official release date.</I>] There for
		  three, a very short chat. Then I do Radio One, then hang around a bit to do
		  Brian Matthews on Radio Two. I leave about nine, and go home. On the way I pick
		  up a Chinese takeaway. I don't need a bodyguard or anything for stuff like
		  that. If people do recognize me they're not too likely to smother me in kisses
		  or anything. Get home about ten, look through some photos with my brother, and
		  natter about odd bits of business. If I've got nothing to do I have a quick
		  tinkle on the piano, which I try to get to all the time. Bed as usual three

		<DD> For the album to have been so warmly embraced has made me very
		  happy. It's hard for me to explain how easy it is to get anxious with your own
		  songs once they're on disc. They can easily be up to a year old already, and so
		  the unveiling of the album felt very like the prodigal son coming home to me. I
		  was willing to leap into anything that would help move it along. As you all
		  know, most artists will do promotional work - which we will call ``the rounds''
		  - to accompany their product. It was my turn for ``the rounds'' What makes that
		  fun are the people that you meet and you are with - the travelling, the talking
		  are tiring and monotous. Among the major promotional events was a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A> P.A. [<I>Personal appearance</I>]
		  tour, which you'll hear more of in A. B.'s [<I>Andrew bryant?</I>] article.
		  This means travelling from city to city, visiting radio stations and record
		  shops to meet people and give autographs, and to do the odd press interview.
		  The tour was to start in Edinburgh. Hil [<I>Hilary walker, kate's manager</I>]
		  had booked a motorail ticket for us to travel by train to Carlisle, taking the
		  car to drive us from there onwards. The train left at five minutes to midnight,
		  and things were packed: a flask of tea, a couple of sandwiches, some books,
		  etc. And as the car had been put on the train an hour or so before our
		  departure, I decided I'd visit a friend in between that time and get a taxi to
		  the station. I was having a great chat in a nice, warm, cause environment with
		  homemade fruit buns and a steaming cup of tea, when I realised the taxi that I
		  had ordered had not arrived yet and it was getting late. I rang again - they
		  said it was on its way, but we know they always say that, don't they? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Eventually, with an excited driver speeding to the station at the
		  thought of the mentioned ``big tip'' if he got me there on time, I arrived at
		  midnight: no train and lots of weridos. Another train was quickly sorted out
		  which left an hour later, and so I bedded up in a little cabin set for
		  Scotland. The first thing that really hit me when I got in the cabin was it was
		  so quiet. I couldn't remember the last time I'd been anywhere so silent, and it
		  scared me. Its silence made me feel uneasy because of me being so unused to it.

		<DD> The scenery was beautiful, waking up as the sun peeped over the
		  transient countryside and factory chimneys. We arrived in Edinburgh and the
		  first <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A> station. The schedule had
		  begun. Meeting the people in the shops is a very strange experience - whilst I
		  sit at the back of the shop and watch them all come in, as anxious as me, some
		  of them. All these faces feeding me, one by one; they think I'm feeding them,
		  but they're giving me so much it's like they've all come to my party and the
		  more the merrier. That's something that struck me, how most of the people are
		  remarkably warm and kind and unbothered, and they're not trying to prove
		  anything. I get a certain kind of ``pride", if that's not too arrogant,
		  thinking how lucky I am to have these people receptive to my music. It means a
		  lot in terms of artistic reward. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> A lot was covered on the tour, including a brief meeting with
		  Ranchor, our friend from the Hare Krishna movement, who has now moved to
		  Manchester, which was one of the cities on our route. Eventually, the tour
		  completed, and a long, warm, sleepy drive back to London listening to taped
		  stories. </DD>

	 <P> <B> A tv show in germany meant a dance routine, choice of dancers and a
		trip to munich. ``babooshka'' and ``army dreamers'' had been asked to be
		performed. The ``babooshka'' video, if you remember, h.ad double bass sections,
		and this is what I ``bassed'' my routine on, using the instrument all the way
		through the song. The evening I was working on the choreography, paddy, andrew
		[<I>Bryant</I>] and del were in the room. We decided to try it, as I had some
		ideas, and we worked the night through very enthusiastically, eventually coming
		up with a very dramatic and very pleasing routine. `` army dreamers'' is one of
		those songs that could take many different concepts as a visual choreographic
		piece. For germany we decided a cleaning-woman of abstract barracks would be
		fine, joined by three army dreamers, one of whom is a mad sergeant-major who
		shouts commands at invisible troops, one who carries a gun and mandolin, and
		one who blinks blankly and carries a small brown teddy bear. The routine was
		rehearsed, army uniforms bought, mrs. Mopp's costume improvised with an old
		jumble-sale dress, a pair of pink rubber gloves, a head scarf, ma's kitchen
		apron, her wooden broom and a small brown teddy-bear for one of our
		``dreamers'' </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Arriving in Germany, we were met and taken straight to the TV
		  centre, where we were to spend the day. The rehearsal went well - borrowing
		  some toy guns from the TV people, and a broom which I'd forgotten to bring as
		  hadn't looked like a prop standing in my hall as I left for the airport. It was
		  time for the performance. I was Mrs. Mopp, and the three army dreamers were
		  somewhere in the building, waiting, too, for the call. As I came down the
		  stairs, receiving many funny looks at my dress, I saw three men in uniform
		  standing in the doorway with black, made-up faces looking very heavy and
		  official, and it was not until I got very close and noticed the grinning,
		  familiar faces that I realised who they were. Everything went very well; and,
		  joined by two MM [<I>Melody maker</I>] scouts, we had a great time. The show
		  was done, and out to dinner, incorporating an MM interview. The Germans looked
		  after us very well, and at one point in rehearsals we had been hesitant that
		  people around us were offended or worried by three Englishmen dressed in Army
		  uniforms strolling around the studio with little guns, but no problem - it
		  shows how little these people hold grudges that we were still suspicious of.

		  again, was to be performed abroad, this time in Venice. Venice is an extremely
		  beautiful place, and if you ever get the chance to see it, please do, it really
		  is magical. Water is the way of everything there - even lampposts are on water.
		  I took lots of photos, and we've included one of a canal. The hotel that we
		  were staying at was beautiful, with an incredible view of the ocean out of my
		  window. For this TV show Gary [<I>Hurst</I>] and I had rehearsed a duet which
		  we had made up the night before. Often this has strangely good results; maybe
		  it is due to adrenalin. Gary had hired a suit from Moss Bros. the day before,
		  and I'd pulled out an old dress which I used to wear when I was in the KT Bush
		  Band and we performed in pubs. This TV show was live, and as the studio was
		  only across the road (the other side of the hotel backed onto one of the few
		  pieces of dry land in Venice), every performer dressed and made up at the hotel
		  and walked to the TV studio fully equipped . </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Our turn came, and as we hit the street we saw silver-suited
		  spacemen; red-, blue-, green-haired people; electric guitars; pantomime horses;
		  one yellow submarine and two dancing bears spilling in and out of the TV
		  centre. We squeezed past the various brightly coloured suits and smiles, did
		  our bit and squeezed past them again on the way back to the hotel. In many ways
		  it reminded me of Noah's Ark: two of every kind in a place on the water. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Just as we entered the hotel we met Peter Gabriel, plus band, who
		  were also on the same show and were on their way out. We exchanged very English
		  greetings on foreign land: ``Break a leg, old chap!"; and Peter headed on his
		  way to the bizarre circus. Meanwhile, we had heard that there was a TV room
		  upstairs, so we rushed up to a mini-circus where all the artists that had
		  already performed were sprayed around the floor, glued to the television,
		  expressing kind words of comradeship in the relevant language to whomever was
		  on the screen at that point in time; an unusual live, friendly feeling. Peter's
		  performance was powerful and stood out amongst all the others, and the
		  viewing-room certainly seemed to agree. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The next version of `` Army Dreamers'' was to be the promotional
		  video. For a long time my vision of `` Army Dreamers'' on screen had been in
		  green woods, heavy and sad, and the extent of the visual production I wanted on
		  this occasion would only be possible where we had the time, opportunities and
		  budget: not unlike an unknown TV studio, where you have no control over the set
		  or lighting - you go for the simplest, easiest concept possible without
		  spoiling the image. I drew a storyboard from which we worked. I have never had
		  a talent for drawing [<I>I don't agree at all. A very clever and sensitive
		  landscape drawing by kate, dated 5th november 1978, appeared in issue number 14
		  of the <CITE>newsletter.</CITE> it shows great style and natural ability which
		  kate, unfortunately, has never developed. - ied</I>] and so I got a lot of
		  laughs, as well as being able to communicate the ideas in a more concrete way.
		  The cast had to be big - we were to represent an army unit, therefore needing a
		  Sergeant-Major. I gathered all the people that I knew would not only look good
		  but act the part; the choice was obvious - the band, Andrew [<I>Again last name
		  not given</I>] as our Sergeant-Major. Phone calls were made, and I couldn't
		  have asked for a more positive reaction from everyone concerned, to the point
		  of someone putting off a session. A second phone call was made immediately
		  afterwards to find the size boot required for the uniforms. This became very
		  Pythonesque, especially when people replied ``Size 9.'' Everyone involved was a
		  natural actor and performer, and a rehearsal was called. The cast were to turn
		  up at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, Keef at 2 and Rocket and Barry (who were the
		  two cameramen) at 3. From 2 until 3 Keef and I excitedly worked out the
		  details, using my storyboard (which certainly got a giggle out of him) and
		  bouncing ideas that we would get in turn. Most of my inspiration came from
		  every war movie I have ever seen, from the original <CITE>All Quiet on the
		  Western Front</CITE> to <CITE>Apocalypse Now,</CITE> and this was then applied
		  to the subject matter and concept of the song. When Barry and Rocket turned up,
		  Keef and I were bursting with anticipation of letting them in on the epic.
		  They'd hardly got in the door before I thrust my storyboard under their noses
		  and Keef was talking special lenses. Rocket and Barry are the two best
		  cameramen I have worked with on a frequent basis. They soon joined in the
		  ``Ooh!"s and ``Hey, what if we...?"s and ``Well, we could try..."s, and we were
		  away on a very challenging prospect, having to wait just for the confirmation
		  of safety before we could definitely write the jerk-jacket into the script (we
		  will talk more about this fabulous device later). 4 o'clock arrived, the band
		  arrived, and the good weather had arrived; so we were set for an outdoors
		  rehearsal. It went so smoothly, and all the cast were so professional, that
		  Barry and Rocket could not hide their respect, and neither did we for them (you
		  can see Barry being charged and Rocket being jumped over in the photos). The
		  rehearsal broke, we sabotaged the crew as they left, and we all went our ways
		  to prepare for the big day tomorrow. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It was a very early start, having to reach Pinewood by 8 a.m., and
		  everyone's prayer for mild weather had been answered uncannily. The sun lit up
		  the fern-swamped woods in a way I could never have hoped for; it was a good
		  omen for a good day. Philip and Graham are two child actors; they both have
		  pure white hair that, in that day's sunshine, shone and glittered, and they
		  behaved very professionally and looked stunning on the screen. The day was long
		  and full, and so much was achieved that apparently in film terms the amount we
		  covered would have taken a week, which was encouraging to hear. Everything had
		  gone as planned, all the action shots covered, and everyone looked superb.
		  There were some magical moments created both on and off screen by the talent
		  and humour of those people who I'd be lost without. Jay took some incredible
		  shots during the day, which perfectly catch the moods and the lighting of those
		  people and woods. Lisa [<I>Bradley</I>] took some fabulous movie-film which
		  expressed not only the effort that was taken, but also, again, the comedy of
		  the personalities involved. Al was blown up as beautifully as could be of
		  course only in terms of video fantasy land; Paddy somersaulted and fired,
		  Stewart tripped and danced, Andrew roared and soared, Brian was flying, Preston
		  kept his vest on, Kevin was in heaven, we all tumbled and ached and played
		  soldiers until all was finished, bar the jerk-jacket. </DD>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We had lost our daylight by now, and as the trees echoed the screams
		  and yells of musicians and dancers in soldier's clothing, I turned to see them
		  leaping over the camera in the most dramatic light I have witnessed outside a
		  studio. Two huge spotlights leaking smoky light across the clearing in the
		  wood. It's these little moments I lock away as thrills of the theatre manmade.
		  It was time to get into the jerk-jacket. The idea was to finish the video with
		  myself symbolically representing my son, as well as being his mother. We wanted
		  a very violent movement of my body, ideally being thrown off the ground. The
		  effect we used was the jerk-jacket, which we would film and then put into slow
		  motion at the editing stage. The jacket consists of a harness and a wire, with
		  a man manually pulling the wire via a pulley system. The wire is connected to
		  the back of the harness, with a hole through various layers of clothing to
		  allow the wire to be straight when taut. As the man pulls the wire, the person
		  wearing the harness is pulled off their feet backwards, landing on an
		  appropriately camouflaged, padded area to soften the landing. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I was very excited at the prospect of experiencing the feeling, and
		  with the professional help of stunt-men it was an unforgettable event - very
		  exciting - and we got the footage we'd hoped for. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Everything over, wires being wrapped up, vans driving off, cameras
		  tucked in for the night and us off to do the edit of that day's filming. The
		  edit was in my opinion the most complete so far: it was like a well-made wooden
		  jigsaw, with all the edges smoothly planed, and by two in the morning, with the
		  excellent help of our visual engineer, Brian, we had made and edited the movie,
		  and it was now complete and very satisfying. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It was a busy week. The next day, an Austrian interview and mixing
		  ``Warm and Soothing'' were on the schedule, and off to Holland the next day to
		  do `` Babooshka'' and yet another slightly different version of ``Army
		  Dreamers'' in Holland. [<I>See paddy's description of the holland performances
		  in his <CITE>newsletter</CITE> article, <CITE>memoirs of an army
		  dreamer,</CITE> in the same issue. (reprinted in the garden)</I>] I was feeling
		  tired when we started rehearsing the routines that evening for the next day,
		  and by the time I had packed and finished rehearsing, it was about five in the
		  morning; and so, as I was being picked up for the airport at 6:15, I ended up
		  without that night's sleep. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> At one point I looked at Pyewacket, my cat, and said, ``Help me,
		  Pye, I'm so tired.'' And she looked at me and said, ``Me'ow?'' It became one
		  very long day, and my energies were going, but they survived with much help
		  from those around me. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The show went very well, including the floor-manager being searched
		  as part of our routine. It went out very late at night and, as it was the first
		  one in the series and was live, everyone was very relieved when it was over. At
		  last, a few hours' sleep before leaving early next morning for Munich and then
		  Hamburg on a two-day radio/press tour; which was fun, meeting up with Werner
		  from EMI-Munich. He was very good to me: earlier, he had given me the copy of
		  Bowie's album before it was released here, and on this trip he did exactly the
		  same with Stevie Wonder's new record. It is an incredible album [<CITE>The
		  Secret Life Of Plants</CITE>], and I was lucky enough to see him tour when he
		  was here. The whole of the arena was dancing and laughing - I've never seen
		  anything like it. And by coincidence Paddy bumped into none other than Werner
		  while leaving. It certainly was a happy concert, and was marked with many ticks
		  by me, alongside The Wall and others. (1980, <CITE><A

		  And it helps, cause if you've got lots of really good music to listen to then
		  it helps you too, you know. You listen to it and think ``yeah!!! I can channel

		<DD> It is a possibility, but I wouldn't like to say any more than that,
		  'cause, uh, you know, things take so much time. It's incredible. The album is
		  the thing that I've decided that's happening, and we'll see what happens after
		  that's out of the way! </DD>

		<DD> Um... Yes, on the whole, but I think, to be quite honest, it's been
		  a really hard year, and I think so many people will be glad when it's over.
		  It's been a very testing year. In many ways it's almost been saying ``All
		  right, let's see if you can get through this, and if you can then one up to
		  you.'' And I think an awful lot of people have really coped with this year
		  coped with this year fantastically well. So, uh, here's to them, and here's to
		  1981! </DD>

		<DD> I very much enjoyed doing the Radio 1 programmes with Gamba.
		  [<I>Paul gambaccini, who invited kate to co-host two programmes on december 30
		  and 31, 1980, during which she played many of her favourite pieces of music by
		  other artists.</I>] He is a very funny man, and it was wonderful for me to have
		  the freedom of choice in music. I felt it very important to concentrate on
		  music and artists that I felt were either very underestimated or relatively
		  unknown, and that were very special to me. We all know how hard it is to get
		  airplay if you're not happening ``at the moment.'' If you happened to hear it,
		  and there were any that you particularly liked, there is a detailed list
		  further on. [<I>See part iv, under influences/favorite artists</I>] In fact,
		  I'll be looking up a couple myself, as some of my copies are worn out. (1981,
