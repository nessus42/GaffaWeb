	 <P> <B> At present kate is writing a new album, but she's got no concrete

		<DD> Yes. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> A lot of people would have said that album was rather abstract and,

		had done. Did that influence you on your new album? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Very difficult to say. I don't know what influences you between one
		  and the other, except your life, really. You change with the environment and my
		  environment did change between the last album and this one: I moved out of the
		  city and into the country. And I think those two energies are very apparent on
		  both albums. The fourth album is very much an oppressed city atmosphere album
		  and this one just released is very much a freer elemental album. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Did you feel a real need to get out to the country then? </B></P>

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I was getting fed up with being in London, yeah. I don't know about
		  a real need, but I think it's a very good thing for me. I'm glad I did. It
		  certainly helped me relax as a person. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Did it drain your creative energies, then, being in the town?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, I don't think you can say that it drains your creative energies,
		  because if anything, and I'm sure a lot of people would agree with me, the
		  sense of oppression and energy that you can get from cities can be very, very
		  productive to writing songs. But, I found I was getting too many distractions
		  that was stopping me have the time to concentrate on my writing. So rather than
		  being productive, it was getting in the way. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Do you now commune with nature? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> [<I>Laughs</I>] I don't know about ``commune with
		<A HREF="../subjects/nature.html">nature</A>,'' but certainly when I look out
		my window and there's trees and fields I feel a lot happier than concrete
		blocks out there. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> When you see the trees and the fields, do you see a song as well?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Um...no. no, I think it's not quite as basic as that. There's no
		  doubt that when you're writing and you look out the window and there is that
		  force out there, that it does affect you very differently than if it was a city
		  or by the sea. Definitely your environments do affect you, much more than we
		  think. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> And of course, your working environments too. You've just designed
		and built your own studio. How are you finding that, working in your own
		studio? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's superb. There really couldn't have been better decisions made
		  in this time between the last album and this where I've moved and we've moved
		  the studio to where we are. There are so many areas where it's helped. Again, I
		  feel much more relaxed, much freer to work in an uninhibited way. I do get
		  quite nervous if you've got people you don't know coming in listening. In the
		  London studio, people always coming in borrowing pieces of equipment, the
		  phone's always ringing and it's costing you a phenomenal amount of money every
		  hour. So, you do feel guilty if you experiment, because you feel you're just
		  throwing money away. at home, obviously, there aren't those pressures at all.

		  wouldn't be to do with the business at all, it would be to do with myself as a
		  person, relationships, all that sort of thing. They're what concern me, that's
		  what would make me go under, I think. But no - I haven't... I don't feel that
		  is even relevant to things in my life because at the time when I took that
		  break, and I was writing these songs, it was one of the most content, happy
		  periods of my life for quite a while, in that I actually had time to breathe
		  and work creatively. And I think what's interesting is that I've always felt,
		  in the past - and it's almost a sort of code from certain areas of life - that
		  in order to write something, you know, that has meaning or whatever, that you
		  have to be unhappy, that you should be in some kind of torment. And what was
		  surprising was that for being actually very happy at this point in my life, I
		  felt I wrote some songs that were saying very different things from that.

		<DD> Since we last spoke, the weather has been incredible - it was the
		  best July since 1659, they say - but for me it's like 1976. Do you remember

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I was dancing every day, and singing and writing all night. I used
		  to go to London by train every day. It was the time of bomb scares, and
		  everyone would stare uneasily at unattended bags, and the trains were full of
		  paranoia. It was brilliant for me - I'd get back to my newly acquired
		  roommates, Zoodle and Pye, who were only kittens, then, and I'd open all the
		  windows and wail away all night. I only got one complaint from someone who had
		  to get up at 4:00 a.m., and as I was creating noisily until at least that time,
		  they were somewhat unhappy at their lack of sleep. But only that one
		  complained. </DD>

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I feel in many ways that '76 and this year are linked together, for
		  me. This year I've been seriously trying to work for an album, but found that
		  in the first part of the year I just needed to rest, really. It's hard to say
		  how I was feeling after the last album, but I needed to breathe. There are
		  always post-album blues, but this time I think I just wanted a break, just to
		  think and to gather stimulus for a new direction. After the demanding lands
		  that my last set of songs took me to, I had to think again about where to go -
		  maybe somewhere a little sunnier. I can honestly say I feel so much more
		  relaxed having had time to put my pieces back together; have some time with my
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A> and friends, which I was really
		  missing; and also to indulge in some books, films and records. </DD>

		<DD> After lasting three months on Chinese take-aways during the last
		  part of the album, I realised food was a terribly important factor to a healthy
		  mind and body. So now I make sure I cook one good meal a day, and have cut out
		  all junk food - which is unbelievable for me. It is definitely true that
		  convenience is not always a good thing. Cooking, especially when you're not
		  handling carcasses and gristle, can be a delightful thing. I always find it a
		  miracle to turn a few vegetables and some flour and margarine into a complete
		  meal - it's a bit like the five loaves and two fish. It's times like this, when
		  I'm doing a lot of cooking, that I realise how glad I am and how lucky I am to
		  be a vegetarian, to be eating nothing but fruit and vegetables - all the
		  wonderful colours and textures. Of course, the big trouble with cooking is
		  time, but I make myself set aside the time to cook an evening meal, and I
		  really miss it now if I'm out and not able to devour my nutritious foods, and
		  it'll take a while yet before I'll be able to handle a Chinese take-away. </DD>

		<DD> As you probably know, a trip to America and Canada was due, and was

		  probably meant to carry on with the album and perhaps also to have been able to
		  enjoy the first British summer for seven years. [<I>The papers printed stories
		  that kate's scheduled american trip was scratched solely because her planned
		  mode of transportation, the queen elizabeth ii ocean liner, was diverted from
		  its schedule for service in the falklands at the last minute. According to the
		  news reports, kate simply cancelled the america junket rather than consider
		  flying, allegedly because of an overpowering phobia of airplanes. Although she
		  does seem to have made such a decision, her heavy reliance on air
		  transportation up until this time discredits the stories of air phobia.

		  they take over you and they just drag me behind them till they're finished. And

		<DD> It has been a big gap between this album and the last one. I hit the

		  the new album, so the material would be different and interesting hopefully and
		  would not be the same energy as the last album, but would be something fresh
		  and interesting. I started working with a new dance teacher and spent a lot of
		  time equipping and building a recording studio which we've recorded all the
		  material for the album in. This was very much encouraged by my father who

		  it better you just have to be patient and spend more time with it. After the
		  last album at the end of '82, I'd just spent an intense period in the studio
		  doing an album. I wanted to get a break. I felt that I hadn't really had any
		  time to take things in because I'd been working so constantly, really since
		  1978 - and we'd just moved as well, out of London - so I wanted to spend some
		  time at home, see my friends, take in new stimuli, and try to create a new
		  energy for a new direction that would be different from the album I'd just
		  written. Also, I wanted to get together our own recording studio, which was
		  definitely something which was being pointed at all the way through the other
		  albums - that it was <CITE>the</CITE> thing to do. And I found that just during
		  that time that I was taking off to discover things right, get the studio
		  together, I made some of the most important decisions - and very beneficial
		  ones - that I have done. And I think it's all good, and I understand just what
		  you mean about that time, in that, in a way, you do get scared that you're
		  spending so long away that you won't be able to come back. But the priority -
		  and again, I really did feel that this was what I wanted during this time - was

		  working on should be the best it could be, at that time. </DD>

		  know that everything takes me such a long time to do! </DD>

		<DD> No, I was really involved in the design, and really the inspiration

		  did put a lot of it together himself, and he was in there building it and
		  advising on putting the studio together; and so really the studio is very much
		  a lot to do with his effort and enthusiasm. (1985, <CITE><A

		  it. And things like learning to drive, going to see a few movies - actually I
		  wanted to go to <CITE>see</CITE> people. Just to do those things that you don't
