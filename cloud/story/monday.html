		<DD> I have to get up early because the single is being cut. I have to be
		  at Abbey Road at two o'clock, and while I do the cut, the band go off to get
		  their army gear for `` Army Dreamers.'' Then we all go over to my parents' to
		  rehearse - there's no room for fu.ll-scale rehearsal in my flat. We do it in
		  the garden. That song is pretty well tied up by the evening, so I go home. I
		  generally get stuff ready for the trip. I don't take huge amounts of stuff with
		  me, just hand luggage. Waiting for luggage at the terminal roundabouts is such
		  a drag. Again, I get to bed around four a.m. _Tuesday _ The car for the airport
		  leaves at eight-fifteen, so I'm pretty wiped out. No one hassles me at the
		  airport. A few years ago there used to be loads of photographers, but they
		  don't bother me anymore. It makes things a lot easier, not having to walk up a
		  corridor with everyone going ``OOOH LOOK'' </DD>

		<DD> We arrive at about half one, and go straight to the TV station. I'm
		  not very successful in Germany, and it's a big market, so it's an important
		  show for me. Problems straight away. The stage has three tiers, which are going
		  to get in the way. It has a big glass section they want me to work on - I work
		  ninety-nine per cent of the time in bare feet, and there's this huge chunk of
		  broken glass in the middle. I say, ``no way, you'll have to get rid of it'' It
		  takes them half an hour to take it apart, and then I notice all these huge
		  staples sticking out of it, so I ask this guy to pull them out. </DD>

		<DD> The show starts at about eight - fill in the time doing my make-up,
		  sewing up little bits and pieces of my costumes that are falling to bits. I
		  like to do that myself, it saves time. I'm so pleased when the show is over,
		  and it went well. We go for a lovely meal courtesy of the record company.
		  Things like that normally aren't lovely but I enjoyed this a lot - really nice.
		  Leave the restaurant about one, go to the hotel, have a FANTASTIC bath and go
		  to bed about three. </DD>
