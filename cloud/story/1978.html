		<DD> A fascinating experience, SHE ENTHUSES, TWEAKING AN EARRING. NERVOUS
		  HABITS DIE HARD. The show was filmed in Cologne - a great place. The actual
		  studio was an old tram shed with an enormous stage. I did two songs. One with
		  my newly formed band and the other I mimed in backing tapes. For `` Wuthering
		  Heights'' we had backdrops which helped to set the scene. All these black
		  rolling hills with lightning bolts painted in and in the middle of it all this
		  dirty great big volcano. </DD>

		<DD> Well, the video we made for `` Wuthering Heights'' was probably
		  amongst the first ever made, certainly here in this country in terms of a
		  video, and I was very influenced at that time still by Lindsay Kemp. So it was
		  very much the dance influence that I was expressing. So it was really working
		  out choreography that would just look interesting, that would kind of create a
		  persona of Cathy. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> When I'm at the piano writing a song, I like to think I'm a man, not

		  they're both really male music and I'm not sure that I understand them yet, but
		  I'm really trying. When I'm at the piano I hate to think that I'm a female

		  what I'd like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. It's got to. I think that

		<DD> Not many females succeed with that. Patti Smith does but that's

		  musicians because I tend to think of female musicians as... ah females. It's
		  hard to explain. I'd just rather be a male songwriter than a female. What it is
		  basically is that all the songwriters I admire and listen to are male. (1978,
