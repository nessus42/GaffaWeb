		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I haven't really had that much training. The first thing I had
		  to do was with Lindsay Kemp and I just went to see a show one night. And it was
		  incredible! I couldn't believe what this guy was doing on the stage, in a
		  night. He was completely demanding the audiences attention... </DD>

	 <P> <B> He's the mime artist. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh, yeah, fantastic. I was just in tears at the end of the show. And
		  I went to some of his lessons and he just opened up a new world for me, the
		  fact that you can express so much with your body. And I thought, ``well you
		  know maybe I can combine that with singing as well.'' So I went along and
		  started taking some proper lessons because it's important to discipline your
		  body. And I did a couple years at a place in Covent Garden, like five days a
		  week. And I really enjoyed it. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> He taught me that you can express with your body - and when your
		  body is awake so is your mind. He'd put you into emotional situations, some of

		  drowning and there are waves curling up around you.'' And everyone would just

		<DD> I remember it so well. I saw this funny little guy up there on this

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, but that didn't happen until I was seventeen, because I didn't
		  really get on with the dance teacher at school. Once I'd left school I tried to
		  get into a dance school full-time, but no one would accept me as I had no
		  qualifications in ballet. I had almost given up the idea of using dance as an
		  extension of my music, until I met Lindsay Kemp, and that really did change so
		  many of my ideas. [<I>This is, as far as I am aware, the only occasion in which
		  kate explains that her ambition to merge her music with movement
		  <CITE>pre-dated</CITE> her exposure to kemp's work. Usually she simply credits
		  kemp exclusively for her inspiration. -ied</I>] He was the first person to
		  actually give me some lessons in movement. I realized there was so much
		  potential with using movement in songs, and I wanted to get a basic technique
		  in order to be able to express myself fully. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Lindsay has his own style - it's more like mime - and although he
		  studied in many ballet schools and is technically qualified as a dancer, his
		  classes and style are much more to do with letting go what's inside and
		  expressing that. It doesn't matter if you haven't perfect technique. (1982,

		<DD> It was through seeing a show that Lindsay Kemp did that I thought
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">dance</A> would be an extremely useful way of
		  expressing myself besides music, and if I wanted to be a performer, that would
		  help me a lot. When I left school, I started training as a dancer and working
		  on my music on a full time basis. I joined the dance class as one of the
		  students and really only trained with him for two or three months before he
		  went to Australia. From then on I got lessons when I could but went into a more
		  straight form of dance, learning contemporary dance, and touched on ballet and
		  just tried different things. (????,TWS) </DD>

		<DD> Well, I'd been writing songs for a long time and I was very happy

		  about <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">dance</A> until I decided to leave
		  school because I wanted to get involved in the music. So dance just came out of
		  the blue really,. I needed something to do, something to work on while I wasn't
		  at school and something that would complement the music. And dance, really,
		  just became the obvious thing. I was very lucky to go and see a show by Lindsay
		  Kemp and he really inspired a couple of years of hard work in dance schools for
		  me. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think very much the theatrical flavour came again from
		  Lindsay. Because he's surrounded by a strange magic, it's a very unusual
		  theatrical magic. And once you've seen a show of his or you've been involved
		  with him, it stays with you forever. It happens to everyone who works with
		  Lindsay. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir82_r2.html">Dreaming

		  that I wanted to push myself into my music, I thought one of best things that I
		  could do would be to learn to dance, because they're very close arts, music and
		  dance are meant to go together. And I went to see an incredible performance by
		  someone called Lindsay Kemp and then I suddenly realized that this was what I
		  was looking for, this sort of movement combined with music. So I took some
		  classes with him and then went on to The Dance Center, which [<I>Did exist then
		  ???</I>], and took lessons with a wonderful lady called Robin Kovak and a lot
		  of other teachers, and I've been going ever since really, on and off. (1981,

		<DD> No. Never. Within the first two weeks of trying - I went to this

		<DD> I don't know. There was a time, when I'd been dancing for about a

		  <CITE>now.</CITE> Because I had people approaching me at the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/dance.html">dance</A> class, asking if I wanted to go to

		<DD> Yes, I think so. I love the idea of a person during one lifetime
		  actually having three or four lives. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Within the same lifetime? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah. You see I feel that reincarnation is perhaps just a
		  continuation of that. Cause if you look at yourself or maybe other people, you
		  can see little circles, that maybe they emit the..., say there's fifty or
		  sixty, but these little circles have occurred each time, maybe in each phase of
		  their life. You know, where they get into a rut, and come around to a very
		  similar relationship to the one they had years ago, and it ends up in exactly
		  the same way. They start again, exactly the same thing happens, and they end up
		  where they are again. And it's something ... maybe that little complete circle,
		  and then break right away. </DD>

		<DD> And really, I mean, for myself, if I look at my life, in a way I
		  feel I've led almost two lives. Because the first part of my life was so
		  difficult, whereas the second part... </DD>

	 <P> <B> Which part? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> ...the second stage... </DD>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I would say from my life up until 16 and then from 17 up until
		  now have been two completely different stages. I mean I changed my Christian
		  name, become a vegetarian, left school, got into dance... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Really, what was your christian name? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, it's just that I used to be called Cathy and I became Kate.
		  And that was a very different stage for me. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Why would kate... Be more sorta tided into the vegetarian thing I
		suppose. </B></P>

		<DD> I don't know, but it actually created... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Did you lose lots of weight or something? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, no I didn't. I think just becoming called that name gave me a
		  chance to break away from the person I'd been before. I mean there's no doubt
		  that when people change their names, they actually do change. (1982, <CITE><A
