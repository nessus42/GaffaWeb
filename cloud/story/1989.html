	 <P><B> Probably [ the sensual world is out of touch with the current pop
		scene] because it's got a slightly ethnic feel, founded on kate's use of irish
		and bulgarian musics and musicians in the creative process. Perhaps because
		she's been free from pop for so long. Maybe because she's crossed the threshold
		of 30? </B></P>

		<DD> God! Yes. I'm sure it's all tied in with it, SHE LAUGHS. I think
		  it's a very important time: from 28 to 32-ish, where there's some kind of
		  turning point. Someone said that in your teens you get the physical puberty,
		  and between 28 and 32 mental puberty. Let's face it, you've got to start
		  growing up when you're 30, it does make you feel differently. I feel very
		  positive having gone through the last couple of years. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, hello. After such a long wait I just hope you won't be
		  disappointed with the album. Thank you all for your notes and the kind words
		  you sent during the making of the album - they all helped a lot. I've tried to
		  sit down and write about the tracks and found it extremely difficult - I guess
		  I've said it all in the songs - and for your interest we've printed an
		  interview I did with Roger Scott. It talks about the songs in a way I could not
		  write down. I think this interview is the most in-depth I've done, in some
		  ways. Roger is a lovely person, and he presents questions in such a way that
		  I'm happy to talk about things that with other people I might not want to touch
		  on. I also feel Roger did one of the best interviews I've been asked to do - it
		  was around the time of The Dreaming album. </DD>

		<DD> This album is my most personal, and I feel my most female so far. It
		  was very difficult to write the material, but some of the work on this album
		  has touched me more deeply - working with the Trio Bulgarka, meeting people in
		  Bulgaria who let us in to their homes and hearts, our work in Ireland, feeling
		  the tracks coming together through old friends like Pad, Stuart, Charlie, Al,
		  Dave Gilmour, and new friends like Nigel Kennedy and Davey Spillane. Many
		  difficult moments in my head with these songs, but so many warm feelings, and
		  my memories of all the people involved in this project are of us laughing. A
		  huge thank you to Del - what a long and intense project it was for us. I
		  couldn't have done it without him! It means a lot to me - he is my favourite
		  engineer. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Because of the intimacy with just Del and myself working so closely,
		  I feel this is the most direct communication I've had with the music in my head
		  and the music that comes back from tape. Also many thanks to Kevin Killen, who
		  became a close member of our small group. Kevin was wonderful to work with.
		  Sometimes it is hard to bring someone in to such a personal set-up, but Kevin
		  was so sensitive and enthusiastic and such a good mixing engineer. I really
		  couldn't have wished for nicer people to work with on all the stages of this
		  album. </DD>

		<DD> I've almost been me for the last couple of years, but, in the last
		  two weeks, I've been aware of people treating me as what seems to be a very
		  famous person. It's totally surreal, going into an isolated way of working,
		  three or four years at a time, then coming out and having everyone look at you
		  as if they know you. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's healthier for me not to indulge in being a famous person. It's
		  ridiculous. There's absolutely no reason why I should be at all, other than
		  that I make records. </DD>

		<DD> I find it extraordinary that people should want to write about me
		  when I do so little. I just pop out and do an album and go away again. (1989,

	 <P> <B> But bush will have to make some changes following the death of
		long-time guitarist alan murphy. He had played with long john baldry, level 42
		and go west. His textures provided the dark undercurrent and pointed
		punctuation on so many bush songs since 1979. He died shortly after the sensual
		world was completed. </B></P>

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> He was a guitarist who I felt used his instrument like a voice, SAYS
		  BUSH SOLEMNLY. But also like a chameleon, I guess. He could just change it into
		  anything. ``Al, I want you to be a racing car.'' Fine, he'd become a racing
		  car. ``Al, could you be this big panther creeping through the jungle?'' You
		  could throw any imagery at him and he would never balk, he would just be with
		  you, you know. Making albums will never be the same again for me without Alan.
		  I'll miss him terribly. I already do, as a person as well as a musician. (1990,

		<DD> Well, definitely my philosophy is to take things step by step. And
		  having finished the album, which I'm so relieved about, I'm kind of going
		  through the promotional work. And I guess a lot depends on how the album is
		  received. If it's received really warmly, then maybe [<I>Long pause</I>]...
		  Well, maybe I'll be absolutely thrilled. I should be so lucky. (1989, <CITE><A
