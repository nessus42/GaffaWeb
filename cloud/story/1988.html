		<DD> He had this tape of Bulgarian voices, three years ago, just when we
		  were finishing Hounds of Love. It was the most incredible thing I've ever
		  heard, beautiful. So I decided I wanted to work with them in some form in the
		  future... But it takes me a long time to digest ideas - even if I read a book
		  it maybe won't come out into a song until four years later. So I wrote a track
		  with a choir-synthesiser sound hoping that if we could get to work with them,
		  they would take the weight of the song from the synthesisers. (1988, <CITE><A

		<DD> I first heard the Trio Bulgarka when I'd finished the last album,
		  and I was devastated. I think everyone that hears it for the first time is;
		  it's *INCREDIBLY* powerful music. I listened to it for a long time, and started
		  thinking how nice it'd be if I could somehow work with them. </DD>

		<DD> I worked with Irish musicians before, and Irish music I think is in
		  my blood. My mother's Irish and my brother was always playing it when I was a
		  kid. I feel a real affinity for Irish music, and really knew nothing about
		  Bulgarian music until a few years ago. But when you hear it, and you relate it
		  to something like Irish music, there are a lot of similarities. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think the hardest thing about working with the Trio Bulgarka was
		  just having enough courage to go ahead and do it. Once I actually did that and
		  I met them I and worked together, it was heaven. It was so easy, we had
		  fantastic communication. You know what the language problem is like. But in
		  terms of music it was no problem. We just communicated emotionally and just
		  kind of cuddled each other and sang to each other. It was just the most
		  incredible experience to meet them as people as well as musicians, and to work
		  with women like that - on a creative level. The whole thing was very exciting.

		<DD> Also what was extraordinary was the arranger that we worked with,
		  Dmitr Penev. Without him I don't know if it would have been possible. Although
		  communicated directly with the girls, he was really the one who pulled all the
		  arrangements together. He was just fabulous, so enthusiastic! I'd say to ``I
		  want something like this...,'' and he'd think and go work on it, write
		  something out, and get the girls to rehearse and come back in ten minutes. He'd
		  come back and ask, ``Do you like this?,'' and he'd get the girls to sing thing
		  and I'd say, ``Yes that's absolutely brilliant,'' or ``we've got to work this
		  bit here.'' Again, the communication with him was extraordinary. He didn't
		  speak English either. There was just a tremendous musical chemistry I'd

	 <P> <B> She made contact with trio bulgarka through their british
		producer/promoter/friend/bragg-associate joe boyd of hannibal records, who
		released the <CITE>balkana</CITE> compilation in '87 and the trio's own
		<CITE>the forest is crying</CITE> lp earlier this year. Two weeks ago kate
		visited bulgaria and returned with the trio to record two tracks in london.

		<DD> I was very worried because chances were it might not work,
		  particularly because they're so good. It might just sound like we'd bunged them
		  in a Western track. I really didn't want them to be dragged down to my level. I
		  was worried that they wouldn't want to get involved with Western pop music,
		  because it has a bad name and a lot of people are initially scared of it... I
		  don't blame them at all. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> We had to get a special arranger (Dmitr Penev) because the beauty is
		  not just in the voices but also in the ancient arrangements. He was brilliant,
		  it couldn't have been better, the way we managed to communicate exactly what we
		  wanted despite language problems...It sounds corny, but I do feel very
		  honoured. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> The raw results of these sessions which I hear by accident, sound
		impressive. Any fears that bush might be dabbling in some sort of bulgarian
		``duck rock'' or even <CITE>graceland</CITE> territory are dispelled by the
		true spirit of the recording; The emotion of the trio's traditional singing is
		beautifully complimented by kate's distinctive vocal. The trio sing bulgarian
		words, so perhaps the azanian chorals of gabriel's <CITE>biko</CITE> would be a
		closer reference point, although there's not quite such a potent message here.

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> You're not distracted by words, all you're picking up are the
		  emotions that they're translating to you. It feels like very deep information.
		  There's one point when Yanka's belting it out, really fantastic, yet she's
		  singing something like, ``Marco sits down with his mother and has some bread
		  and jam!" </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> That's one of the strange things about bulgarian music. You find
		yourself sitting, listening, awe-struck, lump-throated, only to find you've
		been moved to tears by a song about a bumble-bee or a mosquito playing the
		bagpipes or dark-eyed yanka's marigolds ("I mislaid my kavals by your gates
		last night, elenke, did you see them?"). Whatever they sing about it always
		comes over as powerful, spine-tinglingly heartfelt (particularly their lament
		for the bulgarian robin hood indje voivode). Just listen and it's easy to
		understand why kate bush and others have been drawn to this music, this
		antithesis of producer pop for inspiration. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> If they sing ``Strati Angelaki'' to me I can't take it. I have to
		  leave the room, it just makes me cry and there are very few things musically
		  that affect me like that. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Rather than increasing the difficulties, the language barrier
		between kate and the trio seems to have promoted their personal and working
		relationship. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I've been so excited doing it and it's so lovely for me to work with
		  women as well, a tremendous difference. And because we can't talk
		  intellectually - we can't talk about the state of Bulgaria or even what the
		  shops are like in London - our whole communication is totally emotional. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's an incredible experience, the warmth they give you, you don't
		  often get it from Westerners. Here it's very much a communication of ``I have
		  this, you don't have that'' or ``I don't have that and you do,'' whereas they
		  want to know what kind of person you are... you can feel them probing your
		  heart. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Bush has, of course, experimented before with global ideas on odd
		tracks: ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/egypt.html">egypt</A></CITE>", ``kashka from
		baghdad", the aboriginally-inspired `` the dreaming,'' greek rhythms and
		portentous use of bulgarian teppan (drum) on `` jig of life.'' here, the
		bulgarian singers are playing a more central role than previous ethnic
		musicians (esmail sheikh, donal lunny, liam o'flynn, rolf harris), employed to
		compliment kate's attempts to create lasting pop rather than quick cash.
		</B></P> 
	 <P> <B> It's been a strange experience for trio bulgarka, who are more used
		to the familiar string drones of the gadulka or the strummed tambura or the
		piping gaida than to bush-style pop experimentalism. They seem, however, to
		have adapted with remarkable ease. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Yanka rupkina through interpreter borimira nedeva: Kate's very
		popular in bulgaria, young people like her very much. She sings emotionally.
		There's lots of lovely thinking in her writing and she's a very good musician.
		It is our first time with such a famous singer, and we hope we'll work with her
		in the future, if we haven't caused her too many worries. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> There's the distinct, appealing prospect of bush (in full bulgarian
		gear?) performing live with the trio; It's been donkeys since the theatre of
		kate was last seen onstage (benefits aside) but, she says, if anything could
		make me tour again it would be the people in this studio. (1988, <CITE><A

		<DD> They couldn't speak a word of English and I couldn't speak a word of
		  Bulgarian. Everything went through translators and it didn't matter at all.
		  Lovely working with women, and especially them, they're very affectionate. We
		  tended to communicate through cuddles rather than words. In fact, we could get
		  on perfectly well without the translators. At one point we were talking away in
		  the studio when the translator walked in and we all shut up because she'd
		  suddenly made us self-conscious about what we were doing. (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> She speaks in awe of all the musicians who support her, but none
		more so that the trio bulgarka, whom she feels are working on a higher plane of
		creation. We are talking big music here. We are talking real music, that goes
		back so far. I can't imagine who would have put music like this together. Way
		beyond me. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I suppose the main thing was getting up the courage to actually
		  approach the Trio. 'Cause I wanted to work with them so badly. But I was also
		  very scared that I wouldn't do them justice. Particularly in the context of
		  contemporary music. I really didn't want them to be belittled into pop music.
		  The kind of music that they are working with was in touch with something that I
		  think we've lost touch with. And it's very rarely now that you are affected
		  that powerfully by music, like that. Contemporary music occasionally hits you
		  in the heart and very, very rarely reaches your soul. But music like that is so
		  old, intense, powerful and spiritual - instinctive music, almost. You know, I'd
		  like to see anyone who could stand in the room with those three women singing
		  for more than twenty minutes and not cry. (1990, <CITE><A
