		<DD> The last album was the first one that I would actually hand over to
		  people with a smile, SHE SAYS, ALMOST SEEMING TO IMPLY THAT IT WAS THE FIRST
		  ONE SHE WAS ACTUALLY PLEASED WITH, and that was followed by a greater period of
		  non-creativity, when I just couldn't write properly at all. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It happened before, when the tour was over, and then I felt I'd just
		  given so much out that I was like a drained battery, very physically and tired
		  and also a bit depressed. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This time it was worse; a sort of terrible introverted depression.
		  The anti-climax after all the work really set in in a bad way, and that can be
		  very damaging to an artist. I could sit down at the piano and <CITE>want</CITE>
		  to write, and nothing would happen. It was like complete introspection time.

		<DD> I suppose I had about two months out earlier this year...and that
		  was a break I really needed. It gave me time to see friends, do things I hadn't
		  been able to do for three years. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It wasn't really as if I was missing out on normality, SHE LAUGHS.
		  I'd rather hang on to madness than normality anyway, so it was more like
		  recharging. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But something more came out of it than just a rest? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh yes! THE SMILE RETURNS. I felt as if my writing needed some kind
		  of shock, and I think I've found one for myself. The single is the start, and
		  I'm trying to be brave about the rest of it. It's almost as if I'm going for
		  commercial-type ``hits'' for the whole album. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> [<I>I have always been struck by this statement. It seems to me to
		indicate that kate really doesn't have a very sound notion of what is
		``commercial"- which is all to the good, of course. For if she felt that the
		dreaming had a <CITE>commercial</CITE> sound, then some listeners's criticism
		that she seemed to have developed a calculatedly <CITE>commercial</CITE> sound
		for the next album, hounds of love, loses credence, since her mental image of
		``commercial'' sound is so different from the sound of hounds of love. -

		<DD> Following the release of Never For Ever in September '80 I spent the
		  rest of the year promoting the album. After Christmas I had a short break and
		  then started writing songs for The Dreaming. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I wanted a big catalogue to choose from, so every evening I'd write
		  a different song, using a piano, rhythm machines and synthesiser. The whole
		  songwriting process was very spontaneous, and I ended up with about twenty
		  songs, from which I chose ten for the album. I spent more time than ever trying
		  to get the lyrics just right. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Due to the <A HREF="../subjects/nature.html">nature</A> of the
		material, kate had decided to produce the record herself, but evidently this
		added to the delay. She states: I used a lot of different studios to get the
		songs sounding just how I wanted them to, and I spent weeks putting different
		textures onto these tracks. (1984, <CITE><A

		<DD> After the last album, Never For Ever, I started writing some new
		  songs. They were very different from anything I'd ever written before - they
		  were much more rhythmic, and in a way, a completely new side to my music. I was
		  using different instruments, and everything was changing; and I felt that
		  really the best thing to do would be to make this album a real departure - make
		  it completely different. And the only way to achieve this was to sever all the
		  links I had had with the older stuff. The main link was engineer Jon Kelly.
		  Everytime I was in the studio Jon was there to helping me, so I felt that in
		  order to make the stuff different enough I would have to stop working with Jon.
		  He really wanted to keep working with me, but we discussed it and realised that
		  it was for the best. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Popix</A></CITE>)

		<DD> While I was working on this album I was offered a part in a TV

		  creative offer that has ever come my way. I <CITE>had</CITE> to turn it down -
		  I was already committed to the album. Sadly, I don't think that offer will be
		  made again, but you have to learn to let things go, not to hang on and get
		  upset, or to try to do it and then end up making a mess of everything else.
		  It's like wanting to dance in the studio when I'm recording - I want to but I
		  know that I can't because it will just tire me. I wish I had the energy to do
		  everything, SHE SAYS, SIGHING AT HER LIMITATIONS, but at least I'm healthy and
		  fit. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i82_ker.html">Kerrang!</A></CITE>)

		<DD> Mind you, I've been having a great time getting back into writing.
		  I'd forgotten how frustrating it gets. I seem to have accumulated a lot of
		  songs in the last few months, and am hoping to go into the studio and record
		  two or three with the hope that one will be a single. I feel - as far as an
		  album goes - that I still have a lot more to write. In many ways my recent
		  writing has been on an experimental basis. I've felt it so important to change
		  my attitudes to writing. I've been working much more with rhythmic ideas, and
		  at last I feel I am changing direction, slightly more towards the way I wish it
		  to go. It's difficult to explain, but sometimes the song will write me instead
		  of vice versa, so I don't always feel I've accomplished what I set out to; and
		  I'm trying to control this a little more. The addition of new toys to my work
		  has been invaluable. It's sad to say that I was reaching the point where I was
		  becoming bored with my ``patterns'' I think any writer sits in riffs that
		  become hard to move away from, and my new toys - such as rhythm box, analogue
		  delay system, CS-80 synthesiser - put some new magic back into it for me. </DD>

		<DD> It's great to hear some really good music coming back. Wasn't Phil
		  Collins's ``In the Air'' a masterpiece? [<I>Kate had been present at the
		  sessions for peter gabriels' third solo album, during which the distinctive and
		  now ubiquitous drum sound heard on ``in the air'' was developed by collins,
		  hugh padgham and gabriel. The influence of this drum sound is clear in kate's

		<DD> Piecing the album together is becoming like a big musical jigsaw,
		  and we're only halfway through. One particular phase at Abbey Road became
		  bizarre, as recording plus video met at the same point in time, and at the same
		  place. We'd been working on two tracks in the studio, just taking the odd day
		  and evening out for rehearsals; and with getting in early for meetings, it was
		  a very busy time for everybody. [<I>One of these tracks is `` sat in your
		  lap,'' for which the video was taped at abbey road. The first single for the
		  new album, it had not yet been released when kate wrote this part of her
		  article, although it had come out by the time the <CITE>newsletter</CITE>
		  reached fans. The other track kate refers to is `` night of the swallow'' (see
		  below). - ied</I>] Some days became very unreal, as, while going for a cup of
		  tea you would swear you heard the sound of tinkling bells as the tip of the
		  brightly coloured jester's hat disappeared around the corner. And once when I
		  ran out into the corridor, what should whizz by but a dunce on roller-skates
		  chased by four bulls who were being followed by a flying book and an
		  unbelieving door attendant. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The video was filmed over two days, one part at a video studio, the
		  other at the audio studios. The former provided the quick, easy technical sides
		  to be performed, the latter provided the space and presence. The large parquet
		  floor was to be a feature, and Abbey Road's past, full of dancing and singing
		  spirits, was to be conjured up in the present day by tapping feet to the sound
		  of jungle drums - only to be turned into past again through the wonder of
		  video-tape. The shots were sorted into a logical order: all long shots were
		  audio studio, all others were video studio. A storyboard was drawn up and was
		  very closely worked to, being hung on the wall on days of shootings. The
		  editing was a long, difficult job, as it was comprised of many sections which
		  had to be edited together (just like the big musical one). The editor worked
		  all day and into the next morning with great skill and patience, and only when
		  someone told us did we find out it had been his birthday and he'd worked it all
		  away. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> One of the exciting things about making the video was the
		  ``accessories'' we used, such as the lovely costumes and props. The jerk-jacket
		  which we used in `` Army Dreamers'' was used again for a short sequence, and
		  although there's a silver wire, it feels like flying. Out of the harness and
		  into the light of a timeless tunnel, as a little magician's box springs to life
		  and the room is filled with laser and skaters. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Meanwhile the album was still in progress: we were working on
		  backing tracks. We used all three studios for one of them [<I>" night of the
		  swallow"</I>]. It started with feeding the drums down into the largest studio
		  through speakers, and with microphones positioned near to them they were
		  brought back to the control room of the studio we were working in, sounding
		  very ambient. Then we found the piano and initial drum sounds too dead, so we
		  moved the drum kit and musicians to another studio downstairs, where we
		  preferred the sounds, and we set up. After getting all the leads from upstairs
		  connected to downstairs, there was one very tired and worn-out engineer
		  dedicatedly smiling through sleepy eyes, closely tailed by an equally smiley
		  and sleepy-eyed assistant. After all our hard work, the backing track sounded
		  great, and as the song is all about a swallow flying over the water, it seemed
		  only right to fly over to Ireland in a big, shiny bird, into the arms of
		  Planxty's magic. There for a day, due back too soon, and the big bird wouldn't
		  wait, so we worked all night. The pipes and whistles swooped and dived, fiddles
		  stole our souls away, and bouzoukis got us up onto our feet and made us bolt
		  the doors lest our souls flew away forever; and by seven the next morning the
		  track felt very proud of itself and there were tears in our eyes as we heard it
		  all back, and then were rushed back to London on the metal-winged thing. </DD>

		<DD> I went straight to the studio, and as I drooped over a hot cup of

		  overdubs, guitars, voices, instruments being whirled around and around,
		  becoming an aeroplane. And there was I, still back there, looking down at the
		  Typhoo in my china cup. </DD>

		  finding it difficult to work on this album, either. I have many visions of my

		<DD> I think the main reason for the problems is that we are

		  production is leading me further into the world of responsibility and trying to
		  be sensible. I really do enjoy the whole process, though, and that is why I do
		  it; otherwise it could be quite a relief to hand all the worries over to
		  someone else. But in my hear I don't want to - wrong or right, I don't know,

		<DD> One of the new feelings in me is wanting the album to be complete as

		  to hold on to it for every last moment possible until a deadline makes me leave
		  it alone. I think this new attitude is much more positive. Hopefully it will
		  help me to be more detached and objective about it all. It seems, too, that
		  because the album is behind, so am I with a lot of my other projects, but I
		  always do seem to be. I'm just glad that all my friends and the people I work

		<DD> Having worked on this album constantly for a long time, I reached
		  the point where I had lost all impetus - again, something I had never
		  experienced. I found it hard to even listen to the tracks. Some would call it
		  saturation point, the time to take a breather. I just needed to be normal for a
		  while, and get away from the intensity of the mole-life situation in the
		  studios. You can never tell what time of day it is in most studios, because
		  there are no windows to the outside. It could literally be any time, and the
		  studio environment is constant. I think this can tire you out mentally. Plus
		  the constant noise - not just the music but the hiss of tapes, the monitors,
		  buzzing lights. It's not until all the machinery is off at the end of the day
		  do you feel your brain relax and you suddenly realise all the sounds you have
		  been hearing without even realising it. That silence is like heaven. </DD>

		<DD> I felt like it was time to get out of London, so one evening, driven
		  by the desire to visit the Loch Ness Monster, we decided to act upon the
		  impulse of the moment and go as soon as we could. We travelled by train,
		  something very nostalgic for me. I don't often travel on trains now; obviously
		  it's not always easy for me to mingle, so I normally travel by car. We waved
		  goodbye to Zoodle and Pye in the arms of Lisa and Rob, and the train pulled

		<DD> Journeys overnight on ``public vehicles'' are always atmospheric.
		  Planes, ships, coaches, trains - for some reason they always make me think
		  about the past. The mechanical movement, the smells of upholstery, no real
		  traces of people being there before you but the knowledge that they have been.
		  Maybe it's to do with the process of leaving things; normally when things are
		  left behind or lost, there is a need to recall memories - maybe to assess if
		  your decision to leave or lose was correct or not. I think sometimes this can
		  be a sad thing, but I was very happy to be leaving London; and, cocooned inside
		  our sleeper-berths, away from the elements, we were off to Scotland. </DD>

		<DD> I've never really been to Scotland before - I have been there, but
		  I've not had a chance to see it. It is one of the most perfect settings I have
		  ever seen. Brilliant for film locations. In fact, in a spy programme we
		  recognised their so-called German border as being the road beside Loch Ness! At
		  that time of year, the trees of which there are so many are a multi-coloured
		  mass, with the cold winds challenging each leaf to turn a shade brighter before
		  it's torn away from its source of colour and has no choice but to fade away.

		<DD> There is so much to see, unlike those compartments where, when the

		  people die out, nature cleans up but she leaves their marks behind. Castles,
		  burial mounds, standing stones, monsters; and all surrounded by untouched land
		  bearing Nature's marks. Great gaps in the earth, revealing hard rock better
		  than any recorded on tape, and mountains that you can climb - maybe, as with
		  us, for the first time. </DD>

		<DD> Just as it was getting dark one evening, we pulled up by a sign at
		  the edge of the road. It told of a fort from the fifth century, B.C., the ruins
		  of which were in the heather-thick field beyond the sign. It also mentioned a
		  phantom battle which had supposedly taken place very near to the site. As we
		  were about to drive away, I noticed three lights in the sky, descending in a
		  diagonal line. Then they formed a horizontal line and remained static just
		  below a layer of cloud. There were huge circular orange lights; and we set off
		  in the car in hot pursuit. We thought maybe they were some kind of stadium
		  lights, but they were too near to the clouds; and we had never seen aircraft
		  with such big lights, nor that colour. </DD>

		<DD> As we turned a bend we could no longer see them, but kept our eyes
		  pinned on the sky. A few minutes later they came into view again, and this time
		  we could see that they were completely unattached to any form of structure on
		  the ground; and now there were only two lights. They remained stationary until
		  we lost them a little while later, for good. All the way back to the hotel our
		  heads were pointed out of the windows in anticipation of another sighting, and
		  we wondered if instead of finding Nessie on our search, we had found another
		  strange phenomenon. What do you think? </DD>

		<DD> The Loch itself is an unbelievable place. It's so beautiful, yet so
		  remote. The first day the water was like the sea, it was so rough. The Loch is
		  really big - twenty-three miles long, and they don't know how deep. They say
		  that sightings of the monster usually happen when the water is as still as a
		  mill pond, which seemed impossible when we saw the waves crashing around the
		  Loch. But on the last day it was so calm that it was like a twenty-three mile
		  long mirror, and our hopes were up. After a quick visit to the monster
		  exhibition, which features numerous photos taken of Nessie, we sat down beside
		  the Loch and discussed the stories we had heard from the locals about the
		  appearance of the monsters - for they say there is more than one. We had no
		  luck, but we did have the pleasure of seeing on the news some
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> - taken from a plane - of the Loch
		  Ness Monster under the water. It was very convincing, and was taken only one
		  week after we had been there. </DD>

		<DD> Abbey Road celebrated their 50th anniversary last month, quite an
		  achievement considering the ups and downs the music business goes through.
		  Helen Shapiro and I were asked to cut a cake they had made specially. It was
		  five foot by four foot, covered in fresh cream and kiwi fruit and topped with
		  fifty birthday candles. The studio, which has been filled with orchestras for
		  so many years, on that night was holding a choir of people who have loved Abbey
		  Road, a huge cross-section of fame and talent making their chitter-chatter
		  music-talk and completely filling the old studio - which is hard to fill
		  because it is so big. </DD>

		<DD> It was great for me to bump into faces I hadn't seen for a time, and
		  there were a lot I hadn't seen for a <CITE>very</CITE> long time. Geoff
		  Emerick, the man who engineered my first professionally recorded tracks, was
		  there; I hadn't seen him for years. He was wearing a white suit and was tanned
		  and smiling from working in exotic studios. </DD>

		<DD> Having cut a huge slice of cake, I started to cross the room that
		  was very hard to move in because of the swirling crowds. But with a cream cake
		  aimed at their party clothes, the room practically cleared like the parting of
		  the waters, revealing a white suit and some friends who looked like they needed
		  to eat some cake. However, because the cake had been under heavy camera lights,
		  the cream was beginning was starting to wither a little. But nonetheless it all
		  went within minutes. </DD>

		<DD> At the moment it hasn't got a title. It has been very hard to
		  produce because all the studios are so incredibly booked up, and because I
		  wanted to use one engineer only. This is the first album that I have actually
		  produced myself. </DD>

		<DD> Inevitably, this has meant a great deal more responsibility for me.
		  But it is a responsibility I like; I think that as soon as you get your hands
		  on the production, it becomes your baby. That's really exciting for me, because
		  you do everything for your own child. And I have been forced to think harder
		  about what is good and what is not so good. </DD>

	 <P> <B> I asked her if the vulnerability of that situation didn't worry
		her. Yes, in a way - but it is a stronger position, too, though I find that I
		now rely much more on other people's feedback - especially when I lack
		confidence about a song. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> In the past kate says she used to find that her words and music
		came together with ease - now they take far more time. I like to leave all my
		options open until the last minute so that I'm really sure - like about the
		title of an album, for instance. I'm taking a complete break from
		<A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">recording</A> at the moment, going over
		songs, tightening up lyrics and tunes, not going near the studio. I've worked
		on this album so intensely for so long that I seemed to be losing sight of my
		direction. I really wasn't sure what to do next - and that has never happened
		to me before. (1982, <CITE><A
