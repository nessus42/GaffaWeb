	 <P> <B> Paddy, surely you're not going to mind talking about your sister
		right in front of her like this. When was it you began to become aware not
		simply that kate was musically gifted, but that she was also a force to be
		reckoned with? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Right from the word go. She was about ten years old at the
		time. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> And did you and perhaps jay attempt to cultivate this gift in the
		hope that she might one day bear fruit? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Oh no, no, it cultivated itself. To cultivate music you have
		to spend a lot of time <CITE>by yourself,</CITE> making a lot of very strange
		sounds over and over again. It's not the sort of thing you go hammering into
		others. When there's a family all in one house and you're getting your music
		together, normally the others in the family close the doors and try to keep the
		sound out. And when you've got several people playing instruments in the same
		house, well, things can get a bit complicated! I remember having things thrown
		at me during the early days because I was playing the same tune for six months.
		It would get people down! And when kate began working on the piano, she'd go
		and lock herself away and wind up spending five or six hours, seven days a
		week, just playing the piano. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> You mean by now she was about thirteen or fourteen? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Yeah, and wow! I mean, at the age of thirteen or fourteen
		she was spending tons and <CITE>tons</CITE> of time writing, but starting in
		fact when she was about ten. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> And did this begin to assume almost pathological proportions and
		start alarming the <A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A>? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Absolutely! </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Kate: Pathological! </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Yeah! But no! Because of the heavy irish tradition in the
		<A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A>, I think it was escapism on her
		part. Our mother is irish and I think kate maybe felt, you know, that there was
		a slight obligation to appease the irish spirit. And somewhere out of my
		mother's imagination came the idea that kate should learn the violin. It seems
		to be a tradition that the violin is <CITE>forced</CITE> upon people. I mean,
		there are few who take it up of their own volition! And kate was certainly one
		of those who only took it up under pressure, she didn't really like it very
		much. So the piano was a kind of way of exploring music in dimensions
		diametrically opposite to what the violin must have <CITE>represented</CITE> to
		her. Escapism, pure escapism! You know, the command would be, ``go and practise
		on that violin, kate,'' but the piano music came out instead! I think perhaps
		we bushes are a bit like that... So yes, her piano playing was in the first
		place a direct reaction to straight music as we knew it, or as <CITE>she</CITE>
		knew it, at the time. The sort of style which she evolved in her piano playing
		and singing were direct opposites of all the kinds of straight music which she
		was being fed right then. Pure escapism, and very beautiful! </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> But then, kate, did your family soon come to accept what you were
		doing? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I used to go to my father and to Jay for opinions on my songs
		  and their feedback was very important to me. Jay is a writer, and he's written
		  some really beautiful things, and altogether he's been a big influence on me.
		  It was through his help that I got my first contact in the music business,
		  which led to my break, and now he deals with the business side of my work. And,
		  besides putting lots of good ideas my way, he's introduced me to a lot of
		  artists who probably otherwise I would never have heard of, and of course
		  hearing new music can be a very big influence. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Going back to the piano, surely your playing didn't evolve in a

		<DD> Well, when I was about twelve, that sort of age, I was such a big
		  fan of Elton John. I think really he was the first musical hero I had in that I
		  aspired so much to what he was doing. I was just sort of starting to muck
		  around writing songs, and then I saw this guy and he was the only one I'd ever
		  seen who wrote songs <CITE>and</CITE> accompanied himself on the piano. And his
		  playing was <CITE>brilliant,</CITE> and still today I think his playing is

	 <P> <B> You never sing a song straight. Are there singers whom you studied

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I would really be missing the point if I didn't mention Bryan Ferry,
		  because I thought he was the most exciting singer that I'd heard. His voice had
		  limitations, but what he managed to do with it was beautiful, I mean,
		  b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l. For me it covered the whole emotional spectrum, and I just

		  voice and lyrics, and Eno there in the background - <CITE>magic!</CITE> </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> But kate, I'm very curious. I know you grew up listening to artists
		like bowie, bolan, dave edmunds, roxy music, elton john, all that sort of
		stuff. Yet in my opinion you're so much more musically eloquent than people
		like that. Your music has a depth and complexity, also a certain opulence,
		which aren't easily attributable to pop music and which suggests to me that
		perhaps there are a quite different set of aesthetic values underlying it that
		you've assimilated somewhere along the way, perhaps even deriving from
		classical music or opera. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I think in a way that classical music is, if you like, a sort of
		  superior form of music because it has so much <CITE>space</CITE> for the
		  listener to move around in. I think as soon as you have words in a song, it's
		  somewhat restricting for the listener. And I really
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> listening to classical music because,
		  actually, I find it quite inspiring for my work. So maybe because I love those
		  things so much, I suppose they do tend to rub off on me... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> I see, so you think they just rub off. It's not as if you are
		extrapolating classical formulae into your own music with any knowing intent?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, I do think that a lot of classical music is so good that it
		  challenges you. When I hear something really beautiful, I think, wouldn't it be
		  great if I could write something even just a little bit like that! So I'm sure
		  that's what it's all about. It's not really copying but, rather, wanting to
		  produce that same kind of, well - vibe. To try and get the same kind of
		  atmosphere which that music creates when you listen to it. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Did you have much of a formal education in music? Are you capable
		of comprehending your own work in terms of music theory? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, I do know what chords are, basically, but I've not really had
		  any classical training at all. My knowledge of theory comes from when I learned
		  the violin when I was little, and that's about it. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Paddy: You see, really our roots are in the oral tradition. I mean,
		that's the way music is carried on in our family. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Kate: Yes, I think there are an awful lot of major influences
		deriving from traditional music, especially english and irish folk music.
		'cause when I was very little my brothers were devoted to traditional music and
		it's something I've always loved and still love. Especially irish music, which
		I love very much. I think I was always impressed by the words in folk songs. I
		mean, even when I was very little I was aware that the songs had great words.
		They're always stories, each song is a story, not like the lyrics of most pop
		songs. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> And did you yourself play things like accordions and concertinas?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> No, Paddy used to have a big collection of them and occasionally I
		  used to sneak up to his room and have a quick play when he wasn't there. But
		  really, Pad would always play those sort of things, and I always stuck to the
		  piano. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> On different album tracks you've featured not only irish musicians
		but also an array of other ethnic sounds. Does this betray a lot of your own
		listening? Are you listening to a lot of pretty far-out stuff, music for
		example of aboriginal, oriental, or comparable ethnic origin, and deliberately
		seeking to integrate that into your own music? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, I don't think I am really. There was a period when I used to
		  listen to certain ethnic music. But I don't think I was ever really an avid
		  listener. Paddy is much more of an avid listener to ethnic stuff, he listens to
		  it nearly all the time. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, that's right. My father played the piano, and we also had an
		  old harmonium in a barn next to our house, where I'd spend a lot of time just
		  pedalling away hymns. I really loved their melodies and harmonies and worked
		  out for myself that a chord was made from a minimum of three notes, and that by
		  changing one of these notes you could get completely different chords to work
		  with the new note. In a way, that started my interest in the way things could
		  sound and feel very different just by putting different chords to a tune. As
		  the harmonium got eaten up by mice, less and less of the stops that selected
		  the sounds worked, so naturally I turned my attention to playing the piano.

		  and got on with it myself very well. I've now been playing the piano for many
		  years, and I really did start off in the most basic way. After a couple of
		  years I'd got a slight style, and since then I've simply developed it more,
		  just by writing and then practising playing the songs. Often, I'd be writing

		  there was actually a plan to the keyboard that was so easy to see, that was
		  like playing one finger on the notes and then singing that tune. And then

		<DD> I suppose I must have been fifteen, and my family felt it would be

		  of the family we made contact with Dave Gilmour who came and listened. At that
		  time he scouting for talent, and I think he felt I was sufficiently talented to
		  put up the money in order to properly produce three tracks and through those
		  tracks I got a recording contract. (????, TWS) </DD>

		<DD> A friend of the family, Rickie Hopper, introduced us. Absolutely
		  terrified and trembling like a leaf, I sat down and played for him. But Dave
		  liked my songs very much. He put up some money, sent me into the studio to make
		  three really well-produced tracks. I did `` The Man With the Child in His
		  Eyes", `` The Saxophone Song", plus some obscure thing which ended up on a B
		  side somewhere. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I did some recording at her house, her parent's house, and then I
		  had her up to my studio and recorded some things. I decided that the way she
		  sang and played the piano, just on its own, was not going to be very effective
		  for convincing A men at record companies of her value. So, I decided to pick
		  some songs out of all the songs that she had and go in and record them properly
		  in a recording studio with an engineer, a producer, an arranger and an
		  orchestra. I organized all that, chose some songs and recorded three tracks
		  which I then played to the EMI people over here and they made a deal with her
		  and signed her up. It's quite simple. The three tracks that I had recorded, I
		  sold them to EMI as well, and two of them were on her first album. One was
		  ``The Man With the Child in His Eyes'' and one was called ``The Saxophone
		  Song'' </DD>

		esoteric audience. But she had different ideas. (c.1983, chez david gilmour
