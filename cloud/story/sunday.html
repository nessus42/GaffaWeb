		<DD> Sunday is definitely the day that I have to physically work out.
		  When I get up I can hardly stand up. My calves are beginning to feel sore from
		  the night before. </DD>

		<DD> Again, I get up around early afternoon. I don't bother buying Sunday
		  newspapers - I don't read newspapers much at all, though if there's one around
		  I'll read it. I don't read books very much either. I have a big guilt thing
		  about that - I'm missing out so much, I read fact rather than fiction, usually
		  when I'm on holiday. I tend to read religious things or theories on the
		  universe. [<I>This sounds like an early reference to stephen hawking, whose
		  book, kate has since explained, partially inspired her 1989 recording,
		  ``<CITE>deeper understanding</CITE>.'' another example of the long gestation
		  periods typical of kate's work.</I>] I love Don Martin (of <CITE>Mad</CITE>
		  magazine), he cheers me up. And if there's a <CITE>Beano</CITE> around, I've
		  just got to look at it. When I was a kid that was really my thing. The
		  illustrations are really great. </DD>

		<DD> I spend all the day working out the routine for `` Babooshka.'' All
		  Sunday is working out - dancing and miming. For miming you have to get the
		  inflexions exactly right. I don't do that in front of mirrors, though. I hate
		  watching myself sing. It's really weird. I also do more work on `` Army
		  Dreamers.'' Gary, the dancer who's in <CITE>Godspell,</CITE> rings me up - and
		  I've been sending out messages for him to ring me all day. We have this weird
		  telepathic thing with the telephone. Whenever I want him to ring and whenever
		  he wants me to ring him I get these ``messages'' So he rings up and says,
		  ``I've been getting these messages all day, what's the matter?'' I tell him
		  that we've been trying to work out these routines, and quite honestly it would
		  be useful to know what he thought of them. He says he wants to see me anyway,
		  so he comes around at about midnight. He gets home at about five or six in the
		  morning. I have a bath and go to bed. </DD>
