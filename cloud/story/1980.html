	 <P> <B> Peter gabriel had introduced her to the ``rhythm box'' when they
		worked together on songs like ``no self control'' and ``games without
		frontiers'' It was the micro-chip that set everything in motion. Kate
		experimented with oscillators, sequencers and the like. This whole new world,
		kate marvelled, struck me with awe. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> But don't expect her to adopt the showroom dummy-style dour faces
		and a relentless electronic bleep. Her aim is to combine the old with the new,
		craft with discovery. As she explained: I'm very fond of nostalgia and new
		sounds. But I'd like to apply the future to nostalgia rather than the future to
		the future. (1981, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i81_wid.html">what I did on my

		<DD> Offstage he's very normal, and that's the kind of thing I believe

		<DD> I was thrilled to do it, and it's not often that I meet people in
		  the same position that I can relate to. It's not like relating to people at
		  EMI, as they're on a completely different side of the fence. (1981, <CITE><A

		<DD> The first stage of making Never For Ever happened last summer, when
		  I actually decided to be brave enough to go ahead and ``produce'' with Jon
		  Kelly, trusting him as a friend and an extremely talented engineer. (1980,

		<DD> So, with that settled, we ``produced'' our first master tapes. We
		  put down ``Blow Away", `` Egypt", `` Violin", and `` The Wedding List'' at Air
		  Studios, with the bright and bubbly Jon Jacobs as assistant. As you will see
		  besides communication, ``Jons'' are also a theme of the album. Never a day
		  passed without at least two or three Jons popping in to say hello, and as the
		  album grew, so did the number of Jons, reaching a total of fifteen turning up
		  on the last day, <CITE>all</CITE> in the same room. A fatal move to say,
		  ``John?" </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Having been rehearsed with the band for two days, the tracks went
		  down, and our first ``productions", with the help of ideal musicians, were a
		  success. All the tracks full of ``Air'' and ``space", Jons and tea! </DD>

		<DD> Early this year we moved into Studio number 2, Abbey Road - the land
		  of Beatles, tea, smiles and sticky buns - where we met another bright and
		  bubbly John, John Barrett. John became an important part of the album and
		  completed a threesome, like Teddy with Andy Pandy and Loopy Loo (Jon Kelly and
		  myself). </DD>

		<DD> I would always use a notepad with each page designated to a song,
		  each song needing various instruments, effects, harmonies, etc., which I would
		  list and tick off appropriately. This helps my memory, and keeps some kind of
		  logical working order. Thanks to dear Andrew Powell, where I learnt the
		  necessity for a ``prod.'s pad'' </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The basic process is to put down all the backing tracks first. Then
		  all overdubs, including vocals, and then to mix. The responsibility as a
		  producer was something I felt a great deal - you have to keep on top of
		  everything, and <CITE>sometimes</CITE> it can be difficult. It's hard to push
		  people you love; talking and drinking are easy to give in to. But the trouble,
		  sometimes, was we were having too much fun. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We always work until the early hours in the studio. It's a very
		  creative time, and with Roy Harper and Sky working at Abbey Road, too, we were
		  rarely alone, and felt very at home. However, discipline did exist, so all was
		  completed with care and tender hearts. I really deeply appreciated the
		  understanding and respect from all the musicians, and after all I am only
		  little, a female, and an unlikely producer! But as I squirmed and contorted my
		  way through explanations of visuals and audials, they stood patient, calm and
		  open, and <CITE>not one</CITE> uttered ``You weirdo!", unless in jest. (1980,

		<DD> Hello. Can you feel spring beginning to happen? Every day on the way
		  to the studio I go past a winter tree, surrounded by lots of yellow and purple
		  crocuses, and it makes my eyes spin with the colours. </DD>

		<DD> Things are going well with the album. Although we've still got lots
		  to do, we can feel the tracks speaking to us more and more - telling us what we
		  want to hear. It's very exciting being so involved in something you
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>. Doing the production with Jon Kelly
		  is a fabulous combination and the room is always full of Jons, as our assistant
		  engineer is called Jon, too, and often our visitors are donned the name Jon!

		<DD> The next visual event is a Dr. Hook special. I hope to depict two
		  new songs from the album, with the help of Paddy for one. It should be lovely
		  to meet Dr. Hook as I've heard nothing but praise of them as people. One of the
		  things I've enjoyed this last year was to work with other artists on their
		  projects. Isn't Peter Gabriel's single [<I>"Games without frontiers"</I>]
		  fantastic? I can't wait to hear his new album [<CITE>Peter Gabriel</CITE>
		  NUMBER 3]. Peter is an extremely talented and lovely man, and to work with him
		  was really fun and a great experience - as it was to do some vocals on Roy
		  Harper's new album [<CITE>The Unknown Soldier</CITE>]. I've been a fan of Roy's
		  music for years, as have all my family, and to work with him on his music was
		  very special. (1980, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate6.html">KBC 5</A></CITE>)

		<DD> We've almost finished the album and I'm on holiday for a short
		  while. The Club convention was great. I came along just at the end, when
		  everyone had been there for hours, and it was a strange feeling going along to
		  something where people that you know very well had been for hours watching you,
		  although you weren't actually there. When I got onto the stage it was
		  incredible. There were so many people, and they all looked so happy, and I felt
		  really nervous - much more nervous than I do for gigs, because I didn't know
		  what I was going to say. It was fantastic: it was like we all knew each other,
		  and I thought the best thing we could do was to scream and try to take the roof
		  off. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There was a lot of effort put into the convention, particularly by
		  Terry Walker and Bill Clark, and that was so useful because it made it what it
		  was. Without the effort it wouldn't have come across so professionally and
		  people wouldn't have had such a good time. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I've been doing lots of crosswords! I got into that while we were
		  doing the album. We'd do a crossword every day, and now I can't not do them.
		  And I've come out in spots and I'm not sure if that's because I'm eating too
		  much chocolate or because my system's spitting out the city. My skin feels full
		  of the city - I can feel it oozing out, but here the air is so seablown and
		  new, I feel it's helping to get me fit and awake. </DD>

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But before the album's finished and released, there will be another
		  single - sometime in June, probably. We're a bit sad about the delay, but
		  there's such a lot of good music around - it's going to be a summer full of
		  music! (1980, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate7.html">KBC 6</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> I can't believe it, still. Every time I tell someone I feel like I'm
		  lying. I couldn't have asked more for such an important step in what I'm doing,
		  because I feel that this album is a new step for me. The other two albums are
		  so far away that they're not true. They really aren't me anymore. I think this
		  is something the public could try and open up about. When you stereotype
		  artists you always expect a certain kind of sound. </DD>

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I'd really like to be able to leave myself open to any form of
		  music, so if I wanted to, I could do funk tracks on the next album, I could do
		  classical, I could do bossa novas. I think it's best to stay as open as you
		  can. As a person I'm changing all the time, and the first album is very much
		  like a diary of me at that time - I was into a very high range. The same with
		  the second album, and I feel this is perhaps why this one is like starting
		  again. It's like the first album on a new level. It's much more under control.

	 <P> <B> You took a long time doing it. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, it did. It took a lot of work, but it was very beautiful work
		  because it's so involving and it's so like emotions. It's totally unpredictable
		  and you can fall in love with it or you can hate it or if you want to you can
		  ignore it: you know, all the things that you can do with people. (1980,
