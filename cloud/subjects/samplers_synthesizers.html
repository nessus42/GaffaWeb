		<DD> Duncan MacKay introduced the synthesizer, Fender Rhodes, Prophet and
		  harpsichord in my songs. I've used the synthesizer in particular because it was
		  part of the new music at that time. I must admit I'm now much less interested
		  in synthesizers, especially since the Fairlight CMI. I just find a lot of the
		  sounds that perhaps before were interesting a little too machine-like. What
		  attracts me to the Fairlight is its ability to create very human, animal,
		  emotional sounds that don't actually sound like a machine. I think in a way
		  that's what I've been waiting for. </DD>

		<DD> Richard Burgess of <CITE>Landscape</CITE> [<I>A shortlived but
		  musically adventurous techno-pop duo of the late 1970s-early 1980s</I>]
		  introduced me to the CMI at Syco Systems in London, and Steve Payne, who works
		  there, has helped me a great deal with it. I've now got my own Fairlight which
		  I use - the problem was, having met the Fairlight on my last album Never For
		  Ever (played by Duncan Mackay) I'd realized that it was invaluable for my
		  music. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> In many ways it is, although I think piano still holds above it
		  because for me it's more versatile than any kind of synthesizer. It's like an
		  old friend in a way. Often a certain sound that you want on a synthesizer for a
		  particular piece can be distracting when I'm composing, and it's nice to use
		  the piano instead, because it doesn't conjure anything up in particular; then
		  later translate those ideas to a synthesized sound. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Occasionally you've used the yamaha cs80 polyphonic synthesizer

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I would never say that I'm really that knowledgeable about the CS80.
		  I've mainly used it with the pre-set sounds. What I like about it is its
		  velocity/pressure keyboard sensitivity - it makes it much more ``human.'' A lot
		  of its sounds have more emotion, too, perhaps from its dual sound-layering,
		  although mainly it's the touch sensitivity. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> Right, I didn't have my own Fairlight and we had to hire one in. And

		  really couldn't do without because it was just so integral to what I wanted to
		  do with my music. I think I've always enjoyed synthesizers... I found them very
		  interesting, but I never really enjoyed all the sounds. And what really gets me
		  about the Fairlight is that any sound becomes musical. You can actually control
		  any sound you want by sampling it in, and then being able to play it. I mean
		  obviously, it doesn't always sound great, but the amount of potential
		  exploration you have there with sounds is never-ending, and it's fabulous.

		<DD> Yes, very much so. I think it was one of the best thing to happen

		  I start writing the song, but also from an arrangement point of view, where if

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It gives me much more control over arrangements, particulary. And it
		  effects so many different areas. As soon as I start writing now I'm working
		  with a sound that is sparking off a particular atmosphere. When you sit down
		  and write at the piano, the sound of the piano is not as different as brass and
		  strings, etc. And I think it really effects the whole flavor of the song. Like
		  the difference between writing on the piano and a guitar, but maybe amplified
		  by a hundred times because of all the different sounds that you have. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> There were very few tracks on this album that I wrote on the piano.
		  ``Running Up That Hill", `` Hounds of Love", `` Watching You Without Me'' --
		  most of them were Fairlight based. `` Cloudbusting'' I wrote on the Fairlight
		  and I just felt it would be much more interesting with real strings, so we
		  transcribed the Fairlight arrangement from string players to reed. And then
		  they redid it. </DD>

		<DD> I've heard some of Simple Minds stuff, yes. I think the Fairlight is
		  one of those instruments that is definitely in there now. When it first came
		  out it was so expensive that I think it prohibited people from getting close to
		  it, getting to know it. But it seems to have conquered that barrier now, it's
		  available in studios, at least, and people can get to use it. And I think it
		  will be on so many things from now on. (1985, <CITE><A

		  with this album, that most of the songs were written on Fairlight and synths
		  and not piano, which was moving away really from the earlier albums, where all
		  my material was written on piano. And there is something about the character of
		  a sound - you hear a sound and it has a whole quality of it's own, that it can
		  be sad or happy or... And that immediately conjures up images, which can of
		  course help you to think of ideas that lead you on to a song. So
		  <CITE>everything</CITE> is crucial for trying to find some direction with
		  inspiration, and really sounds, now, I think are pieces of gold for people, you

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Quite often I find synthetic sounds create a coldness, that if the
		  track is lonely or sad or dark, sometimes you want that kind of coldness, that
		  machine-like coldness, which is very specific. And with acoustic instruments
		  you get a real - normally - a very warm, human presence and something that's
		  intimate and really there, something that breathes, you know, it's not this
		  kind of dead, cold, machine. And I feel that both are very usable, depending on
		  what you want to say. (1991, <CITE><A

		<DD> The Fairlight was incredibly important because it was really what I
		  had been looking for but had never thought possible. I used to play the piano,
		  and the only instruments I had to work with from that were the piano and my
		  voice. So I used to put a lot of emphasis on backing
		  <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html">vocals</A> and arrangements on the piano,
		  because they were - in a way - trying to be violins and trumpets, and my voice
		  was trying to be strings. That's all I had to work with. I was into the CS-80,
		  but I really didn't like synthesizers as such, because they weren't natural
		  sounds, and that's what I really loved. Discovering the Fairlight gave me a
		  whole new writing tool as well as an arranging tool, like the difference
		  between writing a song on a piano or on a guitar. With a Fairlight you've got
		  everything, a tremendous range of things. It completely opened me up to sounds
		  and textures. And I could experiment with these in a way I could never have
		  done without it. It would have cost too much money. The Fairlight gave me a
		  very private experimental instrument. (1990, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> What kind of things have you been doing with the fairlight?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I use the Fairlight in a basic way, really. What really appeals to
		  me most is the idea of having any sound that is available put into the
		  Fairlight. And I use it mainly as I would my piano. So it's finding the sound I
		  want, which can take ages- that's the most difficult thing - and then working
		  around it musically to make it suit the song. When I'm writing a song around
		  it, normally I just use chords with a quite simple Fairlight sound. And then if
		  I want to build up things, I'll do small overdubs just as we go throughout the
		  album, with the Fairlight being dragged in every other week. So in the writing
		  process, the main Fairlight sound goes down even on the demos. You find the
		  sounds that work for overdubs at a later date. For me, the ideal is the
		  combination of Fairlight and acoustic instruments, rather than it being all
		  electronic or all acoustic. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Are you using sounds that they give you with the fairlight, or have
		you been sampling your own? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Some of the presets that they supply are actually quite good. But
		  there's one favorite that everyone is using, called ``Orch. 5'' or something.
		  Every time anyone who has a Fairlight hears it they go, ``Oh,no! Not again!''
		  There are a couple of good preset sounds, but I think that the most exciting
		  thing is actually recording sounds and sampling them in. Quite often the nature
		  of the sound changes when you put it in the Fairlight, but that in itself can
		  be quite interesting. </DD>

		<DD> There's a human element in that album that's quite a... sort of
		  tormented human looking for, you know, how to sort out all these problems and
		  pain. And I think it's... these sounds are right, the human sounds, the
		  sensitive emotional sounds. It's quite an emotional album really, and I just
		  want to suit it. I think that the combination of very acoustic real sounds and
		  very hard electronic sounds is fabulous too. I like to create contrasts and
		  extremes for the atmosphere that you're building around a particular song.

		  get them to sound good on tape. But I like Bechsteins, and I think Steinways

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> At least six or seven of the tracks on this new album have been done
		  in totally different ways. There's one track that I literally wrote on the
		  Fairlight and then re-did things completely with strings. And the drums, which
		  were originally Linn, were re-done with a live drummer. Then there's another

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I suppose it's when I get the voice and lyrics on, they tell me what
		  to do. I thought, um... Although the Fairlight strings were interesting, they
		  didn't have the... the warmth and the intimacy that the song required, and...
		  it sounded a bit bland on the Fairlight. That particular song was a very
		  intimate one. It needed... a wooden, human error, you know, the fact that it
		  wasn't always on the beat, and that there was this group of people working
		  together creating that sound. I do feel that in most cases when you've got a
		  brilliant musician and an instrument you really... I mean, what's the Fairlight
		  there for? I think it... it's a different purpose, to me anyways. I don't feel
		  I want to create the world's greatest cellist on the Fairlight. You know, I'd
		  rather get a really good cello player in, and record him with a good engineer,
		  and then use the Fairlight to do something that complimented that. The most
		  exciting thing for me is the combination of real and natural sounds and
		  extremely electronic synthesized ones. It's just the blend of two worlds that I
		  find fabulous. In the next few years, it's going to be really lovely to see how
		  people start working these things. We've been in a real synthetic era for the
		  last three years. People have been interested in the new advances in
		  synthesizers. It's really exciting, and I think it's got people so wrapped up
		  in electronics that now perhaps will come the time when the blend will happen.

	 <P> <B> What about the idea that you may not be create the best cellist on
		the fairlight, but that you will be the cellist? It won't be pablo casals'
		expression, it will be kate bush's expression? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I think that could be interesting, but I also think that could
		  be boring. On this album I've done so much of the work that I really enjoy
		  other people's input. I find it boring, actually, to have to work with my ideas
		  all the time. The great thing, again, you can do with the Fairlight that I
		  enjoy so much is I can write a piece on it, say, with an acoustic guitar or a
		  cello, and I can write it out, and then I can get a musician in to actually
		  play that. So he's playing what I've written, but he's doing it much better
		  than I could do. You see, without the Fairlight, I probably couldn't have
		  written these parts before. I would have written them on the piano and they
		  wouldn't have had the feel of the strings, or acoustic guitar. And at the same
		  time, you know I don't think me playing them on the Fairlight is as good as
		  these people. But it's an interesting blend. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Do you feel you have a better understanding of how these people

		<DD> Well, certainly in my experience, it's given me the most incredible
		  insight into composing and how instruments work. And I think it's sort of... If
		  you're not careful it can give you an arrogance as well, where you're sort of
		  sitting there playing all these drums and thinking, ``Hey, you know, why can't
		  you do this?", you know - like it's so easy. On the other hand, you know, there
		  are little inflections that would be so difficult to get on the keyboard. I
		  mean, you could probably get it to sound very close, but it... it might... just
		  not sound like the real instrument. A lot of natural instruments, that's what
		  it's about. It's the inflection of the musician, the way he works it,
		  personalizes it. I mean, you know real instruments should never die. I don't
		  think they can. That's what all these electronic things have come from. They
		  should go hand in hand. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Do you compose on paper or right into the fairlight or tape
		machine? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's really in my head first and then onto the tape machine. I only
		  compose onto paper when it's an instance like a guitar or cello, where I play
		  in real time to the track, and then when I like what it is, I'll write it out
		  for someone to play. If it's me playing it, I don't bother to write it out. I
		  work much better in my head. It takes me hours to write things out. I'm so
		  slow. But writing it out is a very accurate way to get them to do what you want
		  very quickly. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Production was a logical extension of my desire to make sure that my
		  songs sounded exactly as I heard them. When you write something, you want it to
		  be in a style that is the most precise, the most complete, the closest to your
		  original idea as possible. Each element that goes into the track affects it for
		  better or worse. I discovered that in involving myself in the process of
		  following up on my music, it was necessary to become the producer, which,
		  today, is only one supplementary aspect of my job as author-composer. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Technology is a valuable aid for me. The Fairlight is, for me, a
		  marvelous invention which has allowed me to greatly develop my capacities as
		  arranger and composer. Electronic drums have changed my life, as well. After
		  that, it was natural to have my own studio, so as to be able to work naturally,
		  in tranquility, in proximity to the origins of my songs. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Kate's fairlight conversion seems to have cut down on the appetite

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> For me, what is so good about it, is it's a machine you can sample
		  any sound you want into it. Say, you can sample a car horn or a violin, and
		  then just play it on the keyboard. It's useful not only for when you're writing

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I think it's a good thing and I think it's going to develop very

		  superior sounding things so that there's as little noise as possible. I think
		  it's probably going to have quite an effect. But I think synthesizer did. When
		  synthesizer were introduced, music was so inspired by it, that the synthesizers
		  were over everything. It was quite a stampede, because you have the medium, and
		  I think probably the same thing will happen with the Fairlight. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Technology is certainly bringing good sounds and sophisticated

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes. I think technically right across the board, not just in music,
		  we're going into another stage. There's no doubt that things are just gonna
		  go... You know, you think even in the last ten years things have really
		  developed, that I think we're actually just on the front of a whole new world

	 <P> <B> The reason for this inquiry is that I think your comments are

		  people in the business know straight away - there's a kind of corny edge to it.
