		<DD> Yes, I did enjoy producing the album, it wasn't easy at all. But
		  yes, I did enjoy it because I was pleased with the result. I don't know about

	 <P> <B> I have a question about having you produce new artists. I didn't
		know if you've already done any, or if you're planning to or wanted to.

		<DD> I haven't really produced any artists. It's something that I think
		  I'd be interested in, if the music was really something I felt that I could
		  contribute to. It's a very personal vision, music. And um, in some ways I pity
		  the poor sod that had to put up with me for three years [<I>Laughing with the
		  audience</I>], if it takes them as long as it does me. I mean most people like
		  their albums done in six months. I don't know. I don't know, who knows? At the
		  moment it's more than I can handle just trying to look after myself. (1990
