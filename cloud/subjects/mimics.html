		<DD> I think it's great, actually. I think it's wonderful that they go to
		  so much trouble, as well. And they really do, obviously watch the routines and
		  listen to the track. And they always re-record the track. Great. </DD>

	 <P> <B> When you see somebody doing that. Somebody who has put effort in
		to... To mimic you. And getting laughs out of it, at your expense. Do you then
		say to yourself ``well I'm going to stop doing that, that does look pretty
		silly.'' or do you have second thoughts about your performance? </B></P>

		<DD> I think I have second thoughts about my performance anyway. I think
		  that just exaggerates the point. But its great, I love to watch the way that
		  they do it. It's very fun. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Unknown BBC
