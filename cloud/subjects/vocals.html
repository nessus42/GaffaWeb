		<DD> In my first two albums, I had it in my head to sing only in my
		  highest register. A whim, but it made people think that it was the only way I
		  knew how to sing. However, when I was truly a little girl, I never sang in that
		  way. Since then I've been trying to explore the possibilities of my larynx, to
		  find that sound which best suits the piece. Furthermore, in growing older, the
		  voice changes. I'd like to hope that it's changing for the better. In any case,
		  I control my voice much better than formerly. Being the producer also allows me
		  to devote more time and attention to the method in which I want my singing to
		  sound. That's another source of progress. </DD>

		<DD> That's very interesting. The voices are of capital importance for

		  very deeply about my lyrics. What bothers me is what you just said on the
		  subject of percussion... (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Your vocal melodies are very original and there's a recognizable
		style of swooping pitch glissandos, acciaccatura vocal decoration plus a
		preference for third/root jumps. Then of course you have an extremely wide
		pitch range. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> In fact, I've stretched the pitch range over the years. What I used
		  to do in my earlier performing was to go for notes higher than I could reach
		  easily in the song, so by the time I'd written the song and played it for a
		  good few days, I could actually reach those notes. By making my writing more
		  acrobatic than I was, I was stretching myself to it. It's something that's
		  grown over the years. Definitely my voice has got stronger in the last two
		  years, because on The Dreaming I was so aware of the difference in my voice.
		  Not only is it much stronger, but it is also more controlled. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It has been frustrating for me in the past because my voice has
		  never sounded the way I wanted it to, and so whenever I was listening to the
		  albums it was unbearable for me. It was not just the weakness, but the style,
		  of it. I've always tried to get my voice the way it's starting to be now.
		  Because the songs always controlled me, they were always tending to be in a
		  higher range. It sounds strange, but I think that when you write songs, very
		  often you don't have control of them. You can guide them, but they have their
		  own life force, really. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> My use of decorative notes probably comes from Irish music. My
		  mother's Irish, and in my childhood my brothers were very into traditional
		  music and we could hear it in the house all the time. The airs and inflections
		  are beautiful, and I love Irish singing. On the `` Night of the Swallow'' Liam
		  O'Flynn plays the Uillean pipes and the penny whistle, to give the track an
		  Irish flavour. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think my use of thirds is because in a lot of songs there are
		  times when I want it to sound like someone actually talking than singing. There
		  are things that you say that often people don't put into songs, and I quite
		  like to use those lines. Quite often when people speak they naturally use the
		  ``third-to-root'' pitch-change in their voices - little tension marks that take
		  it up a couple of tones. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Another interesting aspect of your singing style is the way you
		change your voice tone. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I purposely try to do that because I do feel that every song comes
		  from a different person, really, so this is one way of making something
		  different about it. I like to ``create'' voices. I've been trying this over the
		  years. I often find that I do ``word painting'' without realizing, and my
		  singing/speech style probably comes from the Irish influence again. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Sometimes I don't think the words are important, and I'll just use
		  sound shapes, which establish the mood. The lyrics of the lead vocal are
		  awfully important to me, while the backing vocals are very often just trying to
		  create a picture - as in The Dreaming, with ``Na-na-cha chan cha--'' [<I>This
		  is the original interviewer's transcription. Perhaps kate actually said
		  something like 'me-me-me-me-me, t-t-t-t-t, I-I-I-I-I--'. - ied</I>] </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I hardly ever use the Vocoder - only once for a tiny effect on
		  ``<CITE><A HREF="../music/babooshka.html">Babooshka</A></CITE>'' to make the
		  drum sound like the title. [<I>This is no longer true. Kate has spoken about
		  using the vocoder more often for hounds of love and the sensual world
		  albums.</I>] </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We've been experimenting a lot with effects units - particularly the
		  flanger, to get different textures with the voices. In several of the songs
		  there are at least four or five layers of voices. In order to have them not
		  sounding like one clump, we've had to try and separate them by treating them
		  and placing them carefully in the stereo field. Some have more reverb or more
		  echo than others, too. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Listening to your past albums, you seem to like running verses into
		choruses, without the more usual ``here comes the chorus'' feeling.
		[<I>Absolutely true, but - as the interviewer says - mainly in the early songs.
		One could even argue that the opposite is true in kate's recent work, in that
		she now often inserts a characteristic kate bush bridge structure, which she
		calls the ``pre-choral refrain", between verse and chorus. - ied</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I suppose so. But you see, for me, I know where all the
		  choruses are because they're so obvious to me, although it's interesting you
		  say that. It's quite likely, too, that people say they can't dance to my music
		  at parties or discos, but of course, I can dance to it, so it doesn't bother
		  me. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The only person I've met who is really into the same kind of
		  approach to playing as I do is Peter Gabriel. He seems to be working ``behind
		  the scenes'' in a similar way - he's going for the emotional content of the
		  music and lyrics, and he changes his voice. As for my use of local vibrato: if
		  there's a song that needs it, I'll put it in. I have used a choirboy's voice
		  (IT WAS RICHARD THORNTON) to get a different feeling on ``All the Love." </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> During mixing do you consider spatial placement of sounds in
		relation to your obviously spatial dance movements? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, I don't think that far, really, but that's a nice audio thing
		  when I'm working out the dance. I do place the sounds - certainly moreso on
		  this new album, since it's the first one I have produced myself. And anyway
		  it's the first time I've known enough to do that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Do you ``chorus'' your voice a lot? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We have used delay machines for this on a couple of tracks, and
		  added a very slight harmonizer effect, as well as sometimes very tight double
		  tracking. It really does depend on the song, and how strong the lead vocal
		  needs to be. For a more delicate song it would be wrong to put a heavy
		  harmonizer on it - it would sound so affected. [<I>Could she have said
		  ``effected'' here???</I>] We've also been using an awful lot of compression on
		  the new album - with nearly everything, in fact. It's interesting, the kind of
		  dynamics you can actually create, which is what I really never understood
		  before. Especially with voices: as you start compressing them more and more, so
		  many different levels start coming through on it - the breath particularly. And
		  for me, that's as important as the words: it's the space in between. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> In ``all the love'' the ``sighs'' seem to be important in this way.
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it's the idea of using the breath as a voice. There was another
		  backing vocal sung by our engineer, and it's fantastic, because in the gaps
		  there are these huge passages of him going ``haahuuh!'' where you can feel the
		  breath moving past. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> Sometimes the backing vocals just come in automatically as part of a
		  song when I'm writing it. Other times, maybe it won't be until I've recorded
		  the main voice and a few events in the song. And then I'll think it needs
		  something there. Those are really the two extremes: I either come up with the
		  backing vocals in the initial writing, or I hear a hole that needs filling.
		  Whether I build up a really thick, grand vocal depends on the song. If the song
		  needs that, then I'll just overdub the voice and build the vocals up. If it's a
		  very intimate song between the singer and the subject matter, then you'd write

		<DD> Initially I put a tremendous amount of emphasis on the vocals
		  because that was my instrument, apart from playing the piano. That was all I
		  had, was my voice. So the piano and voice were pushed into lots of areas to try
		  to get something interesting. Once I started working with synths and the
		  Fairlight, I could take the emphasis off that voice again and off the piano,
		  and put it into instrumentation. Besides the fact that the Fairlight suddenly
		  gave me instruments to play with instead of my voice, and took quite a nice,
		  new attitude into some of the songs. Because by not writing on the piano
		  anymore, that changed a lot of things. But now I'm actually coming back to the
		  piano again. A little less with the Fairlight. It's still very much there. And
		  the same with voices. I've kind of come full circle, but I now have a different
		  approach. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think the voice is very much an instrument. Especially with
		  backing vocals, because you don't have to have the emphasis on trying to carry
		  the whole story. You can really treat it like an instrument. It's fun just
		  experimenting with different sounds and shapes. (1990, <CITE><A
