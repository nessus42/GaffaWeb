		<DD> For me, age is very nebulous concept. It's something you can't
		  really label on people. You meet people are maybe sixty years old are like a
		  kid. </DD>

		<DD> I think life is all about your attitudes and how you actually see
		  things. I was lucky enough to be born into a family that consists of very
		  observant people. They're very aware of people's motivations and why they do
		  things. I think I'm very lucky because a lot of that has rubbed off on me.
		  Since I've been a kid, I've always been aware of observing people and trying to
		  observe myself and why I do things. It's such an incredibly fascinating process
		  the way people work, I can't help but be inspired by all that goes around me.
		  It's just incredible. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im78_tki.html">Self
