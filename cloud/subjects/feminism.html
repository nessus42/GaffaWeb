		<DD> Women weren't as determined in the past as they are now. The more
		  female artists that get in, the more that will be allowed a chance. It's lovely
		  to think that I could be an example to other girls. I don't feel that strongly
		  about the women's movement. I think male chauvinism is just a gesture; men who
		  are sure of themselves have no need to put women down. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> I really react to that word, and I think probably the majority of
		  women - but I don't know - would feel the same. Feminist is one of those words.
		  When you hear ``feminist'' you go ``"ummgh!'' It's a ``concept'' You get all
		  these terrible images - like women with hairy legs and big muscles. And I mean
		  you just think of butch lesbians. I think the media's been playing around with
		  it, but I also think there are an awful lot of groups that basically don't like
		  men, and they tend to get quite a lot of publicity. And they are terribly
		  aggressive and quite illogical: ``What have we got men for!'' I think a lot of
		  women feel very confused by the whole thing - I know I do - where you've just
		  got to get in there - that's the thing - and <CITE>work!</CITE> </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There are a lot of women who - obviously - want the same
		  opportunities, who don't want doors shut in their faces. But you know we should
		  help each other, for God's sake, we shouldn't be fighting against each other.
		  We should be working to help each other. And men have to be educated as much as
		  women do. We have both been really conditioned. Okay, we are different, we have
		  to recognise that, but we should be able to work together and help each other,
		  and I think we can. We are all sort of sitting here feeling confused, both the
		  women and the men! Or alternatively, the men are out there being chauvinist
		  pigs and the women are out there being feminists. But there's a lot in the
		  middle, a hodge-podge of people, just trying to adjust. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> You have actually charted a very independent course yourself, and
		in some ways you'd offer a definition of what feminists would want women to be
		able to do. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I would like to think that there is actually a very strong force of
		  women who believe we should have equal opportunities, be able to work, be
		  treated nicely without any threat, all of that. And not necessarily come on
		  with ``We hate men - Off with your balls!'' Do you know what I mean? And I
		  think there are lots of women who are starting to really do it properly. Look
		  at comedy. I think comedy in this country is incredible. The best. It really
		  is, it's superb. I suppose a lot of it is negatively based, but it still is
		  superb, and just streets ahead of anyone else in the world. <CITE>But,</CITE> I
		  think women have been used so much in comedy. Either there's something really
		  hideous and ugly that's meant to be attractive, and then when it's hideous and
		  ugly everyone goes ``aah!", or there's Benny Hill's cutie-pies that don't
		  speak. But now there's a revolution in comedy which involves women in a much
		  more interesting way. They're not being used as women, they're not really
		  pretty or really ugly, they're just people. I think that really says a lot. And
		  it's nice to see that, because so often I think women are <CITE>pandered</CITE>
		  to. Like: a couple of years ago there was a trend of these feminist programmes
		  that were meant to be for women, and they were all basically anti-men jokes.
		  And all the women I knew thought they were horrific. It was totally insulting
		  and unfunny. Yet women were presumed to laugh at this. Women came on and told
		  jokes just as sexist as the men's. But it seems to have changed. It's women -
		  Victoria Wood, Jennifer Saunders, Tracey Ullman - it's women, real women.

	 <P> <B> What sort of <A HREF="../subjects/comedy.html">comedy</A> are you

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> all the Comic Strip
		  stuff. Ben Elton's writing is superb. I think all those people are just so
		  inspiring. It's exciting! There should be something like that happening in the
		  music business, too. There should be a real centre of inspired, talented
		  people, putting out stuff that makes you think, that re-educates people. I
		  think they have done a lot for women with their comedy. They can be women
		  without being used as some sex object, or something to be made fun of. Women
		  are actually women in their comedy, and I admire that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I think it's all right for women to be a sex object, if that's what
		they want to be. </B></P>

		<DD> Absolutely. Yes. </DD>

		<DD> Yuck! God, I hate that word. It's like calling someone a Sadist! I
		  think it's really unfortunate that word has been so associated with very
		  extreme... extremist persons. Radical behavior. And I think although it
		  probably had to be put in a bit at the beginning, I think all women are rather
		  offended by that term now. What really has power is when you get people like
		  Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French up there doing something really good, as
		  women, being people, just being women. Women just getting on with it and doing
		  it, and doing it well. Which I think a lot of women are doing now. And there's
		  not such an alienating process going on between men and women. (1989, <CITE><A
