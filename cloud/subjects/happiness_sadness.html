	 <H1> Happiness/Sadness </H1> 
	 <P><B> Kate admits she is very happy, agrees she's probably more stable
		than I've ever been. I've certainly relaxed. When I ask her if she thinks most
		about the past, present or future, she is pleased to say, the present. I think
		a lot less about the past now. Which is good. </B></P>

		<DD> I've always felt there are more happy things to life than sad, yes.
		  I feel that's the only way to survive. I've had a very happy life, especially
		  when I left school and was with Lindsay Kemp - it was so liberating. For the
		  first time I was an individual: mobile, free. I haven't found life very
		  difficult, no. I'm very lucky. </DD>

		<DD> I tend to believe that what you put out comes back. I think you
		  <CITE>can</CITE> make things happen. </DD>

	 <P> <B> What makes you happy? </B></P>

		<DD> Well, I have so little time. I don't have a manager so I'm always
		  organising things. Films amaze me - films like _Don't<CITE>Look Now,</CITE>
		  Hitchcock, <CITE>The Godfather</CITE> - totally, totally brilliant. <CITE>The
		  Innocents.</CITE> I'm sure my love for films will take me closer to them,
		  although I don't know that I want to be in them. (Blitz, 1985) </DD>

	 <P> <B> A lot of your songs and videos are filled with frightening or
		disquieting images. Are you an uneasy person? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I think anyone that has any kind of creative outlet is uneasy, and
		  that's what makes them need to express themselves. I think all human beings are
		  uneasy on some level. How can you not be when we don't really know what we're
		  doing here and what we're meant to do with it, it's the continual questioning
		  going on. (1987, <CITE><A
