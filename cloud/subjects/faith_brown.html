	 <P><B> And of course "Wuthering Heights'' was the record which really
		kicked it all off for you, about a year ago. There was a tremendous parody of
		that done by Faith Brown, which we are going to see in just a moment. Did you
		enjoy that when you saw it? </B></P>

		<DD> Yes, I thought it was incredible. I think she's a genius. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Alright, lets look at it again over here. [<I>Faith Brown's
		``Wuthering Heights'' parody is played. Audience laughs.</I>] </B></P>

		<DD> Amazing. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Yes, you had a smile at that? How did the technique, your own
		technique, actually evolve? The one that is being parodied there by Faith
		Brown, who in fact is a guest in a couple of weeks. </B></P>

		<DD> I'd just like to say that I think the amount of research
		  [<I>That</I>] she must have done. I mean, she must have watched that video so
		  many times, because the movements are just... they're betting than mine, you
		  know, even when she falls over, it's great. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> I don't really watch much television. I haven't been for quite a
		  while - since I've been doing the album. But the ones I have seen I think are
		  really funny. I think it's incredible that I should be chosen from so many to
		  be imitated. (1980, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate6.html">KBC 5</A></CITE>)

		  is hilarious! SHE EXCLAIMED, GIGGLING. She's so accurate! I couldn't believe it
		  when I saw her do `` Wuthering Heights'' and `` Wow'' She'd learned every step
		  of my dance routines. Of course, it's very flattering to be mimicked. The only
		  time it gets bitchy is when they make fun of people's physical imperfections,
		  like Esther Rantzen's teeth. I don't find that amusing at all. (1982, <CITE><A
