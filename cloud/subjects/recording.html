		<DD> When you do start recording a song, you normally have an idea of how
		  it will end up, hopefully, because that's why you are going in to record it in
		  the first place, and a song can take so many different forms - they can take
		  ten minutes to do, or they can take two months. Normally, the stage at which
		  the album cover is conceived is by the time recording has actually begun. I
		  think that's quite important, because it's not until a certain stage after
		  you've started that a vibe emanates about how the songs are going to fit
		  together, what the sounds are going to be, and what the general feel of the
		  music is. (1980, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate6.html">KBC 5</A></CITE>)

		<DD> Mostly I have a strong idea of what I want to hear. The sound aspect

		  piano lines I wanted picked up. But usually I leave the musical content to the
		  musician, and they always understand the atmosphere you want to create. With
		  the drummer, we're now working a lot with drum machines. I originally explain
		  the type of rhythm I want to Del, who then programmes the Linn. I demo the song
		  using the rhythm, and then ask the drummer to replace the feel, adding his own
		  subtle human adornments. (1984, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate18.html">KBC

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It really did this time, especially when you've got mixes that are
		  very complicated and demanding. We'd get the whole mix and there'd be one

		  we'd just have to edit that in. Having got the whole field right, it seems

	 <P> <B> What's your procedure for recording? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> First we do all the backing tracks in one go, and then we'd work on
		  it in layers until we'd got all the other musicians out of the way, so then I
		  can really concentrate on my own stuff. It took weeks to do the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html">vocals</A>, especially because we were having
		  to find the right effects and ambience for each voice. Then on top of that came
		  the Fairlight. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Did you work on the fairlight at home? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. I did as much work at home as I could, but it got very
		  difficult because I was usually in the studio all day, and when I got back at
		  night there were tapes of that day's stuff that I would listen to in order to
		  decide what to go on to the next day. So in fact I wasn't really getting much
		  time, and when I could, I'd tend to do the Fairlight in studio mealbreaks in
		  the control room. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I suppose I could have done tracks like `` The Dreaming'' with a
		  large amount of Fairlight, but it does lack a little top for some sounds, and
		  there are some things, like loops, that can be tricky to do. I ended up using
		  three or four of the presets available on the Fairlight's menu, while most of
		  the others were sampled. What we tended to do was try samples at home, although
		  they would often be too noisy to use, so we'd then do them again in the studio.
		  I have to be honest about the instrument - I really only have a working
		  knowledge, and everything I want to do I can. I love the sampling facility,
		  it's one of the best things - being able to put your own sounds in and then
		  play around with them. Features like the revers play are useful too. There's
		  loads I can't do yet, I'm sure, but I'm taking it step by step. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I would have thought the fairlight was almost a ``trademark'' for
		you, because it can conjure up aural images while you're making the visual

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Absolutely, it does work so well for me. As an educational
		  instrument, too, it's fantastic. Initially, I thought a lot about buying one
		  because it was so much money. When I started this album I did try hiring one
		  in, but it was costing me so much, and I knew that to do everything I wanted
		  I'd need it more or less all the time, so I decided to buy it, and haven't
		  regretted it once. I'm also interested in the new rhythm facilities now
		  available. </DD>

	 <P> <B> [<I>All of this is in reference to the fairlight cmi series ii

		<DD> Coming back to The Dreaming album, we certainly enjoyed using real

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Which drum machine do you use? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I've got a Linn drum machine, which is very good for demos, but I
		  don't like it to be used in the finished thing. I think you can tell it's the
		  Linn - it's got a very specific sound - and I can often recognize it on the

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Some particular sounds that might stand out are the ``car crash",

		  together. It was in fact the engineer's car door miked up! [<I>"Bang! Goes
		  another kanga..."</I>] There's also fluttering birds, and an orchestra chord

	 <P> <B> You play the piano track on all your recordings, right, but then on
		stage? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, on stage, because of course I'm dancing and doing all these
		  other things, I used a guy called Kevin McAlea who was an incredible find.
		  Because I've never met anyone else who plays the piano, or who <CITE>can</CITE>
		  play it if he wants to, so like me. My style is really quite simple, and that's
		  the problem. Professional pianists tend to sort of <CITE>flourish</CITE>
		  everywhere, and that doesn't work in my songs because I use a simple style. I
		  did play two or three numbers on stage, the ones that I thought were important,
		  but the rest of the time I was up front. Obviously, though, because it's the
		  instrument that I always used to write on, it made sense for me to put down all
		  the piano arrangements on record. But most of the songs on the new album I
		  wrote on the Fairlight. I'm sure, though, that I'll still continue writing on
		  the piano, somehow it's such an extraordinarily versatile-sounding instrument.
		  </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Actually I'm a little intrigued by the fact that, while so much of
		your music tends to sound so natural and organic, you're often exploiting all
		the technological wizardries of the studio, and the fairlight even, yet without
		there ever being any clash or contradiction, musically speaking. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, although the Fairlight is <CITE>called</CITE> a synthesizer,
		  so many of its sounds are actually of natural source. And I think really that's
		  why I like it so much. I think there's perhaps not such a great gap between the
		  Fairlight and natural music as there is between synthesizers and acoustic
		  music. The Fairlight really seems to be a huge <CITE>bridge</CITE> between all
		  kinds of music, it's not actually so removed from natural sounds as you might
		  think. Like what you thought might be a koto near the start of ``
		  Cloudbusting'' was actually a banjo which I played on the Fairlight. And, as an
		  album, Hounds of Love was really quite different because the Fairlight was very
		  involved, rather than, as on the last albums, all the tracks being written at
		  the piano. But `` Waking the Witch'' I actually wrote through a guitarist, Alan
		  Murphy, because it needed to be written from a guitarist's point of view, a
		  piano was just so wrong for that one. And he was brilliant about it. I mean, it
		  was very hard for us because both of us felt a little embarrassed. And then we
		  said, look, let's just go for it. And I said, play something like this - this
		  is actually in the studio, he just came in for the day, and all we had down was
		  the drums and hand-claps, he had nothing else at all to play with. But I told
		  him the idea that I wanted. </DD>

	 <P> <B> In the studio these days, now that you're producing yourself, is it
		a kind of benevolent dictatorship where what you say goes and the musicians

		affairs might not be too far different.) </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, quite honestly, I think it <CITE>is</CITE> sometimes. But I
		  think, in most cases, I really do know what I want... </DD>

	 <P> <B> Presumably you must command the respect which induces all these
		fellows to willingly subordinate their own egos... </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, there are never really any serious problems because the
		  fellows I work with are great, and I think they just find amusing all of the
		  things that I like and ask them to do. And they're fabulous, really. I mean,
		  I've never really been able to communicate properly, like those producers you
		  see sitting there talking about A-flats: ``Now take it from the A-coding,'' and
		  all that. I don't find that comfortable at all because, for a start, there
		  might be one of the band (like me!) who doesn't know what you're saying. So
		  what's the point? Because everyone needs to know. So I talk in really basic
		  language. Obviously I have to identify chords and things like that. But in a
		  way, the most important thing for me, I feel, is if I can convey to them the
		  <CITE>atmosphere</CITE> of the song, the sort of <CITE>feeling</CITE> which I
		  want them to produce. Then I feel that they will give me what I want. As long
		  as they're in tune with the song on the same level as I am, then I'm gonna get
		  what I want. So, rather than saying to each of them ``You do this,'' or ``You
		  do that,'' I spend an awful lot of time trying to explain the story and that
		  sort of thing. And I think the one that was the most difficult, but the one I
		  was most pleased with was `` Breathing"- that was an epic. We spent three days
		  trying to get that backing track. And the silly thing was that we had all the
		  riffs and everything by the second day, it was just that no-one could play as
		  if they <CITE>meant</CITE> it, because we'd been playing it for so long. (1985,

		<DD> Yes, it's totally a part of it for me now, and it's just become a

		  think it's actually been the best move I've ever made creatively. It gave me
		  much freedom. Suddenly I was a relaxed person, working and writing in a studio,
		  and this was completely new to me. I was able to take half a day off if things
		  were absolutely awful. </DD>

		<DD> Quite often, in a commercial studio, you feel the pressure to keep
		  working, and sometimes you don't get any work done at all. For lots of reasons
		  it became a more intimate process. By having my own studio, I didn't have
		  people popping in at all times. The studio was always set up. And particularly
		  important was the fact that I was working with Del, whom I know so well, on a
		  more extensive basis. By the time we were working on this album he actually
		  recorded everything. He was <EM>the</EM> recording engineer. So I was in a
		  position where I could write material in the studio with Del. I couldn't really
		  do that with anyone else. It's a very private thing. I couldn't really write in
		  front of other people. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> Because Del plays the bass, he's very good at rhythms and he'll
		  often get the rhythm tracks together. Then I'll build up the song. As soon as
		  I've got an idea, it can go on tape because Del's there. Now for me to actually
		  try to put that on tape, it's so complicated. On occasion I've tried to do it,
		  and it's a joke. [<I>she laughs</I>]. It's impossible. And I don't think I'd be
		  able to do it with another engineer because I wouldn't feel relaxed. I really
		  do have a tremendously intimate creative working environment. I think it's had
		  a very good effect on my music. I feel so much more...too brave sometimes. And
		  that almost frightened me on this album where I actually felt ``This is going
		  to go out to the world!'' It's like my private music. But I do think that's
		  good. Music and art, if possible, should be as personal an expression as
		  possible, as well as a group expression. [<I>Kate looks to Palmer, who has been

		<DD> <A HREF="../subjects/del_palmer.html">Del palmer</A>: You're
		  actually giving me far more credit that I deserve. The thing about what kate
		  does so well is that she makes the musicians actually work hard. Most musicians
		  never really have to work hard. They are always working on their own level of
		  expertise. On kate's music they do work exceptionally hard. And that's why I
		  think most people really enjoy working with her, because they're made to work
		  more than they are used to... </DD>

		<DD> What's great for me is that this is our sixth album, and we've been
		  working with a lot of the musicians for years now. They're old friends. We
		  really don't have a band as such, but it's much easier to communicate with
		  someone who knows what you want. Our drummers never freak out now. Nothing
		  seems crazy to them. (1990, <CITE><A
