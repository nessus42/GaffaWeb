		<DD> It was a fantastic experience, and so totally different from

		  found that really exciting. I really started to get into that - there's so many
		  things that can go wrong on stage, especially if it's a show that you've

	 <P> </P>

		<DD> It's a big problem. Because I don't think I've been completely happy
		  with any visual performance that I've done except for `` Army Dreamers'' and
		  perhaps `` Running Up That Hill.'' But they were videos which took a lot of
		  time and work and control. Except for one I did recently of `` Running Up That
		  Hill'' for a British TV show, where I look a bit like Richard III, there are no
		  TV performances I've done where I think I've ever even got close to pulling it
		  off. So, apart from those few things, but also the videos of `` Wuthering
		  Heights'' and bits of `` Breathing,'' I don't think I've accomplished what I
		  really wanted visually. Usually the problems are lack of time or money. We
		  always have a lot of challenging ideas but then end up compromising somewhere
		  or other in order to meet deadlines or budgets. But occasionally things
		  <CITE>do</CITE> come together well. If anything, though, I think my
		  performances help audiences understand the music better, especially the lyrical
		  aspect, and the tour of Europe definitely caused a change in attitude both
		  among the public and the media. Many people began to take me seriously as a
		  musician for the first time. The audiences could see me there singing and
		  dancing, leading the band and in control of the whole act. And that's quite
		  different from the kind of controlled, far-away image that one gets through the
		  media... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But in these performances, kate - and really they are what I wanted
		to talk about, not your videos - there are only a couple of songs which you
		yourself perform <CITE>on the piano,</CITE> usually one or two of the more
		gentle and intimate ones like `` the man with the child in his eyes.'' yet
		someone like me, at any rate, would like to see you as a performer, as a
		serious musician, singing at the piano and leading the band, which I know you
		could do very well if you wanted to. I told you earlier how the first time I
		saw kate bush was early on, around 1978, when you did two or three numbers in
		that manner on a tv show, and it was then that I recognized in an instant, that
		this young kid was an exceptional artist who had to be taken very seriously, I
		mean <CITE>musically</CITE>. Am I right in thinking that one of the reasons
		you've never toured in the states is because you suppose you need this big show
		with all the people involved and all the expensive props? Do you not feel - and
		I suppose this is really what my argument comes down to - that you could come
		to america just with your band and play more or less straightforwardly?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, no, I would feel that that was such a cop-out. I don't think I'd
		  be able to feel that I had any effort or sense of challenge left in me. I don't
		  really feel that happy doing something, in a way, unless I've really pushed
		  myself to the limit. And, you know, it's like when we do
		  <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html">videos</A> and things, I don't really feel
		  right unless we're all filthy and exhausted by the end of the day. Otherwise it
		  doesn't feel like you've put enough effort into it. When you hear an album you
		  listen to the music; but when you go and see a show, you're going there to
		  <CITE>see</CITE> that person or the band come alive, and hopefully give you
		  everything that they've got, so that you can really have a good evening and
		  enjoy the music within the concept of a <CITE>show.</CITE> And I think, if I
		  was just going to stand up there, then, you know, what are the audience getting
		  apart from seeing me just standing there that they can't get on an album? On
		  the albums, they get much better arrangements, much better vocals which are in
		  tune, all that sort of thing... </DD>

	 <P> <B> Except that there are of course artists who can give a

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> You see, I don't think I <CITE>want</CITE> to be up there on the
		  stage being <CITE>me</CITE>. I don't think I'm that interesting for people to
		  see. I think what I want to do is to be up there actually being the person that
		  is there in the song. I think that is much more interesting for people and it
		  is much more of a challenge for me. If I can be the character in the song, then
		  suddenly there's all this strength and energy in me which perhaps I wouldn't
		  normally have, whereas if it was just me, I don't think I could walk on the
		  stage with confidence. It's very hard for me to be <CITE>me</CITE> on a stage,

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But kate, it seems to me that all those in the states who've taken

		chance to see her perform, what they love perhaps more than anything is
		precisely that so much of your music is so deeply personal. The personae you

		anyone else. Could you not come to the states to perform and simply be
		yourself? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, that is great if you think people would like that, but I
		  cannot help but feel it is very important to give people something visually
		  special. That was what made me feel there was something special when I saw
		  Lindsay Kemp all those years ago. He opened up a whole new world for me that I
		  had not really thought about before, the fact that he was doing something so
		  incredible without even saying anything! It really affected me emotionally,
		  like when I was younger and used to listen to records and the way they affected
		  me was incredible and I used to think, if I could ever do that one day to other
		  people through music, that would be great. I think in a way Lindsay had a
		  similar influence on me; what he was doing was so exciting and powerful, I
		  thought to myself, if you could possibly create music <CITE>and</CITE> have it
		  accompanied by such strong visuals, then it would just have to be good; and
		  really interesting. And I don't think, by any means, that the tour which we did
		  some years ago was perfect, there were a lot of things that were experimental,
		  and we didn't know if they were going to work, but I think we did explore new
		  territory, visually speaking, and the reaction was so positive - I mean, I
		  think that probably opened up more people to listening to my stuff than the
		  records themselves ever did. Partly, I think, because people didn't expect me
		  to be quite like that and they all enjoyed it. And I see that as a very
		  positive, rather than a negative, thing. Had they not enjoyed it, then that
		  would be a different thing and perhaps I would not feel so inclined to want to
		  do it again. But I have had an extraordinary amount of encouragement from
		  people not just on the musical side but also on the visual side, maybe even
		  more so! And I do feel that, when eventually I get the time and money to do
		  another show, I hope we will continue working along those lines of combining

	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Del: Yeah, anyone can set up their gear and sit down at a piano and
		sing for an hour. But not everybody can put on a whole integrated show. And as
		soon as we got our little band together years ago, right from the word go it
		was theatrics and show. We were only playing little pubs on tiny little stages
		like at <CITE>the rose of lee,</CITE> but we had a whole light show, we used
		dry ice, and all that. What you are saying is that kate's fans in america would
		love it even if she just came over and set up and played. But think how much
		more they would love it if she was there with a whole show. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Well, are there any plans yet for a return to the stage? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, I have got some projects that I want to try and get done before
		  I can get on to a live project. There is promotion to be done on the album,
		  which I hope to get done as quickly as possible. I have got a couple of videos
		  to do for the singles, which are demanding, so I am trying to put as much work
		  into them as possible, and then get into the visual thing on <CITE>The Ninth
		  Wave.</CITE> And then I can maybe think about live work and the next album.
		  </DD>

	 <P> <B> To go back on stage, would you actually have to get together some
		irish musicians - perhaps even planxty themselves! - to execute things like ``
		night of the swallow'' and `` jig of life?" </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh, Planxty, wouldn't that be great! That would be fabulous. It
		  would be incredibly difficult to do songs like that without Irish musicians.
		  But I don't know, it would all depend on boring things like money; it would be
		  terribly expensive to take a band like that on tour with you. `` Jig of Life''
		  would be very very different without a ceilidh band, though it could be
		  interesting. But I am hoping the film project that I would like to do would get
		  around that, as originally <CITE>The Ninth Wave</CITE> was written very much as
		  a story, and ideally I would like to make a film of that, and then that whole
		  side of the album with ``Jig of Life'' would be very much covered, I feel. And
		  so maybe for a show I would be doing the other new numbers and a selection of
		  numbers off the third and fourth albums, because those would be more suited to
		  live performance. </DD>

		  was a really interesting combination to use music, theatre, poetry, in live
		  form. And although all the songs we'd worked were off the albums, we had lots
		  links and different extensions to the music and that. And so it really does
		  become a very involved process. And I think the last three albums, which if we
		  did a tour would be what we'd cover, actually lend themselves better towards
		  being visualized theatrically, but I just don't know if we'll every get 'round

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well I think it's very possible, but I also think there's been so
		  many other inaccessible areas, to me here as an artist. Where, I guess my last
		  record company found it difficult to know how to express me as an artist to the
		  public. My second and third albums weren't released here - they were released
		  at a later date. I think people must have quite a confusing
		  <A HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A> of me. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Sure. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But, in a way, I think that that's something I have to not worry
		  about too much, because that's not really my responsibility. My
		  responsibilities are the artistic, where I have to make the best record I can
		  at the time, and I have to try and let people know it's out there. But all
		  those areas, they're kind of out of my control, really. </DD>

		<DD> Why do people still ask me if I'm going to tour? I haven't toured in
		  ten years! I mean it's absolutely ridiculous! </DD>

		<DD> A lot of people of people think I hated touring, and that's why I
		  haven't done it again. But actually I really enjoyed it. So I think I would
		  like to, but I guess I'm scared of committing myself to some like that again. I
		  found it very tiring, and it was really difficult for me to do anything for a
		  very long time afterwards... </DD>

	 <P> <B> As everyone who's seen kate's videos knows, she definitely has an

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I was very much influenced by dance and theatre at the time, and I
		  really wanted to do something special with the show. But recently, especially
		  over these past two albums, it's been very important for me to spend time being
		  a songwriter. I didn't want to be a performer. I didn't feel like a performer,
		  and I didn't want to be exposed to all that it entails. I wanted spend some
		  tome alone at home and just be a songwriter and not be out there in front of
		  everyone. I feel very exposed, doing that. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I know it's been such a long time. All I can say is I just, in many
		  ways, haven't been ready for it. And also I don't think the time was quite
		  right for me since that first tour. I think those of you that were there will
		  know how much I did enjoy touring, it's not that I didn't enjoy it, which a lot
		  of uh, I've seen press... interview things... It's not true, I did enjoy it
		  very much. And, I would very much like to at least do some shows again, if not
		  a big tour. So, we're thinking about it now, and although it's not definite, I
		  would have thought if it's going to go ahead it will be announced in January.
		  And, uh, I just really wanted to let you know first, so [<I>??? Inaudible</I>]
