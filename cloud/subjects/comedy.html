		<DD> I thought, ``How weird for a comedian to do such a serious film
		  [<I>Mel Brooks, who kate mistakenly believed directed <CITE>Elephant
		  Man</CITE></I>], but if you think of the syndrome of the comedian who is
		  hilarious onstage but really manic-depressive at home, it figures. (1981,

		<DD> Terry's been a great help in pointing me towards people I could use
		  for the <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html">videos</A>. I'm a great fan of Terry,
		  I think he's a brilliant director - I love his films. I think he's more
		  talented than people have appreciated yet. He's a really great filmmaker and I
		  think a serious one too. And I just managed to be lucky enough to have made
		  contact with him and he's helped me find people that I could work with on these
		  last two videos. </DD>

	 <P> <B> So you're quite a fan of slapstick and that type of thing? </B></P>

		<DD> No, i'm not a fan of flaps [<I>Gets tongue-tied</I>] slapstick! But
		  of doing things unusually and brilliantly. I mean I think his sense of
		  composition, his sense of photographing things is superb, is brilliant. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Are going to do more acting in tv or films in the future. And if

		<DD> The only real bit of acting I've done is with <CITE>The Comic
		  Strip</CITE> just last year - wait, this year, isn't it? And I did enjoy it.
		  But I have to be totally honest, I really missed having control over
		  [<I>Laughs</I>] - over the whole thing. I'm obviously such amegalomaniac. And
		  it was incredible working with those people, it was a lot of fun. Very
		  different pace. Very interesting... very interesting stuff. I did enjoy it very
		  much. But I think I enjoy putting the videos together so much, where I'm
		  actually directing. It's like - it's like writing a song visually. I find that
		  so exciting that... that's what grabs me. And although I would love to do some
		  acting, if it was something very very interesting and I felt I could actually
		  do it, I'm kind of happier to pursue the idea of, someday, making a little
		  film. Uh, so... </DD>
