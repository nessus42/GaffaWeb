		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I do. Especially when it's live. There's so much you have to
		  think about, really. And you can't help but be aware of yourself, you just find
		  you're out there looking at yourself. It's a very strange feeling. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Do you ever put on a kind of disguise to get over that? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Oh, yes. I mean I use all kind of props, I think like any actor.
		  Like the makeup, and the clothes, and especially the piano. That's a really big
		  prop. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Hide behind them. </B></P>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> When I go on stage, yes, I do feel nervous. I feel much more nervous
		  when I have to go up and collect awards and speak to people than I do when I
		  actually perform, and I think that's because when you perform, you have a part
		  like an actor, and you fall back on that if you know it well enough and can
		  carry it through. I enjoy it so much. I think when you have to be yourself,
		  you're so conscious of being yourself that you wonder what people think, but it
		  soon goes once you're up there. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> - and uh, I do get incredibly nervous. And, I think a lot of that
		  has to do with the insecurities I've felt as a performer. Each time I performed
		  I would be very nervous. I'd feel I wasn't very good, and it would build up
		  more and more. I don't know, I think in a way it's just something you have to -
		  you almost have to take it by the hand like a person, your nerves, and, um, try
		  to get it to sit down and stop running around the place! 'Cause that's what
		  you're doing inside, you know? Um, and I just admire performers so much that
		  can go up in front of really big crowds and deal with it. </DD>

		<DD> Um...Actually, I don't feel as nervous as I thought I would at all.
		  I was very nervous before I came on, but, uh, no, I feel okay, thanks! </DD>
