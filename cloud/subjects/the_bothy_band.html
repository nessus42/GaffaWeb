		<DD> Yes! Now this is from the Bothy Band, and um...I think the thing
		  about Irish music is that it's starting to break up, but there are only certain
		  people that are becoming popular, like The Chieftains. And although they're
		  really brilliant, there's such a wealth of Irish music and musicians in
		  Ireland. Now one particular fiddle-player called Kevin Burke, who happens to be
		  in the Bothy Band, was, again, on my album. He was on `` Violin:'' he was the
		  mad fiddler. He's the most fantastic musician. He's really a lovely guy, too.
		  And this track... I mean heavy metal - nothing! Just listen to this. It gets so
		  funky, it's incredible - </DD>
