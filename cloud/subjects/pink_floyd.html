		<DD> Yes. I've been very much influenced by <CITE>The Wall</CITE> because
		  I like the way that the Floyd get right into that emotional area and work with
		  sounds as pictures. I think the problem with the film though is that, although
		  as a piece of art it is devastating, it isn't real enough. The whole film is
		  negatively based. No once during Pink's life is there a moment of happiness
		  which I know in every human's life there is. Even if you have the shittiest
		  life of all there is always one little moment where you smile for a second or
		  you fall in love with someone and feel happy - maybe only for ten minutes.

		<DD> In <CITE>The Wall</CITE> there is no compassion and no objectivity
		  at all and I actually think that certain areas of that are destructive. (1982,
