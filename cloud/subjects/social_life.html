		<DD> Oh yeah, it is. When I'm working it's really important for me to get

		  respectful, because they make me aware of being aware that I am a woman and

		  couple of years, because they won't treat me as a human being. And people in
		  the street will ask you for autographs and also won't treat you as human but
		  ... ah ... Sometimes I get really scared. Sometimes when I'm going to the
		  supermarket to get the coffee and cat litter, I get freaked out and see all
		  these people staring, and you turn around and there's like forty people all
		  looking at you ... and when you go around the corner they're all following you!

		<DD> Y'see when I first got started I thought that I'd better watch out
		  for all these rip-off artists and stick with old friends. But it's amazing that
		  since I've been in the business I've made so many more real friends, especially
		  on a working basis. I find that I can get so involved with a guy working with
		  me - and usually on a platonic level, which is great! That's so special, like
		  these two minds linked on this one project. And that is a very beautiful thing
		  that's I'd never have experienced had I not been in this business. </DD>

		<DD> Well, I don't go to parties very often. Only if I'm invited (SHAME!)

	 <P> <B> So when you were younger you were much, like, closer with your

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I think so. I think I'm still quite shy. It depends on the

		<DD> I think I'm really fighting between the two. I think there's a side
		  of me that really loves being social and really loves being with people and
		  there's another side of me that doesn't, that finds.. for instance most of my
		  creative work I couldn't do with people around. I couldn't write a song with
		  someone else in the same room. It's a very private process for me. I think I've
		  probably got a bit better about it, I mean when I first used to start writing,
		  even if someone walked in, it would just completely blow my concentration. And
		  at least now I can keep it going maybe if they're one person in the room. But
		  yes, I think there's a strange struggle in there between those those two areas,

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> By and large, yes. When it started I had to be quite strong. I
		  couldn't cope with it as well now as I did then. I've changed a lot since then.
		  I wasn't naive, no. I was more innocent then, but not the lost little girl the
		  press presented me as. They patronised me. I do get shocked by the attention,
