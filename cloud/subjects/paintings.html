	 <P> <B> I was reminded by this painting in the corner hear, which is sort
		of a satire of a pre-raphaelite painting, and I always thought those victorian
		painters, the pre-raphaelite's, were an influence on the texture of your
		songwriting. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. Yes, I think it was particularly in my very early teens. I was
		  very enchanted by the whole romance of it, yes. They found their way into
		  songs, the imagery. I think that's what happens, something attracts you because
		  of the imagery and you digest it and it come out in a song. I think that's how
		  artists work, they're like magpies who are picking out little bits of gold and
		  storing them away. (1985, March 15, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> When I met you in your dance studio in london, I saw a painting
		against the wall that we were laughing about. It was a satire of that
		pre-raphaelite painting of ophelia drowned in the reeds, this one was in a
		polluted river. Now on the inside cover sheave of the hounds of love there's a
		picture of you in the water, like ophelia. Is that a deliberate connection?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Not a conscious connection, no, but I'm sure that that imagery is
		  there very strongly. Ophelia is one of those beautiful paintings, its
		  extraordinary. And I think my attraction to Ophelia in the first place is what
		  made me get that painting. So it's probably still quite subconsciously strong
		  there in me. (1985, Late November, <CITE><A

		<DD> I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> paintings. Years ago when
		  I didn't have the money to afford it at all, I bought a big picture. People
		  thought i was mad,and they were right! But I just fell in love with it. It's a
		  bit like Millais's Ophelia, but a modern image of it; in fact, she's floatin in
		  a sewer, hahaha! But I thought the irony was great, and the water, although
		  it's disgusting, has all the colours of oil in it. I do have a tremendous
		  fascination with grotesque beauty and sad humour, opposites put together. I'd
		  sit and look at that picture and than spend a couple of hours writing. (1990,

	 <P> <B> At one end of the studio is a huge painting of a drowned, cracked
		doll floating face up past a sewer. For some reason this painting, which might
		be described as macabre-kitsch, seems to say a lot about its owner. Kate
		returns and sees me examining it. </B></P>

		<DD> That's called ``The Hogsmill Ophelia.'' A lot of people find it
		  disturbing but I don't. I've lived with it for ages. Looked at it every day.
		  That picture cost me all the money I had once. Paintings are a great
		  inspiration. One of my favourites is by Millais [<I>British pre-raphaelite
		  painter john everett millais, 1829-1896</I>], <CITE>The Huguenot</CITE>
		  [<I>Technically, <CITE>a huguenot, on st.</CITE>bartholomew's<CITE>day,
		  refusing to shield himself</CITE>f- rom<CITE>danger by wearing the roman
		  catholic badge</CITE>, 1851-52</I>]. It's of a man going off to the wars being
		  hugged to the breast of his lover. She's holding him to her by a scarf around
		  his arm. It's very beautiful. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> You never mention painters in your work, at all. Have you any

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think paintings are phenomenal. I would love to be able to
		  paint. Particularly in oils. I think it just must be so fantastic to stand
		  there and - paint a picture. And I think they've been quite influential on my
		  work. When I was very young I was into Millais pictures, and I used to find, um
		  - Do you know ``The Huguenots'' Do you know that? Beautiful painting, I just -
		  In fact, I wrote a song that was kind of inspired by the painting. I got a
		  painting years ago that I couldn't afford to buy at all, but that inspired a
		  lot of my work, as well. And I think one of my favourite painters is Brueghel.
		  I think his work is just so extraordinary. The sense of detail and colours,
		  it's so alive. I would love to be able to uh, to do something like that. So uh,
		  vive les painters, eh? [<I>Laughter from audience</I>] (<A
