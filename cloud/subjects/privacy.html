	 <P> <B> She's still rather shy and home-loving. Kate laughs openly when you

		<DD> I don't go on holiday. I'd rather stay at home. I went once years

		<DD> A large part of this business is so false, isn't it? You hear such a
		  lot about the rock 'n' roll life-style, but I really don't know what that is
		  about any more. The show business life has simply never appealed to me. I
		  wasn't attracted to the music business by the idea of wearing a black leather
		  mini and getting legless at all the right parties every night. What I wanted to
		  do was make music. That's all I want to do now. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I do like the quiet life. I'd like having privacy; it's incredibly
		  important to me, because I do end up feeling quite probed by the public side of
		  what I have to do. I'm just quite a private person, really. You just end up
		  feeling quite exposed; it's this vulnerability. After I've done the salesman
		  bit, I like to be quiet and retreat, because that's where I write from. I'm a
		  sort of quiet little person. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, I guess so. I think that it is very important to me that I get
		  that break again, between albums. I need a lot of privacy, and just to be at
		  home. It's such a different world out there, and it's not really something I've
		  ever wanted to be a part of. Making records and just being involved in music is
		  really what attracted me to what I do. And it's not really me to go to all
		  these clubs. It's not really the kind of thing I like to do. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I do get very obsessed with it all, and people make quite a fuss,
		  really, which is truly nice. But it is just an album. There are lots of other
		  things in life besides working. So many people get wrapped up in their work on
		  so many levels of life, because there is such a lot of pressure for people to
		  follow this high achiever. </DD>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. And I'm very, very lucky. I continually think I'm so lucky to
		  do what I like doing, and to have the time to do what I want. But it is still
		  important to have a good time. That's what it's all about, don't you think?
		  You've got to have a good time, really. </DD>

	 <P> <B> What are your priorities, then? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think years ago, really, I wouldn't have looked beyond
		  having a damn good album. And now, it's nice for me to have space away from it.
		  I like not being quit so obsessed as I used to be. There's a bit more time to
		  play with. Maybe I'm a bit more sociable because I'm not so obsessive. It does
		  get terribly unhealthy, and it's very selfish, as well - making an album,
		  writing a book... Any of those things. Ultimately it is a very selfish act, so
		  you should be more healthy. </DD>

	 <P> <B> What do you do, though? Do you watch lots of telly, or do you go to

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> watching telly,
		  because when we spend a lot of time in the day listening to music, you don't
		  want to get home and listen to records. I love watching comedy. I really love
		  gardening. I did quite a bit of gardening over the last couple of years, which
		  was really good for me. It's so nice to get outside, too. You get stuck inside
		  all day, so at least I've been getting out a bit more, and not being so
		  obsessive. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir89_gl.html">Greater
