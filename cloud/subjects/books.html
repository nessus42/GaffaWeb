	 <P><B> Are there any writers who've really influenced you alot. Print
		writers like bob gurdjieff [<I>??? And another writer I couldn't figure out the

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I don't know if there are any writers that have really influenced
		  me. Particular books certainly have. But again they're much on a novel level
		  rather than a reality level. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Uh, huh. Well like let's have a couple of examples. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I used to read quite a lot of Kurt Vonnegut and C. S. Lewis when I
		  was a kid was one of my biggest ones. I also think when you're very little,
		  like I don't know if you were ever read fairy stories by your mother, I think
		  those kind of things get in very, very deep. And when I was really little, one
		  of my favorite writers was Oscar Wilde and his fairy stories. And I actually
		  think that they got in quite deep. I think his sense of tragedy and poetry is
		  something that still moves me very much. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I didn't know he had fairy stories. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, he does indeed. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Oh, really? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh yes, and they're beautiful! </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Can you like describe one? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well one of them. [<I>Coughs</I>]. Just trying to think what it's
		  called. ``The Happy Prince'' is one of his stories. It's about this huge statue
		  that stands in the middle of a city. And it's incredibly beautiful, it's coated
		  in gold, his eyes are rubies, he just sparkles. He's a beautiful statue of the
		  prince. And there's a little swallow who's flown in and nests at the feet of
		  the statue overlooking the city. And the statue speaks to the swallow and says
		  does he realize how much poverty and sadness is going on in the city. So bit by
		  bit the little swallow strips the statue of the gold and the rubies and
		  distributes it around the city to all the poor people. So eventually the Prince
		  is just like a lead blob. He eyes are taken so he's blind, and he's just left
		  completely alone, all his great finery has gone to the poor. And it's winter
		  and the swallow should really migrate or it will die and the swallow will not
		  leave him. And the tragedy is the closeness between them - that the swallow
		  should go or it will die and how beautiful he was and now he's completely
		  stripped. The little swallow dies and eventually they just sort of pull the
		  statue down and stick him in the dump. [<I>Laughs</I>] </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Oh, no. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But the way it is written and it's so beautiful and so sad! And
		  there was one... you know, at the point where the swallow was discovered I
		  always used to cry as a child. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So you like to write songs like that that are sorta so archetypal
		in a way? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think his sense of tragedy in telling a story attracts me
		  tremendously. And I think it's very similar in a way to a lot of the
		  traditional music that I was again influenced by when I was very little... by
		  my family. My brothers were really into folk music. And a lot of folk music is
		  so into telling stories. And it's in a way something that doesn't feature so
		  much in contemporary music any more. I think contemporary music is used to help
		  relationships a lot of the time. Like you go to the disco and you meet someone,
		  so you have a song, and it's your song. It's more about that then actually
		  telling stories. Like the traditional things are. And I think that's a big
		  fascination for me. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Much of your music is very literate. Is reading a passion of yours?
		I'm curious, in fact, whether you're in tune with authors like doris lessing or
		iris murdoch; Sometimes I describe kate bush to people as being a sort of doris
		lessing of rock. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I'm sorry, Doris who? I'm sorry, but I don't know the author. But
		  reading was once a very big passion. When I was about eight or nine, for about
		  three years I got through dozens and dozens of books and was very much into
		  reading, mostly fiction. But as soon as I began writing poems at school -
		  basically, as soon as I started getting into writing songs - everything else
		  seemed to go out the window. I'd sit down and read a book, and think how I
		  could be writing a song rather than reading It's only really in the last few
		  years, when I get the time to read a book, that I realize how incredible it is.
		  During journeys by car, I've got into reading again. It's very good, I really,
		  really enjoy it. There's nothing like reading a good book. The sense of
		  involvement - and, you know, you actually feel you're one of the people in the
		  story. That sense of involvement, it's incredible, it's <CITE>good.</CITE> But
		  I'm such a slow reader and, unless I'm on holiday, which is a very rare thing,
		  I always feel that there's something better, more productive, that I could be
		  doing. So I tend not to read, as I always feel guilty, and I think I should be
		  doing other things. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Del: I think that's just an excuse, I think you should make time to
		read. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> And especially if songs like `` cloudbusting'' come out of it.
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, but I read that so long ago and it's just been waiting to come
		  out for nine or ten years. The thing is, I had to wait till I was at the right
		  point to write that song in such a way that I could do it proper justice.

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> What books? Well, my problem with books is that I used to read a lot
		  more than I do now, and so I think my book inspiration is now coming from
		  <A HREF="../subjects/television.html">television</A>, films, newspapers - you
		  know, all the modern media. But I really do think that all the books I've read
		  have had a tremendous influence on me because of their strong imagery. I think
		  books really are a fantastic form of inspiration. (1980, <CITE><A

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Do you know, it's never occurred to me. I'd like to write another
		  song connected to a book if the story was strong enough. It's not important
		  though. I just want to carry on exploring. I like to write music about subjects
		  I haven't touched before. That's my favourite thing. (1978, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Do you get a lot of ideas from reading books, and from films?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think whenever I have the time to read I'm always inspired by it.
		  The problem is that I just shun it, in that I feel that there are more
		  important things to do with my time. It's rubbish really, but I do always feel
		  guilty when I sit down and read a book, because I think I should be doing other
		  things. And it takes me such a long time to read. But in a way there is no
		  other experience like it. An intimate relationship between yourself and a book
		  is incredible, and it's very sad that things like television and films - sort
		  of, uh... although it's great, because they're encouraging books by using their
		  scripts for films - I think it is taking something away from that whole world
		  of books. But particularly films do inspire me. I've always had a television, I
		  always used to watch lots and lots of television when I was a kid, and I really
		  enjoy watching films. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Right, well it always affects me. Every book I've read has really
		  affected me. It's that special, you do create a relationship, really. And that
		  was such a huge story... Oscar Wilde was one of my earliest influences - his
		  fairy stories. I could still read one of them - definitely - and cry. Terribly

		  Reading a book does not just make you think,it makes you explore. I think
		  <CITE>The Shining</CITE> is terrific; its the only book by Stephen King I've
		  read. It's atmosphere ended up in a couple of my songs, and `` Get Out Of My
