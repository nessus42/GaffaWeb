	 <P><B> Hannah: We always encouraged kate to write songs, but we never
		thought, we never dreamed, it would all turn out like this. We're very proud of
		her, naturally, but hasn't it all happened very suddenly? The doorbell's
		ringing all the time now from fans who want autographs. I have to collect them
		up and give them to kate to sign. </B></P>

		<DD> I worry about Kate at times, but she's a very stable girl and always
		  seems to know what she's doing. She hasn't become affected in the slightest.
