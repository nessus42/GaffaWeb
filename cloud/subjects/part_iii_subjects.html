		<DD> The sections contains all of the quotes from Kate that are not
		  related to a specific song or time. It is ordered alphabetically and contains
		  quotes relating to Kate's feelings on particular subjects (people, places,
		  things, emotions, influences, etc.). However this is not a concordance or an
		  index to the other sections. Obviously you should refer to other sections for
		  more information on a subject, IE The Sensual World for more info on
		  <CITE>Sexuality/Sensuality</CITE>. Obviously there is some overlap with quotes
		  from sections I + II but I have tried to keep that down to a minimum and when
		  it occurs I try to use different quotes which say the same thing. </DD>
