		<DD> Well, his name's Eberhard Weber. <CITE>Veh-ber--</CITE> [<I>In heavy
		  german accent:</I>] Eberhard Weber. And he's German. And he's a fantastic
		  fretless bass-player. He's got his own solo albums, and he works beautifully
		  with glockenspiel, vibes, uh, vocal pieces. And it's very spacey, um,
		  jazz-rocky. But what I like about him is always there's Jaco Pastorius, Stanley
		  Clarke, they're right up at the top with all the big bass players, but again
		  there're lots of very talented people that aren't that well known. So I'd like
		  to give him a bit of exposure. And this is off the album called <CITE>Fluid
		  Rustle.</CITE> And the track's called ``Quiet Departures." </DD>

	 <P> <B> "Quiet departures'' by Eberhard Weber, from the album <CITE>Fluid
		Rustle.</CITE> Kate, does music like that influence you as well as entertain
		you? </B></P>

		<DD> Oh, absolutely. I really feel that anything that I see, read, listen
		  to, feel, eat, etcetera, is an influence. Because anything you like you're
		  going to have an automatic attraction and want for. And so even subconsciously
		  you, um, you use it, somehow it gets in there. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> I must say, it's just delightful to be able to work with people
		  you've admired, SAYS KATE AS SHE ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECOUNTS THE PROCESS OF
		  SENDING TAPES TO WEBER (HER FAVORITE ECM ARTIST) AND THEN JOINING HIM IN THE
		  STUDIO TO RUN THROUGH HIS PARTS. The parts are very much his. I would only
		  question a note here or there, only because of my stubbornness... how I see
		  things. But what I love is his personality, which exudes through everything he
		  does. Beautiful, consuming sounds. So emotional. And, really, you ask people
		  like that to come in so that you can steal that little bit of personality and
		  put it on your track. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">BAM</A></CITE>)
