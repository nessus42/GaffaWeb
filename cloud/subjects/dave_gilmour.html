	 <P> <B> Dave: Well, my involvement with her career specifically stopped at
		the moment that I sold her on. I retained a small financial percentage on the
		tracks that I did that were on the first album, and I got my expenses back out
		of EMI when I sold her on. I sold the tapes to them for what it cost to put
		them together. I haven't had any financial interest in her career. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Are you still friends? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Dave: Yes, I see her quite often. I actually sang some backing
		<A HREF="../subjects/vocals.html">vocals</A> on her last album on a track
		called `` pull out the pin.'' (c.1983, chez david gilmour interview) </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd fame gave you your big break. How did
		that come about? </B></P>

		<DD> Well, I'd been writing, I suppose, since I was about thirteen,
		  seriously. It was my family and my brother John who felt it would be a good
		  idea to see if we could get some of my songs published. And through a friend of
		  the family, we made a contact with Dave Gilmour, who at that time was scouting
		  for talent to, perhaps, produce or encourage. he came down and heard some songs
		  and I think was impressed. </DD>

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And basically, eventually, he put up the money for me to go into the
		  studio and make three tracks properly produced and through those tracks I got
		  the recording contract. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <DL>
		<DD>I can see how this question came up, as I'm so indebted and grateful
		  to dave gilmour for everything he's done for me, but the answer is no, it isn't
		  me, though I'd <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> to work with him some

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I would say so too. Because I think Dave's a fantastic
		  guitarist because he doesn't go for these blinding arpeggios, it's real
		  emotional, it kinda simple. I mean, I think that's what music is really about.
		  I think technique has become a big distraction. </DD>
