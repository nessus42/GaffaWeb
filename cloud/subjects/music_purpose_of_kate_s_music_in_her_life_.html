		<DD> I think maybe the reason I write songs is maybe I need to my express
		  myself. That I need to be heard by people, maybe just to feel that I am someone
		  for some reason. But I don't really think it matters why as long as what I'm
		  doing has some purpose and if it, in any way, makes other people feel happy,
		  which is all I'm into. I really hope that listen to the song will enjoy it and
		  have fun. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im78_tki.html">Self

		  in. Belief is motivation, and without that you don't do anything. I mean, if
		  your ``God'' is to have a husband and children, and you actually fulfill
		  that... Many people don't see the thing they love and believe in as ``God''
		  Most of us aren't happy, really, and it's only because our God isn't complete.

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There's another fascinating observation. I'm certain that everyone

		  their most destructive side. Tony Hancock [<I>Goon squad comedian very popular
		  in the early 60s</I>] is a perfect example: he was a remarkable actor, who
		  ended up by examining himself, criticizing himself so much that he destroyed
		  himself. It's something that exists in each one of us, but that one must
		  succeed in mastering, otherwise one risks going mad. When writing, every time,
		  one is really obliged to analyze the things one is talking about. That's the
		  essence of the creative process. (1986, <CITE><A

		  emotion is really what music's all about. It's trying to emote to the listener,
		  in some way that is effective, either to make them happy or sad. To me as a
		  listener to other people's music, that's what it does for me though. There are
		  pieces of music that just make me go ``Ohh...,'' they're just so good. They
		  make you feel great or they make you feel very sad and nostalgic, and i think
		  everyone has some kind of music that really makes them feel good. Does
		  something for them. So I think that's the purpose, to emote the listener. So
		  it's got to be about emotion, really, and expression. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Your music and lyrics do show you as a very emotional person. Like

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think I'm quite analytical and I think that's definitely what
		  comes out in a lot of the songs. It's the analyzing of emotional situations. I
		  think I"m an emotional person - I think that's what motivates me. Definitely
		  from some writing point of view, even in political situations when people say,
		  ``You've written this. This is quite political.'' But for me, it's the
		  emotional content of the political situation that effects me. I think that most
		  people that are sort of intrigued by writing or creating on some level are
		  sensitive to the emotional side of things. That's in a way perhaps what makes
		  them write... A kind of insecurity. (1986, <CITE><A

		<DD> Some of the most beautiful music ever was written for God, for a
		  loved one, in a state of grief, sorrow, suppression - it seems to be an
		  expression from a person on a higher level...? I'm not sure I understand it at
		  all, but music seems to come out of people when very little else can. Some of
		  the great composers wrote beautiful music but, as people, were monsters or
		  maniacs. People who can't speak properly because of stutters can sing fluently.
		  I saw a clip from a programme about a man who only had a short-term memory - he
		  couldn't remember anything: what he'd just said, just done. He lived in a
		  constant state of panic, because he didn't know where he was, or why he was
		  there. It was terrifying. The only thing he could remember was he wife, and
		  when he sat at the church organ at his local church he could sing a play
		  complete pieces of music without any problems. It was like he'd suddenly been
		  set free. And yet when he was shown a video
		  <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">recording</A> of him doing this, he had no
		  memory of it whatsoever. Music is a strange and beautiful thing. It means a

		  it's very much a release for me. I think I've got a tremendous amount of
		  support from my family which is very important to me. And I don't know if music
		  supports you; it's not necessarily a comforting thing, but it's like a very
