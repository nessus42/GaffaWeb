		<DD> I'm 19 but so what? I've had experiences too. A lot of my songs are
		  about my own traumas. The best time for writing is when you're going through a
		  heavy time. You have an enormous amount of energy. The best way to deal with it
		  is not to bottle it up or take it out on someone else but to channel it into

		<DD> You get ideas for songs from all sorts of situations. I just start
		  playing the piano and the chords start telling me something. Lyrics for me just
		  seem to go with the tune, very much hand in hand. Some lyrics take a long time
		  to come, others just come out like ... , SHE GESTURES WILDLY WITH HER HANDS,

		<DD> Well, in many ways, before all these things started happening to me,
		  they were my interests. Like, when I got home from school I used to want to
		  play and piano and that sort of thing. And I'm very lucky because my interests
		  are actually my work and in so many ways any interest that I have can become a
		  part of my work, like a few months ago I bought a pair of skates and just
		  fancied learning how to roller skate and we're going to have a rolling skating
		  section in a video. I think in a way that's the wonderful thing about art, like
		  music, dancing, that sort of thing, everything you do can become your work. You
		  know, like if you're cleaning up one night you might suddenly realise what a
		  great routine it would make with a broom and that. You know, it's just keep
		  your mind open for all these thing. It's really fun, life become work. (1981,

		<DD> It's an extraordinary series of things that can act as inspiration,

		  that they are my main forms of inspiration. Particulary films over the years,
		  because I suppose with visual imaginary [<I>???</I>] -e- it's such powerful
		  stuff, it can hang around in your head for a long time and come back. So when
		  you come to the next album, chances are to find something interesting again,
		  something new. You have to look that much further, you have to go OVER the
		  hill, rather than just UP the hill this time [<I>Smiling</I>]. And also between
		  albums [<I>???</I>] -e- if you're not careful, you just make the writing a
		  continuation of the album before, rather than starting something new, trying to
		  say something new on the album, which hopefully is what it's about. You know, I
		  think most people still think of me as the `` Wuthering Heights'' weird, lots

		  [<I>???</I>] So it was quite difficult knowing what to do with this video. I
		  ended up feeling the best thing to do was to turn it into a performance, and I
		  worked with Peter Richardson. He was a lot of fun to work with. We wrote it
		  together, and he gave me much more freedom in front of the camera, to be a
		  performer working with a partner. And really I think we wanted to get across
