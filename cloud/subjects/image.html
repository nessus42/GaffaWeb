		<DD> I think it's really quite funny, 'cause it's the last thing in the

		  know it's incredibly flattering but I can't conceive it, myself.

		<DD> Yeah, I mean I think that... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> What kind of an image? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well I can only really interpret it from what other people see it
		  as. Because they're the ones that see it, I just do it. And I'm not sure, I
		  think they get a theatrical thing. And hopefully it's just a little more
		  interesting then if I was just standing. I'm trying to project something that
		  will say something rather than just flit. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And I think that in our society it's very common to have put
		everybody in little boxes. So as you have definitely an image, but what kind of
		an image you want? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well I suppose I don't really want an image. I just feel that
		  whenever I preform anything, which is really where the image comes from...
		  Images do seem to be physical. You don't often get an image from someone's
		  music, you get an image of them as a person. And for me I'd like that to keep
		  changing, because I don't think I have an image, I just try to project
		  whatever's happening in a song at that moment. And every song is different, and
		  that's how I would like to be - I would like to be different with every song.
		  Rather than the same old thing, do you know what I mean? (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> I guess out of everything that I have to do, its the thing that I
		  question the most. Because it was something that I was very aware of when I was
		  outside the business. You know like, just reading articles of my heroes and
		  maybe reading something that I thought ``No!", you know, ``They wouldn't do
		  that.'' And when I started doing it, I realized that maybe half the things I'd
		  read just weren't true, but I'd believe them. And that worries me to a certain
		  extent that things that are written down, that maybe have been slightly
		  misinterpreted, will be totally believed by an awful lot of people. (1980,

		<DD> There're so many females that don't fit in any category at all.
		  There're a lot of people that would love to pin them in those categories. When
		  an image is created around a person - especially a female - there're so many
		  presumptions thrown in. There are a lot of female artists who are stereotypes,
		  and who nearly fall into those niches people talk about, but there're a lot who
		  don't. When you mention traditional females it sounds as though they have
		  nothing within them - epitomes of a situation. Any singer is a human being
		  working inside and letting all kinds of different energies come out. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The labelling that comes with the creation of an image is always a
		  disadvantage. When someone has done something very artistic, it won't be let
		  out when they've been packaged. When a female is attractive - whether she
		  emphasizes it or not - she's automatically projected with sexual connotations.
		  I don't think that happens so readily with me. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> When I started, it seemed that a lot of singers were singing as if
		  they weren't even related to the lyrics. They'd sing about heartbreak, and keep
		  a big smile on their faces. For me, the singer is the expression of the song.
		  An image should be created for each SONG, or at least each record: the
		  personality that goes with that particular music. But I don't think that will
		  ever be seen by the majority of people who look at the pictures and see the
		  so-called images come out. </DD>

		<DD> When I was first happening, the only other female on the level I was
		  being promoted at was Blondie. We were both being promoted on the basis of
		  being female bodies as well as singers. I wasn't looked at as being a female
		  singer-songwriter. People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own
		  songs or played the piano until maybe a year or so after that. The media just
		  promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist
		  inside a female body. The idea of the body as a vehicle is... just one of those
		  things. But I'm someone who talks about music and songs. (1982, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Because there's always in the past been a great distance between
		the real ``you'' and that's sitting here and the ``you'' that appears on
		records and video. There has been very little in common between the two. It's
		been someone else making these records and writing these songs and being in
		these videos. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I don't know... certainly being in the videos, yes, but I think
		  there has been a little me writing the records but it's been hidden. It's
		  another side of you that isn't actually seen in every day life, I would have
		  thought. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think you're right, absolutely, but don't you think that's so of
		  most people who deal in the arts? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> It's an exaggeration... </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And sometimes it's quite shocking that the person that makes the
		  art, that speaks in the art, is not the one that you meet. I must say for me
		  that's what I find so fascinating about meeting people whose work I like. I
		  really like it when they're very different from their work. Like when you meet
		  comedians, it doesn't worry me at all if they're not necessarily funny - in
		  fact I find it absolutely fascinating if they are very serious. It shows that
		  very distinct mark that I think is there - I think creative people have this
		  need to hide almost. Maybe it's because of the fact that what they're doing is
		  so vulnerable - they are totally exposing themselves in a way that wouldn't
		  happen in everyday life. Maybe they have this tremendous need to hide at all
		  the other points in their life. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So you don't mind having this other persona to hide behind because
		people probably have a great misconception of what you are about? It's like
		they imagine that clint eastwood goes round with a gun tucked in his belt
		saying ``make my day'' and krlie minogue is really that person in
		``neighbours.'' people actually believe these things and they probably believe
		that you are as you appear in these videos, and ``yes that's what she's like
		when she's at home at night?" </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think that's a very general thing that happens to people. You
		  can't blame them for that, because that's the information they're given, and
		  therefore that's what they receive. I think it's only people who are involved
		  in anything like that who actually understand what goes on, and I think people
		  in the business aren't really surprised when someone who is very extrovert on
		  stage can actually be a very quiet person. To someone who has only seen that
		  extrovert it must be like me a schizophrenic for the first time. They would
		  expect them to be exactly what they see and I think occasionally people do go
		  to the effort of projecting that for everyone. I think that's a big danger for
		  performers, because then there is no time when they are actually themselves and
		  I do think it's a terrific danger for performers or famous people to completely
		  lose themselves. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> They start believing the whole image, they start believing the
		press handouts and they start to live that life. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And then it becomes increasingly bizarre and increasingly over the
		top, and then they wind up in a real mess. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, it is an incredibly bizarre thing. The whole situation is all
		  very blown out of proportion, isn't it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Phoney? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Phoney? Yes, I think there's such a tremendous amount of false
		  situations created and that's the problem. I think art in itself is quite often
		  that - making a record is like creating an illusion, like a
		  <A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> is making an illusion. You might want
		  it to look or sound real but it is creating an illusion. You put pieces of this
		  and that, different pieces of time together to create this one image and that's
		  a fake, that is not as it happens. I think that's o.K., because with art that's
		  what you want to create; you want to create a picture or story for people and
		  in things like live performances that's where you come into see the real person
		  but then again it's always bigger than life. I think this is what art wants to
		  be; to say something real, but to get it across it tends to be one in a way
		  that makes it bigger than life. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So there's no true art that is real? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think there is true art and I think art is dealing with
		  illusion, so I think it's O.K. that things which are pieced together can be
		  real art and I think it is real art only in the viewer or the listener's eyes.
		  That's the great thing about ``art", it's only good when the ``appreciator''
		  like it. It's a very personal thing and again I think that's what art is; a
		  very personal communication. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I can accept that people might find my image sensual, [<I>she says

		  But I'm certainly no sex symbol. Why should the way I look have any bearing on
