		<DD> No, I don't actually. The only times I listen to them is when I've
		  got a routine to work out. If I'm doing a TV or something, then I have to
		  listen through it to work out the routine. But that's the only time. (1979,

	 <P> <B> Which is your favourite song out of those you have written and why?
		Which of your albums is the more important to you personally and why? There
		seems to be more emphasis on lionheart in your letters and in the club
		merchandise. </B></P>

		<DD> I haven't really got a favourite song, because I have a very
		  love/hate relationship with them all, and sometimes get bored with them. I tend
		  to associate things with a song, instead of just seeing it for itself. I think
		  the album which is most important for me is the one I'm working on, and I think
		  it's obvious why: I'm much more involved, and it's something I want and I
		  haven't done it for a long time. Probably the reason there's been more emphasis
		  on Lionheart in all the merchandising and from myself, is just because that was
		  my last album. And it's quite catchy: we were calling the people around us
		  during the Tour ``Lionhearts'' and that was a very significant part of last
		  year for all of us. But soon it won't be so much ``Lionheart'' any more. It'll
		  be something else. (1980, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate6.html">KBC

		<DD> It's a very close tie between this and the last one. I think
		  probably this one. The one that you've just done is normally your most favorite
		  and then becomes your least favorite and you want to get on and do something
		  else and make it better. [<I>Laughs</I>] (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Um... I think the last album you do is always the one that's closest
		  to you because you've just spent the nearest part of your life to it, but I
		  think for artistic fulfillment, I think The Dreaming was certainly rewarding -
		  to have actually achieved some of the things that we set out to do. But you
		  have very much a strange relationship. I don't know if you really like anything
		  you do. </DD>

		<DD> It's very much a love/hate relationship I think any author has with

		  achieve, especially when they were difficult. I was quite pleased with
		  ``Houdini'' and `` Breathing'' and `` Running Up That Hill.'' (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> The song `` The Sensual World'' `` Cloudbusting'' has fond memories
