	 <P> <B> Yeah. </B></P>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well that was really inspired by a person called Lindsay Kemp, who I
		  saw a few years ago in an amazing stage show and I'd just never seen anything
		  like it. This guy was moving without saying anything, and the whole audience
		  were just completely lost, they were just mad over him. And I'd never seen
		  anything so inspiring, and I thought that maybe if I could move and sing at the

		<DD> Well the best thing to do is have a look in theatrical papers like
		  <CITE>Time Out</CITE> and that. They do a lot of good courses that are pretty
		  cheap. Places in London and all over the country, I think. Where you can just
		  go along with students. There are some good schools, but you need
		  qualifications for a lot of them. So personally, I'd go for the courses, cause
		  they're more inspiring anyway. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I did ballet for a year, on and off, when I was at my dancing
		  school. And I found it very hard to actually get on with the people in the
		  room, that was really my big problem. It's such an important thing for a dancer
		  because it is the classical basics and there's no way [<I>Of</I>] getting
		  around it. You know, if you want to have good technique, then you really do
		  have to do ballet. And so for many technical points I'm not really correct when
		  I dance. But I do feel that dance is something that is very free and you can't
		  tie it down. It's techniques, but it's also emotion and for me the emotion is
		  the thing that really matters. You can have technique, you know, that's superb
		  and yet be as flat as a board. And yet, there are children that have never
		  trained at dancing, and yet they make you want to cry, because they move like
		  angels. They're beautiful, they're so free and they're just purely stating what
		  they're feeling and it's so delightful because they're enjoying everything they
		  do. And I think that's what dance is about, the enjoyment of that feeling of
		  movement and freedom, it's like suddenly breaking through a barrier. (1980,

		<DD> It did an incredible amount, especially when I started back then. I

		  know when I was going to be making the first album, and I had, in a way, time
		  to kill and use until that point. And I had very little experience... certainly
		  the business, I mean coming straight from school. And I had almost two clear
		  years of going to the dance school, learning to dance, getting more control
		  over my body, and writing. Just using the time generally as a kind of
		  foundation for what was to happen next when the album was released and the
		  single was very successful. I think without having used the time like that,
		  things could've been very different for me. I was very lucky. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, and those ones that you mentioned particulary. I worked with a

		  with integrating the routines between the three of us. And the `` Running Up
		  That Hill'' dance performance, I worked with a lady chirographer called Dianne
		  Grey, and I really enjoyed that. It was really exciting to work with someone

		<DD> I don't think I actually modeled the movements, but I've definitely

		<DD> I think there is a very basic logic to that, in that if you dance,

		  it's just someone tapping out rhythms on a drum. That is, music is sound, and

		  saying-goodbye to that dancing side of me, by doing it in a very pure way. It
		  is a very pure dance video without any theatre or anything attached, because I
		  feel very much a shift now from dance into <A
