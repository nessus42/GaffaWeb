		<DD> Yes, I think everyone likes new toys. And it's really getting the
		  time to look around, and also the money, of course, is the big thing, to get
		  new equipment. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im85_pd1.html">Picture

		<DD> We now have an SSL. It's an expensive board, but not the most
		  expensive, and it's very versatile. It has a good sound, and all those
		  facilities. For the money the Soundcraft was great, but the SSL is much more
		  efficient to work with. On the last album we spent a lot of time working around
		  the desk, and on this one it was just working around me. </DD>

		<DD> We're still using two A80s - we work on 48-track all the time,
		  though it drives people crazy. When you get outside people in, you can see
		  their impatience with the machines. We use them with the Lynx, though we used
		  to have a Q-Lok. I'm not sure there's that much in it, but I think the Lynx is
		  quicker. It would be even better if we had 800s. The A80s seem a bit archaic
		  now. </DD>

		<DD> With outboard, I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> the
		  Quantec. It has a crystalline quality to it, very distinctive. I use it on
		  instruments sometimes, but particularly vocals. We've got two Lexicons - the
		  224 and the 224X. We hire stuff in when we mix outboard eqs, like a couple of
		  old Pultecs, they have a really warm sound - warmer than the SSL eq. </DD>

		<DD> We master analogue half inch. A lot of noise, but I still prefer
		  working analogue. At this point we've found it wise not to change machines
		  mid-stream. </DD>

		<DD> Monitoring is on AR18s, and we did get some Gold Spot Tannoys,
		  they're useful for some things, though generally we stick to the 18s, and
		  Auratones. We don't use big speakers. We had some but they sounded awful. </DD>

		<DD> As we have a Fairlight, it tends to negate us getting in other
		  sampling gear. We're pretty well covered with the Fairlight and the DX7 for
		  keyboard and the quality of the Fairlight is much better, though so difficult
		  to use. Everyone says that. I used to programme it myself, but since the new
		  software... I can't keep up. They keep changing it as soon as I learn to
		  programme it. </DD>

		<DD> Sometimes we're happier just flying in the half-inch, the old
		  fashioned technique. There's something about it - I quite like the purist
		  approach. Like tape delay - you can't get that same sound. It doesn't have the
		  same presence, it has a whispy quality. With tape delay it's lovely. </DD>

		<DD> I guess I'm just a sucker for analogue sounds. (1989, <CITE><A
