		of times you've mentioned in your songs a person called gurdjieff. I know a

		are and how he influences are and how he influences you in... Well when you
		make your music? </B></P>

		<DD> Well, Gurdjieff was really an influence in that I'd just read some
		  of his <A HREF="../subjects/books.html">books</A> and really no more than that.
		  And I'd just found a lot of what he said interesting, but that's really as far
		  as it goes. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Maybe we should elaborate a little bit about who the gentleman is?

		<DD> Yes, well Gurdjieff was... he was considered a leader of a religious
		  movement, I think. But as far as I know he just had a lot of ideas about
		  creating a way that would make people stronger and more together. And it's just
		  a different way of doing it. And it was also trying to go for a more western
		  way of doing. But I do very little about it, so I really wouldn't like to say
		  very much because it's a subject that I feel if I'm going to speak about than I
		  should know what I'm talking about and I don't. (1982, <CITE><A
