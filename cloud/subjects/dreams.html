		<DD> Peter O'Toole came round to dinner last week and my mum met him and
		  thought he was wonderful. Keith Moon often comes round for tea as well. I have
		  a lot of vivid dreams, most of which I can't mention. The images I get from
		  them sometimes bleed into my songs. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Most of Kate's heroes like Oscar Wilde, the Pythons, Roxy Music,
		Billie Holiday and Hitchcock have all visited her, but her mum didn't like
		Hitchcock - maybe she was just frightened by him? </B></P>

		<DD> Hitchcock was definitely a genius. His dreams must have been
		  extraordinary. He must have plucked his ideas out of the sky, or had a private
		  line to Mars. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i85_mm2.html">Melody

		<DD> I think that's how human beings are, though, I don't think anyone

		<DD> It's strange, a few people have started asking me that question
