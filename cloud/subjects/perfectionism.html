		<DD> Too many to mention, and I think most people do tend to look at

		<DD> I don't know if that's a word that is a real word, if you know what
		  I mean, because you can never make anything perfect. You can strive for it, but
		  I think if you continue to strive for it you would never get anywhere. I think
		  you have to recognize a point where things are as good as they can be, within
		  the limitations, before they start going off again. It's definitely a peak and
		  then it can go off. So I think you just hopefully have to recognize where more
		  effort will make it better, but when to stop. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Who do you use as your person to tell you when to stop, or is it

		<DD> It's almost like the music itself dictates it. When a track is
		  sounding right, when it's ready, it is, you can just feel it. And then you mix
		  it. That's when you sort of play with all the little raw edges, but you just
		  know when everything's finished recording. (1985, <CITE><A
