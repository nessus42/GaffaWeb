		<DD> I've changed. I don't pretend it's not there any more, which I used
		  to do. I'm not worried about being rich, I just didn't think of taking
		  advantage of it. Now I buy things that I can use, things that will help me,
		  like synthesisers and drum machines. </DD>

		  with, like a country house which I don't need. [<I>Actually, about two years
		  after giving this interview, kate bought - a country house. - ied</I>] I'd
		  rather buy a huge synthesiser that I could live with all day. (1981, <CITE><A
