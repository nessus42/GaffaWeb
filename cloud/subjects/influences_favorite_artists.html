		<DD> First songs I ever sang were dirty sea shanties. I'm very proud of
		  it, I can't think of a nicer influence. Traditional music says a great deal
		  about the country. English folk music is a lot different from Irish folk music,
		  not only musically, but lyrically. I mean, that song ``She Moves Thro' the
		  Fair:'' it sums up the Irish spirit. It's incredible, so moving. (1980, Oct 10,

		<DD> When I was really little most of the music that influenced me was my
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A>'s. I've got two older brothers who
		  went through a long phase of being into traditional music, English and Irish in
		  particular, so it's always been played in the house. My mother's Irish and she
		  always had relatives popping around, the vast majority of whom were superb
		  musicians. They'd come around and play accordions and things. HER FATHER WAS A
		  KEEN PIANIST, AND ALTHOUGH SHE BEGAN TAKING VIOLIN LESSONS, SHE WAS ONLY NINE
		  YEARS OLD WHEN SHE'D DECIDED TO TAKE UP PIANO AND SONGWRITING. IN HER EARLY
		  TEENS, SHE STARTED LISTENING TO MORE CONTEMPORARY SOUNDS. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I remember the early Roxy Music albums, SHE SWOONS. It was like
		  ``Ah! This is *my* music, this is what I want to be associated with.'' Such
		  wonderful songwriting, very English as well, not American style, and, of course
		  Bryan Ferry's voice. I suppose another one of my biggest heroes as a kid was
		  Elton John, because, at that time, I used to mess about on the piano and sing.
		  Most of the female artists and male singer/songwriters played guitar; they
		  didn't play the piano and write and sing like Elton did. He was just my hero,
		  he's a fantastic piano player, a great performer. These people make a big
		  impression on you. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think I was very lucky cos when I was a small child, my brothers
		  were extremely musical. They were into traditional music: English and Irish
		  folk. They were always playing stuff on the record players and had their own
		  bands and go around the clubs. I got quite involved with it. I would sing along
		  with them and sing harmonies. I think it was important cos when you are very
		  young, your mind is so open for new stimulus and direction. I think it was
		  given to me then, so I didn't really have to spend maybe ten years finding out
		  what I was here for. I think that's been an important part of my life. My other
		  musical influences really have been things from the radio, obviously, because
		  what you listen to are the things that are going on. and again, what my
		  brothers were playing on the radio. At a later stage, I started seeking out my
		  own stimulus and that came from people like, especially Billie Holiday. She was
		  a really important thing to happen to me. Her voice just really did things to
		  me. so emotional and so tearing. I still can't get over how incredible her
		  voice was and her presence. I'm into more progressive people, I guess, like
		  David Bowie and Roxy Music and Steely Dan. I think they are a very
		  underestimated group, especially in England. They really are an important
		  musical influence. And nearly anything really. I love so much music. I think
		  that's the amazing thing about it: music can go into every corner of every
		  room. there's so many different styles of music. everyone is great in their own
		  right - it's just a matter of personal taste, really. (1978, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> It fascinates me that, despite the basic rock instrumentation which
		you employ, your music doesn't seem to owe very much of its ancestry to
		american sources. I would venture to say you're one in the very few popular
		artists to have evolved such a uniquely <CITE>british</CITE> kind of music.

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, that's very interesting. I think probably most of the stuff I
		  have liked, though, has actually been English, and possibly that's why my roots
		  aren't American. Whereas perhaps with the majority of other people, well, you
		  know, they were listening to Elvis and people like that and most of their
		  heroes would have been American. But the artists I liked, such as Roxy Music
		  and David Bowie, they were all singing in English accents and, in fact, were
		  among the <CITE>few</CITE> in England who were actually doing so at that time.
		  I mean to say, Elton John, Robert Palmer and Robert Plant sound American when
		  they sing, although of course they're English. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> So what about the irish flavour in your music? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I feel that strongly, being torn between the Irish and the English
		  blood in me, really. And the Irish influence is definitely very strong. My
		  mother was always playing Irish music, and again, I think when you are really
		  young, things get in and get in deeper because you haven't got as many walls
		  up. I just - it's the same as my mother - I watch her, and when the pipes start
		  playing, ``Yahoo!", you know, everything just lights up and it can be so
		  inspiring. It's just emotional stuff. I think I was really lucky to be given
		  that kind of stimulus. It's really <CITE>heavy,</CITE> emotionally - the pipes,
		  they really tear it out of your heart. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And I think it's very similar in a way to a lot of the traditional
		  music that I was again influenced by when I was very little... by my
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A>. My brothers were really into folk
		  music. And a lot of folk music is so into telling stories. And it's in a way
		  something that doesn't feature so much in contemporary music any more. I think
		  contemporary music is used to help relationships a lot of the time. Like you go
		  to the disco and you meet someone, so you have a song, and it's your song. It's
		  more about that then actually telling stories. Like the traditional things are.
		  And I think that's a big fascination for me. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well is this a recent thing? Like on your last couple of albums
		I've noticed a lot more like jigs and stuff and folk instrumentation. Is this a

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think I've always been really influenced by it, but I haven't been
		  able to express it through my songs. It's weird, trying to talk about the
		  process of writing. But it does actually take over you and you don't have
		  control over it beyond a certain point. And it's only really, I suppose, the
		  last couple of albums, where I feel I've had enough control over the process to
		  be able to express the influences that are in there. And particulary the Irish
		  ones. I've wanted to work with Irish musicians and the pipes and fiddles for a
		  long time but haven't really had anywhere in my music for them. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> She loves Steely Dan and David Bowie ("I wish I could write

		<DD> I really enjoy some female songwriters, like Joni Mitchell, but it's

		  I like the guts that men have in performing and singing, like the punks, like

		<DD> I don't regard myself as a rock 'n' roll writer. I'd love it if

		  don't think I am. Some of the punks and new wave songs are so clever. Quite
		  amazing really. It's a modern poetry idiom. Some of the lyrics are fantastic,
		  so imaginative, not sticking to a reality level, shooting off and coming back

		<DD> I really admire those bands and I really admired the Sex Pistols

		  were great. I admired them so much just for the freshness and the guts although
		  I did get a hypey vibe off it and that they were in fact being pushed around
		  because it seemed more an image that was being forced upon them from what
		  people were expecting. </DD>

		<DD> I feel apart from those bands because I feel I"m in a different

		<DD> I think they're on a new level inas much as... it's hard to explain,

		  They're giving people the stimulation to do what they want and I think I'm
		  maybe just making people think about it, if I'm doing anything. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah. I'm probably, if anything, stimulating the emotional end, the

		  it's not what... I'm... here to... do. I really love rock 'n' roll. I think
		  it's an incredible force but there's something about it that I don't get on
		  with when I write it, maybe because I'm very concerned about melodies in my
		  music and generally I find rock 'n' roll tends to neglect it a bit because it's
		  got so much rhythm and voice that you don't need so much music. </DD>

		<DD> Some of the new wave, though, is so melodic. Like the Rich Kids. I'm

		<DD> Mind you. I identify with new wave music. We're both trying to stir

		<DD> The good thing about people like the Boomtown Rats is that not only

		  and examining them. There's very little music on my album that will make you

		<DD> I think an interesting thing I happening in the music scene at the
		  moment - I think from the beginning of this year, especially in
		  <A HREF="../subjects/england.html">England</A>. It was purely because of punk.
		  It was a very quick dynamic thing that happened and I think its purpose was in
		  order to bring new things out of it. we now have a sort of thing called new
		  wave, which has come from punk, but it's not like punk at all. It's rich in
		  interesting lyrics, completely different attitude towards music. There are very
		  interesting lyrics that are based a lot more on reality than a lot of things
		  have gone before. I think that's the trouble with a lot of music that was
		  happening: things were becoming purely romantic bubblegum. just talking about
		  boy meets girl. The great thing about music is that it's a message. You
		  actually have the power to convey a message to people to let them know about
		  something they didn't know about before. I think that's an incredible
		  responsibility on behalf of the artist. I find myself very aware of that and I
		  often wonder if I am doing any good, but I know it's my purpose. It's what I

		  the other is a ``Kyrie Eleison'' sung by a choir of nuns. Now who's put them
		  together I don't know, but it's a very strange combination. At points the
		  chords really clash unconventionally, and then resolve themselves beautifully.
		  </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well let's see if this mixture appeals to us as much as it does to
		you. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>A portion of the recording is played.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> One of the most historic records in pop music is one by the
		drifters, called ``there goes my baby.'' it was the first rhythm-and-blues song
		to use strings. And the dissonance at times, radio listeners thought they were
		listening to two different songs being played together. And that is precisely
		what we have here-- </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think so. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> - The kyrie eleison, and this voodoo chant, which I found haunting.
		[<I>Gambaccini has misunderstood this to be a voodoo chant; In fact, the man
		singing, as kate put it, ``from a temple", is clearly vocalising a moslem
		morning prayer, such as those which priests cry from minarets in middle-eastern
		temples. Kate very tentatively corrects him. - ied</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It...it's incredible, yes. It... There isn't actually a Voodoo chant
		  in this song. What I found very interesting is, again, the way he's using his
		  voice like an instrument, the way he's projecting out of his mouth. Now, I
		  presume that it's the prayer that he would sing from his temple as the sun's
		  coming up in the morning. And something I also find very interesting is the
		  language thing. Although we say that music is international, and, um, you know,
		  words don't matter, when was the last time in our charts we... we had a song
		  with people singing in another language - other than English? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Plastic bertrand, ``ca plane pour moi.'' [<I>Kate laughs.</I>] that
		was the last top ten in a foreign language, I believe. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It doesn't happen much, though. </DD>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> NO. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And I think what is interesting: As soon as you have someone singing
		  in a different language, it automatically becomes an instrument, instead of a
		  voice, because you can no longer relate to what they're singing about. And I
		  find this very interesting. And it would be nice if we had more songs that were
		  sung in other languages. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And now, one of my favourites, oh yes, kate and anna mcgarrigle.
		Now this is a, a duet, and it's from their first album together, isn't it?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, as far as I know. I think they're lovely. I really do, I think
		  they're great. And their energy is very positive and very pure. And we saw them
		  live a couple of years ago, and that was just the same: very honest, and very
		  simple. And it was beautiful. And this again is in a foreign language. We think
		  it's in Old French; and Anna was in on the writing of this, and I just think
		  it's a lovely track. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Dare I pronounce this one, or are you gonna give it a go? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, 'ere we go! ``Complainte pour Ste. Catherine." </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Part of the song, actually sung in modern french with a heavy
		canadian accent, is played.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> From a marvellous eponymous album, <CITE>kate and anna
		mcgarrigle</CITE>. Kate, has there ever been an anna with which you wished you
		could harmonise? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Um, not really, I must admit. I find that working with myself is
		  much... it's interesting because I can tell myself off and get very annoyed
		  with it. Or I'd use a choir. Or I'd use male voices, I think, because I'd
		  rather put myself with myself or with something very different, rather than
		  with another female. That's just the way I feel about working at the moment.
		  But working with other people on any level is just so incredible, because as
		  soon as you have another person there, you have something to bounce of, you...
		  you haven't got your own criticisms and ideals bouncing around in there. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> And this is why you've enjoyed working with peter gabriel, even if
		only on backing vocals for his song. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Lovely! Uh, that's a really good experience. What's nice about that
		  is being able to walk into someone else's studio and not have the
		  responsibility of the sounds, and everything. You just go in and sing and have
		  a really great time. And for me that was a great honour to be on that album,
		  because the music is so good. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> It's certainly one of my ten favourite albums of the year. </B></P>

		  singing. Just complete silence. And then when he's finished his notes everyone

		  tired. You get such a form of concentrated listening - you've got to listen for
