		<DD> Oh, yeah. I have what I call my own religion. I think everyone's got
		  their own religion. They are various certain things I stick by. </DD>

		<DD> Believe in God? Well I think there are a lot of Gods and I certainly
		  believe in my God, but I wonder if it's the same God as yours. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, I believe that it is. Do you believe in the lord Jesus
		Christ? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I believe in him, but he's not the one I live my life by, I must
		  admit. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> We, as christians, we do believe in the lord Jesus Christ and I
		know for a fact that if you believe in God and he has it written that the only
		way to him is through the lord Jesus Christ then I believe that your God is the
		same as mine. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> So do I. I believe if you believe in anything... I mean if God is
		  really... I hate to say this because it sounds blasphemous, but God is in fact
		  some kind of label for people to put all their belief and
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> into. And I think that if people put
		  all their belief and love into other people and what they're doing, then I
		  think you do find it, I think you do reach an aim. </DD>

	 <P> <B> We're talking about reincarnation again. Christians, of course,
		believe that this is the life which, depending on how you live it, is the only
		life which determines whether you're going to heaven or hell, which precludes
		immediately any sort of reincarnation. Which kind of direction would you tend
		towards? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Well, I think certainly this life at the moment is all we're living,
		  but I think its... I don't see how anyone can really say what happens when our
		  body dies. I mean there's no way of proving where the energy goes. I hope one
		  day they'll be able to tap it. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> It is a very powerful, widely influential force that has extreme

	 <P> <B> We're going to change the subject now. Do you see a connection

		<DD> I don't know, I'm sure there is. I think there's a connection

	 <P> <B> Do you consider yourself a religious person? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That's a question that I get asked a lot. Some people come in,
		  they're so convinced that I'm of a particular order. [<I>Laughs</I>] And I
		  think everyone has something in them that is seeking some kind of religion, but
		  whether I call myself a religious person - I don't think so, no. But I think I
		  am fascinated by religious imagery, I think most people are. And it's one of
		  those things that has an incredibly extreme effect on people and that, from a
		  writer's point of view, is fascinating. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Have you defined your religious feelings? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, I don't think so. I was a Roman Catholic and brought up in Roman
		  Catholic schools. I would never say I was a strict follower of Roman Catholic
		  belief, but a lot of the images are in there; they have to be,they're so
		  strong. Such powerful beautiful, passionate images! There's a lot of suffering
		  in Roman Catholicism. I think I'm looking for not necessarily religion, but
		  ways of helping myself to become more understanding, more complete, a happier
		  person - what we all want in life. But I really don't think I've found a niche.
