		<DD> Jay: I think, yes, initially we resented it and it was a bit of a
		  shock and that's the usually process, finding out whether I wanted to do
		  anything to stop it, because a lot of it was quite unpleasant and very
		  un-[<I>??? Flattering</I>] to me. And we decided that we wouldn't because that
		  would fuel the fire of the sort of people who were doing it. </DD>

		<DD> Jay: Actually for her to do a book we find it's rather difficult
		  because she doesn't get on the [<I>??? Planet</I>] that long. And slight
		  attempts were made of it but I think actually seeing your life spread out in
		  one big long effort is very weird sensation. So, no, they haven't have. Whether
		  they will in the future, I don't know. I doubt it somehow. But I'm sure they'll
		  be plenty more <A HREF="../subjects/books.html">books</A> as far as the ones
		  we've been talking about now. But it's just an unfortunate aspect of the music
		  industry. But, as you say, they are rubbish and they're rubbish in so many
		  details, not in what they say about us but just in what they call ``fact'' is
		  all wrong. And they don't rely them at all, [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] </DD>
