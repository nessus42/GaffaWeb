		<DD> Offstage he's very normal, and that's the kind of thing I believe
		  in. [<I> Kate helped out with the backing vocals on his excellent recent album,

		  - especially after the pressure of going out under your own name. </DD>

		<DD> I was thrilled to do it, and it's not often that I meet people in
		  the same position that I can relate to. It's not like relating to people at
		  EMI, as they're on a completely different side of the fence. (1981, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Peter Gabriel, the pioneer of the instrument, has visibly had a
		huge influence on your development. But one could say that something more

		<DD> It's difficult to say. Comparing me to him is a marvelous
		  compliment, and certainly exaggerated. I greatly admire what he does; he's a
		  brilliant artist. I think that people like him and me are similar because we
		  are trying to do something new. The pop world does not enter into our
		  pre-occupations. We are that kind of people. Peter, of course, but also David
		  Bowie, who was incredibly innovative at a moment when it was needed, Bryan
		  Ferry with Roxy Music, Brian Eno, who can't be honoured enough for what he's
		  done. All are very important musicians, whose influence greatly exceeds their
		  popularity, which lasts three minutes in the charts. (1985, <CITE><A
