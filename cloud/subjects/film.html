		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I have hopes. No plans, though. I think that's very much

		<DD> No, I don't think so. I've got to much to do in music, I've only

		<DD> My plans for the future... Well, I want to get into films. And I
		  want to do more on stage. I love staging my own shows, working out the

		<DD> My favourite is <CITE>Don't Look Now.</CITE> I was incredibly
		  impressed by the tension, the drive and the way that every loose end was tied

		<DD> Some taboo subjects definitely attract me...I don't think I do like
		  particularly gory things. With _Don't<CITE>Look Now,</CITE>
		  <CITE>Psycho</CITE>, it's not the gore so much as the emotional effect - the
		  distortion. I don't think I'd ever go and see <CITE>Texas Chainsaw
		  Massacre</CITE> and <CITE>Friday the 13th,</CITE> things like that. I think
		  it's sick: you <CITE>know</CITE> everybody is going to die disgustingly. I
		  prefer films that work around the subject, build you up... (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i83_nme1.html">NME</A></CITE>)

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Being stuck there could be an idyllic time. I've enjoyed working
		  alone, even as a kid, and I can collect all my thoughts together then. But the
		  prospect of being there with my favorite films is exciting, because I
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> the cinema and rarely get the chance
		  to visit it because of my work. So I'd go to town on my selection. <CITE>
		  Kagemusha </CITE> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Not a lot of people have heard of this one, but it's by the Japanese
		  director Akira Kurosawa. I just happen to think that this is one of his best.
		  It was a toss up between this and his <CITE>Seven Samurai,</CITE> which is a
		  tremendously atmospheric picture. However, I think this one wins the day.
		  <CITE> Psycho </CITE> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> As there wouldn't be a shower within thousands of miles... or a
		  motel, I feel quite safe having this along with me. Of course it scares me
		  silly, and the fact that it's in black and white only adds to the terror, but
		  Anthony Perkins is so marvellous in it. It's one of those films I can watch
		  lots of times, even though I know the ending. <CITE> Time Bandits </CITE> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This is the kind of film that'll be around for years - like the
		  Disney ones. When Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin of the Monty Python team got
		  together on this they must have been inspired, because it appeals to kids and
		  adults alike. The story is so original and seems to incorporate just about
		  everything from pantomime, fairy tales, drama... the whole show. <CITE>Don't
		  Look Now </CITE> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Donald Sutherland I can always watch - he's got such a wry sense of
		  humour. Ever since I saw him in <CITE>M*A*S*H</CITE> I've been a fan. And yet
		  in this film there's no humour at all. It's a real creepy and has a terrifying
		  climax. But there's such a lot to be observed in the relationship between
		  Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie that you don't get tired of it. <CITE>
		  Night of the Demon </CITE> [<I>U.s. Title: <CITE>curse of the
		  demon</CITE></I><CITE>]</CITE> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This is an oldie, if the fifties can be described as old.
		  <CITE>Night of the Demon</CITE> is one of the better horror films from that
		  period. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat without frightening you
		  out of it. It's about a secret ancient inscription of the rune symbols at
		  Stonehenge. Whoever holds a certain piece of paper with these written on it
		  incites the wrath of the demons. Very exciting. <CITE> Barry Lyndon </CITE>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Not too much to say about this film, except that I love the story
		  and the whole atmosphere of the film. It's just a picture that moves me
		  emotionally. <CITE> Notorious </CITE> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Marvellous Hitchcock stuff. Really vintage and one of the classics
		  with Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant. It's that buildup of mystery that fascinate
		  me. <CITE> Pinocchio </CITE> </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> This film just goes on forever; it's timeless. I saw it when I was a
		  child, and I go to see it whenever it comes on the circuit. Magical! I
		  <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> fairy stories anyway. <CITE> To Kill a

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I read the book, then saw the film, and I wasn't disappointed. It's

		<DD> Working this lot out, I've realized what contrasting tastes I've got
		  in films. But here, I think that the sequel to <CITE>Star Wars</CITE> is better
		  than its predecessor. There was always the risk that it would be some kind of
		  anti-climax, but it goes beyond expectations. (1983, <CITE><A

		  images from films, but they are very potent and take you somewhere else -

	 <P> <B> Does having such complete control seem overwhelming at times? Yes,

		<DD> Maybe not a full length feature, but yes I'd love to, I really would

		  restricted to making visuals in the context of videos to music that already
		  exists. I'd really like to play with this a lot more. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I have this desire in the back of my mind now of making music and

		  VIDEOS. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Bush - who also produces her albums and plays piano and synthesizer

		<DD> What I wanted to do was turn that into a half-hour film integrating

		  was just too tired. I did not have the energy. (1990, <CITE><A

		  STARRING DEBORAH KERR AND MICHAEL REDGRAVE) which I saw when I was a kid. It

		  horror film called <CITE>Night Of The Demon</CITE> (ADAPTED FROM THE M.R. JAMES
		  SHORT STORY ``CASTIN THE RUNES'' AND DIRECTED IN 1957 BY JACQUES TOURNEUR,
