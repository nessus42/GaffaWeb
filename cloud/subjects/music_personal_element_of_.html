		<DD> Whenever I base something on a book or a film I don't take a direct

		<DD> "The Infant Kiss'' had to be done on a very intimate basis, it be a
		  woman singing about her own fear, because it makes her so much more vulnerable.
		  If it had just been an observation, saying ``She's really frightened; she's
		  worried,'' you could never really tell what she was feeling. So I put it as
		  coming through myself. </DD>

		<DD> I'm not actually thinking of myself falling in love with the little
		  boy, I was putting myself in her place. Feeling what I do for children - I love
		  children - and then suddenly seeing something in their eyes you don't want to
		  see. </DD>

		<DD> It's like when a tiny kid turns round and says to you ``You're a
		  bastard'' or ``Fuck off": it's instinctive to feel repulsed by it. [<I>???</I>]
		  -that experience into a different situation. Otherwise I'd be writing and
		  singing about situations I've never experienced, and in order to be convincing
		  you have to have a certain amount of knowledge and conviction. It's a strange
		  mixture, I know, but I rarely write purely personal songs from experience.

	 <P> <B> Exactly. </B></P>

		<DD> I have done it. On the other albums more than this one. But I often
		  wonder how valid it is to write a song purely about oneself. I worry about
		  being too indulgent, and there is the thing about giving too much away. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It doesn't worry me giving it to the public because I think the
		  public understand how personal it is, but when you write a song for an album
		  it's up for everyone to pull apart. `` Fullhouse'' was probably quite
		  autobiographical, you know: talking about how hard I find it to cope with all
		  the feelings I get, from paranoia, pressure, anger, that sort of thing. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> My feelings are in there, but they're probably disguised. I've
		  really enjoyed artists who indulge in personal writing. People like Leonard
		  Cohen. I <CITE>admire</CITE> him, but I just can't stand <CITE>listening</CITE>
		  to him. At the end of the album you feel so depressed. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, I guess when you have something so extreme happen in your life
		  you have to write about it. That's probably another reason why I tend to put my
		  personal feelings into another situation: because you can come up with so much
		  variance. I've never actually shot anyone, but in a song I can do it, and in
		  some ways it's much more exciting, more symbolic. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> It would really worry me if I thought my art was being untruthful.
		  Being true to something is the closest way to express things. But then in
		  another way, the whole thing is untruthful - I'm being someone I'm not; I'm
		  writing about situations I'll probably never be in. Behind it there has to be
		  sincerity. Insincerity doesn't ring right; it has a nasty taste. (1982,

		<DD> The worst thing? The pressures, I suppose. They come in from so many
		  different levels - from so many people - that they feel destructive towards me
		  as a human being. Although it happens very rarely. And I have so little time to
		  do things I want to. </DD>

		<DD> Oh, no. I am expressing myself, but it's also something else - it's

		<DD> It scares me that I work too hard. I can be so tired and involved in
		  work that I'm not living on another level. It's a reality of the situation. I
		  have to do things I don't want to, so that I can do what I want the rest of the
		  time. It's that I don't seem to have time to myself. (1982, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Many of your songs are very intimate and extremely revealing of
		your own inner life. Does it ever happen that you write a song for

		<DD> No, that's never happened yet. The only reason a song will get
		  dropped is that it's not good enough - you know, the tune is a bit weak, or the
		  lyrics aren't good enough, or the concept isn't tight enough. If it was good
		  enough it would go on. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> If they are personal that's because they reflect influences digested

		<DD> I've had a calm life but I am fascinated by the negative aspects of

		  disturbing and powerful. I do have a special fascination for films like
		  _Don't<CITE>Look Now</CITE> and <CITE>The Cruel Sea</CITE> - watery films. I
		  hope I'm not writing from a morbid point of view. I like positive endings.

		<DD> I think all art to some extent has to be personal and I think what's
		  difficult is not handing that work out to the world but its having to then
		  justify it and explain it to people. That's what's difficult. Then you are
		  caught in a moment where you have to analyze it or somehow go back on moments
		  that were moments ago. It somehow takes things out of its context. I think
		  really you should just go out to the world and be as personal as you dare.
