		<DD> I get lots of questions about where I live, usually prompted by
		  inaccurate information in papers. You really can't believe everything you read.
		  We all three live in the same house, but we each have separate flats, which are
		  connected by intercom for ease of communication. [<I>Kate has since re-moved to
		  a house of her own, outside the city. I believe that John has also moved out,
		  but that the apartment building is still owned by the bush family. - ied</I>]
		  To find the house you take the second turning on the right and keep straight on
		  till morning. (1979, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate3.html">KBC 3</A></CITE>)

		  It's fun to be in cities like New York, but I don't enjoy living there. I like
		  to have somewhere where there's a garden and good air. (1983, <CITE><A
