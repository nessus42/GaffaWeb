	 <P><B> And you know her music does strike me in a way as rather beatlish. I
		mean, most rock artists work within one or another genre but usually tend to be
		limited by it. But, like the beatles, you're always able to flit around in
		different styles while yet remaining recognizably yourself. Also you're always
		musical, always dynamic, always very polished... </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Del: Yes, exactly. And it's remarkable, too, because you were never
		really exposed to the beatles at the time. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Kate: Well, I take that as a ``great'' compliment. I think that,
		because I was too young to be caught up in beatlemania, then when I
		<CITE>did</CITE> hear them - and that wasn't perhaps till four or five years
		ago, I heard them objectively, if you like. And I was just so astounded by
		their musical quality, I mean, <CITE>every</CITE> track! And something like the
		``walrus'' track, it's still so contemporary. I mean, there are very few people
		who are doing something really good. But apart from the sixties, when there was
		this huge wealth of stuff like motown and everything, it really does seem that
		you get just two or three who are fantastic. Occasionally you get great bursts
		of wonderful things, but not often. (1985, <CITE><A

		something, I feel, every composer aspires to. (1984, <CITE><A
