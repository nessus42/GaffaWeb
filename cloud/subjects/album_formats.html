		<DD> Well, I certainly have my idea of the singles that I want to
		  release, and I put them forward. But they have to be agreed by the company,
		  because obviously the company aims to sell records, and unless they think the
		  single's capable, they're not going to release it. But so far we've agreed and
		  it's been great. </DD>

	 <P> <B> What's your own personal feelings, apposed to maybe your record
		companies idea, of talking singles from lps. Do you think the record company
		actually a tremendously fair deal by that? [<I>Note - in many countries outside
		the u.s., britain included, it wasn't common practice until the 70s to release
		songs on both albums and singles. For instance, many of the beatles hits were
		never originally on albums in britain.</I>] </B></P>

		<DD> Well that's something that, generally, I don't really know about.
		  But I know in my case that I do have certain ideas of the songs that I want to
		  come out and I put that to the record company, and they think about it, and
		  obviously they have things they want to put out, and we come to an agreement.

		<DD> Apart from the U.S.A. releases, we normally know up front what's
		  happening, if there's to be a special release. In the cases of the Irish ``
		  Night of the Swallow,'' the U.S. mini-L.P., the European ``Suspended in Gaffa''
		  and the French ``<CITE>Ne T'enfuis pas,</CITE>'' we designed the bags, hoping
		  they would particularly appeal to that market. (1984, <CITE><A

		<DD> I'm afraid to say that EMI don't find them ``commercially viable
		  propositions'' We very much wanted to release the single ``The Dreaming'' on a
		  twelve-inch - we could have got a beautiful-sounding cut with that one. I could
		  lend you my twelve-inch if you'd like to hear how good it is! (1984, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think I've always seen myself as someone who writes songs that go
		  on an album. If there are any singles among them, then they can be chosen for
		  that. But apart from `` Wuthering Heights'' I was always an album-orientated
		  artist. Even if my singles are more remembered. </DD>

	 <P> <B> You have no regard for those instantaneous qualities of the single?

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Each album is like a rocket. I build it up as much as I can, and see
		  how high it goes. I'm never aware of any commercial value. I never sit down to
		  write a single. Whenever I write, I'm challenging myself in some area. Everyone
		  who creates something considers themself an artist in some way, don't they?

	 <P> <B> I wonder whether you really want to do music - whether you'd rather

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I'm doing that as well, really, aren't I? Maybe it's wrong to see me
		  as a pop personality. You're going to keep changing - `` Wuthering Heights''
		  was a story with music and dancing, but I've changed so much since then. The
		  things that the media most remember about me are those things. Some people see
		  that I am changing, but... oh, not as many as the people who hang onto those
		  singles. But I am beginning to be seen as an albums artist. </DD>

	 <P> <B> What's an albums artist? </B></P>

		<DD> It's not being a pop personality or whatever it was you called me.
		  I'm not interested in making singles. Maybe I will make some ``singles'' one
		  day... (1982, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i82_nme.html">NME</A></CITE>) </DD>

	 <P> <B> About a year ago I purchased a u.s. Promo record containing four

		<DD> I shouldn't worry, you're not in any trouble for buying it, but
