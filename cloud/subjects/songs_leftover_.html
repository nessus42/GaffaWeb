		<DD> That's not happened much. There's only been stuff dumped on
		  Lionheart and Never for Ever, the second and third albums, and I prefer to
		  think <CITE>resting</CITE> rather than ``dumped'' Some of the stuff would be
		  fun for a quick listen, perhaps, but not for much else. On the new album, there
		  was actually quite a lot of stuff that didn't get on. But it was in a very
		  embryonic sort of stage, or else I just felt it wasn't interesting enough, it
		  was too ordinary. Although there were a couple of finished songs that nearly
		  made it to the album but didn't. I just didn't feel they were strong enough.
		  And the thing with <CITE>The Ninth Wave</CITE>, the second side, was I had the
		  idea and wrote a first draft of it and, though I hadn't written all the
		  material, it sounded like it would work. The hardest thing was making one song
		  flow into the other one because creating dynamics in one song is very different
		  from building it between seven songs. You have to sort of pace it very
		  differently and yet hopefully you want it to keep interest and not have any
		  boring bits. But then, by the second stage when things had already begun to be
		  sort of sprinkled on the tracks, I realized there were certain songs that
		  weren't working. The concept was very strong-minded and there were certain
		  things that it certainly _didn't<CITE>want</CITE> having done to it. So I had
		  to totally re-think the thing and say like, ``Okay, look, this song has got to
		  go.'' So, although we'd been working on it, it was still in really quite an
		  embryonic stage and had no part of where it was. So the song would go, but
		  maybe it can be used some time in the future. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Does it sometimes happen, then, that you resurrect songs years
		later, like perhaps any of those hundreds you wrote as a teenager? </B></P>

		<DD> Little bits. There was a little bit resurrected in `` Suspended in
		  Gaffa'' on the last album. No, but this new album was, I think, all sort of
		  contemporary, and little ideas that I'd put down on the Fairlight, which I'd
		  thought might perhaps turn into something, then turned out perfect for a little
		  bit in a song or whatever as the concept started taking more shape. (1985,
