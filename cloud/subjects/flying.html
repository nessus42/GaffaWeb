		<DD> I think people have got the impression that I am carried on to a
		  plane screaming, at the moment, and have to be knocked out so that I can cope
		  with the journey. I don't like flying, but it's really not that bad, and I do
		  fly if I have to. If there is another way of travelling, I quite often prefer
		  to go that way; but if you have to fly and it's the quickest way to get
		  somewhere, then I do. (????, ?????) </DD>
