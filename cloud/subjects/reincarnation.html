		<DD> Yes. No, because I'm very happy in this particular lifetime, thank
		  you. And I think all lifetimes have their own ups and downs and I'm really
		  happy to be here. I think it's a good time. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Do you think you might have lived before, then. Had some kind of
		previous life? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I don't know, it's very possible. But it's not the sort of thing
		  you'd remember. And I just believe that soulless entities and people that work
		  on themselves will come back in some form. All that energy just can't go, it's
		  gotta go somewhere. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Have you had a feeling though that ever you might have been born
		before? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I get feeling that I've done things before, and whether it was a
		  past life or a future life or just something, I don't know. I get a lot of
		  feelings thought that when I'm doing something for the first time that it's
		  happened before. (1979, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir79_pc.html">Personal

	 <P> <B> Do you think, kate, if you were hypnotised, I mean what do you

		<DD> [<I>Laughs</I>] I'd give away a lot of secrets, that's for sure. I
		  don't know. I think that's a very, very interesting to do. And there have been
		  a few books written by people who have gone through this regression. I don't
		  know if it is very healthy actually, I personally wouldn't do it. I think it's
		  very interesting thought. And I can't say about my past lives or whatever, I
		  don't know. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Cause it's the very foundation of the buddhist religion, for
		example. They believe that the soul was never ever born. It just is, it's
		eternal, it was never born, it will never die. It will go on reliving and
		reliving until eventually it finds a resting place and ultimately finds a
		nirvana, where it doesn't have to be reborn anymore. </B></P>

		<DD> Hmm. I think that beautiful. I think that's such a beautiful...

	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Yeah, but at the same time they never swat a fly because it might
		be granny. [<I>Both laugh</I>] (1979, <CITE><A
