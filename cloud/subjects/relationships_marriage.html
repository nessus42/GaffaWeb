		<DD> Yes, I think there are. I suppose, in relationships, there's a lot
		  that can go wrong very quickly, and you have to work at them, which, I think,
		  is something a lot of people aren't aware of until they grow up a bit. These
		  things gradually reveal themselves to you, don't they? </DD>

		<DD> You're right - most of my songs are about relationships, probably
		  always have been, really. That feels to me how things are, really:
		  relationships towards other things and people, and how we actually manage to
		  make these forms of contact... (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I think men are bigger babies than women. I don't think we grow up
		so fast. </B></P>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Maybe men can avoid more situations than women in terms of facing
		  things. I guess there are things for women that are different and they tend to
		  deal with life situations rather than perhaps the business world or whatever.
		  God, this sounds so sexist... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Not at all. Women give birth, they are physically part of the
		creative process. It's as if their orgasm grows and bears fruit, whereas men
		fuck and that's it - it's a release, something we get rid of rather than
		something we gain. Then it all builds up again, and we can't handle it. I think
		women are far stronger emotionally. Men can't cope with emotions. We get
		frustrated and aggressive and destructive because we can't express ourselves,
		whereas women seem to <CITE>embody</CITE> their feelings better. Something
		positive grows from them. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I think you're right. It's very hard on all of us but, yet,
		  through the process of giving birth, I'm sure women are much stronger than men,
		  and it's incredibly hard on them that they should not be able to show their
		  emotions when actually it's okay to be weak. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> We men are confused. The trouble with the invention of the notion
		of sexism and the paranoia surrounding it is that the only way we can deal with
		it is based on a fallacy. We think that, just because women should quite
		rightly have equal rights and equal opportunities, the sexes are the same. But
		we're not - women are aliens to us, we don't understand you at all. You speak a
		different language altogether. We're different creatures entirely. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Absolutely, I'm with you 100 per cent. I couldn't agree more. I
		  think it's awful what's happening to people's sense of their own sexuality.
		  Women are made to feel awkward about expressing themselves as women in a man's
		  world, so, subconsciously, a lot of the time, they're behaving like men because
		  they don't know how strong they're supposed to be. Then again, women's lib has
		  left men in a lot of areas where they don't know how to behave in case they get
		  called sexist, a pig, or whatever. </DD>

		<DD> We are different, and we should be helping each other. Unfortunately
		  there was such a lot of shit to get through that it was a battle, but I don't
		  think it need be. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i89_mm.html">Melody

	 <P> <B> The album seems to be saying, ``if you find yourself in a tricky
		situation, follow your instincts - just behave the way if feels right and at
		least you're being true to yourself, irrespective of the outcome." </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, absolutely... And what an incredibly difficult thing to apply
		  to life. I think there are some very good things going on to help us through. I
		  must say, for me, the comedy in this country has been really educational. You
		  know, Ben Elton and The Comic Strip - all those people you can't really call
		  alternative comedians anymore because they've become mainstream. I think
		  they've really done a lot to stop it being fashionable to be humorous with
		  sexist overtones. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It used to be very hip to make fun of women. Old comedy was all
		  about treating women as a threat and, therefore, making fun of them. And I
		  think they've really changed a lot of that. They've done so much for men and
		  women because now, in most circles, among people our age, if you make a sexist
		  joke, it's really considered tasteless. I think that's a fantastic step
		  forward. And to see people like Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders out there
		  doing comedy being women as women is brilliant. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> They're just out there doing it and, the more women can be strong
		  enough to do that, the more it'll help everybody. It used to really scare me
		  the way women were portrayed in comedy, and the way they behaved: either they
		  were bitching off other women and being sexist themselves, or they were
		  allowing themselves to be used as sex objects, either positively or negatively
		  - they were either very beautiful or very stereotypically ugly. Women would
		  just be batted around from these extremes, but that hold's been broken now and,
		  as comedy's so much part of our nature in this country, so much a part of our
		  roots, to break old things like that is an incredible step. (1989, <CITE><A
