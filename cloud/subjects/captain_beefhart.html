	 <P><B> Well, here's certainly one of the all-time cult figures: Captain
		beefheart, and his magic band. Here's a man who for over a decade has been
		making music which some people have been absolutely raving about, and yet he's
		never broken through to mass acceptance. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> Yes. Again, I think he's [<I>Laughs</I>], he's such an obvious
		  person to be big here. When you look at a lot of the new wave groups and the
		  punk groups, they're really nothing compared to Beefheart. He's the original.
		  And for me he's a, a <CITE>natural</CITE> poet. I mean, he's incredible. I've
		  heard a beautiful quote of his. When he was backstage one day, um, there was
		  someone hanging around who he didn't want to be there; and he told them to get
		  out. And when the someone said ``why didn't you want me here?'' he said he's
		  had too much to think. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And if I may just quote a couple of lines from one of his songs
		  called ``Bat Chain Puller.'' It's about a Voodoo train. His poetry's
		  incredible. It says: ``A chain with yellow lights that glisten like
		  oil-beads;'' and another line: ``It whistles like a root snatched from the dry
		  earth. Sod-busting rakes with grey-dust claws announces it's coming in the
		  morning.'' [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] ...is a poet. Then listen out for the line in
		  this song, which is called ``Tropical Hot Dog Night,'' and it's ``Like two
		  flamingos in a fruit fight." </DD>

	 <P> <B> [<I>The song is played.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Captain beefheart and the magic band, and ``tropical hot dog
		night.'' kate, I think I would like to stash that one. Maybe it's the new
		year's party I'm going to tonight. </B></P>
