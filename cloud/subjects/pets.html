		<DD> Paddy says that Zoodle is a German word for snoot, and I got the
		  name from him. I don't know where the name Pyewacket came from - it just seemed
		  a good idea at the time, as they say. We actually call her Pye. [<I>Kate may or
		  may not be speaking candidly here, but for the record ``pyewacket'' is the name
		  of a very popular fictional cat, the ``familiar'' of kim novak's
		  witch-character in the 1958 film <CITE>bell, book and candle,</CITE> from the
		  play by van druten. Based on the wonderful atmosphere and subject of this
		  movie, and the really important role of the cat in the story, it seems very
		  likely that kate got the name from this film, or from the play on which it is
		  based. - ied</I>] (1979, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate3.html">KBC

		<DD> I used to have two cats. Zoodle and Pyewackit, but I'm afraid that
		  Zoodle died earlier this year. I was very upset, but she was eleven and had a
		  good life. She was a beautiful cat. Pyewackit is absolutely fine, although she
		  missed Zoodle at first. A few months ago we adopted a stray, feeding her and
		  letting her live in the garage, and she had three kittens. We now have the 3
		  kittens. They are called Rocket, Sparky and Torchy. And although Pye didn't
		  like them all at first, they all get on really well now, and we find them
		  cuddled up on a chair together when we get in. They're such good company for
		  her, and they all have such different personalities. It's so entertaining just
		  sitting watching them play. It's bringing out the kitten in Pye: I've noticed
		  her springing across the floor and leaping onto ledges that are far too small
		  for her. She does things she hasn't tried for years and seems to be enjoying it
		  all. I guess we're all young at heart, but sometimes it takes something to
		  rediscover it! (1987, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate23.html">KBC
