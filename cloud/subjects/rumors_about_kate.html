		<DD> No, it isn't, and I've never even heard of it. You mustn't believe
		  everything (or anything?) you read in the papers. Quite a lot of articles
		  irritate me because of their inaccuracy. It would be so easy for a journalist
		  to send me the copy of what they've written so I could check up on the facts -
		  not of their opinion, which is their own business - but on the facts; and so
		  far, not one has done so. Nearly every interview is distorted in some way.
		  That's one of the reasons for starting this club, so that I can give you the
		  genuine facts that you want to know. (1979, <CITE><A
