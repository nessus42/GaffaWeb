	 <P> <B> Kate bush can inspire strange reactions in people I mentioned our
		coming interview to one jeffrey lee pierce of this parish and he exploded into
		a stream of likely questions. Thought I'd try ``what's your favourite

		<DD> [<I>Kate is tickled:</I>] That's fantastic! What an incredible
		  question! She gurgles, before admitting that her research is too limited in
		  that field for a proper answer. But she does let on that she likes badgers,
		  rabbits and horses when they've got their ``clothes'' on, and can't resist the
		  sight of an ostrich running at 90 miles per hour. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Bush doesn't see it that way. True, though, she did want to get out
		  of the city. I find it fascinating how I've heard people say that they get a
		  tremendous amount of inspiration from the cities and from this kind of
		  unnatural situation. I get much more inspiration from being outside in nature.

		<DD> I think nature is very important to me as an inspiration. It's very
		  important for me to be able to just look at intense pieces of landscape and
		  throughout history people have always gained inspiration from the sea, from
		  mountains, from the sky. It's what we sort of strive for really, isn't it? You
		  know, nature is perfect. God made the world in absolute perfection and anything
		  that a human being does can never really be perfect. (1989, <CITE><A
