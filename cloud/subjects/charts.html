		<DD> They keep telling me the chart numbers, and I just kinda say, ``Oh,
		  wow!'' ([<I>she sweeps her arms</I>]).... It's not like it's really happening.
		  I've always been on the outside, watching albums I like go up the charts, and
		  feeling pleased that they are doing well, but it's hard to relate to the fact
		  that it's now happening to me... (1978, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, it does always amaze me how songs get in the charts that are -
		  I won't say <CITE>rubbish,</CITE> because they're not - but the sort of songs
		  that so many people could write. (1980, Oct 10, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, I suppose I do keep an eye on the charts to a certain extent,
		  but I don't know the chart positions until the day you hear them on the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A>. I usually hear via a telephone call
		  from the record company, and they don't know them until that morning. (1983,
