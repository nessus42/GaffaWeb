		<DD> Well normally I have a routine that I work out, like I sort of form
		  a character, if you like, for that particular song. And then we always get
		  together, like a week before we film, and just and chat. And he comes up with
		  ideas and I do. And we just work together and he's just so inspiring, he's
		  great. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Keef: I started in the business as a photographer and sleeve
		designer. About 1968 I started, I used to photo and design album sleeve covers
		and I did that for seven or eight years. I got a bit fed up doing that because
		I'd done basically over a thousand by then and I was just basically a little
		bored with it. And [<I>I</I>] really thought that the up and coming thing was
		<A HREF="../subjects/film.html">film</A> and specifically video tape for the
		music business. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Keef: One of my early successes and one I'm quite proud of was one
		I did for kate bush which I'll show you a little of. This was ``wuthering
		heights'' [<I>The video is played</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Keef: The record company loved that one and so did the broadcast
		companies that the record company gave it to. So, suddenly, really from that
		point onward I was asked to do more complex and more exciting type of tapes.
		And I think that particular tape illustrated that song very well and people, I
		think, became aware that you could make the visuals flow with the music and
		illustrate the song in a more pictorial way then had been done before. Before
		it had been fairly straight forward. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Keef: Well I started making video promotional films two years and
		up till now I think we're nearing our three-hundredth production. I do seem to
		work very hard at the moment, I've been doing two or three a week. The problem
		is, as you've probably gathered, is keeping the ideas coming. But in this
		particular aspect I'm very lucky because basically I get the ideas from the
		music itself and from the artists and from their performance. The lyrics
		obviously help, but I tend not to be to literal on that, I try and just
		basically get the flavor right. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Keef: At the moment there isn't a direct market for these [ videos]
		selling to the public, in this country. I mean, my whole production company is
		geared up to providing a service to the record companies to do what we do, make
		promotional film. In america now, they've started marketing the video disk. And
		the first few video disks [<I>Players</I>] that came off the production lines
		in january were immediately snapped up, as were all the actual disks
		themselves. So I think there's... In the future there's going to be a huge
		market for music-video disks, where, instead of buying an ordinary album, you
		buy your video disk, which gives you better hi-fi. So you've got better hi-fi
		stereo sound, with the option of visuals, if you want them. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Kate: I think they have the most incredible potential, and I think
		people will buy them, yes. The only thing that I wonder about is boredom,
		because I think when you play a record again and again, if the visuals aren't
		abstract enough or stunning enough, they could become very tedious. But then
		again, people can always switch them off. But I think it will be very exciting,
		I think a lot of revolutionary things will come up. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Keef: I tend to shoot video tape rather then film, for a number of
		reasons. The `` wuthering heights'' clip that you saw, we set it up on a monday
		morning, we shot it in the afternoon, we edited all night, and it was ready for
		top of the pops the next morning. Well, if you'd done that on film, I think it
		would've taken about six months of opticals in the lab to get to that stage. On
		video tape we can act very fast, the record companies like that because if a
		record breaks in the charts they phone me up and say, ``keef, we're sending a
		motorcycle over with this record, can you do it tomorrow?'' if I'm free, I say
		yes. I listen to the music overnight, we set the production up overnight, we do
		it, we shoot it, we edit it. In twenty-four hours you can have a complete
		finished production. </B></P>
