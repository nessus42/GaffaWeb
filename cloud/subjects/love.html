		<DD> Love is a wonderful, powerful thing. In many ways nearly every song
		  I've ever written is a love song. It's very important to try and learn to love
		  people as much as you can. But we all get so scared. It's only when people are
		  at points in their lives when they get such shocks that they take it as it
		  really should be. The rest of us just seem to piss about. (1989, <CITE><A
