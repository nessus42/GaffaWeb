		<DD> I've always had an attitude about managers. Unless they're really
		  needed they just confuse matters. They obviously have their own impressions of
		  a direction and an image that is theirs, and surely it should come from within
		  the actual structure rather than from outside. I often think that generally
		  they're more of a hindrance than a help. (1978, July, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think probably one of the most amazing things about the music
		  scene today is the fact that music is purely one aspect of it. It is in fact a
		  very large commercial business. This is why it is so hard for new unknown
		  people to get into to - because it's a money-making business. A lot of
		  companies are into creating formulas that will actually make the money for them
		  and it's hard for people who have got something new to get through. But then
		  again, there are the people in the companies who are aware of this and I think
		  that that's where the magic lies because if you get through to them then you're
		  all right. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im78_tki.html">Self

	 <P> <B> With the help of a music industry lawyer, she set up Kate Bush
		publishing and Novercia, a management company with herself as md and her

		could trust, she says, then breaks off. I'm sorry, I feel quite worried about
		mentioning the companies' names. But they're on the album sleeves. They are,
		aren't they? You're absolutely right. It's my paranoia again! There have been
		things in the past... Oh, I can't remember. When you're doing interviews you
		have to be almost like a security guard sometimes. Anyway, for me, one of the
		most important things to come out of managing myself is the fact that I could

	 <P> <B> What is your opinion on the commercialization of art? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think the purpose of a record company is to sell as many records
		  as they can, and that is their total main concern. If something is successful,
		  they are happy. If something is artistically good, but is not successful, then
		  they can't really be prepared to follow that through. Their business is not art
		  - it's money and selling records to make money. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think that's part of the reason why the business is so hard,
		  because you're talking about two completely different forces having to be
		  integrated. Artistic people, a lot of the time, don't have a good business
		  sense, and a lot of the time it's totally against everything they feel - it's
		  about money, commercialization, exploitation. It's not anything to do with a
		  creative spirit, which deals in sensitivity and observation of people,
		  emotions. They're two completely different forces. And I think to survive in
		  this business, you have to be realistic, and if music is what matters to you,
		  there's a certain amount of business that you have to be involved in in order
		  to be able to keep making music. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> So, I think for me, the way I cope with it, is to try and keep a
		  realistic balance between the things I like and don't like doing. I have to do
		  things I don't like in order to make sure my work will survive. </DD>

	 <P> <B> John carter bush: Yes, well it's a sorta coordinating process,
		really. The company was formed when it looked as though she was going to become
		popular and there's the administration of that basically. We use a solicitor
		and accountant, alot of people in advisory capacities, so there's liaison
		between them as well. And the whole thing is really to just structure it so
		that the final decision on anything becomes kate's, which tends to be unusual
		in the rock music. Especially when sorta somebody has suddenly become popular,
		they usually then find that they got a lot of hassles with their record
		companies and so on, which weren't thought of, you know, before they become
		popular. But it's been avoided in kate's case. (1980, <CITE><A
