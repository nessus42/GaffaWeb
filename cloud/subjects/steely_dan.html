		<DD> It's a brilliant song, they're wonderful musicians. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Ok let's have a listen to them, steely dan and ``peg.'' [<I>The

	 <P> <B> [<I>Part of this record is played. Then kate comes back on,

		<DD> Hi, everybody! This is Radio Fun, and I'm here with Paul Dictionary

	 <P> <B> [<I>Laughing</I>] and--and we have just heard steely dan from their
		<CITE>gaucho</CITE> lp, and ``babylon sisters.'' now, kate, this brings us
		right up to date, 'cause this is an album that's out right at the moment. And
		this is a, a funky little track by these two chaps, becker and fagin. And
		they're monstrous stars in america - not so here. </B></P>

		<DD> No, that's again why I played them. I think they're very
		  underestimated. They're the most incredible musicians. This is it. They are
		  here - a musician's band. I mean, all the musicians in this country just rave
		  about them technically, and as songwriters. But you know, they're not really
		  played on the radio, but they're just incredible - really good jazz [<I>???
		  Indecipherable</I>]. (1980, <CITE><A
