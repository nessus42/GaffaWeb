		visited Abbey Road when she was 15, to attend a
		<A HREF="../subjects/pink_floyd.html">Pink Floyd</A> session for their
		<CITE>Wish You Were Here</CITE> album. I was absolutely staggered and I really
		thought I would never be able to record in a place like Abbey Road, she said,
		but she eventually returned in 1979 for the recording of Never for Ever. Being
		on your own in studio 2 is a fascinating experience, she said in Brian
		Southall's book <CITE>Abbey Road.</CITE> I felt tremendous vibes in there, both
		positive and negative. You know it's built on key lines [<I>Invisible force
		fields such as those found at stonehenge</I>] which means there are very
		powerful forces at work. I even thought of coming in in the evenings just to
		write but it would have been an enormously expensive way of writing. (????, for
		the love of kate, from the book abbey road) </B></P>
