		recording sessions [<I>For The Dreaming</I>] were digitally mixed -- a pop
		practice that's increasingly common these days. Interestingly, though, shortly
		after the dreaming was in the can, Kate was approached by the tech team from
		the pro-analogue, anti-digital Linn products. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> They'd heard of Kate's production interests, and decided the time
		was ripe to demonstrate to an influential industry superstar just how superior
		properly handled analogue recording could be. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> And the word that filtered through to us from Linn -- who operate
		their own super-analogue recording label -- was that the lovely little lady was
		mighty impressed by the analogue-vs-digital dem they had laid on for her. So we
		thought we'd go straight to the horse's mouth and find out whether that had
		indeed been the case. It was -- sort of! </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>

		<DD> I wouldn't say that I was necessarily impressed by their
		  demonstration. But yes, I feel that there's an awful lot in analogue

		<DD> We had a lot of problems working with digital for `The Dreaming'
		  which was digitally mixed. Editing was the main one -- it was so
		  time-consuming. </DD>

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Some things obviously were easier working digitally -- otherwise we
		  wouldn't have used it. But the vast majority I reckon would have been easier on
		  tape. Particularly as I was working with people who'd worked with tape all
		  their life. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> In the end we brought in a guy who was familiar with digital
		  equipment from classical recordings he'd worked on. And it didn't take very
		  long after that. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> But the problems rather put me off digital. We all felt a kind of
		  alienation from the process of creation using it. There's something reassuring
		  about a tape that you can see and touch. You've more trust in it somehow. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> There was a feeling of uneasiness about using digital that stemmed
		  from the fact that we felt it wasn't as easy to use in many respects as tape
		  is. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Kate is firmly convinced that there's plenty of life left in
		analogue <A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">recording</A> yet, despite the
		pro-digital brigade who reckon its days are already numbered. For one thing,
		there's an awful lot of really good analogue recording equipment around. And
		many studios I know of have sounded out digital gear, and opted to stay with
		analogue. Certainly it's the way I personally reckon I'll be recording in the
		future. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> We talked more about her production of The Dreaming. the fact that
		I was handling that side of things automatically caused me a great deal of
		concern because I was responsible then for the complete finished product.

		<DD> Before we decided to work with digital, we did a comparison test
		  between analogue and digital, and all of us involved in the making of the album
		  just felt that we couldn't really detect any difference except for a slight
		  crystallised sound off of the digital. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We did a lot of comparisons and we felt that, for the kind of music
		  that was happening, that was a nice sound quality to have. Quite honestly, if
		  it hadn't been for that subtle difference we'd have stuck with analogue. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> We'd certainly have stuck with it if we'd known the practical
		  problems we'd encounter using digital. However, by the time we did encounter
		  them, we were too far advanced with it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I'm not sorry we tried digital. But in the future I'd certainly
		  prefer to work with analogue. (1983, <CITE><A
