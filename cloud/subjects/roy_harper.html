	 <P><B> Now we'll be playing some of your favourite popular songs. Let's
		begin straight away with roy harper's ``another day." </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>The recording is heard. Kate had already recorded at least two
		versions of this song as a duet with peter gabriel by this time. The first
		version was recorded for kate's own bbc television special, which aired in
		december of 1979; The second was undertaken several months later in the studios
		with the hope of a single release. A b-side co-written by kate and gabriel was
		even recorded to this end, but the project was unfortunately abandoned. Kate
		also contributed vocals on a song from roy harper's 1980 album <CITE>the
		unknown soldier.</CITE> - ied</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Roy harper, and a song called <CITE>another day.</CITE> kate, if I
		were asked to choose a quintessentially english track, I would choose a roy
		harper one: ``when an old cricketer leaves the crease.'' and I'm wondering if
		you consider him a typically english artist. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I think that's a very good point. I think he is a very English
		  <CITE>poet.</CITE> I mean, I think Roy is a poet, I really do. And that one
		  particular song is classic. It's funny you should mention ``Cricketer Leaves
		  the Crease,'' because for me that's the other all-time classic, and it was a
		  matter of choosing between the two, for me. This track is incredible. In fact,
		  I asked Roy what he wrote the song about, and he said the whole thing is true.
		  It's a completely true story about a lady he'd met, and who he really loved,
		  and he was after her. And she kept putting her nose in the air and running away
		  from him. Then he met her a few years later, and suddenly realised that she was
		  chasing him, and he saw the irony of the situation, and wrote this song about
		  the rooms that they'd been in together. It's a very personal song, and I think
		  that's why it works so strongly. It's a very emotional, intimate song. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> If I may ask a crass question after such an intimate song: An
		artist like yourself has enjoyed success in a commercial sense quite early in
		her career. How do you relate to an artist like roy, who has the respect of his
		peers but who has never really broken through commercially? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think it's tragic, I really do. One of the main reasons that I've
		  chosen these tracks, and the ones from last night, is that I'm choosing people
		  - deliberately - not like Bowie, Pink Floyd, who are people I love very much.
		  All the big, famous artists, I really love a lot of them. I deliberately chose
		  people who I think are very underestimated, who aren't really recognised as the
		  great talent that they are. And for me, Roy is one of the greatest English
		  songwriters we've had, and people just don't realise it. And I really think
		  that when they do we're going to have another top songwriter up there. He's
		  brilliant. (1980, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">BBC</A></CITE>) </DD>

	 <P> <B> No, kate, I haven't heard the [<I>New roy harper</I>] album. You
		should. Adrian boot took it, took the sleeve photograph. Actually says kate
		sweetly, I didn't like the sleeve. Adrian looks hurt. The photograph was great,
		I just didn't like the sleeve she reassures him. (1980, oct 10, <CITE><A
