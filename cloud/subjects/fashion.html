		<DD> When I was at school, I thought it was a bit dull to buy the same
		  clothes as all my friends. KATE SMILES. I think fashion is more fun if you can
		  find something different to wear. I've always liked old clothes and I used to
		  go rummaging through second-hand shops looking for bargains. Jumble sales were
		  always good too, and my money went a lot further than it would have done in the
		  local boutiques. </DD>

		<DD> I still like old clothes and the material they're made in... all
		  those velvets and satins. But the trouble is, if the owners of a second-hand
		  shop recognize me, the prices go up. So, I get one of my friends to buy the
		  things I want. That way I can still get a bargain! (1978, Kate the (Fashion)
		  Plate!) </DD>

		<DD> No. I was just a few years too young. In some ways, my attitudes
		  could be associated with the time. I mean, I was growing up in the '60s...

	 <P> <B> Were you ever into teenage (fashion) cults, like a skinhead

		<DD> No. I don't think I ever felt I could be convincing enough in any of
		  the roles. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">NME</A></CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> I make an effort to produce beautiful, tasteful videos and album
		  covers, but I'm not into dressing up, and I'm not interested in clothes. KATE
		  MOTIONS TO HER OUTFIT TO PROVE THE POINT. SHE'S WEARING WHAT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF
		  BOYFRIEND DEL PALMER'S JACKETS, OLD BLUE SHIRT, OVERSIZED BLACK TIE, JEANS AND
		  BOOTS, ALL SET OFF BY MANE OF PRE-RAPHAELITE HAIR. </DD>

		<DD> I'm not a trendy city person at all, in fact I've become a country
		  type since I left London. The stimulus of the countryside is fantastic. I sit
		  at my piano and watch skies moving and trees blowing and that's far more
		  exciting than buildings and roads and millions of people. </DD>

		<DD> Communing with nature is no bad thing. I use it as an escape, but
		  that doesn't mean I hug trees at three o'clock in the morning. KATE SMILES AT
		  THE THOUGHT AND GAZES OUT THE STUDIO WINDOW WHERE ELTHAM'S SEDATE SUBURBAN CALM
		  IS ONLY BROKEN BY THE GENTLE NOISE OF NEIGHBOURS MOWING SUBSTANTIAL LAWNS.
