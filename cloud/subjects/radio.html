		<DD> Disappointing. But it just shows how reliant you are on the people
		  at the radio stations liking the singles, to get the airplay. (1984, <CITE><A

		<DD> I've never even seen a Madonna video and I don't like pop music
		  much. Radio One infuriates me. I'd rather listen to the silly programmes on
		  Radio Four, or to classical music like Delius, Bach and Satie. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> I don't spend much time listening to radio, and when I do it tends
		  to be Radio 4. I guess we spend so much time listening to music in a very
		  sensitised way, in recreational terms, that you need relief for the ears. I
		  tend to listen to more when I just finish an album, rather than during, which
		  is stupid. </DD>

		<DD> A good example of this is that when I finished the last album, I
		  heard this Bulgarian music. I thought ``Shit, I wish I'd have heard this while
		  I was working on the album.'' I think it was good in one way because I had a
		  lot of time to think about the possibility of doing something with them. The
		  thing that would worry me a bit is that if you like something you are
		  influenced by it, and I'd probably try and connect to other people's music of
		  that time. It takes me such a long time to make an album that it would be
		  drastically out of date. (1989, <CITE><A
