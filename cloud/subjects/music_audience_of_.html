		<DD> I think also one of the most amazing things about music, especially
		  for the last twenty or thirty years, is the fact that we've been able to
		  preserve it on record. So it's no longer someone jamming in a little club in
		  the thirties in a little smoky place. It's an eternal process. you can listen
		  to people that have died maybe twenty years ago. You can see them on the
		  television. You can see them moving and young. They are no longer there. You've
		  captured that moment, purely through mechanical things, which is really quite
		  ironic because music is such a pure emotional thing to be captured on such a
		  mechanical modern contraption. but it's the only way we can do it. (1978, Self

		<DD> Oh, yes, it's very much a therapeutic thing, not only for me. That's
		  a really good word. It really is like a therapy. The message I would like
		  people to receive is that if they hear it and accept it, that's fantastic.

		<DD> If they let it into their ears that is all I can ask for and if they

		  something very special. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Well, are people clued in enough to pick up on all these sort of

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> You know, I think that the majority of the people really do. Yes, I
		  really think they do. Because, if they bother to listen, then after about three
		  or four times they start putting the words or the ideas together. And I mean
		  the one that really amazed me, we did a video of `` Breathing'' and the idea
		  was being in this huge inflatable; and I was at this conference somewhere and
		  there were all these women in their forties and fifties, real Monty Python sort
		  of women, and they all came up and said [<I>Kate affects a strong london
		  accent, which requires merely an exaggeration of her normal accent</I>]: ``Oh,
		  we <CITE>loved</CITE> your video!'' And then one of them says: ``But listen,
		  you must tell me, I had this, you know, this argument with my daughter; you
		  <CITE>were</CITE> meant to be in a womb, weren't you? I mean, <CITE>that</CITE>

	 <P> <B> You mean she got it, it was true? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, she got it! And she said: ``There you are, didn't I tell you
		  it was a womb.'' And I thought yeah, that's fantastic! I mean, I wouldn't have
		  even expected her to sit and watch it... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But kate, I'd like to pick an argument with you. I must confess, I
		find it difficult to <CITE>watch</CITE> your performances, I think for a few
		reasons. It seems to me so much of your music flows right out from essence, so
		to speak, whereas all the acting, all the theatrics, by their very nature
		they're something artificial and contrived. Also, because there's often a more
		or less flagrant sexual element to your performance, the viewer is
		automatically thrust into the position of being a voyeur, and being a voyeur is
		not necessarily everyone's cup of tea. You know what I mean? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Wow, yeah, that's h-e-a-v-y. But I have only ever consciously
		  projected the sexual element in a couple of characters, and if that's present
		  for you in every performance, well, that is worrying for me, as it's not
		  intentional and I'm not aware of it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, be that as it may, I know just how seriously you've taken the
		art of performance, how you studied under lindsay kemp and all that. And I'm
		also aware how much effort and skill it takes; To act like that is not
		something just anybody could get up and do. Now I'm not sure to what extent my
		own perception is idiosyncratic, I mean to say, I do know people who
		<CITE>love</CITE> your performances. But, myself, I wonder - and here's where
		I'm trying to pick the argument - if all these theatrics might not detract from
		your potential for being taken seriously as a musician, especially in america.
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's a big problem. Because I don't think I've been completely happy
		  with any visual performance that I've done except for `` Army Dreamers'' and
		  perhaps `` Running Up That Hill.'' But they were videos which took a lot of
		  time and work and control. Except for one I did recently of `` Running Up That
		  Hill'' for a British TV show, where I look a bit like Richard III, there are no
		  TV performances I've done where I think I've ever even got close to pulling it
		  off. So, apart from those few things, but also the videos of `` Wuthering
		  Heights'' and bits of `` Breathing,'' I don't think I've accomplished what I
		  really wanted visually. Usually the problems are lack of time or money. We
		  always have a lot of challenging ideas but then end up compromising somewhere
		  or other in order to meet deadlines or budgets. But occasionally things
		  <CITE>do</CITE> come together well. If anything, though, I think my
		  performances help audiences understand the music better, especially the lyrical
		  aspect, and the tour of Europe definitely caused a change in attitude both
		  among the public and the media. Many people began to take me seriously as a
		  musician for the first time. The audiences could see me there singing and
		  dancing, leading the band and in control of the whole act. And that's quite
		  different from the kind of controlled, far-away image that one gets through the
		  media... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But in these performances, kate - and really they are what I wanted
		to talk about, not your videos - there are only a couple of songs which you
		yourself perform <CITE>on the piano,</CITE> usually one or two of the more
		gentle and intimate ones like `` the man with the child in his eyes.'' yet
		someone like me, at any rate, would like to see you as a performer, as a
		serious musician, singing at the piano and leading the band, which I know you
		could do very well if you wanted to. I told you earlier how the first time I
		saw kate bush was early on, around 1978, when you did two or three numbers in
		that manner on a tv show, and it was then that I recognized in an instant, that
		this young kid was an exceptional artist who had to be taken very seriously, I
		mean <CITE>musically.</CITE> am I right in thinking that one of the reasons
		you've never toured in the states is because you suppose you need this big show
		with all the people involved and all the expensive props? Do you not feel - and
		I suppose this is really what my argument comes down to - that you could come
		to america just with your band and play more or less straightforwardly?
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I'd be able to feel that I had any effort or sense of challenge left
		  in me. I don't really feel that happy doing something, in a way, unless I've
		  really pushed myself to the limit. And, you know, it's like when we do videos
		  and things, I don't really feel right unless we're all filthy and exhausted by
		  the end of the day. Otherwise it doesn't feel like you've put enough effort
		  into it. When you hear an album you listen to the music; but when you go and
		  see a show, you're going there to <CITE>see</CITE> that person or the band come
		  alive, and hopefully give you everything that they've got, so that you can
		  really have a good evening and enjoy the music within the concept of a
		  <CITE>show.</CITE> And I think, if I was just going to stand up there, then,
		  you know, what are the audience getting apart from seeing me just standing
		  there that they can't get on an album? On the albums, they get much better
		  arrangements, much better vocals which are in tune, all that sort of thing...

		  what it's about, but for example, some of the stuff on <CITE>The Ninth
		  Wave</CITE> are so obscure lyrically, and yet people seem to know exactly what
		  I'm trying to say. That's a great feeling. It stops me worrying about that

		<DD> I'm not sure you can separate the two, because once a word is sung,

		  just now is ``The Boy in the Bubble'' by Paul Simon. The chorus of that is
		  totally brilliant, particularly the line, ``The way we look to the distant
		  constellation that is dying in the corner of the sky.'' It's poetry, but the
		  impact is the combination of the words with the music, and the way he sings it
		  - it's <CITE>so</CITE> good. But quite often I mishear lyrics, and prefer my
		  version to the real words when I find them out. I know a lot of people who have
		  the same experience, and again we're back to what music means to the listener,
		  or how they hear it. Music is a very special thing. (1987, <CITE><A
