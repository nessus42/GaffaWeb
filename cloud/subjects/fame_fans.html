		<DD> I know a lot of people enjoy it, they really like giving autographs
		  and everything and I think that is important. If anyone asks you for an
		  autograph you must give it to them. I think of myself when I was a kid and saw

		  up and say ``hello'' and I'd be so shy. I'd nearly die and I couldn't get the

		<DD> When I was younger I used to dream about being famous, the way
		  everybody does - but even now I'm not sure I can cope with it. Being so
		  successful and so famous so quickly really did freak me out. It was an
		  incredible break for me. All I really wanted to do was to get the music out and
		  make it better all the time. I think if you go into the music business simply
		  because you want to be famous, you have to be prepared for it to fall around
		  your feet. Fame is really a very strange situation to be in. Anyone who thinks
		  it's what they want should think again! </DD>

		<DD> Well, it certainly help me a lot in some ways. For example, I can
		  ring someone up and say, ``Hello, this is Kate Bush,'' and they react in a
		  different way then they used to - though they don't always believe me! I don't
		  think it's necessary for me to use my name unless I really need something -
		  otherwise, it's just silly and arrogant. But I'm very pleased that people like
		  my music and want to buy it, because that means I can go on writing songs and

		<DD> Ooh, is that deep! I think you're absolutely right. I loved touring,

		  was going from the road straight into recording another album, but I did reach
		  a point a couple of years after where I felt incredibly exposed. I felt really

		<DD> I think this is a problem for any famous person, particularly for

		  have to be very, very strong. It doesn't surprise me at all that people go mad
		  or become incredibly addicted to things. Because it's the psychological
		  pressure of what happens to you when you're famous. Everyone sees the glamour,
		  the fact that you have fame, lots of <A
		  HREF="../subjects/money.html">money</A>, riches - it's all incredibly
