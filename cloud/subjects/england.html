		<DD> My patriotic number! Yes, I think there probably <CITE>was,</CITE>
		  moreso than there is now. The Tennyson thing is a bit misleading because rather
		  than that inspiring the b-side, I needed a title for all the pieces and there
		  wasn't any line in the songs that really was right. It needed a title that said
		  something, so I was looking through some <A

		  that I though was perfect, so that was it. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> It makes me very happy. And I think especially because it's my home

		  being reflected amongst my friends and where I live, it's really special.
