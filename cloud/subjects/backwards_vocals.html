	 <P><B> What is really strange about the singing at the end of `` leave it
		open,'' is that if you play it backwards, it also sounds like intelligible
		singing. In fact, it sounds to me like, ``and they said they wouldn't let me
		in", which is wonderful because then it has the opposite meaning backwards as
		it does forwards. [<I>Except that it does <CITE>not</CITE> sound like ``and
		they said they wouldn't let me in'' when played backwards. -ied</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> There is also something like this on hounds of love, in the song ``
		watching you without me,'' there is one part where you sing what to me sounds
		like ``really see'' repeated several times. And if you play this backwards, it
		sounds exactly the same. Still like ``really see", though I'm not sure it's
		``really see'' - it just sounds like that to me. But whatever it sounds like,
		it sounds exactly the same backwards. [<I>This is false. The phrase, when
		played backwards, quite clearly says, ``we see you here.'' -ied</I>] well, the
		question is, I'd be really interested in knowing how you did this sort of
		manipulation. </B></P>

		<DD> Well, that's something I've been experimenting with for a while, and
		  would like to continue experimenting with. It's just a way of using backwards
		  ideas, but actually saying something cohesively. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But how do you actually get a message or singing which sounds like
		something both forwards and backwards. And what are the technical issues
		involved. I mean, it seems like it would be really hard to do. </B></P>

		<DD> It is. It's very difficult- it takes a lot of time and an awful lot
		  of patience. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Kate is saved by the bell, as her brother is at the door, and my
		half hour is up. I talked to both of kate's brothers some time later, however,
		and neither had any qualms about giving away the secret of the two-way
		messages. It involves listening to singing played backwards on a tape deck,
		learning to sing the backwards sounds, and then
		<A HREF="../subjects/recording.html">recording</A> that strange singing
		backwards. [<I>This is apparently a reference to the explanation given by paddy
		and john to the entire audience of the 1985 kate bush convention in romford,
		england. In fact, however, their description of the process does nothing to
		explain the apparent presence of two simultaneous messages, only the basic
		method of creating the first, ``backwards'' message.</I>] (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> On the album [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] I'd love to hear what you did.
		It sounds like [<I>??? Inaudible</I>]. Is that right? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy:. [<I>??? Inaudible</I>] they're singing a phrase. You take a
		phrase and you record it. Then you play that backwards so it comes [<I>Sings
		backwards. Laughter</I>]. Then you learn how to sing that, like you learn how
		to [<I>Sings backwards. Lots of laughter and applause</I>] then when you record
		that... Then when you play that back the other way [<I>Talks like reversed
		tape</I>] it all comes out in a very strange way. Like you've heard this
		technique used before, and it's something that we all [<I>??? Inaudible.
