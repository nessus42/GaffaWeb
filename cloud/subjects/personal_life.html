		<DD> Eerie experience. Oo, I don't know, a lot of things happen.
		  Sometimes in the recording studio, when you're out there alone, with all the
		  lights dim, you sorta feel very strange things sometimes. That can be quite
		  eerie. You sometimes feel that maybe there's someone in the room with you, that
		  sorta thing. But I haven't really had anything extremely eerie or horrible
		  happen to me. I've had a really quite nice life, actually. I couldn't think of
		  anything at the moment, I wish I could for you. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Um, I don't think I'm psychic, but I think I have a slight advantage
		  being a female to start with, because I think females are, I'm not saying
		  they're more sensitive, but they just seem to be more open to certain areas
		  like that. And I do get very strong feeling sometimes that do turn out to be
		  true, just feelings about friends, relatives, that sorta thing. But I think

		<DD> <IMG SRC="../xbm/new.gif" ALT="*" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16">People have
		  been so good to me. I think there are lucky people in the world, just as there
		  are unlucky ones. So far, at least, I have always been on the right side. I
		  would never say that everything I've ever done has been right, but I've always
		  survived. People are what they've done; you can never go back and change the
		  decisions you've made. I don't believe in regrets, anyway. You have to take the
		  responsibility for what you do and realize that there will always be
		  consequences, that everything that happens to you in life is your own fault.

		<DD> I think I'm pretty stable, though. I have people around me who are
		  very good to be with. It's important to realize that your career can never be
		  your whole life. This is just a phase; I don't want to feel I'd have nothing
		  left if my records suddenly stopped selling. I hope they won't - but if they
		  did, I'd still be able to write songs and <A

		  I like doing. </DD>

		<DD> I do try desperately to hang on to ordinary life, just to keep in

		<DD> Life seems pretty futile sometimes. The way people behave is so
		  ridiculous. It's as if the world is really a big football match and we aren't
		  looking after the grounds. Sometimes I feel that show business is a trivial
		  profession to be in, but in fact it's not, because I happen to believe that
		  getting music to people is one of the most honorable things you can do. It's
		  wonderful to reach people, to lift them up and make them happy with your music.
		  Music can save lives, because people are just rhythm units. </DD>

		<DD> I worry, too, in case I run out of ideas. You can dry up, you know.
		  When I listen to my old stuff it never sounds as good as I want it to. I don't
		  think artists ever feel happy or comfortable about what they've done. (1982,

		<DD> Creative people are often flawed personalities. If they weren't - if
		  they were the strong, God-like figures the media makes them out to be - they
		  wouldn't need to be creative! Many musicians have communication problems in
		  real life, but they find they can communicate perfectly through their music.
		  Others have real vices - they get into alcohol or drugs - and I think that says
		  so much about the vulnerability of creative people. Billie Holliday was one of
		  my all- time favorite singers. There's so much raw emotion and pain in her
		  voice, it haunts me. (1982, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Nineteen</A></CITE>)

		<DD> I can't possibly project myself into the future - I don't see how
		  anyone can! I recently bought a house in Kent, that's one thing, so that I have
		  somewhere nice to go. But, apart from that, I really can't say. I need to be
		  alone sometimes to gather myself together, but I need to have people around,
		  too. It's all right being alone; you can arrange things just the way you want
		  them. But the thing about other people is that they don't always fit in with
		  what you want, so meeting and mixing with people is what life is all about.

		<DD> Anyone who writes needs contact with people to find out how they
