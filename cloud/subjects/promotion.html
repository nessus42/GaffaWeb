	 <P><B> Kate insists that she isn't exploiting her sexuality: That's a very
		obvious <A HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A>. I suppose the poster is
		reasonably sexy just 'cause you can see my tits, but I think the vibe from the
		face is there. The main thing about a picture is that it should create a vibe.
		Often you get pictures of females showing their legs with a very plastic face.
		I think that poster projects a mood. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> But what about the album cover in which you're showing your legs
		with a vengeance? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> The picture is creating a feeling of flying and movement. If you're
		  up in the sky you're gonna be free. It would look a bit weird if I had a dirty
		  great black serge coat on. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Again, one of the hand out-pics is particularly sexy - with kate
		drawing attention to her crotch. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> That came from a seven hour photo session where the photographer and
		  I was trying to produce a vibe. It had to be a relevant one. A nice, simple,
		  obvious one for me is that fact that I do dance, so we got a load of leotards
		  and just did that, but still trying to create a vibe. Not necessarily a sexy
		  one - although I will agree with you that it is - but from now on we're taking
		  a more subtle approach. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> So there'll be no more suggestive shots? </B></P>

		<DD> I don't know. It's hard to say. I don't really think it's important.
		  I think I'm going to have trouble because people tend to put the sexuality
		  first. I hope they don't. That's what I'm trying to fight. </DD>

		<DD> Well, I'm doing general promotion. And I do feel that there's
		  something about records, because it's music it has its own life. And there are
		  people that are totally unknown and the single goes out, well it happened with
		  me I was unknown, `` Wuthering Heights'' went out, I didn't really do any
		  promotion until it was up there. Songs have their own life and I think they do
		  whatever they want. You can have all the forces you want against a song going

	 <P> <B> As somebody who is involved in making records, you are also
		involved in creating a product and to an extent, kate bush becomes a commodity.
		How do you feel about that? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, that is something that does scare me. If you want to make
		  records, <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html">videos</A>, you have got to have
		  money, and to get that money you have to have albums that are relatively
		  successful. You have to promote them. And that's where I feel the commodity
		  side comes in, because as soon as the personality seeps into it rather than the
		  work, you're making that person vulnerable to the public. I don't like that.
		  I'd much rather work on albums, videos, and explore films and that, without
		  having to promote them. I find it difficult, I feel false. It's very against
		  what I feel is right. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think sometimes the work speaks much better than the person does.
		  I certainly feel mine does. Because I can spend a lot of time trying to say
		  something, and I don't feel that I am good enough at what I am doing
		  <CITE>now</CITE> to really warrant doing it, other than for selling my work.
		  And I think sometimes it can go against the work: the personality can almost
		  taint it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Can you give an example of that? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Preconceptions can cause problems, and I think, say some of the
		  press I got a while ago was very <CITE>flippant.</CITE> And I felt that, to a
		  certain extent, did work against what I was trying to do. It created an
		  impression of me that wasn't really what I was, and perhaps gave that
		  impression to people who could have seen me in a different way. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> You can't escape the fact that this is the century of mass
		communication, and the whole way in which the media work is through creating
		resonances off one another. To me, it's part of the excitement. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I suppose if we start talking about someone else, I can
		  automatically relate to what you are saying. I am curious about what made Sting
		  write ``Message in a Bottle.'' But at the same time I can see things that have
		  happened to other people, where it would have been better if that area of their
		  personality hadn't been aired. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> The initial poster promoting your first album was a close-up shot
		of you in a leotard. That caused quite a bit of controversy at the time. What's
		your view, retrospectively, of that? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I didn't really see it objectively at that time, and I think now,
		  when I see it, it's quite embarrassing - but I suppose that's because I'm a
		  long way away from it. I don't think it had too many sexual connotations - I
		  thought it was rather nice at the time. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But why do you find it embarrassing now? Is it the fact that you
		can see your breasts through the vest? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it should have been cropped, and I think that's something that
		  we would certainly do now. It's not necessary, it's just something that I
		  didn't see then. Looking at it retrospectively, I can see that it was
		  suggestive. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> At the same time, there is a projection of sexuality through the
		photos on the latest album. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Do you think so, on this album cover? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Yeah, I suppose it begins with the fact that you're in a sleeping
		position... </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, you are right. That was very difficult. Because the album is
		  called Hounds of Love, and it was very difficult trying to get a picture of
		  myself with dogs that wouldn't look either like something out of <CITE>Country
		  Life</CITE> or too period - it was <CITE>impossible.</CITE> The original idea
		  was just to have the three heads - myself and a dog each side of me, but it
		  just didn't work. The dogs wouldn't stay still! It was ridiculous, and the only
		  way we could do it was to lie down with them and just get them to relax enough
		  so that they would sort of ZZZzzz! And that was the way it worked. But I
		  suppose you're right, though it wasn't initially or consciously thought of as a
		  sexual thing at all. In fact it's something - I have become I think a bit - It
		  worries me anytime I think there is any kind of sexual connotation: ``My God!
		  Should I be careful?..." </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But why does that worry you so much? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I don't know. It confuses me. It's really annoying, too, because I
		  don't see what's wrong with having sexuality, with recognising the sexual
		  quality of things. But I suppose it confuses me because when I am doing things
		  at the time, maybe people will say ``That's sexy,'' and I can't relate to it. I
		  can't see myself sexually - I just see me being silly. I can't be objective
		  about myself. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> In a funny way, there's quite a strange kind of sexuality that
		comes across through all your photography. For example, the second album, where
		you are in the lion's costume. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it didn't occur to me again - it really didn't - until people
		  started saying ``Oooh!'' And I couldn't see it. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> I suppose it's - on an entirely crude level with hounds of love,
		the implication is of consorting with animals... </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, I see, Hounds of Love, definitely. It's fascinating, I think,
		  the idea of humans becoming animals. Like the guy in <CITE>An American Werewolf
		  in London</CITE> - It's really the first time it's been done well, isn't it,
		  the idea of a man actually transferring into an animal. It's got a wonderful,
		  very primeval, magical sense about it. And I suppose that dividing line - We
		  are animals but we are different, we are much more intelligent - There is a
		  separation but there isn't. It can be really disturbing, I think, really scary.
		  Interesting. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> When you see an image, you automatically read meanings into it.
		There are certain connotations that are unavoidable, and implicit. The latest
		sleeve: I would have thought lying with two dogs asleep, entitled the hounds of
		love [<I>Sic</I>], connecting the two you have created quite a definitive...
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. I think Hounds of Love is very obvious- quite a lot of people
		  have suggested that. But when you think of it in terms of the song it's
		  completely different. It's the sense of the ``hounds'' of love: the hound
		  symbolically representing that force. You're terrified of it so you run, but it
		  keeps coming after you, and you're terrified that when it catches you, it's
		  going to hurt you. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But if you interpret that on a subconscious level, what does it
		mean? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> On a subconscious level! What are we getting into, Freud? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, why not? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I haven't gone that far. It was an image, the idea of being scared.
		  Instead of this force of man, it was a pack of hounds. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> But what are people afraid of? People are afraid of sex. People are
		fascinated by it, but it does also have the quality of inspiring fear. And
		particularly if it's with somebody or something which isn't an accepted part of
		everyday situations. So it's to do with temptation, and once you commit the
		sin, everything is actually fine - because that's what people experience in
		relation to sexuality. [<I>Huh?</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I suppose you're right. I suppose the fear of relationships is what
		  it's about, but obviously it's dealing with a man and woman, and that does have
		  to do with sexual energy. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i85_hp.html">Hot
