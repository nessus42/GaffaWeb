	 <P><B> What about the book you're planning to write, though? Again, she
		sighs (a marginal sigh) and repeats her line: There's so many things I want to
		do, and it's so hard to fit them all in... </B></P>
	 <P> <B> But yes, a book is on the cards, hopefully before the end of the
		year, and she says: I'd like to write it myself. Without saying anything about
		the other books, which I don't want to, I feel almost pressured to speak,
		otherwise there's this <CITE>huge</CITE> misrepresented area. </B></P>

		<DD> In one way it's ridiculous - I feel it's much too early to write a
		  book, I've hardly done anything yet. But I really want people to be aware of
		  reality - subjective reality, obviously. </DD>

		<DD> It'd be about what it's like being me, my feelings, my friends, the

		  and I'll have to do it myself. (1981, <CITE><A

		<DD> It was planned at one time, but I just could not find the time
