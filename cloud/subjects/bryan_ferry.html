	 <P><B> It's interesting that your first favorite record is a Beatles
		number. Why do you like that so much? </B></P>

		<DD> Well that particular song I think is an absolute classic. I think
		  it's brilliant. And the particular cover version, Bryan Ferry, I think is one
		  of the best cover versions I've ever heard. Because so often it's just nowhere
		  as good as the original song and I think it's brilliant. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> We should play it. It's ``she's leaving home.'' [<I>Bryan Ferry's
		cover of ``she's leaving home'' is played</I>] yeah, it's a beautiful song
		isn't it? </B></P>

		<DD> Incredible, I think. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Has it any personal sorta meaning to you? You haven't left home
		have you? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> [<I>Laughs</I>] no, no. It's nothing personal, it's just whenever...
		  I mean that whole album <CITE>Sergeant Pepper</CITE> is just a phenomena. It's
		  an absolute classic and all the songs on it are so beautiful. And it's just
		  good to hear a very, very excellent cover version because often they lack
		  something. I think he's captured george martin, The Beatles, everything. I
		  think it's very clever. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well I think the trouble with those kinds of questions is as soon
		  you're put them, all these names just disappear from your brain. But
		  definitely, I mean there are people I admire tremendously. Like I'd loved to
		  work with Bryan Ferry, his voice is superb. And, well Peter Gabriel, it was a
		  great honor working with him, I'd love to work with him, again. And all the
		  other names totally escape me, at the moment. [<I>Both laugh</I>] Yeah. (1985,
