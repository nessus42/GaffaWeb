	 <P><B> <IMG SRC="../xbm/new.gif" ALT="*" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> When I've
		talked to you, when I've heard you in interviews, you are such a positive
		person. And of course you were parodied a couple of years ago because you used
		to use the word ``amazing'' .. </B></P>

		<DD> Hmmm... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> ...An awful lot [<I>When</I>] you used to appear on tv - I haven't
		heard you use that word in interviews lately. But you are still a very positive
		sort of person, aren't you? How do you deal with sort of negative thoughts in
		the studio, things aren't going quite right, how do you address things like
		that? </B></P>

		<DD> I think, again, it's down to the people you're working with, 'cause
		  if you've got a positive vibe happening between the team, then really if it
		  starts going negative you can just pull it away, you can say to the people
		  ``look, come on, you know, let's forget about that.'' And I really think it is
		  down to the relationship and the feelings between the people you're working
		  with, and I was really lucky because all the people I work with are really
		  great, they're fantastic. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Is it hard work being up all the time, or are you just naturally
		sort of bright and look upon the world with a positive sort of feeling?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, I don't think I've very positive sometimes, I think I'm quite
		  negative at some times, you know. But I think there's always the feeling in me
		  that there's no reason for me to be negative because everything's great, so why
		  be negative? And then I feel better. [<I>Laughs</I>] (1982, <CITE><A
