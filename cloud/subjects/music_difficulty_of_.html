		<DD> Well even if I get the idea, I have to say ``right, I'm going to sit

		<DD> I was saying to Del that I think my tapes wouldn't know what to do

		<DD> I like to use real musicians - it's so exciting. Machines are great
		  but you can get such great feedback from people when they think they're working
		  on something intimate. Things you'd never think of. Like Mick Karn's
		  <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html">bass</A> on
		  ``<CITE>Heads</CITE>We're<CITE>Dancing</CITE>'' puts such a different feel to
		  the song. I was really impressed with Mick - his energy. He's very distinctive
		  - so many people admire him because he stays in that unorthodox area, he
		  doesn't come into the commercial world - he just does his thing. </DD>

		<DD> I suppose so, but I take an awfully long time to do it. What I
		  admire about people like Mick is the way they travel from one environment to
		  the other, but keep themselves intact. For me, I'm so used to being in my own
		  studio now, that if I'm put in another one I actually get so nervous. I suppose
		  it's finding a balance. When I did work in commercial studios all that time, I
		  did find it very uncomfortable, because there was so much pressure, and so many
		  distractions. I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> working at home so

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think the problem is, too, that there seems to be a longer gap
		  between each album progressively - which is a bit frightening for me, too. All
		  I can say is that after each album is finished and the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/promotion.html">promotion</A> is done, I can't just start
		  an album straight away, because otherwise it's just a continuation of that last
		  album. And the whole thing about writing an album is that you want to find
		  something new to say, and at the same time, try to find out who you are at that
		  point in time. You know, what you want to do. What direction you want to move
		  in. So it's very much a self-exploratory process as well. (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Are you conscious of time going by as you're making these records,
		because the gap between records seems to get a year longer every time? If we go
		right back to your first and second albums there seems to be an extra year go
		in there every time. Are you conscious of it, or do you just put that out of
		your mind? </B></P>
	 <DL>
		<DD> [<I>Laughs</I>] yes, I am very conscious of it. I think it would be
		  totally impossible for me not to be aware of it, because, you know, it just
		  gets worse and worse as time goes on. My god, I'm never going to finish this!
		  And I think my tapes wouldn't know what to do if they didn't have to sit there
		  fermenting - it's getting like wine now, where I just leave the tapes as I go
		  off and do something else, and the music kind of ferments by itself, you know.
		  [<I>Laughs</I>] it's terrifying, I'd love to be able to make an album in eight
		  weeks, I'm so envious of people who can make an album that quickly, but I know
		  I wouldn't and if I did, I just don't think I'd be happy with it unless I
		  drastically changed and then I might be able to. But this is me, it just takes
		  me a tremendous amount of agony, I mean, the agony I go through - it's
		  pathetic, you know, it's just a record, it just ten songs on a record... (1989,

	 <P> <B> Just to conclude, you said earlier that the making of this album

		<DD> Um, well that's a very ``up front'' question there, Roger! And I
		  suppose, I don't think I would have said after the last album ``this is just an
		  album'' That's a very important thing for me to have learnt: I am very
		  obsessive about my work. I spend most of my time working, and I think this is
		  something that I've really looked at in the last few years: there's a lot more
		  to life than just working and just making an album. It is just an album, it's
		  just a part of my life. It's not my Life. And I think it was, you know...
		  making albums was my life and it doesn't feel like that is any more. And that's
		  tremendous, the sense of freedom that that gives me. It's so good and I think
		  it's really healthy and much better for me, to try and put these things into
		  perspective, you know. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir89_r1.html">Roger
