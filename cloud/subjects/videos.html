		<DD> It's another art form that takes a song to a person. But in a way,
		  it becomes it's own entity. Once you put visuals with a song, it becomes
		  something completely different from the song itself. Ideally, I would like
		  people to hear the songs before they see a video of it, so that at least their
		  imagination has a chance to treat it freely, for a little while. (1985,

	 <P> <B> What kind of importance do you attach to the video of the song? It
		seems to me that it becoming more and more one of the same thing almost, its

		<DD> Yes, it is getting closer, but I haven't actually managed that yet,
		  where the point I'm actually writing the song I can see it all. And I think the
		  reason is, because when I write the song, although I'm visualizing it, its
		  quite a different thing because it's so real. Like if I writing a song about
		  another person, I really try to become that person, so I'd be totally
		  different. When you create the videos you tend to use a more theatrical
		  approach, rather than the real thing. So maybe that's one reason. </DD>

		<DD> They are getting closer. I find it gets easier with most of them to
		  create the visual ideas. Sometimes its harder, it really does depend on the
		  song. Because the song lays down every key move, who you are, what you wear,
		  what color the set is, you know. Its really the song dictates it all. </DD>

		<DD> And I think a great deal of my stimulus now comes from visuals -
		  <A HREF="../subjects/television.html">television</A>. I'm one of the television
		  generation, you know, where, a televisions in my house from, I can't remember
		  where there wasn't one here. And I was always in front of the television,
		  instead of doing my homework. I wasn't off reading books, I was watching
		  television. And cinema, that's still a very big treat for me to go and see a
		  film. So all the stimulus comes rushing in and I pack it away in the back. And
		  it will come out maybe a couple of years later. </DD>

		<DD> I have to watch out for any demons that might be creeping up on me,

		  in case they trip me up while we're going for a take. You've seen what happens
		  to Faith Brown because she doesn't look out for them. [<I>Kate's referring to

		<DD> I think video has become something a little out of proportion at the
		  moment in that it's being quite exploited. Everyone has to do a video now if
		  they've got a single coming out so there's an awful lot of stuff around.
		  Therefore, like everything, when there's a lot of it, there's a lot of rubbish.
		  I think there's some very good stuff happening and when it's good, I think it
		  can be quite effective. I think the general badness of things gives video quite
		  an unfair name in that in can be quite a creative form of art. I think it's a
		  shame how it can influence things too much as well, perhaps it's a distracting
		  influence sometimes from the song. I feel that in an industry that's a music
		  industry that the music should come first rather than the video. it would be
		  wrong if this got out of proportion and people were being signed cos they
		  looked good on video rather than actually being musically worthy, so let's hope
		  that the priorities stay right. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Open

		<DD> When the song also really works with the video that's great. That's
		  only happened to me a couple of times - I think the last two videos are good
		  [<I>" running up that hill'' and `` cloudbusting"</I>] especially the last one.
		  That was so appropriate, and the one before was really a piece of dance, so we
		  got away easy with that one. There have been a couple in the past as well, but
		  I don't really like to have to make videos for a specific single unless it's a
		  very visual song or tells a strong story. I think my ideal way of working would
		  be to treat the whole thing as a complete entity - not to just stick pictures
		  to a song whether they go together or not. I would like to explore the
		  combination of the two more in the future. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> John's photographs are so creative that he always seems to add a
		  sparkle to even the dullest moments. Videos, I feel, have moved into a
		  different area - like the recording process gradually pulled me in, so does the
		  visual world. It's impossible not to be, as soon as you become involved. </DD>

		<DD> I still think some of the best videos are where the band/artist
		  perform the song as a singer - just that simple. I share the feelings of many
		  people who dislike a lot of pop videos: they're so... unstructured! But I think
		  I've discovered that while videos are needed to go with a single, I can explore
		  the medium of film-making, of what works and what doesn't. Much of what happens
		  in a video is dictated by the song: the mood, the subject matter; but it's a
		  fascinating area, and from what I can see so far, it's very similar to the
		  recording process. It's working with pictures instead of sound - it's a very
		  different beast, but still the same ``piecing together'' of a story, images.
		  And I'm so lucky to be in a situation where I can play with sounds and pictures
		  and see if there's anything in there I'm good at. (1986, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I was reading that the two videos that you're most pleased with,

		<DD> - but the main problem is that when you write a song, you write it
		  as a <CITE>song,</CITE> and not as something that's visual. So quite often
		  there isn't a visual story contained in a song, in a way that there should be
		  to actually put on film. Budgets are a particular problem; it costs a lot of
		  money. And time - usually it's such a rush job to get it together. But more
		  recently we've been trying to get them done as much up front as possible, and
		  spend more time, effort and money on them. </DD>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I was quite pleased with `` Cloudbusting'' and `` Experiment Iv.''
		  And particularly with `` Army Dreamers,'' there was very much a visual story
		  that was adequate for film, rather than just putting a song together; they very
		  much had visual information that worked well on film. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Is the combination of unlike things a kind of oxymoron, something

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> They are very similar processes, but they are not... The way you
		  approach them is completely different. With sound, for me what I'm trying to
		  create is very much the atmosphere, the mood of what the song is designating.
		  It does create its own personality in a way. And it is a matter of treating
		  that personality in a way that it wants to, and quite often you think of things
		  that would be nice to try on a new track and you put them on and the track just
		  won't accept it; it just won't work. So there are only certain things that will
		  happen. But visually, it's not so much a layering process as the jigsaw, you
		  know, putting it all together. It's not quite the same way of layering things
		  up that you do in sound. (1987, <CITE><A

		<DD> They're so cliched and narcissistic. Most of what I've done makes me
		  cringe, though I liked `` Army Dreamers,'' because it was a complete little
		  film, not too grand and not clouding the issue. `` Cloudbusting,'' too. That's
		  probably the best I've ever done. But `` Experiment Iv was the first one I
		  directed myself. I was so keen to do that because I actually knew I would be
		  making a video while I wrote the song, so I was thinking visually from the
		  start. But then it nearly killed me, the hours it took, directing and acting in
		  it. Two weeks non-stop. It was too much for me... (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> I don't know, really. I think it's really nice that you should say
		  that, because I think things like artwork - everything that accompanies the
		  records: videos... Again, it's, hopefully, trying to stay within some kind of
		  standard of what you want to say on the album. And I think it's increasingly
		  difficult to do something interesting in music, and in videos, too. They have
		  become so cliche-ed. I think a lot of people would like not to make videos. But
		  it's a pressure that you can't argue with, because everyone does make a video,
		  and until everyone stops making videos, you actually lose out by not doing so,
		  because it's such a good way of getting people to hear the tracks. Television
		  is a very big vehicle for music, and you get people to hear your music that
		  way. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir89_gl.html">Greater
