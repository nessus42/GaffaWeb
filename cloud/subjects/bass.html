		<DD> Yes, I do <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> the bass, it's a
		  very beautiful instrument and, there's no doubt, it does put a very strong mark
		  on the track with the player's personality really coming through. And, it
		  depends, but often there are some tracks that are <CITE>asking</CITE> for
		  someone's particular style. And on this album I felt that `` Hello Earth'' and
		  `` Mother Stands for Comfort'' were very much in the style of Eberhard Weber,
		  actually it was partly Del's suggestion. I've been a fan of his for a long time
		  and a few years ago we brought him over for ``Houdini'' on The Dreaming. This
		  time he came over specially from Munich, and stayed two days to do the two
		  tracks. </DD>

	 <P> <B> <A HREF="../subjects/del_palmer.html">Del palmer</A>: I think bass
		players in particular, more so than, say, a guitarist or something like that,
		are so individual in style, and there are songs that lend themselves to certain
		players like eberhard. He's such a talented bass player, he's so together in
		his attitude and his playing. He turns up with this upright electric
		five-string double-bass that's like a work of art, and he brings his own
		amplifier, a tiny little one that I've never seen before that looked home-made
		and that he carries in a little suitcase, and he has his own stool that he
		always uses with a little frame that fits on the bottom so the bass is always
		at exactly the same angle and height. And he sets himself up, and I remember,
		on the second day, I was standing in the kitchen in the studio making tea and
		he was just sitting in the other room playing just to get himself going, and
		what he was playing was unreal. I wish I'd had a tape recorder going! I think
		personally he's the greatest bass player I've ever seen play. A beautiful
		player, and so fluid as well. (1985, <CITE><A
