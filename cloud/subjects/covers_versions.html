		<DD> I do <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> singing other people's
		  songs. I have done it. But I feel that that is in fact cheating because there
		  are so many good singers around who sing other people's songs and there aren't
		  as many songwriters in comparison. For me, my only reason I sing is because I
		  write the songs and I feel because I've written them and I know what they're
		  about, I'm the one that can convey the message the best. But, I don't really
		  consider myself a singer. I'm a singer/songwriter, but only because I write the
		  songs. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im78_tki.html">Self

		<DD> Actually, I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> singing great
		  songs written by other people, it can be fun discovering how beautiful some
		  composers' work is. But I've felt happy recording my own numbers. I regard
		  myself primarily as a songwriter and I don't want to cop out of writing. I get
		  guilty enough as it is when I'm writing for lengths of time. (1981, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Have you ever thought of doing a cover version of anybody's song at

		<DD> Oh, it's such a difficult question. There're so many good songs
		  written, and... cover versions, it's uh...it's actually very difficult to try
		  and do something that's better than the original. Like re-makes of movies:
		  they're very rarely better. [<I>Pause.</I>] I have actually done a cover
		  version that might be out in a couple of years as a song. Uhmm... </DD>

		<DD> I don't know when it will be out. It's actually beyond my control.
		  It's going through another project. But that's an Elton John song. ``<CITE><A

		<DD> And uh... Well that was one of my favourite songs. And there's a
		  good example of me never imagining when I was about twelve or thirteen- I was
		  so into Elton John, he was just like the biggest hero ever. And ``Rocket Man''
		  was one of my favourite songs, it was just wonderful. So I never imagined that
		  - how many years later? Don't mention it! [<I>Laughing</I>] - I'd actually get
		  the opportunity to record it. Brilliant, isn't it? Big circle. It's wonderful.
