		<DD> Well, we just pull it out... Well I put henna on it because it is a
		  very good conditioner, and it's like a mud and just all [<I>Makes slurping

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. I use henna wax. Otherwise I don't do anything special. I
		  sometimes plait it and let it dry to make it curl, and for the Christmas TV

	 <P> <B> How often do you get your hair cut, and do you go to a special
		hairdresser for famous people? I think your hair always looks fantastic, and
		often wonder whether you suffer from split ends, etc., like the rest of us.

		<DD> I get my hair cut about every six weeks by Anthony Jacomine. I am
		  really pleased that you think my hair looks good, as it's still recovering from
		  all the heated curlers and tongs it was blasted with on various photo sessions.
