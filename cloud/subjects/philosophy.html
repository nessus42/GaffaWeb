		<DD> I try to work on myself spiritually, and am always trying to improve
		  my outlook on life. We really abuse all that we've got, assuming that we are so
		  superior as beings, taking the liberty of sticking cement stuff all over the
		  place. I think there is a lot to astrology, and the effect the moon has upon us
		  all, but I hate the way it's becoming so trendy now. </DD>

		<DD> I'm a vegetarian, and now that's trendy as well...but what annoys me
		  the most is the way people are so automatically cynical about astrology. I
		  mean, the Greeks put an incredible amount of hard work into carefully planned
		  geometric charts, based purely on mathematics. People just shrug it off. It's
		  the same with coincidence, as I said in the song ``Strange Phenomena'' (1978,

	 <P> <B> I asked kate if she was into the occult or astrology or anything,

	 <P> <B> However, I do believe in spirits, and I also believe that people
		communicate by much more than word of mouth. There are people like beacons
		sitting on top of hills. You must have some friends that you can just feel
		calling you some days. They're just saying ``help!'' and you pick it up. (1980,

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think I've just started enjoying money. It's very useful. But I'd
		  like to think that I don't depend on it. Alot of things I do do, like an album,
		  without money I wouldn't be able to record an album. But I would still be able
		  to write the songs again. But you know there is something great about making an
		  album. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Is there anything else, spiritual or otherwise, that you don't

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Oh yeah! Now that's a completely different area. That's huge. You
		  see the material is so superficial, and it really doesn't matter. What it's
		  good for is comforts. And it can help you sorta get things done quicker, that
		  sort of thing. The other side is the real side, that's the real riches of your
		  life. And I've got a long long way to go there, I mean spiritually, as a
		  person. And a lot of things in my behavior pattern that I would love to change.
		  So that I could... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Like</I>] what? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Very personal things. I don't really you could even put a label on
		  them, little behavior things that I know I do that are stopping me from doing
		  more things. Like maybe a certain kind of laziness I have about certain things
		  - I think oh no [<I>Makes lazy motion</I>]. If I could make the effort again in
		  these little areas I could be getting more. Things like that. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, I do. I do get pimples and things, but luckily I've found some

		<DD> I don't think I'm a healthy person. You see, I dance because I want

		  that's what it's all about. (1981, <CITE><A

		<DD> No, I don't, really. But I do think certain things help, like I

		<DD> Ah, yes, I would... I think there is a lot in that. I think there's
		  also a lot in that if you are positive and can be, even if things around you
		  aren't necessarily coming back, at least you cope with them better.: so you
		  think there's this sort of powerful force behind it all? Yes, I think it's
		  actually a survival technique, a self-preservation where if you can always keep
		  coming back, keep coming up again, not staying down there, then you're going to
		  get a lot more done, you're going to be a lot more in control of what's
		  happening than if you're depressed, unhappy. (1985, <CITE><A
