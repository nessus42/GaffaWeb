	 <P><B> This is <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A> one, on new
		year's eve. And we're playing kate bush's favourite songs of all time, and
		here's one by john lennon, who was killed in the most appalling way earlier
		this month, and kate I'm wondering if you are too young at the age of
		twenty-two to have fully understood what all of the media fuss was about. So
		many people were affected so traumatically for so long. Could you really
		understand what lennon and the beatles meant to them? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> Yes, absolutely! I think probably people of about sixteen or
		  seventeen, that's the age where it wouldn't really mean that much. But even at
		  my age they really meant so much. I wasn't aware of them first happening and
		  then being the ``new thing'' But I was aware of them as the most incredible
		  source, and of Lennon being the most fantastic songwriter. He really was one of
		  my favourite artists - not as The Beatles, but as Lennon. And in fact, in
		  compiling this list a couple of months ago before the news, I'd chosen this
		  track as one of my favourites. So it wasn't meant as a tribute, it was
		  genuinely planned as one of the tracks. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Why this of all his songs? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>

		<DD> For me it's just magic. Um, his voice; the production - it's the
		  most incredible production; uh, little backwards voices. They're really things
		  that I <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A>. And just, the song and
		  everything - it's wonderful. And I - I'm really sad, because he's left the
		  biggest hole in the business that we've known yet, I think. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Here's john lennon's ``number nine dream." </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>The record is played. In my opinion there is no single record
		that kate's music reflects the influence of more clearly than this track. All
		references to Peter Gabriel's influence - even as regards production - pale
		beside a comparative listening between ``Number Nine Dream'' and any of a dozen
		of Kate's recordings. -ied</I>] </B></P>

		<DD> My all-time favourite single. Very, very difficult question, it
		  really is, because just, just trying to compare songs, you know, let alone
		  trying to put one higher than all the others... I think I would say at this
		  point in time John Lennon's ``Number Nine Dream'' - for lots of reasons. (1980,

		<DD> I think what would be nice is if they re-released it. It was well
