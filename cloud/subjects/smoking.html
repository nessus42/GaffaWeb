		<DD> I think that people smoking is one of those tiny things that says a
		  lot about human beings. I mean, I smoke and I enjoy it, but we smoke and we
		  know it's dangerous. Maybe there's some kind of strange subconscious desire to
		  damage ourselves. It would seem so if you looked back through history, wouldn't
		  it? (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i85_key.html">Keyboard</A></CITE>)
