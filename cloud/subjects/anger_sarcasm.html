		<DD> I became very shy at school. It laid some very heavy inhibitions on
		  me. I wasn't exactly bullied, but there were people who picked on me and gave
		  me a very hard time. I was very thin, and younger than most in my class, so I
		  was rather like the runt of the litter. I'd get hit occasionally, but nothing
		  that heavy. And I never fought back. </DD>

		<DD> I was aware of a lot of my friends being into things that I wasn't
		  into. Like sarcasm. It had never been a part of my family - they still don't
		  use sarcasm. I don't actually think it's nice. I think sarcasm is a very cheap
		  and negative way of trying to get laughs and make yourself superior. (1982,

		<DD> I think losing your temper is a waste of time and a bloody nuisance.
		  If you're uptight about something it's often you own fault so you should keep
		  it to yourself. If someone does something that I'm not really into, if they're
		  doing something to offend me or someone I <A
		  HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> then I will assume annoyance to get at
		  them but I don't really mean it. (????, SH) </DD>

		<DD> I think my lyrics have a far tougher edge to them now. I always
		  thought that ultimately I would be super tough... presuming that as I gathered
		  experiences I would learn to accept situations for what they are. That has
		  worked in some ways, but in others I'm far more vulnerable. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> No. I don't shout. I can't see the point. I think I can make hard
		  decisions, though. Sometimes, though, I feel vulnerable, like a little girl. I
		  need people to protect me. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think the last album is about trying to cope...to get through all
		  the shit. I think it <CITE>was</CITE> positive: showing how certain people
		  approach all these negative things - war, crime, etcetera. I don't think I'm
		  actually an aggressive person, but I <CITE>can</CITE> be. But I release that
		  energy in work. I think it's wrong to get angry. If people get angry, it kind
		  of freaks everybody out and they can't concentrate on what they're doing.

		<DD> Maybe bits of me don't want to grow up. Maybe I am an escapist, a
		  romantic, but I think if you've got an artistic - horrible word! - bent, that's
		  essential. I dislike cynicism. It's bad energy. Does that make me childlike?
