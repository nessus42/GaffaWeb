		<DD> No, I go and get them from shops. Normally antique shops because the
		  older clothes are just generally more interesting, you know. I get them
		  specially for the things I sing. (1979, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Were the brightly coloured trousers with zips and ties that you
		wore for the virgin p.a. Last year and for a number of photos specially made

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Quite a few people have assumed that they were specially made.
		  However, I did buy the trousers - from a boutique called Splash. (1983,

		come to the obvious question, why are you wearing rubber trousers [<I>While
		dancing</I>]? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>Laughs</I>] well, they're not quite rubber, I think they're
		some kind of nylon. And the idea, as with leg warmers, you wear them to keep
		your muscles warm, because when you work your muscles you can pull them much
		easily [<I>Sic</I>], and just things can go wrong easier because you're working
		them. So, to keep them warm... </B></P>
	 <P> <B> So they're not sorta stretch-and-lose-weight? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, it keeps your muscles loose all the time so you're less likely
		  to pull or damage yourself. (1981, <CITE><A
