		<DD> Um, I think there's a lot in astrology. I think it's a very ancient,
		  well mathatically planned out thing that a lot of people boo-hoo. And I think
		  it's very unfair, because there's a lot of very strong, scientific knowledge in
		  there. I think it's been commercialized a lot, which is why people become so
		  cynical. But I think the fact that people are born at a certain time, on a
		  certain day, with stars in certain position is bound to to have some effect on
		  that person because we are ruled by everything around us. </DD>

		sorta leap through to your horoscope and see what your days going to be like?

		<DD> Oh, no. I don't believe those, I think they're rubbish. They're just
		  someone who's made a generalized, commercial thing for the people to entertain
		  themselves with. I think real astrology, there is something in it, yeah. (1979,
