		  America than from anywhere else. Whereas all the earlier albums, which I'd have
		  said were far more easily listenable and commercial, had no response from that
		  country. And that seemed to me completely contradictory to what I'd been told
		  about the American market. You know, it's said that Americans are terribly

		throughout the whole of america. But I find it a little sad to think how so
		many allusions in your lyrics are bout to get lost on american ears, things

		everyone says, ``feeling lucky?'' it's like a strange oasis stuck right in the
		middle of the desert away from everything. We took a flight in a small plane
		over the grand canyon, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences I've
		ever had. The canyon is totally enormous, and we were so tiny - I've never
		experienced that kind of vertigo before or since, and with all the air pockets,
		we went up and down, up and down. (1987, <CITE><A

		<DD> I think lyrically there's a lot that defines English music, and I
		  suppose a certain approach to sounds. There are very definite American
		  approaches to sound - guitar sounds, approaches to songs, the Fender Rhodes; as
		  soon as you hear that it's America. But to actually define African, or
		  American. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i89_im.html">International

		<DD> It doesn't really upset me. I've never seen making an album in terms

		<DD> I make music because I love making it. I do it for the sheer delight
		  of watching it come together. I'm in love with the whole process. It's
		  important to me to keep that kind of priority. If people want to hear it,
		  that's a wonderful extra. But it's not something you should expect. You really
		  have to do things for the love of doing them - and not for the reward
		  afterwards. (1990, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">Los Angeles Times</A></CITE>)

		<DD> Well, I think it's very possible, plus I think there have been so
		  many other inaccessible areas to me here as an artist. I guess my last record
		  company found it difficult to express me as an artist to the public, and my
		  second and third albums were received here at a later date [<I>1983-1984</I>].
		  I think people must have quite a confusing <A
		  HREF="../subjects/image.html">image</A> of me. In a way this is something I
		  have to not worry about too much, um... because that's not really my
		  responsibility. My responsibilities are the artistic, where I have to make the
		  best record I can at the time, and I have to let people know it's out there.
		  But all <CITE>those</CITE> areas kind of are out of my control. (1989, <CITE><A
