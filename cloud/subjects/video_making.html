		<DD> The [<I>Early</I>] videos seen on TV in the U.K. were made by Keef
		  MacMillan, a fantastic man who I really enjoy working with, and who's now a
		  good friend. It starts when he comes for three or four hours in an evening, and
		  we sit and talk about what we want to do. So far, at each stage our thinking
		  has been on the same level, which is very good. I tell him what I've got in
		  mind, and he says that that was what he was thinking too. I then show him the
		  routine, and he thinks of different camera angles and possible effects. Then we
		  go into the studio and do it, and each time we've taken a whole day. His camera
		  crew are the most amazing guys, and all work hours of overtime because they
		  want to do it well, which is really unusual. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> To start with I sit and listen to the song, and think of the
		  personality who is in it. The easiest was `` The Man With the Child in His
		  Eyes.'' I was sitting listening, trying to figure out who was singing it, and
		  my brother John suggested I do it like that, sitting down. Then all I had to do
		  was think about floor exercises I had done in previous lessons. I had the idea
		  of someone sitting down and telling someone something rather secret, and put in
		  human, rather nervous habits, like pulling hair, rubbing the nose, looking up
		  to heaven, and that sort of thing; trying to characterize it that way. Then
		  when I've listened once, I put the track on again and start moving, keeping on
		  to the end. The ideas come to me with the words, and then I try to refine it.
		  It's hard to get as much variation as I'd like, but that's a lot to do with the
		  fact that I'm not a dancer. When we did the filming on that song, a lot of time
		  was spent on the lighting, which was very complicated, and the perspex box that
		  I sat on to give a floating effect, with lights underneath, got very hot. By
		  the end of the day I had an incredible rivet-mark where I was sitting, which
		  stayed for about four days. Every time I moved, it sounded like sandpaper. I
		  really enjoy doing the videos, but by the end I really ache, and it gets very
		  hot, especially under the thick make-up. But there's a nice tired feeling with
		  a good day's work behind you. It's a real team effort, with everyone really
		  enthusiastic and interested in helping me to enjoy it. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, I do, I think because of the way I used to work. I always used

		<DD> I always work with a director and you have to use an awful lot of

		when you perform a song there's none of this sort of standing up in front of

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Not always at the writing stage. And there is a lot of visual ideas,
		  because when you're writing the song you've got to think of the character who's
		  singing the song, who often isn't yourself, and that character will be in a
		  particular situation, either an unhappy one or in a certain room with a certain
		  person. And I think all these things you actually mentally push yourself into
		  to write the song so that you'll be closest to that atmosphere. And when you
		  make a video, often you can't afford to visually do what you have in your mind,
		  so often you'll slightly change it, make it a bit more abstract rather than go
		  through the full thing. </DD>

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, it's quite a long process. It depends on the song, the song
		  really dictates what you have to do with it. Some songs are very simple and
		  other songs almost become little epics, where you've got to section lots of
		  things together. And if you're using other people in the video then you have to
		  get choreography for them and make sure that they look right and they do the
		  right things. And it really is a lot of fun actually, for me it's almost like
		  making a film and I think of it as something very special. </DD>

		  I drew these little pictures, I don't know if you can see these. [<I>The
		  pictures are not clear. Scenes from the video are edited in</I>] The video
		  starts off with an eye blinking in time to the music, it's very rough drawings.
		  And the camera moves out and as the camera moves out you see a little boy on my
		  lap. And this is really sort of step by step, almost like a cartoon. (1981,

		<DD> I really wanted to try and make videos that looked like short films

		<DD> I am a big admirer of Terry Gilliam's work - he is a great director.
		  I asked his advice; could he suggest people I could work with who were good. He
		  recommended David Garfath, who had worked as a cameraman for him. The lighting
		  cameraman was Phil Mayheux - who, interestingly, worked on the <CITE>Max

		<DD> The video [<I>" running up that hill"</I>] took eight weeks: six

		<DD> " Cloudbusting'' took eight to ten weeks, working with Julian Doyle,

		  many areas of the shoot, with Brian Helighy lighting for the first time - it's
		  hard to believe that it is his first time at lighting. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> ...Now I noticed you didn't move your lips to the music in three of

		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, they were all shot on film, but all eventually were edited on
		  video. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Apart from `` Running Up That Hill,'' which was edited totally in
		  the video suite, the others were edited on film as much as possible: doing all
		  the cuts - except the ones that need special effects: slowing down, speeding
		  up. All this is much quicker (and sometimes cheaper) to do on video, and with
		  promo deadlines video is so convenient. But it does change the quality of the
		  pictures when the film is transferred to video: it somehow loses its depth. But
		  I'm sure in a couple of years the quality will be brilliant. Video is advancing
		  all the time, but for me you can't beat the original quality of film, it's a
		  very ancient form. The advantage of video is being set loose on all the
		  effects, although on the E.P. all except ``<CITE>Big Sky</CITE>'' have been
		  approached from a purist film-maker's point of view: very few special effects.
		  We deliberately encouraged this, again trying to emphasise the film aspect.
		  Which has a lot to do with no lip-synch: as soon as a performer is ``singing",
		  they become that performer doing other things while singing. Which is great
		  live, but on film, people acting out events without the lip distractions have
		  more chance of playing a character. I found it very interesting and much more
		  enjoyable. I'm always concerned about the miming being as accurate as possible,
		  and that takes a lot of concentration and makes me behave like a singer. So
		  without the lip-synch I could put much more effort into a character. I felt a
		  little nervous about it in `` Cloudbusting.'' In Running Up That Hill it was
		  different: no lip-synch, but I was trying to act a dancer, and they are facial
		  expressions I know the sensations of. But playing a little boy, and playing
		  opposite Donald Sutherland, I began to wonder if I was going mad, voluntarily
		  putting myself in these situations where I had a ninety percent chance of
		  looking a total absolute idiot! But if anything, Donald made it seem extremely
		  natural, he was just like my Dad. He could make it rain, and I would watch him
		  being taken away. I must say it was an extremely moving experience, burnt
		  strongly into my memory upon the hill with the machine and the wind... (1986,

		  directing is actually a little too far in the future, but is perhaps more
		  attractive than actually performing in front of the camera. [<I>When kate says

		  into a little piece of film. Say, like `` Cloudbusting", that's a lot of fun to
		  make. It was a story and it's a matter of telling the story visually. (1989,

		<DD> I'd *LOVE* to make a film, even if it's just a short film. It's li
		  back to that story-telling process again, where I'd be able to deal with
		  pictures as well as sound. Putting the two together is such a powerful thing.

		<DD> I do <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> directing. My favorite
		  is when I don't actually have to be in the video much and I can make it a
		  little film. I haven't been working on that long, but I've really got a group
		  of people now that I would like to work with all the time as a crew. I have a
		  fantastic crew. They're so enthusiastic - it makes it tremendously challenging
		  and quite a moving experience for me to feel all these people working together
		  as a group to make something. It's very different from making records, which is
		  really a more isolated situation. On the film set it's maybe up to forty
		  people. (1990, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i90_op2.html">Option</A></CITE>)

		<DD> My <A HREF="../subjects/videos.html">videos</A> are more
		  film-influenced now. When I first started making videos, I was so obviously
		  theatrically and dance-influenced. A lot of that was from Lindsay Kemp and
		  dance teachers with whom I had been working. Gradually the more involved I got
		  in video, the process of making films, the more I've swung around to
		  filmmaking. It's a beautiful discipline, dance, and it can be lovely, but I
		  guess I'm getting far more into filmmaking now. (1990, <CITE><A

		<DD> Yes, it does, but I think in a way what I'm moving towards - and I
		  don't know if it will work or not, but I feel it's leading me there - is the
		  combination of music and film. I hope that someday - in a few years - I could
		  experiment with making a film. Maybe not a full-length feature, but I would
		  like to work with visuals and music at the same time, because at the moment I'm
		  restricted to visuals - in the context of the videos - to music that already
		  exists, and I'd really like to play with this a lot more. (1989, <CITE>Reaching

		<DD> Yes, I do, but I think it's because I really love the whole process
		  of film. I just find it fascinating. Every time I make a video, it gives me an
		  opportunity to learn about it. Like having your own studio. The amount I've
		  learnt about that process is tenfold. And with videos, because I got involved
		  and the people I worked with earlier on really encouraged me, I have learnt a
		  lot about the process over the years, really. (1989, <CITE><A
