	 <P><B> Do you ever think you'll do anything with Peter Gabriel again?

		<DD> I hope so, yes. We're trying to work on something at the moment, but
		  it's quite hard to get all the business through, but I hope that will happen.
		  He's great to work with. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> He worked with our next act, didn't he? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, he did. It's a very strange coincidence. Uh, because I saw him
		  the other day, and just mentioned if he'd heard of Jules and the Polar Bears -
		  which is one of the next tracks we're playing. And he said yes, he had because
		  he was producing their live EP, and he sent it on a couple of days later. It's
		  very good. </DD>

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> And the track that I've chosen is called ``The Smell of Home.'' And
		  it's off an album called <CITE>Phonetics.</CITE> Which is very interesting,
		  because all the lyrics on the lyric sheet they've actually written
		  pho-net-i-cal-ly! So you can try to read the words, and it's uh, all in
		  phonetics. And I think they're great. I've never heard of them in this country.
		  They've not been played on the <A HREF="../subjects/radio.html">radio</A>, as
		  far as I know. And they're great - he's got an incredible voice, the lead
		  singer. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, I think, I have been played in the evening - </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> They have? </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> - But not so much during the day, really. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, I've not heard them getting enough recognition anyway. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Well, let's hear them in one of their earliest time slots: Jules
		and the Polar Bears, ``the smell of jome." </B></P>
	 <P> <B> [<I>This record is played.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> "The Smell of Home,'' by Jules and the Polar Bears, one of Kate
		Bush's all-time favourite tracks. (1980, <CITE><A
