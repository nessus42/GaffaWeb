		<DD> I want it to stand on the weight of my work, not what I look like. I
		  realize people are going to capitalise on it. It annoys me though. Why should
		  people want to know about my sex life. It's completely irrelevant to what I'm
		  doing. I give them everything they need to know about me in my songs because
		  they are personal songs. </DD>

		<DD> Being regarded as a sex object just gets in the way most of the time
		  unless its relevant to the role I'm playing in the song. Guys get it, of
		  course, but only those that seem to ask for it. Girls seem to get it whether
		  they want to be regarded in that way or not. To overplay it is wrong. It can't
		  possibly last. (1978, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/i78_rm.html">Record

	 <P> <B> She is, indeed, a beautiful woman. Carved ivory, with nary a nick.
		So obviously there is no way she can avoid becoming the target for sexist
		minds. Although she does not advocate this reaction, she's not flustered by it.
		After all, it is a compliment. </B></P>

		<DD> As long as it does not interfere with my progress as a
		  singer-songwriter, it doesn't matter, I just wish people would think of that
		  first. I would be foolish to think that people don't look. I suppose in some
		  ways it helps to get more people to listen... (1978, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I once saw a photograph of you taken from your live tour and you
		were covered in sweat and licking the barrel of a gun. I found it erotic but
		frightening, because it was so blatant. (I also accused her, after watching the
		video of the hammersmith gig, of oozing sex all over the stage.) what, as a
		performer, are your feelings with regard to an audience's erotic reaction to
		you? </B></P>

		<DD> I suppose it's something I don't really know about. Your energy on
		  stage dictates the character you are--then. I'm too subjective. I just see
		  me...Either I get embarrassed, or it's working. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Also, in a later question about her initial press identity, kate
		remarked: When I first appeared, the press couldn't handle me in any normal
		way. I was the girl who sang in a funny voice, with ``the body'' .. (1982, nme)

		<DD> It's hard for me to say. The way people see me is so diverse,
		  [<I>comments kate, on the theory that childishness is part of her appeal</I>].
		  I suppose in lots of ways I'm still very much like a little girl, and probably
		  always will be, even if I make it to 60 or 70. </DD>

		<DD> It's an interesting perspective of life, a child's. Maybe it's
		  because I'm so small and still at knee level. The symbolism of the child is
		  such a powerful thing, because it's the small vulnerable thing looking out at
		  the big world. </DD>

	 <P> <B> But hasn't reaching 30...? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Ok, stop rubbing it in, young man! </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Don't you start worrying about what people think of you physically?

		<DD> But this is like the first time we've experienced young music
		  growing old, and it's like people won't allow it. Look at the stick a lot of
		  our gorgeous men are getting now that they're in their 40s. It doesn't seem to
		  be hip for guys to be in their 40s and still in the rock industry. </DD>

		<DD> I don't really see myself as a performer, and that's hard for
		  me--when I have to come out and expose myself and be the saleswoman of the
		  hour. I don't have the same kind of exposure as other performers do. I suppose
		  if people think I look horrible they tend to keep it to themselves. Maybe I
		  haven't started hitting the real horrors yet. What do you think? </DD>

		<DD> It's the whole train of thought: ``Oh my God, doesn't she look
		  old!'' Usually I get, ``Oh my God, doesn't she look small!'' (1989, <CITE><A
