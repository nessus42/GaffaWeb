		<DD> The way I've always worked is to be with the piano. I never write
		  songs without the piano - it's always me and it and we communicate. And I
		  always write the words with the tune - they seem to come together and it's very
		  much a thing of moods. If the chord I'm playing is telling me something, then
		  the words will come from that. If it is a minor feel, it will be a sad song
		  because minor chords are very sad things. If it's a major chord, it will be a
		  slightly maybe, rockier, happier song. </DD>

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> What happens is that I sit down and I start playing the piano and
		  it's the progression of chords that comes out that actually leads to the song.
		  Until I sit down at the piano and have no idea what's going to happen.
		  sometimes, before I go there, maybe I'll have an idea that I've picked up from
		  a film or just from talking to someone about something I've never known about
		  before. You can find inspiration can click in so many different ways: it can be
		  something completely out of the blue that you'll suddenly think ``I really want
		  to write a song.'' I think that's how it works though. I think art is about
		  spontaneous feelings and feedback of people, objects, whatever. It's just a
		  continuous process of creation. (1978, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> When I write songs I normally get the music first. They used to come
		  together, but now the music seems to be sparked off by an idea before the
		  lyrics, and the lyrics usually fit in just behind the music. It's not very
		  often that I actually see the dance routine when I'm writing the song. When
		  it's written, there are basic things there already, and in fact I find that the
		  more I write - especially recently for this album - the more I see things when
		  I'm writing. This is unusual, and I tend to shut them out because I can't
		  concentrate so well on the song itself. (1980, <CITE><A

		<DD> Since I first started writing, the styles and attitudes have
		  changed. Initially, it was just ``me and the piano,'' and I would write the
		  song until it was completely finished - the lyrics, the tune of one song would
		  take me a couple of weeks. For the last two albums [Never For Ever AND The
		  Dreaming] it's been much looser, and I've been working with rhythm machines as
		  well as the keyboard, and using subject matter already in my head. I'll then
		  make up the music almost on the spot for the subject matter. (1982, <CITE><A

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> For most of them I literally just run the tape and learn them in my

		  them out first at home. Sometimes I can tell that they're going to work in
		  harmony without having to put one down and then work to that, but it depends,

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, I never work that way - I just go for what sound right, and
		  never think technically about thirds and fifths, because very often I think
		  fourths and sixths could be better. I like to use parallel movement for a more
		  medeiaeval feel, and I also sing unrelated notes against the harmony - say,
		  dropping semitones - which helps to create a lot of tension. But I do try to
		  avoid thinking about the technical things when I'm working - it's afterwards
		  that I like to think about those aspects. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> For the male voice parts, I just sing to them what I want them to
		  do, and I tell them the particular phraseology and timing. Then they go out and
		  do it, while I oversee it in the mixing room. I'm lucky in that they're not
		  really session singers, but more friends with good voices. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> There's a lot of counterpoint in your compositions. Do you find
		this comes naturally? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, it's something that I find works in layers as well. For
		  example, normally the song, with its basic tune and chords, would be down, and
		  then, as things start to go on more to the track, I can just hear holes that
		  need to be filled in a certain way. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Sometimes I would be doing this with tapes at home or during a meal
		  break at the studio. I'd go round and round parts of the tape and sing with it.
		  </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> So your procedure is to compose the piece on the piano with the
		lyrics and have some definite ideas for performing it at home. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> For the actual tune; whilst any additional harmonies would be added
		  afterwards using a tape with the basic piece on it. I use a Revox half-track
		  machine to sing along with - I never put it down through at this stage - I just
		  sing with it to see if it works. Really, it's for playback, to help me, and I
		  would use an eight-track studio for demos. I've also been using the Teac
		  Portastudio 144, which I find useful. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Do you have any set way of composing your harmonies? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> None at all, it depends completely on the song. Whatever the song's
		  saying, then that little hole in there that's waiting for a harmony needs
		  something special. For example, in the `` Hammer Horror'' song, I thought out
		  the clashing harmonies carefully, and the `` Violin'' piece came about because
		  that was the only instrument I was ever taught. [<I>Does this indicate that
		  kate composed ``violin'' on the violin???</I>] (1982, <CITE><A

		<DD> I've had a home studio for the last few years. For this album, we

		  <A HREF="../subjects/money.html">money</A> every hour for a London studio. That

		  and the drums are out of time, it's got the feel of the song. Them you come to
		  master it and it's not there. It's too fast or too clean. It's just not the
		  same. Trying to recreate the moods of something you did so spontaneously can be
		  so impossible. What we've done on this album is make the demos the masters. We
		  demoed in the studio so that there were no demos anymore. They've transformed

		  to use the spoken word to communicate my ideas. Now I can compose parts I never

		<DD> For me, it all started with tinkering around with the piano at the
		  age of ten or eleven. That sort of grew into songs, and my voice got better as
		  I worked it through the songs. Then I went through the studio environment, and
		  by the time I had got that far I realized that the studio had such a big effect
		  on a song that if I wanted to be in control totally, I would have to produce it
		  too. Then came the visual side, which for me in many ways is the performance
		  aspect. All of these elements are extensions of being a songwriter, and that is
		  what I consider myself to be. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I'm interested in how your song writing process works. When you're

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It very much depends on the musician. Some people would not want to
		  come in to the studio without having had a cassette that they could listen to
		  and work some ideas out from. But normally what happens is the musician comes
		  in, we play the track, which would have the basics on it. I sort of work
		  backwards to most people in a lot of ways in that the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/bass.html">bass</A> quite often goes on nearly as one of
		  the last instruments. So the track they would hear would have the drums, piano,
		  voice, some keyboards, even guitar sometimes. And quite often now, we have a
		  very good atmosphere going on the tape before the musician comes in, so
		  although it might be very rough, what's on there is a very strong mood of what
		  it will be like at the end. It's got all the feelings in there, and it's just a

		<DD> Yes, it's very difficult to re-create things like that, and that's

		  some really dodgy things, and quite often you do; but there might be something
		  that is so spontaneous that you won't be able to do again in the same way, and
		  it's there on tape. (1987, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> How are you putting together songs now? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> At least six or seven of the tracks on this new album have been done
		  in totally different ways. There's one track that I literally wrote on the
		  Fairlight and then re-did things completely with strings. And the drums, which
		  were originally Linn, were re-done with a live drummer. Then there's another
		  track that's completely different, where I'd write through a guitarist. It
		  really needed to be based around a guitar and I can't play guitar. If I'd used
		  a piano or Fairlight, it would've been wrong, so I literally had to write
		  through the guitarist. That was fabulous. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> What was it that made you decide to replace the fairlight and linn
		with real strings and real drums? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I suppose it's when I get the voice and lyrics on, they tell me what
		  to do. I thought, um... Although the Fairlight strings were interesting, they
		  didn't have the... the warmth and the intimacy that the song required, and...
		  it sounded a bit bland on the Fairlight. That particular song was a very
		  intimate one. It needed... a wooden, human error, you know, the fact that it
		  wasn't always on the beat, and that there was this group of people working
		  together creating that sound. I do feel that in most cases when you've got a
		  brilliant musician and an instrument you really... I mean, what's the Fairlight
		  there for? I think it...it's a different purpose, to me anyways. I don't feel I
		  want to create the world's greatest cellist on the Fairlight. You know, I'd
		  rather get a really good cello player in, and record him with a good engineer,
		  and then use the Fairlight to do something that complimented that. The most
		  exciting thing for me is the combination of real and natural sounds and
		  extremely electronic synthesized ones. It's just the blend of two worlds that I
		  find fabulous. In the next few years, it's going to be really lovely to see how
		  people start working these things. We've been in a real synthetic era for the
		  last three years. People have been interested in the new advances in
		  synthesizers. It's really exciting, and I think it's got people so wrapped up
		  in electronics that now perhaps will come the time when the blend will happen.
		  </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> What about the idea that you may not be create the best cellist on
		the fairlight, but that you will be the cellist? It won't be pablo casals'
		expression, it will be kate bush's expression? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I think that could be interesting, but I also think that could
		  be boring. On this album I've done so much of the work that I really enjoy
		  other people's input. I find it boring, actually, to have to work with my ideas
		  all the time. The great thing, again, you can do with the Fairlight that I
		  enjoy so much is I can write a piece on it, say, with an acoustic guitar or a
		  cello, and I can write it out, and then I can get a musician in to actually
		  play that. So he's playing what I've written, but he's doing it much better
		  than I could do. You see, without the Fairlight, I probably couldn't have
		  written these parts before. I would have written them on the piano and they
		  wouldn't have had the feel of the strings, or acoustic guitar. And at the same
		  time, you know I don't think me playing them on the Fairlight is as good as
		  these people. But it's an interesting blend. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Do you feel you have a better understanding of how these people
		play? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, certainly in my experience, it's given me the most incredible
		  insight into composing and how instruments work. And I think it's sort of... If
		  you're not careful it can give you an arrogance as well, where you're sort of
		  sitting there playing all these drums and thinking, ``Hey, you know, why can't
		  you do this?", you know - like it's so easy. On the other hand, you know, there
		  are little inflections that would be so difficult to get on the keyboard. I
		  mean, you could probably get it to sound very close, but it... it might... just
		  not sound like the real instrument. A lot of natural instruments, that's what
		  it's about. It's the inflection of the musician, the way he works it,
		  personalizes it. I mean, you know real instruments should never die. I don't
		  think they can. That's what all these electronic things have come from. They
		  should go hand in hand. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Do you compose on paper or right into the fairlight or tape
		machine? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's really in my head first and then onto the tape machine. I only
		  compose onto paper when it's an instance like a guitar or cello, where I play
		  in real time to the track, and then when I like what it is, I'll write it out
		  for someone to play. If it's me playing it, I don't bother to write it out. I
		  work much better in my head. It takes me hours to write things out. I'm so
		  slow. But writing it out is a very accurate way to get them to do what you want
		  very quickly. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Kate, do your songs just burst out of you like so many athenas out
		of the head of zeus, or are they very crafted and do they cost you a lot of
		suffering and effort to construct as finished art-pieces? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's very different every time, really. With the Never For Ever
		  album, I had to work really hard to write most of those songs. It would take me
		  weeks and weeks just to get a chorus or to write the words. But then, when we
		  went into the studio, it was actually quite spontaneous and very quick. Whereas
		  with most of the songs on The Dreaming, I just sat down at the piano, got a
		  rhythm and just literally wrote the songs. I couldn't believe it! I mean to
		  say, the words probably weren't there, but the idea was there, and all the
		  tunes were there. That was the first time I'd actually demo'ed the songs while
		  writing them. I put the piano down, put a voice down, put backing vocals down,
		  and I had a song! And apart from `` Houdini,'' which nearly killed me, the rest
		  were just so easy, it was really frightening. But then, as soon as I hit the
		  studio, all that speed and spontaneity seemed to evaporate and turn into
		  something completely different. The recording became really, really hard work,
		  and it was very intense. With the new Hounds of Love album, the songs took
		  quite a lot of time and effort to come out. Now that I've got my own studio, a
		  lot of the writing process is very much the recording process so, rather than
		  going in with a finished song, I'm able to go straight in and actually write
		  the song in the studio, so that took a little bit of time. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> So it's not as if you're so abundantly creative that we're being
		deprived of a whole wealth of songs that never got onto disc? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I wish, I wish, I wish! I think if I was abundantly creative, I
		  could just sort of sit back and go: ``Ah, there's another one, how about
		  that!'' But I just find it so hard. Usually with every album I'm in a situation
		  where I <CITE>scrape</CITE> together the songs. The first album was the only
		  one where that wasn't so, then I had literally hundreds of songs to choose
		  from, as I'd been writing from about the age of eleven. But now it's just
		  getting harder for me to write. I think the longer I'm around, the harder it is
		  for me to find something convincing in my art. There are all kinds of
		  subject-matters which I think I could probably have enjoyed at an earlier time,
		  but which now I find trivial. So there are all these changes. You know, the
		  more you see, the more there is to fear, and the more there is to learn. And I
		  think that very much applies to my work. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> And presumably your own criteria of perfection tend to escalate, so
		it gets a lot harder to reach that threshold. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I think so, yes, that's right. And also, of course, you can't
		  really control what comes out, which is something that I have to keep telling
		  myself. Because, you know, I think I'm going to sit down and write this or
		  that, but it all just depends on how you're feeling or what's happening. You
		  can't really control it. Other than rejecting or accepting things and putting
		  them into different bits of order, you don't have any control over it. It's not
		  something that you actually <CITE>own.</CITE> I <CITE>could</CITE> write an
		  album very quickly, but maybe only one of the songs would be what I considered
		  <CITE>interesting</CITE> enough, and I wanted to make sure with the new album
		  that all the songs were good. Really, it's the lyrics that are like a big
		  process that keeps on happening right from the word ``go'' till I've done the
		  last lead vocal. I mean, still then I'm playing with little bits of lyrics here
		  and there that maybe weren't quite right... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Is all that what accounts for the three-year gap between the
		dreaming and hounds of love? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, it takes me a long time to write stuff that I feel is
		  interesting enough, and also it takes me a long while to come out of the wake
		  of one album and come into the energy of a new album. Because i would be wrong,
		  I think, to be in the same frame of mind that I was in for the last album. And,
		  in a way, you have to sort of say, ``Well, O.K., that was it; now I'm gonna go
		  out and just find some new stimulus.'' 'Cause, you know, you go from one very
		  intense atmosphere into another one, and you've got to get some new inspiration
		  in between. But another big reason why the new album took so long is Side Two,
		  <CITE>The Ninth Wave.</CITE> It was incredibly difficult to actually be brave
		  enough to go for it. I had the feeling that that was what I wanted to do. But
		  then I started getting scared of it - you know, I knew that, if it didn't work
		  out, then I'd have wasted all that effort for nothing. Then I decided, though,
		  O.K., yeah, I'm gonna go for it; but that was a relatively brave thing to do
		  and it took a lot of time. What really consumed the time, though, was that the
		  tracks took a long time to finish, they weren't as good as they should be,
		  there were lots of things that still needed to be done. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Del: I think it all really depends on what the context is. If the
		content wasn't too deep, then it could all be done very quickly. It's when
		you're trying to create a specific <CITE>atmosphere</CITE> that it gets
		difficult. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Kate: It does, it depends on what the songs themselves demand. And
		the best thing about having the studio was not having the pressure of being in
		a studio that was costing nearly a hundred quid an hour. We do like to
		experiment, and sometimes it takes a while to make an experiment work. So we
		were able to take the time... </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> But is having your own studio a two-sided coin, in that, while it
		makes life a lot easier, you don't feel under the same pressure, and it's
		therefore much harder to complete things and tie them up? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, I thought that might be a problem but actually, the way we
		  worked, I don't think it was, there was a pressure all the time because the
		  album kept taking longer and I was very concerned that it should be finished.
		  </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> I think, only naturally, a lot of people are wondering to
		themselves why there's been a three year interval since the dreaming, and
		they're fearful they'll have to wait another three or four years before the
		next album. Was setting up the studio responsible for some of the delay?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, yes it was, to set up base down here rather than coming up to
		  London all the time. As well as actually getting the place together, it takes
		  some time to actually get ahold of and accumulate all the
		  <A HREF="../subjects/equipment.html">equipment</A>, so that you've got what you
		  need at hand. Also we made the step up from 24-track to 48-track while doing
		  it. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> You don't think that if you were in an urban environment you'd be
		under a different pressure, under a different stimulus, and you might be more
		productive? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, I think there're more distractions when you go into an urban
		  environment, and I think that was one of my big problems. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Del: I think you've been more productive since you've been living
		out here. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Kate: I have, absolutely. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> So then the bottom line is that, even if the bottom were to fall
		out, now that you've got your own studio you'd be able to keep on making new
		records? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Del: Yes, but I think there'll always be a market for kate's music.
		</B></P> 
	 <P> <B> I think so, too! But even if worst came to the absolute worst, with
		the studio you'd be able to keep on recording even if only for your own
		edification. Once an album finally exists, can you enjoy it or will you have
		nothing more to do with it? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I couldn't with the first two albums as they didn't turn out the way
		  I wanted them to, so obviously when I listened to them it was quite
		  disappointing for me because I kept thinking of all the things I'd have liked
		  to have done. But the third and fourth albums, yes, I could listen to those and
		  be quite critical about them and yet feel quite pleased about some of the
		  things on them. Artistically, I was especially pleased with The Dreaming. I
		  achieved lots more on it than on the earlier ones. But then the songs were, in
		  a way, more accepting of that kind of emotional style because they were so
		  intense and demanding. The new album, which is the one I'm most happy with, was
		  a very different energy. It was summer last year and I felt I wanted to write
		  songs that had a very positive energy rather than staying in all that intensity
		  of emotion that was so strong with the last album. I think it's important that
		  each album <CITE>should</CITE> be different, otherwise you're not going
		  anywhere and exploring but staying in a rut. But then it takes time to carry
		  yourself over from one energy to another because you tend to get into little
		  riffs and phrases and so on that perhaps you've got as some kind of theme on
		  the last album, even if that's not obvious. And it's important, I think, to
		  start writing in a slightly new style. Now that it's all done, I can sit here
		  and enjoy it, especially here in the studio because this is the optimal way to
		  hear it, because this is where it was all done. As soon as it gets onto vinyl,
		  onto disc, <CITE>sounds</CITE> different. And now I can just sit here and relax
		  instead of taking notes, you know, like to remind me I've got to study that bit
		  and so on... </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Del: Yeah, you should <CITE>see</CITE> the notes! There's two
		files, this thick! Full of notes, you'd never believe it. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> Kate: Yes, they're little memos and scribbles and charts on takes
		that are good. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> You don't have staves with whole lines of music written out?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, no, the only time I did that was for the cello parts in
		  ``Hounds of Love'' that's the only time I've ever written out a part. I stayed
		  up all night to do it and wasn't sure if I could. But I worked them out on the
		  Emulator and wrote out the chords that I played in the treble clef. Then the
		  cellist Jonathan Williams - he's such a great player and so into the music he
		  was - helped me out by working i [<I>??? Delete the ``I"</I>] an octave lower.

	 <P> <B> Well, complex, yes. But I mean <CITE>unfamiliar.</CITE> your songs
		just aren't so easily sing-able, they're not very easily predictable, in the
		manner of most indigenous american music. I mean, once you've heard one verse
		and a chorus of an american song you've as good as heard the whole thing. And I
		think that's what so surprises me about the comparative success of the dreaming
		in the states, as so much american pop music is incredibly trite, so much of it
		has to do with stupefaction rather than revelation. But, you know, in one or
		two of the american reviews of the dreaming, your music has been described as
		``schizophrenic", and to tell you the truth, I feel I can well understand why
		people have said that. You know I'm a historian concerned with freud and
		psychoanalysis. And it seems to me that, in a manner of speaking, your music
		represents a virtual compendium of psychopathology; I mean to say, it is
		alternatively hysterical, melancholic, psychotic, paranoid, obsessional, and so
		on. And yet, in your case, such traits obviously proceed out of strength, not
		out of weakness, they represent roles which you're assuming, or states which
		you're simulating, for the sake of a given song. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes! Well, I think that's fabulous that you should say so. You see,
		  while I'm maybe not scientifically interested like you, I am absolutely
		  fascinated by the states that people throw and put on. And, you know, I think
		  that that is the most fascinating thing there is to write about really, the way
		  that people just distort things and the things they think and the things they
		  do. And it's really fun for me if I can find an area of the personality that is
		  slightly exaggerated or distorted and, if I feel I can identify with it enough,
		  then try to cast a person as perfectly as I can in terms of that particular
		  character trait, especially if I don't really show those kinds of things
		  myself. Take anger for instance: it's really fun to write from the point of
		  view of someone who's really <CITE>angry,</CITE> like in `` Get Out of My
		  House'' on the last album. Because I very rarely show anger, although obviously
		  I do sometimes feel it. And it was the same sort of thing with `` Waking the
		  Witch'' on the new album. What fascinated me in doing that song was the idea of
		  a witch-hunter hiding behind the priesthood, as a guise, and coming to get this
		  woman who isn't a witch, but he wants to <CITE>make</CITE> her so. The girl
		  closes her eyes to get away from it and goes to a church where it's safe and
		  secure. You know, churches are supposed to be places of sanctuary and their
		  doors are never shut, even perhaps for people being chased by the Devil; but
		  the priest turns out to be the witch-hunter. I didn't really have any heavy
		  experiences like those that the song is about. It's based very much on other
		  people's imagery of Roman Catholicism which I've found fascinating - you know,
		  the kind of oppression, even madness, it can create, I suppose, in some people.
		  And it's much more that, really, than any personal experience of my own. My
		  school was Roman Catholic, so there was a big emphasis on religion, but it
		  wasn't incredibly strict, and I didn't really go to church an awful lot, so I
		  don't think the experience of religion was as heavy for me as for a lot of
		  people... </DD>

		<DD> I can feel very affected by them, but I don't think they actually
		  take me over. I think I was very much affected by `` Breathing;'' and, when I
		  was making the last album, I was very affected by `` Houdini.'' Because it was
		  <CITE>really sad</CITE> trying to be Houdini's lady, because he had died and

		  escape not only throughout his life, but also in death. </DD>

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Um...yes. I think `` Cloudbusting'' was quite like that. It must
		  have been nearly ten years ago, when I used to go up to the Dance Center in
		  London, that I went into Watkins' occult bookshop for a look, and there was
		  this book and it said, <CITE>A Book of Dreams,</CITE> by Peter Reich. I'd never
		  heard of his father, Wilhelm Reich, but I just thought it was going ``Hello,
		  Hello,'' so I just picked up the book and read it and couldn't believe that I'd
		  just <CITE>found</CITE> this book on the shelf. I mean it was so inspirational,
		  very magical, with that energy there. So when I wrote and recorded the song,
		  although it was about nine years later, I was nevertheless psyched up by the
		  book, the image of the boy's father being taken away and locked up by the
		  government just for building a machine to try to make rain. It was such a
		  beautiful book! (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, it does, initially. I write a batch of songs and try to pick the

		  then calling them songs is misleading, because they weren't complete, and I'd
		  normally find that I'd throw lots of ideas down and then, coming back to them
		  in a few days, would see that they weren't as good as they could be, so I would
		  literally just leave them and not finish off the track. And the second side of
		  the album had one and a half tracks rewritten, really, because the flow of the
		  side needed to be changed because the whole nature of it kept changing as
		  things were being put on top of the basics. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's quite interesting going back to them, and I have done, and I'll
		  tend to find little pieces that I think can be re-worked and the rest of it is
		  probably rubbish, so I'll put out the bits that, um... seem re-usable. And
		  though maybe if that isn't used itself, it will then spark off something that
		  can be used again, so they do get recycled sometimes. </DD>

		  <A HREF="../subjects/nature.html">nature</A>. It has its own personality, in a

		<DD> - and occasionally you just get like a riff musically that would

		<DD> I think it's finding the right avenue for the song, and in a way I

		  really, and you have to treat it accordingly - and from the word go the song
		  will then take on an attitude that's maybe completely different from the song
		  next to it on the album. Um... `` The Big Sky'' is an example of a real freak
		  on the album, in that it consistently changed until we got there in the end,
		  and ``Waking the Witch'' on side two was totally written through a guitarist -
		  the electric guitarist. I knew what I wanted, but it wasn't a song that would
		  sound right if it was based around a keyboard. It had to be written through the
		  electric guitar. So the guitarist came in literally working to just a Linn
		  pattern, and I just told him what I wanted, and it was a very different way of
		  writing. I've never done it like that before, but I think it was very
		  successful. (1985, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/im85_tm.html">Tony Myatt

		  can be sparked off by something that already exists and create something quite

		<DD> Yes. It's very important to let others hear it. But more and more it

		  song will sound like it's in pieces until it's in a quite developed stage. The
		  other problem is, if you know you want to change lots of things in the tracks,
		  the chances are that if you let people hear it in an early stage, they will
		  latch onto the whole structure of the song and they can't allow for any
		  differences later. In some ways the most useful ones are at a much later stage

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, I do now. I play around with ideas at home, but most of the
		  writing goes on in here, and that's important, too. Because years ago I'd make
		  demos, and there would be things that I wanted to keep, but of course you
		  can't, because it's a demo. It's the eternal problem. By having your own
		  studio, you can get around that. You can actually make the demos the master,
		  and keep all those little bits that are interesting, but then make the rest
		  sound much better. I work very closely with Del, who engineers for me. So most
		  of the time it's just the two of us in there. He works a lot on the rhythms and
		  things, so at least I'm not totally alone in there. Once the song feels good
		  enough to work on, then you bring musicians in and just sort of layer upon
		  layer. You sort of create the picture, as it were, and just build up the sounds
		  that seem to work for what the song is saying. It feels as though songs have
		  personalities. You can try something on a song and it will just reject it. It
		  doesn't want it. And yet you can tray that on another song and it will work so
		  perfectly. They're all so individual. </DD>
