	 <P> <B> Is it a sort of a bit of a family business, really? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Um, well yes and no. I mean like, kate and I have been
		making music together for years and years, on different levels, you know. But I
		mean, there's always been music in our family. My older brother john, he
		played. And I was in a band with him when I was about thirteen or fourteen.

	 <P> <B> On different album tracks you've featured not only irish musicians
		but also an array of other ethnic sounds. Does this betray a lot of your own
		listening? Are you listening to a lot of pretty far-out stuff, music for
		example of aboriginal, oriental, or comparable ethnic origin, and deliberately
		seeking to integrate that into your own music? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No, I don't think I am really. There was a period when I used to
		  listen to certain ethnic music. But I don't think I was ever really an avid
		  listener. Paddy is much more of an avid listener to ethnic stuff, he listens to
		  it nearly all the time. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Yes, I take ethnic music very seriously and collect the
		instruments and the music. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> And is it then you who's responsible when you add one of those
		instruments to one of kate's tracks, is it you who's conceived of what is
		possible there? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Normally, yes, when it comes to unusual or ethnic
		instruments. Because that is what I am interested in. I come in with the
		suggestion for such and such an instrument. Kate then listens to it in the
		context of the track and if she likes it, it stays; If she doesn't I try and
		find something different. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy, maybe you'd give a quick sketch of your career as a musician
		prior to your involvement with your sister. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Well, I suppose it all started off initially because there's
		always been so much music in our family. Our mother comes from a very musical
		family, all her brothers, I.e. Our uncles, played on accordians and fiddles and
		stuff. So music was something we were always exposed to as young kids and we
		were always hearing irish dance music, which has been very special to me ever
		since. But my initial involvement in music came when I used to play for an
		english morris dance team. I used to play the concertina, and the
		anglo-chromatic concertina. I did that for a very long time and worked for the
		english folk dance and song society. The society's image is one of lady
		dance-teachers sat at pianos with children prancing about. But, basically, at
		that time, it was the only source of broad-spectrum information concerning folk
		music. So I used to play for their morris dance team, not a very big nor a very
		popular team really, but that was where my earliest experience of performing
		came from. We used to work a lot in folk clubs and, at that particular time in
		the sixties, the folk revival was happening in england and out of it came
		several thousand lps that are almost all unavailable and forgotten by now, but
		some of the stuff was just incredible, and that was our source material until I
		started getting involved in irish dance music. It's crazy! I happened to go to
		school, here in england, with a guy called kevin burke, who's considered the
		best fiddler in ireland. I was just walking past this classroom one day, and
		there was this geezer in there doing this absolutely incredible sligo fiddle
		playing. I'd never heard anything like it, I mean, it was a delirious kind of
		music! And then, from all that, my interest in musical instruments just grew
		and grew to the point where I tried to seek an apprenticeship with a musical
		instrument maker, actually with a harp maker at that particular time, 'cause I
		was interested in learning how to play all the things. So I looked for an
		apprenticeship for nearly two years - that would have been when I was between
		about eighteen and twenty - but I couldn't find anybody at all interested in
		taking me on. But then eventually, towards the mid-1970s, I discovered a place
		in london that was offering a course in musical instrument technology, not just
		on one instrument, but on everything. I mean <CITE>literally,</CITE> piano
		tuning, violin making, harpsichord building, keyboards, ethnic musicology with
		jean jenkings, and so on. And it seemed too good an opportunity to miss. So I
		went and studied at this college, the london college of furniture in
		shoreditch, for three years and became a musical instrument technologist
		specializing in mediaeval musical instruments. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> And you were still playing around folk clubs during those years?
		</B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Oh, yes, certainly. Folk music - it's very, very hard to
		give any sort of adequate description of what folk music can <CITE>mean</CITE>
		to you if you're not yourself completely involved in it. It's more like a way
		of life. It can't stop. It's like swimming, once you've learned the art you
		can't go and forget how to do it. You know, somebody goes
		``dum-dee-diddle-dee-dum-dee-da'' (paddy breaks into an irish jig) and you're
		off! It instantly makes sense! If you're born into a tradition of playing some
		particular kind of music, you can branch out into all kinds of
		<CITE>other</CITE> music. But the tradition is something that's always
		<CITE>there</CITE> and just never, never falls apart. So, in my case, the folk
		tradition was constantly <CITE>there.</CITE> but my major interest in
		broad-spectrum musical instruments just grew and grew and grew. And being at
		that college was the perfect place to pursue it... </B></P>
	 <P> <B> So then you came out of that into helping kate? </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Paddy: Well, I struggled by myself for a time as an artist, an
		artist of <A HREF="../subjects/weirdness.html">weirdness</A>. I had a couple of
		exhibitions of some things that I'd made during that time. You see, towards the
		end, my course in musical instrument making became very curious and strange, I
		started making instruments with arms and legs and out of very unorthodox
		materials; And instruments that didn't play and which demonstrated other sorts
		of principles. I had an exhibition at the whitechapel art gallery and sold a
		couple of things, there was a great deal of interest, but not much success!
		Then one day kate said, ``do you want to join the band?'' (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Even from your lionheart album days there's been a noticeable
		interest in unusual instruments: Panpipes, mandocello, strumento da porco,
		sitar, koto, balalaika, harmonica, recorders, and musical saw. </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, that's because Paddy Bush, who has played on my albums, has
		  made a lot of instruments since he studied at the London College of Furniture,
		  specializing in mediaeval instruments. Whenever he finds an instrument that
		  doesn't appear to exist that he likes - he'll make one, and learn to play it.
		  Consequently, it ends up on one of my tracks! </DD>

		<DD> Sounds are very important to me, and I think there are a lot of
		  standard instruments that don't actually sound that emotional or that
		  interesting, which is why it's really nice to have the flavours of these other
		  instruments. In so many cases they are not used any more, and that means people
		  don't recognize them, giving an air of mystery to the music. (1982, <CITE><A
