		<DD> It's beautiful, totally beautiful. There are so many different kinds
		  of landscapes and beauty. It's so wonderful just hanging around the coast and
		  watching it change. It's always dramatic, stepping back into the last century.
		  It has a real sense of magic. And the people are so fantastic, so warm, so
		  wistful. I really do like Ireland a lot. It's one of the few places apart from
		  England where I'd ever think of living. </DD>

		<DD> I think everybody that's English has hesitations. You can't help but
		  be conditioned. It happens everywhere, and I would very much like to go over,
		  and certainly without having experienced - to understand the reality of it and
		  not the illusion that's created by people. </DD>

		<DD> I don't think that's something I want to talk about. You should ask

	 <P> <B> I just wondered what kind of an impression of the relationship

	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Totally by media, and by the IRA - that's what the English person
		  thinks of as soon as you mention Northern Ireland. Definitely, people being
		  bombed and shot, and a very military kind of scene with lots of repression and
		  perhaps the English not being too welcome there. This is the impression that we
		  have. </DD>

	 <P> <B> As a child, were you aware of the border? Were you aware of the

		<DD> My mother's picture of Ireland was of her home, and no further than
		  that - literally. And that is where her heart is. And all her memories and the
		  things she says of home are just beautiful. I think it has definitely affected
		  my attitude toward Ireland. That's why I feel so at home, why I love it so
		  much. I can feel my mother everywhere there. (1985, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> I read somewhere before that you were into irish music. Is it
		traditional stuff, or what? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes, it is that. I just love Irish music. It's so emotional, and
		  passionate. It's very, very happy, and it can be very, very sad. It just does
		  something to me. I guess it's because it's in my blood, as well. My mother's
		  Irish, and as soon as I hear the pipes, you know, I feel my blood surging
		  through my veins. And I think the Bulgarian music has... it moves you. The
		  sense of melody and everything. It feels like very old music, stuff we're not
		  in touch with any more. Probably when music was music, and men were men
		  [<I>Laughing</I>], and the women were very lonely! (1989, <CITE><A

	 <P> <B> Traditional irish instruments are featured throughout the album,
		giving it a more pronounced celtic flavor - more so than any previous kate bush

		<DD> I guess I've always been very intrigued by Irish music. Since I was
		  a little girl it's always been played in our house. My mother's Irish, and my
		  <A HREF="../subjects/family.html">family</A> are very musical. And I think
		  that's probably been the strongest musical influence on me for a start. I love
		  Irish music, and although I think it was never really obvious until the third,
		  fourth album, it's kind of always been in my blood. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> It was in the background, but now it seems more in the foreground.
		Yeah. And we <A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> to actually go to ireland
		when we can, to record them there, because obviously, it's just so much fun
		being in the country with those people. We love the irish. </B></P>
	 <P> <B> It has to add to the atmosphere, too. </B></P>

		<DD> I think so, yes, absolutely. (1989, <CITE><A

		<DD> Irish music holds so much potential for feeling and I really like it
		  the more I get into recording the stuff. The idea of using space is interesting
		  to me. Space and silence, because that's what makes sounds work. (????, AVD)

		<DD> With my mother being Irish, Irish music has a real hold on me. Since
		  I was very little, there was always that type of music being played, so it had
		  a big influence on me. When I was tiny both my brothers used to be playing it
		  all the time at home. When I go to Ireland I feel the blood surge through my
		  veins! We go there quite alot and work with musicians there, so I think the
		  Irish connection is probably the strongest influence. But the other colors come
		  very much from the instruments my brother has, or something heard that was
		  played to me. (1990, <CITE><A
