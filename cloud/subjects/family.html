		<DD> My brothers are very musical, yeah. They were really responsible for
		  turning me on to it in the first place. They were always playing music when I

		<DD> It's [<I>The studio</I>] a bit like home, there's always noise and

		  They haven't got too excited about my success but they're very pleased for me.
		  You have to remember they've been around when I was up in my little room
		  screaming my head off and plonking away at the piano. That seems such a long

		<DD> I'm part of a close family and I suppose I'm very aware of the
		  emotional factors involved. I think families are something that used to be
		  very, very important and now, probably to do with the cities and the race of
		  life, they split up very quickly. It's much more an independent lifestyle. But
		  families are very interesting because it is a structure and from structures all
		  sorts of things can happen. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> You can't beat a close family though, can you, really? I mean a
		close family is like a central point to bounce back to when things are... When
		there's trouble and things like that? </B></P>

	 <P> <B> Would your parents at this stage completely accept this lifestyle,

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I don't know if they wish I had turned out differently. They've
		  never said anything, and I've never asked them. But they are great, and I think
		  they are very happy. They get a lot of pleasure in being involved in it. I
		  think they genuinely enjoy it. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Your family seems to be a very close-knit one. Your brothers are

		<DD> They are, though they're not really involved consistently. But they

		  supportive. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Given the importance of your family and the closeness that's there,

		<DD> That's not something that I can talk about - it's not a desire that
		  I have had yet. My work is totally obsessive. I can't say. I might do. (1985,
