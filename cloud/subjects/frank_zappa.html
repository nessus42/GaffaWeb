	 <P><B> We will close with an artist who has had a long career beginning in
		the late sixties, when lennon as part of the beatles was so popular. I'm
		talking about frank zappa, in those days with the mothers of invention, and in
		the seventies doing a series of bizarre lps on his own. And one of these has
		particularly tickled your fancy. </B></P>

		<DD> Yes. Uh, I think Zappa's great, and one of my favourite albums is
		  <CITE>Bongo Fury,</CITE> where he and Beefheart are together, so we've got two
		  loonies on one album. It's wonderful, so exciting. And the track I've chosen is
		  ``Montana", off of <CITE>Overnight Sensation.</CITE> For me this is one of
		  Zappa's more commercial albums: uh, more instant songs, but at the same time
		  very versatile. I really do hold it as one of my favourite albums. And the
		  track's called ``Montana.'' (1980, <CITE><A
