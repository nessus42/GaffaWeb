		<DD> Well, this is a really beautiful track, and Alan Stivell, um, he's
		  a, a Breton, and from the age of four, as far as we know, he was a, a master
		  harpist, playing the Celtic harp. His father was a master at it, and that's
		  obviously why he learnt so young. As he got older he decided that all the kids
		  in Breton were getting into contemporary music, and didn't realise what
		  beautiful traditional music they had in their own country. So what he wanted to
		  do was present the traditional music in a form that they would love and
		  understand because he felt that it was being forgotten. And it really is
		  beautiful. And it's nice because not only is it the traditional music but he's
		  mixing it with rock. And as far as I'm concerned this track is a tear-jerker,
		  it's so beautiful. </DD>

	 <P> <B> From his album <CITE>from celtic roots</CITE>, here's alan stivell.

	 <P> <B> "The kinead'' by alan stivell. Kate, are you particularly
		interested in celtic music, or here are you just drawn to this artist? </B></P>
	 <P> </P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I think I'm probably drawn to this artist, because it is quite like
		  the music that I was brought up on, which was traditional English-Irish music.
