		<DD> I'm interested in theatre. Films...I really don't know about. I
		  don't consider myself an actress. Unless something came up that I felt I could
		  do, then I wouldn't do it. I have had film offers - like, there's been a couple
		  of vampire films, and a rock musical. That's an obvious one because I'm a
		  singer. But I wouldn't have thought I was a vampire! (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> They were always about the rise of a music personality. You know the
		  sort of thing. It's been done time and time before, so it would be a bit boring
		  if I did it. I like films like <CITE>Time Bandits:</CITE> that was fantastic!

	 <P> <B> Well that's what everyone around the office is saying, for

		english classic. [<I>Kate stifles a laugh</I>] I mean is this something that

		<DD> It's nothing that has ever really been a strong desire for me. I
		  mean, never at any point in my life have I wanted to be an actress. But if
		  there was something offered that was interesting enough, I would certainly want
		  to do it, yes. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> Well, funnily enough, it's not, really. Until quite recently it's
		  something I ever really desired. There's no doubt that if I was offered a part
		  by a director who I admired, that I'm sure I would do it, but it doesn't
		  actually interest me in terms of giving up music to take up a career in acting.
		  It doesn't attract me at all, but I would certainly do if it was one of my
		  favourite directors - and, um... certainly if Donald Sutherland was in it!

	 <P> <B> What sort of role would you like to play if the offer was made?
		Something dramatic? </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> No idea. I certainly wouldn't want to play the part of a rock singer
		  or a pop singer. It would have to be for the challenge of the acting. If the
		  part was something I thought that I could convey well, um... then I certainly
		  would be up for trying it. It's fascinating, the whole process of making films,
		  of suddenly becoming someone, showing feelings that you hadn't been feeling,
		  say, five minutes before. The whole process is extraordinary, fascinating.

		<DD> I don't think I ever wanted to become an actress. Acting is
		  something that I've never had a passion for, or an ambition for. Really,
		  everything so far has stemmed from songwriting for me. (1989, VH-1) I think I'd
		  like to make a little film. Being a movie actress is not something I have
		  craved, but the right thing might tempt me. If there comes a time when I can
		  only manage one album a decade, it would be good to have something else to keep
		  me busy. And anyway, you learn so much just by jumping in at the deep end.
