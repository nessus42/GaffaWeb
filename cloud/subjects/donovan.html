	 <H1> Donovan </H1> 
	 <P><B> Well here's a man who grew popular with his images and his unusual
		voice, 'cause in the selections you played both last time and today I know you
		<A HREF="../subjects/love.html">love</A> the use of the human voice as an
		instrument. The man I'm talking about is Donovan. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yeah, Donovan has got the most beautiful voice - that very slow
		  vibrato that people like Cliff Richard can put on; but [<I>Donovan</I>] has it
		  very naturally. I mean he sings like this all the time. And again, he's an
		  incredible songwriter, lyric writer, he can play the guitar and he has that
		  fantastic voice. And it seemed that he'd got really caught up in the copying of
		  Dylan when he first signed up and was singing. And he was wearing the hats and
		  he was carrying the guitar and everyone thought he was just a Dylan copy. When
		  in fact he wasn't at all. And it seems that he's just been forgotten, he's gone
		  under. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> It's unbelievable. He was one of britain's leading, hit-making solo
		stars of the sixties and a great international artist. And now it's almost as
		though he'd never existed. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> It's ridiculous. I can't stand to see that happen to people,
		  especially someone like him. Um, one of my favourite albums of his is
		  <CITE>H.M.S. Donovan</CITE> - which I think has been deleted now, which is even
		  more ridiculous. And it's beautiful: fantastic illustrated cover; a double
		  album, and each song is either a fairy story or something he's written to other
		  people's words. He's used Blake's poems, he's used some Lewis Carroll - a big
		  selection of fantasy stuff. And one of my favourite tracks from there, which he
		  actually wrote himself to his own music, is ``Lord of the Reedy River." </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> [<I>The record is played. Donovan actually performed this song well
		before recording it for <CITE>h.m.s. Donovan.</CITE> he appears in the 1968
		film <CITE>if</CITE>it's<CITE>tuesday, this must be belgium,</CITE> singing
		this song to his own guitar accompaniment. Of course, kate herself recorded
		this song, and put it out as the b-side of the `` sat in your lap'' single in
		1981. A rumour persists that donovan actually contributed a bit of backing
		vocal on kate's track, though this has not been confirmed.</I>] </B></P>
	 <P> <B> Donovan, and ``lord of the reedy river.'' I suppose-- </B></P>

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> ...so beautiful... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> - All it would take would be one or two really good tracks and -
		</B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Ah, but he's <CITE>got</CITE> them, you know, that's the silly
		  thing, he's got so many good tracks. I think that song there too, is so
		  essential and erotic. And you know no-one's even heard of it - incredible. I
		  mean if you put a bit of film to that... what a fantastic... </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> Most people don't realise that most of his hit records were
		produced by mickie most. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I didn't realise that either, no. </DD>
	 </DL>
	 <P> <B> There's another track of his that you like alot, a b-side. </B></P>
	 <P> </P>
	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. It was the b-side of ``[<I>??? Indecipherable</I>]", called
		  ``Mr. Wind'' [<I>??? I am unsure that this is what she says here</I>]. What I
		  liked about it was he was using ``Vari-Speed", Um, he was using <CITE>very low
		  voices</CITE> and <CITE>very high voices</CITE> [<I>Kate imitates these -
		  precious audio unfortunately not transcribable</I>] all mixed in together:
		  <CITE>Mr. Wind spoke like this!</CITE> And all the people that he woke up in
		  the morning <CITE>spoke like this!</CITE> [<I>Laughs</I>] And it was beautiful;
		  it was just a really fun track putting a different speed to the voices of the
		  various characters. And it was really fabulous for kids you know? I...I wish
		  there had been more. (1980, <CITE><A HREF="unknown_source">BBC</A></CITE>)
