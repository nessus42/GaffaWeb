	 <P><B> When asked if she ever thinks about having children Kate looks
		genuinely perplexed. What an odd question. I've never given it much thought. My
		career takes up so much time that children don't figure yet. I don't see myself
		as maternal. It's nice if you think I am. I like maternal people. (1985,

		<DD> Not at all, I think. Trouble is it takes me so long to do things
		  that I've sorta brought up a backlog of not being able to do the things I want.
		  So it's enjoyable for me to get the album finished and when this promotional
		  work is finished, this means I can launch into the next project. I think I'd
		  always like to be able to make albums, that's something that is very important
		  to me, making music. And apart from that, I think it's experimentation from now
		  on really. </DD>

		<DD> Yes, I'd like to be in a little cottage in the countryside now, I
		  think! I don't think you have to retire to do that. Just makes travelling into
		  London a bit longer. </DD>

	 <P> <B> Is that altogether a healthy thing, you think? </B></P>

	 <DL>
		<DT></DT>
		<DD> I don't know if it's healthy. But, it's certainly very enjoyable. I
		  get a tremendous amount of satisfaction out of actually feeling that I've
		  achieved something. Like finishing an album. or finishing a video. Because it's
		  always so hard when you're stuck in the middle of a project and sometimes
		  you're never sure if you're going to be able to finish it, so to actually reach
		  that point, that relief when the thing is over, it's incredibly rewarding!

		<DD> Mmm...perhaps. SHE CHEWS THOUGHTFULLY ON A DELICATE FINGER. Perhaps
		  not. I suppose I am quite maternal, and it's something I'd like one of these
		  days. A child is probably a lot like contemplating a world tour-mentally and
		  physically exhausting. I'm not sure I'm ready for one yet. I think for now I'll
		  make do with one of my cats, thanks. (1990, <CITE><A
