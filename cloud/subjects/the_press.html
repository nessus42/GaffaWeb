		  wouldn't call it Punk! Sometimes it's not even rock... I don't know, I think
		  it's wrong to put labels on music. Even Punk, that's really just a label for

		  people, being put under labels. I think it's something that shouldn't be

		  one guy didn't like me so much, he had to write four columns of ``I can't stand

		  good for you to realise in some ways that people can say anything they want
		  about you. It shouldn't matter what they say. I think the public are starting
		  to realise the hype in the media manipulation, the propaganda. I pick up papers
		  and read something about someone, and I start believing it, and then I realise,
		  ``God, I'm doing just what other people are doing to me!'' I think journalism
		  could be such an art, and some people treat it as such. Others use it as an

		  wouldn't talk about these areas of my life they turned to the ``wow",
		  ``amazing'' girl, even when I didn't use those words. The few interviews I do,
		  people still seem to dwell on this old ``me", and I find it disappointing when

		<DD> Yes, I do. I think it still is, particularly in this country. But I

		  them, and puked and gobbed at the cameras, but it's not my

		<DT></DT>
		<DD> Yes. There are good people to talk to, they're not always talking
		  about the past, or deliberately trying to make you look like an idiot, and are
		  genuinely interested in my work. But it's like I said, I find it hard to
		  express myself in interviews. It depends how I feel - sometimes they're fun,
		  especially if I know the journalist, and the questions are interesting - they
		  make you think about areas you might not have even considered before. But
		  sometimes I find myself saying things just to please them, or just to give a
		  question an answer. Sometimes I get verbal diarrhoea and just burble complete
		  rubbish, and sometimes I feel so guarded that I invert, and feel like a trapped
		  animal. Quite often I go over an interview in my head afterwards and realise
		  I've said something completely contrary to what I believe, but I put most of it
		  down to being quite a private person, and being someone who likes to think
		  carefully about how I say something. Words are very special things, and are so
		  easily misinterpreted - I much prefer to write lyrics than do an interview. I
		  feel I'm a songwriter, not a personality, and I find it difficult to even talk
		  about my songs, sometimes. In a way, they speak for themselves, and the
		  subjects or inspirations can be so personal, or just seem ridiculous when
		  spoken about. (1987, <CITE><A HREF="../../garden/kate23.html">KBC

		<DD> It's difficult. In interviews I talk complete rubbish most of the

		  thought processes a lot of the time. That's the thing about writing songs. You
		  can think very carefully about what you want to say, but words are such a
		  powerful thing. Our language is beautiful but incredibly ambiguous, isn't it?

		<DD> And for people to completely understand what you mean. You might

		  half the time we don't actually know what the other person meant at all. We
		  think we do, and they think we do, so again it's just continual
