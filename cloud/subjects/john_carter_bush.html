		<DD> John is my brother, the eldest in the family. I have one other
		  brother, Paddy, and no sisters. John took the photographs used on the posters,
		  and they were taken in Holland. (1979, <CITE><A

		<DD> I'm very close to him. He is an inspiration. Being my brother he is
		  someone I can always talk to... what worries me is that sometimes Jay is
		  portrayed as a Svengali who is black and evil. And he's not at all. He's very
		  beautiful and sensitive and I love him very much. (????, SH) </DD>

	 <P> <B> There's some curiosity about your family's contribution to the
		sensual world. could you tell us about their role? </B></P>

		<DD> I suppose what's really great is that I'm surrounded by very
		  talented people who are related to me, and they're really close friends.
		  Obviously John's photographs are really good, and that's why I work with him.
		  He's a great photographer, and because we know each other so well, it's such a
		  relaxed atmosphere. (1989, <CITE><A HREF="../../reaching/ir89_us.html">Reaching

	 <P> <B> Your brother paddy bush plays numerous instruments in the sensual

		Your other brother john carder bush did the cover photos and that's just like
