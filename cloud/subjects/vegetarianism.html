	 <P><B> If vegetarians are against the killing of animals for food, why
		don't they object to them being killed for leather? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I think there are a lot of vegetarians who are against animals being
		  killed to make leather, and they do go out of their way to wear rubber and
		  plastic shoes and belts, but I think that there is a practical side to it, as
		  well. Leather is very warm, and it's nice to look at, but it does require a lot
		  of effort for most of us to make a different choice from the normal, and I find
		  myself that I do wear quite a few leather shoes. Not that I consciously buy
		  them because they're made of leather, but I do have a few, and I think it's
		  something to do with the tradition of leather being used in clothing. But
		  there's no excuse for the mass production of leather, and I think it comes down
		  to effort and how far you really want to go. It's up to you in the long run.

	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> You are a vegetarian and yet you wear fur coats. Why? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I don't wear fur coats. I haven't got one. I don't own one and I
		  don't believe in wearing them - I may have occasionally been in photos with
		  one, but it wouldn't have been mine. It would have been one that I'd borrowed
		  because it was very cold; for instance in Switzerland, when I did the Abba
		  special. [<I>In fact, as far as I know, that was the only time kate has ever
		  been seen in a fur. - ied</I>] But I don't believe in people wearing fur coats,
		  I think it's very extravagant and again, I think people don't tend to associate
		  the clothes with the animals they come from, especially the rare animals that
		  some of the coats are made of. You can get incredibly good imitation ones now -
		  I've seen ones that I thought were real fur and they weren't. They're really
		  fantastic, and they cost less, too. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Do you follow vegetarian recipes from books, or do you make up your
		own? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I do follow recipes from books, but I find that normally I don't
		  stick to them, especially if I haven't got all the ingredients, and I tend to
		  substitute different vegetables. If I'm feeling really brave, occasionally I
		  base a meal on a recipe and make the rest up. Cooking is quite a logical thing,
		  really, and you soon learn the things that go together - what works and what
		  doesn't. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> You say in interviews that you don't eat meat because you don't
		believe in eating life. But you eat plants, and they are living things. Why?
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> I do eat plants, and I know they're living, and I'm fond of them,
		  but I think you have to find your own level. I could live on pills, but I don't
		  think it's very human to do that - that is something we dream of in the space
		  age: food without texture or mass. I don't think plants mind being eaten,
		  actually. I think they'd be really sad if no-one paid that much attention to
		  them. I appreciate them very much for the things they give me. I'd be very sad
		  if there weren't any vegetables, and normally it isn't the actual plant that's
		  killed - it's the fruit or vegetable that's taken off. I think this is the
		  purpose of plants, that they grow to be eaten. The only problem is that it has
		  become a very mass-produced market, again, and that the really natural,
		  unchemicalised environment doesn't really exist. Too many chemicals are used on
		  plants, but while there is a demand for brightly coloured food in pretty
		  packets, that's how it will carry on. But you can get fresh, organically grown
		  vegetables. You can grow them yourselves, and if you look around and ask,
		  you'll find that there are a few shops and some local farms that sell
		  vegetables that have not been grown in chemically fertilised ground. (1980,

		<DD> People probably eat so much pre-packaged food because it's always so
		  easy to get in shops, and they don't connect it with live animals. If they
		  actually had to kill the animal themselves, they would probably have great
		  difficulty in doing it. People who live and work with animals can be aware of
		  what they are doing when they kill an animal. They realise that they're going
		  to be eating it, rather than it being sent off to be sold in supermarkets. On
		  some levels this seems to be all right, because it's on a one-to-one basis: you
		  feed and look after the animal for a certain length of time and then it repays
		  you by becoming your food. But it's the mass-production of living creatures
		  just to be eaten, and the fact that people aren't really aware of what they're
		  eating, that I don't like. </DD>

		<DD> These days it seems more and more probable that fish are likely to
		  contain pollution - which can't do you any good - as they have no choice but to
		  eat all the muck that's in the water. But hopefully people's general awareness
		  is getting much better, even down to buying a pint of milk: the fact that the
		  calves are actually killed so that the milk doesn't go to them but to us can't
		  really be right, and if you've seen a cow in a state of extreme distress
		  because it can't understand why its calf isn't by it, it can make you think a
		  lot. </DD>

		<DD> Working in London, I often have to go past meat markets, and when I
		  see all those people working in there with blood all over them, and dead
		  animals strung up from meat-hooks, just waiting to be devoured, it's like
		  something out of a horror film. When I realised that, I didn't want to eat meat
		  any more. I became more conscious about the things that I did eat. I think this
		  helped me to learn more about food, because I had to start thinking what the
		  nutritional value of something was, and I'm still learning about things I
		  didn't think I could eat, which is really good. Just the discipline of not
		  eating meat is a very good thing. It's like giving up anything you like - it
		  hurts at first, but then you feel much better for it. I don't know whether it
		  was just me, but when I first became a vegetarian I was really hungry a lot of
		  the time, but I'm not now, and I wonder if that's because my stomach has
		  adjusted. When you eat meat, you do ten to eat more than you need, and the body
		  has to work a lot to break it all down. </DD>

		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's interesting how the traveling that I've done reveals things
		  about people's diets. In many European countries it's very hard to get
		  something that hasn't got meat in it. There was one instance in Germany where I
		  asked for a bowl of tomato soup and, having been assured that it contained just
		  tomatoes, I tucked into it. But about halfway through the soup I could see all
		  these lumps floating around at the bottom, and of course they were all
		  meatballs. They just naturally do things like putting bacon and meatballs into
		  vegetable soup, without even thinking about it. So many shops are
		  meat-oriented: it's all sausages and pies, and the only other things you can
		  really get are just potatoes and salads, when there is such an enormous variety
		  of non-animal foods that can be eaten. Looking forward to a breakfast of toast
		  and marmalade, and then getting a couple of slabs of cold meat and white bread
		  pushed under your nose, isn't the way I like to start my day. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Japan seemed to be more vegetable-oriented. They take great pride in
		  their vegetables, although they're greatly into fish, and this is causing them
		  and the dolphins a lot of problems. I found Australia very meat-oriented, too,
		  and this might have something to do with it being such a young country, and
		  it's true that meat does give you a lot of energy. I suppose there was a time
		  when a slab of bacon fat for breakfast might have been necessary for somebody
		  working in a heavy manual job. But I've found that if I keep an eye on the sort
		  of vegetarian food that I eat, I don't have any problems about dancing and
		  singing on it. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It all comes down to looking more closely at the sort of food you
		  are just used to having and saying to yourself, Do I really need to eat this,
		  or is there something that will be better for me? The more people who get into
		  good vegetarian food, the easier it will be for us. If I go into a restaurant
		  with friends, and they settle down to a feast of meat and sauces and so on, I
		  usually end up with salad and chips - which is OK, but that's about as far as
		  most restaurants can go in the direction of vegetarian food. (1980, <CITE><A

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> No, I haven't. It's about five years now. </DD>

	 <P> <B> And what made you decide in the first place? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, I think ever since I've been quite young I've always felt, not
		  bad, but a bit guilty about eating meat because the fact that animals are
		  killed and in a lot of cases in a very necessary way, you know, where it's a
		  big exploitation of animals. And one day I just had this feeling and tried to a
		  bit of meat and this feeling - it was so raw that I just identified immediately
		  with the fact that it was an animal. That this thing was alive and it had been
		  killed for me to eat it and I thought, ``no, I'm not into this.'' So I thought
		  I'd become a vegetarian. And I didn't have a clue, I had no idea what I could
		  eat all I knew was that people didn't eat meat or fish. And I used to eat a lot
		  of chocolate, so I lived for the next week off chocolate and tea. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Well that's not very good... </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, no. This is what I thought so eventually through meeting other
		  friends that were vegetarians and books and things I managed to get a diet
		  together. And it's fantastic, because when I ate meat I wouldn't touch
		  vegetables, I hated them. But since I've become vegetarian I'll eat really only
		  vegetables, you know. So it's really broadened my diet. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Now, in front of us here you've got some of your favorite

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, it is really. My sister-in-law in fact cooked this. She's made
		  a selection of salads, but probably what I'd do is just put it all in one, just
		  make a big salad. But it is what I wold cook. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Let's have a look at this one first. This is vegetable, what sort

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, you've got carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes, onion, and peppers.

	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> And they're just sorta cooked in their own juices. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, she did them just naturally. Home cooked them all. She even

	 <P> <B> That's going to be served with it? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Brown rice. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> And how do you cook the brown rice? </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> It's very easy, really, you just boil it in water and salt.
		</B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT>

	 <P> <B> Now, this here, what's this mixture because this really does look

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well, that's roasted sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and they're in
		  soy sauce. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> I see. So it's a little bit of soy sauce just to give them a
		flavor, and roast them. And how do you eat them. </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Well you just kinda like just sprinkle them over salads, which is

	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> I see. </B></P> 
	 <P> <B> But in fact it's quite nice by itself. It makes you feel a little

		</B></P> 
	 <P> <B> And this here? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> That's yogurt with cucumber, and chives on top, and it's got garlic

	 <P> <B> And what would you serve that with? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P>

	 <DL>

	 <P> <B> And does that go with the fruit salad, or...? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yes, it does. You could use it separately, but it's obviously

	 <P> <B> What have you got in your fruit salad? </B></P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL>

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yeah! </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> And you've got some nice hazel nuts in there that have been soaking

	 <P> </P> 
	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> Yeah, I think it's very good to put nuts in fruit salads, before you
		  put them in cakes. They are things that I think people miss out because they
		  think nuts in chocolate - or, you know, there's a very selective area where you
		  can use nuts, and I think you can put them in anything. </DD> 
	 </DL>

		<DD> No, I don't eat fish. But I eat dairy products, yeah. So I'm not a

	 <P> <B> Yeah, that's really heavy duty... </B></P>

		<DD> Yes, that's very strict. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Cause in this business, and it's a business after all that you're
		in when you're traveling and touring and you're busy, it's very difficult to
		maintain a disciplined diet, cause you have to kinda eat when you can, what you
		can. </B></P>

	 <DL> 
		<DT></DT> 
		<DD> It's really difficult, yeah, it really is. I think that's why most
		  people that become vegetarians in this business tend to go... they tend to
		  revert back to eating meat because it's so much easier, they can't find good
		  vegetarian food. </DD> 
	 </DL> 
	 <P> <B> Maybe if there was vegetarian fast food available people might be

		  rubbish. (1982, <CITE>Unknown BBC interview</CITE>) </DD>

		<DD> Once, that would have been impossible for me. But later I decided we

		  it's so obviously bad for us, but we gaily carry on. I've cut down a but I
