		<DD> No, I don't at all. In fact now I feel a lot more worried about how

	 <P> <B> You suffered a fate in the early goings of your career of being

		<DD> I think what worried me was that it was going to stop people taking

		  of my music. Its not that, um... I find that so much of a problem as...as if

		<DD> Well I think that's something I find very confusing because I think
		  that the essence of all art is sensuality. And sexuality, I mean I don't
		  suppose I understand it fully, but I always tend to think that that's something
		  that's projected. And that sensuality is really were art is at. It's a much
		  more subtle form of expression. (1985, <CITE><A

		<DD> It's not such an open thing for women to be physically attracted to
