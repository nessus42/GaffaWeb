	 <H1>Introduction</H1> 
	 <P>Often when one becomes interested in a new artist it is difficult to
		find accurate information about them or their music. You have to wade through
		many articles and books full of other people's interpretations, which are often
		written by people who don't particulary care about that artist. This is
		something that Kate Bush often complains about. This is an attempt to gather
		some of the most important statements made by Kate and let her words speak for
		herself. Diehard Kate fans will be familiar with many of the quotes here, but
		even they may find it revealing to see many of Kate's comments on a subject
		grouped together. It is my hope that this document will help ``bust through the
		clouds'' created by others and lead to a greater understanding of Kate and her
		music.</P> 
	 <P> Each quote from Kate is followed by the year of the quote (to give
		perspective) and then by the name and date of the magazine, television, or
		radio show where the quote was made. The sources of quotes are listed in the
		Part IV: Sources. Some of the quotes are from books which themselves quote
		other sources without giving credit. In these and other cases where the year in
		not known to me, the year is given as `????'. If the date is an educated guess,
		it is given as ``C.Date''. When a line is printed in <B>bold</B> (or capital
		letters on ASCII text versions), this is either a question asked of Kate or a
		comment to explain the circumstances of the quote. Text [<I>like this</I>] is a
		comment from myself or Andrew Marvick (IED). Kate's song titles are in
		quotation marks and <CITE>italicised</CITE>. Quotes that are new to this
		version have a <IMG SRC="xbm/new.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> at the beginning
		of the line. </P> 
	 <P> Some of the quotes are imcomplete, usually due to a word not being
		audible in a television or radio interview. These quotes are marked [<I>???
		inaudible</I>] or [<I>??? best guess of words</I>]. </P> 
	 <P> Even though these are all Kate's words, it is important to note that,
		like everybody else, sometimes her feelings change, and that sometimes she says
		things she didn't really mean. Looking at some of the entries you can see her
		opinions shift over the years, so it's important to keep in mind the year of
		the quote. Also, since the quotes are rearranged into a different format from
		when they were originally spoken, it is possible that something might be
		slightly out of context. I have done my best to prevent this, sometimes at the
		cost of making the quotes repetitive. Also note that, though these are all
		Kate's words, this is in no way to be considered an official or sanctioned
		document. </P> 
	 <P> I have also included a few quotes from people very close to Kate's.
		These are usually given only when they touch upon a subject that Kate herself
		has not touched on and more detailed quotes can be found in back issues of the
		Kate Bush Club, which are reprinted in The Garden. </P> 
	 <P> The first Part is dedicated to Kate's music. This is, of course, the
		most important part, as we know her through her music. The second Part is
		dedicated to Kate's Story, and the third Part is dedicated to miscellaneous
		Subjects, such as people, places, things, ideas, etc. </P>
