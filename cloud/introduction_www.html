	 <H1> Introduction to WWW version of Cloudbusting </H1>

</PRE> 
	 <P><A HREF="index.html">Cloudbusting</A> is <A HREF="ron_hill.html">Ron
		Hill</A>'s project to produce an encyclopaenia of Kate Bush quotes about her
		music and other subjects. Two editions have been released in a variety of
		formats. This hypertext version was created from the ascii version of the
		second edition by Richard Caley.</P> 
	 <P> Because of the use of capitalisation to represent bold text in the
		ascii version, there are some punctuation and capitalisation problems. Because
		some of the text was written by me (rjc) there are some spelling problems.</P> 
	 <P> Every now and again some utterance will be displayed as if it were
		spoken by the interviewer when it is really Kate. Again this is due to the lack
		of intelligence in the conversion.</P> 
	 <P> If you spot any of these problems, please feel free to fix them. See
		<A HREF="#cbml">below</A> for a description of how best to do this.</P> 
	 <P> </P> 
	 <H2> Sound and Fury </H2> 
	 <P>Where I have got around to it, I have included pointers to lyric sheets
		and short exerpts of the songs. Such pointers look like this: </P>

	 <H2><A NAME="cbml"> CBML </A></H2> 
	 <P>The actual text of the entries in the <A HREF="music.html">music</A>,
		<A HREF="story.html">story</A> and <A HREF="subjects.html">subjects</A>
		sections is maintained in a sort-of SGML markup format more useful for
		interviews than html. I have called this <TT>CBML</TT> for `cloudbusting markup
		language'. If you would like to fix typos or formatting problems etc. in some
		entry, please get the cbml version by clicking on the <A HREF="#cbml"><IMG
		ALIGN="top" ALT="CBML" SRC="xbm/cbml.gif" WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="13"></A> link at
		the bottom of the entry, fix that and mail it to <A
		HREF="richard_caley.html">me</A>.</P> 
	 <P> The format should be pretty self explanitory if you know what HTML
		looks like. </P> 
	 <P> An interview in <TT>CBML</TT> looks something like this: </P> 
	 <PRE>
	&lt;interview&gt;
	&lt;turn interviewer&gt;
		What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?
	&lt;/turn interviewer&gt;
	&lt;turn kate&gt;
		Forty two.
	&lt;/turn kate&gt;
	&lt;/interview&gt;
</PRE> 
	 <H2> Things to Come </H2> 
	 <P>The following things still need to be done. </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> Lots of typos and conversion errors need to be fixed. </LI> 
		<LI> More lyrics and samples need to be included. </LI> 
		<LI> I want to have images of the covers of each album and single. </LI> 
		<LI> The images from version 2 cloudbusting should be here. I can't find
		  usable versions. </LI> 
		<LI> The cross references were put in automatically. This means they're
		  not as inteligently placed as I'd like and sometimes an obvious one is missed.
