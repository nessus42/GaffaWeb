If you want to download all of this hyertext version of Cloudbusting,
use the button at the bottom of this page. You will receive a `zip'
file which contains a complete image of my hyper_cloud
directory. Before doing that, here are some points to note.

<h2>What You Would Need to Duplicate This Server</h2>

`hyper_cloud' was put together on a unix system with an http demon
configured to allow scripts to be run if they are given names ending
in <samp>.cgi</samp>. The search code and mail sending code is written
in the perl language. There may be some path names mentioned in it
somewhere, though I have tried to avoid that.

<h2>Format</h2>

I maintain hyper_cloud in an SGML-like markup called, unimaginatively
`cbml'. This has markup for interviews and turns, citations etc. This
is converted into HTML by the program cbml2html.prl in the top level
directory. examples of the ise of this script are

<dl><dt><dd>
	<kbd>perl cbml2html.prl the_fog.cbml</kbd><br>
	<kbd>perl cbml2html.prl *.cbml</kbd>
</dl>

If you want to fix anything in the interviews, it's best to fix the
<samp>.cbml</samp> file and convert it. If you do this, please mail me
the result.

<h2>Things to Note</h2>

The only problem I can think of which you might have is that
hyper_cloud uses long file names
(e.g. <samp>the_kick_inside_album.cbml</samp>) so you may need to do
something special on horrid systems with file name length limits
(e.g. PCs and some brain-dead unixes). I don't know what you may need
to do on youre system to get around this.

If you work out how to set things up on a specific setup or if you
have any other problems, <a href="mail.html">let me know</a> and I'll
include your experiences here.

<h2>Size</h2>

The zip file is abour 6 Megabytes, unpacked the result is just under
10 (much of this is audio samples and images).

<h2>Here is the Button</h2>

<form method=GET action="hyper_cloud.zip">
