Someone, somehow has got hold of one of Kate's early (circa 1973) demo tapes, 
which appears to have contained not only a number of Kate's early songs, but 
embryonic versions of more well-known tracks. A West German company appeared  to
believe that it had bought the 'rights' to this tape and was set to issue an
album  entitled:&quot;Kate Bush:The Early Years&quot;. EMI-Electrola in Germany
were aware of this,  but some reason took no action to prevent the release. The
album was in fact  pressed and white labels send out in an attempt to secure
overseas distribution deals.  At this point Kate became aware of the proposed
release, and feeling that her early  mistakes are not fit for public
consumption, took the appropriate legal action.
