<h4><center>        (Incorporating *When You Wish Upon A Star)
</h4></center>

<center>
It's been such a long week,<br>
So much crying.<br>
I no longer see a future.<br>
I've been told, when I get older<br>
That I'll understand it all,<br>
But I'm not sure if I want to.<p>

Running into her arms,<br>
At the school gates<br>
She whispers that I'm a poor kid,<br>
And granny takes me on her knee,<br>
She tells me I'm too sensitive,<br>
She makes me sad.<br>
She makes me feel like an old man.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

They took the game right out of it,<br>
They took the game right out of it.<p>

When, When I am a man,<br>
I will be an astronaut,<br>
And find Peter Pan,<br>
Second Star on the right<br>
Straight on 'til morning.<p>

Dennis loves to look in the mirror,<br>
He tells me that he is beautiful,<br>
So I look too, and what Do I see?<br>
My eyes are full,<br>
But my face is empty.<br>
He's got a photo,<br>
Of his hero,<br>
He keeps it under his pillow,<br>
But I've got a pin-up from a newspaper,<br>
Of Peter Pan.<br>
I found it in a locket, I hide it in my pocket.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

* When you wish upon a star,<br>
Makes no difference who you are.<br>
When you wish upon a star,<br>
Your dreams come true.<p>
