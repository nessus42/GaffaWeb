Somewhere a door is opening<br>
Somewhere a door is closing<br>
Somewhere somebody dies<br>
Somewhere a newborn baby cries<p>

Maybe the love has gone, but there's<br>
Still a heart that's beating<br>
Though the clouds have come<br>
Maybe the sun will come out<br>
The storm is coming back<br>
Maybe you'll be coming back<br>
'Coz I'm still waiting<p>

Baby well I'm still waiting<br>
Baby well I'm still waiting<p>

Somewhere a door is opening<br>
Maybe the love has gone but there's still<br>
A heart that's beating<br>
Though the clouds have come<br>
Maybe the sun will come out<br>
Maybe you'll be coming back<br>
'Coz there's still a heart that's beating<p>

Though the clouds have come<br>
Maybe the sun will come out<br>
Maybe you'll be coming back<br>
There's still a heart that's beating<br>
Maybe the sun will come out<br>
They say the storm will be coming back<br>
Maybe you'll be coming back<br>
'Coz I'm still waiting<br>
I'm still waiting<br>
Ooh I'm waiting<p>
