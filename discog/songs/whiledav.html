I stayed the night in your arms.<br>
Over half an hour I stayed awake,<br>
     Looking at you.<p>

Your face seemed radiant.<br>
The walls --------------,<br>
     As I held you.<p>

     Oo-ooh...<p>

     And while a-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Davy dozed.<br>
     I closed my eyes, realised<br>
     The time was close for us to go.<br>
     Hold me, oh hold me.<p>

          Davy, Davy,<br>
          Bending like a willow-branch.<br>
          He rocks me like a baby.<p>

     Oo-ooh...<p>

I know he loves another lady,<br>
But I still see him in the hallway<br>
     Calling me.<p>

Oh, when we danced so closely,<br>
I really felt as though I was melting<br>
     In a pool.<p>

     Oo-ooh...<p>

     Oh, while-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Davey dozed,<br>
     I closed my eyes, realised<br>
     The time was close for us to go.<br>
     Hold me, oh hold me.<p>

          Davy, Davy,<br>
          Bending like a willow-branch.<br>
          He rocks me like a baby.<p>
