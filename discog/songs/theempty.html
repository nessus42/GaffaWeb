Disappears through window<br>
Out of my mind trying to keep him at home<br>
Out into Rome in the early hours<br>
Leaving me here like Tamlain in her Tower<br>
You are going to the Empty Bullring<br>
Taking your red cloak to regain something<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Ooh you Rolling Matador<br>
Kill in your eyes for the Tauro<br>
That shut the door<br>
To Glory and gore<br>
The throw of the Rose<br>
It's all you lived for<br>
But you've lost it all<p>

Your Red streak on the plot where many feet<br>
Left in incomplete<br>
But you kept the meaning<br>
You feel him charge again<br>
And you feel him cut you down<br>
Right on the spot<br>
Where you thought you were ground for good<br>
These fights of fantasy<br>
Make your wounds more sore<br>
But you've every right<br>
To even grab at the last straw<br>
Oh Lord<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
