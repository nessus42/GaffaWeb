</H2>

<center>
She knows that I've been doing something wrong<br>
But she won't say anything.<br>
She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday<br>
But she won't mind me lying<br>
Mmh because:-<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Mother stands for comfort<br>
Mother will hide the murderer.<p>

It breaks the cage, fear escapes and takes possession<br>
Just like a crowd rioting inside -<br>
Make me do this, make me do that, make me do this,<br>
Make me do that -<br>
Am I the cat that takes the bird?,<br>
To her the hunted, not the hunter.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Mother stands for comfort<br>
Mother will hide the murderer.<br>
Mother hides the madman<br>
Mother will stay Mum<p>
</center>
