<center>
When rainy nights are soft with tears<br>
And Autumn leaves are falling<br>
I hear his voice on tumbling waves<br>
And no one there to hold me<p>

At evening's fall he watched me walk<br>
His heart was mine<br>
But my love was young and felt<br>
The world was not cruel but kind<p>

Where Lagan's light fell on the hour<br>
I saw him far below me<br>
Just as the morning calmed the storm<br>
With no one there to hold him<p>

My loves have come, my love's gone<br>
And nothing left to warm me<br>
Save for a voice on the travelling wind<br>
And the glimpse of a face at morning<p>
</center>
