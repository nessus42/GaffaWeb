One more step to the top of the city<br>
Where just a couple of pigeons are living<br>
Up on the angel's shoulders<p>

I don't know if I'm closer to Heaven but<br>
It looks like Hell down there<br>
These streets have never been paved with gold<br>
Welcome to the loneliest city in the world<br>
It's no good for you baby<br>
It's no good for you now<br>
Keep looking up for the ladder<p>

  I don't know if you'll love me for it<br>
  But I don't think we should suffer this<br>
  There's just one thing we can do about it<p>
 
    Take me up to the top of the city<br>
    Take me up to the top of the city<br>
    Take me up to the top of the city<br>
    And put me up on the angel's shoulders<p>

See how that building there is nearly built<br>
There's a big fire over on the north of the city<br>
I see you walking down the street with her<br>
I see your lights going on and off<br>
She's no good for you baby<br>
She's no good for you now<br>
Look I'm here with the ladder<p>

  I don't know if you love me or not<br>
  But I don't think we should ever suffer<br>
  There's just one thing we can do about this<p>
 
    Take me up to the top of the city<br>
    Take me up to the top of the city<br>
    Up to the highest point of the city<br>
    One more step to the top of the city<br>
    Put me up on the angel's shoulders<p>

And I don't mind if it's dangerous<br>
I don't mind if it's raining<br>
Take me up to the top of the city<p>

    And put me up on the angel's shoulders<br>
    Take me up to the top of the city<br>
    Mmm yes, one more step to the top of the city<br>
    And put me up on the angel's shoulders<p>
