</H2>

<center>
We take all the telescopes<br>
And we turn them inside out<br>
And we point them away from the big sky<br>
Put your eye right up to the glass, now<br>
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart<p>

    Steer your life by these stars<br>
    On the unconditional chance<br>
    'Tis here where Hell and Heaven dance<br>
    This is the constellation of the heart<p>

We take all the telescopes<br>
And we turn them inside out<br>
And we point them away from the big sky<br>
Put your eye right up to the glass, now<br>
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart<p>

    The constellation of the heart<br>
    The constellation of the heart<p>

We take all the telescopes<br>
And we turn them inside out<br>
And we point them away from the big sky<br>
Put your eye right up to the glass, now<br>
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart<p>

    The constellation of the heart<br>
    The constellation of the heart<p>

Well we think you'd better wake up capt'n<br>
There's something happen'n up ahead<br>
We've never seen anything like it<br>
We've never seen anything like it before<br>
    I want a full report<br>
That's it<br>
    What do you mean, "That's it?"<br>
That's all you get<br>
You'd better do something 'bout it<br>
    What am I supposed to do about it?<br>
We don't know, but you can't run away from it<br>
Maybe you'd better face it<br>
    I can't do that<br>
C'mon face it!<br>
    I can't do that<br>
C'mon, c'mon face it<br>
    What am I gonna do?<br>
    It is gonna hurt, it is gonna hurt me bad?<p>
   
    Ooh here's the constellation of the heart<p>

Who said anything about it hurting?<br>
It's gonna be beautiful<br>
It's gonna be wonderful<br>
It's gonna be paradise<p>

    (Just being alive, it can really hurt...)<br>
    Ooh find me the man with the ladder<br>
    And he might lift me up to the stars<p>
   
    (Without the pain there'd be no learning<br>
    Without the hurting we'd never change.)<p>
   
    Oooh and if you see the woman with the key<br>
    I hear she's opening up the doors to Heaven<br>
    Oh and here comes the man with the stick<br>
    He said he'd fish me out of hte moon<p>
   
    Ohoh here's the constellation of the heart<br>
    It is the constellation of the heart<p>
   
    Oh yes it is the constellation of the heart<p>
