<center>
With my ego in my gut<br>
My babbling mouth would wash it up.<br>
	(But now I've started learning how)<br>
		I keep it shut.<br>
My door was never locked<br>
Until one day a trigger come - cocking.<br>
	(But now I've started learning how)<br>
		I keep it shut.<br>
Wide eyes would clean and dust<br>
Things that decay, things that rust.<br>
	(But now I've started learning how)<br>
		I keep them shut<br>
		I keep them shut.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><br>
	Harm is in us,<br>
	Harm in us but power to arm.<br>
	Harm is in us,<br>
	Harm in us but power to arm.<p>

Narrow mind would persecute it,<br>
Die a little to get to it.<br>
	(But now I've started learning how)<br>
		I leave it open<br>
I kept it in a cage,<br>
Watched it weeping, but I made it stay<br>
	(But now I've started learning how)<br>
		I leave it open<br>
		I leave it open<p>

<i>Chorus </i><br>
	Harm is in us,<br>
	Harm in us but power to arm.<br>
	Harm is in us,<br>
	Harm in us but power to arm.<br>
	Harm is in us,<br>
	Harm is in us<br>
	Harm in you and me<p>
	
	What you letting in?<br>
	Tell me what your letting in<br>
	Say what we're gonna let in<p>
