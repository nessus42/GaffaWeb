<center>
Just traveling on a bus<br>
From a friend's house,<br>
And all these people are looking at me.<br>
They're gazing out windows,<br>
At any English country garden.<p>

But as gazes meet,<br>
Vacancy shows onscreen.<br>
But I feel inside<br>
The latent hysteria:<br>
"Why is she looking at me?"<p>

     And as I drift from one to one I can see<br>
     They're all like me.<br>
     They've all got frightened eyes<br>
     Saying what they're thinking,<br>
     What they are doing tonight.<br>
     They've all got frightened eyes,<br>
     Saying, "Leave me alone,<br>
     I'm perfectly safe here inside.<br>
     Please don't surprise me."<p>

Expressionless.<br>
Everyone here loves cheap wine--<br>
We all know good taste,<br>
We just get too busy trying to find<br>
The right games to play.<p>

Impatient, aren't we all?<br>
Watching the time trip by.<br>
And all these people are looking at me.<br>
They're gazing out windows.<br>
They're burning out in there.<p>

     And as I drift from one to one I can see<br>
     They're all like me.<br>
     They've all got frightened eyes<br>
     Saying what they're thinking,<br>
     What they are doing tonight.<br>
     They've all got frightened eyes,<br>
     Saying, "Leave me alone,<br>
     I'm perfectly safe here inside.<br>
     Please don't surprise me."<p>
