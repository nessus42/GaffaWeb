There's beauty in such a sacred structure,<br>
That thing that is nurtured and loved.<br>
It's quite an occasion.<br>
It's driving me crazy.<br>
I'm not allowed to touch unless<br>
I've gotta get a hold of myself.<br>
I must-----doo-doo-doo-doo-doo...<p>

     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't<br>
          Pick the rare flower.<p>

     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't<br>
          Pick the rare flower.<p>

Walking in a Paradise or Eden,<br>
Oh, temptation:<br>
Give me one second to succumb.<br>
It's calling me.<br>
with a magazine whisper.<br>
Magical word telling me<br>
I've gotta get a hold of myself,<br>
You see, but it ain't easy.<p>

     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't<br>
          Pick the rare flower.<p>

     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't,<br>
     I don't see why I shouldn't<br>
          Pick the rare flower.<p>
