<center>
You'll find me in a Berlin bar<br>
In a corner, brooding<br>
You know that I go very quiet<br>
When I am listening to you<br>
There's something special indeed<br>
In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy<br>
There's something very real in how I feel, honey<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

It's in me, it's in me - and you know it's for real<br>
Tuning in your saxophone<br>
Doo-ba-doo-ba-doo<p>

The candle burning over your shoulder<br>
Is throwing shadows on your saxophone<br>
A surly lady in tremor<br>
The stars that climb from her bowels<br>
Those stars make towers on vowels<br>
You'll never know that you had all of me<br>
You'll never see the poetry you've stirred in me<br>
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly<br>
I've never known or felt, in myself, so rightly<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
