<center>
Oh big stripey lie moving<br>
Like a wavy line<br>
Coming up behind<p>

All young gentle dreams drowning<br>
In life's grief<br>
Can you hang on me?<p>

    Don't want to hurt you baby<br>
    I only want to help you<br>
    I could be good for you<p>

Your name is being called by sacred things<br>
That are not addressed nor listened to<br>
Sometimes they blow trumpets<p>

    Only want to help you<br>
    Never want to hurt you<br>
    I know I could be good for you<p>

Oh my God it's a jungle in here<br>
You've got wild animals loose in here<p>

    Want to help you<br>
    Never hurt you<br>
    Good for you<p>

Hey all you little waves run away<br>
Mmm run away<p>
