<center>
Soon it will be the phase of the moon<br>
When people tune in<br>
Every girl knows about the punctual blues<br>
But who's to know the power <br>
Behind our moves<p>

A day of coincidence with the radio<br>
And a word that won't go away<br>
We know what they're all going to say<br>
&quot;G&quot; arrives, funny, had a feeling he was on his way<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

We raise our hats to the strange phenomena<br>
Soul birds of a feather flock together<br>
We raise our hats to the hand a-moulding us<br>
Sure 'nuf - he has the answer<br>
He has the answer<br>
Om mani padme hum.<p>

You pick up a paper, you read a name<br>
You go out, it turns up again and again<br>
You bump into a friend you haven't seen<br>
For a long time<br>
Then into another you only thought about last night<p>

You hear your sister calling for you<br>
But you don't know where from<br>
You know there's something wrong<br>
But you don't want to believe in a premonition<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
