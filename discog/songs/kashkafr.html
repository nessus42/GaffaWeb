<center>
Kashka from Baghdad lives in sin they say,<br>
With another man,<br>
But no-one knows who.<p>

Old friends never call there,<br>
Some wonder if life's inside at all,<br>
If there's life inside at all.<br>
But we know the lady who rents the room,<br>
She catches them Õ la lune.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

At night they're seen,<br>
Laughing, loving,<br>
They know the way<br>
To be happy.<p>

They never go for walks,<br>
Maybe it's because the moon's not bright enough,<br>
There's light in love you see.<br>
I watch their shadows,<br>
Tall and slim in the window opposite,<br>
I long to be with them.<br>
'Coz when all the alley-cats come out,<br>
You can hear music from Kashka's house.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
