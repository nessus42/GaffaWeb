<center>
Out in the garden, there's half of a heaven<br>
And we're only bluffing<br>
We're not ones for busting through walls<br>
But they've told us unless we can prove<br>
That we're doing it<br>
We can't have it all.<p>

He's gonna wangle a way to get out of it<br>
She's an excuse<br>
And a witness who'll talk when he's called,<br>
But they've told us<br>
Unless we can prove that we're doing it<br>
We can't have it all<br>
We can't have it all<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud<br>
It all goes slow-mo.<br>
I don't know why I'm crying<br>
Am I suspended in Gaffa?<br>
Not until I'm ready for you<br>
Not until I'm ready for you<br>
Can I have it all<p>

I try to get nearer,<br>
But as it gets clearer<br>
There's something appears in the way<br>
It's a plank in me eye<br>
With a camel who's trying to get through it,<br>
Am I doing it?<br>
Can I have it all now.<p>

I pull out the plank<br>
And say thank you for yanking me back<br>
To the fact<br>
That there's always something to distract<br>
But sometimes it's hard<br>
To know if I'm doing it right.<br>
Can I have it all?<p>

Can I have it all now?<p>

We can't have it all<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

I won't open boxes that I am told not to,<br>
I'm not a Pandora<br>
I'm much more like<br>
That girl in the mirror,<br>
Between you and me<br>
She don't stand a chance of<br>
Getting anywhere at all,<br>
Not anywhere at all,<br>
No, not a thing,<br>
She can't have it all.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
