<center>
As the light hits you, as you shift along the floor<br>
I find it hard to place my face<br>
How did I come to be here anyway?<br>
It's terribly vague, what's gone before<p>

I could have been anyone<br>
You could have been anyone's dream<br>
Why did you have to choose our moment?<br>
Why did you have to make me feel that?<br>
Why did you make it so unreal?<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Oh to be in love, and never get out again<br>
Oh to be in love, and never get out again<p>

All the colours look brighter now<br>
Everything they say seems to sound new<br>
Slipping into tomorrow too quick<br>
Yesterday always too good to forget<br>
Stop the swing of the pendulum, let us through!<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
