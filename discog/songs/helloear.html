Hello Earth<br>
Hello Earth<br>
With just one hand held up high<br>
I can blot you out,<br>
Out of sight<br>
Peek-a-boo,<br>
Peek-a-boo, Little Earth.<br>
With just my heart and my mind<br>
I can be driving,<br>
Driving home<br>
And you asleep on the seat.<p>

I get out of my car,<br>
Step into the night,<br>
and look up at the sky<br>
And there's something bright<br>
Travelling fast.<br>
Look at it go<br>
Look at it go.<p>

Watching storms<br>
Start to form<br>
Over America<br>
Can't do anything<br>
Just watch them swing<br>
With the wind<br>
Out to sea<br>
All you sailors<br>
(get out of the waves, get out of the water)<br>
All live-savers<br>
(get out of the waves, get out of the water)<br>
All you cruisers<br>
(get out of the waves, get out of the water)<br>
All you fishermen<br>
Head for home<br>
Go to sleep little earth,<br>
I was there at the birth,<p>

out of the cloud burst the head of the Tempest,<br>
Murderer, Murderer, of calm,<br>
Why did I go?<br>
Why did I go?<p>

Go to sleep little earth<p>
