<center>
Where is she when the little thing cries<br>
She lies in a bed with a friend of mine<br>
But some nights she'll run back in fright<br>
If she picks on a Dick that's too big for her pride<br>
And it's<br>
"oh Oh why did I ever go marry her"<br>
I was a child<br>
I'm holding the baby she's ran-tanning constantly<br>
She saw me coming for miles<br>
She saw me open wide<p>

Four o'clock and the keys in the lock<br>
And she's been on the win<br>
And she's stinking of drink<br>
Wakes the kid so I put him to sleep<br>
And she's in there all night<br>
Doubled over the sink<p>

"Oh Oh why did I ever go marry her"<br>
I was a child<br>
I'm holding the baby she's ran-tanning constantly<br>
She saw me coming for miles<br>
She saw me open wide<br>
Open wide Open wide<p>
