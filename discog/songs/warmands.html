Warm and soothing<br>
That's how I remember home<br>
Walking into arms through the back door<br>
Hearing voices I know well and long for<p>

Cold and boozy<br>
Our holiday in the Alps<br>
Sitting in the lobby mostly smoking<br>
Choking on the woozy afternoon<p>

I'm reeling in the music<br>
And I've only had a few<br>
And I'm afraid by the way we grow old<br>
My darling<br>
Abrupt too moody<br>
You making our party list<p>

I remember sulking on the sofa<br>
For most of the winter we were strangers<br>
Just one more to ease the ache<br>
Before the night takes me<br>
When you stay asleep on your side of the bed<br>
Don't look at me don't look at you<p>

I'm reeling in the music<br>
And I've only had a few<br>
And I'm afraid by the way we grow old<br>
My darling<p>
