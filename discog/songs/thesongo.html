The Song of Solomon<br>
The song of everyone<br>
Who walks the path<br>
Of the solitary heart<br>
The soul cries out<br>
Hear a woman singing<p>

    Don't want your bullshit, yeah<br>
    Just want your sexuality<br>
    Don't want excuses, yeah<br>
    Write me your poetry in motion<br>
    Write it just for me, yeah<br>
    And sing it with a kiss<p>

Mmm, just take any line<br>
"Comfort me with apples<br>
For I am sick of love<br>
His left hand is under my head<br>
And his right hand<br>
Doth embrace me"<br>
This is the Song of Solomon<br>
Here's a woman singing<p>

    Don't want your bullshit, yeah<br>
    Just want your sexuality<br>
    Don't want your excuses, yeah<br>
    Write me your poetry in motion<br>
    Write it just for me, yeah<br>
    And sign it with a kiss<p>

And I'll do it for you<br>
I'll be the Rose of Sharon for you<br>
I'll do it for you<br>
I'll be the Lily of the Valley for you<br>
I'll do it for you<br>
I'll be Isolde or Marion for you<br>
I'll do it for you<br>
Ooh I'll come in a hurricane for you<br>
I'll do it for you<p>

A wop bam boom<p>

    Don't want your bullshit, yeah<br>
    Just want your sexuality<p>
