    <P>The only known recording of this song is on the album '<A HREF="../albums/tey.html">The
        Early Years</A>', and because this album isn't available, neither
      officially nor as a bootleg, the song is unavailable.</P>
    
    <P> The title, 'You Were The Star', is not neccessarily the correct title.
      It's the name that appeared on '<A HREF="../albums/tey.html">The Early
        Years</A>'. </P>
