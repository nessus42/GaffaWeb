</H2>

<center>
It lay buried here, it lay deep inside me.<br>
It's so deep I don't think that I can<br>
Speak about it.<br>
It could take me all of my life<br>
But it would only take a moment to<br>
Tell you what I'm feeling<br>
But I don't know if I'm ready yet.<br>
You come walking into this room<br>
Like you're walking into my arms,<br>
What would I do without you?<p>

Take away the love and the anger<br>
And a little piece of hope holding us together<br>
Looking for a moment that'll never happen<br>
Living in the gap between past and future<br>
Take away the stone an the timber<br>
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.<p>

If you can't tell your sister<br>
If you can't tell a priest<br>
'Coz it's so deep you don't think that you can<br>
Speak about it to anyone..................<br>
Can you tell it to your heart?<br>
Can you find it in your heart<br>
To let go of these feelings<br>
Like a bell to a Southerly wind<br>
we could be like two strings beating,<br>
Speaking in sympathy...................<br>
What would we do without you?<br>
Two strings speak in sympathy.<p>

Take away the love and the anger<br>
And a little piece of hope holding us together<br>
Looking for a moment that'll never happen<br>
Living in the gap between past and future<br>
Take away the stone and the timber<br>
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together<p>

We're building a house of the future together<br>
(What would we do without you?)<br>
Well, if it's so deep you don't think that you<br>
Can speak about it<br>
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future.<br>
Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it<br>
Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future.<br>
You might not, not think so now<br>
But just you wait and see - someone will come to help you.<p>
