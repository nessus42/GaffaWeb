<center>
No, I'll never give the hunt up,<br>
And I won't muck it up.<br>
Somehow, this was it, I knew,<br>
Maybe fate wants you dead too.<br>
We've come together in the very same room.<br>
And I'm coming for you.<br>
Did you think I'd ever let you,<br>
get away with it, huh?<br>
He swooned in warm maroon.<br>
There's gas in your barrel,<br>
And I'm flooded with Doom.<br>
You've made a wake of our honeymoon,<br>
And I'm coming for you.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

All of the headlines said "Passion Crime",<br>
"Newly Weds, Groom Shot Dead, Mystery Man"<br>
God help the bride.<br>
She's a widow, all in Red, with his Red, still wet -<br>
She said (But she sure put him on the Wedding List)<br>
I'll put him on the Wedding List<br>
I'll get him on the Wedding List<br>
I'll get him and I will not miss.<p>

Now as I'm coming for you - All I see is Rudi,<br>
I die with him again and again,<br>
And I'll feel good in my revenge,<br>
I'm gonna fill your head with lead,<br>
And I'm coming for you.<br>
And when it's all over, you'll roll over,<br>
The butt of my gun,<br>
One in your belly and one for Rudi,<br>
You got what you gave by the heel of my bootie,<br>
Bang-Bang, out! Like an old cherootie,<br>
And I'm coming for you.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
