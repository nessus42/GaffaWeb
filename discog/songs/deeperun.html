As the people here grow colder<br>
I turn to my computer<br>
And spend my evenings with it<br>
Like a friend.<p>

I was loading a new programme<br>
I had ordered from a magazine<br>
"Are you lonely, are you lost?<br>
This voice console is a must"<br>
I press Execute.<p>

Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired,<br>
I bring you love and deeper understanding.<br>
Hello, I know that you're unhappy,<br>
I bring you love and deeper understanding.<p>

Well I've never felt such pleasure<br>
Nothing else seemed to matter<br>
I neglected my bodily needs<br>
I did not eat, I did not sleep<br>
The intensity increasing<br>
'Til my family found me and intervened<br>
But I was lonely, I was lost<br>
Without my little black box<br>
I pick up the phone and go Execute<p>

Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired,<br>
I bring you love and deeper understanding.<br>
Hello, I know that you're unhappy,<br>
I bring you love and deeper understanding.<p>

I turn to my computer like a friend<br>
I need deeper understanding.<br>
Give me deeper understanding.<p>
