We look to the left and to the right<br>
And we need help but nobody's in sight<br>
Where is the man that we all need<br>
Tell him he's to come and rescue me<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Doo-doo-n-doo-doo-no-doo dow<br>
Doo-doo-n-doo-doo-no-doo dow<br>
Ken is the man that we all need<br>
Ken is the leader of the G.L.C.<p>

Now head 'em up<br>
Rape 'em in<br>
Move 'em out<br>
Now can't you see<br>
That we need the leader of the G.L.C.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Who is the man that we all need? (KEN)<br>
Who is the funny sex machine? (KEN)<br>
Who is the leader of the G.L.C.? (KEN)<br>
Who is the man we all need? (KEN)<p>

Now head 'em up<br>
Rape 'em in<br>
Move 'em out (KEN)<br>
Can't you see<br>
That we need a-ah-ah-ah-ah<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Who is the man we all need? (KEN)<br>
(KEN)<p>
