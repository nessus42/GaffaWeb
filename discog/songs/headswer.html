You talked me into the game of chance,<br>
It was '39 before the music started<br>
When you walked up to me and you said<br>
"Hey, heads we dance."<br>
Well I, I didn't know who you were<br>
Until I saw the morning paper.<p>

There was a picture of you<br>
A picture of you 'cross the front page<br>
It looked just like you, just like you in every way.<br>
But it couldn't be true,<br>
It couldn't be true<br>
You stepped out of a stranger.<p>

They say that the Devil is a charming man<br>
And just like you I bet he can dance<br>
And he's coming up behind in his long<br>
Tailed black coat dance<br>
All tails in the air<br>
But the penny landed with it's head dancing<p>

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform<br>
Standing with your head held high<br>
Hot down to the floor<br>
But it couldn't be you<br>
It couldn't be you,<br>
It's a picture of Hitler.<p>

He go do-do-do-do-do<br>
He go do-do-do-do-do<br>
He go do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do you want to dance?<br>
Well I, I couldn't see what was to be<br>
So I just stood there laughing.<p>

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform<br>
Standing with your head held high<br>
Hot down to the floor<br>
But it couldn't be you,<br>
It couldn't be you<br>
It's a picture of Hitler.<p>

He go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh<br>
He go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh<br>
He go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh<br>
Heads we're dancing.<p>
