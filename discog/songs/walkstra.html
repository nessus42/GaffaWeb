Can't move my arms<br>
Can't move my legs<br>
Can't say no, I can't say yes<br>
Can't help myself<br>
I need your help.<br>
We go....<br>
Ooh, Ooh, what do we do, now we<br>
Just can't move?<br>
We're calling out for Middle Street<br>
Ooh, Ooh, what do we do,<br>
Now we just can't move?<br>
We hang on to every line<br>
And walk straight down the middle of it.<p>

He thought he was gonna die<br>
But he didn't<br>
She thought she just couldn't cope<br>
But she did<br>
We thought it would be so hard<br>
But it wasn't......it wasn't easy though!<p>

Can't say yes<br>
I can't say no<br>
Can't begin<br>
Can't let go....<br>
Help me now.<br>
We go<br>
Ooh, Ooh, what do we do, now we<br>
Just can't move?<br>
We're calling out for Middle Street<br>
Ooh, Ooh, what do we do<br>
Now we just can't move?<br>
We hang on to every line<br>
And walk straight down the middle of it.<p>

He thought he was gonna die<br>
But he didn't<br>
She thought she could never cope but she did<br>
We thought it was all over<br>
But it wasn't........it hadn't started yet.<p>

And walk straight down the middle of it<br>
And walk straight down the middle of it.<br>
"        " calling out for Middle Street<br>
We're calling out for Middle Street "            "<br>
Walking straight down the middle of it "       "<p>
