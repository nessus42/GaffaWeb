Hello old Lady<br>
I know your face well<br>
I know it well<br>
She says - ooh-na-na-na-na<br>
I'll be sitting in your mirror<br>
Now is the place where the crossroads meet<br>
Will you look into the future.<p>

Never, never say goodbye<br>
To my part of your life<br>
No, no, no,<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Let me live<br>
She said c'mon let me live<br>
She said c'mon let me live girl<p>

This moment in time<br>
It doesn't belong to you<br>
It belongs to me<br>
And to your little boy and to your little girl<br>
And the one hand clapping<br>
Where on your palm is my little line<br>
When you're written in mine<br>
As an old memory<br>
Ohh-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Never never never say goodbye<br>
To my part of your life<br>
No, no, no, no,<br>
Never, never, never, never<br>
Let me go.<br>
She said c'mon let me live<br>
She said c'mon let me live girl<p>
