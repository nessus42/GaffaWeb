<center>
Just look at your Father and you'll see<br>
How you took after him,<br>
Me, I'm just another, like my brothers,<br>
Of my Mother's genes.<p>

all they ever want for you<br>
Are the things they didn't do,<br>
All they ever wanted - a little clue;<br>
All they ever wanted - the Truth;<br>
All they ever wanted - a little bit of you;<br>
All they ever wanted, but they never did get.<p>

The whims that we're weeping for<br>
Our parents would be beaten for.<br>
Leave the breast and then the nest<br>
And then regret you ever left.<br>
All we're ever looking for is another open door,<br>
All we ever look for - another womb;<br>
All we ever look for - our own tomb;<br>
All we ever look for - ooh, la lune;<br>
All we ever look for - a little bit of you too;<br>
All we ever look for, but we never do score.<p>

All we ever look for - A God;<br>
All we ever look for - ooh, a drug;<br>
All we ever look for - a great big hug;<br>
All we ever look for - a little bit of you;<br>
All we ever look for - a little bit of you too;<br>
All we ever look for - but we never do score.<p>
