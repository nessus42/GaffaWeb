The night doesn't like it<br>
Looks just like your face<br>
On the moon, to me<br>
And I won't let you do<br>
What you want to do<br>
It's funny how, even now<br>
You're laughing<br>
I won't let you do it<br>
If you go, I'll let the law know<br>
And they'll head you off when you touch the ground,<br>
Ooh please<br>
Don't go through with this,<br>
I don't like the sound of it.<br>
It's funny how, even now<br>
You're miles away<br>
I won't let you do it<br>
I won't let you do it<br>
I won't let you go through with it.<p>

<i>Refrain </i><p>

Meet them over at Dover<br>
I'll just pilot the motor,<br>
Take them over the water<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

With a hired plane<br>
And no names mentioned<br>
Tonight's the night of the swallow<br>
There's no risk,<br>
I'll whisk them up<br>
In no moonlight<br>
And though pigs can fly<br>
They'll never find us<br>
Posing as the night<br>
And I'm home before the morning.<p>

In Malta, catch a swallow<br>
For all of the guilty to set them free<br>
Wings fill the window<br>
And they beat and bleed.<br>
They hold the sky<br>
On the other side<br>
Of border lines<br>
I won't let you do it<br>
I won't let you do it<br>
I won't let you go through with it<p>

<i>Refrain </i><p>

Meet them over at Dover,<br>
I'll just pilot the motor,<br>
Take them over the water,<br>
Like a swallow flying to Malta.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Give me a break,<br>
Ooh let me try,<br>
give me something to show<br>
For my miserable life<br>
Give me something to take<br>
Would you break even my wings<br>
Just like a swallow,<br>
Let me, let me go.<p>

But you're not a swallow<p>
