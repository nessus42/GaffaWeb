<center>
Little light shining<br>
Little light will guide them to me<br>
My face is all lit up<br>
My face is all lit up<br>
If they find me racing white horses -<br>
They'll not take me for a buoy<p>

Let me be weak let me sleep And Dream Of Sheep<p>

Oh I'll wake up to any sound of engines<br>
Ev'ry gull a seeking craft<br>
I can't keep my eyes open -<br>
Wish I had my radio<p>

I tune into some friendly voices<br>
Talking 'bout stupid things<br>
I can't be left to my imagination<br>
Let me be weak let me sleep And Dream Of Sheep -<p>

Ooh their breath is warm<br>
And they smell like sleep<br>
And they say they take me home -<br>
Like poppies heavy with seed -<br>
They take me deeper and deeper<p>
