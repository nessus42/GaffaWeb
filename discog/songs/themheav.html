</H2>

<center>
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me<br>
They arrived at an inconvenient time<br>
I was hiding in a room in my mind<br>
They made me look at myself<br>
I saw it well, I'd shut the people out of my life<br>
So now I take the opportunities<br>
Wonderful teachers ready to teach me<br>
I must work on my mind<br>
For now I realize that everyone of us<br>
Has a heaven inside<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot<br>
Them heavy people help me<br>
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot<br>
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me<p>

They open doorways that I thought were shut for good<br>
They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu<br>
They build up my body<br>
Break me emotionally, it's nearly killing me<br>
But what a lovely feeling!<br>
I love the whirling of the Dervishes<br>
I love the beauty of rare innocence<br>
You don't need no crystal ball<br>
Don't fall for a magic wand<br>
We humans got it all, we perform the miracles<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
