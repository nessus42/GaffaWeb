This song is only available as a Demo Recording. As such, the title is not sure, though everyone calls this song 'Disbelieving Angel'

<center>
So much for all the prayers you've learned.<br>
They are no help to basic needs.<br>
And all the worlds they've shown you<br>
Just make you even greedier.<p>

      So what about divinity?<br>
      I'm further away than before.<br>
      You're like two stars colliding,<br>
      And you're never going to hit the floor.<p>

Why should I whisper in the church?<br>
Because they say it's sacred ground?<br>
Oh, my sacrilege would do you good.<br>
You see, there's nothing here, I've found.<p>

      I feel so sorry for you,<br>
      Believing because they control.<br>
      And of all the guardian angels<br>
      They chose me to save your soul!<p>

Oh, I'm just trying to explain,<br>
I'm a disbelieving angel.<p>
