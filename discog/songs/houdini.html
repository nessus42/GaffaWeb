<center>
I wait at the table and hold hands with weeping strangers,<br>
Wait for you to join the group.<br>
The tambourine jingle-jangles<br>
The medium<br>
	Roams and rambles.<br>
Not taken in,<br>
	I break the circle.<br>
I want this man to go away now.<p>

With a kiss, I'd pass the key<br>
And feel your tongue<br>
Teasing and receiving.<br>
With your spit still on my lip - you hit the water.<p>

Him and I in the room<br>
To prove you are with us too<br>
He's using code that only you and I know<br>
This is no trick of his<br>
This is your magic.<p>

I'd catch the queues watching you<br>
Hoping you'd do something wrong.<p>

Everybody thinks you'll never make it -<br>
But every time you escape,<br>
Rosabel believe, not even Eternity -<br>
Can hold Houdini.<p>

	Rosabel, believe.<p>

Through the glass, I'd watch you breathe<br>
Bound and drowned<br>
And paler than you've ever been.<p>

With your life the only thing in my mind -<br>
We pull you from the water.<p>

	Houdini,<p>

You and I and Rosabel believe.<p>
