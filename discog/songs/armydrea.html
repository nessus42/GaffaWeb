Our little Army Boy,<br>
Is coming home from B.F.P.O.,<br>
I've a bunch of purple flowers<br>
To decorate a mammy's hero.<br>
Mourning in the aerodrome,<br>
The weather warmer, he is colder,<br>
Four men in uniform to carry home<br>
My little soldier.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

What could he do? Should have been a rock star,<br>
But he didn't have the money for a guitar.<br>
What could he do? Should have been a politician,<br>
But he never had a proper education.<br>
What could he do? Should have been a father,<br>
But he didn't even make it to his twenties.<br>
What a waste,<br>
Army Dreamers.<p>

Tears o'er a tin box,<br>
Oh Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know,<br>
Like a chicken with a fox,<br>
He cannot win the war with ego.<br>
Give the kid the pick of pips,<br>
And give him all your stripes and ribbons,<br>
Now he's sitting in his hole,<br>
He might as well have buttons and bows.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
