    <CENTER>The first time I died
    <BR> Was in the arms of good friends of mine.
    <BR> They kiss me with tears,
    <BR> They hadn't been near me for years
    <BR> Say why do it now
    <BR> When I won't be around, I'm going out?
    
    <P> &quot;We needed you to love us too, we wait for your move.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> Only tragedy allows the release
      <BR> Of love and grief never normally seen
      <BR> I didn't want to let them see me weep,
      <BR> I didn't want to let them see me weak
      <BR> But I know I have shown
      <BR> That I stand at the gates alone</P>
    
    <P> &quot;I needed you to love me too, I wait for your move.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> <I>Chorus </I></P>
    
    <P> All the love, all the love, all the love we could have given
      <BR> All the love, all the love, all the love you should have given
      <BR> All the love, all the love, all the love.</P>
    
    <P> The next time, I dedicate my life's work
      <BR> Tot the friends I make,
      <BR> I give them what they want to hear,
      <BR> They think I'm up to something weird
      <BR> And up rears the head of fear in me.
      <BR> So now when they ring, I get my machine to let them in.</P>
    
    <P> &quot;I needed you to love me too, I wait for your move.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> All the love, all the love, all the love we could have given
      <BR> All the love, all the love, all the love you should have given
      <BR> All the love, all the love, all the love.</P>
    
    <P> &quot;We needed you, to love us too, we wait for your move.&quot;</P>
