<center>
Held in your arms in the back seat,<br>
Cruising down the main street,<br>
How can anyone have such little defense?<p>

	You're soft.<p>

In between the sheets, left in limbo,<br>
Covered me like a pillow--<br>
I can hardly tell the difference.<p>

	You're soft,<br>
	So soft.<br>
            To be, to be with you<br>
            I'd leave everything.<p>

            	But I don't know how to deal with you.<br>
            	I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.<br>
            	Love would melt me like hot butter.<p>

            You're soft,<br>
            So soft.<br>
            To be, to be with you<br>
            I'd do anything.<p>

Walking down the street, brushing arms,<br>
You're moonlight dancing.<br>
I try hard to keep my feelings in.<p>

            You're soft.<p>

Dancing to the music, so low.<br>
I knead you like dough.<br>
How can anyone be so loving<p>

	And soft,<br>
            So soft?<br>
            To be, to be with you<br>
            I'd leave everything.<p>

            	But I don't know how to deal with you.<br>
            	I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.<br>
            	You melt me like hot butter.<p>

            You're soft,<br>
            So soft.<br>
            To be, to be with you<br>
            I'd do anything.<p>
