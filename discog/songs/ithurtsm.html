<center>
Slipping past the chimney-pots,<br>
Down among the ashes, away from old times--<br>
Why must I self-indulge in memories?<br>
I should be celebrating to a moving melody,<p>

      But it hurts me, it hurts me,<br>
      Honey, honey, it hurts me.<br>
      And I'm feeling like a waltz,<br>
      Growing old, old, old, old, old.<p>

I was firy but you put me out.<br>
I was always one for loving and leaving.<br>
I like to think I was immune to romance.<br>
I should be laughing at some good old comedy.<p>

      Oh, but it hurts me, it hurts me.<br>
      Honey, honey, it hurts me.<br>
      And I'm feeling like a waltz--<p>

If you laughed at me, I'd laugh too.<br>
What, don't you know that I'd be really breaking?<br>
L'amour--mon choux avec un Ýtranger. [Making love--my darling with a stranger.]<br>
I shouldn't care, you're not my darling anymore,<p>

      But it hurts me, it hurts me,<br>
      Honey, honey, honey, honey.<br>
      And I'm feeling like a waltz,<br>
      Growing old, old, old, old, old.<p>
