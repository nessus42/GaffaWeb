<center>
It doesn't hurt me<br>
Do you want feel how it feels<br>
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me<br>
Do you want to hear 'bout the deal that I'm making<br>
You, you and me,<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
Be running up that building<br>
If I only could oh...<p>

You don't want to hurt me<br>
But see how deep the bullet lies<br>
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder<br>
Ooh there is thunder in our hearts<br>
Is there so much hate for the ones we love<br>
Tell me we both matter don't we<br>
You<br>
You and me<br>
You and me won't be unhappy<p>

And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
Be running up that building<br>
If I only could oh...<p>

You<br>
You and me<br>
You and me won't be unhappy<br>
C'mon baby c'mon darlin'<br>
Let me steal this moment for you now<br>
Come on angel, c'mon, c'mon darling<br>
Let's exchange the experience oh,<p>

And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems.<p>

And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems.<p>

And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems.<p>

If I only could<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems.<p>

<h3>                   (extended version)

Be running up that hill<br>
If I only could...<br>
It doesn't hurt me<br>
do you want to feel how it feels<br>
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me<br>
Do you want to hear 'bout the deal that I'm making<br>
You you and me<p>

And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
Be running up that building<br>

You don't want to hurt me<br>
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder<br>
Is there so much hate for the ones we love<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
Be running up that building<p>

C'mon baby c'mon c'mon darlin'<br>
Let me steal this moment from you now<br>
Come on angel c'mon darling<br>
Let's exchange the experience oh<p>
