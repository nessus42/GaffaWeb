    <CENTER>High,
    <BR> I can't see you
    <BR> You've seen your own darling
    <BR> Alone and higher still
    <BR> She keeps her gallery.
    <BR> Distance means nothing
    <BR> To me.
    
    <P> A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,
      <BR> A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...</P>
    
    <P> Debris everywhere,
      <BR> Gazing. It's amazing.
      <BR> Ferry me over,
      <BR> Ferry me over,
      <BR> Ferry me over
      <BR> The music, darling.</P>
    
    <P> Deeper here
      <BR> Lie hidden
      <BR> Answers and treasures for him.
      <BR> &quot;Oh, I prefer absence,&quot; said she,
      <BR> &quot;My heart grows fonder
      <BR> Alone.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,
      <BR> A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...</P>
    
    <P> Debris everywhere,
      <BR> Gazing. It's amazing.
      <BR> Ferry me over,
      <BR> Ferry me over,
      <BR> Ferry me over
      <BR> The music, darling.</P>
