Emma's come down,<br>
She's stopped the light shining out of her eyes.<p>

Emma's been run out on,<br>
She's breaking down in so many places,<br>
Stuck in low gear, because of her fears,<br>
Of the skidding wheels,<br>
(The skid of her wheels she feels).<br>
Skidding wheels,<br>
(The skid of her wheels she feels).<br>
Spinning wheels,<br>
(Wheel-skidding feeling).<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Her heart is there,<br>
But they've greased the road,<br>
Her heart is out there,<br>
But she's no control.<p>

Oh come on, you've got to use your flow,<br>
You know what it's like, and you know you want to go,<br>
Don't drive too slowly.<br>
Don't put your blues where your shoes should be.<br>
Don't push your foot on the heartbrake.<p>

She's losing that inner flame.<br>
It was burning bright but she's losing the fight fast,<br>
She's only herself to blame,<br>
Well take of yourself, and remember Georgie,<br>
But she's so "O.D.'d" on weeping<br>
She can hardly see,<br>
That she's dropping beads,<br>
(Red, red glass is bleeding)<br>
Dropping beads,<br>
(Red, red glass is bleeding)<br>
Dropping Beads,<br>
(Red, red on the parquet).<p>
