<center>
You can't hear me<br>
You can't hear me<br>
You can't hear what I'm saying<br>
You can't hear what I'm saying to you.<p>

You watch the clock<br>
Move the slow hand<br>
I should have been home<br>
Hours ago - but I'm not here,<br>
but I'm not here,<br>
You can't hear me<br>
You can't hear me<br>
You can't feel me<br>
Here in the room with you now,<br>
You can't hear what I'm saying,<br>
You don't hear what I'm saying do you.<p>

Can't let you know<br>
What's been happening<br>
There's a ghost in our home<br>
Just watching you without me<br>
I'm not here, but I'm not here, but I'm not here.<br>
You can't hear me, you can't hear what I'm saying<br>
You didn't hear me come in<br>
You won't hear me leaving.<p>
