I see the people working and see it working for them,<br>
And so I want to join in, but then I find it hurts me.<br>
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap<br>
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have<br>
I see the people happy, so can it happen for me?<br>
'Coz when I am unhappy, there's nothing that can move me.<br>
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have<br>
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap<br>
Some say that heaven is hell, some say that hell is heaven.<br>
I must admit, just when I think I'm king (I just begin)<br>
Just when I think I'm king<br>
(I just begin.)<br>
I've been doing it for years, my goal is moving near,<br>
It says "Look I'm over here," then it up and disappears.<br>
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap<br>
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho ho.<br>
I want to be a lawyer, I want to be a scholar,<br>
But I really can't be bothered, ooh just<br>
Gimme it quick, gimme it, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.<br>
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho<br>
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho<br>
Some say that heaven is hell, Some say that hell is heaven,<br>
I must admit just when I think I'm king (I just begin)<br>
Just when I think I'm king I must admit (I just begin)<br>
Just when I think everything's going great (I just begin)<br>
Hey I get the break<br>
Hey I'm gonna take it all, (I just begin,)<br>
When I'm king, (just begin.)<br>
In my dome of ivory, a home of activity,<br>
I want the answers quickly, but I don't have no energy,<br>
I hold a cup of wisdom, but there is nothing within,<br>
My cup she never overfloweth and 'tis I that moan and groaneth,<br>
Some grey and white matter, (Give me the Karma Mama<br>
a jet to Mecca, Tibet or Jeddah,<br>
To Salisbury, A monastery,<br>
The longest journey, across the desert,<br>
Across the weather, across the elements,<br>
Across the water)<p>
