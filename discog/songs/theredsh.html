Oh she move like the Diva do<br>
I said "I'd love to dance like you."<br>
She said "just take off my red shoes<br>
Put them on and your dream'll come true<br>
With no words, with no song<br>
You can dance the dream with your body on<br>
And this curve, is your smile<br>
And this cross, is your heart<br>
And this line, is your path<p>

Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be<br>
But it's gonna be no illusion<br>
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it<br>
But it's gonna be really happening to ya<br>
Really happening to ya<br>
Really happening to ya"<p>

Oh the minute I put them on<br>
I knew I had done something wrong<br>
All her gifts for the dance had gone<br>
It's the red shoes, they can't stop dancing, dancing<br>
And this curve, is your smile<br>
And this cross, is your heart<br>
And this line, is your path<p>

"Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be<br>
But it's gonna be no illusion<br>
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it<br>
But it's gonna be really happening to ya"<p>

	She gotta dance, she gotta dance<br>
	And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off<br>
	Thes shoes do, a kind of voodoo<br>
	They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off<p>

Feel your hair come tumbling down<br>
Feel your feet start kissing the ground<br>
Feel your arms are opening out<br>
And see your eyes are lifted to God<br>
With no words, with no song<br>
I'm gonna dance the dream<br>
And make the dream come true<br>
I'm gonna dance the dream<br>
And make the dream come true<p>

	She gotta dance, she gotta dance<br>
	And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off<br>
	These shoes do, a kind of voodoo<br>
	They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off<br>
	Call a doctor, call a priest<br>
	They're gonna whip her up like a helicopter<p>

Really happening to ya<br>
Really happening to ya<p>

You gotta dance....<p>
