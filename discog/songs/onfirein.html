Whenever I look out french windows<br>
It's always snowing outside.<p>

Feel your body relax on mine,<br>
Giving me all the good lines,<br>
     (Uh-huh)<br>
          All the good lines,<br>
          All the good lines...<p>

     Hot in the ice,<br>
     On fire inside,<br>
     A snowball.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<p>

     Hot in the ice,<br>
     On fire inside,<br>
     A snowball.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<p>

A crystal layer of ice on our skin:<br>
Very numb outside but warm within.<p>

I bend to join our lips, but it's too cold<br>
To kiss and hit. Is it you I'm feeling?<br>
          Is it you I'm feeling?<br>
     (Yes?)<br>
          Is it you I'm feeling?<p>

     Hot in the ice,<br>
     On fire inside,<br>
     A snowball.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<p>

     Hot in the ice,<br>
     On fire inside,<br>
     A snowball.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<br>
     Ah, but she's wonderful,<br>
     Set in the snow.<p>
