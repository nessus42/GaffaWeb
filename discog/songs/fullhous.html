Driving back in her car,<br>
Watching the wipers squashing the leaves away.<br>
Suddenly there in the road,<br>
Is your old self trying to get out of the rain.<p>

I am my enemy,<br>
Mowing me over,<br>
And towing the light away.<br>
Somehow it just seems to fit,<br>
With that old me trying to get back again.<p>

Imagination sets in,<br>
Then all the voices begin,<br>
Telling you things that aren't happening<br>
(But they nig they nag, 'til the're under your skin.)<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

You've really got to.<br>
Remember yourself,<br>
You've got a fullhouse in your head tonight,<br>
Remember yourself,<br>
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight.<p>

My silly pride,<br>
Digging the knife in,<br>
She loves to come for her ride,<br>
Surely by now I should know,<br>
I can control my highs and my lows,<br>
By questioning all that I do,<br>
Examining every move,<br>
Trying to get back to the rudiments,<br>
(If they nig and they nag, I'll just put in the boot.)<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
