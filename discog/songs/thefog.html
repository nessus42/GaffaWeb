You see, I'm all grown up now.<br>
He said<br>
"Just put your feet down child<br>
'Coz you're all grown-up now".<br>
Just like a photograph I pick you up<br>
Just like a station on the radio<br>
I pick you up<br>
Just like a face in the crowd<br>
I pick you up<br>
Just like a feeling that you're sending out<br>
I pick it up<br>
But I can't let you go<br>
If I let you go<br>
You slip into the fog.............<p>

This love was big enough for the both of us,<br>
This love of yours,<br>
Was big enough to be frightened of<br>
It's deep and dark like the water was<br>
The day I learned to swim.<br>
He said "Just put your feet down child"<br>
Just put your feet down child<br>
The water is only waist high<br>
I'll let go of you gently<br>
Then you can swim to me.<p>

Is this love big enough to watch over me<br>
Big enough to let go of me?<br>
Without hurting me<br>
Like the day I learned to swim.<br>
"Coz you're all grown-up now"<br>
Just put your feet down child<br>
The water is only waist high.<br>
I'll let go of you gently<br>
Then you can swim to me<p>
