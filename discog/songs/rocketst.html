<center>
That November night, looking up into the sky,<br>
You said "Hey, wish that was me up there -<br>
It's the biggest rocket I could find<br>
And it's holding the night in it's arms<br>
If only for a moment.<br>
I can't see the look in it's eyes<br>
But I'm sure it must be laughing".<br>
But it seemed to me the saddest thing I'd ever seen<br>
And I thought you were crazy wishing such a thing -<p>

I saw only a stick on fire<br>
Alone on it's journey<br>
Home to the quickening ground<br>
With no one there to catch it.<p>

I put on my pointed hat<br>
And my black and silver suit<br>
And I check my gunpowder pack<br>
And I strap the stick on my back<br>
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge<br>
Nobody seems to see me<br>
Then with the fuse in my hand<br>
And now shooting into the night<br>
And still as a rocket<br>
I land in the river..<p>

Was it me said you were crazy?<br>
I put on my cloudiest suit<br>
Size 5 lightning boots too<br>
'Coz I am a rocket<br>
On fire<br>
Look at me go with my tail on fire<br>
With my tail on fire<br>
On fire<br>
Hey, look at me go, look at me...<p>
