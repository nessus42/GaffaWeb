"Bang" goes another Kanga<br>
On the bonnet of the van.<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land.)<br>
Many an Aboriginie's mistaken for a tree,<br>
'Til you near him on the motorway,<br>
The tree begin to breathe.<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land.)<br>
Coming in with the golden light in the morning.<br>
Coming in with the golden light is the New Man.<br>
Coming with the golden light is my dented van.<p>

	Woomera<p>

<i>Chorus </i> - DRE-A-M-T-I-ME<p>

The civilised keep alive the territorial war.<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land.)<br>
Erase the race that claim the place<br>
And say we dig for Ore,<br>
Or dangle Devils in a bottle<br>
And push them from the Pull Of The Bush.<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land.)<br>
You find them in the road.<br>
(See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand.)<br>
In the road.<br>
Coming in with the golden light - in the morning<br>
Coming in with the golden light - with no warning<br>
Coming in with the golden light - we bring in the rigging.<p>

Dig, dig, dig away.<p>

<i>Chorus </i> - DRE-A-M-T-I-ME<p>

M-M-Many an Aboriginie's mistaken for a tree<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)<br>
You near him on the motorway, the tree begin to breathe.<br>
Erase the race that claim the place and say we dig for ore.<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land.)<br>
Dangle Devils in a bottle and push them from the Pull Of The Bush<br>
(See the sun set in the hand of the man.)<br>
"Bang" goes another Kanga on the bonnet of the van<br>
(See the light ram through the gaps in the land)<br>
You find them in the road<p>

In the road<br>
(See the light)<br>
Pull of the Bush<br>
(See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand)<br>
Push them from the - Pull of the Bush<p>

See the sun set in the hand of the man.<p>
