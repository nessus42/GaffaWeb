With her hand in his hand<br>
They were both happy again.<br>
You started taking sides,<br>
They started arguing.<br>
He said it was her fault<br>
She said it wasn't at all<br>
But the truth lies somewhere in the middle.<p>

Where angels fear to tread you go rushing in<br>
Well I had to tell you then<br>
And now I'm telling you again<br>
Stay out of this<br>
You must not interfere<br>
Don't you see this is<br>
Between a man and a woman?<p>

Every day and night, I pray,<br>
Pray that you will stay away forever.<br>
It's so hard for love to stay together<br>
With the modern Western pressures<br>
I don't want to say it<br>
But I had to tell you then<br>
And now I'm telling you again<p>

Stay out of this.<br>
Oh, I know you mean to help me,<br>
And I know you've good intentions<br>
But stay out of this,<br>
This isn't your problem,<br>
Do not interfere - you are not needed here<br>
Let the pendulum swing<br>
Between an man and a woman.<br>
Don't you see you're in the way - Between a man and a woman.<br>
Every day and night I pray, Let the pendulum swing<br>
Between a man and a woman.<br>
Between a man and a woman.<p>
