I fell in love with Rinfi the gypsy.<br>
He said when I grew up he'd marry me,<br>
Carry me away on his steed.<p>

"Don't worry, my baby!<br>
 Don't die, my funny little darling!<br>
 I'm going away for a little while,<br>
 And shouldn't be gone for very long."<p>

Ooh, then I really fell for Geoffrey, our gardener.<br>
He said he'd marry me, too.<br>
Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool.<p>

"Don't worry, my honey!<br>
 Don't die, my funny little doll!<br>
 I'm going away for a little while.<br>
 Shouldn't be gone for very long."<br>
 (Ooh, a very, long, long time!)<p>

     Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,<br>
     Playing canasta in cold rooms,<br>
     Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,<br>
     And in my lover's...ooh...<p>

I met a boy who took me upstairs,<br>
Then took me in his arms and told me<br>
I comforted him, uh-huh.<p>

"Don't worry, my dear,<br>
 Don't cry, you weird little stranger.<br>
 I'm going away.<br>
 You probably won't ever see me again."<p>

Oh, yes, I know, I'm always falling,<br>
Gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes.<br>
How could I not lie there with you?<p>

"Don't worry, my darling!<br>
 Don't die, my silly little baby!<br>
 I'm going away for a little while,<br>
 And shouldn't be gone for very long."<br>
 (Ooh, long, long, long!)<p>

     Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,<br>
     Playing canasta in cold rooms,<br>
     Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,<br>
     And in my lover's...ooh...<p>
