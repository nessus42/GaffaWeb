</H2>

<center>
You came out of the night<br>
Wearing a mask in white colour <br>
My eyes were shining on the wine <br>
And your aura <br>
All in order, we move into the boudoir <br>
But too soon, the morning has resumed <p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon <br>
You look like an angel <br>
Sleeping it off at a station <br>
Were you only passing through?<br>
I'm dying for you just to touch me <p>

And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me <br>
L'amour looks something like you <p>

The thoughts of you sends me shivery <br>
I'm dressed in lace sailing down a black reverie <br>
My heart is thrown to the pebbles <br>
And the boatmen <br>
All the time I find I'm living in that evening <br>
With that feeling of sticky love inside <p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
