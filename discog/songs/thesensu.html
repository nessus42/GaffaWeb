Mmh, yes,<br>
Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth<br>
Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes,<br>
Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies<br>
Off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes,<br>
He said I was a flower of the mountain, yes,<br>
But now I've powers o'er a woman's body - yes.<p>

Stepping out of the page into the sensual world.<br>
Stepping out......................<br>
To where the water and the earth caress<br>
And the down of a peach says mmh, yes.<br>
Do I look for those millionaires<br>
Like a Machiavellian girl would?<br>
When I could wear a sunset, mmh, yes,<br>
And how we'd wished to live in the sensual world.<br>
You don't need words - just one kiss, then another.<p>

Stepping out of the page into the sensual world.<br>
Stepping out, off the page into the sensual world.<br>
And then our arrows of desire rewrite the speech, mmh, yes,<br>
and then he whispered would I, mmh, Yes,<br>
Be safe, mmh, yes, from mountain flowers?<br>
And at first with the charm around him, mmh, yes,<p>

He loosened it so if it slipped between my breasts<br>
He'd rescue it, mmh, yes,<br>
And his spark took life in my hand and, mmh, yes,<br>
I said, mmh, yes,<br>
But not yet, mmh, yes,<br>
Mmh, yes,<p>
