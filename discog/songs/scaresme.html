Here in the studio,<br>
As they're turning down the lights,<br>
I lick my lips to start the first line -<br>
How come they're scolding me?<br>
"Well, little thing, ah, you're looking lost!"<br>
The birdy goes and me too...<p>

    Ooh, ooh...<br>
    They try to hit me and the tapes begin to spin.<br>
    I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in<br>
    I try to put it on it, do it for you.<br>
    Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.<br>
    They try to hit me and the tapes begin to spin.<br>
    I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in [?]<br>
    I try to put it on it, do it for you.<br>
    Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.<p>

         Scares me silly, but it gets me going,<br>
         Like a Romeo.<br>
         Scares me silly, but it gets me going,<br>
         Like a Romeo.<br>
         Scares me silly, but it gets me going.<p>

Swimming amid the cabs,<br>
I wonder can I gull myself into another take,<br>
And keep the mood?<br>
It's like a music balance. [?]<br>
I close my eyes to cello solo,<br>
And hate/aid [?] the music.<br>
Don't ever let me go away.<p>

    You,<br>
    You know the feeling when you're on the right track.<br>
    You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.<br>
    It's a partial/party [?] -------------------------------.<br>
    -------------------------------.<br>
    You know the feeling when you're on the right track.<br>
    You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.<br>
    -------------------------------.<br>
    -------------------------------.<p>

         Scares me silly, but it gets me going,<br>
         Like a Romeo.<br>
         Scares me silly, but it gets me going,<br>
         Like a Romeo.<br>
         Scares me silly, but it gets me going.<p>
