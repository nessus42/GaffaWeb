In the warm room,<br>
Her perfume reaches you,<br>
Eventually you'll fall for her,<br>
Down you'll go to where the mellow wallows.<br>
In the warm room,<br>
She'll touch you with your Mamma's hand,<br>
You'll long to kiss those red lips,<br>
But when you do, it'll feel like kicking a habit.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

She'll tell you that she'll stay,<br>
So you'd better barricate the way out,<br>
She'll tell you she's true,<br>
She'll tell you she loves you.<br>
She's waiting in that warm room.<p>

In the warm room,<br>
She prepares to go to bed,<br>
She'll let you watch her undress,<br>
Go places where your fingers long to linger,<br>
In the warm room,<br>
You'll fall into her like a pillow,<br>
Her thighs are soft as marshmallows,<br>
Say hello, to the soft musk of her hollows.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

In the warm room,<br>
She's waiting in that warm room.<p>
