I look at you and see<br>
My life that might have been<br>
Your face just ghostly in the smoke.<br>
They're setting fire to the cornfields<br>
As you're taking me home.<br>
The smell of burning fields<br>
Will now mean you and here.<p>

This is where I want to be<br>
This is what I need<br>
This is where I want to be<br>
This what I need<br>
This is where I want to be<br>
But I know that this will never be mine.<p>

Ooh, the thrill and the hurting<br>
The thrill and the hurting<br>
I know that this will never be mine.<p>

I want you as the dream<br>
Not the reality<br>
That clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me<br>
But I'm looking back over my shoulder<br>
At you, happy without me.<p>

This is where I want to be<br>
This is what I need<br>
This is where I want to be<br>
This what I need<br>
This is where I want to be<br>
But I know that this will never be mine.<p>

Ooh, the thrill and the hurting<br>
Will never be mine<br>
The thrill and the hurting<br>
It will never be mine.<br>
It can never be<br>
The thrill and the hurting<br>
Will never be mine.<p>
