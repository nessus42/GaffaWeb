<center>
You've never driven through a red light,<br>
Or let your mind leave your body.<br>
It's pitch black in bed every night:<br>
You set the clock right for the morning alarm.<p>

	You've never wanted to start any fights,<br>
	Don't know a thing about tapping in on wires.<p>

                    I fill the room with people<br>
                    but still you sit empty,<br>
                    Stuck like putty.<br>
                    I tried to teach you good rock'n'roll,<br>
                    But you couldn't get over the old one-two,<br>
                    And nevertheless, you'll do.<br>
                    Nevertheless, you'll do.<br>
                    Nevertheless, you'll do.<p>

            You get up in the morning and put on your suit<br>
            For the office, and leave me.<br>
            You come home all pushed and pulled,<br>
            At six-thirty in the evening.<p>

               The television, it takes you away<br>
               To a picture-world where I have no say in it.<p>

                    I fill the room with people<br>
                    but still you sit empty,<br>
                    Stuck like putty.<br>
                    I tried to teach you good rock'n'roll,<br>
                    But you couldn't get over the old one-two,<br>
                    And nevertheless, you'll do.<br>
                    Nevertheless, you'll do.<br>
                    Nevertheless, you'll do.<p>
