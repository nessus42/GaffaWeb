</H2>

<center>
I hear him before I go to sleep<br>
And focus on the day that's been<br>
I realise he's there when I turn the light off<br>
And turn over<br>
Nobody knows about my man<br>
They think he's lost on some horizon<br>
And suddenly I find myself<br>
Listening to a man I've never known before<br>
Telling me about the sea<br>
All his love, 'til eternity<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Ooh, he's here again -<br>
The man with the child in his eyes<p>

He's very understanding<br>
And he's so aware of all my situations<br>
And when I stay up late<br>
He's always waiting<br>
But I feel him hesitate<br>
Oh, I'm so worried about my love<br>
They say "No, no, it won't last forever"<br>
And here I am again my girl<br>
Wondering what on earth I'm doing here<br>
Maybe he doesn't love me<br>
I just took a trip on my love for him<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
