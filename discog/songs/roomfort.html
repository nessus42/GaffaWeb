Hey there you lady in tears<br>
Do you think that they care if they're real woman?<br>
They just take it as part of the deal<br>
Lost in your men and the games you play<br>
Trying to prove that you're better, woman<br>
But you needn't get heavy with them<br>
Like it or not, we were built tough<br>
Because we're woman<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

No, we never die for long<br>
While we've got that little life to live for<br>
Where it's hid inside, no, we never die for long<br>
Oh - woman, two in one<br>
There's room for a life in your womb, woman<br>
Inside of you, can be two, woman<br>
There's room for a life in your womb, woman<br>
Mama woman - aha -<p>

Night after night in the quite house<br>
Plating her hair by the fire, woman<br>
With no lover to free her desire<br>
How long do you think she can stick it out<br>
How long do you think, before she'll go out, woman<br>
Hey get up on your feet and go get it now<br>
Like it or not we keep bouncing back<br>
Because we're woman<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
