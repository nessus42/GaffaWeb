Last night you were on my balcony.<br>
You needn't try, know the whole story.<br>
Before it's too late I must get away,<br>
But both of us know you must stay.<p>

     Oh, come on, Camilla,<br>
     Surrender into the roses.<br>
     Go back home under the posies.<br>
     Surrender into the roses,<br>
     Camilla, Camilla, Camilla.<p>

Tying, dying, flowers around the room.<br>
It keeps me safe, but oh! the sickly perfume.<br>
Well, it makes me long for the good times,<br>
When you were really alive.<p>

     Oh, come on, Camilla,<br>
     Surrender into the roses.<br>
     Go back home under the posies.<br>
     Surrender into the roses,<br>
     Camilla, Camilla, Camilla.<p>
