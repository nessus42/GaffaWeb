<center>
Down in the cellar<br>
You're getting into making poison<br>
You slipped some on the side<br>
Into my glass of wine<br>
And I don't want any coffee-homeground<p>

Offer me a chocolate<br>
No thank you spoil my diet know your game!<br>
But tell me just how come<br>
They smell of bitter almonds?<br>
It's a no-no to your coffee homeground<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Pictures of Cripping lipstick-smeared<br>
Torn wallpaper have the walls got ears here?<p>

Well you won't get me with your Belladonna - in the coffee<br>
And you won't get me with your arsenic - in the pot of tea<p>

And you won't get me in a hole to rot (put me in a six foot plot)<br>
With your hemlock on the rocks<p>

Where are the plumbers Who went a-missing here on Monday?<br>
There was a tall man<br>
With his companion<br>
And I bet you gave them coffee-homeground<br>
Well maybe you are lonely<br>
And only want a little company<br>
But keep your recipes for the rats to eat<br>
And may they rest in peace with coffee-homeground<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
