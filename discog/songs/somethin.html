There's something that sounds like a song<br>
In my garden, by the willow -<br>
A piper:<br>
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo..."<p>

I see him when I turn the lights down low,<br>
In my garden, wading through the pond.<br>
Resting so ------------.<br>
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo..."<p>

I've called him by every name I know,<br>
By every name I know,<br>
But he won't answer me.<br>
He keeps coming forward, but never moving.<br>
Is there no destiny here?<p>

It sounds like a song<br>
In my garden, by the willow -<br>
A piper:<br>
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo..."<p>
