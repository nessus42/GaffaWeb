It is this that brings us together<br>
It is this that brings us together<br>
It's alright darling, we can do this together<br>
It's alright darling I can think of nothing better<br>
I don't know you and you don't know me<br>
It is this that brings us together<p>

I don't know what you are looking for in me<br>
I don't know what I want but my heart is leading<p>

Am I yours?<br>
Are you mine?<br>
We'll find all we're meant to find<br>
In your life<br>
In my life<br>
There are secrets too dark<br>
To let out<br>
To let go of<br>
To get over<p>

But that's alright baby<br>
Oh that's alright by me<br>
But let me say "please, please, please<br>
Please be kind<br>
Be kind to my mistakes"<p>
