It's alright I'll come 'round when you're not in<br>
And I'll pick up all my things<br>
Everything I have I bought with you<br>
But that's alright too<br>
It's just everything I do<br>
We did together<br>
And there's a little piece of you<br>
In whatever<br>
I've got everything I need<br>
I've got petrol in the car<br>
I've got some money with me<br>
There's just one problem<p>

    You're the only one I want<br>
    You're the only one I want<br>
    You're the only one I want<br>
    You're the only one I want<p>

It's alright I know where I'm going<br>
I'm going to stay with my friend<br>
Mmm, yes, he is very good looking<br>
The only trouble is<br>
He's not you<br>
He can't do what you do<br>
He can't make me laugh and cry<br>
At the same time<br>
Let's change things<br>
Let's danger it up<br>
We're crazy enough<br>
I just can't take it<p>

    You're the only one I want<br>
    You're the only one I want<br>
    You're the only one I want<br>
    You're the only one I want<p>

I know where I'm going<br>
But I don't want to leave<br>
I just have one problem<br>
We're best friends, yeah?<br>
We tied ourselves in knots<br>
Doing cartwheels 'cross the floor<br>
Just forget it alright<p>

Sugar?...<br>
Honey?...<br>
Sugar?...<p>
