This chapter says <br>
"Put it out of your mind"<br>
Mmm, give it time....<p>

The fine purple <br>
The purest gold <br>
The red of the Sacred Heart <br>
The grey of a ghost <br>
The "L" of the lips are open <br>
To the "O" of the Host <br>
The "V" of the velvet<p>

    Of all of the people in the world <br>
    Why should I love you?<br>
    There's just something 'bout you <br>
    There's just something 'bout you <br>
    Of all the people in the world <br>
    Why should I love you?<p>

Have you ever seen a picture <br>
Of Jesus laughing?<br>
Mmm, do you think <br>
He had a beautiful smile?<br>
A smile that healed<p>

    Of all the people in the world <br>
    Why should I love you?<br>
    There's just something 'bout you <br>
    There's just something 'bout you <br>
    Of all the people in the world <br>
    Why should I love you?<br>
    Of all the people in the world <br>
    Why should I love you?<p>

The fine purple <br>
The purest gold <br>
The red of the Sacred Heart <br>
The grey of a ghost <br>
The "L" of the lips are open <br>
To the "O" of the Host <br>
The "V" of the velvet <br>
The "E" of my eye <br>
The eye in wonder <br>
The eye that sees <br>
The "I" that loves you<p>

Of all the people in the worls <br>
Why should I love you?<p>
