</H2>

<center>
When you left the door was (slamming)<br>
You paused in the doorway<br>
As though a thought stole you away<br>
I watch the world pull you away<br>
(lock it)<br>
So I run into the hall,<br>
(lock it)<br>
Into the corridor<br>
There's a door in the house (slamming)<br>
I hear the lift descending<br>
I hear it hit the landing<br>
See the hackles on the cat (standing)<br>
With my key I (lock it)<br>
With my key I (lock it up)<br>
With my key I (lock it)<br>
With my key I (lock it up)<p>

<i>Refrain </i><p>

I am the concierge chez moi honey<br>
Won't letcha in for love nor money<br>
My home my joy<br>
I'm barred and bolted and I<br>
	Won't letcha in<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

(Get out of my house)<br>
No strangers feet<br>
Will enter me<br>
I wash the panes<br>
I clean the stains away<br>
This house is as old as I am<br>
This house knows all I have done<br>
They come with their weather hanging around them<br>
But can't knock my door down<br>
With my key I (lock it)<br>
With my key I (lock it)<br>
This house is full of m-m-my mess<br>
This house is full of m-m-mistakes.<br>
This house is full of m-m-madness<br>
This house is full of, full of, full of, full of fight.<p>

With my keeper I (clean up)<br>
With my keeper I (clean it all up)<br>
With my keeper I (clean up)<br>
With my keeper I (clean it all up)<p>

<i>Refrain </i><p>

I am the concierge chez moi honey<br>
Won't letcha in for love or money<br>
My home, my joy I'm barred and bolted and I<br>
	Won't letcha in<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

(Get out of my house)<br>
No strangers feet<br>
Will enter me<br>
I wash the panes<br>
I clean the stains<p>

Woman, let me in<br>
Let me bring in the memories<br>
Woman, let me in,<br>
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams<p>

I will not let you in<br>
Don't you bring back the reveries<br>
I turn into a bird<br>
Carry further than the word is heard.<p>

Woman, let me in,<br>
I turn into the wind<br>
I blow you a cold kiss<br>
Stronger than the song's hit<p>

I will not let you in<br>
I face towards the wind,<br>
I change into the Mule.<br>
	"Hee - Haw"<br>
	"Hee - Haw"...<p>
