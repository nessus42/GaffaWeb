Come close to me<br>
Come cross the bridge<br>
I need to know what you have to say to me<br>
(We've been waiting all night long)<br>
What have you got to say to me?<br>
(We've been waiting all night long)<br>
Tell me about it<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
Tell me please<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
Oh I know<p>

I know it works for me<br>
As we cross the bridge - the burning bridge<br>
With flames behind us<br>
We front the line<br>
It's you and me baby against the world<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
I've got to know what you have to say<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
What have you got to say?<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
Oooh-oh-oh<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
I've got to get closer now<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
Tell me all about it<br>
(We've been)<br>
All night long<br>
(We've been)<br>
All night long<br>
(We've been)<p>

It works for me<br>
It's you and me babe - against the world<br>
All night long<br>
It works for me<br>
Let's cross the bridge<br>
Oh I know<br>
(We've been waiting)<br>
I know I know<br>
(We've been)<br>
It's you and me babe<br>
When you stand next to me babe it's alright<br>
It's you and me babe - against the world<p>
