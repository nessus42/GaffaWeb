I've never seen<br>
Such a sad queen<br>
As Eddie.<br>
I've seen him raving,<br>
Maybe even in pain,<br>
But never<br>
      Weeping like a baby.<p>

     On Saturday afternoon<br>
     He was really fine to him.<br>
     And on Saturday evening,<br>
     Oh, well Eddie was so pretty.<br>
     But now his boy is leaving.<p>

Hey, boy, you're so young<br>
To be a queen weeping.<br>
You're just a little princess.<br>
Oh, Eddie, don't!<br>
'Cause what can I do<br>
But listen to you tell your story?<p>

     On Saturday afternoon<br>
     He was really fine to him.<br>
     And on Saturday evening,<br>
     Oh, well Eddie was so pretty.<br>
     But now his boy is leaving.<br>
     But now his boy is leaving.<br>
     But now his boy is leaving him.<p>

Queen, come home soon!<p>
