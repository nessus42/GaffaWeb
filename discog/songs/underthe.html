It wouldn't take me long<br>
To tell you how to find it<br>
To tell you where we'll meet<br>
This little girl inside me<br>
Is retreating to her favourite place<br>
Go into the garden<br>
go under the ivy<br>
Under the leaves<br>
Away from the party<br>
Go right to the rose<br>
Go right to the white rose<br>
(for me).<p>

I sit here in the thunder<br>
The green on the grey<br>
I feel it all around me<br>
And it's not easy for me<br>
To give away<br>
A secret - it's not safe<br>
But go into the garden<br>
Go under the ivy<br>
Under the leaves<br>
Away from the party<br>
Go right to the rose<br>
Go right to the white rose<br>
(for me)<br>
It wouldn't take me long to tell<br>
You how to find it<p>
