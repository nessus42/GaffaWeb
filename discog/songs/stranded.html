<center>
A long way up in light-years,<br>
Just a pinpoint in space,<br>
In a century of planetary storms,<br>
Stranded at the moonbase,<p>

      The air is getting low.<br>
      The air is getting low.<p>

Looking out at the roof-window,<br>
I've seen many strange things,<br>
From shooting stars to Stars 'n' Stripes--<br>
Thought I'd caught a glimpse of golden wings.<p>

      The air is getting low,<br>
      The air is getting low,<br>
      The air is getting low,<br>
      The air is getting low.<p>

           I got the vision of big white dove.<br>
           I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above.<br>
           I'm wond'ring why the big white dove<br>
           Is keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,<br>
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,<br>
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting.<p>

Looking way down below me,<br>
The worlds are all awhirl-whirly.<br>
Won't you come along beside?<br>
This place waits for company.<p>

      The air is getting low.<br>
      The air is getting low.<p>

I leave my limbs behind me.<br>
As I'm being lifted<br>
Out into the - into the<br>
Spiritual boom-boom abyss.<p>

      The air is getting low.<br>
      The air is getting low.<br>
      The air is getting low.<br>
      The air is getting low.<p>

           I got the vision of big white dove.<br>
           I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above.<br>
           I'm wond'ring why the big white dove<br>
           Is keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,<br>
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,<br>
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting.<p>
