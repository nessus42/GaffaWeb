<H2 ALIGN="center">              The Handsome Cabin Boy
</H2>

<center>
It's of a pretty female as you may understand<br>
Her mind being bent for rambling into<br>
Some foreign land<br>
She dressed herself in sailors clothes<br>
Or so it does appear<br>
And she hired with a captain to serve him<br>
For a year<p>

Her cheeks they were like roses<br>
And her hair all in a curl<br>
The sailors often smiled and said<br>
He looked just like a girl<br>
But eating of the Captain's biscuit<br>
Her colour did destroy<br>
And the waist did swell of pretty Nell -<br>
The handsome cabin boy<p>

It was in the Bay of Biscay<br>
Our gallant ship did plough<br>
One night among the sailors was a fearful<br>
Flurrying row<br>
They tumbled from their hammocks for<br>
Their sleep it did destroy<br>
And they swore about the groaning of<br>
The handsome cabin boy<p>

Oh doctor dear oh doctor the cabin boy did cry<br>
The time has come I am undone<br>
And I will surely die<br>
The doctor came a-running<br>
And a-smiling at the fun<br>
To think a sailor lad should have a daughter or a son<p>

The sailors when they saw the joke<br>
They all did stand and star<br>
The child belonged to none of them<br>
They solemnly did swear<br>
The captain's wife she says to him -<br>
My dear I wish you joy<br>
For 'tis either you or me's betrayed<br>
The handsome cabin boy<p>
</center>

There are two verses to the song which Kate has left out.  One is the second verse:<p>

<center>
The captain's wife she being on board, she seem-ed in great joy<br>
To see her husband had engaged such a handsome cabin boy<br>
And now and then she'd slip in a kiss, and she would have liked to toy<br>
But it was the captain found out the secret of the handsome cabin boy<p>
</center>

The other is the last verse:<p>

<center>
Then each man took his tot of rum, and drunk success to trade<br>
And likewise to the cabin boy, who was neither man nor maid<br>
Here's hopin' the wars don't rise again, our sailors to destroy<br>
And here's hoping for a jolly lot more like the handsome cabin boy<p>
</center>
