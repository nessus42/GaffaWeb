</H2>

<center>
We're all alone on the stage tonight,<br>
We've been told we're not afraid of you,<br>
We know all our lines so well, ah-ha,<br>
We've said them so many times,<br>
Time and time again,<br>
Line and line again.<p>

Ooh yeah, you're amazing,<br>
We think you're incredible,<br>
You say we're fantastic,<br>
But still we don't head the bill,<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW,<br>
Unbelievable.<p>

When the actor reaches his death,<br>
You know it's not for real, he just holds his breath,<br>
But he always dives too soon, too fast to save himself,<p>

He'll never make the screen,<br>
He'll never make "the Sweeney",<br>
Be that movie queen,<br>
He's too busy hitting the vaseline.<p>

Ooh yeah you're amazing,<br>
We think you are really cool,<br>
We'd give you a part my love,<br>
But you'd have to play the fool.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
