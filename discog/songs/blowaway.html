One of the band told me last night,<br>
that music is all that he's got in his life.<br>
So where does it go?<br>
Surely not with his soul.<br>
Will all of his licks and his R & B, Blow Away -<br>
Blow Away, Blow Away.<br>
Our engineer had a different idea,<br>
From people who nearly died, but survived,<br>
Feeling no fear, of leaving their bodies here,<br>
And went to a room that was soon full of visitors -<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Hello Minnie, Moony, Vicious, Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny,<br>
Please don't Thump me, Don't bump me, Don't dump me back there,<br>
Please don't thump me, Don't bump me, I want to stay here.

Put out the Light, then put out the light -<br>
Vibes in the sky invite you to dine,<br>
Dust to dust, Blow to Blow,<br>
Bolan and Moony are heading the show tonight.<p>
