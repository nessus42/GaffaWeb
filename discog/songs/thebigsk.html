They look down at the ground, missing,<br>
But I never go in now -<br>
I'm looking at the Big Sky,<br>
I'm looking at the Big Sky now,<br>
I'm looking at the Big Sky<br>
You never understood me,<br>
You never really tried.<p>

That cloud, that cloud - looks like Ireland,<br>
C'mon and blow it a kiss now.<br>
But quick 'coz it's changing in the Big Sky<br>
It's changing in the Big Sky now<br>
We're looking at the Big Sky.<br>
You never understood me<br>
You never really tried.<p>

This cloud, this cloud says &quot;Noah,<br>
c'mon and build me an Ark&quot;<br>
And if you're coming - jump<br>
'coz we're leaving with the Big Sky<br>
We're leaving with the Big Sky<br>
And we pause for the jets<br>
hup, hup in the Big Sky<br>
You want my reply?<br>
What was the question?<br>
I was looking at the Big Sky.<p>

<h2>                     The Big Sky

<h3>               (The meteorological mix)
</h3>

That cloud, that cloud - looks like Ireland<br>
C'mon and blow it a kiss now<br>
But quick 'coz it's changing in the Big Sky<br>
It's changing in the Big Sky now<br>
We're looking at the Big Sky<br>
You never understood me<br>
You never really tried<p>

This cloud, this cloud says &quot;Noah&quot;,<br>
I'm looking at the Big Sky<br>
I'm looking at the Big Sky<p>

Looking at the air<br>
Looking at the air<br>
Pause for the jets<br>
Hup, hup in the Big Sky<br>
We're looking at the Big Sky, honey<br>
You want my reply?<br>
What was the question?<br>
I was looking at the Big Sky...<p>
