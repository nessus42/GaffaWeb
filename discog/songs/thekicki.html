<center>
I've pulled down my lace and the chintz<br>
Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius<br>
I'll send your love to Zeus<br>
Oh, by the time you read this, I'll be well in touch<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

I'm giving it all in a moment or two<br>
I'm giving it all in a moment for you<br>
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it - giving it<br>
this kicking here inside makes me leave you behind<br>
No more under the quilt to keep you warm<br>
Your sister I was born - you must lose me<br>
Like an arrow shot into the killer storm<p>

You and me on the bobbing knee<br>
Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read<br>
[early version: Welling eyes from identifying with Lizzy Wan's story]<br>
I will come home again, but not until<br>
The sun and the moon meet on yon hill<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
