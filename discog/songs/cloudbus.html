<center>
I still dream of Organon.<br>
I wake up crying.<br>
You're making rain<br>
And you're just in reach<br>
When you and sleep escape me<p>

You're like my yo-yo<br>
That glowed in the dark<p>

What made it special<br>
Made it dangerous<br>
So I bury it and forget.<p>

Everytime it rains,<br>
You're here in my head<br>
Like the sun coming out -<br>
Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen<br>
And I don't know when<br>
But just saying it could even make it happen.<p>

On top of the world<br>
Looking over the edge<br>
You could see them coming<br>
You looked too small<br>
In their big black car<br>
To be a threat to the men in power.<p>

I hid my yo-yo in the garden<p>

I can't hide you from the government<br>
Oh God, daddy - I won't forget<p>

Your son's coming out<p>

<h2>                     Cloudbusting
</h2>
<h3>                    The organon mix
</h3>

I still dream of Organon.<br>
You're making rain<br>
And you're just in reach<p>

You're like my yo-yo<br>
That glowed in the dark<br>
What made it special<br>
Made it dangerous<br>
So I bury it and forget.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

Ooh I just know <br>
That something good is going to happen<br>
And I don't know when<br>
But just saying it could even make it happen.<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>
