</H2>

<center>
When I was a child<br>
Running in the night<br>
Afraid of what might be<br>
Hiding in the dark<br>
Hiding in the street<br>
And of what was following me<br>
Now hounds of love are hunting<br>
I've always been a coward<br>
And I don't know what's good for me<p>

Here I go<p>

It's coming for me thro' the trees<br>
Help me someone, help me please<br>
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake.<br>
And I'll be 2 steps on the water.<br>
I found a fox caught by dogs<br>
He let me take him in my hands<br>
His little heart beats so fast<br>
And I'm ashamed of running away,<br>
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this<br>
But I'm still afraid to be there,<br>
Among your hounds of love.<br>
And feel your arms surround me<br>
I've always been a coward<br>
And never know what's good for me.<br>
Here I go - Don't let me go - Hold me down<br>
It's coming for me through the trees<p>

Help me darling, help me please<br>
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake<br>
And I'll be two steps on the water<p>

I don't know what's good for me,<br>
I don't know what's good for me,<br>
I need love, love, love, love, yeah -<p>

Your love.<p>

Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake,<br>
Do you know what I really need<br>
Do you know that I really need<br>
I need love, love, love, love...<p>



<h2>                 Alternative Hounds of Love
</h2>

When I was a child running away from nothing<br>
Heading for home<br>
Now hounds of love are hunting<br>
I've always been a coward<br>
And I don't know what's good for me<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

C'mon and run, run, run, run, run, run honey<br>
run from the hounds of love<br>
Run, run, run, run, run, run honey<br>
Run from the hounds of love<br>
Run run run run run keep running<br>
Run from the hounds of love<br>
They need love, love, love, love, love---yeah<p>

Do you know what I really need?<br>
I know what I really need<br>
But I don't know what's good for me<br>
I don't know what's good for me<p>

Oh, I need love<br>
Now hounds of love are hunting<br>
I've always been a coward<br>
And I don't know what's good for me<br>
I never know what's good for me<p>

<i>Chorus </i><p>

So run, run, run, run, run, run honey<br>
Run, run honey<br>
Run, run, run, run<br>
Run, run, run, run, run, run honey<br>
Run from the hounds of love<br>
Run, run--run from the hounds of love<p>
