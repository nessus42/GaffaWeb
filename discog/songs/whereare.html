Destiny took me in her arms and told me:<br>
"You're a little lost on the fall.<br>
You fall for all the men<br>
You shouldn't fall for at all."<br>
Ooh, I know she knows, but still I go on,<br>
Well, I'm a fool.<p>

     Climbing up the atoms<br>
     To slide down the adders<br>
          On the rocks,<br>
          On the rocks,<br>
          On the rocks,<br>
          On the rocks...<p>

Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,<br>
A burning sword.<br>
I'd like to cry. I look into her eyes.<br>
I see she -----------.<br>
"Ooh," she says,<br>
"The games are still the same, I see,<br>
But they've changed the names now.<br>
Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart?"<p>

     Lionhearts in the asylums,<br>
     Lionhearts tossed at sea,<br>
     Lionhearts who've lived their lives, like Arthur.<br>
     Lionhearts in cathedrals,<br>
     Lionhearts at mournings,<br>
     Lionhearts in every seed--<br>
          But they're sown<br>
          On the rocks,<br>
          On the rocks,<br>
          On the rocks,<br>
          On the rocks...<p>

Somebody I couldn't see<br>
Tied me up and put me away,<br>
Here on the rocks,<br>
Here on the rocks,<br>
Here on the rocks...<p>
