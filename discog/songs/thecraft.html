I tried to study it for just a while:<br>
All of the potions, from oysters to seducing smiles.<br>
But I've found it's already inside me:<br>
A big warm bubble of sensuality,<br>
There to be burst,<br>
But I'm worried about getting hurt.<p>

     I know how you like to kiss.<br>
     I'll ask you what you're thinking.<br>
     Soul burns, and I don't care.<br>
     The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish.<p>

          The craft of love,<br>
          The craft of love,<br>
          The craft of love,<br>
          The craft of love,<br>
          Oo-ooh...<p>

Tears spring to mind when I go back in time.<br>
All those lost bodies just seeking security.<br>
Jittering strangers with smutty hands,<br>
Heavy and clever and full of demands.<br>
Well I'm similar to you:<br>
We're familiar with what to do.<p>

     I know how you like to kiss.<br>
     I'll ask you what you're thinking.<br>
     Soul burns, and I don't care.<br>
     The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish.<p>

          The craft of love,<br>
          The craft of love,<br>
          The craft of love,<br>
          The craft of love,<br>
          Oo-ooh...<p>
