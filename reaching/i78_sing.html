<P>    KATE BUSH has a strong      sense of family. Her brother      Patrick
played mandolin on      her hit single &quot;Wuthering      Heights&quot; and
will naturally be      a part of her band when it      comes to gig time. Two of
     her brothers live in a      separate flat in the same      house in Lewsham
which is      owned by her father. They are      the two brothers who were     
astute enough to notice      Kate's talent and start her on      the road to
fame.</P>
<P>    &quot;I have two older brothers      and they were both very      keen
on musical instruments      so I just grew up with music      all around me.&quot;
she says.</P>
<P>    &quot;When I was about 11      I just  started poking      around at the
piano and      started making up little      songs.</P>
<P>    &quot;It was just an easy way to      release all the energy I felt     
inside me. I never played      Beatles songs or anything      Iike that. I was
always just      exploring the instrument.</P>
<P>    &quot;Then, when I was 14, 1      started taking it seriously and      I
began to treat the words to      the songs as poetry. I'd      always been keen
on poetry      at school and it was lovely to      put the poems together with  
  music.&quot;</P>
<P>    The most important piece of      furniture in Kate's flat is an old     
honky-tonk piano she bought      in a second-hand  shop in      Woolich.</P>
<P>     &quot;I feel as though I've built up      a real relationship with this
     piano,&quot; she says. &quot;It's almost      like a person. Like, it's
really      comforting just to sit down and      play it.</P>
<P>    &quot;And the piano almost      dictates what my songs will      be
about.</P>
<P>    &quot;If I haven't got a particular      idea I just sit down and play  
    chords and then the chords      almost dictate what the song      should be
about because they      have their own moods.</P>
<P>    &quot;Like a minor chord is very      likely to tell me something sad.  
   A major chord tells me      something a little more      up-tempo and, like,
on a more      positive level of thinking.&quot;</P>
<P>    The success of  &quot;Wuthering      Heights&quot; and  her album 'The
Kick       Inside&quot; will help Kate realise one       ambition. Much as she
loves her      old honky-tonk piano,  she had a      wish before she hit the top
of the      charts. </P>
<P>    &quot;If ever made enough money      I'd like to get a piano that sings;
a      great big singing beast like a      Steinway.&quot;  Bet she has her
beast      by now.</P>
