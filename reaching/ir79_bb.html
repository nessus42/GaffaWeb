<P>Woman's Hour Interview 
</P>
<P>BBC 2 
</P>
<P>With Sue McGregor 
</P>
<P>Feb 21, 1979 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to IED for providing me with tape. The
sound  quality is not very good, so quite a bit of the interview is inaudible.
If anyone has a  better tape or a more complete transcription, please let me
know.] 
</P>
<P>[Introduction] 
</P>
<P>I: How does it feel, not long ago - just over a year ago, nobody had heard
of you.  Now everybody has, just about. Does the success seem a bit strange or
have you  gotten used to it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, they are certain aspects of it that are strange, but I think human
beings are  particularly good at adapting themselves to a new kind of situation,
especially  females. So I'm just still coping with it, really. 
</P>
<P>I: [Inaudible] 
</P>
<P>K: [Inaudible] as far as human being go, yeah. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Let's talk about that song, Wuthering Heights, now we could hear that you
 appeared in the song to be named Cathy. Is that right? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, very much so, yeah. She was definitely the character in that song. 
</P>
<P>I: What was your choice to sing at the time? 
</P>
<P>K: It has always been a story that fascinated me, but I'd not actually read
the book.  And the year before last I read it and it was sorta standing over
there ... I just  had to write the song. And I think to a large extent I did
side with Cathy because  it's my name and when I was child I was always called
Cathy, not Kate. And it  just seemed to be the thing to do. 
</P>
<P>I: And I am told that was your first single. [Inaudible ???] you have a very
unusual  singing voice, it's very high. Did you deliberately choose something -
a song with  an unusual theme and was sing [Sic - sung] in an unusual voice in
order to catch  attention, because that's important these days isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. To a certain extent that way why it was chosen, but it just seemed
the right  song, more than the fact that it was [??? dancing]. It just seemed to
be the  strongest song. 
</P>
<P>I: How do you get up that high. 'Cause you haven't got that high of voice
when you  talk, normally. Is it difficult for you to sing like that? 
</P>
<P>K: Not really, no. It's just the way it happens. That song said to me that
it should be  sung high, so that's why I did it. I think [??? inaudible] singing
that high, but  there you go. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Well [??? if the Good Lord] in good stead. Now, you left school when you
were  sixteen, like a lot of people. Did you at that point want to become a pop
star? Had  you set your sights on that, or did you want to do other things? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I've never really wanted to be a pop star. I've always wanted to do
my  music and just be creative with my life in that way. And one of the reasons
I left  school was to do that, I just felt that I had to do brave and see if I
could do it. And  that's what I did, I left school and took up dancing and took
[??? serious]  dancing class. 
</P>
<P>I: Well took up dancing, now what sort of dancing did you do? 
</P>
<P>K: That was inspired by a [??? fellow] in London. A mime artist called
Lindsay  Kemp. And I'd never seen anything like and I'd started taking up his
lessons in  modern dance and a bit of ballet, I didn't really get on with ballet
that much. But  [girls at sixteen ???] were just the same as [??? inaudible]. 
</P>
<P>I: Another [??? inaudible] 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: What was it about that that appealed to you? 
</P>
<P>K: I couldn't believe how strongly Lindsay communicates with people without
even  opening his mouth. It was incredible, he had the whole audience in his
control,  just with his little finger. And it was amazing. I'd never seen
anything like it, I  really hadn't. And I felt if it was possible to combine
that strength of movement  with the voice, then maybe it would work, and that's
what I've tried to do. 
</P>
<P>I: Is the more you [??? inaudible] what you know about movement, important
to you.  Do you think what you look like on the screen, the television screen,
is [as]  important as what you sound like? 
</P>
<P>K: Very important, yeah. I think it's vital because, especially when you're
doing  songs, it's important that you give them something to see. I mean when
they hear  the records their mind can just become whatever they want. They can
make the  song personality whatever they wish. But when they see it, they have
to have  something strong I think and it should be really adequate to the
movement. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, now between sixteen and nineteen you were learning about dance and 
mime, but you were also writing songs. How did you [??? inaudible]? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, when I left school I already had a contract with EMI and that was
really  why I felt brave enough to see if I could just sorta develop myself.
Because in  school, you really are very unaware of the world. And it's only when
you leave  school that you start of learn about it. And it did me a lot of good.

</P>
<P>I: [Laughs] Your father's a doctor in Kent. Now what did you parents think
about  this, did they think it was a slightly weird world that you wanted to get
into, or  did it [matter for it ???]? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, they were worried that I was leaving school without something
definite to go into, as all  parents would be. But they could see that I was...
that I really wanted to do it and  that I wasn't just wasting time, I was being
disciplined in my work. And now  they're very happy. 
</P>
<P>I: How do write your songs, Kate? You have a piano, the piano that we hear
on the  records is you playing... 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it is. 
</P>
<P>I: But how do you actually sit down and create a song? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, it's normally at night. I think that's definitely the time to
create, for me it  is anyway. And I have to be with the piano, I have to be
alone. And normally I've  got some kind of an idea, some sort of subject matter
to write about before I sit  down. And I start playing the chords and whatever
chords you play have a  completely different feeling. So it just tells me what
[the sounds are ???] 
</P>
<P>I: Major chords and minor chords. 
</P>
<P>K: Right. You know, like happiness and sadness, this or that, those really
talk to you.  And one [??? inaudible] write the music, so it has a little
control over me. 
</P>
<P>I: I realize in your songs... they're very elliptical [??? inaudible] the
first time  around. And I'd like to play an example of that off your new record.
It's called  Symphony In Blue, and play a little bit and then one can tell us
about how you  wrote it and why. 
</P>
<P>[Symphony In Blue is presumably played] 
</P>
<P>I: ...&quot;the head of the good soul department&quot; and then the chorus
goes on to say &quot;I  see myself, suddenly, on the piano as a melody. My
terrible fear of dying no  longer plays with me. So now I know that I am needed
for the symphony.&quot; Now  those sound like wise old words when you were what,
nineteen years old when  you wrote it. What did you mean by that, &quot;I see
myself on the piano as a  melody?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think really, for me I feel that my purpose here is to write
music, it's the  only thing that I can do where I can really let myself go,
where I can  communicate with masses of people. And I'm just saying that it
gives me great  comfort, whenever I'm at the piano, because for the few times
that it happens I  feel that I'm a part of something. 
</P>
<P>I: And [??? that's the line] the feel of dying, at your age!? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, yeah! I mean everyone. I think it's a very, very basic human thing
you know,  to fear dying. It's totally unknown and it's something that stays
with you from  the moment you first hear about someone dying, you know. You have
no idea  what will happen, and it's inevitable. And in a way that is a [???
inaudible] fear  that [we ???] in this life, we know we're going to die. And I
think it's  fascinating. I think everyone at some point seems to have a purpose
and think  that's really necessary. 
</P>
<P>I: And the songs [??? inaudible] autobiographical. Now the way you promote
them is  interesting, because you haven't yet appeared on a personal appearance
tour  anywhere, have you? 
</P>
<P>K: No. 
</P>
<P>I: We see you mainly on telly and Top Of The Pops [??? inaudible] films. How
do  you actually go about making these films, cause it's very interesting. This
is a  new way, really, or promoting pop, isn't it. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes it is. The amazing thing about it is that through a day's work, you
can reach  millions of people, it can go all over the world. But with a personal
performance  you have personally go to all of these places, and obviously it
takes a lot longer.  And I think it's an incredible breakthrough. [???
inaudible] and it's just  amazing, we have great fun doing it, and it's fun. 
</P>
<P>I: What about the thought though, of the big tour that you're going to do,
starting  April, right through the United Kingdom and on to the continent. Does
it scare  you? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it makes me nervous, anxious. But it also makes me very excited and
very  happy. It's something I've always wanted to do. I think so far I've been 
considered more of a recording artist than a performer and I think it's very 
important that you can try and give [??? inaudible] to be with the audience. And
 I think it's got to be one of the very special moments in the world. 
</P>
<P>I: But I wonder if the whole pop world isn't a bit scary [??? inaudible]
who's only  just twenty and who's only had a year in it, and it really riddeled
with stories  about drugs and bribery and corruption [???]. Now is that kind of
thing  something that you've really touched on, or does it frighten you? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I think that as far as me being twenty, it's, you know obviouly I'm
young,  but maybe this isn't my first time 'round, you know? It depends how you
look at  it. Personally, I'm not really worried [???] that much. I mean
obviously with  certain things, I am aware of them. But I don't consider myself
to be that age  and I cope with things as they come. And I think it's the same
as the pop  business, it's how your attitude towards it is, as to what you get
back. And  there's alot of things you can promote and push away and it's totally
up to you to  get the things [??? inaudible] 
</P>
<P>I: [??? inaudible] young lady. 
</P>
<P>K: I how so yeah, I like to think so. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate, you choosen [???? inaudible] now why's that? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's a really beautiful piece of music and [??? inaudible] and
it's just  beautiful. 
</P>
<P>[A piece of music is played.]
