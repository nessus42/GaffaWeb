<p>Twelve years is a long time to wait for a new single -- so long that when 
Kate Bush announced that her first album since 1993's The Red Shoes would be on 
the release schedule for 2005, critics had to explain to everyone under 25 that 
she did more than that video with her and Peter Gabriel serenading each other in 
the moonlight. </p>
<p>The famously melodramatic (some would say screechy) chanteuse's influence on 
such singers as Björk and PJ Harvey has come full circle on &quot;King of the 
Mountain,&quot; currently available only as a download. The rumbling bass and 
propulsive drumming recalls Harvey's &quot;A Perfect Day, Elise,&quot; while Bush takes 
her creepy torch-song vibe down a notch, mostly reining in her upper register to 
devastatingly intense effect. Learning how to smoulder is the final frontier for 
great singers, and Bush does it without giving up the vulnerability that made 
every teenage wallflower in the '80s stare longingly at her LP jackets. Damn 
that Peter Gabriel. Damn him to hell.</p>

<p>What could a piece of music possibly do to justify a 12-year wait? For 
starters, it should sound unaffected by anything released in the interim but 
without being so insular that it cannibalizes the artist's previous work. And it 
should resist providing easy gratification because the listener shouldn't be 
entirely sure what the lyrics are about or how the mood can turn from haunting 
to whimsical or why a reggae beat materializes halfway through. Then it should 
mete out that gratification slowly, after each listening. Just like this song 
does.</p>

(3 1/2 stars out of 4)<br>
CD of the week<br>
<br>
In pop music, absenting yourself for a dozen years is like a novelist or painter 
vanishing for 60, the field changes so much. After British legend Kate Bush 
released her worn-out-sounding 1993 album The Red Shoes, she retreated to her 
island home on the Thames to have a child and generally depressurize from a 
storied career. It began with her discovery by Pink Floyd guitarist David 
Gilmour at 16, took off with a stunning 1978 hit based on Emily Brontë's gothic 
romance Wuthering Heights, and peaked in 1986 with the album Hounds of Love, 
which finally gained her recognition in America.<br>
<br>
During her hiatus, rap conquered the world. Alt-rock and techno, among others, 
came and went. A generation of female singers emboldened by Bush's fearless 
experimenting and brainy eroticism emerged, such as Tori Amos, PJ Harvey and 
Bjork, although they weren't alone -- hip-hop innovators Outkast also called her 
their inspiration, the Futureheads had a hit covering Hounds of Love's title 
track, and Mercury Prize-winner Antony credited her impact.<br>
<br>
Now Kate Bush is 47, looking less like the modern-dance nymphet she once was 
than like a kindly English aunt. Her return album, Aerial, is finally being 
released after years of rumour. And seldom has &quot;released&quot; seemed such an apt 
term, since EMI kept it as tightly locked up as a royal consort in the Tower of 
London.<br>
<br>
But suddenly very little of that back-story matters, for Kate Bush Land turns 
out to be barely changed. She seems relaxed and renewed on Aerial, but it's full 
of the touches that enraptured her fans and made the prigs label her barmy. 
There's the song in which Pi is sung to more than 100 decimal places, and the 
one about the washing machine. That's actually one of the album's finest, 
movingly tracing mortality and loss through the domestic poetics of laundry. 
Sure, the passage where she sings &quot;slooshy slooshy slooshy slooshy&quot; can bring 
giggles. But Bush knows when she's being funny.<br>
<br>
She remains preoccupied with English landscape in its mystic and sensual 
aspects, and now as a familial setting too. The second disc of Aerial is a cycle 
titled A Sky of Honey, a dappled portrait of a summer day from dawn to nightfall 
to dawn again, with particular lingering on birds and sea. With arrangements by 
the late Michael Kamen at Abbey Road Studios, it shifts from Joni Mitchell-ish 
jazz to hard rock to Gypsy Kings to histrionic chorales in a genre known only as 
Kate Bush, and back. But ultimately it does, as she sings, &quot;become panoramic,&quot; 
immersing the listener in colour and more than earning its grandeur.<br>
<br>
As it has many songwriters, however, parenthood seems to have lured Bush toward 
less distinctive subject matter. The Elizabethan-madrigal-style paean to her son 
cloys as much as it charms, and other lyrics skirt platitudes that would have 
been unthinkable when she was a quizzical, precocious youth. But the steeped 
richness of her voice and inventive melodies mostly prevent banality.<br>
<br>
The greater misgiving is that Bush, famously an early adopter of new samplers 
and synths in the 1980s, has added so little to her palette here. Aside from the 
first single, King of the Mountain (a winking ode to Elvis, Citizen Kane and, 
ahem, other famous recluses), Aerial sounds almost like it would have a dozen 
years ago.<br>
<br>
On some tracks, such as the otherwise vivid How to Be Invisible (the recipe: 
&quot;Eye of Braille/ Hem of anorak/ Stem of wallflower/ Hair of doormat&quot;), dull 
production obscures the virtues. It's a relief when the collection returns to 
just Kate and her piano, on her sumptuously forlorn tribute to her mother, A 
Coral Sea. Yet how much more thrilling it would be to hear her explore some new 
technology.<br>
<br>
But that could take another dozen years. What we've got is this flawed but 
ecstatic experience, Aerial. And once again, nearing 50, Kate Bush is making it 
sound like most other singers just don't know the secret of life. Listen close.</p>

<p>(3 stars out of 5)</p>
<p>Next to Joni Mitchell, few female artists would be hard-pressed not to cite 
this U.K. siren as an influence. And after virtually disappearing off the face 
of the planet, Kate Bush's first disc in 12 years finds her using a backdrop of 
aural grandeur whilst regaling in hushed fashion all the numbers that make up 
pi. Really, 3.1415927 never sounded so ethereal and simultaneously strange.<br>
<br>
Domestic life also is central to Bush's existence on the first of two discs Bush 
calls A Sea Of Honey, which features her exquisite ode to her baby boy Bertie, 
juxtaposed with Mrs. Bartolozzi, on which housecleaning and use of a &quot;washing 
machine&quot; get turned into an exercise on making the banal sound so sensual.<br>
<br>
On the second disc, titled A Sky Of Honey, Bush's lyrics translate to little 
more than reflections on a painter (An Architect's Dream, The Painter's Link) 
and minimalist descriptions of her many strolls (Sunset, Somewhere In Between), 
but musically she transcends this with multi-layered instrumentation (especially 
the dreamy Nocturn) sprinkled with the odd recorded bird chirp or two.<br>
<br>
Fact is, Aerial wouldn't be such a welcome return of Kate Bush if Aerial were 
anything but eccentric and densely lush.</p>

<p>The new Kate Bush album includes a song called &quot;How to be Invisible,&quot; a 
subject the iconic '80s songstress should know a thing or two about after a 
dozen years spent out of the spotlight tending the home fires.<br>
<br>
Aerial, Bush's first album since 1993's indifferently received The Red Shoes, 
rewards fans handsomely with a sonically sumptuous two-CD set that is seamless 
without sameness.<br>
<br>
The aforementioned &quot;How to be Invisible&quot; on the first disc, &quot;A Sea of Honey,&quot; is 
a groovy, guitar-layered incantation in which the refrain sounds like an 
alternative recipe from the Macbeth cookbook: &quot;Eye of Braille/ Hem of anorak/ 
Stem of wallflower/ Hair of doormat.&quot;<br>
<br>
A couple of tracks earlier, Bush channels the Elizabethan era in an entirely 
different way, employing viols and vintage guitars and percussion to lend 
courtly neo-Renaissance flavour to &quot;Bertie.&quot; Given that the song is an unabashed 
paean to her 7-year-old son and includes verses such as &quot;Sweet kisses/ Three 
wishes/ Lovely Bertie&quot; and &quot;You bring me so much joy/ And then you bring me/ 
More joy,&quot; it might easily be tooth-achingly sweet, but the delicacy of the 
arrangement and Bush's ethereal singing produces a result that is more angelic 
than saccharine.<br>
<br>
Sandwiched between these two offerings is the masterful &quot;Mrs. Bartolozzi,&quot; in 
which references to the mundane &quot;sloshing&quot; of a washing machine are juxtaposed 
with images of the sea, all gorgeously underscored by piano, an approach that 
also elevates the first disc's elegiac closer, &quot;A Coral Room.&quot;<br>
<br>
The companion CD, entitled &quot;A Sky of Honey,&quot; is a 43-minute song-cycle laced 
with birdsong and more of Bush's impressionistic piano playing, particularly on 
&quot;Sunset,&quot; which adds jazzy, upright bass. On &quot;Aerial,&quot; which closes the set, 
birdsong, laughter and strings are layered in a minimalist exercise that sounds 
like something Steve Reich might have come up with in a momentary flight of 
whimsy.<br>
<br>
The second disc is less varied and musically captivating. Taken on its own, it 
might have engendered a more lukewarm response. But the two discs complement 
each other in a way that succeeds in making an impressive comeback that much 
more beguiling.</p>

<p>(4 stars out of 5)</p>
<p>Unlike her most obvious acolytes (Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos), you won't find 
elusive and operatic British chanteuse Kate Bush dumbing down her out-there 
sound to appease an aging demographic of elfin waifs turned minivan moms. Fans 
will be over the roof about Aerial, which, more than a decade after her last 
album, stays true to the whimsical and wacky Bush of yore. In her two-part opus, 
Bush first celebrates the magical and maddening aspects of domesticity, 
savouring the 'slooshy slooshy' noises of a washing machine and cooing 
(embarrassingly) over her wee son's darling smile, then launches into flight 
with part two (A Sky Of Honey), where songs about painters and the country 
landscape bleed into each other in a conceptual set piece. Bush's voice is as 
squiggly and captivating as it was early on, and though the production can sound 
awfully dated (there's some bad faux Peter Gabriel action going on), it seems 
somehow suited to the otherworldliness of Bush's keen, fantastical observations.</p>

<p>(4 stars out of 5)</p>
<p>With its references to Elvis, Orson Welles' hero in Citizen Kane and Walt 
Disney's frozen head (I may be guessing at that last one), Aerial's opener &quot;King 
of the Mountain&quot; is a cryptic riposte to anyone who thought Kate Bush was 
permanently AWOL. That the same song splits the difference between an airy Pink 
Floyd soundscape and Jamaican skank suggests the 12-year layover has done little 
to diminish her powers. Paeans to motherhood (&quot;Bertie&quot;), housework (&quot;Mrs. 
Bartolozzi&quot;) and mathematical calculation (&quot;<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font>&quot;) 
are all equally beguiling, as Bush juxtaposes the careful precision of the sonic 
textures with a spirit of playfulness largely absent in 1993's overstuffed The 
Red Shoes. The mood darkens on disc two, a linked set subtitled &quot;A Sky of 
Honey.&quot; Though the mellow musical settings sometimes lack the overt quirks that 
enrich disc one, the slim narrative thread about a painter's struggle to touch 
the sky proves to be effective and moving. Fiona Apple should study closely -- 
there will be a test on this.</p>

<p>(3 stars out of 5)</p>
<p>The initial shock comes from the screamingly obvious: one of rock's beautiful 
eccentrics has emerged from a 12-year hiatus without anything to say. The first 
of two discs includes borderline-embarrassing lyrics about her son and doing the 
laundry while the second is an uninspiring song cycle that chronicles the 
progress of one day, from afternoon to dawn (flashback: the Moody Blues, 1967). 
On a musical level, the project is more interesting - but only intermittently 
so: Bush is at the top of her quirky game on tours-de-force like King of the 
Mountain and How to be Invisible, but too much of Aerial is instrumentally 
tepid, while Bush's worst tendencies come out in some meandering piano ballads. 
It should have been better.</p>

<p><span class="title">(4 stars out of 5)<br>
(Effort: B+)</span></p>
<p><span class="storybody">First off, this is not an album that rewards casual 
listening. Anyone familiar with the work of Kate Bush will know that she is a 
dense lyricist, someone who writes songs that demand to be teased apart, 
yielding their thematic concerns only to the most patient of listeners. And 
thats when she waits three or four years between albums.<br>
<br>
So it would be fair to say that, 12 years after the release of Bushs last 
album, Aerial is a very dense and multi-layered work. With a sensibility thats 
somewhat like Sarah Slean or Tori Amos  that is, charmingly eccentric, but very 
musical  Bush is noted as a perfectionist. You can be sure that this album is 
exactly the way she wanted it, with all of its odd little grace notes.<br>
<br>
Bush tucks a myriad of references into her songs, and this album is chock-full 
of them, with Elvis, Citizen Kane and Joan of Arc all making appearances. And 
theres a recurring motif of birdsong thats no less mystifying for all its 
pervasiveness. <br>
<br>
Even the cover art  which looks for all the world like a mountainous island 
chain reflecting off the ocean at sunset  is actually a waveform representing 
birdsong. The resulting album is somewhat like those odd CDs that mix classical 
music with nature sounds. Its soothing in a way that doesnt necessarily make 
you drowsy.<br>
<br>
Although theres not really that much music here, Bush has chosen to release it 
on a double CD. Its a nice throwback to the days when albums had an A-side and 
a B-side. And, befitting an artist of her stature, the B-side isnt just rejects 
from the A-side, its a whole other album, with its own feel. The second CD is 
much more folksy and poppy, although its here that youll find most of the 
birdsong as well. <br>
<br>
At times, Bush seems so out of touch with mainstream music that its impossible 
to discern what message she thinks she might be getting across. Then, later in 
the same song even, everything just explodes into a guitar-driven riff that 
would sound at home on almost any contemporary album. <br>
<br>
Overall, the effect keeps the listener off-balance, always waiting for the next 
surprise. Which is probably exactly the way Bush intended it.</span></p>

<p>The test of good vocalists, or so the saying goes, is that they could sing 
the phone book and make music from it. Kate Bush doesnt tackle the London 
directory on Aerial, her first release in more than a decade, but she does sing 
pi to the 117th decimal point, and its as captivating as any Italian aria or 
gospel classic. Shes a great singer.<br>
<br>
Bush is vulnerable, however, to accusations that shes not a great songwriter. 
Aerial offers ample ammunition to those who find her pretentious, solipsistic, 
or opaque, and there are indeed moments, especially on the first of its two 
discs, when her smug domesticity gets uncomfortably cloying. Bertie, an ode to 
her son with guitarist Dan McIntosh, should probably have been left in the 
nursery, and Mrs. Bartolozzi, despite its rapturous melody, treads perilously 
close to condescension in its portrait of a lonely housewife. <br>
<br>
But were quibbling here. King of the Mountain and Pi, which together open 
Disc One, are perfect examples of that rare commodity, intelligent rock: like 
the best of Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd, they combine forceful rhythms with 
expressive singing and expansive harmonic structures. And How to Be Invisible 
adds an unexpected dash of self-mocking humour; the famously agoraphobic Bushs 
recipe for recluse tonic includes eye of Braille, hem of anorak, stem of 
wallflower, and hair of doormat.<br>
<br>
Disc Two is divided into nine discrete parts, but its really one long, pastoral 
dream, and again cynics will have fun with some of the singers lyrical 
conceits. Where, they might ask, is life all birdsong, honey, and flowers? 
Nowhere, perhaps, except in the green England of Bushs imagination. Her true 
gift, however, lies not in lyric-writing but in the creation of atmosphere, and 
the gorgeous narcotic haze that permeates this journey from dawn to dusk and 
back to dawn again will soon persuade most listeners to recline on the grassy 
sward, watch the fleecy clouds drift by, and await the magic of night. Its an 
exquisite trip.
