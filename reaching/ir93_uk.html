clive@mdis.co.uk (Clive Backham) <BR> Subject: Kate on the Radio (UK) Aug. 1993

</P>
<P>As I was driving in to work this morning (Aug 16th), I turned on the radio
and  what should be playing but &quot;Rubber Band Girl&quot;. I guess I came in
about half way  through. Initial impressions: well, I prefer Moments of
Pleasure. Hell, I even prefer  Rocket Man. The main problem is the drums. They
are frankly boring and annoying.  If it's not a drum machine, the drummer is
trying his best to sound like one. 
</P>
<P>(BTW, I will at this point admit my heresy and say that I have the same
problem  with the drums in RUTH, and have never much liked that track. There
I've said it  now. I feel much better :-) 
</P>
<P>Back to &quot;Rubber Band Girl&quot;. It sort of reminded me of &quot;Ken&quot;
 in parts. Is this the one Prince is on? It sounded like it could be him on
guitar. The  single will be released in the UK on Sept 6th. The album will be
released on Oct 4th. 
</P>
<P>So far so good. Imagine then my surprise when it transpires that her
KaTeness  herself had dropped in unannounced and was being informally
interviewed between  the records that are played. You will appreciate of course
that my car radio/cassette  does not have a record function, so the following
quotes are from memory and are  unlikely to be the exact words. The DJ is Simon
Mayo, who has a rather wicked  sense of humour. Some people hate him, others
like him alot. In the following, all his  apparently stupid comments are
intentionally lighthearted: 
</P>
<P>SM: Now, you've only ever done the one tour, back in 1979. Are you going to
do  another one soon? 
</P>
<P>KB: I think it's extremely unlikely. 
</P>
<P>SM: Why? What happened on that tour to make you think, &quot;I'll never do
this  again&quot;? 
</P>
<P>	[Kate than gave the usual info about how it was very hard work but
enjoyable  nevertheless. Also the usual stuff about concentrating on studio
work. Then said  she had thought about doing a few shows to go along with the
album, but is now  planning a short film instead] 
</P>
<P>SM: Is this your way of saying that you will never tour again? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, maybe not *never*, but not in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>SM: Like, not in this millenium? 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes, I'll probably be like one of those comets that only comes round
every 99  years. 
</P>
<P>	[Another record played. &quot;Boomshakalak&quot;(sp?) by Apache Indian, I
think] 
</P>
<P>SM: There are alot of famous people on the new album, aren't there? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, there are alot of great guitarists. Eric Clapton plays on one
track, he plays  beautiful guitar. 
</P>
<P>SM: Eric?.... Eric Clapton? Yes, I think I've heard of him. 
</P>
<P>KB: And Jeff Beck plays on one track. I think I'm going for the full set. 
</P>
<P>	[I was hoping for some humourous reference to Jimmy Page, he being the
third  member of that famous club, but none was made] 
</P>
<P>	[Other records played. Other chat about why the album is called The Red
Shoes,  with the usual answers about Micheal Powell's film] 
</P>
<P>SM: What sort of music do you listen to these days, apart from 1FM, of
course, which  I'm sure you have on continuously. (Radio 1 FM is the station
this interview was  on). What gives you inspiration? 
</P>
<P>KB: I don't listen very much, because I spend most of my time making music.
I like  Talk Talk alot. 
</P>
<P>SM: Haven't thay just split up? 
</P>
<P>KB: Not as far as I know. I think they're making another album at the
moment. 
</P>
<P>SM: I guess you know more about these things than me. 
</P>
<P>	[Simon thanks Kate for dropping in, and mutters things about EMI publicity
for  failing to warn him. More records played] 
</P>
<P>SM: Kate, can you just sign this. Put something like, &quot;To Simon, my one
true love.  Love from Kate&quot;. [No audible response from Kate, who we assume
has left the  studio] 
</P>
<P>	[Next record played] 
</P>
<P>SM: Kate has signed my copy of Rubber Band Girl, &quot;To Simon, you old
git. Lots of  love, Kate&quot; 
</P>
<P>	I'm sorry I can't remember everything Kate said, but the above covers most
of  the salient points. Kate sounded her usual cheerful self. If anyone is
wondering  how Kate can just drop in on the nation's number one radio show (in
terms of  listening audience) and hang around chatting for about 15-20 minutes,
I have the  following observations to make that may not be apparent to those of
you in the  States: 
</P>
<P>1). British Radio, especially Radio 1, has a very informal style. I don't
think the live  shows are planned very much. 
</P>
<P>2). Whereas in the States, I believe Kate is basically unknown except to her
small  band of fans, in Brtiain she is dearly loved by huge numbers of people,
even  though most of them have only ever heard &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.
She commands  admiration and respect from nearly all sections of the public. I
would go so far as  to say that she is the first pop star to enjoy this since
the Beatles. (Cliff Richard  doesn't count, because he makes crap music).

</P>
<P>I thought I'd add a little to what Clive Backham wrote: 
</P>
<P>&gt; [Other records played. Other chat about why the album is called The Red
Shoes,  with the usual answers about Michael Powell's film] 
</P>
<P>Initially, when asked why the album was called The Red Shoes she responded 
with &quot;why not?&quot; which frustrated Simon a little bit but got a giggle
from Diane and  Rod (who do the weather and news respectively). 
</P>
<P>&gt; [Simon thanks Kate for dropping in, and mutters things about EMI
publicity for  failing to warn him. More records played] 
</P>
<P>He was referring to Kate's somewhat infuriatingly unhelpful answers, like: 
</P>
<P>SM: What can you tell us about &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; in relation to your
other albums. 
</P>
<P>KB: It's more recent. It's not as old as some of the other ones. 
</P>
<P>SM: Hhmmm. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about the album
other than  that it's not as old as the other ones. 
</P>
<P>KB: No. 
</P>
<P>I've Simon take the crap out of people for much less hassle than Kate gave
him.  He managed to hold back for the most part or maybe he wasn't on form
today.  Maybe he was in awe of her charm and couldn't bring himself to say a bad
word  against her... 
</P>
<P>Btw, RB was allegedly also played on Radio Forth this morning.
