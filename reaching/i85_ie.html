<p>Is Kate Bush news to you? 
</p>

<p>Despite well-known status since the late 70's in her English homeland, Kate Bush 
has had only a cult following - albeit a devoted one - in America. But this fall, when 
the single &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot; paced its way on to the U.S. 
charts and with her sixth [fifth] album, Hounds of Love hunting out lots of 
American Homes, her relative obscurity in these former colonies seems to be on the 
decline. 
</p>

<p>In England, success came early. So the story unfolds... At 16, she was &quot;discovered&quot; 
by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. She spent the next few years honing her 
talents, which culminated in her debut single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; hitting the top of 
the U.K. charts in 1978. (The song was later covered by Pat Benatar on her Crimes of 
Passion album.) 
</p>

<p>For singer, songwriter, keyboardist and producer Kate Bush, Hounds of Love 
appears to be serving two purposes: One, attracting new fans, and Two, for all her 
devotees, a welcome return from a few years silence. 
</p>



<p>I: Your music contains a lot of very strong emotions. For example, the hit &quot;Running 
Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot; is intense in that manner. Can you explain the 
emotions behind this song. 
</p>

<p>K: It's very much about two people who are in love, a man and a woman, and the 
idea of it is they could swap places... The man being the woman and vice versa 
and they'd understand each other better. In some ways talking about the 
fundamental differences between men and women, I suppose trying to remove 
those obstacles, being in someone else's place; understanding how they see it, 
and; hoping that would remove problems in the relationship. 
</p>

<p>I think emotion is really what music's all about. It's trying to emote to the listener, 
in some way that is effective, either to make them happy or sad. To me as a 
listener to other people's music, that's what it does for me though. There are 
pieces of music that just make me go &quot;Ohh...,&quot; they're just so good. They make 
you feel great or they make you feel very sad and nostalgic, and i think everyone 
has some kind of music that really makes them feel good. Does something for 
them. So I think that's the purpose, to emote the listener. So it's got to be about 
emotion, really, and expression. 
</p>

<p>I: Your music and lyrics do show you as a very emotional person. Like you're always 
thinking... there's always something churning inside of you. I would describe you 
as a serious person on that account. Is this correct? 
</p>

<p>K: I think I'm quite analytical and I think that's definitely what comes out in a lot 
of the songs. It's the analyzing of emotional situations. I think I&quot;m an emotional 
person - I think that's what motivates me. Definitely from some writing point of 
view, even in political situations when people say, &quot;You've written this. This is 
quite political.&quot; But for me, it's the emotional content of the political situation that 
effects me. I think that most people that are sort of intrigued by writing or 
creating on some level are sensitive to the emotional side of things. That's in a 
way perhaps what makes them write... A kind of insecurity. 
</p>

<p>I: Listening to the background vocals on Hounds of Love, they sound agonized, 
plaintive, and sometimes they're screams. The whole second side of the album, 
which you call &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; reminds me of waking at night in a cold sweat, 
you know, always thinking, &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; Seems like you tend to 
ponder on that. 
</p>

<p>K: I think that side is about that and that's great if you feel that. It's not what I 
experience myself, thank God, but it is very much about someone trying to make 
it through the night in the water - alone, scared, and not really knowing what's 
happening, but going through the experience and hopefully coming out the other 
side with an appreciation of what's really going on. So it's quite good if you get 
that image. 
</p>

<p>I: What songs on this album, or parts of songs, were inspirational flashes. You know, 
a lightning bolt hit you. What took work? 
</p>

<p>K: It's very much like that. You get a big burst and then it will all slow down and it 
gets very slow. And then you get... Uh, let me think... Well, &quot;Watching You 
Without Me&quot; was very quick. That was all done in two days, I'd say, the whole 
thing except for the orchestra that we put on during an extra session. But all the 
songs were put straight to master. I was actually writing in the studio, so there 
was no demo in the process. It was all being written straight onto master tape. So 
if that initial thing was good enough, it would be taken from there. It was 
incredibly quick. Some songs were written on the piano, so again they were quite 
quick, instead of me having to round up [a line was repeated here so their 
appears to be missing line here] the slow processes were technical. Technical 
things that slowed you down, or just trying to make ideas work that you thought 
could but didn't happen as quickly as you hoped, and you just had to be patient. 
</p>

<p>I: Your songwriting is self-taught. I've read where you went to the library to find 
books that would try to teach you how to put word to music. How did you finally 
learn, just by doing? Trial and error? 
</p>

<p>K: Well, I think from the word &quot;go&quot; it's been just a gradual process of teaching 
myself what worked and what didn't. It's just through practice, really. Any time 
you're writing a song, you're learning about some aspect of songwriting. 
</p>

<p>I: Regarding the types of sounds you get, how did you get that little part on &quot;Running 
Up That Hill&quot; that comes in first at the start of the song, after the drums and 
before the vocals? 
</p>

<p>K: That's the Fairlight and that was actually what I wrote the song with. That was 
what the song was written around. 
</p>

<p>I: And what about the altered voice at the end of the song, where you're singing, &quot;If 
only I could, keep [she actually says &quot;be&quot;] Running Up That Hill&quot;? How was that 
done? 
</p>

<p>K: That's just a heavy effect. 
</p>

<p>I: What effect is on there? Do you remember? 
</p>

<p>K: I guess I'll put &quot;I won't say.&quot; 
</p>

<p>I: You won't say? 
</p>

<p>K: No. It was just a combination of the engineer and myself. I think it's part of the 
thing of recording and there are so many limitations to what we do, to discover 
something interesting that perhaps people aren't really using... It's so quickly 
that people imitate things. You've got to hand onto them, I suppose. If you want 
to use them again. 
</p>

<p>I: Can you explain to me, as non-technical as possible, what the Fairlight is and how 
you use it? 
</p>

<p>K: For me, what is so good about it, is it's a machine you can sample any sound you 
want into it. Say, you can sample a car horn or a violin, and then just play it on 
the keyboard. It's useful not only for when you're writing a song, but also for 
any arrangements. For instance, if I want a brass arrangement in a song, I can 
play around on the Fairlight and get an idea of what I want by actually using a 
sound like brass. 
</p>

<p>I: I can see how it helps a composer, particularly you, you've got a studio in your 
home and you just go right in... but what do you think this technology will do to 
the recording industry and the making of albums in general? 
</p>

<p>K: I think it's a good thing and I think it's going to develop very much in the next 
couple of years. I think everything really is advancing to get superior sounding 
things so that there's as little noise as possible. I think it's probably going to have 
quite an effect. But I think synthesizer did. When synthesizer were introduced, 
music was so inspired by it, that the synthesizers were over everything. IT was 
quite a stampede, because yo have the medium, and I think probably the same 
thing will happen with the Fairlight. 
</p>

<p>I: Technology is certainly bringing good sounds and sophisticated features to 
keyboards in an affordable range. Do you see this as a whole big revolution? I 
mean, it's started now, but... 
</p>

<p>K: Yes. I think technically right across the board, not just in music, we're going into 
another stage. There's no doubt that things are just gonna go... You know, you 
think even in the last ten years things have really developed, that I think we're 
actually just on the front of a whole new world of technology. 
</p>

<p>I: Kind of scary. 
</p>

<p>K: I think all change is scary. And I think change can be very positive. 
</p>

<p>I: But it's still that unknown quantity, whether it's good or bad. 
</p>

<p>K: That's right, yes. 
</p>

<p>I: The reason for this inquiry is that I think your comments are particularly relevant, 
because you've been using this technology, the Fairlight, for years now. You were 
at the tip of the iceberg. I mean, I think you're one of the first people I knew 
who used it. 
</p>

<p>K: I think it's one of those instruments too that you'd learn to use hopefully in a 
separate way. There are some sounds on the Fairlight that are used so much now 
that most producers would steer away from it. Particularly people in the business 
know straight away - there's a kind of corny edge to it. 
</p>

<p>I: I was going to make a generalization about radio today and its effect on &quot;routine&quot; 
sounds... but it's hard to that because radio here is so much different from what 
radio is over there. 
</p>

<p>K: Yes! I know so little about &quot;the market&quot; here. You know, I just hear things from 
people. 
</p>

<p>I: That's good, ignorance is bliss. What I mean is, sometimes it's frustrating because 
everything is extremely formularized. 
</p>

<p>K: I understand you actually segment different kinds of music onto stations. You have 
soul stations and heavy rock stations... [In England, there is usually one station 
played a variety of contemporary music - IE]. 
</p>

<p>I: Exactly. Why do you think you broke in the United States now? Do you think it 
has anything to do with the difference in radio styles? 
</p>

<p>K: I don't know. I don't understand this market at all, you see. It's like you say 
thought, it's the question that in some ways you can't ask anyone, except the 
public. I presume they like and I think the consistency of rhythm makes it more 
accessible to people. Seems you've got a consistency of rhythm, people can dance. 
Dance is something people can relate to immediately, so I think that helps 
tremendously. But I can't help but feel it's because, hopefully people like it and, 
it's the first time there's been sufficient interest with real back-up from the 
record company promotionally. And that's all I can put it down to. 
</p>

<p>I: Right time, right place. 
</p>

<p>K: Right timing, yes. Right support. 
</p>

<p>I: You know, that's usually the way it happens, no matter what you do. 
</p>

<p>K: Absolutely.
