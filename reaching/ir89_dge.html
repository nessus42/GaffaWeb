<p>GG: George Gimarc here and joining us... Kate Bush. Hello Kate. 
</p>

<p>KT: Hi George. 
</p>

<p>GG: Its great to have you on the air with us. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well thank you, its very kind of you to ask me. 
</p>

<p>GG: Well you've got a fabulous new album out. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well I'm pleased. 
</p>

<p>GG: A very emotional album, as relationships can be I suppose. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well let's hope so. 
</p>

<p>GG: It seems to have that common thread throughout it - relationships. 
</p>

<p>KT: Yes, I think so. I think maybe most of my songs are about relationships, and 
always have been. It's just what I find very fascinating. 
</p>

<p>GG: Your critics might say that because you were discovered and signed so young 
that you never really had to deal with real life so that you kind of have a different 
view of things. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well I think you know, I wasn't famous that young. It wasn't like I was a child 
prodigy. But I guess you know everyone has to go into life in their own way and 
we all seem to have paths (?) chosen for us somehow don't we, that we don't 
necessarily have that much control over. 
</p>

<p>GG: Ya. 
</p>

<p>KT: So I've just been doing my life the way I do it (laughs). 
</p>

<p>GG: You also tend to lead what some people would say would be a rather secretive 
life. For between albums nobody sees you much and I mean people like to have 
their rock icons, their pop idols, out visible and gossip about them. But you seem 
to be a bit of a mystery. 
</p>

<p>KT: I am not a secretive person, but I am not a public person and for me what I feel 
is that my work is to go out to the world, but not me as a person. I am not a great 
personality, I don't want to be a TV personality. I am a song writer, I am a 
singer, and I want my music to go out to the world and that's what I want to talk 
to people about is my music. 
</p>

<p>GG: Well let's get straight into it then. 
</p>

<p>KT: (laughs) 
</p>

<p>GG: The Sensual World, top track of the album. I gotta think if there was ever a 
video for this that it would never get shown on TV. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well there is actually a video already made and it's been shown quite a lot on 
TV. 
</p>

<p>GG: Has it ? 
</p>

<p>KT: Yes. 
</p>

<p>GG: What's it basically, what happens in the video ? 
</p>

<p>KT: Well its really conveying what I feel about The Sensual World, which is that its 
an incredible planet that we live in. It has tremendous sensuality, the texture and 
the colours of everything that nature supplies is incredibly beautiful, and the song 
is about a character Molly Bloom stepping out of a book into the real world. So its 
the idea of how someone who's been living in a black and white two-D world is 
so struck by the beauty of our real world and in the video its really like one long 
journey through a wood with the elemental changes of the weather and the day 
and the night, really just celebrating the world that we live in. 
</p>

<p>	&lt; The Sensual World is played&gt; 
</p>

<p>GG: Its a shame you couldn't quote straight from Ulysses but its almost become 
more than that. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well thank you, that very nice. I mean obviously it was very disappointing for 
me that I couldn't use the original piece and I did approach for permission to use 
the words, but I was refused. So I had to actually rework it and I am glad to see 
that you think in some ways it might have, you know, changed the song into 
something else because that's what I feel. I feel that actually the lack of 
cooperation has turned the song into something else which is a positive thing. 
</p>

<p>GG: Its an incredible song, The Sensual World. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well, thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>GG: There's other elements on the album, that you know, when you put it on it just 
kinda swirls around your head and you just gotta kinda wonder about this. 
You've got... 
</p>

<p>KT: (laughs) What do you want ? 
</p>

<p>GG: Well, you've got like the Celtic elements in the music, then you've brought in 
Trio Bulgarka and who would've thought the two would fit together. But you've 
pieced them together and it works in a totally new level. 
</p>

<p>KT: (laughs) Well I'm so glad you think it works because obviously a lot of what I 
do is very experimental and its always a bit scary because you are never sure if its 
gonna work and when I was working with The Trio their music is so beautiful, I 
didn't want to spoil what they did in any way or belittle it by bringing it into 
contemporary music. So I am really pleased to hear, you know, when people say 
that they think it works. That's a great reward for me, and for them. 
</p>

<p>GG: How did you find them ? 
</p>

<p>KT: Well, I was very lucky. About three years ago my brother Paddy, who has 
always been into ethnic music and collected instruments from all around the 
world had got hold of this tape of The Trio and when I heard it I was devastated 
and I kind of listened to it for a long time before I thought wouldn't it be nice if 
I could work with them maybe on the next album and a friend of ours called Joe 
Boyd who releases their records in London put us in touch with people in 
Bulgaria. And we actually went to Bulgaria to meet them and we rehearsed for 
three days. Its one of the most incredible experiences I've had, you know, to 
meet them as people as well as musicians. They are so warm and affectionate, and 
they don't speak a word of English and we don't speak Bulgarian, but it just 
didn't seem to matter. The communication is on a very emotional level and it was 
great. I really hope I can work with them again. 
</p>

<p>	&lt; Rocket's Tail is played &gt; 
</p>

<p>GG: Wow, you know, its always a trip (?), every time a new album comes out its 
kinda there's a different set of sounds, a different something coming out. In fact 
one of our listeners called up, who's wondering if there's ever any hope for you 
to work with Liz from the Cocteau Twins (Kate goes AH !) sometime in the 
future. 
</p>

<p>KT: That's a great idea. 
</p>

<p>GG: It would. She has just done a song recently with Ian McCllough (sp?) where she 
actually sang lyrics (Kate goes UH !) which was something I had never heard her 
stray into and on your albums every once in a while you stray into singing 
non-lyrics, using the voice purely as an instrument. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well, I think the voice is an instrument, and its I think its good to experiment 
with all the instruments we have. 
</p>

<p>GG: On Walk Straight Down The Middle you've got some incredible things going on 
there. 
</p>

<p>KT: You like that ? 
</p>

<p>GG: Yeah. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well good. 
</p>

<p>GG: Its a fitting end for the album, you know it kinda bookends the album very 
nicely. Where do you come up with these things, where do you dig them from 
inside you ? 
</p>

<p>KT: I think its a very difficult question, that one, because making music is such an 
elusive thing. I guess with a song like that, that was very much just a matter of 
me playing patterns (?) and chords on the fairlight and I came up with the tune 
and then ofcourse Eberhard Weber put in his bass on, gave the song such a strong 
personality. It kind of took on a life of its own as most of these songs do. 
</p>

<p>	&lt; Walk Straight Down The Middle is played &gt; 
</p>

<p>GG: There's a song on the album that is finally a love song for lonely computer 
hackers (KT laughs). They have their own song now. Deeper Understanding. 
</p>

<p>KT: That's right. 
</p>

<p>GG: People are of course gonna think that you are a whiz on computers now 
because you've done a song about them, but what's the real truth ? 
</p>

<p>KT: It's kind of what you said, its about these lonely people in this modern world 
who more and more they are being encouraged to stay in their houses and watch 
television and not go out and not meet people but do it through computers all the 
time. And this song is about someone who spends all their time with their 
computer. They have a very steady relationship and they see very few people, 
have not much contact. And its the idea of them seeing an ad in a magazine for a 
program for people who are lonely and lost. And they send off for the program 
and when they put it into their computer it comes alive and its like, its like a 
visitation and what the computer is offering them is real love and basically this 
human being just can't take it (laughs). Its too much for them, its like trying to 
be killed by love. I suppose in a way this song is saying that this world is getting 
colder and getting more and more isolated. To experience love and affection is 
getting more difficult in the world we live in and its the idea of this person 
actually getting that kind of love from the coldest form of machine we have, 
which is the computer. 
</p>

<p>GG: But its still love. 
</p>

<p>KT: Ya, I think actually that computers could hold a tremendous amount for us in 
the future. I think they could teach us an awful lot about ourselves. I have a lot of 
faith in the potential for computers and our spirituality. 
</p>

<p>	&lt; Deeper Understanding is played &gt; 
</p>

<p>GG: I must confess one comic note on Deeper Understanding. I have a telephone 
that has the exact same sound (KT laughs) and the first eight or nine times 
through the album I was continually running up to get the phone and no one was 
there (KT laughs again). Two minutes later I'd do it again and I finally went, 
wait a minute that's on the record. 
</p>

<p>KT: Wow. 
</p>

<p>GG: It was running at such a volume that... 
</p>

<p>KT: That's great. The time you wanna worry is when you pick up the phone and 
there's a voice at the end going Hello George !!! 
</p>

<p>GG: There's another song with kind of a wry twist to it and I've heard a great 
story about this one and that is Head We're Dancing. 
</p>

<p>KT: Oh yes. 
</p>

<p>GG: What's the story ? 
</p>

<p>KT: Well its a very dark story and I really think its not a song I would write now, 
but it was inspired by a friend of mine who had been with someone he found 
absolutely fascinating. And the next day he said to the host who was that person I 
was sitting next to last night and they said that it was Oppenheimer, the guy 
who'd been involved in creating the bomb. And my friend's reaction was horror 
because he just really hated what this guy stood for. His feelings completely 
changed about the guy soon as he knew who he was. And I found that really 
interesting, that you could be with somebody fun and so charming but then find 
out at one point who they are, you know, its like a completely different story. So I 
was thinking of, you know, the fairy tale of little girls where they go to a ball and 
then they meet the charming mysterious stranger who turns out to be a prince. 
And I was thinking, really who is the worst person you can meet as a stranger, 
who is the embodiment of evil, you know the closest thing to the Devil. And of 
course really the only person that stands out there in modern history is Hitler and 
so its really saying that evil people can be so charming and its so easy to be fooled 
by people and its saying that how often evil comes in a charming guise. So its 
really just exploring that and I would be very worried if people were offended by 
the song. I really had no intentions to offend anyone. 
</p>

<p>GG: But then we might want to be careful about some of the very charming, smiling 
gladhands. 
</p>

<p>KT: I think so. Ya, watch out for the charmers, I'll reckon. 
</p>

<p>GG: I think there are a lot of people watching out for you. 
</p>

<p>KT: (laughs) Well they should. 
</p>

<p>GG: Is there something lurking in Kate Bush's heart that we have to watch out for ? 
</p>

<p>KT: Oh, I think there is something lurking in everybody's heart. It's good as well as 
bad, you know. Let's try and get the good out, alright ? 
</p>

<p>	&lt; Heads We're Dancing is played &gt; 
</p>

<p>GG: When you're writing songs, you're not embarassed about getting extremely 
personal and really baring yourself on your albums. 
</p>

<p>KT: That's really true, all art to some extent has to be personal and I think what's 
difficult is not handing that work out to the world but its having to then justify it 
and explain it to people. That's what is difficult. Then you are caught in a 
moment where you have to analyse it or somehow go back on moments that were 
long ago. It somehow takes art out of its context. I think really you should just go 
out to the world and be as personal as you dare. 
</p>

<p>GG: I have to ask because everybody is going to just, you know, come up the hill 
with torches if I don't. Is there going to be a tour ? 
</p>

<p>KT: I feel so embarassed at... and I feel so flattered that people keep asking. I just 
have been so much with making albums and I get so involved in what I do. The 
projects become longer and longer and I just haven't had the space to do this. 
And I would really like to at some point, but I can't promise anyone anything so 
that's what I can say and thank you so much for everyone wanting me to. 
</p>

<p>GG: Well thank you for spending some time with us Kate. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well, thank you George... 
</p>

<p>GG: Its been a real pleasure. 
</p>

<p>KT: ...really nice speaking to you. 
</p>

<p>GG: With you too and good luck with the new album. We'll be watching for the 
next. 
</p>

<p>KT: Well thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>GG: Not four years this next time, OK ? 
</p>

<p>KT: Oh, I hope not. 
</p>

<p>GG: OK, take care. 
</p>

<p>KT: All the best. Bye. 
</p>
