<H3>Kate hits the pop chart heights
</H3>
<P>Doctor's daughter Kate Bush got just the tonic she needed yesterday.</P>
<P>Her record, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; --  based on the climax of Emily
Bronte's novel --  toppled supergroup Abba from the top of the charts.</P>
<P>Kate, 19, who signed a recording contract with  EMI while she was still in
school, said at Heathrow Airport before flying to Paris: &quot;It's all happened
so quickly.</P>
<P>&quot;I've been writing songs since I was a kid and my family thought I
should make a record.</P>
<P>&quot;But I didn't think for one minute it would be such a success.&quot;</P>
<P>She said of her hit song: &quot;I tried to project myself into the role of
the book's heroine and, because she is a ghost, I gave her a high-pitched 
wailing voice.&quot;</P>
<P>Kate, who has also released an album, 
<EM>The Kick Inside</EM>, added: &quot;I find it very interesting to watch all
the things that happen when you get a hit record.</P>
<P>&quot;Because my craft is more commercially-orientated, it gets more
attention than that of somebody else, like a bank clerk, perhaps. I still find
it amazing.&quot;</P>
