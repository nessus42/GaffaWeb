Subject: TRACKS Interview Nov. 1989 
</P>
<P>[From the November 1989 issue of &quot;Tracks&quot;, Woolworth's music and
video  promotional magazine:] 
</P>
<P>Love, trust and Hitler 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush, the little girl who made it big, is now a woman on the eve of her
 seventh album. John Aizlewood discovers why she's so special 
</P>
<P>If Kate Bush were like her records, she'd be invigorating, interesting,
bold, brave,  and eternally hummable. She is, in fact, nice. 
</P>
<P>Not nice as in hippy-dippy or insipid or stupid, but the kind of nice which
means  she laughs a lot (even at your own unfunny jokes), chats a lot and looks
for the good  in everything. The woman with the child in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You can either lay an angry trip or you can lay a very intimate trip
on people.  There are so many emotional needs and if you can use music to bring
comfort that's  the ultimate thing you can do to someone. It's just that idea of
making people feel  happy or encouraged. Music should leave people with
something positive,&quot; she trills  in a squeaky voice that's almost huggable.

</P>
<P>As she sits in front of a mixing desk at the top of Abbey Road studios, Kate
Bush  doesn't even look like Kate Bush. She's dressed in jeans, trainers and a
jumper.  She's much too small to be a Mother Earth figure and she even resembles
a young  Nanette Newman. Not that she's a wide eyed innocent. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm tired of interviews already,&quot; she admits, having only agreed
to talk to a  select few in the first place. &quot;This is the part where I have
to be the saleswoman.  Having spent a long time on an album you want people to
hear it and know it's  there. I try to enjoy promotion and get it over and done
with.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The album in question is `The Sensual World'. Four years in the making, it's
 been a struggle. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wanted to take time off after the `Hounds Of Love' album. I wanted
to spend  some time at home, be quiet for a bit and try and think about what I
wanted to say.  I wrote a few songs but it didn't take me long to realise I
wasn't happy with them.  I went through a period where I couldn't write at all
so I spent a lot of time  gardening. I thought I'd lost it. I didn't have
anything to say and I didn't want to go  out. Nothing like that had happened to
me before. I went back to it bit by bit and  eventually worked it through.&quot;

</P>
<P>Her record company knew better than to push Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm left alone to work on albums. If there was any outside pressure
I'd  completely go under and probably have to be put away in an institution
somewhere.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The results are quite dark and dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Many of my friends have said things similar to that but what I'm
trying to say is  that if you're having a hard time, if things look really
rough, then don't worry,  everything's alright, someone will come and help you
out. From darkness and  dissatisfaction something really good can come. To get
something worthwhile often  you have to go through something difficult.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It sounds personal too. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it's my most personal album, although that doesn't necessarily
mean  autobiographical. For some reason I had a tremendous need to talk about 
relationships and it's my most female album too.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Hence the idea of a sensual world. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's right. The earth is a very sensual thing, it supplies us with a
tremendous  amount of sensual information although most of us don't see it like
that. We should  be able to reach out and touch things, feel grass under our
feet and look at the  fantastic world. It's not a hippy image, it's what we're
all meant to do. More and  more people appreciate this planet and maybe that's
because of some of the negative  things that have been done to it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sadly Kate Bush won't be following up her only tour, now a decade away. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I do think about it a lot. What's so silly is that I really enjoyed
the last tour. I  miss the human contact of an audience and I don't really feel
like a performer any  more. On the other hand, I was so tired after the last
tour, it would have to be very  special and I get very nervous. I'm scared too.&quot;

</P>
<P>For now then, it's just the records. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Right now, I'm just somebody who makes albums, and that's fine by me.&quot;

</P>
<P>[Inset pics of the album covers:] 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside (1978) 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd wanted to make an album for such a long time so there was a great
feeling  of achievement. I hope I've matured since then. Some of those songs
were written  seven years before the album appeared.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Lionheart (1978) 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was rushed and that was responsible for me taking as much time as
possible  over albums. Considering how quickly we made it, it's a bloody good
album but I'm  not really happy with it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Never For Ever (1980) 
</P>
<P>&quot;From here on there are big progressive steps. I was starting to take
control at  this point, making sure I had enough time and getting involved in
production.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Dreaming (1982) 
</P>
<P>&quot;My first production. A really difficult album to make. People thought
I'd gone  mad, the album wasn't warmly received by critics. People told me it
was a  commercial disaster but it reached number three so that's their problem.&quot;

</P>
<P>Hounds Of Love (1985) 
</P>
<P>&quot;The first in my own studio. Another step closer to getting the work as
direct as  possible. You cut all the crap, don't have all these people around
and don't have  expensive studio time mounting up. A clean way of working.&quot;

</P>
<P>The Whole Story (1986) 
</P>
<P>&quot;It wasn't chronological because we wanted to have a running time that
was  equal on both sides, otherwise you get a bad pressing. In America where I'm
not  very well known, they didn't realise it was a compilation!&quot; 
</P>
<P>[text box with pic of TSW cover:] 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World (a girl/woman on the threshold of life) 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's interesting. The subject matter is very much like that but it's
meant to  be a character from a book stepping into the real world. It's the
first time she's  been in a body.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Love and Anger (choral. Love isn't completely lovely) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Relationships revolve around love and anger. Being in love makes you
very angry  sometimes and there's two sides to everything. I must be honest
though, I'm not  really sure what I'm trying to say here.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Fog (lyrics of trust) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Trust? That's nice. It's paralleling being in a relationship with
learning to swim.  You're too scared to put your feet down but if you did you'd
find the water is only  waist high and you needn't have been frightened at all.&quot;

</P>
<P>Reaching Out (glorious piano. Instinct is a funny business) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you can't help but reach out and touch certain things even if you
think they  might hurt. When children reach out to touch parents it's a lottery
as to whether  they'll get a clip round the ears or a cuddle.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Heads We're Dancing (bleak and scary and menacing) 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's the darkest track on the album and not the sort of song I'd write
now. The  devil's task is to tempt and temptation has to be attractive. Hitler
is the closest  personification of evil and I mention him not to glorify but to
point out he was a man  who fooled a tremendous amount of intelligent people and
there's no way you could  blame anyone for being fooled by that man.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding (ghostly vocals. Some people are in love with machines)

</P>
<P>&quot;This computer buff sends away for a programme that says `are you
lonely? Are  you lost?'. He plugs it in and out come voices of angels. In our
city times we do have  less and less affection for each other and become more
and more isolated. Here is  something real and meaningful -deep love coming out
of a bloody computer!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Between a Man and a Woman (what do you do when friends are splitting up 
before your very eyes?) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Often it's not your problem. You have to do the right thing, whatever
feels right.  Modern relationships are plagued with these problems.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Never Be Mine (where sex and desire ooze forth) 
</P>
<P>&quot;How interesting! God, yes. .. you're absolutely right but it's not
something I was  conscious of at all. It's a desire to have something you can't
have, but in a lot of  cases if the dream came true it would be horrible. The
dream holds the fascination  and power.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Rocket's Tail (not what you might think) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Er no,&quot; (she finds this hysterically funny), &quot;a couple of
friends said this song was  very phallic. I was so concerned I tried to change
the `it was the biggest rocket I  could find' line but `the most expensive
rocket I've ever seen' wasn't quite the  same. It's just the idea that a rocket
is only there for three seconds but those three  seconds are lived fully and
totally.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This Woman's Work (from the She's Having A Baby film) 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was thrilled to be asked to do it. It was very quick and very easy
because  you're just telling the story. The film is a light comedy but the woman
is rushed  into hospital with complications in her pregnancy and it's the first
time something  real and heavy has happened to the father.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Walk Down the Middle [sic] (extra track on CD/cassette. Some people are very
 unextreme) 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a bit less worked on than the other tracks. It's about trying not
to get  caught up in extremes. My mother was down the garden when the funny bits
at the  end were being played. She rushed in and said she'd heard some peacocks
in the  garden! How sweet! I can't take the song seriously now.&quot; 
</P>
