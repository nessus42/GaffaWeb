<BR> Subject: Kate Bush interview in March, 1994 Spin magazine 
</P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">Kate Bush interview in March, 1994 Spin magazine:</H3>
<P>Kate Bush's fans are legendary for the intensity of their devotion. Actress
Laura  Dern is no exception. In an exclusive interview, the two artists talk
about love, work,  and perfection. 
</P>
<P>What do you say when someone has truly inspired you? How do you express to 
an artist how deeply their work has affected you? Well, for better or worse, I
just  had my opportunity. 
</P>
<P> I wanted to ask Kate Bush every obvious fan question in the book. I wanted
to  let her know how much her work means to me. I wanted to ask the right
questions. 
</P>
<P> I have no conscious memory of our conversation, because I went into some 
altered state of panic. Luckily, I realized that my duty of being Lois Lane,
reporter  extraordinaire, would get in my way. So I just tried to chat with
Kate. 
</P>
<P> With the release of her new album, The Red Shoes, Kate was in the U.S. for
her  first visit since 1989. She and I have both recently completed our
directorial debuts on  short films -- hers, a 50-minute feature, The Line, The
Curve and The Cross, which  links six of the new songs through a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P> How fantastic it was to speak with her! It was so unusual to hear that
magical  voice that I've heard singing into my inner ear (through headphones)
since 1985. I  remember first encountering Kate's music while filming Blue
Velvet. I listened to  Hounds of Love, and instantly felt I had found what I
always longed for music to be:  a discovery of self, a journey full of imagery
and passion; and now this voice, this  creator and I were having a conversation.

</P>
<P>SPIN: Tell me about your new short film, The Line, The Curve and The Cross.
I  understand that Michael Powell, the director of the old classic movie The Red
 Shoes, is a hero of yours. Is your film adapted from his? 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: It was something I thought of when we finished the album: to make
a  short film that would include some of the songs from the record but also tell
a  story. The only stuff I've worked on before has been short videos. 
</P>
<P>Spin: You've directed almost all of yours for years now. 
</P>
<P>KB: But I've never done anything like this before, and it was just such an
education  for me. I think the most demanding thing was being in it as well as
directing, and  I don't think I'd do that again. I found it very difficult
--just having the sheer  stamina. But what a wonderful experience, and it's so
different from making an  album because you've got this big group of people all
working together on  something that has to be done quickly and the albums are
almost completely  opposite to that. 
</P>
<P>Spin: I've read in interviews where you talk about how exciting it's been
for you in  the process of mixing, and I thought to myself, &quot;Oh my God, as
a director what an  exciting new world that must be for you, with all that you
can do with the visual  side.&quot; Were you like a kid in a candy store? 
</P>
<P>KB: To a certain extent, but we were very restricted by having no money and
so  little time. But some of it was so new to me -- like working with dialogue,
which  I found fascinating. I really enjoyed it. The film is meant to be like a
modern  fairy tale. We worked on it so intensely and it's not been finished for
very long,  so it's really difficult for me to know what people will think of it
and whether  they'll get a sense of story from it. 
</P>
<P>Spin: The thing I remember when I was a teenager and saw The Red Shoes was
the  struggle of this woman's: having to choose between being a dancer and being
 with her man. That the passion for love and the passion for dance couldn't 
coexist really affected me. I don't know what you think about that. I hope to 
believe -- well, I hope to believe a lot of things -- but I hope to believe that
we  can be consummate artists as women or revolutionaries, or whatever women
want  to be, and also have love, not only for ourselves but from a partner. 
</P>
<P>KB: I have to believe that too. It's just not fair to think that it's not
possible. But I  suppose the consuming nature of being obsessed with one's work,
or one's art, is  obviously something that we probably all struggle with to try
to find a balance. 
</P>
<P>Spin: In interviews, people always refer to you as this great perfectionist.
Do you  agree with that? Do you perceive yourself that way? 
</P>
<P>KB: Well, if perfectionist means taking a long time, then I would agree with
it. But I  really don't think that it's possible to make things perfect, really.
In some ways,  there's almost an attempt to try to achieve something that is
quite imperfect. Do  you know what I mean? And to be able to find a way of
leaving it with certain  raw edges, so that the heart doesn't go out of it. I
don't think of myself as a  perfectionist at all. 
</P>
<P>Spin: Critics, especially men, seem to describe women who are briliant at
what they  do as perfectionists or loners or difficult to get at. I always find
that so hilarious  because I think someone who is connected to their work must
be easier to reach  than others. 
</P>
<P>KB: I think so too, it's just that maybe they're going to be a little more
weary. 
</P>
<P>Spin: Do you struggle to balance your desire to keep a raw, spiritual edge
to your  music and a need to make the music accessible? Do you feel confident
enough to  just express what you believe and hope the audience catches up? 
</P>
<P>KB: There's kind of a driving force involved in the whole process of putting
music  together, to ultimately ending up with a finished album. I think there's
a lot of  stuff that I don't even question until other people come in and listen
to the music,  and it's almost like suddenly you're listening to things through
other people's  ears. I suppose that's when it gets a bit difficult. Sometimes
I'm aware that  things were actually a little more personal than I'd realized.
But I suppose I feel  if, when you are actually creating something, it feels
kind of honest, it feels good,  then that's the point where the intenion
matters, and then from that point  onwards it's just a matter of being brave
enough to actually let it go. 
</P>
<P>Spin: That's why I've always loved film more than theater, and film may be
more  closely related to making a record because you have that ability to go in
and do  your work and have no judgment around it, and feel honest. Then, much
later,  it's presented to people. But in theater, people come backstage after a 
performance and you're about to do the same play again the next night, and 
people say, &quot;Well, I didn't really believe that emotion&quot; or whatever.
It's really  hard for me, I like to be closed up and just do the work. 
</P>
<P>KB: That's a very interesting observation, I'd not actually thought of it
like that, but  you're quite right. Films are kept very personal for quite a
long time. 
</P>
<P>Spin: I've always been so curious to know if there are certain of your own
songs or  albums that you feel most proud of, or most connected to? 
</P>
<P>KB: I suppose, like most people, I tend to feel closest to the work I've
most recently  done. In a lot of ways, it's like extracts from a diary: If you
look back at things in  your past and consider events, it's like, &quot;Oh God,
no.&quot; You tend to feel differently  about things as you move through two or
three years. And I suppose also,  hopefully, you like to think that you are
getting better at what you do, more  mature in your craft. Quite soon after
that, there comes a point where you just  want to do something completely
different from the most recent piece of work in  order to shake it off. 
</P>
<P>Spin: Have you ever gone back and either thought about songs you've written,
or  listened to your music from years before, and learned something you hadn't 
recognized, or understoof something that at the time you didn't understand? 
</P>
<P>KB: I'm not sure I've ever reinterpreted something, but I have definitely
been able  to hear things in a different way from how I did at the time. I very
rarely listen  to any of my old music; it's the last thing I ever want to do.
But occasionally I end  up in a situation where I do, and if enough time has
gone by, I can actually hear  how I would do things differently. 
</P>
<P>Spin: But if art is a contribution, and I certainly know that your music has
been, the  one thing that I'm excited about as a listener is that you've been at
different  places in your life and have written pieces of music where you may
now think, &quot;if  I had only done it that way,&quot; but somehow the place
you were at allowed you to  write it that way and it affected people who were in
the same place. 
</P>
<P>KB: There was a reason for it happening then. 
</P>
<P>Spin: I've always wanted to ask you if you have interests in the shadow
side, in  understanding the repressed self -- things we are in denial about. 
</P>
<P>KB: Creative art is an awfully positive way of channeling the shadow side,
and I  think it's much more healthy to explore it and have fun with it within
the  boundaries of art. I'm not sure that it's something terribly good to go
looking  for. Do you know what I mean? I think it's actually something that ends
up  coming to you anyway.
