<P>Date: Tue, 3 Sep 85 01:46:04 edt <BR> From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus&gt; <BR>
Subject: Blitz magazine Sept. 85 (extracts) 
</P>
<P>There is an interesting article/interview with Kate Bush in the September 85
 issue of Blitz. It's a very nice article and gives you a very good idea of her 
personality. Some interesting quotes: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Taking so long a break made me realise what was important, which was
my  work much more than being famous. I did think it would be harder coming
back.  Actually, it's quite exciting, coming out to a Brand New World, meeting
people, not  being locked away... communication's a really important thing.&quot;

</P>
<P>The phrase drifts out like a wisp of smoke; she says it to herself as much
as to  me. 
</P>
<P>Did you miss it at all? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Actually... no. I didn't.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's almost a whisper. Then a smile. Like a secret. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I come out into the world like this, it's only to say, 'Here's
the album',  so I can get on with the next one. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Who do you do it for -- yourself, for family, some vague immortality... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure. It's very important for me that my friends and family...
It's  almost to say, 'I'm writing this and I want it to be as good as you'd like
it to be',  like choosing a present... The immortality of the music, it's an
extraordinary  concept isn't it? People say I'm a perfectionist, I insist on
things being right. But I  don't know that anything can be perfect. When you're
making it, though, you  know it's going to be like that *forever*...&quot; 
</P>
<P>She says it like a child: simple, astonished, overawed. She holds her
breath. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Is the single about the notion it might be better to be dead --'Doing a deal
with  God, get him to swap places', 'Running up the hill' to Heaven, to be where
He is? 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's a *nice* interpretation. It's very much about love, really,
trying to keep it  alive. I don't know that perfect love exists in any human
being but I don't think it  can be encouraged enough.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Certainly the impish, demure, modest, meek, very plaintive person I met
didn't  resemble the stern, impressively *disturbed* figure, clad in cloak and
crossbow and  proud, dramtic stare who stepped challengingly into the soft
smugness of the Wogan  show [where she performed RUTH -- Doug] the night before.
Nor the voluptuous,  ferocious creature who lies, breathless and abandoned, over
the next LP sleeve. I  wonder, turning the rumour on its haed, if it isn't in
fact the severe isolation of her  life rather than the greedy glare of press and
public that gets to her most. 
</P>
<P>Ooooooh! These interviewers get to hear the album and see the album cover
way  in advance! I'm so jealous! 
</P>
<P>There is also a little tiny bit on Kate Bush in the Aug 31 1985 issue of &quot;No.
1&quot;.  Basically they just printed a full page picture of her on the inside
front cover and  included the lyrics to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; on the
table of contents page. This  magazine seems very strange in that their average
reader (from the letters and pen  pal section) seems to be about 13 years old,
and likes Madonna and Duran Duran.  Yet, the editorial staff seems to go truly
enjoy insulting the likes of Madonna and  seems to really like Kate Bush. In the
letters section, there is a little picture of Kate  Bush dressed in her
Babooshka outfit with the caption &quot;Madonna? Kim Wilde? Huh!  Who needs 'em.
Kate Bush is back with a vengeance.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Any one understand this strange phenomenon?

<P>(This article was originally in Andrew Marvick's
<A HREF="../garden/index.html">The Garden</A>.)</P>
<P>                                  The Blitz interview
</P>
<P>     [The following interview first appeared in Blitz magazine in the fall
of 1985. Edited by Andrew Marvick.]
</P>
<P>     The strange thing when I meet Kate Bush is that she seems so
startlingly ordinary. Dressed in jeans, boots and sweatshirt, with little
make-up and a lot of charm, she is slightly 'sweet', very much at ease, pert and
perky, perfectly friendly. Her tiny tear-shaped face is one of bright delight
and then wan concern. She looks tired and rather plain until she smiles--sweetly
enough certainly to make the  thought of tackling the tickly, tricky subjects
(the validity of The Rumours, the calculation of her image, the spite and spit
of the Vermorels' book on her) too churlish to bother with.
</P>
<P>     She is sincere and considerate, enormously perceptive (she asks me if I
mind if she smokes but not if I want one). Huddled up on a cushion, she doesn't
look at all striking--neither frail waif nor seductive sorceress. She is sort of
gooey, er drippy, with a girlish soppy sense of humour (oh dear, forgive me). We
sit in a big bare room, a dance mirror along one wall, a large floral painting
[Surely he means florid? There are no flowers in the picture.] of a baby
floating out of a sewer-pipe in one corner and two Swedish chairs, a Spanish
guitar, a Delius record and ashtrays scattered around. A huge calm toy dog
watches us from one corner.
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's a really nice day today,&quot; she sings as she makes the
tea.
</P>
<P>She is terribly nice and looks like she hasn't got a care in the world.
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush has been away...somewhere--I don't really care where or doing
what but everyone seems to have heard something fantastic or drastic about
her--for nearly three years. But all the rumours--about break-ups and
breakdowns, loves and deaths, this and that--that drift round this business like
a nasty, unavoidable smell, all falter against her sunny charms and happy
confidence.
</P>
<P>     Are you happy? I ask her. [Christ what a dope.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;Ooh yes,&quot; she says with a childlike delight that could kill
any rumour.
</P>
<P>     She's very relaxed. When asked about a sex symbol she says three words:
&quot;Gosh&quot; and &quot;Klaus Kinski&quot;. We find she's still saying those
classic quaint hippy-isms she's so renowned and teased for. Things that are &quot;cosmic&quot;
and &quot;karmic&quot;, talking of &quot;new energies&quot;, the &quot;inspirational
forces of teachers&quot;, &quot;where we're at&quot;, or &quot;having built
myself as a person&quot;. Once she even tries to stop herself saying she had &quot;found
herself&quot;, but it slipped out. She doesn't care. It's all very fetching.
</P>
<P>      So she's been away, writing, dancing, building a studio, making a
slow, involved, neatly epic new album, watching videos, thinking...
</P>
<P>     &quot;There was some re-evaluation, yes. Taking so long a break made me
realise what was important--which was my work, much more than being famous. I
did think it would be harder coming back. Actually, it's quite exciting coming
out to a Brand New World, meeting people, not being locked
away...Communication's a really important thing.&quot;
</P>
<P>     The phrase drifts out like a wisp of smoke; she says it to herself as
much as to me.
</P>
<P>     Did you miss it at all?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Actually...no, I didn't.&quot;
</P>
<P>     It's almost a whisper. Then a smile. Like a secret.
</P>
<P>     Signing for EMI when she was, incredibly, just sixteen, Kate was number
one for four weeks with her first single, a centre of attention at nineteen.
With eleven hits, those fierce, fraught, erratic, erotic videos, the Pamela
Stephenson impersonations, the Vermorel book, the devotion and obsessions...she
has been ever since. One wonders about the effect on one so sensitive.
</P>
<P>     Can you stand the scrutiny?
</P>
<P>     &quot;By and large, yes. When it started I had to be quite strong. I
couldn't cope with it as well now as I did then. I've changed a lot since then.
I wasn't naive, no. I was more innocent then, but not the lost little girl the
press presented me as. They patronised me. [Just like Jim Shelley still does.] I
do get shocked by the attention, though. The way I work is very isolated. I
won't go out for months--literally--so there's definite culture shock when I do.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Are you shy?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes. I am. Not as shy as I used to be. I'm still fighting it.
Why? Oh, there's nothing good about being shy. It should never stop you from
doing things, especially on a work level.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Can you chat up people?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Oh...I don't know. That's probably when I'm at my most shy--in
social situations.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Her voice trails away, as if she'd almost forgotten my presence [The
last word is illegible in my copy].
</P>
<P>     Do you feel vulnerable, at a disadvantage, meeting people?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, not really. It's true a person's music says a lot about
them--is revealing--but that doesn't unnerve me.&quot;
</P>
<P>     How do people react to you? Do you frighten them?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think they're great, actually. Great. I do frighten them a bit,
though.&quot;
</P>
<P>     They think you're a bit strange?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, maybe.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do they take up the image...the sexuality...the strangeness...the...
</P>
<P>     &quot;The weird energies...?&quot;
</P>
<P>     A perfect phrase.
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, people are mostly very nice. Very gentle and positive,
mostly.&quot;
</P>
<P>     And are you a bit strange?
</P>
<P>     &quot;A bit, yes, I suppose.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Always at her most animated and cheerful when she's back in the world
of her work--the engineers, musicians, songs and studios and producers--Kate
Bush is already looking forward to the next two-year project. [This must be a
reference to the four-year project which ensued.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;When I come out into the world like this, it's only to say,
'Here's the album', so I can get on with the next one.&quot;
</P>
<P>     When she says the fame is enjoyable &quot;for the opportunities, the
doors you can knock and that will open&quot;, they're all to do with work. All
the &quot;really brilliant people&quot; it's taken her to meet turn out to be
engineers or musicians. She sees her best quality as being her ability &quot;to
work for long periods of time&quot;. She does, though, confess to a certain
conflict: &quot;Being shy and wanting communication, being a loner and liking
people. Feedback is very important to me.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Indeed, when I mention what a neat series of singles she's had (The Man
With the Child in His Eyes, Wow, Hammer Horror, Breathing, Babooshka, Army
Dreamers, The Dreaming, the cane-swishing Sat In Your Lap and the new one, a
most subtle, sneaky pop single, her most modern song yet [What on Earth is that
supposed to mean?]) she is positively overjoyed. She seems very easily--if quite
touchingly--pleased.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I can't tell you what a buzz it gives me for you to say that,
really&quot;, she gushes, clearly delighted.
</P>
<P>     She fends off the sticky business of her obsessive, fascinated
followers and the Vermorel episode with a mixture of calm and cuteness,
innocence and knowing, that says she won't be drawn into thinking about them.
[This and Shelley's earlier mentions of Kate's obsessive fans and Fred Vermorel
are references to V.'s two books &quot;about&quot; Kate and his third book, an
essay on the phenomenon of fans which contains some particularly nasty-minded
commentary about Kate's admirers. It's pretty clear that Shelley has taken
everything Vermorel wrote as the truth--a serious miscalculation. Kate herself,
true to character, is too polite to name names or contradict the insinuations
directly.]</P>
<P>     &quot;People say there are these people...I don't know what they mean&quot;
She insists, &quot;No, nothing that was written about me ever hurt me, no.&quot;
</P>
<P>She goes on: &quot;Music is such a powerful force. If people are affected by
my music the I was by...early Roxy, or Lotte Lenya or Sgt. Pepper, for
instance-- that, to me, is staggering. I can't relate to that at all.&quot;
</P>
<P>And maybe she can't
</P>
<P>     Who do you do it for--yourself, for family, some vague immortality...?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I'm not sure. It's very important for me that my friends and
family...It's almost to say, 'I'm writing this and I want it to be as good as
you'd like it to be,' like choosing a present...The immortality of music, it's
an extraordinary concept, isn't it? People say I'm a perfectionist. I insist on
things being right. But I don't know that anything can be perfect. When you're
making it, though, you know it's going to be like that forever...&quot;
</P>
<P>      She says it like a child: simple, astonished, overawed. She holds her
breath.
</P>
<P>     Kate admits she is very happy, agrees she's probably &quot;more stable
than I've ever been. I've certainly relaxed.&quot; When I ask her if she thinks
most about the past, present or future, she is pleased to say,
</P>
<P>&quot;The present. I think a lot less about the past now. Which is good.    
 I've always felt there are more happy things to life than sad, yes. I feel
that's the only way to survive. I've had a very happy life, especially when I
left school and was with Lindsay Kemp--it was so liberating. For the first time
I was an individual: mobile, free. I haven't found life very difficult, no. I'm
very lucky.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do things happen to you or do you make them happen?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I tend to believe that what you put out comes back. I think you
can make things happen.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What makes you happy?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, I have so little time. I don't have a manager so I'm always
organising things. Films amaze me--films like Don't Look Now, Hitchcock, The
Godfather-- totally, totally brilliant. The Innocents. I'm sure my love for
films will take me closer to them, although I don't know that I want to be in
them.&quot; [This interview took place before Kate began directing her own
videos.]
</P>
<P>     Is the single about the notion it might better to be dead--&quot;Doing
a deal with Good, get him to swap places&quot;, &quot;Running up the hll&quot;
to Heaven, to be where He is?
</P>
<P>     &quot;That's a nice interpretation. [Kate' usual way of saying it's an
incorrect interpretation, or at least not exactly the meaning she intended.]
It's very much about love, really: trying to keep it alive. I don't know that
perfect love exists in any human being, but I don't think it can be encouraged
enough.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do you think about death much?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, my imagination's got a lot of negative triggers. Images are
always much stronger when they're negative.&quot;
</P>
<P>     I've just had a day to think about Kate Bush, and she seems to me an
intriguing, strikingly strange affair. Certainly the impish, demure, modest,
meek, very plaintive [plaintive?] person I met didn't resemble the stern,
impressively disturbed figure, clad in cloak and crossbow and proud, dramatic
stare who stepped challengingly into the soft smugness of the Wogan show the
night before. Nor the voluptuous, ferocious creature who lies, breathless and
abandoned, over the next LP sleeve. I wonder, turning the rumour on its head, if
it isn't in fact the severe isolation of her life, rather than the greedy glare
of press and public, that gets to her most.
</P>
<P>     She talks of &quot;ringing friends after two years since the last album
was finished and being able to talk with them again.&quot;
</P>
<P>     She mentions with a touching but very fresh sadness, the death of Klaus
Nomi (who died two years ago at least) almost as if she'd just heard.
</P>
<P>     She says of signing to EMI at sixteen. &quot;It's quite normal these
days, though, surely. Bands, bands are quite young, aren't they?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It really is such a relief it is finished. I know the work has
arranged my life, but I'm very grateful, it's given me a lot. It's a little like
living life faster.&quot;
</P>
<P>      Is it so important?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's a very close second to my friends and family&quot; (that
constant, enigmatic phrase [enigmatic?]). She calls out to one of them:
</P>
<P>&quot;Would you say I have a separate life from my work?&quot;
</P>
<P>     &quot;Not at all,&quot; says the voice, &quot;but that's how it has to
be.&quot;
</P>
<P>     &quot;Your friends are the people you work with,&quot; she continues. &quot;I
don't think it's possible to have a social life...really.&quot;
</P>
<P>     She looks a touch apologetic, sounds rather vague, and the hint of
uncertainty drifing over the silence distracts us both. It strikes me then that
Kate Bush lives in a very small world, and at that moment, for no real reason, I
feel rather sorry for her.
