<P>Date: Tue, 28 May 91 00:04:54 PDT <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald
Hill) <BR> Subject: More Canadian Interviews 1985
</P>
<P>88. Good Rockin' Tonight, Much Music, The New Music, Toronto Evening News, 
etc.: excerpts from interviews (all dating from the same day, in the same
Toronto  studios) conducted by Christopher Ward, Nan Devitt and Daniel Richler
in late  November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>These interviews have a strikingly better atmosphere than their U.S. 
counterparts, which had been conducted only a day or two before. Much of the 
credit for this must go to the excellent interviewing techniques of the Canadian
 hosts, particularly Mr. Ward and Mr. Richler. Both men had prepared well for
their  interviews and both show evident respect for their guest on camera. Kate
responds,  consequently, with greater frankness and fluidity than she had in any
other  interviews of the 1985 promotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above note by IED. Boy does Kate look good in
these  interviews! ] 
</P>
<P>[Third interview - Good Rockin Tonight] 
</P>
<P>O: On behave of Good Rockin Tonight Nan Devitt talked to Kate about why she
left  school to study dance and mime. 
</P>
<P>K: I think that actual decision about going for it was just before I left
school and  that's why I left school. I didn't feel that I could get what I
wanted out of school  anymore in a way that was going to encourage me getting
involved with music. I  really had to leave and go into a more artistic kind of
lifestyle and dancing was a  particulary good one to choose I think. 
</P>
<P>	 Well, when I left school I knew very much that I wanted to go into the
music  business, that that's what I wanted to aim for. And I wanted to do
something  that would fill my day, that would be a good discipline for me, and
that would be  complimentary to the music. And dance was something that I'd only
just  discovered recently at that time. And I felt that there was a whole world
of  expression there that I'd never experienced and that perhaps the combination
of  that with singing would make an interesting performing vehicle. So I started
 training with a mine artist called Lindsay Kemp, who was a very big inspiration
 for me, and then started dancing at a school. And since then, though the videos
 the dance has been an incredibly useful thing for me. 
</P>
<P>[A portion of Wuthering Heights is played] 
</P>
<P>K: As I've gradually gone through the business I've become much more
involved in  other areas. And I've found that when I worked in the studio, there
we all these  areas that were connected to the song that were changing it in a
way perhaps  that I hadn't intended when I was initially writing the song. And I
felt that a  natural progression for me was to get involved in production, so
that then I could  take much more control over the whole thing and therefore end
up with a result  that I felt was my expression, rather than an indirect
expression through lots of  other people. And again that was a gradual thing,
where I went into  co-production, and finding that to be pleasing and quite
successful, went into  producing solely. 
</P>
<P>I: Since then you've built a studio in your home, can you tell me about
that? 
</P>
<P>K: That's right, again that was another sort of realization on the last
album. That as I  producing and getting closer to the whole thing, I found that
the way I'm  working now is so experimental, it takes me a lot of time, I like
to play around  with ideas. And in a commercial studio it's costing so much
money every hour  that I found that was becoming anti-productive, I was so
nervous, because I  shouldn't be taking so much time playing around with things,
that it was stopping  me trying things. And we felt the only way really to cope
with this was to have  our own studio and then also I'd be able to write in the
studio and just do as  much as I could there and make it all part of the same
environment. 
</P>
<P>[The Man With The Child In His Eyes is played] 
</P>
<P>K: During the gap between the last and this album, I'd seen quite a few
videos on  television, that other people had been doing. And I felt that dance,
something that  we'd be working in, particulary in the earlier videos in quite a
foreway, was  being used quite trivially, it was being exploited: haphazard
images, busy, lots of  dances, without really the serious expression, and
wonderful expression, that  dance can give. So we felt how interesting it would
be to make a very simple  routine between two people, almost classic, and very
simply filmed. So that's  what we tried, really, to do a serious piece of dance.
[Laughs] 
</P>
<P>[Part of Running Up That Hill is played] 
</P>
<P>K: I think until this album I've always treated them as individual songs,
and you just  work on one at a time, trying to do the best you can to get the
best atmosphere  across. But with this album I really wanted to try a conceptual
piece, something  I'd wanted to do for a while but hadn't really gone for. And I
felt rather than  making a whole of it, it would be interesting to have a side
that was conceptual,  and then make the other side a kind of counter-balance.
And it was a lot of fun  working like that, I'm so used to working on a piece of
music that's no more  than five minutes long. And although these are individual
songs, they're all  linked and they all have the same theme and atmosphere, so
you're definitely  working within one entity. And it was very challenging. 
</P>
<P>I: Buy you decided not to do the whole album as a concept. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think there were a couple of reasons for that. One, I'd felt that
half an  hour was a good length of time to get involved in a story. And I was
worried that  I wouldn't be able to make something sustain over a whole album
and that I  stood a better chance of doing that with one side of it. And also, I
wasn't sure if  was even going to work until I'd written a few of the songs. So
it made sense for  me to secure myself by witting a couple of other songs for
the other side while I  was working on that side. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: What do you think you'll do next? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know, it's a very strange point in time for me here, where I'm in
the  middle of promoting the album. And we'll be making videos for the next
singles  next year. And sometime during this period I have to decide what I'm
going to  do next. There are a few things that attract me equally. Going
straight into  another album is something that I have a lot of enthusiasm about.
And perhaps  turning the conceptual side of this album into a film, in an idea
I'm toying with.  So, I'm not sure, we'll have to see what I'm feeling like at
the beginning of next  year. 
</P>
<P>[Cloudbusting is played] 
</P>
<P>K: Hounds of Love is about someone who's scarred of falling in love with
someone,  of being trapped, and sees it as a simile of a pack of hounds that are
chasing  them. And instead of being happy about it, terrified, so they're
running for their  life really. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Is that something - is that personal for you or... is that something
you've observed  about other people ? 
</P>
<P>K: I think that everyone is scarred of relationship on some level or other,
but actually  the song in many ways was inspired by an old english black and
white movie  called Night Of The Demon, which is just one of those great movies
that managed  to get through a whole phase of other movies that were incredibly
corny and not  effective, and has a real atmosphere about it. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you have a favorite album of yours, a Kate Bush album? 
</P>
<P>K: It's a very close tie between this and the last one. I think probably
this one. The  one that you've just done is normally your most favorite and then
becomes your  least favorite and you want to get on and do something else and
make it better.  [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: What do you know about Canada? 
</P>
<P>K: I know very little about it. I wish that I had more time here to actually
go and see  the country because it's one of the most beautiful countries in the
world. I've  only seen it on film, but it's beautiful. 
</P>
<P>[Other quotes from the same interview, shown at a later date. Starts with
the  Hounds of Love quote above] 
</P>
<P>K: Well touring is one of those things that could easily be the next
project. I think  what's put me off committing myself to it is the amount of
involvement - it  enormous. I mean it's financially costly, very tiring, and a
tremendous amount of  effort goes into it. But it's so rewarding. And we only
did the one tour in '79,  around England and Europe. And I had to wait until I
had another two albums  worth of material to be able to tour again, which only
took me to the end of the  last album. And since then, I haven't really been
prepared for that kind of  commitment. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, what would a tour involve, what would a concert - a Kate Bush
concert -  involve? Would there be dancing...? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. Well this is how we approached it the last time. Very much inspired
by the  initial influences of people like Lindsay Kemp and the dance that I'd
taken up. I  felt that it was a really interesting combination to use music,
theatre, poetry, in  live form. And although all the songs we'd worked were off
the albums, we had  lots links and different extensions to the music and that.
And so it really does  become a very involved process. And I think the last
three albums, which if we  did a tour would be what we'd cover, actually lend
themselves better towards  being visualized theatrically, but I just don't know
if we'll every get 'round to  doing it. [Laughs]
