jim@medinah.atc.ucarb.com <BR> Subject: Review in Graffiti Dec. 1993 
</P>
<P>The following is a short review of TRS in the December issue of the Graffiti
 (West Virginia Alternative Entertaiment Guide). 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush The Red Shoes (Columbia). For the past 16 years, record companies 
have been trying to figure out how to break Kate Bush in America. That they 
haven't given up after the mega-hyped failure of 1989's Sensual World is
fortunate  because the often-challenging songstress has delivered another strong
effort.  Whether this disc will finally earn her a place in U.S. hearts is
debatable, but  charmingly upbeat cuts like &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; and the
Prince soundalike &quot;Why  Should I Love You?&quot; (written by Bush, with an
instrumental assist from  whatshisname himself) can't hurt her chances. Some
songs (like the title track) are  still tough going for the casual listener, but
Bush's work has a lyrical and musical  richness that demands repeated listening.

Date: Sat, 4 Dec 1993 20:03:14 GMT <BR> Subject: The Orlando Sentinel &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot; Review Dec. 1993 (?)
</P>
<P>The Orlando Sentinel &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; Review 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush, The Red Shoes (Columbia): Kate Bush always takes ages to make an 
album, but her efforts have been well worth the prolonged anticipation--until
now.
</P>
<P> On The Red Shoes, Bush seems determined, after years as a cult heroine, to 
follow cohort Peter Gabriel's path from the fringes to the rock mainstream. But 
rather than emphasizing her melodic side, as Gabriel did on his pop hits, she
merely  irons out some of the quirks that made her tunes so interesting and
succumbs to  many of the cliches of contemporary production.
</P>
<P>On the opening cut, &quot;Rubberband Girl,&quot; Bush waxes positively perky
as she  struggles to forge a &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; out of a flimsy tune,
dopey lyrics and bouncy  dance-floor beat. Arena-rock drums undermine the gentle
&quot;Top of the City.&quot; The  dance-floor rhythm track on &quot;Constellation
of the Heart&quot; is too cliched to energize  the bland melody.
</P>
<P>&quot;And So Is Love&quot; is as full of wispy synthesizers as a Phil
Collins song, and even  with a few spirals of electric guitar, it's too pale a
landscape for her piercing  soprano. Except for Bush's voice, &quot;The Song of
Solomon&quot; could be a New Age  number and the lyrics could have been written
by George Michael in a snippy  mood--&quot;Don't want your B.S./ just want your
sexuality.&quot;
</P>
<P>Nothing on The Red Shoes is worthy of past Bush albums, but a few numbers 
have their mild charms. The bizarre fruit metaphors on &quot;Eat the Music&quot;
are  exceedingly pretentious, but the song has a lilting, African high-life
feel. The  mechanical rhythm track on &quot;Lily&quot; is a tired dance-floor
cliche, but the odd high,  droning noises on top add interesting texture. The
mandola, the whistles and various  curious instruments on the driving title
track really recall the fever-dream quality of  the 1948 ballet film The Red
Shoes, the album's namesake.
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes was some four years in the making. Hopefully, it won't take
Bush  so long to put a new album out, to make this disappointing misstep fade
from  memory. 
</P>
<P>TWO stars out of FIVE. 
</P>
<P>--- Parry Gettelman 
</P>
<P>(Full body photograph of Kate in a fruit print dress: &quot;Devoid of the
quirks that  made her a cult heroine, Kate Bush's 'The Red Shoes' is a
disappointing effort.&quot;)

Fri, 17 Dec 1993 17:14:45 GMT <BR> Subject: KaTe mentioned in Rumba 24/93 
</P>
<P>The 10th anniversary edition of Rumba, a Finnish musical tabloid, contains
quite a  few mentions of KaTe and some other artists relevant to this group, so
I thought to  report them. 
</P>
<P>Translation, spelling and grammar errors are MINE, ALL MINE! 
</P>
<P>In the review of musical year 1993 Samuli Knuuti writes in chapter titled  &quot;Women,
those women&quot;: [my comments in brackets - MK] 
</P>
<P>[omitted a couple of initial paragraphs] 
</P>
<P>The first one to be mentioned is of course Kate Bush, whose records have
always  been treated with a respect like they were carved in stone and carried
to us from  Mt. Sinai. Kate Bush is the last enigma of rock. She's the only
musician whose next  step we never know in advance and who hasn't ever failed
our expectations [logic  ?]. La Bush hasn't burned herself out on magazine pages
but has saved her fire for  the records, which are very paradoxical in their
excellence: all Bush records sound  totally different, but no other artist is as
easily recognizable. 
</P>
<P>Year 1993 released among us &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; whose reception
confirmed the  familiar rule: Kate's records can only be compared to her earlier
records. Coming  later is her directorial debut, a hour-long movie &quot;The
Line, The Cross, The Curve&quot;  and perhaps even a tour. The world, and Jukka
Vddtdnen [editor of Rumba, and a  KaTefan], is holding its breath. 
</P>
<P>[in the remaining stuff SK mentions among others Bjork, Aimee Mann, Jane 
Siberry and Mazzy Star (isn't that the band, not the singer?)] 
</P>
<P>The staff of Rumba voted on the 20 best records of the year. Here's a few 
placings: 
</P>
<P>Category foreign albums: 
</P>
<P>1. Bjork : Debut 
</P>
<P>3. Kate Bush : The Red Shoes 
</P>
<P>15. Aimee Mann : Whatever 
</P>
<P>Category foreign singles: 
</P>
<P>1. Bjork : Human Behaviour 
</P>
<P>5. Bjork : Venus As A Boy 
</P>
<P>20. Kate Bush : Rubberband Girl 
</P>
<P>In the list of all albums that have been given full points (5) in a review
during the  10-year history of the magazine, the only entry for KaTe is &quot;Hounds
Of Love&quot; in  1985. TRS got &quot;only&quot; 4.5 points. 
</P>
<P>In the charts section: 
</P>
<P>- TRS falls 10 places to number 18 on the album chart. 
</P>
<P>- Eat The Music climbs 3 to 11. on the RadioMafia &quot;most played&quot;
chart 
</P>
<P>- Moments of Pleasure drops three places to 33. on the &quot;Rumba 50 Hits&quot;
chart.

Dec 1993 22:41:32 -0800 <BR> Subject: Review including TRS from R.A.D! e-zine
Dec. 1993 
</P>
<P>The following is a review by Jesse Garon, review columnist for the
electronic zine  R.A.D! (Review and Discussion of Rock Culture), of several
albums, including THE  RED SHOES. 
</P>
<P>This review is reposted with permission 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>A lot of hardcore Kate Bush fans have been disappointed in The Red Shoes, 
complaining that this album is a step backword for Kate, that songs like &quot;Eat
the  Music&quot;, &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, and &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;
are a step backwards for  the talented English singer. This is definitely *not*
the Kate Bush of &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot; -- the &quot;new&quot; Kate Bush
sings in a way that is much more sensual (not only  in the sexual sense of the
term, but in the sense of being rooted in the physical or  material world) and
less unearthly, continuing a thread from her last album,  non-coincidentally
titled The Sensual World. The ethereal qualities that attracted  early fans have
not been completely left behind, however. &quot;Lily&quot;, for example, has 
intriguing lyrics suggestive of a Gnostic or Masonic ritual, and &quot;The Song
of Solomon&quot;  combines the earthy attitude of &quot;don't want your bullshit
/ just want your sexuality&quot;  (probably the couplet quoted in most reviews
of a single album for 1993) with Biblical  and Celtic mythology. 
</P>
<P>She is also well served on this album by her collaborators. The Trio
Bulgarka lend  their haunting voices to several of the songs, and guitar work by
Jeff Beck on  &quot;You're the One&quot; and Eric Clapton on &quot;And So is
Love&quot; stands out without taking  attention away from Bush. &quot;Why Should
I Love You&quot;, her duet with Prince, is one of  the most interesting duets of
the year. It starts out with faint traces of the Trio  Bulgarka in the
background as Kate sings the first verse, then the chorus kicks into  a more
Princely funk, while the lyric still maintains Kate Bush's spiritual resonances 
and imagery. (Yes, Prince's lyrics have also had spiritual imagery on a regular
basis,  but the specific *feel* of the images in this song are more like Bush,
even when it is  Prince who sings them.) This album shows off Kate Bush's
development as a  songwriter, a record producer, and as a musician/singer, and I
hope that she will  continue to challenge herself as she has done here.

uli@zoodle.RoBIN.de (Ulrich Grepel) <BR> Subject: Music Scene 11/93 
</P>
<P>The Swiss magazine Music Scene tries (;-)) to have a Kate Bush article but 
somehow fails ;-). They introduce Kate's history of slow but high quality
working on  the first two pages (well, not even a column, there's the
pic-with-the-bird that  takes most room) and then they repeat the text on the
next double page and only  add 6 more lines. The last of these lines ends with
'Trio Bul-', so there definitively  some text is missing ;-). Oh yes, the RbG
single cover pic is also there in double-page  manner. 
</P>
<P>Since it's not very interesting and doesn't give any new information I won't
 transcribe/late it without special request.

</P>
<P>This review appeared in the December 17, 1993 edition of Xtra West.
Reprinted  here with permission from the author (Luke Sandford) but not the
publication. 
</P>
<P>The article has a small b/w inset of the album cover. No other photos. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>(EMI Music Canada) 
</P>
<P>Her new album has finally arived and while it's definately worth a listen,
it's no  masterpiece: fans will find sufficient echoes of Kate's illustrious
past to maintain  their devotion, and more casual listeners should appreciate
Kate's experimental ways  and rich '90's sound. But buyer beware: this is Kate's
most commercial and  mainstream recording to date and therin lie both its
strengths and shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>Backed by an all-star cast, Kate offers up twelve tracks which dwell
primarily on  the themes of break-up and loss. 
</P>
<P>If one line could epitomize the album's painful focus, it would be the
refrain  (&quot;Just being alive/It can really hurt&quot;) (sic) which appears
in both You're the One  and Moments of Pleasure [my partner points out to me
this is actually incorrect -  Andrea], the album's tour de force. What saves the
album from despair is Kate's  evocation of hope through humour, and her refusal
to succumb to self-pity  (confusion, perhaps, but never self-pity). Eat the
Music, with its calypso groove, has  an exotic carefree quality and some great
lyrics (&quot;He's a woman at heart/And I love  him for that/ Let's split him
open&quot;) (sic). And the single Rubberband Girl, all  bouncy and bright and
catchy, would seem to be Kate's paeon to resilience in the  wake of solitude. 
</P>
<P>Although lacking the other-worldliness of past efforts, The Red Shoes is
sonically  gorgeous, featuring extravagant instrumentation, superb vocals, and
top-notch guest  musicians (Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck almost make up for David
Gilmour's absence;  and Nigel Kennedy is sublime). But could someone please tell
me what Prince is  doing here? Why Should I Love You? is half-hearted and flat,
and His Royal Badness  sounds like a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes has been steadily endearing itself; it's a qualified success,
but a  success nonetheless.

<P>Philadelphia Inquirer (PI) - SUNDAY January 9, 1994: 
</P>
<P>INFLUENCE OF KATE BUSH IS EVERYWHERE 
</P>
<P>by Tom Moon 
</P>
<P>&quot;I definitely don't think of myself as being an influence,&quot; Kate
Bush says with a  puzzled smile. &quot;I suppose that's something to be
flattered by, but I don't know.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The singer's modesty notwithstanding, you can't help but notice that the 
children of Kate Bush are everywhere. More than any female vocalist/songwriter 
since Joni Mitchell, Bush has been studied and dissected, her lines and vocal 
mannerisms carefully copied. She's become the model for a whole flock of 
introspective, journal-keeping women who strive for more than the everyday 
guitar-accompanied confessional. 
</P>
<P>Bush's neo-gothic sound and otherworldly imagery was, for years, one of the
few  alternatives to &quot;girl&quot; pop, so it's inevitable that aspiring
artists such as Tori Amos  (who acknowledges her debt) would crib from the Bush
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>But Amos - whose second album, Under the Pink, arrives in stores on Feb. 1.
-  has been a bit too zealous in her appropriations. The contemplative piano
settings of  her enormously successful 1992 debut sound an awful lot like those
that made The  Kick Inside, Bush's 1978 debut, so arresting. 
</P>
<P>Though Amos chose more earthy themes (and expressed them through  numbingly
simple lyrics), she relied on Bush's signature orchestral sweeps and  unusual
backing harmonies. Her scholarship was so exact, it sometimes sounded as  though
she had copied the scores. 
</P>
<P>Under the Pink continues the borrowing. As she matures as a vocalist, Amos
has  moved closer to Bush's tortured, writhing phrasing. Unfortunately, her
songs offer  little justification for their drama: They're average pop-rock that
depend on  histrionics to hold interest. 
</P>
<P>While Amos is the most overt, she's hardly the only singer to be influenced
by  Bush's distinctive singing. Bjork, lead singer of Iceland's the Sugarcubes,
displays  Bush's fiery independence and knack for understatement on Debut, her
first effort  as a solo artist. Both Jane Siberry and Eleanor McEvoy work to
transform  confessional narratives into observations on the human condition, the
way Bush's  best lyrics do. And though she's throatier, Mary Fahl of October
Project strives for  exaggeratedly crisp diction and a theatrical sense of
distance, qualities that Bush,  virtually alone among pop singers, cultivates. 
</P>
<P>Bush's compositions have an atmospheric, airy quality that have led some to 
categorize her as new age. It's not an accurate tag, but Bush's ethereal
leanings -  evident on The Kick Inside, The Dreaming (1982) and The Sensual
World (1989) -  have inspired the reverb-happy Happy Rhodes, Clannad's Maire
Brennan and others  to create meditative singer-songwriter music gentle enough
to be played in the  dentist's office. 
</P>
<P>------------------
</P>
<P>My own opinion is that this guy is a dickhead. If he thinks &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; is  ethereal, then his other &quot;opinions&quot; are suspect, no
matter how much he likes Kate. I  think he likes to pretend that he knows some &quot;names&quot;
and throws them around  without knowing much of what he's talking about. Tori
has &quot;numbingly simple&quot;  lyrics? Hardly. &quot;Reverb-happy&quot; Happy
Rhodes? Pfft! People like this compare with  abandon, one of those folks who'd
bring up Kate when talking about *any* female  singer unless they sounded like
Diamanda Galas, Loretta Lynn or Lydia Lunch.

<P>Sie ist mal Hexe, mal singende Fee und immer die grosse Unsichtbare: Kein

Up  that Hill&quot;). Seit 15 Jahren sammelt sie Goldene Schallplatten. Aber nur
ein einziges  Mal (1979) ging sie auf Tournee. Jedes weitere Konzert lehnte die 
Klang-Perfektionistin strikt ab. Zum Erscheinen ihres sechsten Albums &quot;The

<P>Sometimes she's a witch, sometimes a singing fairy, and always the great

 &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;). Since 15 years she collects Golden Records.
But only once  (1979) she went on tour. The sound perfectionist strictly turned
down every other  concert. With the appearance of her sixth [SIC!!!] album &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot; (EMI,  guest musicians: Eric Clapton, Prince, Nigel Kennedy) the
English woman wants to  comfort fans for missed live experiences: she made six
of her new songs into a movie  after the example of the &quot;Magical Mystery

premiere in London.

<P>Friday's Cleveland Plain Dealer 1/28/94 in their magazine section has a

</P>
<P>BUSH CD RARE GRAND SLAM 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes <BR> Kate Bush <BR> Columbia 
</P>
<P>Everyone from Bob Dylan to Meatloaf gets described as an artist these days,
so its  no wonder the word has lost its meaning. But, if there is one pop star
who is worthy  of the term, it is English singer-songwriter-pianist Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>Bush is that rarest of all pop artists--the complete package. Beginning with
her  1978 debut album,&quot;the Kick Inside&quot;, she has established herself
as a kind of  renaissance woman, earning praise for her work as a lyricist,
composer, musician,  vocalist and video director. 
</P>
<P>Her ability to do it all(and do it well) has never more evident than on her
latest  album, &quot;The Red Shoes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>........ 
</P>
<P>the review goes on for seven more paragraphs and the praises for her never
end  throughout. My favorite line is&quot;Bush could teach showoffs such as
Whitney Houston  and Marish Carey a thing or two about expressive singing&quot;.(sorry
Mariah &amp; Whitney  fans) 
</P>
<P>The article is written by Plain Dealer reviewer Michael Norman. 
</P>
<P>This is a one newspaper 'Town' and I'm shocked that this newspaper actually 
printed something worthwhile. There is also a nice picture in her long dress she
 used for Red Shoes promo pics.

<P>Two Sisters In Song... Of Sorts 
</P>
<P>by Peter Galvin 
</P>
<P>When Tori Amos burst onto the pop scene last year with her album &quot;Little
 Earthquakes,&quot; critics were hard pressed to find a label to describe the
singer's  exceedingly personal, exuberantly melodic music. Was it pop, folk or
rock? Was Ms.  Amos a musical earth daughter tapping into the primordial
emotions of the human  heart or just some crackpot offering the most
self-absorbed brand of feminist  spiritualism? Regardless of the many critical
opinions Ms. Amos's arrival  engendered, the one thing almost everyone agreed on
was that she sounded a lot like  Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>Listening to both artists' new albums, Ms. Bush's &quot;Red Shoes: and Ms.
Amos's  &quot;Under the Pink,&quot; one easily hears the similarities between
the two  singer-songwriters. Both have high, frilly voices capable of conveying
girlish  insouciance, pouting allure and shrieking madness; both write
piano-based melodies  heavily influenced by the emotional sweep of classical
music and the drama and  bombast of opera; and both possess a keenly imaginative
romantic sensibility that  challenges patriarchal notions of love, sex and
religion. But Ms. Bush is more of a  musical philosopher than Ms. Amos, divining
meaning from her experience and  giving it universal scope. Ms. Amos's songs are
like psychological case studies,  providing listeners with a vicarious catharsis
rather than any actual insight into  existence. 
</P>
<P>Emerging in 1978 amid the abrasive anarchy of the British punk movement, Ms.
 Bush's debut album, &quot;The Kick Inside,&quot; as a musical anomaly, what
with its heady  art-rock arrangements, baroque vocals and grandiloquent literary
allusions.  Subsequent albums found Ms. Bush experimenting with musical textures
through  the use of synthesizers, multilayered vocals and world-music
instrumentation. Ms.  Bush was seeking increasingly complex ways to express the
landscape of  consciousness and the soul's connection to God and the
supernatural world. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (Columbia 53737; CD and cassette), Ms. Bush,
35, is in a  wiser, less breathlessly romantic mode. Gone is the grandiose
mysticism of songs like  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Running up That
Hill.&quot; Instead, Ms. Bush's quest for  meaning is more earthbound,
concentrating on the pangs of the heart and the joys of  the flesh. In the
breakup ballad, &quot;You're the One,&quot; Ms. Mush places the listener  firmly
in the real world as she sings to her ex-lover, &quot;It's all right, I'' come
'round  when you're not in/ And I'll pick up all my things.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the Eastern-flavored &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; Ms. Bush connects sex
with food,  imagining herself a piece of fruit; &quot;Split me open/ With
devotion,&quot; she demands  jubilantly. The music, too, is much more intimate
than on her past efforts. Ms. Bush  no longer sounds as if she's addressing the
heavens; her vocals now rarely reach  their former ear-piercing levels. 
</P>
<P>The album's title track, based on Michael Powell's 1948 movie of the same
name,  illustrates the tragedy that can result when dreams and reality collide.
An aspiring  dancer puts on a pair of red shoes and dances herself to death to
the furious sound  of lute and zither. Another song about fate, the funk-driven
&quot;Why Should I Love  You?,&quot; a track Ms. Bush wrote and recorded with
Prince, contemplates the spiritual  forces that conspire to bring two lovers
together. 
</P>
<P>Ms. Amos is less concerned with what brings two lovers together than what 
happens to them when they connect. On the affecting &quot;Little Earthquakes,&quot;
the  singer sang of her sexual awakening at the hands of men who were interested
only  in her body and who lorded their power over her as if it was sent straight
from God.  Elsewhere on &quot;Earthquakes,&quot; Ms. Amos detailed her
disillusionment with religion  and the pain of forging an identity in a world
that wants you to be something you're  not. The songs melded Ms. Amos's melodies
with studio touches like sampled  keyboards and strings, expertly giving the
singer's passionate songs their due. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;Under the Pink&quot; (Atlantic 82567; CD and cassette), Ms. Amos,
30, refines her  cabaret-meets-classical style, almost completely forgetting the
use of guitars and  drums. Instead, she interprets her melodies mainly with her
piano, which she plays  to gorgeous effect. 
</P>
<P>The singer is in a less confrontational mode on &quot;Pink.&quot; Indeed,
the only song in  which Ms. Amos actually confronts an oppressor head on is also
the most  studio-enhanced: on &quot;God,&quot; the singer taunts the Creator for
being sloppy and lazy,  with sampled screeches giving the track a predatory
quality. Yet, as on  &quot;Earthquakes,&quot; Ms. Amos continues to use her
personal experience to challenge  religious and sexual conventions. In &quot;Icicle,&quot;
she sings about masturbating in her  room while her family is downstairs saying
their prayers. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the singer seems a bit strapped for provocative subject
matter on  &quot;Pink.&quot; Many of the lyrics are frustratingly oblique, as if
Ms. Amos is trying to hide  the fact that she doesn't have much to say this time
around. Because the impact of  her music depends so much on her confessional
approach, the third-person,  observational stance of several of the songs on &quot;Pink&quot;
renders them emotionally flat. 
</P>
<P>Perhaps now, having seemingly exorcised many of her personal demons, Ms. 
Amos will turn her gaze outward, translating what she sees and feels into a more
 universal vision. After all, it works for Kate Bush.

larry@hal.com (Larry Hernandez) <BR> Subject: Stereo Review review of TRS Febr.
1994 (?) 
</P>
<P>Parke Puterbaugh in Stereo Review magazine. This right honorable review is 
reproduced here without kind permission from this noteworthy person... 
</P>
<P>BEST OF THE MONTH 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush Stretches Out 
</P>
<P>Few artists have so successfully bent musical trends and technology toward
them  as has Kate Bush. A pioneer in the use of the Fairlight synthesizer, she
artfully  explored the potential of sampling as far back as 1982's &quot;The
Dreaming.&quot; Perhaps  buoyed by the Utah Saints' prominent sample of a line
from an old song of hers  (Cloudbursting) [sic] in their recent U.K. rave hit
Something Good [Parke, you can't  be serious!], in her new album, &quot;The Red
Shoes,&quot; she breathlessly dives into  dance-club beats, Celtic
instrumentation, bluesy guitar-vocal dialogues, grunge  guitar, Bulgarian
chorales, sunny world-music tangents, art song, Princely funk, and  incantatory
trance music. [not to mention a film-grrrr...] 
</P>
<P>The album immediately goes for maximum liftoff with Rubberband Girl, which 
captures Bush at her most rhythmically blunt and artfully infectious. Over a
solid,  rave-worthy drum beat underpinned by synthesizer swashes and marimba,
she  playfully enongates her vocals in a wish for emotional resili-ence (&quot;If
I could twang  like a rubberband/I'd be a rubberband girl&quot;). Vocally, she's
got more stretch in her  than a slingshot, reaching for the top of her range
with no loss of power on such  numbers as the delirious title track and Top of
the City, a plea to climb above and  beyond the filth of city streets. 
</P>
<P>A handful of special guests contribute to several tracks. Eric clapton plays
with  exquisite feeling in And So Is Love, and the Trio Bulgarka and Prince join
Bush for  an ecstatic outpouring in Why Should I Love You? Bush herself rises to
a crescendo  of pure, uncensored feeling when she blurts out, &quot;Just being
alive/It can really hurt&quot;  in Moments of Pleasure and &quot;I don't know if
you love me or not&quot; in Top of the City.  In Lily she assumes the voice of
an elderly sage, snapping &quot;Child, take what I say  with a pinch of salt/And
protect yourself with fire.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Musically inventive, emotionally audacious, and entrancing in an
all-too-rare way,  &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; will set your feet dancing and your
head spinning.

ed@wente.llnl.gov (Ed Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review in People Magazine Jan.
1994 
</P>
<P>I missed this when it first came out, and I don't remember seeing any
mention of  it on this newsgroup. Please forgive me if I'm wrong. But an earlier
issue of People  Magazine (Jan. 24, I believe) had a review of _The Red Shoes. 
</P>
<P>THE RED SHOES 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>British-born Kate Bush, perhaps the queen of ethereal pop, has been spinning
 exotic rhythms and esoteric lyrics into space for 15 years. Which is great if
you want  a huge cult following. But what if you also want listeners closer to
the mainstream?  Simple. You make _The Red Shoes_. 
</P>
<P>This is the best and most conventional of all Bush's albums and even
includes a  couple of potential Top 40 singles: the happy-skippy dance number &quot;Rubberband
 Girl&quot; {well, it got into the 90s} and the Prince-like &quot;Why Should I
Love You?&quot; {nope}  (which features {Prince symbol}, the Human Hieroglyphic
himself, on keyboards).  There are still plenty of unique twists and turns to
Bush's music, however, and on  the title cut, a mandolin, some whistles and a
tidal wave of vocal overdubs come close  to aural theater. 
</P>
<P>The one constant that will both appease the Kate cult and entice new fans is
 Bush's voice. She coos. She sighs. She seduces. Her soft and sensual vocals
have  always cast a siren-like spell, and on this outing the magic feels to good
to resist.  (Columbia)

Tower Pulse<br>
By Harold DeMuir<br>
December 1993 edition</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Though much of her reputation is still based on her initial 
incarnation as precocious '70s art-pop princess, <!--EZCODE BOLD START-->
<strong>Kate Bush</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> didn't really come into her own 
until the early '80s, when she discovered synthesizer technology and began 
infusing her lyrical flights-of-fancy with recognizably adult emotional 
dynamics. Notwithstanding a few characteristic excursions into lyrical 
preciousness, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Red Shoes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 
(Columbia) is one of Bush's most impressive efforts. Tracks like &quot;Lily&quot; and &quot;The 
Song of Solomon&quot; (on which she actually makes the couplet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>&quot;Don't want your bullshit/Just want your sexuality&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->stick) 
display an emotional toughness that's a marked contrast to the flowery fragility 
of her &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; days. Even on odes to romantic intoxication like the 
title track and &quot;Top of the City,&quot; she sounds firmly in control. Her seamlessly 
eclectic musical settings are as evocative as ever, and her distinctive vocal 
trill has matured from gimmicky affectation into a uniquely expressive 
instrument.<br>

<P><a name="Spin_magazine">Spin magazine</a><br>
by Erik Davis<br>
December 1993<br>
<br>
A campy movie based on a Hans Christian Andersen story, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>The Red Shoes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> told the tale of a ballet dancer 
tragically torn between her lover and the demonic demands of her red shoes. Now, 
fairy-tale ballets may be the least rock 'n roll of artistic sources, but that's 
nothing new for Kate Bush, whose debut album gave shoutouts to Zeus, Gurdjieff, 
and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wuthering Heights</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. 
As she sings in the title track to her new album, Bush has always wanted to 
&quot;dance the dream with your body on,&quot; to weave music from girlstuff, twisted 
fantasy, and ripe sensuality.<br>
<br>
But <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Red Shoes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, 
coming four years after the solid <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sensual World</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, 
which came four years after the solid <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hounds of 
Love</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, is not so solid. Art rock's queen bee seems 
to have spent too much time buzzing around aging rock stars who are anxious 
about their relevance, and the album's special guests - Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, 
Prince - all whiff of entrophy. Besides, the horn dudes blow; the guitar solos 
are lame or out of place; and there are Hammond organs and straight-ahead 
backbeats where there should be ambient-house Junos and more of Bush's dynamic 
use of silence and surge.<br>
<br>
Though and enjoyable come-on to Jesus, the Prince-infected &quot;Why Should I Love 
You?&quot; declines into fusion-dreck. And &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; a Malagasy-West Indies 
tune with all the quotation marks intact, shows that the world-beat virus 
continues to plague thirtysomething pop stars too smart for their own good. 
&quot;Take a papaya/You like a guava?&quot; Bush asks. No, my dear, from you I want 
crumpets and fuzzy peaches.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong: Great songs lurk on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Red 
Shoes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, from the dark propulsion of the title track 
to the sex of &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot; and the melancholy of &quot;Top of the City.&quot; 
Bush still sings like a siren, an unleashed teen, a triumphant heroine, and she 
remains one of the few lyricists who can succeed with both surreal nonsense and 
elaborate conceits (Bush as rubberband, Bush as telescope, Bush as pigeon living 
on angel's shoulder). Her best songs open up the rooms in her mind, but here 
only &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; dredges up her chthonic spunk (&quot;It's a jungle in here&quot;), 
and only the aching &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; rings with the obscure intimacy of her 
great ballads. Perhaps the album's air of compromise and strained maturity is 
due to the authentic magic Bush performs in &quot;Lily.&quot; After some old crone's 
witchy prayer and the eerie moan of Tibetan singing bowls, Bush invokes the four 
pivotal archangels of cermonial magic into her &quot;circle of fire.&quot; I can't speak 
for the other three, but the spirit of Gabriel certainly appears</P>
