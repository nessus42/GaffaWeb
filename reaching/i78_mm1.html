<P>Singer Kate Bush, whose &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is      climbing the
chart, talks to Harry Doherty</P>
<P>   BY NOW, the voice of Kate Bush will have made a full-frontal      attack
on the brains of the nation.  Attack? Not an unreasonable      word when you
consider the strange, weird quality of Ms. Bush's      vocal, captured in all
its resonant glory on her first single,      &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;</P>
<P>    Whether attack is construed as compliment or insult is down      to the
individual, but after an initial reaction of shock - as      one reacts to all
things foreign - I've grown to like      &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and am
presently engaged      in learning the finer delights of her competent, if
occasionally      erratic, first album, <EM>The Kick Inside</EM>.</P>
<P>    But first - an introduction to the unknown name and face that      is
suddenly being hailed as a major new singer songwriter      in Britain.</P>
<P>    Kate Bush is 19, comes from Kent, is now resident in South      East
London, has a pretty face with curves to match, and is      more intelligent
than the usual singers who have emanated      from EMI in such dramatic fashion
in the past. The girl has      a mind of her own and is not adverse to
forcefully presenting      an opinion (an asset in itself).</P>
<P>    She comes from a &quot;good&quot; family. Her father is a      GP and
she had quite a comfortable childhood. The family      itself was always
musical, specialising in English and Irish      traditional and playing around
local folk clubs.</P>
<P>   Kate, however, never performed outside the confines of      home and was
content to learn the basics, starting piano      at the age of 11 and quickly
finding that she could write her      own songs.</P>
<P>    School was St Joseph's Grammar School, in Abbey Wood,      but apart
from her early period in the classroom, it held little      fascination. The
explanation in hindsight: &quot;I found it      wasn't helping me. I became
introvert. I guess it was the      teachers' system the way they react to pupils
and I wasn't      quite responsive to that.&quot;</P>
<P>    Nonetheless, Kate quit school at the age of 16 with 10      'O'-levels,
specialising in English and Music and showing      an unusual interest in Latin,
although she found it an     incredibly difficult language to master.</P>
<P>    &quot;The reason I left was that I felt I could do something       more
in tune with my purpose -- music.&quot;</P>
<P>    This she was able to do with the help of an inheritance of      an aunt
who died. Effectively the money gave her the security      to become her own
boss and follow her own mind.</P>
<P>    At one time, just before leaving school, there was an      ambition to
become either a psychiatrist or a social worker.      Both careers made sense to
her as an alternative to her first      love.</P>
<P>    &quot;I guess it's the thinking bit, trying to communicate with     
people and help them out. The emotional aspect. It's so      sad to see good,
nice people emotionally disserved, screwed      up when they could be so happy.</P>
<P>    She couldn't have pursued the ambition because she was      lousy at
physics, chemistry and maths. She agreed that the     careers she fancied,
psychiatry, social work or music, were in     direct contrast. Music is
completely self-indulgent and the other is      almost charitable.</P>
<P>    &quot;I know what you mean. The only reason in the first place      that
I did think of those things was that I in no way thought      that my music
could be a career because it's so difficult to      make it.  It's all a matter
of timing and contacts and talent . . .      and luck. I never thought I would
have a chance to do that so I      deliberately tried to have a
career-orientated ambition      something I could hold on to.</P>
<P>    &quot;The reason I chose those sort of things is that they are,      in
a way, the things I do with music. When I write songs I      really like to
explore the mental area, the emotional values.     Although in a way you can say
that being a psychiatrist      is more purposeful than writing music, in many
ways it isn't      because a lot of people take a great deal of comfort from    
 music. I know I do. It makes you feel good.</P>
<P>    &quot;The really important thing about music is that all it      is is a
vehicle for a message, what ever your message is.      I'm probably a lot better
at being a songwriter than I would      be a psychiatrist, for instance.  I
might have people jumping      out of windows now.&quot;</P>
<P>    She thinks, then that her music is a therapy?</P>
<P>    &quot;Oh, yes, it's very much a therapeutic thing, not only for      me.
That's a really good word. It really is like a therapy. The      message I would
like people to receive is that if they hear it and      accept it, that's
fantastic.</P>
<P>    &quot;If they let it into their ears that is all I can ask for and if   
  they think about it afterwards or during it, that is, even more     
fantastic. There are so many writers and so many messages,      to be chosen out
of all of them is something very special.</P>
<P>    &quot;The messages? Things that maybe could help people,      like
observing the situation where an emotional game is being      played and maybe
making people think about it again.&quot;</P>
<P>    It's very glamorous to make a statement like that but how true      did
she think it was?</P>
<P>    &quot;It's easy to say everything. Really all I do when I write     
songs is try and write something that affects me: something that      I feel
does have a solution or something that is unexplored.</P>
<P>    &quot;It really is just self-expression, and although I know      that a
lot of people will just say it's a load of rubbish, I would      like to think
that there is a message and maybe people will      hear it.&quot;</P>
<P>    On leaving school, Kate took up dancing, because she felt it      was an
art parallel to music, &quot;another pure art form inasmuch      as it's free&quot;.
The straw that inspired her was <EM>Flowers</EM>, a      Lindsay Kemp
performance at the Collegiate Theater, London,      three years ago. Kemp's mime
attracted her and the next day a      perusal through Time Out magazine
uncovered an advertisement      for classes by Kemp.</P>
<P>    Kemp made an instant impression on Kate, displaying an ease in     
communication that she had never experienced before. He taught      her the
importance of disciplining the body before attempting to mime.      The
association with Kemp lasted only six months: he went off to     perform
professionally in Australia and she moved on to another class.</P>
<P>    She reacts vehemently but positively to my comment that mime     
appeared to be an upper-class art. </P>
<P>    &quot;No, I wouldn't call it an upper-class thing at all. It's probably 
    further away from the upper class than anything else, because they     
probably find it hard to be free as they are so caught up in all their     
status problems, and the same probably goes for working-class      people in a
lot of ways because they always feel this alienation      from other people.&quot;</P>
<P>    Because of her inheritance, Kate didn't have the trauma of     
desperately searching for a job on leaving school. However,      she had decided
her career would focus on music . . . Iong before.</P>
<P>    &quot;The money did enable me to think that I could do it because I     
was obviously worried about leaving school and finding myself      nowhere. I
had strong feelings in not having little securities like a      nice, little
job. I wanted to try and do what I wanted and if it went wrong,      okay, but
at least try to do it.&quot;</P>
<P>    During this time, Kate had been staying at home writing songs and     
accompanying herself on either guitar or piano but not daring to let      anyone
outside the sphere of family hear her work.</P>
<P>    Then a friend of the family, Ricky Hopper, who had worked in the     
music business, heard her material, took an interest and started flogging     
tapes around the music biz, with little luck. The big break came when     
Hopper contacted an old friend of his from Cambridge, Pink Floyd's      Dave
Gilmour.</P>
<P>    Gilmour came and heard and liked.</P>
<P>    Gilmour suggested recording proper demo tapes. He put up the      money,
&quot;an amazing thing&quot;, for the studio, found Kate a      good arranger
and the songs were recorded properly. From there      it grew. Gilmour
introduced Kate to a friend Andrew Powell, noted for      his work with Alan
Parsons and he was to produce the album.</P>
<P>    The voice? Ah yes, that voice. Kate is genuinely bewildered at the     
response her vocal has evoked. She refutes suggestions that she     
deliberately &quot;cultivated&quot; the voice. &quot;Honest, I just      opened
my  mouth and it came out.&quot;</P>
<P>    And then came the album. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, by the     way,
emphasises her unique high-pitched vocal more than any      other track.
Usually, she comes across as a stranger concoction      that resembles a Joni
Mitchell-Noosha Fox mongrel, which is a      fascination in itself. It's a very
promising debut, and that it has      spawned a hit single already is a surprise
to Kate.</P>
<P>    &quot;I was so involved with all my artistic frustrations that I     
never thought of having a hit. I was thinking of all the things      that I
wanted to be there musically that weren't and vice      versa.</P>
<P>    &quot;The battle with yourself because there's your expression     
going down there, and there's no way you can change it. It's there      forever.
It is very frustrating to see something that you have been      keeping
transient for years just suddenly become solid. It's a      little disconcerting
. . . but exciting.&quot;</P>
<P>    At this early stage in her career, Kate appears uncannily aware      of
the dangers of an early hit. She is determined that her work      in music stays
an art.</P>
<P>    &quot;You see people who are into the glamour and the ego of      it and
not the work, and really work's what it's all about. It's not      anything to
do with ego. Music is like being a bank clerk. It's      still work, only a
different channel of energy.&quot; </P>
