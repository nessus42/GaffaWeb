Subject: Smash Hits 28. Aug. 1985 (extracts)
</P>
<P>There is an article/interview with Kate Bush in the 28 August - 10 September
 1985 Smash Hits. Some quotes: 
</P>
<P>She had a number one single when she was 18, and followed that with a string
of  hits. Then she vanished. So what happened? Did she disappear to France? Did
she  turn into an 18-stone blob? No she didn't, actually, reports Chris Heath...

</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Those days [&quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, &quot;Lionheart&quot; -- Doug],
despite her success, most  people thought of her as a rather weird doctor's
daughter with the &quot;funny&quot; voice  and the funnier dances who said
either &quot;amazing&quot; or &quot;wow&quot; (or possibly both)  whenever she
opened her mouth. 
</P>
<P>They only took her a bit more seriously a couple of years later when she had
a hit  about nuclear war (&quot;Breathing&quot;), and then another about a boy
who grows up  wanting to be a soldier (&quot;Army Dreamers&quot;. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Then things went a bit wrong. Her last LP, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; in 1982,
had no big  hit singles and met with mixed response. Some said it was her best
record ever... 
</P>
<P>It was! 
</P>
<P>It is strange that in England, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was a relative
commercial disaster,  but in the U.S., it is &quot;The Dreaming&quot; that got
KB noticed. The relative commercial  success of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; in the
U.S. (hey, well it got up to nearly 150 on the  charts!) and rave reviews of &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; in the U.S. press caused EMI-America  to finally release &quot;Lionheart&quot;
(1978) and &quot;Never for Ever&quot; (1980) in 1984. 
</P>
<P>... but others either said that she was down in the dumper or just laughed 
because it featured Rolph Harris playing digeridoo. She's still fuming about
that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's so much snobishness. Their attitude was not to take him
seriously but in  fact on levels of musicianship he was fantastic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>She says that she is not very fond of interviews and she only does them to
help  launch her records -- &quot;send it off safe into the world like you do a
baby or a ship&quot; --  so that they can earn enough money to make the next
one. And she's not very much  in touch with her competition in the charts. &quot;I
never listen to much contemporary  music,&quot; she says, admitting that she's
never even *heard* Madonna before Live Aid. 
</P>
<P>I was wrong, thank goodness! Kate just couldn't come out and say something 
good about Madonna! Every other time someone has asked &quot;Do you like Foo?&quot;
she  always said &quot;Yeah, Foo is really great!&quot; no matter who Foo is
because she'll never  insult anyone in specific. 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>When asked about the worst thing that's happened to her she snaps &quot;I
don't  want to answer such a negatively based question&quot;, though she does
then cryptically  reply &quot;loosing my I-Ching card and Killing Joke splitting
up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>How weird. Maybe the Killing Joke bit's got to do with the fact that Youth,
the  band's old bass player (now in Brillian), appears on the new LP. She does
say later  that &quot;Killing Joke were a band with such good energy -- I really
liked 'Eighties'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eighties -- I'm living in the eighties <BR> Eighties -- I have to
push, I have to struggle <BR>  Eighties -- get out of my way, I'm not for sale
no more&quot;
