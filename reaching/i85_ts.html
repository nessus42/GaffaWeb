<BR> Subject: Toronto Star, Nov. 24th 1985, on the Cloubusting video 
</P>
<P>Today's (Nov 24) Toronto Star carries an article on the Cloudbusting video
which  took up 1/3 of the front page of the entertainment section by a Peter
Goddard. I'm  quoting parts of the article,especially KB's words: 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P> Look for Donald Sutherland's face to shine through on Cloudbusting, the new
 video from fairytale rocker Kate Bush 
</P>
<P> POP'S SIREN PUTS LYRICAL TALES ON FILM 
</P>
<P>Tomorrow yet another video will burst on to your screen. Called
Cloudbusting, it  comes from Hounds of Love, the latest album by Kate Bush,
British rock's mystery  vamp -- the singer who hates touring and hides behind a
swirl of sensuous imagery  in her songs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We're treating it as a piece of film,&quot; she told me a few days
ago, &quot;and it really  came down to choosing the right actor for it. I
couldn't think of anyone better than  Donald Sutherland. I think he's a very
sensitve actor, as well as extremely  professional and patient. So I found a
contract for him, sent him the script and found  that he was interested in doing
it. He just so happened to have the days free.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[...] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Early next year is when I'm going to make a decision about touring.
The  commitment of time and effort is one of the big considerations. I think
television can  go a lot farther than I can on a tour. And a lot quicker. &quot;Video
is making new  experiments all the time but I think it's going through an
exploited stage at the  moment. To me, a lot of videos are too `busy'. There are
a lot of things happening  but quite often they're not telling the story. I
understand part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's frustrating, but sometimes a single chosen for its musical value
can be vey  hard to put a visual to. Some-times you have to compromise between
what's seen  and what's heard. In my video, we had such a strong story to tell
it was the perfect  one to view as a short film and not a promotional device.&quot;

</P>
<P> Her music has been rich in roles to play [...] Now she's extending this 
role-playing to video-making. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My approach is to become on video the particular character required at
the time.  It's a bit like acting because quite often in my songs there's a
character in a  particular setting. When I write a song it's almost as if I'm
writing a script.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She admits that she would feel pressure to make any live concert as visually
lavish  as her videos. &quot;Theatre is quite a different world than film. Film
is very intimate.  It's just the camera seeing what it's pointed at. You can't
see anything beyond that.  But when you're on stage, people's eyes can wander
from the ceiling to the floor,  there's so much they can take in. In video, you
have control.&quot; 
</P>
<P>BTW, the color photo that accompanies this article is one of the three
`limited  edition' KB photos that can be ordered from EMI (UK). (the one with
the blue  background) 
</P>
<P>Also, I think that it should be Peter Reich who'd be thanking KB and not 
vice-versa; now many people in the world will be introduced to Wilheim Reich and
 Orgonomy because of a video!
