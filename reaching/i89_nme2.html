<P>Date: Tue, 10 Oct 89 14:30 PDT <BR> From: Andrew Marvick (IED) <BR>
Subject: New Musical Express by Len Brown, Oct. 7 1989 
</P>
<P>&lt;This interview was conducted in late September, 1989, by Len Brown, with
five  accompanying photographs by Kevin Cummins. Brown was also the man who 
interviewed Kate briefly for NME in December 1988, during her recording sessions
 with Trio Bulgarka. This interview is the first detailed interview to emerge in
 connection with the new album, The Sensual World, and as such, is really the
first  substantial interview with Kate in well over a year. IED is not
responsible for--but  will probably not be able to restrain himself from
commenting on--the many  infuriatingly silly and ignorant remarks which Mr.
Brown makes throughout the  article.&gt; 
</P>
<P> In the Realm of the Senses 
</P>
<P> The essence of sensuality and childlike wonder or screeching wood nymph?
Kate  Bush steps back into the spotlight afterfour years of reclusive recording
and constant  innuendo and rumours from the press to explain herself again. Len
Brown  reacquaints himself with Joyce's latest disciple. Pictures: Kevin
Cummins. 
</P>
<P>&quot;on Howth head in the grey tweed suit in his staw hat the day I got him
to  propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and
it was  leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near
lost my breath  yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers
all of a womans  body yes&quot; 
</P>
<P>(-- from Molly Bloom's speech in James Joyce's Ulysses ) 
</P>
<P> &quot; Mmh, yes, 
</P>
<P>Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth 
</P>
<P>Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes, 
</P>
<P>Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies 
</P>
<P>Off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes, 
</P>
<P>He said I was a flower of the mountain, yes, 
</P>
<P>But now I've powers o'er a woman's body--yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(-- from Kate Bush's The Sensual World ) 
</P>
<P>We meet in a rather sensual room in a sumptuous West London hotel. It's an 
appropriate place to interview Kate Bush. The walls are stacked with paintings
of  nudes--pink boobs, vermillion nips, plenty of Botticelli cheeks--of
cockfights and  banquets, of mankind indulging in animal passions. Orange juice
and nuts are  consumed varaciously throughout discussions.

<!-- Removed due to copyright takedown request


<P> Four years from Hounds of Love, twelve months since we last met in the 
company of three Bulgarian grannies called Trio Bulgarka, Kate's changed little 
physically. Still petite, naturally older, her hair's still long and henna-ed
and the  nervous laugh is as infectious as ever. &lt;&quot;Naturally older&quot;
is a typically ill-written  phrase: what does he mean?&gt;
</P>
<P> Musically she's been gone a long time. Sure there've been collaborations 
(Gabriel's Don't Give Up), charitable outings (Amnesty, Comic Relief, Ferry 
Aid) and The Whole Story compilation, but The Sensual World is her first fresh 
substantial work since the Experiment IV single in late '86. Reasonable people
were  beginning to wonder whether, at last, she'd lost it completely and thrown
in the  towel.
</P>
<P> What's always been remarkable about Kate Bush has been the ability to 
withdraw from the music world, escape from the machine, and return months or 
years later with something rejuvenating, original, set apart from chart-fodder 
disposable pop. Like Bowie in the '70s, Bush in the '80s has been one of the
true  oddities, exceptions to the rules. Always out of step, always unique.
</P>
<P> And always, as The Sensual World implies, provocative. implies,
provocative. Bells  ring as you enter her Sensual World, bells of celebration,
of sensual joy. &quot;The  communication of music is very much like making love,&quot;
she once said, so it's  entirely appropriate that she should derive her title
track from James Joyce's  Ulysses and, in particular, Molly Bloom's thoughts on
sex, sensuality and oysters at  2/6 per dozen.
</P>
<P> &quot;Because I couldn't get permission to use a piece of Joyce it
gradually turned  into the song about Molly Bloom the character stepping out of
the book, into the real  world and the impressions of sensuality,&quot; says
Kate, softly, almost childlike. &quot;Rather  than being in this two-dimensional
world, she's free, let loose to touch things, feel  the ground under her feet,
the sunsets, just how incredibly sensual a world it is.
</P>
<P> &quot;I originally heard the piece read by Siobhan McKenna years ago, and I
thought,  'My God! This is extraordinary. What a piece of writing!' It's a very
unusual train  of thought--very attractive. First I got the &quot;mmh yes,&quot;
and that made me think of  Molly Bloom's speech; and we had this piece of music
in the studio already, so it  came together really quickly. Then, because I
couldn't get permission to use Joyce,  it took another year changing it to what
it is now. Typical, innit!&quot;
</P>
<P> The result is extraordinarily sensual mouth music, far removed from the 
cod-pieced crassness that usually passes for physical love songs: &quot;And at
first with  the charm around him, mmh yes/He loosened it so if it slipped
between my  breasts/He'd rescue it, mmh yes.&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;In the original piece, it's just 'Yes&quot;--a very interesting way
of leading you in. It  pulls you into the piece by the continual acceptance of
all these sensual things: &quot;Ooh  wonderful!' I was thinking I'd never write
anything as obviously sensual as the  original piece, but when I had to rewrite
the words, I was trapped.
</P>
<P> &quot;How could you recreate that mood without going into that level of
sensuality?  So there I was writing stuff that months before I'd said I'd never
write,&quot; she laughs.  &quot;I have to think of it in terms of pastiche, and
not that it's me so much.&quot;
</P>
<P> Having begun her career on The Kick Inside singing lines like &quot;Oh I
need it oh  oh feel it feel it my love&quot; and &quot;feeling of sticky love
inside&quot;, and then gone on in  Lionheart to write a lyric like &quot;the
more I think of &lt;sic&gt; sex the better it gets&quot;, her  reluctance to get
too sensual, too fruity, a decade later may seem a little strange.  &lt;Naturally,
however, Brown makes no attempt to ask her about this apparent  contradiction.&gt;
</P>
<P> But as Bush has increasingly gained control over the presentation of her
music  and her image during this period, stepping back from early marketing
attempts to  titillate (God, how they worked!), these reservations are
understandable.
</P>
<P> She claims The Sensual World contains the most &quot;positive female energy&quot;
in her  work to date, and compositions like This Woman's Work tend to enforce
that idea.  &lt;A bit simplistic, this idea, since TWW is written from the man's
perspective. --  IED&gt;
</P>
<P> &quot;I think it's to do with me coming to terms with myself on different
levels. &lt;That  has got to be one of Kate's all-time favourite stock phrases!&gt;
In some ways, like on  Hounds of Love it was important for me to get across the
sense of power in the  songs that I'd associated with male energy and music. But
I didn't feel that this  time, and I was very much wanting to express myself as
a woman in my music,  rather than as a woman wanting to sound as powerful as a
man.
</P>
<P> &quot;And definitely The Sensual World --the track--was very much a female
track  for me. I felt it was a really new expression, feeling good about being a
woman  musically.&quot;
</P>
<P> But isn't it odd that this feminist or feminine perspective should have
been  inspired by a man, Joyce?
</P>
<P> &quot;Yes, in some ways...but it's also the idea of Molly escaping from the
author, out  into the real world, being this real human, rather than the
character: stepping out of  the page into the sensual world.&quot;
</P>
<P> So is this concept of sensuality the most important thing to you at the
moment?  Is it one of the life forces?
</P>
<P> &quot;Yes. It's about contact with humans. It could all come down to the
sensual level.  Touch? Yes. Even if it's not physical touch: reaching out and
touching people by  moving them. I think it's a very striking part of this
planet, the fact that there is so  much for us to enjoy. The whole of Nature is
really designed for everything to have a  good time doing what they should be
doing...Fancy being a bee, leading an  incredible existence, all these flowers
designed just for you, flying into the runway,  incredible colours--some trip...&quot;
</P>
<P> Mmh buzz.
</P>
<P> Many bumbles have breathed their last since Kate Bush first arrived on our 
screens, flouncing about in dry ice and funeral shroud &lt;sic&gt;, oddly
crowing  Wuthering Heights ; obviously different and apart from any musical
movement  before or since. But whereas the all-conquering, universally acclaimed
Hounds of  Love affair at least slotted into the then-pop world, The Sensual
World is clearly even  more out of step with current piss-poor post-SAW &lt;Stock,
Aitkin, Waterman, a team  of current British pop dance-record producers,
responsible for Rick Astley, Kylie  Minogue, etc.&gt; scene.
</P>
<P> Probably because it's got a slightly ethnic feel, founded on Kate's use of
Irish  and Bulgarian musics and musicians in the creative process. Perhaps
because she's  been free from pop for so long. Maybe because she's crossed the
threshold of 30?
</P>
<P> &quot;God! Yes. I'm sure it's all tied in with it,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I
think it's a very  important time: from 28 to 32-ish, where there's some kind of
turning point.  Someone said that in your teens you get the physical puberty,
and between 28 and 32  mental puberty. Let's face it, you've got to start
growing up when you're 30, it does  make you feel differently. I feel very
positive having gone through the last couple of  years.&quot; &lt;Very positive?
What an unexpected remark!&gt;
</P>
<P> She's not specific about what she's actually gone through in recent years &lt;What
 a surprise!&gt;, apart from the usual trials by media. If you were to scan back
through  the smeared pages of cheaper organs you would probably come to the
conclusion  that she's been a.) pregnant; b.) fighting drug and alcohol
addiction; c.) 25 stone; and  d.) having several flings with Peter Gabriel. &lt;Brown
obviously didn't ask her directly  about these stupid rumours--but whether his
own &quot;organ&quot; is &quot;cheap&quot; or not, he and  it couldn't resist
dredging them all up once again.&gt;
</P>
<P> More credibly, it seems she's been reclusively struggling with her music,
and  even living in bliss (somewhere near Kent, apparently) with long-term
lover, bassist  and moustachioed mixer Del Palmer.
</P>
<P> And yet one is naturally tempted to peer into The Sensual World and inquire
 whether or not a song such as Between a Man and a Woman is a personal account
of  romantic difficulties? (&quot;It's so hard for love to stay together/With
the modern  Western pressures&quot;).
</P>
<P> &quot;But anything you write, people tend to think it's about you,&quot;
she says,  nervously. &quot;Like Woody Allen: his films are obviously very
personal. There's  obviously an awful lot of him in his work. But you see him
being interviewed, and as  soon as he's asked if it's personal he gets really
defensive. It's a very awkward  area...
</P>
<P> &quot;On this album there's more of me in there, in a more honest way than
before,  and yet, although some of it's me, the songs songs aren't about aren't
about me. It's  this kind of vague mish-mash of other people and yourself; bits
of films; things  you've heard--all put together in a mood that says a lot about
me at this time.
</P>
<P> &quot;A lot of people will think these songs are about me. I've always had
that. And  like, with Deeper Understanding, people react immediately, saying, &quot;Is
this  autobiographical? So you're into computers now? So you spend all night on 
computers?' People immediately switch on to the mechanicalness: It's a song
about  computers, so she must be into computers!&quot; &lt;Note that she doesn't
actually say  whether she is using computers or not! Classic Kate! Nor, of
course, does Brown  have the presence of mind to ask her; and in the second part
of this interview, when  Kate was asked to comment on each track in succession,
she apparently declined to  comment on this song further. -- IED&gt;
</P>
<P> The fascination with Bush's private life, and the tittle-tattle speculation
that't  surrounded it, obviously arises from the woman's reluctance to play the
fame game.  True, she now and then turns out for charitable gatherings, but
hardly ever see her  photographed legless in Lennon's, or chucking up outside
The Groucho like proper  pop stars.
</P>
<P> &quot;I've almost been me for the last couple of years, but, in the last
two weeks, I've  been aware of people treating me as what seems to be a very
famous person. It's  totally surreal, going into an isolated way of working,
three or four years at a time,  then coming out and having everyone look at you
as if they know you.
</P>
<P> &quot;It's healthier for me not to indulge in being a famous person. It's
ridiculous.  There's absolutely no reason why I should be at all, other than
that I make records.&quot;  &lt;Except maybe that she makes the best records in
the history of civilisation!&gt;
</P>
<P> &quot;I find it extraordinary that people should want to write about me
when I do so  little. I just pop out and do an album and go away again.&quot;
</P>
<P> It sometimes seems that way. Three years between The Dreaming and Hounds 
of Love ; four more before we begin to enter The Sensual World. Yet the creative
 business is a lengthy, complicated and concentrated process, initially begun by
Kate  and Del in their home studio.
</P>
<P> &quot;I found the writing very difficult on this,&quot; she admits, almost
embarrassed. &quot;I  don't know what I wanted to say or how to treat the songs,
make them sound  differently, to get outside musicians in to do something or
just go away and think. A  lot of it is jigsawing: I'd get to the point where I
couldn't write, where I was sick of  the songs. And yet you thought they were OK
to begin with. The problem is holding  on to that energy level.&quot;
</P>
<P> The diverse musicianship on The Sensual World, the variety of sounds and
rootsy  emotions that have been brought to bear, is perhaps the album's greatest
strength.  Around the hub of Kate, her multi-instrumentalist brother Paddy and
Del Palmer,  are gathered Celtic craftsmen such as Davey Spillane, Alan Stivell
and Donal Lunny,  plus the remarkable veteran vocal talents of Bulgaria's Trio
Bulgarka. Throw in  Dave Gilmour guitar solos and flurries of fiddle from Nigel
Kennedy and you're  beginning to approach The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>Her Celtic passion has been longstanding and comes from her Irish mother.
Night  of the Swallow back on '82's The Dreaming first featured Donal Lunny with
piper  Liam O'Flynn. And brother Paddy's obsession with obscure European musics 
encouraged Kate to listen to those Bulgarian voices and try and harness them
with  her own.
</P>
<P> &quot;I wanted to work with the Irish guys again because it gets better
each time. But  I was never sure it'd come off with Trio Bulgarka. On Never Be
Mine all the Irish  stuff was done, and then the girls came in.&quot; (The girls
must be 180 years old  collectively.) &quot;Two separate entities put together,
but similar energies. And  sometimes you can hear little Irish riffs and
flavours in the Bulgarian music and  vice-versa.
</P>
<P> &quot;For Bulgaria, the terrific amount of suffering they've gone through
is so  apparent in the music, so spiritually powerful and intense that, if you
let it, it'd just  rip you apart. Maybe it's the same with Ireland. Maybe these
are two races that have  turned to music in times of hardship: broken hearts
singing, in terrible pain, getting  help through the music.&quot;
</P>
<P> The overall result of these liasons is a definite departure from everything
Bush  has done before. In the past she's used ethnic instruments and accents
just to make  her own compositions (and costumes) more exotic--take Kashka From
Baghdad or  Egypt &lt;what a jerk. -- IED&gt;-- but here the Irish-Bulgarian
combination is powerful  and effective, an integral part of The Sensual World.
(Trio Bulgarka and the Uillean  piper Davey Spillane feature on three tracks,
Spillane playing a wonderfully strange  Macedonian solo on the title
track/single.)
</P>
<P> &quot;I'm curious and nervous to know how people will take it,&quot; grins
Kate. &quot;They'll  either really like it or hate it. Ethnic music for some
people is just too far out. They  can't relate unless there's a Western
influence. They can't understand.&quot;
</P>
<P> To be frank, when Kate Bush began and some of us were still at our physical
 peaks, the appeal was largely physical and sexual. Mmh, yes, the wiggling of
Wow.  Mmh, yes, the bounce of Babooshka. Mmh, yes, the erotic womb-view of
Breathing.  But we've all passed a lot of water since then and, naturally, all
grown up.
</P>
<P> Except, it sometimes seems from the songs, Kate herself. &lt;What about
this  foul-minded little twerp who did this interview? Does he actually consider
the  previous paragraph &quot;grown-up&quot; writing? --IED.&gt; Listening back,
to tracks like  Cloudbusting, and now to Reaching Out, it seems as if the child
in her has been  preserved. In The Fog on The Sensual World, her father, Dr.
John &lt;sic--his name is  Robert, fuckhead.--IED&gt; Bush, paternally
announces: &quot;Just put your feet down child,  'Cause you're all grown up now.&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;It's hard for me to say. The way people see me is so diverse,&quot;
comments Kate,  on the theory that childishness is part of her appeal. &quot;I
suppose in lots of ways I'm  still very much like a little girl, and probably
always will be, even if I make it to 60 or  70.
</P>
<P> &quot;It's an interesting perspective of life, a child's. Maybe it's
because I'm so small  and still at knee level. The symbolism of the child is
such a powerful thing, because  it's the small vulnerable thing looking out at
the big worl.&quot;
</P>
<P> But hasn't reaching 30...?
</P>
<P> &quot;OK, stop rubbing it in, young man!&quot;
</P>
<P> Don't you start worrying about what people think of you physically?
</P>
<P> &quot;But this is like the first time we've experienced young music growing
old, and  it's like people won't allow it. Look at the stick a lot of our
gorgeous men are  getting now that they're in their 4os. It doesn't seem to be
hip for guys to be in  their 40s and still in the rock industry.
</P>
<P> &quot;I don't really see myself as a performer, and that's hard for
me--when I have  to come out and expose myself and be the saleswoman of the
hour. I don't have the  same kind of exposure as other performers do. I suppose
if people think I look  horrible they tend to keep it to themselves. Maybe I
haven't started hitting the real  horrors yet. What do you think?&quot;
</P>
<P> Er...
</P>
<P> &quot;Oh, dear!&quot;
</P>
<P> No, no, you don't look horrible at all!
</P>
<P> &quot;It's the whole train of thought: 'Oh my God, doesn't she look old!'
Usually I  get, 'Oh my God, doesn't she look small!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot; When I could wear a sunset, mmh, yes, And how we'd wished to live in
the  sensual world, You don't need words, Just one kiss, then another... &quot;
</P>
<P> Pleasures of the senses? Or the vicious indulgence of animal passions? You
can  view the sensual world either way. To Kate Bush, sensuality is obviously a
positive,  receptive, natural experience, far removed from Happy Mondays-style
chemistry-set  hedonism. Check that video, &quot;walking through these woods,
with the weather  changing, the elemental energies of the earth, wind, pollen,
sunset, bite of hail,  continually walking through the same environment with
that sense of the changing  world.&quot;
</P>
<P> To the believer this is real sensuality, communion with nature, oneness
with the  earth. To the cynic it's a load of hippy shit in any language. &lt;What
a fuckhead! Jeez,  IED hates these effete British music journalists.&gt; And
predictably, at the centre of  the whole philosophy, there's the doctrine of,
yes, love. So choose your path  carefully, children...
</P>
<P> &quot;Love is a wonderful, powerful thing,&quot; trills Kate, without a
hint of  Fotherington-Thomas. &lt;These music journalists are always so
astoundingly  preoccupied with the job of making sure they're coming off as
cynical and hip and  &quot;cool&quot; in their readers' eyes that they don't
even have the minimal courage to  consider the wonder of the natural world--as
though love and Nature were only fads  of the 60s, now somehow &quot;out of date&quot;!
And one more thing: Kate doesn't &quot;trill&quot;!  Smug, patronizing,
supercilious jerk. -- IED&gt; &quot;In many ways nearly every song I've  ever
written is a love song. It's very important to try and learn to love people as 
much as you can. But we all get so scared. It's only when people are at points
in  their lives when they get such shocks that they take it as it really should
be. The rest  of us just seem to piss about.&quot;
</P>
<P> Track by track: The Sensual World of Kate Bush
</P>
<P> &quot;It feels like ten very separate songs, ten short stories, but
although I think  there's probably a mood that hangs them together, it's not
really conceptual at all.&quot;
</P>
<P> Very true, Kate, except there's 11 of 'em; from the Joycean celebration of
The  Sensual World single through to the almost Dreaming -like optimism of Walk 
Straight Down the Middle. &lt;Optimism? Optimism ?! -- IED&gt; 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD
</P>
<P> Based on Molly Bloom's monologue at the end of Joyce's Ulysses, The Sensual
 World only stepped off the printed page when the publishers refused to give
Kate  Bush permission to quote the novel.
</P>
<P> &quot;It transformed the song. Obviously the words had to change, but also
the  musical sections were completely different. By them being oncooperative it
made the  track better in many ways, but it was very difficult to keep the
rhythmic sense of  the words.&quot;
</P>
<P> What's the significance of the bells at the beginning of the song?
</P>
<P> &quot;I've got a thing about the sound of bells. It's one of those
fantastic sounds:  sound of celebration. The're used to mark points in
life--births, weddings,  deaths--but they give this tremendous feeling of
celebration.
</P>
<P> &quot;In the original speech she's talking of the time when he proposed to
her, and I  just had the image of bells, this image of them sitting on the
hillside with the sound  of bells in the distance. In hindsight, I also think
it's a lovely way to start an album: a  feeling of celebration that puts me on a
hillside somewhere on a sunny afternoon and  it's like, mmh...Sounds of
celebration get fewer and fewer. We haven't many left.  And yet people complain
of the sound of bells in cities.&quot;
</P>
<P> Why's Davey Spillane playing a Macedonian air on his Uillean pipes in the 
middle of it? &lt;Note that Kate has not identified this music as such, only the
idiot  interviewer. It may or may not be correct.-- IED&gt;
</P>
<P> &quot;It was one of those, 'Oh what the hell' things. That seems to have
been the  way with a lot of this album. Sort of 'Oh god! Tut...Will it work?
Ooh, er...' Then  when I've eventually just gone for it, it seems to have
worked.&quot; 
</P>
<P>LOVE AND ANGER
</P>
<P> &quot;This song! This bloody song!
</P>
<P> &quot;It was one of the most difficult to put together, yet the first to be
written. I  came back to it 18 months later and pieced it together. It doesn't
really have a story.  It's just me trying to write a song, ha-ha.
</P>
<P> &quot;Obviously the imagery you get as a child is very strong. This is
about who you  can or cannot confide in when there's something you can't talk
about. 'If you can't  tell your sister, If you can't tell a priest...' Who did I
have in the lyrics? Was it  sister or mother? I can't remember.&quot; &lt;She
got it right, though. -- IED&gt; 
</P>
<P>THE FOG
</P>
<P> Featuring Kate's dad, the good doctor Bush, plus Nigel Kennedy and some 
wicked seagull imitations. It seems to be more about ponds and swimming pools 
than pea-soupers.
</P>
<P> &quot;It's about trying to grow up. Growing up for most people is just
trying to stop  escaping, looking at things inside yourself rather than outside.
But I'm not sure if  people ever grow up properly. It's a continual process,
growing in a positive sense.&quot; 
</P>
<P>REACHING OUT
</P>
<P> &lt;Note that Kate apparently refused to comment at all to this moron about
this  song and Deeper Understanding. In IED's opinion this fact is a kind of
warning to  us about Kate's attitude toward this interview. -- IED&gt;
</P>
<P> After papa, Kate's &quot;reaching out for Mama&quot;. Another song about
children  beginning to experience the adult world. &quot;See how the child
reaches out  instinctively/To feel how fire will feel.&quot; Probably the least
developed work on The  Sensual World but it does have strange strings arranged
by Michael Nyman. &lt;This is  the kind of idiotic remark that IED most despises
the British music press for  making. How anyone could describe Reaching Out as &quot;the
least developed  work&quot;--whatever that means--is inconceivable to IED. And
the airheaded follow-up  (why are the strings &quot;strange&quot;, and why the &quot;but&quot;?)
is all too typical, as well.  Incidentally, the strings, Kate fans will notice,
are arranged for exactly the same  rather unusual configuration as the strings
for Cloudbusting : string sextet. Kate  described in some detail how she
composed that string part--by creating the six  &quot;voices&quot; on the
Fairlight, and then getting someone in to transcribe them for strings.  The
chances are this is how these strings were arranged. -- IED&gt;

<P>HEADS WE'RE DANCING
</P>
<P> I found it really funny, bit strange in a way... &lt;FUNNY? MORON!&gt;
</P>
<P> &quot;That's a very dark song, not funny at all!&quot;
</P>
<P> ' It was '39, before the music started. ' Did you write it to tie in with
the war  anniversary?
</P>
<P> &quot;No, purely coincidental. I wrote the song two years ago, and in lots
of ways I  wouldn't write a song like it now. I'd really hate it if people were
offended by  this...But it was all started by a family friend, years ago, who'd
been to dinner and  sat next to this guy who was really fascinating, so
charming. They sat all night  chatting and joking. And next day he found out it
was Oppenheimer. And this friend  was horrified because he really despised what
the guy stood for.
</P>
<P> &quot;I understood the reaction, but I felt a bit sorry for Oppenheimer. He
tried to  live with what he'd done, and actually, I think, committed suicide.
</P>
<P> &quot;But I was so intrigued by this idea of my friend being so taken by
this person  until they knew who they were, and then it completely changing
their attitude.
</P>
<P> &quot;So I was thinking, what if you met the Devil? The Ultimate One:
charming,  elegant, well spoken.
</P>
<P> &quot;Then it turned into this whole idea of a girl being at a dance and
this guy  coming up, cocky and charming, and she dances with him. Then a couple
of days  later she sees in the paper that it was Hitler. Complete horror: she
was that close,  perhaps could've changed history.
</P>
<P> &quot;Hitler was very attractive to women because he was such a powerful
figure, yet  such an evil guy. I'd hate to feel I was glorifying the situation,
but I do know that  whereas in a piece of film it would be quite acceptable, in
a song it's a little bit  sensitive.&quot; 
</P>
<P>DEEPER UNDERSTANDING
</P>
<P> Bizarrely balancing the ancient voices of Bulgaria with lyrics and effects
from  the computer age. Dark, lonely songs &lt;songs?&gt; about someone betrayed
by humanity,  finding solace in the friendship of a clever black box that sings
like Sparky. 'As the  people grow colder/I turn to my computer...I press
Execute.' Bleak and disturbing,  almost as morbid as some of her early creations
&lt;Huh?&gt; and elevated by Yanka  Rupkina's emotional solo. 
</P>
<P>BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN
</P>
<P> &quot;It's about a relationship being a very finely balanced thing that can
be easily  thrown off by a third party. The whole thing really came from a line
in The  Godfather, during some family argument, when Marlon Brando says, 'Don't 
interfere, it's between a man and a woman.' It's exploring the idea of trying to
 keep a relationship together, how outside forces can break into it...Rubbish
really,  but I quite like the cello.&quot; &lt;That's she said, folks...to this
jerk interviewer,  anyway...-- IED&gt; 
</P>
<P>NEVER BE MINE 
</P>
<P>&quot; Ooh, the thrill and the hurting... I know that this will never be
mine. &quot;
</P>
<P> Kate and the Bulgars again, supported by Spillane's Irish piping.
</P>
<P> &quot;It's that whole thing of how, in some situations, it's the dream you
want, not  the real thing. It was pursuing a conscious realisation that a person
is really enjoying  the fantasy and aware it won't become reality. So often you
think it's the end you  want, but this is actually looking at the process that
will never get you there. Bit of a  heart-game you play with yourself.&quot; 
</P>
<P>ROCKET'S TAIL (For Rocket)
</P>
<P> &quot;Rocket's my cat, but it was written for the Bulgarian girls.
Ridiculous collection  of images, &lt;Just read the lyrics and you'll see
immediately that Kate is deliberately  deflecting the request for an
explanation. This is not a &quot;ridiculous collection of  images&quot;! -- IED&gt;
nothing to do with Rocket, really. He just started it all off.
</P>
<P> &quot;At the time the only song I could think of that mentioned rockets was
Rocket  Man &lt;which, by the time she was working with the Bulgarians, Kate had
already  agreed to record a cover version of for the forthcoming Elton
John/Bernie Taupin  tribute album&gt;, but since then there have been about
three of them. I feel a bit like  the Python sketch with that guy making
eight-millimetre films, saying, 'Hitchcock  had his Rear Window out while mine
was still at the chemists'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>THIS WOMAN'S WORK
</P>
<P> &quot;It was written for John Hughes's film, She's Having a Baby. Really
light  comedy about this young guy who gets married, very much a kid. His wife
is  pregnant and it's all right until they get to the hospital, and the baby's
in the breach  position.
</P>
<P> &quot;That's the sequence I had to write the song about, and it's really
very moving,  him in the waiting room, having flashbacks of his wife and him
going for walks,  decorating...It's exploring his sadness and guilt: suddenly
it's the point where he  has to grow up. He'd been such a wally up to this
point.&quot; 
</P>
<P>WALK STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE
</P>
<P> The most positive &lt;Positive? Positive ?&gt; statement on The Sensual
World, and  featuring some of Kate's most remarkable vocals to date. Perhaps
even an  impression of a howler monkey?
</P>
<P> &quot;My mother thought it was a peacock--she was looking for a peacock,
isn't that  sweet? I fancied being Captain Beefheart at that point, and it just
came to me:  standing out, calling for help in the middle. It just went, 
'BBRRRROOOOAAAAAAAAA'.
</P>
<P> &quot;It's the idea of how our fear are sometimes holding us back, and yet
there's  really no need to be frightened. Like The Fog : being scared because
the water's  deep, you could be being scared because the water's deep, you could
be drowned;  drowned; but actually if you put your feet down the bottom's there
and it's only  waist high, so what's the problem? Just get on with it: that's
what I'm trying to tell  myself. .bf ital
</P>
<P> &quot;Walk Straight Down the Middle came together very quickly. It's about 
following either of two extremes, when you really want to plough this path
straight  down the middle. Rather than 'WAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH': being thrown from 
one end of the spectrum to the other. I'd like to think of myself as holding the
 centre, whereas in fact I'm--'WAAARRRRGGGGHHHH'--taking off all the  time.&quot;
