<P>Tete A Kate 
</P>
<P>by Tim Lott 
</P>
<P>Record Mirror, October 7 1978 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed By Ron Hill] 
</P>
<P> The rock and roll business usually brings up its fair share of prima
donnas,  ready to grab what they can and cast off their friends and roots. The
hit singles and  fame happened very quickly for KATE BUSH but she remains a
human being. 
</P>
<P>Enough of her flesh, her bones, her erogenous zones. Physical obsession has 
become redundant. Kate Bush is, as she never tires of emphasising, a member of
the  human race, not a musical hybrid of the girlie mag fantasy woman. She's
clinging  onto that humanity with obsessional determination despite her
circumstances sliding  further and further away from that &quot;normality&quot;
she holds desperately and dearly. 
</P>
<P>Her abnormality has never been more apparent than in this setting: a L100 at
 night, two floor leather-and-flowers suite at the Montcalm Hotel, Marble Arch.

</P>
<P>She has just been interviewed by &quot;Ritz&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;.
Attended by two press  officers, she is, despite her protestations, a star, a
true star, by virtue of her immense  success, her pink skin and her Page 3
curves. 
</P>
<P>A number one single (an international hit) a number one album and immense 
publicity: Kate Bush is a phenomenon. The fate that befalls such animals - 
arrogance, self-indulgence, mania - has yet to manifest its symptoms, partially 
because this particular phenomenon is dedicated to the preservation of her
personal  reality. 
</P>
<P>Nervous 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not really aware of being subjected to any starmaking machine.&quot;

</P>
<P>She tap her fingers on the chrome and glass table in the only nervous
gesture she  possesses. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I know that might sound odd, but I've really no idea about it. The
record  company thought this hotel would be practical. I thought it would be
nice. It's quite  a trip for me to be here. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't walk in here and say 'where are the flowers? Where is my 
champagne?' 
</P>
<P>&quot;I hope I haven't become a prima donna yet. I really mean that. I
really, really  resent that a lot. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's nice if you're on the road that you should have somewhere nice to
sleep. But  I'm not into the 'Oh, Dahling!' bit, and everybody having a Rolls
Royce.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It sounds almost defensive, but one subject that Bush is totally convincing
about is  how critical she considers her grasp on her own situation. 
</P>
<P>She has reached a point already of being such a valuable property to EMI 
Records that she is at the point of being able to control her immediate destiny.

</P>
<P>The interviews she does are her own choice - &quot;I want to get into as
many areas as  I can. So I did the fashion magazines and &quot;Vegetarian&quot;
and &quot;The Sun&quot;. I'm testing  the water. 
</P>
<P>She says that she is, quote, into people. People, of course, reciprocate,
and therein  lies the danger. A surfeit of attention killed Janis Joplin and,
more lately, put Ply  Styrene into a mental home. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have some person principles I stick by, though they are pretty free.
They don't  just apply to the press. They are my way of living. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have tried to avoid an 'image'. If you have an image you intend to
maintain, it's  going to be very difficult, because you're going to get holes in
your image. I may be  that animal 'Kate Bush' a bit when I'm offstage, but
mostly, I'm me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate spends most of her time with a smile on her face that look straight at
you,  but she looks away and almost shutters for a moment. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The things I don't like doing is... is... going to these sort of
parties that you  hear about. I don't go to parties. I find that sort of thing
very unhealthy. In fact I  find them disgusting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She pronounces the word 'parties' like you or I might pronounce some vile 
disease or weird sin. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not me. I'm basically a quiet person. When I get the time, I like
to go home.  I clean up the flat - which is a mess, because I'm never there. And
I get some  friends around that maybe I haven't seen for a long time. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not a question of insulating myself. This is something that is
extremely  important to me - I'm very much a human being, and I don't want to
lose that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You don't have to believe all the sycophants. I am aware that in my
position I am  both vulnerable and very powerful. People are always trying to
grab a piece of your  pie. But it can only be down to you to get yourself out
of... er... a vulnerability  situation.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This tiny vision is both unusual and predictable; the first because she is
so damn  scientific, the second because she is so blatantly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>She takes a relentlessly practical approach to her career - &quot;I have to
look at it in a  realistic way&quot; - and admits that she trusts no-one at all.
On the other hand she  believes like many before her, that she can have her cake
and eat it, that she can be  a star and not a star, that she can somehow escape
the pre-requisite of her job - to  give, and give, and still give, at the
expense of, at the very least, a part of her  personality. 
</P>
<P>&quot;People might call me it, but I'm not a star,&quot; she says, and I
think she almost  believes it. &quot;I'm just a person who writes songs that, at
the moment, people happen  to like. 
</P>
<P>&quot;They might not like anything on the next album: in which case I'll
still be the  same.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Except that she'll be a failed star. Kate has yet to reach the point of
acceptance  that things will never be the same. Her family, her friends will
inevitably take  second place and some will disappear. The blue-print is there,
and inescapable. 
</P>
<P>Or maybe I'm wrong, and Kate has more strength of mind than I dare hope. 
Maybe. She is certainly convinced, and that's half the battle. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You don't have to make yourself an island. In your head, you know what
you  are.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Illusions 
</P>
<P>&quot;The only person with you all your life is you. Your parents die.
Things inside you  die - illusions, gushes of personality. Only you can sort
yourself out. Yourself may not  be all you need, but it's all you got.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Whatever problems have still to hit Kate, she is as mentally well prepared
as  anyone could be. A precious - in the real sense of the word - teenager, her
defenses  are rooted in her very successful self-adjustment. 
</P>
<P>After reading the teaching of the philosopher Gurdjieff, which made an
enormous  impression on her, she came to the conclusion that human beings were
all a load of  shit anyway, which is an enormous help with any ego problems that
might present  themselves. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Look around you just a little bit and you realise that you're nothing.
Look at the  world, the universe - this is getting very hippyish, right? - but
we are very small. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And yet everybody goes around thinking how incredible they are - you
know, I  am it, I am everything. 
</P>
<P>&quot;People are obsessed by themselves. I am even. I find myself thinking
about  myself a lot. &quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate sees this, to a certain extent, as an evil suffered through lack of
mental  discipline, of which she wishes she possessed more. She wants, she says,
to be a  &quot;better human being.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Because I'm in the position I am I have an incredible chance of being
able to do  that. I'm in a position where I have power to help people - by doing
charity shows,  spreading the word about whales... I don't know.&quot; 
</P>
<P>With her peace and love philosophies, her conservation ideals, her Gurdjieff
satin  'n' tat post sixties glamour, and her vegetarian obsession, it's not
surprising that  she has been mistaken several times for that anachronistic
chestnut, the &quot;hippy&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not a hippy, though I thought the potential of the movement was
enormous.  I was too young, really. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was never particularly into drugs. I don't even get into alcohol
very much. Just  nicotine really. I smoked my first cigarette at the age of 9.&quot;

</P>
<P>She experimented with drugs, though - marijuana and something she never 
managed to identify. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've never taken acid. I don't think I'm into things like that. I've
seen a lot of  people screwed up through it. The idea of it is really
fascinating, though - to be able  to see the room breathe, and stuff like that.

</P>
<P>&quot;There must be a way for you to do it without drugs.&quot;
</P>
<P>Kate, nevertheless, has her trite addictions, innocent though they are. She
is, for  instance, hooked on chocolate, which she says she has a physical
craving for. Food is  drug enough. 
</P>
<P>How long that situation holds remains to be seen. Kate is about to
experience  pressures she can only guess at, by embarking on a major tour,
reaching Britain in  February. 
</P>
<P>This, she is told, is not a necessity, the album would still sell without
it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But I feel it's a really important thing for an artist to do. It's the
only chance  people who really like you get to see you without media
obstruction.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate is in the very unusual position of being a young, inexperienced artist
who  isn't being forced into any compromises. EMI has exerted pressures for her
to  hurry her new album, something she refuses point blank to do. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have to. If you're not ready, then you can't give it to them. There
is no way  you can rush an artistic thing to meet a business deadline. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If you blow that artistic,&quot; she laughs at her own grammatical
gaff, &quot;you're going  to lose so much for nothing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've been really lucky, I have. I [It???] often terrifies me, and I
wonder, why? I  think it's a very karmic thing - what you give you, you get
back.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate has Good Karma. She does nothing to bely her apparently angelic nature.
It  gets difficult to stomach that anyone can be so thumper. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Actually,&quot; she jibes, &quot;I mug old ladies. Would you like me
to smash a window or  something? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Seriously, I recognise flaws in myself, and try to keep them quiet. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a drag to throw your faults around for other people to see. But I
do  recognise flaws in myself, of course. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't, for instance, like hearing very truthful thing about myself.
It's hard to  give examples without giving away very personal things, like
within the family, but I  get really indignant. I put a lot of defenses up. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And I can be stubborn. I might have a strong idea in my brain and it's
hard to  thrash it out with anyone else, though the idea could be wrong.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Emotion 
</P>
<P>&quot;Also, I'm very soft. My emotion just gets in the way, sometimes at
business  meetings - my intellect does not have control over my passions. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Still I don't know anyone who hates me. Why should anyone? I don't do 
anything to make them. There are, after all, very few people I dislike.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Tread carefully here Lott. 
</P>
<P>The assumption is very easy after quotes of such a... gentle nature, that
Kate  Bush is a sort of talented blancmange, determined to be like, a rock 'n'
roll goody  twoshoes. 
</P>
<P>I don't think that's true. Though people complimenting people was never one
of  my hobbies, I went to meet this cherub with some determination to find the
brat  inside, or at least expose the milky veneer as a good PR. I got a glimpse
of neither. 
</P>
<P>This lead me to suspect that Kate Bush is actually for real. She is not a 
hippy-dippy altruist or a walking media exercise. She is what she seems: a
teenager  with a clear head, and obvious talent. 
</P>
<P>The vision will probably crack as the Biz tightens its grip on her swan-like
neck,  but at the moment Kate Bush is a creature I thought extinct: a phenomenon
with  ideals. 
</P>
<P>This thing of beauty may not be a joy forever, but least acknowledge it
while it  lasts.
