<P>Date: Sun, 7 Jan 90 05:42:46 EST <BR> From: chris@world.std.com
(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: Music Express (Can.) by Mary
Dickie Jan. 1990 
</P>
<P>This is an article for the Canadian magazine &quot;Music Express&quot; or &quot;ME&quot;
Jan. '90 
</P>
<P> The front cover has a small picture of Kate that is nothing short of
amazing. It is  a vertical oval about 4&quot; high, with the word &quot;BUSHWACKED&quot;
beside it. In it, Kate is  standing facing slightly to her right, her right arm
across her stomach, her right  hand under her left elbow, her left hand held
just below her throat. She's wearing a  midnight blue, crushed velvet,
off-the-shoulder dress. It looks antique. She is  wearing one gold hoop earring.
She is looking up and to her left, head tilted slightly  back and to her left.
The picture is very bluish, I don't know if it's lighting or  tinting, probably
both. The only non-blue elements in the composition are her lips  and the
earring. It is one of the most beautiful photos Vickie and I have ever seen of 
Kate, It's just to small.

<P>Woman's Work 
</P>
<P>by Mary Dickie 
</P>
<P>[There are two intro pieces; the first, over the byline on the facing page
is; ]
</P>
<P> Gender confusion has never been an issue in the reclusive Kate Bush's
elegant,  lush, evocative music, but the diminutive diva sees her new album, The
Sensual  World, as her most &quot;female&quot; work yet. 
</P>
<P>[The second in the first column of the right hand page is; ]
</P>
<P> This story begins with the ringing of a telephone - a special line set up
as a  promo gimmick. as it connects, a tiny, perfect English voice says, &quot;Hello,
this is Kate  Bush, and this is The Sensual World&quot;. There follows several
minutes of tinkling  music that sounds half Irish and half Middle Eastern,
accompanying some murmers  from that unmistakable voice. Apparently, after an
absence of four long years, Kate  Bush is back in the limelight. 
</P>
<P> What does that mean to the music world? Well, a lot to some people and not 
much to others, because Kate Bush is the kind of performer that receives
extremely  polarized reactions (it's been said that her voice is either Minnie
Mouse or the  Heavenly Host, depending on the listener). Ever since The Kick
Inside - a collection  of airy songs that stood in marked contrast to the punk
and new wave then  dominating the scene - came out when she was 19, Kate has
built up a following that  includes some of the most devoted fans anywhere,
while a large segment of the  record-buying public remains immune to her charms.

</P>
<P>That disparity is partly geographical - although Kate's albums routinely top
the  British charts, she's always had a harder time in North America, where she
enjoys  little more than cult status. But for every person who moans and groans
and rolls  their eyes at the sound of Kate's unusual, eerie melodies and breathy
voice, there's  at least one who has found some kind of personal salvation in
her deliberately  enigmatic and mystical story-poems, her dance-y videos and her
otherworldly  singing style. 
</P>
<P>Kate herself seems to have no problem with that diversity of reactions. &quot;It's
 impossible for me to know how other people hear my music,&quot; she says. &quot;I
think the  wonderful thing about art is that it's all down to the receiver as to
whether they  like it or not, what they see in it, how they feel about it. It's
a totally personal  relationship between that piece of work and that person, and
a really special thing. I  just continually think how extraordinary it is,
really, that people do want to hear my  stuff, especially when I take so long to
make records, you know.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And Kate does take a long time to make records. The Sensual World has been 
four years in the making, and now that it's finished she'll admit to a few
qualms  about how it's going to go over. &quot;I spend a lot of my time away
from everything, in  the studio, and I don't know if people are going to like it
or not,&quot; she says. &quot;The  more time it takes to make, the more you
think, 'Oh, my God, they're just not  going to think it's worth having spent all
that time on!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, there's no question that people want to hear her stuff, and a
consid-erable  number think it's well worth waiting for. In fact, for those of
us who have some  how remained unaware of the impact Kate has had on some
people's lives, the  amount of adulation she receives from her fans and the
dizzing heights to which they  raise her are astounding. For example, a copy of
Breakthrough, a {defunct} Kate  fanzine, includes sprited discussions of Issues
Kate has raised in her work, drawings,  elaborate personal interpre-tations of
songs, and a quiz which includes provocative  questions like: &quot;What are
Kate's thoughts on revenge?&quot; and &quot;What is Kate's own  explanation of
the meaning of Sat In Your Lap ?&quot; There's even detailed advice on 
vegatar-ianism, for those who want to go the full nine yards in their Bush
emulation. 
</P>
<P>But now that The Sensual World is finished, it's time for Kate to emerge to
face  the public, or at least a few journalists. Kate dosen't like flying, so
interviews have  to be done on her home turf in Kent, England - round-table
style, with groups of six  writers sharing 15 precious minutes with her.
Meanwhile, the record company has  held back copies of The Sensual World &quot;so
as not to diminish the impact&quot; of the first  hearing at the listening party
that's been scheduled prior to the interviews. It's  hard not to get the initial
impression that Kate is some sort of rare and fragile bird,  protected by and
coddled by her record company, her management and her  boyfriend/engineer, Del
Palmer, who hovers around the edge of the room  throughout the marathon session.

</P>
<P>But nothing could be further from the truth. In spite of being very ( very )
small,  Kate is no delicate flower; she's a woman who, from the beginning, has
taken an  unusual amouny of control over the direction of her career. Kate has
been writing  songs since she was a child, but she got her big break at 16, when
Pink Floyd's David  Gilmour helped her record a three-track demo that got her
signed to EMI. Then,  after The Kick Inside and it's single Wuthering Heights,
shot up the British charts  in 1978, there was pressure on her to churn out
another LP, and Lionheart came out  the next year. However, with each successive
album - Never For Ever in 1980, The  Dreaming in 1982, Hounds Of Love in 1985
and now The Sensual World - Kate has  taken progressively more time to work on
the songs, and also expanded her control  over things, learning production
techniques, directing her videos and gradually  upgrading her recording studio
to professional levels. 
</P>
<P>Now Kate may be part of the record industry, but she can insist on doing it
her  own way. That means minimal publicity and contact with the public, and no
touring  (although she continually toys with the idea). It also means keeping
things close to  home and in the family - one brother is in her band, another is
her legal advisor and  photographer, her father contributes a vocal to the new
album, and her mother runs  the fan club. 
</P>
<P>Most importantly, it means that she can work in a style that, even by the
lenient  standards of the music industry, could be called idiosyncratic, even
eccentric. Kate  writes and produces her albums for the most part by herself,
painstakingly working  in her own studio with just her boyfriend to help her
record them. That's why they  take so long to appear. 
</P>
<P>As Kate explains, that method of working is necessary to get the results
she's  looking for, and has a direct influence on the finished product. &quot;I
feel in many ways  that The Sensual World is my most personal album, and I think
a lot of that's  directly to do with the way we worked on it,&quot; she says. &quot;I
think that having just the  two of us in the studio, being very isolated, has
made it much easier for me to get  things across, because I'm dealing with
someone who knows what I'm trying to  say, rather than three or four people who
keep changing. The problem with  commercial studios is that there are so many
distractions and strangers, which makes  me nervous. To be at home and be so
relaxed, working with someone I know and  love so much, gives it a very intimate
and special feeling. It's not always easy, but I  wouldn't have it any other
way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate also says she frequently has to get completely away from the studio,
and even  from the songs themselves. &quot;That's really because after intense
periods of work, I'd  feel I couldn't go any further,&quot; she says. &quot;Sometimes
I'd just be so bored by the  songs that I wanted to take a break - I was so sick
of listening to them and not being  able to get anywhere with them. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Also, I need to take breaks to write lyrics, which I find impossible
to do - so  difficult. It's just a very long process of draft after draft,
continually trying to tighten  up the words. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There were also periods on this album when I just couldn't write,&quot;
she  continues. &quot;I found it very difficult to know what I wanted to say,
and I kept sort of  hitting this block. So I took breaks, and that was all I
needed. I spent time at home,  did gardening - very earthy sorts of things.
Things I really needed, because you  know all my work was coming through my
head.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is, according to Kate, something of a departure of her in
that  besides being her most personal, it's also her most &quot;female&quot;
album. What does she  mean by that? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I'm not sure what I mean, except that's how it feels to me,&quot;
she laughs. &quot;I  suppose what I'm trying to say is that some of the songs
feel like I'm writing them  as a female, which is not necessarily something I've
felt strongly before. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think people tend to presume that when you are female you write from
a  female point of view, but I'm not sure I always have, really. A lot of my
songs have  been written from a man's point of view, or a child's point of view
- I've never  necessarily felt like a female writer. In fact, I think in the
past I've very much  enjoyed not writing as a female. It's kind of like writing
stories - you don't really  want to be yourself; you want to put yourself into
other situations that are much  more interesting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This time, however, Kate's into the &quot;positive female energy&quot;
thing. The song The  Sensual World, for example, was inspired by the famous
monologue at the end of  James Joyce's Ulysses by Molly Bloom (amusingly
misidentified as &quot;Wally Blue&quot; in  the press information). But more
than that, it's the sound of the album that makes it  different. 
</P>
<P>As Kate explains, &quot;Although Hounds Of Love was definitly a female work
of art,  from a sound point of view I wanted to get the sense of power I
associate with male  music - strong rhythms, big drum sounds, very sort of male
energy sounds. But I just  didn't necessarily want to go for that anymore.&quot;

</P>
<P>But if big drums are male energy sounds, what are female energy sounds? &quot;Well,
 I think that unfortunatly most female sounds in rock music are dissipated by
male  sounds, because generally it's the males who are producing and playing the
 insturments,&quot; she says. &quot;So I'm not sure there is a strong female
sound in  contemporary music. There is in ethnic music, though. Now the
Bulgarian singers  [The Bulgarian State Choir and Orchestra, an all-female choir
whose haunting  Mystere Des Voix Bulgare album and tour took music lovers by
storm last year] -  that's very much female music, from a strong female point of
view. I think it has a  tremendous intensity because of that, and it's very
unusual for us to hear that kind  of positive female strength, which you don't
really find in contemporary music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate found herself so inspired by the Bulgarian singers that she wound up
using  three of them, the Trio Bulgarka, to contribute vocals to three songs on
The Sensual  World. The interweaving of the Bulgarian voices with Kate's is
particuarly startling  on Rocket's Tale, which she wrote with the trio in mind
(and which, in spite of its  rarefied sound, turns out to be named for her cat
). But the singing of these women  (Yanka Rupkhina, Eva Georgieva and Stoyanka
Boneva) seems to have had a lasting  impact on Kate, as well as setting the tone
for the whole album. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The first time I heard them sing was just after we finished the last
album,&quot; she  says. &quot;My brother Paddy, who listens to a lot of ethnic
music, heard them on Radio  Sofia, and he played me a tape. And I could not
believe it. It was just devastating, as  it is for everyone the first time they
hear it. It's like angels, isn't it? And when I  was thinking about making
another album, I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if  perhaps we could work try
working together!' That was scary for me, because their  music is so good - you
don't want to drag them down to your level, you know? I  mean, funky Bulgarians
would be just terrible!&quot; 
</P>
<P>In any case, Kate eventually made the trip to Sofia, Bulgaria, to meet the
singers,  and rehearsed with them for three days. As she says, &quot;It was just
incredible - some  of the purest musical communication I've ever had, and we
didn't have any other  language in common, because they don't speak English and
I don't speak  Bulgarian!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Besides Bulgarian singers, books - which have been a continuing source of 
inspiration ever since Wuthering Heights - and cats, what else inspires Kate to
write  songs? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think relationships are probably what continually entice me,
as well as  films and books,&quot; she says. &quot;And conversations with
people. They're all very much  inspirational things. Just ideas, and things
people might have said that sparked  something. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But it's interesting how most of these things originated long ago, and
maybe four  or five years later they're regurgitated into an idea,&quot; she
continues. &quot;Like  Cloudbusting [on the Hounds Of Love LP) - that was
originally from a book I read  nine years before I wrote the song! It struck me
very deeply, but it took a long time  to step back enough to write the song,
because it was a very powerful experience  for me. I think sometimes the more
powerful something is, the more you're scared  of it. You're a bit wrapped up in
it, and it takes time to move back, to perhaps see  how you could look at it
differently.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One song, This Woman's Work was inspired by, of all things, a John Hughes 
movie - She's Having A Baby. Says Kate: &quot;It's a light film, very comic,
about a  young guy whose wife gets pregnant, and everything remains light until
they get to  the hospital, and suddenly she's rushed away and he's left sitting
there. You get the  impression that this is the moment when he has to start
growing up. Up until then  he's been a kid, and very happily so. It's a lovely
piece of film, and in some ways  it's an exploration of guilt, I guess. 
</P>
<P>And now for the age-old question, the one that Kate doesn't like: what about
 touring? Kate has done only one tour in her career, way back in 1979, and
though  she said she enjoyed it, it looks as though she won't do it again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why do people still ask me if I'm going to tour?&quot; she say's,
incredulously. &quot;I  haven't toured in ten years! I mean it's absolutely
ridiculous!&quot; Perhaps it's because  she hedges so much about it, never quite
coming out and saying that she'll never do  it again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A lot of people of people think I hated touring, and that's why I
haven't done it  again,&quot; she acknowledges. &quot;But actually I really
enjoyed it. Sometimes I think I would  like to, but I guess I'm scared of
commiting myself to something like that again. I  found it very tiring, and it
was really difficult for me to do anything for a very long  time afterwards...&quot;

</P>
<P>As everyone who's seen Kate's videos knows, she definitely has an interest
in  the theatrical, and her live show was reportedly full of stage antics and
special  effects. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was very much influenced by dance and theatre at the time, and I
really  wanted to do something special with the show,&quot; she explains. &quot;But
recently,  especially over these past two albums, it's been very important for
me to spend time  being a songwriter. I didn't want to be a performer. I didn't
feel like a performer,  and I didn't want to be exposed to all that it entails.
I wanted to spend some tome  alone at home and just be a songwriter and not be
out there in front of everyone. I  feel very exposed, doing that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What about other people's music? Does she listen to records? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I tend not to listen to music too much when I'm working on an album,&quot;
she says,  adding, &quot;it's so intense that when I get home I like to watch
things instead. But in  between I like to listen. Right now I'm listening to the
new John Lydon album,  which is fantastic! It's really good!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Although she will admit to missing audience contact, Kate has a large and
steady  following and can afford to remain in her Kent cocoon, insulated from
and even  unaware of trends in music - even if she did happen to hit upon one
with the  Bulgarian choir. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I was trying to be hip, I wouldn't stand much of a chance,&quot;
she laughs.  &quot;Because by the time my record came out, four or five years
later, it would be so  passe! I'd have to leave it for 10 years, so that it
would have time to come around  again!&quot; 
</P>
<P>------------------
</P>
<P>There are three pictures in the article, the first is the picture in which
she's  wearing blue jeans and a white blouse, is kneeling and is barefoot. In
the second she  is wearing a yellow blouse with a black grid pattern, a grey
scarf and black pants.  She's holding, with her left hand, what looks like an
electric mandolin. In the third  she is on her left knee with her right elbow
resting on her right knee. Her hair is  pulled over her right shoulder. She's
facing her right and looking to her upper left.  She is wearing what appears to
be black velvet, I can't tell much due to this damn  newsprint.
