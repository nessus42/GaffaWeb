<P>The Discreet Charm of Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>Parties bore her and world tours tire her. So what keeps Britain's number
one  female rock star singing for her supper? By Rosie Boycott 
</P>
<P> We all have preconceived notions of what superstars should be like. Larger
than  life on stage, we expect all these exaggerated qualities to be present in
the person  themselves. So I was not sure quite what to expect of Kate Bush. I
had heard she is a  terribly nice person; quiet, easy to talk to and
family-minded. But I found it hard to  associate this picture of Kate with her
stage image: the blatantly sexual, pouting  mouth; the high, almost freaky
voice; the live body that twists and gyrates under the  lights. Above all, could
that enormous talent belong to someone who insists she is an  ordinary
home-loving girl? Which side was the facade? 
</P>
<P>I went to talk to her at her parents' home in Kent. Her mother and father, a
 local GP, live in a beautiful old, white farmhouse. Now incongrously surrounded
by a  council estate, the house has a high wooden fence which surrounds an
overgrown,  jungly garden--the type of place that can easily feed a young girl's
fantasy and  imagination. Inside, the house is warm and homely: dogs flop by the
fire, the phone  rings incessantly, the atmosphere is very family-orientated--no
sham here, the  Bushes genuinely enjoy being together. 
</P>
<P>Wearing a knitted skirt and jumper, Kate sits beside me on the sofa, nursing
a  cold, complaining about the weather--it is raining heavily--and talking with
ease and  warmth. Meeting her has not made it any easier to understand how
someone can be  one person in the flesh and another on stage, but the fact that
she is likeable and  unaffected is certainly no publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>Kate's arrival in the superstar ranks of the pop world was well timed. Not
for  her messing around at the lower end of the charts, waiting for the big
break which  would make her a household name. Her single, Wuthering Heights,
entered the  charts in early February 1978; and music lovers everywhere pricked
up their ears to  the entirely original, haunting, wailing sound of a
nineteen-year-old girl, striking  notes that seemed impossible and singing with
a strength of feeling that was almost  unnerving. Within six weeks, Wuthering
Heights had ousted Abba and their hit,  Take a Chance on Me, from the number one
spot. Kate Bush had arrived. 
</P>
<P>The stories which began circulating about her were numerous; she was EMI's
pet  product, signed up as a schoolgirl at the age of sixteen, and kept under
wraps until  the time was deemed right to spring her on the world. She was
reticent about giving  interviews, carefully shielded by her family, and
cossetted by the record company.  Everyone was fascinated, but finding
background information on this new star with  the dynamic, sexy stage persona
presented problems. Kate, for all her stardom,  was--and still is--a very
private person. 
</P>
<P>Twenty-three-year-old Kate Bush says publicity still makes her feel weird. &quot;It
 comes,&quot; she says, &quot;from seeing just how much I have done over the
last three years.  Sometimes I find it hard to understand people's interest in
me. I hate it when I feel  that someone is just after the scandalous details.
The most important part of my life  is my work.&quot; And with that we find
ourselves discussing her new album, due out in  February. 
</P>
<P>&quot;At the moment it hasn't got a title,&quot; she says. &quot;It has been
very hard to produce  because all the studios are so incredibly booked up, and
becuase I wanted to use one  engineer only. This is the first album that I have
actually produced myself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Inevitably, this has meant a great deal more responsibility for me.
But it is a  responsibility I like; I think that as soon as you get your hands
on the production, it  becomes your baby. That's really exciting for me, because
you do everything for  your own child. And I have been forced to think harder
about what is good and  what is not so good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I asked her if the vulnerability of that situation didn't worry her. &quot;Yes,
in a  way--but it is a stronger position, too, though I find that I now rely
much more on  other people's feetback--especially when I lack confidence about a
song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the past Kate says she used to find that her words and music came
together  with ease--now they take far more time. &quot;I like to leave all my
options open until  the last minute so that I'm really sure--like about the
title of an album, for instance.  I'm taking a complete break from recording at
the moment, going over songs,  tightening up lyrics and tunes, not going near
the studio. I've worked on this album  so intensely for so long that I seemed to
be losing sight of my direction. I really  wasn't sure what to do next--and that
has never happened to me before.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Everything she does, she says candidly, seems to get harder all the time: &quot;Anyone
 who is under the illusion that things get easier as you grow older is mistaken.&quot;
One  of the things that Kate has found harder is sorting out priorities. At the
beginning of  her fame she went with the whirl of the music business, the
glamour, the foreign  tours, the TV appearances. But she soon found that this
lifestyle did not suit her. For  one thing Kate hates parties (&quot;formal
occasions tailor-made for people not to talk to  each other&quot;); for another,
she found that it made her easily tired because her need  for perfection drove
her to work all night in order to be ready for a TV show. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The worst thing is not being prepared; I have to know, before I go on
stage,  exactly what I am going to do. Rehearsals may take hours but they have
to be done.&quot;  As a result, after just over a year of fame and when new
songs were beginning to be  expected from the star, she found herself
emotionally and physically drained: &quot;Out of  energy, ideas and inspiration.&quot;

</P>
<P>Now, she says, &quot;I make sure I have time to do everything; I turn down a
lot of  offers. I know that I need time for my family, my work, my dancing, my
practising.&quot;  When she is working hard--and that means anything up to
fifteen hours a day in  the studio--her home life is suspended. &quot;When I
come out of the studio, it is a bit  like being released from prison,&quot; she
jokes. &quot;I feel like a Martian. In the past, I  would have gone straight on
to a tour, a stage show or something. Now I decline the  offers and spend time
at home.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Home for Kate Bush means both her parents' house in Kent and the place that 
she and her brothers, Paddy and John, have bought about seven miles away. The 
location of the new house is a closely guarded secret &lt;no longer where Kate
herself  lives&gt; and they bought it so that trips up and down to London would
be easier. Home  also means seeing her friends--some new ones from the music
business, some old  ones from school days and from her brother's old band, with
whom Kate used to  sing before going solo. Finally, home means being with her
boyfriend, about whom  she is understandably secretive. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's hard because my life is so unpredictable. He's an artist, by the
way, but not  in the music business.&lt;This is a rare instance where Kate has
made an outright lie to  the press.&gt; It's the one area of my life that I
really do consider private. And I can't  keep it private unless I keep it close.&quot;

</P>
<P>Have three years as a superstar changed her at all? &quot;Yes,&quot; she
admits; &quot;I've  become a perfectionist, for one thing.&quot; Although not a
lonely teenager, she did spend  a lot of time on her own, singing, reading and
writing the poetry which forms the  basis of her songs. &quot;I wasn't a
daydreamer,&quot; she says. &quot;Writing songs and poetry is  putting into
words and music my real feelings. Without being too critical of  Wuthering
Heights, I do think that it was a bit misleading; it seemed to suggest too  much
fantasy and escapism&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate wants to dispel the notion that she is someone who writes about
fantasy. &quot;I  think my lyrics have a far tougher edge to them now. I always
thought that  ultimately I would be super tough...presuming that as I gathered
experiences I  would learn to accept situations for what they are. That has
worked in some ways,  but in others I'm far more vulnerable.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One new song on her next album has Kate talking about herself and her new 
awareness of life, its goals and inevitable pressures. &quot;The song is called
Get Out of  My House ,&quot; she says, &quot;and it's all about the human as a
house. The idea is that as  more experiences actually get to you, you start
learning how to defend yourself from  them. The human can be seen as a house
where you start putting up shutters at the  windows and locking the doors--not
letting in certain things. I think a lot of people  are like this--they don't
hear what they don't want to hear, don't see what they  don't want to see. It is
like a house, where the windows are the eyes and the ears,  and you don't let
people in. That's sad because as they grow older people should  open up more.
But they do the opposite because, I suppose, they do get bruised and  cluttered.
Which brings me back to myself; yes, I have had to decide what I will let  in
and what I'll have to exclude. 
</P>
<P>&quot;While I was working on this album I was offered a part in a TV series.
I've  been offered other acting roles, but this was the first totally creative
offer that has  ever come my way. I had to turn it down--I was already committed
to the album.  Sadly, I don't think that offer will be made again, but you have
to learn to let things  go, not to hang on and get upset, or to try to do it and
then end up making a mess of  everything else. It's like wanting to dance in the
studio when I'm recording--I want  to but I know that I can't because it will
just tire me. I wish I had the energy to do  everything,&quot; she says, sighing
at her limitations, &quot;but at least I'm healthy and fit.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate is one of those lucky people who never puts on weight. &lt;Well...&gt;
She's a  slim, elf-like, five foot three and has been a vegetarian since sixteen
because, she  says, &quot;I just couldn't stand the idea of eating meat--and I
really do think that it has  made me calmer.&quot; She smokes
occasionally--though she admits she shouldn't--and  hardly drinks. &quot;Champagne,
I love champagne...but I don't really call it alcohol!&quot;  She confesses that
she doesn't do breathing exercises, though she is very aware of  breath control
when she is singing. She regards her voice as a &quot;precious instrument:  it
can be affected by almost anything: my nerves, my mood, even the weather.&quot;
On  stage she's a bundle of energy--a complete contrast to the calm, mature,
pretty girl  who sits drinking coffee in the elegant farmhouse drawing room. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My plans for the future...&quot; she muses. &quot;Well, I want to get
into films. And I want  to do more on stage. I love staging my own shows,
working out the routines,  designing the whole package, and using every aspect
of my creativity.&quot; What kind of  films would she like to make? &quot;My
favourite is Don't Look Now. I was incredibly  impressed by the tension, the
drive and the way that every loose end was tied up. I  get so irritated by films
which leave ideas hanging.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Singing, she says, will always be with her. So will songwriting. Never
satisfied  with her voice or with her work, she strives all the time towards
some impossible  goal of perfection. &quot;But, I suppose,&quot; she says, &quot;that
if the day ever came when I was  100 per cent satisfied, that would be the day
that I stopped growing and  changing--my deatch knell.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Despite her stardom, Kate Bush has remained amazingly gentle and sensitive.
She  is well aware of how easy it would be to be sucked into the music business,
drained  of all her natural creativity in and artificial world. To her the most
important thing  is, &quot;To feel that I am progressing with my own life and my
work. I also desperately  want to feel some kind of happiness in what I am
creating. Not contentment,&quot; she  pauses, &quot;but pleasure.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I always feel,&quot; she concludes, &quot;that I can try harder. I
always feel that there isn't  enough time in this life to achieve all the things
that I want.&quot;
