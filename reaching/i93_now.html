<H2>Bush on film </H2>
<P>Evidently, British pop siren Kate Bush has a soft spot for Canada. Though
she  hates to fly, she made Toronto the only North American stop besides New
York on a  promo tour for her newest record, The Red Shoes, and the premiere of
her  directorial debut film, The Line, The Cross and The Curve. 
</P>
<P>The 50-minute short loosely links six songs from the album with the Red
Shoes  fairy tale of a dancer whose ballet slippers refuse to stop dancing. The
film is a far  cry from Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1948 classic. In
essence, it's a  long form video, and Bush is the first person to agree this
isn't the film she really  wanted to make. But since EMI is willing to pay for
it, why not answer when  opporunity knocks? 
</P>
<P>&quot;In a way, it was very restrictive because it's not my conceptual piece
from  scratch. Also, I'm working around the songs and I had to put myself into
the film. I  would've preferred to cast myself in a smaller role. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It wasn't the ideal situation because it was very rushed and we had
little money.  But it was an intense project. And I'm very glad I went through
it, even if the film  is not received well, because I learned so much.&quot;
