<P>Kate Bush Gets Her Kicks 
</P>
<P>by Jon Young 
</P>
<P>Trouser Press, July 1978. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to Tom Richards for supplying me with the 
tape.] 
</P>
<P>All of a sudden Kate Bush was at the very top of the UK singles charts.  &quot;Wuthering
Heights,&quot; her first 45, was number one and her album, The Kick Inside, 
wasn't doing badly either, sitting in the top five LPs. Whoosis? I wanted to
know. 
</P>
<P>So I got a hold of the album. On the cover, which could easily pass for a
Vogue  photo session, a spooky young woman with gigantic almont eyes clutched at
her head  as if trying to keep her odder thoughts from rising into public view.
No matter if she  succeeded, the album turned out to be unusual enough
regardless. Bush's songs are  based on simple piano chords utilized in clever
variations that nag at you much the  way Bryan Ferry's do. 
</P>
<P>The lyrics are striking, even at a casual glance, just because they are
about things  (rare) and because they avoid cliche's (rarer still); many tunes
are about sex, but with  none of the &quot;consuming bitch&quot; or the &quot;submissive
lady&quot; so often in weary evidence.  Instead, Kate espouses the view that,
blush, sex can be fun, maybe even a good idea:  &quot;...it could be love/Or it
could be just lust but it will be fun.&quot; Other numbers  concerned strange
phenomena, outlaws, and Emily Bronte, but through all of it came  a loopy
immediacy that distanced Kate from your average creaky balladeer. 
</P>
<P>Very well, but big deal, right? Well, as anyone who has heard even a few
seconds  of Kate Bush knows, the real kicker is... 
</P>
<P>Her voice! Depending on your reaction it's either Minnie Mouse or the
Heavenly  Host. Kate sings Up There where Laura Nyro and Joni Mitchell have
sometimes  tried to reach, but with an important difference: she's not striving,
that's where  she's at home. And it's not an affectation, feminine or otherwise.
The conviction  with which she sails along at that stratospheric pitch makes the
music seem eerie,  driven, and finally tough, despite its aerial quality. It
didn't take me long to conclude  that Kate was one of those genuine originals
that may not be destined for mass  acceptance (most people I know dislike the
record), but should be reckoned with on  the basic of her creative uniqueness
alone. 
</P>
<P>Enough ranting. When Kate Bush sat down to talk, I was curious to know her 
roots. 
</P>
<P>Born in Kent in 1958, she said she'd started out taking violin lessons, but 
&quot;couldn't get on with being taught it.&quot; So the rebellious 11-year-old
began fooling  around with the family piano, writing songs. That turned out much
better. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Every night for a couple of hours I'd sing and play. When I was 15 my
family  thought it would be a good idea to maybe meet some people in the music
business  and see if I could get some response from my songs... I think they
were pleased to  see I had something I could release myself in. They neither
encouraged me or  discouraged me, they just let me be myself, which is something
I'll always thank  them for.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sounds like progressive parents to me. Enter Kate's brother, who &quot;had a
friend  who'd been in the record business for a couple of years. He came around
to listen  to me. I put twenty to thirty of my songs on a tape and he'd take it
to record  companies. Of course there was no response; you wouldn't be able to
hear a thing,  just this little girl with a piano going 'yaaaa yaaaa' for hours
on end... [The songs]  weren't that good. They were OK, but...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Usually the only musicians who will disparage themselves are the vets who
have  had the time to acquire sufficient self-confidence. I wondered how the
artiste of the  early days differed from the current one. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I could sing in key but there was nothing there. It was awful noise,
it was really  something terrible. My tunes were more morbid and more negative.
That was a lot  of people's comment: they were too heavy. But then a lot of
people are saying that  about my current songs. The old ones were quite
different musically, vocally, and  lyrically. You're younger and you get into
murders...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Rejection was merely a small delay, though. Along came David Gilmour of Pink
 Floyd. &quot;Dave was doing his guardian angel bit and scouting for talent.
He'd already  found a band called Unicorn in a pub and was helping them. He came
along to see  me and he was great, such a human, kind person - and genuine. He
said, 'It looks as  if the only way you can do it is to put at most three songs
on a tape and we'll get  them properly arranged.' He put up the money for me to
do that, which is amazing.  No way could I have afforded to do anything like
that. EMI heard it and I got the  contract.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Indeed, so good were the Gilmour demos cut in 1975 that two of them ended up
 unchanged on the LP. Remember that in '75 Kate Bush was 17. 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside was produced by Andrew Powell in the summer of 1977, 
showcasing really hot-slick playing from some then Cockney Rebels and Pilots.
The  rest is chart history; chart history that would seem to have happened a
little too  quickly. In response to a question about future plans, Kate sounded
weary: &quot;I'm  actually pretty heavily committed until late autumn. The
trouble is that the records  moved so quickly and I don't think anyone expected
it. I found there are  commitments already that are going on and on.&quot; Or,
when asked about her reception  here in the US: &quot;The only people I can talk
about are the people in the company and  the interviewers. They're all great. I
figured they would be anyway, because when  you're talking to someone about
themself you're usually nice.&quot; Jaundiced so early  on? 
</P>
<P>The last three songs on Kick seem the most personal. &quot;Room for the Life&quot;
comes  across as a sort of &quot;I Am Woman&quot; glorifying childbirth. She
feels women have a  much stronger survival unit then men,&quot; since they can
bear children, and thus should  use their advantage to help men rather then play
games with them. I don't really  understand what she's talking about, but it can
be dismissed as a Heavy  Philosophical Matter, since she admitted to being in no
hurry for a baby herself. 
</P>
<P>When we turned to spiritual matter, she seemed to be on firmer ground.  &quot;Strange
Phenomena&quot; suggest that she believes in Other forces. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh yes, I do. The thing about us humans is that we consider ourselves
it, that we  know everything. I think we're abusing our power and are guided by
things we  don't know about that are much stronger then us. But you can't label
them if you  don't know what they are. Also, it tends to sound a bit trendy like
'the cosmic  forces' and it's cruel to do that because most religions have been
exploited. As long  as they're not misinterpreted they're good because they give
the individual  something to hold onto.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A cynical view of faith for someone who regards herself as a believer. Later
she  would make a similar response when describing Gurdjieff as &quot;the only
religion I've  been able to relate to&quot; and then quickly ending her sketchy
account with, &quot;I don't  really want to say much because I don't really have
the knowledge to say it.&quot; At no  time did she feel the need to justify
herself to anyone else; she must get enough  moral support from her own
instincts. 
</P>
<P>The last song on the album is the title cut, which contains opaque lines
like &quot;Your  sister I was born - you must lose me/Like an arrow shot into
the killer storm.&quot; Que  pasa, KB? 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's inspired by an old traditional song called 'Lucy Wan.' It's
about a young  girl and her brother who fall desperately in love. It's an
incredibly taboo thing. She  becomes pregnant by her brother and it's completely
against all morals. She doesn't  want him to be hurt, she doesn't want her
family to be ashamed or disgusted, so she  kills herself. The song is a suicide
note. She says to her brother, 'Don't worry. I'm  doing it for you.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>One of the best ways to look silly is to make predictions. Still, I suspect
Kate Bush  will have a lot of staying power. Her LP is so fully realized, and so
distinctive that if  her music progresses at all, she may well come to be one of
those creative voices that  everyone, pro and con, must take into account. Her
unapologetic self-assurance  never wanes and looks like the thing that will
allow continued exploration. 
</P>
<P>Musicians can reveal a lot about themselves when giving their opinion of the
new  wave, but Kate Bush did so intentionally. Professing an admiration for the
Stranglers  and Pistols, and the way the status quo had been shaken up, she went
on to say: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe it's ironic, but I think punk has actually done a lot for me in
England.  People were waiting for something new to come out - something with
feeling. If  you've got something to tell people, you should lay it on them.&quot;
