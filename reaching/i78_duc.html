<H3>    Bush Stands Alone
</H3>
<P>     by MOLLY FOWLER<BR>      Chronicle staff</P>
<P>    The '70s have proved to be      an era of women in the arts.</P>
<P>     In keeping, our musical      airwaves are filled with the      sounds
of women vocalists.</P>
<P>     Linda Ronstadt, Joni      Mitchell, Dolly Parton,      Stevie Nicks,
Bonnie Raitt,      Patti Smith, Joan Baez and      countless other women     
have aptly conquered the      recording arts industry. It      was an uphill
struggle, and      I seriously doubt anyone      wants to readily give up the   
  kingdom.</P>
<P>    In the meantime however,      competition is active. Is takes      more
than a good backup band,      or good lyrics. It takes      style...distinctive
style, and      even that's not enough. A lot of      good acts are cropping up
in all      parts, and most go unnoticed.</P>
<P>    One such woman is 19-year-old Kate Bush. Bush hails      from the Mother
Country,      where she currently enjoys a      reputation as a potential     
European best seller. Capitol      Records is into selling her to the     
States now. To date however,      Bush goes unnoticed.</P>
<P>    Kate Bush's current release,    <EM>The Kick Inside</EM> is an   
exceptionally brave first release LP.     She doesn't feel the need to     hide
behind someone else's     music, and that is seen not only in the    fact that
she writes all of the music, but in     her choice of a backup band.</P>
<P>    Most of the pieces are     backed by Bush on the piano.     In addition,
a subtle jazz-rock band that     includes Ian Bairnson and David Palon     from
Arista Records complements      and enhances rather than swallows her     voice.</P>
<P>    Exemplary is &quot;Saxophone      Song,&quot; which uses a blend of     
jazz and jazz-rock to a set of      bluesy Iyrics. It puts Bush into      the
artistic perspective of a      woman who can write good      lyrics for <EM>music</EM>
as well as she      writes <EM>music</EM> for <EM>lyrics</EM>. It puts     
Bush into the artistic      perspective of a woman who      can write well.</P>
<P>    Not to be omitted is Bush's      voice. Her range is almost     
unbelievable. At times it sounds      like two different vocalists in      the
same line of music. She also      maintains a sense of      playfulness in her
voice that is      seen in Maria Muldaur and in old live     Joni Mitchell cuts.
At times she sounds much    like Diana Ross, but the comparison is   
unnecessary.</P>
<P>In time, if she catches in the States, Bush will stand alone.</P>
