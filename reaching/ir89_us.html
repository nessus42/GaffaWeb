IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: U.S. radio interview from
December 1989 
</P>
<P>&lt;Here is part of a U.S. radio interview from December 1989. I do not know
the  origin of this interview. It was published in the maiden issue of a new
American  fanzine called Reaching Out, without specific identification. The
interview is  prefaced by a brief history of Kate's career. Edited by Andrew
Marvick from a  transcription by Cynthia Kiley.&gt; 
</P>
<P> Why was there such a long break between Hounds of Love and The Sensual 
World ? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, we did a compilation in between: The Whole Story. But,
um...really I  wanted to take a break. I&amp;csqd spent a long time in the
studio consistently, and  promoting, and I just wanted some space for myself, so
I took time at home and just  saw friends and just retreated a bit. I wanted to
look for something new to say on  the new album. I feel always as if I have to
make some distinct break between  albums, so that it's just not a continuation
of the one before.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why did you re-do the vocals on Wuthering Heights ? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, to be honest, I think if we'd had more time of other &lt;more
time!&gt;, I  probably would have done the same with a couple songs. I just felt
that Wuthering  Heights felt particularly dated. It sounded dated. The other
tracks were just kind of  holding their heads above water. And so we liked the
idea of re-doing the vocal and  remixing the track--not re-recording anything
else--just so we could bring it up to  date, so we could give it a more
contemporary sound.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why was Kevin Killen chosen to mix The Sensual World ? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a very intimate process for us, making albums, now. I spend most
of my  time with my recording engineer, Del Palmer. So really most of the time
it was just  the two of us. When I was writing and, um...Obviously we wanted to
bring someone  in who...we felt good with, but who obviously was a good person,
too. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I met Kevin, and I obviously liked his track record. I love what he's
worked on:  it's diverse, but it's also artists who put a tremendous amount of
personal care into  what they do. So I was looking for someone who responded to
artists. You know, I  wanted someone who knew what I wanted. And he was lovely
to work with. He  really was a pleasure to work with, and fitted into our very
close circle very easily  and, um...I think Kevin did a great job. Lovely
working with him. He really  understood what we were trying to say with the
music. It's difficult to bring  someone in at a late stage in an album, when
it's been such a close thing. But he  really became one of the family.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The title track of The Sensual World was inspired by a character in Ulysses,
by  James Joyce. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, originally the words were taken from Molly Bloom's speech. I
tried to get  permission, but it was refused. Obviously there wasn't anything I
could do about it  except either forget the song or rewrite it. So, as such a
lot of effort had gone into  the musical side of it, and we were quite pleased
with it, I really just re-approached  the words, keeping the same rhythm and
texture. But it turned itself into a story  about Molly Bloom's stepping out of
the book into the sensual world...In some ways,  the lack of co-operation made
us work harder to turn the song into something else.  So that's quite nice.&quot;

</P>
<P>What's the song The Fog all about? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's very much using a parallel of a father teaching a child to swim,
with a  relationship. Well, when I was taught to swim my father would take me
out into the  water. Then he'd say 'Swim!' to me, and you would have to sort of
let go of his  hands. And he'd keep stepping away, so it was always like you
kept going. And the  whole process of letting go: I think we have to do that
throughout life. Really, the  older I get, the more I feel that this is what so
much of life is about. It's just letting  go of all these things that you get
caught up in. The idea in the song is that things  that you're frightened
of--quite often it's the thought of them that's more  important than the
reality. It's the idea of water seeming so deep that you're going  to drown if
you put your feet down, but actually when you do put your feet down  the bottom
is quite close and you can stand up--it's probably up to your waist--and 
everything is all right.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why did you pick Mick Karn &lt;former bass player with the defunct group
Japan,  more recently a solo artist&gt; to do a guest spot on Heads We're
Dancing ? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I met Mick at a charity gig in London &lt;The Prince's Trust Gala
concert of 1981,  during which Kate performed The Wedding List, with Karn on
bass&gt;. And I've  always liked his style of playing. It's very distinctive. He
has such a strong  personality, and I know his work is very respected by the
musicians, which is always  a good sign. But I thought that for some reason this
track was just right for him, so  he came along with a part that he'd worked
out. I'd sent him a cassette. It was  fabulous: he understood the whole
storyline. I hadn't sent any lyrics or anything, and  he just kind of played
this part, and it was so right for the song, and I was so  knocked out. He was a
nice person as well as a great musician. I find more and  more with musicians
there are certain tracks that call out for certain people. It's a  bit like
casting actors for a film. So this is how we approach things now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What was it like working with the Trio Bulgarka? 
</P>
<P>&quot;About three years ago my brother Paddy played me a tape of the Trio.
He's  always been very interested in ethnic music, and has collected instruments
from  around the world. And when he played me this tape I was devastated. I'd
never  heard anything like it. It was like hearing angels singing. I listened to
this tape for  months, and I started thinking, God, wouldn't it be nice working
with them. I was  so scared about the idea of listening to this great music,
that it took me a long time  to work up the courage to actually approach them.
But once I did, it was the most  wonderful experience working with them, as
people as well as musicians. We  managed to make contact with them through a
friend of ours, Joe Boyd, who got us  in touch with people out there. I actually
went to Bulgaria and met them there, and  we spent three days rehearsing. They
didn't speak any English, we didn't speak any  Bulgarian--we had a great time!
Although we had translators, a lot of  communication was done on an emotional
level. It was very interesting. They just  come up and cuddle you, and you sing
to each other. It's an absolutely wonderful  experience. They're like my sisters
now: I now have three sisters.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And Deeper Understanding ? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose it's looking at society, where more and more people are shut
away in  their homes with televisions and computers--in a way, being encouraged
not to  come out. There are so many people who live in London in high-rise
flats, they  don't know their neighbours. They don't know anyone in the
building. People are  getting isolated. It was the idea that this person had
less and less human contact, and  more and more contact with a computer. They
were working with it all day and all  night, and they saw an 'alpha' in a
magazine for a programme for people who are  lonely and lost. So they right off
for it, and put it into the computer. The idea of it's  a bit like an old sci-fi
film, really, where it would just come to life, and suddenly  there's this kind
of incredible being there like a great spiritual visitation. This  computer is
offering the person love. The idea that they have such little human  warmth, and
are getting this tremendous affection and deep love from their  computer. But
it's kind of so intense it's too much for them to take. They actually  have to
be rescued from it. It's about being killed by love, I suppose.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And This Woman's Work ? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Really the subject matter in the film &lt;John Hughes's She's Having a
Baby, for  the climactic scene of which Kate wrote this song&gt; lay down the
grounds for what  the song was about. It's about a man waiting and waiting while
his wife is having a  baby, and there are complications. It is the exploration
of someone being left on their  own, in a big way, suddenly. In the film this
guy has to grow up. He's suddenly  confronted with these terrible things: he
could be a much better human being. It's  moments like that that make you feel
things. You should try to make the most of life  that you can, and not when it's
too late.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Does having complete control over your career become overwhelming 
sometimes? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it does, but I think in a way what I'm moving towards--and I
don't know if  it will work or not, but I feel it's leading me there--is the
combination of music and  film. I hope that someday--in a few years--I could
experiment with making a film.  Maybe not a full-length feature, but I would
like to work with visuals and music at  the same time, because at the moment I'm
restricted to visuals--in the context of  the videos--to music that already
exists, and I'd really like to play with this a lot  more.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Curious about your family's contribution to The Sensual World. Could you
tell us  about their role? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose what's really great is that I'm surrounded by very talented
people  who are related to me, and they're really close friends. Obviously
John's  photographs are really good, and that's why I work with him. He's a
great  photographer, and because we know each other so well, it's such a relaxed
 atmosphere.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why have you not toured in so long? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The problem is that since the last tour I've been wrapped up in making
albums,  and trying to keep control of what I do. I get so involved in what I
do, it's an  exhausting, long process for me, and really with the albums taking
so long over the  last few years, I don't think I've had space in myself to
tour. I really enjoyed the  last tour--people think I didn't and that's why I
haven't toured--but it't really  more that I get so wrapped up in all the
projects I do. I don't feel I've wanted to do  it enough...I don't think I would
have done it well and maybe that's what I can say.  I'm sorry...I don't want to
starve people with contact. It's just doing what I do well  is so important to
me. I've got to try and do the best I can with everything.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you think not touring has held your career back in the U.S.? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think it's very possible, plus I think there have been so many
other  inaccessible areas to me here as an artist. I guess my last record
company found it  difficult to express me as an artist to the public, and my
second and third albums  were received here at a later date &lt;1983-1984&gt;. I
think people must have quite a  confusing image of me. In a way this is
something I have to not worry about too  much, um...because that's not really my
responsibility. My responsibilities are the  artistic, where I have to make the
best record I can at the time, and I have to let  people know it's out there.
But all those areas kind of are out of my control.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Could you say a few words about the first tour? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Terribly overly ambitious--that's a trait of mine. I am terribly
over-ambitious  with things I try to do. It's quite scary trying to deal with
such big things. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it would be unfair on everyone if I did a tour and didn't
really want  to...I'm not really going to exude joy and happiness. It's
difficult for me, obviously. I  hate the thought of a lot of people wanting me
to tour and I not. It's frustrating for  them not to have contact with me as an
artist, but there are records and videos. This  &lt;radio interview&gt; is
great, because this is direct contact. They can hear I'm being  asked questions
and me replying. It's great, but in a way doing interviews for the  press is all
such a removed process. But all I can say is that I think it would be  wrong for
me to tour if I wasn't 100% happy about doing it and thought I could do 
something special. I just think everyone would be unhappy.&quot;
