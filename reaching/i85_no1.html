Subject: No.1 (short mention) 
</P>
<P>There is also a little tiny bit on Kate Bush in the Aug 31 1985 issue of &quot;No.
1&quot;.  Basically they just printed a full page picture of her on the inside
front cover and  included the lyrics to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; on the
table of contents page. This  magazine seems very strange in that their average
reader (from the letters and pen  pal section) seems to be about 13 years old,
and likes Madonna and Duran Duran.  Yet, the editorial staff seems to go truly
enjoy insulting the likes of Madonna and  seems to really like Kate Bush. In the
letters section, there is a little picture of Kate  Bush dressed in her
Babooshka outfit with the caption &quot;Madonna? Kim Wilde? Huh!  Who needs 'em.
Kate Bush is back with a vengeance.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Any one understand this strange phenomenon?
