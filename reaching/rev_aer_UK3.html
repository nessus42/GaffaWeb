<P ALIGN="left"><b><span class="standfirst">In an exclusive first hearing of 
Aerial, Kate Bush's first album in 13 years, Pete Paphides finds highs and lows</span></b></P>
<p>Hit the ground running and there’s only one way you can go. Slower and 
slower, until eventually, you stop. In recent years, many of us wondered whether 
Kate Bush, now 47, had stopped. After five albums in the first seven years of 
her recording life, the ensuing 20 years have yielded just two. That’ll be three 
when Aerial appears next month, concluding a 13-year wait for new material. What 
could she possibly have been doing in that time? In the fiercely protected world 
of Kate Bush, the rumour mill yields little, but we’re told that the onset of 
motherhood in 1999 had its inevitable effect on the creative process. Having 
spent the previous two decades answering to nothing but her own artistic whims, 
Bush, then 41, finally succumbed to a greater imperative. </p>
<p>Three songs into Aerial she tells us as much. Named after her son, Bertie is 
a mother’s mad love alchemised into song. “Sweet kisses/ Three wishes,” she 
sings, “Lovely, love-ly Bertie.” Over and over again, repetition reduces the two 
words into tongues of adoration. And what instrumentation do you choose when 
trying to do justice to the greatest love of all? Why, Renaissance-era strings 
of course. <br>
</p>
<p>Over a typically concept-heavy double album, there are few moments with the 
immediacy of that three-minute eulogy. Arguably, the new single King of the 
Mountain is one. But elsewhere, the days when Bush pulled songs fully-formed out 
of the ether are long gone. She may never have a thunderbolt of inspiration 
quite like the one that brought her Wuthering Heights in one evening. And 
perhaps you need to be 13 (as she was) to conjure out of thin air something as 
otherworldly as The Man with the Child in his Eyes. However, hard work isn’t to 
be underestimated. Bush’s obsessive attention to detail did, after all, give us 
her two most satisfying beginning-to-end listens, the ripe, autumnal poetry of 
The Sensual World and Hounds of Love — an album almost totally preoccupied with 
surrendering to love and understanding death. </p>
<p>She’s not one to shirk the big themes, and there’s a similar sense of trying 
to grasp at intangibles on Aerial. Indeed, on the first CD, A Sea of Honey, the 
approach yields a brace of songs that are among her best. Mrs Bartolozzi is like 
a postcard sent from the most delirious depths of mourning. Laundry duties give 
way to a walk into the waves, and with it the low wheeze of a single cello — the 
song’s two halves joined by Bush repeating a phrase. Not just any phrase, but 
the phrase “washing machine” . Twice. </p>
<p>The same themes of loss seem to recur on A Coral Room. Here, her woozy 
depiction of “the spider of time . . . climbing over the ruins” of a city comes 
into stark, startling focus when the singer’s dead mother is invoked through a 
single item, a favourite brown jug (Bush’s mother passed away in 1993). “It held 
her milk,” she sings, “And now it holds our memories.” </p>
<p>When she presents her music like this — so far beyond the perimeters of 
anything happening in pop today — Kate Bush seems at her most comfortable. When 
she doesn’t, the results are harder to love. A case in point is Pi — which takes 
as its subject matter a “sweet and gentle and sensitive man” in thrall to the 
transcendental number of the title. “Oh he love, he love, he love/ He does love 
his numbers,” runs the chorus over a brisk percussive gallop. Hats off to her 
for being the first auburn-haired pop spookstress to address the ratio of the 
circumference of a circle to its diameter. </p>
<p>But, as with the work of her chum Peter Gabriel, the song seems burdened by 
its own conceptual weight and its author’s quest for sonic perfection. It’s an 
identical story with Joanni (seemingly about Joan of Arc) and How to be 
Invisible — the two most musically uninteresting songs on Aerial. </p>
<p>In the past this never used to be a problem because you sensed that Kate Bush 
knew a vaguely contemporary production when she heard one. However, scoot to the 
penultimate track on the second CD, A Sky of Honey, and it’s not certain that 
this is the case any more. Recalling Mike Oldfield’s recent attempts to rebrand 
himself as the clanging harbinger of “chill out”, Nocturn, a New-Agey hymn to 
the imminent dawn, is as unpleasant as it is unexpected. It seems inevitable 
that within nine months every backpacker in Goa will have adopted it as their 
own. They’re welcome to it. </p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing else on either CD comes close to plumbing such depths. 
With nine tracks that variously revolve around birdsong, the change from day 
into night (and back again) and a painter attempting to capture the scene before 
him, A Sky of Honey coheres more readily than its “commercial” counterpart. An 
Architect’s Dream and The Painter’s Link have Rolf Harris (who, lest we forget, 
also contributed didgeridoo on The Dreaming) and Bush duetting over a spare 
string and piano arrangement. As his painting falls victim to a sudden downpour, 
he wearily exclaims, “what has become of my painting?” But she’s enraptured: 
“See the colours run . . . See what they have become/ A beautiful sunset.” And 
so to the pagan abandon of Sunset, which has Bush offering herself to the dying 
light of the day over a deluge of flamenco guitars. </p>
<p>As day makes way for night and restraint into catharsis, Somewhere in Between 
has Bush once again chasing intangibles and emerging with the album’s 
unquestionable highlight: a life-affirming chorus of hushed harmonies and 
whispering rhythms with more than a hint of the sexual languor that gave The 
Sensual World of 1989 its knee-weakening frisson. </p>
<p>To these ears, A Sky of Honey makes more sense if you skip the next track — 
the dreaded Nocturn — and head straight for the album’s tumultuous closer. The 
final, eponymous, song on Aerial is also its most ambitious. A redemptive paean 
to the new day in which its creator joins the birds in their endless song — but 
not before a mid-song breakdown of hysterical laughter and trilling has ushered 
in a barrage of free-styling rock guitar. </p>
<p>If this is the point at which her lifelong artistic deceleration finally 
grinds to a halt, it won’t be a bad way to remember her. Up on the roof, 
throwing herself open to the elements, while, down below, we wonder just what 
it’s like to see the world as Kate Bush does. </p>
<p><b>Five great Bush moments </b></p>
<p>Babooshka <br>
Executed, as always, with an assurance beyond her years, this 1980 single tells 
of a woman who tests her husband’s fidelity by sending perfumed letters signed 
Babooshka — which also happens to be the Russian word for grandmother. <br>
</p>
<p>Another Day/Don’t Give Up <br>
Two very different duets with Peter Gabriel. The first, performed by the pair on 
Bush’s BBC Christmas Special, had the pair stonily intoning their lines as bored 
husband and wife over the breakfast table. The video for the second song — from 
Gabriel’s So album — had them locked in tight embrace. </p>
<p>The Sensual World <br>
Drawing together Middle Eastern, Celtic and East European influences, the 
Joyce-inspired title track of Bush’s sixth album was rewritten after she was 
refused permission to use Molly Bloom’s soliloquy at the end of Ulysses. </p>
<p>Wuthering Heights <br>
Talking to Michael Aspel in 1993, Bush confessed that she hadn’t read Wuthering 
Heights when she got the idea for song: “It was a television series they had 
years ago and I just managed to catch the very last few minutes . . . I didn’t 
know what was going on, and someone explained the story . . . I read the book to 
get the research right and, wrote the song.” The single was released only after 
a tearful Bush, then 19, confronted her label boss after he insisted it would 
“hit a wall”. She stood her ground, A year later, her boss bought her a £7,000 
Steinway by way of apology. </p>
<p>Cloudbusting <br>
One of her best songs and most memorable videos was inspired by the 
psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, whose son Peter claimed that his father had devised 
a rain-making machine. In the video Bush played Peter while Donald Sutherland 
was Wilhelm. “I didn’t know who she was, so (initially) I refused,” recalled 
Sutherland, “Next thing I knew there was this knock at the door and it’s her. 
She was so funny.”</p>

<p><b><a name="eveningstandard02">Kate's back but is she hip?</a><br>
</b>Evening Standard<br>
By David Smyth<br>
October 14, 2005</p>
<p>When a wild-eyed Kate Bush first sang &quot;Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cath-ee! I've 
come home&quot; on Top of the Pops in 1978, I was less concerned with her huge impact 
on the music world than with my own personal quest to fit five of my toes into 
my mouth at once, aged six months. </p>
<p>There must be many like me who have become her fans backwards, moving in 
reverse from a love of singers such as Björk and PJ Harvey to the source 
material. </p>
<p>Still more will have been introduced to her by the Futureheads' cover of her 
1986 classic Hounds of Love, which scored a bigger hit this year than the real 
thing did. </p>
<p>Now Bush is about to make her big comeback after a 12-year silence. 
Fortysomething pop pundits have already written reams of panting copy about 
their eagerness for the Eighties icon's return. But my generation wait in eager 
anticipation, too. No one should underestimate just how relevant the 47-year-old 
mother of one remains to today's music scene. </p>
<p>As a songwriter, performer and even producer, her complete control over her 
sound led to the creation of some of the most musically daring hits ever to 
grace the charts - Wuthering Heights, Man with the Child in His Eyes, Babooshka, 
Running up That Hill, Hounds of Love - songs that still sound forward-thinking 
more than two decades later. </p>
<p>As one of pop's true originals, she has been a continuing source of 
inspiration to younger musicians. Theatrical rock band Muse and experimental 
hip-hop duo Outkast are big admirers, although Björk is probably the most 
obvious follower of her alien musical style. </p>
<p>She has said: &quot;To me, Kate Bush will always represent the age of exploring 
your sexuality, when you change from a girl to a woman. She created her own look 
and produced her own sound. There's a timelessness to Kate's music.&quot; </p>
<p>There's also a shroud of secrecy surrounding her new album, a two-disc effort 
titled Aerial, which won't be released until 7 November. The mystery only adds 
to the anticipation. </p>
<p>Before I could become one of the first journalists to listen to the new songs 
- once only, at EMI's Brook Green offices - I had to sign a form agreeing not to 
write anything that &quot;in any way constitutes a review&quot;. It was played on a huge 
CD player bolted to the floor, guarded by a bored, possibly armed employee, in 
case I tried anything funny. </p>
<p>One contemporary comparison became immediately obvious: this release is even 
more important to the record label than Coldplay's X&amp;Y. That was posted out 
early to reviewers under the pseudonym The Fir Trees so that if it fell into the 
hands of thieves or bootleggers, they wouldn't know what they had. Aerial is 
forbidden even to leave the building. </p>
<p>Inside the sealed environment, I was only allowed to listen to half of the 
album, the half on disc one, without even a sniff of Aerial's second disc, which 
I know to be a &quot;concept&quot; piece in nine linked tracks, collectively called A Sky 
of Honey. Together, apparently, they form a kind of musical day in the life, 
filled with bird song and with a cameo from Rolf Harris on didgeridoo. It sounds 
strangely promising. </p>
<p>I can report with more confidence that disc one's seven distinct songs 
constitute a fascinating listen, demonstrating all that Bush does best and 
showing a notable change in her outlook. The slightly unhinged wailer is nowhere 
to be heard here. Since her last album, The Red Shoes in 1993, she has become 
mother to Bertie, now seven, and there is a peaceful contentment evident 
throughout the new songs. </p>
<p>He drew the cover art for her forthcoming single, King of the Mountain (out 
in 10 days, before the album), and is the subject of one of the new tracks, 
Bertie, a ballad played on mediaeval instruments featuring the lines: &quot;Here 
comes the sunshine/Here comes that boy of mine&quot;. </p>
<p>Along with A Coral Room, Mrs Bartolozzi is one of two songs played solo on 
piano; it revels in domestic bliss, being principally about a washing machine. 
On •, Bush continues to find beauty in the mundane, softly reciting the infinite 
number over a waltzing rhythm and echoing synths. </p>
<p>As ever, plenty of nature imagery is conjured, especially on the spooky spell 
described on How to Be Invisible. For lyrical complexity she remains worlds 
ahead of the likes of Franz Ferdinand, probably our most articulate contemporary 
band. </p>
<p>But while she continues to employ layered electronics to great effect, 
nothing here sounds overly dramatic or elaborate. Even Joanni, about Joan of Arc 
going into battle, remains stately and restrained. </p>
<p>A reserved Kate Bush is still more adventurous than a boatload of hip new 
guitar bands.<br>

The Observer<br>
by Jason Cowley<br>
October 16, 2005</P>
<P ALIGN="left">(Five stars out of five)</P>
<P ALIGN="left"><b>She's still deep, if occasionally unfathomable. Jason Cowley 
delights in an alchemist's return <br>
<br>
</b>Why do so many pop performers produce their best work when they are in their 
early-to-mid twenties? A simple answer is that pop is essentially a juvenile 
form, the expression of a certain youthful worldview and rebellious sensibility, 
and the more the musician matures and learns about music, the greater can be the 
desire to complicate and to experiment with what once felt so natural and 
spontaneous.<br>
Few artists experiment more than Kate Bush - often to thrilling effect. Her 
first single, 'Wuthering Heights', was a huge number one hit in 1978, when she 
was just 19. After that surprise, EMI allowed her near-absolute artistic 
control. Since 1980 she has produced and written all her own material and, as 
the wait for each new album has grown longer and longer, she has become the 
musical equivalent of a celebrated novelist who refuses to be edited: she has 
the freedom to do whatever she wants and at whichever speed she desires. If she 
wants Rolf Harris to play didgeridoo for her as he did on The Dreaming (1982) 
and again on this new album, Aerial, she can have him. If she wants to combine 
the orchestral string arrangements of Michael Kamen with uninhibited rock 
guitar, as she does here, she can. If she refuses to play live, as she has done 
for more than 20 years, no one will try to force her to change her mind.<br>
<br>
Twelve years is a long time to wait for a new record from any artist, even from 
one as consistently inventive as Kate Bush, but at least Aerial offers value. 
It's a 14-track double album, and the more experimental of the two records is 'A 
Sky of Honey'. It begins not with music but with the sound of birdsong, the wind 
in the trees and the voice of a child calling for her parents. What follows is a 
suite of seven unashamedly romantic and interconnected songs taking us on a long 
day's journey into night and then on through to the next morning when birdsong 
is heard once more and the whole cycle starts all over again. There are 
similarities here with the second side of the remarkable Hounds of Love (1985) 
and to the song sequence 'The Ninth Wave' that took us into the consciousness of 
a drowning woman (the sea, in her work, has long been a source of inspiration 
and of threat). That album, memorable for its daring, its imaginative use of 
sampling, and its erotic intensity, was, like much of Bush's work, preoccupied 
with memory - and with how we are never entirely free from the voices and sounds 
of childhood. It remains her best album.<br>
<br>
'A Sky of Honey' is music of pagan rapture - songs about acts of creation, 
natural or otherwise; about the wind, rain, sunlight and the sea. Sometimes it 
is just Kate alone at her piano, her voice restrained. Sometimes, as on the 
outstanding 'Sunset', she begins alone and softly, but soon the tempo quickens 
and the song becomes an experiment in forms: jazz, progressive rock, flamenco.<br>
<br>
There are weaknesses. At times, Bush can be too fey and whimsical, especially on 
'Bertie', which is about the joy of motherhood, or on 'Mrs Bartolozzi', a 
rhapsody to nothing less than a washing machine: 'My blouse wrapping itself 
around your trousers... slooshy sloshy/ slooshy sloshy.' And the bold, musically 
adventurous second album is a little too insistent in its 'hey, man' hippyish 
sensibility, with Kate running freely through the fields or climbing high in the 
mountains. She did, after all, once dress up as a kind of white witch for the 
cover of Never For Ever (1980), on which she is portrayed flying through the 
air, like a giant bat.<br>
<br>
'What kind of language is this?' Kate Bush sings, self-interrogatively, on the 
title track, the last of the album. It's a good question, to which she offers a 
partial answer on 'Somewhere in Between', which in ambition and content is where 
most of the songs on this album are suspended - somewhere in between the 
tighter, more conventional structures of pop and the looser, less accessible 
arrangements of contemporary classical and the avant-garde; somewhere, in mood 
and atmosphere, between the lucidity of wakefulness and the ambiguity of dream; 
between the presumed innocence of childhood and the desire for escape offered by 
the adult imagination; between abstraction and the real. Even when she escapes 
her wonderland to write songs about actual figures in the known world, she 
remains attracted to those figures such as Elvis ('King of the Mountain', the 
album's first single) or Joan of Arc ('Joanna') that, in death as indeed in 
life, have a mythic unreality.<br>
<br>
So, again, what kind of language is this? It is ultimately that of an artist 
superbly articulate in the language of experimental pop music. But it is also 
the language of an artist who doesn't seem to want to grow up. Or, more 
accurately, who has never lost her child-like capacity for wonder and for pagan 
celebration and who, because she is sincere and can communicate her odd and 
unpredictable vision in both words and through sumptuous music, occupies a 
cherished and indulged position in the culture. There is no one quite like her, 
which is why, in the end, we must forgive her excesses and eccentricities. We 
are lucky to have her back.<br>

Classic Rock<br>
by&nbsp; Hugh Fielder</P>
<P ALIGN="left">A lengthy 12 years on from her last album, fans of Kate will be 
pleased to discover that her new record sounds reassuringly familiar.<br>
<br>
Twelve years between albums is not the longest gap in recording history, but for 
an icon such as Kate Bush it certainly makes you pause for thought. There has 
even been a novel called <i>Waiting For Kate Bush</i> in which a bunch of 
dysfunctional characters obsess over the minutiae of her lyrics and lengthy 
album credits.<br>
<br>
The Kate Bush who released <i>The Red Shoes</i> in 1993 was in her mid-30s. She 
is now in her late 40s. What's disturbing, though, is that for most of her 
audience Kate has been frozen in time from 1979 when she stopped touring and 
withdrew into her own world. So the image of Kate in a singlet, with wild hair 
to match her kooky character, and high warbling voice remains vivid mainly 
because there has been nothing to replace it.<br>
<br>
What's even more disturbing is that there is little on Aerial to alter that 
image. The opening, reassuringly familiar-sounding <i>King Of The Mountain</i> 
is all about whistling winds, rising storms, and <i>'the snow with Rosebud'</i>. 
By track four she's up to her waist in water with 'little fishes swimming 
between my legs'. Only at the end of the record, when she gets into a fit of the 
giggles, do you suddenly realize you are listening to the sound of middle-aged 
laughter.<br>
<br>
There have been other changes, of course. Most notably, Kate has become a mum; 
and she definitely become the woman with the child in her eyes on <i>Bertie - 
'More joy and such joy that you bring me,'</i> she trills above the medieval 
backing.<br>
<br>
Such domesticity has also inspired Mrs. Bartolozzi where, before her encounter 
with the aforementioned fishes, she is fascinated by a washing machine, watching 
as the clothes swirl around, her skirt entwined with his trousers. But when his 
shirt ends up on the washing line, <i>'clean and upside down'</i>, you start to 
wonder whether he's coming back.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere she gets intrigued by numerology and circles on &pi; (Pi) the chorus 
recites Pi's never-ending value. But you're never far from finding <i>'clothes on 
the beach and footprints leading to the sea'</i>.<br>
<br>
The two CDs (lasting around 90 minutes) are themed 'The sea of honey' and 'The 
sky of honey', but after only one (supervised) listen it's hard to grasp the 
threads. But her patient fans will be delighted that there is honey still for 
tea.<br>

<P ALIGN="left"><a name="theindepentent03">Kate Bush: Finally, something for the 
grown-ups </a><br>
The Independent<br>
(writer not credited)<br>
October 21, 2005 </P>
<p>Early next month, Kate Bush releases Aerial, her first new album since The 
Red Shoes back in November 1993. Even by the relaxed schedules adopted by pop's 
more established artists, this is an extraordinary career hiatus - not quite the 
20 years separating Steely Dan's Gaucho and Two Against Nature, perhaps, but 
well on the way there. </p>
<p>Entire pop scenes and musical movements have budded, bloomed and withered in 
the interim - Oasis's first singles, for instance, appeared in 1994 - but such 
is the diminutive Kate's enduring artistic stature that the forthcoming 
double-album has prompted a feverish flurry of record-company attention on its 
behalf. Some would consider their concern paranoiac - only last week, I was 
accosted like a shoplifter in the street by an EMI security guard, for the 
terrible crime of believing that the lyric-sheet I had been given at a playback 
of the album was mine to keep. Apparently, none shall know of Her words until 
the two discs are actually brought down from the mountaintop to the record shop. 
But we'll let that pass. </p>
<p>The more pertinent concern is whether her music remains relevant in a music 
landscape that has seen Britpop come and go, grunge atrophy into skate-metal, 
hip-hop conquer the known world, and talent-contest TV reduce chart pop to a 
production-line of vacuity. Changes flash by ever more rapidly in the modern, 
computer-assisted music world, and in decoupling from its dizzy progress for a 
dozen years, Kate Bush runs a serious risk of getting flattened like a hedgehog 
crossing a motorway upon her return. </p>
<p>Extraordinarily, she manages to traverse both carriageways with only 
superficial damage to a few spines: indeed, such is the idiosyncratic nature of 
her work that she could probably disappear for a half-century and still sustain 
her own unique position in the pop firmament. But then, who else would write 
about an obsessive-compulsive housewife or attempt a vocal duet with trilling 
birds, or, in the most courageous of the album's many unusual strategies, sing 
huge strings of numbers, a gambit that brings new meaning to the old critic's 
chestnut about being happy to listen to someone singing the telephone directory?
</p>
<p>The only track so far available from the album, the single &quot;King Of The 
Mountain&quot;, employs references to Elvis and Citizen Kane to illustrate her 
musings upon fame and wealth and isolation. &quot;Why,&quot; she wonders, &quot;does a 
multi-millionaire fill up his home with priceless junk?&quot; The rest of the album - 
particularly the extended song-cycle that occupies the entire second disc - 
seems like her own suggestion as to how to use that lofty position more 
profitably, in a spiritual and aesthetic manner. A reggae lilt underscored with 
misty synthesiser textures, &quot; King Of The Mountain&quot; has the gently insistent 
quality that proved so effective on several of her previous singles. </p>
<p>The picture adorning the single's sleeve is by Bush's young son, &quot; lovely, 
lovely Bertie&quot;, whose presence toddles joyously through much of the new album, 
clearly illuminating her world. Many years ago, back near the start of her 
career, she regarded the domestic demands of motherhood as a dubious prospect, 
claiming her work was her love, and how could she do that and bring up a child 
at the same time? The answer, presumably, was not to work for a dozen years. </p>
<p>Ironically, childhood - and particularly the struggle not to relinquish it - 
has always been one of the driving concerns of Bush's work, an itch discernible 
in tracks as obvious as &quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot; (from 1978's Lionheart) and as 
oblique as &quot;The Fog&quot; (from 1989's The Sensual World), where her father at one 
point advises her to &quot; Just put your feet down, child/'Cos you're all grown up 
now&quot;. When asked about this aspect of her work, she has always freely admitted 
being like a little girl in many ways, and furthermore, happily presumes she'll 
still be that way in her dotage. It's certainly still a factor on Aerial , both 
in the track &quot;Bertie&quot; itself and in the memories and reminiscences that cobweb 
some other songs. But compared to the darker corners of the mind sometimes mined 
in earlier songs, the new album seems a much sunnier affair: an enduring image I 
took away from it - not necessarily a lyric, though it might have been - was of 
windows flung wide open, their curtains billowing out in the breeze, a room's 
long-dormant dust stirred into life again. </p>
<p>Another significant concern in Bush's work has been sexuality, both in 
codified, metaphorical form, and more explicitly in tracks like &quot;Feel It &quot;, &quot;In 
The Warm Room&quot; and most obviously &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, where she emulates Molly 
Bloom's soliloquy from Ulysses (she had wanted to simply quote from Joyce's 
novel, but the publisher's demurral forced her to devise her own equivalent 
reverie). She's unafraid, too, of tackling more problematic areas of sexuality, 
as for instance when she dealt with cradle-snatching in &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot; and 
incest in &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. But not all that seems erotic in her music is about 
sex, as an EMI employee discovered when he found her working on the hypnotic 
&quot;out-in-out-in&quot; chant section of &quot;Breathing&quot; (from 1980's Never For Ever), and 
expressed outrage at EMI's young pop princess making such an overtly sexual 
record. The song is, of course, about breathing. Duhhh! </p>
<p>This is perhaps the main area where Bush is less relevant than she once was, 
for all her obvious influence on such soul-baring doyennes of sexual openness as 
Tori Amos, Sinead O'Connor and Björk. Since she was last involved, the bar on 
female sexual expression has been booted so much higher - or dragged lower, 
depending on your viewpoint - by the brazenly pornographic contributions of 
hip-hop and R&amp;B divas, whose revelations would make Hugh Hefner blush. But in 
doing so, they have also scoured away the elements that brought the most 
interesting frissons to Bush's take on sexuality - the entire spiritual aspect, 
most notably, but also the notion of sexuality as something to be attained, 
something to build up to, a most satisfying mountain to scale. <br>
Not, of course, that Kate Bush has ever really been writing for the same market 
as Lil' Kim or Mousse-T or whoever it was who went on so charmingly about 
licking her booty and her crack. Bush has always been a nice middle-class girl 
writing for other nice middle-class girls (and boys) who wouldn't necessarily be 
put off by references to writers such as James Joyce and the Brontë sisters, or 
oddball mystics and weirdos like GI Gurdjieff and Wilhelm Reich, and who 
wouldn't balk at hearing non-pop musicians such as Eberhard Weber, the Trio 
Bulgarka and, er, Rolf Harris. </p>
<p>It's not an exclusively middle-class constituency, but it is one that exults 
in exercising the mind rather than just the body, that finds greater liberation 
in the imagination than in raucous, boozy indulgence. One that reads, in other 
words. And although it sometimes seems as if it's been completely obliterated by 
the waves of corporate dumbed-down drivel that routinely crams the airwaves, 
it's a massive audience lain long dormant, forced to subsist on the drab pablum 
of Keane and David Gray until something more substantial comes along. </p>
<p>At around an hour and a half, Aerial is unquestionably a substantial piece of 
work, and its manifold peculiarities and quirks offer much more interesting fare 
than that available from today's AOR mainstream. It's also a more mature 
undertaking than any of her previous albums, an extended meditation on art and 
light, fame and family, creativity and the natural world. Indeed it seems, come 
to think of it, like an expansion of the theme of Laura Veirs' gorgeous 
&quot;Rapture&quot;. And since that was the finest song of last year, I'd have to say that 
leaves Kate Bush still operating at the cutting-edge of intelligent adult pop, 
every bit as relevant now as at any point in her career. Just a little bit 
weirder, thank heavens. </p>

<p>IS KATE BUSH STILL RELEVANT? </p>
<p>Mutya from Sugababes </p>
<p>I think she is still relevant. It's nice to see people reinvent themselves. 
She was a great performer and a great singer. I like that song, you know the 
one, &quot;It's me, I'm Cathy...&quot; I love that song. I remember listening to it 
growing up. I think our older fans like her music. </p>
<p>KT Tunstall </p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to Kate Bush's return - I'm no expert on her work 
but I know some of it and I think she's an incredibly original and talented 
artist. Anyone who writes most of an album like her first album, The Kick 
Inside, at 15 years old has got to be pretty special. </p>
<p>Katie Melua </p>
<p>Of course she's still relevant. I wasn't actually in the country when her 
music first came out, so I only discovered it three or four years ago. What's 
amazing is that something like &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; still sounds so different. I 
actually saw her about nine months ago, we were just passing at an industry 
event and I went up to her and said I was a big fan and asked her about the new 
record. She was really excited about it but quite nervous because she felt that 
everyone was hyping it up a bit and she just wanted to bring out an album. You 
know, she's a musician. </p>
<p>Hussein Chalayan, fashion designer </p>
<p>For me, it's not important how well the songs will be received because I 
think she's already an amazing influence in what she's done. I listen to her 
stuff a lot while I sketch and I think there is a weird sense of emotional 
encouragement in her work. There's something therapeutic in her voice and in her 
attitude, so that sometimes just listening to it can encourage youor give you 
some kind of energy. </p>
<p>Björk </p>
<p>To me, Kate Bush will always represent the age of exploring your sexuality, 
when you change from a girl to a woman. I guess that's what I found fascinating 
about Kate, she totally stuck out. She created her own look and sound. There's a 
timelessness to her music. </p>
<p>Alan Bentley, director of the Brontë Museum </p>
<p>One of the main things that brings people to the Brontë Museum from all over 
the world is Kate Bush. We have copies of her No 1 hit single &quot; Wuthering 
Heights&quot; in our collection of Brontë-related items. People often arrive at the 
Brontë novels through that song. </p>

SINGLE of the WEEK - King Of The Mountain - 5 RATING<br>
<br>
Imagine the scene - early 1978 and punk is at the height of its raging, anarchic 
glory.<br>
Then Kate Bush is introduced to the world with the line: &quot;out on the wiley, 
windy moors.&quot;<br>
Her ethereal, warbling falsetto recalled Emily Bronte's gothic novel Wuthering 
Height. With its grand sweeps of piano, lush strings and lyrical guitar, it 
climbed to No1.<br>
Punk it wasn't.<br>
Kate, still in her teens, had revealed her spectacular talent.<br>
On the credits for her debut album, The Kick Inside, she implored &quot;all of you 
with open ears - please feel it.&quot;<br>
Millions of us did. She went on to make seven beautifully crafted albums, ending 
in 1993's The Red Shoes. Arguably, she became Britain's greatest female 
songwriter.<br>
Like an alchemist, she turned words and music into gold. Her videos were 
fleeting works of art.<br>
Then nothing for 12 years.<br>
Late in 2005, we stand on the brink of a new album - Aerial, out on November 
7th.<br>
It is the year's most intriguing release. To anyone over 30 it provides a chance 
to re-acquaint ourselves with Kate. To younger people, a new journey of 
discovery beckons.<br>
&quot;Could you see the aisles of women?&quot; is the line that reintroduces Kate Bush to 
the world.<br>
It opens her new single King Of The Mountain (out Monday) - a magnum opus of 
almost five minutes filled with sophisticated beats, swirling synths and 
typically oblique lyrics.<br>
Happily, Kate's voice doesn't sound the least bit rusty.<br>
Theorists can have a field day with the lyrics as Kate considers the desperate 
isolation of huge wealth and fame.<br>
The King Of The Mountain appears to be William Randolph Hearst, the inspiration 
behind the film Citizen Kane.<br>
Rosebud may refer to his mistress. Is the mountain a reference to the hill where 
Hearst built his Californian mansion? The haunting words also speak of Elvis 
&quot;out there somewhere like a happy man.&quot;<br>
It's a ravishing comeback.</p>
<p>To celebrate and get in the mood for the album, SOTW reviews Kate's amazing 
back catalogue.<br>
<br>
THE KICK INSIDE - 5 RATING<br>
Championed by Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour, Kate's debut album belied her tender 
years. Vivid, intricate soundscapes framed her offbeat, romantic lyrics. The 
woes of Cathy and Heathcliff overshadowed other songs that gave notice of this 
new talent. The track Strange Phenomena could describe its author.<br>
KEY SONGS: Wuthering Heights, The Man With The Child In His Eyes, Moving, Them 
Heavy People.<br>
<br>
LIONHEART - 3 RATING<br>
Appearing just months after The Kick Inside, it proved to be a difficult second 
album. Lionheart was bursting with ideas that were not quite fully formed. But 
songs such as Wow, with its glistening melody and singalong chorus, rank with 
her best work. The US market was proving hard to crack, perhaps because of the 
paean to these shores Oh England My Lionheart.<br>
KEY SONGS: Wow, Oh England My Lionheart, Hammer Horror.<br>
<br>
NEVER FOR EVER - 4 RATING<br>
Kate got into her stride with this album, which spawned three hit singles and 
topped the album chart. The eastern overtones of Babooshka just managed to avoid 
silliness and became her biggest single since Wuthering heights. Breathing 
pondered the Cold War nuclear threat with new maturity and depth. The lovely 
Delius (Song Of Summer) emphasized this further.<br>
KEY SONGS: Babooshka, Army Dreamers, Breathing.<br>
<br>
THE DREAMING - 4 RATING<br>
A remarkable achievement. Not only did Kate take over full production duties for 
the first time, to stunning effect, but her vocal gymnastics also rose to a new 
level. It had fewer hit singles but stands the test of time by still sounding 
fresh and innovative. Even Rolf Harris wields his didgeridoo on the title track, 
a lament on the plight of Aborigines.<br>
KEY SONGS: Sat In Your Lap, The Dreaming, Get Out Of My House.<br>
<br>
HOUNDS OF LOVE - 5 RATING<br>
The big one. The masterpiece, if you like. Forget the Futureheads' recent 
reworking of the title track, this is the real deal. With big songs like Big 
Sky, big sound and big production, it finally gave Kate the recognition she 
deserved in the States. Running Up That Hill and Cloudbusting are classics that 
remain with the listener long after the last notes have died away.<br>
KEY SONGS: Running Up That Hill ( A Deal With God ), Hounds Of Love, Big Sky, 
Cloudbusting.<br>
<br>
THE SENSUAL WORLD - 4 RATING<br>
The title says it all. This album is sensual in every sense. Low-key, even 
introspective, it reflects on the mental and physical aspects of love. Check out 
Dave Gilmour's goose-bump inducing guitar cameo on Love And Anger and be seduced 
by the beauty of This Woman's Work. Not as good as Hounds Of Love but not far 
behind.<br>
KEY SONGS: This Woman's Work, Love And Anger, Between A Man And A Woman.<br>
<br>
THE RED SHOES - 3 RATING<br>
Evidence that Kate was slowing down, this album appeared after a four year 
hiatus. Songs like Rubberband Girl had potential but the album failed to dazzle. 
There were fine contributions from Eric Clapton, Procol Harum's organ maestro 
Gary Brooker and Prince, who funks up the excellent Why Should I love You?<br>
KEY SONGS: The Song Of Solomon, Rubberband Girl, Eat The Music, Why Should I 
love You?<br>
<br>

The Times of London<br>
by Stephen Dalton<br>
October 22, 205<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Kate Bush releases her first CD in 12 years, Stephen Dalton discovers from 
other musicians what makes Kate great<br>
Musical movements have waxed and waned, former peers wasted away, but somehow 
Kate Bush has endured. In fact, in the 12 years since her last album release, 
she has become more influential than ever, as memories of the leotard-clad 
teenage warbler from the early 1980s have faded, to be replaced by a genuine 
appreciation of her musical talents.<br>
<br>
With the arrival of Bush’s new album, Aerial, a sprawling double-CD of pagan 
poetry, artists from every genre and generation are lining up to pay homage to 
the faerie queen of British pop. Her perfectionist mastery of arranging and 
producing, her ability to juggle music with motherhood, her lyrical hinterland 
of heightened emotion and ripe sensuality — all have been interpreted as 
defiantly feminine, even feminist statements.<br>
<br>
Significantly, Bush crosses gender taste barriers with an ease that the likes of 
Alanis Morissette and Dido do not. Her music has already enjoyed a mini-comeback 
this year, thanks to the Futureheads, whose spiky cover version of her 1985 
classic Hounds of Love performed better in the charts than her original. 
Meanwhile, Coldplay admitted they were “trying to recreate” Bush’s 1985 hit 
Running Up That Hill for their own recent chart-topper, Speed of Sound.<br>
<br>
Even the most macho performers see her as a rule-breaking maverick. The rapper 
Tricky, notorious for recording with gangsters, considers Bush a genius on a par 
with the Beatles, while the former Sex Pistol John Lydon has called her “f****** 
brilliant” and “a true original”.<br>
<br>
Bush’s eclectic musical agenda has also helped to sustain her fanbase over the 
years. Few artists have worked with such a diverse army of collaborators, from 
Eric Clapton to Nigel Kennedy, from Prince to Peter Gabriel, from Bulgarian 
choirs to Rolf Harris.<br>
<br>
Of course, the question remains whether Bush’s army of acolytes will help to 
make Aerial a hit. After 12 years of silence and secrecy, can Bush sound as 
wondrous and amazing as the mystique surrounding her? Many of her famous fans 
seem to think so ....</p><span class="textcopy">
<p><strong>ALISON GOLDFRAPP </strong><br>
<i>Electro-stomp princess<br>
</i>“When I was growing up Kate Bush was the one. All the boys fancied her at 
school, all the hippies smoked bongs and listened to her music. I got into her a 
little later. I think she’s a genius. I love her because she is nothing to do 
with fashion, she is so self-contained. My favourite album is <i>Hounds of Love</i>, 
it’s the ultimate concept album. I took a lot of drugs listening to that album, 
E mainly. So much so that when I listen to it now I can start to feel sick very 
quickly.” </p>
<p><strong>BJÖRK </strong><br>
<i>Fellow vocal and sartorial adventurer <br>
</i>“There were so many records in my parents’ house, so I saw a lot of album 
covers. I thought they were all macho and occupied with power, things I didn’t 
like. I guess that’s what I found fascinating about Kate, she stuck out. She 
created her own look and produced her own sound.” </p>
<p><strong>ROY HARPER <br>
</strong><i>Grumpy folkie and Bush collaborator<br>
</i>“She was such a precocious talent, she arrived ready-made. With her voice 
going to such incredible heights, she was immediately a standout. We were 
recording at Abbey Road at the time, and as soon as I heard her I knew I had a 
piece I’d love her to sing. We put feelers out and she came back within five 
minutes. Then I found out that her brothers had been into me for all of her 
childhood, so she came super quick. You get the sense when you meet her that she 
is the real thing. She’s a million miles away from Charlotte Church, who is a 
classically trained female singer of no small ability. But Kate has a lot more 
than that in terms of artistic integrity. She is an artist in the deepest 
sense.”</p>
<strong>ALEXANDER BALANESCU</strong><br>
<i>Eponymous founder of string quartet <br>
</i>“I met Kate Bush through Michael Nyman, who was asked to do some string 
arrangements for her. I was very excited about the prospect of working with Kate 
as I knew and loved all her records. Kate is indeed a perfectionist but in an 
unerringly musically intelligent way, and with an infectious, positive 
enthusiasm. I was amazed by her ability to hear tiny details, seeking not only 
technical perfection but also the right spirit for a particular piece. 
<p>“I think Kate Bush’s work transcends musical borders. Of course it’s a kind 
of pop music, but a music with lots of layers, holding the attention for many 
repeated hearings. Also, I have always found her use of her extraordinary voice 
very interesting. She seems to use it as an instrument, always seeking to expand 
its possibilities.” </p>

<p><strong>BARRY HYDE</strong><br>
<i>Singer with the Futureheads <br>
</i>“She is totally underrated as an arranger and singer. Some of her songs are 
perfectly arranged and quite complicated. She makes great pop songs with 
excellent production. And we were all born in the early 1980s, so Kate Bush was 
around all of us to a varying degree.” </p>
<p><strong>KELE OKEREKE</strong><br>
<i>Singer with indie rockers Bloc Party <br>
</i>“I only discovered Kate Bush two years ago. I was staying at a friend’s 
house in Spain while he was away, and all he had in his collecton were Prince 
and Kate Bush records. I listened to all her albums from start to finish and was 
completely transfixed, amazed by their theatrical intensity, their sense of 
story and attention to detail. These artists were able to sculpt their decisions 
without having to run them past people. They were able to do what they wanted.”
</p>
<p><strong>BIG BOI</strong><br>
<i>Half of hip-hop pioneers OutKast<br>
</i>“My uncle introduced me to Kate Bush when I was about 14 years old, and that 
opened my mind up. She was so bugged out, man! But I felt what she was talking 
about in the songs. My uncle would explain what the song stood for. Like <i>The 
Man With the Child in His Eyes</i> and all that shit. I would be like, ‘Wow! 
She’s so f*****’ deep!’ I was infatuated with her, man. Still am, and hopefully 
on the next record you’re gonna hear OutKast and Kate Bush do at least two or 
three songs. I gotta track her down! I just found out she was producing all that 
shit herself, man! She’s so f*****’ dope and so underrated and off the radar.”
</p>
<p><strong>DIDO</strong><br>
<i>Classically named global megastar <br>
</i>“When I was 13, I got a record player for Christmas, so I went out and 
bought <i>Hounds of Love</i> by Kate Bush and <i>Diamond Life</i> by Sade, which 
both remain absolute classics. Those are two women who have the right idea: they 
have a life, they have great careers, and they make records when they want to 
make records.” </p>
<p><strong>TRICKY</strong><br>
<i>Trip-hop pioneer <br>
</i>“I don’t believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible. Her 
music sounds religious to me. She should be treasured more in this country than 
the Beatles. That she isn’t is probably down to her own personality, because she 
can — and does — walk away from everything, and not make albums, and I respect 
her for that. Just to live your life and not play the game — to me, that’s 
success.” <br>
<br>
<strong>DAVE GILMOUR </strong><br>
<i>Pink Floyd guitarist who “found” Bush <br>
</i>“As a teenager, Kate couldn’t be ignored. She was obviously, to me, a great 
talent and it would have been criminal of me to have ignored her. Having said 
that, she would have made it anyway, one way or another. After her success I was 
inundated with tapes of girl singers. But when I listened to them, I never heard 
another Kate.” </p>
