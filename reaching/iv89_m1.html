<P>Date: 27 Oct 89 16:35 +0100 <BR> From: Norvald Stol &lt;stol%vax.elab.unit.uninett@nac.no&gt;
<BR> Subject: MTV-Europe Oct. 1989 
</P>
<P>The following is an attempt of transcribing what KT said on MTV-Europe's  &quot;News
of the Week&quot; (or something like that)-program last week. 
</P>
<P>I am, however, unable to get all the formulations correct. I guess some of
them  are slang words; but in one occasion (the very last word she says here)
it's probably  a proper english word unknown to me. Please note that english is
NOT my native  language, before sending out heavy &quot;flames&quot;! 
</P>
<P>I've used &lt;...&gt; for words which are uncertain/unknown to me. 
</P>
<P>It'starts off with an intro by the program-presenter, Pip Dann : 
</P>
<P>PIP: And then there is Kate Bush and her &lt;cutesy&gt; Sensual World. Her
public  image has run the &lt;gammoc&gt; from &lt;alfen pixie&gt; to &lt;eterial&gt;
floating dancy things to  post-modern meets Kurosawa. But whatever &lt;guise&gt;
she chooses to appear in, the  one constant is that her music is interresting,
innovative, and provides the media  with endless scope for analysis and
speculation. But just what has SHE got to say  about it ? 
</P>
<P>..(Clips from Wuthering Heights and The Sensual World videos. during Kate's 
&quot;statement&quot; the music to TSW is faded in and out, and some glimpses
are also shown  inbetween showing her sitting besides some studio equipment (I
think it is) ). 
</P>
<P>KATE: It's an extrodinary series of things that can act as inspiration, from
 something someone might say in a conversation to something you see in a film or
you  read in a book. I would say that they are my main forms of inspiration.
Particulary  films over the years, because I suppose with visual imaginary -e-
it's such powerful  stuff, it can hang around in your head for a long time and
come back. So when you  come to the next album, chances are to find something
interresting again, something  new. You have to look that much further, you have
to go OVER the hill, rather than  just UP the hill this time (smiling). And also
between albums -e- if you're not  careful, you just make the writing a
continuation of the album before, rather than  starting something new, trying to
say something new on the album, which hopefully  is what it's about. 
</P>
<P>You know, I think most people still think of me as the Wuthering Heights
weird,  lots of arms and hair (laughing). With something like &quot;The Sensual
World&quot;, it's very  much imagiary, it's a &lt;nuration&gt; and it's dealing
with quite abstract things. -e- So it  was quite difficult knowing what to do
with this video. I ended up feeling the best  thing to do was to turn it into a
performance, and I worked with Peter Richardson.  He was a lot of fun to work
with. We wrote it together, and he gave me much more  freedom in front of the
camera, to be a performer working with a partner. And  really I think we wanted
to get across the idea of the sensuality of the world, say,  the weather, the
elemental energies, and keep it a straight performance but moving  through these
different things that the environment &lt;...this last word sounds like  &quot;choses&quot;,

</P>
<P>but I guess it should be &quot;imposes&quot;, or something like that ...&gt;

</P>
<P>--- end of &quot;statement&quot; ---
</P>
<P>When flaming MTV, make sure it's the US MTV you're flaming. MTV-Europe 
shows the TSW-video many times a day, in fact I think it's currently one of the 
MOST SHOWN videos. I suspect that VJ Maiken Wex| is a HUGE KT-fan. She has  also
shown many of Kate's older videos lately. 
</P>
<P>Bye for now.
