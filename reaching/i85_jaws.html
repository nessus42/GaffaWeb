<H3>                                  PUPPY LOVE
</H3>
<P>    SO THERE we stood In the Baker Street Laserium, eye to eye      with
Copernicus in a lacquered gold mask. Above our heads,      the Bush howl yapped
about 'Hounds Of Love' while the dogs      at Fleet Street barked Kate! Kate! 
Serenely happy In the midst      of all this and moving as one with a phalanx of
male      protectors, the Lionhearted lady seemed to be Dreaming. . .</P>
<P>    An offer of a vodka and orange draws all the name drunks, and tonight
your Jaws correspondent got EMl's      money's worth, eyeing up such Romeos as
Radio One producer John Walters, Paul Gambaccini and a prattle of      music
hacks.</P>
<P>    Presently, the bar was closed, and we trouped forlornly into the
Planetarium to be plunged, amid carefree childish      shrieking and squealing,
into darkness. Kate's undeniably strong voice boomed out and suddenly
unbelievably vibrant rays were sketching some hippy's dreams onto several
hundred upturned retinas.</P>
<P>    Side one of the album, heavily into hearts and flowers, gave us laser
Spirographs of writhing red mouths, octagons doing aerobics and <EM>Fantasia</EM>-like
blooms exploding exotically into our lashes. Sido two was a tale of
stream-of-consciousness drowning. . .</P>
<P>    Blinking Into the light again, heavier drinking and food of the 'bet you
can't keep this one down' variety appeared, as did Kate and her bloke, a chap
with some of his hair in a plait but most of it in his sideburns.</P>
<P>    &quot;Ask her what she sees in that wally,&quot; snarled a certain
Brilliant Youth and, after tripping over a huge      promotional Wiemaraner (a
dog, it's a dog), one intrepid hack decided to be direct about it.</P>
<P>    &quot;Are you the boyfriend?&quot; she asked.</P>
<P>    &quot;Yeah, I am Del Palmer,&quot; replied the hapless soul.</P>
<P>    &quot;Sounds like an Italian cheese. And how long have you been with
Kate?&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;Seven years.&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;Tell me, why do you think she stays with you?&quot;</P>
<P>    Snitt. &quot;She loves me.&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;And why do you think that is?&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;Oh, I know the answer to that one!&quot; interrupted a young Fleet
Street Journo entering into the spirit. &quot;I've already asked      Kate. She
says he's sensitive and placid.&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;And artistic,&quot; said Del. &quot;I play bass on the record.&quot;</P>
<P>    Bored, Jaws scampered over to Kate for a chat. Had she been to this
impressive place before?</P>
<P>    &quot;No.&quot; (Sweet smile.)</P>
<P>    Was it your idea to hold the show here?</P>
<P>    &quot;No.&quot; (Sweet smile, fluttering lashes.)</P>
<P>    The LP... has a theme, doesn't It? How did the idea come to you?</P>
<P>    &quot;Er... l don't know.&quot;</P>
<P>    Jaws tried to prompt-we mean, be helpful. Was it, perhaps, a dream?</P>
<P>    &quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>    Ho hum, well, nice to meet you Kate.</P>
<P>    Jaw's crammed another salmon vol-au-vent into someone's face and
stumbled into the night, but one thing remains unsettled. Were there pin-tucks
around those pixie ears? We forgot to check. Why, why didn't we ask about the
last two years, and did she really balloon to 16 stone? Next time. . .</P>
