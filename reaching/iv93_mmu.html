Dec. 1993

<H2 ALIGN="center">From &quot;FAX&quot; on MuchMusic, Tuesday 14 December 1993:

</H2>
<P>Monika Deol (co-host): 'The Red Shoes' is Kate Bush's first album in 4
years. In  Toronto for a brief promotional tour, she spoke with 'The New Music's
 Jannalynna (sp?) White about the album's theme of dancing shoes, which was 
inspired by the 1948 film of the same name.

</P>
<P>JW: I was wondering what 'The Red Shoes' represented for you on a
metaphorical  level, based on knowing that it's an old European story. 
</P>
<P>KB: &lt;sitting, hands folded in lap, wearing leather biker's jacket&gt; 
</P>
<P>	I, I suppose it -- on lots of levels it's, it's very symbolic, but, uh, I
guess it's the  idea of being possessed by art that I think is, um, is
particularly interesting to  me, and the idea of, um, once you embrace the
obsession, that in a way it  begins, or it can, actually, take control of you,
uh, and I think in some ways with  my work, it's quite often a battle between
who's in charge when I'm making  records, you know, if it's it or me. 
</P>
<P>&lt;cut to &quot;When I slip out of my catapult...&quot;&gt; 
</P>
<P>JW: I've seen your progression as a dancer and a singer and-- &lt;clip from
'Moving',  Live at the Hammersmith&gt; and I think, &quot;God, she does it all
so well,&quot; and yet I  sense that you have a level of dissatisfaction around
your dance. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>KB: Oh yes, absolutely. I think I have a level of dissatisfaction around
everything I  do, really. I don't think I'd want to keep doing it if I didn't.
It's--in a way,  it's, uh, the desire to try and actually do something that
you'r pleased with  that, uh, &lt;laughing&gt; keeps you motivated.
