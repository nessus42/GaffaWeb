<H2>        DEL PALMER </H2>
<H2>     Kate Bush's right hand </H2>
<P>THE RED SHOES is the new album by Kate Bush; despite his full schedule her 
long time engineer Del Palmer took his time to tell FACHBLATT about the 
recording of the album and the contributions of such illustrious musicians like 
Clapton, Beck, Brooker and Prince. 
</P>
<P>By Richard Buskin 
</P>
<P>As an absolute autodidactic engineer and musician Del Palmer began playing
bass  guitar in 1967 and since played in numerous bands. His work behind the
console is  not marked by that many stations, but rather began around 1978 and
is especially tied  with the career of Kate Bush and the building of her home
studio. 
</P>
<P>Starting from very simple equipment with an eight track Teac recorder this 
studio was meant for for demo purposes of the second Bush album, LIONHEART,  and
Palmer was only involved in the work &quot;since no other band member wanted to 
operate the machine&quot;. Now, 15 years later, Del Palmer is Kate's first man
at the  faders, and the studio has been developed into a complete private
recording  landscape. 
</P>
<P>Found in the adjoining sheds of Bush's country seat this studio is equipped
with  an 48 track SSL 4000E console with G-series computer, two Sony 3324 A
digital  machines, a seldom used Studer A 80 1/2 inch and a pair of U-Matic
video recorders  which are used when working with film (Motion Worker System).
The recording  sessions for THE RED SHOES needed 18 real recording months,
distributed over  three years. &quot;As usual the whole thing started with Kate
saying: 'I want to do  something, I want to go into the studio working'&quot;,
Palmer reminds himself. &quot;In the  beginning phase I set up a sound for Kate,
build up a few keyboards and tell her  how to work with the console - then I
leave her alone. She works until she finds  something, and then musicians are
called in to continue working at it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The working relationship between Palmer and Bush is clearly defined. Both 
know exactly what they want and do. &quot;It happened on many occasions that we
had  heated conversations&quot; Palmer admits. &quot;She said: 'I want to do
that'. And I  responded: 'Look, you simply cannot do that! It won't work!'
Whereupon she  continued: 'Give in to me! Simply do it.' On the album HOUNDS OF
LOVE for  example there is the following part: Help me, baby, help me, baby.
This part is cut in  and out very fast. At that time she said she wanted to
achieve this by turning around  the tape and pressing the record button. I said
that will never work. That will just  result in a hopeless mess! Finally she had
her way - and of course it worked.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush herself is not opposed to work at the mixing pult herself, in some
passages  of the new album she herself lend a hand. &quot;Sometimes I left her
alone for days, in  which she recorded all vocals, only then she called me and
said: 'I have all vocals put  down, let us put everything together&quot;. There
is no particular method Kate is  working, but generally she says something as:
'Could you give me a drum pattern  that sounds like this?' Then she sings
something for me and I program the Fairlight  accordingly. Mostly these are
simple eight measure loops, then she programs a sound  into the Fairlight, works
with it and creates a melody until she has something and  wants to record
vocals. Sometimes it's only a 'la-la-la-ling', but almost always there  is a
small text line that gives her further ideas and that therefore becomes the
basis  for the song. So we record simply everything and so a basis demo is
created with  which we work -an eight measure drum loop, a keyboard and a rough
vocal line. In  this stadium Kate is able to say if it's rewarding to follow the
idea or not. Some ideas  of the new album were already dismissed in this
stadium, others got developed a bit  further until it became obvious that they
also won't work - perhaps they will be  used as b-sides or extra tracks.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Up to the THE RED SHOES project it was tradition to call in the musicians
one  by one into the studio so they could record their parts for the whole
album: at first -  according to Kate's opinion the most important - the drummer,
followed by the  bassist (often Del Palmer himself). This way of work made it
possible for Kate to  follow the development of a song permanently and to
eventually change the keyboard  parts or vocals. But this time for the reasons
to record as quickly as possible and to  get a stronger bandlike feeling we
worked differently. For most of the tracks at least  drums and bass were
recorded together, sometimes even together with the  keyboards. 
</P>
<P>Palmer, who wanted to concentrate more on the engineering task, decided not
to  play bass, but therefore he looked after the bassist and drummer over a
period of  ten days to strengthen the band feeling. Looking after the guitars
wasn't necessary,  though the song RUBBERBAND GIRL has keyboard patterns played
by Kate that  sound like acoustic guitars but that are actually sampled. 
</P>
<P>&quot;On the track BIG STRIPEY LIE she even played an electric guitar&quot;,
Palmer  stresses. &quot;She said to the guitarist who was playing for us: 'I
really stand on guitars. I  would like to be able to play it'. He answered: 'Oh,
here, play this one (a Fender  Stratocaster) a bit'. Then he showed her a few
accords and - that now is not a joke  - one week later she stood in front of a
Marshall stack in the studio! I tell you, I  haven't seen such a thing. It lies
in her nature. She played lead guitar, and if she  hadn't told anyone, no one
had known that there wasn't an experienced guitarist at  work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Compression overdose 
</P>
<P>The typical &quot;Kate Bush sound&quot; that developed during the last four
albums,  resulted not only from the pulsing, highly atmospheric sounds that seem
to come  from everywhere, but of course also from Kate's completely unique, airy
and  whiling vocal characteristic. At the beginning there was WUTHERING HEIGHTS,
 in the meantime a lot has changed, in the sound as well as in other areas. &quot;I
 personally can not give any credits for Kate's vocal sound to myself&quot;,
Palmer admits,  &quot;because originally it was shown to me by an engineer named
Paul Arden, who  taught me many things. He never made a secret out of his work.
Always when he  asked something he showed it to me. Once he couldn't make a
session and he asked  me if I was able to do it. I only stammered: Oh, I don't
know... 
</P>
<P>Whereupon he responded: 'What do you think about? Just do it!' He showed me 
how to use the sound they had started using on the album DREAMING. Kate loved 
that sound, and since then we are working like this. 
</P>
<P>Basically we work with an 'overdose' of compression, with which Kate can
work  very good. I think that this method would be impossible for an average
singer. She  has to wear her headphones extremely close-fitting, because
otherwise the sound is  so live that it comes through everywhere. We put her
with a Neumann U47 into the  live area of the studio - tiled floor and stone
walls, so it is very, very live - and put a  lot of compression on her singing.
The compression of the SSL pult is so enormous  and fits very good to this
method. What happens is that you can hear her breathing  in every time, and
therefore she has to work in a very special way to get along with  that. 
</P>
<P>She permanently moves away from the microphone and really works with it. In 
addition we put a slight gate onto the tracks, because this way we get some of
the  room sound before it gets cut away - it is similar to the Phil Collins drum
sound.  When Kate sings loud she moves away from the microphone, in the softer
passages  she goes closer again. When she breathes in she lays her head to the
side. The gain  on the mike is very high, and together with the compression the
voice is really  crushed up. Technically how we work is really bad, because
there's a lot of  compression everywhere. But such things do not interest me; I
just want that it  sounds good. The point is that it works for Kate. 
</P>
<P>As soon as it comes to the mix you mustn't pull up the voice as high as you 
perhaps might think, because with this sound you get so many treble. We really
are  working at the limits. Sometimes we go over the limits and it sounds
distorted or  blasts away our heads, but when we find the right spot we can pull
down the voice  and it will nevertheless put itself through everything.&quot; In
average Kate Bush records  five takes for every vocal passage, and generally
there is a favorite take in the  master mix. The choice is done with notes Kate
has done; on this notes there are all  text lines. While listening she adds
small comments. As soon as we get to the punch  in of certain vocal parts there
might be problems if the noise gate produces  synchronisation errors. But
nevertheless, says Palmer, he always finds a way to solve  such problems,
regardless of how precise the work has to be. &quot;Generally Kate  records a
complete passage, which normally works - I just have to do slight  corrections.
In some cases I just drop in a syllable of a word. Through the speed of  digital
machines this works.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Interfering noises 
</P>
<P>Palmer stresses that he doesn't have to work on Bush's voice not because of
an  unstatic performance but rather because of the above mentioned way of
producing  her vocal sound - many interfering noises also get onto the tape. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It is subliminal, but on every album where we worked with that method
you can  hear a chirp in the vocal passages. It is so live that everything gets
recorded.  Sometimes, even when the red lights are on, you can hear people going
through the  side gate and talking - then we have to turn off the tape and wait.
In addition we  often can only record at night, because during the day you can
hear the cars from  the highway that's half a mile away.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When Palmer and Bush have to fight with such problems they do not at all
rely  on the old motto that everything can be improved later in the mix. Palmer
stresses  that you really could take it out in the mix. Therefore both pay
attention that from  the start everything is put onto the tape correctly. When
the time for the master  mix of the actual album came they only had to create
the balance, space and a  moment for everything. Nevertheless there were
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed we kept some effects on the tape that Kate actually wanted up
to the  mix. With the song RED SHOES for example, when she sings the text line
'She's  gotta dance', you can hear this little sound effect, a really high delay
out of an old  AMS - octave above, octave below -, that goes through a SONY M7
digital multi  effect unit. We fiddled with it while recording the song, but
kept it up to the mix.  There we still would have been able to put it onto its
own fader and take it out if we  wanted to. The whole thing depends on how you
build it up. You have to take it in  and out at the right time and not spoil one
or two tracks to record it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>With RUBBERBAND GIRL there is a wabbling effect that is made by fading the 
voice while the stereo image of a digital delay is faded up below it. &quot;Both
signals  arrive at a point where they overlap and the effect signal gets louder.
Then the  complete signal gets faded out and disappears more and more strangely
in the  background. In the meantime the whole time a Lexicon 224 hall is added
to it to  make it appear even more distant. In other applications I used a 480
L, a 244, a 244 L,  a Quantec, a Yamaha Rev 5, a Rev 7, a SPX 90, an old
Eventide harmonizer, a  Dimension D, a whole lot of stuff ... I always try to
use the Quantec for vocals,  because it has a very cold and icy sound that
matches the chilly vocal sound; it makes  the thing specific. On the other hand
I use a warm hall room from the 480 L for the  background vocals and pianos and
a short room delay from one of the 244s. So I have  a long and a short hall. On
the snare drum I had a reverse gate from the Rev 7 to get  the sound harder. All
drums came out of the sampler, an Akai S9000, and were  recorded with Simmons
pads. Our studio is so small that it has a very special sound,  and we didn't
want it. When we used samples we not only had complete separation  of the sounds
but also a fantastic selection. With the Rev 7 the sound is certainly  fatter
and rounder. Especially with songs like SO IS LOVE and RUBBERBAND  GIRL this
happened to work well.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One of the significant factors with tracks like RUBBERBAND GIRL and BIG 
STRIPEY LIE is the pumping 5 string bass sound, played by John Gidman with a  G&amp;K
amp and miked with a RE20 in the kitchen to separate the sound from the  drums.
&quot;I turned it up that high that it really was distorted&quot;, Palmer says, &quot;and
added  tons of compression to get the sound really pumping. And here again: he
plays that  well that it always sounds, regardless of what you do with the
sound. He has a very  light playing technique, and I had to tune the sound
especially for him, else he would  have had problems. I had to make it possible
for him to play lightly, and when I did  manage this it just knocked me down. It
was too good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The guest list 
</P>
<P>With the exception of the piano (recorded with 87s and Massenburg Parametric
 EQ), Fender Rhodes and Yamaha DX7 all keyboard sounds were produced with a 
Fairlight. The other musicians didn't have very much room for experiments,
because  Bush exactly knew what she wanted, though she wasn't reserved for ideas
and  suggestions. Exactly therefore Palmer recorded the complete sessions so
that at every  time she was able to fall back on certain things. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even while the musicians build up I record everything, in case Kate
asks if I  remember the things played while warming up. And it's clear that you
have  forgotten them if there's no recording. As soon as someone is in the room
I let the  1/2 inch run.&quot; 
</P>
<P>All in all this is certainly a clever way of working, especially since some
of the  &quot;band members&quot; were only guests and others only showed up from
time to time.  The violinist Nigel Kennedy who put his service at disposal for
BIG STRIPEY LIE  and TOP OF THE CITY was recorded standing on a carpet in the
sound-proof  chamber of the two main live rooms. &quot;The thing with Nigel is
that he couldn't stand  still. Somehow he moves around the whole time. So after
a talk with him I decided  to record with a pair of 87s. They are so
all-purpose, I use them for everything. One  87 was placed about two and a half
meters above the ground over his left shoulder  and directed at his violin, the
other was diagonally to his right shoulder in a height of  one meter, it was
directed to his breast. The violin always sounds a bit chirpy, and so  I used
the Massenburg equalizer again. We have to take care of the mid-high 
frequencies, because our rooms are so specific that you can produce a sound that
 goes straight through the ear.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Jeff Beck played his Beck-Signature-Stratocaster in YOU'RE THE ONE out of 
the control room over a little amp that was positioned below the front of the
console  next to his right foot. The signal was recorded with a 87 which was
placed about 7  centimeters from the amp and was directed directly towards it. &quot;I
sat directly at the  console, the racks to my left and Kate to my right side.
Jeff sat about one and a half  meters behind us; so she could always tell him
how to do things. In the meantime I  could operate the racks and the console.&quot;
In the meantime Eric Clapton played his  Signature-Strat over a similar setup
for AND SO IS LOVE, with the difference that  his amp was placed in the studio
area. &quot;What mostly happens with people like Eric  Clapton is that a guitar
roadie lugs wheel barrows of equipment into the studio. And  then, when Eric
appears, you say to him that you really just want his classic sound,  and he
digs out his small Combo.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Gary Brooker, think about his famous Procol Harum past, played his Hammond 
C3, miked with an 87 (what else?) over a Leslie Cabinet in the main room,
another  87 was three meters away in the room, to get the room sound. And again
the  Massenburg Equalizer and hard compression was used, with which a very fat 
hammond sound at low volume was achieved. 
</P>
<P>The specific sound of Kate Bush's studio in the head, they decided to use
the  Abbey Road 2 studios to record the singing of the Trio Bulgarka more flat.
There  they stood around a pair of - guessed correctly - 87s. The string
sessions for  MOMENTS OF PLEASURE were recorded in Abbey Road Studio 1. These 20
 headed string sections were arranged by Michael Kamen, and the engineering was 
done by Hayden Bendall. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The only other things we did in the Abbey Road studios were of pure
technical  nature, as for example the transmission from analog materials to
digital ones&quot;, says  Del Palmer. &quot;We began the album on 48 analog
tracks with two A80, and after a  year it became clear to us that we should
continue digitally ... We weren't sure if  this would work - we thought that we
couldn't get an as good drum sound without  the tape compression, but after we
had the bloody bastards working for an hour I  was convinced. They were simply
good. 
</P>
<P>With Kate's material, where you have so many level changes, there is a
steady  fight between noise level and signal level. But with digital machines
you don't have  it. You can record the quietest things without getting any
background noises. Truth is  that in the end I had to fight with the pult noises
that also got recorded. With a  heavy heart I kept it that way because with an
average home stereo you can't hear  anything anyway. I noticed that with the
digital way of work I used much less EQ; I  didn't have to make compromises.&quot;

</P>
<P>As it showed up much of the analog material got replaced by digital
material,  because they decided quite early during the RED SHOE sessions to use
a digital way  of work - except the contributions of the Trio Bulgarka and Nigel
Kennedy, these  stayed analog. 
</P>
<P>&quot;With the digital way of work very many doors we didn't think of before
have  opened for us. The result was that Kate had a whole flood of ideas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The nameless small man 
</P>
<P>At a concert of Prince in the Earls Court he gave Kate Bush a sign of
admiring  her work; that was the cause for a collaboration. After permanent
contacts and his  approval to work in one track they send an analog tape to
Paisley Park. Bush tried to  reach him on telephone. She was told by assistants
that &quot;he works on it&quot;. Then, a  month later, several tapes came back
from Paisley Park. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He took a four measure part of a chorus of one of Kate's songs, made a
loop out  of it and just slammed 48 tracks with everything possible: guitars,
keyboards, drums,  voices ... I sat there and thought: Wow, that's great, but
what the hell should we do  with that? I created a mix and gave it to Kate, and
she puzzled months on it. We  came back to this part again and again and with a
lot of work she made this song to  what it once was. It was simply crazy, all
this stuff on a four measure loop; there was  no relation, no sense. Completely
according to the motto: here it is, take what you  need. It sounded this way
because she only told him: 'I want that you sing a bit here  and a bit there.'
He did do this, but over the loop that he created. So we had the  wanted vocals,
but not at the right position. We had to puzzle around with the voice  parts and
insert them were we wanted them; the same thing with the solo guitar.  We also
had to reconstruct the verses, so that they again matched to the lyrics. Then 
we exchanged the original drums with new, more adequate ones, because it became 
more of an up tempo song. Goal of the whole procedure was to again make a Kate 
Bush piece out of it. And even though it honestly didn't work in many areas as
we  hoped it would it still is a very interesting mishmash song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the future Del Palmer sees a whole lot of new studio equipment with which
 Kate Bush should get in contact, but with which he at first wants to concern
himself  more closely. &quot;One point where I want to work at is the user
friendliness of the  studio for Kate. Everything should be cabled permanently,
so that she just has to  press one button and the Fairlight or something else
starts playing or working. I will  find a lot of toys for her...&quot; 
</P>
<P>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . 
</P>
<P>On the first album for almost four years break the English woman who's also 
titled &quot;Garbo of pop&quot; offers her fans the usual picture: cracked
sounds, tracked  arrangements, lots of atmosphere, as dreamy as dared vocal
passages, a contingent of  stars with no equals (Eric Clapton, Prince, Jeff
Beck, Gary Brooker, Nigel Kennedy),  and the matching contingent of hits
(RUBBERBAND GIRL, TOP OF THE CITY).  But for me the opus that was written and
produced by Kate Bush alone has its  strongest moments when she frees herself
from her unmistakable (and for my taste  overdone) play instinct and makes music
alone with keyboards (MOMENTS OF  PLEASURE) or small line-up (YOU'RE THE ONE
with Brookers Hammond organ,  Becks catchy guitar and the impressing singing of
the Trio Bulgarka) - these  moments are much to seldom here ... My wish for the
next album: less is more!
