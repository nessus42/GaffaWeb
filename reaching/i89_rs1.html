(short excerpt) 
</P>
<P> Kate has a blurb in the new issue (November 2) of Rolling Stone. IED forgot
to  bring it to the computer, but it is very short. In brief, Kate says she
hopes the new  album will be of comfort to people who need it; that the songs
are all &quot;little short  stories&quot;; that she hasn't toured in ten years
and that she has no great desire to,  adding that all one is doing in a tour is
&quot;reproducing old songs&quot;; and that she is not  bothered in the least
that she has never been very popular in the U.S., because she  doesn't see
making albums as a means of &quot;sweeping the market&quot;. 
</P>
<P>There is a small colour photograph of Kate by John Carder Bush next to the 
mini-article/interview, taken from the same session used for the TSW single:
Kate  is seen looking up and off to the right of the camera, with her hand out
in front of  her and sand (or dust, or ashes?) running through her fingers. It
is a slightly  different shot, but very similar to the black-and-white shot used
for the single cover.

<P>P.S.: The misspelling of &quot;voracious&quot; which appeared in IED's
transcription of the  NME interview was the result of an error by IED's
typesetter.

<P>Date: Thu, 12 Oct 89 20:43:45 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward

</P>
<P>There's a short article on Kate in the &quot;Random Notes&quot; section of
the November 2  issue of Rolling Stone. (Finally! I was wondering when they'd
notice.) Here's what  it says: 
</P>
<P> &quot;I'd like to think that some of the songs could be of some comfort if
anyone's  having a hard time,&quot; says KATE BUSH, whose new album, The Sensual
World, is  just out. &quot;Each song is a scenario in a way, a short story.&quot;

</P>
<P>It's been four years since Bush has released an album of new material -- she
did  release a compilation album in 1986 -- but it's been even longer since
she's toured.  &quot;My touring situation is a little unusual, to say the least,&quot;
she says. &quot;I've only ever  done one tour, and that was ten years ago, and
since then I've only concentrated on  albums. I much enjoyed the tour. But
touring is just re-creating music that already  exists.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Perhaps because she doesn't tour, Bush, who's a major star in England, has 
never reached as broad an audience in the U.S. &quot;It doesn't really upset me,&quot;
she  says. &quot;I've never seen making an album in terms of sweeping the
market.&quot; 
</P>
<P>---------------------
</P>
<P>There's also a picture of her with sand running through her fingers. It's
not  really a very good picture, in my opinion (she's got kind of a long face),
but it's in  color, at least. 
</P>
<P>I'm interested in what RS has to say about the album. Her reviews have never
 been that great in this magazine. They gave a terrible review to The Kick
Inside,  and their review of Hounds of Love was one of the few that was not
wholly  favorable. Yet in the last few years, she's been used as an example of a
great artist.  For example, in the Sinead O'Connor review, Kate is called one of
the female artists  &quot;breaking down the walls of pop music,&quot; and in an
article on Jane Siberry, Jane is  said to have &quot;the offbeat charm of Kate
Bush.&quot; So we'll see.
