<H3>&quot;Bird In The Bush&quot;
</H3>
<P>    OKAY, I won't beat about the bush (chance would be a      fine thing)
I'll get it off my chest right at the beginning      Kate Bush is. . . a girl.</P>
<P>    So what's new?</P>
<P>    Let me finish. A girl with a neat line in pre-packaged,      stay fresh
sexuality. A girl with the breasts of a      Victorian princess (huh?), the lips
of a Rembrandt      cherub, the eyes of an Arabian Night, the hair of a . . .</P>
<P>    In other words, she ain't a bad looking bird.</P>
<P>    She also happens to own the most unique voice this      side of Tiny
Tim. To many the sound emanating from those      elaborate lips is nothing more
than a disturbing noise,      like running your teeth over a blackboard or
scratching      your nails across hardboard.</P>
<P>    But to others the Bush larynx is an excuse for them      to venture into
paroxysms of delight. They liken it to a      soaring bird, an Olympian call, a
celebration of all that      is celestial and god like.</P>
<P>    Now that's going a bit too far. Fact of the matter is,     Kate Bush is
a novelty and novelties are notoriously     fey.</P>
<P>    But that doesn't mean to say I'm writing her off as     a two-year
wonder. After all, the lady is only 20. And she      does compose all her own
material. And she has      got the backing of the biggest record company in     
Britain. And she is ambitious.</P>
<P>    And she comes from a gold plated background.</P>
<P>    Her father is a general practitioner and she was      brought up in an
essentially middle class embryo in      down town Kent.</P>
<P>    &quot;I had two older brothers,&quot; she recalls in      that just so
velveteen voice &quot;who were very      into music and played lots of
instruments so I guess      I just grew up surrounded by music.&quot;</P>
<P>    The brothers played around local folk clubs specialising      in Irish
and English traditional music.</P>
<P>    Kate attended a grammar school but she feels she never      really
slotted in with the teacher/pupil situation. &quot;I      wasn't responsive to
the teachers' system and I turned      into myself. I used to come home and play
around on the      piano, making up little songs.&quot;</P>
<P>    The Great Escape no less. But surprisingly, for one who     wasn't at
all &quot;responsive&quot; at school she zoomed     through ten 'O' levels.
Despite such an impressive scholarly     success she left school at 16 with an
intense determination     to crack the musical world.</P>
<P>    Around this time her aunt died and left Kate a bob or      two. Thus she
became more and more independent which      in turn increased her musical
motivation. She started      writing poetry to her tunes.</P>
<P>    Luckily, comfort nurtured her talent. Coming from a      fairly affluent
environment it's only natural that you are      presented with both the time and
the space to indulge in      fantasies which can ultimately become real.</P>
<P>    But affluence didn't help her attain a record deal. Her      brothers
weren't slow in sussing that little sis wasn't      just another 16-year-old
poor little rich kid with a host of      acne ridden boyfriends and a drawer
full of mascara. Her      penchant for writing unusual  but nifty songs had
attracted      them and they started hocking a tape round to several      record
companies.</P>
<P>    Kate didn't have to worry about silly little inconsequential      
things like working or anything so she concentrated solely      on her music. &quot;I
wanted to try and do what I wanted      to do so I could at least say to myself
that I tried. Obviously      my inheritance helped a lot.&quot;</P>
<P>    During one of the tape hocking escapades, Dave Gilmour,      of Pink
Floyd fame, latched on to these childlike songs      and childlike voice. He
wanted to hear more.</P>
<P>    &quot;I was really nervous at meeting Dave but he turned      out to be
such a sweet guy. He put up all the money      required for me to make a demo
tape of my best      numbers. It must have cost him a great deal of money     
but he didn't want a penny in return. He just likes to help      new talent.&quot;</P>
<P>    Result - EMI heard, saw, loved, signed. But, it was still      too early
for the 16-year-old to cut it as a star. In a unique     move EMI advanced her &pound;3000
and instructed     her to let nature take its course -- that is, get older,    
wiser and write some hits ma'am.</P>
<P>    Lucky lady. First thing young Kate did was to enroll in a      school of
mime where Lindsay Kemp taught. Lindsay, you      will recall, taught an
aspiring David Bowie the art of mime.      &quot;He taught me that it is
possible to express with your      body. When your body is awake, so is your
mind. I'll always      remember that.&quot;</P>
<P>    Then she had a stab at modern dance in a Covent Garden      college with
tuition from Arlene Phillips who later created      Hot Gossip. She admits she
was hopeless. &quot;It's so      very difficult. I naively thought I'd have it
all sown up by the      end of the week. But I soon realised it would take at
least      ten years to be able to master just one facet of dance.&quot;</P>
<P>    Artistically she was getting increasingly frustrated. Time was     
passing and there was still no sign of her actually entering a      studio to
cut a record. &quot;I wanted to communicate with      people, to let them know
what I thought.&quot;</P>
<P>    Maybe it was just this frustration that made her decide to      leave
home. But, she didn't exactly ostracize herself from      her family. The South
East London flat she moved into was      owned by her ...father. And her closest
neighbours are her...      brothers who live in the same place. It is divided
into three      flats, one for her and one for each of her two brothers,     
Paddy and John.</P>
<P>    &quot;I left home because I wanted to grow up. There      was a need to
be myself and not have my parent's      influence all the time. I wasn't having
any troubles with      them or anything. I just thought it was best to get away.</P>
<P>    &quot;But it is great knowing that your brothers are around     
whenever you need them.&quot;</P>
<P>    Then the call she was waiting for. She went into the studio      and
recorded &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. It was      inspired by the Emily Bronte
(who, incidentally was born      on July 30, the same day as Kate).</P>
<P>    &quot;I thought it was a great subject for a song. I found I could     
really relate to Kathy [sic] and I live the part when I      perform it.&quot;</P>
<P>    Her first single was swiftly followed up by &quot;The Man      With the
Child In His Eyes,&quot; which she wrote some      four years ago. Said Kate: &quot;I
just noticed that men      retain a capacity to enjoy childish games throughout
their      lives, and women don't seem to be able to do that.&quot;</P>
<P>    Said Kate: &quot;I'm not really a singer, I'm a songwriter.     There
are plenty of girls with good voices but not many      girls who write songs! I
think of the tune first, keeping it in      my head until I have the words. I
don't usually write      autobiographically, if the song is about myself I
retain      the feeling but change the incident. Emily Bronte died      from
consumption. It makes you incredibly randy but      impotent at the same time,
so all that frustration was the      energy for her &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;
</P>
<P>    Sometimes I get really worried because I'm not sure if I     can ever
write another song, but that's often because I've      not had enough time to
get the flow going. It's very inspiring      sometimes to write under pressure
because you're in a very      extreme emotional state.&quot;</P>
<P>    The album <EM>The Kick Inside</EM> followed the number      one success
of &quot;Heights&quot; and was well received.      Miss Bush had arrived.</P>
<P>    But had she arrived as a singer, sex object, or returning to my     
original assumption, novelty?</P>
<P>    As a singer - &quot;When I first started out my voice was awful.     
But it's like when you start to play a musical instrument. At first      it's
little more than a noise but with training you learn how to      control and
eventually master it. I've had no voice training. I      just practised and
practiced, trying to reach one note a week,      a higher one the next.&quot;</P>
<P>    As a sex object - &quot;I want to have people recognise me      for my
work, not my body. I know people are going to      capitalise on it and
obviously that annoys me. I don't see why      people should know all about my
sex life - it's irrelevant. </P>
<P>    They can find out all they need to know about me in my songs      which
are intensely personal. Just because I'm only 20 doesn't      mean to say I
haven't experienced life.&quot;</P>
<P>    As a novely - that remains to be seen.</P>
<P>    When Kate first appeared there were many critics who strove      to put
her down as a one-shot gimmick. Not so Auberon Waugh,      who writes for <EM>Private
Eye</EM> and <EM>The Spectator</EM>. Usually      malicious about everyone, he
writes nice things about Kate.      However, he did say &quot;Ravishing and
breathtaking she may      be, but when one enquires about these things, there
usually turns      out to be a young man in tow.&quot;</P>
<P>    At the moment Kate, who is, incidentally, a vegetarian, is      doing
very nicely thank you living in her luxurious London      flat with her piano
and two cats, Zoodle and Pyewacket.      She insists they can tell a good friend
from a &quot;phoney&quot;,      for when a visitor arrived they are either
hostile or      affectionate. She does have a regular boyfriend by the      name
of Del, (the man with the child in his eyes?) who      amongst other things,
plays guitar in her band.</P>
<P>    &quot;As long as my looks don't interfer with my progress,      that's
all that really concerns me about the whole image      syndrome.&quot;</P>
<P>    Kate's second album to be unleashed is &quot;Lionheart.&quot;     Said
Kate: &quot;There are no special themes because I      always treat each song as
a separate entity. I think many      of the songs are much more uptempo. I love
rock songs      but usually they're just three chords. I like a really strong   
  melody line.&quot; Kate's third single &quot;Hammer      Horror&quot; is am
haunting song from the album.</P>
<P>    It seems that as long as her voice can hold out she'll      sell
records. It's simply a question of whether or not      the fickle public will
continue to find that incredible voice      interesting enough to make them part
with their dough.     For far from being the one-hit  wonder some said she was, 
    Kate is definitely unique. </P>
