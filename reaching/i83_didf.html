<P>Kate's Desert Island Videos 
</P>
<P>Vickie here, I was digging around in our &quot;Dresser Full'o'Kate&quot;
trying to find  things obsure enough to have not been posted before and I came
across this gem. 
</P>
<P>This is from the March 1983 issue of Popular Video (a UK magazine): 
</P>
<P> This month's castaway: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>Interview: John Kercher 
</P>
<P>There can't be many men who would turn down the opportunity of rescuing 
Kate Bush from a desert island. however, Kate might just be a little reluctant
to get  back to civilisation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Being stuck there could be an idyllic time,&quot; she says. &quot;I've
always enjoyed  working alone, even as a kid, and I can collect all my thoughts
together then. But the  prospect of being there with my favorite films is
exciting, because I love the cinema  and rarely get the chance to visit it
because of my work. So I'd go to town on my  selection.&quot; 
</P>
<P>KAGEMUSHA 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not a lot of people have heard of this one, but it's by the Japanese
director  Akira Kurosawa. I just happen to think that this is one of his best.
It was a toss up  between this and his Seven Samurai, which is a tremendously
atmospheric picture.  However, I think this one wins the day.&quot; 
</P>
<P>PSYCHO 
</P>
<P>&quot;As there wouldn't be a shower within thousands of miles...or a
motel...I'd feel  quite safe having this along with me. Of course it scares me
silly, and the fact that  it's in black and white only adds to the terror, but
Anthony Perkins is so marvellous  in it. It's one of those films I can watch
lots of times, even though I know the  ending.&quot; 
</P>
<P>TIME BANDITS 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is the kind of film that'll be around for years-like the Disney
ones. When  Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin of the Monty Python team got
together on this they  must have been inspired, because it appeals to kids and
adults alike. The story is so  original and seems to incorporate just about
everything from pantomime, fairy tales,  drama...the whole show.&quot; 
</P>
<P>DON'T LOOK NOW 
</P>
<P>&quot;Donald Sutherland I can always watch - he's got such a wry sense of
humour.  Ever since I saw him in M*A*S*H I became a fan. And yet in this film
there's no  humour at all. It's a real creepy and has a terrifying climax. But
there's such a lot to  be observed in the relationship between Donald Sutherland
and Julie Christie that  you don't get tired of it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>NIGHT OF THE DEMON 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is an oldie, if the fifties can be described as old. The Night of
the Demon is  one of the better horror films from that period, which really
keeps you on the edge  of your seat without frightening you out of it. It's
about a secret ancient inscription  of the rune symbols at Stonehenge. Whoever
hold a certain peice of paper with  them written on incites the wrath of the
demons. Very exciting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>BARRY LYNDON 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not too much to say about this film, except that I love the story and
the whole  atmosphere of the film. It's just a picture that moves me
emotionally.&quot; 
</P>
<P>NOTORIOUS 
</P>
<P>&quot;Marvellous Hitchcock stuff. Really vintage and one of the classics
with Ingred  Bergman and Cary Grant. It's that build up of mystery that
fascinates me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>PINNOCHIO 
</P>
<P>&quot;This film just goes on forever; it's timeless. I saw it when I was a
kid and I go to  see it whenever it comes on the circuit. Magical! I love fairy
stories anyway.&quot; 
</P>
<P>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD 
</P>
<P>&quot;I read the book, then saw the film, and I wasn't disappointed. It's
the story that  appeals most here. Just a marvellous film.&quot; 
</P>
<P>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK 
</P>
<P>&quot;Working this lot out, I've realized what contrasting tastes I've got
in films. But  here, I think that the sequel to Star Wars is better than its
predecessor. There was  always the risk that it would be some kind of
anti-climax, but it goes beyond  expectations.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That's it! If Kate were doing a list like this today it's certain she would
include  Brazil. Her selections are interesting, aren't they? Also, I love some
of the phrases  she uses, particularly &quot;...go to town on my selection&quot;
and &quot;It's a real creepy...&quot;. And  let us not forget &quot;...scares me
silly...&quot;! Her grammar is wretched but cute. 
</P>
<P>I've seen every film on her list except Kagemusha. I haven't been able to
find  that one on video. I've been able to find quite a few others and they are
excellent.  (Has anyone else seen Dersu Uzala? One of my all-time favorite
films.)
