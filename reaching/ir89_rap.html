Subject: Rapido on BBC2 14th October 1989 (short mentioning) 
</p>



<p>On Saturday 14th October, the music programme Rapido on BBC2 (That's British 
TV for you US Love-Hounds) began with an interview with Kate plus a couple of 
short video clips ( RUTH and TSW ). Over footage of Kate at home on the farm, 
making tea, and slaving over a hot mixing desk with Dave Gilmour, we had the usual 
references to her career, etc. 
</p>

<p>However, with Kate speaking on camera, she revealed her amazement at the way 
her fans stuck with her for years at a time, just waiting for that new album ... She 
giggled and said she thought &quot;[we were] all just crazy&quot;. The way she said this was SO 
cute, in that London accent of hers ... 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was very little about the album itself, other than that it is 
due out in the UK on Tuesday 17th October (Hope I got that right - couldn't video 
it).
