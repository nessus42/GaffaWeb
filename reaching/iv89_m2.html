Subject: MTV &quot;News At Night&quot; Jan. 1990 
</p>



<p>Chris'n'Vickie here. Hold off on sending those fruitcakes to Empty-vee. This 
just appeared on MTV &quot;News At Night&quot; as the last feature at 11:55 CST. 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: Unknown woman. 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: Tim Sommer (of Post-Modern MTV &amp; Hugo Largo) 
</p>

<p>Host: John Norris (sitting in for Kurt Loder) 
</p>



<p>Host: Long before it became trendy for big stars to take two or three years between 
albums, England's mysterious Kate Bush was keeping a low profile and laboring 
over her work. In fact in twelve years Bush has released only six LPs. She went 
the entire nineteen-eighties without going on tour and she doesn't have any plans 
to go on the road right now. But she does have a new album in stores titled &quot;The 
Sensual World&quot;, and we recently sat down with Kate for a look inside her own 
rather illusive and ethereal world. 
</p>

<p>{Music: &quot;Love and Anger&quot;} 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Video of &quot;Love and Anger&quot; (Kate moving backwards into the blue light)} 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: Ah, the mysterious Kate Bush. Tell me something about her. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Very heavily processed tight shot of Kate's face. Solarised.} 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: Well since late nineteen-seventies she's put out a record about once 
every two years, and she's just released a new album &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: shot of &quot;The Sensual World&quot; album cover zooms in.} 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: She's got a spectacular voice, she make really dramatic videos, but she 
never tours. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Posterized shot of Kate looking back behind her chair. This remains as 
background...} 
</p>

<p>Kate: So that's the way I am, I guess. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Small box with Kate in it, floats dowm left side, during the above} 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: She toured once didn't she? 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: Yeah, way back in ninteen-seventy-eight but she never toured again. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; dancing with band. Crossfades to &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;} 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: You see she sort of exists only as this magical character you see in videos 
and hear on records. 
</p>

<p>Kate: And again that's a very subjective.....opinion. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: First full-screen, head-and-shoulders shot, of Kate. She is wearing a dark 
grey blouse and the &quot;Love and Anger&quot; earrings. She is wearing a very small 
necklace. Her name is keyed over at bottom of screen. She looks to her upper 
left, searching, before saying &quot;opinion&quot;.} 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: But you talked to her didn't you? 
</p>

<p>{Visual: When Kate isn't talking, it is either shots from &quot;Love and Anger&quot; or 
processed two-tone, yellow and brown, loose footage.} 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: Yeah, and she's very guarded. 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: Guarded? 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: Yeah. Guarded. 
</p>

<p>Kate: I wanted my work to speak. Not me as a person. Because I feel that's what I 
want to give to the world..is..is the work that I do, not really me, or what I have 
to say. 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: What did she say about this never touring thing? 
</p>

<p>{Visual: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; video. Kate throws glitter} 
</p>

<p>Kate: After the last tour, which was a long time ago, I just felt very vulnerable. I'd 
been through tremendous public exposure, at a young age, and um..I hadn't 
really stopped since it had started. And I think, really, over these years of being 
in the studio and being quite reclusive in some ways, I've gained a lot of my 
strength back, that I did lose. And that's very important for me to keep my 
creative energies intact. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: dissolve to cover edit} 
</p>

<p>And I think in many ways, retreating like I have, has helped me to be taken more 
seriously as an artist, and um.., (purses her lips...lip smacking noise), that's good 
for me because that's what I've wanted, I've wanted to sort of quietly get on 
with my work. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; spins in with Kate standing there with orb and septre in 
front of ballet dancers.} {Music: &quot;Love and Anger&quot;(gets louder and then drops 
when Male Voice speaks} 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: She definitely wants her videos and records to be this magical place. 
Can I tell you something weird? 
</p>

<p>Female Voice: Yeah? 
</p>

<p>Male Voice: Well. During the whole interview, I was really distracted by this 
yellow-green aura that was surrounding her body. I'm completely serious. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Processed shot of Kate. Her face is in the clear but she is surrounded by a 
reddish color. Dissolves to normal shot when she starts speaking.} 
</p>

<p>Kate: I think there's an awful lot of uh..sympathetic..magic almost, that goes on in 
art. Where people do want to be..something other than what they are. 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Video from &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; with audio from 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;} 
</p>

<p>More and more I think, this is, kind of, the special thing about music, that it's not to 
do with *language*, 
</p>

<p>{Visual: Back to normal video} 
</p>

<p>that is connected with words, it's to do with,almost a sort of..subconsious language, 
that people understand, that sounds can create feelings in other people, um..you 
can actually say something to someone without words by using shapes of sounds,.. 
and it seems like a totally facinating thing to me, and, uh, I mean music is just 
so.....(phuhh..breath expelling noise, much like the ships in &quot;Astroids&quot;) It's mind 
boggling isn't it? Don't you think? 
</p>

<p>Host: And how Kate. Kate Bush. Her new album is &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. 
</p>

<p>---
</p>



<p>Well it's about time, isn't it? There should be more of this interview to come on 
&quot;Post-Modern MTV&quot; and &quot;120 Minutes&quot; and &quot;MTV Music News&quot;. We will, of course, 
be suffering through hours of horrific, sexist, stupid videos to get these little pieces 
of Kate interviews. Pity us.

Subject: KaTe on MTV's News at Night 
</p>



<p>While accidentially flipping through the channels just a few minutes ago, I caught 
MTV's other-news-guy saying, &quot;Up next, we'll take a peek into the magical world 
of KaTe Bush&quot; (paraphrased of course). I quickly ran up stairs to find a tape for the 
VCR, came back down and found that it was wound to the middle of VH-1's 
Sensual World Special, so had to set it up first, thereby missing the first few seconds 
of the clip. After that, it wouldn't record so I missed it anyways. 
</p>

<p>Still, I'll try to paraphrase what she said. 
</p>

<p>On touring: she said that the Tour of Life left her feeling very &quot;vulnerable,&quot; and 
that this was at the heart of why she hasn't toured since then. Also wrapped up in 
that was a bit about how she wanted to be taken seriously as an artist, which was 
also related to the touring (or lack thereof). They talked a little bit about her videos 
and the lengthy delay between albums (of course, they neglected to realize that her 
first three were within a year or two of each other). I can't remember much 
more...not that there was. 
</p>

<p>Oh, the thing that I thought funny was when the announcer said that he saw a 
yellow and green aura around KaTe throughout the interview. Right after that little 
tidbit of info, they cut back to the interview with some strange special effects to 
hear her talk about music and its magic. 
</p>

<p>I really wonder about these guys sometimes.

<p>The 15 second interview from MTV last night: 
</p>

<p>Here's what Kate said: 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think I have to be careful that I'm not inaccessible totally to people, because 
obviously, when you've made an album you want people to know it's out there, um, 
so that if people want to hear it, they can.&quot;

<p>Here's the interview excerpt from last Thurdsay's Post Modern Show on MTV. 
The words &quot;KATE BUSH ON: SUDDEN FAME&quot; appear on a black background. You 
hear Kate talking. In a couple of seconds, this shot fades and you see Kate against a 
blank wall. She says: 
</p>



<p> &quot;Everything was so different. I had a life that was no longer that. In fact, I was 
really taken away from making music, which was a very hard thing to come to terms 
with. I was spending more of my time doing interviews, promoting, traveling, doing 
televisions, and I started thinking, you know, hang on, I'm doing this instead of 
making music, but what I want to be doing is making music. So I kind of had to take 
a hold of that and reverse the whole situation so that most time is being spent 
creatively, and then the promotional work back that up at a later point.&quot;

<p>Last night on Post Modern MTV, they showed yet another short excerpt from 
their Kate interview. This one was about twenty seconds long. She says: 
</p>

<p>&quot;Although a lot of time went into thinking and writing, um, all the performances 
were very spontaneous and recorded very quickly, which, I think it's nice of people 
to know that because often when you're aware of an album taking a long time you 
think, 'God, they must have spent weeks getting this solo on,' you know. And 
actually it wasn't like that at all. Stuff was recorded very quickly.&quot;

<p>As somebody just posted, they played &quot;The Sensual World&quot; on Post-Modern MTV 
last night. I hope this means they've added it to their rotation. 
</p>

<p>In any case, they showed yet another short interview clip just before the video. 
Kate said: 
</p>



<p>&quot;I've still got a lot of work to do on the album, because I guess, um, there'll 
probably be another couple of singles. And for me that means working on videos, 
which I have to say I do find very exciting creatively. It's fabulous making a record 
and if you have a song that's visually interesting and you can treat it like a small 
film, I find that very exciting.&quot;

<p>They played &quot;The Sensual World&quot; again last night on Post-Modern MTV. Before 
it, they showed yet another tiny interview clip. Kate says: 
</p>



<p>&quot;I find it interesting how they actually are very similar processes, film and music. 
You know, one's audial [?] and one's visual and there are a lot of parallels. I learn 
so much every time I work on a video. So in some ways I think I'm intrigued about 
the idea of making a film of some kind that would incorporate music and. . .&quot; 
</p>



<p>The end of the sentence is obscured by the bells at the opening of the song.
