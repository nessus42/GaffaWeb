<P>Date: Sat, 23 Oct 93 01:42 MET<BR> From: uli@zoodle.robin.de (Ulrich
Grepel) <BR> Subject: Kate Bush live on phone in MTV Most Wanted with Ray Cokes
on October 22, 1993 
</P>
<P>Hi! 
</P>
<P>Tonight Kate was on MTV Europe: MTV Most Wanted with Ray Cokes. Ray  talked
to her over the phone, three videos were shown, the shoe box was shown  (VERY
nice thing!) There even is a set of ballett shoes in there, though smaller than 
baby's feet... The CD was shown. The booklet was shown, it's actually not a book
 but a poster of about 4 times 6 the size of a normal CD booklet. One side has
lyrics  over a BIG bunch of fruits, the other has a big picture of Kate and her
male dancer. 
</P>
<P>Shoebox description: 
</P>
<P>about 30*15*10 cm, high red, the round picture from the album cover on top
of it,  several sheets of paper are in it, one of them with 'New release' as a
big headline  and a lot more of text unreadable on TV/video. The box is laid out
in black and red  and contains the CD and a small version of the big box that's
black and has the  round album picture too. This small box contains a set of red
shoes (probably size 2).  No T-Shirt was in there, but there was plenty of room
for one, so maybe it was  taken out before? 
</P>
<P>[Hounds of Love video is played.] 
</P>
<P>Persons: Ray Cokes, Kate Bush (on phone) and Rob the Cameraman as well as 
other unnamed studio crew] 
</P>
<P>Ray: [playing with a rubber troll squeeeaaaking] Haha-haha! [???] Welcome 
back, that was an old Kate Bush song and in a couple of seconds we're going to
talk  with the new Kate Bush, but before that, quickly, quickly, your faxes are
getting  worse and worse. You do - they do say that you get the audience you
deserve - and I  don't know about you.
</P>
<P> Andy and Caren in Lockhead [sp?], watching in England saying &quot;Just to
let you  know that we have the perfect solution to your hair, or lack of it,
problem.&quot; Thanks  very much, Andy and Caren. [Ray showing a fax] 
</P>
<P> &quot;As of now we are keeping a bag by the side of the bath and once a
week we  will clean out the plug hole and [Rob going ugheeaaahhh...] collect all
the discarded  hair and send it to you to stick on top of your head.&quot;
</P>
<P> [Sounds of dismay around the studio] Thank you, lovely. Okay, no more
-enough  of that now. Still to come more faxes for those who stay tuned. If
you've sent me a  fax I may well read it out if it's funny enough.
</P>
<P> But you know that I've been on phone to you at home. But I don't know all
the  people, but I'm also a friend of the stars. And all I had to do was to look
into my  little black book earlier on today and look under Bush, Kate.
bldpbldpbldpbl... How  many of those do ya know. One! And I found where she is,
because noone can find  Kate for interviews these days - and I've tracked her
down, especially for you.  She's very, very busy at the moment, working on a new
film, and of course the new  album is about to be out, and I hope now that she
can hear me and will be able to  talk to you. Kate and me. Hello Kate. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Hello! 
</P>
<P>Ray: Kate! 
</P>
<P>Kate: Hi! 
</P>
<P>Ray: Is it really you? 
</P>
<P>Kate: It might be! 
</P>
<P>Ray: What's the name of your new album? 
</P>
<P>Kate: The Red Shoes. 
</P>
<P>Ray: How do you sing normally? 
</P>
<P>Kate: I try to sing in tune. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Does that sound like Kate Bush to you? 
</P>
<P>Rob: [not overwhelmed...] Yeah, could be. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Could be. Could be. 
</P>
<P>Rob: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>Ray: We go with it, all right! Good evening, Kate! 
</P>
<P>Kate: Hi! 
</P>
<P>Ray: How are you today? 
</P>
<P>Kate: I'm o.k., thank you. 
</P>
<P>Ray: You're really busy at working at the moment in a sound studio or
something,  aren't you? 
</P>
<P>Kate: That's right. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Now what are you up to? 'Cause we know that the new album which I'm now
 showing to MTV, and you can't see it, can you? - You can't see it, but 
everyone else can. The new album is out soon. Tell us about the album, cause 
it's out on Monday, tell us about it... 
</P>
<P>Kate: Ahh, it is out on the first of November. I think that's the next
Monday, isn't  it? 
</P>
<P>Ray: Yeah, next Monday, yeah, Monday week. [laughing] 
</P>
<P>Rob: It's very sad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ray: Yeah, going well so far, isn't it? I've done my research, Kate! - [Kate
laughing,  Ray laughing] No, I've not. 
</P>
<P>Kate: So I see. 
</P>
<P>Ray: [laughing] Yes, why you know me. O.k. So, tell us about the album. You
got a lot  of very famous people who are sort of popping in to do like Jeff Beck
and Eric  Clapton and Prince on a number and stuff. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yeah! 
</P>
<P>Ray: How do you do that? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, I rang them up and asked them. 
</P>
<P>Ray: That - that simple! 
</P>
<P>Kate: I'm afraid so. 
</P>
<P>Ray: And they said 'yes'! 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yes, they did! 
</P>
<P>Ray: Now also we've seen the Rubberband Man. Oh sorry, Rubberband Man! We've
 seen your latest video, Rubberband Girl, ok? [Kate and Rob lauging] 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Don't worry, I'm, I'm - I'm really good today. I'm on good form, Kate.
[???]  we saw your video, now we're going to see in a few short minutes a new 
version which you've made. 
</P>
<P>Kate: That's right. 
</P>
<P>Ray: So, why did you do - why did you want to make another version of the,
of the  video? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, I was actually asked to do so by America. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>Kate: And - it was quite an interesting experiment just to make more a kind
of  straight forward promo, which only took a day to shoot. So - it was, it was
quite  fun really. 
</P>
<P>Ray: And the new one of course is all split up with bits from the film that
we're  going to see soon... 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yes, that's right. 
</P>
<P>Ray: ... starring, starring Miranda Richardson. Good, I'm getting some stuff
right  now. I'm all right, I'm back on track. Tell us about the film, Kate,
because  you're very closely envolved with everything. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Oh yes! It was, it was an idea that came up when I finished the album,
of  putting some songs together from the album but making a sort of story to a 
film. 
</P>
<P>Ray: mm-hm. 
</P>
<P>Kate: So it's a kind of short film, it's 40 minutes long, and it is really
trying to be a  short film rather than a long video, but I'll be very interested
to see what  people think of it. 
</P>
<P>Ray: What sort of medium is it going to be available on. Do we have to go to
the  cinema to watch it or is it going to be released on video? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, I'm not sure yet. We're hoping to get some showings on
television, but  because it's a short film it doesn't easily sort of fit into a
lot of formats, so I  don't know if we'll be able to get it shown at the cinema.
We've got a  showing at the London Film Festival, but that's the only definite
thing so far. 
</P>
<P>Ray: It's a shame there, isn't it, cause I remember when I was a kid all
those years  ago, every - when you go and see a major film at the cinema they'd
also show  a short film beforehand. 
</P>
<P>Kate: That's right! 
</P>
<P>Ray: Wouldn't it be perfect! Have you enjoyed that? [???] In a lot of your
videos  you've been acting and you've had speaking parts [???] Do you obviously
enjoy  all of that? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yeah, I really enjoy the process of film, I think it's fascinating,
and I've  learned so much through doing this, I mean. I will be very interested
to know  what people think of it, because it's difficult for me to tell being so
close to it  whether, you know, people actually like it. But I've learned so
much, and all  the people involved were so talented, so it's a really great
experience for me. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Now does this mean now that you're getting so involved in film and
trying out  these other mediums that we're gonna have a rarity of seing you on
stage  sometime. 
</P>
<P>Kate: [laughing] Well, I think it is already a bit of a rarity. 
</P>
<P>Ray: It is, it is, Kate, just a bit! 
</P>
<P>Kate: I'm afraid so. [Ray laughing] But I like to think that I would do some
shows  again sometime. I did really enjoy it, but I just got so involved in
making albums,  and things are a sort of more removed from actual live
performance. So I first  when I'm wrapped up in this it's, it's a bit... I just
don't have the energy to  then launch into tours. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Now I can imagine. First of the energy we always see you covorting[?]
around  on stage. Now, the album has taken a bit of time, hasn't it? It's
taken... 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yes 
</P>
<P>Ray: Taken... Why is that? Is that because, you know, you work slowly or
because  you are a perfectionist? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, it's difficult to tell, because actually I write the songs
really quickly, but  then somewhere in the middle it becomes this big evolution
where the tracks  sort of take on their own life really. And it didn't take four
years to make the  album, it probably took about two and a half. I took a long
break in the middle.  But I think that thing it's... hopfeully it's not how long
it takes you know  what it sounds like. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Yes. 
</P>
<P>Kate: I hope. 
</P>
<P>Ray: There's a great vibe on the album, I've been listening to it this
afternoon,  there's a great vibe. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Oh, whew, thank you! 
</P>
<P>Ray: Do you - do you like, did it - a worry for you, you know like because
you've  been around a long time now, you're very well established, you've got a
big  fan base. People like U2 go often feel the need to reinvent themselves.
Have  you've been troubled about that? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, I thought in some ways everytime I start an album I'm trying to
do  something different from the one before, so in some way it is a sort of 
reinvention, I guess. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Now, one thing I [wanna ask???] you is a bit of a trivial thing is
that, when you  open the inner sleeve there are hundreds and thousands of fruits
everywhere.  So what does that mean? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, it's really just a time with a song called Eat The Music which
has a lot of  references to fruits and opening fruits. 
</P>
<P>Ray: O.k. And. What we're gonna do of course, Kate, what I'd like to ask you
now  - terrible, while we're live on air - is that you know it's all very well
talking  to you on the phone, but it'd be much better if we could see you and if
you  could come in and if we could have a nicer, closer chat then, Kate... 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, I'm there in spirit. 
</P>
<P>[laughing around the studio and on the phone...] 
</P>
<P>Ray: Sorry, we... that's why we've got a terrible hang-over sit down here...
That's  why I've been stumbling at the beginning, Kate. Well, will you be coming
in  some time? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, I hope so. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Ok, we hope so too. Well let me go back to your work, and good luck
with the  film. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Thank you. Thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Will look out for that. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>Ray: So you're having the first showing at the London Film Festival in
November? 
</P>
<P>Kate: That's right. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Right, ok. Well we'll look forward to that. Thanks a lot for joining
us, Kate. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, thank you. 
</P>
<P>Ray: And we're showing the new video right now. Would you like to sort of
lead us  into it? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Aahhmmm... Yeah, I'll try... 
</P>
<P>Ray: Ok. It's called Rubberband Girl, remember. 
</P>
<P>Kate: That's right. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Not Rubberband Man [laughter] 
</P>
<P>Kate: No. Ok, well, here you are. Everyone, this is Rubberband Girl. 
</P>
<P>Ray: [??Kate] best. 
</P>
<P>Kate: All the best. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Thanks Kate, 
</P>
<P>Kate: Bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>Ray: Bye. 
</P>
<P>[The OLD version of the Rubberband Girl video is played. 
</P>
<P>Afterwards: BIG MESS in the studio, Ray getting angry, giving a video tape
to  Rob's hand, YELLING out etc, Ray happy about another opportunity to chat
with  Kate... 
</P>
<P>The NEW version of the Rubberband Girl video is played.] 
</P>
<P>Description of the new video: 
</P>
<P>This is much more a promo video than the film excerpt that the earlier video
 was. Kate is wearing sunglasses about half the time, she's dancing a lot, alone
and  together with her male partner, no band can be seen, quite a lot of
solarizing effects  are used, many more locations are filmed than in the first
video, several film  excerpts from The Line, The Cross And The Curve are shown,
together with the  vocal parts of these pieces. 
</P>
<P>I'm not good in describing videos, so I'll give the rest of this task to
someone  else ;-). 
</P>
<P>Bye, Uli
