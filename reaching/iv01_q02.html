Wow! Wow! Wow!<br>
Wow! Wow! Wow!<br>
Unbelievable!<br>

<p><b>Where are you from and what are you on?<br>
</b>I’ve just come from the stage where I’ve picked up my Q Award. I’m not 
eating anything because I’m too excited. I’ve been drinking water. Bottled, 
still water of course. </p>
<p><b>What was the best thing about 2001?</b><br>
Giving up smoking, but I’m not a fanatical anti-smoker. </p>
<p><b>What was the last thing you won?</b><br>
An inflatable hammer a few months ago at a fair. Actually, it wasn’t me who won 
it – it was my son Bertie. I can’t tell you where the fair was because I don’t 
really want to. </p>
<p><b>Who is the best act in the world today?</b><br>
My son Bertie when he’s doing his Elvis impression. Presley or Costello? Er, 
Presley. I think. </p>
<p><b>What's the last record you bought?</b><br>
The Bob The Builder one. Not the Mambo thing, the one before that – whatever it 
is called. Was it for me? Of course it wasn’t. I don’t really keep up with 
things like that. </p>
<p><b>What's next?</b><br>
Well, right now a few of us are going for a little drink somewhere. No, I can’t 
tell you where. More generally, I have to finish off my new album.</p>
