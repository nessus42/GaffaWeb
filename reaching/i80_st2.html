<P>THE EXPLOSIVE KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>by Sebastian Faulks 
</P>
<P>Telegraph Sunday Magazine 
</P>
<P>July 6, 1980 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill] 
</P>
<P>Last year an effusive new pop star stunned audiences. Can she keep it up? 
</P>
<P>In the chilly spring of 1978 school playgrounds up and down the country rang
to  the mournful cry of &quot;Cathy! Heathcliff!&quot; This was not a sudden
surge of O-level  revision: the children were singing the number one pop song -
a strange sensual  dirge originally sung - or, rather, wailed - by a wild-eyed,
tangle-haired girl, herself  a cross between Catherine Earnshaw and Carmen
Miranda. 
</P>
<P>At 19 Kate Bush was hailed by the pop press as the most important pop singer
of  the decade. She combined ethereal and elusive beauty with a seaside postcard
 suggestiveness; her high-pitched voice suggested pathos, humour and drama. 
</P>
<P>She followed the hit single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; with a
best-selling album, The  Kick Inside, and won every available award. The only
doubt was whether she could  perform for an audience; whether she had the
physical stamina, and whether the  songs had enough variation to compensate for
the fact that prolonged exposure to  her voice rendered it less a dramatic wail
than an irritating shriek. 
</P>
<P>After six months preparation Kate Bush set off on tour in January 1979
[actually  this is when the tour preparations really got underway, but the tour
didn't start  until April]. Accompanied by a troupe of dancers, jugglers,
musicians, and engineers  she traveled round the country, arriving at the London
Palladium in April. The Daily  Telegraph reviewer wrote of her show: &quot;It
beggars belief... a stunningly original  stage performance... she has struck the
balance between the vivid and the simple  and it is devastatingly effective... a
dazzling testimony to a remarkable talent.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The show was a new departure in the pop world for the way it incorporated 
elements of dance and circus entertainment, and for its original use of 
specially-designed cordless microphones, which allowed Kate Bush to keep both 
hands free as weaved, danced, and tumbled about the stage. For each song she 
adopted a new persona, aided by lightning costume changes. Male dancers rocked 
her gently as she became a serpentine oriental seductress; motor bikes roared as
she  turned into a strutting leather queen; silence descended as she
metamorphosed into  a lonely waif at the piano; and then she rose up through the
dry ice clouds for  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, a woman wailing for her demon
lover. 
</P>
<P>Now here she sits in the canteen of the Abbey Road Recording Studios, this
tiny  grinning girl whose feet dangle some inches from the ground when she is in
the  studio chair. Her hair, naturally a dark gypsy brown, is currently a
fashionable  bronze-pink. Her face is pixie-ish and when she smiles she has a
dimple - but only  on the left and so high up that it almost looks as though she
is squinting. She is  wearing skin-tight black satin trousers, shaggy boots and
a loose black jumper. She  would look more like 21 were it not for her tiny
childish fingers. 
</P>
<P>For the past three months Kate Bush has been shut in the basement of the 
building recording songs for her autumn-released new album. She says she feels
like  a flower without sun, wilting, but she does not complain much because the
new  record is crucially important to her. There is a slight air of panic in the
studios. Kate  has a unique talent, but there is a feeling that the Palladium
shows displayed every  aspect of it to the greatest possible extent. She has to
try to find a way of  transcending the limitations of her voice and it's wearing
qualities. 
</P>
<P>She herself scorns such suggestions. [AT LAST, KATE SPEAKS!] &quot;People
said I  couldn't gig and I proved them wrong. I'll just have to prove them wrong
again. you  see, the new album represents a new direction for me; it's where I'm
at now, not  last year. I'll just keep on creating, keep on performing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But there are, in fact, no plans for another tour. &quot;Maybe next year...
I need five  months to prepare a show and build up my strength for it, and in
those five months I  can't be writing new songs and i can't be promoting the
album. The problem is  time... and money.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The later was a difficulty she sidestepped by putting a considerable amount
of her  own money into the last tour. The practice of artists investing in their
own shows is  becoming more widespread as costs rise, but Kate Bush's show was
so expensive  that even with her contribution EMI were still paying more than
they would for  most artists. Being famous &quot;gives me the money to do the
things I want to do,&quot; she  says. &quot;Otherwise, I just couldn't afford
them. But fame isn't my ambition, I want to  carry on learning, getting more
information, creating and realising ideas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Information is a key work for Kate Bush. She is like magic, fastening on to 
glittering slabs of knowledge and half-glimpsed images - a dip into the books of
 Gurdjieff, the Caucasian mystic, a clutch of old films, a fashion magazine, a
science  textbook, an overheard conversation. &quot;All artists are thieves. You
eat what you steal,  digest it and it becomes a part of you. You never just
copy, of course.&quot; This mad  eclecticism is what made her stage shows
intriguing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have to keep an eye on her, you know,&quot; says Kate Bush, glancing
over her  shoulder. &quot;I mustn't let her get out of hand.&quot; She looks
down. &quot;Sometimes, it's  funny, I feel sort of... inferior to her, you know,
and I can feel myself starting to  behave like her in real life.&quot; She is
talking, it turns out, about her stage self. &quot;It's  frightening,&quot; she
adds. And then: &quot;you've got to behave appropriately for the  situation
whether you find yourself in a social situation... I just want to be a human 
being, you know; I'm a human being first and foremost.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This is a not untypical slice of Kate Bush conversation. A great deal of
what she  says is pure rock cliche', but it is illuminated from time to time by
oblique and  original comments. All are delivered with equal charm and
sincerity, with an edge of  surprise always cracking the almost consonatless
London accent. 
</P>
<P>Catherine Bush - known as Cathy when she was small -- was born in 1958,
which  means she was too late to catch the Beatles. Her father is a Surrey
Doctor. Her  mother comes from County Waterford and it is from her that Kate
inherited her  feel for dance: Mrs. Bush was an accomplished folk dancer in
Ireland, though only  for fun and in amateur competitions. She was brought up in
a comfortable home in  Bexleyheath with two older brothers, John and Paddy. Both
were fanatical about folk  music and Kate listened endlessly to their folk
records, sea shanties and Irish jigs. 
</P>
<P>She also liked hymns and took violin lessons at school. There was an old
organ in  the barn on which she used to tinker until one day her father showed
her middle C  on the piano in the living room. And then, in her own words, &quot;Wow!&quot;

</P>
<P>School bored her and though she had some good friends she preferred to lock 
herself away in her room. &quot;I worked out this dance and mime to The Beatles'
 Eleanor Rigby. I just lived in the world of the song for days and days, dancing
it,  getting it right.&quot; Meanwhile she also listened to Billie Holiday, Judy
Garland, Gene  Kelly and a new group just appearing on the British scene, King
Crimson. ANd then  she started writing her own songs, &quot;mostly about myths,
spirits, that kind of thing;  not fairies... stronger than that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What happened next was like something from a fairy story. When she was 14
she  made a tape of her songs and, via a friend of a friend, it found its way to
David  Gilmour, guitarist from the Pink Floyd group, Gilmour, who has a
reputation for  helping new talent, paid to have proper recordings made and
played them to EMI,  who signed her up at once. She was to start recording for
them when she was a little  older, &quot;when I felt ready to handle the
situation.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So Kate - as she was by now - left St. Joseph's School, Abbey Wood, with 
armfuls of O-levels, a recording contract and a windfall legacy from her aunt
tucked  away in the bank. 
</P>
<P>The next step in her education was to study with the mime and dance artist 
Lindsay Kemp, of whom she speaks in tones of awe and gratitude. &quot;the first
time I  saw him it was like a whole new world opened up for me. He did more than
I'd  ever seen done on the stage before and he never opened his mouth!&quot; 
</P>
<P>She has worked hard at her dancing and is lucky enough to have long legs,
which  give a sinuous elegance to some of her less orthodox movements. She
smokes and  stays up late, though she has been a vegetarian for the last five
years - which, she  says, makes her feel much better in body and mind. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was brought up a Roman Catholic, but &quot;it never touched my
heart.&quot;  She now professes to a vague humanistic belief in the central
premise of most  religions - that we should be kind to other people. 
</P>
<P>She is a curious mixture of naivete' and sophistication. Her avowed aim is
to lay  herself open to as many influences as possible - to go on gathering
information and  &quot;carry on learning.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What she has yet to do is learn how to be selective - to filter the various
stimuli  so that she can see what is useful and what is dross. Her
second-single, &quot;The Man  With The Child In His Eyes&quot;, was a touching
and subtle song about the different  ways in which the ageing process effects
men and women [huh?], which she wrote  when she was just 13. Yet her latest
single, &quot;Breathing&quot; is about the environment  [actually it's about
nuclear war] - that corniest of all rock standbys [moron] - and  sounds far more
like the work of a teenager. [Dipshit] 
</P>
<P>Time is short and the pop public is fickle [the corniest of all rock
standbys]. If  the new album is a flop and there is no tour in prospect, Kate
Bush has only the  frequent impersonation of her on televisions (for which she
is very grateful) to keep  her in the public consciousness. She does not seem
worried. &quot;I'll just carry on  performing. It's the only thing I know how to
do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She is very young to be facing such a watershed in her life, but luckily she
has  the resilience of youth as well as its vulnerability. In the long term she
would like to  have children, but it would be unfair to them, she says, to think
about that just yet. 
</P>
<P>She lives in a plant-filled flat in a 19th century house in one of the
quieter streets  of Lewisham, southeast London. She and her brothers each have a
floor. &quot;A very  ordinary flat,&quot; she calls it, &quot;though I like it
because it's got all my things in it. It's just  far enough out to be nice and
quiet. I'd like to live in the country really but the  flat's best for the
moment, while I'm working in London, because I can't drive, you  see.&quot;
[Kate does have a license, which she got after a failed attempt.] 
</P>
<P>She is understandably reticent about her private life. When she is not
working  she says she likes to sleep. &quot;then I like to catch up on things -
go and see my parents,  go and see friends. And I like to catch up on all the
films I've missed and I just like  watching telly.&quot; She is also a keen
cook. She makes her own bread an any number of  vegetarian dishes - &quot;Being
a vegetarian makes it that much more of a challenge.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As for boyfriends, she says, &quot;yes, sure I have one; I have lots of
boyfriends, you  know, I really like people.&quot; <!-- what a liar!!! :-) -->
</P>
<P>Simon Drake, a musician who worked on her shows [close, he was a magician], 
once said: &quot;There are more young men in love with Kate Bush than any other 
performer.&quot; Her reaction to this is: &quot;An incredible compliment! I love
it when people  say I'm attractive, because I don't really see it myself - I
don't think I'm beautiful.  But it's the nicest thing you could say!&quot; 
</P>
<P>And there is no false modesty of disingenuousness in that remark. It is odd
that  Kate Bush made her name as a performer because the audience never knew
what  character she would appear to be next; yet she is so irresistible as a
person because  she is quite guileless.
