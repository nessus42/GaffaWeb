<P>Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon (Thorn EMI, 52 min.) was recorded back
in May, 1979 and has been sold in the UK for two years. One wonders what held up
its US release so long, but since Bush has yet to perform (except on TV) in
America, a 4 1/2-year-old videotape is better than  nothing. The multi-talented
Bush comes off as an  agreeable English dance-hall version of <CITE>Taxi's</CITE>
Simka; it helps if you like high soprano singing. Maybe  this will help get her
career off the ground here.</P>

<P>VIDEO HEIGHTS <BR> Review of The Single File <BR> From Melody Maker 1984 
</P>
<P>Reprinted in Breakthough 4 
</P>
<P>by Steve Sutherland 
</P>
<P>&quot;Like making a film of a book,&quot; Kate Bush is wary of the video
process. She  knows it can intrude on the listener imagination and she's acutely
aware that the  video is the song compromised,&quot; that when she's writing the
songs, she's in &quot;the  actual place&quot; whereas, when she's filming, much
mystery could be sacrificed to the  concrete image. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Single File&quot;, a collection of her 12 promo videos, not only
shames any  negligent impressions of Kate as some Lena Zavaroni figure, pampered
and sold  cheaply by her record company, but also illustrates, perhaps for the
first time, an  artist defeating the deadening video process, using visuals to
further rather then  wrap-up the scope of her songs. 
</P>
<P>Her earliest effort, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, was simplicity itself.
Inspired  choreographically by her favourite ballets and enhanced by some trick
afterimage  photography, it was supposed to convey &quot;a feeling of the person
being a spiritual  presence,&quot; and Kate turned in a performance that
flattered the book, served the  song and projected her personality. A star was
born. 
</P>
<P>The follow-up single, &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;, proved
more of a  problem. Kate's songs are, by nature, introverted and, as singles
were seldom chosen  with visual presentation in mind, the task was to preserve
the song's delicate  confessional while simultaneously trying to sell it. She
settle on softfocus: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The lighting guy did a complete try on that one. It was really
extraordinary. I  was sitting on Perspex that had banks of lights under it, like
frying on an oven. I was  so hot! BUt it got that feeling of great lightness,
like floating without any sense of  weight at all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>By comparison, the possibilities presented by &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; were
boundless.  The title itself suggested all manner of gory excess but Kate,
mindful that the look  on the victim's face linger longer in the memory than the
mechanics of the murder,  plumped for character over effects. Involving another
dancer for the first time, she  acted out an intriguing ritual of love and hate,
she Ophelia-made often the aggressor,  he the hooded executioner bound almost
blamelessly to his task. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Songs have very specific moods and personalities and I feel very
limited in as  much as I'm always, to a certain extent, me,&quot; she explains. &quot;I'm
never sure if I'm  able to create the character in the song. I really rely on my
instincts because I don't  feel I can act. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't feel that making videos is acting because I've written the
songs and  created the characters in my mind. It's the subject matter, not the
personalities that  moves me. Like &quot;Wow&quot;, though it could apply to any
kind of art and the character is  an actor, it's really talking about the music
business where a lot of things are really  unpleasant, but the incredible thing
about it is the music and how it's worth all the  effort, all the rubbish, to
get that bit of gold.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Whatever her reservations, &quot;Wow&quot; was a success, again through its
simplicity.  Alone on a stage, she expresses all the song's loathing and
compassion simply by  staling looks into the lens, whereas the video for &quot;Them
Heavy People&quot;  uncharacteristically surrendered the song's examination of
mental turmoil to a corny  slapstick gangster routine. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We liked the idea of beating each other up and enjoying it,&quot; she
confesses. As  always the video was a self aware &quot;performance&quot; but it
was her last &quot;fun one&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Out of nowhere, &quot;Breathing&quot; introduced new possibilities,
demonstrating that a  video needn't be a promotional afterthought; on the
contrary, it could do a great  service existing alongside its companion song,
adding another interpretation rather  than mugging it up. From now on, nothing
would get into a kate Bush video without  some symbolic interest. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ever since 'Breathing' I've wanted to make videos like little films,&quot;
she admits,  and with the added dimension of dance, her songs took on several
simultaneous lives. 
</P>
<P>Discounting [!!!!] &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; which was thrown together
and &quot;There  Goes A Tenner&quot;, which clumsily [!!!] attempted to follow a
plot, the remainder of  The Single File is a treasurehouse. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Breathing&quot; is split in two, the baby in the womb being born into
a future nuclear  age, screaming &quot;Leave me something to breath!&quot; while
an atom bomb explodes in  reverse, &quot;just to try and say 'No, don't let it
happen', which is a positive statement, I  hope...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, her favourite (&quot;I got everything I wanted to
say across&quot;) deals  emotionally with wasted life through a mother-son
relationship and still managed to  comment, though Busby Berkeley routines, on
the media's presentation of war,  while &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; ushers in a
whole roster of dunces and jesters in an attempt  to articulate visually the
songs contrary reactions to knowledge. It fails but superbly. 
</P>
<P>Having something to say inevitably harmed Kate's commercial appeal. Her
songs  grew so swollen with import that the tunes could barely cope while the
videos  became increasingly alluring, climaxing in &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
where a straightforward  protest against pink creatures&quot;) [sic?] breeds in
a aboriginal atmosphere (Their  music is so incredibly full of space and
loneliness&quot;) and blossoms into a full-blown  mime of man's folly. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The big wind rushing in at the end is the idea of the white man on his
way in to  steal the aborigines' soul and plunder their hills for plutonium.
It's involved with  time travel. The doves released express the freedom of
something that could have  been caught or killed but has been given the chance.
I suppose that was a little  glimpse of hope, otherwise...&quot; 
</P>
<P>And then, of course, there's &quot;Babooshka&quot;, perhaps her most famous
promo,  perfectly illustrative of her technique. The plot, inspired by the
strange pactise of  Victorian wives trying to catch out their husbands by
sending them love letters  under assumed names, could have been treated
straight, much in the same way that  Heaven 17 presented &quot;Come Live With Me&quot;.
But that wasn't the point. 
</P>
<P>The plot may have been central to the song but it's the woman - why she does
it  and how she feels now she's trapped herself into jealousy - that's the meat
of the  video. 
</P>
<P>Thus &quot;Babooshka&quot; exists in two forms - the story on the record and
the study on  video, a duality approaching self-critique. No other video I can
recall has attained  comparable dramatic completion.

</P>
<P>Headline : Kates Haunting theme. 
</P>
<P> SPOOKY singer Kate Bushs video team have been upset by a ghost. They had an
 eerie time in their four days of filming at the White Horse Hill beauty spot in
 Oxfordshire. 
</P>
<P>A local said yesterday : &quot;They found it very disturing. They said they
felt there  was someone watching them all the time - but there was no one there.&quot;
The hill is  near Waylands Smithy where, according to legend, a ghostly
blacksmith waits to shoe  the horses of travellers. 
</P>
<P>The seven-minute video is for Kates new single Cloudbusting, which has just 
entered the charts. She plays 12-year-old Peter Reich, from whose Book of Dreams
 she drew the idea for the song.
