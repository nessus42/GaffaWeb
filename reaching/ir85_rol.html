<P>Date: Fri, 17 Aug 90 12:39:15 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Rock over London, Dec. 1985 
</P>
<P>I just got a whole bunch of Rock Over London shows in the mail today, from
late  1985 and early 1986. I don't mean bootlegs -- I mean the actual LPs that
went to the  radio stations who broadcast this show. I already had one from
August of 1985 when  RUTH was played for the first time -- the host, Graham
Dene, seemed very excited  about it. 
</P>
<P>At the end of December 1985 they played a countdown of the top 20 albums of 
that year. Hounds Of Love was number 17. 
</P>
<P>Here's the big thing: at the beginning of that month they broadcast an 
INTERVIEW with Kate! Although she doesn't say anything we haven't heard 
hundreds of times, and it's only four minutes long, the interview is one that I,
at  least, hadn't heard before. Here it is: 
</P>
<P>D: Graham Dene, the host of ROL. 
</P>
<P>C: Paul Cooke, the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>K: Kate. 
</P>
<P>D: You might like to know that in three weeks time on Rock Over London
you'll be  able to hear our review of the British rock year, and the
re-emergence of Kate  Bush will have to go down as one of the comebacks of '85,
with her album  Hounds Of Love and two hits: &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;
and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. Well,  Kate's been chatting with Paul Cooke, who
first asked her about the concept  behind Hounds Of Love. 
</P>
<P>K: It's, uh, two separate pieces for me really, the A and the B side. The A
side is  five individual songs, perhaps linked by the theme of love, but very
much  individual songs for me. And the second side is a concept -- seven songs
that are  linked together, and it's very much one story, about someone who's in
the water  for the night, and how they manage to cope with the situation until
morning. 
</P>
<P>C: You call the second side &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; and you quote
Tennyson. Why? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, rather than it being inspired by Tennyson as a lot of people have
presumed,  it was completely the other way around, in that I was looking for a
title for the  piece, and there was no line from the songs that was -- no title
that was really  right for the whole side, so I started looking through books
for quotes, et cetera,  and just found this quote from the ninth wave, by --
about the ninth wave that  seemed so parallel -- the idea of waves moving in
cycles of nine so that it all  builds up to the ninth and then begins again. So,
it was used as the title. 
</P>
<P>C: You're considering making a film about it. Could you tell us about that? 
</P>
<P>K: It's what I'd like to do next, is the major project if I could. And, it
is really just  talk at the moment, and I won't know, I suppose, until next year
if that is going  to be a feasible thing or not. But I would love to do that
next. 
</P>
<P>C: Do you find that a lot of people don't quite understand your work, maybe
think  it's a little bit mystical? 
</P>
<P>K: I think there's a lot of people who don't understand necessarily what I'd
 originally conceived as the idea, but I don't know if that's very important. I 
think if people feel they understand it on any level, then I've achieved
something  and that's great. 
</P>
<P>C: Could you explain a couple of your songs? First of all, &quot;Running Up
That Hill&quot;.  What's that about? 
</P>
<P>K: It's about two people who are very in love, and it's about the power of
the love  and how that can get in the way sometimes, and how if they could swap
places --  if the man could become the woman and the woman the man that perhaps
in  areas they'd understand each other better and there would be less problems 
between them. 
</P>
<P>C: The other song I'd like to know about is &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, that was very much inspired by a book by a man called Peter Reich,
and the  book's called A Book Of Dreams. And it's about a very magical
relationship  between himself when he was a child and his father. And it's all
written through  a young boy's point of view, and it's so innocent and sad, and
it was just the  inspiration for the song. 
</P>
<P>C: Now, what about doing some live dates? I mean, a lot of people would love
to see  you again. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I really would like to, and I've been saying this for so long, and
it's just a  matter of when it's the right time. Obviously, if I can go ahead
with &quot;The Ninth  Wave&quot; as the next project, then I don't think there
would be time for a tour. But  if that's not feasible, then who knows? So
there's a possibility. 
</P>
<P>C: What about going to America? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, that's a very strong possibility. I've only been there a couple of
times, and  that was a long while ago now but, yes, I would very much like to go
to New  York. 
</P>
<P>C: Well, thank you very much for coming to see us, and all the best with
things. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>D: Kate Bush, chatting with Paul Cooke, and let's hope that feature film
comes off. 
</P>
<P>As we all know, it didn't, and neither did a tour.
