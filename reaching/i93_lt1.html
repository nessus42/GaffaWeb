Subject: New Kate Interview, Sunday Times Sept. 1993 
</P>
<P>There was an interview with Kate in yesterdays' Sunday Times colour 
supplement. It was something of a hatchet job on behalf of the interviewer who 
seemed to get the impression that Kate was a really tough person to interview.
To  be honest if the article is accurate then I have some sympathy with the
interviewer. 
</P>
<P>As normal Kate declined to talk about anything other than her music but also
 restricted the interviewer to hearing just 5 tracks off the album, showed her a
lyric  sheet for the album but refused to let her take it away, and would not
show her any  of the promo film. 
</P>
<P>During the interview (again if the text is accurate) Kate did seem to be
more  than usually obstinate in her refusal to discuss things. The article did
suggest that  she has broken up with Del though Kate did not say so during the
interview. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, I have left the article at home so cannot type it in but I
expect  someone else will do it. If not I can do so later.

</P>
<P>Chrissie Iley's &quot;interview&quot; with Kate in the London Sunday Times
Colour  Supplement is transparently a feeble attempt by a silly, jealous woman
to malign her  betters. Virtually the entire article concerns Iley's
befuddlement and resentment at  Kate's unwillingness to divulge personal
information to her interviewer. Needless to  say, it never occurs to Iley to ask
even a single question about the subject of real  interest both to Kate and to
her true fans, i.e. the music! Despite the comments of  Iley, the piece is worth
reading for the subject's intelligent and impressively tolerant  responses, and
for a glamorous full-page color portrait by a Times photographer.

nbc@inf.rl.ac.uk (Neil Calton) <BR> Subject: Kate Bush Article in Sunday Times
Sept. 12th 1993 
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center">The Sunday Times, September 12th 1993 </H2>
<P>Kate Bush likes to get her own way. She has done ever since her pop
rendition of  Wuthering Heights turned her into a teenage star 15 years ago. She
is still only little,  but mighty corporations tremble at the stamp of her tiny
foot. Chrissy Iley reports on  a mauling at the hands of the Bush baby. Portrait
by Anthony Crickmay. 
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center">BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH </H2>
<P>Kate Bush, shy megalomaniac. She shrugs a girlie shrug. Smirks. Oh, yes,
yes, she  likes that description of herself. Its aptness tickles her. She's big
on paradox. Thinks  that most people are extreme contradictions. Personally,
I've always thought shy was  another name for awkward, and megalomaniac just
meant spoilt. Certainly, exposure  to her special blend of diffidence, wariness
and clenched control is extraordinarily  wearying. 
</P>
<P>We'll do control first. Ever since she was a teenager, bigwigs at EMI
records  have scurried to the stomp of her tiny foot. It is a sensible little
foot clad in Chinese  slippers: she doesn't believe in uncomfortable shoes.
She's no fashion victim, no  anything victim. 
</P>
<P>In the late 1970s when she was spinning around Lindsey Kemp style and
hollering  &quot;Cathee come home ...&quot; the hair was as plum-coloured as it
is today and her way of  getting what she wants is similarly undiluted. Bob
Mercer was then the managing  director of EMI; now he runs a record label in
Nashville. He has remained friends  with Kate over the years. She calls him
whenever she has a dream about him. He  was given a tape of her songs by Pink
Floyd's Dave Gilmour when she was about 15.  Mercer sent her off for piano
lessons and encouraged her to do her O-levels. 
</P>
<P>Four years later she came back with a completed album. Mercer recalls, &quot;Kate
 came to see me. She was unhappy at my choice of James and the Cold Gun for the 
first single. She said she really felt it had to be Wuthering Heights. I told
her it was  her job to write the songs and my job to market them and we should
stick to what  we were best at. I felt that if she experienced failure at such a
young age she might  not be able to handle it. I told her not to worry, hers
wouldn't be a commercial  success straight away. It would take at least three
albums and she should be patient. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In those days I was a very busy man. I had to contend with the Sex
Pistols fiasco  and I didn't expect her to behave like this. I was getting angry
and fuck me if she  didn't burst into tears. My leverage was gone, so I said all
right, but when this hits  the wall it will teach you a lesson not to interfere.
It went to number one and stayed  there four weeks. To her credit she has never
reminded me of the incident and after  that I always had respect for her
instincts. It was in the days when artists didn't  have much control over their
contracts. But she changed all that. EMI always had to  listen to her&quot; 
</P>
<P>Over the years eight albums have plopped out, each one taking longer to
produce.  When they do come they are a blend of accessible pop sensibility and
quaking pain.  Her image has always been of this intense quivering thing
plumbing her depths to  deliver what is most sad. Yet her life can hardly be
described as tragic. She's  doctor's daughter Kate, safe, cosseted from the
world. That's the way she grew up  and that's the way she still is. 
</P>
<P>Me and the Bush baby have met to talk about her new album, out next month, 
called The Red Shoes. A dilemma: she doesn't really want to talk about anything 
but her music and I am not allowed to have the album to listen to. I was granted
five  tracks, but not to take home with me, only to listen to in the Abbey Road
studios. I  was also given a printed lyric sheet, but then like an exam paper
had to hand it in at  the end. &quot;I haven't found anyone who can take in the
album all in one session,&quot; she  said. Lighten up Kate. It's supposed to be
a pop record. 
</P>
<P>She's made a film to accompany the album but goes tense when you ask her 
what it's about. We know it has got Miranda Richardson in it, and Lindsey Kemp. 
And she squeaks in her pithy high-pitched voice: &quot;Well, it's something like
Magical  Mystery Tour but it's not like that at all. It's not finished yet and I
hate talking  about anything until it's there. It's like talking to you about
the album if you  haven't heard the tracks. Completely ridiculous.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We are sitting side by side in a little preview theatre looking at a blank
screen  because she can't show me the movie, nor any part of the movie, because
I might  make a judgement, God forbid. 
</P>
<P>As the seats are cinema seats, it's difficult to swivel round to look her in
the eye  and it's perfect for her to avoid being looked at. She stays quite
still and stares  straight ahead. I'm fidgeting and feeling like a cheap
perfume. Her diminutiveness  hads the effect of making you feel huge and clumsy
and gruff. 
</P>
<P>The sweetness of her elfin face and tiny, tiny voice are curdled with
something;  the bobbly eyes seem to belong to a very old person. The smile comes
zipped on  with her lips pressed so tightly together that there is a constant  &quot;Mmmmmmmmmmmm&quot;.
The edges of the smile are tacked in place with invisible  threads that move up
and down, up and down. Before I met Kate Bush, I liked the  record. It is
probably a very good record. certainly, one track, Moments of Pleasure,  is
compellingly sad and makes people cry for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>So, Kate, what was going on in your head when you were writing it&quot; &quot;Er,
it's just  a very personal song. [This was the first of many 'It's personal'
responses] It's to  show just how precious life is and all those little moments
that people give you. And  that's how people stay alive, through your memories
of them.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It has been a gruelling three years for Bush. She's a strong person but
sometimes  things have been so bad that &quot;I couldn't even work. Singing is
such a deeply  personal thing to do, I couldn't manage it.&quot; She has &quot;lost&quot;
a lot of friends; her  relationship with her boyfriend Del Palmer, who was her
bass player of 10 year's  standing, evaporated; and her mother died. She was
close to her mother. &quot;She got ill  and she died.&quot; No details given.
But when she was alive and well she was full of old  Irish sayings such as &quot;every
old sock meets and old shoe&quot;. &quot;Isn't that a beautiful little  saying?&quot;
I ask if it means the same as &quot;we seek the teeth that made the wounds&quot;.
 She looks blank. You know, pain seeking pain. &quot;Oh, it's so cute, isn't it?
So cute.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This was my first inkling that Bush, for all her swelling emotions, might be
a little  one-dimensional. Mercer told me that she's a poet and sometimes poets
have a  tendency to say things without really knowing what they mean. &quot;Like
when she  wrote the song Man With The Child In His Eyes. Does she mean that he
was  looking at a child, that he looked like a child, or he wanted to procreate?
I always  wondered who that father figure was: was it a brother, was it her
father or was it an  older man she had a relationship with when she was very
young?&quot; 
</P>
<P>She is close to all her family, her older brothers Paddy and Jay and her
father  particularly. The father figure has featured in much of her work. Dr
Bush himself  even speaks on an old song of hers, The Fog. He was teaching her
to swim. The  crying to get what she wants, the little girl's body, the little
girl's wilful mind, have  all the hallmarks of daddy's girl. So what kind of
doctor is he? &quot;That's a personal  question. It's not really about my work.&quot;
Yes but he features in your work. &quot;It's not  something that I really want
to talk about.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When she first started to write songs she didn't tell boys because she
thought it  would be a threat to their masculinity. She has devised a concept of
masculine and  feminine energy. In Running Up That Hill from her multi-platinum
selling album  Hounds of Love, she said she would like to make a deal with God.
&quot;I wanted to be a  man in a woman's body. I thought it would be completely
astounding, so that we  could completely understand each other. Because in
essence we are so different. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is a feminine energy and there is a masculine energy. Some women
have  very masculine energies, and the creativity of a lot of women is masculine
driven  because they are ambitious to speed forward.&quot; She says she is not
ambitious - not for  money, not for material things -but she is driven by that
great creative force to  produce her work. &quot;It is the feminine energies
which are very sepcial and they have  been a little neglected. [Early in her
career everyone was discussing how her nipples  poked erect from an early poster
of her in a leotard: &quot;I was flattered and it did help  me to establish my
music. I could never say it annoyed me.&quot;] I can understand why  in many
situations women have found the need to become masculine. A lot of my  friends
feel the feminist movement set women back a long way. Man-hating is  wrong but
many women are ashamed that they can't just be a woman. I think  idealy people
can be quite androgynous. That can be exciting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She has got a new song about bananas and papayas and putting things in
mouths  and putting her hands into pomegranites. &quot;All is revealed/Not only
women bleed.&quot;  That, she explains, is not sexual, it's about how beautiful
men can be on the inside.  &quot;I think proper opposites are very exciting. How
could you possibly experience pain  until you knew what laughter was?&quot; 
</P>
<P>She then goes into a discourse about why the song Life Is Sad And So Is Love
is  incredibly positive, and I'm afraid she lost me. I cannot tell whether she
is being  obtuse on purpose but suspect that she is trying to avoid the
questions about men  which she senses are coming. There have been so many
wincingly intimate songs  about relationships, I wonder who has been her muse. &quot;That's
for me to know and  you to find out. I don't really see what that question has
to do with my work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, as she's already said, her life is her work; I'm merely inquiring
which bit if  her life has inspired which bit of work. &quot;I think that's
personal and I'm here to  talk about my work. My private life I don't want to
let go of. I need to keep it close  and tender so that is is still my own.&quot;
And she's smiling an assassin's smile. 
</P>
<P>I try to manoeuvre by pointing out that it is difficult to know where to
draw the  boundaries when the songs are so personal and she shrugs that little
girl shrug.  &quot;Well, I'm telling you.&quot; She is unsettingly polite. If
she had been angry with me  there would have been at least a confrontation, a
connection. 
</P>
<P>Bush baby doesn't care if there is no connection. She doesn't care if I like
her or  not. Mercer says that &quot;even in the early days, all she wanted was
to create. Her work  is her only therapy. Her psyche is not about promoting her
personality. Usuallly in  this business the artists have an agenda: they want to
make you love them, they want  to project their personality and that's what
drives them. And to do that they need to  expose themselves. She feels that she
has worked herself so hard and exposed  herself in her work so much, it is hard
to give any more. She's written about the last  affair she had, or didn't have,
that broke her heart. Of course she is scared to talk  more about it. She seems
to be interested only in warming to other artists. She feels  press people have
their own agenda.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She has an acute suspiscion of journalists. She usually brings her own tape 
recorder to interviews to check if she has been misquoted. On the other hand,
she  does have a schoolgirlie enthusiasm for other &quot;artists&quot;. She's
got great cred: she's  worked with the best, Eric Clapton and Prince. Price, who
appears on one song on  the new record, is a fellow recluse. They never actually
talked to each other, they  simply exchanged tapes. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think creative control is so incredibly important,&quot; she says. &quot;If
you don't have  that control your work will be interfered with until it's gone
out of your hands. I  was always aware that things wouldn't be how I wanted them
unless I was willing  to fight. You have to fight for everything you want.
Struggle is important. It's how  you grow and how you change. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always been tenacious when it comes to my work and I became
quickly  aware of the outside pressures of being famous affecting my work. It
seemed ironic  that I was expected to do interviews and television which took me
away from the  thing that had put me in that situation. It was no longer
relevant that I wrote songs. I  could see my work becoming something that had no
thought in it, becoming a  personality, which is never what I wanted. All I
wanted was the creative process.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She uses the phrase &quot;my work&quot; as if she's talking about some other
person very  close to her of whom she is the guardian. She is in her
mid-thirties and won't  comment about any biological urges to reproduce. Perhaps
her albums are her  children. She flashes me a zipped smile. &quot;No. Can you
imagine a child which took  three-and-a-half years to come out?&quot; 
</P>
<P>I remind her that she has been quoted as saying she is as tough as nails. &quot;Ah,
yes.&quot;  She squints, the brows knitting together under the short fringe. &quot;The
journalist  made that up. Also in the same piece [four years ago] she said I
said I was as fragile  as a butterfly. People impose their own personalities on
me. I'm surprised you don't  know that.&quot; And she looks at me with those
cold limpid eyes. &quot;I'm strong but I'm  not as tough as nails. The two are
very different. Quite often people project their  whole life on you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She is so full of contempt that communication is almost impossible. Is it
just me  that she doesn't like to reveal things to? &quot;It's quite dangerous
to go through life  extremely open. In a way you need an element of trust. For
some people it's just  very hard. Fear is such an enormous thing in all of us
and I think it stops a lot of  rather nice processes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Mercer believes that Bush has &quot;matured enormously, but she's become
more  introspective, more true to her art. There was a point where it could have
happened  the other way, where she could have become more of a personality.
Instead she dug  deeper into herself. She is a sadder, wiser person. It has been
an exhausting process. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's so strange to imagine she must be 35. I'll always see her as that
little girl  who's 15. She is the sweetest, a mensch. You don't either hate her
or love her. You  love her or you don't know her. Getting to know her is
difficult.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Still trying to discover that sad place from which these sad songs have
sprung, I  try her childhood. What sort of things moved her then? I'm hoping
there'll be an  anecdote about her father, her brothers, her mother, her
grandparents. But no. &quot;I  was always impressed by the sea, I think it's
completely stunning. I'd love to be part  of the sea. Wonderful.&quot; I can't
even swim I tell her. I feel as though I'm drowning.  I persist and she tells
me, &quot;It's been a difficult three years for everybody. The  recession has
affected everybody so badly ..&quot; 
</P>
<P>We are both exhausted from the experience, with my wrangling and her not 
letting go. She stands up to show me out. She's truly tiny, but not just in
height. I see  her as a bonsai person. Everything that should be is perfectly
developed but in  miniature: her emotional range is intense, stunted, trapped.
Although she insists she  is more happy than sad, I have not found her sense of
humour to justify this. I have  not found her. 
</P>
<P>A few days after the interview I met an early biographer of hers, Paul
Kerton,  and he understood my problem. He recalled, &quot;I sent an asistant to
get her birth  certificate. She came back saying, &quot;Bad news: she was born a
man called Martin.' I  sighed, and then she said, 'April Fool, April Fool'. But
she's so mysterious and  androgynous it would not have surprised me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Perhaps we can get an insight from a poem he sent me written by Catherine 
Bush, Form 2 (1970-71). It later became a song, and here it is. &quot;I have
seen him/I have  noted him seven times or more/but he has not seen me/He may
have seen a girl  called by my name/But neither he nor anyone else will ever
really see me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There is one colour photo of Kate lying on her back on a white rectangular
block  with her hair falling over the edge of the block. It is shot from above.
