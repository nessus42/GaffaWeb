</P>
<P>First, for those who have missed it, the MuchMusic Kate Special wasn't
special.  Only about 10 min. of *NEW* interview were shown. Major rehashing of
old footage.  But an interesting segment was Del being interviewed. Clean shaven
and with short  hair, he looks like a different person from the photo I have of
him taken by Ron Hill  at the last KonvenTion. 
</P>
<P>Here's the Toronto Star interview, Dec 14, 1993.

<H2 ALIGN="center">SINGER'S SINGER KATE BUSH MAKES A RARE APPEARANCE </H2>
<P>by Peter Howell, Pop Critic 
</P>
<P>Call Kate Bush a recluse, and she's got two words for you: &quot;ethereal&quot;
and &quot;nutty&quot;. 
</P>
<P>They're the two other words of the three most often used to describe the 
winsome English pop archetype, and Bush rhymed them off herself yesterday while 
making an exceedingly rare visit to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>Oh, the 35-year-old singer-songwriter understands why people have these &quot;very
 natural presumptions&quot; about her, since she appears in public about as
often as  Halley's Comet and weaves a tight sonic tapestry with her music, using
literary  strands of Tennyson, Bronte, Joyce and the Bible. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not important to me that people understand me&quot;, says the
very English, very  charming Bush, in town to talk about both a new album, The
Red Shoes, and a new  short film, The Line, The Cross And The Curve. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's my work that goes out, and I feel that's what speaks for me. In a
lot of  ways, I'm very happy for the work to do all the talking, because I feel
if I didn't  make music, people wouldn't be interested in me, anyways. It's the
music that says  it; it says it eloquently enough &quot; 
</P>
<P>It speaks loudly. Ask almost any current female singer-songwriter where she
got  her musical inspiration, and the name Kate Bush is mentioned almost as
often as that  of Joni Mitchell. Canadians have been particularly smitten: Jane
Siberry, Sarah  McLachlan, Rebecca Jenkins, Loreena McKennitt, Shirley Eckhard
and more --all  have fallen under the spell of this four-octave dream weaver,
who was still a  schoolgirl when she conquered Europe's pop charts in 1978 with
her debut single,  Wuthering Heights. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I feel honoured,&quot; Bush says, politely side stepping the
comparisons. &quot;How  lovely to be compared up there to Joni Mitchell.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She is equally polite and off-handed in explaining why she hasn't toured
since  1979, despite the fact that her sold-out series of shows that year--the
only time she  toured--proved her continuing skills at combining song, dance and
theatre. 
</P>
<P>Advance word had it The Red Shoes would see Bush finally treading the boards
 again, with a basket of pop, rock and funk-charged tunes especially written for
live  performance, with guitar assists from big names like Prince, Eric Clapton
and Jeff  Beck. 
</P>
<P>Bush allows she gave the idea serious consideration, but decided instead to
put all  of her carefully marshalled energies into making The Line, The Cross
And The  Curve, a film built around six new songs that she premiered last night
to an  invitation-only audience at the Royal Ontario Museum. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd love to do some shows, but the whole thing of touring is very
daunting to me  now,&quot; Bush says, pleading exhaustion from nearly three
years' work in her home  studio on The Red Shoes, a period that also saw her
part with her long time partner,  Del Palmer, and mourn the death of her mother,
Hannah. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I like travelling, but I don't like doing a lot of travelling in a
short space. To do  some shows would be great; I think it would be really good
for me. There's nothing  planned ... The only plans I have right now are just to
take a break ....&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush expects her listeners to connect with her on an intuitive level more
than a  verbal one. She's pleased that one of her most arresting new songs, &quot;The
Song Of  Solomon&quot;, has a sexually strident chorus that most women
apparently understand,  but many men don't: &quot;Don't want your bulls-t, [sic]
yeah / Just want your  sexuality,&quot; it begins. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've noticed a lot of men ask me what it's about,&quot; Bush says,
smiling. &quot;And so  far, I haven't had one woman ask me. I think that's quite
interesting in itself. I  think in some ways it's kind of a 'girl talk' thing.&quot;

</P>
<P>Maybe more than girl talk, considering her legions of mostly female fans
give a  new Kate Bush album the scrutiny afforded Moses's delivery of the Ten 
Commandments. Bush Is intensely admired, and she knows it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose I feel there's a responsibility to myself, which is to try
to do the best I  can musically, and to just try to respect the position I'm in,
which I feel is very  privileged, because I'm doing what I want,&quot; she says.

</P>
<P>&quot;Not only am I able to make a living from it, but people sometimes give
me the  most extraordinary feedback, which is very moving.&quot;
