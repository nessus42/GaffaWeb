<H3>Kate's Surprise Date</H3>
<P>    KATE BUSH owes a lot to Emily Bronte's classic novel      &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;.</P>
<P>    It was after reading it two years ago -- and      then seeing a repeat
of the 1939 film      version on TV -- that she was inspired to      write her
extraordinary charttopper of the      same title.</P>
<P>    &quot;I felt I just had to write a song about the     tormented heroine
Cathy calling for the soul of      Heathcliffe so they could be together
eternally,&quot;      says the 20-year-old English doctor's daughter.</P>
<H3>    WAILING</H3>
<P>    &quot;Because she was a ghost, I gave her a      highpitched wailing
voice.&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; went straight to the top      and
established Kate as a top female pop star      almost overnight. Since then she
has made five      singles and three LPs and had numerous TV      appearances.</P>
<P>    And she has stuck to that high-pitched voice      with a distinct
Oriental flavour.</P>
<H3>    SURPRISE</H3>
<P>    In her spare time Kate has read &quot;Wuthering      Heights&quot; over
and over again; and tried to find out      as much as she can about Emily
Bronte.</P>
<P>    She was surprised to discover a personal link.      with the Victorian
author.</P>
<P>Kate and Emily share the same birthday - July 30. </P>
