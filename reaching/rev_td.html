<P>Kate Bush-The Dreaming (EMI) - Pigeonholing this internationally-popular
english songstress has been about as possible in the past as hearing her on
American radio (zip) but I think I've got a handle on her sound now. Imagine a
cross between Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell, Nina Hagen and Martha Davis, who's
listened to a lot of Peter Gabriel, and...er, doesn't help much, huh? Okay,
would you go for a cute, talented eccentric? I would. Occasionally, her musical
ambitions get the better of her, but no one who closes an album braying like a
donkey can be accused of being too pretentious, now can they?</P>

<P>KATE BUSH - THE DREAMING 
</P>
<P>by Colin Irwin/MELODY MAKER/September 11th 1982 
</P>
<P> Under the premise that the Great British Public instinctively turns its
nose up at  anything that's a little unexpected, or which doesn't meet its
carefully coiffured  preconceptions, then this album will be an overwhelming
flop. 
</P>
<P>The people'll be guided in their dismissive diagnosis, of course, by the
all-wise  radio producers who will flick quickly through it for the new &quot;Man
With The Child  In His Eyes&quot;, fail to find it, assume Kate's gone off her
trolley, and make a grab for  the safety of Haircut One Hundred. 
</P>
<P>Reputedly two years in the making, the first album produced by Kate herself,
no  expense or musical craving spared...the result is mind-boggling. Even by the
 mannered, eccentric standards she's set herself, this is still an odd one; you
may have  thought &quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;The Wedding List&quot; on
NEVER FOR EVER a little weird,  then &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; and &quot;Houdini&quot;
here are positively manic. 
</P>
<P>Always an artist of extremes, Bush has allowed her highly theatrical
imagination  to run riot, indulging all her musical fantasies, following her
rampant instincts, and  layering this album with an astonishing array of shrieks
and shudders. 
</P>
<P>Initially it is bewildering and not a little preposterous, but try to hang
on through  the twisted overkill and the historic fits and there's much reward,
if only in the  sense of danger she constantly courts. 
</P>
<P>Consider the options for a glamourous girl singer with an acute sense of
melody;  consider that she's taken the riskiest, most uncommercial route; and
consider  whether this album should be regarded with patience and admiration,
even when it  occasionally slips right over the top. 
</P>
<P>Two of it's ingredients, &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;The Dreaming&quot;,
have already  been issued as singles and sunk without a trace, which is not only
significant but  tragic. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is the perfect example of the
passion for percussive torrents  that's overtaken her (and the influence of
African music?) yet it's one of her more  restrained vocal performances on the
album where her dynamic singing is one of  the prime features (&quot;Get Out Of
My House&quot; has her roaring and ranting like a caged  lion, &quot;Leave It
Open&quot; has her yelling like a demented mynah bird.) Elsewhere, on  &quot;Houdini&quot;
and &quot;All The Love&quot;, she'll break us in gently, even tenderly, before
the  fuse runs out and we reel in awe and amazement at the sheer power of her
rage. 
</P>
<P>There's only one even vaguely conventional track, the lively &quot;Suspended
IN  Gaffa&quot;, though there's something strangely disconcerting even about
that and the  only light track is &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;, which is even
mildly funny as Kate  relates a tale of skullduggery with an exaggerated cockney
swagger. 
</P>
<P>The lyrics, naturally, are another thing altogether. An analyst would surely
come  up with an interesting conclusion for her obsession with lurid drama, so
vivid and  colourful it could be traditional balladry. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; is about crime; &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;
is a graphic account of  terrorism and war; &quot;All The Love&quot; and &quot;Houdini&quot;
blaze in one different aspect of  death, the latter in a particularly complex
but clever way. Personally I reckon the girl  watches too many B-movies. 
</P>
<P>The epic track, though, the cornerstone of the album is &quot;Night Of The
Swallow&quot;,  which shows both her growing maturity as a writer and her
arrival as an outstanding  producer. Another complicated song (surprise,
surprise) it moves gracefully through  many changing moods and patterns; it's a
work of both beauty and anguish,  poignancy and eeriness. These twists of mood
are enhanced by the use of sublime  Irish music (Liam O'Flynn and Donal Lunny of
Planxty, Sean Keane of the  Chieftans) interspected with the rugged main action.

</P>
<P>Like most of the other tracks, I'm still not entirely sure what the hell's
going on  or what it's all about, but the puzzle's intriguing enough to entice
you back until  you unravel it. It's the sort of album that makes me want to
kidnap the artist and  demand the explanation and inspiration behind each track.

</P>
<P>If you're out there, Kate, do me a favour and give me a bell, huh?

<H3>The Dreaming<BR> Kate Bush</H3>
<P>By Nick Burton</P>
<P>Kate Bush shouldn't be an unknown quantity very much longer.
<EM>The Dreaming</EM> is her masterpiece, a perfect blend of romantic poetic
imagery and daring musical approach. Bush's ace-in-the-hole is her ability to
fuse differing musical influences (jazz, classical, folk) and nestle them
comfortably within the boundaries of conventional pop songwriting. Each cut has
a unique life of its own; from the majestic waltz of &quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot;
to the jerky, Peter Gabrielish title track, Bush shifts styles without
sacrificing focus of mood.</P>
<P>So why is this perhaps the most fascinating female vocalist you've  never
heard? Maybe it's because her previous domestic release,
<EM>The Kick Inside</EM>, came way back in 1978 and failed to ignite here as it
did in Bush's native England, where it was bolstered by a Number One single, the
plaintive, haunting &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Nevertheless, whenever my
local shop got imports of her LPs
<EM>Lionheart</EM> and <EM>Never For Ever</EM>, they were gone in a flash. So
she has a following, but her cult artist status is ill-deserved: Bush has  the
dramatic edge, quirkiness and delicacy of Bowie in his Hunk Dory period; the
eclectic, almost Baroque curiousity of a Peter Gabriel; a simply amazing voice
that allows her to be alternately child-like and sensuously forceful; and a
subtle allure all her own. </P>
<P>Beyond this, she's one of the few active female rock artists who  performs,
composes and produces all her own material. In addition to having a natural
instinct for synthesizers, and the taste to  employ them effectively without
being bombastic or florid, Bush also manages to be as terse and tough-minded as
any male without sacrificing femininity. And her craftsmanship is atmospheric
and  effortlessly cool--in other words, she's the only female rocker  out there
doing anything original (or experimental) in contemporary pop, What's pending?
Stardom, one hopes. Kate Bush deserves it.</P>
