<P>Old Kate Bush Interviews 
</P>
<P>Unknown source: &quot;The Blossoming Ms. Bush&quot;, 1978 by Donna
McAllister 
</P>
<P> &lt;This is one of the earliest print interviews. It probably comes from an
Australian  source. Kate's answers are refreshingly naive and unguarded,
especially to readers  familiar with her more recent, heavily armored and
formulaic responses in  interviews about &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and &quot;The
Sensual World&quot;. She has since radically  changed the way she discusses such
topics as flying, the occult, even vegetarianism.  Below you can see how closely
the teenaged Kate Bush associated herself with the  Sixties idealism and
mysticism which she had absorbed from her two elder  brothers--attitudes which
these days she seems to hold less firmly, or at any rate to  internalize more
completely--IED.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush first came to our attention with &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;,
the song which  confused everyone as to what she was about. The fact that she is
only nineteen has  caused a lot of attention. Her new single is &quot;Man With
the Child in His Eyes&quot;, also  from the debut LP &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;.

</P>
<P>Her story is not one of &quot;overnight success&quot;. She was discovered by
Pink Floyd's  Dave Gilmour who managed to get her a record contract two years
ago. Despite  success, she still lives in a three-storey flat near London which
is owned by her  general-practitioner father and whose other two storeys are
occupied by her two  older brothers. 
</P>
<P>Here, she talks to Donna McAllister about stardom: 
</P>
<P>Despite the fact that she has been wrongly promoted as a mere child, Kate
Bush  is surprisingly aware of what is going on around her, and is accepting the
entire  shindig with a pleased air of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>&quot;They keep telling me the chart numbers, and I just kinda say, 'Oh,
wow!'&quot; (she  sweeps her arms). &quot;...It's not like it's really
happening. I've always been on the  outside, watching albums I like go up the
charts, and feeling pleased that they are  doing well, but it's hard to relate
to the fact that it's now happening to me...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Kate's self-penned song, inspired by the
Emily Bronte  book of the same name, literally catapulted into the UK charts (it
made number one  there, as it did here--Ed.) and looks as though it will be one
of those classic  worldwide smasheroonies. 
</P>
<P>She recently took her first airborne flight to Germany for a television 
appearance, as the single, apparently, has been chosen as whatever the German 
equivalent of &quot;pick-of-the-week&quot; might be. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was mind-boggling,&quot; she said euphorically, in reference to
flying. &quot;I really  want to do more of that...&quot; Wonder how she'll feel
about it in two years time. 
</P>
<P>She writes songs about love, people, relationships and life...sincerely and 
emotionally, but without prostituting her talents by whining about broken
hearts. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If you're writing a song, assuming people are going to listen, then
you have a  responsibility to those people. It's important to give them a
positive message,  something that can advise or help is far more effective than
having a wank and  being self-pitiful. That's really negative. My friends and
brothers have been really  helpful to me, providing me with stimulating
conversation and ideas I can really sink  my teeth into.&quot; 
</P>
<P>For as long as she can remember she has been toying around with the piano, 
much, I reckoned, to her partents' chagrin. Can you imagine living with a 
nine-year-old who insists on battering away on said instrument, wailing away at
the  top of her lungs in accompaniment? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, they weren't very encouraging in the beginning, they thought it
was a lot  of noise. When I first started, my voice was terrible, but the voice
is an instrument  to a singer, and the only way to improve it is to practice. &lt;Kate
didn't begin  &quot;battering away on&quot; the piano until age eleven or
so--IED.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have had no formal vocal training, though there was a guy that I
used to see  for half-an-hour once a week, and he would advise me on things like
breathing  properly, which is very important to voice control. He'd say things
like 'Does that  hurt? Well, then, sing more from here (motions to diaphragm)
than from your  throat.' I don't like the idea of 'formal' training, it has far
too many rules and  conventions that are later hard to break out of...&quot; 
</P>
<P>It is quite obvious from the cover of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, her debut
album, that Ms.  Bush is Orientally influenced, but apparently it was not meant
to take on such an  Oriental feel. &quot;I think it went a bit over the top,
actually. We had the kite, and as  there is a song on the album by that name,
and as the kite is traditionally Oriental,  we painted the dragon on. But I
think the lettering was just a bit too much. 
</P>
<P>&quot;On the whole I was surprised at the amount of control I actually had
with the  album production. Though I didn't choose the musicians.&quot; (Andrew
Powell,  producer and arranger, did.) &quot;I thought they were terrific. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was lucky to be able to express myself as much as I did, especially
with this  being a debut album. Andrew was really into working together, rather
than pushing  everyone around. I basically chose which tracks went on, put
harmonies where I  wanted them... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was there throughout the entire mix. I feel that's very important.
Ideally, I  would like to learn enough of the technical side of things to be
able to produce my  own stuff eventually.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate has a habit of gesturing constantly with her hands, and often
expressing  herself with unspellable sounds and grimaces. 
</P>
<P>Though this make tape transcriptions difficult, it does accentuate something
 which is very much a part of her--'movement and expression.' She has studied 
under the inimitable Lindsay Kempt, mime artiste, an experience shared with
Kate's  favourite musician, David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I admire actresses and actors terribly and think it's an amazing
craft. But  singing and performing your songs should be the same thing. At this
point, I would  rather develop my music and express it physically, as opposed to
having a script. I  think I'm much better off as a wailer...&quot; 
</P>
<P>She is, indeed, a beautiful woman. Carved ivory, with nary a nick. So
obviously  there is no way she can avoid becoming the target for sexist minds.
Although she  does not advocate this reaction, she's not flustered by it. After
all, it is a compliment. 
</P>
<P>&quot;As long as it does not interfere with my progress as a
singer-songwriter, it  doesn't matter, I just wish people would think of that
first. I would be foolish to  think that people don't look. I suppose in some
ways it helps to get more people to  listen...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Kick Inside&quot; suggests a keen interest in mysticism. &quot;I
try to work on myself  spiritually, and am always trying to improve my outlook
on life. We really abuse all  that we've got, assuming that we are so superior
as beings, taking the liberty of  sticking cement stuff all over the place. I
think there is a lot to astrology, and the  effect the moon has upon us all, but
I hate the way it's becoming so trendy now. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm a vegetarian, and now that's trendy as well...but what annoys me
the most  is the way people are so automatically cynical about astrology. I
mean, the Greeks  put an incredible amount of hard work into carefully planned
geometric charts,  based purely on mathematics. People just shrug it off. It's
the same with  coincidence, as I said in the song 'Strange Phenomena'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>At first, Kate was opposed to having any sort of management, feeling
strongly that  fewer mistakes are made if you deal with situations yourself,
directly. But she  quickly found out that this sort of idealism does not work,
and now has Peter  Lyster-Todd handling her business affairs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He has worked more on the theatrical side of entertainment than music.
I like  that. I think most managers are crooks--greedy and nonmusical; and that
mixing  with other music managers is contageous. I think Peter is amazing...&quot;

</P>
<P>&lt;Ironically, Kate and the Bush family almost immediately set about the
difficult  business of severing connections with Lyster-Todd, who, according to
at least one  unofficial source, was suspected of dipping into the till.
Lyster-Todd was replaced by  Hilary Walker, who is still connected to Kate's
current holding company, Novercia,  Ltd.--IED&gt; 
</P>
<P>Just as I'm about to leave, a pile of fan mail arrives, and she gapes,
amazed.  &quot;Cor...Is all this for me ??? This is amazing!&quot; 
</P>
<P> From her &quot;Kite&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind. Well, I'm not sure if
I want to be  up here at all. And I'd like to be back on the ground...&quot;

</P>
<P>Is &quot;wank&quot; a typo or did Kate really say that? 
</P>
<P>(For those outside the UK who haven't encountered the word before, it's
slang  for &quot;masturbate&quot;).
