<H3>&quot;She's HOW old?&quot;
</H3>
<P>    Kate Bush is a radiant young woman.</P>
<P>    She is also extremely talented; possesses a      hauntingly-beautiful
voice; is extremely articulate; writes      mystical but spellbinding songs;
brings out the most in      her piano; and is the most original artist this
writer has      heard this year, and in a long time, as a matter of fact.</P>
<P>    Kate Bush is all of <EM>19-years-old</EM>.</P>
<P>    But you would never know it.</P>
<P>    &quot;I honestly don't think of myself as 19,&quot; the      petite
songstress admits. I don't think of age as such;      I find it hard to start
relating to it because I don't.&quot;</P>
<P>    Although this interview was not supposed to dwell on the      fact of
Kate's age, some interesting points about the rock      press and public came
out because of it.</P>
<P>    &quot;I've had problems; that's what got me thinking about the      fact
that I am 19,&quot; Bush confesses. &quot;Some interviewers      made a point of
it, to the point where they were saying that       my music was alright because
I was 19.</P>
<P>    &quot;But I'm not into that at all, because I feel that the music     
should be treated at its own level and have nothing to do      with the age of
the person doing it.&quot;</P>
<P>    Kate Bush's music stands alone. When you clear your      head of the
fact that she is beautiful and young, her      incredible singing and
songwriting on her debut album      <EM>The Kick Inside</EM> can engulf you and
take you      on a musical journey.</P>
<P>    Kate Bush has never been called a child prodigy, or all the      other
titles that usually walk hand-in-hand with talented      young people. And there
is a reason for it.</P>
<P>    &quot;I was never called any of that,&quot; notes Bush.      &quot;There's
a line between a child prodigy and someone      who's just doing their own
thing. I think the reason why child      prodigies don't come through is because
they're being led      through something. They're not actually  going through it
     themselves; they're not directing their destiny. It's either      their
manager or their parents.&quot;</P>
<H3>  Not being led</H3>
<P>    Kate Bush is not being led through anything. Music      seemed to be
part of her life since birth in Kent, England.      Her two brothers were
heavily involved in bands, which      resulted in Kate admitting &quot;I just
grew up with music all      around me.&quot;</P>
<P>    At the age of 11. Kate began &quot;poking around at the      piano and
making up little songs.&quot; However, Kate did      not play the standard
Beatle and pop tunes. She became more      involved and was &quot;always just
exploring the instrument.&quot;</P>
<P>    Three years later, Kate began to take a serious approach to      her
composing and piano playing.</P>
<P>    &quot;I began to treat the words to the songs as poetry. I'd      always
been keen on poetry at school and it was lovely to put      the poems together
with  music.&quot; remembers Bush.</P>
<P>    Bush's 'poems and music' become, when blended together,      solid,
well-structured tunes. And although the music is      interesting and new, it's
her incredible lyrics that rivet you      to your speakers.</P>
<P>    &quot;My writing's a very personal thing to me, but it's      not
necessarily about myself,&quot; concedes Bush.      &quot;I treat it very much
like a complete involvment.      When you're writing a song, you have to get
right into it.      There's no point in being outside it. otherwise it wouldn't 
    be an emotion. And I think that's what music's all about:      it's an
emotional process.&quot;</P>
<H3>    Impressed Gilmour</H3>
<P>    Her uncanny writing ability impressed many, including      Pink Floyd's
David Gilmour, who was so knocked-out by      Kate's ability that he put up the
funds for a demo recording      session at a London studio.</P>
<P>    EMI Records heard the tape and were equally floored.      After picking
themselves up, they quickly added Kate to      their label. But because she was
still so young, only 16, it was      decided that the next few years should be
dedicated to      developing her already incredible talents.</P>
<P>    Lindsey Kemp, who tutored David Bowie in mime, did the      same with
Bush in mime and modern dance. Later, Bush      began dance classes at London's
Dance Centre.</P>
<P>    She kept on writing, singing and playing until last summer.      when
she recorded <EM>The Kick Inside.</EM> Although      ready for release last
fall, the LP was not unleashed upon      the market until this year.</P>
<P>    And perhaps the best factor about the album is that it is so     
difficult to classily.</P>
<P>    &quot;The best way to monitor that is by the letters I get,&quot;     
Bush says. It has really amazed me, because the people I'm      getting feedback
from are so widespread.  I'm getting letters      from kids of five and six:
teenagers of 15 and 16 all the      way up to men of 30 to 40 years old. For me.
that's the      best thing I can do, because I'm not concerned with     
reaching a specific area. I want people to choose me,      because I can't
choose them, they're the people who listen      to it and hopefully like it. I
want to reach everybody, the      more the better.&quot;</P>
<P>    Upon first listen to <EM>The Kick Inside,</EM> one is      immediately
stunned by the high-pitched and unique vocal      work of Kate.</P>
<P>    &quot;For me, it's not particularly unique.&quot; notes Bush,      who
lists her main influence as David Bowie, although she      admits to be knocked
out by Billie Holiday. &quot;The first time I      realized that maybe hitting
people that way was when      they would say 'You can't pronouce something like
that.      you've got. to pronounce it this way.'</P>
<P>    &quot;When I first started singing I didn't have a voice at all. I    
could sing in tune, but what I did for years was work. with a      piano, always
with a piano whenever I sing. And I think      both my piano technique and voice
developed together.       Maybe it's a psychological thing and I'm trying to
sound      like the piano. I think had I been writing with a guitar, I     
might well have a completely different voice.&quot;</P>
<P>    Kate Bush is now being touted by many, including myself,      as one of
'78's new stars, as well as an extremely promising      talent.</P>
<P>    But does Kate Bush ever wish to be just an 'ordinary' 19-year-old?</P>
<P>    &quot;As far as I'm concerned. I'm ordinary,&quot; she admits.     &quot;It's
just that my work is extraordinary because it's an      extraordinary business.&quot;
