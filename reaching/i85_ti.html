<P>The girl who reached Wuthering Heights 
</P>
<P>by Mike Nicholls 
</P>
<P>From The Times August 27, 1985 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill.] 
</P>
<P> It is almost eight years since Kate Bush surprised the pop world with her
single  Wuthering Heights, which, based on the Bronte classic novel, topped the
record  charts for a month. Although this unusual singer and songwriter has
never rescaled  the commercial peak of that teenage debut, a certain visibility
has been maintained. 
</P>
<P>Further hits like Hammer Horror, Babooshka, and Sat In Your Lap sustained
her  audience throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s while her most recent
album, The  Dreaming, entered the listings at No. 3 - the same number of years
since we last  heard from her. A situation which begs the obvious question,
whatever has she been  doing since then and why has it taken so long. 
</P>
<P>The later part is self-explanatory. Bush has always been a perfectionist and
for  her to spend six months writing songs followed by a year recording them is
par for  the course. Phil Collins, for argument's sake, might be able to bash
out an LP every  six months and still have time to play with any act taking his
fancy, but Kate is made  of more sensitive, self-critical stuff. She is also
familiar with the punitive cost of  studio time and so spent the rest of her
absence building one of her own. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It has always been an ambition of mine to have my own studio so once
we found  a house, we set about putting one together in the back garden&quot;,
she says. &quot;Although I  can work under a certain amount of pressure, paying &amp;90
an hour at Abbey Road  got to be too much. It also meant having to travel into
London every day which can  be pretty exhausting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>By &quot;we&quot; Kate is referring to her bass player and boyfriend of six
years standing,  Del Palmer. The daughter of a typically middle-class Home
Counties doctor, one  might have expected Ms. Bush to be wed by now. But
marriage does not feature in  her plans. 
</P>
<P>She does admit to basing many of her songs on their relationship. For
example,  the new single, Running Up That Hill, is about the inability of a man
to see things  from a woman's point of view - and vice versa - as a result of
fundamental  biological differences. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It seems that the more you get to know a person, the greater the scope
there is  for misunderstanding. Sometimes you can hurt somebody purely
accidentally or be  afraid to tell them something because you think they might
be hurt when really  they'll understand. So what that song is about is making a
deal with God to let two  people swap place so they'll be able to see things
from one another's perspective.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If this seems profound stuff for an anticipated return to the Top Ten, it is
 lightweight in comparison with some of the material on the forthcoming album. 
Entitled Hounds Of Love, side two comprises a suite of seven songs concerning  &quot;someone
drowning, or rather, trying not to drown.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One track in particular, &quot;Watching Me Watching You&quot; [sic! -
Watching You  Without Me], shows Kate's outrageous imagination at work. A man,
with nothing  but a lifejacket to keep him afloat, has been in the sea for a
while and is becoming  quite delirious. He imagines his spirit returning home to
tell his loved one of his  dilemma but she can't hear him because he's only a
ghost. Frustrating, really. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Let's face it,&quot; Kate tries to rationalize, &quot;it's gonna get
pretty weird in the water  after a couple of hours. But I suppose the specific
message of the song is the really  horrific thought of being away from the
person you love most and there's no way  you can communicate. You can't cuddle
them or have the comfort of their physical  warmth and they can't even see or
hear you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When not singing about love, Kate is preoccupied by alienation. &quot;the
song says a  lot about that,&quot; she continues. &quot;A parallel situation
could exist if it was about divorce.  You know, the husband coming back to see
his children but he's no longer a part of  the home. Instead he's just an
observer who isn't being seen by the people there  because his role has become
so different. I guess there must be some feeling of  insecurity within me to
make me think along these lines,&quot; she signs, before adding  more brightly, &quot;Love
and water and sky. That's what sums this album up, really! It's  absolutely
drowning in it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If Kate Bush gives the impression of being in need of some help, then it
ought to  be pointed out that she has always conversed in this somewhat random,
madcap  manner. And now she's cut off from the world even more, ensconced in
deepest  Kent with boyfriend Del. 
</P>
<P>Last week Del bought Kate an antique pocket watch for her 27th birthday. 
Enthusiastically she pulls it out, exclaiming: &quot;It gives off really old
vibes! I can almost  imagine being taken back to the time it was made. It's like
our house. One day we  suddenly stumbled across it and a back door had been left
open so we were able to  go inside. I'm sure there's a kind of force, a magnetic
energy saying, come in,  we're meant for each other.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Eccentricities aside, Kate Bush has her own views on the news coverage of 
heroin, hijackings and other current issues and confesses to watching &quot;a
lot of  rubbish on television just to keep in touch with what's going on.&quot;
For the record,  Saturday evening game shows are favourite although she draws
the line at Dynasty.  And while not entirely approving of breakfast TV - &quot;People
are literally hit over the  head by the media from the moment they get up&quot;
she realizes that in the ages of the  promotional video clip it can only help
artists like her. 
</P>
<P>For someone like Kate who takes years to make an album, the video boom has 
been a godsend. For rather than having to set aside time and energy to promote
an  LP with a long, strenuous tour, video can do the trick, especially when the
record  company is prepared to put up however much money is necessary to make
the video  as spectacular as her live shows have been. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ideally we'll be working with budgets comparable to films which means
being  able to go on location rather than using studio sets. That'll be a great
excuse to get  carried away!&quot; she almost squeals with delight. 
</P>
<P>In the case of Kate Bush I'd hardly have thought one was necessary.
