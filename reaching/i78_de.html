</H3>
<P>By David Wigg</P>
<P>Kate Bush, with her first record, has reached dizzy  heights.</P>
<P>Her haunting &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is now at the top of the charts.
It knocked Swedish group Abba from the No. 1 spot.</P>
<P>Yesterday, by way of celebration, the 19-year-old doctor's daughter treated
herself to a &pound;7,000 Steinway baby grand piano.</P>
<P>Kate's song -- which she wrote -- has also collected a silver disc for
selling more than &pound;250,000 copies in Britain.</P>
<P>Her recording company, EMI, celebrated her reaching No. 1 (I tipped her for
the top last month) with champagne. Then the singer flew from London's Heathrow
to have dinner in Paris.</P>
<P>It was after reading Emily Bronte's <EM>Wuthering Heights</EM> that she was
inspired to write a song about the tormented heroine Cathy, calling for the soul
of Heathcliff so they could be together.</P>
<H3>Ghost
</H3>
<P>&quot;I really try to project myself into the role of Cathy and so, as she
is a ghost, I gave her a high-pitched, wailing voice,&quot;  explained Kate.</P>
<P>EMI recognised Kate's potential as a songwriter at 16, when they  put her
under contract and gave her an advance of &pound;3,000 to live on.</P>
<P>They felt she was too young to become a star then and did not even bother to
release a recording. Instead, they sent her away to concentrate on writing more
songs and develop her singing style.</P>
<P>She bought a honky-tonk piano for &pound;200 and spent most nights composing
her songs on it.</P>
<H3>Amber
</H3>
<P>&quot;I've always dreamed of having a grand piano,&quot; said Kate, a
delicately attractive girl with large amber eyes and long auburn hair. &quot;Now
I can afford one.&quot;</P>
<P>She grew up at Welling, Kent, but now lives in a Lewisham flat with two
cats, Zoodle and Pyewacket. Her two brothers keep a protective watch over her,
as they live in the same house. Twenty-five-year-old Paddy Bush plays mandolin
and is a member of the five-piece group she has formed to back her on concert
tours.</P>
