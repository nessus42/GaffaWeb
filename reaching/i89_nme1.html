Subject: NME Interview early Oct. 1989 (short excerpt) 
</p>



<p>I'm sure someone else will have posted about this before mine reaches the net 
but anyway.... 
</p>

<p>This weeks New Musical Express (NME) carries a long interview with Kate and 
her face adorns the cover. I don't have it here with me though I'm sure, even as we 
speak, someone is busily typing it or parts of it in. Anyway it deals mainly with the 
new album and has plentiful extracts from the single and from Ulysses (Molly's 
speech) scattered throughout. She explains how the lyrics for The Sensual World (I 
refuse to abbreviate such an excellent title !) came about. Apparently, she first wrote 
the songs with lyrics directly lifted from the text of Ulysses but was forced to 
change them somewhat when she was refused permission to use the text. 
</p>

<p>By the way, the article revealed this bit of lyric : 
</p>

<p>&quot;Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies&quot; etc. 
</p>

<p>which I for one couldn't figure out. 
</p>

<p>At the end of the article, Kate &quot;reviews&quot; all the songs on the album. Being one of 
the great unwashed who has yet to lay his hands on a promo cassette, I can't 
comment on her comments. For those of you horrible people who have heard the 
album already, I'm sure her comments will be of intense interest. 
</p>

<p>She also talks at length about the ethnic feel to the album, what with the Trio 
Bulgarka and various Irish musicians playing on it, and how she felt the these two 
ethnic influences gelled together. 
</p>

<p>Anyway, if you wish to hear Kate's own feelings about the new disc, I suggest 
you grab a copy of this.

</p>


<p>&lt;This interview was conducted in late September, 1989, by Len Brown, with five 
accompanying photographs by Kevin Cummins. Brown was also the man who 
interviewed Kate briefly for NME in December 1988, during her recording sessions 
with Trio Bulgarka. This interview is the first detailed interview to emerge in 
connection with the new album, The Sensual World, and as such, is really the first 
substantial interview with Kate in well over a year. IED is not responsible for--but 
will probably not be able to restrain himself from commenting on--the many 
infuriatingly silly and ignorant remarks which Mr. Brown makes throughout the 
article.&gt; 
</p>





<p> In the Realm of the Senses 
</p>



<p> The essence of sensuality and childlike wonder or screeching wood nymph? Kate 
Bush steps back into the spotlight afterfour years of reclusive recording and constant 
innuendo and rumours from the press to explain herself again. Len Brown 
reacquaints himself with Joyce's latest disciple. Pictures: Kevin Cummins. 
</p>



<p>&quot;on Howth head in the grey tweed suit in his staw hat the day I got him to 
propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was 
leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath 
yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all of a womans 
body yes&quot; 
</p>

<p>(-- from Molly Bloom's speech in James Joyce's Ulysses ) 
</p>



<p> &quot; Mmh, yes, 
</p>

<p>Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth 
</p>

<p>Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes, 
</p>

<p>Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies 
</p>

<p>Off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes, 
</p>

<p>He said I was a flower of the mountain, yes, 
</p>

<p>But now I've powers o'er a woman's body--yes.&quot; 
</p>

<p>(-- from Kate Bush's The Sensual World ) 
</p>



<p>We meet in a rather sensual room in a sumptuous West London hotel. It's an 
appropriate place to interview Kate Bush. The walls are stacked with paintings of 
nudes--pink boobs, vermillion nips, plenty of Botticelli cheeks--of cockfights and 
banquets, of mankind indulging in animal passions. Orange juice and nuts are 
consumed varaciously throughout discussions.

<!-- Removed due to copyright takedown request

<p> Four years from Hounds of Love, twelve months since we last met in the 
company of three Bulgarian grannies called Trio Bulgarka, Kate's changed little 
physically. Still petite, naturally older, her hair's still long and henna-ed and the 
nervous laugh is as infectious as ever. &lt;&quot;Naturally older&quot; is a typically ill-written 
phrase: what does he mean?&gt;
</p>

<p> Musically she's been gone a long time. Sure there've been collaborations 
(Gabriel's Don't Give Up), charitable outings (Amnesty, Comic Relief, Ferry 
Aid) and The Whole Story compilation, but The Sensual World is her first fresh 
substantial work since the Experiment IV single in late '86. Reasonable people were 
beginning to wonder whether, at last, she'd lost it completely and thrown in the 
towel.
</p>

<p> What's always been remarkable about Kate Bush has been the ability to 
withdraw from the music world, escape from the machine, and return months or 
years later with something rejuvenating, original, set apart from chart-fodder 
disposable pop. Like Bowie in the '70s, Bush in the '80s has been one of the true 
oddities, exceptions to the rules. Always out of step, always unique.
</p>

<p> And always, as The Sensual World implies, provocative. implies, provocative. Bells 
ring as you enter her Sensual World, bells of celebration, of sensual joy. &quot;The 
communication of music is very much like making love,&quot; she once said, so it's 
entirely appropriate that she should derive her title track from James Joyce's 
Ulysses and, in particular, Molly Bloom's thoughts on sex, sensuality and oysters at 
2/6 per dozen.
</p>

<p> &quot;Because I couldn't get permission to use a piece of Joyce it gradually turned 
into the song about Molly Bloom the character stepping out of the book, into the real 
world and the impressions of sensuality,&quot; says Kate, softly, almost childlike. &quot;Rather 
than being in this two-dimensional world, she's free, let loose to touch things, feel 
the ground under her feet, the sunsets, just how incredibly sensual a world it is.
</p>

<p> &quot;I originally heard the piece read by Siobhan McKenna years ago, and I thought, 
'My God! This is extraordinary. What a piece of writing!' It's a very unusual train 
of thought--very attractive. First I got the &quot;mmh yes,&quot; and that made me think of 
Molly Bloom's speech; and we had this piece of music in the studio already, so it 
came together really quickly. Then, because I couldn't get permission to use Joyce, 
it took another year changing it to what it is now. Typical, innit!&quot;
</p>

<p> The result is extraordinarily sensual mouth music, far removed from the 
cod-pieced crassness that usually passes for physical love songs: &quot;And at first with 
the charm around him, mmh yes/He loosened it so if it slipped between my 
breasts/He'd rescue it, mmh yes.&quot;
</p>

<p> &quot;In the original piece, it's just 'Yes&quot;--a very interesting way of leading you in. It 
pulls you into the piece by the continual acceptance of all these sensual things: &quot;Ooh 
wonderful!' I was thinking I'd never write anything as obviously sensual as the 
original piece, but when I had to rewrite the words, I was trapped.
</p>

<p> &quot;How could you recreate that mood without going into that level of sensuality? 
So there I was writing stuff that months before I'd said I'd never write,&quot; she laughs. 
&quot;I have to think of it in terms of pastiche, and not that it's me so much.&quot;
</p>

<p> Having begun her career on The Kick Inside singing lines like &quot;Oh I need it oh 
oh feel it feel it my love&quot; and &quot;feeling of sticky love inside&quot;, and then gone on in 
Lionheart to write a lyric like &quot;the more I think of &lt;sic&gt; sex the better it gets&quot;, her 
reluctance to get too sensual, too fruity, a decade later may seem a little strange. 
&lt;Naturally, however, Brown makes no attempt to ask her about this apparent 
contradiction.&gt;
</p>

<p> But as Bush has increasingly gained control over the presentation of her music 
and her image during this period, stepping back from early marketing attempts to 
titillate (God, how they worked!), these reservations are understandable.
</p>

<p> She claims The Sensual World contains the most &quot;positive female energy&quot; in her 
work to date, and compositions like This Woman's Work tend to enforce that idea. 
&lt;A bit simplistic, this idea, since TWW is written from the man's perspective. -- 
IED&gt;
</p>

<p> &quot;I think it's to do with me coming to terms with myself on different levels. &lt;That 
has got to be one of Kate's all-time favourite stock phrases!&gt; In some ways, like on 
Hounds of Love it was important for me to get across the sense of power in the 
songs that I'd associated with male energy and music. But I didn't feel that this 
time, and I was very much wanting to express myself as a woman in my music, 
rather than as a woman wanting to sound as powerful as a man.
</p>

<p> &quot;And definitely The Sensual World --the track--was very much a female track 
for me. I felt it was a really new expression, feeling good about being a woman 
musically.&quot;
</p>

<p> But isn't it odd that this feminist or feminine perspective should have been 
inspired by a man, Joyce?
</p>

<p> &quot;Yes, in some ways...but it's also the idea of Molly escaping from the author, out 
into the real world, being this real human, rather than the character: stepping out of 
the page into the sensual world.&quot;
</p>

<p> So is this concept of sensuality the most important thing to you at the moment? 
Is it one of the life forces?
</p>

<p> &quot;Yes. It's about contact with humans. It could all come down to the sensual level. 
Touch? Yes. Even if it's not physical touch: reaching out and touching people by 
moving them. I think it's a very striking part of this planet, the fact that there is so 
much for us to enjoy. The whole of Nature is really designed for everything to have a 
good time doing what they should be doing...Fancy being a bee, leading an 
incredible existence, all these flowers designed just for you, flying into the runway, 
incredible colours--some trip...&quot;
</p>

<p> Mmh buzz.
</p>

<p> Many bumbles have breathed their last since Kate Bush first arrived on our 
screens, flouncing about in dry ice and funeral shroud &lt;sic&gt;, oddly crowing 
Wuthering Heights ; obviously different and apart from any musical movement 
before or since. But whereas the all-conquering, universally acclaimed Hounds of 
Love affair at least slotted into the then-pop world, The Sensual World is clearly even 
more out of step with current piss-poor post-SAW &lt;Stock, Aitkin, Waterman, a team 
of current British pop dance-record producers, responsible for Rick Astley, Kylie 
Minogue, etc.&gt; scene.
</p>

<p> Probably because it's got a slightly ethnic feel, founded on Kate's use of Irish 
and Bulgarian musics and musicians in the creative process. Perhaps because she's 
been free from pop for so long. Maybe because she's crossed the threshold of 30?
</p>

<p> &quot;God! Yes. I'm sure it's all tied in with it,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I think it's a very 
important time: from 28 to 32-ish, where there's some kind of turning point. 
Someone said that in your teens you get the physical puberty, and between 28 and 32 
mental puberty. Let's face it, you've got to start growing up when you're 30, it does 
make you feel differently. I feel very positive having gone through the last couple of 
years.&quot; &lt;Very positive? What an unexpected remark!&gt;
</p>

<p> She's not specific about what she's actually gone through in recent years &lt;What 
a surprise!&gt;, apart from the usual trials by media. If you were to scan back through 
the smeared pages of cheaper organs you would probably come to the conclusion 
that she's been a.) pregnant; b.) fighting drug and alcohol addiction; c.) 25 stone; and 
d.) having several flings with Peter Gabriel. &lt;Brown obviously didn't ask her directly 
about these stupid rumours--but whether his own &quot;organ&quot; is &quot;cheap&quot; or not, he and 
it couldn't resist dredging them all up once again.&gt;
</p>

<p> More credibly, it seems she's been reclusively struggling with her music, and 
even living in bliss (somewhere near Kent, apparently) with long-term lover, bassist 
and moustachioed mixer Del Palmer.
</p>

<p> And yet one is naturally tempted to peer into The Sensual World and inquire 
whether or not a song such as Between a Man and a Woman is a personal account of 
romantic difficulties? (&quot;It's so hard for love to stay together/With the modern 
Western pressures&quot;).
</p>

<p> &quot;But anything you write, people tend to think it's about you,&quot; she says, 
nervously. &quot;Like Woody Allen: his films are obviously very personal. There's 
obviously an awful lot of him in his work. But you see him being interviewed, and as 
soon as he's asked if it's personal he gets really defensive. It's a very awkward 
area...
</p>

<p> &quot;On this album there's more of me in there, in a more honest way than before, 
and yet, although some of it's me, the songs songs aren't about aren't about me. It's 
this kind of vague mish-mash of other people and yourself; bits of films; things 
you've heard--all put together in a mood that says a lot about me at this time.
</p>

<p> &quot;A lot of people will think these songs are about me. I've always had that. And 
like, with Deeper Understanding, people react immediately, saying, &quot;Is this 
autobiographical? So you're into computers now? So you spend all night on 
computers?' People immediately switch on to the mechanicalness: It's a song about 
computers, so she must be into computers!&quot; &lt;Note that she doesn't actually say 
whether she is using computers or not! Classic Kate! Nor, of course, does Brown 
have the presence of mind to ask her; and in the second part of this interview, when 
Kate was asked to comment on each track in succession, she apparently declined to 
comment on this song further. -- IED&gt;
</p>

<p> The fascination with Bush's private life, and the tittle-tattle speculation that't 
surrounded it, obviously arises from the woman's reluctance to play the fame game. 
True, she now and then turns out for charitable gaqtherings, but hardly ever see her 
photographed legless in Lennon's, or chucking up outside The Groucho like proper 
pop stars.
</p>

<p> &quot;I've almost been me for the last couple of years, but, in the last two weeks, I've 
been aware of people treating me as what seems to be a very famous person. It's 
totally surreal, going into an isolated way of working, three or four years at a time, 
then coming out and having everyone look at you as if they know you.
</p>

<p> &quot;It's healthier for me not to indulge in being a famous person. It's ridiculous. 
There's absolutely no reason why I should be at all, other than that I make records.&quot; 
&lt;Except maybe that she makes the best records in the history of civilisation!&gt;
</p>

<p> &quot;I find it extraordinary that people should want to write about me when I do so 
little. I just pop out and do an album and go away again.&quot;
</p>

<p> It sometimes seems that way. Three years between The Dreaming and Hounds 
of Love ; four more before we begin to enter The Sensual World. Yet the creative 
business is a lengthy, complicated and concentrated process, initially begun by Kate 
and Del in their home studio.
</p>

<p> &quot;I found the writing very difficult on this,&quot; she admits, almost embarrassed. &quot;I 
don't know what I wanted to say or how to treat the songs, make them sound 
differently, to get outside musicians in to do something or just go away and think. A 
lot of it is jigsawing: I'd get to the point where I couldn't write, where I was sick of 
the songs. And yet you thought they were OK to begin with. The problem is holding 
on to that energy level.&quot;
</p>

<p> The diverse musicianship on The Sensual World, the variety of sounds and rootsy 
emotions that have been brought to bear, is perhaps the album's greatest strength. 
Around the hub of Kate, her multi-instrumentalist brother Paddy and Del Palmer, 
are gathered Celtic craftsmen such as Davey Spillane, Alan Stivell and Donal Lunny, 
plus the remarkable veteran vocal talents of Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka. Throw in 
Dave Gilmour guitar solos and flurries of fiddle from Nigel Kennedy and you're 
beginning to approach The Sensual World. 
</p>

<p>Her Celtic passion has been longstanding and comes from her Irish mother. Night 
of the Swallow back on '82's The Dreaming first featured Donal Lunny with piper 
Liam O'Flynn. And brother Paddy's obsession with obscure European musics 
encouraged Kate to listen to those Bulgarian voices and try and harness them with 
her own.
</p>

<p> &quot;I wanted to work with the Irish guys again because it gets better each time. But 
I was never sure it'd come off with Trio Bulgarka. On Never Be Mine all the Irish 
stuff was done, and then the girls came in.&quot; (The girls must be 180 years old 
collectively.) &quot;Two separate entities put together, but similar energies. And 
sometimes you can hear little Irish riffs and flavours in the Bulgarian music and 
vice-versa.
</p>

<p> &quot;For Bulgaria, the terrific amount of suffering they've gone through is so 
apparent in the music, so spiritually powerful and intense that, if you let it, it'd just 
rip you apart. Maybe it's the same with Ireland. Maybe these are two races that have 
turned to music in times of hardship: broken hearts singing, in terrible pain, getting 
help through the music.&quot;
</p>

<p> The overall result of these liasons is a definite departure from everything Bush 
has done before. In the past she's used ethnic instruments and accents just to make 
her own compositions (and costumes) more exotic--take Kashka From Baghdad or 
Egypt &lt;what a jerk. -- IED&gt;-- but here the Irish-Bulgarian combination is powerful 
and effective, an integral part of The Sensual World. (Trio Bulgarka and the Uillean 
piper Davey Spillane feature on three tracks, Spillane playing a wonderfully strange 
Macedonian solo on the title track/single.)
</p>

<p> &quot;I'm curious and nervous to know how people will take it,&quot; grins Kate. &quot;They'll 
either really like it or hate it. Ethnic music for some people is just too far out. They 
can't relate unless there's a Western influence. They can't understand.&quot;
</p>

<p> To be frank, when Kate Bush began and some of us were still at our physical 
peaks, the appeal was largely physical and sexual. Mmh, yes, the wiggling of Wow. 
Mmh, yes, the bounce of Babooshka. Mmh, yes, the erotic womb-view of Breathing. 
But we've all passed a lot of water since then and, naturally, all grown up.
</p>

<p> Except, it sometimes seems from the songs, Kate herself. &lt;What about this 
foul-minded little twerp who did this interview? Does he actually consider the 
previous paragraph &quot;grown-up&quot; writing? --IED.&gt; Listening back, to tracks like 
Cloudbusting, and now to Reaching Out, it seems as if the child in her has been 
preserved. In The Fog on The Sensual World, her father, Dr. John &lt;sic--his name is 
Robert, fuckhead.--IED&gt; Bush, paternally announces: &quot;Just put your feet down child, 
'Cause you're all grown up now.&quot;
</p>

<p> &quot;It's hard for me to say. The way people see me is so diverse,&quot; comments Kate, 
on the theory that childishness is part of her appeal. &quot;I suppose in lots of ways I'm 
still very much like a little girl, and probably always will be, even if I make it to 60 or 
70.
</p>

<p> &quot;It's an interesting perspective of life, a child's. Maybe it's because I'm so small 
and still at knee level. The symbolism of the child is such a powerful thing, because 
it's the small vulnerable thing looking out at the big worl.&quot;
</p>

<p> But hasn't reaching 30...?
</p>

<p> &quot;OK, stop rubbing it in, young man!&quot;
</p>

<p> Don't you start worrying about what people think of you physically?
</p>

<p> &quot;But this is like the first time we've experienced young music growing old, and 
it's like people won't allow it. Look at the stick a lot of our gorgeous men are 
getting now that they're in their 4os. It doesn't seem to be hip for guys to be in 
their 40s and still in the rock industry.
</p>

<p> &quot;I don't really see myself as a performer, and that's hard for me--when I have 
to come out and expose myself and be the saleswoman of the hour. I don't have the 
same kind of exposure as other performers do. I suppose if people think I look 
horrible they tend to keep it to themselves. Maybe I haven't started hittling the real 
horrors yet. What do you think?&quot;
</p>

<p> Er...
</p>

<p> &quot;Oh, dear!&quot;
</p>

<p> No, no, you don't look horrible at all!
</p>

<p> &quot;It's the whole train of thought: 'Oh my God, doesn't she look old!' Usually I 
get, 'Oh my God, doesn't she look small!&quot; 
</p>

<p>&quot; When I could wear a sunset, mmh, yes, And how we'd wished to live in the 
sensual world, You don't need words, Just one kiss, then another... &quot;
</p>

<p> Pleasures of the senses? Or the vicious indulgence of animal passions? You can 
view the sensual world either way. To Kate Bush, sensuality is obviously a positive, 
receptive, natural experience, far removed from Happy Mondays-style chemistry-set 
hedonism. Check that video, &quot;walking through these woods, with the weather 
changing, the elemental energies of the earth, wind, pollen, sunset, bite of hail, 
continually walking through the same environment with that sense of the changing 
world.&quot;
</p>

<p> To the believer this is real sensuality, communion with nature, oneness with the 
earth. To the cynic it's a load of hippy shit in any language. &lt;What a fuckhead! Jeez, 
IED hates these effete British music journalists.&gt; And predictably, at the centre of 
the whole philosophy, there's the doctrine of, yes, love. So choose your path 
carefully, children...
</p>

<p> &quot;Love is a wonderful, powerful thing,&quot; trills Kate, without a hint of 
Fotherington-Thomas. &lt;These music journalists are always so astoundingly 
preoccupied with the job of making sure they're coming off as cynical and hip and 
&quot;cool&quot; in their readers' eyes that they don't even have the minimal courage to 
consider the wonder of the natural world--as though love and Nature were only fads 
of the 60s, now somehow &quot;out of date&quot;! And one more thing: Kate doesn't &quot;trill&quot;! 
Smug, patronizing, supercilious jerk. -- IED&gt; &quot;In many ways nearly every song I've 
ever written is a love song. It's very important to try and learn to love people as 
much as you can. But we all get so scared. It's only when people are at points in 
their lives when they get such shocks that they take it as it really should be. The rest 
of us just seem to piss about.&quot;
</p>

<p> Track by track: The Sensual World of Kate Bush
</p>

<p> &quot;It feels like ten very separate songs, ten short stories, but although I think 
there's probably a mood that hangs them together, it's not really conceptual at all.&quot;
</p>

<p> Very true, Kate, except there's 11 of 'em; from the Joycean celebration of The 
Sensual World single through to the almost Dreaming -like optimism of Walk 
Straight Down the Middle. &lt;Optimism? Optimism ?! -- IED&gt; 
</p>



<p>THE SENSUAL WORLD
</p>

<p> Based on Molly Bloom's monologue at the end of Joyce's Ulysses, The Sensual 
World only stepped off the printed page when the publishers refused to give Kate 
Bush permission to quote the novel.
</p>

<p> &quot;It transformed the song. Obviously the words had to change, but also the 
musical sections were completely different. By them being oncooperative it made the 
track better in many ways, but it was very difficult to keep the rhythmic sense of 
the words.&quot;
</p>

<p> What's the significance of the bells at the beginning of the song?
</p>

<p> &quot;I've got a thing about the sound of bells. It's one of those fantastic sounds: 
sound of celebration. The're used to mark points in life--births, weddings, 
deaths--but they give this tremendous feeling of celebration.
</p>

<p> &quot;In the original speech she's talking of the time when he proposed to her, and I 
just had the image of bells, this image of them sitting on the hillside with the sound 
of bells in the distance. In hindsight, I also think it's a lovely way to start an album: a 
feeling of celebration that puts me on a hillside somewhere on a sunny afternoon and 
it's like, mmh...Sounds of celebration get fewer and fewer. We haven't many left. 
And yet people complain of the sound of bells in cities.&quot;
</p>

<p> Why's Davey Spillane playing a Macedonian air on his Uillean pipes in the 
middle of it? &lt;Note that Kate has not identified this music as such, only the idiot 
interviewer. It may or may not be correct.-- IED&gt;
</p>

<p> &quot;It was one of those, 'Oh what the hell' things. That seems to have been the 
way with a lot of this album. Sort of 'Oh god! Tut...Will it work? Ooh, er...' Then 
when I've eventually just gone for it, it seems to have worked.&quot; 
</p>



<p>LOVE AND ANGER
</p>

<p> &quot;This song! This bloody song!
</p>

<p> &quot;It was one of the most difficult to put together, yet the first to be written. I 
came back to it 18 months later and pieced it together. It doesn't really have a story. 
It's just me trying to write a song, ha-ha.
</p>

<p> &quot;Obviously the imagery you get as a child is very strong. This is about who you 
can or cannot confide in when there's something you can't talk about. 'If you can't 
tell your sister, If you can't tell a priest...' Who did I have in the lyrics? Was it 
sister or mother? I can't remember.&quot; &lt;She got it right, though. -- IED&gt; 
</p>



<p>THE FOG
</p>

<p> Featuring Kate's dad, the good doctor Bush, plus Nigel Kennedy and some 
wicked seagull imitations. It seems to be more about ponds and swimming pools 
than pea-soupers.
</p>

<p> &quot;It's about trying to grow up. Growing up for most people is just trying to stop 
escaping, looking at things inside yourself rather than outside. But I'm not sure if 
people ever grow up properly. It's a continual process, growing in a positive sense.&quot; 
</p>



<p>REACHING OUT
</p>

<p> &lt;Note that Kate apparently refused to comment at all to this moron about this 
song and Deeper Understanding. In IED's opinion this fact is a kind of warning to 
us about Kate's attitude toward this interview. -- IED&gt;
</p>

<p> After papa, Kate's &quot;reaching out for Mama&quot;. Another song about children 
beginning to experience the adult world. &quot;See how the child reaches out 
instinctively/To feel how fire will feel.&quot; Probably the least developed work on The 
Sensual World but it does have strange strings arranged by Michael Nyman. &lt;This is 
the kind of idiotic remark that IED most despises the British music press for 
making. How anyone could describe Reaching Out as &quot;the least developed 
work&quot;--whatever that means--is inconceivable to IED. And the airheaded follow-up 
(why are the strings &quot;strange&quot;, and why the &quot;but&quot;?) is all too typical, as well. 
Incidentally, the strings, Kate fans will notice, are arranged for exactly the same 
rather unusual configuration as the strings for Cloudbusting : string sextet. Kate 
described in some detail how she composed that string part--by creating the six 
&quot;voices&quot; on the Fairlight, and then getting someone in to transcribe them for strings. 
The chances are this is how these strings were arranged. -- IED&gt; 
</p>



<p>HEADS WE'RE DANCING
</p>

<p> I found it really funny, bit strange in a way... &lt;FUNNY? MORON!&gt;
</p>

<p> &quot;That's a very dark song, not funny at all!&quot;
</p>

<p> ' It was '39, before the music started. ' Did you write it to tie in with the war 
anniversary?
</p>

<p> &quot;No, purely coincidental. I wrote the song two years ago, and in lots of ways I 
wouldn't write a song like it now. I'd really hate it if people were offended by 
this...But it was all started by a family friend, years ago, who'd been to dinner and 
sat next to this guy who was really fascinating, so charming. They sat all night 
chatting and joking. And next day he found out it was Oppenheimer. And this friend 
was horrified because he really despised what the guy stood for.
</p>

<p> &quot;I understood the reaction, but I felt a bit sorry for Oppenheimer. He tried to 
live with what he'd done, and actually, I think, committed suicide.
</p>

<p> &quot;But I was so intrigued by this idea of my friend being so taken by this person 
until they knew who they were, and then it completely changing their attitude.
</p>

<p> &quot;So I was thinking, what if you met the Devil? The Ultimate One: charming, 
elegant, well spoken.
</p>

<p> &quot;Then it turned into this whole idea of a girl being at a dance and this guy 
coming up, cocky and charming, and she dances with him. Then a couple of days 
later she sees in the paper that it was Hitler. Complete horror: she was that close, 
perhaps could've changed history.
</p>

<p> &quot;Hitler was very attractive to women because he was such a powerful figure, yet 
such an evil guy. I'd hate to feel I was glorifying the situation, but I do know that 
whereas in a piece of film it would be quite acceptable, in a song it's a little bit 
sensitive.&quot; 
</p>



<p>DEEPER UNDERSTANDING
</p>

<p> Bizarrely balancing the ancient voices of Bulgaria with lyrics and effects from 
the computer age. Dark, lonely songs &lt;songs?&gt; about someone betrayed by humanity, 
finding solace in the friendship of a clever black box that sings like Sparky. 'As the 
people grow colder/I turn to my computer...I press Execute.' Bleak and disturbing, 
almost as morbid as some of her early creations &lt;Huh?&gt; and elevated by Yanka 
Rupkina's emotional solo. 
</p>



<p>BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN
</p>

<p> &quot;It's about a relationship being a very finely balanced thing that can be easily 
thrown off by a third party. The whole thing really came from a line in The 
Godfather, during some family argument, when Marlon Brando says, 'Don't 
interfere, it's between a man and a woman.' It's exploring the idea of trying to 
keep a relationship together, how outside forces can break into it...Rubbish really, 
but I quite like the cello.&quot; &lt;That's she said, folks...to this jerk interviewer, 
anyway...-- IED&gt; 
</p>



<p>NEVER BE MINE 
</p>

<p>&quot; Ooh, the thrill and the hurting... I know that this will never be mine. &quot;
</p>

<p> Kate and the Bulgars again, supported by Spillane's Irish piping.
</p>

<p> &quot;It's that whole thing of how, in some situations, it's the dream you want, not 
the real thing. It was pursuing a conscious realisation that a person is really enjoying 
the fantasy and aware it won't become reality. So often you think it's the end you 
want, but this is actually looking at the process that will never get you there. Bit of a 
heart-game you play with yourself.&quot; 
</p>



<p>ROCKET'S TAIL (For Rocket)
</p>

<p> &quot;Rocket's my cat, but it was written for the Bulgarian girls. Ridiculous collection 
of images, &lt;Just read the lyrics and you'll see immediately that Kate is deliberately 
deflecting the request for an explanation. This is not a &quot;ridiculous collection of 
images&quot;! -- IED&gt; nothing to do with Rocket, really. He just started it all off.
</p>

<p> &quot;At the time the only song I could think of that mentioned rockets was Rocket 
Man &lt;which, by the time she was working with the Bulgarians, Kate had already 
agreed to record a cover version of for the forthcoming Elton John/Bernie Taupin 
tribute album&gt;, but since then there have been about three of them. I feel a bit like 
the Python sketch with that guy making eight-millimetre films, saying, 'Hitchcock 
had his Rear Window out while mine was still at the chemists'.&quot; 
</p>



<p>THIS WOMAN'S WORK
</p>

<p> &quot;It was written for John Hughes's film, She's Having a Baby. Really light 
comedy about this young guy who gets married, very much a kid. His wife is 
pregnant and it's all right until they get to the hospital, and the baby's in the breach 
position.
</p>

<p> &quot;That's the sequence I had to write the song about, and it's really very moving, 
him in the waiting room, having flashbacks of his wife and him going for walks, 
decorating...It's exploring his sadness and guilt: suddenly it's the point where he 
has to grow up. He'd been such a wally up to this point.&quot; 
</p>



<p>WALK STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE
</p>

<p> The most positive &lt;Positive? Positive ?&gt; statement on The Sensual World, and 
featuring some of Kate's most remarkable vocals to date. Perhaps even an 
impression of a howler monkey?
</p>

<p> &quot;My mother thought it was a peacock--she was looking for a peacock, isn't that 
sweet? I fancied being Captain Beefheart at that point, and it just came to me: 
standing out, calling for help in the middle. It just went, 
'BBRRRROOOOAAAAAAAAA'.
</p>

<p> &quot;It's the idea of how our fear are sometimes holding us back, and yet there's 
really no need to be frightened. Like The Fog : being scared because the water's 
deep, you could be being scared because the water's deep, you could be drowned; 
drowned; but actually if you put your feet down the bottom's there and it's only 
waist high, so what's the problem? Just get on with it: that's what I'm trying to tell 
myself. .bf ital
</p>

<p> &quot;Walk Straight Down the Middle came together very quickly. It's about 
following either of two extremes, when you really want to plough this path straight 
down the middle. Rather than 'WAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH': being thrown from 
one end of the spectrum to the other. I'd like to think of myself as holding the 
centre, whereas in fact I'm--'WAAARRRRGGGGHHHH'--taking off all the 
time.&quot;
