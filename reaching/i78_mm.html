<P>(This article first appeared in Melody Maker, November 1978) 
</P>
<P>Kate: Enigma Variations <BR> by Harry Doherty 
</P>
<P>The enigma that is Kate Bush--it confuses us all. I've just read a bitter
character  assassination of Kate Bush (in another paper) and the central area of
complaint  around which this assault revolves is that Ms. Bush is &quot;nice&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;An hour or so in the company of Kate Bush,&quot; this enlightened
scribe considered,  &quot;is like being trapped for the duration in a very
wholesome TV show with definite  but unwarranted intellectual aspirations.&quot;

</P>
<P>I can understand that as a reaction to a well-mannered chance meeting, but 
really, had the writer listened attentively to her first album (regardless of
liking or  disliking it), I don't think he would have come to the same rash and
puerile  conclusion. 
</P>
<P>Actually, Kate Bush scares me, for a combination of reasons. The first is
the  diplomatic pleasantness and awesome logic she displays in interviews, but
that is only  one dimension--she is, in fact, a &quot;nice&quot; person. It is
when that initial impact is paired  with the multifarious intensity of her music
that I start to quiver. 
</P>
<P>The contrast is eerie, and frightening. In the studio, living out her
imaginative  fantasies, kate Bush is strickien by a rush of surrealism, and
suddenly a range of  weird personalities are displayed. It is a subconsciousness
that was evident on her  first album, The Kick Inside, and it is captured to an
even greater extent on  Lionheart, the sequel now released. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Nice&quot; is not a word I'd turn to to describe the consequences. The
songwriting,  the singing, the arrangements, the production have the mark of a
singular  personality. Kate Bush's music is more like a confrontation. At times,
it makes the  listener feel uneasy and insecure. Kate's approach to her work is
marked by an  obstinate refusal to compromise in any way, so she does not make
it easy for the  listener to get into the music. To begin with, it's a
challenge. 
</P>
<P>Because, then, it's difficult to appreciate full Kate Bush's music (and who,
after  all, is she to make such demands?)--compounded with the fact that she
seems to  have the Midas touch--she is set up for criticism, which must make it
all the more  fulfilling to carry off two awards in the MM Poll. Even when told
of her  performance in the Poll, Kate girlishly enthuses: &quot;That's
wonderful! Fantastic!  Incredible!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Nice. 
</P>
<P>The success of The Kick Inside and its hit singles ( Wuthering Heights and
The  Man With the Child in His Eyes) was as much a hindrance as a help when the
time  came for Kate Bush to record a second album. As she has said before, the
terms of  reference were suddenly overturned. Instead of a rising talent, she is
now a risen  talent--and anything less than an emulation of the initial success
will be interpreted  as a failure. It's a pressure, though, that she can live
with. 
</P>
<P>There are similarities to the debut album. Lionheart is produced once more
by  Andrew Powell and, generally, the musicians who did the honours on The Kick 
Inside are recalled. Kate wants the connections between her first and second
album  to stop there. 
</P>
<P>For instance, her own band makes a slight contribution to the new album,
being  featured on two of the tracks, Wow and Kashka From Baghdad, and had it
not been  for a mix-up in the organisation, might have made a heavier
contribution. It is, it  appears, a sensitive situation, and one that Kate
doesn't care to dwell upon, but she's  still determined that, eventually, her
own band--Charlie Morgan (drums), Brian Bath  (guitars), Del Palmer (bass),
Paddy Bush (mandolin)--will play a more prominent  part in the recording
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>On the subject of producing, it's significant that Kate is accredited as
assistant  producer and so is acknowledged as playing an active role in mixing
the sound as  well as performing. She takes an immense interest in recording
techniques and  states intentions to pursue ambitions in that area. There was,
however, a problem in  communication when she was involved in the production and
her lack of professional  lingo for various methods of recording often led to
confusion and amusement in the  studio. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I feel I know what I'm talking about in the studio now. I know what I
should  hear. The reaction to me explaining what I want in the studio was
amusement, to a  certain extent. The were all taking the piss out of me a bit.&quot;

</P>
<P>Overall, Bush was concerned that the new album should differ quite radically
 from her first. &amp;ocq.Maybe I'm a bit too close to it at the moment, but I
find it much  more adventurous than the last one. I'm much happier with the
songs and the  arrangements and the backing tracks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was getting a bit worried about labels from that last album:
everything being  soft, airy-fairy. That was great for the time, but it's not
really what I want to do  now, or what I want to do, say, in the next year. I
guess I want to get basically  heavier in the sound sense...and I think that's
on the way, which makes me really  happy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't really think that there are any songs on the album that are as
close to .bf  ital Wuthering Heights .pf as there were on the last one. I mean,
there's lots of  songs people could draw comparison with. I want the first
single that comes out  from this album to be reasonably up-tempo. &lt;The first
single was Hammer Horror .&gt;  That's the first thing I'm concerned with,
because I want to break away from what  has previously gone. I'm not pleased
with being associated with such soft, romantic  vibes, not for the first single
anyway. If that happens again, that's what I will be to  everyone.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She is acutely aware of the danger of being pigeon-holed, and is actively
engaged  in discouraging that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If you can get away with it and keep changing, great. I think it
should be done  because in that way you'll always have people chasing after you
trying to find out  what you're doing. And, anyway, if you know what's coming
next, what's the  point? If I really wanted to, I guess I could write a song
that would be so similar to  Wuthering Heights . But I don't. What's the point?
I'd rather write a song that  was really different, that I liked, although it
might not get anywhere.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you heard her new single, Hammer Horror ? Now that's really different. 
</P>
<P>The major changes in the preparation for Lionheart was undoubtedly that
Kate,  over-burdened with promotional schemes for the first album, was for the
first time  left with the unsavoury prospect of meeting deadlines and (perhaps)
having to rush  her writing to do that. It was a problem she was having trouble
coming to terms  with at our last meeting, when she spoke in obvious admiration
of bands like  Queen--who came up with the goods on time every year, and still
found time to  conduct world tours. 
</P>
<P>But Kate insisted that she wasn't going to be rushed, and eventually the
songs  came along. In all, it took ten weeks to record the twelve tracks (ten
are on the  album), an indication of the meticulousness shown by Bush herself in
exercising as  much control as possible over every facet of the work. &quot;I'm
not always right, and I  know I'm not,&quot; she says, &quot;but it's important
to know what's going on, even if I'm  not controlling it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I'll be interested to read the reviews of Lionheart . It'll be sad, I think,
if the  album is greeted with the same sort of insulting indifference that The
Kick Inside  met, when Kate Bush was pathetically underrated. 
</P>
<P>Lionheart is, as the artist desired, a heavier album than its predecessor,
with  Bush setting some pretty exacting tests for the listener. Kate's
songwriting is that  much more mature, and her vocal performance has an even
more vigorous sense of  drama. 
</P>
<P>Musically, the tracks on Lionheart are more carefully structured than
before.  There is, for instance, a distinct absence of straight songs, like the
first album's  Moving, Saxophone Song, The Man With the Child in His Eyes and
The Kick Inside .  Here, only Oh England, My Lionheart makes an immediate
impression and I'm not  sure that the move away from soft ballads (be it to
secure a separate image) is such a  wise one. As Bush proved on those songs on
The Kick Inside, simplicity can also have  its own sources of complication. 
</P>
<P>There is much about this album that is therapeutic, and often Kate Bush is
the  subject of her own course. Fullhouse is the most blatant example of that. &lt;There
is  no evidence that this song is autobiographical.&gt; On of the album's three 
unspectacular tracks musically (along with, in my opinion, In the Warm Room and 
Kashka From Baghdad ), it is still lyrically a fine example of ridding the brain
of  dangerous paranoias. The stabbing verse of &quot;Imagination sets in,/Then
all the voices  begin,/Telling you things that aren't happening/(But the nig and
they nag, 'til  they're under your skin)&quot; is set against the soothing
chorus: &quot;You've really got  to/Remember yourself,/You've got a fullhouse in
your head tonight,/Remember  yourself,/Stand back and see emotion getting you
uptight.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Even Fullhouse is mild, though, when compared to tracks like Symphony in
Blue,  In the Warm Room and Kashka From Baghdad, which exude an unashamed 
sensuality. Symphony in Blue, the opening track, is a hypnotic ballad with the
same  sort of explicit sexual uninhibitiveness as Feel It from the first album.
&quot;The more I  think about sex,/The better it gets,/Here we have a purpose in
life,/Good for the  blood circulation,/Good for releasing the tension./The root
of our reincarnation,&quot;  sings Kate happily. 
</P>
<P>In Search of Peter Pan, Wow (running together on the first side) and Hammer 
Horror are are examples of Kate's strange ability to let the subconscious mind
run  amok in the studio. Wow is tantalisingly powerful and Hammer Horror (the
single)  is most impressive for the way it seems to tie in so many of the finer
points of the  first album and project them through one epic song. 
</P>
<P>That leaves three tracks, Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake, Oh
England,  My Lionheart, and Coffee Homeground . All of them with totally
contrasting  identieds but all succeeding in areas that many might have
considered outside the  scope of Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>A few months ago, in the paper, Kate said how one of her musical ambitions
was  to write a real rousing rock'n'roll song and how difficult she found that
task. James  and the Cold Gun was her effort on The Kick Inside, and with Don't
Push Your  Foot on the Heartbrake she has tackled the art of writing a roasting
rocker on her  own terms. Heartbrake (another piece of emotional therapy) might
not be  considered a rocker in the traditional sense of racing from start to
finish but it's still  one of the most vicious pieces of rock I've stumbled
across in some time. The  chorus is slow, pedestrianly slow. The pace is
deceiving. It slides into the chorus.  Bush moves into a jog. Then the second
part of the chorus. It's complete havoc, and  when it comes to repeating that
second part in the run-up to the end, Kate  wrenches from her slight frame a
screaming line of unbelievably consummate  rock'n'roll power that astounded me.
A rather unnerving turn to Kate's music, I  think. 
</P>
<P>Then there's Coffee Homeground, influenced by Bertold Brecht and inspired by
 a journey with a taxi driver who was convinced that somebody was out to poison 
him. 
</P>
<P>For Oh England, My Lionheart, from which the album title is derived, Kate is
 expecting a barrage of criticism because of the blatant soppiness of the lyric.

</P>
<P>Kate's reasons for writing the song are simple enough. She had always liked 
Jerusalem, and thought that a contemporary song proclaiming the romantic beauty 
of England should be written. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A lot of people could easily say that the song is sloppy. It's very
classically done.  It's only got acoustic instruments on it and it's
done...almost madrigally, you know. I  daresay a lot of people will think that
it's just a load of old slush, but it's just an  area that I think it's good to
cover. Everything I do is very English, and I think  that's one reason I've
broken through to a lot of countries. The English vibe is very  appealing.&quot;
