<BR> Subject: Hi Fi for Pleasure by David Aldridge Aug. 1983
</P>
<P>The following article is from *Hi Fi for Pleasure*, August 1983. I have
typed it in  to satisfy IED: 
</P>
<P> DIGITAL DREAMING 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's `The Dreaming' was digitally mastered. It provided the sound
that  she wanted but next time she'll probably opt for analogue processing.
David  Aldridge asks her why. 
</P>
<P>Five years ago, when a young unknown named Kate Bush vocally roller-coasted 
her way through the weird 'n' wonderful `Wuthering Heights', few critics rated 
her as more than yet another addition to the swollen ranks of pop's one-hit 
wonders. 
</P>
<P>Which just goes to show what we know. 
</P>
<P>It's now 1983, and the delightful doctor's daughter from Dulwich in South 
London has established herself as easily Britian's most adventurous and exciting
 female singer-songwriter. 
</P>
<P>But she's not been content to confine herself to establishing a star
reputation in  just those two major areas of today's music. Kate's also
displayed an increasing  interest in, and sophisticated awareness of, the
potential of production techniques  over the years. To the extent that she
effectively produced her most recent album,  `The Dreaming' (on EMI) herself --
and significantly, it proved to be her most  `produced' album to date. 
</P>
<P>The recording sessions were digitally mixed -- a pop practice that's
increasingly  common these days. Interestingly, though, shortly after `The
Dreaming' was in the  can, Kate was approached by the tech team from the
pro-analogue, anti-digital Linn  Products. 
</P>
<P>They'd heard of Kate's production interests, and decided the time was ripe
to  demonstrate to an influential industry superstar just how superior properly
handled  analogue recording could be. 
</P>
<P>And the word that filtered through to us from Linn -- who operate their own 
super-analogue recording label -- was that the lovely little lady was mighty 
impressed by the analogue-vs-digital dem they had laid on for her. So we thought
 we'd go straight to the horse's mouth and find out whether that had indeed been
 the case. It was -- sort of! 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wouldn't say that I was necessarily impressed by their
demonstration,&quot; Kate  Bush told Hi Fi for Pleasure. &quot;But yes, I feel
that there's an awful lot in analogue  recording. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We had a lot of problems working with digital for `The Dreaming' which
was  digitally mixed. Editing was the main one -- it was so time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Some things obviously were easier working digitally -- otherwise we
wouldn't  have used it. But the vast majority I reckon would have been easier on
tape.  Particularly as I was working with people who'd worked with tape all
their life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;In the end we brought in a guy who was familiar with digital equipment
from  classical recordings he'd worked on. And it didn't take very long after
that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But the problems rather put me off digital. We all felt a kind of
alienation from  the process of creation using it. There's something reassuring
about a tape that you  can see and touch. You've more trust in it somehow. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There was a feeling of uneasiness about using digital that stemmed
from the fact  that we felt it wasn't as easy to use in many respects as tape
is.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate is firmly convinced that there's plenty of life left in analogue
recording yet,  despite the pro-digital brigade who reckon its days are already
numbered. &quot;For one  thing,&quot; she added, &quot;there's an awful lot of
really good analogue recording equipment  around. And many studios I know of
have sounded out digital gear, and opted to stay  with analogue. Certainly it's
the way I personally reckon I'll be recording in the  future.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We talked more about her production of `The Dreaming'. &quot;The fact that I
was  handling that side of things automatically caused me a great deal of
concern because  I was responsible then for the complete finished product. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Before we decided to work with digital, we did a comparison test
between  analogue and digital, and all of us involved in the making of the album
just felt that  we couldn't really detect any difference except for a slight
crystallised sound off of  the digital. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We did a lot of comparisons and we felt that, for the kind of music
that was  happening, that was a nice sound quality to have. Quite honestly, if
it hadn't been  for that subtle difference we'd have stuck with analogue. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We'd certainly have stuck with it if we'd known the practical problems
we'd  encounter using digital. However, by the time we did encounter them, we
were too  far advanced with it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sorry we tried digital. But in the future I'd certainly prefer
to work  with analogue.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So, no beating about the Bush. That's Kate's opinion about digital. OK
sonically  in theory, but something of a problem-poser in practical use. So, on
balance, it's  analogue that gets her vote. 
</P>
<P>A fact which'll no doubt enliven the Linn pro-analogue camp no end. 
</P>
<P>&lt;End of article.&gt;
