<P>KATE BUSH packed London's Palladium with 2000 fans  on five consecutive
nights and proved to the cynical  critics that not only is she an
individualistic singer but  an accomplished entertainer as well.</P>
<P>It was a Kate Bush that no one had seen before.</P>
<P>The 20-year-old, whose weird sound made her Britain's top  female pop star
almost overnight and earned her international  acclaim, gave one of the most
enthralling shows ever seen in  London, putting to shame other rock stars who
rely on electronic  wizardry or just pure volume win over an audience. </P>
<P>The intricately-planned show low was the product of six months'  intensive
preparation. Kate rehearsed up to 12 hours a day with  15 members of the band,
back up singers and dancers.</P>
<P>To a fanfare of publicity, she exploded into London as the most  theatrical
new singing star in years. </P>
<P>She took over the stage, in fact the whole Palladium, with her  first
assured step -- a waif-like, elfin figure in tight satin jeans.</P>
<P>Her voice pierced the auditorium with the bewitching quality  of the wind
shrieking across Wuthering Heights. </P>
<P>Like Liza Minnelli, Kate relied not so much on her voice, which  sometimes
is quite thin and superficial, but on the drama with  which she stages her
evocative songs.</P>
<P>Magicians performed balancing tricks on stage, and violinists, dressed like
black jesters, pranced in the background as she  switched from seductress in
blue jeans to gypsy in a scarlet  skirt in a &quot;completely hypnotic
theatrical ritual.</P>
<P>It was an acrobatic, effervescent melodramatic and sometime  times macabre
performance -- a 2 1/2 hour spectacle of back  projection sets, lighting and
theatrical effects, costing $3OO,OOO*  which was shared by Kate and record
company, EMI.</P>
<P>She left no doubt that theatrically, she could develop into  the superstar
class.</P>
<P>It is an amazing feat, considering that the world only first  knew of her
just 16 months ago when she became a  household name courtesy of Wuthering
Heights, her  first single. The song she wrote was inspired by Emily  Bronte's
romantic novel of the same name, and she  sang it in a voice not unlike that of
a newly-neutered  cat letting the world know of its unfortunate predicament.
