Oct 11, 1980 
</P>
<P>Never For Ever Debut 
</P>
<P>w/Peter Powell, Radio 1 
</P>
<P>Oct 11, 1980 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Peter has an annoying habit of not actually
completing  sentences.] 
</P>
<P>I: So it's four thirty two, and the first thing she asked for when she came
in the  studios was, please, just a cup of tea, that's all. So that's what we
got it started  out with. Her name is Kate Bush and it's great. But she was on
Round table show  a while ago, so perhaps one TV [??? inaudible] on Radio 1 has
had a talk. But,  have you heard the new album? The answer in no, because nor
have I as yet. So  Never For Ever is the LP, some tracks and some words from
Kate right after this. 
</P>
<P>[Violin is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Lovely, great. Violin is the track off the new LP Never For Ever. Katie,
welcome to  the studio. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you, it's nice to be here. 
</P>
<P>I: You are quite a welcome guest on Radio 1 anytime, needless to say. 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] Oh, thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: Especially when you got this new album in your hand, thank you very much
for  bringing it in, Never For Ever. And there's a great line in that album. Let
me just  read the notes on the inside of the album, &quot;Give me the Banshees
for B.V.s.&quot;  Immediately I looked at that and I thought, Susie and The
Banshees, Kate Bush,  doesn't work [Kate Laughs]. What is that about? 
</P>
<P>K: Well unfortunately, [??? inaudible] great for using such words like this.
I mean,  for instance, &quot;it's the police&quot; has a completely different
meaning now because of  the group called The Police. And I'm referring to the
original Banshees who are,  in fact sort of, [??? Fran. St. Tars] from Ireland,
who would only cry when death  was eminent. And so it's just meant to be very
eerie creatures singing the  backing vocals. 
</P>
<P>I: Talking about eerie creatures, on the back cover of the album there's
some  pictures of you doing a sort of floating pose of yours [York ???], with
your tongue  hanging out, wearing sort of bat clothes. [Kate laughs] That is
quite a cover. I  mean, and it is so very important to you, isn't it, sorta of
the art of music. This  album, is it a concept or... how do you see it? 
</P>
<P>K: No, it's not a concept but all the songs are very different, that's
really why it's  not a concept. But they are joined together in as much each
track is trying to  flow into the other, although they're quite separate
entities, they're about  different subjects. And the cover was terribly
important because I do feel with  home taping, etc., happening, you have to give
people as much as you can on an  album. And it's something I've always wanted to
buy, I've always wanted to go  in and buy an album I've been waiting for. And
you hold the cover and you think  &quot;oh, this is it!,&quot; you know, and you
sorta plow through it for any little bit of  information. And so that's what
I've tried to do and we've got the most  incredible artists... 
</P>
<P>I: I can see, it's brilliant actually. I mean it's almost like a sort of
child's book but  using very adult sort of.... adult paintings, adult drawings,
isn't it, for the cover? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it's pencil, it's incredible. 
</P>
<P>I: What about inspiration for the tracks and the music, where do you get
most of  your inspiration for you music? 
</P>
<P>K: They come from very different sources, but it is mainly people. Things
people  will say, whether they say then on television or to me personally or
even things I  hear on the radio. It's very much stimulus from other people and
just the way I  feel about things that I see in other people, because I'm
involved with people all  the time, they come in and out of my life. But the
thing that is a continuing  theme, you know, is life, people. 
</P>
<P>I: There's on or two quite big names actually who are mentioned on the
sleeves of  the album, Roy Harper, Herbie Flowers, Peter Gabriel. Are they just
friends,  admirers, or helped it musically, or what? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, they're probably all of those that you mentioned, they're very
important to  me, those people. Peter I did some work with and he was very
inspiring and it  was very important for me to write something as a gesture. Roy
is on the album.  Roy I think is one of the true English poets and so he
definitely needed  something said. And Herbie Flowers, he's a very special man,
because he makes  everyone so happy. 
</P>
<P>I: Um, that's good. And thats something the atmosphere of the album gets
across, a  brief listen that I've had. And I think it would be nice to turn to
another track. I  think though with your music it's not just the music about you
it's also the whole  motion, it's mime and motion. In a track which I'd like to
play, which I believe,  correct me if I'm wrong, Army Dreamers is going to be
the next single, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it is. Yes, indeed. 
</P>
<P>I: It's got a sort of waltz feel to it - Three, four, quick, quick, slow,
slow - isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it is a waltz. It was based very much on traditional music, the
stuff that I was  brought up on as a kid. So it's deliberately like that, it's
very acoustic. 
</P>
<P>I: Alright, we'll play it now and talk about it afterwards. This is Army
Dreamers. 
</P>
<P>[Army Dreamers is played] 
</P>
<P>I: ... a gentler track yet with the [??? slavonic] discipline, Army
Dreamers. With a  bit of discipline there involved. I must admit that this is
quite a track. That  must... is that one of your favorites... to be the single?

</P>
<P>K: Yes, it is. It's hard to like tracks that you create because they seem so
old so  quickly and it almost becomes a sort of objective thing where you've
just become  very close to it, so you do like it. But it's very hard to actually
say you like or you  don't like your own music, it's a very strange thing
because it's so personal. 
</P>
<P>I: Having said that though, you actually did state while that was playing,
it was so  good to hear your tracks being played on the radio, at last... 
</P>
<P>K: It's wonderful. It is, it's really exciting because it's been so long
since I've had  an album and this has been finished for nearly three months now
and it's so good  to actually see it moving, it's lovely. 
</P>
<P>I: My first reaction listening to that track, was actually to ask you if
you'd kindly  have a waltz in the studio which is unfortunately to small. 
</P>
<P>K: There's no room, I would, I'd love to! [Both laugh] 
</P>
<P>I: I mean, this whole sort of... the whole music, the concept of your music,
and also  the energy and the activity that you're involved with it - the
choreography  involved, though, is so... it's such an important part, obviously,
of your whole  show. And have you ever thought of doing ballet? Have you ever
done ballet, I  mean have you ever sort of get into a musical, something like
that? 
</P>
<P>K: I did ballet for a year, on and off, when I was at my dancing school. And
I found  it very hard to actually get on with the people in the room, that was
really my big  problem. It's such an important thing for a dancer because it is
the classical  basics and there's no way [of] getting around it. You know, if
you want to have  good technique, then you really do have to do ballet. And so
for many technical  points I'm not really correct when I dance. But I do feel
that dance is something  that is very free and you can't tie it down. It's
techniques, but it's also emotion  and for me the emotion is the thing that
really matters. You can have technique,  you know, that's superb and yet be as
flat as a board. And yet, there are children  that have never trained at
dancing, and yet they make you want to cry, because  they move like angels.
They're beautiful, they're so free and they're just purely  stating what they're
feeling and it's so delightful because they're enjoying  everything they do. And
I think that's what dance is about, the enjoyment of that  feeling of movement
and freedom, it's like suddenly breaking through a barrier. 
</P>
<P>I: Because with some bands it's aggravation which they get off on, with
their music,  but with you it really is emotion coming out. And that is the sort
of plus to your  music, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I think all music is emotion and aggression is very strong emotion.
I think  every record that is made has an emotion in it and that's why people
like it.  Whether it's a basic pulse - it still creates an emotion in the
listener and I think  that is what music is. 
</P>
<P>I: If people went to see your stage show and your tour show a while ago,
actually  quite a long time ago isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, doesn't it fly! [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Quite some months. And if they seen sorta videos of you on television and
they've  seen you playing your music and also the amount of energy you put into
your  stage show, and the choreography involved. It's almost quite... it tires
you out, to  a certain extent. How do you manage to keep fit? How do you manage
to sing  AND dance? 
</P>
<P>K: It is a big problem, it's something that you do have to work up to
because the  movement takes up a great deal of breath and the singing takes up
as much so  you literally need twice as much breath to handle it. And it was
really just  working up to it, stamina. I mean when I began the first few weeks
of my  training I would never have been able to do that whole show, I'd have
just passed  out in the middle of it. I mean [makes running out of breath
noises] half the  songs. And it's really just the adjustment and also adrenaline
because once  you're up there you just cannot do anything wrong, if you do
you're letting down  all the people that have come to see you. And that's what
performing is all about,  you have to die for them. And so I think probably
rather than going [repeats  breathing sound] I'd hold my breath and die rather
than show it, you know. It  does become a performance once your up there, and
things tighten up that you  never thought would. 
</P>
<P>I: And in the studio as well when you're putting down tracks, when you get
so much  feeling in your voice? 
</P>
<P>K: Thats.. It's very much a psyching up thing, it's the same on stage - to
become  the person that singing the song, and they are often very different
people. And so  if you can feel the role of that person you've got sort of half
way through the  problems, you just have to then carry it through. It's actually
placing that role at  the moment in time that is really the initial move. 
</P>
<P>I: Um, do you want to hear another track off the album? 
</P>
<P>K: I do. 
</P>
<P>I: Never For Ever. She dying to. [Both Laughs] Back home, she's dyeing to
hear it.  The Infant Kiss, a quick story about that. 
</P>
<P>K: The Infant Kiss. I don't know if anyone's seen a film called The
Innocents, it  initially inspired it. It's an old British film, a very haunting
film about a governess  who goes to stay and look after two children, a young
boy and a young girl. And  unknown to her, they're both possessed by the spirits
that lived in the before,  the gardener and a maid. And particulary the boy is
in a very, very heavy  possession state, he has a.. like a thirty two year old
man inside him as a spirit.  And the governess will go to give him a little
goodnight and he suddenly gives her  a very big passionate kiss. And the song is
about the woman being incredibly  torn, she doesn't what's happening because
there's this really sweet little boy  that she loves maternally and yet through
his eyes there's coming this really  wicked, lusty man. And so she can't work
out what's happening, she thinks  she's going mad when in fact there is this
terribly evil force in such a young child  that could never have this experience
through his own age. And so she's just  freaking out saying &quot;my God, what's
happening.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>K: And it was a distortion that I myself would find terribly disturbing... 
</P>
<P>I: And me.. 
</P>
<P>K: And I really love distortions. 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, so lets here the track. 
</P>
<P>[The Infant Kiss and Night Scented Stock are played] 
</P>
<P>I: Hm. There is a certain fascination for children in many of your songs.
That was  the Infant Kiss, with Night Scented Stock to follow... 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Which you particularly wanted us to play. Ah, it's almost classical,
isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think it is. That's probably why I'm fond of it because it's a new
area.  And I love music without words when it works because it suddenly becomes
so  much freer, it's like landscapes moving around you and I've always wanted to
 work in a musical area sometimes rather than always putting lyrics to my songs.

</P>
<P>I: I should add that Babooshka and Breathing are both included on the album.

</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Babooshka, which was a surprisingly big hit after quite a slow start, it
did take a  little bit of time didn't? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it did. It was climbing up there quite slowly at the front, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: And the story behind Babooshka very quickly because everyone was saying
it's  Russian for grandmother, yes? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, well apparently it is grandmother, it's also a headdress that people
wear. But  when I wrote the song it was just a name that literally came into my
mind, I've  presumed I've got it from a fairy story I'd read when I was a child.
And after  having written the song a series of incredible coincidences happened
where I'd  turned on the television and there was Donald Swan singing about
Babooshka. So  I thought, &quot;well, there's got to be someone who's actually
called Babooshka.&quot; So  I was looking through Radio Times and there, another
coincidence, there was an  opera called Babooshka. Apparently she was the lady
that the three kings went to  see because the star stopped over her house and
they thought &quot;Jesus is in there.&quot;  So they went in and he wasn't. And
they wouldn't let her come with them to  find the baby and she spent the rest of
her life looking for him and she never  found him. And also a friend of mine had
a cat called Babooshka. [He laughs] So  these really extraordinary things that
kept coming up when in fact it was just a  name that came into my head at the
time purely because it fitted. 
</P>
<P>I: With lots of sorta family ties involved in your music - Man With The
Child In His  eyes, I mentioned, The Infant Kiss. Are you part of a large family
or are you...? 
</P>
<P>K: I'm part of a close family and I suppose I'm very aware of the emotional
factors  involved. I think families are something that used to be very, very
important and  now, probably to do with the cities and the race of life, they
split up very quickly.  It's much more an independent lifestyle. But families
are very interesting  because it is a structure and from structures all sorts of
things can happen. 
</P>
<P>I: You can't beat a close family though, can you, really? I mean a close
family is like  a central point to bounce back to when things are... when
there's trouble and  things like that? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you... With your family, in particular, I mean obviously they've took
an  enormous interest in your career as such, do they help you out with a lot of
the  pressures involved? Because there must be, for a lady, for instance with
male  adoration which you must feel a considerable amount of. And I've met some
of  your fans, who are very, very, very pleasant people, but absolutely on a
real cult  following. How do you cope with that? 
</P>
<P>K: It's something that I'm not that aware of, you know. I think people
around me  would probably be aware of that more. When you are actually the
source there's  lots of things you don't realize are happening. And also when
you meet people  face to face, which is the time you get to hear stuff, they
behave very differently,  I think. And I've not really had any trouble from any
of the guys that are fans, in  fact they've been so helpful, they're wonderful.
They say great things, they  write wonderful letters. 
</P>
<P>I: Protective element, almost. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, maybe. Although I'm not so sure about the protectiveness, but I
really  appreciate that people are so good to me. 
</P>
<P>I: So when do you go out to meet them again? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know, I want to tour again, but it is a very big decision and it
involves  such a large amount of time and money that I have to be very careful
with the  decision. 
</P>
<P>I: How do you plan to promote the album then? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I'm doing general promotion. And I do feel that there's something
about  records, because it's music it has its own life. And there are people
that are  totally unknown and the single goes out, well it happened with me I
was  unknown, Wuthering Heights went out, I didn't really do any promotion until
it  was up there. Songs have their own life and I think they do whatever they
want.  You can have all the forces you want against a song going but if it's
needed to get  there, it will. It does its own thing. 
</P>
<P>I: And when it comes down to it, it really is just the black vinyl that the
song.... 
</P>
<P>K: I think it is. And if people want to hear the music then the record does
it by  itself. 
</P>
<P>I: Lovely, well it's a great album Kate. I've listened to it fleetingly and
I look  forward back at home listening to it in more depth and detail. Never For
Ever  from Kate Bush. Would you say it's your best yet? 
</P>
<P>K: I'd like to think it was, yes. I feel so much happier with it then I have
with any of  the others, it's like the first album again. It's like the new step
and that's very  important for me. 
</P>
<P>I: You're dying to hear another track, aren't you? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I'd love to. 
</P>
<P>I: We'll play Delius, OK? 
</P>
<P>K: Great. 
</P>
<P>I: Best wishes to you Kate, thanks very much for coming into the studio. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: Bye, bye. 
</P>
<P>[Delius is played] 
</P>
<P>K: And that was Delius and I've only got fifteen seconds to fill in before
Peter goes  on the news so I'd like to say why don't we all just think of Kid
Jensen all those  miles away across the world and wish him a bit of luck in his
new job.  [Whispers] Bye, bye. 
</P>
<P>I: Great idea. That's nice. Thank you, Kate.
