</P>
<P>Well, my darlings, what a surprise I got at the ever-so-quiet  and tasteful
Kate Bush end-of-tour party at the swish Dial 9  Club last week!</P>
<P>Of course we all expected to get fed my dears -- and I'm sure  that the
willowy Kate (20) was no exception -- but why did  the capitalist carnivores of
EMI Records (whose beano it  was) have to emphasise their tastelessness by
providing  a full meat buffet for their guest? Surely they know by  now that the
doctor's daughter is a confirmed vegetarian  (and very good she looks on it
too!)</P>
<P>Apart from that the party was a wonderful success, if a little  devoid of
rock'n'roll &quot;excitement&quot; (pie fights,  drinks fights, fist fights,
that sort of thing) as Kate and her  entire family smiled happily in the
bordello-like gloom. </P>
<P>&quot;I was feeling just a little tired tonight,&quot; confessed  an
ever-radiant Ms Bush, although no signs of such a condition  were visible.</P>
