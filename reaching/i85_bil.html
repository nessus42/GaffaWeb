<P>Top 40 Success At Last 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush Ascends U.S. Hill 
</P>
<P>From Billboard, Dec. 14 1985 
</P>
<P>By Kathy Gillis 
</P>
<P> NEW YORK With the single &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and the album &quot;Hounds
Of  Love&quot; now in the top 40 of their respective charts, Kate Bush has leapt
into a far  brighter spotlight than she's ever been under in this country. 
</P>
<P>But Bush's success here has hardly been achieved overnight. Bush signed with
 EMI in England in 1976 and released a number of albums there from 1978 through 
this year's &quot;Hounds Of Love.&quot; While not all her recordings were
released  domestically by EMI America, critical acclaim slowly built up in this
country as well. 
</P>
<P>Still, Bush hadn't been to the States since a 1979 appearance on &quot;Saturday
Night  Love [Live].&quot; With the current success of the album, she's on a
promotional tour  which will take her to Canada as well as New York. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really had no reason to come here to promote a record until now,&quot;
she says.  &quot;Obviously promotion is a helpful thing, but unless the music is
being picked up by  people, there's nothing I can do. In a way my time is
wasted. I'd rather be working  on the next album at home.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Since she's acting as her own manager, Bush can implement that decision as
well  as her decision not to tour. She hasn't been on the road since she
released her  second album in England. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not planning a tour,&quot; she says. &quot;It's an incredible
commitment. Once you're  committed, you're really talking about a year's worth
of effort. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Also, so many other things that I want to do wouldn't get done. Now
that I'm at  the end of this album, there are other things I'd like to do, like
getting to another  album and maybe experimenting with some visual ideas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush has been more than experimenting with visual presentations during most
of  her career. In addition to working on her own videos, she studied dance with
mime  artist Lindsay Kemp. 
</P>
<P>&quot;To see a group of people working to music without saying anything I
found  incredibly moving and very, very interesting,&quot; she says. &quot;I
thought that if  [movement] was combined with music, it could be a very
interesting way of visually  expressing yourself. It was through [this] that I
decided to take up dancing.&quot; Bush  has choreographed her own videos from
the start, and has enjoyed a growing  involvement in other aspects of video
production, from working on storyboards to  having a hand in editing. 
</P>
<P>She has been her own producer for the past few albums, and completed 
construction of her own studio in England before recording &quot;Hounds Of Love.&quot;
As  yet unnamed, the studio is a luxury she's not anxious to share. Nor does she
wish to  share her production skills. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm working on my own things,&quot; she says, &quot;I summon up a
kind of  confidence from somewhere that in a way is quite blind and has faith in
the thing  turning out in the end. I don't get very nervous about it. But I
think working on  other people's material, I'd have to feel certain that I could
help or I'd just be so  nervous, I could just ruin it for them. If I don't have
enough confidence in  something, my nerves really do get in the way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush suggests that a number of elements in her style have flourished on &quot;Hounds
 Of Love,&quot; especially her rhythmic sense. &quot;Consistency of rhythm is
what's happening  on this album. Rhythm has always attracted me, but it has
taken me time to  understand it and come to terms with it in music.&quot;
