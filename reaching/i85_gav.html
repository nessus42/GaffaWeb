    Alongside Joni Mitchell (who will be featured 
    in an upcoming Gavin interview) and jazz 
    artist Carla Bley, Kate Bush takes her place as 
    a female artist totally involved in the outcome 
    of her craft, both on a musical level and a 
    technical level. Starting out as a 
    pianist/songwriter, Kate Bush has since 
    evolved into producing her own material as 
    well as maintaining a commanding skill over 
    the Fairlight Computer Music Instrument. 
    About the only delicate and demure aspect 
    found in her music is the sacred subject of 
    love and deep feelings. Beyond that, her music, 
    as illustrated on her Hounds of Love LP, can range 
    from poetic sophistication to hellish tribal 
    fury. We spoke just as her latest album and 
    single, &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; began 
    receiving enthusiastic airplay on both Album 
    and Alternative, as well as Top Forty, radio. 
    Past works include four other albums: The 
    Kick Inside, Lionheart, Never For Ever, and 
    The Dreaming, plus a host of international hit 
    singles.
    
    




<p><p>KZ: Why was Hounds Of Love split into two
different segments-Hounds Of Love and The 
    Ninth Wave ? 

<p>KB: They're two very separate 
    entities for me. The second side is a concept 
    and the other side is really to balance the weight 
    of the concept with five separate songs. In a 
    way, they're all linked by love as a theme.
    
    They're all forms of love songs. The concept side 
    was something I'd really wanted to do for a while. 
    I've always felt that music, in a way, greatly 
    complements, when it's done in an involved way, 
    like classical pieces of music that last, say, 
    twenty minutes. I've never really been brave 
    enough to go through it before. I just felt I had 
    something that grasped my creative juices enough 
    to get into a story that would last half an hour. 
    But, at the same time, I felt, to turn that into a 
    whole album would be too risky if the thing didn't 
    work. It was
    
    &quot;The hounds of love are 
    coming to rip you to pieces, 
    and you're scared, so you 
    run. You have to get away 
    from them.&quot;
    
    extremely interesting for me to write seven songs 
    (the whole of The Ninth Wave) that were all linked 
    together. It was very demanding and, I think, 
    relatively successful. 

<p>KZ: Reading through the
    lyrics of the single, &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; 
    I'm wondering what you were trying to 
    communicate? 

<p>KB: It's about the difficulty of a 

    





    relationship between a man and a woman when 
    they really love each other very deeply and how, 
    in a way, the love is something that's much larger 
    than either of them. It causes lots of problems. If 
    they could only swap places
    with each other, if that was something that was 
    possible, then they'd understand how the other one 
    felt. Perhaps the insecurity would lessen. It's 
    about trying to bring people together even more. 
    You always understand something better once 
    you've experienced it. 

<p>KZ: What were some of
the fundamental differences between men and 
    women that you were thinking about when you 
    wrote that song? 

<p>KB: Well, I think the basic 
    physical differences is an obvious one. When 
    you're in love with someone, plus the actual act of 
    making love, not knowing what it's like to the other 
    person, I think there are then very subtle 
    differences, which is where the complications 
    come in, really. I think it's the same if it's men and 
    men or women and women. When you're in love 
    with someone, you become a bit more sensitized 
    That can cause problems. People say things, and 
    they don't really mean to hurt, but it does hurt 
    because of the way you're sensitized to the 
    situation. That's happening all the time. 
    Relationships, even when it's not some sort of 
    great passionate love, are something that affect 
    people in every way. It's such an important part of 
    our lives.
    
    

<p>KZ: All through your music, I see a strongsense of family. Did you come from a musical 
    background? 

<p>KB: Yes, they are musical. Music 
    was a very early influence for me. 

<p>KZ: I see acouple of other Bush's lurking in the music. 
    Are Paddy and John your brothers? 

<p>KB: Yes. 


    




    

<p>KZ: What kind of little sister were you?
    

<p>KB: I think I was quite a nice little sister
    really!
    

<p>KZ: On the song, &quot;Hounds of Love,&quot; is
    there imagery of women being hunted
    down?
    

<p>KB: Oh. no. It wasn't meant to be anything
    so one-sided at all. It's very much the idea
    of hounds of love so terrifying that you
    actually don't want to be caught by love.
    The hounds are coming to rip you to pieces
    and you're scared, so you run. You have to
    get away from them.
    

<p>KZ: What are the voices at the
    beginning-
    

<p>KB: Of the track? Can you not hear what
    he's saying?
    

<p>KZ: Something about being chased. It
    sounds like something lifted from an old
    movie.
    

<p>KB: It's not actually lifted from a movie, but
    we re-did it. He's saying, &quot;It's in the trees.&quot;
    

<p>KZ: It I got more into your music after the
    third LP, Never For Ever, was that 
    because
    it was a turning point?
    

<p>KB: Yes, it was very much so for me.
    Definitely. That was the first album where I
    had sufficient control in the studio.
    

<p>KZ: Was it hard gaining that control? Did
    you have to convince a lot of people?
    

<p>KB: I think there's a certain amount of that
    in any job, really. You have to prove what
    you can do, what you're worth. I think it was
    really waiting for the moment and being
    brave enough to feel that it was right to
    become more involved with the production.
    That's really what started to happen. I
    started producing with the engineer. It
    seemed to work very well, which was a
    great relief.
    

<p>KZ: Your earlier records, especially The
    Kick Inside and Lionheart, seemed 
    vocally
    oriented. Now the instrumentation plays
    just as important a part, if not more.
    
    
    

<p>KB: (Pause) Sharing of vocals and music, I 
    think they work so well together. If you can 
    get a nice balance, it's very effective, 
    particularly an an album, where you're 
    sustaining the listener's interest with a 
    certain amount of variety. Each time I make 
    an album, I figure I'm getting a little closer. 
    It's a continual process for me, trying to 
    make one better than the last one. 

<p>KZ: As 
    a songwriter, do you wrestle with 
    your songs', Is it a struggle? 

<p>KB: 
    They're terrible! They pin me against the 

    





    wall, they throw me around the room. 

<p>KZ: 
    Tell me about your working so 
    closely with the Fairlight Computer 
    Music Instrument. All the sounds 
    you're able to reproduce are 
    impressive.
    
    
    

<p>KB: It's a very important part of my music, 
    that coming along. I first met it on the third 
    album (Never For Ever). The minute I saw 
    what it could do, I really thought I needed 
    one badly. It was just so right for everything 
    I wanted to do and try. I've always found 
    synthesizers very difficult to get on with 
    The whole thing (with the Fairlight) is that 
    you can put any sound into it and it 
    becomes under your control. When you're 
    trying to create something
    
    
    
    that has atmosphere and mood, there really 
    isn't anything that could be better. What's 
    nice for the new album is that I managed to 
    actually buy one for the last album (The 
    Dreaming), but when I was writing for the 
    new album, I had the Fairlight to initially write 
    songs with. Up until then, I had it only to use 
    on overdubs. So it's had a very different 
    effect on the flavor of the songs. 

<p>KZ: So it 
    was, in effect, a partner in your writing 
    process. 

<p>KB: Well, the piano, I could never 
    really forsake that, because that's always 
    been my partner. It's just that the Fairlight is 
    a very interesting option to use. I think I'll 
    always like some songs with the piano. It's 
    just interesting, the places the Fairlight will 
    take you to that piano perhaps won't, 
    because it doesn't conjure up the same 
    ideas and sounds. 

<p>KZ: It was just, after 
    listening to records day in, day out, I 
    was especially impressed with how 
    organic and natural your music 
    sounds, considering the technology. 
    

<p>KB: Oh ... how nice! 

<p>KZ: You now have a 
    studio in your home. Will that slow you 
    down at all? Will it be five years until 
    the next album? 

<p>KB: I don't think so. 
    Ultimately, it does the opposite. It helps the 
    creative processes when you get 
    interesting ideas. What's so good is that I 
    have the facilities to come in whenever I 
    have ideas and time and actually put down a 
    track from the word go in the master studio. 
    What was really frustrating on The 
    Dreaming was that we did a lot of demos 
    that had a very good mood about them. And 
    then we'd try to
    
    re-create them from scratch in the master 
    studio. It was very difficult. Here the demos 
    are the masters. Everything is born with the 
    first things being put right onto tape. I think 
    that's good and it helps in getting something 
    interesting in the end. 

<p>KZ: Couldn't your 
    studio turn you into somewhat of a 
    recluse? 

<p>KB: That depends if you lose 
    sight of what you're doing. If you lose sight 
    of what you're doing, you should stop 
    anyway. If you feel everything you're doing 
    is for the better, then every moment is 
    worthwhile. 

<p>KZ: Have you become 
    somewhat of an engineer? 

<p>KB: No, but I 
    work with great engineers. They're so 
    important to me. You need good people 
    around you to feedback off of. You're in a 
    very isolated situation. You're locked in with 
    two other people, twelve hours a day. 
    You've got to have a good chemistry when 
    you're working or else it could be 
    unbearable 

<p>KZ: All through your 
    albums, the bass work has always 
    been extraordinary. You've worked 
    with people like (ECM's) Eberhard 
    Weber, Danny Thompson, and a player 
    named Del Palmer. Aside from 
    wanting a good base to your music, is 
    there a special role that instrument 
    plays? 

<p>KB: Yes. I think it's a terribly 
    important part of a track and if it's not a 
    bass guitar, you have to think carefully 
    about what it is that's going to cover that 
    register in the song. I mean, that's what it's 
    doing, really, it's holding the whole track 
    down. If you've got something that's 
    very carefully thought out and is 
    melodic, I think you have quite an 
    enchanting combination. I think one always 
    
   





    notices if the bass isn't very good. A lot of time 
    it's not necessarily such a dominant instrument. 
    It's almost something you feel. I also feel in some 
    tracks, it can also be a solo instrument. 

<p>KZ: Onthe last two albums you've used a dijeridu, the 
    Australian aboriginal instrument. 

<p>KB: I 
    think the sound of it is fascinating and wonderful 
    to work with. It's a drone that you can move 
    around on top of the music. It's very moody, 
    strange, earthy. 

<p>KZ: What about the tribal feelyour music, the huge drum sounds? 

<p>KB: I've 
    always found the drum kit a very difficult thing to 
    work with. It can take a lot of thought to try to get 
    the drums to sound interesting and right. They're a 
    totally dominating part of the track. They really do 
    have a very big influence on the feel of it. It's got 
    to be right and set the right mood from the word 
    go. They're normally the first thing you put on the 
    track. I like the idea of things sounding big and 
    grand, especially if the subject matter is in 
    keeping. It's all down to every little thing to help 
    create the picture. 

<p>KZ: When did you first meetDavid Gilmour? 

<p>KB: That was fate. I've been 
    incredibly lucky. I was very young and my 
    brother had a friend, who had a friend, (laughs) 
    who knew Dave. Dave, at the time, was scouting 
    talent that he could be involved with, or back in 
    some way. I was one of the projects that he was 
    considering. When he came down and heard 
    some tracks, he felt there was something there, 
    so he put up the money for me to be able to go 
    into the studio and have some tracks produced 
    and played for some record companies. The 
    demos I had, most people's imaginations didn't 
    stretch that far. Without him, it would have taken 
    me such a long time. He really did help me so 
    much. Through those recordings, I got my 
    contract. 

<p>KZ: Were you a Pink Floyd fan? 

<p>KB:I wasn't at the time. I was very young and had 
    heard of them, but hadn't really heard their music. 
    Meeting Dave made me curious about them and 
    since then, I have become a big fan. 

<p>KZ: He'sperceived differently in this country, almost as 
    a guitar hero, but he's quite interested in 
    experimental music. 

<p>KB: He's fantastic. I will 
    always be indebted to him. He helped me so much 
    by what he did. He's a very kind man. 

<p>KZ: Whatdid you think of Pat Benatar's version of 
    &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;? 

<p>KB: I thought it was 
    really nice! 

<p>KZ: Why are you reluctant to playlive? 

<p>KB: I'm not reluctant to play live at all. The 
    problem is actually getting the time. I did one tour 
    and it took us six months to prepare and was 
    totally exhausting. Ever since, I really haven't had 
    the time or the opportunity. I needed two albums 
    worth of material to do another show so that it 
    would be all fresh stuff. Since, it hasn't really felt 
    like the right time. I have to take all my things one 
    at a time. It becomes involved. It's not right to put 
    things out unless you have the right amount of care to 

    





    put  into them.
    
    

<p>KZ: So looking back at the last three    albums, do they fit together enough for you
    to want to go out and perform them live?
    

<p>KB: Yes. I think it could be very interesting.
    

<p>KZ: Up until now, America has been a    tough nut for you to crack. What do you
    think?
    

<p>KB: I think it's a matter of when it's right.
    When, it's meant to, it will happen. What
    does it is the music. The music has the
    energy, people back it up and people like
    it. The record company promotes it so
    people know it's out there, then, I think,
    that's what creates an energy. If people
    didn't like it, I could do an awful lot and it
    wouldn't do anything.
    

<p>KZ: Have you visited any parts of    America?
    

<p>KB: I did a long time ago. I did a TV show in
    New York (Saturday Night Live) and that
    was fun. I've only been to New York and Los
    Angeles.
    

<p>KZ: You worked briefly with Peter Gabriel    on his third LP. Are there any similarities
    between how he works and how you
    work?
    

<p>KB: I think there are some similarities. We
    both take quite a bit of time. I think he has
    been an influence in that anything you like
    becomes an influence. If you like it, you
    would like to exude something similar. I
    think he's a really nice person, as well. He's
    trying to do something different.
    

<p>KZ: What part of Elton John's career    influenced you?
    

<p>KB: I was very young and so into his music.
    He was the only person I knew of that wrote
    songs and played piano and sang. I was
    about 14 or 15.
    

<p>KZ: I think my favorite song by you is &quot;Pull
    Out The Pin,&quot; featuring David Gilmour
    singing. Tell me about that specific song?
    

<p>KB: There was a documentary on TV a
    long while back that was a very strong
    inspirational force. It was about the religious
    irony of the Vietnamese who would pop the
    silver Buddah in his mouth, you see, they
    wore them around their necks. Whenever
    they went into battle, they would put the
    Buddah into their mouths so that when they
    died, Buddah was on their lips. The irony of
    it was extraordinary. The song was written
    from the Vietnamese point of view. It's about
    how the Vietnamese tracks this American
    Gl down for a couple of days, something
    they would normally do, stay with someone
    two or three days until they'd find a moment,
    then they'd throw a grenade. The idea is
    that just as he's about to pop a grenade, he
    looks into the American's eyes and sees his
    face for the first time. Until then, he's been
    an object. When he looks into his eyes, he
    sees himself in a way, in that it's a human

    





    being who is lonely and sad, probably has
    kids, a home. At that point of decision, what
    does he do? Does he pull out the pin?
    Chances are, they'll both be killed. What is
    the decision? It's that moment comprised of
    your own survival and compassion for
    another human.
    

<p>KZ: Will I ever see you play that song live?    

<p>KB: I'd like to think so.
    

<p>KZ: What other kinds of music do you    listen to?
    

<p>KB: I don't listen to very much music, other
    than what I work on. When I do, I tend to
    listen to things like Eberhard Weber and
    classical music. There are some really nice
    things coming out of a label called
    Windham Hill. I like instrumental music. I
    tend to unwind by watching films on video
    rather than listening to music because I
    spend so much of my time listening to my
    own music, working on my own ideas for
    this and that. So it's quite rare for me to
    listen to other people in a big way.
    

<p>KZ: I've heard you're afraid to fly.    

<p>KB: I don't like flying. It's very difficult for
    me. I travel by train and boat and that hasn't
    stopped me from going anywhere yet.
    

<p>KZ: So you're pretty much an earthly    creature.
    

<p>KB: (Laughs) Yes, it would seem so at the
    moment.
