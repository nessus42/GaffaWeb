<p>  What Does Kate do next? 
</p>


<p>by Paul Donovan 
</p>


<p>Daily Mail - April 18, 1979 
</p>




<p> Movie men want to make a bat woman of Miss Bush 
</p>




<p>The wailing voice and haunting looks of Kate Bush have already sold a million 
records 
</p>


<p>So what's the next step of the 20-year-old doctor's daughter who this week is 
playing to sell-out audiences at the London Palladium? 
</p>


<p>If the movie makers get their way, they'll turn her into a sexy vampire and bring 
shuttering frights from the girl who rose to fame with her number one smash hit 
Wuthering Heights. 
</p>


<p>Elfin-faced Kate revealed yesterday: &quot;I've had two script offered to me recently. 
Both were horror films. 
</p>




<p>POWERFUL 
</p>


<p>&quot;But I wouldn't have though I was a vampire. And I don't consider myself an 
actress, anyway.&quot; 
</p>


<p>Kate, who dances sinuously on stage to a background of conjurer, smoke, and 
back-projected films, was asked about the other role in which she has been cast... a 
vamp. 
</p>


<p>&quot;I was very rebellious when the Press first gave me the label of a sex symbol,&quot; 
she said. &quot;I thought people would react to me as body and face rather than my 
music. 
</p>


<p>&quot;But it's an incredible compliment for a female to get, so long as it doesn't stand 
in the way of the music. I'm not sure why people like me or why they want to see 
me on stage but it does inspire me that they do. 
</p>


<p>Kate has no steady boyfriend and will marry only when she wants to start a 
family. 
</p>


<p>It she hadn't been a singer, she would have like have been a psychiatrist. Now 
there must be a script there, somewhere. 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush at The London Palladium 
</p>


<p>by Thomson Prentice 
</p>


<p>Daily Mail - April 18, 1979 
</p>




<p> That conventional image of a girl pop star who recites her hits between 
breathless &quot;thank yous' was hurled into deserved obsolescence in this unlikely 
setting. 
</p>


<p>Kate Bush lines up all the old stereotypes, mows them down and hammers them 
into their coffins with a show that is - quite literally - stunning. 
</p>


<p>This quaint, cute suburban redhead turns pop upside-down by not merely singing 
but performing songs with explosive originality. 
</p>


<p>Each number becomes a miniature play involving burlesque, ballet, and mime. 
The cast is a troupe of dancers, musicians, and magicians who paint a whole 
kaleidoscope of images. 
</p>


<p>Personally, I don't much for her records, her voice dominated with often obtuse 
lyrics is not a fulfilling enough mixture in itself. 
</p>


<p>But add an endless repertoire of special effects, props, back-screen projections 
and sound effects and the voice becomes part of an entrancing whole. 
</p>


<p>The relentless imagery, however, sometimes engulfs the intention of the 
performance. 
</p>


<p>But what an ambitious adventure it is for a singer on her first concert tour - and 
how mediocre does she make most of her pop contemporaries seem.
