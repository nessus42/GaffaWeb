<P>Date: Fri, 8 Dec 89 12:55:04 EST <BR> From: &quot;Martin R. Lamb&quot; &lt;martinn@csri.toronto.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: YTV Dec. 1989 (short) 
</P>
<P>Canadian Youth TV channel. &quot;YTV Rocks&quot;: 
</P>
<P>Close to the end of the program, my friend was talking to me when I suddenly
 heard &quot;blah blah Kate Bush interview&quot;. Not being sure when it is
going to be shown,  I set my VCR on Monday just in case, and when I got home, lo
and behold there is  the Goddess speaking, albeit for all of 5 minutes. It's
disappointingly short, but at  least it's SOMETHING! 
</P>
<P>I have transcribed the &quot;interview&quot; below. The interviewer is
neither seen nor  heard - only Kate's responses are shown. In between the
responses, snippets from  videos as well as comments from the host in the studio
are heard. I have not  included the trite comments, which are along the lines of
&quot;she's working with a  Bulgarian vocal choir&quot; [!] and &quot;her dance
videos are unlike those of Janet Jackson or  Paula Abdul.&quot; [All together
now, ROLL YOUR EYES.] 
</P>
<P>Kate is seen sitting in front of the control panel of a recording studio.
She is  wearing a black jacket, and she looks to her right when talking,
presumably where  the interviewer is. 
</P>
<P>[Rocket's Tail is played against images of fireworks] 
</P>
<P>I first heard the Trio Bulgarka when I'd finished the last album, and I was 
devastated. I think everyone that hears it for the first time is; it's
*INCREDIBLY*  powerful music. I listened to it for a long time, and started
thinking how nice it'd be  if I could somehow work with them. 
</P>
<P>I worked with Irish musicians before, and Irish music I think is in my
blood. My  mother's Irish and my brother was always playing it when I was a kid.
I feel a real  affinity for Irish music, and really knew nothing about Bulgarian
music until a few  years ago. But when you hear it, and you relate it to
something like Irish music,  there are a lot of similarities. 
</P>
<P>[clips from TSW and RutH are played ] 
</P>
<P>I've never thought of myself as a dancer, and I suppose I've never really
thought  of myself as a singer either; it's just things that come together with
writing songs. I  got an incredible amount out of it, but I would never think of
myself as a dancer,  because I always have to stop; I just can't ever hold it
together. I suppose I'm too  obsessive about making albums. I could hold it
together once I'm out of the studio. I  just don't have the discipline I guess.
[ shrugs and smiles ] 
</P>
<P>[ a scene from Cloudbusting ] 
</P>
<P>My favorite videos are when the song has a story; when it is actually like a
story  that you could then turn into a little piece of film. Say, like
Cloudbusting, that's a lot  of fun to make. It was a story and it's a matter of
telling the story visually. 
</P>
<P>I'd *LOVE* to make a film, even if it's just a short film. It's like going
back to  that story-telling process again, where I'd be able to deal [?] with
pictures as well as  sound. Putting the two together is such a powerful thing. 
</P>
<P>END OF INTERVIEW 
</P>
<P>I have thanked them for doing this by mail, but I doubt if any more of the 
interview will be shown. They seem to like KT but judging from the comments they
 make they aren't too well versed in matters Bushological.
