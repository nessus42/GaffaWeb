Subject: Los Angeles Times, by Terry Atkinson January 28, 1990 
</P>
<P>A new full-length article/interview about/with Kate Bush appeared in this 
Sunday's edition of the Los Angeles Times. It was written by Terry Atkinson, a 
longtime staff music critic. 
</P>
<P>All Love-Hounds will want to read at least the first three paragraphs of the
 article-- believe IED about this one, folks! &lt;Note: all remarks enclosed in
brackets &lt;&gt;  are IED's, not part of the original text.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&lt; Los Angeles Times, Sunday, January 28, 1990&gt; 
</P>
<P>  The Baffling, Alluring World of Kate Bush 
</P>
<P> by Terry Atkinson 
</P>
<P> Do you celebrate Katemas? Not Christmas. Katemas. 
</P>
<P>If you do, then you're undoubtedly a Love-Hound. A Love-Hound is what some 
Kate Bush fans call themselves--the ones so devoted that they attend Katemas 
parties every July 30 in Boston, Santa Cruz, Bellingham, Wash., London and other
 locales to celebrate the English pop singer's birthday. 
</P>
<P>Love-Hounds subscribe to Kate Bush fanzines like Homeground, which just 
published its 36th issue in conjunction with the October release of Bush's The 
Sensual World, her first album of new material since 1985's The Hounds of Love 
&lt;sic&gt;. Published in Bush's home ground of Kent, England, the fanzine
contains 32  pages of breathless updates, worshipful reviews, Katemas reports,
short stories  inspired by Katesongs, letters and personal messages. 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are plenty of Katehaters--among them many American 
rock critcs. Dave Marsh once described Bush's voice as sounding &quot;like the 
consequences of mating Patti Smith with a Hoover vacuum cleaner.&quot; Another
writer  called her &quot;just a curiosity... with no pop hooks.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Even those critics who've found kind things to say about Bush are often
baffled  and annoyed at much of her work. While her style is frequently &quot;enchanting&quot;,
Ira  Robbins writes in The New Trouser Press Record Guide, &quot;she can be
overbearingly  coy and preciously self-indulgent.&quot; Another writer perhaps
summed her up best:  &quot;Not for everyone.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The object of all this affection and abuse is the 31-year-old (last Katemas)
 daughter of a British physician. Her English-Irish family was a musical one,
and  Bush began playing piano at age 11 and writing songs soon after, including
her early  masterpieces Wuthering Heights (based on the Emily Bronte novel) and
The Man  With the Child in His Eyes. She was discovered and aided at the age of
16 by Pink  Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. &lt;Incorrect: she was no older than
15, and probably  only 14.&gt; Her first album, The Kick Inside, released in
1978, was an immediate  sensation in England, Europe, Australia and parts of
Asia, and gave her the creative  freedom to indulge in her often mystical and
theatrical album projects. But she  would never go beyond cult status in America
until Hounds, her first gold record  here--spurred by her first U.S. hit,
Running Up That Hill, and frequent showings of  her own unique videos on MTV. 
</P>
<P>To help Sensual World follow up on that success, Bush went to extraordinary 
lengths (for her) of traveling to New York recently and doing interviews. 
</P>
<P>More disconcerting for longtime fans than her delayed American success is 
Bush's continuing and puzzling dislike for concertizing. It's puzzling because
her  hourlong Live at Hammersmith video shows the lithe, attractive Bush having
a  ball--changing costumes, playing various personas, concocting outragious
production  numbers and indulging in her love for mime and dance. 
</P>
<P>Of the last time she performed her material on stage, Bush says, &quot;I
suppose just  after the tour I was at a point when I felt so exposed and so
vulnerable I needed to  retreat and just make albums--be a songwriter again.
That's how I started. I lost a  lot of confidence as a performer during the
tour--I get very nervous about the idea  of performing live.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Very nervous. That last tour took place in 1979, when the Hammersmith show 
was taped. 
</P>
<P>And there doesn't seem much chance Bush will take The Sensual World to the 
stage. &quot;I have no plans as yet,&quot; she said during a phone interview
during her New  York trip. &quot;Because, really, I'm just too caught up with
making albums, making  videos. Live performance just kind of got left behind
with me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It would seem that Bush would keep up the concerts at least occasionally, if
only  to give her well-known love of dancing an outlet. But, she says now, &quot;that's
kind of  been left behind&quot; too. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was such a very important part of my life. When I started music I
think it was  responsible for keeping me sane, because training as a dancer
really kept me in  good spirits amid all the crazy stuff that happened when I
first became popular. But  I guess I've gotten more and more into filmic
imagery, and I don't really keep fit  like I used to.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Film seems to be where Bush is headed next. &quot;I have this desire in the
back of  my mind now of making music and film at the same time--putting the two 
together.&quot; It would seem a natural, considering that she has conceived and
directed  most of her own promotional videos. 
</P>
<P>Bush--who also produces her albums and plays piano and synthesizer--came 
close to going beyond four-minute videos when she flirted with the idea of
making a  film based on The Ninth Wave, the intriguing conceptual second side of
The Hounds  of Love. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What I wanted to do was turn that into a half-hour film integrating
music with  visuals. When I was writing it, I was really thinking visually. It
was just unfortunate  that by the time I had the opportunity to make the film I
was just too tired. I did not  have the energy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush's lyrics are seldom easy to fathom on first listening, something she 
acknowledges. &quot;My music can be a little obscure,&quot; she admits. &quot;It
does worry me that  the music might be too complicated for people to take
in--that they have to work too  hard at it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Ninth Wave is as good an example as any of how challenging her themes
can  be. The related string of songs concerns a woman who is dreaming (perhaps)
of  floating on water and being lulled into sleep (and perhaps death). She finds
herself  drowning under ice. Then several friendly voices pull her up from this
state of mind,  but a Mediaeval witch-hunter thrusts her back under water to
prove she's a witch.  Images of loved ones, salvation, morning and a lust for
life end the cycle. 
</P>
<P>Though not quite so complex, Bush's individual songs usually tend to be
similarly  drawn from the unconscious realms, especially since her great 1982
album, The  Dreaming. Madonna she's not. No wonder it took her so long to sell
records in  America. 
</P>
<P>However, not all of Bush's songs are difficult to enter. An excellent place
to start  for a beginner is one of the songs on the new LP, Deeper
Understanding, which  deals with how people often cut themselves off from others
and opt for technological  &quot;friends&quot;. Sample lyric: 
</P>
<P> As the people here grow colder 
</P>
<P> I turn to my computer 
</P>
<P> And spend my evenings with it 
</P>
<P> Like a friend... 
</P>
<P> I need deeper understanding 
</P>
<P> Give me deeper understanding 
</P>
<P>&quot;That seems to be something we're encouraged to do,&quot; Bush said, &quot;in
that, more  and more, it's almost easier for us to stay in our rooms, watch the
television, shop  from our computers. To become such isolated beings.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But hasn't she been accused of being too isolated herself since moving to
the  English countryside, and spending literally years working on each album
with  bassist/engineer/boyfriend Del Palmer? 
</P>
<P>Bush doesn't see it that way. True, though, she did want to get out of the
city. &quot;I  find it fascinating how I've heard people say that they get a
tremendous amount of  inspiration from the cities and from this kind of
unnatural situation. &lt;Oddly enough,  Kate once said as much herself, but she
seems to have forgotten that these days...&gt; I  get much more inspiration from
being outside in nature.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush admits she does spend a lot of time in her own home studio--and when
she  isn't there she's most likely to be found &quot;in the garden--if it's
summer--or  watching television, watching a film, trying to catch up on sleep.&quot;

</P>
<P>But, while no party animal (again, Madonna she's not), the singer also
enjoys  &quot;asking friends around to dinner, or maybe going to the theater
with them. I love  being with my friends, relaxing and talking.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In fact, Bush says, there's nothing more important to her--in her life and
in her  work--than relationships. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that's really my big fascination--relationships. I suppose in
some ways  you can look at everything in terms of relationships. &lt;This seems
to be one of Kate's  current theses, though in fact there are a good number of
songs of hers which can  be described as &quot;relationship songs&quot; only in
the loosest possible sense.&gt; It's so crazy!  I think I could spend the rest
of my life just working with relationships.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World, like her previous albums, explores this fascination. The
LP's  songs include Love and Anger, Reaching Out, Between a Man and a Woman, 
and--on the cassette and CD-- Walk Straight Down the Middle, an optimistic 
consideration of male/female symbiosis comparable to her moving 1987 duet with 
Peter Gabriel, Don't Give Up. 
</P>
<P>One thing that sets The Sensual World apart from the previous albums, in
Bush's  mind, is an increased sense of &quot;positive female energy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;All my music has been influenced mainly by male music,&quot; said
Bush, who has  specifically cited Gabriel, Elton John and The Beatles, &quot;and
by the people I work  with, which have almost always been men. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I love working with men, but with the new album I began to explore my
own  ways of expressing music even more, to look for female energies. Working
with the  Trio Bulgarka provided that for me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Trio Bulgarka is made up of three singers from the Bulgarian folk-music 
world, which has recently intrigued English and American musicians and audiences
 because of its unusual modalities and powerful female vocals. 
</P>
<P>As reserved during an interview as she is unreserved on record and video,
Kate  Bush came closest to real enthusiasm when speaking of the three songs on
the new  album where she is backed by the Trio. She has always integrated ethnic
music in  her work, but this was something special for her. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Suddenly, there I was working with these three ladies from a
completely  different culture. I've never worked with women on such an intense
creative level,  and it was something strange to feel this very strong female
energy in the studio. It  was interesting to see the way the men in the studio
reacted to this. Instead of just  one female, there was a very strong female
presence. &lt;Typical of Kate, she describes  the men's reaction as &quot;interesting&quot;,
but doesn't say what their reaction was !&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It made me think of the words to The Sensual World ,&quot; she said of
the album's  title song, which is drawn from the Molly Bloom soliloquy that ends
James Joyce's  Ulysses. The song is a torrent of sexual memory and lusty
acceptance of life's  sensations, set to soft, exotic, Celtic-tinged music. The
last word in the book and the  song is yes. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's quite a female expression for me, really,&quot; said Bush. &quot;A
more...open  female expression. I'm not a feminist...but I think I'm finally
coming to terms with  being a woman in this business.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush has not yet &quot;even begun to think about the next album.&quot; As
usual, she likes  to take her time. Whether her American audience grows or wanes
is something she  cares about, but it is not the most important thing on her
mind. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I make music because I love making it,&quot; she said. &quot;I do it
for the sheer delight of  watching it come together. I'm in love with the whole
process. It's important to me  to keep that kind of priority. If people want to
hear it, that's a wonderful extra. But  it's not something you should expect.
You really have to do things for the love of  doing them--and not for the reward
afterwards.&quot; 
</P>
<P> There is one photograph, a publicity studio shot by John Carder Bush
showing  Kate, hair elaborately teased, sitting on the floor crosslegged,
wearing a dark blouse  with a bright embroidered flower design.
