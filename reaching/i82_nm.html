Subject: Canada TV Aug. 3./4. 1985 about The Dreaming
</p>



<p>On Aug.3 &amp; 4, a TV show called &quot;The New Music&quot;, produced by CityTV here in 
Toronto (which also produces MuchMusic, the Canadian equilvalent of MTV), 
con-tained a 5 minute interview of Kate Bush. I'd like to share it here with the 
people in (at? on? of?) lovehounds. 
</p>



<p>NM: It has been three years since Kate Bush released her last album &quot;The 
Dreaming&quot;.Now at last comes a new single and video called &quot;Running Up that 
Hill&quot;. It's taken from the new album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; which is due out in 
September. 
</p>

</p>

<p>	The &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; record represents a return to the gentler tones for which 
Kate Bush is most admired. To many people &quot;The Dreaming&quot;has been 
inaccessible, her singing abbrasive. When I met Kate on a trip to England last 
March, we talked about &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. 
</p>

one wall and a grand piano at the back]
</p>



<p>KB: I think the last album is very dark and about pain and negativity, and the way 
that people treat each other badly. It was a sort of cry really and I think that 
perhaps the biggest influence on the last album was the fact that I was producing 
it so I could actually do what Iwanted for the first time. And then there are a lot 
of things we wanted to experiment with and I particulary wanted to play around 
with my voices, because there are a lot of different backing vocals and things like 
that. The different textures were important to me. I wanted to try and create 
pictures with the sounds by using effects. 
</p>

<p>NM: You have been, I think, popularly associted with a very, ah, sweet voice, and 
what you were doing some places on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was making very glutteral 
sounds, hoarse and raw, deliberately making your voice crack. 
</p>

<p>KB: Yes, I find it much more interesting. The first two albums my voice really 
wasn't capable of doing that. I think my writing and my voice have continually 
tried to get better, to be able to do something I actually like. And it's very 
frustrating when you are writing songs and singing them, and you're not enjoying 
what's coming back. So hopefully, y'know, it will be become more pleasurable 
for me, the actual process, because it is painful to listen to things that sound 
awful, when you really wanted them to sound good. 
</p>

<p>NM: Those earlier songs &quot;Breathing&quot; and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, have what you might 
call a political conscience. Now that so many groups are doing political music, like 
the Ethiopia Famine Relief Fund music that sort of thing, is your new album 
going to contain something similar?
</p>

<p> KB: No, I don't think..., actually there aren't any tracks that are political as such. I 
never felt that I've written from a political point of view. It's always been an 
emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation. I 
mean war is an extremly emotional situation, especially if you're going to be 
blown up! I think with the whole thing of nuclear war, people are really terrified 
and increasingly so the more that we hear on the media all the time about it. I 
think writers always do have a conscience about the things that scare them, they 
wanted to write about them, to relieve themselves. 
</p>

<p>NM: I'm reminded by a painting in the corner here, which is a sort of satire of a 
Pre-Raphaelite painting, that I always have thought that those Victorian painters, 
the Pre-Raphaelites, were an influenece to the texture of your song writing.
</p>

<p>KB: Yes, yes. I think that was particularly in my very early teens I was very 
enchanted by the whole romance of it, yes. They find their way into songs, the 
imagery. I think that's what happens: something attracts you because of its 
imagery and you digest it and it comes up in a song. I think that's how artists 
work; they are like magpies, picking up little bits of gold and storing them away.
