<P><STRONG>&quot;Things Your Mother Never Told You&quot;</STRONG>     
</P>
<P>NOW HOW can I put this without being rude? When I  first heard &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; Kate Bush's  voice reminded me of, well...come on, out with it
man!...  a female turkey having its neck wrung Sorry!</P>
<P>I have to admit &quot;The Man With The Child In His  Eyes&quot; was a much
easier pill to swallow, quite sweet  in fact, but really I'd given Kate Bush no
chance at all to  reach me until this interview came up.</P>
<P>And now I love her. No, not just because of the way  she lit up an EMI
office with those eyes or because of her  obvious physical attractions to a
male.</P>
<P>What I've realised is that she's an artist, a truly original  writer and
performer. All the articles I'd read where she  said nothing but &quot;wow,
incredible&quot; and  &quot;amazing&quot; and  &quot;situation&quot; were  just
skating on the surface of one of the most adventurous  talents around.</P>
<P>A LITTLE background? After totting up 10 'O'-levels she  left school at 16
when EMI Records offered to sponsor her  for a couple of years' writing before
launching her into the  record market. She lives in Lewisham with her boyfriend 
(and bassist) Del Palmer. She's had two gold albums and  four hit singles.</P>
<P>While the image-makers have been pushing the myth  of the innocent from the
convent school, Kate Bush has  been flouting every convention she's been faced
wlth.</P>
<P>Her current hit from the &quot;On Stage&quot; EP,  &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;,
is a nice pop song all  right but it's  also an expression of her attitude to
her work.  Ms Bush is a keen learner in every area of her life and  &quot;Them
Heavy People&quot; are her &quot;wonderful  teachers&quot; -- such as mime
artiste Lindsay Kemp who  gave her tuition <EM>and</EM> other less formal
educators  who treated her badly and inspired her to stand up for herself.</P>
<P>She sings &quot;<EM>They build up my body/ Break me  emotionally/ it's
nearly killing me/ But what a lovely  feeling!</EM>&quot; That's the pleasure
expressed by  a girl who rehearsed 14 hours a day for months, put up  all the
money she had for the extraordinary live show  and turned it into a sell-out
success.</P>
<P>But the key line is &quot;I must work on my mind&quot;.  Kate Bush hates the
thought of meandaring along, letting  life happen to you.</P>
<P>&quot;There's so much put in our minds from the day dot,  the day we come
out of that little womb. People telling you  (<EM>mummy to baby silly voice</EM>)
'That's wrong!' or  'there's a good girl!' When you get a bit older you realise
a  lot of them didn't know what they were talking about but  you'd accepted it.</P>
<P>&quot;Then you have to <EM>relearn</EM> and that's  the hardest thing to do
&quot;</P>
<P>SHE FEELS  this way despite having grown up very happily in  Welling, Kent,
feeling close to her parents and brothers. At the  time there never seemed to be
any girls around to play with  and so she ganged up with her brothers. (John and
Paddy  are still with her as accountant and guitarist respectively.)  Her
independence showed through as soon as she took to  music. She detested the
old-fashioned lessons she had been  given on the violin and loved the piano
because she sussed  out herself after her doctor dad had showed her where she'd 
find C.</P>
<P>Later when she studied singing, dancing and mime she was  determined never
to copy the classical style. Instead she wanted to use those skills to express
her own character.</P>
<P>For instance that voice would hardly go down a storm at the  Opera House but
her teacher gave her the ability to make it  last. As she said with some
satisfaction, &quot;A lot of singers who are around now will have torn their
throats to bits in five years. They'll hardly be able to make a sound.&quot;</P>
<P>Mind you, many a set of vocal chords exercised by nothing but booze and fags
has still been roaring like a foghorn ten years later!</P>
<P>In the main though, Kate's theories work in practice because she carries
them through so thoroughly.</P>
<P>&quot;I saw our show as not just people on stage playing the  music, but as
a complete experience,&quot; she said. &quot;A  lot of people would say 'Pooah!'
but for me that's what it was. Like a play.</P>
<P>&quot;That's why I didn't speak. 'For our next song...' and all that. I mean
a Shakespeare actor doesn't turn to the audience at the  end of the act and say
'In the interval there will be orange juice  and popcorn on sale in the foyer.'</P>
<P>&quot;You are a performer, you are projecting and exaggerating  things and
if you break the illusion you break the whole of the  concept. If you fall over
you've got to make it look like it was 
<EM>meant</EM> to happen.&quot;</P>
<P>Some rock bands might scorn that idea as dishonest, saying that  you should
own up and laugh it off. Kate Bush isn't deceiving  anyone though, she's playing
a different game in which the old  rules don't apply .</P>
<P>FOR ALL the creative energy that went into making her show so  different
from anything else on the concert circuit, Kate will admit  that in one sense it
was a bit of a defence. She does feel that in the ordinary group set or playing
solo with her piano she could be boring.</P>
<P>&quot;I can hide behind a role on stage,&quot; she said. &quot;If I'm  in
costume and make-up I'm OK but I think to an extent I would  become lost without
them. Like now, in this interview, I have no  way of projecting an image to you.
I'm just being me, that's  what  people are expecting and that's cool, but when
you're on stage you  have to become bigger.&quot;</P>
<P>Well, having really listened to her music, it's difficult to imagine  Kate
Bush hiding.</P>
<P>The supposed pouting cutesy-pie turned out to be one of the  most touching
writers about sex and love I've encountered.  She's only 20 now. She writes
about what she knows -- her  own experiences and her own fantasies as she passed
through  adolescence to womanhood.</P>
<P>Result: girls must have a great fellow-feeling with her while  boys, who are
reckoned to be the majority of her fans, are  caught up in the sexy, sensual,
romantic way she tells what  it's like to be female -- and that doesn't stop
them fancying  her.</P>
<P>That's very important as most teenage sex education still  comes through
half-truths from embarrassed parents, cold  facts from biology teachers and
giggling sessions in some  hideaway with a dirty book. It's good to have Kate
Bush  around to give fuddy-duddy puritanism a kick inside.</P>
<P>PARDON ME if none of this is news to you but have you ever  really
considered what Kate Bush is singing about?</P>
<P>How about &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;? You don't think  that when she
sings, &quot;<EM>Every girl knows about the punctual  blues</EM>,&quot; it's
because she missed the bus that morning,  do you?</P>
<P>The next &quot;Kick Inside&quot; track, &quot;Kite&quot;, begins  &quot;<EM>Beelzebub
is aching in my belly-o/ My feet are heavy and  I'm rooted in my wellios</EM>&quot;
-- the same &quot;taboo&quot;  topic -- period pains.</P>
<P>Taboos? She makes of principle of breaking them. They offend her 
independent spirit. The song &quot;The Klck Inside&quot; is about a  girl in a
medieval village who's in love with her brother, pregnant by  him and commits
suicide to save her family from pubic scorn.</P>
<P>As usual Ms Bush has her own thoughts on the subject.</P>
<P>&quot;I can see it in a way because I love my brothers although  I've never
had any sexual attraction to them. But I can understand  if someone is so like
you -- reflection is what it's all about -- it could  be one of the most
beautiful relationships in the world.&quot;</P>
<P>Then there's &quot;Kashka From Baghdad&quot; which is a funny  celebration
of a happy homosexual affair, and so on. Unacknowledged,   Kate Bush is singing
to millions about matters most of us find it difficult   to talk about in our
family homes That's healthy.</P>
<P>I'm not suggesting you should get into Kate Bush as some kind of  hip sex
educationalist though. What's great about Kate is that she  puts across a
feeling of the joys of sex and loving people. Moon In  June isn't In it. Ms Bush
gives you the real thing.</P>
<P>FORTHRIGHT AS she Is, Ms Bush did say she was very glad that  national Press
journalists never bother to listen to her lyrics. She  has sickening visions of
what the seedier Sundays might make of  her.</P>
<P>&quot;It's better that it's kept for the people who really know  the songs.
When the sansationalisn starts they take it on  completeiy the wrong level. They
wouldn't see it as the  intimate expression and sharing with the listener of 
experiences we all know about &quot;</P>
<P>And this is the lady who has been put down as a manufactured  article, some
kind of animated gimmick. That's something she  resents.</P>
<P>&quot;It worries me that people may think I'm totally manipulated  by the
company, the dance teacher, the record producer. That I'm  not inteIllgent and I
don't think for myself. I consider myself very  strong. I do control a lot of
whet happens around me and I try to  control it all. </P>
<P>&quot;It's a shame people often seem to regard me as this rubber  doll. It
affects the way people treat you... but then it's a challenge  to overcome it!&quot;
