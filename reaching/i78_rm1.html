<H3>&quot;You Don't Have To Be Beautiful...&quot;</H3>
<P>...to get your face in Sounds, a top five single are usually enough.
Fortunately, Kate Bush has both, so you can't call us sexist.</P>
<P>    SOULFUL, SENSITIVE,      salubrious. So why all the fuss      about Kate
Bush's age? Is it the      fact that you don't usually get      such cohesive
intelligence from      19 year old females? Is it that      'child' prodigies
are out of our      mode? Or is it simply the fact      that the journalists are
getting      older? It wasn't that long ago      that the charts were brimmed   
  from 1 to 10 with teen-aged      stars. It may seem that only      yesterday
she was your average      unknown person, but in fact,      Kate has been
developing her      unique talents on rinky-dink      second hand pianos since
she      was the ripe old age of 14.      Recently she moved into a three     
storey flat in Lewisham, which is      owned by her general practioner     
daddy-o, and whose other two      storeys are occupied by her two      older
brothers.</P>
<P>    The story is not at all as overnight      as it seems to be, it was in
fact two      years ago that Pink Floyd's Dave      Gilmour bopped around to
Kates' flat      with a Revox -- goal in mind to get      some of Kates tunes
published. She      wasn't, at the time, considered a      singer but Gilmour,
who is genuinely      interested in giving undiscovered      talent a
shot-in-the-arm (with his      Unicorn organization) felt that the      bubbling
under songs should have the      opportunity to be heard. They      recorded
about 15 songs per tape,      and took them around to various      record
companies. The unanimous      opinion, then, was 'non-commerical',      and
after all . . . it's not creative unless      it sells, 'eh?</P>
<P>   How Kate and Gilmour hooked up is      rather a vague      'girlfriends'-
boyfriends'- girlfriends friend'     sort of rigamaroll, but the fact is that   
  he never did lose interest in her er . . .      talents, and decided that the
only way     to reach a record company's goldlined      pocket was to produce
finished      product. Which is exactly what they      did. Gilmour put up the
money, and      Kate went into Air studios complete      with a band, and laid
down the three      tracks she and Dave both felt were      best. This is the
tape which eventually      landed Kate her contract with EMI      Records.</P>
<P>    Despite the fact that she has been      already wrongly built (no pun   
  intended) in the media to be a mere      child, she is surprisingly aware of  
   what is going on around her, and is      accepting the entire shindig with a 
    pleased air of disbelief.</P>
<P>    &quot;They keep telling me the chart      numbers, and I just kind of
say 'Wow'      (she sweeps her arms) . . . it's     not really like it's
happening. I've always     been on the outside, watching albums I      like go
up the charts, and feeling      pleased that they are doing well, but      it's
hard to relate to the fact that it's now      happening to <EM>me</EM>...&quot;</P>
<P>    'WUTHERING Heights', Kate's     self-penned song, inspired by the book  
   of the same title, is literally catapaulting      up the UK charts, and looks
as though      it will be one of those classic      world-wide smasheroonies,
though it      has yet to be released in most other      countries. She recently
took her first      air-bourne flight to Germany for a      television
appearance, as the single,      apparently, has been chosen as      whatever the
German equivalent of      'pick-of-the-week' might be.</P>
<P>    &quot;It was mind blowing,&quot; she said      euphorically, in
reference to flying, &quot;I      really want to do more of that . . .&quot;    
 Wonder how she'll feel about in in two      years time.</P>
<P>    She writes songs about love,      people, relationships and life . . .  
   sincerely and emotionally, but      without prostituting her talents by     
whining about broken hearts.</P>
<P>    &quot;If you're writing a song, assuming      people are going to
listen, then you      have a responsibility to those people.      It's important
to give them a positive      message, something that can advise      or help is
far more effective than      having a wank and being self-pitiful.      That's
really negative. My friends and      brothers have been really helpful to me,   
  providing me with stimulating      conversation and ideas I can really     
sink my teeth into.&quot;</P>
<P>    For as long as she can remember      she has been toying around with the
     piano, much, I reckoned, to her      parent's chargrin. Can you imagine    
 living with a nine-year-old who      insisted on battering away on said     
instrument, wailing away at the top      of her lungs in accompaniment?</P>
<P>    &quot;Well, they weren't very      encouraging in the beginning, they   
  thought it was a lot of noise. When I      first started, my voice was
terrible, but      the voice is an instrument to a singer,      and the only way
to improve it is to      practice. I have had no formal vocal      training,
though there was a guy that I      used to see for half-an-hour once a     
week, and he would advise me on      things like breathing properly, which is   
  very important to voice control. He'd      say things like 'Does that hurt?
Well,      then sing more from here (motions to      diaphram) than from your
throat.' I don't      like the idea of 'formal' training, it has      far too
many rules and conventions      that are later hard to break out of . . .&quot;</P>
<P>    IT IS QUITE obvious from the cover of      'The Kick Inside', her debut
album, that      Ms. Bush is Orientally influenced, but      apparently it was
not meant to take on      such an oriental feel.</P>
<P>    &quot;I think it went a bit over the top,      actually. We had the
kite, and as there      is a song on the album by that name,      and as the
kite is traditionally oriental,      we painted the dragon on. But I think     
the lettering was just a bit too much.      No matter. On the whole I was     
surprised at the amount of control I      actually had with the album
production.      Though I didn't choose the musicians,&quot;     (Andrew Powell,
producer and arranger did).     &quot;I thought they were terrific. </P>
<P>    &quot;I was lucky to be able to express      myself as much as I did,
especially      with this being a debut album. Andrew      was really into
working together,      rather than pushing everyone around. I      basically
chose which tracks went on,      put harmonies where I wanted them . . .      I
was there throughout the entire mix.      I feel that's very important. Ideally,
I      would like to learn enough of the      technical side of things to be
able to      produce my own stuff eventually.&quot;</P>
<P>    Kate has a habit of gesturing      constantly with her hands, and often 
    expressing herself with unspellable      sounds and grimaces. Though this   
  make tape transcriptions difficult, it      does accentuate something which is
     very much a part of her, 'movement      expression'. She has studied under 
    the inimitable Lindsay Kemp, mime      artiste, an experience shared with   
  Kate's favourite musician, David      Bowie.</P>
<P>    &quot;I admire actresses and actors      terribly and think it's an
amazing craft.      But singing and performing your songs      should be the
same thing. At this point I      would rather develop my music and     
expressing it physically, as opposed to      having a script. I think I'm much
better      off as a wailer. . .&quot;</P>
<P>    She is, indeed a beautiful woman.      Carved ivory, with nary a nick.
So      obviously there is no way she can      avoid becoming the target for
sexist      minds. Although she does not      advocate this reaction, she's not 
    flustered by it. After all, it is a      compliment.</P>
<P>    &quot;As long as it does not interfere with      my progress as a
singer/songwriter, it      doesn't matter. I just wish people      would think
of that first, I would be      foolish to think that people don't look. I     
suppose in some ways it helps to get      more people to listen . . .&quot;</P>
<P>    'THE KICK Inside' suggests a        keen interest in mysticism.</P>
<P>    &quot;I try to work on myself spiritually,      and am always trying to
improve my      outlook on life. We really abuse all that      we've got,
assuming that we are so      superior as beings, taking the liberties      of
sticking up cement stuff all over the      place. I think there is a lot to
astrology,      and the effect the moon has upon us      all' but I hate the way
it's become so      trendy now.</P>
<P>    &quot;I'm a vegetarian, and now that's      trendy as well . . . but
what annoys      me the most is the way people are so      automatically cynical
about astrology.      I mean, like the Greeks put an      incredible amount of
hard work into      carefully planned geometric charts,      based purely on
mathematics. People      just shrug off. It's the same with      coincidence, as
I said in the song      'Strange Phenonema',&quot;</P>
<P>    At first, Kate was opposed to      having any sort of management,     
feeling strongly that less mistakes are      made if you deal with situations   
  yourself, directly. But she quickly      found out that this sort of idealism 
    does not work, and now has Peter      Lyster-Todd handling her business
affairs.</P>
<P>    &quot;He has worked more on the      theatrical side of entertainment
than      music. I like that. I think most managers      are crooks, greedy and
non-musical,      and that mixing with other music      managers is contageous.
I think Peter      will be amazing . . . &quot;</P>
<P>    There are tentative plans for a Kate      Bush tour in the late spring,
but it is      only being discussed at this point.</P>
<P>    To accompany Kate on the road will      be Cuban drummer Sergio
Castillo;      guitarist Brian Bath, bassist Del Palmer;      keyboardist Ben
Barson, and brother      Paddy Bush on mandolin and backing      vocals. Again,
primarily friends of      friends of friends, and wide-eyed      optimism.</P>
<P>    JUST AS I'M about to leave a pile of fan      mail arrives, and she
gapes, amazed,      &quot;Cor . . is all this for<EM>me </EM>??? This is     
amazing! &quot;</P>
<P>    Oh, dear, dear, Kate. Do stay     above it all. Don't ever fall into
your     very own lyrics, which could be     ironically twisted. From 'Kite':</P>
<P>    &quot;I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on     the wind.<BR>     Well,
I'm not sure if I want to be up     here at all.<BR>     And I'd like to be
back on the     ground.</P>
