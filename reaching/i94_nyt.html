<P>Two Sisters In Song... Of Sorts 
</P>
<P>by Peter Galvin 
</P>
<P>When Tori Amos burst onto the pop scene last year with her album &quot;Little
 Earthquakes,&quot; critics were hard pressed to find a label to describe the
singer's  exceedingly personal, exuberantly melodic music. Was it pop, folk or
rock? Was Ms.  Amos a musical earth daughter tapping into the primordial
emotions of the human  heart or just some crackpot offering the most
self-absorbed brand of feminist  spiritualism? Regardless of the many critical
opinions Ms. Amos's arrival  engendered, the one thing almost everyone agreed on
was that she sounded a lot like  Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>Listening to both artists' new albums, Ms. Bush's &quot;Red Shoes: and Ms.
Amos's  &quot;Under the Pink,&quot; one easily hears the similarities between
the two  singer-songwriters. Both have high, frilly voices capable of conveying
girlish  insouciance, pouting allure and shrieking madness; both write
piano-based melodies  heavily influenced by the emotional sweep of classical
music and the drama and  bombast of opera; and both possess a keenly imaginative
romantic sensibility that  challenges patriarchal notions of love, sex and
religion. But Ms. Bush is more of a  musical philosopher than Ms. Amos, divining
meaning from her experience and  giving it universal scope. Ms. Amos's songs are
like psychological case studies,  providing listeners with a vicarious catharsis
rather than any actual insight into  existence. 
</P>
<P>Emerging in 1978 amid the abrasive anarchy of the British punk movement, Ms.
 Bush's debut album, &quot;The Kick Inside,&quot; as a musical anomaly, what
with its heady  art-rock arrangements, baroque vocals and grandiloquent literary
allusions.  Subsequent albums found Ms. Bush experimenting with musical textures
through  the use of synthesizers, multilayered vocals and world-music
instrumentation. Ms.  Bush was seeking increasingly complex ways to express the
landscape of  consciousness and the soul's connection to God and the
supernatural world. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (Columbia 53737; CD and cassette), Ms. Bush,
35, is in a  wiser, less breathlessly romantic mode. Gone is the grandiose
mysticism of songs like  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Running up That
Hill.&quot; Instead, Ms. Bush's quest for  meaning is more earthbound,
concentrating on the pangs of the heart and the joys of  the flesh. In the
breakup ballad, &quot;You're the One,&quot; Ms. Mush places the listener  firmly
in the real world as she sings to her ex-lover, &quot;It's all right, I'' come
'round  when you're not in/ And I'll pick up all my things.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the Eastern-flavored &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; Ms. Bush connects sex
with food,  imagining herself a piece of fruit; &quot;Split me open/ With
devotion,&quot; she demands  jubilantly. The music, too, is much more intimate
than on her past efforts. Ms. Bush  no longer sounds as if she's addressing the
heavens; her vocals now rarely reach  their former ear-piercing levels. 
</P>
<P>The album's title track, based on Michael Powell's 1948 movie of the same
name,  illustrates the tragedy that can result when dreams and reality collide.
An aspiring  dancer puts on a pair of red shoes and dances herself to death to
the furious sound  of lute and zither. Another song about fate, the funk-driven
&quot;Why Should I Love  You?,&quot; a track Ms. Bush wrote and recorded with
Prince, contemplates the spiritual  forces that conspire to bring two lovers
together. 
</P>
<P>Ms. Amos is less concerned with what brings two lovers together than what 
happens to them when they connect. On the affecting &quot;Little Earthquakes,&quot;
the  singer sang of her sexual awakening at the hands of men who were interested
only  in her body and who lorded their power over her as if it was sent straight
from God.  Elsewhere on &quot;Earthquakes,&quot; Ms. Amos detailed her
disillusionment with religion  and the pain of forging an identity in a world
that wants you to be something you're  not. The songs melded Ms. Amos's melodies
with studio touches like sampled  keyboards and strings, expertly giving the
singer's passionate songs their due. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;Under the Pink&quot; (Atlantic 82567; CD and cassette), Ms. Amos,
30, refines her  cabaret-meets-classical style, almost completely forgetting the
use of guitars and  drums. Instead, she interprets her melodies mainly with her
piano, which she plays  to gorgeous effect. 
</P>
<P>The singer is in a less confrontational mode on &quot;Pink.&quot; Indeed,
the only song in  which Ms. Amos actually confronts an oppressor head on is also
the most  studio-enhanced: on &quot;God,&quot; the singer taunts the Creator for
being sloppy and lazy,  with sampled screeches giving the track a predatory
quality. Yet, as on  &quot;Earthquakes,&quot; Ms. Amos continues to use her
personal experience to challenge  religious and sexual conventions. In &quot;Icicle,&quot;
she sings about masturbating in her  room while her family is downstairs saying
their prayers. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the singer seems a bit strapped for provocative subject
matter on  &quot;Pink.&quot; Many of the lyrics are frustratingly oblique, as if
Ms. Amos is trying to hide  the fact that she doesn't have much to say this time
around. Because the impact of  her music depends so much on her confessional
approach, the third-person,  observational stance of several of the songs on &quot;Pink&quot;
renders them emotionally flat. 
</P>
<P>Perhaps now, having seemingly exorcised many of her personal demons, Ms. 
Amos will turn her gaze outward, translating what she sees and feels into a more
 universal vision. After all, it works for Kate Bush.
