(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: MTV &quot;News At Night&quot;
Jan. 1990 
</P>
<P>Chris'n'Vickie here. Hold off on sending those fruitcakes to Empty-vee. This
 just appeared on MTV &quot;News At Night&quot; as the last feature at 11:55
CST. 
</P>
<P>Female Voice: Unknown woman. 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: Tim Sommer (of Post-Modern MTV &amp; Hugo Largo) 
</P>
<P>Host: John Norris (sitting in for Kurt Loder) 
</P>
<P>Host: Long before it became trendy for big stars to take two or three years
between  albums, England's mysterious Kate Bush was keeping a low profile and
laboring  over her work. In fact in twelve years Bush has released only six LPs.
She went  the entire nineteen-eighties without going on tour and she doesn't
have any plans  to go on the road right now. But she does have a new album in
stores titled &quot;The  Sensual World&quot;, and we recently sat down with Kate
for a look inside her own  rather illusive and ethereal world. 
</P>
<P>{Music: &quot;Love and Anger&quot;} 
</P>
<P>{Visual: Video of &quot;Love and Anger&quot; (Kate moving backwards into the
blue light)} 
</P>
<P>Female Voice: Ah, the mysterious Kate Bush. Tell me something about her. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: Very heavily processed tight shot of Kate's face. Solarised.} 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: Well since late nineteen-seventies she's put out a record about
once  every two years, and she's just released a new album &quot;The Sensual
World&quot;. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: shot of &quot;The Sensual World&quot; album cover zooms in.} 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: She's got a spectacular voice, she make really dramatic videos,
but she  never tours. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: Posterized shot of Kate looking back behind her chair. This remains
as  background...} 
</P>
<P>Kate: So that's the way I am, I guess. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: Small box with Kate in it, floats dowm left side, during the above}

</P>
<P>Female Voice: She toured once didn't she? 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: Yeah, way back in ninteen-seventy-eight but she never toured
again. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; dancing with band. Crossfades to &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;} 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: You see she sort of exists only as this magical character you
see in videos  and hear on records. 
</P>
<P>Kate: And again that's a very subjective.....opinion. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: First full-screen, head-and-shoulders shot, of Kate. She is wearing
a dark  grey blouse and the &quot;Love and Anger&quot; earrings. She is wearing
a very small  necklace. Her name is keyed over at bottom of screen. She looks to
her upper  left, searching, before saying &quot;opinion&quot;.} 
</P>
<P>Female Voice: But you talked to her didn't you? 
</P>
<P>{Visual: When Kate isn't talking, it is either shots from &quot;Love and
Anger&quot; or  processed two-tone, yellow and brown, loose footage.} 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: Yeah, and she's very guarded. 
</P>
<P>Female Voice: Guarded? 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: Yeah. Guarded. 
</P>
<P>Kate: I wanted my work to speak. Not me as a person. Because I feel that's
what I  want to give to the world..is..is the work that I do, not really me, or
what I have  to say. 
</P>
<P>Female Voice: What did she say about this never touring thing? 
</P>
<P>{Visual: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; video. Kate throws glitter} 
</P>
<P>Kate: After the last tour, which was a long time ago, I just felt very
vulnerable. I'd  been through tremendous public exposure, at a young age, and
um..I hadn't  really stopped since it had started. And I think, really, over
these years of being  in the studio and being quite reclusive in some ways, I've
gained a lot of my  strength back, that I did lose. And that's very important
for me to keep my  creative energies intact. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: dissolve to cover edit} 
</P>
<P>And I think in many ways, retreating like I have, has helped me to be taken
more  seriously as an artist, and um.., (purses her lips...lip smacking noise),
that's good  for me because that's what I've wanted, I've wanted to sort of
quietly get on  with my work. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; spins in with Kate standing there with
orb and septre in  front of ballet dancers.} {Music: &quot;Love and Anger&quot;(gets
louder and then drops  when Male Voice speaks} 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: She definitely wants her videos and records to be this magical
place.  Can I tell you something weird? 
</P>
<P>Female Voice: Yeah? 
</P>
<P>Male Voice: Well. During the whole interview, I was really distracted by
this  yellow-green aura that was surrounding her body. I'm completely serious. 
</P>
<P>{Visual: Processed shot of Kate. Her face is in the clear but she is
surrounded by a  reddish color. Dissolves to normal shot when she starts
speaking.} 
</P>
<P>Kate: I think there's an awful lot of uh..sympathetic..magic almost, that
goes on in  art. Where people do want to be..something other than what they are.

</P>
<P>{Visual: Video from &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; with
audio from  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;} 
</P>
<P>More and more I think, this is, kind of, the special thing about music, that
it's not to  do with *language*, 
</P>
<P>{Visual: Back to normal video} 
</P>
<P>that is connected with words, it's to do with,almost a sort of..subconsious
language,  that people understand, that sounds can create feelings in other
people, um..you  can actually say something to someone without words by using
shapes of sounds,..  and it seems like a totally facinating thing to me, and,
uh, I mean music is just  so.....(phuhh..breath expelling noise, much like the
ships in &quot;Astroids&quot;) It's mind  boggling isn't it? Don't you think? 
</P>
<P>Host: And how Kate. Kate Bush. Her new album is &quot;The Sensual World&quot;.

</P>
<P>---
</P>
<P>Well it's about time, isn't it? There should be more of this interview to
come on  &quot;Post-Modern MTV&quot; and &quot;120 Minutes&quot; and &quot;MTV
Music News&quot;. We will, of course,  be suffering through hours of horrific,
sexist, stupid videos to get these little pieces  of Kate interviews. Pity us.

<P>Date: Tue, 2 Jan 90 12:52:37 EST <BR> From: woj &lt;woiccare@clutx.clarkson.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: KaTe on MTV's News at Night 
</P>
<P>While accidentially flipping through the channels just a few minutes ago, I
caught  MTV's other-news-guy saying, &quot;Up next, we'll take a peek into the
magical world  of KaTe Bush&quot; (paraphrased of course). I quickly ran up
stairs to find a tape for the  VCR, came back down and found that it was wound
to the middle of VH-1's  Sensual World Special, so had to set it up first,
thereby missing the first few seconds  of the clip. After that, it wouldn't
record so I missed it anyways. 
</P>
<P>Still, I'll try to paraphrase what she said. 
</P>
<P>On touring: she said that the Tour of Life left her feeling very &quot;vulnerable,&quot;
and  that this was at the heart of why she hasn't toured since then. Also
wrapped up in  that was a bit about how she wanted to be taken seriously as an
artist, which was  also related to the touring (or lack thereof). They talked a
little bit about her videos  and the lengthy delay between albums (of course,
they neglected to realize that her  first three were within a year or two of
each other). I can't remember much  more...not that there was. 
</P>
<P>Oh, the thing that I thought funny was when the announcer said that he saw a
 yellow and green aura around KaTe throughout the interview. Right after that
little  tidbit of info, they cut back to the interview with some strange special
effects to  hear her talk about music and its magic. 
</P>
<P>I really wonder about these guys sometimes.

<P>The 15 second interview from MTV last night: 
</P>
<P>Here's what Kate said: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I have to be careful that I'm not inaccessible totally to
people, because  obviously, when you've made an album you want people to know
it's out there, um,  so that if people want to hear it, they can.&quot;

</P>
<P>Here's the interview excerpt from last Thurdsay's Post Modern Show on MTV. 
The words &quot;KATE BUSH ON: SUDDEN FAME&quot; appear on a black background.
You  hear Kate talking. In a couple of seconds, this shot fades and you see Kate
against a  blank wall. She says: 
</P>
<P> &quot;Everything was so different. I had a life that was no longer that. In
fact, I was  really taken away from making music, which was a very hard thing to
come to terms  with. I was spending more of my time doing interviews, promoting,
traveling, doing  televisions, and I started thinking, you know, hang on, I'm
doing this instead of  making music, but what I want to be doing is making
music. So I kind of had to take  a hold of that and reverse the whole situation
so that most time is being spent  creatively, and then the promotional work back
that up at a later point.&quot;

</P>
<P>Last night on Post Modern MTV, they showed yet another short excerpt from 
their Kate interview. This one was about twenty seconds long. She says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Although a lot of time went into thinking and writing, um, all the
performances  were very spontaneous and recorded very quickly, which, I think
it's nice of people  to know that because often when you're aware of an album
taking a long time you  think, 'God, they must have spent weeks getting this
solo on,' you know. And  actually it wasn't like that at all. Stuff was recorded
very quickly.&quot;

</P>
<P>As somebody just posted, they played &quot;The Sensual World&quot; on
Post-Modern MTV  last night. I hope this means they've added it to their
rotation. 
</P>
<P>In any case, they showed yet another short interview clip just before the
video.  Kate said: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've still got a lot of work to do on the album, because I guess, um,
there'll  probably be another couple of singles. And for me that means working
on videos,  which I have to say I do find very exciting creatively. It's
fabulous making a record  and if you have a song that's visually interesting and
you can treat it like a small  film, I find that very exciting.&quot;

</P>
<P>They played &quot;The Sensual World&quot; again last night on Post-Modern
MTV. Before  it, they showed yet another tiny interview clip. Kate says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I find it interesting how they actually are very similar processes,
film and music.  You know, one's audial [?] and one's visual and there are a lot
of parallels. I learn  so much every time I work on a video. So in some ways I
think I'm intrigued about  the idea of making a film of some kind that would
incorporate music and. . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>The end of the sentence is obscured by the bells at the opening of the song.
