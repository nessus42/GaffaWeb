(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Delia Smith's Cookery interview UK TV 1980 
</P>
<P>53. Delia Smith's Cookery: Kate is interviewed about vegetarianism, and
shows  examples of her favourite salads. U.K. TV, 1980 (?). 
</P>
<P>This clip was apparently taped in the garden of the family home. Kate talks
with  great enthusiasm about the healthful dishes which she and her
sister-in-law have  prepared for the programme; and Kate makes a touching case
for vegetarianism,  concluding: &quot;I hope people will think about it, because
there really is a lot in  vegetables!&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED. I haven't actually SEEN this
clip,  but have transcribed it from a cassette tape provided by IED, so I have
not attempted  to describe any movements or the like] 
</P>
<P>Intro: ... of proving that point, I went to see someone who I think has
energy PLUS!,  the very talented and lovely Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate, how long have you been a vegetarian, all your life? 
</P>
<P>K: No, I haven't. It's about five years now. 
</P>
<P>I: And what made you decide in the first place? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think ever since I've been quite young I've always felt, not bad,
but a bit  guilty about eating meat because the fact that animals are killed and
in a lot of  cases in a very necessary way, you know, where it's a big
exploitation of animals.  And one day I just had this feeling and tried to a bit
of meat and this feeling - it  was so raw that I just identified immediately
with the fact that it was an animal.  That this thing was alive and it had been
killed for me to eat it and I thought,  &quot;no, I'm not into this.&quot; So I
thought I'd become a vegetarian. And I didn't have a  clue, I had no idea what I
could eat all I knew was that people didn't eat meat or  fish. And I used to eat
a lot of chocolate, so I lived for the next week off  chocolate and tea. 
</P>
<P>I: Well that's not very good... 
</P>
<P>K: Well, no. This is what I thought so eventually through meeting other
friends that  were vegetarians and books and things I managed to get a diet
together. And it's  fantastic, because when I ate meat I wouldn't touch
vegetables, I hated them. But  since I've become vegetarian I'll eat really only
vegetables, you know. So it's  really broadened my diet. 
</P>
<P>I: Now, in front of us here you've got some of your favorite vegetarian
dishes. Is this  the sorta typical thing you'd serve if you have friends coming
'round? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it is really. My sister-in-law in fact cooked this. She's made a
selection of  salads, but probably what I'd do is just put it all in one, just
make a big salad. But  it is what I wold cook. 
</P>
<P>I: Let's have a look at this one first. This is vegetable, what sort of
vegetables are in  here? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, you've got carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes, onion, and peppers. 
</P>
<P>I: And they're just sorta cooked in their own juices. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, she did them just naturally. Home cooked them all. She even cooked
them in  [marlma ???] - that's like a good gravy substitute and soy sauce is
very good. All  sorts of things. 
</P>
<P>I: That's going to be served with it? 
</P>
<P>K: Brown rice. 
</P>
<P>I: And how do you cook the brown rice? 
</P>
<P>K: It's very easy, really, you just boil it in water and salt. 
</P>
<P>I: It's really nutty and crunchy. 
</P>
<P>K: It's wonderful, it's so good for you. You know, it's the real stuff. 
</P>
<P>I: Now, this here, what's this mixture because this really does look
interesting? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, that's roasted sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and they're in soy
sauce. 
</P>
<P>I: I see. So it's a little bit of soy sauce just to give them a flavor, and
roast them. And  how do you eat them. 
</P>
<P>K: Well you just kinda like just sprinkle them over salads, which is
fantastic. 
</P>
<P>I: I see. 
</P>
<P>K: But in fact it's quite nice by itself. It makes you feel a little bit
like a parrot.  [Interviewer laughs] But they're really good. 
</P>
<P>I: And this here? 
</P>
<P>K: That's yogurt with cucumber, and chives on top, and it's got garlic in
it. 
</P>
<P>I: And what would you serve that with? 
</P>
<P>K: You'd serve it with a salad, just put it over the salad or on the sides,
sprinkle in.  It's very good with honey. 
</P>
<P>I: This salad here, what's this from? 
</P>
<P>K: It's called a waldorf salad... 
</P>
<P>I: Of course! 
</P>
<P>K: [??? inaudible] 
</P>
<P>I: They ran out of waldorfs! 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! But I put waldorfs in it! 
</P>
<P>I: [Laughs] But it looks like a [harfast ???] 
</P>
<P>K: And celery and walnut with mayonnaise. That's fantastic, actually. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, that looks lovely. And I notice you've got the skins [??? inaudible]
salad. 
</P>
<P>K: Well they're so much natural goodness in skins that you just throw away
and it's  really silly, because there's half the goodness there. 
</P>
<P>I: And you also get so much more color. 
</P>
<P>K: I think so, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Well that looks really interesting, that one next door. What's in there? 
</P>
<P>K: Well there's oranges, been sprouts, brussle seeds, and water [??? clam] 
</P>
<P>I: And would you put a dressing on that? 
</P>
<P>K: You could do, yeah. I personally don't plan to dress mine so much. 
</P>
<P>I: And you've just got the cool flavor. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I [??? inaudible] that's a very fresh salad, that one, it's very
[??? inaudible] 
</P>
<P>I: Lovely. And what's next store? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, this is yogurt with honey. 
</P>
<P>I: And does that go with the fruit salad, or...? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it does. You could use it separately, but it's obviously designed
[??? just like a  cream] 
</P>
<P>I: What have you got in your fruit salad? 
</P>
<P>K: It's fresh fruit, which I think is the only way to make fruit salad. I
can't believe  that people make them out of [??? tunes], you know it's so wrong.

</P>
<P>I: No. 
</P>
<P>K: This [??? can] is something that my sister-in-law made up. You put
concentrated  apple juice in it. 
</P>
<P>I: Oh that's good. 
</P>
<P>K: And it's fantastic, because it sets everything up and it's such a fruity
taste. 
</P>
<P>I: And instead of using the dreaded sugar. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! 
</P>
<P>I: And you've got some nice hazel nuts in there that have been soaking in
the juice,  which must give it a nice punchy texture. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I think it's very good to put nuts in fruit salads, before you put
them in  cakes. They are things that I think people miss out because they think
nuts in  chocolate - or, you know, there's a very selective area where you can
use nuts,  and I think you can put them in anything. 
</P>
<P>I: I agree. And so you're quite happy with your vegetarian diet, so you'll
go on  being a vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>K: I really hope so, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: And you're quite into cooking now, I think. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I love cooking. One thing I find hard is getting the time. And also
 sometimes when I cook and I make like phone-calls and that so by the time I've 
come back with the phone there's this sizzled thing sitting in the oven. 
</P>
<P>I: [Laughs] That's what cookery books never allow for. 
</P>
<P>K: No. 
</P>
<P>I: Anyway, thanks very much Kate for sharing with us. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you, my pleasure. I hope people will think about it because I
really do  think there's a lot in vegetables. 
</P>
<P>K + I together: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>Announcer: Well I agree with that!
