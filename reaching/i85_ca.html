Subject: More Canadian Interviews 1985
</p>



<p>88. Good Rockin' Tonight, Much Music, The New Music, Toronto Evening News, 
etc.: excerpts from interviews (all dating from the same day, in the same Toronto 
studios) conducted by Christopher Ward, Nan Devitt and Daniel Richler in late 
November, 1985. 
</p>

<p>These interviews have a strikingly better atmosphere than their U.S. 
counterparts, which had been conducted only a day or two before. Much of the 
credit for this must go to the excellent interviewing techniques of the Canadian 
hosts, particularly Mr. Ward and Mr. Richler. Both men had prepared well for their 
interviews and both show evident respect for their guest on camera. Kate responds, 
consequently, with greater frankness and fluidity than she had in any other 
interviews of the 1985 promotional campaign. 
</p>

interviews! ]

<p>[Interview 1: The MuchMusic Interview. - Running Up That Hill is played] 
</p>



<p>I: Running Up That Hill, from Kate Bush. And please welcome my guest, Kate Bush. 
Very nice to have you here. 
</p>

<p>K: It's a pleasure to be here! 
</p>

<p>I: Yes, indeed! Congratulations on the success of Hounds of Love. 
</p>

<p>K: Thank you, it's fantastic! 
</p>

<p>I: It is going well isn't it? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes. 
</p>

<p>I: The UK is no surprise, but it looks like North America is finally falling in line. 
Are you happy about that? 
</p>

<p>K: I'm very happy. It's always great when people like your music. 
</p>

<p>I: You said that you anguished long over this record. Is that typical for you, recording 
wise? 
</p>

<p>K: I think so yes. I think, um, certainly since the third album it has been like that. It 
just seems to be a long process. You go into it to be that involved and before you 
know it's dragging you behind it, until it's finished. 
</p>

<p>I: Is that partly result of having your own studio now? That you felt you had to work 
out the kinks in that situation and learn to work in your own facility? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes, I think it was the last album that made me realize I needed one because I 
was being so prohibited by the amount of money it was costing every hour that I 
thought it was actually being anti-productive to what I wanted to do. We work 
very experimentally and it takes time. So it really made sense to get our own 
studio together. 
</p>

<p>I: I understand that you moved to the country fairly recently. Is that part of the 
process of building a home studio as well? Did that all come part and partial? 
</p>

<p>K: It did really. It was a kind of re-organization I wanted to do between the last 
album and this where I moved from the city to the country, we got the studio 
together, and I just took some time to get back in training. That kind of thing. I 
think I made some of my best decisions during that time. 
</p>

<p>I: Are you becoming more reclusive as a result? 
</p>

<p>K: I think I have extremes, where I'm very reclusive while I'm working and then 
totally non-reclusive when I come out to promote and say to people &quot;here's the 
album.&quot; 
</p>

<p>I: Would you consider yourself a social creature at the best of times? Do you have a 
community of musicians, aside from your family obviously and those you work 
with, that you would see regularly and party with? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes I think there's, again, two parts of me. One that's a very social beast and the 
other side of me is probably very quiet and likes to work alone, and in fact can't 
really work if there's more than a few people around. 
</p>

<p>I: Do you have special work habits that you subscribe to? You seem like a very 
disciplined artist, just judging by your work. Do you have a special place you go to 
work, a certain environment, and certain hours? Do you do that? 
</p>

<p>K: I think the studio has become that disciplined place that I can go to now. It used 
to be my music room, wherever I had the piano. And I think it's helped me 
tremendously to actually have an environment where I can go to work. It just 
makes it that much easier for me to concentrate. 
</p>

<p>I: And do you set hours that you go there? 
</p>

<p>K: Not actually set hours, it depends how I feel. But normally I'll go there for a 
certain amount each day, depending on how well the ideas are coming through. 
So it depends. 
</p>

<p>I: We mentioned the old videos and you said you would like to see Breathing. What 
was it about particularly about that one that you felt was a success? 
</p>

<p>K: I think it's one of the few that I've done that I can say that I'm quite happy with 
some of the things we did in it. It's one of those things. The way you make a 
video, quite often the song isn't lending itself to the kind of visual ideas you'd 
like it to. And with Breathing, I think it had such a strong story that it was easier 
for us to visualize something that we'd felt was powerful. 
</p>

<p>I: The song sounds like it was built of visual ideas to begin with, to some extent. 
</p>

<p>K: I think when I'm writing songs, I do have quite strong visual ideas, but they're 
not necessarily video visual ideas if you know what I mean... 
</p>

<p>I: Yes. 
</p>

<p>K: I think in order to get to a place, or to consider yourself in someone else's 
position, you try to imagine an environment. And I think in some ways you think 
quite visually about that. 
</p>

<p>I: Lets take a look at Breathing from Kate Bush on MuchMusic and we'll be right 
back. 
</p>

<p>[Breathing is played] 
</p>

<p>I: There you have Breathing from Kate Bush on MuchMusic and my guest, Kate 
Bush. Very nice to have you hear. You suffered a fate in the early goings of 
you're career of being somewhat of a pin-up girl in the British pop mags. [Kate 
laughs]. How did you deal with that? 
</p>

<p>K: I think what worried me was that it was going to stop people taking my music 
seriously. I've always found it very complimentary if people said that they found 
me attractive. And my worry is really that it would get in the way of my music. 
Its not that, um... I find that so much of a problem as...as if people wouldn't 
accept my music. But I don't think that that has been a problem. I think people 
do seem to accept my music for its sake. 
</p>

<p>I: And does your sexuality have a role in your music? 
</p>

<p>K: Well I think that's something I find very confusing because I think that the 
essence of all art is sensuality. And sexuality, I mean I don't suppose I 
understand it fully, but I always tend to think that that's something that's 
projected. And that sensuality is really were art is at. It's a much more subtle 
form of expression. 
</p>

<p>I: You have interesting theories. There was an interview that I saw that Daniel 
Richler for the New Music did last year, he was visiting in England, and his show 
is done out of this building as well. And there was a quote where you said &quot;the 
artist is like a magpie, pitting out little bits of gold, and storing them away&quot; to use 
later. What are you picking through these days? 
</p>

<p>K: [Laughs] I think the whole process is like that, you're continually looking for 
lyrical ideas, musical inspirations, people that would be good to work with, people 
that you want to involve in your work. I think all the time you have to keep 
looking and listening because it's that accumulation of things that all your ideas 
and your work depends on. 
</p>

<p>I: What are you looking at and listening to these days? 
</p>

<p>K: Um, well at the moment I'm caught in the middle of a big promotional trip... 
</p>

<p>I: Of course. 
</p>

<p>K: ...but it's interesting for me. I'm getting a great deal of feedback from people 
which is incredibly rewarding. And also I suppose one positive side of it is it 
makes you think about areas of yourself and your music that you wouldn't do 
unless people were asking you these questions. 
</p>

<p>I: So you don't have any current obsessions in terms of...oh film or music or art that 
you might pass on to us? 
</p>

<p>K: I think my current obsessions are perhaps films. Between the last album and this 
one I got very into our video machine at home and taping lots of films off the 
television. I think they've become very inspirational for me. And I think perhaps 
my video work is moving away from being theatrically and dance oriented to 
perhaps being more cinematically influenced. 
</p>

<p>I: We have the video for Sat In Your Lap, do you have a few thoughts on that one to 
pass along? 
</p>

<p>K: Um, well I think that's one of the fun videos that we did, where the song is 
about the search for knowledge. And um, I suppose we just wanted to have a bit 
of fun in this video and try to express that [makes funny voice] &quot;we're looking 
for that thing&quot;, yeah. [Laughs] 
</p>

<p>I: This is Kate Bush, Sat In Your Lap, on MuchMusic. 
</p>

<p>[Sat In Your Lap is played] 
</p>

<p>I: Christopher Ward on MuchMusic with my special guest, Kate Bush. And Kate as 
early as about 1980 you were experimenting with the Fairlight computer musical 
instrument. Has that changed the way you approach creating music? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes, very much so. I think it was one of the best thing to happen for me along 
side rhythm machines. Not only has it helped with the initial writing process, 
were I'm getting associations off the sounds straight away as I start writing the 
song, but also from an arrangement point of view, where if I want strings or 
brass on a track I can work out an arrangement on the fairlight with that 
particular sampled sound and then if want get the real musicians in to redo it. 
</p>

<p>I: Yeah, well your use of it has become more and more extensive. But you were 
perhaps one of the first artists that I ever knew, along with perhaps Peter 
Gabriel, who used the Fairlight at all. 
</p>

<p>K: I was very lucky in that I was at the studio where they decided to demonstrate 
the machine at a very early stage. It had only been in the country for a while and 
they were just setting up the company. As soon as I saw it I knew that I had to 
have one, and it was going to become a very important part of my work. 
</p>

<p>I: Are you an aggressive business person? We hear stories that on the first album a 
very young Kate Bush insisted Wuthering Heights be the first single, against 
some resistance. Is that true, and are you, in fact, very aggressive about your 
business? 
</p>

<p>K: I don't know if I'm aggressive about my business, but I do a lot of the time feel 
strongly about what I want or how I want to see it presented. It is an expression 
of me at some point and it seems wrong that as soon as it goes out into the world 
it should leave me and my expression behind. Wuthering Heights I felt was a 
much more interesting single then perhaps some that were being suggested at 
that time. And um, I just felt it was a good idea at the time to hang [slurs words 
???- out with it ??]. I did feel strongly about it, [makes cute Kate confused face], 
yes. 
</p>

<p>I: It certainly paid off, number one record in the U.K. 
</p>

<p>K: It would seem so, yeah. 
</p>

<p>I: Do you rely on dreams a lot for inspiration for your songs? 
</p>

<p>K: It's strange, a few people have started asking me that question recently, and I 
would so no, that I can't actually think of any song that a dream has directly 
inspired. No. 
</p>

<p>I: Are you a keeper of a dream diary or something like that? 
</p>

<p>K: No I'm not, no. 
</p>

<p>I: I've experimented with that sort of thing and it's interesting -there's a 
surrealistic quality to some of your songs that might lead one to think that, [Kate 
makes polite expression] but not the case? 
</p>

<p>K: No, not consciously but... 
</p>

<p>I: Now I wanted to ask you about the second side of The Hounds Of Love LP - it's a 
conceptual piece called The Ninth Wave. And what led you to that concept and 
how did you go about developing it? 
</p>

<p>K: It's quite hard to pinpoint the initial inspiration, but I'm sure that it came from, 
um, a combination of war movies where people were, soldiers were, either 
thrown out of the ship or a plane into the sea. And that whole strength of 
imagery of water, of the sea, this enormous great power with this tiny little 
human being in it. And I suppose the whole parallel to things likes sensory 
depravation, where if you're in the water long enough, you know you start, ah, 
your mind starts traveling. So it gave me a vehicle to travel to different places and 
yet keep a theme. 
</p>

<p>I: Did you take yourself to an isolation tank or anything to achieve that particular 
sensation? 
</p>

<p>K: [Laughs] No, it's something that I would certainly like to experience. But I spent 
a lot of time writing, particularly the lyrics, by water. I was standing by the sea or 
by lakes. So a lot of the time there was water stimulus. 
</p>

<p>I: We have your brand new video for Cloudbusting, also from Hounds of Love. And, 
ah, I read an article in Number One magazine and they said something very 
unusual happened during the shooting of it. Is that all rumors? 
</p>

<p>K: [Laughs] Yes, I can't think of anything! 
</p>

<p>I: They talked about ghosts and all sorts of things, so... 
</p>

<p>K: Did they? 
</p>

<p>I: Do you want to straightened out any of those rumors for us? 
</p>

<p>K: Well as far as I know there were no ghosts present, but there were lots of human 
beings. And a particularly good actor called Donald Sutherland. 
</p>

<p> I: Of course, a well known Canadian actor as well. 
</p>

<p>K: Absolutely, yes. 
</p>

<p>I: So tell us about the video, what were you trying to accomplish? K: I really wanted 
it to be a short piece of film. I didn't want it to be seen as a promotional clip or 
even a video, but as a film. And part of that idea was having an actor, hopefully a 
great actor, that would play the part of the father, and myself playing the part of 
the young boy. And the song was inspired a book that's all about a very special 
relationship between the guy that wrote the book, as a child and his father. His 
father was a very respected psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and had lots of theories on 
life energy, and also had this machine called a cloudbuster that could make it 
rain. And together they'd go out into the dry desert and make it rain and this 
was a very magical moment for the child. 
</p>

<p>K: It's called A Book Of Dreams, and the man that wrote it is called Peter Reich. 
And unfortunately the peak of the book is that his fathers arrested, his beliefs 
were considered outrageous, people afraid of things that they didn't know - 
especially at that time. And it was very, very hard for the child to cope without 
his father. And in some ways the connection with rain, for him every time it rains 
he thinks of his father, so its a positive of him coping without him. 
</p>

<p>I: Kate thank you very much for joining us today, it's really a pleasure to meet you. 
And I know that there are fans across this country who love you dearly and 
would very much like to see you perform here, so we hope that you will be able 
to come back to North America and... 
</p>

<p>K: Thank you. 
</p>

<p>I: ...we'll see you on stage. I think I have a present somewhere. Yes here it is. [Kate 
laughs, he hands here a MuchMusic shirt]. A little memento to take with you. 
</p>

<p>K: [Makes funny Kate voice] For me??? 
</p>

<p>I: For you!!! Please wear it in good health. 
</p>

<p>K: Thank you. Really nice to meet you. 
</p>

<p>I: Thanks very much Kate Bush. 
</p>

<p>K: Thank you. 
</p>

<p>I: And here we have the brand new video for Cloudbusting on MuchMusic. 
</p>

<p>K: [Looks again at shirt] Oh...! 
</p>

<p>[Cloudbusting is played]

<p>----------------------
</p>



<p>[Interview 2: With Daniel Richler] 
</p>



<p>I: When you last met, you said that The Dreaming had been something of a 
traumatic album for you, or at least had reflected traumatic experiences of yours, 
but that the new record, The Hounds Of Love, was going to be a happier thing. 
Do you still stick to that? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes, I do think this has go a much more positive energy. Not necessarily that the 
last album was dark, but it was dealing with intensities of emotion. Perhaps a 
more introverted album and this is more outward and happy, yeah. 
</p>

<p>I: You have this so called Running Up That Hill in which you want to make a deal 
with God. What exactly is the deal you want to make? 
</p>

<p>K: It's the two people in the song, a man and a woman, that what to make a deal 
with God in order to swap places with each other. That if the man could be the 
woman, and vise-versa, they would understand what its like from that other 
person's point of view and that perhaps there'd be less problems in the 
relationship. 
</p>

<p>[Part of Running Up That Hill is played] 
</p>

<p>I: The second side of The Hounds Of Love has a concept feel to it-there are a 
number of songs that are strung together and they're all under the sub-title of 
The Ninth Wave. What is The Ninth Wave? 
</p>

<p>K: The Ninth Wave is a quote from a poem by Tennyson. Some people have though 
that the whole side was based on this poem and in fact it's completely the other 
way around - where I'd written the whole side, wanted a title that would sum up 
the energy of it, and was looking through books, etc, to try to find a title, as I 
didn't feel it was there within the songs themselves. And I found that and it 
seemed to be such a good parallel, the fact that it's such water imagery, and he's 
talking about how waves work in cycles of nine, all building up to the ninth one, 
and then it starts again. 
</p>

<p>I: There's lots of scary water images on the Ninth Wave - a man drowning and 
trying to get out from underneath the ice, a witch being bunked, fisherman at 
sea, and so on. Where did you first get the idea to do this theme about water and 
it's frightening aspects. 
</p>

<p>K: I don't think water is something I think of as threatening, really. It's an 
incredibly beautiful thing and its one of those imageries that I think forever, both 
way back into the past and into the future, will always be used by writers. Water, 
the sea is one of those incredible images, it's so powerful, so almighty, so kind 
and so cruel. And I think, what attracted me was all kinds of things. Obviously 
the imagery there but also the idea of a tiny human being, this little thing, all 
alone in this great expanse of cruelty, that elemental force, and the contrast 
between the two. Something that I think attracts me as a writer in music as well, 
the contrast of textures, putting something with something else that perhaps isn't 
meant to go and playing with those ideas. 
</p>

<p>I: When I met you in your dance studio in London, I saw a painting against the wall 
that we were laughing about. It was a satire of that pre-Raphaelite painting of 
Ophelia drowned in the reeds, this one was in a polluted river. Now on the inside 
cover sheave of the hounds of Love there's a picture of you in the water, like 
Ophelia. Is that a deliberate connection? 
</p>

<p>K: Not a conscious connection, no, but I'm sure that that imagery is there very 
strongly. Ophelia is one of those beautiful paintings, its extraordinary. And I 
think my attraction to Ophelia in the first place is what made me get that 
painting. So it's probably still quite subconsciously strong there in me. 
</p>

<p>[An excerpt from Cloudbusting is played] 
</p>

<p>I: Your new video for Cloudbusting has got Donald Sutherland in it, and you look 
quite impish, and there's some story going on. Can you tell us where it came 
from, what it's about? 
</p>

<p>K: The song was inspired by a book, which was about the relationship between the 
man who wrote the book and his father. And it's written through his eyes when 
he was a child. There's an incredible sense of innocence in the book. And his 
father was a very respected psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and he also had a 
machine called a cloudbuster that could make it rain. And together they would go 
out and make it rain. And we really wanted to do justice to the story and the 
relationship between the two of them, that was a very special one. [Another 
excerpt from Cloudbusting] 
</p>

<p>I: Who wrote that book? 
</p>

<p>K: Peter Reich. 
</p>

<p>I: Ah, Peter Reich. And it was called Cloudbusting? 
</p>

<p>K: It was called A Book Of Dreams. 
</p>

<p>I: And does he know that you have...is he still a living writer? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes, he is and ah... 
</p>

<p>I: I should know about him I suppose. 
</p>

<p>K: Well the book wasn't totally well known. It was in print for a while and is now 
out of print. And we sent him a cassette of the song, hoping that he would like it 
and he's been very responsive, which is great for me. 
</p>

<p>[Still more of Cloudbusting is played]

<p>[Third interview - Good Rockin Tonight] 
</p>



<p>O: On behave of Good Rockin Tonight Nan Devitt talked to Kate about why she left 
school to study dance and mime. 
</p>

<p>K: I think that actual decision about going for it was just before I left school and 
that's why I left school. I didn't feel that I could get what I wanted out of school 
anymore in a way that was going to encourage me getting involved with music. I 
really had to leave and go into a more artistic kind of lifestyle and dancing was a 
particulary good one to choose I think. 
</p>

<p>	 Well, when I left school I knew very much that I wanted to go into the music 
business, that that's what I wanted to aim for. And I wanted to do something 
that would fill my day, that would be a good discipline for me, and that would be 
complimentary to the music. And dance was something that I'd only just 
discovered recently at that time. And I felt that there was a whole world of 
expression there that I'd never experienced and that perhaps the combination of 
that with singing would make an interesting performing vehicle. So I started 
training with a mine artist called Lindsay Kemp, who was a very big inspiration 
for me, and then started dancing at a school. And since then, though the videos 
the dance has been an incredibly useful thing for me. 
</p>

<p>[A portion of Wuthering Heights is played] 
</p>

<p>K: As I've gradually gone through the business I've become much more involved in 
other areas. And I've found that when I worked in the studio, there we all these 
areas that were connected to the song that were changing it in a way perhaps 
that I hadn't intended when I was initially writing the song. And I felt that a 
natural progression for me was to get involved in production, so that then I could 
take much more control over the whole thing and therefore end up with a result 
that I felt was my expression, rather than an indirect expression through lots of 
other people. And again that was a gradual thing, where I went into 
co-production, and finding that to be pleasing and quite successful, went into 
producing solely. 
</p>

<p>I: Since then you've built a studio in your home, can you tell me about that? 
</p>

<p>K: That's right, again that was another sort of realization on the last album. That as I 
producing and getting closer to the whole thing, I found that the way I'm 
working now is so experimental, it takes me a lot of time, I like to play around 
with ideas. And in a commercial studio it's costing so much money every hour 
that I found that was becoming anti-productive, I was so nervous, because I 
shouldn't be taking so much time playing around with things, that it was stopping 
me trying things. And we felt the only way really to cope with this was to have 
our own studio and then also I'd be able to write in the studio and just do as 
much as I could there and make it all part of the same environment. 
</p>

<p>[The Man With The Child In His Eyes is played] 
</p>

<p>K: During the gap between the last and this album, I'd seen quite a few videos on 
television, that other people had been doing. And I felt that dance, something that 
we'd be working in, particulary in the earlier videos in quite a foreway, was 
being used quite trivially, it was being exploited: haphazard images, busy, lots of 
dances, without really the serious expression, and wonderful expression, that 
dance can give. So we felt how interesting it would be to make a very simple 
routine between two people, almost classic, and very simply filmed. So that's 
what we tried, really, to do a serious piece of dance. [Laughs] 
</p>

<p>[Part of Running Up That Hill is played]

<p>K: I think until this album I've always treated them as individual songs, and you just 
work on one at a time, trying to do the best you can to get the best atmosphere 
across. But with this album I really wanted to try a conceptual piece, something 
I'd wanted to do for a while but hadn't really gone for. And I felt rather than 
making a whole of it, it would be interesting to have a side that was conceptual, 
and then make the other side a kind of counter-balance. And it was a lot of fun 
working like that, I'm so used to working on a piece of music that's no more 
than five minutes long. And although these are individual songs, they're all 
linked and they all have the same theme and atmosphere, so you're definitely 
working within one entity. And it was very challenging. 
</p>

<p>I: Buy you decided not to do the whole album as a concept. 
</p>

<p>K: Yes, I think there were a couple of reasons for that. One, I'd felt that half an 
hour was a good length of time to get involved in a story. And I was worried that 
I wouldn't be able to make something sustain over a whole album and that I 
stood a better chance of doing that with one side of it. And also, I wasn't sure if 
was even going to work until I'd written a few of the songs. So it made sense for 
me to secure myself by witting a couple of other songs for the other side while I 
was working on that side. [Laughs] 
</p>

<p>I: What do you think you'll do next? 
</p>

<p>K: I don't know, it's a very strange point in time for me here, where I'm in the 
middle of promoting the album. And we'll be making videos for the next singles 
next year. And sometime during this period I have to decide what I'm going to 
do next. There are a few things that attract me equally. Going straight into 
another album is something that I have a lot of enthusiasm about. And perhaps 
turning the conceptual side of this album into a film, in an idea I'm toying with. 
So, I'm not sure, we'll have to see what I'm feeling like at the beginning of next 
year.

<p>K: Hounds of Love is about someone who's scarred of falling in love with someone, 
of being trapped, and sees it as a simile of a pack of hounds that are chasing 
them. And instead of being happy about it, terrified, so they're running for their 
life really. [Laughs] 
</p>

<p>I: Is that something - is that personal for you or... is that something you've observed 
about other people ? 
</p>

<p>K: I think that everyone is scarred of relationship on some level or other, but actually 
the song in many ways was inspired by an old english black and white movie 
called Night Of The Demon, which is just one of those great movies that managed 
to get through a whole phase of other movies that were incredibly corny and not 
effective, and has a real atmosphere about it. 
</p>

<p>I: Do you have a favorite album of yours, a Kate Bush album? 
</p>

<p>K: It's a very close tie between this and the last one. I think probably this one. The 
one that you've just done is normally your most favorite and then becomes your 
least favorite and you want to get on and do something else and make it better. 
[Laughs] 
</p>

<p>I: What do you know about Canada? 
</p>

<p>K: I know very little about it. I wish that I had more time here to actually go and see 
the country because it's one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I've 
only seen it on film, but it's beautiful. 
</p>



<p>[Other quotes from the same interview, shown at a later date. Starts with the 
Hounds of Love quote above] 
</p>

<p>K: Well touring is one of those things that could easily be the next project. I think 
what's put me off committing myself to it is the amount of involvement - it 
enormous. I mean it's financially costly, very tiring, and a tremendous amount of 
effort goes into it. But it's so rewarding. And we only did the one tour in '79, 
around England and Europe. And I had to wait until I had another two albums 
worth of material to be able to tour again, which only took me to the end of the 
last album. And since then, I haven't really been prepared for that kind of 
commitment. 
</p>

<p>I: Well, what would a tour involve, what would a concert - a Kate Bush concert - 
involve? Would there be dancing...? 
</p>

<p>K: Yes. Well this is how we approached it the last time. Very much inspired by the 
initial influences of people like Lindsay Kemp and the dance that I'd taken up. I 
felt that it was a really interesting combination to use music, theatre, poetry, in 
live form. And although all the songs we'd worked were off the albums, we had 
lots links and different extensions to the music and that. And so it really does 
become a very involved process. And I think the last three albums, which if we 
did a tour would be what we'd cover, actually lend themselves better towards 
being visualized theatrically, but I just don't know if we'll every get 'round to 
doing it. [Laughs]
