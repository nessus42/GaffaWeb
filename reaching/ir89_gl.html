<BR> Subject: Greater London Radio, by Janice Long October 1989 
</P>
<P>Interview with Kate Bush conducted by Janice Long <BR> for Greater London
Radio, October 1989 
</P>
<P>[On the twelfth and thirteenth of October, 1989, Janice Long broadcast her 
two-part interview with Kate Bush during her morning shows on Greater London 
Radio. The interview had been conducted at Kate's own studio in Welling, in a
very  relaxed atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>[IED has not heard this interview himself. He only has a transcript which 
appeared in the thirteenth issue of Cariad Kate (actually now known as Never 
Forever? ), the Welsh Kate Bush fanzine. Unfortunately, this means that IED can 
only present the EDITED version which was published in that fanzine. To quote
the  transcriber: &quot;Owing to the length of the interview and in order to
allow the text to  flow easier &lt;sic&gt;, a few edits have been made.&quot;
IED does not take responsibility for  the inevitable distortions (see for
example Kate's obviously post-edited answer to the  first question) which
resulted from ill-considered editing of The Word of  God...Edited by Andrew
Marvick, from an original transcription by Robert Brown  of Colchester, Essex.]

</P>
<P>Why is there such long gaps &lt;sic&gt; between albums being released? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think the problem is, too, that there seems to be a longer gap
between each  album progressively--which is a bit frightening for me, too. All I
can say is that after  each album is finished and the promotion is done, I can't
just start an album straight  away, because otherwise it's just a continuation
of that last album. And the whole  thing about writing an album is that you want
to find something new to say, and at  the same time, try to find out who you are
at that point in time. You know, what you  want to do. What direction you want
to move in. So it's very much a  self-exploratory process as well.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now, the thing is, people wait with bated breath for the next Kate Bush
album,  and they get very excited about it. How do you feel about it? How do you
feel about  that--knowing that people are still excited about you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that's quite hard for me to take in, really. I just feel so
lucky that I can  spend as much time as I need to to make an album, and that
people are actually still  waiting to hear what I do. It's very exciting for me,
and I think sometimes it feels  like a big responsibility. It is really
important that I put as much as I can into each  album, so that it is,
hopefully, worth waiting for. It's not something I'm terribly  aware of. It's
almost too much for me to think about, really--that there are people  who want
to hear it after such a long time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So what happens? Do EMI breathe down your neck and say, 'Come on, Kate, the 
punters are waiting!' Or do you wind down after one album and then just get into
it  gradually yourself? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think the record company know me well enough by now to know
that  really they just have to leave me to it. I'd really like to be able to
make an album  quicker. I dream of making an album in eight weeks, but if I did,
it would be  something that I wouldn't be happy with. Unfortunately, it's just a
very slow  process for me, and I think they realize this. And they know there's
not really  much they can do about it, because I couldn't possibly give them an
album until it  was written and finished.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What sort of influences do you have when you're making an album?
Particularly  other music? 
</P>
<P>&quot;My normal way of working is not to listen to other music when I'm
making  albums. I tend to listen to music after I've finished. A good example of
that is after I  finished the Hounds of Love album. My brother Paddy played me a
tape of The Trio  Bulgarka, and I'd never heard anything like it. &lt;This is a
slight distortion of the facts.  Paddy had in fact been an enthusiast of
Bulgarian vocal folkmusic since the late  1960s, when he discovered the genre
through an album by the Pennywhistlers. Since  Kate was heavily influenced by
her brothers' musical tastes at that period, it is  unlikely that she didn't get
at least some preliminary exposure to Bulgarian music at  an early age--IED&gt;
I was devastated, like everyone is when they hear it. And by  hearing it then,
it gave me a lot of time to listen to them and gradually think that  maybe we
could work together. Bearing them in mind, I actually wrote a track, and  then
it eventually evolved into the process of working together. But it was probably 
three years before I actually got around to doing something about it. It just
shows  you how slow the whole evolving process is.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You don't follow trends at all, do you? &lt;For those thinking that the
Bulgarian  music influence was a trendy one, remember that Kate's involvement
with the Trio  Bulgarka actually pre-dated the first re-release of Marcel
Cellier's recording of Le  Mystere on 4AD by several months. Neither she nor
Paddy could have had any idea  that Bulgarian vocal music would become chic in
the West.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think again, Janice, that it's just as well I don't, because if I
did, by the time  the album was out it would be three years out of date! I don't
stand much chance of  being hip--unless it comes right round again, that is.&quot;

</P>
<P>To many, you're something of an enigma. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know about enigmas or anything. I just take a long time to
make an  album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But we never ever read about Kate Bush, you know, hitching up her skirt and 
dancing around at the Hippodrome, or--
</P>
<P> (In feigned indignation:) &quot;I should think not!&quot; 
</P>
<P>--or Kate Bush being seen at the airport, darting off here and there. You
manage  to keep a low profile, don't you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I guess so. I think that it is very important to me that I get
that break again,  between albums. I need a lot of privacy, and just to be at
home. It's such a different  world out there, and it's not really something I've
ever wanted to be a part of.  Making records and just being involved in music is
really what attracted me to what  I do. And it's not really me to go to all
these clubs. It's not really the kind of thing I  like to do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When you actually set about doing an album, are you terribly intense about
the  whole thing and spend all your waking hours writing tracks? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Probably not when I first start the album. That's probably a
relatively relaxed  process. But then once I've got into that process a bit, it
all starts where you think,  'God! This is rubbish!' From that point onwards
you're beginning, and it does  become very intense. I do really have a very
obsessive attitude about my  albums--where once I'm in there, I don't do
anything else. I can't do my other  projects because it all feels like it's
distracting me. And because I know it's going to  take me such a long time, I
feel I have to keep this intensity going, or I might never  ever finish it.&quot;

</P>
<P>Do you let other people come in and listen? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. It's very important to let others hear it. But more and more it
becomes a  problem, because the way I'm working in the studio. Quite often the
song will  sound like it's in pieces until it's in a quite developed stage. The
other problem is, if  you know you want to change lots of things in the tracks,
the chances are that if you  let people hear it in an early stage, they will
latch onto the whole structure of the  song and they can't allow for any
differences later. In some ways the most useful  ones are at a much later stage
where the songs are almost finished and they're  easier for people to hear. Then
you can hear how people react.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you always write in the studio? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I do now. I play around with ideas at home, but most of the
writing goes on  in here, and that's important, too. Because years ago I'd make
demos, and there  would be things that I wanted to keep, but of course you
can't, because it's a demo.  It's the eternal problem. By having your own
studio, you can get around that. You  can actually make the demos the master,
and keep all those little bits that are  interesting, but then make the rest
sound much better. I work very closely with Del  (Palmer), who engineers for me.
So most of the time it's just the two of us in there.  He works a lot on the
rhythms and things, so at least I'm not totally alone in there.  Once the song
feels good enough to work on, then you bring musicians in and just  sort of
layer upon layer. You sort of create the picture, as it were, and just build up 
the sounds that seem to work for what the song is saying. It feels as though
songs  have personalities. You can try something on a song and it will just
reject it. It  doesn't want it. And yet you can tray that on another song and it
will work so  perfectly. They're all so individual.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What about the tense atmosphere when the album is in its final preparation 
stage? Do tempers begin to flare? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I think healthy argument is a very important part of the process,
really.  Creative or otherwise. Because it can be very constructive. The problem
is actually  having a strong enough direction, knowing what you want to do.&quot;

</P>
<P>How important is it to you that te person listening to your record
understands  what's going through your mind? Or do you mind if they have their
own  interpretations? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's wonderful if they have their own interpretations. I think
that's  really important, although it matters to me that the lyrics are saying
something, and I  spend a lot of time on lyrics. They're very difficult. I think
a lot of the power of  lyrics is the sounds. The whole thing is just a
combination of sounds and textures,  and definitely different words have a
different feeling that go with them. The way  consonants mark things. It's a
very percussive instrument, in a way, words. And I  think that's what's very
important, that they feel and sound right.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You always come up with something very distinctive to the way you look, and
also  video-wise, as well. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think that's jolly nice of you to say!&quot; 
</P>
<P>I'm just being a creep. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I like you being a creep, Janice!&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's not as if you just release a record, and then there's no sort of strong
thing to  go with it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know, really. I think it's really nice that you should say
that, because I  think things like artwork--everything that accompanies the
records: videos...Again,  it's, hopefully, trying to stay within some kind of
standard of what you want to say  on the album. And I think it's increasingly
difficult to do something interesting in  music, and in videos, too. They have
become so cliche-ed. I think a lot of people  would like not to make videos. But
it's a pressure that you can't argue with,  because everyone does make a video,
and until everyone stops making videos, you  actually lose out by not doing so,
because it's such a good way of getting people to  hear the tracks. Television
is a very big vehicle for music, and you get people to hear  your music that
way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How instrumental are you when it comes to making a video? Do you have quite 
strong ideas about how your videos are to be seen? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I do, but I think it's because I really love the whole process of
film. I just  find it fascinating. Every time I make a video, it gives me an
opportunity to learn  about it. Like having your own studio. The amount I've
learnt about that process is  tenfold. And with videos, because I got involved
and the people I worked with  earlier on really encouraged me, I have learnt a
lot about the process over the years,  really.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Having listened to the tracks quite a few times now, it's clear that there
are no  strong political meassages in the music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think you can cover political isues with the emotion, and for
me, that's  what I deal with, really. How things effect people. It's the
emotional angle that I  tend to take, rather than a political one. &quot;Army
Dreamers&quot; is really sort of about a  mother losing her son. You write
something because you've been moved by it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Can one single thing inspire you to write a song? A personal thing? I'm not 
talking about wars now, or international things, world things. But if something 
brilliant happens, can that have you darting off into the studio? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I think sometimes it is the littlest things that spark off some
of the biggest  ideas. It's the little things in life that matter. You know, the
old cliche. But there's a  lot in that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But you belong to a business where it's not really the little things that
matter.  The music business is notorious for being selfish, and everybody
looking after  themself. Isn't it difficult to maintain that? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't really think that I am part of that, really, because I spend
so much time  just working on albums, being at home. Working in the studio. It's
a very small part  of my life, really, that. And I do have to conscientiously
make an effort to keep it at a  distance sometimes. But I'm very lucky that I've
been able to get the priorities  right, because there's always such a lot of
pressure to do things when you don't  want to do them. It's really up to you to
try and be strong.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Were you strong when you first signed to EMI? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think in some ways I was at my strongest, because I was completely
charged  with the desire to be doing an album for the first time. All I wanted
to do was to  make a record. I never really got beyond that on any level.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So it was making the music and having the music heard. Was it necessarily
fame  that you wanted? And loads of money? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. I think it was very much making an album. I just wanted to have
ten, eleven  songs that were good enough to go onto an album, because that's
what meant a lot  to me. Writing songs. Trying to get that little collection
together, and get it out to the  world.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you become a total recluse in the recording studio, or do you find time
to  relax and slow down? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I do get very obsessed with it all, and people make quite a fuss,
really, which is  truly nice. But it is just an album. There are lots of other
things in life besides  working. So many people get wrapped up in their work on
so many levels of life,  because there is such a lot of pressure for people to
follow this high achiever.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, it's the protestant work ethic, and also doing the best. &lt;Huh?--IED&gt;
Being  the best? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. And I'm very, very lucky. I continually think I'm so lucky to do
what I like  doing, and to have the time to do what I want. But it is still
important to have a good  time. That's what it's all about, don't you think?
You've got to have a good time,  really.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What are your priorities, then? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think years ago, really, I wouldn't have looked beyond haing a
damn  good album. And now, it's nice for me to have space away from it. I like
not being  quit so obsessed as I used to be. There's a bit more time to play
with. Maybe I'm a  bit more sociable because I'm not so obsessive. It does get
terribly unhealthy, and  it's very selfish, as well--making an album, writing a
book...Any of those things.  Ultimately it is a very selfish act, so you should
be more healthy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What do you do, though? Do you watch lots of telly, or do you go to the
theatre? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I love watching telly, because when we spend a lot of time in the
day  listening to music, you don't want to get home and listen to records. I
love watching  comedy. I really love gardening. I did quite a bit of gardening
over the last couple of  years, which was really good for me. It's so nice to
get outside, too. You get stuck  inside all day, so at least I've been getting
out a bit more, and not being so obsessive.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What sort of comedy are you into? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I love all the Comic Strip stuff. Ben Elton's writing is superb.
I think all  those people are just so inspiring. It's exciting! There should be
something like that  happening in the music business, too. There should be a
real centre of inspired,  talented people, putting out stuff that makes you
think, that re-educates people. I  think they have done a lot for women with
their comedy. They can be women  without being used as some sex object, or
something to be made fun of. Women are  actually women in their comedy, and I
admire that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I think it's all right for women to be a sex object, if that's what they
want to be. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Absolutely. Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you a feminist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yuck! God, I hate that word. It's like calling someone a Sadist! I
think it's really  unfortunate that that word has been so associated with very
extreme...extremist  persons. Radical behavior. And I think although it probably
had to be put in a bit at  the beginning, I think all women are rather offended
by that term now. What really  has power is when you get people like Jennifer
Saunders and Dawn French up there  doing something really good, as women, being
people, just being women. Women  just getting on with it and doing it, and doing
it well. Which I think a lot of women  are doing now. And there's not such an
alienating process going on between men  and women.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you do a lot of travelling? A lot of the tracks seem to have an Eastern 
influence? 
</P>
<P>&quot;A lot of people have said this. I think a lot of the drum rhythms have
a  suggestion of the East. But really most of the influences are obviously 
Bulgarian--which I guess has an Eastern flavor, really, doesn't it? And in some
ways  we've used the Irish musicians in a slightly more Eastern way this time.
They don't  necessarily sound out-and-out Irish, so I guess all this coming
together makes it  sound Eastern&quot; 
</P>
<P>I read somewhere before that you were into Irish music. Is it traditional
stuff, or  what? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it is that. I just love Irish music. It's so emotional, and
passionate. It's very,  very happy, and it can be very, very sad. It just does
something to me. I guess it's  because it's in my blood, as well. My mother's
Irish, and as soon as I hear the pipes,  you know, I feel my blood surging
through my veins. And I think the Bulgarian  music has...it moves you. The sense
of melody and everything. It feels like very old  music, stuff we're not in
touch with any more. Probably when music was music, and  men were men
(laughing), and the women were very lonely!&quot; 
</P>
<P>About &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;: On the way here, the driver kept
leaping  because he though his VodaPhone was going. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's very interesting that you should say that because so many people
have. If  they'd have that track on, people would be talking away and then they
hear the  computer sound, they're completely distracted. And I think it
reinforces in a way  what the whole song is about, which is rather nice. It's
almost like people respond  more to a machine talking to them than to a human.
It's like we're all keyed into  mechanical information.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you like all of that? Having a studio? Do you get excited about new
gadgetry? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I suppose it always wears off a bit...It's just fantastic. I
really can't believe  that we got such a good studio that I can work in and make
records in. Because I  couldn't do it in a commercial studio now. I think it
would be impossible for me, and  I'd get so nervous--I'd feel completely out of
my depth. I've got so used to having  the privacy, and I can just pop in and
have a cup of tea.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There is a possibility that you might tour? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ooooh!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Go on Kate, go on, do it! 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I do decide to tour, you definitely will (rest of answer lost in
laughter)...&quot; 
</P>
<P>And other than that, now that the album is completed, what are you going to
do?  Just sort of wind down? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, definitely my philosophy is to take things step by step. And
having finished  the album, which I'm so relieved about, I'm kind of going
through the promotional  work. And I guess a lot depends on how the album is
received. If it's received really  warmly, then maybe (long pause)...Well, maybe
I'll be absolutely thrilled. I should  be so lucky!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, you've done it again, girl. Thank you very, very much indeed, Kate
Bush. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's really been nice speaking to you...&quot; 
</P>
<P>And you. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>&quot;...And keep being creepy!&quot;
