<BR> Subject: BBC 1 Nov. 1994 
</P>
<P>I heard an interview on BBC Radio 1 a week or two ago, where Kate was asked
if  she was ever going to tour again. She said: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I would like to. I think lots of people think I didn't enjoy the tour
because I  haven't done one since. But actually I really did. But I suppose I
just got so wrapped  up in studio work, and the more I don't tour, the more I
become nervous of it. But I  would very much like to do some shows sometime. 
</P>
<P>I did enjoy making the film (TLTC&amp;TC) very much and I really learnt a
lot, and  all the people I worked with were fantastic. It was a great
experience. But in a way  I've got that out of my system for now, and to make
another film I think I'd have to  put a lot of work in which, in some ways that
film was a little too rushed. And I  guess, you know, if I do get a chance to
move away from records again, it would be  nice to try and do some shows.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If anyone's *really* interested, I've got a transcript of the entire
interview  (about 150 lines) including Kates attempt at a joke about dolphins. I
also have it on  tape, of course.
