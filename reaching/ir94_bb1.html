<P>From: pptjc@vaxk.bton.ac.uk (It's in the trees... It's coming...) <BR>
Date: Sat, 30 Apr 1994 21:57:41 GMT <BR> Subject: Kate Bush interview on BBC 1,
April 1994
</P>
<P>And now, faster than a very fast thing, comes a transcription of the
interview  with Kate from &quot;Good Morning With Anne And Nick&quot; broadcast
in the UK on  BBC 1 on Friday 29/04/94... 
</P>
<P>Presented by Tania Bryer (&quot;Good Morning&quot; Showbiz Expert). 
</P>
<P>Nick: Let's talk Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>Tania: I knew you wanted to talk Kate Bush... Your a big fan.. So are a lot
of people.  We don't see enough of Kate Bush, she hasn't toured for ages but
anyway she  had an album out last year (The Red Shoes) and now she's written,
she's starring  in and directing a film based on six tracks from 'Red Shoes' and
this is her  debut directing and acting [no it isn't - Peter] and is about a 40
minute film - we  went to a special preview; let's have a look at Kate. 
</P>

The Curve'] 
</P>
<P>Tania: It's 16 years since Kate Bush's first ever single, 'Wuthering
Heights' went to  No. 1. Her theatrical image has so far been confined to a few
stage shows and her  excellent videos but now she has directed a movie, 'The
Line, The Cross, And  The Curve'... 
</P>
<P>Kate: I suppose really when the album was finished I was aware that I was
going to  have to make some videos for singles that would be released and that
to make a  film that was... maybe half an hour/ 40 minutes long would be a way
of making a  more complete statement. 
</P>
<P>Tania: Kate's problem was that the album had no common theme so what *would*
 be the film's story? Then she realized; The shoes *were* the story. Despite 
having written lyrics for over 20 hits, Kate found writing the script very
difficult. 
</P>
<P>Kate: I have a very great curiosity for words; I think there *is* a word for
 everything. It's a great gift to be very eloquent but the only dialogue that
I've  ever been involved in is in this film. 
</P>
<P>[clip from Miranda's entrance in 'The Line, The Cross, And The Curve'] 
</P>
<P>Tania: Kate was delighted when award-winning actress, Mirranda Richardson, 
agreed to play the lead role in the film. 
</P>
<P>Kate: There are area where there sould have been more dialogue; I would have
liked  that but we just didn't have the time to develop the story any more but
really one  of the scenes that I think I'm the most proud of int the film is
Mirranda's  entrance into the room and the dialogue that in a way sets up the
whole story. 
</P>
<P>[clips from sequence for 'Moments Of Pleasure' and 'Eat The Music' from 'The
 Line, The Cross, And The Curve'] 
</P>
<P>Tania: Kate's first 40 minute short is an impressive debut as director but
if her  movie-making career takes off, her fans are likely to see *less* of her
rather  than more. 
</P>
<P>Kate: In this particular film I took on the role as the singer and I think
in some ways  by doing that I took on a bit too much. If I was to make a film, I
wouldn't want  to be in it so much, just maybe a tiny bit. 
</P>
<P>End.
