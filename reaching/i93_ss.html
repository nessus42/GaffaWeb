Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: Sound on Sound
`Del Palmer: The Red Shoes Sessions' Dec. 1993 
</P>
<P>Uli e-mailed me his master list of all articles and interviews that have so
far been  posted in connection with the release of The Red Shoes, and sure
enough, as I  suspected, this one was not picked up on at the time. It is a
highly informative article  based on an interview with Del Palmer. Much of the
information is now familiar, but  there are a wealth of details that are new. I
would very much look forward to seeing  Jon Drukman's comments on some of what
Del reports. 
</P>
<P>I'd like to thank Alexis Armstrong, eldest son of my host for the recent
visit to  London for the Konvention, for unearthing the magazine from his
library, and  loaning it to me to transcribe for the newsgroup. Alexis is a
skilled instrumentalist  and resourceful electronic music composer; it was a
pleasure to meet him, and I  thank him for his thoughtfulness.

<H2>Del Palmer </H2>
<H2>THE RED SHOES SESSIONS </H2>
<P>[Sidebar] There's been a lot of publicity about Kate Bush's new album, The
Red  Shoes ; RICHARD BUSKIN goes behind the scenes with engineer/producer Del 
Palmer to discover exactly how the album was recorded, and how pop's most 
enigmatic lady really works. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's private studio was initially set up to record demos for
Lionheart ; Del  Palmer was the only band member interested in operating the
tape machine! Fifteen  years on, Del is Kate's main man with the faders, and
what was once a demo studio  has evolved into a sophisticated private recording
facility. 
</P>
<P>Located in barns adjacent to the Bush country home, today's studio is
equipped  with a 48-channel SSL 4000E console with G-series computer, two Sony
3324A digital  machines, a Studer A80 half-inch, and a couple of U-Matic video
recorders. 
</P>
<P>Del takes up the story: &quot;During early 1990, Kate said `I want to do
something, I  want to go in the studio and work.' During the early stages I can
set up a sound for  her, set up some keyboards, show what to do on the console,
and leave her to it.  She'll work for days until she's got something, then we'll
get the musicians in and  carry on from there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As both producer and artist, Kate Bush is extremely focused and knows
exactly  what she wants. So when Del comes up with a particular sound, she
wastes no time  in telling him whether or not it's what she's looking for. 
</P>
<P> &quot;There have been lots of times when I've had quite heated arguments
with  her--I'd say something wouldn't work, to which her response has been,
`Indulge  me...Just do it.' For example, on the Hounds of Love album there's a
part that goes  `Help me, baby, help me, baby,' which cuts in and out very
quickly, which she  wanted to do by turning the tape over and cutting in and out
with the records  switch. I said it would just be a mess, but she said, `Look,
just do it, will you?' So I  did it and of course it worked, and I had to eat
humble pie. I've eaten so much  humble pie over the years that I'm putting on
weight!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate is apparently not averse to placing her own fingers on the faders,
especially  in relation to the vocals as well as much of the instrumentation. &quot;I
was able to just  set her up with a sound, and she'd take care of it herself,&quot;
explains Palmer. &quot;She'd  record all the vocals, then phone me up and say,
`Let's put it all together'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>These days, Kate Bush tends to write about 90% of her material as part of
the  overall recording process in the studio, largely because of the difficulty
of trying to  recreate the spontaneity and the feel of the demos. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We just couldn't do it,&quot; says Palmer, &quot;so we decided to use
the demos as the  basis for the albums. We started off by taking the demos,
transferring them, then  working on top--then it struck us that we should just
do away with that whole  process, develop the home studio and record absolutely
everything right onto the  multitracks and keep everything that was done. Now, a
lot of the stuff that we start  with doesn't make it right through to the end,
but at least the flavour of it does. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's no fixed method to how Kate works, but generally speaking she
will  say, `Can you get me a drum pattern that sounds like this?' She'll sing me
 something and I'll program the Fairlight with a simple eight-bar loop, never
any  more than that, and then she'll program a sound in the Fairlight and get a
tune  going. Then she'll say, `I've got something, can I put a vocal down?'
Something that  may only amount to `la-la-la-ing`, but almost every time
there'll be a specific little  bit of lyric that will give her an idea, which in
turn becomes the basis for the song.  So we put it down, and that becomes the
basic demo that we're going to work with;  an eight-bar drum pattern, a keyboard
and a very rough guide vocal. From that she  can tell whether it's worth
pursuing an idea or not. Some get discarded at this point,  while others
progress a little bit further before it becomes obvious that they too are  not
going to work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Until the Red Shoes project, it was traditional to bring in the musicians
one at a  time to record their parts. Firstly--and, from Kate Bush's point of
view, most  importantly--the drummer, followed by the bass player (often Del
Palmer himself);  this would then allow her to review how each song was
progressing and to make any  necessary alterations prior to the guitarists and
other musicians entering the fray.  This time around, however, it was decided
from the outset to record quickly and to  aim for more of a band feel, so most
of the tracks were recorded with a least bass,  drums and, in several cases,
keyboards being played together. 
</P>
<P>Palmer, wishing to concentrate on his role as engineer, didn't play the bass
 guitar; the same bass player and drummer worked over the course of ten separate
 days to fuel the group atmosphere, though guide guitars weren't deemed
necessary.  However, `Rubberband Girl' does feature a keyboard pattern performed
by Kate  with an acoustic guitar sample. 
</P>
<P>&quot;On the track `Big Stripey Lie', Kate played electric guitar as well,&quot;
points out  Palmer. &quot;She said to the guitarist we were using, `I'm really
into the guitar. I'd  really like to be able to play it,' and he said, `Oh,
here, play this one (a Fender  Stratocaster) for a bit.' So, he showed her a few
chords, and--this is no kidding--a  week later she was in front of this Marshall
stack in the studio giving it her all! I've  never seen anything like it. She's
a natural--she was playing lead guitar and no one  would know it wasn't an
experienced guitarist.&quot; 
</P>
<P>THAT VOCAL SOUND 
</P>
<P>The trademark Kate Bush sound that has been developed over the course of the
 last four albums owes a lot not only to the pulsating, highly atmospheric,
slightly  discordant noises that seem to emanate from every direction, but also
her own  unique vocal style, with its breathy delivery and haunting presence. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I can't take any credit for Kate's vocal sound,&quot; admits Palmer, &quot;because
it was  originally shown to me by an engineer called Paul Arden who taught me so
much.  He would explain anything that I asked him about. One day he couldn't
make a  session, so he said, `Why don't you do it?' So I did, and he showed me
how to get  the sound which they had started using on The Dreaming. Kate loved
it, and ever  since then we've been using it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Basically, it's all down to an overdose of compression, and the fact
that she really  knows how to work with it. We set her up with a [Neumann] U47
in the live part of  the studio--brick floor and stone walls--so it's very, very
live--and then there's  loads and loads of compression on the mic. The SSL
desk's compression is very  violent and works very well for this. So, what's
happening is that every time she  breathes in, you can hear it, so she has to be
very specific in the way that she deals  with this. She's backing off from the
microphone all the time, really working it. We  use a small amount of gating so
you'll get the sound of the room and then it cuts  off--a bit like the Phil
Collins drum sound. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If Kate's singing really loud she backs off from the mike and then she
comes  right in close for the quiet stuff, but when she breathes in, she does
this to the side. I  have to say that from a purely technical standpoint, it's
really badly done, there's  just so much compression on everything. But I'm not
interested in being technical, I  just want it to sound good, and if it does,
then what's the point of changing it? 
</P>
<P>&quot;When it comes to the mix you don't have to push the vocal up as high
as you  might imagine, because with that sound you're getting so much high
frequency. It's  real borderline stuff. Sometimes you can go too far, and it'll
break up or distort, or  it'll really blow your ears off, but if you get it just
right, you're getting so much high  frequency that you can just push the voice
right down and it will still cut through  everything.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On average, Kate performs four or five vocal passes for each part, and while
 compiling does take place, there is normally a clear contender for the master
take.  This is invariably deduced by way of Kate's own vocal chart, on which she
makes  notes while listening to the various takes. &quot;Usually, Kate will
record a complete  section of her vocal and it'll work, then I'll just have to
patch up a few bits.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When dealing with problems, Palmer tends to steer clear of the old cliche,
`we'll  sort it out in the mix.' For one thing, as Palmer is quick to point out,
you have to be  very sure that you *can* sort it out in the mix, so and Kate try
to get things right as  they put them down on tape. When it came to mixing the
album, it was simply a  matter of pacing, creating space and giving everything
its moment. There were,  however, a few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>GUESTS OF DISTINCTION 
</P>
<P>With the exception of her piano (recorded with two 87s inside the lid and 
Massenburg Parametric EQ), Fender Rhodes and Yamaha DX7, all of Kate's  keyboard
sounds were produced using a Fairlight. The other musicians were  provided with
only limited room for experimentation, as she was characteristically  specific
in her directives, while also keeping an open mind and ear to any new ideas  or
sounds that might come her way. For this reason, Palmer has become accustomed 
to recording absolutely everything that goes on during the sessions. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even when the musicians are just setting up I record everything,&quot;
he confirms.  &quot;Because she'll say, `Oh, do you remember that thing you did
when you were  warming up?', and of course if you haven't got it on tape you've
lost it. So,  whenever there's anybody in, I always have the half-inch running,
then I can spin  anything back in later.&quot; 
</P>
<P>All in all, a pretty wise approach; whereas some of the musicians within the
 `band unit' returned time and again, others simply contributed guest
appearances  and it would have been altogether more difficult--not to mention
embarrassing--to  have these people return to redo what they had already done. 
</P>
<P>Violinist Nigel Kennedy, featured on `Big Stripey Lie' and `Top of the
City', was  recorded in the deader of the two main live areas, standing on
carpet. &quot;The thing  with Nigel is that he never stands still,&quot; says
Palmer. &quot;So, after talking to him, it  seemed that the best way to work was
to use a pair of 87s. They're so versatile, I  use them for everything. One was
about eight feet from the ground, pointing down  over his (left) shoulder toward
the violin, and the other was diagonally to his right  and about three feet from
the ground, pointing up toward his chest. Out of the two I  think I used the
overhead one the most, but it was just a juxtapositional thing to see  how
different the room would sound. Because the room's so small you could put a 
microphone anywhere and it would pick him up. I used the Massenburg EQ--you 
have to watch the mid-high frequencies--our rooms are so live and so specific
that  you can get a tone that'll go right through your ears.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Jeff Beck played his signature Stratocaster for `You're The One' in the
control  room with a tiny amp positioned underneath the front of the console and
miked  with a U87 positioned three inches away to the side and pointing in. &quot;I
was sitting at  the console, Kate was to my right and Jeff was seated about four
feet behind,&quot;  explains Palmer, &quot;so she could talk to him and was able
to both operate the deck and  stand up to adjust the rack.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Eric Clapton played his Eric Clapton signature Strat using a very similar
setup for  `And So Is Love', albeit with his amp in the studio area. &quot;What
happens with people  like Eric is that his guitar roadie turns up with a lorry
full of gear and just piles it  into your studio,&quot; exclaims Palmer. &quot;Then,
when he turns up, you say, `Well, actually  what we want, Eric, is that
classical sound of yours,' and so he says, `Oh yeah,' and  he gets out a small
combo and puts that up!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Gary Brooker (of Procul Harem fame) played Hammond C3 in the main room, 
miked with a U87 on the Leslie cabinet, and another one about ten feet away to 
capture some ambience. Again, Massenburg EQ and hard compression were used to 
create a rich Hammond sound with sufficient cut at a relatively low volume. 
</P>
<P>As the Bush studio does have a very specific room sound--small and harsh, as
 characterised by the vocals--it was decided that a more expansive sound might
be  obtained for the vocal performances of the Trio Bulgarka by recording them
in  Abbey Road's Studio 2. They stood around a crossed stereo pair of U87s;
Abbey  Road's Studio 1 was also used for the string sessions for `Moments of
Pleasure',  arranged by Michael Kamen. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The only other stuff we did at Abbey Road was technical, like moving
analogue  material onto digital,&quot; says Del Palmer. &quot;We started the
album 48-track analogue,  using two A80s, and about a year into the project we
became aware that it would be  better for us to go digital... We weren't really
sure whether it was going to work or  not--we were kind of thinking that without
some tape compression we may not get  the same drum sounds--but I was convinced
within an hour of turning the thing on! 
</P>
<P>&quot;With Kate's stuff, where you do have a lot of level changes, there's a
constant  fight between noise levels and signal levels, but with digital you
don't have that. You  can put the quietest thing on tape and you won't get any
background noise. At the  same time, whereas with analogue you may say, `I'm
going to put some 10k in here  because I know I'm going to lose a bit,' with the
digital machines I found that I was  using far less EQ right across the board.&quot;

</P>
<P>As things turned out, since the decision to switch to digital was made
relatively  early during the Red Shoes sessions, much of the analogue material
was later  replaced. Only the performances of the Trio Bulgarka, as well as
Nigel Kennedy  from `Top of the City', remain from the analogue. 
</P>
<P>&quot;With digital, a lot of doors opened us to us which we previously had
no idea  about, and the result was that Kate was off and running,&quot; says
Palmer. &quot;She had so  many good ideas to try out, generally to do with
editing. For example, if there was a  piece of vocal here, rather than sampling
it and flying it back in, we could actually  offset the machine and put it in
various strange places. Sometimes this wouldn't  work, but a lot of the time it
did, such as the track with Prince (`Why Should I Love  You?') on which we had
to offset lots of things, and some of the guitar parts now  appear in the
weirdest places. I'd say, `Wait a minute!' and she'd say, `No, no, it  works,
leave it! Put that down, it works.' 
</P>
<P>&quot;Her overview of everything is alarmingly interesting. I really find it
fascinating  how she can hold all these things in her head at the same time.
She's very au fait  with studio work. I'm sure a lot of people think, `Well, she
gets the producer credit  but I'll bet she doesn't do much,' yet that's really
not true. She knows what she  wants to do and, being technically mind, she knows
how to do it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As to the future, Del Palmer feels that there's a lot of new studio gear on
the  market which he must check out before re-equipping Kate's recording 
environment. &quot;One of the best things I'm now looking into is to make the
studio a  little bit more conducive to her, with everything plumbed in
permanently,&quot; he says.  &quot;So all she'll have to do is push a button and
the Fairlight or whatever will be up and  running. And I'll find her a few more
little goodies to play with...&quot; 
</P>
<P>[SIDEBAR:] SPECIAL EFFECTS 
</P>
<P>&quot;We did leave some of the effects Kate wanted on the voices until the
mix,&quot; says  Palmer. &quot;On `The Red Shoes' track, for instance, where she
goes, `She's gotta  da-ance...', there's this little sound effect, a really high
digital delay off an old  AMS--octave above, octave below--going through a Sony
M7 digital effects unit  [picture inset into text here]. We worked on it a bit
while we were recording the  song, and then we decided to leave it until the mix
so we could set it up on a fader  on its own and just switch it when it comes
in. It's just a matter of setting it up so  that it comes in and out at the
right place, rather than wasting a track or two to  record it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On `Rubberband Girl', a wobbly-sounding effect on the vocal comes from the 
voice being faded down while a stereo image of a digital delay is faded up 
underneath it. &quot;They get to a point where they've overlapped and the effect
is  louder,&quot; explains Palmer, &quot;then that starts being faded out as
well, and the whole  thing disappears into the background and sounds weirder all
the time, while some  Lexicon 224 reverb is added to take it even further away.

</P>
<P>&quot;At other times I used a 480L, a 244, a 244L, a Quantec, a Yamaha Rev
5, a Rev 7  [picture inset], an SPX90, an old Eventide harmoniser, a Dimension
D--loads of  stuff... I always try to keep the Quantec for the vocals because it
has a very cold, icy  kind of sound that works well with that very cold vocal
sound. Otherwise, on the  480, I tend to have a nice warm hall sound for things
like backing vocals and pianos,  and on one of the 244s, I'll have quite a close
room delay. 
</P>
<P>&quot;On the snare drum I was using the Rev 7 with a reverse gating sound,
to give it  just a bit more of a hard snare sound. All of the drums were samples
from an Akai  S900 and they (together with cymbals) were played in real time on
Simmons pads set  up in the main recording area. Our studio is so small that you
get a very specific  sound which we didn't want. Using samples, not only do we
get separation but we  also have a fantastic choice of drums. The Rev 7 made the
snare drum sound a bit  fatter and rounder, and that worked really quite well,
particularly on songs like  `And So Is Love' and `Rubberband Girl'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One of the distinguishing aspects of tracks such as `Rubberband Girl' and
`Big  Stripey Lie' is the pumping five-string bass sound, courtesy of John
Gidman playing  in the recording area &lt;??Disparity Alert&gt;. His G&amp;K amp
was placed in the studio  kitchen (for separation from the drums) and miked with
an Electrovoice RE20. &quot;I  just wound it up so it was really distorted,&quot;
says Palmer, &quot;and used tons and tons of  compression so that is was really
pumping. Then again, the way he plays sounds  really good no matter what you do
to it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[SIDEBAR:] PRINCE--GUESTING LONG DISTANCE 
</P>
<P>Watching Prince at Earls Court, Kate received a note from him expressing his
 admiration for her work. After subsequently contacting him and getting his 
agreement to help out on a track, on analogue tape was sent over to Paisley
Park,  but when it arrived back three months later, there was nothing to be
heard. When  Kate attempted to telephone him, she was told by assistants that he
was working on  it. Then, a month later, a couple of Paisley Park tapes arrived.
Palmer played them. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He'd looped a four-bar section from the chorus of the song that Kate
had  written and just smothered 48 tracks with everything you could possible
imagine:  Guitars, keyboards, drums, voices. I sat there and thought, `Well,
this is great, but  what are we going to do with it?' So, I made a general mix
of the whole thing, gave  if to Kate, and she puzzled over it for months. We
kept going back to it over the  course of a couple of years, and eventually,
with a lot of editing and work on her  part, she turned it back into the song
that it was.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Basically, then, a case of pick `n' mix; &quot;Here it is, take what you
want&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's exactly what it was. Because she'd said to him `I want you to
sing this  bit here and I want you to sing that bit there', and he'd sung it,
but he'd done it  over the loop that he made up. So, we had this piece of vocal
that she wanted but it  was everywhere, all the way through it, so we had to
take the bit that we needed  and put it in where we wanted it--we had to
reconstruct the verses so that they  worked with her lyrics. Then we took out
the original drums and replaced them  because it was now basically a more
up-tempo song. At the same time, we also tried  to turn it back into a Kate Bush
song, and although in a lot of ways it didn't turn out  as we'd hoped--I have to
be honest--it's still very interesting. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There was one vocal section which Prince actually didn't do and Kate
was so  pissed with this. Then, one day she hit on the idea of getting in Lenny
Henry, who's  actually a great singer. It was like he'd worked in studios his
whole life--he had no  trouble doing it. Kate sang him the part she wanted him
to do and then he sang it.  Then she asked him to do a harmony which he worked
out with her. I used a little  bit of compression, just to make the voice sound
a little more throaty.&quot;

<P>&gt; THAT VOCAL SOUND 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;I can't take any credit for Kate's vocal sound,&quot; admits
Palmer, &quot;because it was  originally shown to me by an engineer called Paul
Arden who taught me so much.  He would explain anything that I asked him about.
One day he couldn't make a  session, so he said, `Why don't you do it?' So I
did, and he showed me how to get  the sound which they had started using on The

</P>
<P>This indicates that this interview was taped and transcribed. As far as I
know,  Kate has never worked with an engineer named Paul &quot;Arden&quot; but
*has* worked  with an engineer named Paul Hardiman on Hounds Of Love . 
</P>

<P>Here is another one. Kate hasn't worked with a bass player named John  &quot;Gidman&quot;
but *has* worked with John Giblin (on Breathing .) These may be Peter's 
transcription errors, but as I didn't notice any other spelling errors, I doubt
it. The  errors were probably introduced by the original transcriber of the
interview tape.  So I wouldn't take this as the most accurate of interviews.

technical standpoint, it's really badly done, there's  just so much compression
on everything...&quot;; &quot;I always try to keep the Quantec for  the vocals
because it has a very cold, icy kind of sound that works well with that  very
cold vocal sound...&quot;.  Fiona's words are extremely well chosen: &quot;flat&quot;
is  precisely what you get from tons and tons of compression; and &quot;empty&quot;
is exactly the  effect of cutting away the room ambience. 
</P>
<P>As someone with very little experience with studio experience ('way back in
the  60s, and I bailed out when 16-track came in, because of the way it was
being used  and the microphone techniques that accompanied it), the most amazing
of Del's  remarks was this one--speaking of when they first set up to go
digital: &quot;We weren't  really sure whether it was going to work or not--we
were kind of thinking that  without tape compression we may not get the same
drum sounds...&quot;. Huh?! By &quot;tape  compression&quot; he presumably means
the clipping of transients due to the limited  dynamic range of analogue tape.
There are better and worse ways for this to exhibit  itself--better is simply a
dulling down of the impact or punch aspect of the  percussive `hit'; worse is
audible splattering of the leading edge of the sound. But  surely neither is a
sound one would relish, and not want to part with!? 
</P>
<P>Thing is, I want to stipulate that I found Del Palmer enormously likeable at
the  Convention, and that moreover he is giving Kate Bush the sounds *she* wants
for  her creative palette. It is very significant, I think, that the Beatles' &quot;Magical
Mystery  Tour&quot; was so influential in setting her `ear' for music as
performed recording. I  find that the most artificial, in the sense of
studio-dependent, of all their recordings.  In this area, as in her reluctance
to tour--or even, apparently, to really jam with  other musicians `off the
record'--Kate is doing what she wants.

</P>
<P>I agree completely. Del knows a certain amount about recording, but he's not
 really a great engineer. The bit about learning to compress Kate's vocals from 
&quot;Ardman&quot; (aka Hardiman) is an example. Yes, KB's vocals have always
been heavily  compressed, but *nothing* like the sound Palmer introduced on TSW,
where you  can hear the bloody compressor pumping! This guy needs to turn over
the console to  someone qualified, and get back to playing bass - something he
was really good at.

<P>[Peter Byrne Manchester on &quot;tape compression&quot;] 
</P>
<P>Actually, tape compression can sound pretty good, and many engineers still
prefer  to use analog tape and hit it very hard to get that sound. Roy Thomas
Baker was  particularly famous (or infamous) for this; he slammed the tape
something fierce for  the Queen records he did, and I think they sound splendid.
One result is that you get  a lot of third harmonic distortion which, rather
than dulling the sound, tends to  make it sound brighter and silkier. This is
similar to tube (valve, to you) distortion.  Obviously, there's a limit before
it starts to sound bad, but pushing the needle into  the red is quite acceptable
for analog recording. In digital, it's disasterous. 
</P>
<P>Of course, there are other ways to get that sort of sound when recording
digitally.  A good tube compressor would be one way. I think Del's choice of a &quot;cold&quot;
sounding  compressor is a mistake, especially when printing to digital; a warmer
sound could  still work for what he wants to do, it just wouldn't be so horribly
exaggerated.

<P>Hi gang, I'm back! betcha thought (hoped) I was gone for good. well, both |&gt;oug
 and Stev0 have forwarded me articles about recording techniques used on The Red
 Shoes wondering why I haven't said anything. truth is, I have a new job, and my
 email situation is pretty flaky. also, there's not much to say. The Red Shoes
sounds  bad. period. 
</P>
<P>I don't know what the deal is with pop music these days but most of it
sounds  unbearably awful. 
</P>
<P>We just got a set of $5000 Meyer monitors for our studio and they do not
lie. the  red shoes sounds like shit. the new enigma album sounds incredibly
good. I don't  like it much musically, but you can't deny that the sound quality
is top-notch.  anyone who doubts is welcome to come over for a little round of
comparison  shopping. 
</P>
<P>I'm still not on love-hounds so if you want to flame me, make sure you cc a
copy  here.
