Subject: Review RUTH + Interview, Smash Hits Aug. 1985
</P>
<P>I just picked up a copy of the August 1985 issue of Smash Hits magazine.
It's a  pretty awful pop music magazine, but this issue has a full page ad for &quot;Running
Up  That Hill&quot; and a small interview and several reviews of RUTH. I'll
include all this  stuff (well, not the ad) in this letter. 
</P>
<P>The singles reviewer, Ian Cranna, seems to have fairly reasonable tastes
(and I say  this on the basis of his other reviews not just because he likes
Kate Bush), which  seems strange for a trashy pop magazine. Maybe all the decent
critics in England  work for trashy pop magazines, rather than the supposedly
refined music journals  (which are actually even more trash). 
</P>
<P>These are the reviews for &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. They appear
scattered  throughout his reviews of other singles: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Running Up That Hill (EMI) -- Now *this* is how to return in 
style! Yet more modern experimenting with pounding percussive rhythms and 
electronic sounds, but with its melodic strength, intriguing lyrics (about deals
with  God) and coolly restrained performance, this sounds not unlike Eurythmics
before  they went off the boil recently. It's definitely, um, what's the
expression? Uh, er --  look, I'll come back to you on this one... 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Running Up That Hill (EMI) -- Er, amazing? No -- too obvious. 
Uh, hang on a mo... 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Running Up That Hill (EMI) -- ... appetising? No --hey don't go 
away... 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Running Up That Hill (EMI) -- ... provocative? piquant? 
tantalising? ... 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Running Up That Hill (EMI) -- ... interesting? Yes, that's it -- 
*interesting*! And therefore it must also be (ta daa) Single Of The Fortnight! 
Hurray! Don't you just love a happy ending? 
</P>
<P>Here's the short interview with her. It appears with a picture of her, where
 she's dressed up all trendy-like (I'm upset!). Also, Kate seems much more
assertive  in this interview than she used to be. This is probably a good thing,
but she doesn't  come off quite the same way she did a few years ago. Then
again, the article has only  provided selected quotes. 
</P>
<P>Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
</P>
<P>Friends. Cast your mind back a few years and you might recall a raven haired
 &quot;beauty&quot; with a squeaky voice being very famous. Kate Bush, right?
She had loads of  hits with things like &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;Wow&quot;
and &quot;Babooshka&quot;, and dodgy  impressionists were always on the telly
doing &quot;comic&quot; imitations of her dancing  technique (much wiggling of
the arms etc.) 
</P>
<P>Anyway, in 1982 Kate seemed to disappear. Pouff! She was gone! Just like
that! 
</P>
<P>But now she's back with a new single -- &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; --
and a long  player to follow. And *Bitz*, long time admirers of the &quot;lady&quot;
who was renowned  throughout the globe for using the words &quot;amazing&quot;
and/or &quot;wow&quot; about seventeen  times in every possible sentence,
managed to wangle an exclusive 'n' legendary  interviewette. 
</P>
<P>So, Kate, says *Bitz*, you haven't been doing very much for about three
years... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Would you care to rephrase that?&quot; says she. 
</P>
<P>Oh dear. Seems that la Bush has actually been tres busy, building her own 
recording studio, writing zillions of new songs and being generally &quot;creative&quot;.
 Whoops. 
</P>
<P>So, Kate, now that you're back will you be treating us to your funny dancing
all  over again? 
</P>
<P>&quot;You have a way with words, young man.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh dear. 
</P>
<P>So, Kate, do you get recognised when you're out shopping at *Sainsburys*? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I find it very interesting and very positive because I haven't
actually been in  the public eye for a while and people do constantly recognise
me and they're very  nice. They're very nice people.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What do they say to you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hello.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Quite. So, Kate, what about TV? Do you watch TV? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, when I can. Normally it's Saturday evenings when I get a chance
to watch  the box. It's my weekly rubbish and it helps me to unwind. It's
wonderful to  unwind with something visual like a great film or *The Young Ones*
or *Fawlty  Towers*.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I wonder what these TV shows are... 
</P>
<P>One thing is puzzling *Bitz*. We've been &quot;rapping&quot; for some time
now and Kate  hasn't said &quot;amazing&quot; or &quot;wow&quot; once. 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, I haven't. I think they call it aversion therapy, don't they? I
think one  changes words that one found interesting at the time. And that was a
*long* time  ago. And you chappies are *so* fond of pulling up things that
happened a *long*  time ago.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ahem, yes. So Kate, what words do you find interesting these days? 
</P>
<P>&quot;'Interesting'. That's an interesting word... And 'boomerang'...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Quite... 
</P>
<P>Well, that's all for now. My fingers are tired. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Let me steal this moment from you now&quot;

<P>Fawlty Towers was a sitcom John Cleese and Michael Palin (I think) were 
involved with before Monty Python's Flying Circus.

<BR> Subject: Fawlty Towers 
</P>
<P>I don't recall Michael Palin's appearing in *Fawlty Towers*, a show starring
John  Cleese as Basil Fawlty, landlord of the boarding house named &quot;Fawlty
Towers.&quot;  Fawlty was always getting into trouble for voyeurism (mostly
attempted only),  promising boarders services he didn't deliver, etc. It had its
moments, but wasn't up  to Python snuff. (Which caused me to not watch all the
episodes, possibly including  one with Mr. Palin...oh, well.)
