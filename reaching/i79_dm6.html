<P><STRONG>What Kate won't do next</STRONG></P>
<P>By STAN SAYER</P>
<P>SINGER Kate Bush has turned down the chance  to be a film star.</P>
<P>For the two leading roles she was offered  were in HORROR movies -- about
vampires.</P>
<P>And the prospect didn't wow 20-year-old  Kate at all.</P>
<P>She chuckled yesterday: &quot; It's interesting  to see how people cast you.
But I don't think I'm anything like a vampire.&quot;</P>
<P><STRONG>  Best</STRONG></P>
<P>Kate, who was voted best female singer in the  Daily Mirror Rock and Pop
Awards last week is  currently starring in her first show at the London 
Palladium.</P>
<P>And she insisted: &quot;Music and the theatre  are the only important things
in my life.&quot;</P>
<P>Did that exclude marriage ?</P>
<P>Kate said: &quot;I have some boyfrlends, but  no one steady.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The only reason I would marry is to have children  and they are a
responsibility that can't be taken lightly. </P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't have a career and children. It's either  one or the other.&quot;
</P>
<P>What about her &quot;sex symbol&quot; tag?</P>
<P>Kate said: &quot; It worried me at first that people  would look upon me as
a body and a face and  ignore my music.</P>
<P>&quot;Nowadays I accept the sex symbol remarks  as a compliment.&quot;</P>
