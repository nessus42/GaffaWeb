<P>Hounds of Love: Kate Bush<BR> EMl America ST-17171, $8.98.</P>
<P>Sound: B   <BR>   Performance: A +</P>
<P>Hounds of Love has given me the kind of thrill I always  look for but too
rarely find. It is Kate Bush's fifth album, her first since 1982, and it is the
best work she has done to date.  Kate has always been a challenging artist,
absolutely fearless  when it comes to taking risks or presenting something
different. On Hounds of Love the challenge to the listener is as strong as 
ever, but what excites me is the new-found strength and  confidence which infuse
the album.</P>
<P>There is tremendous variety here, and it is dangerous to  anticipate what
will come next; it's better and far more satisfying to simply put the album on,
strap yourself down  and go along for the ride.</P>
<P>The first and third cuts on side one, &quot;Running up That Hill&quot;  and &quot;Big
Sky,&quot; are urgent, churning, unsatisfied songs  about seeking personal
peace, what Kate calls in the former &quot;a deal with God.&quot; In between
them is &quot;Hounds of Love,&quot; which  is even more desperate and
harder-rocking. &quot;Mother Stands for  Comfort&quot; is an unquiet softer song
about a soul ailing under the weight of lies told to mother. This one features
Eberhard Weber's  lyrical bass. &quot;Cloudbursting,&quot; [sic] which closes
the side,  is a look back on childhood fears and joys, buttressed by a fierce
optimism that &quot;something good is going to happen.&quot;  On this song,
there is a beautiful string sextet arrangement of surprising power.</P>
<P>Side two opens with a lullaby, &quot;And Dream of Sheep,&quot;  before it
descends into a frightful dreamscape. In the wispy  &quot;Under Ice,&quot;
filtered vocal effects, the sound of thunder,  and other background action
heighten the sense of unreality.  This segues into the nightmare of &quot;Waking
the Witch.&quot;  Here Kate employs barely decipherable voices topped with Pink 
Floyd's helicopter effect from The Wall to create a spectacular,  scary,
stroboscopic vocal sound. In the aftermath of &quot;Waking the Witch,&quot; &quot;Watching
You Without Me&quot; is a quieter piece  that might be a love song from a ghost
to a former lover. In this song  are backwards voices and more stroboscopy plus
Danny Thompson's elegant double bass. Set as an Irish dance piece, &quot;Jig of
Life&quot;  has traditional instruments&#151;fiddles, whistles, bodhran, uillean
pipes&#151;at its core. Next, voices of astronauts in orbit form the segue to &quot;Hello
Earth,&quot;  which has the grand power of a big string and choral setting.  &quot;The
Morning Fog&quot; is a sprightly finale asserting anew the commitment to life
after a long, troubled sleep.</P>
<P>Kate Bush produced Hounds of Love herself. It is an audacious  effort, full
of daring and danger. In lesser hands it would have been  pretentious or
precious. Instead, it is invigorating.</P>
<P>The recorded sound is really special, as the album keeps bubbling  with
surprise sounds that feel completely new, many deriving from  what Kate does on
the Fairlight synthesizer. As I mentioned earlier,  the stereo effects are
uncommonly vivid. Hounds of Love is especially  fine for headphone listening. It
stands up very well under that kind  of scrutiny.</P>
<P>It is nice to see all of the lyrics included on the cassette  release&#151;even
if the printing is somewhat smeary and the type  itself is too small for most
people to read easily.</P>
<P>Hounds of Love is an album to treasure. It is one on which an  artist I've
long admired comes of age and realizes her potential.</P>

<P>Kate Bush<BR> Hounds of Love (EMI)</P>
<P>If &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; crept up on you from behind,  then
'Hounds Of Love' is an essential purchase.</P>
<P>Three years in the making, it's a haunting collection of musical  images.
Each track has been assembled with loving care and although the lyrics tend to
drift into Hippy Dippy Land you'd have to be a  supreme cynic to deny the beauty
of the finished product.</P>

<H2>HOUNDS OF LOVE</H2>
<P>Kate Bush<BR> EMI America</P>
<P>On her fifth album, the musical enigma that is Kate Bush  continues to
travel a unique path between the fragile piano sensitivity of Joni Mitchell and
the exploratory Fairlight-driven  drama of Peter Gabriel. Although still a cult
figure in North  America, this gifted British writer/performer/producer has 
based a hugely successful career on artful unpredictability: by turns whimsical,
pretentious and direct, her records  can be at once engagingly articulate and
absurdly ponderous.</P>
<P>The ambitious Hounds of Love begins strongly with the taut,  rhythmically
captivating &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;  and the similar-sounding title
track, but also devotes an entire  side to a rambling Gaelic-flavored concept
piece called  &quot;The Ninth Wave.&quot; Not bad, mind you, but it' s  far
easier to impress than entertain with such grandiosity;  there's something
uncomfortably archaic about a pop album  that seems so anxious to be thought of
as Art. Bush possesses  undeniable talent, craft and intelligence, and is
capable of  occasional excellence, but it's sometimes hard to take her as
seriously as she takes herself.</P>

&lt;nessus&gt; <BR> Subject: Review of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; in Smash Hits
Sep 85 
</P>
<P>In the 11-24 Sep 85 Smash Hits there is a review of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;.
&quot;Hounds of  Love&quot; is their pick of the month: 
</P>
<P>If you for a moment imagined that &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was a
fluke then one  listen to this will put you right. Side one is crammed with
songs that are just as good  and even side two's ambitious concept piece about a
drowning girl (&quot;The Ninth  Wave&quot;) is surprizingly successful. 
</P>
<P>In fact the only possible drawback is that it's the sort of record your
parents will  probably like too and pinch off you to play. 
</P>
<P>(9 out of 10). Chris Heath. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="mm1">In the 14 Sep 85 issue of Melody Maker there is an
announcement for the release  of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;: </A>
</P>
<P>Kate Bush releases her fifth album on September 16. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
-- written  and produced by Kate Bush -- divides into two sections. Side one
comprises five  tracks, including the hit single &quot;Running Up That Hill (A
Deal With God)&quot;. All five  songs on side one are thematic -- &quot;describing
fundamental differences between the  sexes and how differences lead to
misunderstanding in relationships.&quot; 
</P>
<P>No, they don't! &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; is about nothing of
the sort! It's a  love song to mom. Perhaps the other four songs could be
described that way, but I  would say that they are more about being scared of
love and overcoming this  problem. I'm not sure how &quot;Mother Stands For
Comfort&quot; fits into this theme. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="sounds1">In the 14 Sep 85 issue of Sounds, there are two letters
regarding Kate Bush. One  is a letter from a</A> representative of EMI denying
all rumors that EMI interfered with  the album at all. EMI claims that the album
is *exactly* the way Kate wanted it to  be. They claim that the album was
delayed because Kate was unsatisfied with parts  of it, and wanted to re-record
those parts. 
</P>
<P>There is a lot of evidence, though, that EMI pressured Kate to change the
name  of &quot;A Deal With God&quot; to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and
that this caused a several  month delay because all the artwork had to be
redone. 
</P>
<P>The other letter is from a Kate Bush fan who is upset that some people are 
comparing Kate with Madonna. I haven't seen anyone do such a thing, thank 
goodness. Where are they? I'll kill them!

<P><A NAME="confused">Date: Sat, 21 Sep 85 18:03:09 edt </A><BR> From: Doug
Alan &lt;nessus&gt; <BR> Subject: NME says Kate Bush is England's best solo
artist ever! Sept. 1985 
</P>
<P>This is something that I just posted to net.music: 
</P>
<P>[I just can't be quiet about this.] 
</P>
<P>I've been told many times that the &quot;serious&quot; British music press
can't stand Kate  Bush. That because she's female, upper-class, beautiful,
romantic, was handed a  record contract at the age of sixteen and was
immediately a huge success without  ever having to struggle, speaks with a lisp,
and always says &quot;Wow!&quot; and &quot;Amazing!&quot;  and other &quot;hippyisms&quot;
that she was viewed as someone who clearly couldn't have  any real talent. The
stereotypical reaction to her was supposedly something like  &quot;She's just a
spaced-out druid with lush tits&quot;. 
</P>
<P>When last month Helen Fitzgerald of Melody Maker reviewed the single  &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; she did so stereotypically, saying that Kate Bush must have 
phony tits and should be burned at the stake. So everything I had been told
about  the British music press was confirmed. 
</P>
<P>Strangely, in the past several weeks there has been a total turn-around in
the  reaction in the British music press towards Kate Bush. For the first time
in seven  years she is getting the recognition she deserves. *Now* it is &quot;hip&quot;
to like Kate Bush.  Reviews for her new album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; have
just appeared and I haven't yet  found a negative one. In fact, everyone I have
found except one has been a *rave*  review. 
</P>
<P>The NME, which has traditionally been one of the magazines which continually
 makes fun of her, says that &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is the best album of the
year! &quot;Kate's  a genius, the rarest solo artist this country's ever
produced.&quot; &quot;Sounds&quot; gave it five  stars: &quot;If I were allowed
to swear, I'd say that 'Hounds of Love' is f***ing brilliant,  but me mum won't
let me.... all human life contained herein. Dramatic, moving and  wildly,
unashamedly, beautifully romantic.&quot; Of the big weeklies, only Melody Maker 
did less than rave. Their reaction is mixed, but they say that parts of it are
great. The  reviewer, though says that he can't stand concept albums. How's that
for being  unbiased? 
</P>
<P>In other magazines, Smash Hits gave it a 9 out of 10. It is the pick of the
month.  The reviewer for Kerrang, Mick Wall, wrote two pages of verbal orgasm. &quot;Young
 Kate's a f**king genius.&quot; He's clearly a Kate Bush fanatic. He's one of
the very few  people who gave &quot;The Dreaming&quot; a positive review, and he
orgasmed over that too,  but he did so more than a year after the album had been
released. Yes, this is  Kerrang -- the heavy metal magazine! Kate headlines with
Kiss, Crawling Chaos,  The Venom, Ozzy, and Saga! Oh boy, oh boy! 
</P>
<P>So what's really puzzling me is why is it suddenly okay to like Kate Bush?
In fact,  now she's even being lavished with praise, when before she was
considered just  about as hip as Bobby Sherman. If it's the change in her image
away from a cute sex  kitten, then how come &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was
demolished by the British press? Maybe  nobody really listened to it because
they had their minds already made up? 
</P>
<P>Is all this praise a good sign? Maybe there is some fatal flaw with the
album that  I'm missing and it isn't really the second best album ever recorded
-- some fatal  flaw that causes the jerks in the British music press to love it.

</P>
<P>If the media reaction is any indication of the popular reaction to &quot;Hounds
of  Love&quot;, Kate Bush will soon be a multi-zillionare. Maybe then she can
afford to buy  her own transatlantic boat, and won't have to depend on the QE2
working, and can  make it over to the U.S. this time around. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="nme1">In any case, here is the entire review by Jane Solana that
was in the NME. It does  a little bit to explain</A> the change in the media
reaction: 
</P>
<P>BUGGER &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;! Signed up, like a footballer at age 16
by EMI  Records, Kate Bush in her 11 year reign as pop's most idiosyncratic
female has  always been tainted by the notion that as &quot;the company's
daughter&quot; she represents  The Establishment and therefore is -- RIGHT
OFF... 
</P>
<P>Beloved of Radio 1 producers and TV pop show awards, Kate Bush has been  &quot;family
entertainment&quot; for many years; a lovable fact of media life. Even the 
rumours surrounding Bush's three year disappearance (compulsive eating, junk,
and  religious fervor) didn't hold water. Washed up? Our Kate? NEVER... 
</P>
<P>'Running Up That Hill' hit the singles chart and blew heads away.
Principally,  because no one's heard a classy 45, totally lacking in
teen-appeal, in months. Kate  Bush, at 27, is at last HIP. I hope she's
laughing, because people have been in stiches  over her. 
</P>
<P>Before we're trampled in the rush for copies of Kate Bush's new LP, a brief 
reminder of 'The Dreaming' -- the 1982 Bush album no one bought. I don't want to
 hear anyone say 'Hounds of Love' is far out who hasn't heard its predecessor, 
because -- three years' gap or not -- it's an obvious progression of the skill
shown  on 'The Dreaming'. 
</P>
<P>Musically and lyrically Kate Bush's influences haven't changed since 'The 
Dreaming' and its three brilliant singles ('Sat In Your Lap', 'The Dreaming', 
'There Goes A Tenner') bombed. Only the climate has changed, ie the BBC and a 
nation of reactionary punters are now ready for our Kate's weird shit. 
</P>
<P>And 'Hounds of Love' is definitely weird. It's not an album for the suicidal
or  mums and dads. The violence of 'The Dreaming' has turned into despair,
confusion  and fear -- primarily of love, a subject that remains central to
Bush's songwriting.  'Running Up That Hill' was one hell of a depressing record
to be bopping around  the living room to. It explores the horrors of
relationships and pin-pointed the total  lack of communication between men and
women. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You never understood me/ You never really tried&quot; is a line sung
aggressively by  Bush on 'The Big Sky', a track on the supposedly 'up' side of
'Hounds of Love'.  The desperation of revealing truth to anyone, let alone a
lover, runs througout the  album. 
</P>
<P>Ironically, Bush uses her most cryptic lyrics to get this message across eg &quot;And
if  I only could/ I'd make a deal with God/ And I'd get him to swap our places&quot;
didn't  endear her to the more literal-minded members of the record buying
public. What  *they* are going to make of side two of 'Hounds of Love' is
anyone's guess,  because that dreaded late '60s affliction, 'the concept album',
has been resurrected  by Bush. Result: an entire side of Kate stuck in a pond
drowning... 
</P>
<P>Ludicrous as that may sound, 'The Ninth Wave' sequence works, though it's
far  from immediate and may well piss off those used to Kate Bush's more
traditional  approach to crafting songs (The Beatles and folk music being a
strong source). 
</P>
<P>But there is plenty of *that* on side one, any track which would make a fine
 single, though I'd pick out 'Cloudbusting' as the best. 
</P>
<P>Complex music it may well be, but Kate Bush will always have the ace card up
 her sleeve in that she consistently manages to make her records erotic, however
 depressing the lyrical content. The Bush voice drips with sex. But whereas it
used to  be middle-class and 'virginal' (David Hamilton posters and
bed-sitters), it's now  classless and shamelessly aggressive (a mad thrash up an
alley). Many a seduction  scene will go down as 'Hounds of Love' grinds to a
halt on the deck. If you think  that's a preposterous notion, then you're a
sucker for marketing; EMI have  packaged this album with Kate Bush (famous tits
tastefully concealed) in bed with  two dogs. 
</P>
<P>When The Establishment's on your side you can get away with murder. You can 
do just one tour in ten years, spend limitless hours and many a tenner in the
studio,  leap around your own dance studio to your heart's content, stick your
family all over  your records, fuck off for three years and come zooming
straight back into the  charts like you've never been anywhere at all. In any
other artist it would be  sickening, but our Kate's a genius, the rarest solo
artist this country's ever  produced. She makes skeptics dance to *her* tune.
The company's daughter has  truly screwed the system and produced the best album
of the year doing it. You may  all go and kiss the sleeve. I have...

Alan &lt;nessus&gt; <BR> Subject: Review Sounds (12 Oct 85) 
</P>
<P>From Sounds (12 Oct 85): 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush unleashes a new single from her 'Hounds of Love' album on October 
14. 'Cloudbusting' is backed with a new tune, 'Burning Bridge', while the
12-inch  has a completely altered/extended remix of 'Cloudbusting' titled 'The
Organon  Mix', in addition to the normal B-side *and* a traditional tune -- 'My
Lagan Love'  -- with new lyrics by Kate. The song 'Cludbusting' is said to be
inspired by a book  called 'A Book Of Dreams' 
</P>
<P>[It is remarkable that Sounds picked up on this, because I've never seen
Kate say  anywhere that the song is based on 'A Book Of Dreams', though it
clearly is. She  only said that it was based on a book she had read.] 
</P>
<P>and is about the relationship between a father and son. Our obscurity expert
 Sandy Robertson says this is undoubtedly the same book -- by Peter Reich about
his  unorthodox scientist father Wilhelm Reich -- which inspired Patti Smith's
legendary  song 'Birdland'. So *there*! 
</P>
<P>[It did too. Anyone want to help me design a Wilhelm Reich set for my radio 
show? Know of any Wilhelm Reich related songs? I know of three: 'Cloudbusting', 
'Birdland', and 'Orgone Accumulator' (by Hawkwind).]

<P>From: harvard!uucp (Black Hole) <BR> Date: Mon, 28 Oct 85 15:56:23 GMT
<BR> Subject: Two Reviews, Oct. 1985
</P>
<P> Just found the following articles involving Kate Bush... 
</P>
<P><A NAME="bwo">Review of HOL</A> from the Bexleyheath and Welling Observer, 
</P>
<P>by Clive Goodman. 
</P>
<P>Dated: October 17th. 
</P>
<P>Under the Headline : Elfin Kate still at top. 
</P>
<P> A three-year lay-off is a long time to be out of circulation, even if you
are one of  the biggest-selling female singers ever to sprout up in the UK. Not
that it seems to  have made the slightest difference to the elfin one. Straight
in with both the single  and the album is no mean feat. No surprise though -
because this is tailor-made for  chart action. Harder and more rythmically
positive than the early stuff - but still  with that haunting, ethereal quality
that elevates La Bush above the chart hoi poloi. 
</P>
<P>Its really two albums in one with &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; taking up the
first side while  the - ahem - conceptual &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; hogs side
two. First things first - and it  leads out with the single verson of &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; which surpasses anything  Bush has done previously in terms
of romance, power and rhythm. Then theres the  wilder, less spartan &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; itself which throbs rather than rocks while  those classic
breathless vocals slide over the top. 
</P>
<P>But best of the lot is &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot; with its spiky,
stretched tension  and slabs of thick textured rhythm. The only sour note is
slipping in the 12-inch  version of &quot;Running&quot; as a closer.(??) Cheap
short that... 
</P>
<P>Then over to side two for the more experimental, and the less sucessful, &quot;The
 Ninth Wave&quot;, based on a drowning mans impressions and illusions. Good in
sections,  like the openers &quot;And Dreams of Sheep&quot; and the taut,
atmospheric &quot;Under Ice&quot; with  its staggered strings and hard
arrangement. But as a whole its just a touch too  complex and clever-dick to
stand close inspection. 
</P>
<P>As a whole though, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is hard to fault on any level
- production, by  Bush herself, performance and writing... 
</P>
<P> <A NAME="mirror">Item in &quot;The Mirror&quot;</A> dated October 24th. 
</P>
<P>Headline : Kates Haunting theme. 
</P>
<P> SPOOKY singer Kate Bushs video team have been upset by a ghost. They had an
 eerie time in their four days of filming at the White Horse Hill beauty spot in
 Oxfordshire. 
</P>
<P>A local said yesterday : &quot;They found it very disturing. They said they

<P>Kate Bush lets her imagination run wild on this fascinating but flawed
album. It's  not quite up to her last, 1982's ``The Dreaming,'' which offered
clearer lyrics and  more striking tunes, but in terms of outright invention,
this one goes further. Side 1  is slightly more conven-tional, including the
subtle but catchy single ``Running Up  That Hill,'' which recalls Peter
Gabriel's recent work. ``Cloudbursting'' sounds  like an Elizabe-than pop song;
``The Big Sky'' borrows from African rhythms; and  ``Mother Stands for Comfort''
replaces drums with breaking glass. Side 2, subtitled  ``The Ninth Wave,'' is a
25-minute suite about spiritual travels. The music takes a  number of surprising
turns; a spectral ballad breaks into an Irish jig leading into a  long stretch
of choral music. Bush makes some unearthly vocal sounds. In one  segment she
creates a witch trial, doctoring her voice into an ominous male chorus.  It's
unsettling but positive, ending with an upbeat affirmation of life and love.
Bush  has come a long way from her early days as a soft-rocking
singer-songwriter.

</P>
<P>Here's something I found on the Pasadena Weekly (yes, Pasadena! Not just for
 little old ladies. . .) 
</P>
<P>Reprinted (of course) without permission: 
</P>
<P>In those English girls school stories there's always one student who's
forever lost  in elaborate daydreams, equally under the spell of the classics,
the mystics, and the  romantics. That's Kate Bush, who *was* a schoolgirl when
she signed her first  record contract at age sixteen in 1976. Her records have
always been ambitious and  fascinating works, earning her Big Star status in
England and a rabid cult following  on this side of the pond. But youthful lack
of restraint (or something) frequently  caused her to go overboard with her
unique voice and fondness for heavy thoughts. 
</P>
<P>Now with her fifth album, Hounds of Love (EMI America), Bush has matured. 
She still deals in High Concepts--side two concerns the levels of consciousness 
experienced by a person close to drowining at sea, and the first pressings of
the  album are on vinyl that looks like marble, for crissakes! 
</P>
<P>But this is her first outing without at least one moment to make you cringe
at its  feyness. The lush music is highly rewarding at any level of listening,
and concerted  attention reveals much magic stored in its many layers. 
</P>
<P>What's more, *Hounds Of Love* is actually finding a wide audience here in
the  States! The single &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; (already a fave in the
dance clubs) and  the album are climbing the charts even as you read this.
Available at Poobah Records  and Moby Disc. [two local records stores, known for
their used-recollection.]

<P>p.s. Seeing that she was born in 1958, less than five years older than me,
makes  me wonder what've ** I ** been doing with my life.

<P>HOUNDS OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>Singer-songwriter-keyboardist Bush is very popular in her native England.
This  self-produced album should enhance her reputation here. True, she's not
likely to  become the biggest of pop stars, because her songs are often morose,
resembling  Shakespearean soliloquies a lot more than they do Top 40 hits. Her
lyrics also reflect  a primitive belief in animism, conjuring up images of
Stonehenge: &quot;Go to sleep little  earth/I was there at the birth/ Out of the
cloud burst the head of the Tempest.&quot;  Nonetheless, such songs as &quot;RUTH&quot;
and the title track boast inventive, overdubbed  harmonies, dark ritualistic
drumming and a stark magnetism reminiscent of Stevie  Nicks' best work. (Sue's
note -- BLASPHEMY!) &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; and  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
are atmospheric in a sad, wistful way too. For those with a taste for  dreamy,
brooding music, this could be an engrossing album.

<P>And now, an additional note on &quot;HOL&quot; reviews. Remember the passage
that was  quoted here a couple of weeks ago about Kate playing Ophelia to her
own Hamlet.  That was written by a good friend of mine, J.D. Considine, in
Musician magazine. He  is not a big Kate fan. I asked what it meant, and he
said, &quot;Read the play,&quot; or words to  that effect. &quot;These literary
allusions go right over people's heads.&quot; He's a nice guy  though. We
disagree a lot.

Trowbridge &lt;ins aset@jhunix&gt; <BR> Subject: Spin Dec. 1985
</P>
<P>In the latest SPIN magazine, &quot;HOL&quot; is their Platter du Jour (best
of the month, I  guess). The review is rather simplistic but there's a nice pic
of KB in a weird little  hat with a tassel... 
</P>
<P>(Reprinted w/out permission, of course.) 
</P>
<P>If Kate Bush had been a writer instead of a musician, she might have written
 something like &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; She writes children's songs for
adults,  constantly drifting into girlish dreams, while maintaining a vibrant
sense of romantic  adventure. Every little daydream and all her fragile emotions
are projected into a  fantasyland of poetic imagery and off-beat music. With
traces of classical, operatic,  tribal, and twisted pop styles, Kate creates
music that observes no boundaries of  musical structure or inner expression. 
</P>
<P>Though she has always been a top 10 artist in Europe (this album was No. 1
in  England as of this writing), her odd style and even odder vocal squeal have
always  kept her off the American charts. (ST note - Well, &quot;The Man With
The Child In His  Eyes&quot; *did* make it to #89 or thereabouts...) But even
though Kate continues on an  offbeat course, this album might gain her some
well-deserved recognition from the  American mainstream. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;HOL,&quot; Kate continues making Gothic pop with brooding string
arrangements,  sparse and dissonant percussion, and her bittersweet vocal
squawks and squeaks.  While she introduced intermittent pop touches on her
previous album, &quot;The  Dreaming,&quot; her music is still anything but pop.
On side one's &quot;RUTH&quot; and the title  cut, she maintains her romantic
edge, but structures her songs more accessibly,  singing within a range that
isn't overly abrasive or far-reaching. These changes  don't appear to have been
made as concessions, and certainly don't hurt. 
</P>
<P>The rest of side one has more of Kate's twisted musical sensibility and the
lyrics  deal with her confused romantic desires. She wants to be enraptured by
love, but  always ends up shattered and lonely. Just when she wants to be left
to herself, she  becomes morose in her independence. On &quot;The Big Sky,&quot;
Kate again adds a more  accessible touch, with hints of psychedelia, but then
returns to the familiar womb of  her childhood fantasyland on &quot;Mother
Stands for Comfort.&quot; The side closes with  &quot;Cloud-bursting&quot;
(sic), which appears to be an anti-nuclear song with an  arrange-ment framed by
haunting orchestration and a minimal rhythmic approach. 
</P>
<P>While side one is subtitled &quot;The HOL&quot; and is a collection of quite
different songs,  side two, entitled &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; is a somewhat
loosely interconnected collection  of musical movements that are even more
bizarre and mystical than Kate's previous  works. She dreams again on the
operatic &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; and is emotionally  trapped on the
claustro-phobic &quot;Under Ice.&quot; On &quot;Waking the Witch,&quot; one of
the  most puzzling songs on the album, Kate brings a funkier edge to her music
and  seems to be in a state of spiritual confusion. Any other interpretations
beyond that  should be left to individual opinion. 
</P>
<P>It took three years for Kate to make this album, and it was two years before
that  that she last released an album. (ST note - I thought &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
was 82) With  no plans to tour America, Kate is likely to remain obscure on this
side of the  Atlantic. While her eclecticism is well (scratch that) welcomed and
rewarded in her  homeland her genius still goes ignored here - a situation that
is truly a shame for an  artist so adventurous and naturally theatrical.

<H2>Stereo Review - January 1986</H2>
<H3>THE NEW KATE BUSH </H3>
<P>Kate Bush is a spellbinding storyteller, a vocal acrobat, and an  intriguing
composer and arranger. What she hasn't been credited  with until now is a pretty
voice. In fact, Bush has always gone  out of her way to make her listeners
uncomfortable. That's  changed with her new album, &quot;Hounds of Love.&quot;
This time Kate Bush will meet you halfway. Although &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
deals  with a lover's murder and death by drowning, compared with her  brilliant
but difficult 1982 release, &quot;The Dreaming,&quot; it's  positively tranquil.
The bizarre vocal tricks-&#151;roller-coaster  phrasing and digitized,
reassembled voice&#151;-that characterized the earlier album have been relegated
to occasional ornamentation, and the lurching, fits-and-starts rhythms of &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;  have given way to more conventional rhythms rooted in African 
and Irish Folk music. Bush's singing here is sensitive,  almost girlish. It may
be a compromise, and it's certainly  not as daring as  its predecessor, but
you're far more apt to be able to sit through it without suffering an anxiety
attack.</P>
<P>The new album is actually two mini-concept albums. Side one,  also titled &quot;Hounds
of Love,&quot; is the more elusive since it is  less about love than about some
of love's attendant emotions&#151;fear,  alienation, rage, and confusion. In the
title song, for instance,  the narrator compares falling in love to a fox being
chased down  by hounds. Much of &quot;Hounds&quot; marches along to steady,
galloping  rhythms. Bush employs drums very much the way Peter Gabriel does,
putting the music in motion through a succession of violent  climaxes and hushed
pauses. Her vocals carry on a dialogue with,  in turn, piano, drums, and bass,
and they are shadowed virtually everywhere by a Fairlight backing vocal. &quot;Hounds&quot;
is far more  pleasant to listen to than to contemplate, and the same is true  of
side two, &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; which re-creates the last moments  of a
drowning victim, an eternity of recollections and hallucinations  compressed
into a few final breaths. Here the electronic effects  are more integral&#151;whirring
helicopters, bullhorns, tangled tape-loop voices, chiming synthesized church
bells, echoing snatches of conversation,  and a host of fantastic characters
hurtle into and  out of the victim's ebbing consciousness. Bush's vocals, which
explore a range of feelings&#151;terror, sadness, resignation, and, finally,
euphoria&#151;are posed against an instrumental tableau in  which strings,
piano, and synthesizer shift in and out of the foreground. The growing
sophistication of Kate Bush's compositions, arrangements, and production
techniques does not obscure her unique, weird point of view. Only she could make
such macabre subjects so  seductive.</P>

<P>The following review appeared in Phoenix: The magazine for Kent students : 
</P>
<P>-My comments in []. 
</P>
<P> After three years absence, Kate is back with an album that could only be
called  a myraid of haunting spectualar tracks. The *Wuthering Heights*
screeching has  been replaced with a patchwork of sounds including Sade-esque
soul, traditional  irish folk backing music and drumming that could have
originated at an Apache  indian tribal dance! Although this mixture sounds well
[,] its odd to say the least; the  credit goes to Kate for getting it to work!!
And it does!! 
</P>
<P>She's lost the little girl lyrics and come up with subtle political
messages,  hard-hitting poetry and there's even helicopter sounds at the end of
*Waking the  Witch* on side 2 which are taken from Pink Floyds *The Wall*. [ Big
deal !! ] 
</P>
<P>Some cynics may say its too fragmented, *EMI* had to be bullied into
releasing it  [anybody else heard this ?] and others think her passe but.
*Hounds of Love* is the  *Best* album l've heard this year and was well worth
waiting for!! 
</P>
<P>[Reviewed by T.B.] 
</P>
<P>My comments :-
</P>
<P> First i think the people at Phoenix should get a better proof-reader, in
the  original *Waking the Witch* was *Walking the Witch* :-) The reviewer talks
about  subtle political message, I didn't think there were any on HOL. The
comment about  Helicopter sounds being from *The Wall*, so what was so great
about this?? 
</P>
<P>Finally even though the Reviewer seems to be confused, at least he/she likes
the  album. 
</P>
<P>Oh, and before I forget :- A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!

Bush in Digital Audio Jan. 1986
</P>
<P> Performance: 9/10 
</P>
<P>Sound Quality: 9/10 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's music has always come from the heart. Although Hounds of Love is
 a complex and richly layered work, it's no exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>Since releasing the primitive but inspired The Kick Inside at the age of 18,
Bush  has evolved into a kind of modern renaissance woman: writer, producer, and
 Fairlight &quot;player.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her lyrics go far beyond the expected pop music norm of adolescent writing. 
They have depth and are always interesting, even though some of the meanings may
 be known only to Bush herself. Bush isn't a &quot;churn it out no matter what&quot;
kind of  artist; she has never followed the album-a-year formula. For this
reason, her works  tend to be creative and unique. 
</P>
<P>This does not, however, mean that Hounds of Love is for everybody. Bush has 
always had a highly original and idosyncratic style that never allows a
listener's  opinion to fall on middle ground. But once planted, the seeds of
Bush's strange but  seductive vocal melodies and harmonies grow and ripen with
each listen. 
</P>
<P>Part of the success of Hounds of Love stems from its use of so many
different  textures without compromising musicality. These include processed
and/or layered  vocals, unusual tones and sound effects, traditional
instruments, all manner of real  and electronic drums and percussion...the list
goes on. &quot;The Big Sky&quot; and &quot;Waking  the Witch&quot; are fine
experiments in varying textures. 
</P>
<P>Bush says she aimed for a perfect blend of the best acoustic and electronic
sounds  on this recording. Striving for acoustic perfection she solicits the
help of instruments  such as fiddles, whistles, bouzouki, uillean pipes, and
dijeridu. 
</P>
<P>On the electronic side, Bush skillfully explores the possibilities of the 
Fairlight--that part keyboard, part computer which enables the competent user to
 create a variety of sounds almost without limitation. &quot;Watching You
Without Me,&quot; a  song with a distinctly Eastern flavor, is a gorgeous blend
of acoustic bass and  Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>The sound quality of this disc is first-rate. Part of this may be attributed
to  Bush's sensitive approach to producing her own music, competent engineering,
and  digital mixdown--all of which leads to a clean and well-balanced recording.

</P>
<P>If you're tired of waking up to the same old CDs every morning, the
freshness of  Hounds of Love will make your day.

<P>&quot;Pop: Music for a New Year&quot; 
</P>
<P>by Pam Lambert 
</P>
<P>Wall Street Journal 12/30/85 
</P>
<P>With &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (EMI), Britain's Kate Bush compellingly
stakes her claim  as a major voice in pop music. On this album, her fifth,
Bush's craft as a producer  has blossomed to match her creative vision. The
result is at once the artist's most  accessible release -- and the brightest
sound I've heard in quite a while. 
</P>
<P>Bush took two years to make the record. It shows. Her four-octave range and 
Fairlight synthesizer are the base for impressionistic aural landscapes that at
times  swell to orchestral complexity, at others simplify to the directness of a
march. 
</P>
<P>Though the album opens with the exceptional &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;,
whose  loping rhythms made it a natural first single, the second side is the
real showpiece. A  phantasmagorical seven-song voyage through the ebbing
consciousness of a drowning  victim, it flows from dreamy numbness to terror to
something approching euphoria.  Which is just what Kate Bush is likely to leave
you feeling.

the M25. Bush has  always strived to be different, but this quest has often led
her astray -- an olive stone  in the ashtray of life. `Hounds of Love' eschews
the lentil nightmare as Bush  reaches notes most groups never even dream of.

</P>
<P>The following is from the &quot;Chartfile&quot; section by Alan Jones: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Now more than eight years into her chart career, Kate Bush has
singlehandedly  written all 15 of her hit singles, a figure unrivalled by any
other female  singer/songwriter in the world. 
</P>
<P>Kate Also shares the distinction of being one of only three women to pluck
more  than three top 40 hits off an album (Tina Turner and Madonna are the other
two). 
</P>
<P>Kate's &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; has been raided for &quot;Running Up That
Hill&quot; (#3)  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; (#20), &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
(#18) and &quot;The Big Sky&quot; (#37). In addition to  spawning these hits,
the &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; album has sold over 400,000 copies in its  own
right, and is the fourth best selling compact disc ever released in Britain,
lining  up behind Dire Straits' &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, and &quot;Love
Over Gold&quot;, and Phil Collins'  &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Regarding the release of &quot;the Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Never for Ever&quot;
on Compact disc,  in view of the above information, it is almost certainly legal
hassles between Kate  and EMI (probably regarding royalty payments, like the
Beatles) that are causing the  delay in release, rather than pressing plant
limitations. (After all, they managed to  get repressings done of the first two
albums...) After all, HoL, according to the  above, is EMI's largest selling
compact disc EVER, so they are probably dying to  release the others on CD.

</P>
<P>Here's the latest news from today's new issue of RECORD MIRROR (June 21): 
</P>
<P>2) Well, I think I'l just copy down the section from &quot;Chartfile&quot;
which has the rest  of the Kate news: 
</P>
<P>&quot;A fortnight ago I stated that Kate Bush, Madonna and Tina Turner were
the  only women to take more than three hit singles off an album. As I'm now
reminded  by David Ashton of East Molesey and Charles Chan of no stated abode,
Donna  Summer had four hits off her album, &quot;I Remember Yesterday.&quot; We
should note, too,  that Kate Bush's &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; album which I
conservatively estimated as selling  400,000 copies, has in fact sold over
600,000 copies. Kates all-time best-seller remains  the introductory &quot;The
Kick Inside,&quot; which sold over 930,000 copies. EMI will  undoubtedly be
hoping for Kate's first million seller from her forthcoming  (November) greatest
hits package, which will include a couple of new songs.  Meanwhile, Bush's
exquisite duet with Peter Gabriel, &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; has been 
confirmed as the next single from his platinum album, &quot;So&quot;.

(Doug Alan) <BR> Subject: Reviews Blitz + MM 1986
</P>
<P>Sometimes I think that someone should just off the entire British music
press. 
</P>
<P>I just read two disgusting articles on Peter Gabriel and one on Kate Bush.
The  two articles on Peter Gabriel, one in Blitz and one in Melody Maker, were
both  written by this jerk named Jim Shelley. I realized they were by the same
person by  the inane writing style. In both the articles, he is extremely petty.
He spends most of  the time talking about how pathetic Peter is because when
Peter talks he pauses and  says &quot;er...&quot; a lot. The fact that he thinks
Kate Bush is &quot;our only genius&quot; does not  redeem him. In fact, his
articles seem like parodies of all those awful articles several  years back on
Kate Bush, where they spent all their time attacking her because  she'd say &quot;wow&quot;
and &quot;amazing&quot; all the time. 
</P>
<P>The article on Kate Bush is just as bad. Richard Cook insults Peter Gabriel;
 defames all of art-rock, the Grimm stories and the excellent movie *The Company
of  Wolves*; and calls Pink Floyd &quot;the most miserable group that ever
existed&quot; in the  process of attacking Kate. But I think that these quotes
from the article 
</P>
<P>... Like her underwear, her guard doesn't drop for a moment.... 
</P>
<P>... The cosiness of Bush denies her any erotic standing in pop. She's a
family girl,  surrounded by the domestic glow of brothers and parents. If people
fantasise about  her, it must be as an elfin sprite, an immortal of love, not a
flesh and blood thing  with the smell of female. She's just too *nice* for
that.... 
</P>
<P>... And, somehow, we find it all fascinating. Then we knock; but she does
not let  us in-a-her window. 
</P>
<P>make it clear that Mr. Cook is just a pathetic lovelorn man who probably has
an  uncaring family and who is probably scared of any woman who is more than
just a  cunt. Is this supposed to be journalism? I almost feel sorry for the
guy... I hope he  can swim -- he's going to have to do a lot of that when the
flood comes...

nessus (Doug Alan) <BR> Subject: Sounds, MM Reviews 1986
</P>
<P>And now for another little look at Kate Bush in the British press....
Curiously  enough, that bozo Richard Cook, who wrote the wretched cover article
on Kate  Bush in Sounds, also wrote this review of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; for
Sounds a short while  back, which was the Single of the Week: 
</P>
<P>A curious choice, and perhaps the winner by default. In this big pile of
records,  the few good shots are content to pick over small pleasures and little
details. This is  the only giant record here, the only one to overreach and
maintain honour. The  rehabilitation of Bush is a bit much: she is still the
sort of girl who pours all her  books and beads into the pot and stirs it up
until you come out with an opera. Most  of her records smell of tarot cards,
kitchen curtains, and lavender pillows to me. But  bits of *Hounds of Love* make
something mischievous or even demonic come out of  he throat, and 'The Big Sky'
is a moment of real mad bravado. It starts like it's  going to be one of the
digital warrior dances Bush puts together when she wants to  be uptempo and then
a whole planet seems to be swirling around her voice. The  best and most
threatening thing that this bizarre talent has ever done. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="mmtbs">This is a review</A> of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; by Stud
Brothers for Melody Maker: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush, like some lithe Russian gymnast who makes even the most difficult
 exercise appear easy, gracefully treads the uneasy tightrope of progression and
 integrity without ever falling into indulgence and elitism. She has in fact,
with her  every release, managed to maintain a uniqueness without ever losing
her public,  something Siouxsie was almost praised for. But unlike The Banshees,
she always  sounds like herself and never sounds the same, and that's a
difficult task. &quot;The Big  Sky&quot; sounds like Kate Bush, but more
importantly, like Hipsway and The Young  Gods, it sounds like 1986. Truly
gymnastic.

1987?
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH'S PSYCHEDELIC PRAYERS 
</P>
<P>As the neo-psychedelic movement continues to gather steam (who would have 
thought that a British trio with a name like The Dream Academy could push an 
enigmatic song like &quot;Life In A Northern Town&quot; into the American top
ten?), I am  becoming more and more troubled by the relatively small boxes these
bands have  constructed to live in. I mean, where is it written that an eighties
psychedelic band  has to utilize the conventions of the sixties psychedelic
bands? And of course, if it is  written somewhere, since when did worthwhile
musicians give a shit about what  someone else thought they should sound like?
Like, the thing that made all those  bands exciting was that they were mining a
new vein. If you study your history, you  will see that the death of New Wave
was its inability to go anywhere with the 64-66  Beatles/Mersey sound that they
were using as a launchpad. Is psychedelia going to  be content to do the same
thing with the 67-69 sound that it is using? Just  wondering. 
</P>
<P>One artist who is never linked with the psychedelic resurgence is Kate Bush.
For  my money, though, her music is organically psychedelic in a way that
totally goes  beyond surface aural appearances. No twelve-strings or jangly
guitars, no Nico or  Mouse vocals, and (My God!) she writes on a piano. But it
isn't style that makes me  think Kate the most psychedelic pop musician alive.
It's the effect of the sound on  my body. 
</P>
<P>Though I think her first album ( The Kick Inside ) is the most holy-ecstatic
 profoundly brain-changing album produced in the last fifteen years, her latest 
album, Hounds of Love is certainly more mature, and perhaps more importantly in 
this society, it is new. It is also the culmination of the efforts she has made
on all the  albums subsequent to the first, and side two makes her last album (
The Dreaming )  completely dispensable (except for those of you who love to
program yourselves into  really bummer realities). 
</P>
<P>Side one is poppy. Songs that work take from the context of the album. But
then  again, if you listen to them, you get deepened. The rhythms and tones put
you in  spaces that usually require meditation or Adam. [that's
3,4-methyldioxymethamphetamine right? Ed.]  And what does she sing about? How
about the  non-spiteful twist on &quot;Positively Fourth Street&quot; in &quot;Running
Up That Hill (A Deal  With God)&quot; - &quot;Is there so much hate for the ones
we love? ... If only I could/I'd  make a deal with God/and I'd get him to swap
our places/Be running up that  road.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; chronicles fear of love, while the singer in &quot;The
Big Sky&quot;  spends all of her time watching; the clouds taking shape,
Ireland, God telling Noah  to build an Ark... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, based on Peter Reich's (I'm Wilhelm Reich's son) A
Book Of  Dreams, closes out side one with a moving account of father/son love
and the societal  forces that destroy that particular relationship. 
</P>
<P>Side two, subtitled &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; utilizes a lot of aural
patterns and tones of  The Dreaming, but to a much different effect. Where that
album was simply a  season in hell, what we've got here is a descent into, and
subsequent ascent out of,  those particular spaces in our consciousness that
seem determined to control us and  make life as ugly as possible. And where the
experience of The Dreaming seemed  merely something any sane individual would
want to avoid, the effect of &quot;The Ninth  Wave&quot; is an understanding of
the importance of utilizing all experience, pleasant and  unpleasant alike, as
opportunities for self-knowledge (is there any other kind?). It is  a bit
harrowing at times, but any trip for knowledge holds out that possibility. &quot;Do
 you know what?&quot; she asks in &quot;The Morning Fog&quot;, &quot;I love you
better now.&quot; And then  she's wrapping it up. &quot;I'll tell my mother/I'll
tell my father/... I'll tell my  brothers/How much I love them.&quot; And who
but the most disaffected wouldn't want  to be able to do that?

Date: Thu, 30 Jul 87 16:11:59 bst <BR> Subject: MM article Dec. 1985
</P>
<P>Unlike those worthy lovehounds IED and MarK T. I have not found any old 
interviews with Kate, so you will have to make do with this piece of archetypal 
Melody Maker writing from Dec. 1985 (author not named), which formed part of 
their review of the year (RUTH was 2nd best single). 
</P>
<P>Apparently adored beyond common reason by the more positively addled 
members of the Maker's legendary critical phalanx, Kate Bush beamed down from 
whatever peculiar orbit of inactivity that had possessed her for the past three
years  to deliver a new single in August. &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was
lush, exotic,  mysterious and almost singlehandedly justified Radio 1's perilous
existence. 
</P>
<P>The success of the single set spines tingling with anticipation for the
inevitable  album, which duly followed in September. Disappointment, however,
was in the air.  &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was unfortunately dogged by the
otherworldly Kate's  determination to extend her musical vocabulary and produce
something impressively  significant. Thus, the second side of the LP was devoted
to an elaborate conceptual  piece, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;. Even her most
ardent critical paramours were forced to  admit that this unwieldy epic
stretched both the patience and credibility of the  listener. [the MM bozos
obviously did not consult any real fans for their opinion -  nbc] &quot;A
blurred metaphysical overview of the meaning of life,&quot; was Colin Irwin's 
[who?] kindly description of a work that took as its principal themes magic,
death,  spiritual existence and reincarnation but failed, eventually, to make
much sense of  anything. 
</P>
<P>Happy enough, however, in her hippy nirvana [Eh!], Kate made plans to
translate  her musical extravaganza in to a full-blown video production, but
with no plans to  take the show on the road, it would come as no overwhelming
surprise to the  committed Bush-observer if she suddenly beamed back out of
sight again. If this  proves to be the case it would leave the multitudes
bewailing her absence and the  hearts of the majority of Maker males cracking
like old bones. 
</P>
<P>Obviously an attempt by someone not very familiar with Kate's work to write
a  &quot;clever&quot; piece but having to resort to all the old cliches and
stereotyped ideas about  her e.g. hippy, sex symbol, otherworldly et cetera. 
</P>
<P>Be seeing you.

(EMI/Parlophone)  probably ought to be here, but it's been bumped by a disk
that's filtering into this  county unofficially: Kate Bush's Hounds of Love on
British EMI. The import, unlike  the American version, was remixed from the
multi-tracks into an entirely new  recording, adding a Mahler-like orchestral
vastness to Bush's folk/art-song  sensibilities (which derive from Delius and
Vaughan Williams). The songs' psychic  intimacy is terrifying amid the
enormously expanded production, and the entire  work is a modern &quot;mystery

</P>
<P>I recently dug up the following minireviews that I copied out of magazines
onto  tiny scraps of paper while standing at newstands back in '85. I don't
think I ever  typed them in and posted them to Love-Hounds. Here they are now --
better late  than never. The first two are reviews of the *Hounds of Love*
album. The rest are  reviews of the &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; single.

<P>Reviews of *Hounds of Love* album... 
</P>
<P><A NAME="shhol">*Smash Hits*, 11-24 Sep 1985</A> 
</P>
<P>If you for a moment imagined that &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was a
fluke, then one  listen to this will put you right. Side one is crammed with
songs that are just as good,  and even side two's ambitious concept piece about
a drowning girl (&quot;The Ninth  Wave&quot;) is surprisingly successful. In
fact, the only possible draw-back is that it's the  sort of record your parents
will probably like too and pinch off you to play. (9 out of  10) -- Chris Heath

<P>Source forgotten -- some British music rag in Sep '85 (No. 1  VM)
</P>
<P>If &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; crept up on you from behind, then
*Hounds of Love*  is an essential purchase. Three years in the making, it's a
haunting collection of  musical images. Each track has been assembled with
loving care and although the  lyrics drift into Hippy Dippy Land, you'd have to
be a supreme cynic to deny the  beauty of the finished product. One for
Marillion fans everywhere. 
</P>
<P>Reviews of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;... 
</P>
<P><A NAME="thehit">*The Hit*, 26 October 1985</A> 
</P>
<P>In pop, Authenticity is what counts. Singing what you want to sing, no
matter  how stupid, instead of pandering to image or fashion. Kate Bush is an
Authentic. An  authentic hippy perhaps, but the public are now so hungry for
that honesty that the  very uncommercial *Hounds of Love* entered the charts at
No. 1, whereas, just  three years before, its equally off-the wall predecessor,
*The Dreaming*, languished  in the cold. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was *Hounds* most obvious single. &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
-- the  story of a man who invents a rain machine -- is blatantly an album
track. Kate's  luscious melodies are underpinned by a strident and remorseless
chop of violins. 
</P>
<P>But in a world of pretend groups like Eighth Wonder, even Kate's most
indulgent  honesty is refreshing. A No. 1. -- Martin Townsend 
</P>
<P><A NAME="shcb">*Smash Hits*, 23 October 1985 - 5 November 1985</A> 
</P>
<P>Kate reminds me of those &quot;astral&quot; acquaintances I used to meet as
a teenager on  camping holidays -- unusual, unpredictable, but with a charm that
always attracted  me. Listen out for the stirring string section, an electric
groove of Navajo red Indian  drums and some British pomp rock. I'm a fan. --
Paul King 
</P>
<P><A NAME="no1cb">*No. 1*, 19 October 1985</A> 
</P>
<P>After the magnificent &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, Kate returns with
another  dreamy breeze of a song. There's chugging strings, that soaring voice
and a  wonderfully evocative melody. Add to that a fascinating story line video
and you've  got another massive hit. Music to swoon by. -- Karen Swayne. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="uncb1">Source forgotten -- some British music rag in Oct '85</A> 
</P>
<P>&quot;Fortress Around Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sting dreams of turtles, Kate dreams of sheep -- call it an early winter,
but both  of these singles make me shiver. Sounding vaguely like Steely Dan,
Sting's lush  escapade combines the obsession/passion of EBYT with snapshots of
war and  devistation. 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the string sextet on &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; will wrap
themselves round your  nervous system and start to beat like a pulse,
irresitibly. Kate's lyrics shift from  harmless observations on weather
conditions to glow in the dark yo-yos and hiding  people from the government.
The video apparently explains it all, but I really think  she does this kind of
thing deliberately, to be honest. 
</P>

<P>Miss Bush's frighteningly intense fans will already know that the second

tune  chockablock with the usual whimsy.

<P><A NAME="holpress">Date: Mon, 26 Feb 90 14:15 PST</A> <BR> From: Dave
Armstrong &lt;8548222@wwu.EDU&gt; <BR> Subject: HoL presskit 
</P>
<P>The following was included in the press kit for the album Hounds Of Love. 
</P>
<P>  KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>HOUNDS OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>Since the last album (THE DREAMING - released towards the end of 1982)  KATE
BUSH has achieved the long-held ambition of designing, building, and  equiping
her own recording studio. Upon its completion, six months of songwriting  was
followed by nearly a year of recording. The result, the album - HOUNDS OF  LOVE,
shows KATE at a new creative peak both musically and lyrically. It also 
displays her increasing prowess as a producer. 
</P>
<P>HOUNDS OF LOVE divides neatly into two seperate sections. Side 1 comprises
of  five tracks including the first single - RUNNING UP THAT HILL (A DEAL WITH 
GOD) - a song about the fundamental differences between the sexes and how these 
differences lead to misunderstanding in relationships. The four remaining songs 
touch on similarly universal themes matching music which surpasses even her 
previous standards of romance, rhythm and power. 
</P>
<P>Side 2 is equally dramatic. It is a conceptual piece entitled THE NINTH
WAVE.  The seven songs combine to tell the story of someone who has been alone
in the  water for some time and who is in danger of drowning. His past, present
and future  manifest themselves in the struggle to keep him awake. 
</P>
<P>The abstract lyrical ideas perfectly complement the atmosphere evoked by the
 music. In many ways this balance has always been inherent in KATE'S work and
the  signs can be traced back to her first album THE KICK INSIDE - which was 
released in 1978, two years after she signed to EMI at the age of 16. 
</P>
<P>That debut contained the atmosphere-laden WUTHERING HEIGHTS which 
introduced KATE to the world and which topped the singles chart for four weeks. 
The hits continued with THE MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS EYES, HAMMER  HORROR and
WOW, the last two taken from the second album - LIONHEART. 
</P>
<P>The next project was KATE'S only tour to date but one which remains a 
milestone in the live presentation of popular music. A dazzling combination of
music,  theatre and dance, she was involved in every aspect of its elaborate
staging from the  choreography and costumes to the lighting and sound. 
</P>
<P>The single BREATHING (released in April, 1980) marked a dramatic departure 
from her previous material, one which was consolidated with the release of the 
album NEVER FOR EVER in the late summer. It crashed into the charts at No. 1 
and spawned two further hit singles, BABOOSHKA and ARMY DREAMERS. 
</P>
<P>With NEVER FOR EVER, KATE was co-producing for the first time and by the 
next album, THE DREAMING (released in September 1982), she had complete 
involvment in the production. With the benefit of hindsight THE DREAMING can  be
seen as having set the scene for HOUNDS OF LOVE, both musically and from a 
production point of view. 
</P>
<P>With the accompanying promotional activities precluding the possibility of 
another tour in the immediate future, KATE is currently working on an idea to 
present Side 2 of HOUNDS OF LOVE through another medium to which she has 
already made a notable contribution - video. This is planned as a visual 
interpretation of THE NINTH WAVE.

<P><A NAME="q">Wendy.Collinson@olsy.co.uk (Collinson, Wendy)</A> <BR>Date: 1
Aug 1997<BR>Subject: HOL Re-Release Reviewed</P>
<P>I was hoping they'd feature this review in their website version but alas
no.  So here it is, the Q Magazine review of the re-release of HOL, entitled: 
KIND, THE MOMENT KATE BUSH JOINED MUSIC'S ARISTOCRACY.</P>
<P>&quot;The early 1980's were not the happiest of times for Kate Bush.
Following the Number 1 success of her third album Never For Ever in 1980, the
reclusive singer, songwriter and producer, amazingly still only 22, took
advantage of her hugely agreeable non-touring arrangement by getting to work on
what - in her mind - would likely prove her masterpiece.</P>
<P>Self-arranged, self-produced, and released in 1982, The Dreaming was an
accomplished and heady affair, bursting with sonic trickery, ambitious
songwriting and a guest slot from Rolf Harris.  The only snag was, it
effectively killed her run of British hits.  Even if her ever-loyal legion of
followers ensured that the album debuted at Number 3, each single pulled from
the album would stiff.  The title track stalled at Number 48.  Its follow-up,
the bank-robbing fantasy, There Goes a Tenner, failed even to register in the
Top 75.</P>
<P>EMI, who seven years before had signed the 15-year-old school girl Catherine
Bush to a recording and publishing deal on the recommendation of Pink Floyd's
Dave Gilmour - for the princely sum of ?3,500 - understandably grew twitchy. 
Particularly since the experimental nature of the Dreaming and its endless hours
of studio time in London's top studios had resulted in her most costly album to
date.  A rethink, it seemed, was drastically necessary.
</P>
<P>Early in 1983, in one of her sporadic missives to her fan club's newsletter,
Bush wrote:  &quot;This year has been very positive so far.  It doesn't have the
same air of doom and gloom that '81 and '82 seemed to hold.  The problem is that
if I don't make an album this year, there will be at least another two-year gap,
and the way business and politics are, it would be a negative situation.  I seem
to have hit another quiet period.  I intend just to keep on writing for the
first part of the year, so yet again I slip away from the eyeball of the media
to my home.</P>
<P>Retreating to here 17th Century farmhouse tucked away in the leafy calm of
Kent, Bush once again turned to the protective bosom of her remarkably
close-knit family, and on her father's advice began to remodel her creative
operation as a cottage industry, outlining the design plans for a
state-of-the-art 48-track studio to be built in the barn.  Even if there was a
certain sense of urgency surrounding this fifth album, Kate Bush had clearly
grown weary of watching the studio clock as it ticked off anything up to ?100 an
hour.  As it turned out, the dreaded two-year gap would come to pass, and in her
prolonged absence there were dark mutterings that the publicly svelte, dance-fit
songstress had begun bingeing on junk food and ballooned to an elephantine 18
stone.</P>
<P>The truth, however, was somewhat less dramatic.  Already carrying a
reputation as an artist with a temperamental muse, Kate Bush had spent much of
this time re-organising her working methods.  Past albums had been written on
piano and then arranged during the laborious studio stints.  Now, with her
expensive acquisition of the Fairlight - that Rolls-Royce of '80's sampling
technology - she was composing directly onto hard disk and master tape.  Having
been something of a production pioneer in her Floyd-like treatment of the stereo
spectrum as a broad, blank musical canvas (a helicopter sample appears &quot;by
kind permission of Pink Floyd/&quot;The Wall&quot;), from now on her songwriting
and keen attention to aural detail would work in tandem, with many of the
elements of the original demo sketches for Hounds of Love making it all the way.</P>
<P>Seeking a closeted, intimate atmosphere in her workplace, most of the
sessions involved only Bush, her long-time beau and bassist Del Palmer and an
engineer.  And although there would be a lengthy procession of musicians through
the studio during the album's leisurely recording period, it was perhaps this
sense of intimacy that helped the peak-and-trough mood shifts of Hounds of Love
seem all the more convincing and emotive.</P>
<P>Tellingly, when a change of location was required to break up the sessions,
the unit decamped to Dublin, a city which unarguably favours the slow-lane
approach.  Most of the lyrics were written here, so it's perhaps significant
that in this deceptively peaceful setting, Kate Bush's head was burning with
thoughts of &quot;a crowd rioting inside&quot;, of persecution and possession,
of being hunted and haunted.  At some points, the atmosphere is claustrophobic
and suffocating.  At others, it's manic and euphoric.
</P>
<P>For the most part, time has been kind to Hounds of Love.  Only the clanking,
robotic omnipresence of Palmer's Linn drum machine (the pulse of ever
over-produced record of its decade) dates the sound, its size tens trampling all
over the insistent opener Running Up that Hill (A Deal with God).  Overall
though, the album's use of a pristinely recorded array of acoustic instruments -
the woody warmth of Danny Thompson's double bass, the clipped precision of the
Medicci Sextet, with many balalaikas, bodhrans and bouzoukis besides - lends it
a certain timelessness.  On top of this, Bush's wonderfully expressive vocals,
whether in breathy close-up, or heavily effected and cooing, or shrieking in the
background, serve to provide the focus, even if they remain too
characteristically mannered for some tastes.</P>
<P>Side 1, in the old money - titled Hounds of Love - resides firmly in the pop
camp, and four of its five tracks, save the hushed balladry of Mother Stands for
Comfort, became singles.  But this, musically and lyrically, is surely some of
the most obtuse pop music to have graced a chart rundown:  the taut industrial
rhythms and nightmarish, moonlit chase of the title track; the hyperventilating
highs and driving, thunderous bass (provided by Killing Joke's Youth) in The Big
Sky.
</P>
<P>And then, of course, there's Cloudbusting - not by an stretch of imagination
the stuff of the typical pop single.  For a start, its inspiration lay in A Book
of Dreams, the childhood memories of Peter Reich, son of socialist Austrian
psychologist Wilhelm &quot;The Function of the Orgasm&quot; Reich, who believed
that with his invention, The Orgone Accumulator, he could alter the earth's
climate and create rain on command.  For the song's suitably cinematic video, in
which Reich is eventually arrested by US authorities for transporting his
contraption over state lines, Donald Sutherland played the scientist and Bush,
in boyish drag, his son, adding knowing twist to the closing refrain of &quot;Your
son's coming out&quot;.  More remarkably, by this point Bush's commercial
fortunes had turned.  In October, 1985, Cloudbusting went straight into the Top
20 and Top of the Pops screened the strange promo in its entirety.
</P>
<P>Even the six extra tracks included on this reissue (as part of EMI's
centenary celebrations; there's also a useless free EMI booklet) suggest that
Kate Bush was on something of a creative roll during this time. Remixes of
Running Up That Hill and The Big Sky betray a perhaps harebrained marketing plot
to make Bush's records a big hit in discos. Be kind to My Mistakes, a soundtrack
contribution to Nic Roeg's Castaway is filmic in a meandering way, while Under
the Ivy and Burning Bridge, both album offcuts, were quite probably only left on
the cutting-room floor owing to vinyl album length.</P>
<P>And that length, undoubtedly, is down to The Ninth Wave, the ominously
conceptual song cycle that swallowed up the original Side 2.  The recurring
theme - water - finds our narrator falling into a gentle sleep to Radio 4's
shipping forecast ) And Dream Of Sheep), only to wake up scratching at the
underbelly of a frozen lake (the frantic Under Ice), and being drowned as a
witch (*the frighteningly demonic Waking the Witch).  En route, she becomes a
communication-frustrated ghost (the mumbled Watching You Without Me), before
eventually waking or being reborn (The Morning Fog), depending on which way you
interpret it. What's more, aside from the heavy-handed traditional Irish passage
Jig of Life (featuring the spoken poetry of brother John Carder Bush), it
actually works, even with the heavy brogue of Robbie Coltrane sharply
interrupting the proceedings.</P>
<P>Against all reasonable odds, Hounds of Love proved an enormous artistic and
commercial success for Kate Bush, even reaching Number 30 in America.  Its
follow-ups, the Sensual World (disappointing) and The Red Shoes (had its
moments) would reveal a horrible truth.  Kate Bush would always have her work
cut out to top this. &quot;</P>
<P>Reviewer:   Tom Doyle.
<BR>Rating:  ***** (Top &quot;Q&quot; rating:  Indispensable.  Truly
exceptional.)</P>
<P>There is also a review of Maxwell's Unplugged album, making reference to his
&quot;quiveringly beautiful cover of Kate Bush's This Woman's Work&quot;.  The
review accords Maxwell four stars and considers him a &quot;virtuoso in the
making&quot;.</P>
<P>Also a short article about Paula Cole:  &quot;After replacing Sinead
O'Connor on Peter Gabriel's 10-month Secret World Tour in 1995, Cole returned to
Massachusetts to work on This Fire, which combines the drama of Kate Bush with
the esoteric musing of Tori Amos.&quot;</P>

1995 23:29:28 -0500 <BR> Subject: This week in 1986... by Ian Dooley 
</P>
<P>Dear Friends: 
</P>
<P>The following piece was sent by a British penfriend. It was written by Ian
Dooley,  and was not identified as to source. Perhaps a fellow Brit love-hound
could fill me in  on this point. I will in any event obtain the relevant info
within the month. IED and  Chris Williams will doubtless have a field day
picking apart the various inaccuracies  in the piece, but I've taken a
non-judgmental approach in posting the following item  for general consumption.

</P>
<P>Enjoy!--Chris B. 
</P>
<P>This week in 1986 
</P>
<P>At No. 12 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH--Hounds of Love 
</P>
<P> Following the critical mauling and disappointing sales returns for her
fourth  album The Dreaming (1982), Kate Bush was ready to quit the music
business. 
</P>
<P>But after a six month sabbatical, she returned to the fray, initially by
upgrading  the home studio at the South London farmhouse she shared with
longtime  boyfriend/backing musician Del Palmer. 
</P>
<P>Shortly afterwards she began work on Hounds of Love, utilising the 
rhythm-based writing structure she'd developed after working with Peter Gabriel.

</P>
<P>Given Kate's perfectionist attitude, progress was slow. It wasn't unusual
for her  to record up to six slightly different vocal tracks or create string
arrangements on a  Fairlight synthesiser only to replace them with 'real'
strings on a final take. Even  the sound of waves between And Dream Of Sheep and
Under Ice had to be  recorded repeatedly because EMI's FX library didn't have
'the right kind of sea.' 
</P>
<P>Much of Kate's lyrical inspiration came from books and films. The title
track was  contrived from the 1957 horror movie, Night Of Demons, Cloudbusting
from Peter  Reich's novel about his inventor father and the decidedly
unfashionable 'concept'  track, The Ninth Wave, was based on a surrealist
painting called The Hogsmith  Ophelia which depicts a doll drowning in the sea.

</P>
<P>On 5 September 1985, Hounds Of Love was launched with a party at the 
Planetarium in London. Seven days later, it debuted at Number One where it
stayed  for the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>Despite record company opposition, Running Up That Hill was chosen as the
first  single cull. In Britain, it would hit No 3 to become Kate's second
biggest- selling  single behind Wuthering Heights. The song's orignal title,
Deal With God, had been  jettisoned because of anticipated problems in countries
such as America, Spain and  Italy. Ironically, the song would give Kate her
highest US chart position to date--No  30. 
</P>
<P>Further lifts, Hounds Of Love, The Big Sky and Cloudbusting would also make 
the UK Top 40. The latter named track also boasted an excellent promo which 
featured Donald Sutherland and was later ingenuously sampled by the Utah
Stints...
