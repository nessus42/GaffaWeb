by Jason Cowley<br>
February 7, 2005<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>With her first single up for a Brit Award and a new album 
soon to be released, Kate Bush is back in a big way. It's been a long wait, 
writes Jason Cowley, but she's worth it.</i></p>
<p>When I mentioned at a recent New Statesman editorial conference that I wanted 
to write about Kate Bush, who is preparing to release her first album for 12 
years, colleagues responded with a mixture of incredulity and awe. The 
incredulous still associated her with a single song, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, her 
first. Inspired by her teenage reading of Emily Bronte's great and rather 
sinister novel about unfulfilled love, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; must be one of the 
strangest songs ever to reach number one, as it did in 1978. Nobody who has 
heard Bush's wailing falsetto on that song, and its chorus of &quot;Heathcliff, it's 
me, Cathy/I've come home&quot;, is likely to forget it. Nor is it any easier to 
forget her eccentric rendering of the song on Top of the Pops: with her thick, 
hennaed hair flowing wildly, as if she were running straight into a wind 
machine, she performed in a kind of rapture. Bush was 19 at the time and, a 
former student of dance and mime, desperately sincere. </p>
<p>The awed among my colleagues, who were all women, knew Bush for the complex 
and remarkable artist that she is, perhaps the most singular and talented female 
singer-songwriter and composer of her generation (she is now 46). There is no 
one quite like her. Without Kate Bush, there could have been no Madonna or Bjork, 
certainly in the guises--tough, independent, eccentric, committed, daring--that 
we know them. </p>
<p>Bush's career began one afternoon in the mid-1970s when David Gilmour of Pink 
Floyd received a demo tape from a young girl. He liked what he heard, but 
thought the recording quality of the songs was poor. &quot;The demo was not 
saleable,&quot; Gilmour told me when we spoke. &quot;The songs were too idiosyncratic: 
just Kate, this little schoolgirl who was maybe 15, singing away over a piano. 
You needed decent ears to hear the potential and I didn't think there were many 
people with those working in record companies. But I was convinced from the 
beginning that this girl had remarkable talent.&quot; Gilmour invited Bush to a 
recording studio and helped to record some more demos, which were produced by 
his friend Andrew Powell. They selected three songs, one of which was &quot;The Man 
With the Child in His Eyes&quot;, and took them to EMI. &quot;They signed her up,&quot; he 
says. She was on her way. </p>
<p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] </p>
<p>As an artist--and certainly as the interval between each new album lengthens 
exponentially--Bush occupies an ambiguous space between pop and the avant-garde, 
simultaneously working within and against the constraints of the pop song. She 
writes songs with choruses and tight, melodic structures while never abandoning 
her will to experiment: with form, with sampling technology, with unexpected 
instruments--a didgeridoo, uillean pipes, a mandolin--or with the texture and 
tone of her own voice, which can be at once a deep and disconcertingly powerful 
force and something far softer and more graceful. </p>
<p>As a songwriter, she can be opaque; her songs are often expressions of mood 
and feeling, often sexual feeling. She can write small, self-contained 
narratives, capsule stories such as &quot;Babooshka&quot; (about a husband who begins to 
receive seductive letters from an anonymous woman whom he discovers too late is 
his wife) or &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; (about a lonely man who becomes addicted to 
his computer). She writes well about childhood and memory, but she can also be 
fey and hippyishly winsome: the titles alone of songs such as &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, 
&quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; offer a flavour of her &quot;hey, man&quot; sensibility. She 
draws inspiration from Irish folk music, from literature (&quot;The Sensual World&quot;, 
with its ecstatic whispered cry of &quot;Yes&quot;, is based on Molly Bloom's long, 
flowing soliloquy that ends Ulysses) and from film (the title track of The Red 
Shoes, not one of her best albums, was inspired by the Powell and Pressburger 
movie of the same name). And she sometimes even writes genuine protest 
songs--&quot;Breathing&quot; is about the nuclear threat, &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; is a fine 
anti-war song, and &quot;Dreaming&quot; is about the white settlers' murderous 
exploitation of Aborigines and their land. </p>
<p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] </p>
<p>What has Kate Bush been doing since the release of The Red Shoes in 1993? 
What does she do when she is not working obsessively in the studio? What is she 
like? The mystery of Kate Bush is her essential unknowability--to outside 
observers, at least. Many years ago, she retreated into semi-reclusivity, 
reluctant to be interviewed or appear on television, never touring. There were 
rumours of her exhaustion and her hurt. Too much that was wounding had been 
written about her; she had been gossiped about and teased too much. For a period 
from the late Seventies to the early Eighties, there was scarcely a television 
comedian, from Kenny Everett to the foolish Eddie Large, who did not hesitate to 
ridicule Bush, especially her near-hysterical performance of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; 
on Top of the Pops. </p>
<p>I recall watching her being interviewed on BBC2's Old Grey Whistle Test, one 
evening in 1985, I think, some time after the release of her best album, Hounds 
of Love. Her interviewers were sympathetic and evidently admired her, but it was 
still excruciating to watch as this then young, tentative woman, with her quiet, 
slightly lisping voice, who was so powerful and controlling in the studio yet so 
vulnerable away from it, submitted to a process that she clearly found intensely 
uncomfortable. It was increasingly clear that she wished only to speak through 
and be known by her work. </p>
<p>This was the beginning of her long period of withdrawal, during which she 
released only the disappointing Red Shoes. Her obsessive fans, the energetically 
self-styled Love-Hounds (log on to www.gaffa.org), became more and more restless 
for news about her. &quot;I think creative control is so incredibly important,&quot; she 
has said. &quot;I've always been tenacious when it comes to my work and I became 
quickly aware of the outside pressures of being famous affecting my work. It 
seemed ironic that I was expected to do interviews and television which took me 
away from my work. It was no longer relevant that I wrote songs.&quot; </p>
<p>Born in Kent in 1958, Kate Bush is the daughter of an English doctor father 
and an Irish mother. She grew up in a musical family: her mother sang, her 
father played piano and her elder brothers were both musicians (one of them, 
Paddy Bush, is among her most trusted collaborators). She began writing and 
recording songs as a young teenager, and by the time she met Gilmour she knew 
exactly what she wanted to do and how to do it. &quot;When I first met Kate, she was 
this shy little schoolgirl, but very quickly you could see that she would have 
arguments with producers if they did not do things the way she wanted them to,&quot; 
Gilmour recalls. </p>
<p>When her first single reached number one--much to the delighted surprise of 
EMI--Bush was liberated into privilege, and she has long had the kind of 
creative freedom to write and produce her own material that few recording 
artists are allowed. &quot;Kate is a complete one-off,&quot; Gilmour says. &quot;I can't think 
of anyone like her. Joni Mitchell was also a one-off, an original, but Kate is 
nothing like that. We need more people like her, especially as so much music 
amounts to little more than formulaic copying of genres. Those who have followed 
in her shadow are but pale imitations.&quot; </p>
<p>Today Kate Bush lives with her partner, the musician Danny McIntosh, in what 
her friends like to call the &quot;countryside&quot;, but which is in fact a semi-rural 
location somewhere near Reading, where she has a home studio. She is a 
mother--her son, Bertie, was born in 1999--and, after many years of preparation, 
she is very close to completing her as yet untitled new album. But not even EMI 
knows exactly when or exactly what she will deliver. &quot;It's coming soon,&quot; was all 
that I was told. </p>
<p>In a recent novel called Waiting for Kate Bush, John Mendelssohn wrote 
wittily about her mystery and allure--and of how that mystery has only been 
exacerbated as the wait for each new album has grown longer and longer. The wait 
is almost over. </p>

<br>
I FIRST heard her in the late Seventies when I was living in Cyprus. My uncle 
had returned from a trip to London with a video of a British documentary about 
Abba, and Kate Bush was the guest star. She stuck in my mind for years after, 
and when I came to London - at about 12 - I started to buy her records. <br>
<br>
The first thing I bought, in the early Eighties, was the single from her Hounds 
of Love album, and then I started to rewind and buy all her old stuff - I think 
I've got everything now. Everybody just associates her with &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
I'm not really into her very commercial stuff, I'm more into the songs that most 
people don't know about, like &quot;The Ninth Way&quot;, which is a masterpiece, really.
<br>
<br>
I thought she was this amazing person that in some ways I could relate to. I 
felt that the work was such a bridge between fantasy and reality, and there was 
so much spirit in it. I just wanted to know everything about her work. I didn't 
become interested in her in that typical fan way; I didn't ever buy books about 
her, I was more interested in her as an artist and almost as a poet, rather than 
in a poppy &quot;Oh I'm a fan, I want to put her picture up on my wall&quot; way.<br>
<br>
To me, she's an emotional thinker, she's somebody who made her emotions real 
through the music. There were so many references to emotions and to failure and 
to the good and the bad, your relationship to nature, and your relationship to 
other people and I just felt it was so much richer than most stuff that was 
happening at the time. <br>
<br>
When I hear the music it makes me think that everything around me is wonderful. 
At times it's like almost like hearing a prayer, at other times it's like 
lunacy, and other times it's just incredible engineering. In my view she 
deserves a lot more credit, but maybe the fact that she didn't become too 
mainstream has made her remain more special. <br>
<br>
And although she has a gorgeous voice what really struck me was the way she used 
it and the way it worked with other instruments. It animated everything else. 
She used these Bulgarian folk musicians on one of her albums, and then, later, I 
found some Bulgarian singers and used them for one of my shows, the one called &quot;Afterwords&quot;, 
where I had the seats turned into suitcases, and the table into a skirt. <br>
<br>
I listen to her music a lot when I'm working because I find that I know it so 
well that I don't need to think about it, but it does heighten my spirit. And 
yeah, of course I sing along, who doesn't? But she's not the easiest person to 
sing along with, so I sort of hum to it. <br>
<br>
She's a heroine for me because she's never cared too much about public opinion. 
She's done her own thing and I think that in her heart she knows that she did 
well, up to a point. She was very experimental and before her time, and I think 
that can set an example for visual people like myself. I'm not saying that I 
based my career on her, but she inspired me to do my own thing and achieve 
something. <br>
<br>
I think she was one of the first artists that made a connection between her 
visual work and her music. And then came Grace Jones, and then Madonna, and then 
Bjork. I think it became like a world, the ultimate Kate Bush world, where you 
heard the sound, and then you looked at the videos and the imagery that went 
with it. That's why I found it so convincing, because I felt like there was this 
genuine passion for ideas. <br>
<br>
I'm not easily impressed. But she did with music what other people have done 
with writing. It's incredibly inventive and forward- thinking. I always wanted 
my work to have that level of openness. <br>
<br>
I did write to her once, about 10 years ago. I was doing this project about 
women's roles in fairy tales. I really wanted her to get involved, although I 
didn't know how and I was much more audacious at that time about approaching 
people. I got a long message on my answering machine from her manager, saying 
&quot;Oh, Kate read your letter, blah blah, but Kate already has a designer who she 
works with.&quot; And I thought, &quot;Hang on a minute! I never meant to say I wanted to 
design for you, I wanted to involve you in the project.&quot; But, you know, I think 
in just writing the letter to her, it helped me articulate my ideas for myself.</p>

<p><b><a name="guardian01">After 12 years of silence Kate Bush is back </a></b>
<br>
The Guardian<br>

September 28, 2005 <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is one of the most reclusive figures in the music business, but next 
month Kate Bush will break more than a decade of silence by releasing a new 
single, followed by her first album for 12 years. Bush, 47, will make up for 
lost time by unveiling a double album, Aerial, on November 7. Her single, King 
of the Mountain, was made available for download yesterday, but only in the US 
and Canada. Her record company, EMI, said it would be available online to 
British fans by the end of the week. The CD single is released in the shops on 
October 24. </p>
<p>Long gaps between albums are the stuff of legend in music. Stevie Wonder fans 
are waiting for A Time 2 Love, his first studio album in 10 years, while Guns N' 
Roses are still promising fans they will put out their new album next year, a 
mere 15 years after their last original recording. Bush's long absence from the 
charts has only heightened the mystique surrounding the publicity-shy singer 
since her debut, Wuthering Heights, in 1978, the first solo No 1 hit written by 
a British woman. The silence since her last album, Red Shoes, in 1993, has even 
inspired a novel, Waiting for Kate Bush, by John Mendelssohn, about a fan 
postponing his suicide so he could hear her new record. </p>
<p>Bush, who lives on an island in the Thames in Berkshire and recently bought a 
clifftop home in south Devon, has been so protective of her privacy that the 
media did not know she had become a mother for 18 months. Her son, Bertie, now 
seven, provided the drawing of a king on a mountain for the sleeve of her new 
single. </p>
<p>&quot;I don't really know why it took so long, other than she took a break, had 
her child and was getting on with life,&quot; an EMI spokesman said. </p>
<p>Bush has proved extremely influential for artists from Madonna to Björk, and 
even indie rock bands including the Futureheads, who this year had a hit with a 
cover version of Bush's Hounds of Love.</p>

<p>The Guardian<br>
by Patrick Barkham <br>
September 28, 2005 <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When Kate Bush materialised with a wail, a waft of huge hair and the startling 
melodrama of her first single, Wuthering Heights, the teenage daughter of a 
doctor from Kent could have hardly made a bigger or odder impression against a 
backdrop of angry young men in punk bands. Nearly 28 years on, the country is 
again awash with angular guitar bands, and Bush, a 47-year-old mother of one, is 
preparing to break 12 years of silence and release her eighth studio recording. 
While Aerial, a double album described as &quot;properly, properly eccentric&quot; by one 
critic, won't have quite the same shock value, many in the music industry 
believe it will have as much resonance as ever.</p>
    <p>Twelve years without producing a record would be a catastrophe for most 
    popular artists - and their record companies. But the allure of Bush has 
    only increased since her retreat from public view after 1993's The Red 
    Shoes. The twilight imagery of her songs chimes perfectly with the mystery 
    of her personal life. When she gave birth to a son, Bertie, she saw no 
    reason to announce it, and the press did not find out for 18 months. 
    Frustrated by her refusal to play the celebrity game, tabloids have compared 
    her to Greta Garbo and Miss Havisham, suggesting she is obsessed with her 
    privacy. The title of one of her new songs: How to be Invisible.<br>
    EMI, her record company, says suggestions she is a tortured recluse are 
    nonsense. &quot;I'm a quiet, private person who has managed to hang around for a 
    few years,&quot; she said recently, with characteristic understatement. Spotted 
    by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, Bush was just 16 when she signed a £5,000 
    deal with EMI. In contrast to today's production line of adolescent 
    superstars, executives felt she was too young for fame and let the teenager 
    quietly compose, study dance and play the odd pub in south London. Their 
    patience paid off: she became the first female British artist to reach 
    number one with a self-penned song in 1978. From The Dreaming to The Sensual 
    World, she matched esoteric and playful innovation with commercial success. 
    Bush is estimated to be worth £25m, the second wealthiest British female 
    solo artist after Annie Lennox. </p>
    <p>EMI has been equally patient with Bush in middle age. She has recorded 
    Aerial on and off for six years. &quot;Kate's one of those artists who records 
    and makes music to her own timescale rather than meet a record company's 
    deadlines, which is fine by us,&quot; said an EMI insider, with no hint of 
    gritted teeth. </p>
    <p>Contrary to reports, Bush will go on television to actively promote 
    Aerial, released on November 7 between new offerings from Robbie Williams 
    and Madonna. Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, believes a comparison with 
    Madonna is instructive. Both women are 47, both have played totally by their 
    own rules, but their careers could not be more contrasting. &quot;There's nothing 
    left that you don't know about Madonna whereas with Kate Bush there is 
    everything left to know,&quot; he said. &quot;She's retained that sense of enigma. We 
    don't really know what has gone on in her life in the last 12 years. That's 
    the key to her longevity. There's a lot held back.&quot; </p>
    <p>The extraordinary voice of singer-songwriter Roy Harper was one of Bush's 
    formative influences and he collaborated with her in the 1980s and 1990s and 
    is still a friend. He believes Bush has been more influenced by literary 
    writers than songwriters. &quot;She is lovely to work with, a true musician. 
    There is no need to tell her what to do, she has already done it and she is 
    ahead, making suggestions. She is very honest and very gentle, bright and 
    full of creativity, the kind of girl you should've married, really. She is 
    very private and family orientated now. When you are that good a person, the 
    danger is that everybody takes the piss. The cure for that is to keep 
    yourself out of the public eye.&quot; </p>
    <p>Those who have heard Aerial are, typically, amazed and slightly baffled, 
    with Bush addressing a pigeon on one of the two albums, said to be inspired 
    by bird song. Bush told Harper that one was a concept album and, &quot;to lessen 
    the blow&quot; the other was &quot;just Kate songs&quot;. </p>
    <p>Firmly in control of her career, it is ironic that by complete chance 
    2005 has turned out to be the perfect year to craft a comeback. She has 
    always enjoyed the praise of her peers but a raft of up-and-coming bands are 
    inspired by her, from Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons to The 
    Futureheads, whose cover version of Hounds of Love was a bigger hit than 
    Bush's. Harper ranks her alongside Tracey Emin and Germaine Greer as &quot;a 
    teacher&quot;, although &quot;a rather more gentle woman than a lot of teachers&quot;. </p>
    <p>Bush has been ahead of her time, with dramatic videos in the 1970s and 
    singing about seeking solace in computers in the 1980s, but mostly she has 
    been in her own time, working to her own timescale. With the cycle turning 
    in her direction, her moment may have come again. </p>

<p>King Of The Mountain - Kate Bush </p>
<p>This is a reminder of what we have been missing with Kate Bush's absence.Tori 
Amos, Bjork and others have attempted to eclipse Bush's otherworldliness, 
musicality and sheer weirdness, but none has come close and King Of The Mountain 
shows why. </p>
<p>It's a brooding epic which begins with an ominous guitar riff before that 
instantly recognisable voice charges in. &quot;Could you see the aisles of women? 
Could you see them screaming and weeping?&quot; she asks. </p>
<p>As ever, she is too subtle a writer to offer answers to who the king is and 
where his mountain might be, but there are references to Elvis (Presley?) and 
Rosebud, the talismanic sledge in Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. </p>
<p>The allegorical lyrical mystery makes her music more alluring. Bush was 
always a uniquely physical writer, but the more this song progresses, the more 
she sounds buffeted by the elements atop a frozen mountain. Gales howl around 
her before she concludes: &quot;The wind, it blows the door closed.&quot; It is not easy 
listening, but it is a landmark work. I can't wait for Aerial. </p>

Evening Standard<br>

September 27, 2005</p>
<p>Pop music recluse Kate Bush returns to the limelight today with her first 
single in more than 12 years. </p>
<p>But her comeback song, King Of The Mountain, is only available via the 
internet in America and Canada and will not be released in Britain and the rest 
of the world until 24 October. </p>
<p>The singer, 46, whose last release was The Red Shoes in 1993, has not planned 
a supporting tour or promotional appearances. Her one and only tour was in 1979.
</p>
<p>Bush decided to vanish from public gaze after her eerie ballad Wuthering 
Heights reached No1 in 1978 and her promotion of her debut album, The Kick 
Inside, was so successful that she was pressed the same year for the follow-up 
release, Lionheart. </p>
<p>&quot;They took me away from everything familiar and, four months later, wanted 
another record,&quot; she later said. &quot;I figured out then that music was a priority, 
not publicity. And that completely changed my life. I stopped doing all the 
things that were expected.&quot; </p>
<p>Bush, who earns an estimated Â£1million a year in royalties, shares a house 
in woodland on a small island on the Thames near Theale, Berkshire, with her 
partner, musician Danny McIntosh, 49. Her studio is in the grounds. Earlier this 
year, they bought a remote house in Devon with 17 acres and its own beach for Â£2.5 
million. </p>
<p>She is protected by friends, including Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour and 
ex-Genesis singer Peter Gabriel, and kept the birth of her son Bertie, now six, 
secret for 18 months. </p>
<p>It is one of Bertie's drawings which graces the cover of King Of The 
Mountain. The single will be followed by a double album, Aerial, on 8 November.

  Daily Mirror<br>
  by Gavin Martin Mirror Music Critic<br>
  September 29, 2005<p>
  <b>It's taken 12yrs but Kate's back at her best</b><br>
  <br>
  Kate Bush , the most reclusive female star since Garbo, is back with her first 
  single for more than a decade.</p>
  <p>And from the atmospheric opening to its last eerie gasp, King of the 
  Mountain is unmistakably the sound of one of pop music's last great originals.<br>
  </p>
  <p>It is 12 years since her last release - a lifetime in pop history - but the 
  lay-off doesn't seem to have spoiled the patented Bush sound.<br>
  </p>
  <p>But then with a sound as singular as that which Kate has patented, radical 
  surgery isn't necessary to stay ahead of the curve. In recent years her back 
  catalogue has provided many contemporary acts with rich pickings.<br>
  </p>
  <p>And like some sonic sorceress locked away in her private lair Bush carries 
  on from where she left off with The Red Shoes in 1992. King of the Mountain, 
  the first release from forthcoming album Aerial, comes in a sleeve drawn by 
  her seven-year-old son Bertie and introduces Kate to a new generation.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Young fans may be surprised to hear that at 47 Kate, the musical force that 
  inspired the likes of PJ Harvey, Goldfrapp and Outcast, is still going strong.<br>
  </p>
  <p>But any thoughts that Bush is relishing a return to rough and tumble of 
  celebrity life, or is preparing to tackle the pop world on its own terms, are 
  cast aside by song itself. Lyrically, with an oblique reference to Orson 
  Welles' classic movie Citizen Kane and to Elvis Presley, it is Kate's 
  meditation on the perils of fame and power.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Elvis are you out there somewhere<br>
  Looking like a happy Man?<br>
  In the snow with rosebud<br>
  And King of the Mountain<br>
  </p>
  <p>Technology has allowed her to deepen and enrich the territory explored on 
  her Wuthering Heights debut single back in 1978. Long-time fans will recognise 
  the wildly romantic and foreboding landscape the song creates. She sings of 
  &quot;the wind blowing through the house&quot; as if the outside world is calling her 
  back to the limelight.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Her mixed feelings for wealth and fame come through in lines such as: Why 
  does a multi-millionaire, fill up his home with priceless junk?<br>
  </p>
  <p>The mood of the record is a masterful balance of opposites - cool reserve 
  and sonic boldness, gothic gloom and sensual awakening. Oriental percussion, 
  ghostly harmonies, synthesisers that whisper and howl accompany Kate's fraught 
  but tender vocals.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Fittingly for a woman who has taken so long to make a comeback there is no 
  hurry to reach a climax. King of the Mountain builds slowly and it is the 
  entrance of a grimy low-slung offbeat reggae guitar provides the cue for the 
  band to slowly come together.<br>
  </p>
  <p>When they do so it is like they are making music in a dream, while wading 
  through a field of honey.<br>
  </p>
  <p>It is the sort of effect musicians used to take drugs to attain. But Kate's 
  talent can capture it simply by going deep into her own creative whirlpool.<br>
  </p>
  <p>While never reaching the lofty peaks of Running Up That Hill (what could, 
  short of Elvis jamming with Hendrix?) it is a sound and a song well in keeping 
  with Kate's image as the painfully-shy reclusive superstar. Magnificent.<br>
  </p>

<p><b><a name="irishtimes01">Can Bush scale the heights</a></b><br>
The Irish Times<br>
by Jim Carroll<br>
September 30, 2005 </p>
<p>Get ready to say goodbye to all of that. On November 7th, Kate Bush will end 
12 years of enigmas, mystique, intrigue, mystery, daft conspiracy theories and 
headlines involving Wuthering Heights puns by releasing a new album. </p>
<p>For Bush fans, Aerial will probably be the most significant release of the 
year. For the music industry, it's yet another high-profile event release in the 
run-up to the December razzmatazz when sales all round go through the roof. For 
many others, it will be just another new album in the shops with all the 
attendant fuss that comes with a big release. </p>
<p>For Kate Bush, though, November 7th is hugely significant. For the first time 
since 1993, she will wake up to the knowledge that there's a new album in the 
shops (and stocked high in those all-important online stores which were not a 
retail factor the last time around). Now, everyone else will have the 
opportunity to judge what she's been quietly working on for the past few years.
</p>
<p>Any musical hesitation, deviation or repetition will be highlighted. 
Ridiculous theories will be put forward about the cover artwork. Ludicrous 
meanings will be applied to her lyrics. Internet message boards will hum with 
activity. Bush could be forgiven for going right back to bed, turning off the 
radio and pulling the duvet over her head. </p>
<p>The release of Aerial may well be a Rip Van Winkle moment for Bush. After 
all, since The Red Shoes more than a decade ago, the music industry has 
completely flipped the script on how it operates. For a start, you can be sure 
that Bush and her advisors have had at least half-a-dozen ringtone conversations 
with the technology whizzkids, even if it's highly unlikely that her target 
audience would be in the market for such trinkets. Technology now calls the 
tune, whether the artist likes it or not. </p>
<p>Yet Bush continues to buck other trends. Acts who were once f&#281;ted, acclaimed 
and allowed long gaps between records to come up with new tunes are no longer so 
readily tolerated. There's absolutely no chance most artists would be allowed to 
spend 12 years creatively twiddling their thumbs while still under contract to a 
major music company. Long-term development of an act is very much a thing of the 
past as well, except in extremely rare cases and usually only when the act is 
signed to a US label, where there seems to be slightly more patience for the 
task. </p>
<p>But even new labels such as Sanctuary, boasting business models which 
involved signing established acts cast aside by other companies under the 
&quot;distressed inventory&quot; heading, have run into difficulties. Signing such 
heritage acts as The Blue Nile and Morrissey may add to a label's credibility, 
but recent profit warnings show there's not that much money to be made from 
these old codgers any more. After all, if there was, those acts would still be 
in the embrace of major labels. </p>
<p>For all this, the release of a Bush album is welcome because it will be the 
music rather than some spurious spinning which has the most impact. As with 
Kraftwerk, Bush is an artist whose stock has continued to rise in direct 
proportion to the length of time she has remained away from the release 
schedules. Absence really does make the heart grow fonder. </p>
<p>However, this album also needs to reach more than just the faithful, and it 
will be interesting to observe how EMI Records will go about this. It's unlikely 
that the artist will give up several weeks for pan-international telephone 
interviews with unwashed hacks, yet the thought of Kate Bush on the TV trail, 
going from Richard &amp; Judy to Jonathan Ross, is probably just as unappealing. </p>
<p>Yet, as everyone from Coldplay and Robbie Williams to Richard Ashcroft and 
even Kraftwerk has found out with recent releases, you can't just sell new 
albums by sitting on your laurels and pointing to your back-pages. Watching Bush 
responding to these new realities may well prove fascinating. </p>

<br>
</b></font>Scotland on Sunday<br>
by Nigel Williamson<br>
October 2, 2005<br>
</p>
<p>'KATE Bush still alive,&quot; read the headline on one over-excited report 
following the announcement that the reclusive singer is to release her first 
album of new songs in 12 years. &quot;She's back&quot; announced BBC Radio Four's new 
programme PM, between discussions of the Labour Party conference and the Tory 
leadership contest. </p>
<p>The imminent comeback of the child-woman with the other-worldly voice who 
first shocked and then seduced us with the remarkable 'Wuthering Heights' back 
in 1978, is generating unprecedented levels of anticipation. Never can so much 
have been written about a record that few outside her closest circle and her 
record company's boardroom have yet heard.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Bush's re-emergence comes after one of pop's lengthiest periods of 
self-imposed silence. Add to that the fact that she hasn't toured since 1979, 
and it is possible that there is a new generation of record-buyers and 
concert-goers to whom her name means little. </p>
<p>The extraordinary effect that Bush has on people was never more apparent than 
on the occasion three years ago when she and former Sex Pistol John Lydon 
(formerly Rotten) found themselves unlikely companions at a music industry bash 
in London, where both were receiving awards. </p>
<p>For Bush it was a rare excursion out of her notoriously private world and 
into the glare of publicity she has spent so much of her later career avoiding. 
For Lydon it was just another opportunity to show off, play up to his enfant 
terrible image and behave badly for the cameras. Except for once he didn't. Upon 
collecting his award, all he could say was how &quot;proud&quot; he was to be in the same 
room as Kate Bush. </p>
<p>Lydon had previously complimented Bush for being a rule-breaker and a beacon 
against the &quot;slavish idiocy&quot; of the music industry. &quot;Her music is f***ing 
brilliant. She's a true original,&quot; he said. &quot;She went through the same @#%$ I 
did when she started, with people saying, 'Oh, that's not singing'.&quot; </p>
<p>Lydon is not alone is commending the artist. From Tori Amos to Bjork, there's 
not a female artist over the past 25 years who has not been influenced by Bush. 
It's salutary to think that when she last released an album - 1993's Red Shoes - 
Dido was still in school and Katie Melua was nine years old. </p>
<p>Back in those dark ages, the internet barely existed and the iPod was many 
years away from being invented. For Icelandic chanteuse Bjork, Bush was an 
integral part of her musical education. She has said of the singer: &quot;To me, Kate 
Bush will always represent the age of exploring your sexuality, when you change 
from a girl to a woman. All of that. There were so many records in my parents' 
house, so I saw a lot of album covers. I thought they were all macho and 
occupied with power, things I didn't like. I guess that's what I found 
fascinating about Kate, she totally stuck out. She created her own look and 
produced her own sound. There's a timelessness to Kate's music.&quot; </p>
<p>Such timelessness has certainly been propitious: at 47, Bush is not the only 
artist to keep us waiting between records. Stevie Wonder is just about to 
deliver his first new album in a decade. The Rolling Stones last month released 
their first collection of new songs after an eight-year absence from the studio. 
Guns N' Roses have been even more indolent and have so far kept us waiting 15 
years since their last record. </p>
<p>Yet it's the return of Bush - the Greta Garbo of pop - that is undoubtedly 
the event of this and any other season. Record industry veterans are scratching 
their heads to remember when a new record last generated such intense 
pre-release interest. Bush's record company, EMI, while keen not to over-hype 
her return and risk disappointing fans, can barely contain their excitement, and 
the buzz around the industry is that the album - entitled Aerial and due to 
reach shops on November 7 - is something very special indeed. </p>
<p>&quot;Everyone who's heard it so far has proclaimed it an absolute masterpiece, 
quite possibly her career peak. It's quite astonishing,&quot; said one EMI executive. 
It's a magnum opus of a double album, too, which is good news, for if all she 
had managed to come up with after a dozen years in purdah were 10 songs and 40 
minutes of music, we might well have felt short-changed. </p>
<p>Last week, 'King of the Mountain', the first single from the album, and her 
first new music since 1993, was made available as an internet download in the 
United States, although it will not be released in Britain until October 24. A 
gloriously dense swirl of electronic pulses, synthesised beats and brooding 
guitars with a typically ominous vocal, it's as epic and elemental as you could 
want. </p>
<p>When Bush first posted the news that the album was approaching completion on 
her website at the end of last year, she added: &quot;I hope you will all feel it's 
been worth the wait.&quot; In just four minutes and 45 seconds, 'King of the 
Mountain' delivers more than enough to suggest that it has. </p>
<p>Nineties music producer and singer, Tricky, feels it is the ethereal quality 
of Bush's talent that explains her success, and has said of her work: &quot;I don't 
believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible. Her music sounds 
religious to me. She should be treasured more than The Beatles. That she isn't 
is probably down to her own personality, because she can walk away from 
everything, and not make albums, and I respect her for that. Just to live your 
life, and not play the game - to me, that's success.&quot; </p>
<p>Bush is hardly doing any interviews to explain her long absence, and there 
are no plans for a supporting tour or promotional appearances. One of those who 
has visited her at home is Andy Bell of Erasure, who said of the experience: &quot;We 
went round her house and she was everything I expected. She was really nice, she 
made us tea in a proper teapot, she had baked a cake, she had loads of cats, and 
she was really softly spoken.&quot; </p>
<p>Clearly Bush is not about to lift the veil on the enigma she has so carefully 
constructed in the interest of something as sordid as commerce. Yet in an 
oblique way, 'King of the Mountain' is highly revealing. The CD cover is a 
drawing by her seven-year-old son, Bertie, which at least explains what she has 
been doing for half of her long silence, while the lyrics allude to Elvis 
Presley (who died as she was recording her first demos in 1977) and offer a 
nightmarish vision of how fame will damage you if you let it. You don't need to 
be Sigmund Freud to see how that relates to Bush's own reclusiveness and almost 
obsessive desire for privacy. Remarkably, in this age of celebrity fixation and 
instant gossip, it was almost two years after the birth of Bertie in 1998 before 
the media found out that she had become a mother. </p>
<p>Born in 1958 in the leafy suburb of Bexleyheath, Kent, to an English 
piano-playing doctor and his Irish folk-dancing wife, the young Catherine Bush's 
first love was traditional folk music, which she absorbed from two older 
brothers. She sang in the choir, played hymns on the organ and took violin 
lessons at convent school. By the age of 13 she was writing her own songs and 
was soon playing in a folk band with her brother Paddy. </p>
<p>At 15, she met Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour, who was impressed enough by 
her songs to pay for her to make a demo tape, which he then gave to the Floyd's 
record company, EMI. Bush was still at school, and in those innocent pre-Pop 
Idol times, EMI nurtured her carefully, giving her a £3,500 advance to finish 
her O-levels while she developed her songwriting. That was 1976, and it was 
another two years before her first single, 'Wuthering Heights', was released. 
She used her time well, stacking up 10 O-levels to fall back on should her 
singing career go horribly wrong, and studying under the mime artist and 
choreographer, Lindsay Kemp, among whose former pupils was David Bowie. It was 
the moves she learned from Kemp that provided the dramatic, erotically-charged 
gestures that accompanied her performance of 'Wuthering Heights' as a 
19-year-old, tangle-haired gypsy on Top of the Pops and in a memorable video.
</p>
<p>It turned out she hadn't even read Emily Brontë's book and her version was 
based on the memory of seeing the final scenes of a film of the story. </p>
<p>It mattered not, for by any reckoning it was an extraordinary song, matched 
by her extraordinary and romantic appearance. After the three-chord thrashing 
and grim safety-pinned wardrobe of punk, Bush was a breath of fresh air, and it 
was obvious that a unique new talent had arrived in our midst. </p>
<p>Two albums followed in quick succession, as The Kick Inside and Lionheart 
both appeared in 1978, full of songs about such unconventional subjects as 
murder, incest, feminism and nuclear war, and confirming her as Britain's most 
original female artist.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In early 1979, she embarked on a spectacular tour that involved mime, magic, 
dance, theatre and elaborate costumes which she designed herself. She was 
drained by the experience and never toured again. </p>
<p>Instead, she concentrated on the studio, where she developed a reputation for 
control freakery, composing, arranging and producing her own records and even 
directing her own management company. Her third album, 1980's Never For Ever, 
was surprisingly the first by a British female artist to top the charts. Yet its 
follow-up, 1982's The Dreaming, produced the first crisis of her career. The 
songs were dense, experimental and non-radio friendly and it sold poorly. When 
she disappeared for three years, rumours circulated that she had suffered a 
mental breakdown and her reputation as a mysterious recluse was forged. She 
later appeared to confirm the rumours when she referred to The Dreaming as her 
&quot;mad album&quot;. </p>
<p>Bush came back stronger than ever with 1985's million-selling Hounds of Love, 
an album that was also her American breakthrough. It was another four years 
before her next release, the introspective The Sensual World, and four after 
that until 1993's The Red Shoes. It was her most emotionally charged record to 
date, but it was overshadowed by the death of her mother and the end of her 
long-standing relationship with fellow musician Del Palmer. </p>
<p>Since then, she has spent her time building a fresh life with her new 
partner, the guitarist Danny McIntosh, with whom she lives in a house on a 
island in the Thames near Theale, Berkshire, raising their son, working in the 
studio in the wooded grounds, making sculptures and guarding her privacy more 
fiercely than ever. According to one rare appearance in the gossip columns 
earlier this year, she and McIntosh recently paid £2.5m for a second home in 
Devon, with 17 acres of land and its own beach. </p>
<p>Since her last album, British music has unearthed a rich seam of pretenders 
to Bush's throne, including Dido, Goldfrapp, KT Tunstall and Joss Stone. They 
had all better look to their laurels: the queen of them all is back to claim her 
crown. </p>
<p>THE BUSH OFFENSIVE </p>
<p>HIGHS </p>
<p>• In 1978 her debut single 'Wuthering Heights' tops the charts, and the 
song's parent album, The Kick Inside, sells over one million copies in the UK.
</p>
<p>• Her third, self-produced LP, Never For Ever, makes No1 in the album chart.
</p>
<p>• A state-of-the-art studio is installed in her home, where she records the 
hugely successful Hounds Of Love LP. </p>
<p>• A single from that album, 'Running Up That Hill', gives Kate her first 
chart success in the US, breaching the Billboard Top 30 for the first time. The 
video for her duet of 'Don't Give Up' with Peter Gabriel, right, is hailed as a 
groundbreaker in the field. </p>
<p>• In 1987 she wins Best Female Artist at the Sixth Brit Awards. </p>
<p>• Her sole 1990s album, The Red Shoes, continues the chart success story in 
the US. </p>
<p>LOWS </p>
<p>• The teenage Kate is mortified when the posters promoting The Kick Inside 
are withdrawn after allegedly proving too distracting for motorists. </p>
<p>• The second album, Lionheart, disappoints, but not as much as her one and 
only full-scale tour to date, which features 17 costume changes. It is a 
financial disaster which Kate chooses never to repeat. </p>
<p>• In 1982, the single 'There Goes A Tenner' from The Dreaming album is a 
commercial flop, prompting some critical vultures to start circling. </p>
<p>• Her adaptation of Molly Bloom's soliloquy from James Joyce's Ulysses as the 
title track of The Sensual World in 1989 does not help her cause with those who 
believe her music should be more accessible. </p>
<p>• Her sole release of the 1990s, The Red Shoes, is heavy on guest 
appearances, with Prince and Eric Clapton, but light on hits. Undeterred, Kate 
celebrates more US success by directing a film, The Line, The Cross And The 
Curve, based on six tracks from the album. </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b><a name="Independent01">Kate Bush: The Sequel</a>
</b>The Independent
by Geneviève Roberts and Louisa Reynolds<b>
</b>September 2, 2005<b>
</b>

<b>She was wacky, she was mysterious, she was a child prodigy who topped the charts... 
and then she disappeared without trace. This month Kate 
Bush is back with her first single in more than a decade. Terry Kirby 
traces her career </b></font></PRE>
<p>In 1993, in Switzerland, something called the World Wide Web was conceived, 
while in Manchester, a couple of roughnecks called the Gallagher brothers 
decided to call their new band Oasis, although Britpop was still a marketing 
man's dream. </p>
<p>It was also the last time that Kate Bush released an album. </p>
<p>Although some things haven't changed much since the early 1990s, the internet 
and the iPod have revolutionised the way music is listened to and a whole new 
range of female artists such as Dido, Joss Stone and KT Tunstall are competing 
for our attention. </p>
<p>Now, one of music's most reclusive and enigmatic figures has re-emerged into 
what some have seen as a rich era for British female singer-songwriters. Bush's 
new double album, Aerial, is due out in November, only her eighth after three 
decades in the business. It will be treated with due reverence. This is a woman 
who, like Stone, was once a teenage prodigy, if a decidedly wackier one, and she 
is claimed by many to be the great lost talent of British female pop singers.
</p>
<p>At 47, the elfin Bush has perhaps claim to become the grand dame of them all, 
above comparison to mere lightweights such as Dido, regularly cited as an 
influence by artists from Placebo to Goldfrapp. </p>
<p>There are perhaps better comparisons than Stone or Dido This is a women who 
was top of the charts while Madonna was still a disco dancer and - while she may 
not rival the so-called Queen of Pop in terms of earnings - she's more than a 
match in terms of the iron control she exerts over her own career and public 
image. </p>
<p>&quot;I simply think she is one of the greatest figures in British music over the 
last 30 years. There are an awful lot of people in the business wandering around 
claiming to be artists, but she is one of the few who can genuinely make that 
claim'' says Paul Rees, editor of Q Magazine. He rejects any suggestion that 
Bush has to be judged alongside the new wave. &quot;I don't think there is any 
competition, she's on a different level and quite outside them all.'' </p>
<p>The anticipation has been heightened by the fact that even insiders in the 
music business have few clues what the intensely private Bush has been up to 
recently, although rumours of a new album have been circulating for several 
years. One story is that Bush invited a bunch of top EMI people down to her home 
and simply baked them all cakes. More prosaically, the delays may be that that 
her life has been occupied by other, more pressing personal matters. </p>
<p>Bush-watchers will already be searching for clues in the sparse announcement 
from EMI. Both the title of the album and the single that will precede it &quot;King 
of the Mountain&quot;, downloadable on 27 September, both somehow still echo and 
evoke the mysterious and ethereal image that the 19- year-old Bush created for 
herself when she first burst onto the music scene in January 1978, with 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. </p>
<p>Her own take on the Emily Brontë novel, written several years earlier after 
watching part of a television adaptation, it was UK No 1 for four weeks. Coming 
in the aftermath of the spit-and-bondage raw power of punk, the gargling, 
warbling and arm waving of Bush at first seemed like a one-off novelty act, &quot;a 
ghastly apparition, an evil witch rising out the dry ice,'' as rock writer Rob 
Jovanovic puts it in his forthcoming biography. As became clear, Bush was in it 
for the long term, carefully nurtured by a close circle of family, friends and a 
sympathetic record company. But there was never any suggestion that Bush was 
being manipulated or was ever anything other than her own person. </p>
<p>By the time &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; appeared, Bush had already been signed for 
three years to EMI, which was content to let her talent mature a little, an 
impossibility in these days of Pop Idol. She had been discovered by David 
Gilmour of Pink Floyd, a friend of a friend of her older brother. Gilmour 
provided money for a demo tape and took her to EMI. One of the three songs was 
&quot;The Man With the Child in his Eyes,&quot; later a hit single. </p>
<p>Gilmour later told an interviewer: &quot;I didn't realise how commercially 
successful she might be. I thought of her more really, I suppose, in the terms 
of someone like Joni Mitchell - the level of a lady who's very talented, but 
would appeal to a more esoteric audience. But she had different ideas.'' </p>
<p>Bush's sense of purpose was already evident and was later made clear to her 
parents. Her EMI contract secure, Bush carried on at school, getting 10 
O-levels, but decided to leave. She said later: &quot;My parents weren't keen on the 
giving up of school at the beginning to go into singing and dancing but once 
they saw I was serious about it they gave support. I was quite stubborn about my 
decision and in the end they realised it was for the best.'' </p>
<p>They allowed her to live in a flat they owned in south London while she 
studied dancing under mime master Lindsey Kemp and carried on writing and 
singing. EMI kept a watching brief, waited for the initial fury of punk to die 
down and released &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in January 1978. </p>
<p>Some didn't get her, either then or later, being alienated by the combination 
of slightly contrived tweeness, the falsetto warbling and the sheer pretentious, 
earnestness of it all. Jovanovic notes that the late, great, John Peel, a man 
whose ears were open to many sounds, claimed he could not take her seriously 
while the renowned American rock critic Dave Marsh described her as &quot;sounding 
like the consequences of mating Patti Smith with a Hoover vacuum cleaner&quot;.</p>
<p>Arguably, Bush is one of a handful of artists who first appreciated the power 
of the video. All her early singles were accompanied by imaginative videos, 
which made full use of her looks and her ability as a dancer. Curiously, she was 
always a reluctant life performer, doing only a handful of pub gigs with the KT 
Band in 1976 during her EMI training days and one tour, in 1979. Possibly her 
reluctance to tour afterwards stemmed from the death of her lighting director, 
who fell to his death on stage during a concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. There 
have been only a handful of one-off appearances. </p>
<p>Although her first album, The Kick Inside, went triple platinum, her artistic 
reputation among the cognoscenti hinges on two albums in the early 1980's: The 
Dreaming, released in 1982 was the first she produced herself and Hounds of 
Love, 1985, produced on the 48-track studio she had built at her home. Both 
featured a diverse and difficult to categorise blend of styles matched by her 
often surreal and literate lyrics. But her fans cite her bravery in often 
talking about subjects long before they became fashionable - gay relationships, 
for example. </p>
<p>Many see those as her artistic peak with the subsequent albums The Sensual 
World, in 1989 and The Red Shoes, in 1993 both being more hit and miss affairs. 
And at a rate of one album every four years, she could hardly be accused of 
burning herself out. </p>
<p>But since 1993, there has been virtual silence, punctuated by infrequent 
public appearances, such as receiving a lifetime achievement award from Q - at 
which she only agreed to be photographed with John Lydon, the former Johnny 
Rotten. Her personal life appeared to have intervened. After coping with the 
death of her mother, she split from her long-term partner, Del Palmer, a 
musician. She then began a relationship with guitarist Danny MacIntosh and in 
1999, gave birth to a son. They live in a mansion in Berkshire but are reported 
to have another home in south Devon. </p>
<p>Her creative absence merely reinforced her credibility, particularly when 
Hounds of Love was covered by the Futureheads and a succession of new singers 
such as Tori Amos were dubbed &quot;the New Kate Bush&quot; on a fraction of the evidence.
</p>
<p>Rumours of an album were confirmed in December last year when she confirmed 
she had been in Abbey Road Studios with composer Michael Kamen, (who has since 
died.) Gilmour is believed to be around, as he has been from the start. </p>
<p>At Q, Rees does admit that the expectation level is high and that, as is 
often the case when any artist delivers an eagerly anticipated work after a 
lengthy period of quiet, the dangers of an anti-climax loom. &quot;It is incredibly 
difficult in this kind of situation. There is always the reaction of 'Is that 
it...?' And that is particular true now more than ever, when we have so much 
that works on a superficial level. And she is one of those that you have to 
listen to a lot and the more you do, the more is revealed.'' </p>
<p>He is glad that Bush will be delivering an old-fashioned double album. &quot;It's 
good to think this an artist delivering a magnum opus. One would feel slightly 
short-changed if she came back after all this time with 10 songs over 35 
minutes.'' </p>
<p>Stars who stepped out of the limelight </p>
<p>LINDA THOMPSON </p>
<p>According to Time magazine she was possibly &quot;rock's best woman singer&quot; while 
Rolling Stone voted her top female vocalist, but when Linda Thompson retired 
from the folk-rock music scene she had helped to invent in 1985, listeners 
assumed they would never hear her voice again. She had split up from her 
husband, the guitarist and songwriter Richard Thompson. But she had also been 
diagnosed with hysterical dysphonia, the vocalist's equivalent of merciless 
stage fright. But after a 17-year break, she returned with an album aptly named 
Fashionably Late. </p>
<p>JEAN SHRIMPTON </p>
<p>In 1960 Jean Shrimpton met David Bailey while he was assisting the 
photographer John French. For three years they worked almost exclusively 
together and &quot;the Shrimp&quot; became one of the iconic models of the Swinging 
Sixties era, wearing ever shorter skirts and creating memorable images for 
Vogue. Unlike her contemporary Twiggy, Jean's withdrawal from the limelight has 
been absolute. She now runs a hotel in Penzance, Cornwall, where she raised a 
family with Michael Cox, whom she married in 1979. </p>
<p>CERYS MATTHEWS </p>
<p>When fame got too much for the lead singer of Catatonia she fled to 
Nashville. The singer with the distinctive raspy voice set up home with her 
husband, Seth Riddle, a television producer, away from the British media. She 
had always shunned celebrity but found herself in the spotlight after the band 
enjoyed massive success. The album Equally Cursed and Blessed was aptly titled: 
she had to cancel several concert tours after suffering from anxiety and nervous 
exhaustion, and the band split up in 2001. </p>

<p><b><a name="guardian03">Kate Bush rules, OK? </a><br>
</b>The Guardian<br>
by Michael Berkeley <br>
October 11, 2005 <br>
<br>
<b>Pop musicians are far more demanding in the studio than classical ones are. 
Michael Berkeley explains why </b></p>
<p>As a composition student I played rock music on the side, an experience that 
taught me a lot about direct communication and enabled me later in life to enjoy 
some brief but rewarding forays into film and commercial music. So when the 
conductor Richard Hickox rang me one day in 1984 to ask if I could help with a 
rather unusual job for which he and his choir had been engaged, I was intrigued. 
Kate Bush, it transpired, was working on her new album, Hounds of Love, and for 
one track, Hello Earth, she wanted a chorus to recreate the orthodox 
singing/chanting that made such a contribution to the film Nosferatu. The only 
problem, Hickox explained, was that there was no sheet music available and that 
anyway it would need to be notated and completely re-written to fit the Hello 
Earth track. Slightly bemused, I think - this was a far cry from his more 
customary Gluck or Vaughan Williams - he asked if he could put Bush in touch 
with me.<br>
I had always considered Kate Bush truly original both as a performer and as a 
songwriter with an unusually fresh sense of harmony. If her new album next month 
is awaited with some excitement after a long fallow period, then in 1985 it was 
assumed that Hounds of Love would be something of a final fling at the 
conclusion of a waning career. I soon realised how wrong this assumption was 
when Kate sent me a cassette: it was zany, ambitious and yet utterly Kate Bush, 
but with gaps where I was to do her bidding. Having chatted at length, she sent 
me a long letter with the words of the song and precise instructions on how it 
should unfold. Her writing hand was curiously like her voice - quirky and 
touchingly childish; large, separated letters and with the dots over each &quot;i&quot; 
individually circled. There was, however, nothing child-like about the 
seriousness and certainty of its contents. </p>
<p>Structure was carefully delineated, verses and choruses written out fully and 
marked up in colour, and she talked of the sound quality in the most graphic 
terms. Still not having been able to identify the music of the title sequence of 
Nosferatu or even the language it was sung in, she suggested that, if necessary, 
I write something similar but added that while the key of this chorus would need 
to relate, it could arrive as something foreign, harmonically a surprise, as 
though from another world. In other words, while it had to fit, Kate wanted it 
to sound &quot;collaged&quot;. This superimposition of foreign sources is a technique 
pioneered by visionary composers like Ives and Stockhausen. I soon realised that 
Bush was pretty exacting on the precise fit of the &quot;non-fit&quot;. Indeed, she was 
thrilled when I suggested we create our own new language for this chorus of the 
spheres. </p>
<p>Although she had piano and violin lessons at school, Bush is essentially 
self-taught). I have always been fascinated by the difference of dynamics at 
work between popular artists and conventionally trained classical musicians, and 
had a similar experience with the Edge, of U2, when we worked together on the 
score of a film called Captive. </p>
<p>In fact, gifted &quot;pop&quot; musicians like Bush and U2 are far more demanding of 
themselves in the studio than classical musicians can afford to be, and will 
spend days working on a tiny fragment. On the other hand, they envy the 
technique that allows classically trained composers to write something down that 
can be realised by good sight readers almost instantly. The Edge was amazed that 
the London Sinfonietta under Oliver Knussen recorded my part of the score (some 
30 to 40 minutes) in a couple of three-hour sessions while he laboured for weeks 
to get his sounds just as he wanted them. </p>
<p>The fact that Kate Bush needed my contribution to realise a specific moment 
of her original concept (as the Beatles used George Martin in a much wider 
context) was a marrying of two disciplines without diluting either. In terms of 
sculptural soundscape, this is the kind of midwifery role that Brian Eno fulfils 
for groups like U2. </p>
<p>Come the recording day, a group of male choristers, more accustomed to 
singing church services than backing vocals, descended on Bush's home, which was 
equipped with its own studio. Doubtless they were imagining that they were about 
to meet a wild-eyed rock babe, but Kate, quiet and unassuming - the kind of 
sympathetic, slightly shy girl who greets you from behind the counter at the 
local chemist - introduced us to her friend the bass player Del Palmer, who 
engineered the session. None of the singers or Richard had ever gone over and 
over four or five phrases so exactingly. No measure of Bach or Mozart had, in 
their experience, been subjected to such surgical scrutiny, and I began to worry 
that their voices might begin to tire. But Bush knew and got what she wanted and 
Hello Earth is, I think, a remarkable track on the album that finally broke the 
American market and established her as an iconic and hugely influential figure. 
I can't wait to hear what she has been up to now. </p>

Manchester Evening News<br>
by Mark Richardson<br>
September 22, 2005</p>
<p>After a 12-year absence Kate Bush is set to return to the airwaves with a new 
album, Ariel - and the first single will not disappoint her many fans. <br>
In these days of X Factor and Pop Idol it is almost a surprise to hear an artist 
construct a sound that is casually littered with musical ability. <br>
Ever since her breathe-taking debut release Wuthering Heights, Kate Bush has 
consistently brought a fresh approach to her music, blending styles and 
technology to produce a unique sound.<br>
Her latest single King Of The Mountain makes it clear that she has lost none of 
this ability. While King Of The Mountain is not ground breaking, it does offer 
all the dynamics that are integral to the Kate Bush sound, from unstructured 
electronics, to driving rhythm and soaring vocals. </p>
<p>Welcome back, Kate. </p>
<p>This single is released on 24th October. </p>
