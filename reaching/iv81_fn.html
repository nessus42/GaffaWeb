<P>&quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; with Desmond Morris, 
</P>
<P>UK TV Nov. 21 1981 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to IED for the tape.] 
</P>
<P>[Applause] 
</P>
<P>I: I always find watching you sing - because you do more than listen to you,
you  watch very much as well when you're performing - I always find I feel like
a  mouse confronted with a cobra because there's something hypnotic about it,
it's  very strange. Can you explain it? It's some sort of curious lilt you get
into your  voice which is almost like an incantation. Where did it come from? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] Well &quot;ssssss&quot; is the obvious way, isn't it? I don't
know, it's very strange  because I think a lot of influences have been
responsible for the way I am and I  think that's the same with everyone, really.
That you are, in many ways, the  things that you like, and you try to be those
things that you like. And I've always  been incredibly fond of music, I've
always tried to aspire to the people that I  admire. And the same with dancing,
I've always had a basic interest in it, I think  mainly because of the
expression that you can get, you know, through singing and  dancing. 
</P>
<P>I: But was there anything... I mean it's such an unusual style, I think it's
what's so  extraordinary. So many pop singers do sound the same, but you sound
absolutely  different from all the rest. [Kate Laughs] What possible
influence.... 'cause you  didn't have a very unusual childhood, did you? 
</P>
<P>K: No, not particularly. 
</P>
<P>I: Where did you live, for example? 
</P>
<P>K: I was brought up in Kent. A very sort of normal upbringing. I think the
music,  again, that I was hearing at a very early age influenced me tremendously
because  before I was going to school, before I was reading, I was singing along
to songs, to  traditional music. And in a way I think that got my soul before
the education even  got near me. And I think really when you are that young, in
a way I think the  sparks of what you really want to do are there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>I: But the voice... where, where, ... were you singing like that then, this
strange  voice that rises up so high? 
</P>
<P>K: No, when I first started singing I had an incredibly plain voice, I mean
I could  sing in tune but that was about it, I mean I really wasn't that good.
And really all  I did was sing every day, because I was writing songs, I would
sing them. And I  was concentrating much more on my writing and therefore my
voice came  through that. And every day I'd be at the piano for hours, so really
it was just a  gradual progression from something that started... 
</P>
<P>I: Do you like your own voice? 
</P>
<P>K: No, I don't, and I think this is a problem that a awful lot of artists
have, they  can't actually enjoy what they do, or their voice, or whatever it
is, to the fullest  because they are themselves. And it's very painful for me to
listen to my voice  sometimes as it is for other people who don't like it.
[Laughter from audience]  But it's something that you have to try to accept,
that you have limitations. And  that's what you go for. 
</P>
<P>I: You have some very exotic body language to, where did that come from? Did
you  have special training for that? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I did train. But when I left school, I knew that I wanted to do
music, but I  also knew that their was something missing from the expression.
And I was very  lucky just to see an add in a paper. I went to see a show, and
it was Lindsay  Kemp, and really I'd never seen anything like it before. And
what he was doing  was he was using movement without any sound at all, something
I'd never  experienced, and he was expressing so much, probably more most people
would  express with their mouths. And it suddenly dawned on me that there was a 
whole new world of expression that I'd hadn't even realized. And so.. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you still do a lot of mime? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I try to, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: You still train at it, do you? 
</P>
<P>K: It's very hard to get the time, that's the main problem, because I find
I'm in the  studio or writing most of the time. So fitting everything in is in
fact the biggest  problem and it's very frustrating sometimes because there's so
many things that  you want to do, but because of limitations you can't fit it
all in. 
</P>
<P>I: Yet, [??? inaudible] and everything, you've got a reputation of doing
absolutely  everything for your shows, how many jobs do you do when you go on
the road  with your show? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think I try and do everything that I think I can handle and
because I'm  writing the music and singing and performing, a lot of things come
from that  which I don't think would otherwise. For instance, I don't think I'd
be able to  choreograph if I didn't write the music, because in many ways I know
the music  so inside out, and like backwards sometimes, that I already have
ideas for steps  and choreography that I wouldn't have otherwise. And in many
ways it just goes  from the song, the song just takes off, then a video needs to
be made, and then a  stage show. So, it's like the development of the songs, in
many ways. It seems like  a natural procedure. 
</P>
<P>I: 'Cause you're your own producer, I think, aren't you? You produce it all 
yourself, the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I've only just managed to get there though. I mean this album is the
first one  that I'm producing. And it's incredible, I mean there really is so
much you have  to do, and it is very hard. 
</P>
<P>I: Hard work, is it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, especially also when you're the artist that you're doing the album
of. I mean  sometimes I keep thinking, &quot;who's album is this,&quot; you
know. And then I think  it's mine and I think &quot;well,&quot; you know, &quot;I've
got to keep working.&quot; I think I  wouldn't be able to if I didn't feel that
the songs need to be presented to people. 
</P>
<P>I: The strange thing about you is you introduced a very original style, it
didn't grow  slowly it was there, Boommp! The first time I saw you, I said in
1978, &quot;there it  was.&quot; How do you see it developing? K: Well, I see it
developing especially on  stage, I think that's where I found something. When I
did the tour I'd never  realized how much you can in fact do on a live stage. I
think there's a lot that's  used in video and film that has never really
explored in a live sense and I think  that there's a lot that you could do there
that I would like to try and do, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Apart from yourself, where do you think pop music is going at the moment?
I  sometimes get the feeling that apart individualist performers like yourself,
a lot of  it is beginning to sound, maybe I'm getting old, but it sounds all the
same to me  now, alot of it on Top Of The Pops. 
</P>
<P>K: I have that problem, too. I watch Top Of The Pops, you know, some weeks
and I  really find it very, very hard to identify with some of the music that
people are  making. And yet obviously the young people of today really do enjoy
it. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, but I think it's so marvelous that we have, in this country,
produced another  original performer. One of the most unusual singers I've ever
heard. I certainly,  unlike you, I enjoy your voice very much indeed. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: Ladies and gentleman, Kate Bush! 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>[Applause]

<P>Dr. Desmond Morris (who wrote the books Manwatching and The Naked Ape, 
among many others) was the guest-host interviewer. He specifically asked for
Kate  to be his guest. 
</P>
<P>It was aired during the making of TD. Shades of &quot;Leave It Open&quot;...this
is my  favorite part: 
</P>
<P>K ...if I didn't write the music, because in many ways I know the music so
inside  out, and like backwards sometimes... 
</P>
<P>I played the audio of this interview in one of my Kate Radio Specials, and
during  that bit I cut it off and played the backwards version of LIO.
