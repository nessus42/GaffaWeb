<H3>&quot;What Katie Sang Next&quot;
</H3>
<H4>As lowering that voice led higher up the charts.<BR> Kate Bush: a girl who
positively sparkles with star quality
</H4>
<P>Singer Kate Bush's fascinating amber eyes gazed at the  Thames as she said: &quot;I
want to establish myself other than as the girl with the squeaky voice. I want
to  become more than a warbler...</P>
<P>&quot;I was worried that the public was only into the bizarre quality of my
first record.&quot;</P>
<P>She meant the extraordinary &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;  song she wrote
and sung to the top of the hit parade in a high-pitched oriental sound.</P>
<P>It's for this reason that 19-year-old doctor's daughter Kate is all the more
delighted that her latest record &quot;Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; is a
hit.</P>
<P>On this she sings in her normal voice, rather than sounding as if  she's
stepped out of the world of Suzy Wong.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm thrilled that the public are with me,&quot; said the girl EMI
started backing as a 16-year-old songwriter with a &pound;3,000 advance and whose
LP <EM>The Kick Inside</EM> is also high in the ratings.</P>
<P>The song is about men, whom the 19-year-old Kate believes are all little
boys at heart.</P>
<P>Although she doesn't have a steady boyfriend, she likes men. I asked her
what qualities men have to have to attract her.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm just concerned about the human being. I'm not after  money -- so
I'm not interested in rich men. I like men who are good and interesting.&quot;</P>
<P>She is certainly a pretty girl, with a gipsy quality about her delicate
features. She lives in a Lewisham house with two pet cats and her two brothers,
although she grew up in Welling, Kent, where her father is a GP.</P>
<P>Her 25-year-old brother Paddy plays mandolin and is a member of the group
she has just formed to back her on a planned concert tour.</P>
<P>Kate's big break came when Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour heard Kate sing
some of her songs at the piano at her parent's house. He volunteered to pay for
her to record some tracks and present them to EMI.</P>
<P>Although EMI immediately decided she had potential, they felt that at 16 she
was too young. They put her under contract, leaving her to prepare for the
important day by investing in lessons in mime and dance.</P>
<P>&quot;The were right,&quot; said Kate. &quot;I wouldn't have been ready for
it then. But now I am. I'm very critical of what I do and I really fight for
what I want to get. &quot;</P>
