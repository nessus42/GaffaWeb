<P>Date: Tue, 28 May 91 00:04:54 PDT <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald
Hill) <BR> Subject: More Canadian Interviews 1985
</P>
<P>88. Good Rockin' Tonight, Much Music, The New Music, Toronto Evening News, 
etc.: excerpts from interviews (all dating from the same day, in the same
Toronto  studios) conducted by Christopher Ward, Nan Devitt and Daniel Richler
in late  November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>These interviews have a strikingly better atmosphere than their U.S. 
counterparts, which had been conducted only a day or two before. Much of the 
credit for this must go to the excellent interviewing techniques of the Canadian
 hosts, particularly Mr. Ward and Mr. Richler. Both men had prepared well for
their  interviews and both show evident respect for their guest on camera. Kate
responds,  consequently, with greater frankness and fluidity than she had in any
other  interviews of the 1985 promotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above note by IED. Boy does Kate look good in
these  interviews! ] 
</P>
<P>[Interview 2: With Daniel Richler] 
</P>
<P>I: When you last met, you said that The Dreaming had been something of a 
traumatic album for you, or at least had reflected traumatic experiences of
yours,  but that the new record, The Hounds Of Love, was going to be a happier
thing.  Do you still stick to that? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I do think this has go a much more positive energy. Not necessarily
that the  last album was dark, but it was dealing with intensities of emotion.
Perhaps a  more introverted album and this is more outward and happy, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: You have this so called Running Up That Hill in which you want to make a
deal  with God. What exactly is the deal you want to make? 
</P>
<P>K: It's the two people in the song, a man and a woman, that what to make a
deal  with God in order to swap places with each other. That if the man could be
the  woman, and vise-versa, they would understand what its like from that other 
person's point of view and that perhaps there'd be less problems in the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>[Part of Running Up That Hill is played] 
</P>
<P>I: The second side of The Hounds Of Love has a concept feel to it-there are
a  number of songs that are strung together and they're all under the sub-title
of  The Ninth Wave. What is The Ninth Wave? 
</P>
<P>K: The Ninth Wave is a quote from a poem by Tennyson. Some people have
though  that the whole side was based on this poem and in fact it's completely
the other  way around - where I'd written the whole side, wanted a title that
would sum up  the energy of it, and was looking through books, etc, to try to
find a title, as I  didn't feel it was there within the songs themselves. And I
found that and it  seemed to be such a good parallel, the fact that it's such
water imagery, and he's  talking about how waves work in cycles of nine, all
building up to the ninth one,  and then it starts again. 
</P>
<P>I: There's lots of scary water images on the Ninth Wave - a man drowning and
 trying to get out from underneath the ice, a witch being bunked, fisherman at 
sea, and so on. Where did you first get the idea to do this theme about water
and  it's frightening aspects. 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think water is something I think of as threatening, really. It's
an  incredibly beautiful thing and its one of those imageries that I think
forever, both  way back into the past and into the future, will always be used
by writers. Water,  the sea is one of those incredible images, it's so powerful,
so almighty, so kind  and so cruel. And I think, what attracted me was all kinds
of things. Obviously  the imagery there but also the idea of a tiny human being,
this little thing, all  alone in this great expanse of cruelty, that elemental
force, and the contrast  between the two. Something that I think attracts me as
a writer in music as well,  the contrast of textures, putting something with
something else that perhaps isn't  meant to go and playing with those ideas. 
</P>
<P>I: When I met you in your dance studio in London, I saw a painting against
the wall  that we were laughing about. It was a satire of that pre-Raphaelite
painting of  Ophelia drowned in the reeds, this one was in a polluted river. Now
on the inside  cover sheave of the hounds of Love there's a picture of you in
the water, like  Ophelia. Is that a deliberate connection? 
</P>
<P>K: Not a conscious connection, no, but I'm sure that that imagery is there
very  strongly. Ophelia is one of those beautiful paintings, its extraordinary.
And I  think my attraction to Ophelia in the first place is what made me get
that  painting. So it's probably still quite subconsciously strong there in me.

</P>
<P>[An excerpt from Cloudbusting is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Your new video for Cloudbusting has got Donald Sutherland in it, and you
look  quite impish, and there's some story going on. Can you tell us where it
came  from, what it's about? 
</P>
<P>K: The song was inspired by a book, which was about the relationship between
the  man who wrote the book and his father. And it's written through his eyes
when  he was a child. There's an incredible sense of innocence in the book. And
his  father was a very respected psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and he also had a 
machine called a cloudbuster that could make it rain. And together they would go
 out and make it rain. And we really wanted to do justice to the story and the 
relationship between the two of them, that was a very special one. [Another 
excerpt from Cloudbusting] 
</P>
<P>I: Who wrote that book? 
</P>
<P>K: Peter Reich. 
</P>
<P>I: Ah, Peter Reich. And it was called Cloudbusting? 
</P>
<P>K: It was called A Book Of Dreams. 
</P>
<P>I: And does he know that you have...is he still a living writer? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, he is and ah... 
</P>
<P>I: I should know about him I suppose. 
</P>
<P>K: Well the book wasn't totally well known. It was in print for a while and
is now  out of print. And we sent him a cassette of the song, hoping that he
would like it  and he's been very responsive, which is great for me. 
</P>
<P>[Still more of Cloudbusting is played]
