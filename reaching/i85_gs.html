<P>Kate Bush &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; Has Her Running Up The Charts 
</P>
<P>From The Georgia Straight 
</P>
<P>by Steve Newton 
</P>
<P> When Kate Bush was 15 years old she thought it would be nice [if] she could
get  some of her songs published. There was a friend of her family who knew
someone  that was looking for talent to encourage and produce. That someone came
and heard  Kate's songs, and was intrigued enough to put up the money need to
master a few  demo tapes. Those masters were what got the career of Kate Bush
rolling... right up  to her highly-acclaimed new album, Hounds Of Love. The
certain someone who put  the ball in motion was none other than David Gilmour,
famed guitarist for the  seventies rock giants Pink Floyd. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He was really responsible for me getting my recording contract with
EMI in the  first place&quot;, says Kate, who called The Straight from Toronto
recently. That contract  has resulted in the release of five full-length LPs
-The Kick Inside (1977) [1978].  Lionheart ('78). Never For Ever ('80). The
Dreaming ('82) and Hounds ('85) - as  well as two mini-albums, the live On Stage
and Kate Bush (both '83). 
</P>
<P>Strangely enough, upon first meeting Gilmour in '75, Bush had never even
heard  any Pink Floyd music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was not really aware of much contemporary rock music at that age. I
had heard  of them, but hadn't actually heard their music. It wasn't until later
that I got to  hear stuff like Dark Side Of The Moon. And I just thought that
was superb - I mean  they really did do some pretty profound stuff.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Gilmour was executive producer of The Kick Inside. He also sang on Pull Out 
The Pin from The Dreaming. In fact, Kate Bush has been fortunate enough to have 
fine musicians sitting in on all her records. Aside from the basic core of
players that  includes drummer Stuart Elliot, bassist Del Palmer, and guitarist
Alan Murphy, she's  had help from synth whiz Larry Fast (Never For Ever),
bassist Eberhard Weber  (The Dreaming) and guitarist John Williams (Hounds Of
Love). Max Middleton,  former Jeff Beck keyboardist, played extensively on Never
For Ever. So where does  she find such top-notch talent? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well if I'm not a particular fan of them, then I'm either introduced
to them  through fellow musicians, or people I know. But quite often you hear a
piece of  music and you really like what's happening there... so you just get
them in!&quot; 
</P>
<P>One piece of music that had a strong effect on Bush was Pink Floyd's The
Wall.  She liked it so much that she borrowed the helicopter effect from that
song to use  on Waking the Witch, on of the more startling songs on Hounds Of
Love. It begins  with a curious vocal track that resembles a jumped-up morse
code. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's an effect that we managed to muck around with. It was a very 
experimental idea, a sort of trick really, that took us a long time to do. I
wanted to  give the impression on a very desperate attempt to communicate.&quot;

</P>
<P>Another peculiar effect of the new record occurs at the start of the title
track. A  frightened mal voice cries &quot;It's in the trees! It's coming!&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;It's really the idea of someone being chased by something - which in
this case is  love - but something that they're really scared of. It's being
treated in an incredibly  melodramatic way, you know, as if some great monster
is coming to get you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The line comes from a 1956 black and white English horror movie, Night of
The  Demon (also released as Curse Of The Demon). As it turns out, Kate is quite
a fan of  scary flicks. On the liner notes of Hounds Of Love there's a special
thank to  Werner Herzog. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's a piece of music in Hello Earth that a choir sings. I heard
that originally  in a film of his called Nosferatu (a vampire movie). It's such
a beautiful piece of  traditional music, that I just had to use it, so we
rearranged it for voices.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On Hello Earth an instrument called the bouzouki is used, and throughout 
Hounds instruments such as the balalaika and dijeridu are put into play. Kate
seems  to thrive on sounds that are found far off the beaten path of ordinary
pop. 
</P>
<P>I think you're always looking for little piece of gold amongst the rubbish -
on  every level. Lyrically, musically, and soundwise. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The dijeridu I first used on the last album. There's a man called Rolf
Harris,  who's an incredible dijeridu player. And I&quot;d written a track on
the last album about  aborigines (The Dreaming) and asked him to come in and
play it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On her new album, the dijeridu is played by Kate's brother Paddy Bush. He
uses  it on The Big Sky and Jig Of Life, and also plays violin and fujare on The
Morning  Fog. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Paddy has really been quite involved in all my albums. And Jon (Bush,
another  brother) hasn't really played as much, but he's been involved in vocal
things,  particularly on this album. He's a novel writer as well, and a
photographer.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Brother Jon is actually the one responsible for the striking photography on
the  cover and inside sleeve of Hounds Of Love. The cover shot depicts a
seductive Kate  cuddling in a purple bed with two German hunting dogs. On the
back cover Kate is  shown partially submerged in a weedy pond. There is a method
to her madness. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Since the album is like two completely different albums, and we gave
each side a  title, we thought it would be nice if it almost had two front
covers. Each picture is  sort of depicting a side, you know.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Side One is entitled &quot;Hounds Of Love,&quot; and Side Two &quot;The
Ninth Wave.&quot; The  first side kicks off with the hit single Running Up That
Hill and carries on with four  more individual tunes, while &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;
is a concept side, it's seven songs  combining to tell one story. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even though the first side wasn't conceptual, all the songs are linked
by the fact  that they're about relationships of some kind. They're all love
songs, really.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush says she has a fascination for the psychology of people. &quot;Everybody
does  really.&quot; Running Up That Hill resulted from that keen interest in the
way people  think about each other. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's the idea of people actually making a deal with God, you know, to
just swap  place with each other, and understand what it is like from the other
person's point  of view. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's about trying to bring people together even more. You always
understand  something better once you've experienced it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush isn't too certain about where her musical career will take her
next.  Obviously, her many fans would love the chance to see her live. Is
touring a  possibility? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that's the question that everyone is asking. I really would
like to tour  again, but it's an incredibly big commitment - financially as well
as timewise. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not quite sure what I would want to do as a next project. It could
perhaps  be this film, or a tour or perhaps I'll go straight into another album.
I don't really  want to go from one intense project to another ... that just
seems to be the way it is  for me.&quot;
