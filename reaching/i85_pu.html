<P>KATE BUSH'S HOUNDS OF LOVE: 
</P>
<P>HAVE THE MASSES FINALLY FOUND KATE? 
</P>
<P>To the unacquainted ear, Kate Bush's music may seem esoteric, obscure. To 
millions of followers and admirers, she's Britain's 27-year-old pop genius. Bush
has  proved she can withstand pressure to &quot;go commercial&quot; by sticking
to her blend of  unusual lyrics and mysterious tunes, and still sell records.
Her newest, Hounds of  Love, is biting off Billboard's Hot 200 in 20-position
chunks. 
</P>
<P>Bush, who began recording at age 16, is a former protege of David Gilmour, 
leader of Pink Floyd; a debut single, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, was Europe
and Asia's  big '77 smash. In her London home Bush acknowledges that &quot;It
hasn't changed  much -- things move very quickly for me. I spend quite a bit of
time on an album  and then I have to work hard to make sure it's heard.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The latest of five Bush collections just hit the bins and now Hounds of Love
is  being stacked alongside such long-standing successes as Heart and Motley
Crue.  Before, The Kick Inside, Lionheart, Never For Ever, and The Dreaming were
but  small cult items. But Hounds of Love is even getting Top 40 airplay in the 
disco-takeoff &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot;, now on MTV's
medium  rotation list. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That song is going to puzzle a lot of people,&quot; says Bush. &quot;I
think perhaps the  word God conjures up a sense of religion but it's quite often
used symbolically,&quot;  particularly on her disc. She sings &quot;If I could/
I'd make a deal with God/And get  him to swap our places,&quot; as God is the &quot;only
person who can make the true bond of  love possible.&quot; She laughs: &quot;Hopefully
there are enough people who listen to the  music and see that it's actually not
that religious.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The three years between The Dreaming and Hounds was both a hectic period of 
reorganization and a time of internal growth. Bush shocked London single-buyers 
and American fans by not releasing anything (outside two French-language remixes
 of old songs). She moved herself and the music to the country so &quot;I could
finally have  fun and experiment on Fairlight [synthesizer],&quot; which now
acts as keyboard on  Bush's work. Former melodic tones have been replaced by a
desire to &quot;make the  music stronger.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We bought and equipped our own studios and then recorded all tracks
there. It  made a really big difference.&quot; The Dreaming took two years and
countless pounds of  studio time. In her new digs, &quot;The phone stopped
ringing all the time and it stopped  the pressure [because] you can experiment
without the clock ticking away. I found it  more conducive to the whole creative
process.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush says Hounds of Love serves as &quot;half a concept album, the first
side being  five separate songs.&quot; The flipside's dubbed &quot;The Ninth
Wave&quot; or, &quot;a journey for a  woman asleep on the water: There are
people trying to keep her awake and not let  her fall asleep ['And Dream of
Sheep']. Then she falls asleep and has a dream --  but wakes up from the dream
only to find herself underwater ['Under Ice']. And  then she has hallucinations
where people are saying 'Wake up, wake up, don't sleep  anymore,' and trying to
get her out of the water. Except a witch finder pushes her  right under because
he assumes she's a witch ['Waking the Witch']. Soon she  travels home and see s
her loved ones but they can't see her ['Watching You  Without Me'] and hopefully
it all leads to the hope and salvation of the morning  ['The Morning Fog'] where
everything comes to life again. The sense of loneliness  is taken over by the
sense of someone saving them.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Though that is exemplary of the Bush style -- extreme characters and odd 
concepts -- she has been known to go even further. Several albums ago, &quot;The
 Wedding List&quot; described a protagonist &quot;coming for&quot; the ex-lover
who killed her new  husband. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, the last records tended to be extreme,&quot; she says, noting how
songs that  changed &quot;from mood to mood&quot; made it more difficult for her
to fully get involved  with an entire record. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps there's more of a sense of continuity on this album,&quot; she
comments,  &quot;but that's just my humble subjective opinion.&quot; One thing's
for sure: &quot;It's the  lightest album and the easiest for me emotionally.&quot;

</P>
<P>But being able to &quot;turn ideas into pieces of plastic&quot; has remained
her emotional  high. &quot;What is wonderful is I may read a book or see a movie
and get a lot of visual  imagery. Except the influence won't surface in my music
for maybe ten years,&quot; and  she points to the latest single -- &quot;Cloubusting&quot;
-- as case in point. &quot;I read this book,  The Book of Dreams, [sic] about
nine years ago and reread it during my break. It  was calling to me, this
beautifully written story, through a child's point of view.&quot;  Sighing, she
adds, &quot;When the ideas feel right they just come to the front and sort of 
go, 'Hi there.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Plans of late are &quot;getting on with the next record as soon as possible&quot;
and creating  a full-length video version of &quot;The Ninth Wave.&quot; The
future &quot;isn't really planned. I  hope to keep doing what I do -- but go
into slightly different areas.&quot; Bush calls  herself lucky as her wildest
fantasy is coming true: the ability to remain true to her  inventive mind
without worrying about its results being accepted by the commercial  world. 
</P>
<P>Bush sings about that fantasy on Hounds of Love. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You want my reply?- What was the question? 
</P>
<P>I was looking at the big sky.&quot;
