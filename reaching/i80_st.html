<P>How to write songs and influence people 
</P>
<P>by Derek Jewell 
</P>
<P>The Sunday Times 
</P>
<P>5 October 1980 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill] 
</P>
<P> &quot;I don't want to be managing director of the world,&quot; said Kate
Bush. &quot;I just want  to be managing director of myself.&quot; She seems, at
22, to be well on schedule. 
</P>
<P>Her record company, EMI, didn't want to release a strange piece called  &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; as her first single in 1978 when she was unknown - a fairly 
predictable decision. Heathcliff and Cathy as pop fodder? She insisted, as she
insists  on most things, and this highly original song very swiftly made her
reputation. Her  third album, just released rests high on the charts. 
</P>
<P>Original she undoubtedly is. Her music resolutely resists categories, and
although  you can detect influences, especially traditional music, there has
really been no one  quite like her before. She composes everything, arranges
songs, sings, and plays. She  dances, produces her stage shows, designs the
costumes, and is managing director of  her management company. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is boss, yet doesn't look bossy. She's small, slender,
nip-waisted, with  wildish hair. But the eyes flash quickly within the smile.
Her English father, married  to an Irishwoman, is a doctor who also played jazz
piano. Kate went to a convent at  Abbey Wood, near Woolwich, and was learning
the violin before she was 10. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We lived in a farmhouse. I used to play hymns on an old organ in the
farm until  it was eaten out by mice.&quot; By 11 she was writing poems: at 13
she was mixing music  and words; by 16, Dave Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) had
organised some demo tracks for  her and EMI gave her a contract. She used the
advance money to herself dance  instruction for two years, left the convent and
went to live in London. &quot;As soon as  you leave school, you learn things at
three times the rate.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Through her elder brothers, Jon and Paddy, both of them folk musicians, she 
joined a group. They called it the KT Bush Band. EMI heard her performing in
1977  and decided that she was ready for an album, which was to include two of
the tracks  put down earlier by Gilmour. Since that album, The Kick Inside, the
acclaim has  remained fairly consistent, for both her recorded work and her
brilliant stage shows,  with the exception of the odd maverick put-down in the
fringe music papers. 
</P>
<P>Her new record, Never For Ever, both reflects and expands her already 
remarkable range. There's an odd exoticism there - &quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;Egypt,&quot;
for  example, following &quot;Kashka from Baghdad&quot; on an earlier album -
which stands in  starkest contrast with her feeling for this country. &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; was  succeeded by &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot; on her
second album and by &quot;Delius&quot; her  quirky tribute to the Bradford-born
composer, on her third. 
</P>
<P>This song is an unexpected as &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, an excoriating
piece in which  the lilting music only enhances the lyric. 
</P>
<P>Tears o'er a tin box. <BR> O Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know. <BR> Like a
chicken with a fox. <BR> He cannot win the war with ego. 
</P>
<P> &quot;No, it's not personal. It's just a mother grieving and observing the
waste. A boy  with no O-levels, say, who might have been a pop star, politician
or whatever. But  he's nothing to do, no way to express himself. So he joins the
army. He's trapped.  So many die, often in accidents. I'm not slagging off the
army, because it's good for  certain people. But there are a lot of people in it
who shouldn't be.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Hesitantly, she outlines artists who may have influenced her. The writers 
included Kurt Vonnegut, C. S. Lewis and T.S. Elliot. But her main inspiration
has  been traditional music. &quot;Irish airs, the uillean pipes - music like
that affect me  physically.&quot; The composers for her are Chopin, Debussy,
Sibelius and Erik Satie, and  all of these are named before she comes to modern
popular music. 
</P>
<P>The litany begins with Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley. Billie Holiday is less
 expected. &quot;I heard her when I was 14. I loved her upper range. What she
says with  her voice is so human and vulnerable.&quot; Then, Bowie and Beatles,
Roy Harper and  Roxy Music, Thin Lizzie and Boomtown Rats (&quot;when they began
- not now&quot;), Paul  Simon and Ian Dury. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I love Ian Dury because he says good positive things that will help
people, cheer  them up. I'd be a fool to think I could change the world, but to
influence people,  yes. It's important to spread positivity. Stevie Wonder has a
song, &quot;Love's In Need  Of Love Today,&quot; and every time I hear it, it
makes me feel better. Some writers  concentrate on the negative area. It's
selfish masturbating really, and art's not a  selfish thing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I listen to Leonard Cohen, I get depressed. So many of his songs
are  autobiographical self-indulgent negativity - writing with no hope or
objectivity. One  of my new songs, &quot;All We Ever Look For,&quot; it's not
about me. It's about family  relationships generally. Our parents got beaten
physically. We get beaten  psychologically. The last line - &quot;All we ever
look for - but we never did score.&quot; Well,  that's the way it is - you do
get faced sometimes with futile situations. But the  answers not to kill
yourself. You have to accept it, you have to cope with it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The managing director of herself was in full flood. &quot;I'm not a
businesswoman at  all. I just want to write and play and sing and dance. I don't
feel I'm biting off too  much. I understand my music better than others. I can
judge. They can't. So I'll  cram in everything I can.&quot; A thought seemed to
strike her. &quot;After all, I might not  even be around in five or ten years.&quot;
