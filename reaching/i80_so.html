<P>WHAT THEY say about Kate Bush is that she's a lisping  innocent, a
born-with-a-silver-spoon, a too-good-to-be-true,  a safe and uncontroversial,
soppy, record industry banker.</P>
<P>What l reckon is she's brave and honest, the most sensual  writer/performer
around. For her, forget politico-socio-economics  (which is crucial but not the
only crux). Just feel her. She's very  tactile, music you can touch, sometimes
smell and taste too.  All the senses embraced, like making love -- not as
complete  as experience by any means, sure, but . . . reminiscent.</P>
<P>As she wrote in 'Symphony In Blue': 'The more I think about sex/  The better
it gets/ here we have a purpose in life/ Good for the blood  circulation/ Good
for releasing the tension'.</P>
<P>Doubters should see the front cover of her new LP, 'Never For Ever',  out
next week. Then they might recognize her. There's a painting of  a cartoon Kate
on a hill, the wind blowing her skirt and hem beneath  it issues a billowing
spume of people, devils, animals, monsters, birds,  fish, butterflies --- the
raw material of her songs intact, spreading and  curving like the cornucopia,
horn of plenty. The message is sensually true (hear, see, feel, taste, smell).
Kate Bush's music flows like love juice.</P>
<P><B>'Breathing<BR> Breathing my mother in,<BR> Breathing, my beloved in,<BR>
Breathing, breathing her nicotine,<BR> Breathing,<BR> Breathing the fall-out,
out in'</B>  
</P>
<P>This is how the readers of teeny girl's magazine <EM>Look In</EM>  were
told to think about Kate Bush: 'To every young girl working hard  at dance
classes and learning music, the story of Kate Bush's rise to  fame must seem
like the ultimate fairy story. Few may look as  striking as Kate, and it's
unlikely that many have her incredible  vocal range, but her rise to acclaim
gives us all a model to aspire  to -- showing just how much sheer hard work is
involved in reaching  the top.'</P>
<P>Arsenic and old lace, slow-poisoning gentility. Encouraging aspiration, 
encouraging hard work, while quietly easing the rug from under you. It's  nice
to dream, but honestly you don't have the looks or the talent or the 
determination, do you dears? What you're really rehearsing for, when  these
childish games are over, is a long stint behind me cheese  counter and in front
of the kitchen sink. Your only chance is no chance.</P>
<P>Or, as Kate said when I'd finished quoting it at her: &quot;If I was still
at  school and I read that I'd think 'Christ, I'll just give up and work in 
Woolworth then'. It would scare me life out of me.&quot;</P>
<P>She becomes ever more aware of the difference between Kate Bush  the public
image and Kate Bush the self she knows (which includes  the artist). How could
she be anything but bemused to find herself  described in the <EM>Sun</EM> as
'top sexpot of the year' --  what's that? --and in <EM>Sounds</EM> voted Number
2 'Sex  Object (Female)' -- what's that?</P>
<P>The ephemeral quality of celebrity had just reached a new level  in fact,
she said: &quot;A couple of weeks ago I read the first interview  with me I've
seen which was entirely made up. I had never spoken  to this magazine and there
I was talking about my life and fame and  so on.&quot;</P>
<P>For the past two years she's been coming to terms with the half-truth. Now
it seems she will have to develop her acceptance of the complete  lie. She's
working on it: &quot;It does still worry me that people read things  and take it
as gospel. So much of what you read is propaganda whether  it's political or
show biz.&quot;</P>
<P>She's been taken advantage of by people striding in with an 'I'm your 
greatest fan' smile, then tearing her apart in print. Very nasty, but she 
insist to herself that &quot;they are all forgivable&quot;, even the ones who go
 away and give her a hard time for being too nice to them.</P>
<P>&quot;What do they expect? Do they want me to rip the place apart? The 
thing is when I'm on stage I can do anything. I have a role to play.  Off-stage
it's hard for me to be anyone but myself which is a rather  shy,
philosophical...little thing.&quot;</P>
<P>'Little thing'! In moments like that you can see how she has set  some
people's teeth on edge with a mawkish word and a flash  of the dimple high on
her left cheek. We were setting out on a  five-hour interview. If the schoolgirl
coquette had struck the  keynote it would have been unbearable. But Kate Bush
was  22 on July 30. She's not like that anymore. The jokes about her  saying
amazing' and 'wow' all the time have worn thin.</P>
<P>Her own genuine fear that she is boring when she doesn't  have a role to
play is quite wrong now, if i twas ever true  except in the self-fulfiling
anticipations of many journalists.  The feat itself may still be hampering her
though. For  instance, she invariably chooses the matt-finish neutral  territory
of the EMI office for interviews: she takes her  self out of context. So I can
offer you no significant  details, no atmosphere. We were plonked down among 
someone else's business clutter with sandwiches  wrapped in plastic and drinks
from the tin.</P>
<P>Kate was wearing a lot of red and a lot of make-up --  one rough soul in the
vicinity remarked that she seemed  to have 'tarted herself up' way beyond her
usual daily  casualness, probably because she knew Mike Laye  would be sitting
in (although he didn't take any pictures  as it happened). Later she did say she
had been nervous  because we had both deliberately built it up to her as 'a  big
one'.</P>
<P><B>'My radar sends me danger<BR> But my instincts tell me to<BR> Keep
breathing'</B> 
</P>
<P>So let me introduce you first to Kate Bush the professional.  Of course,
there are many in her position who, if they were  worried enough by an interview
to be nervious, wouldn't do it.  She does have the power to decide not to be
bothered with  any of the show biz process apart from the music. Instead she 
quotes from whoever-it-was and steps out saying &quot;As long as  they spell my
name right!&quot;</P>
<P>She's the girl who goes along to pick up the awards in person  when others
send their fridges to take delivery. She's the one  you see in the papers the
next morning pulling silly faces and  pointing at Alan Freeman who's pointing at
her, or standing  with her arm matily round fellow EMI earner Cliff Richard's 
shoulder, or scrunched between Bob Geldof, Paul McCartney  and an armful of
shields and plaques. Usually at these moments  she looks quite barmy, but at
least a hundred percent more  alive than the company she's keeping.</P>
<P><A HREF="i80_so_a.jpg">(Photos referred to above)</A> 
</P>
<P>Why?</P>
<P>&quot;I'll always play up for photographers. I can't stand there  looking
miserable, it'll get printed anyway. To cope I have  to play the complete loon,
I do have to keep my face in  the papers you know. I need the publicity.&quot;</P>
<P>She meant it, although the last couple of phrases  did come out rather as if
they'd been learnt by rote  from 'Teach Yourself Show Biz'. Tactically it seemed
 to me she was underrating herself again. On the other  hand the bare-faced,
uncool honesty of her was more  than striking.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't like show biz. I very rarely go to parties. If  I go to one of
these dos it's because people have  been good to make the effort for vote for me
and I  think I should say 'Thank you' rather than 'I can't be  bothered to come,
send it round.' &quot;</P>
<P>The choking unctuousness and obsequious  gluttony of those affairs is enough
to turn your  stomach and I dragged up a quote from Kate's  past which suggested
she had been suckered  into the rotten opulence of it. According to another  of
those teen'n'weens mags she had spouted on  about what 'a great honour it is to
be part of this  business'.</P>
<P>&quot;If I said it I didn't mean exactly that. The honour  is to know that
people like me to be here and make  my music and explore. Behind the business 
propaganda there <EM>is</EM> a connection  between the artist and the public
which is real.  Take these Personal Appearances (<EM>'PAs'  they say in the
trade</EM>). You go to a shop  and you're like some kind of royal person put  on
a pedestal and the people are led to you  as if it was to kiss your feet.
They're forced to  buy an album to get your autograph.</P>
<P>&quot;That part of it is horrible, but I like them because  I meet all these
faces full of therir own lives. It's  really special to me. I do it because
there's  something human and good in it rather than  refusing because it's not
perfect.</P>
<P>&quot;But if it wasn't for my music I wouldn't come near  a situation like
this (<EM>a glance took in our little  room and its large implications</EM>).
It would  scare the shit out of me. There was a time when  I would never have
signed myself away to any  record company. But what I wanted more than  anything
else was to get my songs on to an album.  EMI were interested and there were
willing to wait  (<EM>giving her a few thousand pounds and a  couple of years
to 'grow up' with</EM>).</P>
<P>&quot;Everyone's doing everyone up and you have to  minimise that. My way
isn't one of forcefulness, I  like to talk to people on a mutual level. I've had
 to work and prove myself to people which I find  a great challenge. There are
so many aspects to  people...Fred isn't just nice Fred, he's bad Fred,  Fred
that's cuddly, Fred when he's been drinking.  It does get terrifying.&quot;</P>
<P>When her name, demos and pictures were first  introduced to the majority of
the EMI staff at an  annual convention, the mainly male gathering  nudged,
winked and said &quot;Wor, I wouldn't mind  handling her, boss!&quot; Some also
noticed that  'Wuthering Heights' was a smash hit waiting to  be pressed. If it
had failed she would have been  crushed in the cogs of the corporation. As it
is,  success is her passport through the long corridors.  In this sense her
greatest step forward on 'Never  For Ever' is that she moved up to co-production
 with her everpresent engineer Jon Kelly.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm free in lots of ways and I'm getting more free,  more artistic
control. The first two albums were a  matter of proving I was a reasonably
intelligent  and creative human being who could produce  their own project. A
great deal of artists aren't  capable of being objective enough. To be close 
with everyone involved and though their respect  and enthusiasm create what you
have been  thinking about for over a year is a beautiful experience.</P>
<P><B>'Out-in, out-in, out-in...'</B>  
</P>
<P>IF SHE is growing out of being 'the company's  daughter', as one former EMI
executive described  her, she is showing no signs of becoming any  less her
family's daughter. Most of her business  interests seems to come under the wing
of  Novercia Ltd, the board of directors consisting of  Kate, her father, mother
and two brothers. She  still lives in Lewisham in a house owned by her  father
and split into three flats, one let to each of  his children.</P>
<P>Older brother John is a constant advisor and  has again designed one side of
the album sleeve.  Paddy features on 'Never For Ever' playing an  extraordinary
range of stringed and other  instruments: balalaika, strumento de porco, sitar, 
koto, musical saw, banshee and mandolin  (I  don't know what all of these are,
but Paddy  probably made some of them himself as that's  his trade).</P>
<P>Clearly it's an uncommon closeness which is  a source of strength and
reassurance to her even though she's a much more confident person now  than when
she first faced up to those heavy business  people at 16. No outsider can
pretend to analyse  that blood chemistry, but the impression created  certainly
hasn't helped her 'credibility' (a pretty  elitist expression in itself when you
think about it).</P>
<P>Artists are supposed to suffer. It's always  been true. Punk emphasized the
point the year  before Kate Bush was so carefully launched  and there are no
visible signs that she meets  the standard required. &quot;I'm always presented 
as this middle-class girl whose father is a  doctor,&quot; she complained and
described how  both her father and ' her Irish mother came  from ordinary
country families, no wealth at all . . .</P>
<P>But she could hardly take the protest very far.  She happens to have been
born to the generation  of Bushes that got rich quite quick. It's not her  fault
and you can see why she resents catching  flak for it. Eager for experience as
she is,  poverty is one thing she will never be able to  sample anywhere but in
her imagination.</P>
<P>However, accept her for what she is in class  terms and you see that her
character at least  reacted very creatively to those things that only  money can
buy. Time, space, solitude, a piano  standing idle, a father who could show her 
middle C and leave her to clang about to her  heart's content until she had
learnt to play in an  individual style. Freedom to express herself,  fantasize,
write poetry on the walls if she felt like  it as John had done before her. Then
protection for her  talent when it emerged so that it wasn't beaten  into early
submission like 99 out of a 100 on the  city streets. </P>
<P>Not suffering, but sensitive to life's potential for  pain, perhaps she
mused vapourously about the  futility of life and wove those adolescent 
generalizations to her early feelings about  'the punctual blues' (her periods,
mentioned in  'Strange Phenomena'). She talked, &quot;philosophized&quot;,  with
her brothers and they stirred her interest in  mystics like Gurdjiieff and
Khalil Ghibran.</P>
<P>I know next to nothing of these people and  couldn't begin to say how
they've influenced her  in detail. It seems though that while nothing  much was
happening on the surface of her life  she was gathering an enormous thrust of 
emotion from heart and head which was  positive, idealistic, optimistic. It's
one strong  reason why so many people like her now.</P>
<P>She still expresses it hesitantly, but with a passion:  &quot;It's so hard
to look at people you love so much  and see things which are screwing them up  .
. . reading things about Gurdjieff or the Bible  give some comfort, they make
you feel you <EM>can</EM> do something about it. The connection, getting 
through the barriers to people is the thing . . . continually swilling in ego
isn't what I want to  do. I want to be a perfect person. I think  everyone does.&quot;</P>
<P><B>'I love my beloved,<BR> All and everywhere,<BR> Only the fools blew
it,<BR> You and me knew <BR> Life itself is breathing'</B>  
</P>
<P>HEREWITH what I think about Kate Bush  aher listening to her music and
talking to her  at length.</P>
<P>Her words and sounds are a sensual sexual  fantastic romance -- of reality.
She often goes  a-wuthering like Emily Bronte out on the wiley,  windy moors of
nonsense, then she drops like a  hawk and grabs you by the balls -- of your
mind.  She's totally hot -- heart, head and body. That's  the leaping landscape
of her country, the frantic  story flying through your brain all the time at an 
erratic tangent to the functions your hands and  feet are fulfilling.</P>
<P>She is a conscious artist, committed to  the ideal of moulding moving,
meaningful  substance out of the ether like a sculptor  pumelling the rubbish
away from the true shape in the stone. So far she has given only the slighntst
hints that she can become one  of the greats who turn you upside down with 
sound (Springsteen, Aretha, Dylan, Little Feat  among them for me) I'd say
'Moving', 'The Man  With The Child In His Eyes' and 'Breathing' go  close.</P>
<P>She's constantly calling things 'beautful'. she  has a strong emotional and
aesthetic idea of  what she means by it. She means to achieve it in  her work.
She trains and practices rigorously to  that end, habitually puts in 18-hour
days when  she's recording or on the road. If she has genius  within her it will
not escape unemployed.</P>
<P>The energetic tolerance she directs  towards journalists who misrepresent
her  embraces her whole attitude to life.</P>
<P>&quot;We're all innocent,&quot; she'll say or &quot;They're  all human
beings after all&quot;. This helps her in the  artist's role as observer. She
doesn t judge,  she empathises .</P>
<P>But this liberality, her undeniable nicenesss  may sometimes undermine her
will to criticise  herself. Particularly in the light of her new  album,
'Lionheart' looks complacent -- or  maybe at least a sigh of relief that 'The
Kick  Inside' had done the trick. Secure and cossetted  as she has been it must
be difficult to fight back the inertia that sits in every soul.</P>
<P>Her voice with that 'incredible range' is a  very peculiar instrument. In
some ways it is  boundless, from rich contralto to squealing  hyper-soprano. No
problem with hitting the  notes all right if they were scattered across the  sky
and the ocean bed. Her emotional range is  much narrower though.</P>
<P>Sure, 'Wuthering Heights' tickled the fancy of  a million or so, but what
else can you do with  that turkey-gobbling noise? (Ah, you noticed, I  don t
like that one.) One answer is to come up  with other gimmick voices -- the
catlike  mewing of 'Lionheart', the banshee yowling of  'Violin' and the crazed
grotesque of 'Wedding  List' on 'Never For Ever'. Any of them can  raise
eyebrows and smiles for a track or two  and her vocal surprise will carry on
<EM>entertaining</EM>  for as long as she can pull them off.</P>
<P>Can her voice project the tenderness and  passion she's capable of writing
though? Hear  her speak, an endearing female version of Frank  Spencer in 'Some
Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em', and  you wonder. The sheer grit of some of her favourite 
singers such as Billie Holiday and Lotte Lenya  seem pretty remote. Yet she did
achieve a fairly  straight intensity on 'The Man With The Child In  His Eyes'
and her often weird and strangulated  tones seem to suit the seriousness of
'Breathing'.</P>
<P>Can you imagine that voice tackling the set of  covers the KT Bush Band
played in the pubs of  Lewisham in her mid-teens? 'Honky Tonk  Women', 'Come
Together', 'Sweet Soul Music',  Heard It Through The Grapevine', 'Sailin 
Shoes'? Well, it happened and no doubt she will  go on exploring her vocal
chonds as she did  the piano and hopefully she'll find the Bush blues  in there
somewhere.</P>
<P>The search will certainly be conducted with  humour about herself-there are
more vocal  laughs than ever on the new album and did you notice the end of the
'Babooshka' video where  she mimes the deep male voice?7 I reckon she  nicked it
from the horse singing bass on Laurel  And Hardy's 'Trail Of The Lonesome Pine'.</P>
<P><B>'Ooh, please let me breathe,<BR> Quick, breathe in deep<BR> Leave us
something to breathe'</B>  
</P>
<P>I asked Kate about Moving, the first song  on 'The Kick Inside' and her most
fitting  blend of word and sound so far. It's a complete  evocation of the
movement of the dancer,  speaking with his limbs, sense through  sensuality, as
sexy as his 'beauty's potency',  the dancer and the watcher in harmony like
lovers.</P>
<P>So I asked her what whale noises were doing in  there. &quot;Whales say
everything about 'moving'.  It's huge and beautiful, intelligent, soft inside  a
tough body. It weighs a ton and yet it's so light it  floats. It's the whole
thing about human communication  -- 'moving liquid, yet you are just as water'
-- what the  Chinese say about being the cup the water moves in  to. The whales
are pure movement and pure sound,  calling for something, so lonely and sad...</P>
<P>&quot;On the ground they're ppff (<EM>splodging sound</EM>),  but in the
water they're 'wahooo!' Which is the way with  a lot of dancers.&quot; </P>
<P>The song/dance dovetail is one of the ideals she's  pursued in her stage
show, TV special, and videos.  She can trace her love of movement back to when 
she was a tot.</P>
<P>&quot;My father told me I used to dance to the  music on the telly. I
remember it vaguely. It was  completely un-selfconscious and I wasn't aware  of
people looking at me. One day some people  came into the room, saw me and
laughed and  from that moment I stopped doing it. I think  maybe I've been
trying to get back there ever  since.&quot; </P>
<P>'Moving' is dedicated to Lindsay Kemp who  led her into rediscovering
herself with an inspiring  performance and a series of 50p lessons in the public
 classes he gave. </P>
<P>&quot;He needed a song written to him. He  opened up my eyes to the meanings
of movement.  He makes you feel so good. If you've got two left  feet it's 'you
dance like an angel darling.' He fills  people up, you're an empty glass and
glug, glug, glug,  he's filled you with champagne.&quot; </P>
<P>With dance, mime, and elaborate costume, Kate's  performances are hardly
your standard rough and ready  rock shows. They are rehearsed down to fine
detail and  she values exact execution far above 'spontaneity', which  again
scores black marks against her name in some books.  So it was interesting to
hear her reactions to the last night  of the tour when nothing went according to
plan. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The roadies were all very creative people and  suddenly as a sort of
goodbye to us, they were all joining  in the show. There were crowds of cowboys
and indians, a  crocodile. During Egypt a panto camel walked in. I went  after
it and it tried to run away, but I got it by the tail, pulled  it back and there
were these voices protesting from inside,  'Leggo!' &quot; </P>
<P>That is, she loved it. Kate Bush wants to create an  illusion, not a
machine. </P>
<P><B>'Breathing the fall out-in, out-in, out-in'</B> 
</P>
<P>My imagination runs like a non-stop B-movie  with me as the star -- unless
I'm daydreaming about sport  in which case I'm always the commentator for
reasons I'll  leave to the psychoanalysts amongst you. It gives me  excitement,
a savour of heroism, free trial runs of  situations I expect to face. Kate
agreed it was her  version of that parallel reality which went into most of  her
songs, stories so far away from the suburban  convent schoolgirl. </P>
<P>&quot;For instance, I really like guns. Not what  they do, but detach them
from their purpose and  they're... fantastic, beautiful. And yet, they're
designed  to kill which is against everything I believe in.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She talked with relish about the gun used by the  assassin in 'The Day Of
The Jackal' and with fascinated  horror about dum-dum bullets (she was well up
on the  technical details):</P>
<P>&quot;How someone can even think about lining  a bullet with mercury so that
it rips another human apart  is incredible. I'd never shoot anything living at
all. I was  always given dolls when I was a little girl of course, so  maybe if
they had given me guns I wouldn't have had  this thing. Unless I'm trying to get
back at all these people  shooting me...&quot; </P>
<P>She looked at Mike and he countered with an astute  enquiry about the
routine she did on stage with 'James  and the Cold Gun' which produced the much
used stills  showing her licking the rifle barrel and firing from the  crotch,
raw phallic gestures. She skipped around that  for a moment though. </P>
<P>&quot;I was brought up on movies: love, revenge,  and death. Violence when
used correctly can be a  brilliant instrument in entertainment. Or it can be
disgusting.  Normally in 'James' we used bits of red felt to represent  blood,
but one night we used capsules and spurted the  stuff all over the place and the
audience loved it. They like  strong imagery.&quot; </P>
<P>Throughout the interview she kept coming back to films,  TV and other
people's art, as the starting points for many of  her songs. Forever fantasy.
She accepted it: </P>
<P>&quot;Each of them comes from something that makes  me go 'Wow!' Most of the
films I've drawn from were shown  when I was a kid, which is strange. They've
taken ten  years to work through my system and go &quot;oo-ee!&quot;.  I know if
makes me a thief, but the material is digested and  changed, like with 'Infant
Kiss' (<EM>new LP, more below</EM>).  In fact it's very difficult using a film
story because they're so  long and you have to precis so much. Sometimes I feel
I  only get half of it across.&quot; </P>
<P>Another of her favorite fantasies is the exotic setting.  There's 'Saxophone
Song' in Berlin, 'Kashka From Baghdad'  and 'Egypt'. She hadn't been to any of
these places and  ignorance seems almost a necessity to her to preserve  a pure,
free flow of imagination. </P>
<P>'Saxophone Song' was one of her earliest, written  when she was about 15. It
curled us in closer to the  roots of her music: </P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes chord structures make you think  of a place... and I love
saxophones so I wanted to write  a song about them. I think of a beautiful sax
like a human  being, a sensuous shining man being taken over by the  instrument.
The perfect setting was this smokey bar in  Berlin with nobody listening except
me in a corner,  the streams of light flashing off it to me, pa pa  (<EM>explosion
noises</EM>).&quot; </P>
<P>In the song she is a '<EM>surly lady in tremor... You'll  never know you
had all of me</EM>.' Mike suggested that  Freud would have made a meal of this
one too, and this  time, as she's fond of phrasing it, she broke through the 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm very basic,&quot; she said. &quot;I wasn't  thinking of it as
phallic when I wrote the song, but I do  now when I see a sax player. I feel if
everyone understood  the real things I'm saying, it wouldn't be much good, it 
wouldn't help me. If it seems harmless on the surface  that's all right. I don't
want to upset people who don't  want to know. There are enough people, thank
God,  who have seen it. They're listening with their hearts. </P>
<P>&quot;The sax is a very sexual sound, all vibrating,  resonating - like
bowels. Look at photos of musicians  playing any instruments and it could be
interpreted... it's  not always sexual, but mainly. You are cuddling the 
instrument, you are seducing each other. Guitarists  are up there so obviously
waking with their guitars,  but it's open, beautiful, it's at a love level.&quot;
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is in an awkward position. She pour  out passion unbridled, and
then hopes that only the  'right' people will notice. For instance, she would
hate 
<EM>The News of The World</EM> to understand her  though they're welcome to
print her picture any time  they like. So far her luck has held. Her acceptable 
show biz face has proved a perfect disguise under  the spotlight. </P>
<P><B>'Breathing, Breathing my mother in, Breathing, my beloved in, Breathing,
breathing her nicotine, Breathing'</B>      
</P>
<P>A FEW DAYS before the interview I'd watched  the Peter Finch film of Oscar
Wilde's life on TV.  In court a poem by Oscar's young lover Bosey is  read out
which refers to '<EM>the love that dares not  speak its name</EM>'. Kate Bush
dares, dares speak  the name of any love -- even when she doesn't  know it
('Infant Kiss' is about paedophilia all right,  but she claimed she'd never
heard the word  before we mentioned it to her).</P>
<P>The technical terms and harsh 'morals' don't  enter into it, sensual love is
supreme, the juice  flows, the treasures of the horn of plenty are  boundless .
. . do you remember the 'Wow'  video, when at the fine 'He's too busy hitting
the  vaseline', she cocked her bum out and slapped  it saucily to tell
interested, slow-witted parties like  me that it was nothing to do with the
clapped-out star  taking his make-up off after all.</P>
<P>Dangerous territories? &quot;That's why I think  they're so fascinating. So
many love songs stay  in such a light, unreal area. If I write one it has to  be
focused on an energy I can really feel. Mostly  it can't be just 'a man and a
woman'.&quot;</P>
<P>'Kashka From Baghdad' is about a happy  homosexual couple who overcome
prying eyes  and vicious tongues by keeping themselves to  themselves and
enjoying it: 'At night they're  seen /  Laughing, loving/  They know the way/ To
 be happy'.</P>
<P>I asked her why she'd taken the objective role  of the outsider looking in
rather becoming the  voice of the central character as she often does.  No
cop-out she said: &quot;It would have been very  difficult to make people
understand I was singing  as a man in that scene. That's a problem  sometimes. A
lot of people don't realise I'm a  little boy in 'Peter Pan' and a male who a 
female is trying to poison in 'Coffee  Homeground'.&quot;</P>
<P>The voice of 'The Kick Inside' comes from a girl who is pregnant by her
brother and is about to kill herself to save her family from the scandal of
exposure. Kate curved in towards the topic via some reflections on the  delicate
balance of sexuality in every  relationship:</P>
<P>&quot;Men, friends, get very close to each other.  At what point does it
become sexual? Love <EM>can</EM>  be very strong and not sexual.</P>
<P><EM>&quot;It's the same with my brothers. I see them  as men and I see them
as attractive, but there  is no sexual content in the relationship. I  suppose
there's never been much physical  contact . . . well, most relationships <EM>are</EM>
platonic.</EM> 
</P>
<P>&quot;The story of 'The Kick Inside' was taken from a folk song. It is a
pure love, it starts  so innocently ('<EM>You and me on the bobbing knee</EM>')
 There are no demands between them except the  most basic ones. I mean, I find I
can trust my  brothers more than anyone else because they  know me so well. We
were brought up in the  same way, in the same house, with the same  games and
just a few years between us. It's as if  we were reflections of each other.&quot;</P>
<P>In 'Infant Kiss' a woman is tucking a child in  for the night when something
happens which  sets her whole life sliding away: '<EM>What is this?  an infant
kiss/ That sends my body tingling/ I've  never fallen for/ A little boy before/
No control/ ...All my barriers are going/ It's starting to show/  Let go, let
go/ ...There's a man behind those eyes/  I catch him when I'm bending/ Ooh, how
he frightens me</EM>'.</P>
<P>Kate was inspired by 'The Innocents', a British 50s film version of the
novel 'The Turn Of The Screw' by Henry James, a disturbing tome which snakes its
way between occultism and Victorian hang-ups  about sex.</P>
<P>Her explanation of the song is interesting: &quot;I was imagining that
moment of the nanny giving  him a little peck goodnight and he gives her a 
great big adult kiss back. The emotional tearing  inside her. There's a
psychotic man inside this  innocent child, a demon, and that's who this 
straight woman is feeling attracted to. It's such a  horrific, distorted idea
it's really quite beautiful.&quot;</P>
<P>Uhuh. But remembering her remarks about  the trials of precis-ing it seems
to me the  emphasis of 'Infant Kiss' is on the heat of the  woman's response
while the boy is less a devil  than a child with a man in his eyes. Every little
 lad's got whiskers beneath the skin after all. And  we've all got nipples come
to that. Gets  confusing dunnit? But sensuality rubs, on and on,  and Kate Bush,
full of hope, finds it hard to be evil.</P>
<P>These three songs are one thing, out on the  frontier, but that
sensual/sexual thrust is in her  every line, that cornucopia, the deluge. We
asked  her about it: &quot;I don't know, your own sexuality  is something very
wavery, you rely on other people to prop it up for you. Maybe the female finds
it harder than the male; worrying so much about  how you look, age is such a
problem . . . although  males get in in much deeper areas, conditioned  at
school and by parents, treat women as 'wahayl',  and never cry, and 'take your
drink like a man'.</P>
<P>&quot;I have trouble with the domestic me. That's  what I mean about lacking
in the feminine areas.  Marrying, having kids, washing and cooking. I  mean,
when I'm at home I love to cook and clean  the place up. But work is a different
me, work is  a love and how could I do that <EM>and</EM> bring up a  child? So
many women with families find they  have wasted their education and they can't
go  back.</P>
<P>&quot;So I won't have had being a mother and  making a little home for my
man to come back  to. And I don't feel a need for that security now,  but
possibly I will.&quot;</P>
<P>Okay, so that was part of it. But Mike said we  weren't really thinking of
her sexuality in terms of  the kitchen sink. The previous day he'd seen the 
'Babooshka' video and later 'found himself' in a  strip club. He suggested that
the dancing styles  weren't dissimilar. And that 'Lionheart' cover: the  pose,
minus lion skin, could have come out of 'Mayfair' . . .</P>
<P>&quot;People were really worried about that cover  because they said I
shouldn't look sexual. I told  them we had a song about bestiality on the  album
so it was quite appropriate (<EM>joke! stop  poring over that lyric sheet</EM>).
It was difficult not to  either be sexy or look Iike the lion from 'The  Wizard
Of Oz'.</P>
<P>&quot;I've decided I can't judge. People say the  'Babooshka' video is sexy,
but all I can see is that  I haven't tumed my foot out or fully extended my  arm
or there's a bit of make-up smudged or you  can see there's a gap between my
teeth.&quot;</P>
<P>The strip-show comparison had been tickling  her and she got to it: &quot;Yeah.
I am opening my  arms as wide as I can and bringing them all in  (<EM>she swept
in an armful of air</EM>). Because when  you go out there in front of hundreds
of people  your knees are knocking and all you want to say is 'I'll do anything
only please stay!' &quot; (<EM>Her invocation  to 'The Lionhearts' on the album
of that name read 'do  what you will with me but this is for you'</EM>. )</P>
<P>&quot;There are basic things, cross your arms,  turn your back, you are
rejecting the audience.  Open your arms, face them, and you are  inviting --
like a strip lady.&quot;</P>
<P>I said that made the connection with the  masturbatory -- maybe 'autoerotic'
has a sweeter  romance to it -- feeling shimmering through many  of her songs.
There's that man with the child in his  eyes who's there 'when I turn the light
off', the gorgeous  seduction of 'Feel It', '<EM>Feel your warm hand walking 
around/ l won't pull away, my passion always  wins/ So keep on a-moving in/
Synchronise  rhythms now</EM>'; the masked figure coming out of  the night in
'L'Amour Looks Something Like You'  who she's dying to touch '<EM>And feel the
energy  rushing right up-a-me/ . . . the thought of you  sends me shivering/ . .
. With that feeling of sticky  love inside</EM>'; and the mellow old pro of 'In
The  Warm Room' who'll let you watch her undress,  '<EM>Go places where your
fingers king to linger/  . . . Say hello, to the soft musk of her hollows</EM>'.</P>
<P>&quot;It's not such an open thing for women to be  physically attracted to
the male body and  fantasise about it. A lot women I know if they see  a mate
pin-up think it's funny. I can't understand  that because to me the mate body is
absolutely  beautfful.</P>
<P>&quot;There's emotional masturbating too.  Wanking away on your knees and
thinking you  know everything. But physical masturbation,  it's feeling so
bottled up you have to relieve itas  you ware crying.&quot;</P>
<P>So what did the 'Never For Ever' cover painting  mean to her? &quot;A lot of
people think it's hilarious  that all the ideas are coming out from under my 
skirt. But the good and bad things pour out of me  in the form of music. It's
terrible, it comes out like  diarrhoea!</P>
<P>&quot;And it's to hint that so much of it comes from  a sexual need, from
inside me, though it could  also be from my stomach, my side . . .  excretions.
We had to be careful with the title  because of all that, there was my skirt
blowing  about, but there couldn't be anything about 'wind'  in it or that would
make the whole album one big  fart.&quot;</P>
<P><B>'Ooh, life is -<BR> Breathing'</B></P>
<P>I ASKED her whether she thought of her music as being distinctively female
-- taking  'Room For The Life' from 'The Kick Inside' an  example.</P>
<P>&quot;People thought that song was feminist which  disappointed me. It was
actually saying we  should go a bit easier on men because we are the  ones with
survival inside us, we carry the next  generation, we have the will to keep
going, we  keep bouncing back.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know it that's anti-liberationist but I  wouldn't say <EM>femininity</EM>
was very strong in my  songs. I've always felt there was something  lacking in
my feminine ... role, do I mean? Being  brought up with two brothers I'd sit
philosophising  with them while my girlfriends wanted to talk  about clothes and
food. Maybe it's the male  energy to be the hunter and I feel I have that in 
me.&quot;</P>
<P>'Room For The Life' portrays woman in  exactly that way: 'Plaiting her hair
by the fire,  women/ With no lover to free her desire/ how  long do you think
she can stick it out/ How long do  you think before she goes out, women/ Hey get
up  on your feet and go get it now'.</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm writing . . . I've tried to explain this  and people think
I'm weird . . . I've been playing  something for a couple of hours and I'm
almost in  a trance. At two or three in the morning you can  actually see bits
of inspiration floating about and  grab them (<EM>she mimed it, like snatching
at a fly</EM>).  Someone comes in and says 'Hello' and I hit the  calling I'm so
shocked. I think in that state I'm  almost split from my body and I'm not
conscious  of being female. Playing the piano, it's leading  you too, it's the
heart speaking and it's not male  or female, it could be an animal, a glass, a
piece  of stone.</P>
<P>&quot;That's the beautiful thing about writing, it's  pure spirit and you
can be anything you  want. Even your voice doesn't matter. I can pretend to be,
mm' Frank Sinatra. It gets difficult again when I come to recording because then
I have to accept the voice I've got. That's the frustration I feel with dancing
too, there are terrible limitations. Only two arms and two legs and you want to
be a violin or a cat or a bird. You pretend, but you're still stuck inside your
body and every year you're getting closer to being stiff and arthritic . . .&quot;</P>
<P>For all her ability to concentrate she is becoming aware that it doesn't
necessarily lead her where she wants to go. To date her musical style has
struggled to go beyond idiosyncratic balladeering.</P>
<P>&quot;I love rock 'n' roll and yet I find when I write the piano will stop
me doing certain things. An idea will develop, I want it to rock, then a tune
will come and it's nothing like it . . . as if I couldn't control its direction.&quot;</P>
<P>She's trying to take a hold by changing her methods for the first time in
some years. She's working with a rhythm machine and. synthesiser to inject more
&quot;oomph&quot;  also writing poems/lyrics separately, to be fetched up
against a melody later.</P>
<P><B>&quot;We've lost our chance,<BR> we're the first and last,<BR> After
the blast...<BR> But my instincts tell me to<BR> Keep breathing</B></P>
<P>OKAY, so if you were Kate Bush you'd  probably be optimistic. That said,
it's hardly unwelcome among all the bad-news messages to hear from someone
saying '<EM>We humans got it all, we perform the miracles</EM>' ('Them Heavy
People')</P>
<P>In 'Symphony In Blue' she confronts her hope  with its opposite, her
'terrible fear of dying'. In a  sense it's a good theme for her as nobody can 
say she's underqualified to deal with it because  she didn't grow up in a
council block -- it's both  abstract and personal.</P>
<P>Apart from the cheery sex manual lines I  quoted at the start her answer to 
'that feeling of  meaninglessness' is fulfilling her role, her music,  '<EM>now
I know that I'm needed/ For the symphony</EM>'.</P>
<P>But that's just a nice, fragile joke. In her songs of  imagination rather
than experience death is a  solid enemy, the dumb numb negative if  sensuality
is the sensational positive. It  stretches her  two ways still. </P>
<P>&quot;There was something in the news about a guy  they found on the Heath
who went out in his car,  soaked himself in petrol and set fire to himself.  
Normally that kind of suicide is for a martyrdom  to a cause, but this man. . .
why have such a  painful death except  to say to people how far he'd  gone?&quot;</P>
<P>Combatting the despair she turns to the stories  of people who have 'died'
momentarily and  recovered, among them her mother.</P>
<P>&quot;When I was little my mother fainted for no  apparent reason. My father
was there and put  her on the bed, but he couldn't feel any pulse so  he started
doing artificial respiration and so on  to try to revive her. Meanwhile,
according to my  mum, she'd taken off like a balloon and hit the  ceiling. She
was looking down from there at my  father pushing her body about and she was 
calling out 'leave me alone, I'm all right!'</P>
<P>&quot;Then I walked in asking 'where's my mum?'  and when she saw me she
dropped back down  into her body, she says, and anyway she did  come back to
life. I know it could be some kind  of defence hysteria, but so many people have
 had that sort of experience.&quot;</P>
<P>Life and poetry move in mysterious ways.  Some 'symbols' bite back. In
'Moving' Kate  wrote to the dancer '<EM>You crush the lily in my  soul</EM>' --
the  lily being the flower of death, the  dancer the love/life bringer.</P>
<P>Well, once someone sent her a bunch of lillies:  &quot;They're  incredible
flowers. They don't look real,  almost . . .putrid. I had the kettle on the gas
when I  was unwrapping them and the cellophane caught  light and set fire to my
hair. I put that out all right  and left the lillies in a vase on the telly.
Then when  I went to switch it on later they tipped up and  soaked me. Fire,
water, they were attacking me  with the elements. It was very strange.&quot;</P>
<P><B>'Ooh, life is --<BR> Breathing<BR> Out-in, out-in, out-in...'</B></P>
<P>BREATHING' is Kate Bush's triumph. Its sensuality so intense it becomes
sense, a higher meaning than moral or  political analysis. It's not perfect.
Very few will  be convinced that she's got the whole nuclear  power/weapons
situation sussed because she  can lob out a line like '<EM>Chips of plutonium
are  twinkling in every lung</EM>'.</P>
<P>But what she's got vibrating in every cell of  her body is the positive, her
feeling for life  force, her awareness and concentration on the  elemental
process of breathing as pure as a  new-born baby or a wrinkled yogi, her 
entranced absorption in it until the mundane  chemistry, oxygen in carbon
dioxide out,  becomes the ultimate love making love.</P>
<P>&quot;When we were doing the track in the studio  someone from EMI came down
and caught the  'in-out, in-out' bit and said 'You're not seriously  thinking of
releasing this are you?'  He really  thought it was all pornographic! I suppose
it's that  Freudian thing. But 'Breathing in-out', it's like the  tide, the
elements are so sensual more than  anything humans' can do -- like snow, it
doesn't  just change the look of everything, the acoustic is  completely
different too. Just touch textures, it's  so sensual and often it comes back to
sex.</P>
<P>&quot;The misinterpretation I was worried about  was that people would think
I was exploiting the  nuclear issue being in the news. I certainly had  no
intention of exploiting tragedy -- though I do  wonder how much good someone
like me can  do. People have said to me 'Send a copy to the  Ayatollah' or
whoever . . . music can get through  but those leaders are on such a strange
level . . .  I don't know &quot;</P>
<P>Dabbling, naive, way adrift of reality in  moments like that, no doubt. But
if destructive  cynicism is your reaction it's a nosedive on to  concrete. Under
the house-of-cards argument  the positive is pulsing.</P>
<P>&quot;It was uncanny making the video because  it was so apt. I was inside
three transparent  plastic inflatables to represent the womb. Zipped  up tight
and they were pumping oxygen in to me.  Then it would steam up and they had to
open it out  so the air blasted into me and it felt so good. That  really helped
me -- like when I was young there was  a stage when I would lie in bed and
suddenly  think 'My God, I'm breathing', and become very  aware of it . . .</P>
<P>&quot;That song was terribly important to me. more  than anything else. From
the writing, arranging,  production viewpoints, everything, that's my little 
symphony. Before I put the lead vocal on the  backing track alone made me want
to cry it was  so perfect.</P>
<P>&quot;From all the hard talking we had with the  musicians they suddenly
stopped thinking about  the technical side and played from their hearts, so 
much love in it. Music is . . . you have to break  your back before you even
start to speak the  emotion.&quot;. </P>
