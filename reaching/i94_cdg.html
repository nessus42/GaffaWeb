Newcombe&quot; &lt;kln@crl.com&gt; <BR> Subject: Another New KT Interview 
</P>
<P>Hey y'all, you know that big fat CD catalogue that shows up on magazine
racks  sometimes? The one from Canada? This time they have an interview with
Kate (in  which she reveals that the Q Magazine article was a hoax, they never
talked to her)  that is funny and sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>It also reveals that her great love, besides her work, is her &quot;herbaceous
border&quot;  around her garden. 
</P>
<P>No wonder she was born a BUSH!

<BR> Subject: CD Guide/Kate in A Book 
</P>
<P>I know the CD Guide that Karen talks about, but from my quick read in the 
magazine store (not worth $6.95 for the whole thing), I don't think Kate was
saying  that Q didn't interview her. What I think she said was that they made up
the  &quot;booze, blokes, fags and me&quot; quote that was on the cover - that
she didn't actually  say that and they made it up to parody the type of headline
that was in tabloid  newspapers. But as far as I remember they actually did
conduct the face to face  interview that made up the bulk of the article.

</P>
<P>You were right: the article does state, however, that a recent VOX &quot;interview&quot;
 was created without the benefit of actual verbal interaction with the subject
(Kate).
