<P>             The Tony Myatt interview, fall 1985
</P>
<P>     [Here is Tony Myatt's 1985 interview with Kate Bush. Please be patient
with Mr. Myatt; although he asks a few amazingly lame questions, they somehow
manage to elicit some fascinating answers from Kate--perhaps because he seems
genuinely interested and respectful, and because he manages to avoid the
cynical, patronizing tone of most UK interviewers. The interview (preceded by
Homeground's accompanying introduction) was first copied from the Homeground
transcription, then checked against an audio-cassette of the convention for
accuracy and completeness's sake.]
</P>
<P>     The taped interview played at the 1985 Kate Bush Convention was
specially commissioned by Homeground for the event. It was conducted by Tony
Myatt, a former DJ and now Producer at Capital Radio, London's commercial radio
station. It is likely that Tony Myatt was in fact the first DJ ever to play
Kate's music on the air: Wuthering Heights, way back at the end of 1977. He has
since then remained a champion of Kate's music, and his interviews over the
years may be said to have charted her progress. This interview was conducted in
November 1985, and we [Homeground] believe it is one of the best Kate has given
on her new album Hounds of Love. 
</P>
<P>     Let's talk about The Hounds of Love [sic] first of all, ok? A wonderful
title for an album, but where does it actually come from?
</P>
<P>     &quot;The title comes from one of the songs, which is entitled Hounds
of Love, and this album for me is like two quite separate pieces of work: the
a-side and the b-side. The a-side is very much five individual songs that are in
some way all linked by love as a theme, and this seemed to be a title which
really did sum up that side. We actually gave a title to the b-side of the album
as well, but because you can't have two titles for an album, so we just went for
the a-side title to cover it all.&quot;
</P>
<P>      But The Hounds of Love itself, does it come from a book? Or was it
something you made up?
</P>
<P>    &quot;No, the hounds of love are an image, really: someone who's afraid
of being captured by love; and the imagery is of love taking the form of hounds
that are hunting them, so they run away because they're afraid of being caught
by the hounds and ripped to shreds.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Are you afraid of being caught by love?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, I think so. I think everyone is. I think when you are in
love with someone, you do not want to lose that. It is something that affects
you in so many areas. And I think it can be frightening, yes.&quot;
</P>
<P>     It's not a feeling of being trapped, though, Kate, is it?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it can be for some people, yes. I think...It doesn't mean
that for me, but I think for some people any relationship can be a form of being
trapped, which they're afraid of.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Just on the lighter side, it's a wonderful cover, the two hounds. Where
did they come from? How long did it take to pose that picture? Because it must
have taken a long time.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, it's a very popular question! The two dogs are friends of
our and John, my brother, who took the photograph, had a lot of trouble keeping
them under control. I think he had a very strong word with them and got them to
behave, and it really was just a matter of patience, because we'd get the whole
scene set up, and then the dogs would come in and they'd be walking all over me
and everything, and it would be totally ruined in five minutes, so we'd have to
start again.&quot;
</P>
<P>     So they behaved themselves in the end, anyway?
</P>
<P>     &quot;They did eventually, to the point where they just went to sleep!&quot;
</P>
<P>     And they got a little mention on the album, as well.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Absolutely, for all that effort.&quot;
</P>
<P>     This is your first album for quite a while. A lot of people would say
that being that amount of time away from any kind of business, let alone the pop
business, can be quite tricky. I mean, why was it necessary to have that break,
as far as you're concerned?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Whenever I do something, it's...um...really sort of going in at
the deep end of a project, and I do find that things take me longer than I
thought. It's not something I plan, it's just that the work takes over and in
order to make it better you just have to be patient and spend more time with it.
After the last album at the end of '82, I'd just spent an intense period in the
studio doing an album. I wanted to get a break. I felt that I hadn't really had
any time to take things in because I'd been working so constantly, really since
1978--and we'd just moved as well, out of London--so I wanted to spend some time
at home, see my friends, take in new stimuli, and try to create a new energy for
a new direction that would be different from the album I'd just written. Also, I
wanted to get together our own recording studio, which was definitely something
which was being pointed at all the way through the other albums--that it was the
thing to do. And I found that just during that time that I was taking off to
discover things right, get the studio together, I made some of the most
important decisions--and very beneficial ones -- that I have done. And I think
it's all good, and I understand just what you mean about that time, in that, in
a way, you do get scared that you're spending so long away that you won't be
able to come back. But the priority--and again, I really did feel that this was
what I wanted during this time--was the work, and not necessarily being
successful or famous; that what I was working on should be the best it could be,
at that time.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Was the business itself getting on top of you? Were you missing-- Did
you feel you were missing out on things, you know?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I don't think I was missing out on things, but I wanted to get
away from the exposure--that being consumed--that can start to happen to you if
you don't get away. And, um...I think, too, that when I spend so long on
projects, I want to get back to that more and more when I'm out doing promotion,
because I know that everything takes me such a long time to do!&quot;
</P>
<P>      So you built the studio, and that was a giant step as well, I would
have thought. Did you actually physically get in there and help build the place
yourself, or was it just...
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, I was really involved in the design, and really the
inspiration behind the whole project was my father. He was totally encouraging,
and really did put a lot of it together himself, and he was in there building it
and advising on putting the studio together; and so really the studio is very
much a lot to do with his effort and enthusiasm.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You're very close to the family--you're a very close-knit family?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Are your family supportive so far as your music is concerned?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think they're supportive of me in every area possible. I think
I am most definitely a strongly emotionally-based person, and my family are
totally integral, I think, to everything I do. They affect me because I love
them.&quot;
</P>
<P>      Do you need that support? Is that essential?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it is essential. I think it's something that has always
been there, and that if it wasn't there it would probably be devastating for me,
yes.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What about when you write your songs, though, do you try them out on
your family? Do they get a chance to hear them?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes; yes, they do. There's a small group that is around the
family obviously including Del and a few friends, and they're really the people
who hear it straight after I've written it and I suppose their reaction is the
initial one. You see if it's going to work or not, by just the way they react.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Take, for example, the songs on the Hounds of Love album. How many
songs in total would you say you wrote for the album that perhaps didn't make it
in the end...or does it not work that way?        &quot;No, it does, initially.
I write a batch of songs and try to pick the best. So I suppose there would have
been a good say four or five songs--but then calling them songs is misleading,
because they weren't complete, and I'd normally find that I'd throw lots of
ideas down and then, coming back to them in a few days, would see that they
weren't as good as they could be, so I would literally just leave them and not
finish off the track. And the second side of the album had one and a half tracks
rewritten, really, because the flow of the side needed to be changed because the
whole nature of it kept changing as things were being put on top of the basics.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do you ever go back to the songs that maybe you rejected? Say, for
example, for The Hounds of Love? Would you ever go back to them again, or leave
them totally aside?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's quite interesting going back to them, and I have done, and
I'll tend to find little pieces that I think can be re-worked and the rest of it
is probably rubbish, so I'll put out the bits that, um...seem re-usable. And
though maybe if that isn't used itself, it will then spark off something that
can be used again, so they do get recycled sometimes.&quot;
</P>
<P>      Six months you worked on the songs for the album. Now as far as you're
concerned is six months a long time?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it is a long time, yes, but it's just the way the work
takes you. Some things can be very fast, and then the next part of the process
will slow down dramatically...um...and each song has such different nature. It
has its own personality, in a way. It can be terribly time-consuming trying to
get as many of the right things as you can for each track, and the lyrics can be
ultimately frustrating.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Well, I think lyrics are what make your songs, quite honestly.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Do you?&quot;
</P>
<P>     I love the melodies as well, but I think the lyrics...I mean I have to
sit down and read the lyrics as I'm listening to the song, and then the song
means that much more as far as I'm concerned. Are the lyrics that important to
you? They obviously are.
</P>
<P>[Laughter from the convention audience.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;Very important. I think the music and the lyrics are the two main
priorities in song-writing [More laughter from audience], and they should be
equally good, hopefully.&quot;
</P>
<P>     But for example, when you're writing a song, does the melody come
first, or do you year the lyric line?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Um...Again, it does really alter from song to song, but generally
the music comes first--&quot;
</P>
<P>     Yes.
</P>
<P>     &quot;--and occasionally you just get like a riff musically that would
have a line, say, connected to it; and that would be the chorus of the song. And
then you can spend, say, up to ten days or whatever, just trying to get the rest
of the lyrics around it.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Can you explain not the single that's coming out but but the last
single off the album, the Deal With God? Can you explain that song? Because I'm
sure there're a lot of people listening to that, and really don't know what it's
about.
</P>
<P>      &quot;Yes.&quot;
</P>
<P>      You know, Running Up That Hill?
</P>
<P>       &quot;Yes. It's a bit of a cliche at the moment, with so many songs
called this, but it is very much about the power of love [N.B.: Kate is
referring to two then-recent pop singles, The Power of Love by Huey Lewis and
the News, and The Power of Love by Jennifer Rush, both of which were big hits in
England in 1985], and the strength that is created between two people when
they're very much in love, but the strength can also be, um...uh...threatening,
violent, dangerous as well as gentle, soothing, loving. And it's saying that if
these two people could swap places--if the man could become the woman and the
woman the man, that perhaps they could understand the feelings of that other
person in a truer way, understanding them from that gender's point of view, and
that perhaps there are very subtle differences between the sexes that can cause
problems in a relationship, especially when people really do care about each
other.&quot; [Long pause.]
</P>
<P>      Every album that you've had out to date, since the first one--since
the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; album [sic], has been full of contrast, full
of very original ideas. Does this create a problem for you, with every album
that you put out, trying to create something that's totally original? Does it
become a burden to you, is what I'm trying to say...
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think the whole process is a form of a burden in that it's
really quite tortuous, and it does pull you through so many different feelings
and problems and worries, that I just think the whole thing creates its own
problems and energies that you just have to cope with in order to get what you
want at the end.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You see, the thing is, with a lot of the stuff on the new album, would
you agree if I said that the first side anyway was probably the most commercial
thing you've done to date? [Long silence.] Or don't you like that word &quot;commercial&quot;?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, I think especially from your mouth I can accept it! And in
some ways I think you're very right: it is, and not necessarily so intentionally
as perhaps I thought. I think the development of rhythm in my music is perhaps
one of the things that makes it obviously more available to people, and a
constancy of rhythm perhaps wasn't always there in previous albums.&quot;
</P>
<P>     That's exactly what I'm talking about. I mean it's the rhythm, rhythm
tracks I find on this album are tremendous. Were you totally responsible for
that?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, I wasn't. I think a very big influence was Del Palmer, who
when I was initially coming up with the songs...I would actually get Del to
manifest in the rhythm box the pattern that I wanted. As a bass player I think
he has a very natural understanding of rhythms and working with drums, and he
could also actually get the patterns that I could hear in my head and that I
wanted, so it's sort of through him that we started off with the rhythmic basis
that was then built upon and was very much what I wanted.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Here again with the new album there are some songs that are fairly
simple. [Silence.] Do you know what I mean?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes...&quot;
</P>
<P>     In their construction.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes.&quot;
</P>
<P>     And there are other songs that are very complex, as well. [Laughter
from audience.] Can you for example just tell me about The Big Sky-- that
particular song...Can you explain that for me? [More laughter.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes! The Big Sky gave me terrible trouble, really, just as a
song. I mean, you definitely do have relationships with some songs, and we had a
lot of trouble getting on together and it was just one of those songs that kept
changing--at one point every week--and, um...It was just a matter of trying to
pin it down. Because it's not often that I've written a song like that: when you
come up with something that can literally take you to so many different
tangents, so many different forms of the same song, that you just end up not
knowing where you are with it. And, um...I just had to pin it down eventually,
and that was a very strange beast.&quot;
</P>
<P>     A strange beast...And you were happy with the final outcome?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, and it was very different from the original song that was
written.&quot;
</P>
<P>     In what way?
</P>
<P>     &quot;In nearly every way possible.&quot;
</P>
<P>     A complete change of song?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, and that's very rare as well, but it was just one of those
songs. Maybe it's all to do with what the song is about, the fact that it's
changing all the time--the sky, always...changing!&quot;
</P>
<P>     Was it your idea to do something that was very complex and something
that was very easy on this album?--Or simple?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes. There--There were definite areas of simplicity that I wanted
to work with musically, particularly in the traditional areas. And also I wanted
to move away from certain chord patterns that I'd definitely become very fond of
over the last few albums. And, um...though I did move away from them a bit, I
definitely hung onto my old favourites.&quot;
</P>
<P>     That can't be easy to do, because I think most songwriters -- I mean,
people who write songs all the time--they do have a certain way of writing a
song, if you like. As you say, you wanted to get away from that? That must be
quite a difficult thing to do.
</P>
<P>    &quot;I think it's finding the right avenue for the song, and in a way I
think you just have to pin down as early as you can exactly what you want to
dress the song in--you know, what colour clothes... It's very like that, really,
and you have to treat it accordingly--and from the word go the song will then
take on an attitude that's maybe completely different from the song next to it
on the album. Um...um... The Big Sky is an example of a real freak on the album,
in that it consistently changed until we got there in the end, and 'Waking the
Witch' on side two was totally written through a guitarist--the electric
guitartist. I knew what I wanted, but it wasn't a song that would sound right if
it was based around a keyboard. It had to be written through the electric
guitar. So the guitarist came in literally working to just a Linn pattern, and,
um...I just told him what I wanted, and it was a very different way of writing.
I've never done it like that before, but I think it was very successful.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What about the idea behind that song. I'm glad you mentioned that,
because to me, it's weird. I mean it's with the &quot;Wake up--whee!&quot;
</P>
<P>     &quot;[Laughs.] Yes. That's good!&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do you agree or not? What was the idea behind that song?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, I'm glad you say that, because I would be disappointed in a
way if you thought it was ordinary. I definitely wanted to create a weirdness,
yes. It's all part of the story off the second side, about the person who's in
the water for the night, and they just have to try and keep going until the
morning, and at this point they've just woken from a dream and have surfaced on
the water, trying not to drown, and I suppose it's the horror of then being
faced with something that wants to put you straight under the water again,
whether you are innocent or guilty, they're going to put you down--under the
water again...&quot;
</P>
<P>     Can I just ask you something--From a personal point of view, did you
ever feel that was happening to you in the music business?        &quot;[Laughs.]
No, not at all! No, I think that's very much something that...&quot;
</P>
<P>     People have made up?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, that is an outside personal view of construing subject
matter. I think that, very much, this whole thing is tied in with water --
[laughter from audience] -- and if I was thinking of going under water it
wouldn't be to do with the business at all, it would be to do with myself as a
person, relationships, all that sort of thing. They're what concern me, that's
what would make me go under, I think. But no--I haven't...I don't feel that is
even relevant to things in my life because at the time when I took that break,
and I was writing these songs, it was one of the most content, happy periods of
my life for quite a while, in that I actually had time to breathe and work
creatively. And I think what's interesting is that I've always felt, in the
past--and it's almost a sort of code from certain areas of life--that in order
to write something, you know, that has meaning or whatever, that you have to be
unhappy, that you should be in some kind of torment. And what was surprising was
that for being actually very happy at this point in my life, I felt I wrote some
songs that were saying very different things from that.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Would you say that Waking the Witch is one of the most complex songs on
the album, one of the most difficult songs to record?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, I'd say it was one of the quickest, and it's actually one of
the simplest in that it's almost one chord all the way through the song, and the
whole movement is to do with moods and the people that you're dealing with,
rather than musically. The structure of the song is so simple...&quot;
</P>
<P>     But there's a lot going on in there, that's what I mean.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, there is! But I think it's stuff that travels. The whole
track is traveling, and if that bit comes up, it will go again, and then maybe
come back later.&quot;
</P>
<P>     So what was the most difficult song on the album to get done, you
think?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think...[long pause]... The Big Sky. That's the only one from a
songwriting point of view actually caused the problems. With all of the others
it was just a matter of patience and finding the right things; they were all
keyed quite instantly.&quot;
</P>
<P>     I've mentioned one song that I--you know, that I thought was weird, and
you say you're quite happy about that. The only other one that frightened me
little bit was Under Ice. Can you just, uh...What was...What was the thinking
behind that song?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It was totally connected to the track that had come before, and
they were written together-- And Dream of Sheep goes straight into Under Ice.
They were almost conceived as one. It was very much the idea of going from very
cold water--it's getting dark, you're alone, the only way out is to go to sleep,
no responsibilities, and forget about everything, but if you go to sleep the
chances are you could roll over in the water and drown. So you're trying to
fight sleep, but you can't help it, and you hit the dream: the idea of the dream
being really cold, and really the visual expectancy of total loneliness, and for
me that was a completely frozen river, no-one around, everything completely
shattered [?] with snow and icicles. And it's that person, all alone in this
absolute cold wilderness of white, and seeing themselves under the ice,
drowning, from which they wake up and find themselves under the water.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Where did that idea come from? It's not something one would usually
write a song about, if you get what I mean...
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes. I think the imagery for the whole piece--a lot of it I think
came from moving out of London, in that I was surrounded much more by elements
than people and man-made things. The power of things like the wind in the trees,
I mean. It sounds corny, but it's very earthy, and I think it does affect you.
Also some war films that covered people coming off ships, out of planes, into
the sea, in situations where they were alone and frightened, into a huge
thing--the sea is just enormous and really so unknown, and very taken for
granted. I don't think that many people consider that cruel side of the sea, and
how...ultimate it is...And also the whole thing of almost...like sensory
deprivation, where you've been in the water a while, you start losing all sense
of where you are, who you are, whether you're upside down or whatever. And I
just found the whole thing terribly fascinating--[coughs--laughter from
audience] Although a very physical event, very much a mental event as well in
that you are travelling in your head, even though your body is just floating in
water.&quot;
</P>
<P>     I'm being a little unfair because I'm taking the individual songs on
side two, The Ninth Wave: as far as you're concerned, would you like people to
listen to that entire side just straight through?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, I would, ideally.&quot;
</P>
<P>     But I think people would, you see, because, I mean, once you start from
the top of side two you have to keep listening all the way through. Dou find
that yourself or not? You're compelled to listen to the next track as you're
going along.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Good! It's very hard for me to tell. You do try to stay
objective--and considering the time we put into projects, the objectivity
sustained is incredible--but you can't help but be subjective, and there are
lots of things I know I can hear perfectly, but I will never really know if
other people who hear it for the first time will hear that stuff, unless they
write to me or report to me that it's come through.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do a lot of your fans actually write and ask you about the meanings of
your songs?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Um...No, I think most of them don't have to. I think they
actually understand it, or if they don't, they still feel it and understand it;
and that's really what it's all about. But, um...I do get a lot of feedback from
them and it's very important to me, and, uh...it's very interesting, as well,
just to hear what strikes them, what they like.&quot;
</P>
<P>      But...they must ask you, as I would when I listen to your albums--
particularly the songs on this new one--where do these ideas come from, because
they are really the most original...Every album you've done from the first one
has this stamp of originality on it, and that is why I asked earlier if it is a
burden to keep thinking of totally new ideas for songs. Where do they come from?
  [Laughter and groans from audience.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well I think that's very kind of you to say that. I think that
originality is something that really doesn't exist, that everything has been
done before, and it's just that there are so many ways of doing things. People
can be sparked off by something that already exists and create something quite
different from that, and I think that's what's exciting, in that--in a way--that
is what people like myself are doing. We're looking for pieces of gold, and if
you see something glitter, then you try to grab it and turn it into something
that you hope, you know, glitters, and just...start working on it.&quot;
</P>
<P>     This album is the first you've produced yourself?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, it's the second.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Second one. [Pause. More laughter from audience.] Is production
exciting for you? As exciting as writing and singing the songs?        &quot;Yes,
it's totally a part of it for me now, and it's just become a continuation of the
writing process and it's through that control that I feel I can afford to spend
the time on the stuff. I don't feel that there are that many people who could be
as patient as I am with the work, because I can hope that at the end of all
these mad ideas something will come of it, and perhaps it would be harder for
someone else to have that kind of faith in my ideas; and I feel I can then spend
as long as is necessary to make the song better.&quot;
</P>
<P>     How often did you have to go back to a song and do a little extra
piece?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Never. The structures of the songs were as were, except for The
Big Sky, but that was just because that was re-written several times.&quot;
</P>
<P>     So you knew exactly what you were going to do with each song before you
went into the studio?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, yes. The songs were written in the studio. What we were
hoping for as well, with this album, was that the demos as such no longer
existed, in that they were the masters.&quot;
</P>
<P>     The demos were the masters?
</P>
<P>    &quot;Yes. So everything that I wrote went straight onto master tape,
and then we built on top of that. So from the word go we had one take, and that
was what we worked on and built upon.&quot;
</P>
<P>    That is in itself very unusual.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it is, and I don't think I could have done it a while
ago. It's the involvement of working in studios. You just find you can put
things down and they either work or they don't, and again that's why I think I
can leave songs in an unfinished form, knowing that they're not going to be as
good as they could.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Obviously, having your own studio to do everything makes an enormous
difference...?
</P>
<P>    &quot;It's the best decision I think I've ever made, certainly to do my
work.&quot;
</P>
<P>     On the track Hello Earth, right? right? There's a choir in there. Now
that again was an unusual thing to have...Has it? [sic]
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, but it was totally inspired by a movie that I watched, and,
um...I'd already been writing the concept--I suppose it had been in my head for
a couple of months. And, uh...I watched this film called Nosferatu, directed by,
um... Herzog. And it's beautiful! And there was this one piece of music that
just haunted me, to the point where I just--I had to use it in the song. It was
exactly what I wanted to say at this point in the music. And it was...sort of
building the song around that piece. It was a traditional piece that, um...I
think, uh...was either Russian or Czechoslovakian...Um...is a Russian piece
[laughs] and...uh...It's just so haunting. I mean it's a very holy piece of
music, in a very pure sense...&quot;
</P>
<P>      Do you get a lot of ideas from reading books, and from films?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think whenever I have the time to read I'm always inspired by
it The problem is that I just shun it, in that I feel that there are more
important things to do with my time. It's rubbish really, but I do always feel
guilty when I sit down and read a book, because I think I should be doing other
things. and it takes me such a long time to read. But in a way there is no other
experience like it. An intimate relationship between yourself and a book is...is
incredible, and it's very sad that things like television and films--sort of,
uh... Although it's great, because they're encouraging books by using their
scripts for films-- I think it is taking something away from that whole world of
books. But particularly films do inspire me. I've always had a television, I
always used to watch lots and lots of television when I was a kid, and I really
enjoy watching films.&quot;
</P>
<P>      &quot;Can I just take you back to your beginnings, when you started
off in the business? You were very young.&quot; [Mild laughter from convention
audience.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;I was eighteen when I made the first album.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You'd been writing before that?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, I had.&quot;
</P>
<P>     When you first started writing songs, did you ever see yourself
becoming as famous as you are now?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Was it something that you wanted?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No...I don't think so. I mean as a child, the idea of being a
star was attractive, as I think it is to every child. They love things that are
larger than life, and dreams and fantasies, and most children never grow out of
it to the day they die. But I think I didn't ever consider the idea of actually
being a famous so-called songwriter-singer. I think that as a very young child,
perhaps I aspired to becoming something like a great actress. I think I was very
enamoured by people like Judy Garland. I thought she was incredible, so
beautiful. But no, I never ever thought this. But I did hope that I would have
involvement with music and that one day I might be able to sing and write songs.&quot;
</P>
<P>     I want to ask you more about the acting in just a moment, but first of
all, I'd like to ask: When you were writing the songs at that time, did you feel
you were writing songs that were different in any way, or did you just feel that
they were, you know--they were your songs?
</P>
<P>      &quot;It's very hard to remember how I felt at the time, but it was
something I enjoyed doing so immensely--It was my release from school, and, you
know, if I couldn't go out and it was a wet day, or there wasn't anything good
on television, that would be my favourite place to go: to the piano.&quot;
</P>
<P>     And start writing songs?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It was a very important relationship and still is to me. I found
something that I don't think I've ever really found since, when I first started
writing songs: that I could actually create something out of nothing, and it was
a very special discovery--I think if you are lucky enough to make it at a young
age, as I was.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Kate, let's talk about Cloudbusting. Here comes the $64,000 question.
How in heaven's name did you get Donald Sutherland to be part of your video?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, I think I'm very lucky, really. He was the first choice. He
was perfect, he couldn't have been better, really, to play the part; and it was
a matter of finding out how to contact him. And through a very nice man called
Barry Richardson I managed to make contact with Donald, and then asked him and
he said yes, he was interested. And it all went from there, and it all happened
very quickly. I must have contacted him ten days to two weeks before we actually
started shooting, and it just happened to co-incide perfectly with a few days
that he had off in a very busy schedule. And, uh...it was just brilliant!&quot;
</P>
<P>     You'd never met him before?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, it was a complete privilege to work with him.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Why did you want him in particular? Was it because of the way he
looked, or because of the fact that, you know, he's a great actor and he would
do a good...job?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, he is a great actor, and having watched actually how he
worked in our situation I just have to reiterate that. He's just incredible, so
professional, and so patient, and he helped me incredibly, because I'd never
really acted as such, and I just had to react to him. He was wonderful.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Kate, I remember the first time I saw that video was on, uh... The Old
Grey Whistle Test, and I looked at it and I thought, &quot;Hang on a
minute--That's Donald Sutherland!&quot; And then I saw this little girl running
around and I thought, &quot;Who's that?&quot; You see, I didn't recognise you at
the start, because of the hair being much shorter and everything. Now, you say
Donald Sutherland helped you in making the video. You mean acting advice?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, not even advice, his pure presence. He puts out such an
energy of sensitivity to the situation that I just had to re-act to him. He
was--As far as I was concerned, whenever we were shooting, he was my dad. He's
wonderful.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What about the--because it's almost like a short film, that video.
[Laughter from audience.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;That's exactly what we wanted. I felt that it was based on the
song, which was inspired by a book, and it is a genuine sense of magic, emotion,
sadness that came initially from that book, that it was so important for us to
do justice to it. We all worked very hard to try and create that.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What was the book?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's called A Book of Dreams, and it's written by Peter Reich.
Unfortunately it's out of print, so I suggest that lots of people write to the
publishers and [imitates indignant MP] demand that it be put back into print
immediately!&quot;
</P>
<P>     What about the rain machine? Was it your idea, the way the video
actually turned out?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It was very much my idea, but a lot of ideas came from Terry
Gilliam, who--really together we wrote the story board, and the director Julian
Doyle put an awful lot of work into it, and it was fantastic to work with them.
Everyone was just so inspired by the story really, and everyone was moved by it,
which--In a way it was one of the most important things, that, you know,
everyone that was involved in it should be... And it was just a fantastic
experience.&quot;
</P>
<P>     How long did it take to do it?
</P>
<P>     &quot;To shoot it took four to five days, to prepare it took about four
weeks, and all in all including a lot of editing time that Julian spent, I
suppose about eight weeks, which is a very long time for a video.&quot;
</P>
<P>      I'm not going to ask for a figure, but I know that videos cost a hell
of a lot of money to make nowadays. This must have been very expensive?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It was no more expensive than the first one we made.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Which leaves me totally in the dark!
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think honestly if people knew how much it cost and what we got
out of that...It's phenomenal, what we got for the budget.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Is this something you want to get more into, videos?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Absolutely. Um...I'm starting to get a bit uncomfortable with the
word 'video' now, in that I feel that film is actually the medium that really
attracts me, and video was something that was great, but was really convenient
rather than ideal, and I hope very much to be able only to work in film in the
future.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You're a very successful singer-songwriter, someone who has been away
from the business for three years. You then come back and have had a number one
album. Then again can I ask you how you react to that, with people saying, &quot;Whatever
happened to Kate Bush?&quot;? Is that a bonus?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yeah, it's really good, isn't it? It is! It's great!&quot;
</P>
<P>     Unexpected?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, a lovely surprise, and what's really good is that I felt
that what really does matter to people is music, good music, music that has
thought and care put into it and not neccessarily an image or a fashion -- you
know, the so-called 'fickle public'. I would very much like to think that if you
want to put a lot of work into something and mean it, that's what people are
attracted to, not the image and all that stuff that is superfluous [pronounces
the word &quot;super-flu'-ous&quot;] -- Wait...How do you say it?&quot;
</P>
<P>     &quot;Su-per'-fluous&quot;!
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes! Superfluous.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What about the acting side? Is it something you'd like to get into?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, funnily enough, it's not, really. Until quite recently it's
something I ever really desired. There's no doubt that if I was offered a part
by a director who I admired, that I'm sure I would do it, but it doesn't
actually interest me in terms of giving up music to take up a career in acting.
It doesn't attract me at all, but I would certainly do if it was one of my
favourite directors--and, um...certainly if Donald Sutherland was in it!&quot;
</P>
<P>     What sort of role would you like to play if the offer was made?
Something dramatic?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No idea. I certainly wouldn't want to play the part of a rock
singer or a pop singer. It would have to be for the challenge of the acting. If
the part was something I thought that I could convey well, um...then I certainly
would be up for trying it. It's fascinating, the whole process of making films,
of suddenly becoming someone, showing feelings that you hadn't been feeling,
say, five minutes before. The whole process is extraordinary, fascinating.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Can I just take you back to the song Cloudbusting? The thing that
really impressed me with the song, and the way in which it was tied in with the
video was the rhythm track--it always seemed to fit so beautifully. When you
were planning the video, obviously that was running through your mind? [Laughter
from audience.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;You mean visuals to music?&quot;
</P>
<P>     Yes.
</P>
<P>     &quot;One thing that was interesting was that we had so much to say in
the story visually that we extended the audio track to allow a little more room
for things to be said. And I think that the story is very strong. And in a way
it's just, um...creating images both visually and audially that say the same
thing. And I felt we did. As I said earlier, everyone involved in that video
worked very hard, and I think they were fantastic.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You say that you would like to get more into video--film--mini-films. I
n what role? Would you like to direct them, or do you want--you know--to take
part in them?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, I've absolutely no idea, and there are--I really do have to
sometimes sit and listen to all those voices in me that, um...seem to want to do
too many different things sometimes. I mean I really do like the idea of
directing, but I don't think it's practical for me to direct and be in
something. When I'm performing visually I very much would like to work with a
director, because I think it's too difficult to do it all; but the idea of
directing is actually a little too far in the future, but is perhaps more
attractive than actually performing in front of the camera.&quot; [When Kate
says that she has &quot;absolutely no idea&quot; what role she would take in the
production of future promotional films, she is not being candid with Mr. Myatt.
This interview took place in November, 1985. Within another twelve months she
had directed and performed in three more promotional films of her own (Hounds of
Love, The Big Sky and Experiment IV). It's interesting to see Kate describe this
next step towards total artistic control as though it would be too difficult to
try, when in fact she must already have been seriously planning to do just
that.]
</P>
<P>     I've heard that one of your songs, Running Up That Hill, is doing
really well in the States at the moment. Does this mean that Kate Bush is going
off to America and help push it along?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, it could mean that. Yes...If it's doing well, it's a strong
possibility.&quot; [Again, this seems to be a deliberately cautious answer. Kate
left for America within one week after making this interview.]
</P>
<P>     What about the album. Is that doing well there as well?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It is, yes. Yes, it seems to be doing very well.&quot;
</P>
<P>     That's not bad, you know!
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's jolly good!&quot;
</P>
<P>     Jolly good! Listen, the other thing I must ask you about is touring.
Because the last tour was tremendous. There again, all your own ideas, and the
stage presentation was fantastic, and I'm sure one other thing all your fans
must be asking is when are you going to do another one? In this country?
</P>
<P>     &quot;This point in time is really a decision as to what do do next,
whether it's a tour, or what I'd like to do next, if I could, which is to put
the whole of The Ninth Wave, which is the second side of the album, onto film,
but I just don't know how feasible or practical that is, with timing and
whatever. [This project was eventually abandoned.] So I suppose really it's,
um...at the beginning of next year, I first have to decide what comes next, but
I don't think there's time for both.&quot;
</P>
<P>     How far have you got in putting The Ninth Wave into film form, would
you say? How far have you got with that?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Not very far, because since the album was finished there's just
been so much work surrounding the singles that come out, the videos and the
promotion, that I've really had no serious time to approach people and start
seriously thinking about it.&quot;
</P>
<P>     But a tour is on the cards?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, I wouldn't say that it was on the cards, no. I would just
say that it is a possibility, and something I would still very much like to do,
but, um...at this point in time, I couldn't say, because up until the end of the
year I'll be promoting this record.&quot;
</P>
<P>     One final thing. Um...I notice on the album there's a gentleman called
John Cader--uh...
</P>
<P>     &quot;Carder.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Carder Bush--your brother?--on Jig of Life, which has a very Irish feel
about it. Now that, to me is inter--it really stands out, for me, from the rest
of the album, if you know what I mean, because of the rhythm track and the feel.
Take me through that song.
</P>
<P>     &quot;That was very much inspired by Paddy Bush, my other brother, who
had found this piece of music and said, 'You've just got to listen to this, it's
brilliant, I know you'll love it!' He played it to me, and instantly I knew I
wanted to use it. It was fantastic. So it was just a matter of working out a
song based around the format of this piece of music he'd found. There's no doubt
Paddy was the, um...initial inspiration. The song's about the future person
visiting the person who's in the water at the moment, and saying 'Look, don't
drown, don't die, because if you do I'm not going to be able to live my part of
your life. I'm not going to have the kids you're going to have in ten years'
time. I'm not going to be able to move to that nice little place by the sea. So
don't die. Live, you've got to stay alive. If not for me, then at least for
yourself or your children that are to come.' And, um...I suppose the suggestion
of the fiddle as the Devil's music is not unintentional: the idea of a spirit
being conjured from the future; that uncanny, uncomfortable feeling of two times
meeting. And it's very much meant to be the first delivery of hope on that side
of the album. There have been some very sad, disturbing experiences for the
person up to this point, and although it's hardly not disturbing, it's mean  to
be a comfort: it's the future coming to the rescue of the present.&quot;
</P>
<P>     On that note, Kate, thank you very much indeed.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Thank you!&quot;
