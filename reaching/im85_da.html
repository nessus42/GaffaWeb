<P>In a couple of days, I'm going to New York for about a week. Then I'm coming
 back for a couple of days, and then I'm going to England for a couple of weeks.
So  for most of this time, I won't be here to deal with any requests or

like a horrible  mail loop, someone please send mail to bcn@mit-eddie, and tell
him to turn off the list.

<BR> Subject: Re: Holly shit! 
</P>
<P>&gt; I've been scheduled an interview with Kate Bush for next week! If
anyone has  any questions they want asked, better recommend them now. 
</P>
<P>To-ledo, Doug, this is amazing! Gee, whiz! Is this a live, on-the-air
interview, or a  magazine-type interview? I mean, can you ask her *real*
questions, like, &quot;Doesn't  this song really mean this?&quot; or can you
only ask safe questions like, &quot;how do you feel  to be finally accepted in
America?&quot; 
</P>
<P>My, goodness, now, if I were going to talk to Kate Bush, and if I were not
put off  by some guarded persona she assumed, I would ask some questions like
this... not  that they are the sort of questions you could ask in interviews,
but just as an exercise  of fantasy... 
</P>
<P>1) In &quot;All the Love,&quot; you expressed a feeling of fear and
vulnerability at the reaction  of critics to songs you had written that made
them &quot;think you're up to something  wierd,&quot; and said that the next
time, you'd give them what they want to hear.  Was this behind your change of
style in Hounds of Love ? Do you have any  regrets at doing this? 
</P>
<P>2) Despite what some shallow types say, I am convinced that &quot;Running up
the Hill&quot;  really is about the objectification of women: men treating women
like objects,  rather than as equals, and a desire to switch places so they
could understand how  unjust this is. Is this interpretation totally wrong? 
</P>
<P>3) In &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; in the first song (&quot;And Dream of
Sheep&quot;), the woman in  the water experiences hypothermia, and with it, a
desire to go to sleep. Yet, if she  went to sleep, she would surely die. How
does this relate, then, to the astronaut  saying &quot;Go to sleep, little
Earth?&quot; at the end of &quot;Hello Earth&quot;? 
</P>
<P>4) Does the &quot;old lady&quot; in &quot;Jig of Life&quot; represent the
folding-of-time perceived by a  woman who looks in the mirror and suddenly sees
a face reminiscent of her  mother's when she was born? 
</P>
<P>5) Is this folding-of-time represented again by the &quot;you asleep on the
seat&quot; in &quot;Hello,  Earth&quot;? Or who is this &quot;you&quot;? 
</P>
<P>6) In the phrase &quot;Help this blackbird,&quot; there seems to be this
parallel  sound-meaning: &quot;Help this black bard.&quot; Yes? 
</P>
<P>7) What does the reference to Ireland in &quot;The Big Sky&quot; mean? 
</P>
<P>8) In &quot;Suspended in Gaffa,&quot; you seem to suggest the idea that by
choosing the path  of an entertainer, you have bound yourself against progress
to a higher level of  enlightenment; that your spiritual progress is &quot;suspended
in Gaffa.&quot; Yet the  conclusion of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; is quite
opposite this idea. Does this reflect a  change in your ideologies in the past
few years? 
</P>
<P>9) Don't give up! &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was great, and you shouldn't let
the critics  mislead you. You can have your immortality now or later. 
</P>
<P>Well, that's about it... as I said, I doubt you could really ask those
things, unless  you felt a real rapport with the interviewee... and then she
might get mad and go  away. 
</P>
<P>PS - What is &quot;Holly shit&quot;?

<P>Date: Wed, 27 Nov 85 13:02:59 est <BR> From: nessus (Doug Alan) <BR>
Subject: My chat with Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>As you probably now realize, I survived my chat with Kate Bush. I got to
talk  with her for about half an hour, and have much of it on tape. She's just
about the  nicest person you could imagine meeting and was very friendly. She
seemed a little  weary, though, because they were definitely running her ragged.
I was one of many  people to interview her that day, and I'd never have thought
it possible to cram so  many events into one week. For example, she was signing
records at Tower Records  from 3 to 5 on Thursday (the line went three quarters
of the way around a New  York City block! they had to turn away the vast
majority of the people) and then  they rushed her off to be on &quot;Live At
Five&quot;, which ends at six. 
</P>
<P>To answer the question that has been foremost on all of your minds, &quot;What
does  Kate Bush feed her cats?&quot; No, she doesn't feed them spinach lazania
-- she feeds  them &quot;fishy wishy&quot; from a tin. 
</P>
<P>And John Carder Bush wrote the narration in &quot;Jig Of Life&quot; and &quot;Breathing&quot;
and  the lyrics to &quot;My Lagan Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I don't have time to say much more right now because I'm leaving for England
 in a few hours. When I get back, I'll type in a transcription of the interview
and  you'll get to see me explain the sex life of mules to Kate. And see Kate
tell me how  making love was much easier back in childhood. (Precocious kid!
How's that for a  tantalizing trailer?) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Before you know I'll be over the water like a swallow&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;To be in England In the wintertime <BR> With my love Close to the
edge&quot;

<P>P.S. I asked Kate why she misspelled &quot;Orgonon&quot; and &quot;Organon&quot;,

Subject: My tete-a-tete with Kate 
</P>
<P>Half An Hour With Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>An interview by Doug Alan 
</P>
<P>(C) Copyright 1985 by Doug Alan. All rights reserved. 
</P>
<P> &quot;I was going to ask you for a fag, but this man might kill me&quot;
are the first words  I hear from Kate Bush as I am shown into her small but
comfortable hotel room in  Manhattan by an EMI-America representative. I guess
Kate noticed my T-Shirt with  an international No Smoking symbol proudly
emblazoned on its front. 
</P>
<P> I want to reply &quot;No, Kate, I don't have to -- you're killing yourself
by  smoking!&quot;. But I can't manage to get out these words to an idol,
especially when my  heart feels like it's going to pound my brain permanently
into mush. 
</P>
<P> Maybe it's all for the best, anyway. Maybe it's all that tar coating her
vocal  chords that has allowed her to sing lower and with more rawness and power
ever  since &quot;Breathing&quot; (&quot;...Breathing her nicotine...&quot;),
the last song on her third album  Never for Ever, without damaging her ability
to also sing unbelievably beautifully  when desired. 
</P>
<P> I want to reply &quot;No, Kate...&quot;, but instead, I just manage to
mumble something  incoherent. The EMI representative leaves and Kate opens the
window, letting in an  atmospheric Manhattan sound. She is here in the States
for the first time since '78.  She has come to promote her new album, Hounds of
Love, for one week, and I have  half an hour of that week. 
</P>
<P> Hounds of Love is Kate's fifth album, and though she has been very popular
in  Europe and especially in England since '78, this is the first album of hers
to make it  into the U.S. Top-100. It has even made it up to number one on some
college album  charts. This album and especially her previous album, The
Dreaming, are complete  masterpieces and are proof that she is a very important
artist, and perhaps the most  significant musical artist to have emerged in the
80's. Unfortunately, her previous  album, The Dreaming, initially was not
well-received in her homeland, England. It  was an artistic break-through, but
at the time was not recognized as such by most of  the narrow-minded British
music press or by much of the record-buying public.  Ironically, in the U.S.,
where Kate Bush had been previously pretty much ignored,  The Dreaming received
nearly unanimous critical adulation, though perhaps not  inciting amazing record
sales. 
</P>
<P> Fortunately, her new album, Hounds of Love, has been received unbelievably 
well by the both the British and American press. Out of dozens of reviews, I
have  only seen one negative review, and most of the reviews are 5 star raves.
It is also  selling incredibly well throughout the world, and including,
amazingly enough, the  U.S. 
</P>
<P> These facts, and that she has one of the strongest and perhaps the most 
dedicated cult following of any musical artist, mean that in the near future she
will  probably become more widely recognized as one of the most important forces
in  contemporary music. 
</P>
<P> Why does she have such a dedicated cult following? What is it about her
music  that stirs such passion in many listeners that her fans have spawned more
fanzines  and fan clubs than I can even count? Well, being one of her biggest
fans, I'm  probably somewhat qualified to comment. 
</P>
<P> I guess that to those whom she reaches, she touches deeply. To those whom
she  reaches, her music takes them to another world -- this world. This world
viewed  through Kate-colored glasses. An escape from reality into reality. Where
one is  shown the beauty of ugliness and the ugliness of beauty. A world where
estranged  lovers settle their differences by transforming into mules. Where
electronic swallows  and blackbirds swoop and dive through the recesses of the
inner mind. Where  hounds attack to tear you apart with love and witches try
themselves. Where Irish  jigs and Greek fire dance rhythms, and digital sonic
landscapes, and Aborigine and  African drums, and flanged voices, and Tennyson
poems and movies about vampires  are coherently aspects of One. A world where
always We Let The Weirdness In. A  world where frustration and pain are
fundamental and essential, but where there is  always hope and love and joy. A
world of infinite pain and infinite pleasure. A  mirror for all that is
important in life. Life itself! 
</P>
<P> Uh, hmmmm.... I'm sorry.... Perhaps I should just move on to the interview.
I  interviewed Kate on the evening of November 20th. It is a summer day in the
middle  of November. 75 degrees warm. A warm and unusual day to interview a warm
and  unusual person. Kate has opened the window letting in the atmospheric honks
and  roars of Manhattan traffic to add flavor to our conversation. 
</P>
<P> I mumble something to Kate about Dali and her being my favorite artists,
and I  give her a present of a record album: Birdsongs of the Mesozoic's
Magnetic Flip. She  thanks me sincerely. She is incredibly nice. Soon I remember
that I have only half an  hour, and I manage to pile out my tape equipment,
connect up the microphones, and  start the tape rolling..... 
</P>
<P>KATE: One, one, one, one, one, two, two, testing. Am I loud and clear? 
</P>
<P>DOUG: That sounds pretty good. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Good! 
</P>
<P>[My microphone doesn't appear to be working, however....] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: I don't sound so good, though.... I don't matter -- I can dub my voice
in  later. 
</P>
<P>KATE: [Laughs] Ask me completely different questions, eh? [Laughs again.] 
</P>
<P>	[I try to think of a witty reply, but my has brain has long since ceased 
functioning, and instead I just mumble something incoherent again. Kate makes 
an obscene throat-clearing noise -- a noise probably only possible for a smoker.

</P>
<P>	I flounder around for a few moments, but soon figure out that my microphone
 isn't turned on....] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Now I'm coming in! 
</P>
<P>KATE: Great! 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay... I guess I'm ready to start. 
</P>
<P>	A song of yours for which the symbolism in the lyrics really fascinates me
is  &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; [from The Dreaming]. You've said that it is
just a simple  song about bank robbery, but the more I look at it, the more it
seems that nearly  every line is really sort of an allusion to your recording
career at the the time you  were recording The Dreaming. You wouldn't deny that
this was intended, would  you? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, I would deny it. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: You would? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, it's very much a song about bank robbery. I wouldn't say it was a
 simple song about bank robbery, but it's about the fear that people feel rather
 than the glorification of bank robbers. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: I dunno. It seems like... well, to me it seems every line sort of
could parallel  your recording career. I won't go and explain it, but like one
example is &quot;There  Goes A Tenner&quot;. &quot;Tenner&quot; could be a ten
dollar bill -- it could also be a level of  singing: you know, like soprano,
alto, tenor. And sort of every line is like that. But  you don't agree? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, no I don't because that's not... that was... nothing that was in
my  head when I was writing it. But then I think the interpretations that people
have  of your songs afterwards are nothing to do with me anyway. I think it's up
to  them to get what they can out of the song. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay. That seems reasonable. Maybe it was all subconscious. It seems
so  perfect to me. I dunno. 
</P>
<P>	I read an interview where the interviewer asked you if &quot;Running Up
That Hill&quot; is  about the contemplation of suicide. And I thought that was
pretty amusing,  because it seemed to me clearly not to about any such thing at
all. On the other  hand, strangely enough, that's just what &quot;Under The Ivy&quot;
[the B-side to Kate's  &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; single] seems to be
about to me. The tone of the song is  very, very sad. And it seems to be about
longing for the lost innocence of youth  -- perhaps a follow-up to &quot;In
Search Of Peter Pan&quot; [from Kate's second album  &quot;Lionheart&quot;]. A
white rose is a strong image in the song. And it could be a symbol  for
friendship or innocence, but it could also be a symbol for death. You sing  &quot;Away
from the party&quot;, and it seems like you might almost mean &quot;away from
the  problems and triviality of modern day life&quot;. You sing &quot;It
wouldn't take me long to  tell you how to find it&quot;, and it seems like you
might almost be addressing Death  itself. You mention a secret, but never
mention what it is. Could it be the taboo  subject of suicide? 
</P>
<P>	What are your feelings about this interpretation, and what were you
intentions  with the song? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, I think...uh, it... perhaps you are reading much more into it
than was  originally intended when I wrote it. It's very much a song about
someone who is  sneaking away from a party to meet someone elusively, secretly,
and to possibly  make love with them, or just to communicate, but it's secret,
and it's something  they used to do and that they won't be able to do again.
It's about a nostalgic,  revisited moment. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Is there any reason why it's so sad? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I think it's sad because it's about someone who is recalling a moment
when  perhaps they used to do it when they were innocent and when they were 
children, and it's something that they're having to sneak away to do privately 
now as adults. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: &quot;My Lagan Love&quot; [the bonus track on Kate's &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
12-inch single]  is another song of yours that seems very sad. I looked up the
word &quot;lagan&quot; in the  dictionary, and it means &quot;cargo thrown into
the sea attached to a buoy so that it  can be recovered later&quot;. But you use
the word &quot;Lagan&quot; as a name of someone,  perhaps a deity. In any case,
the dictionary meaning seems to go well with the  song, because it seems in the
song that your Lagan love has died. You sing  &quot;Where Lagan's light fell on
the hour/ I saw him far below me/ Just as the  morning calmed the storm/ With no
one there to hold him&quot;. This seems to  conjure up the image of looking down
into a grave at your Lagan love. But  perhaps he will return again &quot;when
the sun and the moon meet on yon hill,&quot;  [Kate smiles] or whatever. Could
you say more about this song? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, &quot;My Lagan Love&quot; is a traditional song that is one of
the most beautiful  tunes I think exists in traditional music. And throughout
the years, people have  used the song and their own versions of the lyrics to
it. The most famous version  of the song, I think, uses lyrics from a Keats
poem. 
</P>
<P>	I wanted to do a track that wouldn't be on the album, that would go on the 
twelve inch, so that people that were buying the album and the single had 
something extra that didn't come off the album. And it seemed like a quick, easy
 track to do, that would be unaccompanied -- a traditional song. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Did you agree with that meaning of the song, or what was your
intentions  with the meaning of the lyrics? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I think the lyrics are really just a vehicle for the song. I wanted to
do the  song and it had no traditional lyrics. We had to find some to go with
it, so we  pulled together some lyrics with my brothers and just put them to the
music. It  wasn't something that I put a great deal of thought into at all.
[Tiny laugh.] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay. 
</P>
<P>	[It turns out that John Carder Bush, Kate's oldest brother, wrote the
lyrics Kate  sings to &quot;My Lagan Love&quot;. When I talked to him about it,
he said that the song is  indeed about a woman's lover who has died, and the
lines quoted above do  describe her looking down into his grave. It is based on
a story by James Joyce  called &quot;The Dubliners&quot;. Lagan, it turns out,
is a place in Ireland, and John was not  aware of the dictionary meaning of the
word &quot;lagan&quot; before I mentioned it to him,  but he said that the
dictionary meaning really is very appropriate for the song,  and was amused by
this coincidence.] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: &quot;Burning Bridge&quot;, the other song on your [Kate makes another
obscene  throat clearing noise] &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; single, seems to be a
more desperate  retelling to me of a much earlier song of yours, &quot;Passing
Through Air&quot;. Could you  say something about &quot;Burning Bridge&quot;? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Umm, again it was a song that was totally created for a B-side, and I
knew  that it was going on the other side of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
is not  necessarily an up-tempo song and I feel that flips of records should be
something  that counterbalances the energy of the other side. So, I wanted
something that  was relatively up-tempo, and just a fun song. I don't think the
lyrics are by any  means profound, but it was something that I felt was fun to
do and was a very  different energy from the A-side of the record. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: It's sort of... I don't know if it's incredibly... I mean it's
up-tempo, but it  still has a sort of desperate sadness to it, don't you think?

</P>
<P>KATE: Actually, I think it's incredibly positive and quite trivial. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay. [Tiny laugh.] 
</P>
<P>KATE: [Tiny laugh.] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: On the song &quot;Jig Of Life&quot;, you seem to hint that you are
planning on maybe  having children. In an interview 6 or 7 years ago, I believe
you said that you  weren't planning on having children, but that if you did it
would mean the end of  your recording career. Have you changed your mind about
having children? And  if so, would you really give up your recording career? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I haven't changed my mind about having children, no. But it's not 
necessarily something that I wouldn't change my mind about at some point. &quot;The
 Jig Of Life&quot; is very much about the visitation of the future. Your future
self  coming to visit you to stop you dying -- to make sure you stay alive. And
the use  of the mention of children is really to use the image. In the future,
apart from  getting old, what happens to people? They get married; they have
kids. So that's  why it's being used -- purely as a poetical vehicle of
explaining the situation that  time has passed between the present and the
future. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But you don't necessarily see that happening to you, in specific? 
</P>
<P>KATE: No I don't, no. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: I have a problem with big record companies, in that I don't like to
view Art  as Big Business. Most large record companies seem much more concerned
with  making money than with encouraging art. But in order for many artists to
make  enough money to record albums the way they want to, it's a necessary thing
to  record for large record companies. And in fact, many of my favorite artists
do.  What is your opinion on the commercialization of art? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I think the purpose of a record company is to sell as many records as
they  can, and that is their total main concern. If something is successful,
they are  happy. If something is artistically good, but is not successful, then
they can't  really be prepared to follow that through. Their business is not art
-- it's money  and selling records to make money. 
</P>
<P>	I think that's part of the reason why the business is so hard, because
you're  talking about two completely different forces having to be integrated.
Artistic  people, a lot of the time, don't have a good business sense, and a lot
of the time  it's totally against everything they feel -- it's about money,
commercialization,  exploitation. It's not anything to do with a creative
spirit, which deals in  sensitivity and observation of people, emotions. They're
two completely different  forces. And I think to survive in this business, you
have to be realistic, and if  music is what matters to you, there's a certain
amount of business that you have  to be involved in in order to be able to keep
making music. 
</P>
<P>	So, I think for me, the way I cope with it, is to try and keep a realistic
balance  between the things I like and don't like doing. I have to do things I
don't like in  order to make sure my work will survive. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Sounds like a good answer to me.... 
</P>
<P>	I think the The Dreaming is just about as good an album as any ever
recorded,  but unfortunately, it wasn't much of a commercial success compared to
your  other albums. Was The Dreaming financially successful enough so that if
all your  records were only that successful, you'd still be able to continue
making records  the way you want to? 
</P>
<P>KATE: That's a very difficult question. I don't know. I think as long as an
album is  relatively successful, then you can afford to make another one. I
think also, the  thing about records is that they don't necessarily stop selling
after a year of  being released. I think it's possible that The Dreaming could
continue to sell  more than the others in the future... 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Sure hope so! [Wait.... I didn't mean to say that that way....] 
</P>
<P>KATE: ...and that that might be the one that keeps me in my old age. [Small
laugh.]  It's very difficult to say, and I think all I do really is put out the
best I can, and  hope people like it. And if I've done the best I can, then
there's nothing more I  can do. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: One can't help but notice that the first three songs on your new
album,  though quite excellent indeed, have a distinctly more &quot;commercial
pop&quot; sound to  them than anything on The Dreaming. Was this to help make
the album sell  better than The Dreaming, or did you feel it artistically
important to make some  music that might be more accessible to more people, or
did it just come sort of  come out that way? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I don't feel that it is that much more obviously commercial. I mean, I
think  from what people say, they feel that it is, but for me they are very
similar  energies. They are just trying to create as interesting a song as
possible with the  best production to accompany it. And to make it different.
And I think what  makes it more accessible for people is the consistency of
rhythm. I can't really  see that much difference... apart from how different
songs are anyway from each  other. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Well, did you think to yourself &quot;Well, if I use a consistency of
rhythm that it  will be more accessible to more people&quot; when you went about
writing the song,  or did you... 
</P>
<P>KATE: No... 
</P>
<P>DOUG: ...just want to do that? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, I write a song because it's what I like at the time. On the last
album  [The Dreaming] I was beginning to get very intrigued with the use of
rhythm. I  really like using rhythm, and I think this album is a progression of
how I've  learned to work with it. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Your song &quot;Breathing&quot; seems to be written from the point of
view of a fetus  about to be born into a post-holocaust world. One might think
from this and from  your being a vegetarian, that you would be opposed to
abortion. What are you  feelings on the morality and legality of abortion? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I think that is a very difficult subject and something that's far too
easy to  generalize about. But I think that life is something that should be
respected and  honored even in a few hours of its conception. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Do you think that abortion should be illegal? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I don't feel that I want to comment on that. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay.... 
</P>
<P>	When I first heard the title of your new album Hounds of Love, a long time 
before the album was actually released, it seemed to me like a reference to
fans.  It sort of conjured up the image of The Beatles constantly being hounded
by their  adoring fans, who would attack them, because each fan wanted a little
piece of  their idols. So the title &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; seems to hint at
a love/hate relationship  with fans. The Love/Hate relationship also seems to be
symbolized on the picture  sleeve to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, where you
are aiming a bow that could be  Cupid's bow, but is also a deadly weapon. Did
you have these things in mind? 
</P>
<P>KATE: No, I'd like to say straight away it's absolutely nothing to do with a
love/hate  relationship with fans and, in fact, that, as far as I am concerned,
is something  that doesn't exist. I have no resentment or dislike for any of the
people that like  my music, at all. If anything, it's a great honor for me that
such nice people are  attracted by the music. And that song has nothing to do
with fans -- it's about  love -- it's about someone who's afraid of being
captured by love, and it's seeing  love as a pack of hounds that's coming to get
them. [Doesn't remind me of fans,  at all....] As something that they're
frightened of -- not willing to accept. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Well, I would sort of maintain that any love relationship is a
love/hate  relationship, in that... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes... 
</P>
<P>DOUG: ... there are always problems that come along with... 
</P>
<P>KATE: I would totally agree, but it's got nothing to do with my fans. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay.... 
</P>
<P>	In the song &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, what do you mean by the line &quot;I'll
be two steps on  the water&quot;, other than a way of throwing off the scent of
hounds, or whatever, by  running through water... but why &quot;two steps&quot;?

</P>
<P>KATE: Because two steps is a progression. One step could possibly mean you
go  forward and then you come back again. I think &quot;two steps&quot; suggests
that you  intend to go forward. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But why not &quot;three steps&quot;? [Giggle.] 
</P>
<P>KATE: It could have been three steps -- it could have been ten, but &quot;two
steps&quot;  sounds better, I thought, when I wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Okay. [Grin.] 
</P>
<P>	You've said elsewhere that &quot;Jig of Life&quot; was inspired by a Greek
ceremony. Could  you describe this ceremony and say how it appears in the song?

</P>
<P>KATE: My brother [Paddy Bush] discovered a piece of music that was used in a
 Greek religious ceremony, where people worked themselves into a trance state 
through the hypnotic quality of the music and then begin to walk on fire. The 
piece of music is incredible and has a very hypnotic rhythm. And it was the
piece  of music that I then used to base the song upon. The inspiration was
totally a  musical one and a rhythmic one. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Did you write the poem that is narrated at the end of &quot;Jig Of
Life&quot;? 
</P>
<P>KATE: No, I didn't. My brother [John Carder Bush] wrote that. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: That's what some of us thought. It seemed like a slightly different
style. It  seemed more like his style -- from what people have been able to
infer of his  style without seeing much of his poetry. 
</P>
<P>	It's a really wonderful poem. 
</P>
<P>KATE: It is. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: So, tell him I like it. [Small laugh.] 
</P>
<P>	I find the use of strong symbolism and metaphor and allusions in your
lyrics to be  extremely interesting. For example, in &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;,
the woman who  is singing the song has been left by her lover and feels hurt,
and identifies herself  with a house. This is a biblical allusion. When she says
&quot;I wash the panes&quot;, it is a  triple entendre, because she's saying
she's washing the windows of her body,  which are the eyes. This means she's
crying, and by doing so, she's washing the  hurt and pain away. Then she says &quot;No
stranger's feet will enter me&quot; saying that  she won't let anyone into her
house, which is saying she won't let anyone into  her body, which is also
reinforced by the biblical use of &quot;feet&quot; as a euphemism for  &quot;private
parts&quot;. The layers of meaning here, are pretty incredible. 
</P>
<P>	Then a man tries to enter her life again, but she's too scared, and she
tries to  escape by flying away, but he turns into the wind. She then turns into
a mule,  perhaps for its stubborn ability to withstand the wind. And then he
also turns  into a mule. Now it seems that they have a ground for communication.
Because  mules are neuter, and they can communicate on a platonic level rather
than a  sexual level. 
</P>
<P>	Now a friend of mine believes that this last part is a flaw in the song,
because  mules are not really neuter after all. They are only sterile.
Personally, I think it  isn't a flaw because the idea comes across loud and
clear to me, and somehow it  seems that &quot;I change into the amoeba. Ooze.
Ooze.&quot; just wouldn't work so well.  So the question is, what do you think
of this interpretation? And could you  respond to my friend's slight criticism?

</P>
<P>KATE: And what was your friend's criticism? 
</P>
<P>	[&quot;You want my reply? What was the question?&quot; Oh dear, I've bored
Kate to  death....] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: He said that the ending is a flaw because mules are not really neuter,
they  are only sterile. 
</P>
<P>KATE: What does he mean? 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Well, it seems to me -- and to him -- that the end of the song is sort
of a  positive note because they've found a grounds for communication. And sort
of on  a platonic level, because mules might be seen as being platonic,
because.... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Why? [In an intrigued tone of voice.] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Oh... well... [Doug turns eight shades of red...] mules are sterile...
uh... a  donkey and a horse... you know... have a sexual relationship, and then
they have  mules, and mules don't have children, but they really can have sex.
They just  can't have children, but a lot of people actually think that they
just don't have  sex. Which isn't really true. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Right! [Little laugh.] Well, uh, [in an amused and puzzled tone of
voice] I  think you... it's kind of weird the level of interpretation that you
are reading into  things, because... I mean, a mule -- in our country -- all it
represents is a stupid  animal. They are considered stupid. And that's the
allusion that was being used  in that case. And it's very much a play on a
traditional song called &quot;The Two  Magicians&quot; about someone who's
trying to escape someone, and they keep  changing their form in order to escape
them. But the other thing keeps changing  its form. And that's actually what the
whole song is about -- someone who is  running away from something they don't
want to face, but wherever they go, the  thing will follow them. Basically, you
can't run away from things -- you've got to  confront things. And it's using the
person as the imagery of a house, where they  won't let anyone in, they lock all
the doors and windows, and put a guard on the  front door. But I think the
essence of the song is about someone trying to run  away from things they don't
like and not being able to escape -- because you  can't. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But if the symbol of mules is just stupidity, at the end, then it
would seem  like it would be a negative ending, and it just sort of seems to me,
most of your  songs... a lot of them... end on up notes. And it sort of seemed
like it was a  positive note at the end. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, I think the mule is that kind of... the stupid confrontation... I
mean,  there's not really that much to read into it. It was the idea of playing
around with  changing shape, and the mule imagery was something I liked
ordurely. The whole  thing of this wild, stupid, mad creature just turning
around and going, you know,  eeyore, eeyore [Kate makes convincing eeyore
sounds]. 
</P>
<P>	I don't know if you saw Pinoccio, but there's an incredibly heavy scene in
there,  where one of the little boys turns into a donkey -- a mule. And it's
very heavy  stuff. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: I haven't seen that since about six [which is at least a year or two
ago...],  but I think I remember that... it's a strong image. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, maybe you should see it again. It's a good film. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: In a recent interview you said &quot;I don't really know why people
think my  songs are strange.&quot; I'm not sure that this was said by the same
person who sings  &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot; at the end of the song &quot;Leave
It Open&quot;. In any case,  what is really strange about the singing at the end
of &quot;Leave It Open&quot;, is that if  you play it backwards, it also sounds
like intelligible singing. In fact, it sounds to  me like &quot;And they said
they wouldn't let me in&quot;, which is wonderful because  then it has the
opposite meaning backwards as it does forwards. 
</P>
<P>	There is also something like this on Hounds of Love in the song &quot;Watching
You  Without Me&quot;. There is one part where you sing what to me sounds like &quot;Really
 see&quot; repeated several times. And if you play this backwards, it sounds
exactly the  same. Still like &quot;Really see&quot;, though I'm not sure it's &quot;Really
see&quot; -- it just sounds  like that to me. But whatever it sounds like, it
sounds exactly the same  backwards. Well, the question is, I'd be really
interested in knowing how you did  this sort of manipulation. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, that's something I've been experimenting with for a while, and
would  like to continue experimenting. It's just a way of using backwards ideas,
but  actually saying something cohesively. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But how do you actually get a message or singing which sounds like 
something both forwards and backwards. And what are the technical issues 
involved. I mean, it seems like it would be really hard to do. 
</P>
<P>KATE: It is. It's very difficult -- it takes a lot of time and an awful lot
of patience. 
</P>
<P>	[Kate is saved by the bell, as her brother is at the door, and my half hour
is up. I  talked to both of Kate's brothers sometime later, however, and neither
had any  qualms about giving away the secret of the two-way messages. It
involves listening  to singing played backwards on a tape deck, learning to sing
the backwards  sounds, and then recording that strange singing backwards. 
</P>
<P>	In any case, Kate agrees to answer a couple more questions....] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Of your albums, which one is your favorite? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Ummm... I think the last album you do is always the one that's closest
to you  because you've just spent the nearest part of your life to it, but I
think for  artistic fulfillment, I think The Dreaming was certainly quite
rewarding to have  actually achieved some of the things that we set out to do.
[Doug can't agree  more.] But you have very much a strange relationship -- I
don't know if you  really like anything you do. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Well... I like it a lot, so... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Good! [Laughs.] 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Before we end the interview, one more quick question -- what do you
feed  your cats? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Ummm... food, normally. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: What kind of food? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Tinned food... and fish. Fiiiishy wiiiishy! 
</P>
<P>[Very! But I won't say anything. 
</P>
<P>(&quot;Watching the storm start to form over America&quot;.) Several hours
later, at home,  I turn on the TV news and hear that hurricane Kate has just hit
Florida. But I was  blown away years ago by a more Gael-ic Kate.]

Subject: KB interview 
</P>
<P>&gt; From jer: <BR> &gt; It's hard to believe that poetry that is
consistent, and basically good poetry,  should also be accidental. I can believe
that of Jon Anderson, who writes  meaningless phrases that you find meaning in,
like patterns on a  randomly-patterned wall, but not with coherent poetry. 
</P>
<P>I've written a little bit of (bad) poetry. What's really strange is that
often I just  write what I think is nonsense. A bunch of phrases that pop into
my mind, with  images and vague symbols -- but nothing coherent. Then I might
find the poem in a  pile of junk a while later, and when I read it, I know
exactly what it means. So, did I  put that meaning there unconsciously when I
wrote the poem? Or did I just read  that meaning into the poem later? 
</P>
<P>&gt; Maybe there's more to it than that... I wonder if John Carder Bush
reads her  lyrics and says, &quot;why don't you change this to say ...&quot; ? 
</P>
<P>I dunno. Maybe, but I kind of doubt it. What's interesting is that Kate said
that  the &quot;tenner&quot; / &quot;tenor&quot; double entendre was not
intended. On the other hand, I  asked John Carder Bush if the &quot;morning&quot;
/ &quot;mourning&quot; double entendre in &quot;My  Lagan Love&quot; was
intentional and he said that it was. Now I really want to ask Kate if  the
triple entendre with &quot;I wash the panes&quot; (&quot; I wash the windows&quot;
/ &quot;I cry&quot; / &quot;I  wash the hurt and pain&quot;) in &quot;Get Out Of
My House&quot; was intentional. It seems *so*  perfect that it must have been!
But if she thinks about this enough to have come up  with such a perfect triple
entendre here, then how could she have missed the  &quot;tenner&quot; / &quot;tenor&quot;
pun? Maybe it is all intentional, but only subconsciously.... 
</P>
<P>There was a very interesting interview with Kate in a recent issue of Hot
Press.  She says some things that seem to hint that she does operate on a
subconcious level  for many things. For example, the interviewer asked her about
the covers to  &quot;Lionheart&quot; and &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and said
they might be seen as being somewhat  kinky. Kate said that she hadn't thought
about them that way before, but now that  he mentioned it, maybe she did see
that they could be seen that way.

<P>Date: Fri, 10 Jan 86 17:10:17 EST <BR> From: hsut@purdue-ecn.ARPA (Tsun-Yuk
Hsu) <BR> Subject: Did Kate put it there? 
</P>
<P>Doug brought up some interesting points in his interview with Kate: if
there's a  fairly transparent allusion or pun in some poem or lyrics, is it
REALLY there if the  writer denies he put it there intentionally? Harlan
Ellison, for example, likes to claim  that his stories are very simple and
straightforward, and complains that people read  too much into them. 
</P>
<P>It's interesting that John Bush claims that the wordplay in his lyrics is
intentional,  while Kate denies many of the puns Doug and other lovehounders
found in her  lyrics. Maybe John Bush, being a poet in the more traditional
sense, is aware of  wordplay and punning on a more conscious level, while Kate
does things more on a  subconscious level. 
</P>
<P>Another theory (close to what Structuralist critics think) which sidesteps
the  problem of the author &quot;subconsciously&quot; putting things into the
text is that which sees  texts as constructs, analogous to mathematical
constructs. You can build a  mathematical object (such as some weird graph) and
not realise all its properties at  the moment you created the construct. Same
thing with poems and other text.  Maybe Kate's lyrics has all these puns which
she was not aware of. 
</P>
<P>Of course there are problems with this view being applied to foggy, 
non-mathematical things like poetry. Using this approach, a critic can almost
say  anything he wants about a text. If the author of the text denies having put
something  in the text, the critic can always say: &quot;It is an inherent
property of your text, you just  didn't see it.&quot;

Subject: Today's dose of Katrivia 
</P>
<P>As related to me by Del Palmer: Kate did indeed do the voice of the
priest/judge  in &quot;Waking The Witch&quot;. Del didn't seem 100% sure what
they used in the final mix,  but thinks it is Kate through a harmonizer set two
octaves down. They also tried  using slowed down tape, but that didn't come out
as well. Originally they wanted a  man to do the part, but they couldn't find
anyone who could do it right. 
</P>
<P>I think it's good that Kate sang the part of the judge, because it makes it
seem as  if she's putting herself on trial in her mind -- which is a really
powerful image. 
</P>
<P>From the mouth of Jay Bush: 
</P>
<P>Originally his poem in &quot;Jig Of Life&quot; was supposed to be read by
some famous  Irish person, but then they decided to have him read it with a
put-on Irish accent,  and speed up his voice to sound like an Irish woman (ed
note: or maybe like Irish  chipmunks...). In the end, they decided to leave it
at normal speed. 
</P>
<P>From the mouth of Paddy Bush: 
</P>
<P>They will definitely do another concert 
</P>
<P>tour -- if not this year, then next. And it will make the last concert pale
in  comparison. And they will bring it to the U.S. 
</P>
<P>From the mouth of Kate: 
</P>
<P>They probably won't be doing another concert tour in the near future. She
feels  she can reach a lot more people with less effort through film or TV, but
she hopes  to do another concert tour before she's old and grey. 
</P>
<P>I think that Paddy's going to put on a wig and leotard and leg warmers and
do it  himself if Kate doesn't change her mind....

<P>Well, fortunately I had all my questions written out on 42 neat little index
cards  (of which I made it through 13 or so). Otherwise, I would have just sat
there with a  glazed look on my face, or something. I wasted five or ten minutes
before I  remembered that I was supposed to be doing an interview and started to
record,  being nervous and acting neurotic... (And wondering why her make-up
looked so  strange... But then when I went to England, many of the women were
wearing the  same strange style of make-up... And I went into a store,
yesterday, and the cashier  was wearing that same unusual style of make-up --
and guess what? She had a  British accent.)

Subject: Re: Kate Bushopathy 
</P>
<P>Mr. Alfke, I wouldn't expect someone who thinks that Madonna has merit to 
agree with the statement that pop music can be *real* literature. But I see no
reason  for you to spoil the fun of those who were forced to write lots of
unenjoyable papers  in high school on symbolism in *Hamlet* and *The Great
Gatsby* and the collected  works of Keats, and who have finally found something
that they can apply all of this  previously wasted education on and *enjoy*. 
</P>
<P>You might also speculate on the the fact that Kate refuses to talk about how
she  does her two-way messages or the contents of them, even though she *does*
admit  reluctantly that they are there, and how this strange attitude of hers
might bear on  her unwillingness to talk about symbolism in her words. 
</P>
<P>You might also speculate on the fact that when I asked John Carder Bush
similar  questions about his lyrics to those I asked Kate, he said that I was
right. Consider  that Kate has said on several occasions that John is one of her
biggest influences. 
</P>
<P>Your parody of my interview is I feel not very appropriate. This would be
much  more accurate: 
</P>
<P>DOUG: In the song &quot;The Dreaming&quot; you sing &quot;The Pull of the
Bush&quot; to mention the  attraction of the Aborigine in Australia to the
unspoiled land. But you are also  making a pun on your own name. Did you have
any special intention in doing this,  other than in being a bit humorous? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Pun on my name? I'm not sure what you mean. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: &quot;Bush&quot; occurs in &quot;Pull of the Bush&quot;. 
</P>
<P>KATE: So? 
</P>
<P>DOUG: That's your name. 
</P>
<P>KATE: I had nothing of the sort in mind when I wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But why is &quot;Bush&quot; capitalized on the lyric sheet? 
</P>
<P>KATE: It wasn't intentional. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: And in the video, the two male dancers pull on you from either side
when  you sing that line. 
</P>
<P>KATE: How people interpret your art really has nothing to do with you
anyway. But  it's great if people get as much out of it as they can. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But surely... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Excuse me for a moment -- I have to use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>In any case, I just got a letter from John Carder Bush (and a pile of his
poetry)  that some might find somewhat interesting: 
</P>
<P>Dear Doug, 
</P>
<P>Thanks for your interesting letter; it's nice to meet someone these days who
gets  excited about words. 
</P>
<P>[Two pages of stuff...] 
</P>
<P>Entendres are, indeed, interesting things. Over the years I have evolved a
sort of  personal understanding of this planet / God / life in terms of rhyme.
If you can see  the Supreme Being as merely a harmonizing force, then
coincidence, synchronicity  are easily explained; as the poet makes his rhymes,
the pattern of life makes its  rhymes. And in double, tripple, or whatever,
entendres, the poet exercises a god-like  technique. 
</P>
<P>Keeping this in mind, I feel that for someone working in an artistic medium,
and  thence becoming &quot;godlike&quot;, by imitation, there must come a series
of levels of  progress, each level preceded by intense periods of obsession and
worry with the  creation -- late nights, wrong food, ill health, etc. -- and at
each level something  crystallises, and an energy vortex with a consciousness of
its own starts going. 
</P>
<P>Once it is able to generate its own creative direction, it needs to be fed
and  looked after like any machine, but it can be relied on to offer up an
image, a line, in  which the levels are all there, up and down, and can be
understood depending on the  level of the receiver. Sufi stories, Zen stories,
Greek myths all have this spiralling  mult-interpretation power, as do all the
great written works of religion. You can  keep coming back to them and finding
the next level confirmed as you grow. 
</P>
<P>So I am sure you are right when you find these meanings in Kate's music, but
 whether it was conscious or unconscious is not important if you accept that she
is a  vehicle for the Great Rhymer. Kate's subject matter for her lyrics has
always been  extraordinary, which I think comes from an ability to empathise
with life forms that  is unusually sensitive. 
</P>
<P>So, I hope you enjoy these poems and watch out for Big Sky, soon to be
released  over here and the video is the best so far. 
</P>
<P>All that's good, 
</P>
<P>John 
</P>

<P>As for your ridicule of poor |&gt;oug's question to Kate re catfood, IED has
said  before and will say again that in his opinion that was --seriously -- the
most  interesting and daring question (among many such) that |&gt;oug put to
Kate during his  interview -- and if nothing else, |&gt;oug's questions were
certainly the most  &quot;challenging&quot; ones anyone has posed to Kate so
far, so this is saying alot. It wasn't a  &quot;silly&quot; question at all, nor
was Kate's answer without serious meaning. Whatever its  faults (a matter of
opinion, perhaps), |&gt;oug's interview is worth careful re-reading by  all Kate
fans.

again; and misK. mailbag items 
</P>
<P>&gt; I have never met anyone so pompous as to suggest to an artist TO HER
FACE  that he knows more about her songs than she does. 
</P>
<P> That's a really tough way to look at |&gt;oug's interview. When IED looks
back on  his own encounter with Kate (not more than ten days later than |&gt;oug's,
though a  continent away), he is much less inclined to trash |&gt;oug for what
were undeniably  some poor word-choices on his part. What |&gt;oug says is true:
IED would (and did)  make just as big a fool of himself in Kate's presence as |&gt;oug
did -- his foolishness  just didn't happen to manifest itself in quite the same
way, that's all. All Kate Bush  fans beware before casting the first stone:
considering God in the abstract is  relatively easy, but actually carrying on a
conversation with Her in the flesh is not. 
</P>
<P>And whether |&gt;oug's attitude was &quot;conceited&quot; or not, he
definitely got an  interesting and revealing response from Kate, and that in
itself is a kind of  vindication of the argument (which IED espouses) that
journalists who interview  Kate, for all their dispassionate savoir-faire in the
crunch, would be better replaced  by jumpy, scared-as-hell Kate fans; in the
long run, we'd all learn a lot more about  her and her art. |&gt;oug's tactics
may have been miscalculated, but his intentions were  right on the money. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Do you think &lt;Kate&gt;'d really be flattered by all this adolescent
fantasising? (I  don't know, perhaps you ARE adolescents, in which case
congratulations on  discovering Kate Bush at such tender years :-) 
</P>
<P> IED is no adolescent...alas. He's approximately Kate's age. Kate might
follow  the tongue-in-cheek tone of many of Love-Hounds's postings (even a few
of IED's)  a bit better than you seem to, good Plumsteader. And |&gt;oug, she
does too follow  Love-Hounds. You have no faith! She's got a secret spy network
carefully monitoring  Love-Hounds discussions and giving her weekly minutes of
the latest hot issues. In  fact, you wait and see if there isn't a posting from
her this week, ridiculing IED's  idea of &quot;Gaffa&quot; being a place-name.

<P>From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt; <BR> Date: Fri, 21 Apr 89
20:56:38 EST <BR> Subject: Mules 
</P>
<P>I recently was looking through some comments IED made on my interview with 
Kate Bush and I have decided to take a few moments to counter. (|&gt;oug is also
 wondering how his interview got so thoroughly reformated by IED. Did IED go 
through the effort of retyping |&gt;oug's entire interview? This would hardly
have been  necessary considering that |&gt;oug can most certainly guarantee that
he still has it  online.) 
</P>
<P>&gt; KATE: Right! Well, um...I think you...It's kind of weird the level of 
interpretation that you are reading into things, because...I mean, a mule--in
our  country--all it represents is a stupid animal. They are considered stupid.

</P>
<P>&gt; &lt;This, of course, is the dominant significance of the mule as a &gt;
symbol in the  United States, as well. The expression &quot;stubborn as a &gt;
mule&quot; is considerably better  known in both countries than the &gt; sterile
condition of the animal--as the  interviewer ought to know.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Of course, &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;stuborn&quot; are two completely
different words with  completely different meanings. Yes, in the U.S. mules are
used very often to  symbolize stubborness. They are not however often used to
symbolize stupidity. In  fact, mules are often very stubborn animals. They are
also, in fact, very intelligent  animals. The distinction bewteen stupidity and
stuborness is something that Mr.  Marvick ought very well to know. 
</P>
<P>The reason that the use of the mule to represent stuborness did not occur to
me  is that the song &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; seemed to have a happy
ending. (And of  course, the mule could never symbolize stupidity to me because
mules just don't  symbolize stupity --jackasses do, but a mule is not a
jackass). The man and woman  seemed to have found something in common in their
muleness and sang to each  other. 
</P>
<P>I'm not the only one who had this interpretation. I spoke to many people
about  the song over the years, and most of them seemed to feel also that the
song had a  happy ending, and that the man and woman were happy to be mules
together. The  challenge then in interpreting the song was to figure out why it
was a happy thing  for the man and woman to become mules. The sexual neutrality
of mules then  seemed like a likely explanation. Other people I talked with
before approaching  Kate with the issue seemed to think it a reasonable theory.

</P>
<P>Kate, on the other hand, says that she intended the song to have a unhappy 
ending. The song is in my opinion one of the very best songs ever written,
however,  her unhappy intention with the ending certainly wasn't communicated to
me. Quite  to the contary. 
</P>
<P>&gt; DOUG: (Kate is saved by the bell, as her brother is at the door, and my
half  hour is up. I talked to both of Kate's brothers some time later, however,
and neither  had any qualms about giving away the secret of the two-way
messages. It involves  listening to singing played backwards on a tape deck,
learning to sing the backwards  sounds, and then recording that strange singing
backwards....) 
</P>
<P>&gt; &lt;This is apparently a reference to the explanation given by Paddy
and John to  the entire audience of the 1985 Kate Bush Convention in Romford,
England. In fact,  however, their description of the process does nothing to
explain the apparent  presence of two simultaneous messages, only the basic
method of creating the first,  &quot;backwards&quot; message.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Do you have to assume me a liar, IED? This is not a reference to the
explanation  given by Paddy and John at the KBC Convention -- rather it is a
reference primarily  to an explanation given to me by John Carder Bush at Tower
Records in Greenwich  Villiage. He told me that Kate got the idea from this guy
who used to appear on talk  shows in England. He was sort of a human tape
recorder. You could give him any  sentence and he could speak it backwards. On
the talk shows, they would have him  speak into a tape recorder, then they would
play the tape backwards, and out would  come the sentence that he had been asked
to speak. 
</P>
<P>I assume that the process of achieving a two-way message is much like the 
process of coming up with a palindrome. It takes a good feel for doing this sort
of  stuff, and lots of fiddling until you get something that works out. Because
of Kate's  auditory two-way message, and some unusual artwork I had seen once, a
few years  back I was inspired to devise a visual two-way message. If you read
it right-side up,  is says &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;. If you read the
very same script upside down, it  says &quot;They would not let me in&quot;.
Now, it's not particularly legible in either direction,  but I'm no great
artist, so I'm sure someone else could do a better job. If I can do a 
rudimentary visual two-way message, I'm sure Kate can with a bit of effort do a 
two-way aditory message.

<P>Date: Tue, 25 Apr 89 13:44 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Ooch! Ouch! Jeez, that
smarts!--MUST BE DOUG ALAN'S BACK... 
</P>
<P> &gt; Of course, &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;stuborn&quot; are two
completely different words with  completely different meanings. Yes, in the U.S.
mules are used very often to  symbolize stubborness. They are not however often
used to symbolize stupidity. In  fact, mules are often very stubborn animals.
They are also, in fact, very intelligent  animals. The distinction bewteen
stupidity and stuborness is something that Mr.  Marvick ought very well to know.

</P>
<P> IED must conclude that Doug doesn't remember that this fuss over the &quot;mules&quot;
 and &quot;jackasses&quot; was already the subject of a dull argument in
Love-Hounds a long  time ago. Why Doug suddenly wants to resuscitate it now IED
has no idea; but he is  happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>Let it be understood from the beginning by anyone masochistic enough to be 
reading the following, however, that this time DOUG STARTED IT! 
</P>
<P>Doug simply hasn't got the point. (Admittedly, IED didn't make that point
very  clear in his too-brief annotation which is re-printed above, so perhaps he
shares the  blame with Doug.) If Doug looks at what Kate said (above), he will
see that her  understanding is that the mule has a simple and one-dimensional
symbolic meaning.  Whether that is Doug's understanding or not is quite
irrelevant. This is the basic  fact to which IED addressed himself. 
</P>
<P>IED's reasoning was this: Kate sees the mule as &quot;stupid&quot;. Well,
actually the mule  is not associated--literally--with &quot;stupidity&quot;
either in England or the U.S. What, then,  could Kate have in mind? Well,
obviously, she is thinking either of the term  &quot;stubborn as a mule&quot; or
&quot;dumb/stupid as a jackass&quot;. The point being that, although  there are
differences between the precise definitions of the words &quot;stubborn&quot;
and  &quot;stupid&quot;, just as there are differences between the precise
definitions of the words  &quot;mule&quot;, &quot;donkey&quot; and &quot;jackass&quot;,
those differences are much smaller (especially to one  who, like Kate, has just
said that she thinks of the term &quot;mule&quot; as having only a  simple and
casual symbolic significance) than the basic similarities between the  words.
Thus &quot;stubborn as a mule&quot;--which does indeed conjure up associations
with  &quot;stupdity&quot;, whether Doug likes it or not, and whether their
precise meanings are  identical or not--and &quot;dumb as a jackass&quot;, seem
to be essentially interchangeable in  Kate's view-- as they are in most people's
common, casual understanding of these  expressions. In short: identical? No.
Very similar and interchangeable in such casual  contexts? Certainly! 
</P>
<P>All this has nothing to do with Doug's even more irrelevant and inapplicable
 drivel about the sexual condition of these various animals. Kate has already
said that  the association for her was a very simple one, having only one basic
symbolic  meaning, nothing more. She couldn't have been more explicit on this
point than she  was in her statement above. So what could possibly be the point
of Doug's insisting  on the actual distinctions which may exist between mules
and jackasses? Kate  doesn't recognize these distinctions (or wouldn't
recog-nize them unless some  fussbudget insisted pedantically on pointing them
out to her), so what relevance do  they have to Kate's song? The answer is none.

</P>
<P> &gt;The reason that the use of the mule to represent stuborness did not
occur to me  is that the song &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; seemed to have a
happy ending. (And of  course, the mule could never symbolize stupidity to me
because mules just don't  symbolize stupity --jackasses do, but a mule is not a
jackass). The man and woman  seemed to have found something in common in their
muleness and sang to each  other. 
</P>
<P> This is quite incredible. How could Doug have thought that the ending of 
GOoMH was &quot;happy&quot;? It's true that there are many subtle changes in
Kate's vocal  inflection toward the end of that song. One could say that in the
line &quot;I change into  the Mule&quot; she seems to be emoting differently
than in the earlier lines. But  considering the &quot;mad&quot;, frantic
confrontation of &quot;hee-haw&quot; sounds between male and  female characters
in the final section of the song, it's patently ridiculous to call the  ending &quot;happy&quot;!
Certainly the lyrics don't help such a reading. 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, the ending does indeed contain the &quot;some sort of
hope in  there&quot; that Kate said (of The Ninth Wave ) she feels should be
part of all works of  art. If Doug re-reads the passage in question from his own
interview (IED  reproduces it below), he'll see that Kate was saying that the
theme of the song was  the error people can make of running away from their
problems, and that the only  way to solve problems is to confront them. She also
explains that when the female  character in Get Out of My House changes into a
mule (whether a stubborn one or a  stupid one), she does finally turn and
confront the male character (who has changed  into a mule as well). 
</P>
<P>This is the quintessential Kate Bush &quot;ending&quot;--sad but hopeful,
very much like  the ending of The Ninth Wave. In both, the protagonist has come
to a new  realization of the &quot;right way&quot; to proceed/feel/think, and is
therefore able better to  resign herself to whatever fate might befall her,
whether that fate be &quot;happy&quot; or not.  And this, of course, is an
essential element of Kate's own avowed philosophy,  described by her in numerous
interviews. 
</P>
<P>So we do not learn what actually happens when the two mules confront each 
other in GOoMH ; nor is it important. What is important is that the protagonist
has  finally been able to confront the force which threatens her--she is no
longer  running from it. In a similar way the heroine of The Ninth Wave, in the
final bars of  The Morning Fog, has found reasons for living: whether she will
actually survive the  physical ordeal or not, she has at least gained a new
appreciation of the important  aspects of her life (love of family; and faith in
the human spirit, so to speak, as  represented by her &quot;future self&quot; in
Jig of Life ). It's therefore extremely important,  IED believes, that both The
Dreaming and Hounds of Love, as albums, conclude with  the same basic situation.
In both, the ultimate &quot;fate&quot; of the protagonist is not  resolved,
because that is not the artist's concern. Rather, it is the insight that those 
protagonists gain along the way that matters. 
</P>
<P>This is why Kate may have made the choice of the mule, also. It is now known
 that, to Kate, the mule is a &quot;stupid&quot; animal. Its actions, in other
words, are  &quot;thought-less&quot;: prompted by the crudest form of emotional
stimuli or instincts. Kate  has more than once insisted that music (art) is &quot;pure
emotion&quot;--especially in the  Russell Harty interview. When Harty
patronizingly says &quot;We've been to  Bronte-land...Where will the arrow of
your powerful intellect fall next?&quot; Kate's  immediate and strong reply is: &quot;Well,
I think the answer to that is that art is  emotion. Art is pure emotion...&quot;
Her reply has always seemed to IED to represent an  implied preference for the
value of emotion over the intellect. If so, the choice of the  &quot;stupid&quot;
mule as the guise in which the heroine of GOoMH finally faces her  &quot;problem&quot;
makes excellent sense. 
</P>
<P> &gt;I'm not the only one who had this interpretation. I spoke to many
people about  the song over the years, and most of them seemed to feel also that
the song had a  happy ending, and that the man and woman were happy to be mules
together...The  sexual neutrality of mules then seemed a likely explanation... 
</P>
<P> Again, IED doesn't see any signs of &quot;happy endings&quot; in GOoMH, at
least not in  the banal sense that Doug and his friends apparently mean. The
fact that Doug was  joined in this interpretation by &quot;many people&quot;
adds no evidence of any sort that the  mules enjoy a &quot;happy&quot;
reconciliation! Doug will have to learn that he can't  strengthen an inherently
weak intellectual position merely by claiming that advocates  as
undiscriminating as himself have joined him in embracing it. &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
 doesn't become &quot;Cloudbursting&quot; simply because a lot of careless
listeners continue to  misspell it. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Kate, on the other hand, says that she intended the song to have a
unhappy  ending. 
</P>
<P> Kate does not say that she &quot;intended the song to have a &lt;sic&gt;
unhappy ending.&quot; If  Doug reads his own interview very carefully at that
point (IED reproduces the  passage unedited below), he will see that Kate is
basically agreeing that the choice of  the &quot;stupid&quot; mule madly turning
and confronting the other character is a more or  less hopeful ending, in that
it represents the resolution of Kate's theme (which is  that it's important to
confront one's problems, and not to run from them). There is  no contradiction
between the song and her comments in Doug's interview. 
</P>
<P> &gt;&gt; &lt;Except that it does not sound like &quot;And they said they
wouldn't let me in&quot;  when played backwards.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&gt; Says you! 
</P>
<P> Well, actually, says the Kate Bush Club, too. When the solution of &quot;We
let the  weirdness in&quot; was finally submitted, it was explained in the
Newsletter that such was  &quot;the&quot; answer to the puzzle. There was no
mention of any palindromic backwards  message at all. On the contrary, Lisa
printed several mistaken answers produced by  people who had been &quot;on the
wrong track&quot;; and all of those were attempts to  interpret the message as
words when played backwards. So although there has never  been any explicit
denial of the possibility that Doug's theory has any basis in fact,  there is
certainly enough against it to make it seem doubtful at the very least. 
</P>
<P>IED is grateful that Doug finally mentioned where he had heard about this 
subject from John (at Tower), and he apologizes for seeming to doubt Doug's 
honesty. That was uncalled for. 
</P>
<P>But John's explanation to Doug (at least as he just described it yesterday),
does  not in any way add support to Doug's own theory that Kate intended the
message to  say something specific when heard backwards. All John seems to have
been  describing was an instance of a man who could rattle off words and phrases
 backwards when he heard them. Obviously those words and phrases sounded like 
backwards nonsense when he uttered them, not new palindromic words and  phrases!
How, then, Doug came to think that this source inspired Kate to create a 
palindromic phrase, rather than merely a re-recorded backwards phrase, is 
inexplicable. There is simply no evidence for it, whereas there is strong
evidence (in  the Newsletter ) against it. 
</P>
<P>This whole issue is especially frustrating because of the lost opportunities
which  Doug's interview is filled with. Unfortunately, because of Doug's
mysterious  insistence on having Kate sit and listen to him rather than
encouraging responses  from Kate, he allowed many chances to slip through his
fingers. IED reproduces  three excerpts from Doug's interview, without cuts, but
with (merciless)  annotations. 
</P>
<P>In the first excerpt Doug raises the issue of the mules. In the second, he
brings  up the &quot;backwards&quot; messages. And in the third he trots out
still another of his wild  theories, this one about There Goes a Tenner. Yet in
each of these three cases,  rather than asking Kate to answer any of his many
premises, Doug just runs on and  on with his ideas (presenting some--admittedly
not all, but a surprisingly large  number nonetheless--as though they were
already proven facts); and then he asks  absurdly at the end, &quot;How did you
do that?&quot; or &quot;Comment?&quot;--presumptious questions  that are
guaranteed to elicit minimal replies. The impression one gets is of a Doug  Alan
lecture, which Doug has generously allowed Kate Bush to attend--providing she 
accepts the role of an appreciative and reasonably quiet audience--on the
subject of  bizarre hidden meanings in the work of Kate Bush! 
</P>
<P> How this interview could ever have taken place in the manner it did is a 
mystery. What did Doug think was the point of having an interview with Kate
Bush,  anyway? Evidently it wasn't to learn something new. (Even so, Kate
provided the  key to a correct under-standing of the mule symbolism in her
answer--which IED  pointed out above--but Doug, apparently still
misunderstanding her words even now,  claimed wrongly yesterday that Kate's song
was inconsistent with her stated  objectives. For when Kate answers &quot;Yes, I
think the mule is that kind of...the stupid  confrontation...&quot; she is
agreeing with Doug that there is a hopeful element to the  ending of the song.)
It reads more as though our &quot;humble&quot; pseudo-moderator has no  real
intention except to &quot;present&quot; Kate with his explanations of her own
work,  hoping (with truly baffling naivete) that she will actually agree with
them! 
</P>
<P>When instead she actually decides she has to reject them out of hand, and in
very  decisive language--particularly for Kate, whose exceptional courtesy
usually leads  her to avoid saying &quot;No, that's wrong&quot; whenever
possible--Doug betrays a great deal  more than surprise. So unprepared is he,
apparently, to accept the possibility that his  ideas are ludicrously off base,
that he actually doubts whether Kate is in control of  her own conscious
thoughts --and he voices those doubts to her face ! 
</P>
<P> IED will close now, though he could pick similar holes in almost any other 
excerpt from &quot;humble&quot; Doug's &quot;interview&quot;. The problem is,
all this takes a lot of  time. Doug knows how to get IED's attention, and he's
done it. But he must finish  this up. Anyway, what would be the point of
continuing? Doug is clearly a man  enmeshed in a whole skein of strange,
delusory theories surrounding Kate's work.  If Kate herself could not free him
from his prison of egocentric fantasy, it is certain  that IED will not succeed
in doing so.

</P>
<P>Now, regarding IED's detailed critique of my interview with Kate... I'd like
to  thank IED for his constructive criticism, but I assure him it is entirely
unnecessary.  Why bother, when I will be the first to admit it was a highly
botched affair? I had  never interviewed someone before -- much less an idol. I
had all these questions  written down on little index cards, and it was all I
could do to read the cards and try  to avoid wetting my pants or fainting. All
higher level brain function was inoperative  during the interview. All I can say
is that it was me that got to make myself a fool in  front of Kate Bush for half
an hour and not you... NYAH, NYAH! 
</P>
<P>I also find it amusing and ironic that IED continually lambasts my bizarre
theories  as the product of a derranged mind, while presenting his own
ridiculous theories as  objective fact. Many of my derranged theories were not,
in fact, developed by me  alone. Some of them (particularly the theories about &quot;Get
Out of my House&quot;) came  about by consent through group discussion in this
very mailing list by me and several  other big KB fans that were around at the
time this mailing list was formed. (I think  I will provide some more early
Love-Hounds history sometime soon.) I guess we are  all bozos on this bus.

<P> OK. But IED did get to make a fool of himself in front of Kate for about
three  minutes once. And he really made a fool of himself in Kate's own house
once, for  more than half an hour. So :&gt;oug has no great cachet in that
regard.

<P>Regarding The Island Ear interview that was posted a while back, I remember
it  very well. The interviewer for The Island Ear was a very pretty lass that 
interviewed Kate immediately before I did. We both waited in fear and

<P> IED believes this is the same Long Island female-journalist Kate-fan who
was  introduced to IED in NYC by Vickie Mapes early in '85. She was nice enough,

</P>
<P>[re Interpretation:] 
</P>
<P>If Joe Dumbbrain thinks that God speaks to him through &quot;Into the Groove&quot;
and  this has a profound effect on his life, then to him this interpretation is
incredibly  relevant, even if it is completely braindead. Even if my
interpretation of &quot;Get Out of  My House&quot; made no sense at all, if it
had an effect on me, then to me it would be  relevant. And who would you be to
tell me that it isn't! 
</P>
<P>It's as if you've never even heard of more modern art criticism (actually, 
Postmodern Deconstructualism) which says that what's really irrelevant is what
the  artist intended. The artists intentions don't matter at all, they say. All
that matters is  what you get out of it. That the real artist is not the creator
of the work of art, but  the viewer of the art who finds something of value in
it -- he creates the art inside  of himself. Personally, I think that this
theory was invented by a bunch of failed  artists turned critics who want
something to feel proud about, but it shows that there  is wide spectrum of
beliefs on the matter. You stand on one side of the spectrum  IED, and the
Deconstructionalists stand on the other. Personally, I stand somewhere  in the
middle. The artists intentions are relevant and so are the viewers 
interpretations, whether they were intended by the artist or not. Your refusal
to  even recognize that there are other reasonable positions on the matter,
other than  your own very narrow one, is exceedingly myopic. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, you contradict Kate's very own opinions on the matter, which
she  has said many times. One such time was to me: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think the interpretations that people have of your songs afterwards
are nothing  to do with me anyway. I think it's up to them to get what they can
out of the song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&gt; Then why did you ask her? And why have you mentioned this issue more
than  once since then with clear indications that you thought it was
significant? Just  curious. 
</P>
<P>Well, for one, I wanted to hear Kate say &quot;Fiiiiishy wiiiiishy&quot;.
Also, I was curious.  Also I have met people who claim to feed their cats a
vegetarian diet. They claimed  to feed their cats spinach lasagna. Now, one
thing you might immediately notice  from this is that it contains dairy products
(mainly cheese). Many people who call  themselves &quot;vegetarians&quot; have
no qualms about eating dairy products. I am no expert  on feline biology, and I
have no idea whether or not the cats tended by the people I  met, went blind and
died, but you will have to do a bit more work than anyone has  done so far to
convince me that the necessary amino acids a cat needs that are  lacking in a
strict vegetarian diet, are not found in dairy products.

WORthy kate bushological stuDieS... 
</P>
<P>This next bit is really hard to believe, but it's true. Until recently none
of us  Love-Hounds was in a position to question this nonsense about Kate having
said  &quot;ordurely&quot; to |&gt;ouglas during his interview with her, because
none of us had anything  to go by except what |&gt;ouglas himself chose to give
us. 
</P>
<P>About two weeks ago, however, IED finally got the chance to hear a faithful 
audio copy of |&gt;oug's mindboggling, tour-de-force interview. At last IED has
been  able to hear for himself what this interview sounded like, and what was
actually said  between Kate Bush and |&gt;oug Alan, instead of having to
continue to rely on |&gt;oug's  own necessarily suspect transcription. 
</P>
<P>And what did IED discover, upon listening to this tape? Why, only that the
word  Kate used during the exchange in question--and it is quite clear, folks,
there is no  doubt about it--is &quot;AUDIALLY&quot;. Not, of course, &quot;ordurely&quot;,
but &quot;AUDIALLY&quot;.  (Before Julian or another of our more literate
Love-Hounds questions the legitimacy  of this word, IED hastens to agree that
its linguistic status is questionable, but it is  nevertheless a word which Kate
has used on at least two other occasions--among  them an interview she gave for
Canadian television only a few days after enduring  her thirty minutes with |&gt;oug.
Though not found in Webster, it can be a pretty  sensible adverb, as when used,
for example, in a context like &quot;visually and audially&quot;.  Whether one
likes the word or not, however, one thing is certain, and that is that  Kate
says &quot;AUDIALLY&quot; in |&gt;oug's interview, not &quot;ordurely&quot;.) 
</P>
<P>As usual, |&gt;oug has simply been blathering--with completely unmerited 
self-confidence--on a subject which lies entirely outside his area of expertise.
(In  this case, that subject is the English language.)

<P>[This is Doug's prepared list of questions. Not all have been actually
asked, due to  time limitations. --WIE]
</P>
<P>&quot;My Kate Bush Interview&quot; (Questions only)
</P>
<P>Questions from Doug Alan, prepared for the interview 1985 (see Garden). 
</P>
<P>I read an interview where the interviewer asked you if &quot;Running Up That
Hill&quot; is  about the contemplation of suicide. And I thought that was pretty
amusing, because  it seemed to me clearly not to about any such thing at all. On
the other hand,  strangely enough, that's just what &quot;Under The Ivy&quot;
seems to be about to me. The  tone of the song is very, very sad. And it seems
to be about longing for the lost  innocence of youth. Perhaps a follow-up to &quot;In
Search Of Peter Pan&quot;. A white rose is  a strong image in the song. And it
could be a symbol for friendship or innocence, but  it could also be a symbol
for death. You sing &quot;Away from the party&quot;, and it seems like  it could
mean &quot;away from the problems and triviality of modern day life&quot;. You
sing  &quot;It wouldn't take me long to tell you how to find it&quot;, and it
seems like you might  almost be addressing Death. You mention a secret, but
never mention what it is.  Could it be the taboo subject of suicide? 
</P>
<P>What are your feelings about this interpretation, and what were you
intentions  with the song? 
</P>
<P>&quot;My Lagan Love&quot; is another song of yours that seems very sad. I
looked up the  word &quot;lagan&quot; in the dictionary, and it means &quot;cargo
thrown into the sea attached to a  buoy so that it can be recovered later&quot;.
But you seem to use the word &quot;Lagan&quot; as a  name of someone, perhaps a
deity. In any case, the dictionary meaning seems to go  well with the song,
because it seems in the song that your Lagan love has died. You  sing &quot;Where
Lagan's light fell on the hour/ I saw him far below me/ Just as the  morning
calmed the storm/ With no one there to hold him&quot;. This seems to conjure  up
the image of looking down into a grave at your Lagan love. But perhaps he will 
return again when the sun and the moon meet on yon hill. Could you say more
about  this song? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Burning Bridge&quot;, the other song on your &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
single, seems to me to  be a more desperate retelling of a much ealier song of
yours, &quot;Passing Through Air&quot;.  Could you say something about &quot;Burning
Bridge&quot;? 
</P>
<P>In the song &quot;Jig Of Life&quot;, you seem to hint that you are planning
on having  children. In an interview 6 or 7 years ago, I believe you said that
you weren't  planning on having children, but that if you did it would mean the
end of your  recording career. Have you changed your mind about having children?
And if so,  would you really give up your recording career? 
</P>
<P>Your song &quot;Breathing&quot; seems to be written from the point of view
of a fetus about  to be born into a post-holocaust world. One might think from
this and from your  being a vegetarian, that you would be opposed to abortion.
What are you feelings on  the morality and legality of abortion? 
</P>
<P>(Legality?) 
</P>
<P>(Would it ever be a viable option for you if such a need arose?) 
</P>
<P>Does a feeling of self-imposed responsibility to your fans ever feel
oppressive? I  mean are there things you really want to do, but you don't
because you feel that it is  important to your fans that you be working on your
music? And do you ever find  this pressure unpleasant? 
</P>
<P>When I first heard the title of your new album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, a
long time  before the album was actually released, it seemed to me like a
reference to fans. It  conjured up the image of The Beatles constantly being
hounded by their adoring  fans, who would attack them, because each fan wanted a
little piece of their idols. So  the title &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; seems to
hint at a love/hate relationship with fans. The  Love/Hate relationship is also
symbolized on the picture sleeve to &quot;Running Up The  Hill&quot;, where you
are aiming a bow that could be Cupid's bow, but is also a deadly  weapon. Did
you have these things in mind? 
</P>
<P>I have problems with big record companies, in that I don't like to view Art
as Big  Business. Most large record companies seem much more concerned with
making  money than with encouraging art. But in order for many artists to make
enough  money to record albums the way they want to, it's a necessary thing to
record for a  large record company. And in fact, many of my favorite artists do.
What is your  opinion on the commercialization of art? 
</P>
<P>I think that the &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is as good as any album ever
recorded, but  unfortunately, it wasn't much of a commercial success compared to
your other  albums. Was &quot;The Dreaming&quot; financially successful enough
so that if all your  records were only that successful, you'd still be able to
continue making records the  way you want to? 
</P>
<P>One can't help but notice that the first three songs on your new album,
though  quite excellent indeed, have a distinctly more &quot;commercial pop&quot;
sound to them than  anything on &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. Was this to help make
the album sell better than &quot;The  Dreaming&quot;, or did you feel it
artistically important to make some music that might be  more accessible to more
people, or did it just come sort of come out that way? 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Hello Earth&quot; you sing &quot;Over America can't do anything&quot;,
and in the past it  sure seemed that for the most part North America was
ignoring you. Ironically, the  album on which you sing these very words has
finally proved you wrong. Your  album and single are doing quite well here. Did
you make any conscious attempt to  perhaps aim your music more towards North
American culture? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is sort of the &quot;hit single&quot; from &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot;, while  &quot;Babooshka&quot; was the &quot;hit single&quot; from &quot;Never
For Ever&quot;. Now, it's fairly strange that  as far as I know, these two songs
both use a balalaika, and none of your other songs  do? Is this just
coincidence, or is there something more to it? 
</P>
<P>Another strange coincidence is that Peter Gabriel is also coming out his new
 album this year. Both of you have five albums, and for both, your albums always
 come out in the same years. Do you confer with one another to synchronize your 
albums? 
</P>
<P>Something I've been wondering about is why you spelled &quot;for ever&quot;
as two words  in &quot;Never For Ever&quot; rather than the way it is usually
spelled as one word. What was  intended by this? 
</P>
<P>You've said elsewhere that &quot;Gaffa&quot; in your song &quot;Suspended In
Gaffa&quot; is gaffer's  tape. But I've wondered for a long time, why you have &quot;Gaffa&quot;
capitialized. Is it a  brand-name of gaffer's tape, or is there some other
reason? 
</P>
<P>Another spelling odity is that in the written lyrics for &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
you spelled  &quot;Orgonon&quot; differently than Wilhelm Reich did. Was this
just a typo, or is it an  allusion to something else. A friend tells me that he
believes that there is a book by  one of the big ancient Greek philosophers that
is entitled &quot;Organon&quot;, the way you  have spelled it. 
</P>
<P>Do you believe in the theories of Wilhelm Reich? 
</P>
<P>I find your use of strong symbolism and metaphor and allusions in your
lyrics to  be extremely interesting. For example, in &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;,
the woman who  is singing the song has been left by her lover and feels hurt,
and identifies herself  with a house. This is a biblical allusion. When she says
&quot;I wash the panes&quot;, it is a  tripple entendre, because she's saying
she's washing the windows of her body,  which are the eyes in the Bible. This
means she's crying, and by doing so, she's  washing the hurt and pain away. Then
she says &quot;No stranger's feet will enter me&quot;  saying that she won't let
anyone into her house, which is saying she won't let  anyone into her body,
which is also reinforced by the biblical use of &quot;feet&quot; as a  euphamism
for &quot;private parts&quot;. The layers of meaning here, are incredible. 
</P>
<P>Then a man tries to enter her life again, but she's too scared, and she
tries to  escape by flying away, but he turns into the wind. She then turns into
a mule,  perhaps for its stubborn ability to withstand the wind. And then he
also turns into a  mule. Now it seems that they have a ground for communication.
Because mules are  neuter, and they can communicate on a platonic level rather
than a sexual level. 
</P>
<P>Now a friend of mine believes that this last part is a flaw in the song,
because  mules are not really neuter after all. They are only sterile.
Personally, I think it isn't  a flaw because the idea comes across loud and
clear, and somehow it seems that &quot;I  change into the ameoba. Oooze. Ooze.&quot;
just wouldn't work so well. So the question  is, what do you think of this
interpretation? And could you respond to my friend's  slight criticism? 
</P>
<P>Another song for which the symbolism in the lyrics really fascinates me is &quot;There
 Goes A Tenner&quot;. You've said that it is just a simple song about bank
robbery, but  the more I look at it, the more it seems that nearly every line is
really an allusion to  your recording career at the the time you were recording
&quot;The Dreaming&quot;. You  wouldn't deny that this was intended, would you? 
</P>
<P>In a recent interview you said &quot;I don't really know why people think my
songs  are strange.&quot; I'm not sure that this was said by the same person who
sings &quot;We let  the weirdness in&quot; at the end of the song &quot;Leave It
Open&quot;. In any case, what is really  strange about the singing at the end of
&quot;Leave It Open&quot;, is that if you play it  backwards, it also sounds
like intelligible singing. In fact, it sounds to me like &quot;And  they said
they wouldn't let me in&quot;, which is wonderful because then it has the 
opposite meaning backwards as it does forwards. 
</P>
<P>There is also something like this on &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; in the song &quot;Watching
You  Without Me&quot;. There is one part where you sing what sounds to me like &quot;Really
see&quot;  repeated several times. And if you play this backwards, it sounds
exactly the same. 
</P>
<P>I'd be very interested to know how you did these things? 
</P>
<P>I think there are lots of backwards vocals on your new album. There are 
backwards vocals in &quot;Waking The Witch&quot; and in &quot;Watching You
Without Me&quot;. I  can't make out nearly any of it though, except in &quot;Watching
You Wihout Me&quot;. I  think I can pick out &quot;He was long, he was long, he
was longing&quot;, though I'm not  absolutely sure. Would you be willing to tell
us what some of the backwards vocals  say? 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Waking The Witch&quot;, is it you singing the part of the judge
using a pitch  changer or vocoder? 
</P>
<P>You credited the helicopter in &quot;Waking The Witch&quot; to Pink Floyd's &quot;The
Wall&quot;.  Did you get the helicopter off of the master tapes for &quot;The
Wall&quot; or were you just  thanking them for the good idea? 
</P>
<P>It's really amazing to me how when I listen to your music, it always seems
to  transform itself incredibly over time. For example, for a long time when I
listened to  &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, it seemed like a really joyous happy song.
But now, when I hear it, it  seems more like a jab at some of the British music
press people, who can often be  really vicious and cruel. You sing &quot;They
look down at the ground, missing&quot; as if  saying that their concerns are
really petty and unimportant. You sing &quot;You never  understood me, you never
really tried&quot;. &quot;Waking The Witch&quot; also seems to be partly  about
the British music press. Do you agree with this interpretation? Has the music 
press been getting to you? What are your opinions on them? 
</P>
<P>Did Youth, who's from the groups Killing Joke and Brilliant and who played
bass  on &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, really say the very obnoxious things that the
press have attributed  to him, or did the press just make up these things to
cause a scandal? 
</P>
<P>In England, many people would probably recognise you if just went walking 
around on the street. But here you are not incredibly well known. Have you been 
recognized much while here? 
</P>
<P>(Does it feel better not to have everyone know who you are? Or does it feel 
strange because you're so used that by now?) 
</P>
<P>You've said elsewhere that &quot;Jig of Life&quot; was inspired by a Greek
ceremony. Could  you describe this ceremony and say how it appears in the song?

</P>
<P>(Did you write the poem that is narrated at the end of &quot;Jig Of Life&quot;?)

</P>
<P>The poem which you quote on the sleeve for &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;, &quot;The
Coming of  Arthur&quot; by Tennyson, describes the magical birth of King Arthur.
While at the end  of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; you are spiritually reborn. By
this connection, are you trying to  relate yourself to Arthur in some way? 
</P>
<P>To move a little farther backwards in time to one of your early albums: A
lot of  people I know think that Kashka in your song &quot;Kashka From Bahgdad&quot;
is male, and  thus the song is about homosexuality. I always thought that the
sex of Kashka was  irrelevent, and that it is about some people being more
concerned with what's going  on in others' houses than in trying to make the
most of their own lives. And that  homosexuality in specific doesn't really play
an important role. How did you intend  it? 
</P>
<P>A friend of mine while in Germany heard a version of &quot;Running Up That
Hill&quot;  with you singing in German. But, I'm told this isn't something you
can buy. Did you  just send a tape of this to some radio stations? 
</P>
<P>There are also some German lyrics on your new album in the song &quot;Hello
Earth&quot;.  Have you become interested in German recently? 
</P>
<P>I've seen on video tape TV shows where you performed your wonderful dance 
for the song &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. Once for a German TV show it was in front
of a large  projection of giant iguanas, and that was really great. Another
time, for an Italian  TV show, you performed it on a show with this incredibly
tacky disco stage with  rotating and flashing lights. Your dancing was just
amazing, but the contrast between  your art and the tackiness of the setting was
really amusing. Does it bother you to  peform under a situation like this? 
</P>
<P>How'd you go about getting Donald Sutherland to be in your video for  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;?
And how was it working with him? 
</P>
<P>You've said that you plan to make a film of the &quot;Ninth Wave&quot;.
Would this be a  full length feature film, or would it be for a half-hour TV
slot? 
</P>
<P>Rumor says that you want Terry Gilliam (who directed &quot;Time Bandits&quot;)
to direct  your film. Is there any truth to this? 
</P>
<P>Speaking of rumors, rumor says that the original name for &quot;Running Up
That  Hill&quot; was &quot;A Deal With God&quot;, but the record company
pressured you to change the  original name. Is this true, and if so how did you
feel about this? 
</P>
<P>Do you ever plan on finishing your autobiography &quot;Leaving My Tracks&quot;?

</P>
<P>Of your albums, which one is your favorite? 
</P>
<P>You said elsewhere that on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; one of your favorite
songs is &quot;Night of  the Swallow&quot;. What are your favorite songs on &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot;? 
</P>
<P>What's your favorite song of all the songs you've recorded? 
</P>
<P>Paul Kerton in his biography of you, published some of your lovely early
poetry  that you wrote while in school. Were you happy to have this poetry
published, or  would rather have had it left undisturbed? 
</P>
<P>Fred Vermorel wrote a couple of very questionable biographies on you. The
first  one was sort of a parody on scandal sheets done at your and your family's
expense.  In his second biography, while it is also of a very questionable
nature, it seems that  &quot;The Dreaming&quot; changed his mind about you, and
he has many good things to say  about you and &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. What did
you think of this whole incident? 
</P>
<P>You've said elsewhere that the songs on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; aren't part
of a theme.  But it seems to me that every song on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is
part of a collage on the  never-ending struggle of man to find the key to the
chains that spiritually imprison  him. And every song uses locks or prisons or
keys as a strong image. This is even  depicted on the cover of the album, where
a lock, a key, and chains are very  prominent images? Did you conciously plan
this as a unifying theme? 
</P>
<P>While in New York, have you had the wonderful experience of riding around in
 the New York subways? 
</P>
<P>Have you done or seen anything else particulalry interesting? 
</P>
<P>Before we end the interview, I'd like to ask you two more quick questions. 
</P>
<P>First, what do you feed your cats? 
</P>
<P>Finally, could you do a radio spot for me. Like saying something like &quot;Hi,
I'm  Kate Bush and you are listening to WMBR, Cambridge, a community service of 
M.I.T.&quot;
