<P>Date: Mon, 20 Nov 89 00:14:03 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Musician Dec. 1989, MM Oct. 1989 excerpts 
</P>
<P>First of all, there's a very favorable review of the album in the December
issue  of Musician magazine. Since this magazine is fairly widely available in
the US, I will  only quote a few lines from it: 
</P>
<P>&quot;All it takes is a single listening of The Sensual World to understand
why it's  been four years since Kate Bush released an album; a song cycle as
rich and deep as  this takes a while to mature.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, suffice to say that nearly every line of this review says something
good  about the album. If anyone needs to see the entire review, please e-mail
me. 
</P>
<P>Kate's mentioned a couple of other times in this issue as well. There's an
article  about the Innocence Mission, in which the writer says, &quot;Kate Bush
on Valium might  sound like this.. .&quot;
