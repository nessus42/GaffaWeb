</P>
<P>KT in Munich, Germany 
</P>
<P>TD ??? 
</P>
<P>[transcribed by Ray Russell] 
</P>
<P>K: It's a pleasure to be here 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, thank you. It's not the first time we meet? 
</P>
<P>K: No, not at all. 
</P>
<P>I: I was looking very forward to the second time 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah me too. 
</P>
<P>I: Well you haven't changed, that's my first question because uh you became
a big  star. You have started when we met the first time, but now you are one.
Would  you say you've changed? 
</P>
<P>K: Uh, Yes, I think I have. Yeah, um I've learnt a lot so obviously that
would change  me. But it's good, I'm really glad that I've learnt a lot and
there's so much more  to learn. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate Bush normally I ask questions you know people may interest but
that's a  question that interests myself. Kate I see on stage that uh makes you
a little bit  special. You are sometimes a little unreal on stage uh it's a
you're dancing,  you're full of expression, but have you here it's a very
normal, nice and friendly  girl. What's the true Kate Bush, the very you know
sophisticated on stage which  is dancing and actin', or the girl sittin' here
smoking, laughing, whatever? 
</P>
<P>K: I think We're all her. There's many of me, and uh I'm me at the moment. 
</P>
<P>I: Mmmm And you're you at the moment here, and you are on the moment on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>K: Uh yes. When I'm on the stage I'm there, and when I'm me I'm here. Yeah 
</P>
<P>[Breathing is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Out in out in, Kate Bush and today she's in. Kate Bush live in....Kate,
you have a  lot to do now you came from Holland you did some dates here, some
dates there,  and of course the press is very interesting and I'm sure that a
lot of people think  about you, they try to ask you some very specific things
what do you think about  the questions from journalists. Because you know just
Kate Bush will be asked  some very special things, not where you were born,
where you first got your first  Gibson guitar... 
</P>
<P>K: Mmm, Well interestingly enough, I was saying to a journalist today that
uh all the  interviews I've done today in Munich were incredible the questions
were very  clever, very precise, they'd done all their research, they knew a
lot, and uh I  really enjoyed talking to them. The standard was incredible and
compared to the  English press, on average it was just superb, wonderful. 
</P>
<P>I: They care more about music and those things then about the person? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. And,that's what I'd like to talk about I love to talk about my music
because  that's what I love. It gets very boring for me to sit and talk about
myself all the  time you don't normally do that? 
</P>
<P>I: And they asked you whether you liked blond, tall boys and so on, and so
rubbish.  Do you like them? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! 
</P>
<P>[Army Dreamers is played] 
</P>
<P>I: [In German: Army Dreamers, Kate Bush the number 1 singer in England?]
Kate  Bush,are you surprised about your success in England because a lot of
artists are  very successful in Germany wherever Europe, but not in England. You
are  successful in England and in the rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>K: It makes me very happy. And I think especially because it's my home land.
That  really means a lot to me because I live in England. And to see that being 
reflected amongst my friends and where I live, it's really special. 
</P>
<P>I: Well Kate Bush all the record companies are very sad and all the artists
they look  for her sales because it's not so good for the moment the people are
not buying  so much records as they did before uh but does they doesn't care at
in this time.  What means you, I mean you sell records I think, every record is
selling more  than the other one. 
</P>
<P>K: I think the interesting thing is that although the sales are down,
there's an  incredible amount of really good new material. I mean just, I can't
remember the  last time there were so many top acts having their albums out, and
the quality  being so high,I mean in England it's just been going number one one
week out  number one one week-out, it's incredible. 
</P>
<P>I: Well Kate, uh you did dancing on stage, you're a singer, you have a lot
of  movements in your, in your shows. Is there still room for new ideas? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, I think so. I think they're always - there's always room for them, as
long as  you can keep open and let them in I mean there's just inspiration
everywhere,  everywhere you look. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate, that's it. I have to thank you very very much. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you 
</P>
<P>I: And, it was a second time now - maybe there will be a third time? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, I hope so - third time's lucky so it'll be good one. You will. 
</P>
<P>I: I hope so- third times lucky, eh?. Uh we'll have a chance to see you in
Munich in  the near future, on stage of course? 
</P>
<P>K: On stage. No there are no plans for a tour.um, It's such a big decision. 
</P>
<P>[tape cuts] 
</P>
<P>I: ..more than just stand on stage and singing, huh? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, and it's really the size of this that frightens me - but I really
want to tour  again, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: If you ask us, we wait for you so make your decision. We've got to say
welcome. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: I hope it's going to be soon. Is there a chance to see you not on tour,
but uh  maybe just for shopping in Munich or for eating, mmm? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I hope so, yes. I'll come back to see it. 
</P>
<P>I: You like Munich? 
</P>
<P>K: I love it very, very much 
</P>
<P>I: We say thank you now, good bye Uh you should see me in the other
interviews  I'm I don't know myself today you know. I'm so sorry I don't know
why... 
</P>
<P>K:[laughs]

 German right after saying it.
