<H3>Recording Kate Bush and The Red Shoes. </H3>
<P>by Michael Molenda 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's music is so theatrical that you don't hear it so much as &quot;see&quot;
it. Her  productions are almost mystical in their ability to reach beyond the
aural proscenium  and pull the listener into an emotional tableau. So it's
fitting that her current album  The Red Shoes pays homage to another chillingly
evocative talent, the late British  filmmaker Michael Powell. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes, named after Powell's classic 1948 film about a doomed
ballerina,  was recorded and mixed by Bush's longtime engineer Del Palmer in her
&quot;home&quot;  studio: a state-of-the-art facility housed in two adjacent
barns on her parent's farm  in Kent County, near London. 
</P>
<P>The studio is equipped with an SSL 4048E console (with a G-series computer),
a  Fairlight, and AMS, Eventide, and (luantec signal processors. Six months
after the  project began, Bush purchased two Sony 3324A 24-track digital
recorders from  Abbey Road studios, making The Red Shoes her first 48-track
digital production. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We used to be dyed-in-the-wool analog lovers,&quot; admits Palmer. &quot;But
after day  one of going digital, we were totally convinced that it was the best
thing since sliced  bread. Everything sounded so great direct from the
microphones, that I barely  touched the EQ during recording. And the absence of
tape hiss is a boon for Kate's  music, where arrangements sometimes break down
to literally nothing.&quot; The Red  Shoes took three years to complete and
includes guest artists such as Eric Clapton,  Prince, Jeff Beck, and the Trio
Bulgarka. Bush developed keyboard and vocal ideas  over simple, 4-bar drum loops
programmed by Palmer on the Fairlight. When a song  was adequately fleshed out,
drummer Stuart Elliott was called in to replace the  Fairlight loop. 
</P>
<P>&quot;All the drum sounds on the record are Akai SIOOO samples played by
Stuart on  Simmons pads,&quot; says Palmer. &quot;The only live sounds are the
cymbals. If you solo the  overhead tracks you can hear the clack-clack of the
drumsticks hitting the pads. We  used samples because our studio is relatively
small, and if we miked acoustic drums  we'd always get the same room sound,
which is not very exciting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush's lush vocal orchestrations were recorded on a Neumann U87, usually by 
herself. &quot;She didn't want to bore me while she worked things out,&quot;
explains Palmer.  &quot;So I'd set up a vocal sound, hand her the remote
[control for the multitrack], and  leave. 
</P>
<P>When she felt she had enough good performances on tape, we'd select the best
 complete performance [for each song], and fix little things by punching in
lines from  other tracks.&quot; According to Palmer, the album practically mixed
itself. The sounds  on tape were good, so he just added reverb and made sure
each instrument had  enough space. As a result, The Red Shoes is one of Bush's
most organic productions. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate really doesn't like to use samples or sequences,&quot; reveals
Palmer.  &quot;Everything on the record, except a few drum loops is played
real-time. We  definitely wanted a band feel, so we didn't get obsessed with
technology. I just  twisted knobs until things sounded good.&quot;
