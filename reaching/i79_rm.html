<P>John Shearlaw's interview and tour preview, March 1979 
</P>
<P>  Wow Amazing
</P>
<P>  says Kate Bush; John Shearlaw agrees with her 
</P>
<P> Who said a word from the band was worth two from Kate Bush? 
</P>
<P>Because, just this once, it isn't true. But how else is one to penetrate the
cloak of  security? To delve into the mystery that surrounds Kate's upcoming
(and now  totally sold out) British Tour? To find out--or at least get an
idea--of just how  &quot;amazing&quot; (to use one of the lady's own favourite
words) her first real &quot;grand  entrance&quot; in front of the great British
public is going to be? 
</P>
<P>That it will be a grand entrance is now virtually beyond question. For Kate,
still  only twenty years old, has found that what was at first a tentative (and
very well  planned) debut outing has swollen into a full-scale tour--now
including five nights at  the London Palladium, with Europe to follow. 
</P>
<P>While I've found (let's say a birdie told me!) that this spectacular
initiation is  likely to offer such treats as: 
</P>
<P>Two supporting dancers appearing with Kate (herself an accomplished dancer 
and mime artist); 
</P>
<P>What has loosely described as a &quot;magician&quot; (although, typically,
the nature of the  act is being kept a secret!). 
</P>
<P>A specially designed stage with opening mirrored ramps for Kate and the 
seven-piece band to disappear in and out of. 
</P>
<P>A variety of equipment--including a black carpet that will cover the entire
stage  area. 
</P>
<P>Mind-boggling set-pieces--one of which seems likely to be Kate suspended
inside  a giant, transparent egg (with only two handholds and two footholds)
which will  rotate as she sings. 
</P>
<P>As well as a completely new approach to the singer as the center of 
attention--perhaps one of the most interesting innovations! As well as using
radio  microphones (without leads), she'll also be wearing a wire head-piece
(with a mike)  for certain songs--thus making it easier to move, dance and
sing...with no  limitations. 
</P>
<P>Nor is all this dedication to presentation a mere attempt at technoflash. In
fact,  the whole production (which will travel with the tour and be adapted for
each  venue--with the full works being reserved for the largest stage: the
London  Palladium) isn't reckoned to be that expensive. (A figure of around
150,000 Pounds  has been mentioned--almost peanuts in relation to full-scale
ELO-like production  packages). 
</P>
<P>Rather, if it works--and with all the effort that's gone into it, it looks
like it  will--it will be some way towards Kate's original stated ambition of &quot;combining
 songs and dance in a slightly different way--a way that suits me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now you know, although you shouldn't! Prepare for something a little bit 
special--that's if Wuthering Heights didn't, or the incredible BBC TV video she 
recorded in Switzerland last month for Wow doesn't either. 
</P>
<P>Ms. Bush, whichever way you look at it, is about to break out in a big way.
And  not just out of an egg! 
</P>
<P>Yes, she has played live before--&quot;in pubs and clubs, from when I was
about  fourteen,&quot; she remembers. &quot;I was always happy to perform.&quot;
And who can forget  that it was Kate, as a squeaky and precocious
sixteen-year-old, who first gained  record company interest (and to certain
people, also from record companies, who  must now be kicking themselves with
some force, abject scorn) by accompanying  herself on piano at her
doctor-father's house? 
</P>
<P>But, since the success of Wuthering Heights and her subsequent breakthrough
as  one of the most truly original voices of the decade (perfectly executed and
illustrated  on two albums) last year, there hasn't been what product-managers
would call  back-up. No live appearances; just videos in Japan and playbacks for
Top of the Pops. 
</P>
<P>The reason being, yes...&quot;a genuine lack of time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I survived all the digs I had last year,&quot; she says now. &quot;I
really wasn't  deliberately keeping myself away from an audience to build up a
reputation. It has  simply taken all this time to stage things the way I want
to. And to match up to the  standard I've set myself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Which I haven't reached, and probably won't reach!&quot; she laughs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But however it turns out, it's my concept--my concept, as much as the
time, the  budget and the presentation will allow. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And it's for all the Lionhearts first!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's also a concept, says Kate, that is the culmination of two years'
planning,  and--more realistically--six solid months of rehearsal, which began
with the band  long before Christmas, extended into lighting and effects work at
a Home Counties  film studio, and will culminate, for the rest of this month,
with full run-throughs at  a major London theatre. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It does, however, make it somewhat understandable that the lady
herself is  reluctant to disclose any details of the surprises in store. Since
Christmas she's lived  with the hard-core reality of putting the show on--a
development that has attracted  so much rumour and speculation that someone less
determined (and less in total  control of her own projectction) might be tempted
to begin her own publicity before  the event. Not so. 
</P>
<P>To Kate, the shows--her live arrival--is firstly: &quot;A present. A present
that  shouldn't be unwrapped until everyone is there!&quot; And secondly, she
also maintains:  &quot;It's like hearing about a film. Everybody tells you it's
amazing--and you could end  up disappointed. You shouldn't get people's
expectations up like that.&quot; She smiles,  half-childishly,
half-apologetically. 
</P>
<P>&lt;Shearlaw is apparently unaware that he--and he alone among all
journalists prior  to the tour's opening--has just done exactly what Kate would
have appreciated he  not do.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I know you want to know. But how can I start? If I tell you one thing,
it'll give  everything away. It'll bugger everything up!&quot; 
</P>
<P>She smiles again, probably at the word this time. Underneath it, though,
there's  an iron resolve. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If you look at it, it's my reputation,&quot; she says. &quot;And yes,
I hope it'll be  something special, that's the way I'm working on it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It can't be original...It couldn't be, ever. Nothing could, because to
an extent,  it's all been done before. Just say they're my songs...and,
hopefully, presented in a  way that suits each song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So, we have the tour, and the ever-expanding talents of one Kate
Bush--strangely,  somebody who is often criticised for her originality. Almost
on the lines that: &quot;If  she's that original (especially that voice), it
must be a gimmick. She'd better  broaden out soon, before people get fed up with
it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And for the last six months she's been living a double life. On the one had
Kate  Bush, the lady in public demand: an award winner in so many polls early
this year  that even she's probably lost count of the number of times she's said
&quot;amazing&quot; with  reference to said distinctions. 
</P>
<P>On the other, a fiercely determined artist, working full-time on her big
arrival.  Her concept. And what could well be the full public flowering of one
of our  brightest new talents. 
</P>
<P>Great, fantastic and incredible. How else would she put it? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm really looking forward to it so much,&quot; she says. &quot;I look
at myself, and I'm  not a public person. At least I don't see myself as a public
person; I don't go out and  go to parties. My friends&quot; --her boyfriends &quot;are
&quot;just good friends&quot;, she points  out--&quot;don't make front-page
news! All that amazing show-business thing, you  know. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; she continues, &quot;you do have different faces. My
different face is when I  perform--it will be when I perform, I mean! 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm on stage, I get possessed, really.&quot; Her eyes--still 
bigger-than-believable, away from the flash-guns--sparkle. &quot;Away from it,
I'm just  normal and small...then, suddenly, I've got this really special thing.
I'm really  letting go. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's an amazing feeling, a great big rush.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She pauses and delivers a sentence that could have a malicious tease about
it.  Equally, it could be genuine. &quot;It's almost like seeing God, man!
Though it's not quite  as simple as that... 
</P>
<P>&quot;You're communicating, without talking, something that's inside
you--your  creation--and it's going out to people. It's fantastic when you see
them accepting it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And does she feel they do, or sorry, that they will? Or does she worry about
 projecting a conscious image to gain that acceptance? 
</P>
<P>In a word, no. &quot;It's not a question of being sexy or anything. It's
much more to  do with the interpretation of each song. Each one you see
differently and present  differently,&quot; she says. &quot;I've been very open
to lots of influences up until now, or I  wouldn't even be doing the things I am
doing. Like if I hadn't worked with Lindsay  Kemp, I wouldn't be moving around
at all while I was singing! Can you imagine  that? 
</P>
<P>&quot;So I've arrived at a stage when I'm ready to present myself as myself.
Being  sexy, or whatever, isn't deliberate at all. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Anyway,&quot; she adds, defusing the topic, &quot;it's not really
right, is it? I mean, I don't  look like a symbol first thing in the morning, do
I?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ahem. On we go. She tells me that there are problems with the show, which is
 why the rehearsals have been so intense. It's a new band (which does include
her  brother Paddy, while another brother, John, is in charge of the show on the
 road--&quot;they're an amazing family,&quot; says Kate); and, more
particularly, she has had to  adapt to the difficulties of presenting her
voice--in all its uniqueness--while  simultaneously interpreting the song
through dance. 
</P>
<P>Kate's been almost religious in the last few months about this aspect of her
 training. She's been having lessons (with teacher Anthony Van Laast) for two
hours  each day, as well as other dancing routines, and she maintains: &quot;It's
the discipline  that's all-important, and I can feel really bad if I have to
miss it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's just so important for my state of brain--I feel completely
different, and so  much better--afterwards. And it's something that I feel I can
carry on developing.  With dance and movement, you're learning and creating all
the time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>While she's still--very much--keeping control of her career destiny, as well
 as--for the most part--her secrets, the only thing she's worried about is time.
Time  to get it right. She says: &quot;I look back sometimes and realise how
much time I did  have to be receptive and open and take in so many things. To
some exten I still  am--and I'm still terribly subjective. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not that it's really changed, but I find that there are definite
restrictions on  my time, and there are definite things that I want to control.

</P>
<P>&quot;It'll be an objective look at me, going out on tour. It's really my
reputation and  my career, and everything I've been working for. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not closing off, and I still need help, but it's up to me to see
that I can reach  the standards I've set myself. &quot;But just to get that
audience contact, for the first  time, will be fantastic!&quot; 
</P>
<P>What else, indeed? The unveiling begins next month and--secrets or no 
secrets--it will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>What was that about &quot; Wow is the word&quot;?
