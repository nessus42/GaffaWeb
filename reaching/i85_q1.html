<P>From: ***SEMPSY*** &lt;sre017@cck.cov.ac.uk&gt; <BR> Date: Fri, 3 May 91
16:47:34 -0100 <BR> Subject: &quot;Q&quot; - HoL sleeve notes, June 1991
</P>
<P>Here is the transcript of the Q magazine sleeve note for 'Hounds Of Love'. 
</P>
<P>This comes free with the June edition (number 57): 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Dreaming was my 'She's gone mad' album, my 'She's not commercial
any  more' album, &quot; says Kate Bush, amused in retrospect, thinking about
her  predicament when after a three-year silence, she released Hounds Of Love.
Its  predecessor had been the first serious setback in a chart career that began
when  her debut single, Wuthering Heights, hit number 1 for a month in 1978.
When the  spell broke -The Dreaming single an apologetic 48, the album a sorry
silver after the  parade of platinum-previously paternal executives were moved
to make indelicate  enquiries about what, for instance, Rolf Harris (on
didgeridoo) and Percy Edwards  (animal noises) were doing on a record intended
for the mainstream youth market It  was hard to take. The Dreaming was the first
album Kate had produced herself &quot;I  wanted to take control of everything
and go for it, &quot; she recalls. But the charts and  the business said she'd
failed. So she retreated into normality. For six months she  saw friends, went
to the pictures and dance classes, and learned to drive (she bought  a modest VW
Polo). 
</P>
<P>Then, in June, 1983, work began on a 48-track studio in an old barn located 
handily for her parent's home in the kentish suburbs of London and for the house
 she shared with Del Palmer, her boyfriend since the pub rock days of the K. T
Bush  band. It wasn't quite state-of-the-art because she couldn't afford it. But
if one chart  misfire could provoke EMI to turn the recording budget on her like
heavy artillery,  she had to move out of range. &quot;The way I work is very
experimental, &quot; she says,  &quot;and, when you know the studio is costing a
phenomenal amount of money every  hour, it just zaps creativity. &quot; 
</P>
<P>It was a matter of power and arithmetic. Abbey Road then cost 90 an hour, 
Kate's place nothing. She'd taken her music-making out of the music industry and
 back to the fond embrace of the family where it began. after some preliminary 
doodling at Abbey Road, as soon as her own studio was ready she began work on 
Hounds Of Love in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>In the windowless room she'd designed, communicating with Del at the desk 
through mike and headphones, she settled into a looser variant of the
rhythm-based  writing method she'd developed on The Dreaming (inspired by
sessions on Peter  Gabriel's Games Without Frontiers) and continued with what
she calls the &quot;very  male&quot; production style she wanted then-weight and
strength to justify herself in the  Man's world of the studio. 
</P>
<P>But progress was slower than ever. &quot;In music, &quot; she's said, &quot;you
have to break  your back before you even start to speak emotion. &quot;On lead
vocals, where most  singers strive for one good &quot;take&quot;, she routinely
assembled six to choose from. She  would often create arrangements on the
fairlight and then replace the synthesized  lines with natural instruments:
hence the &quot;real&quot; strings on Hounds Of Love and  Cloudbusting and a kit
snare drum on Running Up That Hill although the rest of the  rhythm track comes
from Del Palmer's programming. Even the muted sound of  waves between and Dream
Of Sheep and Under Ice had to be re-recorded because  the effects discs
available didn't provide &quot;the right kind of sea&quot;. 
</P>
<P>And the words came even harder, she says. As usual, many of her starting
points  were in books and films-Cloudbusting from Peter Reich's book about his
inventor  father Wilhelm, Hounds Of Love from a 1957 horror movie Night Of The
Demon,  and the whole of The Ninth Wave from both memories of war films like The
Cruel  Sea and keeping company for years with a macabre painting called The
Hogsmill  Ophelia (it shows a doll drowning in sewage; &quot;It cost me all the
money I had once, &quot;  she says). 
</P>
<P>For more than a year, Bush sightings were rarer than ospreys, and when she
did  emerge it was to find the chubby cheeks and double chin she acquired during
studio  immersion (through lack of exercise and too much chocolate) translated
by the  tabloids into&quot;Kate blows up to 18 stone&quot; rumours. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Between albums I always get fat in the papers, &quot; she says. &quot;It's
quite funny, me  as this balloon. And then by the time I start doing interviews
I've lost all that weight  again, it seems. It must go into the music. &quot; 
</P>
<P>Hounds Of Love was completed in June, 1985, which meant the resumption of 
negotiation with the outside world. She won an argument with EMI about which 
track should be the first single-they wanted Cloudbusting-then lost one about
its  title. &quot;For me, Running Up That Hill really is Deal With God, but I
was told that  radio stations in Spain, Italy, America and so on would refuse to
play it with God in  the title. Ridiculous. Still, especially after The
Dreaming, I decided I couldn't be  bloody minded. &quot; 
</P>
<P>In August, Running Up That Hill went to number 3, her first British Top 10
hit  since Babooshka, five years earlier. For the album launch at the London
Planetarium  on September 5, she and Del decided to &quot;come out&quot; by
appearing in Public together  for the first time. Subsequent tabloid &quot;wickedness&quot;,
as Kate ingenously calls it, in  fabricating a row between Del and Youth, who'd
played bass on The Big Sky, hardly  mattered when the album was ecstatically
reviewed-even the dauntingly  unfashionable &quot;concept&quot; aspect of The
Ninth Wave-and went straight to number 1  where it stayed for a month. 
</P>
<P>Though &quot;career&quot; is not a notion Kate Bush readily relates to, hers
had  undoubtedly turned around. Hounds Of Love and Cloudbusting (with the
stunning  Donald Sutherland video) were also substantial single hits and the
album reached  Number 30 in America, still her highest placing there. 
</P>
<P>Even so, she expressed herself surprised by some reactions to her work,  &quot;controversial&quot;
interpretations which, she always said, never occurred to her when  she was
writing the songs. For instance, some were keen to see drugs references in 
Under Ice where she sings of &quot;speeding&quot; and &quot;cutting little lines&quot;.
Kate insisted the  image was simply about skating. 
</P>
<P>Then there were the hounds on the cover, draped about a smoochy-eyed Kate 
with suggestive languor. No, no, it was just a matter of getting them to lay
calm and  still for the shot, she said. &quot;It worries me if there is any kind
of sexual connotation.  My God! Should I be careful? The thing is I can't see
myself sexually I just see me  being silly. &quot; 
</P>
<P>Naive or not, she preserved her mystery. Hounds Of Love is essence of Kate 
Bush, the unbridled expression of someone who had achieved the creative privacy 
she needed-incommunicado without forgetting how to communicate. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've made some of my best decisions in the last two years, &quot; she
said that  autumn, thinking of the studio in particular. &quot;I have to go back
to the work because  that's what matters. Work obsesses my life and everyone
around me is dragged into  it. It's terrible, really. &quot; 
</P>
<P>Only, somehow, it's not.
