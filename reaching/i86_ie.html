<P>The Island-Ear Interview. 
</P>
<P>A New York music paper 
</P>
<P>January 7 - February 3, 1986 Issue 
</P>
<P>by Beth Fishkind 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to Ed Suranyi for providing me with the
issue.  Bracketed comments are mine, unless followed by &quot;IE&quot;, then
they are in the original  article.] 
</P>
<P>Is Kate Bush news to you? 
</P>
<P>Despite well-known status since the late 70's in her English homeland, Kate
Bush  has had only a cult following - albeit a devoted one - in America. But
this fall, when  the single &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot;
paced its way on to the U.S.  charts and with her sixth [fifth] album, Hounds of
Love hunting out lots of  American Homes, her relative obscurity in these former
colonies seems to be on the  decline. 
</P>
<P>In England, success came early. So the story unfolds... At 16, she was &quot;discovered&quot;
 by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. She spent the next few years honing her 
talents, which culminated in her debut single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
hitting the top of  the U.K. charts in 1978. (The song was later covered by Pat
Benatar on her Crimes of  Passion album.) 
</P>
<P>For singer, songwriter, keyboardist and producer Kate Bush, Hounds of Love 
appears to be serving two purposes: One, attracting new fans, and Two, for all
her  devotees, a welcome return from a few years silence. 
</P>
<P>I: Your music contains a lot of very strong emotions. For example, the hit &quot;Running
 Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot; is intense in that manner. Can you explain
the  emotions behind this song. 
</P>
<P>K: It's very much about two people who are in love, a man and a woman, and
the  idea of it is they could swap places... The man being the woman and vice
versa  and they'd understand each other better. In some ways talking about the 
fundamental differences between men and women, I suppose trying to remove  those
obstacles, being in someone else's place; understanding how they see it,  and;
hoping that would remove problems in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>I think emotion is really what music's all about. It's trying to emote to
the listener,  in some way that is effective, either to make them happy or sad.
To me as a  listener to other people's music, that's what it does for me though.
There are  pieces of music that just make me go &quot;Ohh...,&quot; they're just
so good. They make  you feel great or they make you feel very sad and nostalgic,
and i think everyone  has some kind of music that really makes them feel good.
Does something for  them. So I think that's the purpose, to emote the listener.
So it's got to be about  emotion, really, and expression. 
</P>
<P>I: Your music and lyrics do show you as a very emotional person. Like you're
always  thinking... there's always something churning inside of you. I would
describe you  as a serious person on that account. Is this correct? 
</P>
<P>K: I think I'm quite analytical and I think that's definitely what comes out
in a lot  of the songs. It's the analyzing of emotional situations. I think I&quot;m
an emotional  person - I think that's what motivates me. Definitely from some
writing point of  view, even in political situations when people say, &quot;You've
written this. This is  quite political.&quot; But for me, it's the emotional
content of the political situation that  effects me. I think that most people
that are sort of intrigued by writing or  creating on some level are sensitive
to the emotional side of things. That's in a  way perhaps what makes them
write... A kind of insecurity. 
</P>
<P>I: Listening to the background vocals on Hounds of Love, they sound
agonized,  plaintive, and sometimes they're screams. The whole second side of
the album,  which you call &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; reminds me of waking at
night in a cold sweat,  you know, always thinking, &quot;What is the meaning of
life?&quot; Seems like you tend to  ponder on that. 
</P>
<P>K: I think that side is about that and that's great if you feel that. It's
not what I  experience myself, thank God, but it is very much about someone
trying to make  it through the night in the water - alone, scared, and not
really knowing what's  happening, but going through the experience and hopefully
coming out the other  side with an appreciation of what's really going on. So
it's quite good if you get  that image. 
</P>
<P>I: What songs on this album, or parts of songs, were inspirational flashes.
You know,  a lightning bolt hit you. What took work? 
</P>
<P>K: It's very much like that. You get a big burst and then it will all slow
down and it  gets very slow. And then you get... Uh, let me think... Well, &quot;Watching
You  Without Me&quot; was very quick. That was all done in two days, I'd say,
the whole  thing except for the orchestra that we put on during an extra
session. But all the  songs were put straight to master. I was actually writing
in the studio, so there  was no demo in the process. It was all being written
straight onto master tape. So  if that initial thing was good enough, it would
be taken from there. It was  incredibly quick. Some songs were written on the
piano, so again they were quite  quick, instead of me having to round up [a line
was repeated here so their  appears to be missing line here] the slow processes
were technical. Technical  things that slowed you down, or just trying to make
ideas work that you thought  could but didn't happen as quickly as you hoped,
and you just had to be patient. 
</P>
<P>I: Your songwriting is self-taught. I've read where you went to the library
to find  books that would try to teach you how to put word to music. How did you
finally  learn, just by doing? Trial and error? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think from the word &quot;go&quot; it's been just a gradual
process of teaching  myself what worked and what didn't. It's just through
practice, really. Any time  you're writing a song, you're learning about some
aspect of songwriting. 
</P>
<P>I: Regarding the types of sounds you get, how did you get that little part
on &quot;Running  Up That Hill&quot; that comes in first at the start of the
song, after the drums and  before the vocals? 
</P>
<P>K: That's the Fairlight and that was actually what I wrote the song with.
That was  what the song was written around. 
</P>
<P>I: And what about the altered voice at the end of the song, where you're
singing, &quot;If  only I could, keep [she actually says &quot;be&quot;] Running
Up That Hill&quot;? How was that  done? 
</P>
<P>K: That's just a heavy effect. 
</P>
<P>I: What effect is on there? Do you remember? 
</P>
<P>K: I guess I'll put &quot;I won't say.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I: You won't say? 
</P>
<P>K: No. It was just a combination of the engineer and myself. I think it's
part of the  thing of recording and there are so many limitations to what we do,
to discover  something interesting that perhaps people aren't really using...
It's so quickly  that people imitate things. You've got to hand onto them, I
suppose. If you want  to use them again. 
</P>
<P>I: Can you explain to me, as non-technical as possible, what the Fairlight
is and how  you use it? 
</P>
<P>K: For me, what is so good about it, is it's a machine you can sample any
sound you  want into it. Say, you can sample a car horn or a violin, and then
just play it on  the keyboard. It's useful not only for when you're writing a
song, but also for  any arrangements. For instance, if I want a brass
arrangement in a song, I can  play around on the Fairlight and get an idea of
what I want by actually using a  sound like brass. 
</P>
<P>I: I can see how it helps a composer, particularly you, you've got a studio
in your  home and you just go right in... but what do you think this technology
will do to  the recording industry and the making of albums in general? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's a good thing and I think it's going to develop very much in
the next  couple of years. I think everything really is advancing to get
superior sounding  things so that there's as little noise as possible. I think
it's probably going to have  quite an effect. But I think synthesizer did. When
synthesizer were introduced,  music was so inspired by it, that the synthesizers
were over everything. IT was  quite a stampede, because yo have the medium, and
I think probably the same  thing will happen with the Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>I: Technology is certainly bringing good sounds and sophisticated features
to  keyboards in an affordable range. Do you see this as a whole big revolution?
I  mean, it's started now, but... 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. I think technically right across the board, not just in music, we're
going into  another stage. There's no doubt that things are just gonna go... You
know, you  think even in the last ten years things have really developed, that I
think we're  actually just on the front of a whole new world of technology. 
</P>
<P>I: Kind of scary. 
</P>
<P>K: I think all change is scary. And I think change can be very positive. 
</P>
<P>I: But it's still that unknown quantity, whether it's good or bad. 
</P>
<P>K: That's right, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: The reason for this inquiry is that I think your comments are
particularly relevant,  because you've been using this technology, the
Fairlight, for years now. You were  at the tip of the iceberg. I mean, I think
you're one of the first people I knew  who used it. 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's one of those instruments too that you'd learn to use
hopefully in a  separate way. There are some sounds on the Fairlight that are
used so much now  that most producers would steer away from it. Particularly
people in the business  know straight away - there's a kind of corny edge to it.

</P>
<P>I: I was going to make a generalization about radio today and its effect on &quot;routine&quot;
 sounds... but it's hard to that because radio here is so much different from
what  radio is over there. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes! I know so little about &quot;the market&quot; here. You know, I just
hear things from  people. 
</P>
<P>I: That's good, ignorance is bliss. What I mean is, sometimes it's
frustrating because  everything is extremely formularized. 
</P>
<P>K: I understand you actually segment different kinds of music onto stations.
You have  soul stations and heavy rock stations... [In England, there is usually
one station  played a variety of contemporary music - IE]. 
</P>
<P>I: Exactly. Why do you think you broke in the United States now? Do you
think it  has anything to do with the difference in radio styles? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know. I don't understand this market at all, you see. It's like
you say  thought, it's the question that in some ways you can't ask anyone,
except the  public. I presume they like and I think the consistency of rhythm
makes it more  accessible to people. Seems you've got a consistency of rhythm,
people can dance.  Dance is something people can relate to immediately, so I
think that helps  tremendously. But I can't help but feel it's because,
hopefully people like it and,  it's the first time there's been sufficient
interest with real back-up from the  record company promotionally. And that's
all I can put it down to. 
</P>
<P>I: Right time, right place. 
</P>
<P>K: Right timing, yes. Right support. 
</P>
<P>I: You know, that's usually the way it happens, no matter what you do. 
</P>
<P>K: Absolutely.
