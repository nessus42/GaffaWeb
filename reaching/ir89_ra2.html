Subject: Rapido on BBC2 14th October 1989 (short mentioning) 
</p>



<p>On Saturday 14th October, the music programme Rapido on BBC2 (That's British 
TV for you US Love-Hounds) began with an interview with Kate plus a couple of 
short video clips ( RUTH and TSW ). Over footage of Kate at home on the farm, 
making tea, and slaving over a hot mixing desk with Dave Gilmour, we had the usual 
references to her career, etc. 
</p>

<p>However, with Kate speaking on camera, she revealed her amazement at the way 
her fans stuck with her for years at a time, just waiting for that new album ... She 
giggled and said she thought &quot;[we were] all just crazy&quot;. The way she said this was SO 
cute, in that London accent of hers ... 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was very little about the album itself, other than that it is 
due out in the UK on Tuesday 17th October (Hope I got that right - couldn't video 
it).

<p>This is a transcript of the item on the BBC 2 programme Rapido about Kate's 
album. The punctuation is mine, and is as accurate as I can make it given that Kate 
ums and ers a lot and does not always complete sentences. There is an unseen female 
announcer and Kate replying to unheard questions. 
</p>



<p>A. The Sensual World is Kate's first collection of new songs in four years. Advance 
reports of the album have already raised a few eyebrows. 
</p>

<p>K. I shouldn't have made the mistake of saying that I felt ... I felt that this album 
was my most personal and most female so far, and everyone has been saying to 
me &quot;What do you mean by female?&quot; And it's just a feeling really, that ... it just 
feels more an expression of myself as a woman this time. 
</p>

<p>I. Much of the new LP was recorded at Kate's home studio in Kent but its musical 
contributors come from far and wide. They include French harpist Alan Stivell 
who obviously wasn't put off by Kate's tea-making . 
</p>

<p>&lt; shots of Kate making tea in best British transport cafe tradition&gt; 
</p>

<p>K. I've been a big fan of Alan's music for quite a while and I thought how nice it 
would be to get him to come in and play some harp and about two days later this 
letter turned up out of the blue ... and I'd never met the guy or spoken to him or 
anything, and it was a letter from Alan saying that he'd really like to work with 
me and he didn't know if I'd heard his music but ... and it's like, you know, 
within a space of two days we'd suddenly come into the air ... and so that is how 
we met and worked together. 
</p>

<p>I. Among the other guests on The Sensual World are Bulgarian singers the Trio 
Bulgarka and an old friend, Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd. 
</p>

<p>K. It was so good for me to come this full circle where, as you know, Dave was very 
involved in getting my initial signing to the record company and I'd kinda written 
this song and I knew I wanted the Bulgarian singers to be the main body of the 
song. And the idea is that at one point in the song the character dresses up as a 
rocket and jumps off this bridge, and it just felt so right that Dave Gilmour should 
be the rocket - you know, sort of ... off the bridge. You know ... he's kind of the 
guitar hero isn't he? 
</p>

<p>I. There was a time when Kate could turn out two albums in the same year and then 
go off on a major tour. Nowadays the excitement of an LP release is more likely 
to make her disappear for a few years. 
</p>

<p>K. I feel that it's important for me to retreat and to ... I don't see myself as a 
famous person, as a personality. It's really just me pushing my work. You know, I 
have to kinda promote my work, not me. So as soon as the work has been 
promoted then I can go back to doing the work and not promoting it. So I tend 
not to get involved in a lot of areas of the business and just sort of stay quiet until 
I've got another album out. &lt;laughs&gt; 
</p>

<p>I. Kate's debut some eleven years ago provoked an epidemic of weak knees amongst 
schoolboys and grown-men alike. Many have never recovered and in fact seem to 
get worse with each new Bush sighting. 
</p>

<p>K. Well, I think they must be completely mad. &lt; laughs &gt; It's extraordinary. You 
know, I find that even more extraordinary than the fact that people are willing to 
wait four years and then want to buy an album, and the fact that people still even 
bother to ask me if I'm going to tour, you know ... I think you're all completely 
mad ... &lt;laughs&gt; and thank you very much, but ... &lt;laughs &gt;
