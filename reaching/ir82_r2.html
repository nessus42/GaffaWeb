<P>The Dreaming Debut 
</P>
<P>Radio 2 
</P>
<P>Sept. 13, 1982 
</P>
<P>[Wuthering Heights is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Well it was number 1 for quite a few weeks back in 1978, a song called
Wuthering  Heights and it certainly launched the name of Kate Bush all over the
world. It  established her as an instant international success. And today, well,
Kate Bush  brings out a brand new album. Her story, I suppose, has been told
many times,  everybody knows what a tremendous success she's been. And the new
album on  your shelves today is called The Dreaming. 
</P>
<P>I know, Kate, it has taken you virtually a whole year to write it and record
it and  produce it, indeed. So how often can you have the luxury of devoting a
year to an  album. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, well, that is the first time. I think the thing that happens is each
time I do an  album it takes me longer and with this album it was very demanding
and there  were lots of things that I wanted to do so I knew it was going to
take a long time.  But it is a luxury, really, to be able to spend that amount
of time in the studio. 
</P>
<P>I: You were also telling me though it's been a lot of hard work. I mean a
year  sounds a long time but it's been hard work getting it all together. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it has. I think it's the hardest thing I've ever done. It's
definitely the most  involved thing I've ever done. 
</P>
<P>I: Because, again, it's your bid to come up with something really different,
is that  why it's been, you know, time consuming and more difficult? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, that's definitely got something to do with it. But when you're
working on  songs they very much dictate what you should do to them, so in many
ways I was  just trying to make the songs as best as they could be and they were
very much  demanding what should be done to them. 
</P>
<P>I: I notice in fact that you've given one track a rather Irish flavor, you
involved the  group Planxty. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, indeed! 
</P>
<P>I: Now again, that goes back a bit to your own family traditions, doesn't
it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, very much so, because my mother is Irish and when I was very little
the  music in the house was very Irish traditional music. And I think I've
always  loved it. 
</P>
<P>I: So you were brought up on the Barron [??? spelling] and the Fiddles and
the pipes  and all of the rest of it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, absolutely! 
</P>
<P>I: So what have you done with this particular track? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, when I wrote the song I felt straight away that the choruses where
just  waiting for something like a Caley [??? spelling] band and it was just a
matter of  getting in touch with the people from Planxty and seeing if there
were willing to  do it. And I managed to contact a man called Bill Whelan, who's
the keyboard  player in Planxty, and he arranged the whole passage in the
choruses. And it's  really beautiful, I think it's changed the song a great
deal, and definitely for the  better. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Certainly a very different sign for Kate Bush, what else have you done on
the  album that makes it different? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, what's nice really, because each song is slightly different, I've
been able to  use lots of different people to do their thing on the track. And
it was nice,  because the last single had a very Australian flavor, so we used a
lot of Australian  sounding instruments... 
</P>
<P>I: Not the dijeridu!? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, indeed. 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, my goodness. [Kate laughs] What, Rolf Harris? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, indeed! 
</P>
<P>I: In person? 
</P>
<P>K: In person! [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: And who else have you used? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I've been using some different string arrangers, which is nice. I
used a man  called Dave Lawson and what's nice about him is he's worked alot in
film music  and so he's very sort of visually inspired. And it's nice to work
with someone  that's used to working with visuals as apposed to just audials.
And I used a  choirboy on one track, that was very nice. I've never worked with
children,  before, really. And he was beautiful, he was really perfect. 
</P>
<P>I: And this is the first time you've produced an album. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Again, was this at your instigation, I mean that you wanted to see the
whole thing  through from beginning to end and that everything would be you? 
</P>
<P>K: Well when I wrote the songs for this album, they felt very different from
any of  the songs I've written before and it just felt write that I should go
the whole way  this time. I don't know if I've ever really felt like that before
and I don't know  if I will in the future, but I really felt that way with these
songs, that it was  important that I did follow it through with this one. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you ever worry about taking such a long time away from recording and
chart  signs and being in touch with the public as such, that the public will
get a bit  fickle and, not exactly forget, but certainly, you know, that that
instant thing  might not be there? 
</P>
<P>K: Hmmm. Yes I think it worries me alot. Especially as there seem to be more
 projects that I do that do take up a lot of time, like maybe a year at a time.
But I  have to really sit and think, you know, what is the most important thing
to me, to  stay in the public's eye or to make sure that the work I do is more
interesting  and that it gets better. And really the only way to make sure that
the work gets  better is to concentrate on it. So that's definitely my priority.

</P>
<P>I: Hmm. Early on we were taking about Tony Handcock having been a real 
perfectionist. Now you're a real perfectionist, yourself, I know that cause you 
believe in putting a lot of grind work and homework into it. For example, all
the  dance and mime classes you taken, you know, for your visual side of it. And
 you're back at your dance classes again, so what exactly are you doing? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, for the last couple of months I've been getting back into training
because  while I've been making the album there's been not time at all, so I've
been  unfit for a whole year. And of course when you leave it alone for a length
of time  coming back to it is even harder and it's very painful, you know, you
can't walk  for days. But it's all in preparation for things that are coming up
in the future, for  videos and that sort of thing. So there are a lot of areas
that I have to work on all  time, which is again why I seem to be so busy. 
</P>
<P>I: Originally what was your idea in wanting to incorporate theatre, really,
into your  presentation of music? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I'd been writing songs for a long time and I was very happy about
the idea  of being involved in music and I'd never even really thought about
dance until I  decided to leave school because I wanted to get involved in the
music. So dance  just came out of the blue really,. I needed something to do,
something to work on  while I wasn't at school and something that would
complement the music. And  dance, really, just became the obvious thing. I was
very lucky to go and see a  show by Lindsay Kemp and he really inspired a couple
of years of hard work in  dance schools for me. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, but it's more than dance, I mean, you took mime lessons... 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: ... and around is that whole theatrical... I mean everything is really
exaggerated,  isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think very much the theatrical flavour came again from Lindsay.
Because  he's surrounded by a strange magic, it's a very unusual theatrical
magic. And  once you've seen a show of his or you've been involved with him, it
stays with  you forever. It happens to everyone who works with Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>I: Well Kate, we look forward to taking to you through until two o'clock.
The calls  will be coming in on 01-580-44-11. 
</P>
<P>[Tape cuts. The Man With The Child In His Eyes is played] 
</P>
<P>I: A rather wistful sound from Kate Bush, our special guest until two
o'clock today.  That record was a follow up to that smash hit, Wuthering
Heights, back in 1978. It  was called The Man With The Child In His Eyes. And
we'll be hearing some  tracks off Kate's new album, which is on the shelves
today. The title of it is The  Dreaming and we'll be taking your telephone calls
as well. But thinking about  The Man With The Child In His Eyes, now you wrote
that... the age of what,  fourteen, fifteen, around that period. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, yes that's right. 
</P>
<P>I: Very young, so you obviously started really at a very early age, writing?

</P>
<P>K: Yes, I did. I probably wrote the first song when I was about eleven, but
I mean it  was terrible [laughs], very overdone. And I think the more you write
songs you,  just get a knack for them, hopefully. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: You mentioned early that your family were musical, you know, your mother
sort of  enjoyed music and so on. Was it just because of that background that
you wanted  to write or was it a love of poetry or reading or what? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it was a big combination of everything. Cause my mother is a...
well when  she was in Ireland she used to dance all the time so there's
definitely that spirit  in her. And I think all of us have, in the family, have
tended to go towards the  musical direction, which is very interesting. I'm sure
it comes from her and  perhaps my father as well 'cause he used to play the
piano alot, so maybe it's the  combination. 
</P>
<P>I: You're father's a doctor, though, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, that's right, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: ...is still a doctor? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes he is, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: But at home, I mean, did you have a lot of these musical sessions and is
that partly  what set the theme for you? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, when I was about six, seven, that sort of age, my two brothers were
getting  into folk music alot and they were going 'round to folk clubs. And
they'd often  have evenings every week where a load of there friends would come
'round and  in a way it's quite parallel to the sort of evenings that would have
happened in  Ireland... 
</P>
<P>I: Caleys [??? spelling] 
</P>
<P>K: That's right! Where they just play music all night, and they'd be playing
folk  songs. And as I got a bit older I started to join in and learn folk songs,
I mean  they were the first songs I really learned - sea shanties, that sort of
thing. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you remember any of those songs? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, vaguely, yeah. I mean, some of them I still love to listen to because
the  stories are always so interesting, they're beautiful, lovely lyrics. And
the tunes are  always very pretty as well. 
</P>
<P>I: But then you were signed to your record company at around sixteen and yet
you  weren't launched until you were about nineteen. 
</P>
<P>K: No. 
</P>
<P>I: Was it a question of just, you know, keeping you writing there and
waiting for the  right song? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think so because I was very young. I was sixteen, still at
school, and I had  no experience in the business at all. And I think in a way
all of us wanted to just  hang on until I was a bit more prepared to cope with
the situation. And as far as  I'm concerned I'm very glad that did happen,
because in those two years  between leaving school and things starting to happen
when the album was  released, I really built a foundation for myself as a person
as well as for the  direction I was going in. Since I left school I was going to
London every day and  to dancing classes and really for the first time becoming
an individual. And I  think those couple of years were really important. 
</P>
<P>I: I have to ask you, though, about your high pitched range, what reaction
did you get  when you came out with Wuthering Heights to the actual pitch? 
</P>
<P>K: I think there were a lot of different reactions, some people really liked
it, some  people really didn't, and other people found it very amusing. For me,
really, I just  see it as a phase of my writing where I was just into playing
around with that  kind of range. And I find it changes, I mean as far as I'm
concerned that's an  old style for me now. But of course a lot of people still
see that as being me now.  But that's just, you know, part of the time situation
where for a lot of people they  will always think of me as Wuthering Heights and
nothing else. But... 
</P>
<P>I: That was partly because it was so unusual, you know. It was really quite
unique in  itself. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I suppose so. And also of course it was the most successful single
I've had, so  that obviously does tend to stick in people's mind alot. But as
far as I'm  concerned, I feel like I'm changing, hopefully with each album I do.

</P>
<P>I: Do you ever listen back to a lot of records and say [makes &quot;UGH&quot;
sound. Kate  laughs.]? &quot;Don't like what I did there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: I very rarely listen to my old stuff and when I do hear it, yes it is
sometimes that  feeling, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: In what? In content, or voice pitch, or what? 
</P>
<P>K: It's especially my voice. I mean, in a way I'm still quite fond of some
of the  flavors of the old albums and some of the songs, but, my voice, it
seems... it  always sounds so young to me, because, you know, I feel that it's
changing all the  time. I: [Imitates Wuthering Heights voice. Kate laughs.] I
was practicing all  night, you see, to no avail whatsoever. However, Johnaton
Jinkins is on the line  from Cornwall from St. Austin [??? spelling]. Hello
Jonathan? 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Hello, Gloria. 
</P>
<P>I: And what's your question to Kate Bush? 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Also, Kate. 
</P>
<P>K: Hello! 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: A couple of times you've mentioned in your songs a person called 
Gurdjieff. I know a little about him, but I wonder if you could explain what his
 beliefs or tresis are and how he influences are and how he influences you in...
 well when you make your music? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, Gurdjieff was really an influence in that I'd just read some of his
books and  really no more than that. And I'd just found a lot of what he said
interesting, but  that's really as far as it goes. 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Maybe we should elaborate a little bit about who the gentleman is?

</P>
<P>K: Yes, well Gurdjieff was... he was considered a leader of a religious
movement, I  think. But as far as I know he just had a lot of ideas about
creating a way that  would make people stronger and more together. And it's just
a different way of  doing it. And it was also trying to go for a more western
way of doing. But I do  very little about it, so I really wouldn't like to say
very much because it's a  subject that I feel if I'm going to speak about than I
should know what I'm  talking about and I don't. 
</P>
<P>I: It's obviously something you've caught'n onto, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you interested in that side of it? 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Well a friend of mine mentioned him to me and I knew basicly
nothing  about him. And I went to a local library and there was nothing there
about him.  So, of course, Kate mentioned him in a few of her songs, so I just
wondered if  you could inform me anymore? 
</P>
<P>I: Well the influence was minimal by the sound of it. 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, yes it was, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Touch luck Jonathan, you picked out the wrong one. [Kate laughs] 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: [??? inaudible] 
</P>
<P>I: Thank you very much indeed for your call. Bye, bye. 
</P>
<P>K: Bye. 
</P>
<P>Jonathan: Bye. 
</P>
<P>I: Who else influenced you, do you feel, in terms of your writing or your 
performance? 
</P>
<P>K: Gosh, so many people. I think definitely, my performance I would say
people like  Lindsay and a lot of the teachers that I was taught by, especially
when I started  dance, because there's no doubt when you're being taught
movements they stay,  you remember those patterns. And I suppose in writings,
gosh... 
</P>
<P>I: Even in terms of other performers, I mean who do you admire? I'm not
saying  that you would copy there style or anything. 
</P>
<P>K: I'm a big admirer of Bowie, and people like David Byrne as well. Eno, I
think  Eno is fantastic. Captain Beefheart, it's a very wide range, really. I
think there's  a lot of music that I enjoy. But it's mainly people that tend to
show strength and  originality. People like Bowie, who have gone for something
different and they're  still standing there. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, you've certainly got the originality. And we'll be back for more
questions  from you at home. Thank you for the calls, they're coming in fast and
furious.  And we'll be back to you right after this new single from Gilbert
O'Sullevin. 
</P>
<P>[Bare With Me is played] 
</P>
<P>I: ...single from Gilbert O'Sullevin, it's called Bare With Me. The time is 
twenty-one minutes past one o'clock. Kate Bush is our special guest today,
taking  telephone calls, that's just a little bit of information in case you've
joined us on  your lunch break. And if you have, well then welcome along, you're
late. [Kate  laughs] Miles Zedon is the next caller from Draton in Portsmith.
Good afternoon  to you Miles. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Hello, Gloria. 
</P>
<P>I: Lot's of sunshine in Portsmith, at the moment? 
</P>
<P>Miles: Yeah, it's beautiful at the moment. 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, good. You sound very chirpy. 
</P>
<P>Miles: [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: And what's your question for Kate. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Right. I just wanted to ask Kate: I noticed with her recent single,
The  Dreaming, it's got a type of an aborigine sound and I just want to know
whether  there was anything that inspired you to change your style of music? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, well I think that, ah, well, especially for that song, it was
inspired years ago  by Rolf Harris's Sun Arise. And, although when I heard it
then - I was probably  about six - it never occurred to me that I would write a
song inspired by it, that  is in fact what happened 'cause it's been in my head
ever since. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Cause he plays on it, doesn't he? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes he does, that's right. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: I suppose in terms of general ideas, Kate, maybe we could talk a little
about that.  Just where you pluck these ideas from, is this something that
occurs to you in  every day life or do you discipline yourself to sit down and
think about things? 
</P>
<P>K: They're very often ideas that come out of other people's creations. Films
and  books are very much big inspirations to me. For instance, there's a track
on this  album that was.. really the whole atmosphere was inspired by The
Shining. I  read the book and it was such an incredibly strong atmosphere, very
creepy, very  haunted, and I used it to like set a song using the same
atmosphere, but instead of  it being a hotel it being like a house, which is
also a human being. And just  playing with the feelings that I got when I read
the book and trying to put that  same kind and strangeness into the song. 
</P>
<P>I: I'm going to turn the tables a little bit, Miles, what do you like about
Kate's  music? 
</P>
<P>Miles: I don't know, it's just different, really. As she said it's very
expressive, her  music and it's meaningful... 
</P>
<P>K: [whispers] Yeah! 
</P>
<P>Miles: ... and you know every song is different, I think, she's trying to
say  something different. So, you know, I've liked Kate's records ever since 
Wuthering Heights, so... 
</P>
<P>I: You've been hooked. [Kate laughs] 
</P>
<P>Miles: I have, I'm afraid. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, great Miles! [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: You're a deep thinker, Miles. I'm telling you. [Kate laughs] You're in as
far as  Kate's concerned. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Oh, that's good. 
</P>
<P>K: A very intelligent human being! 
</P>
<P>I: So thank you very much for your call. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Okay, thanks very much. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you heading back to work? 
</P>
<P>Miles: Yes, I am now, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: What do you work at? 
</P>
<P>Miles: I work at a bank. 
</P>
<P>I: In a bank! 
</P>
<P>Miles: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, you're one of the civilized people of this community. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Oh, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you a teller? 
</P>
<P>Miles: Well, not at the moment, no. They sorta changed around a bit. 
</P>
<P>I: Okay, well we'll let you get back to work anyway. Thanks, Miles for the
call.  Okay, bye, bye. 
</P>
<P>Miles: Bye, bye. 
</P>
<P>I: And from Portsmith we move to Essex. We have Graham Singleton on the
line.  Good afternoon to you, Graham. 
</P>
<P>Graham: Good afternoon. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you home or at work or where? 
</P>
<P>Graham: Um, at home. 
</P>
<P>I: You're at home. Doing what? 
</P>
<P>Graham: Ah, not alot. 
</P>
<P>I: Not alot. Are you still at school as a matter of interest? 
</P>
<P>Graham: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: And when do you go back? 
</P>
<P>Graham: Um, well I'm back at the moment. 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, you're just on a lunch break. Good, well I'm glad you've joined us on
your  lunch break. And what's your question for Kate Bush? 
</P>
<P>Graham: I'd like to ask her what's she's going to do, eventually. Whether
she's  going to stay on the singing or use her ten &quot;O&quot; levels [Kate
laughs] to go get a job  or go into acting? 
</P>
<P>I: Do you want to use your ten &quot;O&quot; levels to get a job, a proper
job? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] Yeah, get a proper job, yeah. Well I would like to think that
I'm going  to stay in the singing world because I think the thing that means a
lot to me - it  means more than anything, really. I think I'd rather stay
writing songs and  singing them then anything else and if there's any way that I
can continue to do  that then I would love to very much. But, I must admit,
dancing is another  interest that perhaps I would go off on a bit more in the
future, it really depends  [on] how things go for me. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, but as Graham has mentioned your ten &quot;O&quot; levels [Kate
laughs] very aptly.  When you think about it, you mentioned earlier that
finishing your exams and  taking that period before you went into the business
consolidated a lot of your  own thoughts. And as suppose that eduction in terms
of reading and, you know,  widening your horizons, that must really stand you in
good stead anyway. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think it helped a bit. I think the thing about &quot;O&quot;
levels, especially with me,  is that I don't remember most of what I learnt to
get those &quot;O&quot; levels. It was  very much a matter of rehearsing for the
exams, getting them, then forgetting the  information. But I think there are a
couple of subjects that certainly helped me.  English, especially, the essays
and the competitions they were a very big starting  ground for me. And also the
music, because I learnt the violin at school and in  many ways that gave me lot
of knowledge about theory and sight reading. So I'm  sure they did help quite a
lot, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: What stage are you at, Graham, at school. 
</P>
<P>Graham: Well, I'm not very far... 
</P>
<P>I: Well, what form are you in - third year, fourth year...? 
</P>
<P>Graham: Well, I'm not actually at school at the moment, my mum's teaches me
at  moment. 
</P>
<P>I: You're not at school. Right. OK Graham, well thank you very much for the
call.  All the very best to you. 
</P>
<P>K: Bye, Graham! 
</P>
<P>Graham: Bye. 
</P>
<P>I: Good luck. And we come to the album, we're going to hear the first track
off this  new album, which is out today. The album is called The Dreaming and
this song  is about Houdini. So I think first of all, the story behind the song.

</P>
<P>K: Well, Houdini, I think most people know him for being the escapologist,
the man  who's who's wriggling around in a sack on the pavement. But I started
finding  out about a side of his life that seemed more interesting, for me,
where he spent  a lot of years actually going around to mediums and seances,
exposing the fact  that they were frauds. He'd try to contact his mother when
she died and he just  meant fraud after fraud and they were after his money and
as far he was  concerned they were just making people very unhappy just in order
to get  money. So he spent years just going 'round to these places, and
revealing the  wires and revealing the technicalities and all this sort of
thing. But between him  and his wife they made a code and it was very strange
because they made this so  that if perhaps one of them ever died and the other
tried to contact them through  a medium or a seance, that they would know that
it was really them and not a  fraud. And when Houdini died his wife did actually
start going around to the  mediums and the seances, more or less what he had
done when he had been  alive. And the same thing for years, she just came across
so many fakes and  people that really were not true mediums at all. Until one
day she had a phone  call from a man who said that Houdini had come through to
him. So she went to  see him, and he gave her the code that only Houdini and her
had known and as  far as she was concerned he had made contact with her. 
</P>
<P>So the [??? inaudible tape cuts out] is really all about her and him and how
very  much in love they were and how terrible it was for her when he died, but
that  they did make contact again. So it's all about that special moment. 
</P>
<P>[Houdini is played] 
</P>
<P> I: That's off Kate Bush's new album. The album is called Dreaming [sic] and
that  particular track was called Houdini. And in fact Houdini's wife in that
particular  track was, as it were, possessed, there was quite a lot of
distortion. How did you  achieve that effect? 
</P>
<P>K: Well the idea is that it's as she's watching him go off into his tank of
water for  the last time, and it's the idea that she is this sort of possessed
demon that's  terrified of him going. And I drank about a pint of milk before I
did the vocal  and ate like two bars of chocolate. And the great thing about
those sort of foods is  it really creates a lot of mucus and normally that's the
last thing you want when  you sing, you normally want a very pure voice, but I
wanted to get all that sort of  spit and gravel in the thought. [Clears thought]
So I worked on bringing the  gravel out and then we also... as I sung the track
we sped the track up a bit so  that when it was played back the voice would just
be slightly deeper, just have  slightly more weight in it. 
</P>
<P>I: Hm. Some of the tricks of the trade in recording studios. 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Our next caller is Melissa Grief, she's in Davashire. Hello to Melissa. 
</P>
<P>Melissa: Hello. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you at home today? 
</P>
<P>Melissa: Pardon? 
</P>
<P>I: Are you at home today? 
</P>
<P>Melissa: Yes, I am. 
</P>
<P>I: You are. What's your question for Kate Bush? 
</P>
<P>Melissa: I wanted to know what kind of expectations and apprehensions she
has of  herself and of an audience before a performance? 
</P>
<P>I: The old nerves, Melissa, aye? 
</P>
<P>K: Hmm. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you nervous before you go on stage? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, I'm probably not as nervous before I go on stage for a concert as I
am for a  lot of other things. The great thing about the show we did, for
instance, was we  rehearsed it for so long that it was... there was very little
to be that nervous of,  because it was so rehearsed. In fact, it was quite a
relief to do it for the first night  because it was actually going out to an
audience. But I think I do suffer from  nerves alot in other areas, and I worry
a lot, especially about, you know, is my  music good enough at the moment, am I
really doing the right thing, is this good  enough, is that good enough. And I
think it is all quite tied in with nerves so I do  get nervous in situations
where things are very important. But, I think you learn  to cope. But sometimes
I'm... I mean, like I'm a lot less nervous about some  things now then I used to
be and other things... 
</P>
<P>I: For example, I mean what are you less nervous about? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, well things like this. I mean, I still get nervous for instance, like
speaking on  the radio, but it's not as nerve racking for me as it would have
been a couple of  years ago. And yet other things seem to get even more worrying
for me. One of  the hardest things I find to do, is get up in a room full of
people and just speak to  them. I think that is incredibly difficult. 
</P>
<P>I: Could you do that Melissa? [Kate laughs] 
</P>
<P>Melissa: I don't think so, no. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you suffer from nerves, I mean in that form, that you don't really
like to, you  know, get out in front of people and do things? 
</P>
<P>Melissa: I think so, yes. I wouldn't like to perform in any way, I don't
think. 
</P>
<P>I: You don't think. You're happy enough to stay at home. [Laughs] Do you
have any  family, Melissa? 
</P>
<P>Melissa: Yes. Well, just my [cartoon ??? inaudible] brother and mom. 
</P>
<P>I: Obviously you're not married. 
</P>
<P>Melissa: I'm not married. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you work at all? 
</P>
<P>Melissa: No, I'm at college. 
</P>
<P>[Non Kate talk skipped] 
</P>
<P>I: And now we have another Kate, this time Kate Teese it looks like in
Maidenhead.  Good afternoon to you Kate. 
</P>
<P>Kate T: Hello. 
</P>
<P>I: Is your surname correct, is it Teese? 
</P>
<P>Kate T: Yes that's right, Teese. 
</P>
<P>I: Sometimes it's hard to make out the writing. However Kate what's your
question  today? 
</P>
<P>Kate T: Well, I'm really ringing for my daughter who would have rung if
she'd  been at home. But she's a great fan of yours, Kate and she belongs to
your fan  club and has got all of your records. But she's at college today so
she can't ring  you. And I'm sure she'd have asked you, if she was here, when
are you doing  any live appearances, because she's dying to see you. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, great. Well I've been dying to do some more performances since the
last  show and I'm really hoping to get something together next year. My problem
is  that it really takes so much time that there's no way we could fit it in
this year.  And as yet I don't know when it will be next year, but it will be
next year  sometime. 
</P>
<P>I: Now when you say time, what kind of preparation and work do you have to
put  into a live show? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, it's incredible! There are so many different areas. It's really like
a huge,  great jigsaw that you're piecing together. You have to start with a
band, and then  you have the people that are up front like the dancers, you have
the lighting guy,  the stage designer, the costumes, the crew, a tour manager, I
mean there are just  so many areas. And in a lot of ways, because it's dance and
sound, I'm involved  in a lot of those fringe areas as well. And it really would
take a good six months  to get another tour together. 
</P>
<P>I: Because you would have a lot more production in your show then maybe
other  performers would have. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, yes, because we like to go for a theatrical show, yes, that's right.

</P>
<P>I: You tend to forget about that, Kate Teese - I have to identify which Kate
I'm  talking to now. [Kate laughs] I mean, the rest of us tend to think &quot;oh,
well, you  just stand up and do your stuff and you get the band on the road and
that's it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: Yeah. Oh, no, my daughter, whose name is Julien, by the way,
Julien  Row, she is involved in a lot of drama at college and she realizes how
much goes  into it. 
</P>
<P>K: Great. 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: And she's also studying &quot;A&quot; level music so she
appreciates all the... she  really likes your songs because you write them and
arrange them, everything  yourself. 
</P>
<P>K: Great. What does she want to do? 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: Um, well at the moment she wants to be an interior designer. 
</P>
<P>K: Fantastic! 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: But, ah, you know she's doing her &quot;A&quot; levels next
summer so I don't  quite know what will happen then. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, wish her a lot of luck for me, will you? 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: Yes, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>I: All the best to you Kate, thanks for your call. 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: Thank you, bye bye. 
</P>
<P>Kate Teese: Bye, bye. 
</P>
<P>I: A lot of fast fired questions, if I can put it like that. Colin Home
calls in from  Harrygate in Yorkshire and he wants to know &quot;PLEASE are you
going to be up  north anywhere where he can go and see you, will you be
promoting your  album?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Well I'm going to be doing some P.A.s and that's where I go to shops and
sign  records for people. And I hoping to go around the country in a couple of
weeks  to do some of those, but I don't know where. But I'm sure it will be
publicized  somewhere. 
</P>
<P>I: Watch the local press. And Colin also says, &quot;in Sat In Your Lap
cover it's written  'well done J.B.'&quot; and he wants to who J.B. is. 
</P>
<P>K: J.B. is a guy called John Barrot who certainly deserves to be
congratulated 'cause  he did something very clever. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Very clever, you're not going to tell us anything further. No? 
</P>
<P>K: Nope! 
</P>
<P>I: Secrets you see, today. Steven Day, he's in Staphasure and he wants to
know the  conflict between a performer and the record company in who decides
which song  is going to be released as a single? 
</P>
<P>K: I think that situation differs greatly from artist to artist and in my
situation I'm  very lucky, I seem to normally have the last say in which the
single will be. 
</P>
<P>I: You're an adamant lady in other words [Kate laughs] and get your own way.

</P>
<P>K: I guess so, yeah. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Okay, Loria Proud is in Birmingham and Loria would like to know &quot;when
you  come to write a song do you ever get any inspiration from classical music
that  you've listened to in your spare time?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, yes I think classical music is very inspirational. Again, because
it's normally  quite visual, you close your eyes and wonderful landscapes start
happening. So  I'm sure it has been very inspirational. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you listen to a lot of classical stuff? 
</P>
<P>K: No, not as much as I used to,no. I listen to a lot more contemporary
stuff now. 
</P>
<P>I: Mark Ridgewell in Northamptonshire he says &quot;when you write an album,&quot;
he's  listened to you today talking about you know various tracks, &quot;but
overall what is  your main aim when you put all those songs down?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: I think the main aim is to get some kind of emotional impact across, and 
hopefully it's the emotional situation that goes with the subject matter of the 
song. [Pause and then Kate laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: But, again, I mean in overall success terms. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, I see. 
</P>
<P>I: Cause you must aim as well to put out an record that pleases fans or
pleases you  or? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, obviously it's more important to me that it pleases me when I'm
making it,  but when it comes out it's fantastic if other people like it, I mean
that's really  the reward for all the hard work. 
</P>
<P>I: Obviously many people are interested in the ideas that you take. And
Kristeen  Coola in Barnsley she wants to know &quot;are you never inspired by
every day events,  I mean topical events, newsy events?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think um, I think I am, yes. The thing about a lot of those kind
of events is  that people cover them again and again in songs because they are
obviously very  moving matters. But yes, I think the state of the world
influences me a lot, I think  it does every writer. 
</P>
<P>I: But deep down I think when it comes to your songs, you're more of a
romantic,  are you not? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think I'm more concerned with the psychological side of human
beings. I  am a romant... romantasist as well. But I think I'm very interested
in the way  that people's brains work, they're very different from each other
sometimes.  [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: That's for sure. Well, we've talked alot about your early career, we've
talked a  lot about the album [really????] I would like to talk a little about
the next twelve  months or thereabouts. You said that you might go on tour but
what else do you  plan to do now that you've got this album made? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, um... Obviously this was the most important step to get over and
really now  I'm trying to catch on all the things that I've got behind with
because the album  has taken so long. And I'm going to be promoting the album
and doing some  work in Europe and that kind of thing and making some videos for
the singles.  And then I'll be working on rehearsing for the show, which
obviously has to  start a good six months up front of the show happening. 
</P>
<P>I: So, I don't know what you'll do in your spare time over the next twelve
months.  But, Kate, thanks very much for coming in today. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: And perhaps you would set up this particular track, Sat In Your Lap.
Maybe tell  me the story about that. 
</P>
<P>K: Okay. When I went to see the Stevie Wonder gig and it was incredible, it
was  really good. And the next night I went into our home studio and wrote the
song  in a couple of hours and that was it, one of the quickest songs I've ever
written. 
</P>
<P>I: And here it is. 
</P>
<P>[Sat In Your Lap is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Sat In Your Lap, thats off the new Kate Bush album, the album is called
Dreaming  [sic]. Kate has been our guest throughout the program. I'd like to
thank her very  much and of course to you as well, at home, for your telephone
and your queries.
