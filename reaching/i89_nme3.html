<p>The following article appears in this week's NME. I think all those who have 
heard any of the Voix Bulgares discs or the Trio Bulgarka will be very excited about 
the news that Kate is including Bulgarian voices on the new album. There's even 
mention of a tour (well kinda).

<p>Short but sweet, a brief musical meeting of East and West, it's the sort of sensual 
aural treat every philanthropist would wish to share with the World. Except that the 
World would have been pushed to fit in this studio broom cupboard off Upper 
Street, Islington. 
</p>

<p>We are talking here, my friends, about the power of music. Not 'music' to make 
megabucks, or 'music' to drop acid to, or 'music' to make you forget, but music 
that stimulates the pleasure senses and gently feeds emotions. We are talking Trio 
Bulgarka, those legendary Balkan vocal veterans - Rupkina, Stoyanka Boneva, and 
Eva Georgieva - who find themselves contributing to Kate Bush's first album in 
three years. 
</p>

<p>While a Beeb camera crew films the Trio - in technicolour national costume, 
laughing and chattering through 'Dva Kornie' - for the Rhythms of the World 
series, I find myself closeted with the traditionally taciturn Kate Bush. She rarely 
agrees to interviews these days, and rarely agrees to interviews these days, and 
rarely allows outsiders to intrude on her studio work, yet here she is relaxed - all in 
black with long flames of hair - and glad to be back making music. Particularly with 
the Bulgarians. 
</p>

<p>Her Bulgar obsession stems from her brother Paddy, multi-instrumentalist and 
student of ethnic musics and musicians. 
</p>

<p>&quot;He had this tape of Bulgarian voices, three years ago,&quot; says Kate, &quot;just when we 
were finishing &quot;Hounds of Love'. It was the most incredible thing I've ever heard, 
beautiful. So I decided I wanted to work with them in some form in the future ... 
But it takes me a long time to digest ideas - even if I read a book it maybe won't 
come out into a song until four years later. So I wrote a track with a 
choir-synthesiser sound hoping that if we could get to work with them, they would 
take the weight of the song from the synthesisers.&quot; 
</p>

<p>She made contact with Trio Bulgarka through their British producer/promoter/ 
friend/Bragg associate Joe Boyd of Hannibal Records, who released the 'Balkana' 
compilation in '87 and the Trio's own 'The Forest is crying' LP earlier this year. 
Two weeks ago Kate visited Bulgaria and returned with the Trio to record two 
tracks in London. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I was very worried because chances were it might not work,&quot; she admits, 
&quot;particularly because they're so good. It might just sound like we'd bunged them in 
a Western track. I really didn't want them to be dragged down to my level. I was 
worried that they wouldn't want to get involved with Western pop music, because it 
has a bad name and a lot of people are initially scared of it ... I don't blame them at 
all.&quot; 
</p>

<p>&quot;We had to get a special arranger (Dmitr Penev) because the beauty is not just in 
the voices but also in the ancient arrangements. He was brilliant, it couldn't have 
been better, the way we managed to communicate exactly what we wanted despite 
language problems ... It sounds corny but I do feel very honoured.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The raw results of these sessions which I hear by accident, sound impressive. Any 
fears that Bush might be dabbling in some sort of Bulgarian 'Duck Rock' or even 
'Graceland' territory are dispelled by the true spirit of the recording; the emotion 
of the Trio's traditional singing is beautifully complimented by Kate's distinctive 
vocal. The Trio sing Bulgarian words, so perhaps the Azanian chorals of Gabriel's 
'Biko' would be a closer reference point, although there's not quite such a potent 
message here. 
</p>

<p>&quot;You're not distracted by words,&quot; suggests Kate, &quot;all you're picking up are the 
emotions that they're translating to you. It feels like very deep information. There's 
one point when Yanka's belting it out, really fantastic, yet she's singing something 
like, 'Marco sits down with his mother and has some bread and jam'!&quot; 
</p>

<p>That's one of the strange things about Bulgarian music. You find yourself sitting, 
listening, awe-struck, lump-throated, only to find you've been moved to tears by a 
song about a bumble-bee or a mosquito playing the bagpipes or dark-eyed Yanka's 
marigolds (&quot;I mislaid my kavals by your gates last night, Elenke, did you see them?&quot;). 
Whatever they sing about it always comes over as powerful, spine-tinglingly heartfelt 
(particularly their lament for the Bulgarian Robin Hood Indje Voivode). Just listen 
and it's easy to understand why Kate Bush and others have been drawn to this 
music, this antithesis of producer pop for inspiration. 
</p>

<p>&quot;If they sing 'Strati Angelaki' to me I can't take it,&quot; confesses Kate, &quot;I have to 
leave the room, it just makes me cry and there are very few things musically that 
affect me like that.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Rather than increasing the difficulties, the language barrier between Kate and 
the Trio seems to have promoted their personal and working relationship. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I've been so excited doing it and it's so lovely for me to work with women as 
well, a tremendous difference. And because we can't talk intellectually - we can't 
talk about the state of Bulgaria or even what the shops are like in London - our 
whole communication is totally emotional. 
</p>

<p>&quot;It's an incredible experience, the warmth they give you, you don't often get it 
from Westerners. Here it's very much a communication of 'I have this, you don't 
have that' or 'I don't have that and you do', whereas they want to know what kind 
of person you are ... you can feel them probing your heart.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Bush has, of course, experimented before with global ideas on odd tracks: 
'Egypt', 'Kashka from Bagdad', the aboriginally-inspired 'The Dreaming', the 
Greek rhythms and portentous use of Bulgarian teppan (drum) on 'Jig of Life'. 
Here, the Bulgarian singers are playing a more central role than previous ethnic 
musicians (Esmail Sheikh, Donal Lunny, Liam O'Flynn, Rolf Harris), employed to 
compliment Kate's attempts to create lasting pop rather then quick cash. 
</p>

<p>It's been a strange experience for Trio Bulgarka, who are more used to the 
familiar string drones of the gadulka or the strummed tambura or the piping gaida 
than to Bush-style pop experimentalism. They seem, however, to have adapted with 
remarkable ease. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Kate's very popular in Bulgaria,&quot; says Yanka Rupkina through interpreter 
Borimira Nedeva, &quot;young people like her very much. She sings emotionally. there's 
lots of lovely thinking in her writing and she's a very good musician. It is our first 
time with such a famous singer and we hope we'll work with her in the future, if 
we haven't caused her too many worries.&quot; 
</p>

<p>There's the distinct, appealing prospect of Bush (in full Bulgarian gear?) 
performing live with the Trio; it's been donkeys since the Theatre of Kate was last 
seen onstage (benefits aside) but, she says, &quot;if anything could make me tour again it 
would be the people in this studio&quot;. 
</p>

<p>In the meantime we should be glad she's back in the studio; in the 80's she's 
proved to be one of the few artists with the courage to disappear for years and 
return with original, quality creations. ('Running up that Hill' was voted 13 in NME 
Top 150 Singles of All Time February 1987). After her initial late '70s/early '80s 
burst of energy, it was three years before 'Hounds of Love' followed 'The 
Dreaming' and, 'The Whole Story' singles compilation aside, it's been even longer 
this time. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I find it very difficult, nothing comes easy to me. I don't know if I'm a 
perfectionist, although people say that about me. I just find it harder each time to 
write songs. Ten songs doesn't sound many but you want each to say something 
about you and who you are at this point in time; to say something new. But the more 
you put into something the harder it becomes. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Making an album for me is very much a psychological process; it's very painful 
and it gets more painful each time. I think it's hard for people to understand 
because it seems so silly, an album's such a trivial thing really ... I've had to accept 
a lot of things about myself for this album that have been hard for me. Every time I 
kid myself that an album will take six weeks, but once I get in there and get halfway 
through it's too big for me. I think, 'My God, what am I doing in the middle of 
this?'&quot; 
</p>

<p>Well, I know what I'm doing in the middle of all this: enjoying myself, listening 
to Kate, to the music, to Bulgarian chattering. So ears aroused and with a Balkan 
spring in my step, I leave Kate with the Trio, wondering to myself how all this 
works. How it's possible to unite east and West, ancient and modern, while having 
to overcome cultural and linguistic differences. I express my surprise at the power of 
non-verbal communication to the translator Borimira, half-expecting a lengthy 
treatise on glasnost, perestroika or One Worldism. But she replies simply: &quot;Emotions 
are another world's language.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Ooh, I wish I'd said that. 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush's fifth [sic] album, Yanka Rupkina's first British solo album, and BBC 
2's Rhythms of the World programme will all appear in the New Year.
