<P><STRONG>The Kate Inside  </STRONG><BR>   (No writer's name given)</P>
<P>What lurks behind the flawless flesh of beautiful hit-making Kate Bush...?</P>
<P>She receives any compliments about her work with an ecstatic, childlike
delight</P>
<P>With her luscious looks, her art school eccentric dress  and her weird wail
of a voice, Kate Bush is, at 20,  already a star.</P>
<P>Her short story may not be a classic case of rags to riches  -- but it does
nevertheless, exude a strong fairy tale flavour.</P>
<P>The Bush background is impeccable middle class - her father  is a country
GP, and it was in this safe, secure sanctuary that  Kate's embryonic talents
unfurled, flowered and eventually  flourished.</P>
<P>Before she was even eleven, the Bush baby had taught herself  to play the
family piano and it was around this time she first  put pen to paper producing
piles of poetry, prose and eventually,  and inevitably, several songs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Choral Charms</STRONG></P>
<P>She left school at 16 with ten &quot;O&quot; levels (including  distinctions
in English and music), and a brain bulging with  musical ideas.</P>
<P>&quot;I knew I had to leave school then,&quot; she said &quot;I  wanted to
do something in music and I had to get away from the  alternative career
opportunities being rammed down my throat.&quot;</P>
<P>An inheritance from an aunt who had died gave Kate the financial  security
she needed to follow her own mind and so for a while she  continued to create
within the comfortable confines of her own family.</P>
<P>But discovery was imminent. Ricky Hopper -- a friend of the family -- 
worked in the music business and was so Impressed with Kate's  talents that he
hawked tapes around the record companies but with little success. The A&amp;R
men at this point remained impervious to  Kate's choral charms. </P>
<P>But the Bush break was near at hand. And the waver of the wand  that set the
wheels in motion was none other than David Gilmour,  whose two most notable
attributes were firstly that he was a member  of Pink Floyd, and secondly due to
his connections with aforementioned  band he was extremely rich.</P>
<P>Due to this latter fact Gilmour put up the readies which enabled Kate to  go
into the studios and record a demo tape. With a little encouragement  from Mr G
EMI were persuaded to put Kate under contract.</P>
<P>With &pound;3,000 in the bank (courtesy of EMl) Kate spent the next two 
years under wraps, perfecting her pitch and piano technique, writing  songs and
generally preparing for her recording debut.</P>
<P>&quot;I remember I'd spend hours locked away in this little room with  my
piano, screeching my head off,&quot; she recalled &quot;In fact,&quot;  she
added as an afterthought, &quot;I must have driven my family  bonkers. &quot;</P>
<P><STRONG>Haunting</STRONG></P>
<P>At last the time was right. Kate went into the studio and commenced  work on
her debut album 'The Kick Inside' which was released to  several less than
favourable reviews at the beginning of '78.</P>
<P>The fact that the album still succeeded in making the top five was  largely
due to the huge success of her wavering &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot; single: a
high-pitched, haunting song based on the  book of the same name (surprise,
surprise) and which occupied  the number one spot on the singles chart for
several weeks on end.</P>
<P>Kate was now catapulted firmly into the limelight. When her next  single &quot;Man
With The Child In His Eyes&quot; also shot into the  top five, Kate proved that
without a doubt she possessed the Midas  Touch.</P>
<P>Up until the present time Kate has done virtually no live work apart  from
several carefully choreographed television appearances both  here and abroad.</P>
<P><STRONG>No Pressure</STRONG></P>
<P>With her latest album release 'Lionheart' currently enjoying chart  success,
now seems the ideal time to tour. Although Bush has  admitted apprehension at
the prospect of playing to a captive  audience she also regards it as an
important part of being a  true artist.</P>
<P>&quot;There's no pressure on me to tour,&quot; she explained,  &quot;I've
been told that the records will sell regardless. But I  do feel that I owe
people a chance to see me in the flesh --  (figuratively speaking). It's the
only opportunity they have  without media obstruction.&quot;</P>
<P>When Bush does embark on her first major tour -- apparently  very soon now
-- she plans to do more than just sing.</P>
<P>Having studied mime with Lindsey Kemp after seeing him in  the revue
'Flowers', Kate intends to incorporate movement  with her music, ie in each song
she will not only sing but  express herself physically as well.</P>
<P>Ms Bush singing and performiing her songs will either be (a)  very
entertaining or ((b)) highly embarrassing. Either way the  result should at the
very least be interesting.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sex Symbol</STRONG></P>
<P>With her meteoric rise to fame and fortune has come problems  aplenty for
her record company. She is (luckily for EMI) highly  identifiable, but any
attempts to promote her as a sex symbol  have been politely foiled by Kate
herself who keeps a careful  eye on all her company's publicity campaigns. She
is it seems,  determined to succeed on her musical merits alone although  she
admits that some photos and posters of herself do have an  erotic appeal.</P>
<P>&quot;That's a very obvious image,&quot; she explained. &quot;I  suppose
some pictures of me are reasonably sexy but I think  the true vibe from my face
is there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm anxious to avoid being projected as a sex symbol  because it
distracts from my music.&quot;</P>
<P>Despite her protestations, Bush is undeniably beautiful. Even  if she
doesn't enjoy being a female with a flawless face and figure it's very obvious
that her army of male followers do, as  sackfuls of fan mail bear testament to.</P>
<P>The fact that people actually bother to write to her never ceases  to amaze
Kate. In fact any compliment she ever receives about  her work is invariably met
with ecstatic, almost childlike, delight.</P>
<P><STRONG>Enigma</STRONG></P>
<P>We know that Kate is a vegetarian. That she loves cats, chocolate,  David
Bowie and Steely Dan. That she is very rich -- to the point of  giving cars as
presents and tacking a studio onto her doctor daddy's  house.</P>
<P>But as a person she remains an enigma. The word most often used  to describe
her is invariably &quot;nice&quot; and many a frustrated  journalist has tried
(and failed) to penetrate her friendly, poised,  polite exterior and expose a
few personality pimples lurking beneath  the flawless flesh. Seemingly she has
none. She is kind, considerate  and always good natured. She naturally admits to
some faults but other  people never get to see them.</P>
<P>Whether you love her or loathe her (there's no in-between) the talented, 
individual that is Kate Bush is most undoubtedly for real. A certified,  genuine
person.</P>
