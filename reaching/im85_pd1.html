<BR> Subject: Interview 2 CBAK 4011 (Australian Interviewer), HoL 
</P>
<P>Interview #2; 1985, concerning &quot;Hounds of Love.&quot; Transcribed by
Jeff Burka from  limited edition CD picture interview disc CBAK 4011 on the
Baktabak label.  Proofread by Stephen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>Interview takes approx. 20 mins. 
</P>
<P>The interview was recorded in what sounds like a large room, based upon the 
echoes. The interviewer appears on the left track with Kate on the right. The 
interviewer is Australian, but he is never named. 
</P>
<P>K = Kate. 
</P>
<P>I = Interviewer. 
</P>
<P>Comments in [] mady by transcriber 
</P>
<P>Comments in &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; made by proofreader 
</P>
<P>I: When you launched the album, you had a laser show at the London
planeterium  (giggle) 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. (laughing) Were you there? 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, I was. Why did you do that? 
</P>
<P>K: That was actually an idea of the record company's. They wanted to launch
the  album, which I was into, and I think it was their idea to use the laserium
so that  it would be something special. I thought what the guy did was
incredibly  impressive. I actually didn't realize that lasers could do quite so
many different  things. 
</P>
<P>I: So you were in agreement with it. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, it seemed like a good idea (laugh). 
</P>
<P>I: Is &quot;The Hounds of Love&quot; [sic] your new album, is that an
exorcism for you? Or  not? 
</P>
<P>K: An exorcism. In what way? 
</P>
<P>I: Well, in the way of getting something out of your system. 
</P>
<P>K: I think every album is. Every song, in a way, is channeling or releasing
a form of  energy. Yes, so every song is, really. 
</P>
<P>I: But having done it now, do you feel content, as it were? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I was very pleased when that album was finished. It took a long time
and a  lot of work, and I think, for what we were trying to do, it's quite
pleasing. Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Why is it split into two sections, like &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; and &quot;The
Hounds of Love&quot;  [sic]? 
</P>
<P>K: One of the first ideas I had was to try a concept. I've, for some time,
wanted to  play with a piece of music that was more involved than, say, three to
five minutes.  And I had the idea a good few years ago, but I never really put
it into action, so it  was really the concept side that came first. And I was a
bit worried that it  wouldn't work, so until I'd written, say, four or five
songs, I wouldn't really  know if it was going to be successful. So, I thought
it was wise to just use one  side of the album, so there'd be like half an hour
to play with rather than going  for an hour's worth. And the other side, I
thought it would be nice to balance  with five or six completely different
songs, not linked in anyway, that were  perhaps more positive and up-tempo, so
there was a nice balance between the  two sides. 
</P>
<P>I: Right. In Australian surfer mythology, it's always the seventh wave
that's the big  one. Y'know, like waves come in groups of seven. Why the ninth
wave? 
</P>
<P>K: That's very interesting. &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;--I needed a title for
the side. A lot of  people think that the whole side was actually inspired by a
Tennyson poem, but it  was actually finding this quote, um, looking for a title
for the whole thing; it was  the last piece in the jigsaw. I was just looking
through books and quotes, anything  I could just to get an idea for a title, and
that particular quote from the poem  seemed quite appropriate, and his idea was
that they worked in nines, rather than  sevens. (laughs) 
</P>
<P>I: When you write, do the words or the lyrics come first--uh the words or
the  music--come first? 
</P>
<P>K: It's different with each song. And sometimes you actually get a piece of
music in  your head that's got words with it--it's like they just sort of go
together. But  generally I'd say the music comes first, and the lyrics are
worked in around that,  or with it. 
</P>
<P>I: &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; the current single, which is--where is it in
the UK? 
</P>
<P>K: Uh, twenty. 
</P>
<P>I: Right. &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and things like that--would you go
onto that? 
</P>
<P>K: It's something you consider, I mean, it's really the choice of can you
perform it  well, and would it really help the record. I mean, you do; it does
help to have a  successful record, it helps the album and it helps future
projects, to finance them,  et cetera. I mean, I do depend on the success of
each record to be able to do the  next one. But I think with some songs it's
very difficult to perform them on  television and make them look good and to
really do justice to, performing. I  think it's something there should always be
a lot of thought behind. And, when  you put such a lot of workin to a video,
which a lot of people do nowadays, it's  sad that you can't get that shown more,
and that you have to go on and perform.  There is no choice; it's a shame. 
</P>
<P>I: &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; has a got a very grand video, I think. How did
you come by Donald  Sutherland? 
</P>
<P>K: We were very lucky. We had a friend who made the contact for us. We sent
him  the script and I talked to him and he was very interested, which was
fantastic  [kind of giggling-with a hint of awe or &quot;what incredible luck!&quot;
(various  interpretations of her tone of voice], and just happened to have the
four days that  we needed to shoot the video in. He was free for that time. It
all seemed to come  together so well and so quickly. 
</P>
<P>I: But why Donald Sutherland? 
</P>
<P>K: He was our first choice. I'm a big fan of him as an actor. And he really
was  perfect for the part. There couldn't have been anyone better--he looked so
right. 
</P>
<P>I: Why is it about a father and son--why write &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: I found a book, nearly ten years ago now, on a shelf. I didn't know
anything  about the writer. I just pulled it off the shelf, it looked
interesting, and it was an  incredible story. It's written by Peter Reich, and
it's called A Book of Dreams.  It's about himself as a child, through his eyes
as a child, looking at his father and  their relationship. It's incredibly
beautiful, it's very, very emotive, and very  innocent because it's through a
child's eyes. His father was a very respected  psychoanalyst, and besides this,
something that features in the book, he made  machines called 'cloudbusters'
that could make it rain, and him and his father  used to go out together and
make it rain; they used to go 'cloudbusting.' And,  unfortunately, the peak in
the book is where his father is arrested, taken away  from him; he was
considered a threat. So, suddenly, his father is gone, so it's a  very sad book
as well. 
</P>
<P>I: The machine that features in the video--what's become of that now? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, it's at the moment resting in a garage not far from here. (laughs) 
</P>
<P>I: Do you think that &quot;The Hounds of Love&quot; [sic] is much more
controlled than the  previous album? 
</P>
<P>K: Controlled. (pensive) I think it's probably more constant. The last album
was  dealing with a lot of very different things, and very different places,
different  atmospheres, in tracks maybe next to each other. I think there's more
a sense of  a theme on this album. Obviously on the second side, but even on the
first side,  although they're separate songs, I think they are still, they have
a flavor that's  consistent. 
</P>
<P>I: So you'd say it was more consistent than the previous album? (you idiot!
She just  said that!) 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think there's more sense of flow from track to track. But I was
very happy  with the last album, it was certainly a mark for us. 
</P>
<P>I: Are there any things that you've done so far which you look back on and
you  cringe at? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, lots of things. (laughs) 
</P>
<P>I: Like? 
</P>
<P>K: Too many to mention, and I think most people do tend to look at
themselves very  critically &lt;&lt;Oh, well evaded!&gt;&gt;. I think it's quite
productive to be like that, though,  or perhaps you don't feel nervous enough
about what you're doing next! 
</P>
<P>I: Are you a perfectionist, then? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know if that's a word that is a real word, if you know what I
mean,  because you can never make anything perfect. You can strive for it, but I
think if  you continue to strive for it you would never get anywhere. I think
you have to  recognize a point where things are as good as they can be, within
the limitations,  before they start going off again. It's definitely a peak and
then it can go off. So I  think you just hopefully have to recognize where more
effort will make it better,  but when to stop. 
</P>
<P>I: Who do you use as your person to tell you when to stop, or is it just
something you  know within yourself? 
</P>
<P>K: It's almost like the music itself dictates it. When a track is sounding
right, when  it's ready, it is, you can just feel it. And then you mix it.
That's when you sort of  play with all the little raw edges, but you just know
when everything's finished  recording. 
</P>
<P>I: With &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; the last single that's here in
Britain and is just  happening in Australia--you mention the line &quot;I could
make a deal with God.&quot;  What do you mean by that? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, it's about a relationship between a man and a woman. They love each
other  very much, and the power of the relationship is something that gets in
the way. It  creates insecurities. It's saying if the man could be the woman and
the woman  the man, if they could make a deal with God, to change places, that
they'd  understand what it's like to be the other person and perhaps it would
clear up  misunderstandings. You know, all the little problems; there would be
no problem. 
</P>
<P>I: A perfect world, then. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. Idealistic. But then I think a lot of art is that. It's not
necessarily real always. 
</P>
<P>I: How do you feel about being, shall we say, marketed like in the pop music
world,  when it seems like you obviously put a lot more care into things than
your  average three minute pop song person? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know if I feel like I'm marketed. I think you make an album and
the  outlets for it--there are no other outlets for it, really. A lot of things
go into that  chart that are very diverse. It's a very versatile chart, and more
so than the name  suggests, really. 
</P>
<P>I: With &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; it's all about a man drowning. Was that,
perhaps,  inspired by the aircraft that crashed into the, uh, into a frozen
river in the States.  There was quite a big news story about that a few years
ago. Do you remember  that? There was the case of the man--they called him &quot;the
man in the  water&quot;--who kept on going back and dragging people out from
underneath the  ice. 
</P>
<P>K: No, I didn't hear about that. It sounds really interesting and horrific. 
</P>
<P>I: I just thought that might... 
</P>
<P>K: (interupting) A plane went under the ice? 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, no, a plane actually crashed and hit a bridge over the road and all
the people  were spilled into the water and there was one particular man that
they had TV  film of; he just kept going backwards and forwards and dragging
people out, and  eventually he didn't come out. He was like, what they called &quot;the
man in the  water.&quot; I just wondered if that was... 
</P>
<P>K: (interupting again) Incredible. 
</P>
<P>I: ...at all inspiring. 
</P>
<P>K: No. 
</P>
<P>I: You hadn't known that all before? (laughing, along with Kate) Well, there
goes  that! Okay, then, why then all the ninth wave and water and ice. 
</P>
<P>K: I think it was an idea I probably got a few years ago of someone being in
the  water for the night, and hadn't really tried it until this album. It's hard
to say  where it came from. I can only pinpoint certain war films as imagery
that would  suggest it, things like The Cruel Sea, those kind of old war films,
where the  people were being cast into the water, having really been through
kind of a  heavy experience already. And the thing of actually launching from
that, so that's  the basis of the body in the water, but then the head travels
off as the night goes  on. 
</P>
<P>I: Would you contemplate turning that into some kind of visual images? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it's something I will seriously be thinking about. But it's the
feasibility of it,  especially in terms of time and money. So I don't know. When
all the promotion  is at an end, by the end of this year, I'll be able to sit
down and think what's the  next thing to do. 
</P>
<P>I: You don't think that making a video image of it will perhaps spoil
people's own  idea of what they've got of it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think it probably could! (laughing) 
</P>
<P>I: Have you got people in mind to do that? 
</P>
<P>K: No, that's really why I need to have space to think about it. All this
promotion  has to be done; I have to have all the videos made before I can think
about it. You  really need to direct attention into something like that. 
</P>
<P>I: There's lots of credits on the album to comic characters and people
involved in  comedy. Why them? 
</P>
<P>K: Because in some way they've been involved or helped, either with the
album or  something connected to it, and it was a way of saying thank you. &lt;&lt;deliberately
 uninformative?&gt;&gt; 
</P>
<P>I: They didn't all come and give you handclaps and all that. (laughs) 
</P>
<P>K: (laughing) No, I'm afraid not. I wish they had! 
</P>
<P>I: You had success at an early age. Do you feel you've missed out on
anything? 
</P>
<P>K: No I don't, really, I'm glad that it happened so early, because it's
enabled me to  be able to do what I'm doing now. For instance, being able to
build our own  studio, and having had that much more experience behind me
because I started  younger. No, I think I'm very lucky. 
</P>
<P>I: Having built your own studio, are you like a gadget freak? Do you like
all the  latest toys, electronic toys, or not? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think everyone likes new toys. And it's really getting the time to
look  around, and also the money, of course, is the big thing, to get new
equipment. 
</P>
<P>I: &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot;--have you got a protective family? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's quite a natural instinct for families to be protective. 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, but what about you? 
</P>
<P>K: I think they're of the norm. I think they're as all protective of each
other. 
</P>
<P>I: Was that song written for your mother? 
</P>
<P>K: No, not at all. I mean, she's a wonderful mother, but the song's dealing
with a  different energy, really. I mean it's about a mother and her strong
maternal,  protective instincts, but it's dealing with some--a son who's
committed a bad  crime. And to her, her instincts overrule what's right or
wrong. I think that's  what's interesting--it's how some mothers will actually
overrule their sense of  morality because they love their son or their child so
much. 
</P>
<P>I: Have you ever been in a similar kind of situation, where a reason goes
out the  window? 
</P>
<P>K: No, certainly not on that level! But I have read reports, heard of
things--through  news, etc.-- in the past, where that has happened. 
</P>
<P>I: Do songs come easily to you, or not? 
</P>
<P>K: No. Some do, but the majority is something I have to work for very hard.
It's  extremely frustrating, but it's worth it to get something in the end.
Something I  got hooked on really quite young. Just playing with the piano and
the whole  excitement of actually creating something out of nothing. 
</P>
<P>I: Reading the press that's come out recently, it's mentioned again your
love of  people like Roxy Music and David Bowie. Are there any more contemporary
 people that you like? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't listen to very much contemporary music at the moment, and I think
my  love of people like David Bowie and Bryan Ferry --I was normally making the 
point of what a big influence those two have been. They're true originals, and 
there are so many people mimicking their style of voice, they're style of song 
structures, etcetera, and I think they should be credited for their influences.
I  think Peter Gabriel's had a very big influence, too, on a lot of people. His
third  album was very influential, I think. 
</P>
<P>I: He's got a new one coming out. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes! 
</P>
<P>I: Have you heard any of it? 
</P>
<P>K: No, I haven't. 
</P>
<P>I: I've heard a couple of tracks; very good. 
</P>
<P>K: Great. 
</P>
<P>[I find this exchange interesting for the fact that since this interview was
in '85, the  album in question is So, which, of course, contains &quot;Don't
Give Up,&quot; a duet with  Kate herself!] 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, it's excellent. When you're not presenting a public eye, you're like
a very  private person. Nobody can seem to get through to you, as it were. Do
you feel  the need to have a certain amount of isolation? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Is that essential to your creative feelings? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, absolutely. They're two very separate things, two completely
different  energies, and I can only really concentrate if that's all I have to
do. If there's  other things to do besides make an album, they just become
distractions. 
</P>
<P>I: You talk about energies quite a lot. Do you subscribe to a particular
theory or  religion or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>K: (laughing) Subscribe to a monthly manual. 
</P>
<P>I: You know what I mean. 
</P>
<P>K: No, I don't, really. But I do think certain things help, like I think
trying to be  positive about things is a very helpful thing. It can just stop
you getting down, and  to try and enjoy things if you can. But I don't have any
kind of religious beliefs,  really. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you have a favorite song that you've recorded? 
</P>
<P>K: It's very much a love/hate relationship I think any author has with the
thing. But  there are ones that you're always quite glad you managed to achieve,
especially  when they were difficult. I was quite pleased with &quot;Houdini&quot;
and &quot;Breathing&quot; and  &quot;Running Up That Hill.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I: Do you ever feel that you're going to run out of creative energy? 
</P>
<P>K: I think if you feel that you have to take a break and I think quite often
it's like a  battery that needs charging up. As long as you keep the energy
topped up, you  should be able to keep going. 
</P>
<P>I: If somebody asks you to do a benefit concert, or if you'd been asked to
do Live  Aid, would you have done that? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I would. I don't think there's anyone that would have said no,
unless they  had to. A really important reason. 
</P>
<P>I: Even though you hadn't actually performed live for a long, long time, you
would  have still done it? 
</P>
<P>K: It's hard to say. I wasn't asked, but I would have said yes, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>I: Okay. I think that's about it. Oh! One more thing. Do you follow world
affairs,  with what's going on? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't follow it very--I can't think of the word! What's the word?
Ooooooh!  Ohhh! &lt;&lt;doesn't transcribe well, does it? It sounds more like a
strained  &quot;uhhhhhh!&quot; to me!&gt;&gt; 
</P>
<P>I: Avidly? 
</P>
<P>K: Avidly is quite good. Yeah, I don't really have that much time. I watch
the  television; I catch the news. That's really all I get--I don't read 
newspapers--watch current affair programs. 
</P>
<P>I: OK, good, thank you. 
</P>
<P>[a day later:] 
</P>
<P>A correction of my own. 
</P>
<P>In the interview I transcribed (&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; from the Baktabak
CD 4011), I  wrote that the interviewer is unknown, but is australian. 
</P>
<P>I've since learned that it is a man named Robert Brown...
