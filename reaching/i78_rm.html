<P>Kate's Fairy Tale 
</P>
<P>&lt;The following interview by Mary Ann Ellis appeared in &quot;Record
Mirror&quot;  magazine in February 1978. It is one of the earliest pieces ever
written about Kate  Bush. In it Kate makes several statements which she will
later amend or repudiate  altogether, and she has not yet trained herself to
exclude all negative feelings and  opinions from her conversation. Edited by
Andrew Marvick.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Little girl lost in the huge plush armchair, tiny and bright in day-glo pink
 trousers, red socks, sky-high heels. A puckish, attractive face peeps out from 
beneath masses of shaggy earth-red hair. 
</P>
<P>She's friendly, smiles a lot, even an occasional giggle. Drinks copious
amounts of  tea and insists as she lights another extra-mild that she's trying
to give up smoking.  Little girl expletives like &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;great&quot;
and &quot;golly&quot; punctuate her conversation. 
</P>
<P>Just a little nervous, a shade hesitant. But then she is only nineteen. This
&quot;she&quot; is  Kate Bush, singer/songwriter. She's just released her first
album containing  thirteen self-penned songs including her current hit single,
the quavering, wavering  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Although Kate has been developing a relationship with the piano since she
was a  child, her musical talents were once channeled in another direction. 
</P>
<P>Just after she left school at the age of sixteen she went to see Lindsay
Kemp in a  performance of the mime venue &quot;Flowers&quot;. &quot;I remember
it so well. I thought that if  one person could actually produce the music
themselves and give him- or herself  physically at the same time, then you'd get
double energy coming from one person.  It could only be stronger, and I thought,
'Golly, that's what I want to do.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate trained in mime and modern dance with Lindsay for a short period until
he  went off to Australia. Then she started going to dance classes at The Dance
Centre  in London's Covent Garden. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I loved that,&quot; she says with real enthusiasm. &quot;It's the only
place you can go and  learn to dance withough qualifications, which I didn't
have. You pay by lesson, and  even though I was sixteen and had never danced
before, I did make great progress.&quot; 
</P>
<P>At the same time, back at the piano, Kate was still singing and writing
songs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The next bit's real fairy tale stuff. One day, along comes this friend
of my  brother's. He worked in the record business himself, and thought he might
be able  to help me make some contacts. Well, he knew Pink Floyd from Cambridge
and he  asked Dave Gilmour to hear me. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was absolutely terrified at the prospect of meeting him, but he was
so sweet  and kind, so human. Well, I did a few songs for him and he decided
that the best  thing for me to do would be to go into a studio and make a proper
demonstration  tape with arrangements and a producer. Subsequently Dave put up
the money for  me to go into the studios and cut three tracks, two of which are
included on the  album. And it was that tape which got me the EMI contract.&quot;

</P>
<P>&lt;If this is indeed all that Kate said, it's interesting that she
deliberately simplified  the various stages that led to her signing with EMI
(see chronology).&gt; 
</P>
<P>She stops and gestures vaguely. Her eyes light up simultaneously with a
cigarette  as another cup of tea arrives. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That was all two years ago now. Since then I've been singing, playing
and  writing until we made the album last summer. Originally it was to be
released last  autumn but it kept getting delayed. I'm glad we waited till 1978,
though. It kind of  signifies it all starting with the new year for me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That fascinating single; I tell her I like it a lot. She grins. Apparently
Dusty  Springfield likes it a lot, too. Her grin widens into disbelief. &quot;Really?
I'm glad.  That's amazing.&quot; Miles of smile. She twiddles nervously with one
of her dangling  silvery earrings and produces another extra-mild. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I first read &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; I thought the story
was so strong. This  young girl in an era when the female role was so inferior,
and she was coming out  with this passionate, heavy stuff. Great subject-matter
for a song. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I loved writing it. It was a real challenge to precis the whole mood
of a book into  such a short piece of prose. Also, when I was a child I was
always called Cathy, not  Kate, and I just found myself able to relate to her as
a character. It's so important to  put youself in the role of the person in a
song. There's no half measures. When I  sing that song I am Cathy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her face collapses back into smiles. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Gosh, I sound so intense. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is so
important to me. It had to  be the single. To me it was the only one. I had to
fight off a few other people's  opinions, but in the end they agreed with me. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was amazed at the response, though, truly overwhelmed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If you haven't heard the single yet, talk amongst yourselves for a few
minutes  more. Kate's amazing vocals on both it and the album are schizophrenic.
A melange  of low/high, deep/soft, passionate/indifferent notes. Inevitably
people will compare  her to other female vocalists such as Linda Lewis and Joan
Armatrading, who share  similar extremes in their vocal ranges. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, people keep saying this to me,&quot; says Kate thoughtfully. &quot;I
guess I can sing  pretty high.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; apart, the majority of songs on the album can
be categorised  as love songs. &quot;But you're so young, dear.&quot; Not my
comment, but an attitude  guaranteed to make Kate bristle. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm nineteen, but so what? I've had experiences, too. A lot of my
songs are  about my own traumas. The best time for writing is when you're going
though a  heavy time. You have an enormous amount of energy. The best way to
deal with it is  not to bottle it up or take it out on someone else, but to
channel it into your writing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You get ideas for songs from all sorts of situations. I just start
playing the piano  and the chords start telling me something. Lyrics for me just
seem to go with the  tune, very much hand in hand. Some lyrics take a long time
to come, others just  come out like...&quot; She gestures wildly with her hands.
&quot;...like...diarrhoea.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Being nineteen and attractive must make it harder for a woman to succeed in 
rock'n'roll. By succeed I mean to be taken seriously and not just be regarded as
a  sex object/symbol/body. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I want it to stand on the weight of my work, not what I look like. I
realise  people are going to capitalise on it. It annoys me, though. Why should
people want to  know about my sex life? It's completely irrelevant to what I'm
doing. I give them  everything they need to know about me in my songs, because
they are personal  songs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Being regarded as a sex object just gets in the way most of the time
unless it's  relevant to the role I'm playing in the song. Guys get it, of
course, but only those  that seem to ask for it. Girls seem to get it whether
they want to be regarded in that  way or not. To overplay it is wrong. It can't
possibly last.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate has just returned from recording a show in Germany. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A fascinating experience,&quot; she enthuses, tweaking an earring.
Nervous habits die  hard. &quot;The show was filmed in Cologne--a great place.
The actual studio was an old  tram shed with an enormous stage. I did two songs.
One with my newly formed  band and the other I mimed to backing tapes. For &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; we had  backdrops which helped to set the scene. All these black
rolling hills with lightning  bolts painted in, and in the middle of it all this
dirty great big volcano.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Volcano? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she giggles. &quot;Still, they did their best. Obviously
they're not that familiar  with the scenery on the Yorkshire moors.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The extra-milds make another appearance. The teacup is drained. Suddenly 
there's an explosion of music from the next room. We both jump, then laugh. Then
 silence again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a bit like home. There's always noise and things going on in the
next room  all the time. My parents have been marvellous. They haven't got too
excited about  my success, but they're very pleased for me. You have to remember
they've been  around when I was up in my little room screaming my head off and
plonking away at  the piano. That seems such a long time ago now. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm really not sure how I'm going to develop from now, what direction
my  writing will take.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Any more songs based on books in the offing? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know, it's never occurred to me. I'd like to write another song
 connected to a book if the story was strong enough. It's not important, though.
I just  want to carry on exploring. I like to write music about subjects I
haven't touched  before. That's my favourite thing.&quot;
