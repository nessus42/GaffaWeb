<P>&gt; Last week's edition of the (West) German newsweekly Der Spiegel has a
box  pic of Kate with a few paragraphs commenting on Heads We're Dancing. My 
German wasn't good enough to translate it, and now my friend has taken his 
magazine back. But if anyone wants to find it, the issue has a picture of the
Berlin  stuff on the cover. 
</P>
<P>That would be the 13. November 1989 issue (page 310), the first edition
following  the opening of the borders. 
</P>
<P>Here is a (mostly literal) translation of said blurb: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush, 31 (photo), English pop-singer with a predilection for intricate
music,  apologized as a precaution against possible historical
misunderstandings. On her  latest album &quot;The Sensual World&quot; she sings
in a title &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot; of  dancing through a night in 1939
with Adolf Hitler. Only through a newspaper  photograph in the morning does the
night reveler learn the true identity of her  charmer. Kate Bush on the
unsuspecting dancer: &quot;The woman hereafter believes she  could have
influenced him and might have changed the course of history, had she  recognized
him. Of course there's no reason for her to blame herself. Adolf Hitler  fooled
a lot of people, and I don't believe anyone can blame them for that.&quot; A
friend,  who told of a encounter with a witty and well-read man, provided the
inspiration for  her song; only after the fact did he -- shocked and furious
about the incident --learn  that he had been speaking with J. Robert Oppenheimer
-- the father of the atomic  bomb. &quot;The devil&quot;, sings Kate Bush, &quot;is
a charming man.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(The photo is pretty standard stuff. Black and white, about 2.5 x 4&quot;,
of her sitting  on a typical photographer's set, her legs tucked under and upper
body well posed.  Hair is short, likely tied back. Wearing faded jeans and a
black tank-top. Possibly  barefoot, but cannot really tell.)
