<P>Date: Fri, 22 Mar 91 14:29:58 EST <BR> From: Andrew B Marvick &lt;abm4@cunixa.cc.columbia.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: Interview by James Johnson 1980 
</P>
<P>IED unfortunately cannot identify the publication from which the following 
interview originates--it appeared in issue 12 of CKI (now known as Never Forever
),  the Welsh Kate Bush fanzine. Edited by Andrew Marvick. 
</P>
<P> -- James Johnson talks to pop star Kate Bush --
</P>
<P> Music is my life, says 'lucky' Kate 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush would be less than human if she did not sometimes marvel at the 
attention she has received over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>She says: &quot;Sometimes I see myself in the paper and it's hard to
associate with the  name of Kate Bush. She is this well-known person who has
almost become like a  brand name, like Maxwell House coffee or something.
Meanwhile I'm just working  on my music and my life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Somehow she remains an awkward personality to categorize. One newspaper has 
described her as Britain's top pop sexpot while a new, unauthorized hagiography 
about her life opted for the title Suburban Princess. 
</P>
<P>Even now she comes over in person as part pop star and part ordinary girl
from  the South London commuter belt, while her conversation ranges between
traditional  popworld cliches and perceptive comment. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I often think people are looking for something in my life that they
can't find,&quot;  she comments. &quot;A number of performers I suppose came
from working-class  families, or their parents were divorced. Perhaps that gives
them the urge to go out  and struggle for something. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But basically I have always had a normal, very happy life with my
family. I never  went out and beat up old ladies or became an alcoholic at
school.&quot; 
</P>
<P>THEMES 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think the public have become conditioned to want to know who is
sleeping  with who, or how many marriages somebody has had, but as far as I'm
concerned  it's totally irrelevant. I'm really very normal and there is nothing
sensational to  uncover. I wouldn't talk about some private things to my mother,
so why should I to  anybody else?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless one still feels impelled to broach the subject of sex,
especially as  many of her songs seem to incorporate underlying sexual themes. 
</P>
<P>According to Kate: &quot; I think music and love are very similar. They're
both  natural basic energies, they have the same kind of all-embracing freedom,
the  elation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The communication of music is very like making love. If you play a
piano, for  example, you're so united it's really a beautiful thing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now twenty-two years old, the singer has accomplished almost everything the 
popworld has to offer except in the United States as yet. She has performed at
the  Palladium, made frequent appearance in the charts, and been given almost
every  major award available. 
</P>
<P>A new album due out next week &lt; Never For Ever : this interview dates
from  1980--IED&gt; has been held back for three months by EMI, since they
regard it with  such importance &lt;sic&gt; that they did not want its
appearance to clash with their other  major releases this year by Paul McCartney
and the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>BUFFER 
</P>
<P>While she remarks that she has felt more grown up of late, she has always 
appeared untouched by the pressures and difficulties that can accompany fame and
 fortune. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I can see why people do have nervous breakdowns and so on, but it all
depends  on the person rather than what you happen to be doing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes I have felt that I'm losing control and that it's all
running away with  me, but all I have to do then is to say to myself: 'Well
leave, then. Give it all up.'  And I know I never would, because my life is
really music, and I love it so much. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I would like to survive, like people like Cliff Richard or Paul
McCartney. If you  look at them, they're so strong and solid and happy. They'll
be able to go on for as  long again as they have already.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One particular buffer against the outside world would seem to be the Bush 
family. Her father, a former family doctor, and her three brothers &lt;sic: Kate
has only  two brothers, John Carder Bush and Paddy Bush--IED&gt; are involved in
different  levels of her career. 
</P>
<P>One brother, Paddy, plays an assortment of instruments on her new album,
while  Novercia, Ltd., the company that has been formed to look after her
interests, has  five Bush family members as directors. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm lucky to have a family I love who can give me advice when I need
it. I like  to think of myself as director of the force, but I'm not a
businesswoman, for  example, and when it comes to legal jargon I need some help.

</P>
<P>&quot;My parents weren't keen on the giving up of school at the beginning to
go into  singing and dancing, but once they saw I was serious about it, they
gave support. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was quite stubborn about my decision, and in the end they realized
it was for  the best.&quot;
