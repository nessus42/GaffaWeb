-0800 <BR> Subject: Melody Maker Interview by Paul Simper Oct. 16, 1982 
</P>
<P>This is a really good interview! I particularly like what she says about &quot;The
Wall&quot;  and Peter Gabriel and &quot;Night Of The Swallow&quot;! 
</P>
<P>DREAMTIME IS OVER 
</P>
<P>by Paul Simper 
</P>
<P>Melody Maker Oct. 16, 1982 
</P>
<P>[Trans. by Ron Hill] 
</P>
<P> To some people Kate Bush has almost ceased to exist. Usurped on the bedroom
 walls young upstarts like Clare Grogan and Kim Wilde, she is now a much more 
private lady who rarely goes out and seems quite content to concentrate on her 
singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>It's been two years since her last LP, Never For Ever, and though the single
that  followed &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;, reached number 11, the recent
commercial failure of  &quot;The Dreaming&quot; has seen the undertakers
beginning to shuffle and murmur  impatiently. 
</P>
<P>Her new LP, The Dreaming, should keep the vultures at bay however. Drawing 
on far greater depths of emotion and a much wider range of cultural references 
from Australian art to forties B-movies - it is an indication of her coming of
age,  both artistically and professionally. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's the album I'm most happy with that I've completed. I went
through  all the problems and depression during the album and then ended up
feeling quite  pleased with it. In the past it's worked the other way around.&quot;

</P>
<P>In every way it is a much more sharply focused and arresting LP. The cover,
shot  in autumnal shades of brown and gold, shows Kate clasping the head of a
man bound  in chains. In her mouth lies a tiny gold key. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The idea of that image and the phrase on the back of the album, 'with
a kiss  I'd pass the key', is very much connected to the song &quot;Houdini.&quot;
That song is taken  from Mrs. Houdini's point of view because she spent a lot of
time working with him  and helping with his tricks. One of the ways she would
help was to give him a  parting kiss, just as he was off into his watertank or
whatever, and as she kissed him  she'd pass a tiny little key which he would
then use later to unlock the padlocks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I thought it was both a very romantic and a very sad image because, by
passing  that key, she is keeping him alive - she's actually giving him the key
back into life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The LP differs greatly in presentation to the fairytale ghouls and ghastlies
of  Never For Ever. What was the starting point this time? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The last album was very much the starting point for this one. Perhaps
the art  work and some of the idea of Never For Ever were misconstrued because
although  they are very fairytale; on the cover they are meant to depict
positive and negative  emotions that are very much a part of human beings -
that's really what a lot of my  songs are about.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Was the title track the actual cornerstone of the LP? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. The thing about all my album titles is that they're usually one of
the last  things to be thought of because it's so difficult just to find a few
words to sum the  whole thing up. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've got this book which is all about Aborigines and Australian art
and it's called  The Dreaming. The song was originally called 'Dreamtime', but
when we found out  that the other word for it was 'The Dreaming' it was so
beautiful - just by putting  'the' in front of 'dreaming' made something very
different - and so I used that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It also seems to sum up a lot of the songs because one of the main
points about  that time for the Aborigines was that it was very religious and
humans and animals  were very closely connected. Humans were actually living in
animal's bodies and  that's an idea which I particularly like playing with.&quot;

</P>
<P>Have you ever been to Australia? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but not recently. I have contact with a few Australians and it
seems that at  the moment Aboriginal art is becoming very fashionable so the
young Australians  are starting to take a lot more serious notice of what's
happening to them. Also,  happily, the Aborigines seem to be growing in number
again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Dreaming is an LP that mutates at an alarming rate. One minute you're 
playing walkabout in the outback, the next it's Vietnam and you're fighting for 
your life. But through the images are diverse and at times oblique, the sound - 
principally driven by menacing, pounding drums - is more consistent. It
certainly  owes much to Peter Gabriel's third LP which housed such resounding
nightmares as  &quot;Biko&quot; and &quot;No Self Control&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd been trying to get some kind of tribal drum sound together for a
couple of  albums, especially the last one. But really the problem was that I
was trying to work  with a pop medium and get something out of it that wasn't
part of that set-up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Seeing Peter working in the Town House Studio, especially with the
engineers  he had, it was the nearest thing I'd heard to real guts for a long
long time. I mean,  I'm not into rhythm boxes - they're very useful to write
with but I don't think  they're good sounds for a finished record - and that was
what was so exciting  because the drums had so much power.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Another influence you're quoted before is Pink Floyd's The Wall, did you see
 the film? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I've been very much influenced by The Wall because I like the way
that  the Floyd get right into that emotional area and work with sounds as
pictures. I  think the problem with the film though is that, although as a piece
of art it is  devastating, it isn't real enough. The whole film is negatively
based. No once during  Pink's life is there a moment of happiness which I know
in every human's life  there is. Even if you have the shittiest life of all
there is always one little moment  where you smile for a second or you fall in
love with someone and feel happy -  maybe only for ten minutes. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In The Wall there is no compassion and no objectivity at all and I
actually think  that certain areas of that are destructive.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Although you've often written romantic songs - &quot;Babooshka&quot;, &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot;, &quot;The Wedding List&quot; [romantic??] - they've never been
happy  boy-meets-girl-and-lives-happily-ever-after affairs. Is that because of
some private  perversity? 
</P>
<P>&quot;For me that's how real situations are? Whenever I've experienced a 
relationship, or the people around me have, it's always ended up being
incredibly  complicated because that's the way human beings are. Nothing is
simple, it always  ends up being something else or dying and that's what I find
so interesting - the  drive behind human beings and the way they get screwed up.&quot;

</P>
<P>Like &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The idea with that song is that the house is actually a human being
who's been  hurt and he's just locking all the doors and not letting anyone in.
The person is so  determined not to let anyone in that one of his personalities
is a concierge who sits in  the door, and says 'you're not coming in here' -
like real mamma.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Listening to The Dreaming and Never For Ever the night before my interview 
with Kate the two LPs gradually revealed many lyrical similarities - the
anti-war  theme of &quot;Breathing&quot; and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, which is
continued on &quot;Pull Out The  Pin&quot;, for instance. One track, though,
left me utterly bewildered - &quot;Suspended In  Gaffa&quot;... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Lyrically it's not really that dissimilar from &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;
in saying that you  really want to work for something. It's playing with the
idea of hell. At school I was  always taught that if you went to hell you would
see a glimpse of God and that was it  - you never saw him again and you'd spend
the rest of eternity pining to see him. In  a way it was even worse if you went
to purgatory because you got the glimpse of  God and you would see him again
[??? but you] didn't know when. So it was almost  like you had to sit here until
he decided to com back. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose for me in my work, because it's such a sped up life and so
much  happens to you and you analyse yourself a lot, you see the potential for
perhaps  getting to somewhere very special on an artistic or a spiritual level
and that excites  me a lot. And it's the idea of working towards that and
perhaps one day, when  you're ready for that change, it's like entering a
different level of existence, where  everything goes slow-mo... it's almost like
a religious experience. That's basically  what the song's about.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you very religious or do you simply have a strong belief in yourself? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I very much believe in the forces and energies that humans and
other  things which are alive can create. I do feel that what you give out
sincerely then  karmically you should get it back.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Time seems to have changed your thirst for knowledge. While in &quot;Rolling
The  Ball&quot; [sic - &quot;Them Heavy People] you were overbrimming with the
joys of gathering  wisdom, on a track like &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; you
appear a lot more impatient - &quot;I want  to be a lawyer. I want to be a
scholar./But I really Can't be bothered, ooh  just/Gimme it quick...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's also about the way you try to work for something and you
end up  finding you've been working away from it rather than towards it. It's
really about  the whole frustration of having to wait for things - the fact that
you can't do what  you want to do now, you have to work toward it and maybe,
only maybe, in five years  you'll get what you're after. 
</P>
<P>&quot;For me there are so many things I do which I don't want to - the
mechanics of  the industry - but I hope that through them I can get what I
really want. You have to  realise that, say, you can't just be an artist and not
promote. If you're not a salesman  for your work the likelihood is that people
won't realise that it's there and  eventually you'll stop yourself from being
able to make something else. There's no  doubt about it that every album I make
is really dependant on the money I made  from the last one.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you do a lot of reading? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, not really, because I just don't get the time. But whenever I do
it really  sparks things off in me. The last book I read was The Shining and it
just blew me  away, it was absolutely brilliant, and that definitely inspired &quot;Get
Out Of My House&quot;  because the atmosphere of the book is so strong.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Apart from the use of sound to conjure up very simple images you've also
used  list of names, like Minnie, Moony, Vicious, Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny on &quot;Blow
 Away&quot; and Bogart, Raft and Cagney on &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;. Are
they people  you particularly admire or do you just like the strong images they
create? 
</P>
<P>&quot;They are people I like. For me, Cagney is one of the greatest actors
that has ever  been. I just couldn't believe his acting in White Heat. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He's always played the boy who grew up in a hard time and in a way he
was  only ever bad because of the things that had influenced him. He comes
across as a  very human person who had the potential to do something great but
was always  misled.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;In that song the idea is that everyone's amateur robbers...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Like the old Ealing comedies? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, that's right. So it's like maybe they get a bit cocky... I
dunno, I've never  done a robbery, but I think that in a situation like that
you'd almost try to be like  the person you admire so perhaps they'd be like
Cagney and George Raft. They  idea was nothing like deep - it was just handy!
The real challenge of that song was  to make it a story but also keep it like a
Thirties tune.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A couple of the songs on The Dreaming seem to draw heavily from film noir.  &quot;Night
of the Swallow&quot;, the female is straight out of the awesome Barbara Stanwyck
 mould of Double Indemnity. She's a domineering, passionate woman who not only 
doesn't want her lover to risk his life trafficking refuges because of the
danger to  him, but because she wants him. At the end he pleads - &quot;Would
you break even my  wings/Just like a swallow/Let me, let me go...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, unfortunately a lot of men do begin to feel very trapped in their
 relationships and I think, in some situations, it is because the female is so
scared,  perhaps of her insecurity, that she needs to hang onto him completely.
In this song  she wants to control him and because he wants to do something that
she doesn't  want him to she feels that he is going away. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's almost on a parallel with the mother and son relationship where
there is the  same female feeling of not wanting the young child to move away
from the nest. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course, from the guys point of view, because she doesn't want him
to go, the  urge to go is even stronger. For him, it's not so much a job as a
challenge; a chance  to do something risky and exciting. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But although that woman's very much a stereotype I think she still
exists today.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Often your female characters do seem larger then life - even you on stage
appear  larger, more dominant. Is that simply for dramatic effect? 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is certainly that element in my performance. From a writing
point of  view I think you are talking about something that is very real-based
but someone to  make it more interesting you have to exaggerate it a little bit.

</P>
<P>&quot;It's like people who tell stories, really the people who tell good
stories are the  ones who kept the truth in essence but they exaggerate on all
the little areas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sounds like my mum.
