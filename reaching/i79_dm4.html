<P><STRONG>Wow! What a great year<BR> Kate is voted top girl singer again</STRONG></P>
<P>SHE'S done it again! Slinky singer Kate Bush is obviously delighted after
being voted top female singer in a nationwide poll.</P>
<P>And who could keep a straight face anyway, standing next to the man with the
mischievous smile -- Monty Python's Michael Palin.</P>
<P>The shrill-voiced doctor's daughter, whose songs &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
 and &quot;Wow!&quot; topped the charts,  received her Melody Maker Readers'
Poll  award from him in London yesterday.</P>
<P>Kate, who is 20, won the title for the second successive year. And she said:
'Wow! Thank you, it's a very great honour.'</P>
<P>Michael Palin also presented an award to singer Bob Geldof of the Boomtown
Rats for the group's  controversial record &quot;I Don't Like Mondays,&quot;
which has sold two million copies around the world.</P>
<P>The record, voted the best single of 1979, was based on the case of a
teenage girl in California, who said she shot and killed two people at school
because 'she didn't like Mondays'. </P>
<P>Led Zeppelin, one of Britain's long established bands, took seven of the
poll's 20 awards.</P>
