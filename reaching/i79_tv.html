                  LONDON'S FAMOUS PALLADIUM RECENTLY FELL<br>
                          TO AN UNRELENTING ATTACK OF<br>
                        KATE BUSH'S HAUNTING THEATRICS
</h3>
    
KATE BUSH packed London's Palladium with 2000
fans and proved to the cynical critics that not only is
she an individualistic singer but an accomplished
entertainer as well.

It was a Kate Bush that no one had ever seen before.

The 20-year-old, whose weird sound made her Britain's
top female pop star almost overnight and earned her
international acclaim, gave one of the most enthralling
shows ever seen in London, putting to shame other rock
stars who rely on electronic wizardry or just pure volume
to win over audiences.

The intricately-planned show was the product of six
months' intensive preparation. Kate rehearsed up to
12 hours a dday with 15 members of the band, back-up
singers and dancers.

To a fanfare of publicity, she exploded into London as
the most theatrical new singing star in years.
    
    She took over the stage, in fact 
    the whole Palladium, with her first 
    assured step - a waif-like, elfin 
    figure in tight satin jeans.
    
    Her voice pierced the 
    auditorium with the bewitching 
    quality of the wind shrieking 
    across Wuthering Heights. 
    
    Like Liza Minnelli, Kate relied 
    not so much on her voice, which 
    sometimes is quite thin and 
    superficial, but on the drama with 
    which she stages her evocative 
    songs.
    
    Magicians performed balancing 
    tricks on stage, and violinists, 
    dressed like black jesters, pranced 
    in the background as she switched 
    from seductress in blue jeans to 
    gypsy in a scarlet skirt in a 
    completely hypnotic theatrical 
    ritual:
    
    It was an acrobatic, 
    effervcscent, melodramatic and 
    sometimes macabre 
    perforrnance -- a 2 1/2-hour spectacle
    of back projection sets, 
    lighting and theatrical effects 
    costing $300.000[*] -- which was 
    shared by Kate and record 
    company, EMI.
    
<p>    She left no doubt that 
    theatrically, she could develop 
    into the superstar class.</p>
    
<p>    It is an amazing. feat, 
    considering that the world only 
    first knew of her just 16 months 
    ago when she became a household 
    name, courtesy of &quot;Wutheriug 
    Heights,&quot; her first single. The song 
    she wrote was inspired by Emily 
    Bronte's romantic novel of the same 
    name, and she sang it in a voice not 
    unlike that of a newly-neutered cat 
    letting the world know of its 
    unfortunate predicament. </p>
