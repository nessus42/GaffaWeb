<P>KATE BUSH: 'Never For Ever' (EMI EMA  794)</P>
<P>You don't have to be a neurotic, well-to-do airy-fairy dreamer to like Kate
Bush but it probably helps.</P>
<P>The rise and rise of Bush is fascinating. The  yelping foot in the door of
'Wuthering Heights' was vital. Without the audience that neo-romantic opus
garnered the music of Bush would be fairly and squarly up a commercial gum tree.
With one hit Bush became an airplay name and thus began carving her own niche,
or digging the rut  depending on your receptiveness. And therein lies the crux
of the matter. Mass blasting is imperative to Bush's richly constructed,
multi-layered art.</P>
<P>Nothing here or in the past has been as utterly immediate as that short
sharp shock of a first hit single, but, with the radio overkill that all her
singles attract, Bush has become another opiate that your ears can't fail to be
lured by. I for one would put forward the case that since that single Bush and
her popularity have been on the wane.</P>
<P>Oh, I know she's still front cover type material (less sincere chaps might
say only through the  size of her buttocks and mammaries, but I won't) and I
know 'Never For Ever' will once again be  clung to a nation's collective bosoms,
but really the formula does grate so that I'd stop somewhat  short of describing
the girl as a brave new force in the world of popular music. Certainly, if I
were  a big wig in EMI I'd be looking to spread my Bush operation Stateside
(Japan due to the dynamic  visuals is a foregone territorial conquest
conclusion) and yet, with meandering class like hers, I'd have my grave doubts.</P>
<P>By no stretch of the imagination could one describe Bush and her music as
inspiring. 'Never For Ever' in fact is as depressing an album as one might find
all year. Superficially, the music is, with the  exception of 'Babooshka' and
the sporadic hook,  meanderingly unattractive. On initial earfuls  'Never For
Ever' sounds like one of the most empty, dull packets of poop one could ever
hope to avoid. Take it down the road apiece and one can appreciate that the
depth of playing is beyond reproach.</P>
<P>Wheras the musical decor grows in stature with each spin the lyrics and
vocals, despite some of the  laurels the girl has been granted in these spheres,
are overblown. Bush's writing is quaint only for the fact that it sounds like it
has surfaced from a bygone age. &quot;Delius (Song of Summer)&quot; for example
is so much mental masturbation. Over clicking drum machinations, waterfalls of
pianos, layers of delicate percusssion and angelic twitterings,  Kate offers &quot;Ooh
he's a moody old man/Song of summer in his hand/Oooh he's a moody old man/In his
hand/Hmm.&quot; Whoop de doo! Next...</P>
<P>'Blow Away' again meanders, it being the story of how musicians have
something to look forward to  in death as they can get together with &quot;Minnie,
Moony, Vicious, Vicious, Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny.&quot; Dubious my dear,
dubious. 'All We Ever Look For' is a filch from Isao Tomita's Interpretation of
Mussorgsky's 'Pictures At An Exhibition', while 'Egypt' finds  Bush screaming
Banshee-like over a typical sahara  sand-storm band TV documantary backing.</P>
<P>'The Wedding List' is perhaps the most 'up' moment  on the album. Leastways
it's as 'up' as a track about a love triangle death tale can be. Put it this
way, she's a-going to the chapel and she's gonna be a murderer. The guitar hook
points, perhaps, to it  being the next single. 'Violin' is more screams over a
formal 12 bar rock structure. Very irritating but quite exciting. 'The Infant
Kiss' is more fantasy (?) on the subject of paedophilia that ponderously plods
into the angelic choirs of 'Night Scented Stock' that in turn moves into 'Army
Dreamers.' This finds Kate adopting either an Irish or more probably a west
country accent and has her delivering the album's most communicative and
realistic moment. It lilts traditionally and tells tale of a boy returning home
from active service in a box. The faraway scream of parade ground orders is
masterful. 'Breathing' sounds like a Thomas Tallis (Elizabethan canticle
composer, fact freaks!) composition and  that probaably sums up the reason for
her success. Taking trad melodical forms to the masses has seen her well.</P>
<P>Vocally Kate Bush has not moved on one iota in  three albums. With 'Army
Dreamers' she deals in  hard realities, though in fairness 'Breathing' does
weave a colourful web around the dangers of nuclear warfare. The former track is
masterful by  way of the fact that emotion flows almost despite those stilted
two dimensional vocals. Elsewhere  it's more songs about the recesses of the
mind. Kate Bush is only 22 years old, yet she writes  like a hoary old mistral.
She's a young girl  and should get out more.</P>
<P>Kate annoys me enough to listen closely, whether  that's good or bad I know
not. This album, it goes without saying, will be as big an irritant to as many
as it will be a vital financial acquisition to others. Either way you'll get her
under your skin, you'll get her deep in the heart of you. ***1/2 (As if it
really mattered)</P>

remember. VM)</P>
