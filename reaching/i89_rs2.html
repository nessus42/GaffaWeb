Subject: Rolling Stone Nov. 2 1989 
</p>



<p>There's a short article on Kate in the &quot;Random Notes&quot; section of the November 2 
issue of Rolling Stone. (Finally! I was wondering when they'd notice.) Here's what 
it says: 
</p>



<p> &quot;I'd like to think that some of the songs could be of some comfort if anyone's 
having a hard time,&quot; says KATE BUSH, whose new album, The Sensual World, is 
just out. &quot;Each song is a scenario in a way, a short story.&quot; 
</p>

<p>It's been four years since Bush has released an album of new material -- she did 
release a compilation album in 1986 -- but it's been even longer since she's toured. 
&quot;My touring situation is a little unusual, to say the least,&quot; she says. &quot;I've only ever 
done one tour, and that was ten years ago, and since then I've only concentrated on 
albums. I much enjoyed the tour. But touring is just re-creating music that already 
exists.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Perhaps because she doesn't tour, Bush, who's a major star in England, has 
never reached as broad an audience in the U.S. &quot;It doesn't really upset me,&quot; she 
says. &quot;I've never seen making an album in terms of sweeping the market.&quot; 
</p>

<p>---------------------
</p>



<p>There's also a picture of her with sand running through her fingers. It's not 
really a very good picture, in my opinion (she's got kind of a long face), but it's in 
color, at least. 
</p>

<p>I'm interested in what RS has to say about the album. Her reviews have never 
been that great in this magazine. They gave a terrible review to The Kick Inside, 
and their review of Hounds of Love was one of the few that was not wholly 
favorable. Yet in the last few years, she's been used as an example of a great artist. 
For example, in the Sinead O'Connor review, Kate is called one of the female artists 
&quot;breaking down the walls of pop music,&quot; and in an article on Jane Siberry, Jane is 
said to have &quot;the offbeat charm of Kate Bush.&quot; So we'll see.
