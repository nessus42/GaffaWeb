<P>[Room For The Life live is played followed by Cathy-like photos, then Kate
walking  down the street and signing autographs] 
</P>
<P>I: On the music, whom do you admire. To come back to when you have been 11,
12, 13  or something. Whose was the person who admired... That you admired? 
</P>
<P>K: When I was that young, it was really the music that my brothers played
and I'd  pick out the stuff that I like and listen to it with them. And... 
</P>
<P>I: What kind of music they play... 
</P>
<P>K: They were into King Crimson, at that time, and Pink Floyd, and Blind
Faith,  Fleetwood Mac, that sort of thing. They were the first, and the Stones
of course,  these were really the first bit of contemporary music I was getting
into. And the  Beatles, obviously. 
</P>
<P>I: When you created your personal tastes, who was [??? favorite] people? 
</P>
<P>K: I think probably a little of everyone, especially traditional music,
because that was  what was happening in this house when I was tiny. And I think
that's... 
</P>
<P>I: What kind of traditional music? 
</P>
<P>K: English folk music, Irish folk music. My brothers were into playing it.
And I think  that had a very strong effect on me. 
</P>
<P>[Strange Phenomena live is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Do you think it's a... this job takes part of you're physical power? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I think it's very mentally tiring, more than physically. I think
touring is  physically tiring, but I think, really most of the other things
involved are much  more mentally exhausting, like concentration is the main
thing, really. And, like,  having to do things all day and just keep up and not
sorta do this [makes  exhausted motion] after three hours. But it's very good,
because it teaches you to  draw on energies that maybe you didn't think you had
and you have to sustain it.  And I think it's a very good exercise. 
</P>
<P>I: You always thought there's only way, the only one way is to be
professional? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it is the only. Especially in this business you have to be
professional about  everything, really. Because it's so important to keep in
control and keep cool. 
</P>
<P>[Kate exercising] 
</P>
<P>K: When I preform, that's just something that happens in me. It just takes
over, you  know. It's like suddenly feeling that you've leapt into another
structure, almost  like another person, and you just do it. But when I'm not
working, I'm very  much me. I mean I certainly wouldn't soon dance around the
table and sing. Like  now, I'm just being me, and I think they're very separate,
and I have to keep  them separate, otherwise I think I'd go mad. 
</P>
<P>[An excerpt of Violin live is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Was your family, in one way, making you creative, or...? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I think so. I think, I mean they're very responsible for me
entering this  path of life. Without.. especially my brothers, they were very
musical. I mean, all  the time there'd be music in the house, from the time I
can first remember. And  to have that around you is bound to effect and either
take you right away from it  or make you jump into it. And I obviously joined
in, because it was fascinating for  me. And we used to sing things and... 
</P>
<P>I: What was your father doing? 
</P>
<P>K: He's a doctor, but he used to play the piano. He's musical, too. It seems
to run in  the family. 
</P>
<P>I: And even if you've been 11 years old, there was no other way to go then
in music? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know about that. I mean it was definitely the thing that I felt
very deeply.  But I guess that I felt that I should have some sort of career in
mind that was  normal, because it's the expected thing. But I don't think my
heart was really in  it, I think I was truly into music all the time, but I
didn't really want to allow it. 
</P>
<P>I: And your parents, they told &quot;you have to learn something serious
that makes your  living?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I think they were concerned that I should have a future that at
least would  be stable, and the music business is probably one of the most
unstable businesses  you can even dream of getting into. But I think they
realized how much music  means to me, and how much I get out of it, and for
them, for any parents the best  thing is to see your children happy. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes of Kate in family farm, then cuts to interview with Dr. Bush, Mrs.
Bush,  Kate, Paddy, and John. Kate seems somewhat shy being around her whole
family.  Everybody laughs.] 
</P>
<P>Hannah Bush: [inaudible] Oh, in the show. I like her in all of it actually,
the quality,  her performance, and her stamina. 
</P>
<P>Hannah: Stamina, yes. I mean her stamina is fantastic. I mean she had to go
on...  We're very proud of that. [Taps Kate on the shoulder] Very professional,
uh huh,  isn't she? 
</P>
<P>I: Have you every saw a risk in this profession of your daughter? 
</P>
<P>Dr. Bush: What sort of risk? 
</P>
<P>I: I mean a risk to make a living out, this show business. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Bush: No, not really. I always had great confidence that she would make
it, from  when she was about 14 I think. Risk, well of course there's risk, but
I thought  there was... I'm her great fan I think from when she was very young
and  hadn't got much of a voice. I always knew there was something so original,
that I  was sure she would make it. 
</P>
<P>[In The Warm Room live is shown, then Hammer Horror live.] 
</P>
<P>I: I read in many interviews that people call you a sex symbol, how do you
react to  that? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's really quite funny, 'cause it's the last thing in the world
I'd ever have  thought, you know, I'd be labeled as. And it's... I don't know
it's incredibly  flattering but I can't conceive it, myself. [Laughs]. It's
quite funny. 
</P>
<P>[Kate and John watching a video] 
</P>
<P>I: Do you think there is a certain image about you already established? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I mean I think that... 
</P>
<P>I: What kind of an image? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I can only really interpret it from what other people see it as.
Because  they're the ones that see it, I just do it. And I'm not sure, I think
they get a  theatrical thing. And hopefully it's just a little more interesting
then if I was just  standing. I'm trying to project something that will say
something rather than just  flit. 
</P>
<P>I: And I think that in our society it's very common to have put everybody in
little  boxes. So as you have definitely an image, but what kind of an image you
want? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I suppose I don't really want an image. I just feel that whenever I
preform  anything, which is really where the image comes from... Images do seem
to be  physical. YOu don't often get an image from someone's music, you get an
image  of them as a person. And for me I'd like that to keep changing, because I
don't  think I have an image, I just try to project whatever's happening in a
song at that  moment. And every song is different, and that's how I would like
to be - I would  like to be different with every song. Rather than the same old
thing, do you know  what I mean? 
</P>
<P>[Kate at a party] 
</P>
<P>I: One half of the job is publicity. How do you handle this, it tires you
sometimes? Or  its boring for you sometimes? 
</P>
<P>K: I guess out of everything that I have to do, its the thing that I
question the most.  Because it was something that I was very aware of when I was
outside the  business. You know like, just reading articles of my heroes and
maybe reading  something that I thought &quot;No!&quot;, you know, &quot;They
wouldn't do that.&quot; And when I  started doing it, I realized that maybe half
the things I'd read just weren't true,  but I'd believe them. And that worries
me to a certain extent that things that are  written down, that maybe have been
slightly misinterpreted, will be totally  believed by an awful lot of people. 
</P>
<P>[Kite live is played. Kate and John Carter Bush are interviewed] 
</P>
<P>K: On the business side, especially Jay is involved, and my father too.
There's so  much to deal with. 
</P>
<P>I: What your father do? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, he sorta ... he'll go along to meetings because he's a director of
the  company. And... 
</P>
<P>I: What company. 
</P>
<P>K: Our company, we have a company. And just sorta sort out the points?
Things that  I just couldn't really have the time to do, or really the knowledge
either. 
</P>
<P>I: And can you explain what you do for Kate. 
</P>
<P>John Carter Bush: Yes, well it's a sorta coordinating process, really. The
company  was formed when it looked as though she was going to become popular and
 there's the administration of that basically. We use a solicitor and
accountant, alot  of people in advisory capacities, so there's liaison between
them as well. And the  whole thing is really to just structure it so that the
final decision on anything  becomes Kate's, which tends to be unusual in the
rock music. Especially when  sorta somebody has suddenly become popular, they
usually then find that they  got a lot of hassles with their record companies
and so on, which weren't thought  of, you know, before they become popular. But
it's been avoided in Kate's case. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes of Kate at mixing console] 
</P>
<P>I: Kate, was the tour a financial success, or was it just for publicity, to
promote you? 
</P>
<P>K: What, the tour? 
</P>
<P>I: Yes. 
</P>
<P>K: It certainly wasn't for financial success, because touring is, well
certainly the way  we did it to, was much more a loss thing then making money.
Because the  amount of money it cost to actually get the thing together, to get
it organized - all  the people involved - it just cost a tremendous amount of
money. And there's no  way that you'd probably even make even, you would lose. 
</P>
<P>I: How many people are involved in the tour, altogether? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, altogether actually on the tour, there were about forty people,
which is a lot.  But besides that, there's like John working on the
co-ordination and Hill and our  solicitors and publicity people. It's just an
enormous thing.
