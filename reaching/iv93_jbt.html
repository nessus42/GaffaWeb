</P>

</P>
<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P>The JBTV interview was suprisingly good, given Kate's recent insistance on 
answering every question with a predetermined, cliche'd response. 
</P>
<P>They played the American Rubberband Girl , Eat The Music and a snippet of
The  Line, The Cross, The Curve with Lindsey Kemp struggling to remain upright
in  fiercely blowing snow. 
</P>
<P>Jerry Bryant promised that this is the first part of a multi-part interview,
and the  second part will air in January. JBTV started as a Public Access (US
cable TV  systems are required to set aside one or more channels for anyone who
wants to  produce a show. Yes, it *is* as generally awful as it sounds) show.
Most of these  shows have no production values to speak of, but Jerry has made a
lot of money  producing radio spots and he has built his own state-of-the-art TV
facility and  moved the show into the commercial realm. He has indicated that he
plans to get  one of those promised &quot;500 channels&quot; and produce
something to challenge  eMpTyVee. 
</P>
<P>The only new info: Kate has never been to the top of the Empire State
building,  she has never been to Chicago. All in all, pretty content-free. 
</P>
<P>I did videotape it, on VHS and Beta, and Uli, I made an extra 1st gen. I
also  captured a couple images and will be uploading to
alt.binaries.pictures.misc and  ftp.uwp.edu in GIF and JPEG formats. 
</P>
