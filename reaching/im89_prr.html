<P> KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD, the sixth studio album from Kate Bush, features ten  new
compositions by the artist (eleven on compact disc and cassette). The new LP 
was produced by Kate, recorded by Del Palmer, and mixed by Kevin Killen. 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD was recorded mainly by Kate's studio in Kent, although 
sessions also took place in Dublin and at EMI's Abbey Road complex. Kate plays 
piano and keyboards and is augmented by a host of acclaimed musicians. These 
include Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka, whose unusual voices are heard on three songs:
 &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot; Never Be Mine,&quot; and &quot;Rocket's Tail.&quot;
There is also the  haunting sound of Davey Spillane's Uillean pipes on the
title-tune (and first U.K.  single), &quot;The Sensual Word,&quot; inspired by
the James Joyce masterpiece, Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was born in Bexley, Kent, England, on July 30, 1958. Her father,
an avid  spare time piano player, and mother, an Irish woman who takes much joy
in music  and dancing, raised Kate and her two older brothers with an open mind
to artistic  experiments. 
</P>
<P>Kate began violin lessons (reluctantly) around the age of nine but took a 
passionate interest in the piano. The day after her father showed her the scale
of C,  Kate became a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>As a result of a three-track demo, organized and financed by Pink Floyd's
Dave  Gilmour, Kate was signed to EMI before leaving school. Accepting a modest
advance  from EMI, she was able to concentrate full time on her dance studies,
which were  initially inspired, and later taught, by theatrical mime-master
Lindsay Kemp. They  would prove invaluable later on with the dawning of the age
of video. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd wanted to make a record more than anything else,&quot; Kate
remembers. Her  ambition was achieved in mid-1977 with the recording of her
debut album, The Kick  Inside. Her first single, &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot;
became a #1 single in the U.K.  (January, 1978). It was followed by the album,
which rapidly sold over one million  copies in the U.K. alone. 
</P>
<P>The pressure was on to make and release a second album. But when Kate 
realized her recording schedule has to be fitted around promotional demands all 
over the continent, she vowed to exercise much more control over her career in
the  future. Nonetheless, the Lionheart album came out in December '78 and a
decision  to tour was finalized. 
</P>
<P>Thirty odd dates took place in Britain and Europe during the spring '79.
Every  show was a sellout and the two and a half hours of music, dance, mime,
and magic  defied critics' expectations. But the rigors exhausted Kate to such
an extent she's  never been able seriously contemplate the idea of another tour.

</P>
<P>The Kate Bush on Stage (Live EP) was released September, 1979. This was the 
first co-production between Kate and John Kelly (who'd engineered the first two 
albums). 
</P>
<P>Then came the five and a half minute single, &quot;Breathing,&quot; which
championed  Green issues back in 1980, and marked a major change in the
expectations of Kate  Bush's many observers. The single entitled &quot;Babooshka&quot;
(June, 1980) was followed in  September by a new album, Never For Ever. Here was
a vinyl confirmation that  Kate had much to offer for the often bland world of
pop. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Dreaming album was so difficult to make,&quot; says Kate of her
next record  (released September, 1982). &quot;Just about everything that could
go wrong did during  that period.&quot; With studio problems and her method of
working the cost involved, she  decided to upgrade her own demo studio into a
professional recording level. 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, critics were left to ponder the merits of an album that had
yielded  &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; and the title track as singles. In fact,
The Dreaming added  considerably to the Kate Bush fan base between it's release
and that of Hounds of  Love exactly three years later. As with The Dreaming,
Kate produced Hounds of  Love, Del Palmer engineered and, for the first time,
they could boast of an album  recorded in their own studio. 
</P>
<P>Hounds of Love quickly established itself as Kate's most successful album to
date  both in a commercial and critical sense. It was the first to give her real
chart success  in America, hitting the top 30 in 1985 (as did the &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; single). The  album was also the catalyst for several superb
videos, most memorably the one that  accompanied &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; which
starred Kate and Donald Sutherland -- one of  her favorite actors. 
</P>
<P>The Whole Story came next, the million-selling compilation album and video 
released late in 1986. Both formats charted high amongst the best-selling titles
that  year. Kate's videos, many of which are directed by her, are almost as
popular as her  records. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I know it's taken a long time but each record gets harder to make,&quot;
she says,  explaining the four-year gap between the albums, Hounds of Love and
THE  SENSUAL WORLD, the latter released worldwide on October 17, 1989. &quot;This
is my  most personal and female album so far. I particularly wanted &quot;The
Sensual World&quot;  as the first single because I feel it is a strong
expression of positive female energy.&quot;
