<P>              Kris Needs's third ZigZag interview (November 1985)
</P>
<P>                                Lassie 
</P>
<P>&quot;Since time immemorial the great sea has fascinated mankind, even as he
is plucked like a lifeless doll from its creaking shores...&quot; (in BBC2
documentary voice)
</P>
<P>     Surf's up! My first experience of the mighty ocean was at the age of
three on holiday. Toes, ankles, trunks slowly engulfed by a white-capped sway.
Wet, wild and a bit scary. Where'd my toy boat go? Oopops-splosh-glub...Suddenly
I was in a muffled blanket-world of bubbles. Panic! Couldn't shout or run away.
Screaming heart on a helter-skelter into the black hole. Was I dying? Strong
arms sent my first taste of mute nostril agony away, but it left a lasting
impression of curious terror.
</P>
<P>     The awesome and ancient power of that great, grey beast has never been
more effectively caught than in the deadly studio-hands of Kate Bush. Her new
album, Hounds of Love (no cracks about ruff mixes), is a triumphant return. Side
Two's seven-song suite, The Ninth Wave, cleaves the opposition, and marks Kate's
finest achievement to date.
</P>
<P>     So this is what she was up to! Three years is a long time in
fad-shallow Music Biz terms, but Kate still manages to stay out on her own,
unsullied and unbowing, creating startlingly inventive gems on her own terms.
</P>
<P>     Three years since The Dreaming and our last mega-rabbit. We meet in a
faceless hotel as Kate prepares for that evening's Whistle Test. And if, for
some reason, you're expecting the smug piss-take species of KB feature, look to
your lesser organs!
</P>
<P>     1985 saw Madonna slither to the top, thrusting every orifice, affair
and affray up our nostrils. Meanwhile, Kate Bush was taking her time. After
promoting The Dreaming in 1982, she moved out of London and took time off to
recharge, see films and friends, sort out hher behind-the-scenes team, design
and build her own recording studio, write new songs and record.
</P>
<P>     Kate admits she was wondering how she'd go down after three years away
(and what penis thought up the one about a 20-stone Kate Bush? Sit down, man!).
No problems. Running Up That Hill did just that up the chart. Then comes the
mother-album, and it sails right over Madonna's head to number one first week.
</P>
<P>     Did you fall off your chair, Kate?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yeah, I was surprised, but it's such a good reward for all that
time you spent. You just do the best you can, and if it doesn't work, then fair
enough.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Yes, Kate is &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; but genuinely
pleased that like what she does; probably the least affected &quot;star&quot;
I've ever met totally obsessed by her work, not what club she was seen in the
night before. She's obsessed to the point of perfectionism, will labour lovingly
for hours over one phrase. And in her own studio Kate didn't have to watch EMI's
thousands tick by or dodge low-flying pizzas.
</P>
<P>      &quot;It is frustrating for me to spend so much time over one thing.
It does become tedious, but you know you have to do it. I never know how long
those things are going to take. Once it takes over, it has a life of its own.
</P>
<P>     &quot;The main thing for me has been evolving with the production. Now
I don't have to compromise with other people, and that's brilliant because you
can explore things. It can seem like what you're doing is mad. It's not until a
few hours later that it seems like it could work. You need to be in control to
get away with that stuff!
</P>
<P>     &quot;That time I took off in '83 was reorganising everything. I've
made some of the best decisions in the last two years. That's good, because I
really did feel that what mattered was getting the work right. You do wonder
sometimes about your intentions. When you come out into the world and they're
all laying different things on you-- if you spend too long you can get
shell-shocked and retreat, wondering who you are.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I have to retreat and go back to the work, because that's what
matters. Work just obsesses my life, and everyone around me is dragged into it.
It's terrible, really. I don't go out much or socialize--I don't have time.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush is not a recluse, she just never felt it necessary to drape
her lingerie over the front pages. Madonna's brazen strategy is met with a quiet
&quot;I don't think that's me, really&quot;. Yet despite the lack of dirt and
self-trumpeting, she can still steam in at number one.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it's brilliant because it's the music that's done nothing
to do with image and doing great publicity stunts. I've been quiet for a while
and I don't feel an image can sustain that amount of time.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, it was quite a brave move for Kate to enter the Hounds
party at London's Laserium on the arm of longtime boyfriend Del Palmer (who
plays bass and arranged most of the exotic drum-machine patterns on the album).
</P>
<P>     Flashes flashed and hacks hacked, and next week the music papers took
the piss. One victim was Brilliant's Youth, there to celebrate his bacon-bass
contribution to The Big Sky's primal undertow. Legless on the free booze, he was
easy prey for star-spotting gossipers, who snickered that he'd called Del a
wally. The Brillo man was outraged (&quot;I'll sue!&quot;).
</P>
<P>     For a rare moment Kate's hackles bucked: &quot;It surprises me that
people can put such an incredible amount of energy into such negative stuff.
They can be so wicked. I got the impression that that was getting at several
people at one go. Definitely a bitch-off. It was very upsetting for Del as well.
He never even talked to the person who quoted him. You have to accept yourself
as a target, but it's really upsetting when they get to people around you,
because they don't deserve to get stick [sic].
</P>
<P>     &quot;Del's never come out with me before.. People can be very rude--
but that singles out an area of this business that people should really start
marching against. It's such a shame, because this business is very special, and
so many people get hurt and abused.
</P>
<P>      &quot;I do get a bit scared of exposure. That's the thing that
frightens me--coming out of work and saying (cheesy grin) 'Here's the new
album!' It's a bit frightening--how exposed you are suddenly everywhere, being
on the side of a bus when it goes past...I hate that! You have to laugh at it to
survive.&quot;
</P>
<P>     The second side of the album, The Ninth Wave, concerns a girl who's
been in the water a long time staring death in its cold, watery eye. Past,
present and future images mingle with her thoughts through seven songs which
crash and flow in senses-gutting layers of voices and sounds. Morbid terror is
split by an Irish gig, aching reflection ebbs into the haunting astral moan of
spectral friars before unexpected rejuvenation. Shattering stuff.
</P>
<P>      So donning fetching, furry trunks and clinging to a slice of
driftwood, I ask Kate how this massive concept originated.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Last year we went to Ireland to do some recording in Dublin, and
took a couple of weeks to out. It was brilliant, because I was writing lyrics,
and we were right by the sea. A lot of the time that I was thinking about
putting this album together, I was right there with the water.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I love the sea. It's the energy that's so attractive--the fact
that it's so huge. And war films, where people would come off the ship and be
stuck in the water with no sense of where they were or of time, like sensory
deprivation. It's got to be ultimately terrifying.&quot;      The sleeve quotes
a chunk of Lord Tennyson's poem, The Coming of Arthur. Was that the initial
inspiration for the piece?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, actually it was the other way around. I wanted a title for
the whole thing. I was looking through some books and found this quote. In his
poem he's talking about the secrets of waves working in nine--like a complete
cycle, with everything building up to the ninth wave and starting again. I've
always liked using quotes for things.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Patti Needs--a New Yorker who recently heard Kate for the first time
and totally melted--reckons The Jig of Life, a rousing-but-weird Irish whirl
based on Greek rhythms discovered by Kate's delving brother Paddy, is the girl
dying.
</P>
<P>      &quot;I'm too close to it. Other people's interpretations are what it
should be, but the Irish track is the future her coming back and saying, 'Don't
die, because you're going to kill me, as well. Up till then everything's just so
desperate. This person brings some kind of hope into the situation...&quot;
</P>
<P>     I ask Kate if she had ever nearly drowned or had a nasty one in the
drink.
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, I've never really had any bad experiences in water.&quot;
</P>
<P>     The range of personae and emotions that Kate adopts on her albums is
staggering. How much do you become what you're singing, Kate?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It depends on how much research or knowledge I've got of a
situation. It makes it more interesting to do if you've been really that
inspired by a situation, and somehow want to do it justice. It's harder when
there isn't a specific person to become, and you can't pin down the emotional
quality. the most upsetting one to do on this album was 'Watching You Without
Me'. That's such a sad thought...&quot;
</P>
<P>     She looks wistfully into her tea. &quot;I think all music is about
emotions, trying to take people on a journey if you can...I can't tell. I just
hope it's going to get people.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Sure gets me, Patti, Oscar the Rat, and even six-month-old Daniel Lee,
who bellows along with Cloudbursting [sic], the new single. Which brings us
neatly to the new video, a full-blown, seven-minute epic.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I was putting a lot of thought into the video things even before
we started recording the album. I wanted to find the right people to work with.
That was the only time I got off to plan things. So I did things like find a
fantastic new dance teacher called Dianne Gray. We did the choreography together
for the last single. All this is very relevant to what we're doing now. The
problem is, I'm still trying to work on creative things like videos and
twelve-inches and things, but you have to let people know commercially, as well.
Everything's gone so well, but it really is little me on the end, trying to keep
up with it all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>     Cloudbursting [aarrgh] is stately and string-driven, a sad story which
Kate got from a book.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I picked up this book nine years ago in a bookshop I used to go
into and look around in. There was this book staring at me, so I pulled it off
the shelf. I've never done that before. It was A Book of Dreams by Peter Reich.
It was incredible. It's through his eyes as a young boy, and his life with his
father, who was everything to him. The book has an incredible sense of intimacy
and magic. Do you know about Wilhelm Reich?&quot;
</P>
<P>     Erm...(blush).
</P>
<P>     &quot;He was quite a well-respected psycho-analyst, and he had a
machine, according to his son, that could make it rain. They'd go out together
and point the machine at the sky and make it rain. the book was so sad, because
the whole thing is through the child's eye about his father. But it's been
written, fairly obviously, by a sad adult who, I think, had a great deal of
trouble coping with his father going--he was arrested by the F.D.A., and put in
prison, and he died shortly after that. The loss to his son must have been
incredible. His father always warned him that this would probably happen, but
his life revolved around everything his father did.
</P>
<P>      &quot;I rang up the guy and sent him a copy of the song. I thought
it'd be really rude not to do that before it came out. He liked it, which is
great, because I was really worried. I don't know what I would have done if he
hadn't liked it.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Ever able to spring a stunner, Kate appears in the video as the little
boy (in short wig). Towering over her as Dad is none other than Donald
Sutherland, the tragic father in Don't Look Now, one of Kate's favourite films,
among many others. Kate asked him to appear, he said yes, and turns in an
eccentric tour de force as the mad prof parent--a perfect foil for Kate's
wide-eyed innocence. they hoist the huge old rain-machine up the hill, but
before it can work, Dad's arrested, leaving Kate at the controls. Does she do
it? I hope you get to see it.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it's the most interesting thing we've tried yet. I wanted
to create a short film that told the story and looked like a feature film. There
was so much to be said in the story that we had to extend the track. I hope
people understand the story and get the sense of emotion from it. It certainly
inspired me originally to write the song from the book. It's the film of the
song of the book!
</P>
<P>      &quot;What's nice about these last two videos is that I really feel
I've worked with people who are receptive to my ideas, and we actually work
together. It was frustrating on some of the other videos, because I felt I was
going further away from what I should have been going towards. But you spend so
much time and money on these videos, and they'll probably only show two minutes!&quot;
</P>
<P>      A logical step would be a full-scale movie, yes?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's a choice between two things I'd like to do next as a major
project. Either a tour...But what I'd really like to do is put The Ninth Wave
into film. That would easily be as time-consuming as a tour. I just don't know
if I'd be able to get it off the ground. It's all talk and it might never
happen.&quot; [In the end, she did neither. Instead, after completing several
more single recordings, releasing a compilation album and making three more
videos--all of them self-directed--she began work on her sixth album.]
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush can inspire strange reactions in people I mentioned our
coming interview to one Jeffrey Lee Pierce of this parish and he exploded into a
stream of likely questions. Thought I'd try &quot;What's your favourite
skeleton?&quot; (?) [Needs's own parentheses.]
</P>
<P>     Kate is tickled: &quot;That's fantastic! What an incredible question!'
she gurgles, before admitting that her research is too limited in that field for
a proper answer. But she does let on that she likes badgers, rabbits and horses
when they've got their &quot;clothes&quot; on, and can' resist the sight of an
ostrich running at 90 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>     More titanically, it transpires that she's a big fan of the mighty
wartime English comedian Will Hay (wahoo!) and is fascinated by the cruel side
of some comedians (Benny Hill dumping his lunch on the old bloke's pate while
chortling at the fat lady, etc?).
</P>
<P>     Pondering hurling a sausage roll at the Editor, I skuttle away, bathed
in a warm glow. Later it rains (I want one!)
