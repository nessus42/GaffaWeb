<P><A NAME="4.1y">From: Thomas Brasch &lt;thombras@vef.north.net&gt;</A> <BR>
Date: Sun, 30 Jan 94 13:02:32 EST <BR> Subject: CFNY Interview with Kate, Jan.
1994 (?)
</P>
<P>Although this interview is shorter than I remember, I still feel it better
than the  interview that was conducted later that night which was broadcast
throughout North  America. I must admit that I felt rather embarrassed with the
phone-in interview  where people (mostly males) could say &quot;I love you,
Kate!&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;I want to bear your  children and be your personal
slave!&quot;) This sort of juvenile swooning is very  unbecoming, degrading and
even condescending. In my mind, I would not be in the  least surprised that it
is this sort of behaviour that turns Kate away from the public,  causing her
publicity shyness! Although we all dream of being famous at some point  in our
life, not many of us would feel comfortable with our peers kissing our feet. 
</P>
<P>Regardless, here is the interview with May Potts from CFNY, Toronto, Canada.
I  tried to transcibe it as best I could, keeping true to every word but trying
to omit  any &quot;um's&quot; which are just an ordinary part of speech. 
</P>
<P>Sorry about the delay! 
</P>
<P>{music cut: MOP and a very gracious intro on the part of May} 
</P>
<P>MP: Do you feel comfortable with fame? 
</P>
<P>KB: Um, in a lot of ways, no, I don't but then I don't really, um...I think
it's how  you deal with things. I feel so honoured to be in the situation where
I'm  actually doing what I like and I'm able to make a living out of it. And, I
know so  many people whose work is not what they would like to do. It's not what
they  enjoy. So I feel extremely lucky and I really hope that I will be able to
continue  being creative. It means a lot to me and I have a great deal of fun
doing it and  involving other people in it at the same time. And I suppose the
thing of trying  to make a piece of work as good as you can and doing your best
and feeling that  it is worthy to go out has a lot to do with not wanting to
abuse the position I feel  I'm in. I feel I'm in a very priveledged position.
And I suppose also that the  relationship I have with my work is to me very
important. I don't abuse it. I  never really wanted to be famous. Being famous
is not what makes me write  music or want to make albums. So, although there are
some areas that I'm not  comfortable with, there are so many where I am. And I
am so grateful to be in  this position. It is just a matter of me dealing with
it as best I can. 
</P>
<P>MP: So tell us about your film, The Line, The Cross and The Curve. Does it
tie in  fairly closely to the original story, The Red Shoes. 
</P>
<P>KB: Not really to the original story. I suppose it does hop back to the
fairy story  more. But it's more the idea of working in a rehearsal studio with
a band and  suddenly this woman appears in the room and she tricks me out of my
soul but  she is represented by three symbols, and puts me under a spell which
involves  the Red Shoes. For the rest of the film, I have to try to win back my
Soul. So  it's kind of like a fairy tale that was adapted from the original one
but which  sort of turned into a modern fairy tale. I guess.
