(Ulrich Grepel) <BR> Subject: Karstadt 'Music News' magazine (12/93) with Kate
interview 
</P>
<P>The free music magazine of Karstadt, 'Music News' has an article/interview 
about/with Kate in issue 12/93. There are three pictures accompanying the
article:  the two Rubberband Girl pictures and the picture with the bird on her
head. 
</P>
<P>After reading the interview I somehow doubt that this really was an
interview.  I'd consider it as a collage of several other interviews, the one
and only new one that  has been used a lot of times now and several old ones.
The rest might just be filled  in so that the interview has a thread it can run
around. Especially WRONG is the  question about shopping in the *Christmas*
time. The film was completed LONG  before Christmas time... 
</P>
<P>And now for something completely different:

<P ALIGN="center">      In an Interview</P>
<H2>      KATE BUSH </H2>
<H2>     Gentle &amp; beautiful</H2>
<P>Welling is a peaceful, friendly city in the county of Kent, in the south of
England.  This spot - a cinema, a tiny library, a supermarket, majestic
orchards, pretty rows of  houses - was the birth place of Catherine Bush. In
Welling she grow up together  with her brothers Paddy and John in an old brick
farmhouse, entwined by wild ivy.  Her father was a general practioner, the
mother, an unshakeable Irish woman, with  a traditional musical background, lead
the household. 
</P>
<P>Noone from Welling ever managed to break out of the peacefulness into an 
international career - except Catherine Bush: After her musical debut 1978 as
Kate  Bush (&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;) her star arose like a comet, her
unmistakable voice  brought her gold, platinum and world-wide fame. Only Madonna
was successful  with more albums in the English charts. After four years of
creative break now Kate  Bush presents a new album: &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: Which kind of music do you yourself like to listen to? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Many, but it must not be too wild. I like classical music, though
I do  not understand too much about classics. It is just plain nice to listen to
and to give  oneself to the feelings. The classical composers often were
geniuses. I miss this  genius with contemporary musicians. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: Are you able to do your shopping now around the Christmas time 
without being pestered by the fans? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Yes. Of course. Sometimes people stand still and probably wonder 
where from they know me. I simply go on. I like shopping, but now I do not have 
much time for shopping. I am working on a film. It will be almost an hour long
and  Miranda Richardson, Lindsay Kemp, and I are playing the leading roles. It
is a  fairy tale around six songs from &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: What have you done the last four years? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: I was mainly busy doing my new album. I always was obsessed with 
the 1948 ballet movie &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. I took this stuff as an example
for my new  CD. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: What do you do when you do not work at an album? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: I like going to the cinema. But otherwise my life just revolves
around  my work. I do not have much time for society dates. I do not like
parties very  much. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: Do you read your fan mail by yourself? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Yes. At least I try. It moves me every time how nice people write
to  me. Sometimes, when I'm really down, reading such a sweet letter really
helps  me going on. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: What do you do for fun? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Albums. 
</P>
<P>MUCIS NEWS: Do you laugh very much when you are in the studio? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: I like good humour. I can archive happy, exuberant moods in my
inner  self. I can laugh most about Monthy Python. 
</P>
<P>MUSIC NEWS: You are now 35. With 19 you had your first world hit. Do you
have  fear of getting older? 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: No. But there are so many things I would yet like to do. And 
sometimes I worry that time is simply running away from me.
