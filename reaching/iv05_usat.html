<p><b><i>An Aerial View</i></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Influential style: Bush's music has had an impact on various artists. &quot;People 
like Outkast have made very nice comments,&quot; she says. </p>
<p>Critics have regularly invoked Bush's distinctive soprano voice and the lush, 
ethereal style she introduced back in 1978 with the single Wuthering Heights in 
describing other quirky alt-pop darlings such as Bjork and Tori Amos. The list 
of musicians who have cited Bush as a source of inspiration is even more 
diverse. </p>
<p>&quot;People like Outkast have made very nice comments,&quot; notes Bush, 48. &quot;And my 
friends have been telling me for years how they hear my influence. That's the 
best thing you can ask for.&quot; </p>
<p>But Bush admits that she herself &quot;doesn't listen to a lot of contemporary 
music. That's quite deliberately so when I'm working on a record myself.&quot; </p>
<p>And despite her decade-plus disappearance, Bush has been working lately. A 
two-CD set, Aerial, was released earlier this month, and she describes it as 
part concept album, part &quot;straightforward&quot; song collection. The decision to 
record two separate discs stemmed from her 1993 release, The Red Shoes. </p>
<p>&quot;In hindsight, I think my last record was too long,&quot; Bush says. &quot;Some of my 
better songs were on it, but they got lost. I was trying to give people as much 
for their money as I could. But people have very short attention spans now. It 
seems everything is just a moment away from the fast-forward button.&quot; </p>
<p>Bush had begun writing songs that would eventually appear on Aerial's first 
disc, A Sea of Honey, when the idea emerged for a conceptual work about, of all 
things, birdsong. &quot;That's a theme I've wanted to play around with for a long 
time,&quot; she says, explaining the origin of the second disc, A Sky of Honey. &quot;Once 
I got the conceptual piece off and running, I started to like the idea of having 
two separate atmospheres.&quot; </p>
<p>While Bush had planned to take some time off after Red Shoes, the path to 
Aerial proved longer than she had anticipated. &quot;Since I was 17, I had been just 
making records and promoting them. I wanted a break. I spent more time with 
friends, went to see movies, just got on with my life. I thought at first I 
would take a year off, but it turned into a very long gap.&quot; </p>
<p>Part of the reason for that was the namesake of a song on Sea: Bertie, Bush's 
7-year-old son by her longtime partner, guitarist Danny MacIntosh. &quot;I have a 
little boy, and I wanted to spend a lot of time with him,&quot; Bush says simply. 
Pressed to elaborate on the joys of motherhood, she demurs: &quot;I have to watch 
myself, because I could talk about (Bertie) all day.&quot; </p>
<p>The singer, who has been described as reclusive and rarely performs live, 
allows that her maternal responsibilities make the possibility of a tour even 
less likely. </p>
<p>&quot;I don't have as much time now because I've got other things to think about,&quot; 
Bush says. &quot;We've got a lot going on based around where we live, and we don't 
want to disrupt that.&quot;</p>
