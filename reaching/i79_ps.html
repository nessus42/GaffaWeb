<P>The Pop Star interview 
</P>
<P>&lt;This interview was published anonymously in Pop Star magazine, May 26,
1979.  The author's hastily considered opinions are matched by awkward,
ungrammatical  writing. Edited (insofar as this was possible) by Andrew Marvick.&gt;

</P>
<P>  Fangs a Lot Kate ! 
</P>
<P> Can you see Ms. Bush as a vampire?
</P>
<P>  No neither can she 
</P>
<P>It ain't rock'n'roll. And if you've seen Kate Bush on her sell-out British
tour  you'll know why. Live, she is about theatre and dance. And for a 
theatre-goer--you've probably seen a lot of it before. Lots of costumes, dance
and  mime. The lovely little lady dresses in various leotard-based costumes for
her  routines--which include a bar scene in an old tumble-down place where she
turns  away ugly molesters and even dressed in an airman's outfit with a
parachute draped  over a mock tree for Lionheart. What really makes her, though,
is her face and  movements. A little flick of the eyes at the end of the number
makes you want to  see more--to know her. And you want her to look at you
personally. You could go  on for ever about the rest of the act: when she
dresses as a cowboy shooting  everyone down, when she's in a leather jacket and
black leotard with a guy each  side spinning chromed dustbins &lt;The author
means dustbin-lids.&gt;, when she looks at  a floating silver ball controlled by
a ballet dancer on invisible wires, she is like a  child: young and innocent
rather than sexy. &lt;Other reviewers reached exactly the  opposite conclusion,
which only proves that opinions about Kate's sex appeal reveal  more about the
beholder than about Kate, her work or her intentions.&gt; 
</P>
<P>It ain't rock'n'roll. The music...I'm afraid, gets same-ish. Her voice gets 
wearing. It is a show based on her songs--entertainment. Not what you'd call 
culture. &lt;Amazing.&gt; So it's surprising that she doesn't consider herself
an actress.  &quot;I'm interested in theatre,&quot; asserts Kate. &quot;Films...I
really don't know about. I don't  consider myself an actress. Unless something
came up that I felt I could do, then I  wouldn't do it. I have had film
offers--like, there's been a couple of vampire films,  and a rock musical.
That's an obvious one because I'm a singer. But I wouldn't  have thought I was a
vampire!&quot; No. But there have been some good-looking  vampires. And
sometimes her mystique on stage does lend itself to that sort of 
feeling--taunting but unattainable. But it's only taken two years for her to
sell out  all Britain's biggest venues--she started playing at a pub in South
London's  Lewisham. Now she's got a stage show that is original, exciting and
even shocking.  But the young Kate Bush is very modest about the extravaganza: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that maybe a lot of people heard that it was going to be
visual, and many  of them are into seeing shows that are different from the
normal ones. But it's not  really for me to say why they like me. It's the
people who know that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure there are as many people who hate my voice as ones who like
it, but  whatever it is, it's encouraging for me to know that people want to see
me, whether  it's to criticise, or because they really want to see the show. I
think that's a great  compliment.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sure is. But it's taken a long time for her to take her show on the road,
especially  after her vinyl success with Wuthering Heights, Wow, and her two
albums The  Kick Inside and Lionheart. So why did she wait until now to do the
tour? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Basically, it's time. When Wuthering Heights and The Kick Inside took
off at  such a level there was a very strong demand for me to go out and do
promotion. I  think it's a sensible thing to do, but I didn't know it would take
up a year. And  besides, I spent most of that year recording the second album. 
</P>
<P>&quot;One of the reasons I waited was to get the show right because to go on
tour in  this way you do need at least three months's preparation, and I just
didn't have the  time before. You know, we were all working for six days a week,
twelve hours a  day--and the number of hours gradually grew towards the end. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really need to be prepared for that sort of thing. Even for an
album, I feel I  need that preparation period. I don't know if this makes me a
perfectionist. But I do  have ideas that I don't always reach, so I guess that
is what I am.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There's an argument in that somewhere. That preparation has paid off. In
this  country Kate Bush is nothing short of a superstar. Her Kick Inside album
is still high  in the charts, although Lionheart, the second album, hasn't done
so well. Isn't that  strange? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it was more surprising to me that the first album did so well,
than that  the second album is not doing as well as the first one. It was really
a surprise to me  that a lot of people liked that album, and as far as I'm
concerned I'm quite pleased  with how well Lionheart did.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Maybe it's got something to do with the cover, eh? No, no, no, no, couldn't
be.  How could anyone think such a thing? Just because she looks more sexy on
that  cover can't have anything to do with it. &lt;The editor's observation re &quot;sexiness&quot;
in  Kate's work apply equally here.&gt; OK, that's a bit unfair. But seriously,
Kate Bush  has an image. And it's a strong one. Off her own back she's developed
a totally  individual style both songwise and actwise. She's been prominent on
the music  scene for a good eighteen months. And in many ways it might be better
for her to lie  low for a bit before coming back. Does she agree? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I think humans are like cars--when the petrol runs out, that's
it. What  worries me is running out of fuel, because when you're working all the
time there  is very little chance to do things like going to the theatre,
reading books, or whatever  things inspire you. 
</P>
<P>&quot;So it's very important for me to have breaks and be natural and normal
and  re-fuel, because without that fuel inside you can't give anything out. Very
often I  see people whose work has totally taken them over, so they can see
nothing else in  the world. That frightens me. I am a bit obsessed with my
work--but I'm also  concerned about being a human being. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I always try and gauge my reactions from people I've known for years,
and if I  see that changing, it's up to me to check where I'm at, because being
a human  being is the most important thing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If people don't want to hear my music any more, I as a personality or
celebrity  would no longer exist, but I will always be human. The lifestyle may
be different  now than it was two years ago, but I think I'm still the
same...although not as  serious, perhaps!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Which all really makes good sense. For a twenty-year-old, she really has got
her  head screwed on the right way. She realises her limitations and her strong
points.  And it's that professional competence that's done so much for her
success--she can  handle it without going off the rails. 
</P>
<P>All the same, it can still be a tough life at the top! There are a lot of 
commmitments--interviews, radio shows and photograph sessions, as well as 
record-company pressures to keep the hits coming. Has her new-found wealth put 
many pressures on her? 
</P>
<P>&quot;There are probably a lot of pleasures that I'm not even aware of, that
other  people feel probably more strongly than myself. You do feel general
pressures  sometimes, but I'm having a real good time at the moment, and I'm
doing what I  want to do, and things are running more or less as I wish them to.

</P>
<P>&quot;It's such a fulfilling time of my life at the moment. The thing about 
money--being wealthy--I'm not really aware of, beause I see money as something 
that should be used and not thought about much, because it causes an awful lot
of  hang-ups in people. It's terrible that money is such a material thing.&quot;
As for the  future, Kate simply has this to say: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think everyone has to change, because tastes and times change. Even
Cliff  Richard, who's been going for years, changed at times. I'd like to
change, but it's  also important to keep the continuity. There is no point in
changing just for the sake  of changing. I never know if I'm going to change
until I actually do something. So I  just have to wait and see.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And, it seems, so will we. But you can't help feeling that it's gonna be
good.
