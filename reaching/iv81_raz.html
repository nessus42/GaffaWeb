<P>Date: Mon, 22 Jan 90 10:39 EST <BR> From: PBMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu
<BR> Subject: Razzamattazz UK TV July 14, 1981
</P>
<P>The recent thoughtful attention to &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; by Jon, Doug,
and IED  brought to mind some incidental information about the video for that
song that  comes up in an interview Kate did on some British children's TV
program, at the  time it was being made, that I happen to have on tape. Probably
this was posted  years ago and reposes in the archives; but just in case.... 
</P>
<P>I call this the &quot;Snow White&quot; interview, because Kate looks like a
refugee from a  Disney set. Her hair is dyed much darker than usual--colored and
cut as it appears  in the video. She is wearing a low-cut red dance leotard, a
print skirt, low-heeled  rope wedgy slipons. She hits exactly the mix of sexy
and demure of a Disney maiden. 
</P>
<P>The set is simple; three rows of children sit on Kate's and the
interviewer's left  and right. They look to be 10, 11; what I would call 4th
graders, whatever Form that  corresponds to in England. Behind them is a large
rainbow painted on a wall. The  interviewer is a sandy-haired young woman whose
name is not used on my tape; on  that tape the show begins with the video for &quot;Babooshka&quot;
already in progress,  coming to the end. (I.=Interviewer) 
</P>
<P>[from The Garden:
</P>
<P>54. Razzmatazz: Kate discusses with the host and a group of children the
making  of the video Sat In Your Lap. Aired on U.K. TV, July 14, 1981. 
</P>
<P>This clip shows Kate sitting among a group of about fifteen children. She is
 wearing a skirt over a leotard. She discusses the making of her videos and her
way  of devising ideas for the visual presentation of her songs; and she shares
some of the  costume-props which were made and used for the Sat In Your Lap
video. Also, two  of her official videos are shown.] 
</P>
<P>[Babooshka is played.] 
</P>
<P>I. A really amazing video there by a really amazing lady--Kate Bush!
(Children  holler &quot;yea!&quot; and clap). Well, we're really obviously
pleased to have you here,  Kate. 
</P>
<P>KB Great. 
</P>
<P>I. Actually, when you perform this song, there's none of this sort of
standing up in  front of the mike and just belting it out, it really is quite a
work of art. When  you're writing songs, Kate, do you think, always, in the back
of your mind, how  is this going to look on a video? 
</P>
<P>KB ummm... Not always, at the writing stage. There is a lot of visual ideas
because  when you're writing a song you've got to think of the character who's
singing  the song, who often isn't yourself. And that character will be in a
particular  situation, either an unhappy one, or in a certain room, with a
certain person. And  I think all these things, you actually mentally push
yourself into it, to write the  song so that you'll be closest to that
atmosphere. And when you make a video  often you can't afford to visually do
what you have in your mind, so often we'll  change it slightly, make it a bit
more abstract, rather than go for the full thing. 
</P>
<P>I. I think Dave has a question. (Boy in front row to Kate's left speaks.) 
</P>
<P>D. How do you make your videos, Kate? 
</P>
<P>KB Well, umm, it's quite a long process, it depends on the song. The song
really  dictates what you have to do with it. Some songs are very simple, and
other songs  almost become little epics, where you've got to section lots of
things together.  And if you're using other people in the video, then you have
to get choreography  for them and make sure that they look right and they do the
right things and,  uh...it really is a lot of fun, actually. For me it's almost
like making a film, and I  think of it as something very special. 
</P>
<P>I. Now, you've brought some story boards along today, haven't you? 
</P>
<P>KB Yes, I have (reaches behind her chair and brings up a large bound
portfolio).  Something that I do for the videos just recently is, umm (opens
folio), in order to  let the people that are working on the video know--like the
cameramen and all  that--I draw these little pictures. I don't know if you can
see (holds up first story  sheet for &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;); the video
starts off with an eye, blinking, in time to  the music. 
</P>
<P>I. It's very rough drawings (cut to the video itself, the eye, blinking). 
</P>
<P>KB (Over the corresponding part of the video) And the camera moves out. And
as  the camera moves out you see a little baby boy on my lap. And this is really
step  by step, almost like a cartoon (picture cuts back to Kate speaking; audio
from the  song continues in background). 
</P>
<P>Girl What other interests do you have apart from singing and dancing? 
</P>
<P>KB Well, in many ways, before all these things started happening to me, they
were  my interests. Like when I got home from school, I used to want to play the
piano  and that sort of thing. And, um, I'm very lucky because my interests are
my  work. And in so many ways, any interests that I have can become part of my 
work. Like a few months ago I bought a pair of skates and just fancied learning 
how to rollerskate. And we're going to have a rollerskating section in the
video. I  think in a way that's the wonderful thing about art, like music,
dancing, that sort  of thing. Everything you do can then become your work. You
know, like if you're  cleaning up one night, you might suddenly realize what a
great routine it'd make,  with the broom, you know. It's just keeping your mind
open for all these things.  And it's really fun. Life becomes work. 
</P>
<P>I. What about your training, though, in the early days, Kate? Tell us about
that. 
</P>
<P>KB Well, when I left school, I wanted to do something that would help my
music and  I didn't want to be sat around all day doing nothing, though I knew
that I wanted  to push myself into my music, and I thought that one of the best
things I could do  would be to learn to dance, because they're very close arts.
Music and dance are  meant to go together. And I went to see an incredible
performance, by someone  called Lindsay Kemp. And I suddenly realized that this
is what I was looking  for--this sort of movement combined with music. So I took
some classes with  him, and went on to the Dance Centre, which is still
existing, and took lessons  with a wonderful lady called Robin Kovak, and a lot
of other teachers, and I've  been going ever since, really--on and off. 
</P>
<P>I. One of my favorites is &quot;The Man With the Child in His Eyes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>KB Yes, that probably was the simplest one we've ever done. Again, the song 
dictated it. It was a very intimate song, about a young girl almost voicing her 
inner thoughts, not really to anyone, but rather to herself. And it just started
off,  I just sat down on the floor cross-legged and ready to work out some ideas
(cut to  the video) to the routine, with the music on. And my brother Jay came
in and  saw me sitting there and said, why don't you just keep it like that
(video  continues briefly, then cut back). 
</P>
<P>I. How do you keep up with costumes, and especially your hair, during
touring? KB  Well, on tour we had a lady who looked after all the costumes,
'cause it wasn't  just me that was wearing costumes, and all the band had
clothes, and the dancers,  and the musician--the magician, I mean. And she had
to keep repairing them  every night and getting them dry-cleaned. And my hair, I
really just tried...I had  to have one perm before the tour and that tried to
hold it for the rest...it didn't  do very well, but...yeah. 
</P>
<P>I. You've brought some costumes with you today. 
</P>
<P>KB Yes, I have brought...(reaches behind again to bring out the dunce cap
from &quot;Sat  in Your Lap&quot;). The video that we're doing at the moment is
some characters  featuring that background, so--that's fine (sets the cap on the
head of a boy to  her right, pulls the elastic over his chin). Welcome to dunce!
(Children laugh.) 
</P>
<P>I. That's Jacobin--we want to know who it is. 
</P>
<P>KB The song's all about the search for knowledge. So... (pulls out one of
the  three-pronged red and yellow fool headdresses). 
</P>
<P>I. This is your new song, is it? The search for knowledge. 
</P>
<P>KB (Hands headdress to a boy on her left, who studies it for a bit, figures
out it goes  on your head, and puts it on.) Seemed like a good idea to have some
figures that  epitomized looking for knowledge. And uh (pulls out one of the
bull caps) this is  a bull. And what Pammy did here...this was originally a
cow's mask, and it was a  very pretty cow, and it was pink, and had big
eyelashes. And she managed to cut  it down and completely changed it; she put
these horns on, on top of what was  there, and turned it into a bull.
Incredible. 
</P>
<P>I. Let's give that to Marie, shall we? (Kate sets it on the head of the girl
who asked  the earlier question.) What about your costumes for this video, Kate?

</P>
<P>KB (Reaches behind and pulls out her costume). Well, we tried to base it on
a sort  of ballerina's costume. Obviously I've got a lot of interesting dance to
do. But  also, the flavor of the song, everyone kept commenting on how Spanish
it was.  And this was one of the reasons for the bull image here, everyone
thought it was  very Spanish and bullringy. So we tried to keep this looking
like a ballet tutu, but  at the same time making the skirt slightly Spanish, so
that I'd be able to pick it  up and wave it around (the video for &quot;Sat in
Your Lap&quot; starts). And Pammy based  this on a ballet tutu. 
</P>
<P>(Complete video for &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; is shown.) 
</P>
<P>KB (Reprise) It really is a lot of fun, actually. For me it's almost like
making a film.  And I think of it as something very special. (Children holler
yea, applaud.)
