<P>Old Kate Bush Interviews 3: &quot;Rock and Pop Stars&quot;, 1979, #1 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush: She's Your No. 1&quot;, from EMI's promotional magazine, 
</P>
<P>&quot;Rock and Pop Stars&quot;, 1979, #1 (Anonymous) 
</P>
<P>&quot;This Bush is at the top of the tree!&quot; 
</P>
<P>There's no doubt about it: 1978 was really a cracker of a year for Kate
Bush, the  doctor's daughter from Kent. 
</P>
<P>At the tender age of 19, the strikingly good-looking red-haired Kate shot to
 stardom in a most amazing manner, surprising probably even the record people
who  were behind the tremendous promotional build-up of her singing career. 
</P>
<P>One minute she was an unkown, likeable girl. The next, she was being hailed
as a  star. And the nice thing is, she still remains as likeable as ever. 
</P>
<P>But there is no doubt the girl has changed, as far as her career and her 
performances are concerned. 
</P>
<P>It was that one haunting song, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which launched
her--and  catapulted her to instant stardom. 
</P>
<P>She first hit the charts in January 1978 with her stange debut single. The
record  was inspired by Emily Bronte's famous novel, and went to No. 1 and
stayed there for  several weeks. 
</P>
<P>Her first album followed fairly quickly. Titled &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;,
it was a  collection of her own cleverly penned and original songs. And this,
more than  anything else, emphasized not only Kate's unusual vocal range, but
also her unique  presentation of music and the wide emotional depths of the
lyrics to her songs. 
</P>
<P>Once launched, there was no stopping the girl. Her record success continued 
with &quot;The Man With the Child in His Eyes&quot;, which went into the Top 5
in the charts,  and then her second album, &quot;Lionheart&quot;, quickly earned
her a gold disc after jetting  into the charts on its first week of release. 
</P>
<P>She has been referred to as having the fragile beauty of a gazelle. It is
her  stunning looks which undoubtedly add greatly to her vocal performances,
putting  Kate in a completely different category from most other girl singers. 
</P>
<P>She studied, at one time, under the master of mime and dance, Lindsay Kemp, 
and this comes through vividly in most of her on-stage performances. 
</P>
<P>She has a great feeling for the dramatic effect of a song, not only vocally
but  physically, as well. 
</P>
<P>As a child, Kate was encouraged by her parents and family as to the values
of  self-expression. By the time she was eleven, she had taught herself to play
the piano,  and had written her first songs. 
</P>
<P>When she was sixteen, she met David Gilmour, of the Pink Floyd group, and
with  his help made her first demo disc. She was signed up on a recording
contract by  EMI soon afterwards. 
</P>
<P>But she was always more interested in writing songs than singing them, she 
admits. As well as incorporating a great deal f mime into her act, she likes to
fit in a  jigsaw of music, poetry and movement, so that her audiences can relate
to her songs  on more than one level. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm extremely nervous about stage performances,&quot; says Kate. &quot;I've
always b my  capabilities. When I appeared in pubs, singing, before I was well
known, that was  fine. But now, people will expect a certain standard of
performance from me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her fantastic year of success has been based purely on her success in the 
recording studios. It has taken her a long time to pluck up the courage to build
up  her act and go out on the road with a stage show. 
</P>
<P>Her first British tour, in the spring of 1979, meant her stage debut at the 
Palladium in April. 
</P>
<P>It has been said, too, that Kate has worked very hard at creating a public
image.  At times, she talks in a strange slangy accent--which is, quite clearly,
contradictory  to her smooth middle-class upbringing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We always encouraged Kate to write songs, but we never thought for a
minute it  would all turn out as it has done,&quot; says Kate's mother, who is
still very obviously  surprised at her daughter's tremendous success. 
</P>
<P>Says Kate: &quot;I recall that when I was in the school choir, I couldn't
sing high notes  at all. I had to teach myself, as a sort of exercise.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Over the years, she has also become a highly accomplished dancer. 
</P>
<P>Last year, her record success led to her name spreading around the world.
Kate's  records sold not only througout Europe, but in Japan, Australia, Canada
and South  Africa. 
</P>
<P>As well as picking up the Tokyo Music Festival's silver prize, and the
coveted  Dutch Edison Award, she rounded off 1978 by being voted the world's top
female  singer in a poll by Melody Maker readers. 
</P>
<P>So it's not surprising that Kate figured heavily in the British Rock and Pop
 Awards.
