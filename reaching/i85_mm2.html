<P>Fairy Tales &amp; Nursery Rhymes 
</P>
<P>by Ted Nico 
</P>
<P>From Melody Maker Aug. 24, 1985 
</P>
<P>BOXED STATEMENT: After three years in the shadows, the ethereal KATE  BUSH
is back with a hit single and a - wait for it - concept album. Glassy-eyed Ted 
Mico switches on the tape recorder and signs a lot. Photography: Tom Sheehan 
</P>
<P>&quot;Deeper meaning resides in the fairy tales told to me in my childhood
than is the  truth that is taught by life.&quot; - Shiller 
</P>
<P>Just like the phoenix really. ONce every two years she rise out of the ashes
to  once more bestow a touch of mysticism, a hint of myth, and a copious supply
of  inspired vision upon the burned-out landscape we call the chars. 
</P>
<P>She smiles. We shake hands. She's too polite to be a phoenix. Perhaps a
Fairy  Queen? Tommy and I introduce ourselves at the doorway of her dance
studio: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh yes Tom,&quot; she beams, &quot;you're looking better then the last
time I saw you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Young Thomas looks flushed. They're only met once before - three years ago
for  about five minutes. Perhaps she does remember? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh yes, and I've met you before as well,&quot; she smiles. 
</P>
<P>I try to explain this is not the case. Mistaken identity perhaps? I'm damn
sure  I'd remember. But she's adamant. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps it was in another life,&quot; cries a whimsical voice from the
room. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she stares at me, considering the matter thoroughly. &quot;It
must have been in  another life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh deary me. She is serious. She is incredibly cordial. She is unbelievably 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>Over the past two years the name Kate Bush has once more receded to the back
 of the common consciousness, joining the smoldering ember of The Buzzcocks, et
al  - set for the scrapyard. Yet once more she has confounded the rumour-mongers
who  had already pronounced her the Lady Lucan of pop, missing presumed dead.
Once  more she has created an album to besot and bewitch the coldest of hearts.
Once  more she has come out of her isolated refuge with the charm of a siren,
and the  innocence of a child. Ms. Bush is incapable of growing old, she has
merely grown up. 
</P>
<P>But what, you ask, has sister Kate been doing during this hiatus, this
self-imposed  exile? As usual Kate explains much, but reveals precious little,
slamming the doors of  privacy with a single coy look. 
</P>
<P>&quot;After the last album, I had to promote it, and that took me to the end
of '82, so  it hasn't really been that long. My life is quite extreme really; I
go from a very  isolated working situation, to going out and promoting my work
and being very  much a public creature. After you've ben through months of that
kind of  over-exposure, you're left feeling a bit shell-shocked. I need to take
some time off  and go somewhere quite different to write this new album. I
didn't want to produce  it in the wake of The Dreaming.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A wise move. Music vogues move with such alacrity, that two years off can
finish  off a career. In fact, such a time-span is the beginning and the end of
most groups  lifespan! 
</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't really bother thinking about that sort of thing. I spent the
time seeing  films, seeing friends, building my own studio, and doing things I
hadn't had a chance  to do for ages.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Things? You couldn't elaborate on what these strange and wondrous things 
would be. Trout fishing? Hang-gliding? Hamster hunting? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I found an inspirational new dance teacher,&quot; Kate replies with
growing  enthusiasm. &quot;The teacher's energy made me really enthusiastic
about writing again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And once again the conversation turns back to the studio. Kate talks about
her  beloved studio a great deal - a great deal more than she's willing to chat
about  herself. She really doesn't have any hobbies, mainly because they
wouldn't be  beneficial to her work - the subject around which her entire
universe evolves. The  one exception is an avid interest in archery. And even
this she has turned toward  work, with the cover shot of the new single,
believing it to be symbolic of Cupid's  bow - an image which ties the threads of
the single together. 
</P>
<P>And so, naturally, we turn to Kate's new album, Hounds Of Love, and the 
current success of the new single. Another new departure? Another rebirth? 
Another quest for new pastures? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I wanted something new, and to begin with it was extremely
difficult. All  the songs I seemed to write sounded too much like the last
album. I've never seen  any point in repeating things you've already done
before. I think it's a dangerous  thing not to search for new ways of
approaching songs. Too many people sit and  think 'it'll just come to me',
instead of getting off their arses and going for it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate, of course, is far too polite to name names... 
</P>
<P>&quot;If you get out and go for things then those things will come to you. I
think it's  too easy to wait and expect things just to come to you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A certain Mr. M. Thatcher said similar words, but this time they ring with
verity.  Must be her smile. Kate's new studio, hidden away in the overgrown
wilds of Kent,  enable her to exorcise the ghosts of The Dreaming without
sending EMI executives  into prolonged thromboses over the expense of the
operation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The pressure of knowing the astronomical amount studio time cost used
to make  me really nervous about being too creative. You can't experiment
forever, and I  work very, very slowly. I feel a lot more relaxed emotionally
now that I have my own  place to work and a home to go to.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sitting on floor cushions, drinking cups of tea, I can't help thinking if
things got  any more relaxed they'd be sound asleep. Speak more of the new
material Kate.  Speak words of love... 
</P>
<P>&quot;This time I wrote a lot of songs and just chose the best ones to put
on the A side  of the album. I like to think there's not a song there that's
been put there for  padding. Sometimes people get the impression that if you
take a long time over  something that you're literally going over the same piece
again and again, and  instead of making it better, you're making it worse. I
hate to think I've ever done  that. 
</P>
<P>This striving for perfection might well be cause by fears about
disappointing her  audience or her pet cats. The longer the wait, the greater
the expectation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There are always so many voices telling me what to do that you can't
listen to  them. All I ever do is listen to the little voices inside me. I don't
want to disappoint  the little voices that have been so good to me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Of course not. The finely-tuned songs that made the final selection on the
album  differ greatly from the diversions of previous albums. They are all love
songs (sigh)  using elemental imagery that form a cogent and cohesive panoply of
emotion. A  search and struggle to secure some sort of meaning. The discovery
that although you  can strip away everything form a person, there will always be
a residue of love  awaiting resurrection. Sounds mawkish doesn't it? Jane Austin
world have loved it.  All those over expressive vocals and delicate
orchestrations channelled into such  pathos. Sounds risible, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>Yet the songs' style and eloquence rise above bathos through their haunting 
overtones. Phantasmagorical voices tilt the rose-coloured world off its trite
axis with  jagged eerie phrases. Outside observations are slanted metaphors
revealing states of  mind. No longer are we presented with the eclectic collage
of The Dreaming whose  continual shifts and spirals allowed an escape with
diversity. No longer is the entire  story of Houdini crammed into three minutes,
until a new fable takes up the torch.  Now the texture is more subtle, the
production more adroit, and the mesmerism  unrelenting. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The last album contained a lot of different energies. It did take
people to lots of  different places very quickly and some people found that
difficult to take. I think  this album has more of a positive energy. It's a
great deal more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I rather think of the album as two separate sides.&quot; How astute. &quot;The
A side is  really called Hounds of Love, and the B side is called The Ninth
Wave. The B side is  a story, and that took a lot more work - it couldn't be
longer than half an hour, and  it had to flow. This time when you get to the end
of one track, what happens after it  is very affect by what's come before. It's
really difficult to work out the dynamics  within seven tracks. The concept took
a long time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Whoops! There goes that word again. Concept - a word mauled by the memory 
of Floyd, flares, baked lentils and chronic boredom. It took some time to
extract my  nails from the ceiling and climb back down to earth. It took even
longer to summon  up the courage to ask what this concept might entail. Kate
looks upset that I'm not  jumping up and down with ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's about someone who comes off a ship and they've been in the water
all night  by themselves, and it's about that person re-evaluating their life
from a point which  they've never been before. It's about waking up from things
and being reborn -  going through something and coming out the other side very
different.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sounds suspiciously like The Ancient Mariner revisited... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh no! It's completely different. It ends really positively - as
things always should  if you have control.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And Kate certainly has that. From the writing, recording, performing,
production  of her tunes to the choreography on the accompanying video. As usual
the visual  imagery is gleaned from a wide variety of sources: from the films of
Godard, Herzog  and Coppola, to The Book Of Dreams, yet their accretion with
Kate's own personal  fears and desires is shrouded in mystery. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There are many films that you don't think much of at the time, but
weeks  afterwards you get flashbacks of images. Sometimes films like Don't Look
Now and  Kagemusha have really haunted me. You don't necessarily steal images
from films,  but they are very potent and take you somewhere else - somewhere
impossible to  get to without that spark.&quot; 
</P>
<P>At this moment it is difficult to see how such a placid, genteel, and
downright  normal musician could ever produce songs like &quot;Get Out Of My
House&quot; and &quot;Sat In  Your Lap&quot;. Perhaps some strange
transformation takes place over when she is asleep! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I have very strange dreams you know. Over the years I've
collected the  most incredible star cast of them. Very famous people come and
visit me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Curiouser and curiouser... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Peter O'Toole came round to dinner last week and my mum met him and 
thought he was wonderful. Keith Moon often comes round for tea as well. I have a
 lot of vivid dreams, most of which I can't mention. The images I get from them 
sometimes bleed into my songs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Most of Kate's heroes like Oscar Wilde, The Pythons, Roxy Music, Billie
Holiday  and Hitchcock have all visited her, but her mum didn't like Hitchcock -
maybe she  was just frightened by him? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hitchcock was definitely a genius. His dreams must have been
extraordinary. He  must have plucked his ideas out of the sky, or had a private
line to Mars.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Slowly, very slowly we're edging closer to the point were the musician and
her  music bisect. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think some people use music as a means of expressing what they feel
about  things which they can't express socially. I don't really know why people
think my  songs are strange. Perhaps because I bathe in goat's milk!! It not
something you  should really ask me. My mom could probably help you more. It's
probably  something to do with my childhood.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I met Kate's mum in one of her dreams last Tuesday, but she didn't tell me 
much either. The door slams shut again. Perhaps a choice of character from the 
scrolls of history might reveal more. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I would want to be Breugal, definitely&quot;. Things are starting to
come into focus.  Only a fool would have predicted Florence Nightingale - and
Kate is nobody's fool. 
</P>
<P>&quot;His work is so real, and yet depicted in a fantastic way. It's so
beautiful and  elemental. And his faces are so haunting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Things seemed to be going well - very well, until quite suddenly, just as
Kate was  recounting her favourite fairy tales, she comes over all unnecessary.
Lights flash,  Kate wilts, and her world starts to spin in the opposite
direction as everyone else's. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm terribly sorry about this, but I keep feeling worse and worse, and
I don't  know whether I can talk properly any more.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her companion calls it overwork, the doctor calls it a severe migraine. We
call it a  day. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know what's come over me,&quot; she says - embarrassed. We
shake hands.  She smiles. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure we'll see each other again very soon.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yes Kate I sure hope we will. Probably in another life. 
</P>
<P>We exited, floating through the nearest wall.
