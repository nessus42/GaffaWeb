Smash Hits May 1980 by Deanne Pearson 
</P>
<P>&lt;This interview was conducted by Deanne Pearson in May 1980 for Smash
Hits,  which was then what it is now--a rather silly fan-magazine directed at
children of  about thirteen to seventeen. The tone of the interview reflects
this, and may not be  a very accurate record of the actual conversation. There
are still some points of  interest, however.&gt; 
</P>
<P> The Me Inside 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush lets Deanne Pearson in on her secrets. 
</P>
<P> Is that really Kate Bush walking across the cafeteria of EMI's Abbey Road 
Studios? I have to look twice to make sure. 
</P>
<P>She's much smaller than I imagined, and dressed casually in jeans, colourful
 blouse and cardigan. Wearing little make-up, she looks about fourteen years old
but  she moves with all the grace and confidence of a trained dancer and
experienced  performer--which of course she is. 
</P>
<P>Smiling warmly, she sits down with an orange juice and lemonade. She rarely 
drinks alcohol, she tells me, and thinks most people who do just lack
confidence. I  put down my lager and order a coke. 
</P>
<P>The Abbey Road Studios are famous in connection with the Beatles, in
particular  their Abbey Road album. In the foyer a large picture of Paul
McCartney welcomes  visitors. Next to it, and just as prominent, is a picture of
Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>The studios are like a second home to Kate at the moment. She's been working
 virtually non-stop here for the last few months--apart from some session work
with  Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper (for his album The Unknown Soldier ). 
</P>
<P>Kate is working on her third album, which is now scheduled for end-of-June 
release. When asked about it, however, she is understandably hesitant. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's difficult to talk about the album without you actually hearing
it,&quot; she  explains, in a voice so quiet I worry the tape recorder won't
pick it up. &quot;I suppose  it's more like the first album, The Kick Inside ,
though, than the second, Lionheart ,  in that the songs are telling stories. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I like to see things with a positive direction, because it makes it so
much easier  to communicate with the audience or listener. When you see people
actually  listening to the songs and getting into them, it makes you realise how
important it is  that the songs should actually be saying something.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The lyrics on her two previous albums are mainly concerned with love, sex
and  relationships. Simple and common subject matter, I suggest, safe and
uncontroversial.  &lt;Incest not controversial? Explicit descriptions of coitus
not controversial? OK...&gt; 
</P>
<P>Kate rightly points out, however, that her lyrics do go into the psychology
of  relationships, and analyse what lies under that superficial banner of &quot;love&quot;,
 which--no matter how common a theme--is still very important to a lot of
people. 
</P>
<P>Her new album, however, is exploring different avenues. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There are a lot of different songs,&quot; she says. &quot;There's no
specific theme, but  they're saying a lot about freedom, which is very important
to me.&quot; Which is why  Kate is also producing the album herself this time,
helped by John Kelly, who  produced The Kick Inside and Lionheart . &lt;False.
Andrew Powell produced The  Kick Insied , and Kelly was assisted by Kate on the
production of Lionheart .&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It means I have more control over my album, which is going to make it
more  rounded, more complete--more me, I hope.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her latest, fifth, single is very different from anything Kate has done
before, and  different from anything on the album, she says. Breathing is a
dramatic statement  about the very real dangers of a possible nuclear disaster
in our world. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's about a baby still in the mother's womb, at a time of nuclear
fallout, but it's  more of a spiritual being,&quot; Kate explains, gesticulating
with her hands, drawing a  picture in the air to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It has all its senses: sight, smell, touch, taste and hearing; and it
knows what is  going on outside the mother's womb. And yet it wants desperately
to carry on living,  as we all do, of course. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Nuclear fallout is something we're all aware of, and worried about
happening in  our lives, and it's something we should all take time to think
about. We're all  innocent, none of us deserves to be blown up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The hopelessness and pointlessness of nuclear fallout is conveyed also in
the  haunting, ominous melody which swirls forlornly around Kate's familiar
crying  vocals. The lyrics are short but to the point, while in the background
an  officious-sounding broadcast instructs its nation what to do. 
</P>
<P>It seems strange to hear Kate singing about politics, something I associate
more  with fighting, militant bands such as the Clash and the Stranglers. 
</P>
<P>Kate is so slight and demure, an extremely artistic person whose aims seem
more  concerned with entertaining people by taking them away from the outside
world and  its problems, even if only for an hour or two. 
</P>
<P>Hers seems a comfortable, almost fairytale success story. Discovered by EMI 
Records at the age of sixteen, she was sponsored for a couple of years, writing,
 during which time she continued learning to dance, perform and project herself.

</P>
<P>&quot;I think from the outside it does look as if it's been very easy for
me--if you  believe what the media say. But in fact it hasn't. Everyone
thinks--knows, because  it's true--that you need that lucky break, but what
really counts is the  determination that has to be there in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Basically it all comes down to personality. You have to be very strong
to get  where you want in this business. I mean, some people have been going
ages, like  Elkie Brooks. She's amazing (n.b.: the only time in an hour's
conversation that Kate  uses that word). 
</P>
<P>&quot;Elkie's been knocked down so many times, and yet she always gets up
and fights  back. It's the same with me. Because I want to keep going, I can. I
don't deny that  I've been lucky, though.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The determination, just as important as the talent, has always been there, 
probably even before Kate learnt to play the piano at the age of eight. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Instead of going out to play with other children I used to play the
piano--it was  my way of talking, of expressing myself.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate admits she was a fairly solitary child who didn't have many friends,
and I  wonder if she still is a bit of a loner. It seems rather an odd question
when picturing  the self-assured performer onstage--but what about offstage,
away from it all? Is she  much of a socialite? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, I don't go to parties much. The last one must have been, ooh,
Christmas, I  suppose. When I get home I tend to sleep--especially at the
moment, because I've  been working too hard; or I clean up--wash-up and hoover.
I find that very  therapeutic. When I've got a lot on my mind I like to get away
to something totally  non-taxing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I see friends whenever possible, too, and watch television, because
that's  something you can just switch off when you've had enough.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She laughs at having to relate such run-of-the-mill things to prove she's  &quot;normal&quot;.

</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not a star,&quot; she says adamantly. &quot;My name is, but not
me. I'm still just me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate has been criticised for being too pretentious onstage--for not being
herself.  Patiently she explains what she thinks the critics have missed. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I am onstage, I'm performing, yes, and yes, I'm projecting. And
to do  these things well, I have to be big--&quot; (she stretches her small,
slender frame upright  to demonstrate) &quot;--and bold, and full of confidence.
And I am, but--&quot; (and she  plumps down in her seat again), &quot;--it's
still little me inside.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her performance, she says, is not contrived, it's how how she feels at the
time. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I mean, you can't go onstage and simper, and be timid and shy,&quot;
she continues.  &quot;You've got to be big and strong, and give your audience
everything you've got;  reveal your emotions: be romantic, transport them into
another world, so they're in  tune with you. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That requires an awful lot of hard work, and an almost calculated
force, I  suppose, in that you know what you're doing. But it does come
naturally. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Bands that do nothing, that just go out and perform their basic
function, play  their latest album, or sing it, or whatever, and then just walk
off, are boring. You  have to keep your audience's attention all the way, to be
a success.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Which is why Kate Bush is a success. Her onstage performance is an extension
of  her songs. Through her movements she expresses the mood of her songs. They
can  be fast and lively, or angry, perhaps slow and sad, or maybe romantic. 
</P>
<P>Because she is so involved, her audience become involved and her show
becomes  an art form in itself. A logical extension to this, Kate feels, would
be to make a  concept album and a show to go with it, so the whole thing becomes
a concept in  one. 
</P>
<P>But that's very much in the future at the moment. &lt;It's still very much
in the  future.&gt; As we walk out of the studios after the interview, she
blinks in the sunlight  and looks round in mock amazement at what is left of the
day. Working in the  studios till two or three most mornings has been going on a
bit too long, she feels. 
</P>
<P>The first think Kate Bush would like to do after completing the album is
take a  holliday.
