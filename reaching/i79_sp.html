<P>&quot;Fruit And Nut Kate&quot;<BR> October 20, 1979</P>
<P>EVER wondered how the delicious Kate Bush  manages to keep her curves in the
right places  in all those tight leotards the lady leaps around  stage in?</P>
<P>Well, it's all down to what the lady eats, which  apparently isn't vary much
anyway, but when she  does feel peckish, there's nothing Miss Bush likes to 
bite into better than a nut cutlet, some raw vegetables  or a chunk of cheese,
'cos shapely Kate is a strict  vegetarian.</P>
<P>However, that's not to say she isn't partial to the odd  bar of choccy, and
on her recent tour her mother  would turn up at rehearsals with a huge bag
containing  fruit, nuts and countless Kit Kats -- Kate's favourite brand  of
choccy bar.</P>
<P>Despite the pressures of a pop packed life this little  lady somehow manages
to find the time to do all her  housework herself.</P>
<P>Explains Kate &quot;Unless the flat is tidy I just can't get  on with my
songwriting.</P>
<P>&quot;There's just no way I can sit down at the piano  when in the kitchen
there's a sinkful of washing up.&quot; </P>
