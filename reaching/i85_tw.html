<P>&quot;Kate Bush breaks out: Bush's bridges&quot; 
</P>
<P>By James Marck 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is a self-styled mystery woman who reveals all by not revealing 
anything. Whether she's peeking out from behind her persona as an exquisite 
sensualist or sketching elaborate allegories with sound and imagery, she
presents a  figure of formidable artistry. 
</P>
<P>She is seldom seen, yet pervasive--the gold standard among conceptual 
musicians--artist, interpreter and executor of her personal vision. In a world
sullied  by pedestrian struggles, Bush has sought to re-create it into a nicer,
more exotic  place. 
</P>
<P>Bush's entry into pop music has Cinderella overtones. In her middle teens, a
 fledgling composer at the piano, she was discovered by Pink Floyd guitarist
David  Gilmour, who listened to and liked a demo tape. He propelled her toward
the right  people and in April of 1978 she released &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;,
a debut that found a hit  in the single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Since
then, Bush has made five LPs, including  her latest and most lauded for its
crossover sensibility, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. In the  interim she has piled
up a sizable following of dedicated fans and a larger reputation  as an
avant-pop imprimatur--you may not have heard her, but you likely have heard  of
her. 
</P>
<P>Since her introduction, Bush has toured only once. She made a video of it
and  released an EP commemorating the event. She will likely not play a string
of live  engagements in the next year. &lt;Read &quot;next five years&quot;--IED.&gt;
She maintains she  loves to perform to an audience but can't find the time
between albums to properly  mount the production to her exacting standards. She
prefers the expediency of video  and as if to compensate for her reclusiveness
as a performer lavishes them with style  and attention to detail. 
</P>

<P>&quot;Parallel entities&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I love the idea of combining music and visuals. I think they are
parallel entities.  So far I've only made videos--apart from the tour video--for
singles in a  promotional-clip format. But 'The Ninth Wave'&quot;--the b-side of
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot;,  featuring seven interrelated songs--&quot;in many
ways was conceived to be turned into a  film, so that's something I've been
thinking about.&quot; &lt;This idea was never  realized--IED.&gt; &quot;It may
be extended to even an hour, but again, that's a huge  commitment, but it
definitely attracts me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is perhaps Bush's most cohesive album to date,
and one of the  most elaborate, with synth, Fairlight and piano crushed into
twelve tracks sporting  new rhythmic authority. She has woven in voice under
bridges and her  now-trademark &quot;atmospheric&quot; synth lines to create
mini-melodramas that focus on  relationships, life and love, this time coming
through the fire tempered and stronger  from the flames. In a sense, all her
songs are some kind of lovesong, but here  especially they aren't limited to
girl-meets-boy stuff. It's more  girl-meets-the-world-and-wins-her-place-in-it,
all carrried along and buoyed up by  her distinctive, flutey treble. 
</P>

<P>&quot;Very unhappy&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;On this album I wanted to get away from the energy of the last one--at
the time  I was very unhappy, I felt that mankind was really screwing things up.
Having  expressed all that, I wanted this album to be different--a positive
album, just a  personal but more about the good things. A lot depends on how you
feel at any given  time--it all comes out in the music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush has wholly produced her last two LPs, gradually taking the reins over
the  course of her career. She is not unaware of the critical risk she is taking
by going it  alone. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Artists say that they are the best equipped to produce themselves, but
there's  quite a bit of pressure from those who say the artist is exactly the
wrong person to  produce. I think that makes anyone very wary of taking that on.
You get labelled  with all kinds of heavy things like 'self-indulgent' and
'egotistic'. I think you have  to be quite brave to make that leap. 
</P>
<P>&quot;At the same time, I don't like the idea of people saying this is the
way you write  music--this is the way you produce a record. I feel that 'art' is
one of those things  that should have absolutely no rules at all. In fact, the
rules that are already laid  down I feel like deliberately breaking, to try what
they say you can't do. I think  really the approach is something you continually
experiment with--you try and find  the best way of expressing something well.&quot;

</P>
<P>Conversing with Bush (she is here for a day to promote &quot;Hounds&quot;, a
job she has  been doing internationally since July) you can't avoid the
impression that  extemporaneous remarks are not her favourite way to make her
statement. Not that  she is ill-at-ease or closed-mouthed about her views or
activities, quite the contrary.  She's mannerly, friendly and attentive, with a
disarming smile nand poised,  confident bearing. If you've ever wondered what
sort of person might be called  winsome, you could look it up in the
dictionary--or look up Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>But in spite of her easygoing and cooperative manner, or more accurately,
behind  it, there resides a sense of insecurity, something of a desire to get
out of the  limelight and back to her newly constructed home studio where she
can polish off  the rough edges before they can be detected. 
</P>

<P>&quot;Talk touring&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush prefers to be seen as a fully-formed, unflawed artist, with none of the
 lingering self-doubt of someone who has come up in the world without having
been  too sorely tried by it. In that sense, she is still very much the
debutante she was  seven years and five albums ago. Talking about the tour still
leaves her excited by  her encounter with the sometimes unpredictable nature of
live performing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was a fantastic experience,&quot; she says, &quot;and so totally
different from everything  else for me. There's a wonderful sense of freedom
because there's no way you  could go back and do a bit over because it wasn't as
good as it should be the first  time. You have to learn how to cope if something
goes wrong, and I found that really  exciting. I really started to get into
that--there's so many things that can go wrong  on stage, especially if it's a
show that you've choreographed to get the best total  effect. But what is
particularly exhilarating is after having worked so hard to get it  all
together, you have the audience out there really reacting to what you're doing.

</P>
<P>&quot;You can't help but be a little bitten by the performance bug because
of what it  does to you. All those people out there are so into what you're
doing they just  charge you up--there's no buzz like it. I totally understand
why people would tour  forever. It's very tiring, but it feels so good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>While Bush may have been tittilated by the excitement of that experience,
she  still isn't ready to repeat it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a matter of priorities. A tour can only realistically be done if
you've put  pieces of music on a record with as much care as possible and then
do a show of  that. It all comes from the songwriting, so the problem there is
commitment and  time. It's not that I don't want to do it, and I love the idea
that people want me to  tour, but it's highly unlikely at this point--it's
something I can't even check out  until sometime next year when I've got all
this stuff out of the way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;This stuff&quot; refers to her promotional tour, which will likely go
into the new year,  and further video work. Her latest video, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;,
is a carefully scripted  work that among other treats has Donald Sutherland in a
principal role. 
</P>

<P>&quot;Dance piece&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;When the song also really works with the video that's great. That's
only  happened to me a couple of times--I think the last two videos are good&quot;--&quot;Hounds
 of Love&quot; and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, respectively &lt;this is incorrect:
the two videos to which  Kate refers are &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;;
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was  not shot until December of 1985--IED&gt;--&quot;especially
the last one. That was so  appropriate, and the one before was really a piece of
dance, so we got away easy  with that one. There have been a couple in the past
as well, but I don't really like to  have to make videos for a specific single
unless it's a very visual song or tells a  strong story. I think my ideal way of
working would be to treat the whole thing as a  complete entity--not to just
stick pictures to a song whether they go together or not.  I would like to
eplore the combination of the two more in the future.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush says that as a composer she has benefited greatly by such musical tools
as  the Fairlight and Emulator, both computerized musical instruments. She can
work  out arrangements more accurately with more realistic sounds and test her
theories  before commiting them to other musicians. She says it's the best thing
to happen to  her since the drum machine. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You have a whole barrage of different sounds that can spark off ideas
and really  develop the final arrangements. I consider myself very lucky because
I'm a  keyboard player, and it seems like the best advances in musical
instruments have  been keyboard instruments. I can't write music out &lt;Kate is
being modest here--she  did indeed notate the six-line string parts for the
Medici Quartet while recording  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;--IED&gt;, so I've
always had to use the spoken word to communicate  my ideas. Now I can compose
parts I never could before at the keyboard--it lets you  get so much closer to
the whole song. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The whole process of writing anyway is a very insular one, whether you
write  books or poetry or songs. It's an intimate form of expression--a private
thing, a  solitary occupation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;For me, it all started with tinkering around with the piano at the age
of ten or  eleven. That sort of grew into songs, and my voice got better as I
worked it through  the songs. Then I went through the studio environment, and by
the time I had got  that far I realized that the studio had such a big effect on
a song that if I wanted to  be in control totally, I would have to produce it
too. Then came the visual side,  which for me in many ways is the performance
aspect. All of these elements are  extensions of being a songwriter, and that is
what I consider myself to be.&quot;
