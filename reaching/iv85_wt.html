(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Old Grey Whistle Test November (?) 1985 interview 
</P>
<P>83. The Old Grey Whistle Test: Kate is interviewed about Cloudbusting, and
the  video is shown, on U.K. TV, November (?) 1985. 
</P>
<P>As in most of her televised interviews from 1985 and later, Kate is here
very  much more on guard against patronizing or silly questions from her
interviewers,  and sticks to a set of carefully phrased and relatively formal
replies. She projects a  far more mature and reserved persona than in earlier
years, contrasting sharply with  the foolishness of her hosts. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED] 
</P>
<P>I: [Reading the chart list] And after seventeen weeks in the chart,
Madonna's Like  A Virgin, is brand new at number one even... [sputters]
replacing Kate Bush -  I'm going to pieces [laughs] Kate Bush who by a tragic
coincidence is next to me.  I'm sorry you're number 2 this week, Kate. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think that's pretty good myself! 
</P>
<P>I: It's better then being number 3, you're right. What do you feel about
Madonna  and her sort of - the marketing of the image like that. It seems very
different to  the way you've gone about things. 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know much about Madonna. I saw her on Live Aid and I thought she
was  really good. 
</P>
<P>I: She's definitely a good artist, it's true, but she's seems to have gone
for the sort  of sex symbol approach to success. [Kate smiles sweetly] We'll
talk about your  album - I can tell there's a look on your face. [Both laugh]
You're a very  determined girl, you went away on your own terms to make this LP,
didn't you? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I wanted to make sure that we got own studio together. That was the
next  move, really. I spent a lot of time on the last album moving from studio
to studio  and now we've got our own place and everything is brilliant, it makes
such a  difference. 
</P>
<P>I: Is it difficult choosing the right sort of gear to put in there, the
right people to  work with in that studio, and the location, of course? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's really good, because you can get everything you want in one
studio,  which isn't always easy in a London studio. 
</P>
<P>I: What were you looking for, what makes your studio special for you? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, it's got all the environmental things that we want - the right kind
of  sounding rooms and we've got all the outboard equipment and the right kind
of  speakers and everything. It's what we want, which is why we did it. [Laughs]

</P>
<P>I: You say &quot;we&quot; all the time, it's very much though a very solo
sort of thing. I mean,  you've produced the thing, you've written the thing.
Even though you have other  musicians playing on it, you're calling the shots,
aren't you? 
</P>
<P>K: I'm in control, but there's no way I could do it by myself. I rely on
very good  engineers and musicians and people around me to advise me. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, how do you keep tabs on whether you're loosing track on reality? You
know,  whether you're getting to self-indulgent? 
</P>
<P>K: You mean, in context of an album? 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>K: I think you just have to rely on a voice inside you saying that it's
getting better  and everything that you do to it does make it better and not
worse. 
</P>
<P>I: Actually a lot of critics have felt, well the ones I've seen, that there
are some very,  very commercial bits in this as well, that maybe you were aware
that the last LP  perhaps did go away from the mainstream a bit. Do you agree
with them? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't feel it went away from the mainstream. Whenever you make an
album,  you just do it and you hope all the songs are good and that you're
trying to  express what you want at that time. And I felt that I've done that,
certainly with  the last three albums. 
</P>
<P>I: Let's talk about a track on this LP. You've done a video, now whether it
means  it's going to be a single at some stage we don't know as yet. It's called
 &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. And a rather unusual story behind the song. So can
you tell us  the story to set up the video that we're going to see. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. It was very much inspired by a book that I found on a shelf about
nine years  ago and it's written by a man called Peter Reich and the book's
called A Book  Of Dreams. And it's very much written from a child's point of
view about his  father... 
</P>
<P>I: You see the book in the video if you're clever. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes! Don't blink or you'll miss it. [Both laugh] And it's really about
the magic of  that relationship and how much his father meant to him. And they
have a very  special thing they can do, they go up onto a hill with a machine
that his father's  built and they make it rain. 
</P>
<P>I: We will see the story now in the video, which we ought to watch closely.
Watch  the people performing in this. This is the video then, for the &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
 track from Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is shown.] 
</P>
<P>I2: Kate Bush and &quot;Cloudbusting.&quot; Rather obviously, Donald
Sutherland! How did you  get him to be in your video? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, we rang him up and said &quot;would you be interested&quot; and he
said yes! 
</P>
<P>I2: And what was he... what was he like to work with? I think that is the
question. 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] I think that is the question. He was brilliant, absolutely
brilliant. And he  was such a help to me as well. Fantastic! A real honour to
work with him. 
</P>
<P>I2: And that's the new single as well, isn't it. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it is. 
</P>
<P>I2: Okay, Thanks for coming in.
