Kate Bush article in Rock World Mag Oct. 1993 
</P>
<P>Browsing through the magaizne racks at the local newsagents I saw Kate's
face  on the front of a magazine called Rock World (Issue 19, Vol 2, Oct.).
There is a  3 page article inside which includes a piece by Paddy Bush
describing Kate and the  making of The Red Shoes. There are a few black and
white pics. 
</P>
<P>I don't have time to type in the whole article at the moment but there are a
few  interesting tidbits from Paddy. For example: 
</P>
<P>&quot;People always ask if we are ever going to do any more live shows. The
answer is  that it's certainly possible ... and in fact we talked about doing it
recently. We even  had a few rehearsals earlier in the year so it's definitely
something in the head, but  then Kate got involved in the idea of a film to go
with the album .... all plans for live  shows have gone out the window for the
time being.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Mind you, Paddy also says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;She doesn't really spend any longer on albums than anyone else ...&quot;

</P>
<P>and 
</P>
<P>&quot;Believe it or not she actually writes very quickly.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The article also has an &quot;interesting top ten which it calls Kate Bush's
finest hours  and which has Babooshka at number 1 and The Dreaming at number 2.

</P>
<P>Kate and the new album are also mentioned in the mag's news section where 
they suugest the new album will take up residence at the top of the charts for
the  remainder of the year [if it ever gets released - nbc]. Also, that &quot;sources&quot;
claim that  it includes at least three smash hit singles. 
</P>
<P>I wil post the full article if time permits and if no one else wants to do
it first.

Rock World article on Kate 
</P>
<P>Here is the Rock World article (Issue 10, Vol.2, Oct. 1993). 
</P>
<P>Enjoy. Neil 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>KATE BUSH is back with a sensational new album 'The Red Shoes', her first of
 this decade. She's been a major figure for 17 years now, but still few people
know  what makes her tick or indeed what her songs are about. Kate isn't saying,
so  COLIN IRWIN speculates, while her brother PADDY, who's played on all her 
albums, offers his own insights. 
</P>
<P>It's an event. A major, MAJOR event when Kate Bush releases a new album 
these days. New releases from Kate have become rarer than a sighting of the
dodo. 
</P>
<P>The new album 'The Red Shoes' has been threatened for three years, but even 
by Kate's own tortuous standards, it's been a painful one. Personal problems, 
including the death of her mother, permeated the recording...and it shows. 
</P>
<P>It is a brilliant album. An album that features the likes of Eric Clapton,
Jeff Beck  and, most extraordinarily, Prince. But it is also an album that is
acutely depressing,  Kate's voice swooping and soaring dizzily through a heavy
barrage of complex  emotional puzzles dwelling on farewells and traumatic
affairs. If we can ever read  any personal outpourings in Bush's music,
traditionally based on literature and wild,  offbeat scenarios, then she's had a
shattering of the heart in these lost years, too. 
</P>
<P>Of course you can never be sure. She's always used her passion for fiction
and  escapism through drama and theatre as a way of camouflaging any reference
to her  own personal life in her music. And if anyone gets too curious about
where the two  may intermingle, then Kate ain't telling. Her interviews are few
and far between  and are legendary in the total lack of any revelations
whatsoever. You come away  from a meeting with Kate giggling, charmed, probably
madly in love, and you  couldn't care less that she's told you absolutely
nothing about herself. Yet her songs  have always held such mysteries and hidden
depths, you can scarcely credit the  person and the artist as occupying the same
skin. But then that's the glorious  enigma of Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>So 'The Red Shoes' maintains the tradition, and further fuels the myth and
the  mystery, taking its title and inspiration from an old Thirties movie and
using subtle  imagery and elusive lyrical reference points to counterpoint the
intense passion she  conjures up on virtually every track. 
</P>
<P>The single - and opening track - 'Rubberband Girl' is a red herring,
deceptively  bouncy and dance-oriented. Whatever anyone throws at her, she zings
right back,  she sings brightly over a thunderous backing. She lies. The rest of
the album is a  firmament of distress that leaves you floored, even when Prince
joins the throng for  an excellent bout of light relief. It makes you worry
about exactly what she has been  through in the lost years. Oh them heavy
people...

<H2>MY BRILLIANT SISTER </H2>
<P>by PADDY BUSH 
</P>
<P>The thing about Kate is that she wants everything to be absolutely right.
When  she writes a song she hears it in her head exactly how she wants it to
sound and  she'll go to any lengths to get it to sound like that and won't
accept anything else.  It's very hard for people to understand and everyone
always wants to know why it's  so long between albums, but it's just that
perfectionism, that idea she has and not  being able to stop until she gets it
exactly right. She's painstaking in the studio and I  know it can be frustrating
for people, but she's right. It's the reason why she's  always so original and
distinctive. She has a vision of what she wants to achieve with  a piece of
music and she will not be deflected from it. 
</P>
<P>It has been a difficult couple of years for Kate. For all of us. We've had
personal  upsets to deal with. Our mother died and we were all close to her, so
that was hard  and knocked us all sideways. I think we're all still recovering
from that. 
</P>
<P>To my mind the quality of the music justifies everything. People imagine
Kate is  this terrible paranoid creature, neurotic and full of hang-ups, but
she's not like that  at all. They think she's reclusive because she doesn't do a
lot of press and  promotion and isn't seen out and about, but she leads a
regular life and believes the  only thing interesting about her is the music.
That's the only thing that sets her  apart from anybody else and it's the one
part of her life she feels comfortable  discussing in public. I know this may
give her a mystique and make the press all the  more curious about her, but
that's not the intention, it's not 'a ploy to get her more  attention. She
genuinely doesn't see why people should be interested in her personal  life and
she certainly doesn't like going out to clubs or trendy restaurants, it's just 
not her. So you never see anything about her in the gossip columns or much about
 her between records. 
</P>
<P>That's just the way it is with her, and that's partly the reason why it
seems there  are long periods when she's not doing anything. She doesn't really
spend any longer  on albums than anyone else, it just seems that way because she
doesn't go off on big  promotional tours like most artists, so it looks like
she's completely disappeared. She  just prefers to spend that time on her music.
Believe it or not she actually writes  very quickly. Once she has an idea for a
song she writes fast - she's brilliant like  that. What takes the time is all
the other bits that go with it, realising what she has  visualised in music in
the studio - and that can be a slow process. She will never  settle for
second-best. 
</P>
<P>She is open to suggestions and ideas, however. As well as playing, I'm an 
instrument maker and I'm interested in lots of different kinds of music. Using
the  Trio Bulgarka on the last record came about after I'd started playing her
that stuff.  They're on the new one too. She's always interested in using
different styles and  cultures...like the aborigine influence on 'The Dreaming',
on which we had Roll  Harris playing didgeridoo. He was lovely, too, one of the
nicest guys I've met and a  great talent - that whole idea of being able to draw
and then play a tune to go with  it is fantastic. He taught us to play
didgeridoo! Roger Whittaker's another lovely guy,  and a great whistler, though
it's hard to get him to whistle - he seems embarrassed  about it. And I've
fallen in love with music from Madagascar and I've been playing  a lot of that
stuff to Kate, and we've got that influence on the new album 'The Red  Shoes'. 
</P>
<P>We always had music all around us since we were kids. The family is Irish so
 we'd always be going across to Ireland and we had Irish music in the house all
the  time. I went on the road with the Irish fiddle player Kevin Burke and Kate
moved  on to the piano and started writing songs. I always knew she was special
and the  songs were great. She was signed to EMI for a couple of years before
the first album  came out and that was a very exciting time for all of us and,
of course, it all took off  from there. And we did the live dates, as well,
which were brilliant. 
</P>
<P>People always ask if we are ever going to do any more live shows. The answer
is  that it's certainly possible. It's not something that we've ever discounted
and in fact  we talked about doing it recently. We even had a few rehearsals
earlier in the year  so it's definitely something in the head, but then Kate got
involved in the idea of a  film to go with the album and she's been so busy on
that all plans for live shows  have gone out of the window for the time being. 
</P>
<P>The film is gonna be mega. It's such an ambitious project because it has
involved  Kate in all sorts of things...writing scripts, editing all the music,
directing. That's her  thing. Mine's running around playing obscure instruments
with foreign musicians.  Kate's is very much film and art. She's done a few
things with the Comic Strip  people, which she loves doing. We've got Lenny
Henry singing on one track on the  new album. I'm still a very big fan of Kate's
music, she always manages to surprise  you, but she's still capable of producing
the sweetest simplicity. Like 'Army  Dreamers', which is one of my favourites of
all the stuff she's done - it's a model of  simplicity. 
</P>
<P>But I must say I think the new album is the best thing she's ever done. It
was a  hard one to make, but it's a good one.

<H2>KATE BUSH - THE LIFE STORY! </H2>
<P> Catherine Bush was born in Bexleyheath, Kent on July 30, 1958. 
</P>
<P>After a recommendation from Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd, Kate was signed to 
EMI in 1974. 
</P>
<P>EMI decided to nurture their new 16 year-old and invest in her long-term
future,  delaying release of any material. Kate, meanwhile, took dance and mime
lessons, and  played gigs under the name the K.T.Bush Band (with brother Paddy
and boyfriend  Del Palmer on bass) around the South London pub circuit. The
first Bush single  'Wuthering Heights', inspired by the Emily Bronte novel, was
released in March,  '78 and became a Number One hit. 
</P>
<P>The success of the single was followed by the release of the first album
'The  Kick Inside', which shocked audiences with its eccentric vocal approach
and its  unusual song matter. 
</P>
<P>After a string of hit singles, Kate embarked on her first and (so far) only
tour in  the spring of '79 - a two and a half hour show full of experimental
dance, theatre  and choreograph routines. 
</P>
<P>Kate became one of the pioneers of video with her imaginative promo films at
 the turn of the Eighties and also established herself as one of rock's most
visionary  thinkers with her brilliant 'Never For Ever' album. 
</P>
<P>After a long silence, Kate returned in '85 with the acclaimed 'Hounds Of
Love'  album, including the hit jingles 'Running Up That Hill' and
'Cloudbusting', with a  video starring Donald Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>She had a hit duetting with Peter Gabriel on the hit single 'Don't Give Up'
in  '86 - continuing a partnership that had been established on Gabriel's 'Games
 Without Frontiers'. 
</P>
<P>A compilation album 'The Whole Story' hit the top of the album charts in '87
 while Bush also won a Brits Award as best female artist. 
</P>
<P>A new album 'The Sensual World' was issued in '89 and reaffirmed Kate's 
image as one of the deepest - and most mysterious - superstars on the planet. 
</P>
<P>In lack of a new album, EMI issued a compilation LP 'This Woman's Work' in 
1990, while Kate appeared at a fan club convention to announce that a brand new 
album would be out soon and that she'd be touring to promote it. 
</P>
<P>Further bulletins about the imminent arrival of the new album continued for
the  next three years without any evidence, while Kate continued to pop up
occasionally  on comedy shows and other people's albums. 
</P>
<P>At last the new Kate Bush album 'The Red Shoes' is released and it's fab!
