uli@zoodle.robin.de (Ulrich Grepel) <BR> Subject: Kate article in German
magazine 'Max', issue 11/1993 
</P>
<P>Another German magazine, Max, has a Kate Bush article in the November 1993 
issue. Again I've already transcribed but not yet translated it. This will
follow as  soon as I have time. 
</P>
<P>Bye, Uli 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Look at least at the discography, it's something between funny and 
annoying! 
</P>
<P>Artikel aus 'Max, November - 11/93' 
</P>
<P>1 Seite. Zwei Bilder aus dem (ersten) Rubberband Girl video (Kate in 
Zwangsjacke und Kate auf dem Trampolin) sowie ein Bild mit Kate mit Hut (siehe 
auch me-sounds 11-93). 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>von Britta Weitholz 
</P>
<P>Sie gehoert zuer britischen Musikszene wie klebrige Toertchen zum 
Fuenfuhrtee. Seitdem Kate Bush mit &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; 1978 die
internationalen  Charts stuermte, ist die angelsaechsische Musiklandschaft um
einen  ernstzunehmenden Top-Act reicher. Das aktuelle Album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;
(EMI) ist  der siebte Streic der inzwischen 35jaehrigen Ausnahmevocalistin. 
</P>
<P>Ihre Karriere beginnt so bilderbuchig, wie man es sich kaum anders
vorstellen  kann: Mit suessen sechzehn wird Kate Bush, Tochter einer Irin und
eines  Landarztes aus Plumstead, von Pink Floyds Gitarrenmastermind David
Gilmour  hoechstpersoenlich entdeckt und gefoerdert. Er verschafft dem jungen
Klaviertalent  einen paradiesischen Vertrag beim Majorlabel EMI: Drei Jahre lang
darf sie auf  Kosten der Plattenfirma Tanz- und Gesangsunterricht nehmen, bevor
der  Studiotermin fuer das furiose Debuet &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; ansteht.
Die  aussergewoehnlich hohe Stimmlage wird zum Markenzeichen des schuechternen 
Teenagers. Mit sehnsuchtsvollen Liebesballaden und melancholisch-raffinierten 
Harmonien erobert sie nach und nach eine wachsende Fangemeinde, die 
verstaendlicherweise auf Buehnenpraesenz draengt. 1979 geht Kate Bush das erste 
und einzige Mal in ihrer Laufbahn auf Tour. &quot;Ich bin kein Konzertmensch.
Das mag  daran liegen, dass ich nie in einer Live-Band gesungen habe, sondern zu
Hause allein  vorm Klavier sass und vor mich hinkomponieren durfte&quot;,
erklaert sie ihre Aversion  gegen das oeffentliche Zurschaustellen ihrer Kunst,
&quot;1979 hatte ich irgendwann das  Gefuehl, zuviel von mir preisgegeben zu
haben. Die oeffentliche Kate wurde immer  groesser und die private schrumpfte
regelrecht.&quot; In mehrjaehrigen Pausen zwischen  jedem neuen Album zieht sich
Kate Bush vollends zurueck und taucht allenfalls fuer  Benefizprojekte oder fuer
ein Duett mit Freund und Kollege Peter Gabriel (&quot;Don't  Give Up&quot;)
wieder auf. &quot;Ich moechte mich niht dem unterwerfen, was die Menschen  in
mir sehen wollen. Daher entwickle ich immer andere Persoenlichkeiten - vor 
allem in Videos. Damit ich nicht durch Aeusserlichkeiten auf ein Image
festgenagelt  werde.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Auf geradezu exorbitante Art und Weise versteht es Frau Bush, immer wieder 
neue Bilder von sich zu entwerfen: von der kindlich-naiven Fee bis hin zur 
erotisch-geheimnisvollen Femme fatale. 
</P>
<P>Doch auch, wenn es nicht so scheint, ist die 164 Zentimeter grosse Frau mit
den  langen Hennalocken gar nicht so furchtbar geheimnisvoll: &quot;Manchmal
ueberlege ich,  dass Leute, die mich sehen, denken: 'Oh Gott, sieht die nicht
klein und alt aus?',  aber ich weiss, dass mir das nie jemand ins Gesicht sagen
wuerde.&quot;

article 
</P>
<P>Well, this one was short, and I had a bit of time left, so I'm already ready
with it.  It doesn't say ANYTHING, has serious spelling errors in the
discography, but it is  POSITIVE. Remember that Max probably won't say anything
negative about  anyone, since it's that kind of a magazine. Don't Worry, Be
Happy...

<P>Bye, Uli

<P>Article from 'Max, November - 11/93' 
</P>
<P>One page. Two pictures out of the (first) Rubberband Girl video (Kate in the
 straight jacket and Kate on the trampolin) as well as a picture with Kate
wearing a  head. This is the same picture that was used in the me/sounds

</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>by Britta Weitholz 
</P>
<P>She belongs to the British music scene like sticky cakes to the five o'clock
tea.  Since Kate Bush took the international charts by storm in 1978 with &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot; the anglo-saxon music scene is enriched by a top act that has to
be taken  seriously. The actual album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (EMI) is the
seventh go from the now  35 years old exeptional vocalist. 
</P>
<P>Her carriere begins so perfect, as you almost can't imagine in any other
way:  With sweet sixteen Kate Bush, daughter of an Irish woman and a country
doctor  from Plumstead, is discovered and supported in person by Pink Floyds
guitar  mastermind David Gilmour. He managed to get a paradisical contract with
the major  label EMI for the young piano talent: three years long she is allowed
to study dance  and singing on the expense of the record label, before the
studio date for the furious  debut &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; was due. The
exceptionally high pitched voice got the  trademark of the shy teenager. With
longing love ballads and melancolic-subtle  harmonies she gradually conquers a
growing body of fans who understandably  demand stage presence. 1979 Kate Bush
goes for the first and only time in her  carreer on tour. &quot;I am not a
concert person. This might be because I've never sung  in a live band, but
rather was sitting at home alone at the piano and was allowed to  compose to
myself&quot;, she explains her aversion against public display of her art, &quot;at
 some point in 1979 I had the feeling that I had given away too much from
myself.&quot; In  multi yearlong pauses between each new album Kate Bush pulls
back herself  completely and at most emerges again for benefiz projects or for a
duet with her  friend and colleague Peter Gabriel (&quot;Don't Give Up&quot;). &quot;I
don't want to submit to  what people want to see in me. Therefore I always
develop different personalities -  especially in videos. For not being nailed
down to an image by appearances.&quot; 
</P>
<P>With a downright exorbitant way Ms Bush understands to create always new 
pictures of herself: from the childish-naive fairy to the erotic-mysterious
femme  fatale. 
</P>
<P>But even when it doesn't seem so the 164 cemtimeter tall woman with the long
 henna locks isn't so dreadfully mysterious: &quot;Sometimes I think that people
who see  me think: 'Oh God, doesn't she look small and old?', but I know, that
noone would  say this to me straight into the face.&quot;

<P><A NAME="4_2n">From: hoyme@src.honeywell.com (Ken Hoyme)</A><BR>  Date:
Tue, 2 Nov 1993 03:46:58 GMT <BR> Subject: TRS Review in Minneapolis Star
Tribune 10/31/93 
</P>
<P>Sunday's edition of the Minneapolis Star Tribune had a brief review of The
Red  Shoes. The banners at the top of the Entertainment section grabbed me with

</P>
<P>&quot;Listen up: Kate Bush can make you gasp.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So I flipped to page two and the Listen Up (music review) section has a
photo of  Kate with the overall section title of 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush: gasp of awe, despair&quot; 
</P>
<P>The review is as follows: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>This plunge into Bush's sensual world sometimes leaves the listener gasping
in  awe at the lush musical landscapes spawned by her unfettered romanticism,
but also  sometimes gasping for breath in the rarefied despair of a troubled
heart. On her  first album in more than three years, Bush still finds solace and
even pleasure in  romance despite the bruises left on her soul, giving &quot;Red
Shoes&quot; (due in stores  Tuesday) its artistic tension. 
</P>
<P>What works best is a trio of songs fraught with such passion and angst that
Bush  seems possessed. &quot;And So Is Love&quot; is an exquisite meditation on
what it's all about,  spiced with bluesy irony from Eric Clapton's guitar. &quot;The
Song of Solomon&quot; is a  disconcertingly delicate stroll through the fires of
lust punctuated by the Trio  Bulgarka's eerie vocals. &quot;You're the One&quot;
is an aching portrait of rejection and  resignation, with Bush's voice drowning
in pain against Gary Brooker's looming  organ and Jeff Beck's emphatic guitar. 
</P>
<P>Bush keeps her balance by composing music that's never complacent, always 
exploring fresh dimensions of her wide-ranging vision and musical interests. Her
 stretch on &quot;Red Shoes&quot; ranges from Brit pop to a startling collision
of Minneapolis  funk and Eastern European choral music (on &quot;Why Should I
Love You,&quot; an unlikely  collaboration among Bush, Prince and the
Bulgarkas). 
</P>
<P>Despite occasional weaknesses for the overly majestic and girlish
flirtations, Bush  positively glows when hissing anguished intimacies into your
ear or howling terms of  endearment whose actual intent may be someone's
internment.

Nov 1993 05:34:56 GMT <BR> Subject: TRS in the City Paper Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>hi there, 
</P>
<P>just thought i'd type up what they said in the City Paper about kate: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Though much of her reputation is still based on her initial
incarnation as  precocious '70s artpop princess, Kate Bush didn't really come
into her own until the  early '80s, when she discovered synthesizer technology
and began infusing her  lyrical flights-of-fancy with recognizably adult
emotional dynamics. Notwithstanding  a few characteristic excursions into
lyrical preciousness, the Red Shoes (Columbia) is  one of Bush's most impressive
efforts. Tracks like &quot;Lily&quot; and &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;  (on
which she actuually makes the couplet &quot;Don't want your bullshit/Just want
your  sexuality&quot; stick) display an emotional toughness that's a marked
contrast to the  flowery fragility of her &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; days.
Her seamlessly eclectic musical  settings are as evocative as ever, and
herdistinctive vocal trill has matured from  gimmicky affectation into a
uniquely expressive instrument.&quot;

Date: Thu, 04 Nov 93 13:39:35 CDT <BR> Subject: REVIEW IN NATL COLLEGE MAGAZINE
Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>Northwestern's daily newspaper had an insert yesterday called &quot;U. The
National  College Magazine&quot; and it had the following review of TRS: 
</P>
<P>5 stars possible 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush made a bold statement of vocal and lyrical style with her 1978
debut,  TKI, and remains triumphantly unique eight albums later. TRS is more
proof that  this woman loves her work. 
</P>
<P>Songs of inspired passion and intimate storytelling will delight long-time
Bush  fans as the disc flirts with disco, soul, progressive-rock and Caribbean
sounds, all of  it dramatically colored by Bush's boisterous, gleeful, sometimes
painfully expressive  voice. 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; and &quot;Eat the Music&quot;, Bush sings
with youthful abandon and  frivolity, then moves defiantly into sophisticated
introspection in &quot;Moments of  Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Lily&quot;. This
mixture of open femininity and internal reflection is  Bush's specialty, and
previously unfamiliar American listeners should find TRS a  good introduction.

<BR> Subject: Dutch TRS review Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>Hi everyone, 
</P>
<P>My first time on this list and an exclusive rightaway! This (translated - I
figured  most of you're not too good in reading Dutch) review is from the local
newspaper  from The Hague, Netherlands (where I live). 
</P>
<P>Here it comes: From: Haagsche Courant, 5th November 1993. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 'Red shoes'[sic] - EMI 
</P>
<P>One hears so much pain on 'Red shoes', Kate Bush' first album in five [sic] 
years. &quot;I feel like life has blown a great big hole through me&quot;, sings
the English  musician in 'Lily', and that a little what happened. The recent
dying of her mother  Hannah, to whom the album is dedicated, and the separation
from her childhood  friend Del Palmer, who *is* still involved in the
productionprocess (en probably will  be in the future), can be heard in a series
of emotional compositions. She presents a  broken heart, which doesn't leave the
listener unmoved, like in the 'bare'  'Moments of pleasure', in which her
glorious voice, plunged in piano and orchestra,  uses a series of notes touched
by emotions. [Bad translation, I think. He means that  the notes she sings are
sounding like they were gnawed by her tears, or something  like that.] 
</P>
<P>There are references to God in the erotic 'Song of Solomon', but the most 
fragile Kate can be found in 'You're the one', which deals directly with the 
separation. Her feelings of despair are coloured by the Hammond-solos of Gary 
Brooker, the guitar of Jeff Beck and the weepsome backgroundvocals of the Trio 
Bulgarka, who are placed less on the foreground on 'Red shoes' than on 'The 
sensual world', but who are more impressive. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is no longer busy making musical sketches, but paints without 
lay(er)ing notes too thick. Bright compositions arise this way, which show a
rich  form of 'world music' , without ever losing the Bush-stamp. The jigs and
reels in  the cheerful title track for instance, the by folkmusic of Madagascar
influenced 'Eat  the music' or the multi-voiced question/answer-game in the
merry 'Constellation of  the heart'. 
</P>
<P>That the musical content of 'Red shoes' is being taken care of by the 
'creme-de-la-creme' of the music industry says a lot about Kate, but it also
provides  a balanced musical decorum, in which only Prince (in 'Why should I
love you') may  have had too much space.

ed@wente.llnl.gov (Ed Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Rolling Stone reviews The Red
Shoes!! Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>Rolling Stone is probably the most important American rock music magazine. 
That doesn't mean it's the best, but it is the most well-known and has by far
the  largest circulation. 
</P>
<P>They didn't review &quot;The Whole Story&quot;, except in passing. They
didn't review  &quot;The Sensual World&quot; at all. But in the Nov. 25 issue,
they review &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.  Actually, the same &quot;article&quot;
reviews both that and Jane Siberry's &quot;When I Was A  Boy&quot;. To ease the
suspense, I'll tell you right off that TRS got three and a half stars,  while
WIWAB got four (out of five). Not fantastic for TRS, perhaps, but not awful 
either -- and that's pretty good, considering the track record of this magazine.
And  what the review says is perhaps better than the number of stars indicates.
It's by  Richard C. Walls. Here it is: 
</P>
<P>On her first album since The Sensual World , in 1989, Kate Bush continues in
the  manner of that album's verbal directness while displaying a melodic sense
that's in  peak form -- there are more hooks on The Red Shoes , both subtle and
obvious,  than on any of her releases since The Dreaming , in 1982. Bush seems
content now to  dress her songs in simpler -- though still occasionally antic --
colors. The result is  offbeat pop that refines but doesn't sacrifice her signal
eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>While the music has settled down somewhat, Bush herself remains
rambunctious,  and it's a saving grace. A sighing remembrance like &quot;Moments
of Pleasure&quot; or the  purple pleas of &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; could have
the cloying aura of pressed flowers if  they weren't put across with conviction
and a tendency to really belt. &quot;And So Is  Love&quot; is typical of Bush's
aggressively sad torch songs, built of simple phrases  theatrically enunciated
and enhanced by dramatic support from guest Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>It's not all fainting hearts on Shoes , though. The mood ranges from the
pure pop  of &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; to the exuberant reel of the title cut
(an homage to the classic  film), from the wistful verse and funky chorus of the
Prince collaboration &quot;Why  Should I Love You?&quot; to the West
Indies-flavored &quot;Eat the Music.&quot;  The Red Shoes is  a solid collection
of well-crafted and seductively melodic showcases for Bush's  hypercaberet
style.

<P>Vor jeder Vollmondnacht klettern Kate Bushs Verehrer in die Baeume, die das 
Haus der Englaenderin umgeben. Sie hoffen, dass Kate mit einem Rudel 
befreundeter Kobolde an ihnen vorbeitanzen wird. Bisher vergeblich. Zu ihrem 
Trost hat Kate Bush nach vier Jahren ein neues Album gezaubert, auf dem sie wie 
eine Elfe singt und wie eine Hexe tanzt. Zudem pflegt sie Freundschaft mit einer
 Bande boeser Trolle, die sich Eric Clapton, Nigel Kennedy und Prince nennen.
Diese  Gnome treiben immer wieder Schabernack. Doch Kate ist eine maechtige Fee.
Und  deshalb ist &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; wieder ganz bezaubernd gelungen.

</P>
<P>Each night when the moon is full Kate Bushs admirers climb the trees 
surrounding this englishwomans home. They hope Kate will dance by them with a 
swarm of friendly imps. Of no avail so far. For their solace, Kate Bush has
conjured  up a new album after four years, on which she sings like an elf and
dances like a  witch. Moreover she befriends a bunch of sinister trolls calling
themselves Eric  Clapton, Nigel Kennedy and Prince. Those gnomes are always
playing pranks. But  Kate is a mighty fairy. And that's why &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;
turned out so enchanting.

</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: The Red Shoes 
</P>
<P>* 1/2 
</P>
<P>Even though it generally takes four years for Kate Bush to put an album
together,  what results is usually worth the wait. So why does THE RED SHOES
seem such a  misstep? It isn't as if Bush has lost her knack for odd-but-catchy
pop songs. The  title tune spins its slightly circular theme into wonderful,
ear-catching arabesques.  But too many of these songs lead nowhere, relying more
on flashy production and  high-profile guests than on melodic inspiration.

Peter Byrne Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt; <BR> Subject:
REVIEW: Newsday on TRS Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>The Newsday reviewed TRS today, Glenn Kenny (freelance, not staff) writing 
under the head &quot;Red Shoes Don't Make It.&quot; 
</P>
<P>England tends to nurture its artistic eccentrics more tenderly than America;
 characteristically, the nearly unclassifiable songstress Kate Bush is a
superstar there  and merely a beloved cult figure here. For that cult, her every
utterance is an event.  And there's been a long wait for the latest; &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot; is her first album in  four years. That gap is not surprise,
since the reclusive Bush is such an obsessive  sound sculptor--she was one of
the first recording artists to take creative advantage  of sampling technology.
Her improbable soprano, combined with her predilection for  decorating
conventionally structured songs with all manner of exotic aural filigree,  make
her an often compelling pop maverick. But &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is one of
her  most ordinary-sounding records. Could be the times have caught up with her,
or just  she's been holed up in the studio too long. Whatever the reason, the
result is a  record that, while entirely listenable, does not deliver the
stunning surprises of her  previous work. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; takes its title from the classic 1947 Michael
Powell/Emeric  Pressburger film (soon to be a Broadway musical) about a willful
ballerina whose  life is consumed by her need to dance. Again, it's no surprise
that Bush is attracted  to this theme; the characters in her songs are always in
deep thrall to  something--most recently, sex (witness her last two proper
albums, &quot;Hounds of  Love&quot; and &quot;The Sensual World&quot;). But
unlike Madonna, Bush maintains a certain  decorum--no coffee-table books of nude
pictures for her, thanks. Even at her most  frankly carnal (as in the new
album's &quot;The Song of Solomon,&quot; which contains the  line &quot;Just
want your sexuality&quot;), she sounds circumspect. 
</P>
<P>The record is as beautifully crafted as anything she's ever done, but often
seems  to subsume the oddball elements that gave her earlier productions their
strange  allure. &quot;Rubberband Girl,&quot; &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; and the
title track are quirkily involving,  but a good deal of the rest falls flat,
relying on time-tested ingredients. &quot;Why Should  I Love You?&quot; begins
well enough, with the haunting eastern European vocal stylings  of the Trio
Bulgarka, but once guest star Prince kicks in on keyboards, guitar and  bass,
the song becomes a stale funk jam. &quot;You're the One&quot; features former
Procul  Harum singer/pianist Gary Brooker imitating the organ stylings of former
bandmate  Matthew Fisher, while guitarist Jeff Beck does Jeff Beck. She deploys
the familiar  trappings of classic rock with aplomb, but the track remains a
disappointing album  closer; familiarity is the last thing we expect from Bush.

</P>
<P>[As to &quot;disappointing album closer,&quot; I have a suggestion,
Glenn.... But let it go.] 
</P>
<P>On a brighter note, The New Yorker has added a new weekly feature in the  &quot;Goings
On About Town&quot; calendar pages called &quot;Record Store Arrivals,&quot; &quot;A
highly  selective list of new releases we're curious to hear.&quot; Kate Bush &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot; is  included in the list for November 15 (along with Queen
Latifah, Jody Watley,  Teenage Fanclub, Otis Redding, &quot;Incredibly Strange
Music,&quot; and &quot;No Alternative,&quot; p.  20). Cocteau Twins' &quot;Four
Calendar Cafe,&quot; released the same week, didn't make it  until this week's
issue, November 22.

<P><A NAME="4_2v">Date: Thu, 25 Nov 1993 11:34:00 +0100 </A><BR> From:
uli@zoodle.RoBIN.de (Ulrich Grepel) <BR> Subject: musikexpress/Sounds (German
mag) 12/93 
</P>
<P>Hi, the German magazine musikexpress/Sounds, issue 12/93, has three Kate
Bush  mentions: 
</P>
<P>p. 60, 'expressgut' 
</P>
<P>[TRS album cover, 3x3 cm, next to it:] KATE BUSH Die nachdenkliche Fee lockt
 auf &quot;Red Shoes&quot; den Zuhoerer tief hinein in den verschlungenen
Irrgarten ihrer  Gefuehle. 
</P>
<P>[English translation:] KATE BUSH On &quot;Red Shoes&quot; the thoughtful
fairy lures the  listener deep into the winding labyrinth of her feelings 
</P>
<P>p. 66, 'Seelen-Surferin' 
</P>
<P>[b/w photo of Kate in black dress sitting on a white box wearing red shoes,
the  shoes are of course NOT b/w, album cover too:] 
</P>
<P>SEELEN-SURFERIN 
</P>
<P>Ein Klang-Irrgarten mit rotem Faden 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes (EMI 827277 2) 
</P>
<P>Man muss sie hassen oder lieben. Kate Bushs Musik, zu der man kaum ein 
indifferentes Verhaeltnis haben kann, vertraegt keine ploetzlichen
Stil-Wandlungen.  Und ist es nur konsequent, wenn sie sich auch auf dem neuen
Album - immerhin  vier Jahre vom letzten Werk entfernt - der gewohnten und
bewaehrten Zutaten  bedient. Dabei beginnt &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; zunaechst
mit leisen, fuer  Bush-Verhaeltnisse froestelnd unpathetischen Toenen: &quot;Rubberband
Girl&quot; ist  eigentlich nur an ihrer schwebenden Stimme als Bush-Song zu
erkennen, so  schnurstraks springt das schlichte, kleine Popwerk auf den Punkt.
Keine Bange -wie  dieser Opener charmant zu falschen Schluessen verleitet, so
lockt die  nachdenklikche Fee Kate im Laufe des Albums ihre Hoerer immer wieder
auf neue  Pfade tief hinein in ihren Seelen-Irrgarten, der diesmal nur mit Hilfe
eines  textlich/inhaltlichen roten Fadens reibungslos durchschritten werden
kann. Religion,  Philosophie, ewige (rethorische) Fragen nach Leben und Sinn
stehen im  Vordergrund. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And So Is Love&quot;, der zweite Song, schlaegt mit Hilfe von Eric
Claptons  millimetergenauen Gitarren-Licks schon wieder einen stilistischen
Haken. Doch  Clapton gibt unter Kate Bushs bunter Musikerschar nicht allein den
Ton an.  Suedamerikanische Gitarren, die gleichzeitig an keltische Klaenge
erinnern praegen  &quot;Eat The Music&quot;, und zum ersten Mal stellt sich die
sphaerische &quot;Bush-Faszination&quot;  ein, dieses Gefuehl, den Boden unter
den Fuessen zu verlieren und auf fremden  Schwingen davonzufliegen. Selbst
Egozentriker wie der ehemalige Klassik-Violinist  Nigel Kennedy fuegen sich
nahtlos dem Zauber wie in &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; oder dem  kurzen und
knackigen solistischen Hoehenflug beim Finale &quot;You're The One&quot;. 
Zusammen mit Procol Harum Keyboarder Gary Brooker beschwoert er hier Bilder  aus
vergangenen Tagen, als Menschen wie Brooker noch Rockgeschichte schrieben  und
nicht als bleiche Denkmaeler durch die Studios schlichen. Auch dieses kleine 
Verdienst gebuert Kate Bush, deren unnachgiebig durchdachte, nie hingeschlampte 
Kompositionen keine Routine zulassen. 
</P>
<P>Hin und wieder verlaesst sie sich gern wieder auf das Folk-Trio Bulgarka und
 seinem wehmutig nostalgischen Balkan-Sound, der einst zu Kate Bushs 
Markenzeichen wurde. Selbst wenn dann Mit-Exzentriker Prince dazustoesst, traegt
 diese schwingend aesthetische Bruecke noch: Bei &quot;Why Should I Love You&quot;
 demonstriert der Alleskoenner, dass er durchaus Einfuehlungsvermoegen fuer 
andere Klangwelten als seine eigenen besitzt. Wahrscheinlich trafen sich die
beiden  auf der spirituellen Ebene, denn Red Shoes ist Kate Bushs bis dato am
meisten von  religioesen Themen gepraegtes Album - und auf dem Gebiet ist Prince
ja  bekanntlich auch sehr bewandert. Vieles hat Kate Bush in ihre &quot;roten
Schuhe&quot;  gestopft, und man sollte sich ausreichend Zeit nehmen, um alle
Facetten zu  entdecken. Ein ernsthaftes Album, dem man die lange Arbeit anmerkt.
Kate Bushs  Anhaenger werden genau das zu schaetzen wissen. (wt) * * * * 
</P>
<P>SOUL SURFER 
</P>
<P>A sound labyrinth with a thread [this isn't translatable into English - we
say  'roter Faden' (= red thread) for 'thread'] 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes (EMI 827277 2) 
</P>
<P>You have to hate her or love her. Kate Bush's music, to which you can barely
 have an indifferent relation, doesn't tolerate sudden changes in style. And
it's only  consequent, when on the new album - after all four years from her
last work - she  also uses the usual and proven ingredients. At the same time &quot;The
Red Shoes&quot;  begins with soft, compared to earlier Bush frosty unpathetic
tones: &quot;Rubberband  Girl&quot; is actually only recognisable as a Bush song
due to her floating voice, that  straight the plain, small pop-work jumps to the
point. Don't worry - as well as this  opener leads charmantly to wrong
conclusions, during the album the thoughtful  fairy lures her listeners again
and again on new paths deep into her soul labyrinth,  that this time can only be
striden through smoothly with a textual/contentswise  [red] thread. Religion,
philosophy, neverending (rethorical) questions about live and  sense are
standing in the foreground. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And So Is Love&quot;, the second song, already stilistically darts
sideways again with  the help of Eric Clapton's exact-to-the-millimeter guitar
licks. But Clapton does not  have the greatest say in Kate Bush's colorful crowd
of musicans. South American  guitars that at the same times remind of Celtic
sounds, are shaping &quot;Eat The Music&quot;,  and for the first time the
spheric &quot;Bush-fascination&quot; comes in, to feel the ground  falling
beneath your feet and to fly away on foreign wings. Even egocentrics as the 
former classical violinist Nigel Kennedy fit in seamlessly into the magic like
in &quot;Big  Stripey Lie&quot; or the short and crisp solistical high flights
in the final &quot;You're The  One&quot;. Together with Procol Harum keyboarder
Gary Brooker he enchants pictures  from days long gone, when people like Brooker
wrote rock history and didn't creep  through the studios as pale monuments. This
little merit also is Kate Bush's, whose  intransigently thought-out, never
sloppy compositions do not allow for routine. 
</P>
<P>Every now and then she's relying on the folk-Trio Bulgarka and its 
melancholically nostalgic Balkan-sound that once became the trade mark of Kate 
Bush. Even when co-excentric Prince joins this swingingly asthetic bridge still
holds:  With &quot;Why Should I Love You&quot; the all-rounder demonstrates that
he absolutely is  able to feel into other sound worlds than his own. Probably
the two met on a  spiritual plane, because up to now Red Shoes is Kate's album
that is most shaped by  religious themes - and in this subject Prince is well
known to be well-versed. Kate  Bush stuffed many things into her &quot;red shoes&quot;,
and you should take plenty of time to  discover all facetts. A serious album
where you can tell the long work. Kate Bush's  followers will appreciate exactly
that. (wt)

<P>From the November 14th issue of The Independent on Sunday's &quot;Night &amp;
Day&quot;  colour supplement: 
</P>
<P>Daft as a Bush 
</P>
<P>by Tom Hibbert 
</P>
<P>[bit about playing records backwards, throwing yourself out windows and Phil
 Collins deleted] 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush exudes Englishness of a different kind. Croquet and gingham and 
scones on the dainty patio. She is our dottiest dame since Margaret Rutherford
and  she is, to use an overworked and undervalued word, unique. 
</P>
<P>Her new LP, The Red Shoes (EMI 1047), named after the flitty Forties ballet
flick  starring Moira Shearer (only 'our' Kate would think of this), does not
disappoint.  There is nothing here that *quite* compares with her most splendid
songs -- 1980's  Breathing and 1986's The Big Sky [yay! -st] -- but The Red
Shoes is a triumph  nonetheless. She still sings like the slightly crazy girl on
the lacrosse team alarming  the opposing Vicarage XII -- on the boisterous title
track she goes quite superbly  bonkers. 
</P>
<P>Her music is exotic and clever -- not *clever*-clever, you understand, just 
imaginative: one moment she's sweeping us off on an unlikely touristico visit to
 Guinea-Bissau or somewhere equally West African (Eat the Music), the next she
is  weeping o'er the pianoforte (Moments of Pleasure). 
</P>
<P>She is the only woman in the universe who could hope to get Lenny Henry and 
Prince performing on the same song (not necessarily a good idea, but Why Should
I  Love You? does work). And, most important of all, her lyrics are still
utterly  potty...'Oh big stripy lie moving like a wavy line.' What *can* she
mean? 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's only mistake, the first of her glittering career, is to invite
the  fiddling goon Nigel Kennedy to scrape his Strad on the LP. Play him
backwards, play  him forwards, play him in any direction you care to, Nigel's
'hidden' message is  ever the same: 
</P>
<P>'Squawk-di-squawk-fiddle-di-dee-Cor!-ain't-I-a-flash-geezer?-Monster!-Hendrix!-Villa!'

<P>Excuse me while I throw myself out the window...

<P>November 24th Edition of New York Press (New York's Free Weekly  Newspaper)

</P>
<P>Kate Bush Smiles in Her New Red Shoes 
</P>
<P>by Peter Gambaccini 
</P>
<P>Just as I can't understand why so many people have a problem with the 
estimable Hillary Clinton, I don't get the critical barbs often aimed at the
inimitable  Ka te Bush. Even in flattery she's called &quot;pretentious,&quot;
as if incorporating Emily  Bronte and Lord Tennyson and a passel of
psychobabblers into her material with  often seamless skill were inherently a
bad thing. I understand that the Great Books  don't carry the weight they once
did, but I always maintained that having a long  literary syllabus at one' s
command was a good thing. 
</P>
<P>In a tv retrospective of Saturday Night Live' s early days, Paul Shaffer
suggested  that the most bizarre incident of his time as the show's musical
director wa s when  a very young Bush writhed on his piano, dramatically and
terpsichoreally enacting  &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes,&quot; which
she'd written at the age of 16.  Shaffer's act, of course, is the essence of
inauthenticity, so consider the source. Still,  despite endless SNL reruns, I
don't believe her segment ever aired again. 
</P>
<P>Bush is a genius. Geniuses do overreach. Some of her stuff is awful,
paint-peeling  noise. I question certain of her choices. One thing I love about
civilization is that we  can disagree about such things without strafing each
with automatic weapons fire.  Bush connects about two out of three times, and a
.667 beats not only John Olerud's  batting average but the average pop artist's
two or three acceptable cuts per CD. 
</P>
<P>Her &quot;Love and Anger,&quot; a stunner MTV never plays anymore, is about
third on my  alltime video list (behind R.E.M.'s &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;,
and Midge Ure's &quot;Dear God&quot;).  &quot;This Womans Work&quot;, with the
couplet &quot;Ooh, it's hard on a man, his work is  over,&quot; is the
chillingly apt backdrop to the scene of Kevin Bacon fretting out  Elizabeth
McGovern's difficult childbirth in She's Having A Baby&quot;. It almost makes 
you forget how pedestrian the rest of the film is. 
</P>
<P>I was a sucker for her banshee vocal as the ghostly Cathy on &quot;Wuthering
 Heights.&quot; She re-recorded a more human voice for the song on her
compilation The  Whole Story . &quot;In the Warm Room&quot; convinced me to have
sex with someone I was  waffling about; &quot;Wow&quot; has become my anthem to
anyone who amazes me; I sing  &quot;Lionheart&quot; to my cat. 
</P>
<P>Bush has used Bulgarian women's choirs and African drummers and David 
Gilmour's guitar to magnificent effect. Her malleable and expansively ranging
voice  pairs with her studio wizardry to give her the most astonishing vocal
control of any  recording artist extant. She steps so far in front of the dense
sonic landscape on  &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; that you figure she's left
the speaker and must be in your  apartment. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes (Columbia), here after a four-year wati since The Sensual
World ,  adds to her stature and could add to the size of her American audience.
It's  accessible. It's not terribly polysyllabic. The obscure cultural reference
points are  fewer than in a Dennis Miller monolog. Parts of it are just darn
pretty. At 35, Kate  Bush has produced her most gleeful album in a decade. 
</P>
<P>The 1993 Bush gives us instant smiles with &quot;Rubberband Girl,&quot;
which, I dare say,  is just plain fun. A clever analogy spins out as she details
her life. She's inflexible;  she'd like to bounce back, to snap out of it, like
a rubberband. &quot;Those trees bend in  the wind,&quot; she notes, while &quot;I
try to resist.&quot; It's rendered to a jaunty beat. No Ph.D.  required to grasp
this one. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush always manages to be steamily exotic without being the least bit 
smutty. There's this thing called subtlety, see. I won't quote the lyrics of &quot;And
So Is  Love&quot; at length out of context, but her terrible sexy tease is the
explicit detail she  leaves off the end of every line. It sounds like an
infuriating device, but it's brilliant.   It's another of her unabashed
testimonials to the primacy of true feeling; in affairs  of the heart, Kate Bush
always means business. 
</P>
<P>Eric Clapton guests on &quot;And So Is Love.&quot; He belongs, but he's not
the star--it's  her show. &quot;Why Should I love You?&quot; is different.
Prince co-arranges, shares vocals,  and plays his customary array of
instruments. The result is exactly what you'd  expect. It's okay, but it was
never in my dreams. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; probably will inhabit my dream state. Direct
and piercing,  it's only Kate at the piano and Michael Kamen's orchestrations;
it's achingly,  unbearably exquisite. She recalls a dive off a rock at the
beach, snow on a New York  balcony, and a favorite saying of her mother, whose
relatively recent death informs  much of The Red Shoes . With all the feeling
she can muster--and she can  outmuster anyone--Bush affirms &quot;Just being
alive, it can really hurt/And those  moments given are a gift from time/Just let
us try to give the moments back/To  those we love, To those who will survive.&quot;

</P>
<P>Bush has customarily shunned interviews and the p.r. mill, insisting that
all she  needs to say is in her music. I'm always reminded of Peter Handke's
novell,  A  Moment of True Feeling . There are more of those moments, deeper and
honestly  proferred to us, in The Red Shoes that in piles of product gracing the
airwaves. If  the gorgeous and affecting &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; doesn't
suffice, we're dead. 
</P>
<P>Elsewhere, she lightens up a lot. In &quot;The Red Shoes,&quot; a girl dons
the fabled  footwear and can't stop dancing. And you can dance to it, and to &quot;Eat
the Music,&quot;  which is vaguely Mexican and so laden with fruit imagery that
you'll get hungry. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes has its misses. Her &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; isn't as
riveting as the  Bible's, and &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; is a nifty title for
an ugly tune. But what's most often  apparent is that Bush, who rarely does
concerts, brings such care and expertise to  her production. In the course of a
single track, she is first one voice and then an  altogether different one,
singing from geographically distinct locales in the aural mix.  In &quot;Top of
the City,&quot; she pauses perfectly between vocal steps, jsut as anyone mak 
ing a climb to such a lofty pinnacle would have to. 
</P>
<P>In &quot;You're the One,&quot; a finale that brings together Jeff Beck and
the Trio  Bulgarka without a stumble, she cogently observes the futility of
trying to sort out what's  yours and what's mine after a breakup; almost all of
it is ours, materially but,  more importantly, metaphysically. She can gas up
the car and load it with her  things, but &quot;you're the only one I want,&quot;
she repeats again and again. At the end,  farther away, she's calling out &quot;Sugar?
Honey?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Pedestrian notions rendered in simple terms, perhaps.  The Red Shoes is as 
plain-speaking as Kate Bush gets. But not pro forma, and even the small words
have  been selected with great care and precision. From the most serene bliss to
the most  desperate urgency, no singer locates as many spots on the emotional
spectrum as  Bush does. 
</P>
<P>Every one of Bush's albums contains songs I couldn't live without, but The
Red  Shoes is a rewarding chance to begin to accept her as your personal, uh,
genius .  &quot;You see, I'm all grown up now,&quot; she sang in 1989 on The
Sensual World 's &quot;The  Fog&quot;. No, you're all grown up now .
