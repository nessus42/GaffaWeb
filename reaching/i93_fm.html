<P>The new issue of &quot;Future Music&quot; magazine (A UK electronic
music-maker's  mag, drum machine reviews, that sort of thing) has a feature on
TRS (with the  obligatory promo photo of KaTe on the cover). It's basically an
interview with Del  on the recording of the album, with a track-by-track
commentary, a summary of  KaTe's kit, and a guide to the distinctive Kate Bush
vocals sound (it's not just her  voice, a Quantec Room Simulator apparently
plays an important role). There a photo  of the aforesaid Quantec box and a
couple of Yamaha SPX1000s, complete with dried  tea stains (at least that's what
it looks like 8-) all over the front of them and a photo  of Del at the (or at
least a) mixing desk, sans moustache! 
</P>
<P>Some of the things it covers are the decision to go to digital recording
part-way  through the project, the original plan for TRS to be the basis for a
tour, and KaTe's  playing of guitar and bass on BSL.

<H2>Del Palmer on Kate Bush </H2>
<H2>Well red </H2>
<P>After a four-year silence, Kate Bush is back with a new album. Mark Jenkins 
quizzes producer Del Palmer on the ins and outs of her opus The Red Shoes. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH. One of the most original songwriters/musicians in the popular 
music world, and certainly the most distinctive British female star around. It's
been  four years since her last album The Sensual World - only Kraftwerk and
Peter  Gabriel seem quite as tardy in coming up with new material. Despite a few
 collaborations with The Comic Strip, Kate hardly seems to have been busy during
 this time. What has she been up to? 
</P>
<P>One reason for the silence has been a complete changeover in the set-up at
her  impressive personal recording studio, at which she started work on The Red
Shoes  using 48-track analogue techniques, but changed midway to digital
recording - along  with all the advanced editing possibilities that implies. 
</P>
<P>At the time of writing, Kate is busy working on videos for the new album,
but  FM has tracked down Del Palmer. He's worked on all of Kate's albums and 
engineered and produced Tbe Red Shoes. 
</P>
<P>He's undoubtedly the best man to supply us with background on the
inspiration  behind Kate's latest work, the recording techniques involved and to
offer a  blow-by-blow account of the genesis of each of the album's 12 tracks. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes is set for release on EMI Records on November 1. 
</P>
<P>Del tells what Katie Did 
</P>
<P>&quot;ODDLY ENOUGH, the idea of this album,&quot; explains Del, &quot;was to
get it recorded  quickly and get out on to the road with it.&quot; Kate's only
previously played one short  tour. &quot;It didn't work out that way, but the
idea did influence the way the album was  put together. Because I wanted to
concentrate on engineering and didn't want to be  in the live band, I didn't
play much bass on the album, and we used the same  drummer and bassist - Stuart
Elliott and John Giblin - almost throughout. A lot of  the time we got them to
play together live to create a consistent backing for a song,  even if we had to
go back and change that as the song developed. 
</P>
<P>Now, with plans for live performances of The Red Shoes shelved, listeners
are  left with an album which has a preponderance of tight, live-sounding
tracks. Some  of these will be aired in a 50-minute film which, like the album
itself, is influenced  by the tale of The Red Shoes filmed by Michael Powell in
the 1950s. The film will  feature Kate herself in an acting role as well as
Miranda Richardson, choreography  from Lindsay Kemp and work from Terry (Monty
Python) Gilliam's animation  studio. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Let's take a track-by-track look at how The Red Shoes came together. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Rubberband Girl</STRONG> </P>
<P>Chosen as first single from the album, Rubberband Girl is up-tempo and 
infectiously melodic. Originally, the first single was intended to be Eat The
Music.  but during the production of the film to accompany the album, Rubberband
Girl  seemed to be catching everyone's imagination, and has proved to be a
substantial  chart success. 
</P>
<P>Although the song has a relatively straightforward pop/rock feel, the vocals
are  multi-tracked and some of them seem incredibly low-pitched. &quot;This song
and And  So Is Love are typical of the live band feel,&quot; explains Del. &quot;We
were trying to create  a very accessible, live sound and the fastest way to
record was to have at least two or  three people playing together initially. 
</P>
<P>&quot;On Rubberband Girl the bass, drums and basic keyboards were all done 
together, but we did change the whole track afterwards in the sense of editing
it  digitally rather than re-doing tracks. The bass and drum sound was important
 because we wanted to have them consistent throughout the album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Although Stuart Elliot and John Giblin's performances tended to go on to
tape  'live' at an early stage, this didn't avoid the need for subsequent
changes. &quot;When  you put later tracks down, the earlier ones sometimes have
to change because the  whole feel of the piece changes. Sometimes we had to do
the bass and drums three  or four times, not because we were unhappy with the
original performances, but  because the feel of the song had altered as new
tracks were added. Rubberband Girl  is one of the few that worked first time -
it just has a basic rock feel with a riffing  guitar, the backing vocals went
down first and then we tried various lyrics and lead  vocal ideas. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In most songs the lyrics change a lot during the recording process,
although a  basic seed remains solid. It often gets to the point of struggling
over just one word  which has to be returned to many times -there's never any
pressure to write a song  to fill a particular function, like acting as a single
or being a very slow ballad, so the  whole feel can often change,&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>And So Is Love</STRONG> </P>
<P>Del says this is his favouritc track on album. &quot;This one seems to have
the most  effective band sound to me; we had Gary Brooker (from Procul Harum) on
 Hammond organ and Eric Clapton on guitar, and that was just a couple of months 
after his son died. I admired him for doing that - he'd promised to do it and he
 wanted to stick to his commitment. Eric only really plays in one style, but
he's a  genius at what he does, so that was a highlight for me. 
</P>
<P>The track's original backing is a sequenced 4-bar Fairlight pattern which
was  played to the musicians to give them a feel for the piece. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Usually we keep more of the Fairlight sound&quot;, says del, &quot;but
in this case it got  scrubbed apart from the toms so it could all stay in strict
tempo, so it could all be  played live.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's Series III Fairlight is pretty obsolete now, and most of its
capabilities could  be reproduced by a computer and a couple of Akai S1000s.
However, she's got used  to the machine over the years and has a lot of
favourite sounds on it. &quot;On this track  there's a little flute/reed sound,
but the Fender piano sound is a real one and the  drums are Sl000 samples. We
only have a very small room for acoustic recording and  the sound of the room
tends to get on to drum recordings, so we used a lot of S1000  drum samples
triggered from Simmons pads plus real cymbals. Stuart Elliott knows  that our
drum recorcling can be a long and arduous process and he might get called  back
four or five times - not because we're unhappy with what he's done, but  because
the track changes as it develops.&quot; 
</P>

<P><STRONG>Eat The Music</STRONG></P>
<P>This track, laden with trummpets andl light percussion, has a very Latin 
American feel which actually stems from the music of Madagascar. &quot;It uses a
small  guitar called a 'caboss' which is one of the instruments Paddy (Bush,
Kate's  brother) discovered and brought back with him. He's very into ethnic
music of all  kinds and has always contributed a lot of ideas to the albums - he
helped bring in  some authentic players and the track started off with bass
guitar which was then  replaced by an acoustic bass - but that sounded a bit too
Latin. The horn section's  real, of course.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The decision not to release this track as the first single from the album 
represents one of the few times Kate has been influenced by outside opinions in
this  respect -the interest in Rubberband Girl winning out in this case. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Moments of Pleasure</STRONG></P>
<P>Like tracks on many of Kate's previous albums, this represents the piano and
 orchestra style of composition and was recorded largely at EMI's Abbey Road 
studios. Abbey Road's Studio 2 is equipped with the same SSL. automated mixing 
desk as Kate's own studio, and she has always recorded at least part of each
album  at Abbey Road. &quot;There does seem to be at least one of this type of
song on each  album, although the vocals proved a struggle this time. It's
inspired by a visit to the  USA in 1989 which included a meeting with Michael
Powell (director of the original  film The Red Shoes) which took place in a flat
in New York, and a lot of the lyric  lines refer to that occasion.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The piano parts were actually recorded in Kate's studio using a Grotrian 
Steinweg -built by an offshoot of the Steinway company - while the orchestra was
 produced by Haydn Bendall. &quot;I'm not too proud to say that he was the man
for the  job,&quot; acknowledges Del. &quot;Abbey Road is the best studio in the
world, and it's all  down to the people there like Ken Townsend who will help
with anything, including  loans of equipment whenever we need something. They
don't seemq to mind that  we're taking business away from them by recording in
our own studio as well.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Microphone technique for piano recording can be a case of trial and error. &quot;It
all  depends on the player. A couple of Shure SM87s in the lid, with the lid
propped up  as high as possible, gives you about 18 inches of microphone spacing
from the strings.  They're usually above the iron section to give a slightly
metallic sound, and then we  have Massenberg equalisation units to tailor the
sound. The equalisation on the SSL.  desk is too violent and you can't get very
specific, which is great for some things but  not for the piano.&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>The Song of Solomon </STRONG></P>
<P>Just as Kate used a section from .James Joyce's Ulysses on The Sensual World
 album, Song of Solomon uses biblical texts almost verbatim. &quot;This is one
of the first  tracks we mixed and it's very simple. The sampled harp sound on
the Fairlight  alternates with the piano - the toms were originally played, but
the final sounds are  sampled from an Emu percussion unit but with a boomy
bottom end added - the  originals were more like tablas and they sounded too
lightweight along with the  ethereal harp and piano. The original tom sound is
gated so that it just produces a  short click, and the click is used to trigger
the Fairlight. We had to advance the  track on the digital multi-track to get
the timing right, then move it back again with  a digital delay so you've got a
mixture of toms where some are on the beat and some  are slightly off it. The
good thing about the Fairlight is that it's stereo so you can  sample a whole
drum kit in one go.&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Lily</STRONG> </P>
<P>This track opens with a voice recording of a simple prayer. &quot;Lilly is a
healer who  helps Kate a lot and this is a little prayer she uses,&quot; reveals
Del. &quot;It just says that you  have to have hope to be able to carry on. The
track includes an instrument called a  Fujara, played by Paddy, which comes from
Yugoslavia - the very soft opening lulls  you into a false sense of security,
then you get what sounds like a drum loop, but in  fact it's all played live.
This is another track where the original bass and drums had  to lie re-done at a
later stage because the feel had changed almost to a hip-hop  style.&quot; This
very short track might seem an attempt to enter the indie rock field, but  Kate
would insist that there's no intention of confoming to specific styles in this
way. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>The Red Shoes</STRONG> </P>
<P>The album's title track seems to have an Irish folk music influence, with a
big  bass drum sound and an unusual legato bass part, but again this stems from
the  music of Madagascar. &quot;It's fascinating how music from different parts
of the world  can have these similarities. All the mandarins and mandolas are
played by Paddy,  who has really gone into this sort of music, and he also plays
all the various whistles  and flutes on the track&quot;. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Top of the City</STRONG> </P>
<P>Again featuring .John Giblin's unusual high pitched bass line, this track
has a  very theatrical approach and emphasises the power of Kate's voice to
deliver an  emotional ballad. &quot;The impression is of being high up in the
clouds over a city, and  originally there was more rhythm section, but a lot of
it was taken off to emphasise  the airiness of the track. That left the bass
part very prominent so that was put  through a delay to repeat it and emphasise
its effect.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The track was one of the first recorded for the album, but changed an awful
lot  during the studio sessions. &quot;Nigel Kennedy features on violin and his
parts were  recorded on analogue on 1990. There was a complete metamorphosis in
the editing  process and we lost a lot of the cymbals, which made the track
sound quite sparse  but a lot more powerful.&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Constellation of the Heart </STRONG></P>
<P>Reminiscent of nothing more than a Nile Rogers or Prince track as it opens,
this  one features a big American sound, lots of synth string chords, guitar
processing and  West Coast-style backing vocals. &quot;This one staarted off as
a 4-bar rhythm with this  little chant going about turning telescopes inwards on
ourselves. That turned into a  sort of chanting, soul-style backing, and again
it was a track that metamorphosed  into something new and had to have the
original bass and drums backing done again.  Now it has a sort of Sly Stone feel
to it...&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Big Stripey Lie</STRONG> </P>
<P>This track is fascinating in that the bass and guitar sounds which seem
typical of  dub specialist Jah Wobble and quirky American indie rock bands are
in fact all  played by Kate herself, who picked up a guitar during the recording
sessions and  within a couple of weeks was asking for Marshall valve guitar amps
to be delivered  so she could create screaming guitar solos. &quot;It's a sort
of stocking-filler track, the  last one to be written, and has a sort of Captain
Beefheart impersonation on the bass  and guitar.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The bass sound is intentionally overdriven on the mixing desk, but also
partly  results from Kate's style of playing it - her energetic style overloads
the compression  on the desk without actually creating distortion due to high
volume. Chirpy keyboard  sounds on a Yamaha DX7 and an unexpected violin part
combine to make this one of  the most absorbing tracks on the album, despite the
fact that it's untypical in its  overall recording method - &quot;this one was
done quite quickly by the old method of  putting down one track ata time, so
it's not representative of the band-orientated  approach on the rest of the
album.&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Why Should I Love You</STRONG></P>
<P>This one actually was recorded in collaboration with Prince - Kate went to
see  him at a gig and was flattered to be asked to meet him after the show, when
they  discussed a collaboration. Unable to physically get together in the same
room, they  swapped multi-track tapes, with a slave reel returning from Prince's
Paisley Park  studio covered in vocals, guitar solos and keyboards. &quot;The
problem then was to put  the track back together into something resembling its
original form while retaining  the best of what Prince had done. He hadn't added
one of the vocal parts which  would have been particularly good for him, so it
basically took two years to put it  back together. What's left is his lead
guitar, some digital synths and some chorus  vocals. Then Lenny Henry came in to
do a vocal on the end - he's really got a great  voice and ought to be doing a
serious record of his own.&quot; 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>You're The One</STRONG> </P>
<P>Again featuring Hammond organ and Fender piano, this track also includes a 
rare synthesizer melody line and features Jeff Beck on guitar. &quot;His style
is  completely different from Eric Clapton's - they're both great players but
with very  different aproaches.Jeff came in a couple of times to fix things up
because he  wasn't completely happy with them, and the end result is like
classic '70's and 80's  rock, with the Hammond from Gary Brooker again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If you're deeply committed to pop of a particular persuasion, listening to
The  Red Shoes can be a very unsettling experience. Kate Bush has little regard
for  fashion, transitory musical tastes or transparently obvious lyrics. 
</P>
<P>If you're in the mood for a sonic experience which stretches the limits of
style,  vocal technique and compositional mixing and matching, this could be the
album for  you - and if initial response to the single release of Rubberband
Girl is anything to  go by, it seems abundantly clear that Kate Bush is back in
a big way.
