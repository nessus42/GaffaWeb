<P>Date: Sun, 8 Sep 85 21:35:26 edt <BR> From: Henry Chai &lt;chai%utflis%toronto.csnet@csnet-relay.arpa&gt;
<BR> Subject: Canada TV Aug. 3./4. 1985 about The Dreaming
</P>
<P>On Aug.3 &amp; 4, a TV show called &quot;The New Music&quot;, produced by
CityTV here in  Toronto (which also produces MuchMusic, the Canadian equilvalent
of MTV),  con-tained a 5 minute interview of Kate Bush. I'd like to share it
here with the  people in (at? on? of?) lovehounds. 
</P>
<P>NM: It has been three years since Kate Bush released her last album &quot;The
 Dreaming&quot;.Now at last comes a new single and video called &quot;Running Up
that  Hill&quot;. It's taken from the new album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; which
is due out in  September. 
</P>

</P>
<P>	The &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; record represents a return to the gentler
tones for which  Kate Bush is most admired. To many people &quot;The Dreaming&quot;has
been  inaccessible, her singing abbrasive. When I met Kate on a trip to England
last  March, we talked about &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. 
</P>
<P>	[they were seated on the ground in what looks like a dance studio; mirrors
on  one wall and a grand piano at the back]
</P>
<P>KB: I think the last album is very dark and about pain and negativity, and
the way  that people treat each other badly. It was a sort of cry really and I
think that  perhaps the biggest influence on the last album was the fact that I
was producing  it so I could actually do what Iwanted for the first time. And
then there are a lot  of things we wanted to experiment with and I particulary
wanted to play around  with my voices, because there are a lot of different
backing vocals and things like  that. The different textures were important to
me. I wanted to try and create  pictures with the sounds by using effects. 
</P>
<P>NM: You have been, I think, popularly associted with a very, ah, sweet
voice, and  what you were doing some places on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was
making very glutteral  sounds, hoarse and raw, deliberately making your voice
crack. 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes, I find it much more interesting. The first two albums my voice
really  wasn't capable of doing that. I think my writing and my voice have
continually  tried to get better, to be able to do something I actually like.
And it's very  frustrating when you are writing songs and singing them, and
you're not enjoying  what's coming back. So hopefully, y'know, it will be become
more pleasurable  for me, the actual process, because it is painful to listen to
things that sound  awful, when you really wanted them to sound good.

<P>NM: Those earlier songs &quot;Breathing&quot; and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;,
have what you might  call a political conscience. Now that so many groups are
doing political music, like  the Ethiopia Famine Relief Fund music that sort of
thing, is your new album  going to contain something similar?
</P>
<P> KB: No, I don't think..., actually there aren't any tracks that are
political as such. I  never felt that I've written from a political point of
view. It's always been an  emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps
be a political situation. I  mean war is an extremly emotional situation,
especially if you're going to be  blown up! I think with the whole thing of
nuclear war, people are really terrified  and increasingly so the more that we
hear on the media all the time about it. I  think writers always do have a
conscience about the things that scare them, they  wanted to write about them,
to relieve themselves. 
</P>
<P>[clips of &quot;Breathing&quot;]
</P>
<P>NM: I'm reminded by a painting in the corner here, which is a sort of satire
of a  Pre-Raphaelite painting, that I always have thought that those Victorian
painters,  the Pre-Raphaelites, were an influenece to the texture of your song
writing.
</P>
<P>KB: Yes, yes. I think that was particularly in my very early teens I was
very  enchanted by the whole romance of it, yes. They find their way into songs,
the  imagery. I think that's what happens: something attracts you because of its
 imagery and you digest it and it comes up in a song. I think that's how artists
 work; they are like magpies, picking up little bits of gold and storing them
away.
