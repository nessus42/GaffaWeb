<p><i>There is no other recording artist in the world today quite like Kate 
Bush. In the course of her twenty-seven year career, since her dramatic arrival 
at nineteen years of age in 1978 with the hauntingly beautiful and instantly 
classic ‘Wuthering Heights’, Bush has built a reputation that remains unrivalled 
in terms of musical ambition, pioneering sonics, stirring emotional content and 
sheer originality. The fact that the world has been waiting for the release of 
her eighth album, Aerial, for more than a decade has, if anything, only added to 
the air of mystique surrounding her. </i></p>
<p>“I have been genuinely touched by the sense of anticipation I’ve felt from 
people,” says Bush. “I feel really privileged that people have been waiting.”
</p>
<p>On the evidence of <i>Aerial</i>, her first album since 1993’s <i>The Red 
Shoes</i>, it may have been a long wait, but ultimately it has been a very 
rewarding one. </p>
<p>A characteristically bold and expansive work brimming with atmosphere, 
mystery, passion and complex aural detail, the twin-disc <i>Aerial</i> has 
already been declared a masterpiece by all who have heard it. </p>
<p>Realising that the amount of material she had accumulated in her time away 
was unlikely to fit onto a single CD, Bush made the decision to split the 
results in two, resulting in her first double album. </p>
<p><b>A Sea Of Honey</b><br>
Disc One, entitled <i>A Sea Of Honey</i>, comprises seven songs, ranging from 
the evocative lead-off single <i>‘King Of The Mountain’</i> through to the 
emotive reading of a lengthy section of the infinite series of numbers in ‘<i>&Pi;</i>’, to 
the playful, spell-like ‘<i>How To Be Invisible</i>’ and the moving, impressionistic 
conclusion <i>‘A Coral Room’</i>. </p>
<p><b>A Sky Of Honey</b><br>
Disc Two, <i>A Sky Of Honey,</i> is a conceptual piece in nine parts, built around 
recurring motifs of light and birdsong, following a day from afternoon through 
dusk and night and on to sunrise. </p>
<p>“What is quite nice for me doing the two discs,” ‘Aerial’s creator explains, 
“is it allows me to play with the semi-classical style which I like – space and 
acoustic music – but also the band-based stuff with lots of drums.” </p>
<p>Bush has spent her twelve years out of the public gaze dividing her time 
between preparing the songs for<i> Aerial</i> and looking after her son, Bertie, born 
in 1998. </p>
<p>“I was having to work in really short little bursts,” she says of her 
prolonged absence, “and I’d never done that before.” </p>
<p>“The way I’d always worked was to just stay in the studio for fourteen hours 
a day. I didn’t have that luxury to use the time in the same way. So there were 
lots of periods where really nothing much was happening,” Bush says. </p>
<p>“But in some ways I’d say it was very good for me to have had those kinds of 
restrictions. It was continually forcing me into a situation where I had to 
stand back from it.” </p>
<p>Brought to the attention of EMI Records at the age of sixteen by Pink Floyd’s 
David Gilmour – as a prolific schoolgirl prodigy with already around two hundred 
of her own compositions – Kate Bush famously enjoyed a three year period of 
artistic development before being launched upon an unsuspecting world. </p>
<p>Having released two albums in 1978 – <i>The Kick Inside</i> and <i>Lionheart
</i>– and 
staged the mould-breaking theatrics of the Europe-wide Tour Of Life the 
following year, Kate Bush began to assume control of her music with her 
co-production of <i>Never For Ever</i> in 1980, yielding three startling, 
story-compacting singles in the form of <i>‘Breathing’</i>, <i>‘Babooshka’</i> and 
<i>‘Army 
Dreamers’</i>. </p>
<p>Her next step, into self-production, saw the creation of <i>The Dreaming</i>, 
released in 1982, a year in the making and still hailed by many as her best 
album, showcasing an almost filmic approach to her recording craft. </p>
<p>Three years later followed <i>Hounds Of Love</i>, a stunning set of angular, 
rhythm-driven pop songs – including the strident <i>‘Running Up That Hill (A Deal 
With God)’</i> and the majestic <i>‘Cloudbusting’</i> – backed with the side-long suite 
<i>‘The Ninth Wave’</i>. </p>
<p>In 1989 <i>The Sensual World</i> followed (including musical contributions from 
David Gilmour, Nigel Kennedy and The Trio Bulgarka) and in 1993, The Red Shoes, 
featuring collaborations with Eric Clapton and Prince. </p>
<p>Over the years, Kate Bush has collected two Ivor Novello awards – in 1979 for 
Outstanding British Lyric (<i>‘The Man With The Child In His Eyes’</i>) and for 
Outstanding Contribution To British Music As A Songwriter in 2002 – while in 
1987 she scooped Best British Female Artist at the Brits. Appearing at the Q 
Awards in 2001, she received a spontaneous standing ovation from an audience 
including former Sex Pistol John Lydon, Brian Eno, Radiohead and Elvis Costello, 
when accepting the Classic Songwriter gong. </p>
<p>And then, silence, until <i>Aerial</i>. </p>
<p>The musicians credit list for Bush’s eighth album reveals new collaborations 
with drummers Steve Sanger and Peter Erskine and percussionist Bosco D’Oliveira, 
along with more familiar names such as Gary Brooker (founder of Procol Harum, 
providing Hammond organ), guitarist Dan McIntosh, drummer Stuart Elliott (who 
has appeared on every one of her albums), bassists Eberhard Weber and John 
Giblin and recording engineer/bassist Del Palmer. As such, over the years, Bush 
has gathered around her something resembling a close-knit musical family. </p>
<p>“There was a sense of being at play as well as at work,” Bush notes of the 
sessions for <i>Aerial</i>. </p>
<p>“I think that’s very important because it is so hard and so frustrating 
sometimes trying to get an idea to materialise. It’s not an easy process. I 
really like working with people who are old friends, it’s lovely.” </p>
<p>Poignantly, Aerial also features some of the last work of orchestral arranger 
Michael Kamen, who had scored for every Bush album since <i>Hounds Of Love</i> and who 
passed away only weeks after his contributions to the album were completed at 
Abbey Road studios in October 2003. </p>
<p>“What was great about Michael was his stuff was very visual,” says Bush. “He 
did such a fantastic job. It’s very hard to believe he’s not around any more.”
</p>
<p>Now, in November 2005, with the release of <i>Aerial</i>, Kate Bush is following in 
the grand tradition of groundbreaking double albums. </p>
<p>“I used to really like the double albums I bought of artists that I loved,” 
she states. “It wasn’t in a way so directly connected with you spending money on 
an object. It was somehow more of an artistic statement. It said, ‘Here’s my 
music’.” </p>
<p>The first single from <i>Aerial</i> is the hypnotic <i>'King of the Mountain'</i>. From its 
opening faint electronic pulses, to its crashing, driving climax, <i>'King of the 
Mountain'</i> is a unique piece of work that could only have come from Kate Bush.
</p>
<p>Featuring her instantly recognizable vocals, a loping dub-like rhythm and 
evocative, mysterious lyrics, <i>'King of the Mountain'</i> proves that the best things 
are worth the wait. </p>
<p>And with <i>'King of the Mountain'</i> and <i>Aerial</i> sounding as contemporary and 
timeless as all of Kate's work, they are set to introduce Kate to an entirely 
new generation of fans across the globe. </p>

<p>After years in the wilderness, the Kate Bush <i>finally</i> bounces back with 
this new single, and an album, <i>Aerial</i>, to follow. Hurrah! However, the 
question now is, has she still got what it uses after so long out of the game? 
Like, duh. hello! it's not like Lisa Scott-Lee has just taken 12 years off 
y'know, this is Kate fucking Bush we're talking about. We've watched many 
pretenders to the throne come (and go) in the last dozen years - Tori Amos, 
Fiona Apple and Bj<font face="Times New Roman">ö</font>rk to name but a few - 
but it's fair to say that no one can do bonkers like our Kate, and we're 
thrilled to announce she's as mad as ever. This haunting ode to Elvis is the 
return of the classic Kate we've all been waiting for. It's underrated yet epic, 
and reassuringly as stimulating as anything from Kate should be. Check out the 
video, and see if you too spot Rolf Harris dancing with Elvis' famous Vegas 
outfit in his arms...</p>

<b>Twelve years out of the spotlight, and Kate Bush has emerged with a new 
single and album. As her legion of fans greet this news with cheers of delight, 
there are others who can't see what all the fuss is about. Why are gay men so 
obsessed. and was it worth the wait? In anticipation of this historic release, 
Reader's Wife Chelsea Kelsey and Richard Smith both offer their differing 
perspectives on one of the UK's legendary performers.</b><br>
<br>
For the Defense: <b>Chelsea Kelsey of The Reader's Wifes</b><br>
<br>
It's 1978, the arse-end of winter and another rainy school night in the 
godforsaken suburb where I grew up. It's also a Thursday, which means two things 
in our house; Angel Delight for afters and <i>Top of the Pops</i>. Suddenly, <i>
YOU</i> are there on the TV with that lion's mane of hair and some unfeasibly 
eurythmic dancing. You appear to be singing about something sinister, possibly 
violent (bad dreams, jealously and possession all feature) but on first hearing 
it's The Voice that truly floors.<br>
<br>
The Voice. It's all the words journalists have over-used about it ever since - 
ungodly, otherworldly, out there, <i>ethereal</i> - but it's also much, much 
more. And when my first exposure to <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is over, I know 
that something - possibly the fabric of the universe itself - has altered 
forever. (I've also hardly touched my Angel Delight).<br>
<br>
Back to now, and the love affair that began all those years ago is about to be 
rekindled with the release this November of <i>Aerial</i>, the first new Kate 
Bush album in 12 years. If you want to hear it you have to go over to EMI 
Records and listen to an iPod in a locked case and then sign a statement that 
you won't even <i>discuss</i> the new record (I know somebody who's done this: 
bravely breaking the embargo, he described it as very good, very mental and 
&quot;quite drummy&quot;).<br>
<br>
Twelve years. Is it really that long? If it seems like a long time in Pop, then 
I suppose it is...if you happen to be a business-as-usual artist like Razorlight 
or Pussycat Dolls or (God help us) James Blunt. Entire careers may have flowered 
and faded in the years since the last album but, somehow, normal rules just 
don't apply with Ms Bush. Anyway, us fans and freaks are long-resigned to living 
on Kate Time, and if it takes 12 years, well, that's how long it takes. Rome 
wasn't built and all that.<br>
<br>
As for the fans themselves, they're a rum lot. Who else, do we think, could 
claim to unite today's 19-year-old club kids (most of whom have never been old 
enough to actually go and buy a new Kate Bush album on release date), the entire 
population of New York's drag queens, John Lydon and a generation of rotund 
pottery teachers from the Cotswolds? While the fans wait (and wait) there's 
always a tremendous stack of previous albums to live inside. More than any other 
artist I can think of, you don't so much listen to Kate as immerse yourself in 
her.<br>
<br>
And what a strange, passionate, downright dangerous place it is. The subject 
matter for the hit singles alone must surely comprise the unlikeliest chart of 
CV of all time, eschewing all the love'n'dancing fluff in favour of Russian folk 
takes (<i>Babooshka</i>), nuclear radiation (<i>Breathing</i>), cloud formations 
(<i>The Big Sky</i>) and WWI (<i>Army Dreamers</i>). Answers on a postcard is 
you know what &quot;the tale of George the Wipe&quot; from Moments Of Pleasure actually 
means or exactly what's going on with <i>The Man With The Child In His Eyes</i>. 
Like I said, it's Kate's world - we're just lucky enough to live there.<br>

<br>
<i>[SCENE] Kate Bush's home - an island on the Thames in Berkshire. There is a 
knock on the front door.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Kate Bush:</b> Leave me the fuck alone! I'm an eccentric and reclusive female 
recording artist!<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Erm, Kate? Sorry, it's me - Dave from EMI. Can I come in?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b><i>[Sighs]</i> Oh, I suppose so. <i>[She lets him in]<br>
</i><br>
<b>Dave:</b> Good to see you! How have you been?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Oh, the same as always - kooky but endearing. Actually, I've been 
feeling a bit rubber-bandy again recently. Shall we go into the kitchen?<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Okay...Hey, you're looking good. Nice leotard.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Sorry, I was doing my Pilates. Can you give me a minute while I 
slip into something a bit more windswept and pre-Raphaelite?<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Don't worry. I just thought we needed to have a little chat about 
your new album. It's a teensy bit overdue, love. We did try to call.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Sorry. I was in the bath...<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Since 1993?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Tish-ta. Actually, I finished it this morning. Honest!<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Wow! Unbelievable. What's it called?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No idea. Ummm...Areial?<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Mmmm - intriguing, esoteric, and with a literary reference - like 
it. Don't suppose you're have time to think about artwork?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> <i>[She takes a piece of paper from the fridge door] </i>Ta-da! 
What do you think of this, then?<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Erm, sorry, Kate, but this looks like a six-year-old did it.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> My son's seven, actually.<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Okay. So, who have you been working with?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> It's mainly little old me, as per. Brian Eno was going to help out, 
but he's been busy, 'cos there's been a war on, apparently. Luckily, my brother 
Paddy was free, so he's played mandolin on most of the tracks. Rolf Harris has 
laid down some wicked didgeridoo solos, and I've built a few tracks out of 
things I've sampled. The Hoover, the washing machine, the theme from <i>
Countdown</i>, the heartbreaking smash of glass in the bottle bank...<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Sort of a &quot;sounds of everyday&quot; thing, right? Cool.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> More &quot;Sounds of every single sodding day for the last 12 years&quot;.<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> What have you been writing about?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I think it's probably easiest if I convey the meaning of my new 
album through the medium of dance.<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Is it okay if you do it through the medium of words?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Dreams, dogs, hills, England, the gays, shoes, that sort of thing. 
But a lot of it's just stuff I half-remembered from books I read for O-Level.<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Sounds like classic Kate Bush! Wait 'till I tell the guys at EMI 
about this! When do you think you can deliver?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't want to sound like a neurotic perfectionist, but could I 
have just a little bit longer, Dave?<br>
<br>
<b>Dave:</b> Sure. When were you thinking of?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> How about Friday, December 14th, 2012?<br>

<P ALIGN="left"><b><a name="attitude01">Supernatural</a></b><br>
Attitude magazine<br>
by Nick Taylor<br>
November issue</P>
<P ALIGN="left"><i>Nick Taylor has been waiting 12 long years for the skies to open 
and<br>
the Great White Witch of Pop to return. December will be magic again!</i></P>
<P ALIGN="left">I love Bush. I don't suppose this combination of words has often 
appeared in Attitude. Judging from how quickly most moxosexuals rush from 
anything vaguely labial, Bush is a dirty word in more than just the 
anti-Capitalist movement. But fear not. Because Kate Bush (Hallelujah! Allah be 
praised!) has returned with new sounds for the first time since the invention of 
the spinning jenny. And as a fan for most of my life, I claim this space to fill 
with a thank you to Kate. </P>
<P ALIGN="left">To some, Kate Bush may appear nothing more than a dance class 
fairy, plumped up with nonsense, wreathed in chiffon and in of blinking, unless 
to the lock and loading of a rifle. To such people, the opening icicles of 
Wuthering Heights would be recognizable; they might even remember something 
about dogs swapping places with God in the mid-80s but this is where their 
knowledge of Kate begins and ends. I'm sure such people exist, but I've 
succeeded in not meeting any of them. </P>
<P ALIGN="left">The lion's share of my own life owe their first breath of 
inspiration from the strange, staring little girl, lost somewhere in a forest 
called home. Kate Bush's career began not long after I did. I was four and old 
enough to be spellbound. I don't remember badgering my parents to buy me <i>The 
Kick Inside</i>, Kate's debut album, but apparently I did. What I do remember is 
playing the vinyl single of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> on my Fisher-Price record 
player, until Robin Wollacott came to play with me and broke it. I have vague 
recollections of Kate in chain mail, swirling through the fog like a 
pre-Raphaelite siren; part Emily Bronte, part Christina Rossetti. I invented a 
language of my own and together with summoned words for cleaning products, 
tights and nappies, I pronounced the petrol station car washers the &quot;wowers&quot;, on 
account of their similarity with Kate in full sail. I wasn't a prolifically 
musical child. There was just something about Kate. </P>
<P ALIGN="left">Since then, I've spent as much time listening to Kate as I have 
thinking why Kate attracts me so much. I've broadened my church to encompass 
other moon bow pop witches, but there's always been something unmatched about 
Kate. Like a spell or a secret, Kate is private sacred and powerful. Madonna 
(bless her and forgive me) was anybody's. Not Kate. The Bush has always remained 
tantalizingly out of reach. Not for her the tuppany scratch and sniff of implant 
weeklies. Like any true artist, publicity is unnecessary when there's nothing to 
add to the art itself.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">There's certainly more than a whiff of the ridiculous to Kate's 
music, How many other artists would return from a zodiac of years with a single 
about Elvis Presley? It's the kind of shameless bravery which causes the best to 
follow assiduously, and the worst to laugh out loud. It's the banality of it, 
like singing about rubberbands, kites and coffee. That's the first sediment of 
surface. Kate sings about the ordinary and the understood, or what we thought we 
understood, until she dances too close to the idea and sends our safe 
perceptions spinning. Like the jester, who shuffles the pack, reverses the order 
and throws everything up into the air, Kate possesses the ability to stop us 
mid-laugh and twist us to tears. There aren't many people who can begin a 
psychadelia-la-la song with the line &quot;Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o&quot; and 
follow it with the pure heart bleed of <i>The Man With The Child In His Eyes</i>.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;At one level, Kate appeals because she's a very English 
pop star. Like Morrissey and Bowie, she is joyfully, woefully mired in this 
island's literary tradition which stretches back through Virginia Woolf, Oscar 
Wilde and William Shakespeare. How many artists of any gender could arrive on 
the scene with a homage to a literary tale of murderous and vengeful love set 
against the feral backdrop of northern moors? And proceed to stay at number one 
with it for six weeks? It is the kind of idiosyncrasy which scares the 
entertainment industry to death. </P>
<P ALIGN="left">She appealed to me because I'm queer, Celtic and pagan. Brought 
up by strong female spirits, my two mothers and countless broad-bosomed Welsh 
aunts, by the time I approached puberty, my rugby player build held a feminine 
spilt which was attracted to men and attuned to women. One of my earliest 
crushes was on a boy who played the saxophone. <i>Saxophone Song</i> captured 
the sense of distance between the object of my affections and my own gaze. Like 
Kate, I was in a Berlin Bar, in a corner, brooding. And I didn't even know where 
Berlin was. I felt then the ability of a voice to reach out beyond the known and 
immediate and touch me at my core; a voice which said, &quot;You are not alone.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="left">My parent's divorce had been a violent and ugly experience for 
all. Listening to Kate was a way to rescue some sense among the ruin of 
rejection. The beauty of her songs at their most haunting and melancholic 
connected with me because I was six and had already teamed the unpalatable, 
vital recipe which wove the sweet with the bitter the salt for the sour. Kate 
knew heaven could be sundered; indeed seemed to arrive in the room as destroyer 
and soother at once. I turned to Kate not as escape, but as the means to best 
meet with the braided language of conflicting emotion. Like her, I wasn't afraid 
to feel. She made me cry. She was strong enough to hold me as I did so. The 
screamed plea at the conclusion of This Woman's Word was all life's raw, 
unmannered potency. This was what life had taught me. The compulsive, redundant 
sob at our world's essential pain. Oh darling, make it go away. Just make it go 
away now.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Kate's sound is life in all its stages: becoming, thriving, 
collapsing, ending, beginning all over again. Her roots (and ours, she reminds 
us) are in the old way, the rich and eternal loam of the land. Her voice is 
singular without limit, whether it's the Kate of <i>Wow</i> reminding us that 
all the world's a stage, or Kate <i>Cloudbusting</i> showing us how to change 
the world. With Kate, we can be both suspended in gaffa and call on the world's 
first mother to protect us with circles of angels and fire. We are bank robber, 
Russian wife, black widow, archangel, nuclear protester, Iraqi men in love with 
each other. Kate takes us up into a Celtic sky; she loses us in the fog; incites 
us to dance over avenues of mangos. </P>
<P ALIGN="left">In the last few years, with Kate's absence continued and 
unapologetic, her relevance and importance seems to have grown. A <i>Q</i> award 
for lifetime achievement; cabaret impersonators; tribute nights from the Avant 
Duckies. Every new friend I make acknowledges Kate as a pivotal influence. The 
longer she holds off, the more we love her. With so much instant access, 
over-availability, someone who holds back becomes remarkable. Isn't that what's 
increasingly annoying about Big Brother? They want us to notice them so badly, 
we find ourselves fidgeting towards the other direction before we switch off. 
Kate buries herself in the bluebell dell and we break down the doors to pull her 
out. This is the first and last reason why I love her; she puts us into an 
exquisite agony of anticipation and we thank her for it. </P>
<P ALIGN="left">Kate you've blessed us with nourishment in these shrink-wrapped, 
ill-fed times. And if I never heard another note from you I would live gifted. 
This is a small page which was written to give these moments back To those we 
love. To those who will survive.</P>

<p>Wildly visionary songs about nuclear fallout, bumming, incest, Hitler, 
pick-pocketing, witches, Peter Pan, Ken Livingstone and wedding day massacres 
aside, Kate Bush is the most normal person in the world. She's just not the most 
normal celebrity - lacking, as she does, the standard attention-hungry ego. So 
rather than worrying about self-promotion or public perception, Britain's most 
original and influential female singer/songwriter has focussed on acheiving the 
ultimate in unbridled, unself-conscious masterpiece. </p>
<p>Bush followers, who have been gnawing at their flesh for 12 excruciating 
years (since 1993's The Red Shoes) in antsy anticipation of this eighth studio 
album, will weep with joy. In part from relief, that after all this time Ms Bush 
has delivered 84 exquisitely non-commercial minutes to rival her most celebrated 
Hounds of Love album. But also because the music itself is glistening with such 
euphoria as to render anti-depressants unnecessary. Seven years ago Kate gave 
birth to Bertie. If ever an album conveyed a mother viewing the world with the 
wide-eyed wonder of youth again, then Aerial does. </p>
<p>Debut single King of the Mountain, the opening track on the first album 
(entitled A Sea of Honey), is a red herring, though. The whistling winds and 
haunting musings about Elvis are like the darkest hour just before dawn. 
Daylight doesn't break just yet, mind. First you have funky-bassed Pi, where 
Kate sings the mathematical calculation to 84 decimal places. (Would love to see 
Jessica Simpson attempt that). Next comes Bertie, a rinky-dink paean to her son, 
hailing directly from the 16th century, thanks to Renaissance guitars and a 
three-time jig. The mood saddens with Mrs. Bartolozzi. Remembering when her now 
late husband returned home so muddied that she had to clean all his clothes, she 
watches the washing machine spin round and mourns. &quot;Slooshy, sloshy/Slooshy 
sloshy/Get that dirty shirty clean.&quot; Though seemingly uninfluenced by pop music 
of the last 12 years, Kate's production, particularly on How To Be Invisible, is 
cutting-edge. Other-worldly electro-glitches dance around her voice as she 
conjures a piss-take witches' spell: &quot;Eye of Braille/Hem of anorak/Stem of 
wallflower/Hair of doormat&quot;. Fans of This Woman's Work will swoon at A Coral 
Room where Kate's incomparably beautiful voice - now even richer - soars over 
sumptuous piano chords as she laments her late mother. This is the English rose 
of old, emotions erupting, lava-like. </p>
<p>Day breaks on the second disc, A Sky of Honey, which is homogenized by 
sprinklings of sampled and imitated birdsong as Kate guides us through a perfect 
summer's day in the countryside. It's impossibly poetic. Sunset opens with a 
running stream of a piano accompaniment, with pizzicato double bass, you're then 
transported to Spain with a flamenco dance of the utmost gay abandon. The effect 
is so exhilarating it'll have you stomping your feet and flapping the ruffles of 
an imaginary red dress. Or perhaps that's just me. On Somewhere in Between 
you're up a mountain drinking in the vista, as rhumba-esque rhythms infuse her 
marvelling at the dimming light. Night has fallen now with Nocturn seeing our 
storyteller head to the beach. &quot;No one is here/We stand in the Atlantic/We 
become panoramic.&quot; A thumping beat climaxes as the sun comes up. &quot;Rising and 
rising in a sea of honey/A sky of honey&quot;. Aerial, the finale, finds Kate wanting 
to &quot;go up onto the roof&quot;, as a bravura electric guitar solo crackles like an 
aerial conducting lightning. A crash sounds, leaving the birds tweeting and 
fading into the distance. </p>
<p>Worth the wait? Every. Last. Second </p>

Princess Julia reviews Aerial, the hugely anticipated new album from Kate Bush.<br>
<br>
Oh, how we love Kate Bush. Who can forget the lines &quot;There's fiver. There's a 
ten shilling note. Remember them...?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kate has always had a way of describing things in her most unique way and her 
latest body of work is no exception, she's always been the Queen of poignant 
verse.<br>
<br>
Aerial is a concept LP; a two-part excursion. &quot;A Sea Of Honey&quot; being disc one 
and &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot; being disc two. All the elements are here - beautiful piano 
accompaniment. drums, atmospheric sound bites, &quot;Space and acoustic music&quot; and, 
of course, the wafting and mesmerizing vocal style that Kate Bush possesses.<br>
<br>
&quot;King of the Mountain&quot; is the debut single to be released and sets the precedent 
for the Bush experience to unfold. The next song called &quot;Pi&quot; put me in mind of a 
friend, &quot;Oh he love, he love, he love. He does love his numbers&quot;. There's 
something very personal, romantic and dreamlike when she sings &quot;Bertie&quot;, a song 
penned for her son: &quot;Sweet kisses, three wishes, lovely Bertie. The most 
willful, the most beautiful, the most truly fantastic smile I've seen&quot;. It's 
touching and sweet but not sickly.<br>
<br>
In &quot;Mrs Bartolozzi&quot; she sings of romance and mundanity. How she manages to sing 
the lines &quot;Washing machine, washing machine&quot; with such conviction is beyond me, 
but it works! In track &quot;How To Be Invisible&quot; she weaves a spell: &quot;Eye of 
Braille, Hem of Anorak, Stem of wallflower, Hair of doormat&quot;. She's a sorceress 
with a modern formula of ironic lyrics. In &quot;Joanie&quot; she sings of a heroine (Joan 
of Arc springs to mind, but it could easily apply to Joan Dairy Queen!) her 
vocal range is stunning: &quot;Joanie, Joanie wears a golden cross. And she looks so 
beautiful in her armour&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prelude&quot; and &quot;Prologue&quot; are captivating snippets that set the scene for &quot;A Sky 
of Honey&quot;. By now you should be truly lost in Kate's adventure, so somehow the 
idea of Rolf Harris popping into the story shouldn't throw you too much. &quot;An 
Architects Dream&quot; and &quot;Painters Link&quot; both feature Rolf on vocals. Oh, and I'm 
loving this line from &quot;Sunset&quot;: &quot;We may live on in comets and stars&quot;. The 
Bush-isms just keep coming, like in &quot;Nocturn&quot; where she sings of leaving the 
city and, finally, &quot;Aerial&quot; is the most upbeat track on this LP. You really feel 
the elation in her voice as she sings of being &quot;Up, up high on the roof&quot;. That's 
the thing about Kate Bush. She somehow taps into a dream-zone that is timeless 
and classic.</p>

<p>There’s something quintessentially English about Kate Bush. She’s a bit of an 
enigma really – largely due to her desire and ability to stay, so successfully, 
out of the limelight. As a consequence, all sorts of myths have built up around 
her; myths that she herself has been quick to dispel in the few interviews she’s 
given for the promotion of her new album, Aerial.<br>
<br>
The Kate Bush story starts back in the 70’s. As a girl she’d spend time in her 
parents barn messing around on the organ and soon progressed to writing her own 
songs which, through the help of a family friend and - legend has it - Pink 
Floyd’s lead guitarist David Gilmour, brought her to the attention of music 
giant EMI records. <br>
<br>
Aged 16, Kate signed a record deal but unlike the use ‘em up and spit ‘em out 
mentality of today's recording industry, she was given time to evolve as an 
artist. <br>
<br>
Studying dance, mime and singing while continuing to hone her very individual 
song writing skills, it wasn’t until she was 17 that an unsuspecting world got 
to hear 'Wuthering Heights' for the first time. The source material for that 
first hit came from Emily Brontë's novel of the same name and it’s set the tone 
for all of Kate’s future work. <br>
<br>
In the month that also sees the release of Madonna’s new album, Confessions Of A 
Dance Floor (out 14 November 2005), I’m struck by the similarities and 
differences between these two great artists who both share the same age, both 
seem very settled in happy marriages (a picture of domestic bliss, no less), and 
both of whom are mothers with young children. And yet, while Madonna is 
inspiring everyone to hit the dance floor right now, Kate is reflecting on her 
tranquil life miles away from the glossy world of pop.<br>
<br>
Aerial is a double album with individual volumes entitled A Sea of Honey and A 
Sky of Honey.<br>
<br>
A Sea of Honey features the excellent first single and ode to Elvis, 'King of 
the Mountain', a song connected to a mathematical equation called 'Pi', and also 
the song 'Mrs Bartolozzi', in which Kate can be heard singing the words “washing 
machine” over and over and over again. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile A Sky of Honey is the ultimate chill out album which takes you on a 
journey from dawn 'til dusk through a tranquil English day, featuring birdsong, 
rain, a painter played by Rolf Harris, the sound of children playing somewhere 
far off in the distance, and Kate herself laughing hysterically in the 
background.<br>
<br>
‘But is it any good?’ I hear you ask. Well, it’s very ‘Kate Bush’ and yes, I 
love it because it’s a window into her world where you can drift off and get 
totally lost.<br>
<br>
Aerial is Kate’s eighth studio album and her first release since The Red Shoes 
in 1993. We’ve had to wait some 12 years, but it’s definitely been worth the 
wait.</p>

<p>Those of you who care have probably just been discharged from hospital after 
recovering from the shock that Kate was back with a new album. With such a long 
gap since her last offering – the slightly disappointing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>The Red Shoes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 12 years ago(!) – there's the 
fear that anything she served up would be greedily snatched up out of sheer 
desperation, even if it was a double-tracked recording of her doing scales. So, 
what is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ariel</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like? 
And is it any good? Well, it's quite hard to make a judgment if you're only 
allowed to hear it in one sitting under the watchful eye of record company 
bosses, but the overall impression is that it's more cohesive than 
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Red Shoes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, 
perhaps as inventive and challenging as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The 
Dreaming</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, while also managing to be something 
altogether new. There are two CDs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A Sea of Honey</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 
consists of seven separate songs, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A Sky of 
Blue</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a song cycle of nine linked tracks that 
carries the listener from dawn to dusk and back to sunrise again. Many of the 
songs have a fluid structure that eschews the traditional verse/chorus pattern, 
and contemporary sampling and programming techniques reminiscent of Radiohead's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>Kid A</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> crop up in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>
King of the Mountain</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>How To Be Invisible</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, as do a Renaissance viols 
ensemble (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bertie</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->). 
Fans might harp back to the days of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Cloud Busting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 
and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Man With The Child In His Eyes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, 
but do you really want to travel a path already trodden?</p>

<p align="left">Well, that was some wait... but 12 years after The Red Shoes, 
Kate Bush makes her eagerly-awaited return. Spread over two-discs, Bush's new 
album is unlike most of the music you'll hear in the charts, and it's as 
difficult to pigeonhole as ever.<br>
<br>
First disc, A Sea of Honey, opens with the current single 'King Of The Mountain' 
(her first top 5 hit for 20 years), and boasts a range of styles and sounds. 
From the rhythmic flow she gives Pythagorus' theorum in ['Pi'] to the 
renaissance abandonment of 'Bertie' (a love song to her seven-year old son), the 
spell-casting poetry of 'How To Be Invisible' to the breathy French vocals on 'Joanni'. 
You never know where you'll end up next, but this far the journey's so 
refreshing, you're just happy to see where it leads. As always, Kate makes the 
mundane seem bizarre, highlighted perfectly by the already infamous 'Mrs 
Bartolozzi'. Who else could write a song about a washing machine... 'slooshy 
sloshy, slooshy sloshy, get that dirty shirt clean'?<br>
<br>
The first disc draws to a close with 'A Coral Room', a captivating track about 
her mother's death that highlights Bush at her best, relying on just her vocals 
and piano.<br>
<br>
On the second, more conceptual disc, A Sky Of Honey, we journey deeper into Bush 
country. Birds sing as we travel across the musical landscape, joined by Rolf 
Harris as 'the painter', and Bertie, as 'the sun'. The music has a filmic feel 
that soothes, intrigues and exhilarates at the same time, but there are enough 
quirks to make it pure Kate. By the time you reach the closing title track 
you're truly spellbound: 'I feel I gotta be up on the roof', she sings over the 
album's most uptempo number, and you can't help but want to join her in the 
celebration.</p>

<p align="left">For the pretentious, purchase this to boost your dinner party 
chitchat. For true lovers of popular music, purchase this album because you owe 
it to yourself. To add that epic feel, this album is a two CD set. Takes in a 
breadth of musical influences and combines them with her powerful and visual 
lyricism.</p>
