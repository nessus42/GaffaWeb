<P>The Tour Of Life 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush On Tour: documentary report on the preparations for the Tour of
Life,  aired on U.K. TV programme Nationwide, April 3, 1979. This film presents
a valuable  look at Kate's preparations for the Tour of Life concerts. There are
brief interview  sections featuring Kate, her brothers John Carder Bush and
Paddy Bush, and her  dance instructor and co-choreographer Anthony Van Laast. At
the end of the film  Kate is interviewed in a recording studio where she is
working on her third album,  Never For Ever. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above comment by IED] 
</P>
<P>A: Announcer 
</P>
<P>I: Interviewer 
</P>
<P>K: Kate 
</P>
<P>[Parts of the Hammer Horror video are played, and the announcer starts 
speaking over it] 
</P>
<P>A: On July the thirtieth Kate Bush was twenty-one. A busseling, always
active  person, she was hard at work on her next album after eighteen months of 
calculated success. A convent girl from Bexley in Kent, she'd been playing music
 with her brothers almost before she could walk. Her father, a doctor, had
always  been interested in their songs and their singing. And by age 16, Kate
had already  been spotted by EMI as potential talent. But the family and record
company  agreed, that Kate Bush should wait several years before launching a
full blast  career. A period of apprenticeship that gave her the stability to
survive the star  making process. 
</P>
<P>I: The first time you sang in public, do you remember that? 
</P>
<P>K: That was about two years ago in a pub in Lewisham. [Laughs] And I was so 
scared, I really was. But, once you're up there it's different, you know you
just  forget all about it because they're there to see you and you have to give
it to  them. 
</P>
<P>I: Was it a good reception? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it was. I mean, considering it was a pub and we were totally
unknown. They  were very good, very respectful. It was good, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Have you had bad experiences? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, a couple in the pubs, actually, because sometimes you get audiences
that  you can't predict. And one particular night we were in Putney on the eve
of the  football match between Scotland and England and all these Scottish boys
were in  there and they were mad, they were just mad. They had flags waving 
everywhere, and no-one could see the stage because all the guys were getting up 
on the stage and putting their arms around you, and it was a bit hard to keep 
singing when everyone was, like, getting up on stage and poking sticks in your 
eye. But they were good, they were good people. 
</P>
<P>I: Did you ever consider doing something else, other than being a singer? 
</P>
<P>K: When I was at school I wanted to be a vet and a physiatrist, but I didn't
really, I  didn't really want to be that was just, I suppose, to keep people
happy to think  that if I did get a career it would be a straight one. But it
wasn't what I wanted  to do at all. 
</P>
<P>I: Did you do things like A levels and O levels? 
</P>
<P>K: I took O levels and my mock A's but I left before... 
</P>
<P>I: How many O's did you get? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] I got ten. 
</P>
<P>I: Ten! 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: They must have been disappointed when you went off to sing? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think so no. I think they thought I was a bit foolish. But, um, I
though it  was right. 
</P>
<P>I: Was there one day when you decided, &quot;That's it! I'm going to be a
singer, I'm  going to make that a career?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Yes there was! I didn't think there would have been, but one day I was
with a  friend in a park, and I just knew that was what I wanted to do. I had to
leave  school and I had to do it. And I'm very glad I did! 
</P>
<P>[Announcer in front of Liverpool Empire] 
</P>
<P>A: In early January this year, Kate Bush had never performed before an
important  live audience. She had several successful singles to her name, a
couple of albums  in the charts, a string of TV appearances. But in a sense, she
was a media singer.  When she took the decision to go on tour, no one doubted
how important it could  prove to her career. Cause most live artists make their
mistakes either in private,  or before a very small audience. Tonight, here at
the Liverpool Empire, Kate Bush  starts at the top, before several thousand. She
can't afford to fail. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes of Kate and several people discussing plans for the tour] 
</P>
<P>A: The planning started in ernest three months ago. A series of corridor
discussions  led to phone calls and then a production meeting. Time, space, and
even furniture  can never be found. And most of the early, and therefore
important, decisions  were taken where people just ended up. Sometimes in the
back room of a friend  of a friend. 
</P>
<P>[A bit of discussion between several people and Kate discussing plans:] 
</P>
<P>Has anybody spoken to the musicians union about this? 
</P>
<P>PRI? 
</P>
<P>No the EMU. Has anybody mentioned it to the EMU. 
</P>
<P>Not specifically no. 
</P>
<P>Because I have heard instances before of people using tape where the EMU
have  picked up on it. You've re-recorded the back track with the band? 
</P>
<P>We ARE re-recording it. 
</P>
<P>We are re-recording it. 
</P>
<P>We ARE re-recording it. 
</P>
<P>A: There's no agency for tour personnel. It's who you know and, more
important,  who's available. All together, the tour would employ forty people.
While the  production team was still coming together, Kate Bush was working on
her  dancing. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes of Kate entering the dance studio and doing dancing exercises] 
</P>
<P>A: Now you might think that Kate is in pretty good shape. So the dancing
instructor  had three weeks to produce a super-fit body capable of enduring two
hours of  grueling exertion. 
</P>
<P>	A doctor's daughter, not yet twenty-one, with all the pressures of a two
hundred  thousand pound tour on her shoulders. Selecting and rejecting the best
advice she  could find and buy. 
</P>
<P>Anthony Van Laast: One of our problems is that Kate is dancing better and
better. I  mean I'm teaching her, and she's working...It's incredible how far
she's got. I  wouldn't have thought it was possible. And the problem now is that
she's getting  so good at dancing that it's going to be hard now to keep her
from dancing so  that she can sing properly. I mean it would be fantastic if we
could put the whole  show on recorder and then she could mine it and then dance.
We can't do that.  She's got to sing it. So we've got to fit the dancing to the
singing. 
</P>
<P>I: You mean she would be out of breath? 
</P>
<P>Anthony Van Laast: Oh yeah, she couldn't dance the way she could dance
possibly  and sing at the same time. So somehow we've got to work it out so that
it all fits  in properly. 
</P>
<P>[More scenes of Kate working out dance routines] 
</P>
<P>A: The broader ideas were usually Kate's. The choreography often a case of
trial  and error, with Anthony Van Laast cutting back on her more enthusiastic 
contortions. Nearly every day meant shaping another song, or perfecting the one 
they'd started yesterday. 
</P>
<P>K: It's important that the visuals are just emphasizing the music because
it's not a  dance show, it's a music show that's being illustrated with
movement, and it's  important that they both complement each other. And I've
only...I mean I'm not  a dancer, I'm just learning to dance, and what I can do
I'll try to put across in  the show. But I'm not a dancer, I just love dancing.
And I want to be able to  learn as much as I can. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of Kate and dancers rehearsing &quot;Kite&quot;] 
</P>
<P>A: Every lunch time, after leaving her dancing practice physically drained,
she'd  drive across the Thames to Greenwich, to rehearse the music at Wolf
studios, the  best available place, with the right facilities for just running
through the songs  time, and time, and time again. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of Kate and band rehearsing &quot;Kite&quot;. Kate stops the song
with &quot;UGH!&quot; motion] 
</P>
<P>A: However many times they'd tried it before, they still kept going, until
it was  perfect every time. Whereas with the dancing she was still uncertain and
happy  to listen, with the music Kate Bush knew exactly what she wanted - a
tight,  punchy sound, if anything better than the record. 
</P>
<P>Band Member: We're not just reproducing the albums. When you're a band, you 
have you're own identity, and if you're just reproducing albums, there's not 
much point in having a band. You know, you might as well just play the album. 
</P>
<P>I: Does she ever lose her temper with you? 
</P>
<P>Band member: No! I mean... 
</P>
<P>K: What? 
</P>
<P>I: Do you ever loose your temper with him? 
</P>
<P>K: Me??? Lose my temper? No!!! Come on, let's get on with it! [laughs]
</P>
<P>[Kate singing Wow] 
</P>
<P>K: &quot;Wow&quot; we've got to get together more, because it's not sounding
as it should be  yet. It's not tight, they have to be tight. And especially the
fact that we are going  to be doing movement to the music, the music has to be
very, very together and  precise. And that's what we're trying to achieve. 
</P>
<P>K: I think the main reason why they listen to me is because [laughs] I'm
paying their  wages and it's my music. And I think, they have enough respect for
me, I hope,  not to turn round and say &quot;you don't know what you're talking
about.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I: How much like the record will your music finally be, in the concert? 
</P>
<P>K: That is a problem, because obviously the albums have been very carefully 
produced and you've got mixed levels and everything. And so live work, to a 
certain extent, we couldn't do it exactly as the album is, even if we wanted to 
because it wouldn't come across in a strong way. For a live performance, you 
have to be aware of the fact that making things more obvious so's that people
can  hear them. Trying to possibly make songs quicker. 
</P>
<P>[More Wow rehearsal, talk to Paddy] 
</P>
<P>A: It was a combination of strong personality and discipline that kept Kate
Bush in  control of eight accomplished musicians. Some of them playing
professionally  while she was still at school. And she had the help of her two
brothers. One of  them, Paddy, had even found special instruments for the tour.

</P>
<P>I: What do you call it? 
</P>
<P>Paddy: It's called a strumento de porco, that's it's real name, or at least
the name  that Portoreas gave it - he was a writer on musical instruments in
seventeen  century. 
</P>
<P>I: What do you use it for? 
</P>
<P>Paddy: Well we use it for a number with an Islamic flavour to it called
Kashka From  Baghdad. And it sounds like a santer [???] which is traditional
Arabian  instrument played with hammers, just slightly. 
</P>
<P>I: You're Kate's brother aren't you. 
</P>
<P>Paddy: [Smiles] Yeah, 'fraid so. 
</P>
<P>I: Is it a sort of a bit of a family business, really? 
</P>
<P>Paddy: Um, well yes and no. I mean like, Kate and I have been making music 
together for years and years, on different levels, you know. But I mean, there's
 always been music in our family. My older brother John, he played. And I was in
 a band with him when I was about thirteen or fourteen. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you nervous about the concert tour? 
</P>
<P>Paddy: A little apprehensive, no I think it will be good fun, actually.
Really good fun.  I mean we're so well rehearsed as far as it goes, and the
music will take care of  itself. 
</P>
<P>[Sheperton studio scene] 
</P>
<P>A: By early march, the whole team moved out to Sheperton, for more space and
 practice. The music was finally how she wanted it. But the other details had
yet to  click. Some of the equipment had proven unsuitable. And more still had
to be  ordered, often costing thousands of pounds. And above all one major
problem had  yet to be solved. She wouldn't be able to dance and sing and hold a
microphone  at the same time. An entirely new vocal sound system would have to
be  developed. 
</P>
<P>I: How complicated has the sound been for the tour? 
</P>
<P>Engineer: Ah, very complicated actually. [Inaudible] Mainly the miking up of
Kate  herself, um, from the dance point of view. 
</P>
<P>I: How have you solved that? 
</P>
<P>Engineer: With a very small microphone! Small mike on a boom arm, its gotta
be  used from the side of her head. 
</P>
<P>A: Half a dozen complete outfits were in thier final stage. Every single one
capable  of being changed quickly between songs. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of Kate discussing a piece of fabric, while smoking!] 
</P>
<P>Fabric Lady: I think that without actually having cobwebs all over you, I
think this is  the nearest you're going to get to cobwebs. 
</P>
<P>Kate: It's beautiful. 
</P>
<P> A: With three weeks to go, Kate Bush was more like an executive than a
singer,  making a series of decisions almost every hour. Every detail, every
color, every  texture, she helped to decide. Even the choice of the crew food
was party  influenced by her and produced by her other brother John. 
</P>
<P>John: Well we've got nothing very difficult, but there are a lot of
vegetarians  involved - about sixteen. And my wife's been cooking for the last
few days, and  it's working out real well. Everybody like it. It's all going
very fast. 
</P>
<P>I: It's almost a vegetarian tour, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>John: Yeah, you could say that. You know, well it's good food because it
lets people  carry on working afterwards. They're not walking around really laid
out with an  enormous, great, meat meal. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of the Rainbow] 
</P>
<P>A: Last week, the preparation climaxed at London's Rainbow theatre
-specially  booked for the final run-through. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of rehearsing Wow] 
</P>
<P>A: In conditions of surprising secrecy, the last wrinkles were gradually
ironed out.  After two and a half months of intense hard work, everyone,
including Kate  herself was holding up well. By then, the entire tour, finishing
with four nights at  the Palladium, had been sold out. 
</P>
<P>[More scenes of Wow] 
</P>
<P>K: The most difficult ones are where I've got the headset and I'm moving a
lot. It's  an amazing feeling of freedom, because, like, there's nothing in your
hands yet  you can hear your voice being projected miles away -it's incredible.
But it's not  quite in it's full design yet. There are just a few things that
are wrong with it.  And it's not always right in front of my mouth, but we're
getting that seen to. 
</P>
<P>I: With only one week to go before opening, how do you think the rehearsals
have  gone so far? 
</P>
<P>K: I think they're going very well. There's a lot of rushing, but there
always is at  this time and that's when mosts get done. I think it's going well.

</P>
<P>[Scene of rehearsing Kite] 
</P>
<P>A: The plan was for a fully integrated dancing, singing, clowning,
conjuring, acting,  poetical, effects show. Throwing everything in and just
hoping it would hold  together. On the last dress rehearsal it finally did, and
although at first they  wouldn't admit it, they were ready for Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes from opening night] 
</P>
<P>A: Ther'll never be another night quite like the first Kate Bush show at the
 Liverpool Empire. Even parts of the audience were nervous, wondering if the 
young lady with brittle voice had brittle nerves as well. But her manager,
Hillary  Walker, was carefully hiding any fears she had. 
</P>
<P>Hilary: It has been hard work every day, seven days a week. But it's really
been a  question of getting the right people to do the right jobs at the right
time and  pulling them all together and making it work. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you nervous about tonight? 
</P>
<P>Hilary: Excited, I think. I think we all are. Yes we're all nervous, of
course we are.  But things cost. 
</P>
<P>I: It means a lot doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>Hilary: Yes it does. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes from the opening night, with photos mixed in] 
</P>
<P>A: After just one song, we knew. She was a sensation. Her reputation was
safe. And  more, Kate Bush was thoroughly enjoying herself during the great test
of her life. 
</P>
<P>[Scene in dressing room afterwards, popping a bottle] 
</P>
<P>I: [Hands Kate flowers] [inaudible]...flowers. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh! Bless you! Thank you. [Kisses him] 
</P>
<P>I: You really happy tonight? 
</P>
<P>K: Did you enjoy the show? 
</P>
<P>I: You really happy? 
</P>
<P>K: I'm knocked out, I can't believe that audience. 
</P>
<P>I: Worth that three months hard work? 
</P>
<P>K: I'm just completely knocked out, really. That's amazing. 
</P>
<P>A: In all, the six week sell-out tour was seen by a hundred thousand. Kate
Bush had  proved, to her audience at least, an all around entertainer. She's
back now to the  recording studio, comfortably making her third album. 
</P>
<P>[Kate in the studio] 
</P>
<P>I: Don't you have a problem now? What next? How you're going to follow the 
success? 
</P>
<P>K: Well you see people say this to me and I don't really look at it that
way, because  it's not a matter of following success. It's things have happened,
you've done  them in the past. And you see things wrong in them, and you want to
go on, and  you want to do them right. And I think that's all it is, you know?
It's just the  desire to want to keep doing things better. And I don't really
see it as following a  great success, cause if I did I'd get really paranoid and
I probably wouldn't be  able to do a thing. I'd be so worried about doing
something better than that.  Whereas you're just in the present moment and
you're doing what you're  doing. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you likely to change your style completely, suddenly? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know. I'd quite like to in a way, because I think change is a
very  important thing on any level. And I do want to change, not only as a
person, but  as a musician. And I think its starting to happen a little. Just
slightly different. 
</P>
<P>I: What's the most satisfying thing you do then? 
</P>
<P>K: The most satisfying thing? I guess when you've actually written the song.
And  you think about what's going to happen to it, in the future, the fact that
it maybe  will have strings on it and voices. 
</P>
<P>I: Who do you first play it to? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, it always used to be my father. When I lived at home, the first
thing I'd do  was grab him out of his chair and say &quot;listen to this.&quot;
And I'd put him down and  play him all this rubbish. But now I think it's
probably either Jon Kelly, my  engineer, or one of my brothers. And still my
father, now and again. It's always  got to be someone who I know their judgement
is good, people I trust. 
</P>
<P>I: And if they said it was rubbish. 
</P>
<P>K: If they said it was rubbish I'd think about it, but if I didn't think it
was rubbish  then I'd still carry on with it. You have to believe in yourself.
You can't just  accept what other people say all the time, otherwise you become
them and not  yourself. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you ever worry that your confidence might go? 
</P>
<P>K: It goes! Yes it goes a lot and you sit there and think &quot;I shouldn't,
you know... Oh!  where's my purpose?...I'm nothing.&quot; And then something
will happen that will  make you see that you're just a tiny little thing just
trying to do your best and  that's all you can do, so that's cool. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you ambitious? 
</P>
<P>K: I think I must be. I don't think I want to be ambitious, but I must be to
want to  put up with all this, to carry on. 
</P>
<P>I: You're now just over twenty one, and you've made it. What is there left
to do  now? 
</P>
<P>K: Everything!!! Yeah, I haven't really begun, yet. I've begun on one level,
but then  that's all gone now so you begin again. I think... 
</P>
<P>I: Is there ever a chance that you might give up, get married, settle down,
be an  ordinary mother, say? 
</P>
<P>K: Obviously there is a chance, because I'm a human, and humans are very 
unpredictable. But, ah, I don't know. I don't see that happening to me, not for
a  while. I've got so much do to and I think freedom is important to be able to
do  all those things. 
</P>
<P>I: What will Kate Bush be like at thirty-one, any idea? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know, probably a few more lines. [Laughs] I hope they're happy
ones. 
</P>
<P>I: And a few more songs. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I hope so. That's what I want to do, that's what I'm here for.
