<p>hello all...just got back from germany and am slowly readjusting to the grind 
again. i've got a few tidbits to share first though: 
</p>

<p>- however, said guy is not a total asshole as he kindly gave me a copy of what he 
said was a promotional cassette that KaTe recorded for the release of the kick inside 
(in germany, i would presume). the most interesting thing about this tape (besides 
KaTe's utter idealism which i will transcribe for you momentarily) is that the songs 
that are on it *are not* the same versions that were released on the album. the 
differences are subtle, but they are there: different instrumentation, diffrent mixes, 
etc. 
</p>

<p>so for you reading pleasure, i now produce a transcipt of said tape: 
</p>


<p>[A stripped down version of The Kick Inside&quot; is played. KaTe's voice seems less 
full than it does on the lp - I haven't fully compared them yet. It fades after the first 
verse and is used as a backing track for the following words.] 
</p>


<p>&quot;Hello everyone. This is KaTe Bush and I'm here with my new album The Kick 
Inside and I hope you enjoy it. The album is something that has not just suddenly 
happened. It's been years of work because since I was a kid, I've always been 
writing songs and it was really just collecting together all the best songs that I had 
and putting them on the album, really years of preparation and inspiration that got it 
together. As a girl, really, I've always been into words as a form of communication. 
And even at school I was really into poetry and english and it just seemed to turn 
into music with the lyrics, that you can make poetry go with music so well. that it 
can actually become something more than just words; it can become something 
special. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The way I've always worked is to be with the piano. I never write songs without 
the piano - it's always me and it and we communicate. And I always write the words 
with the tune - they seem to come together and it's very much a thing of moods. if 
the chord I'm playing is telling me something, then the words will come from that. 
If it is a minor feel, it will be a sad song because minor chords are very sad things. If 
it's a major chord, it will be a slightly maybe, rockier, happier song. 
</p>

<p>&quot;What happens is that I sit down and I start playing the piano and it's the 
progression of chords that comes out that actually leads to the song. Until I sit down 
at the piano and have no idea what's going to happen. Sometimes, before I go there, 
maybe I'll have an idea that I've picked up from a film or just from talking to 
someone about something I've never known about before. You can find inspiration 
can click in so many different ways: it can be something completely out of the blue 
that you'll suddenly think 'i really want to write a song.' I think that's how it 
works though. I think art is about spontaneous feelings and feedback of people, 
objects, whatever. It's just a continuous process of creation. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The song 'The Kick Inside', the title track, was inspired by a traditional folk 
song and it was an area that I wanted to explore because it's one that is really 
untouched and that is one of incest. There are so many songs about love, but they are 
always on such an obvious level. This songs is about a brother and a sister who are in 
love and the sister becomes pregnant by her brother. And because it is so taboo and 
unheard of, she kills herself in order to preserve her brother's name in the family. 
The actual song is in fact the suicide note. The sister is saying 'I'm doing it for you' 
and 'don't worry, I'll come back to you someday.' this is it.&quot; 
</p>

<p>[&quot;The Kick Inside&quot; is played.] 
</p>

<p>&quot;'I'll send you love to zeus oh by the time you read this...' 
</p>

<p>&quot;That was the song 'The Kick Inside' off my new album released on EMI. I hope 
you liked it. this is KaTe Bush speaking&quot; 
</p>

<p>[commercial break?] 
</p>

<p>[&quot;Feel It&quot; begins and fades] 
</p>

<p>&quot;This is KaTe Bush again. I think maybe the reason I write songs is maybe I need 
to my express myself. That I need to be heard by people, maybe just to feel that I 
am someone for some reason. But I don't really think it matters why as long as what 
I'm doing has some purpose and if it, in any way, makes other people feel happy, 
which is all I'm into. I really hope that listen to the song will enjoy it and have fun. 
</p>

<p>&quot;For me, age is very nebulous concept. It's something you can't really label on 
people. You meet people are maybe sixty years old are like a kid. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think life is all about your attitudes and how you actually see things. I was 
lucky enough to be born into a family that consists of very observant people. 
They're very aware of people's motivations and why they do things. I think I'm 
very lucky because a lot of that has rubbed off on me. Since I've been a kid, I've 
always been aware of observing people and trying to observe myself and why I do 
things. It's such an incredibly fascinating process the way people work, I can't help 
but be inspired by all that goes around me. It's just incredible. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think I was very lucky cos when I was a small child, my brothers were 
extremely musical. They were into traditional music: English and Irish folk. They 
were always playing stuff on the record players and had their own bands and go 
around the clubs. I got quite involved with it. I would sing along with them and sing 
harmonies. I think it was important cos when you are very young, your mind is so 
open for new stimulus and direction. I think it was given to me then, so I didn't 
really have to spend maybe ten years finding out what I was here for. I think that's 
been an important part of my life. 
</p>

<p>&quot;My other musical influences really have been things from the radio, obviously, 
because what you listen to are the things that are going on. And again, what my 
brothers were playing on the radio. At a later stage, I started seeking out my own 
stimulus and that came from people like, um, especially billie holiday. She was a 
really important thing to happen to me. Her voice just really did things to me. So 
emotional and so tearing. I still can't get over how incredible her voice was and her 
presence. I'm into more progressive people, I guess, like david bowie and roxy 
music and steely dan. I think they are a very underestimated group, especially in 
England. They really are an important musical influence. And nearly anything really. 
I love so much music. I think that's the amazing thing about it: music can go into 
every corner of every room. There's so many different styles of music. Everyone is 
great in their own right - it's just a matter of personal taste, really. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think also one of the most amazing things about music, especially for the last 
twenty or thirty years, is the fact that we've been able to pre- serve it on record. So 
it's no longer someone jamming in a little club in the thirties in a little smoky place. 
It's an eternal process. You can listen to people that have died maybe twenty years 
ago. You can see them on the television. You can see them moving and young. They 
are no longer there. You've captured that moment, purely through mechanical 
things, which is really quite ironic because music is such a pure emotional thing to 
be captured on such a mechanical modern contraption. But it's the only way we can 
do it. 
</p>

<p>&quot;This next song's called 'Wuthering Heights' and it's my single in England. It's 
from the novel called Wuthering Heights - you probably might know it better as the 
film. It's about the end of the film where Cathy has actually died and she's coming 
back as a spirit across the moors to come and get Heathcliff again. And it just struck 
me very strongly because it shows alot about human beings and how if they can't 
get what they want, they will go to such extremes in order to do it. This is exactly 
what she did. She wouldn't even be alone when she was dead. She had to come back 
and get him. I just found it really amazing.&quot; 
</p>

<p>[&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is played.] 
</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that song was 'Wuthering Heights' and this KaTe Bush talking to you and 
I hope you're still with us and having a good time. That was from my new album, 
The Kick Inside on EMI records.&quot; 
</p>

<p>[commercial break?] 
</p>

<p>[&quot;Feel It&quot; begins again and fades again...] 
</p>

<p>&quot;this is KaTe Bush again. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think probably one of the most amazing things about the music scene today is 
the fact that music is purely one aspect of it. It is in fact a very large commercial 
business. This is why it is so hard for new unknown people to get into to - because 
it's a money-making business. A lot of companies are into creating formulas that 
will actually make the money for them and it's hard for people who have got 
something new to get through. But then again, there are the people in the companies 
who are aware of this and I think that that's where the magic lies because if you get 
through to them then you're all right. 
</p>

<p>&quot;For me, the most important thing is my music. That's what I'm here for. I think 
it's important that you realize that it is a business because you can't just play your 
music and shut yourself away because you have to communicate with your audience 
becasue they're the people that you're doing it for. You just have to compley with 
all the rules.&quot; 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think an interesting thing is happening in the music scene at the moment - I 
think from the beginning of this year, especially in England. It was purely because 
of Punk. It was a very quick dynamic thing that happened and I think its purpose 
was in order to bring new things out of it. We now have a sort of thing called new 
wave, which has come from punk, but it's not like punk at all. It's rich in 
interesting lyrics, completely different attitude towards music. There are very 
interesting lyrics that are based a lot more on reality than a lot of things have gone 
before. I think that's the trouble with a lot of music that was happening: things 
were becoming purely romantic bubblegum. Just talking about boy meets girl. The 
great thing about music is that it's a message. You actually have the power to convey 
a message to people to let them know about something they didn't know about 
before. I think that's an incredible responsiblity on behalf of the artist. I find myself 
very aware of that and I often wonder if I am doing any good, but I know it's my 
purpose. It's what I must do. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I do love singing other people's songs. I have done. But I feel that that is in fact 
cheating becasue there are so many good singers around who sing other people's 
songs and there aren't as many songwriters in comparison. For me, my only reason I 
sing is becasue I write the songs and I feel because I've written them and I know 
what they're about, I'm the one that can convey the message the best. But, I don't 
really consider myself a singer. I'm a singer/songwriter, but only because I write 
the songs. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe another interesting thing about this album is that two of the tracks, 'The 
man with the child in his eyes' and 'Saxophone Song' were recorded about three 
years ago. This was in fact my initial plunge into the business, as they say, with the 
help of Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd. I managed to get through to him through a 
contact of my brothers' and at that time he was looking around for unknown talent. 
He came along and heard me and we put some things down and he put up the 
money for me to make my first demo in a proper recording studio with 
arrangements. I owe to him the fact that I got my contract and that I'm where I am 
now. Two of these original tracks that we had on the demo are on the album, so 
maybe that helps with the variation. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The inspiration for 'The man with the child in his eyes' was really just a 
particular thing that happened when I went to the piano. The piano just started 
speaking to me. It was a theory that I had had for a while that I just observed in 
most of the men that I know: the fact that they just are little boys inside and how 
wonderful it is that they manage to retain this magic. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I, myself, am attracted to older men, I guess, but I think that's the same with 
every female. I think it's a very natural, basic instinct that you look continually for 
your father for the rest of your life, as do men continually look for their mother in 
the women that they meet. I don't think we're all aware of it, but I think it is 
basically true. You look for that security that the opposite sex in your parenthood 
gave you as a child. 
</p>

<p>[&quot;The man with the child in his eyes&quot; is played.] 
</p>

<p>[&quot;L'amour looks something like you&quot; is played and faded.] 
</p>

<p>&quot;This is KaTe Bush again with my new album, The Kick Inside on EMI. there are 
thirteen tracks on this album. When we were getting it together, one of the most 
important things that was on all our mind was, that because there were so many, we 
wanted to try and get as much variation as we could. To a certain extent, the actual 
songs allowed this because of the tempo changes, but there were certain songs that 
had to have a funky rhythm and there were others that had to be very subtle. I was 
very very greatly helped by my producer and arranger Andrew Powell, who really is 
quite incredible at tuning into my songs. We made sure that there was one of the 
tracks, just me and the piano, to, again, give the variation. We've got a Rock'n'Roll 
number in there, which again was important. And all the others there are just really 
the moods of the songs set with instruments, which for me is the most important 
thing, becasue you can so often get a beautiful song, but the arrangements can 
completely spoil it -they have to really work together. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think one of the really interesting things was compare live work with actually 
recording. It's such a completely different process, because when you're gigging, 
which I did for a little while with my band, the KT Bush Band, we were just doing 
pubs around London. We were singing other peoples' songs -rock'n'roll songs. It's 
really different because you feedback off the audience. You can see their faces. You 
can tell if they hate you or if they love you. All you're trying to do when you're on 
the stage is to excite them, get them to have a good time and enjoy it. With the 
album, it's a very different thing because that's a piece of plastic that people, 
hopefully, will listen to again and again. So you have to make it a very different kind 
of thing, it has to be purely for the ear, to allow people's imaginations to just move 
on their own. We just tried to do this by the arrangements and harmonies. There are 
so many of those things that you can't do live because you, obviously, can't overdub 
your own voice three times when you're singing live. You can't put harmonies in - 
you get other people to do it. 
</p>

<p>The thing actually about playing it live is that in fact we weren't doing any of my 
songs - we were just doing other people's Rock'n'Roll numbers, becasue in fact, in 
the pubs in London, unless you're well known that's the only way you get people to 
listen to you. They need to know the songs and they need to be able to drink their 
beer and dance. And with the album, I was trying to initiate my songs, which is a 
completely different thing, and I was amazed at how lucky I was getting people to 
listen to me. I've been very lucky. 
</p>

<p>&quot;This next song is called 'Strange Phenomena' and it's all about the coinsidences 
that happen to all of us all of the time. Like maybe you're listening to the radio and 
a certain thing will come up, you go outside and it will happen again. It's just how 
similar things seem to attract together. Like the saying 'Birds of a feather flock 
together' and how these things do happen to us all the time. Just strange 
coincidences that we're only occasionally aware of. And maybe you'll think how 
strange that is, but it happens all the time. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I hope you've enjoyed all the tracks we've been listening to. It's been 
great to be with you all - I hope that you're all well and happy. They're the tracks 
of my first album and I'm working on my second one at the moment in france. I 
hope you like that one too and maybe I'll come back again sometime and tell you all 
about that one.&quot; 
</p>

<p>[&quot;Strange Phenomena&quot; is played.] 
</p>

<p>[there follows a number a short bits that are separate from the main interview. 
Probably there were to be used as shorts between songs on the radio or as intros to 
her songs when they were played...] 
</p>

<p>&quot;This is KaTe Bush speaking. On the whole, I listen to very few lady singers. I 
identify myself much more with male singers, especially male songwriters. But the 
people I really admire: Billie Holiday, she's in a right of her own. David Bowie, I 
think he's an incredible songwriter. Bryan Ferry I think is an imnportant writer. 
the other people I do listen a lot ot are Steely Dan. And I think the main common 
denominator for the people that I like are that they are songwriters. They all seem 
to be either male groups or male single personalities who write their songs and sing 
them. And I think this is why I tend not to listen to females as much becasue the 
few that do get this together I don't find particularly interesting. Joni Mitchell 
stands on her own. I think Joan Armatrading too - she's special. But on the whole, I 
think I just identify more with male songwriters.&quot; 
</p>

<p>&quot;Hi everyone - this is KaTe Bush. The things that I hope for the future are that I 
continue to write songs and sing and that they progress. That they become more 
purposeful - that they have a purpose there all the time. One of the most important 
things to me is that I expand as a human being. So really any other sort of other 
levels that would take me onto a different plane, I'm welcome to if it's right. I'd 
love to get into the film media sometime, but I don't know if I as an actress can act. 
I don't think I could. I don't know. I'll just wait and see what comes and hope that 
I can expand and grow.&quot; 
</p>


<p>- my fingers hurt. 
</p>

<p>- recall that this was recorded sometime in 1978 or so. keep this in mind when 
reading what she said. it's most interesting to compare it to what she says now - or 
how she acts now (especially with reference to paying attention to her audience and 
reacting to them...).

<p>first, upon more careful and closer listening and comparison to the original 
tracks, i must retract my earlier statement that the songs that appeared on the 
promotional cassette for tki i recently transcribed are alternative mixes. they are not. 
rather, the recordings of the songs are not particularly good - the treble is much too 
high and the bass much too low. this gives them a certain quality that one does not 
hear on the official releases that fooled my ears. i also plead that i was not quite 
awake the first time i hear the tape - it was about 2 am in the morning. and you all 
know how first impressions are...
