<P>Kate's Birthday 
</P>
<P>With Andy Peebles, Radio 1 
</P>
<P>July 30, 1982 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to IED for providing me with the tape] 
</P>
<P>I: Many happy returns to you. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you! 
</P>
<P>I: I'm not going to be personal and ask how old you are 'cause that's very
cheeky,  have you had a good day? 
</P>
<P>K: It's been lovely, thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: Am I allowed to be inquisitive and ask what's the best present you've had
so far? 
</P>
<P>K: Gosh! Well I haven't had very many 'cause I haven't any of my friends... 
</P>
<P>I: Hmm.. 
</P>
<P>K: But, ah.... 
</P>
<P>I: Is this a complaint, Kate, or a statement? [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, not it's not a complaint at all, cause I've had some lovely ones
already, it's  just I've hardly had any yet. 
</P>
<P>I: What sort of things do you like for your birthday? I mean for people who
know  Kate Bush they may be sat their thinking &quot;I wonder what Kate would
like me to  get her for her birthday?&quot; I mean what sort of things do you
appreciate, silly  things? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I think the thing that's most important is that the person shows
that people  have actually thought about you, and I think that's the thing that
I find the most  moving thing. 
</P>
<P>I: I wouldn't know what to get you, you see. I've been sat here thinking &quot;what
 would I buy Kate if I knew her well enough to buy her a present?&quot; [Kate
laughs]  But it's very nice to have you on the program. Kate, tell me about your
new  single The Dreaming, which I must admit I find fascinating. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, you do! 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, I do. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, good. Well really it's a song about the Australian Aborigines who've
been  treated incredibly badly by the white man... 
</P>
<P>I: Hmm. 
</P>
<P>K: ...but It doesn't just apply to Aborigines, I think we've done our fair
share of  being cruel to people. And certainly to the red Indians in America,
all this sort of  thing. 
</P>
<P>I: So it's a bit of a social statement. 
</P>
<P>K: It is, but thank God the Aborigines are getting themselves together
again. There  all starting to grow, there are much more of them now then there
were even a  few years ago. 
</P>
<P>I: Found yourself a wonderful, isn't it, the Aborigines getting themselves
together. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Down under in the Antivities [??? spelling]. Kate, when can we see you
touring  again, cause lot's of people love watching your concerts, when are you
going to be  on the road again. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think that I can't really say at this point in time. I really do
want to do  another tour, badly. But, um... ah, well.... from the way the last
one was it just  cost so much money and so much effort and time to get it
together, that it needs  an incredible amount of preparation, really. I'm just
trying to see when is the  first time that I can realisticly fit it in. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, I'm sure when you've got it prepared and organized they're be ques
of  people hunting for tickets and enjoying your shows. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, I hope so... 
</P>
<P>I: It's been lovely taking to you, very many happy returns and have a super
birthday. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>I: And here comes that lovely record. See you soon, bye! 
</P>
<P>[Tape cuts] 
</P>
<P>K: ...see you! 
</P>
<P>I: There we are, Kate Bush, on the telephone line and this is The Dreaming. 
</P>
<P>[The Dreaming is played]

</P>
<P>Ron provides yet another great interview (I really liked this one)... 
</P>
<P>&gt; I: Found yourself a wonderful, isn't it, the Aborigines getting
themselves  together. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. I: Down under in the Antivities [??? spelling]. 
</P>
<P>This would be &quot;Antipodes,&quot; a British slang term referring to
Australia and New  Zealand.
