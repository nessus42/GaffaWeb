<P>The <EM>real</EM> Kate Bush isn't famous,<BR> says Kate the top pop
singer.</P>
<P>Like everyone, I believe in Iife, and love, but  most of all, in what I'm
doing. I find release in my  music, and I'm incredibly grateful that I'm able to
 do that. I've written songs almost since I can  remember --  I wrote &quot;The
Man With The  Child In His Eyes&quot; when l was 15 and music  was always more
important than other school work.</P>
<P>I went to a Roman Catholic convent, but it  didn't exactly have a profound
effect on my beliefs.  I think kids learn more from their parents than their 
teachers. Anyway, I don't really get anything from  religion. Almost everything
I've learned has come  from being with people. I'm just fantastically lucky 
that I've been with the right people --  too many  learn from the wrong sources.
Everyone should  make the most of their opportunities. I have, and  even a bad
experience can be good for you in the  long run.</P>
<P>Because my music has become well-known, I'm  afraid I've lost some friends.
But don't ask me how I  cope with being famous. As far as I'm concerned, the 
real Kate Bush isn't famous. Maybe her voice is and her  dancing -- but the real
me is still in there, and no one  will ever see that. There is a part of me that
I will always  keep to myself.</P>
