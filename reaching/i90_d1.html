<P>Here at last is the article that appeared in the February issue of
DISCoveries : 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World of Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>by William R. Creal 
</P>
<P>It was late on a cold, dark night in the winter of '81-'82. I was a tired, 
disenchanted lump, sinking deeper into the oblivion of the couch, mindlessly
flipping  channels on the television, when suddenly I was startled into
consciousness. A  barefoot young woman, with a black cowboy costume clinging
seductively to her  lithe body, was sensuously snaking across a stage. She was
armed with a rifle and  was using it to mow down three male attackers to the
accompaniment of swirling  musical rhythms, punctuated by imaginary gunfire. For
the next fifteen minutes and  through two more equally transcendent songs, I was
captivated by her performance.  Even more, I felt privileged -- madly fortunate.
It was as if I had stumbled upon  some forgotten wonder not of this world. I was
intoxicated, transported, bewitched;  in short, I was introduced to Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>I later learned I had viewed the final portion of the Live at Hammersmith
video.  That information, while enlightening, did me little good at the time.
The video  seemed unavailable in any store this side of the moon. Still, I made
my discovery.  Soon I was hearing that distinctive, exotic voice on the local
progressive radio station.  Then, the infant MTV began running two stunning
videos of this enchantress. I  couldn't get enough; unfortunately, I quickly
learned how literally true that  statement was. Kate Bush was a &quot;serious
artist.&quot; A label which was, and still is to  some extent, the equivalent of
a commercial death sentence as far as many record  industry magnates are
concerned. I could hear her and I could see her, but I  couldn't bring her home.

</P>
<P>When at last the fates graciously allowed a progressive record store to open
 nearby, I had three albums to catch up on, and two questions to answer: who was
 Kate Bush, and from where did she come? 
</P>
<P>Them Heavy People 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was born one midsummer's night on a forsaken English moor to the 
god, Apollo and the muse, Euterpe. Her childhood was spent roaming the 
surrounding hills with her cousin Pan, philosophizing with him and developing
her  inherited musical talents. She explored the mystical world within her,
absorbing,  then discarding reality, determined to create her own more perfect,
more sensual  world. She was part enchantress, part sorceress, casting her
spells with deep, radiant  eyes, goddess-like beauty, and a voice capable of
charming the most ferocious of  beasts. And when at last she ventured forth
amongst the mortals, none could resist  her. 
</P>
<P>There is, of course, an *official* version, which contends that Catherine
Bush was  born to Dr. Robert and Hannah Bush in the county of Kent, England, on
July 30,  1958. Though she had a normal childhood, she was not a normal child.
Her family  recognized this, it seems, from the moment of birth and they
respected and  encouraged her uniqueness, giving her ample freedom to discover
and develop her  abilities. 
</P>
<P>Cathy's early development was greatly influenced by her older brothers:
Paddy, a  telented and versatile musician with a fondness for unusual
instruments, and John  Carder Bush, an accomplished poet and photographer. Their
gentle guidance  introduced Cathy to a panorama of fabulous territory, all of it
awaiting her special  touch. To this day, her brothers remain among her
staunchest supporters, Paddy  contributing musically and John with album and
single sleeve photography. 
</P>
<P>To say Cathy Bush was precocious would be an understatement. By fourteen,
she  had composed numerous songs on the family piano, setting her poetry to
music. Two  years later, through the intervention of a friend, she met David
Gilmour, of Pink  Floyd. After early rejections by the music companies, Gilmour
helped her sift  through dozens of songs for a suitable demo tape which was
recorded at his home  studio. The tape was presented to EMI, Pink Floyd's label,
and the company was so  impressed with her abilities they advanced her enough
money to take time to refine  her creations and inevitably -- to grow into the
woman, Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>During this period, she left school, unable to find meaning in the 
creativity-stifling environment of organized education. With Paddy, she formed
the  KT Bush Band. The origainal lineup also included a bass player named Del
Palmer,  who would quickly occupy an irreplaceable spot in both her musical and
personal  life. She took dance and mime lessons, too, learning skills that when
eventually  coupled with her music, would yield a stunningly unique result. 
</P>
<P>In 1978, EMI saw its investment pay off in a big way. 
</P>
<P>Rolling the Ball 
</P>
<P>&quot;Out of the wily, windy moors.. .&quot; 
</P>
<P>With these words, preceded by a tinkling of fairy dust as the spell was
cast, Kate  Bush ensorcelled the unsuspecting music public. Her piercing,
ethereal voice wailed  like a greedy siren: &quot;Ooh, let me have it, let me
grab your soul away.&quot; And she did.  That first, trademark single, Wuthering
Heights, fought its way to number one in  the U.K. and in most of the Western
European countries, while the album itself,  THE KICK INSIDE (released in
February 1978), went triple platinum. All this in the  midst of a musical and
cultural revolution as bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash  attemped to
rearrange the world through their savagely chaotic songs. Kate's fragile  voice
and the delicately intimate subject matter of her lyrics crept through the 
carnage and created a niche all its own. 
</P>
<P>Although backed by a massive promotional campaign featuring posters of an 
innocently voluptuous Kate, the record was not an overnight smash. It took time
for  the music press to understand this extraordinary creature, but by the
release of the  second single, The Man with the Child in His Eyes (No. 6 on U.K.
charts), she  conquered both the critics and the public. (Something yet to
happen on a large scale  in the U.S.) 
</P>
<P>From the cry of whales that opens the album, through songs thick with the
heat  of impassioned lovers, to the soothing title tracks and its tale of incest
and suicide  which closes it, THE KICK INSIDE sustains a mystical sensuality,
never straying so  far into reality that the magic is diluted. In her liner
notes, Kate requests &quot;all of you  with open ears, please feel it.&quot; And
in the end, the entranced listener is compelled to  do just that. 
</P>
<P>They Took the Game Right Out of It 
</P>
<P>Her second album, LIONHEART, rushed together in less than two months, was a 
gasp for creative breath. EMI was not about to let the whirlwinds of publicity
stop  spinning -- they wanted another album at once. Thus, in November 1978,
less than  nine months after THE KICK INSIDE appeared, LIONHEART was born, 
prematurely. 
</P>
<P>There was not enough time to do this one right, at least not the way Kate
would  have liked it. While there are several excellent new songs, most are
simply reworked  versions of songs that didn't make the first album. As such,
there is both a  noticeable lack of unity, and an absence of purpose. It is more
a  stream-of-consciousness album, meandering from one idea and musical style to 
another, rather than the purposeful flow of lyrical and instrumental concepts 
normally expected from a Kate Bush concoction. 
</P>
<P>Given that, it is nevertheless interesting. The singles Hammer Horror (No.
44) and  Wow (No. 14) are worthy successors to her previous hits, and the
quasi-title track,  mourning a dying-going-on-dead British airman, has a
graceful, caressing melody  and Kate's usual *unusual* atmospheric vocals. 
</P>
<P>Other songs deal with a girl's maturing ability to cope with death and life
(  Symphony in Blue ) and with a young boy's loss of childhood innocence ( In
Search  of Peter Pan ). There are homosexual lovers in Kashka from Baghdad, and
a  food-poisoner serving &quot;hemlock on the rocks&quot; in Coffee Homeground.
As on THE  KICK INSIDE, the music is piano-based, as Kate continued to use that
instrument to  work out her songs. 
</P>
<P>Overall, LIONHEART is a pleasant album, but it clearly did not benefit from
the  exteriorly imposed deadline, and so is not definitive Kate Bush. Still, it
paid off for  EMI, going gold and peaking at No. 6 on the U.K. charts.
Meanwhile, Kate's rapid  ascent into stardom continued. In various polls of
January 1979, she was named the  No. 2 Female Sex Object. (The latter aided, no
doubt, by the gorgeous photos on  LIONHEART .) 
</P>
<P>The next step was the obligatory tour, but this time and for all time to
come, she  did not tolerate any outside interferences or demands. The result was
a landmark  tour that was all Kate Bush, and a lightning journey from mere
stardom to superstar  immortality. 
</P>
<P>Wow Wow Wow 
</P>
<P>The tour of spring 1979 was conceived, written, designed, directed, 
choreographed, produced, and oh, yes, performed by Kate Bush. For upwards of two
 and a half hours per, for twenty-eight shows in six weeks, across the U.K. and 
Europe, it was performed by Kate Bush. Drawing on everything she had learned for
 the past five years, it was the perfect and unprecedented combination of dance,
 theater, and music. It was not a revolutionary set of concerts in the truest
sense of  the word because no one else, apparently including Kate who has never
toured  again, could ever hope to duplicate it. It has, over time, simply become
a legendary  achievement. 
</P>
<P>It was her first opportunity to have total control over a project and she
took full  advantage of it. In each concert, there was a complete costume change
virtually  every other song, a total of about seventeen per show. During the
longer breaks, to  keep the mood alive there were poetry readings by brother
John. Each song was  treated to a set of props unique to itself: a parachute for
Oh England, My Lionheart ;  umbrellas for the dancers in Kite ; human violins
for Violin. On other songs, like  Wow, she showed that with only a headset, she
could generate as much excitement  in one square foot of stage as she could
supported by any number of props or  dancers. 
</P>
<P>The British music press was struck with awe. Reported Melody Maker: &quot;The
most  magnificent spectacle I've ever encountered in the world of rock.&quot;
Said the Bristol  Evening Post : &quot;A major artist by any standards. . .each
aspect was perfect in itself. .  .spectacular entertainment.&quot; And from the
Record Mirror : &quot;The best welding of  rock and theatrical presentation that
we're ever likely to see.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The amazing success of the tour showed what Kate could do when she had 
complete creative control, and going back into the studio for the next album,
she was  not about to relinquish it. 
</P>
<P>I'm Coming For You 
</P>
<P>NEVER FOR EVER, released in late 1980, is in many ways her REVOLVER. From 
the cover artwork depicting a myriad of Boschian creatures soaring out from
under  her billowing skirt (directly into her music, one presumes), to the
subject matter of  the songs, it is a major transitional point in Kate's career.

</P>
<P>Musically, it is influenced by the arrival of the Fairlight, a computer
sampling  device which, when she had mastered it, would give Kate the power to
better  compose her music and translate her emotions into sound. Lyrically, the
mystical,  other-worldly aura of the previous albums was evolving into a
philosophical  introspection as she began to assimilate the realities of the
world into her own life's  experiences. As a result, it is her first album that
is as stimulating to the intellect as  it is to the senses. 
</P>
<P>The initial single, Breathing (No. 16), stunned reviewers with its
passionate  rendering of nuclear Armageddon from the viewpoint of a fetus who
only wants to  &quot;keep breathing.&quot; It is as close as Kate ever gets to a
&quot;protest song.&quot; (Though over  the years she has supported many causes,
her spirit seems to be more that of a  Samaritan than a protester.) 
</P>
<P>Babooshka, the next single to be released, related the weaving of a tangled 
marital web by a wife testing her spouse's fidelity. It made No. 5, thus
becoming  her highest charting single since Wuthering Heights. 
</P>
<P>The final release, Army Dreamers (No. 16), crackles with detached irony as
it  describes the homecoming of a dead soldier, imagining what might have been. 
(Military men don't fair too well with Kate. Yet another one gets it in Pull Out
the  Pin on her next LP, THE DREAMING .) 
</P>
<P>NEVER FOR EVER was also Kate's first attempt at production (she co-produced 
with Jon Kelly) and she had to be encouraged when the album made No. 1 and went 
platinum. 
</P>
<P>The Pull of the Bush 
</P>
<P>Having been introduced to the Fairlight on the last album, by the release of
THE  DREAMING (September 1982) it had become Kate's primary method of working 
out songs. On the album itself, she employs it to great effect on nearly every
track.  Still, although it climbed to No. 3, the album also seemed to climb
right over the  collective heads of the British radio producers and EMI execs. 
</P>
<P>The first single, Sat in Your Lap, was actually released over a year before
the  album came out and did fairly well (No. 11). It also marked a turning point
in her  career as it reflects a struggle for knowledge amidst a barrage of sonic
chaos. It was  a stylistic departure for her, burying once and for all the
little wondering girl image  that had begun to fade on NEVER FOR EVER. 
</P>
<P>The Dreaming, the next single, was even more confusing. Why should Kate Bush
 sing about the Australian aborigines' fight to save their spiritual homeland?
And  why does it have to sound like it *really is* an aboriginal song? It was
not promoted  well and peaked at No. 48. It was Kate at her creative best, which
basically means it  was too confusting for the corporate heads at EMI. 
</P>
<P>The third single, There Goes a Tenner, an unpretentious little tune about a
bad  night in the lives of a band of Keystone robbers, did even worse. It became
her first  single ever to not make it on the charts. A fourth song, Suspended in
Gaffa, was a  smash in Canada and almost all of Europe; however, it was not
released as a single in  Britain. 
</P>
<P>In addition to the great influence of the Fairlight, this album is also
significant in  that it was her first as sole producer. Bit by bit, Kate had
taken over nearly every  aspect of her work. The final step was to build a home
studio where she could  experiment with her songs in complete solitude and
without the pressures of  knowing she was running up the bill in a rented
studio. Construction of the studio  began in mid-1983 and when it was completed,
the construction of her fifth album  commenced. 
</P>
<P>A Big Woof 
</P>
<P>HOUNDS OF LOVE, released in September 1985 and produced by Kate at her  new
in-home studio, is by far her most instrumentally diverse, intellectually, and 
emotionally satisfying album. It is, in fact, two distinct albums, each with its
own title,  cover photo, and side. The first side is essentially a collection of
masterful singles, as  four of the five songs were eventually released as such.
The first, Running Up That  Hill (No. 3), considered by some to be her greatest
all-around song, actually received  fairly consistent airplay on some radio
stations in the States. Following that success  were Cloudbusting (No. 20),
based on Peter Reich's A Book of Dreams ; the title  track (No. 18), featuring a
barking Kate; and The Big Sky (No. 37), with its  thundering drums, and Kate's
lightning shrieks. 
</P>
<P>Side two, with a photo of an apparently soaking wet Kate, is a conceptual
piece  titled THE NINTH WAVE. It starts in a dream ( And Dream of Sheep ), ends
in fog  ( The Morning Fog ), and between it tows the listener along some of her
most  memorable imagery and complex symbolism. It is basically a Hamlet-like &quot;to
be or  not to be&quot; dilemma, set at sea (a &quot;sea of troubles&quot;?), and
experienced by a  going-down-for-the-third-time Ophelia. The heroine does not
necessarily seek  suicide, simply relief, and during her struggles she is
visited by witch hunters (  Waking the Witch ), ghosts ( Watching You Without Me
), and future selves ( Jig of  Life ). It is a challenging set, both to the
listener and to Kate herself, who with THE  NINTH WAVE has forged a kind of Dark
Side of the Ocean. 
</P>
<P>The album hit number one, went double platinum, and is without question a 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>In 1986, an excellent compilation album, THE WHOLE STORY, was released. 
Besides collecting the obvious hits, it also contains one new single, Experiment
IV  (No. 23), and new vocals to Wuthering Heights. The latter is especially
interesting  since her voice, like herself, had nearly a decade to mature.
Significantly missing  from this version is that sprinkling of fairy dust that
began the original; its absence  serves to bring full circle Kate's personal and
professional growth. THE WHOLE  STORY, with its accompanying video, is a
terrific encapsulation of her remarkable  talents. The album, by the way, went
No. 1, and triple platinum. 
</P>
<P>Mmmmh, Yes 
</P>
<P>Molly Bloom steps out of the page tentatively. Her initial sensation, the
soothing  sound of bells -- at first soft and low as if coming from far beyond
the hills -- but  then, as she emerges completely with dormant senses fully
awakened, they are  strong and loud, heralding her arrival. And ours, in THE
SENSUAL WORLD. 
</P>
<P>The first and title track on Kate's new album, THE SENSUAL WORLD was 
released this past September and quickly nestled into the U.K. Top 10 [?]. (The 
12-inch version has a double-tracked A-side, with or without the vocals
depending  on where the needle hits.) It captures and transplants the
aforementioned Molly  Bloom and her erotic recollections from the final chapter
of James Joyce's complex  epic, Ulysses, into a three-dimensional *real* world
of the senses. 
</P>
<P>The song is awash in Irish music (Uillean pipes, bouzouki, fiddle), while
Kate's  seductive vocals become one with the instruments, now on top, now
immersed, as if  floating gently along on the undulating waves of sound.
Lyrically, it is as sinuously  absorbing as the original, unlike anything else
in Kate's catalog. 
</P>
<P>In the Kate Bush musical feast, if THE KICK INSIDE was the tasty appetizer,
and  HOUNDS OF LOVE a hardy main course, then THE SENSUAL WORLD is certainly 
the rich, creamy dessert. Its songs go down smoothly and leave you licking your
lips.  Overall, it is a distinctly feminine album, as Kate wraps her voice
lovingly around  every syllable, coaxing the purest sound out of each letter.
The effect of THE  SENSUAL WORLD is so alluring that when I finished listening
to the record for the  first time, I almost asked it out. 
</P>
<P>The second British single, (released in November, with the 7-inch issued as
a  picture disc, EMPD 119, and the 12-inch with a limited edition poster sleeve,
12EMP  119) was This Woman's Work, work being synonymous with labor and labor
being  the reason for the song's birth. Previously available only on the movie
soundtrack of  She's Having a Baby, it is an achingly beautiful tune about the
regrets of one's life  when faced with the death of a loved one: &quot;all the
things we should've said that  were never said.&quot; Being released so near
Christmas, you have the feeling that if he  had heard this song, Scrooge would
never have needed the three spirits to effect his  transformation. 
</P>
<P>Kate is assisted on three songs by the Trio Bulgarka, a group of Bulgarian
women  whose stirring voices wordlessly enhance the music, and on a song like
Deeper  Understanding, even elevate it to a higher emotional plateau. 
</P>
<P>Other highlights on the album include: Heads We're Dancing, in which our 
heroine is swept off her feet by a &quot;charming man&quot; who, unknown to her
at the time,  would soon thereafter sweep through Poland; Love and Anger, the
first U.S. single  released by CBS, Kate's new American label, and featuring old
pal Dave Gilmour;  and Rocket's Tail, with both the Trio Bulgarka and vintage
Floydian guitar work  from Gilmour. The latter song is about whatever you would
like to think it's about,  but just remember, it's dedicated to her cat. 
</P>
<P>Upon its release in England, THE SENSUAL WORLD entered the charts at No. 2. 
It remains to be seen, however, what the record will do in the U.S. CBS seems to
 having some trouble handling it. Supposedly, they felt there were no songs that
were  appropriate single material for U.S. radio. Well that's the point, isn't
it? Kate's  songs, thankfully, are not easy to segue into or out of, especially
on American Top 40  radio. CBS' dilemma is the ultimate confirmation of Kate's
uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>As could have been expected, the album was written and produced solely by 
Kate, and recorded by Del Palmer. Brother Paddy and Dr. Bush make appearances, 
and the cover photo (Molly in full &quot;bloom,&quot; perhaps?) was taken by
brother John.  Despite any problems there might be in the U.S., the album
nevertheless seems  destined to swell the ranks of the Kate Bush Club (P.O. Box
120, Welling, Kent, U.K.  DA16 3DS). 
</P>
<P>As far as CBS, well, how about a little deeper understanding, guys? After
all, it  could have been worse: instead of Ulysses, it might have been Finnegans
Wake. 
</P>
<P>Bushabilia: The Collectible Kate 
</P>
<P>In the spring of 1988, a poll conducted by the British magazine, Record
Collector,  showed Kate Bush to be the most collectible female artist, and the
thirteenth most  collectible artist overall. Collecting Kate is not only a
popular pastime, but an old one  as well. The first true piece of Bushabilia was
a beautiful limited-edition picture disc  of THE KICK INSIDE, issued in the U.K.
in late 1979. (It was later reissued in North  America.) Of course, virtually
any of her early records are now collectors items. 
</P>
<P>Among her singles, the real rarities are the non-U.K./U.S. editions. Many,
like  the Canadian issue of The Man with the Child in His Eyes, have different
picture  sleeves than their American or English counterparts. Other songs were
included as  singles exclusively in selected countries. For instance, there is
French release of Ne  T'en Fui Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant (EMI 5444) and the
Canadian version (72917)  which has Dreamtime as the B-side. Un Baiser D'Enfant
(79231) was also released in  Canada with Suspended in Gaffa as the B-side.
Perhaps the rarest of these is Night  of the Swallow (from THE DREAMING )
recorded in Dublin and featuring several  popular Irish musicians, and
accordingly was released only in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>Two other 7-inch rarities come from the HOUNDS OF LOVE LP. The first is an 
interview picture disc released only in Italy (KBP1). The front has the same
picture  of Kate as the Hounds of Love single, but the reverse is a lovely shot
of her in a  sweeping, low-cut ethnic gown. The second 7-inch rarity is the U.K.
release of The  Big Sky (KBP4) single on picture disc, though not as difficult
to find as the Italian  interview. You will recognize it by the nice photos of
that wonderful face on front  and back. 
</P>
<P>One of the most attractive of all Kate Bush collectibles is The Single File
(KBS1), a  boxed set. Originally released in 1983 in the U.K. and the U.S.
(where it was a  numbered, limited edition), this handsome set contains all of
Kate's singles (with  reproductions of the original picture sleeves) from
Wuthering Heights through  There Goes a Tenner. As a bonus, it throws in the
aforementioned French single Ne  T'en Fui Pas and the Kate Bush Live on Stage
EP. And if that's not enough, there's  even a nice lyric/photo booklet. 
</P>
<P>Not to be outdone, there are similarly interesting items among Kate's
12-inch  collectibles. For starters, beginning with Running Up That Hill
(12KB1), all (five) of  Kate's singles have also been released in 12-inch
format. Each contains remixed  versions of the single as well as at least one
other non-album cut. Some of the  reworked versions, Alternate Hounds of Love
for instance, are as exciting as the  original. And never overlook the B-sides
of any Kate Bush single; some, like Under  the Ivy (flip side of Running Up That
Hill ), are among her most intimate and  moving songs. 
</P>
<P>As far as LPs are concerned, the earliest collectibles are the three
different covers  of THE KICK INSIDE. The U.K. and most of Europe issued the
oriental-styled &quot;kite&quot;  cover, with Kate gliding across a giant eye,
while the Harvest label in the U.S. and  Canada chose a stunning close-up for
their releases. Subsequently, EMI America  rereleased the U.S. album, this time
with the familiar &quot;Kate in a crate&quot; cover photo. 
</P>
<P>In more recent times, HOUNDS OF LOVE was also released in multiple versions,
 although it is the actual vinyl which differs rather than the cover. Besides
the usual  drab black vinyl, you can put the Canadian pink disc on your
turntable and watch it  swirl around or if you like, try the rather
hefty-looking gray marbleized U.S. edition. 
</P>
<P>If you still need more, there is the extremely rare Interview with Kate Bush
 (EMI SPRO 282), a Canadian-only promo, again from the HOUNDS OF LOVE era.  You
might also hunt for the ultra-limited-edition HOUNDS OF LOVE promotional  kit.
This wondrous little package contains the album, a biography/discography on 
lavender paper, and three publicity photos, all deliciously wrapped in a
gatefold  sleeve tied together with, yes, a lavender ribbon. Talk about
sensuous. 
</P>
<P>Finally, there's my personal favorite among 12-inch records: THE WHOLE 
STORY, Korean-style. This release has only nine tracks instead of the usual
twelve  found on other versions. The three tunes omitted are Army Dreamers,
Breathing  and Experiment IV -- all songs that cast the military in an
unfavorable light. 
</P>
<P>Come Across the Bridge 
</P>
<P>The French writer Albert Camus once said of the great Franz Kafka &quot;[his]
whole  art consists in forcing the reader to reread.&quot; While Kate is no
Kafka, the statement  nevertheless applies to her music. Repeated &quot;readings&quot;
are absolutely essential to  fully appreciate the musical intricacies and
lyrical depth of her songs. As is evident,  she spends much time painstakingly
crafting each song, infusing it with her rare and  precise passion. To
paraphrase Francis Bacon, Kate's albums are among the few  which should be &quot;chewed
and digested.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The purpose of this feature is to stimulate an interest in Kate Bush. Not
just in  her collectibility, but in her music as well. I have found by personal
experience that  knowing Kate eventually translates into collecting Kate. Alas,
her creative output is  far too intriguing and far too wide in scope to be
covered adequately in one story.  Her ground-breaking videos, which I scarcely
mentioned, are the culmination of all  her abilities and would demand a thorough
examination of their own. The same goes  for her backup work on other artist's
records, her songs on movie soundtracks, and  especially the marvelous non-album
tracks found on the B-side of her later singles.  In addition, as you might
expect there is a vast amount of unauthorized Kate Bush  material, ranging from
interview picture discs to live albums of seemingly every  concert stop on the
tour. I leave all of the above for the adventuresome reader to  pursue and
discover. 
</P>
<P>I would like to thank Mike Murchison, Kate Bush collector extraordinaire,
for  allowing me to ramble through his brain and his collection. Also, this
could not have  been written without reference materials, so for further
reading, I suggest Kate  Bush Complete (International Music Publications, 1987);
Kate Bush: A Visual  Documentary, by Cann and Mayes (Omnibus Press, 1988); and
any issue of  Homeground, the official Kate Bush fanzine. Special thanks to EMI.

</P>
<P>Finally, I am grateful to whomever fixed it so that out of all the eons that
have  gone and all that are yet to come, I could share a few decades with Kate
Bush.

<P> A KATE BUSH EPILOG 
</P>
<P>Thank you for the elegant treatment of my Kate Bush feature. I am certain it
 could not have been presented any better. The appearance of the layout
definitely  enhanced the subject matter of the article. 
</P>
<P>A couple of things apparently slipped through our mutual final proofing and
I  have attempted to now set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>I have recently come accross two very nice collectibles from The Sensual
World,  Kate's current album. The first is cassette versions of the album, as
well as a booklet  containing the lyrics, a biography, and some terrific photos.
The second is a  Canadian picture CD (C2 93078) of the album, although the
picture is actually a  close-up from the picture sleeve of The Sensual World
single. 
</P>
<P>As sometimes can happen, a couple of errors slipped into the works. In the 
Lionheart section, a sentence in the next to last paragraph should have read: &quot;In
 various polls of January 1979, she was named the No. 1 New Artist, the No. 2
Female  Artist, and the No. 2 Female Sex Object.&quot; Only the latter made it
to print. My  intentions were to most definitely not to portray her great
accomplishments of 1978  as solely the result of her physical appearance. As I
hope I made clear, Kate is much  more than just a pretty face. 
</P>
<P>In the collectibles section, I referred to an Italian interview picture
disc. At the  time I wrote the article I thought it to be an authentic release,
as it carries an EMI  logo and catalog number. I have since learned that it may
be in fact an unauthorized  release. I am honestly not sure which it is. If it
is an unauthorized disc, I apologize  for any confusion. 
</P>
<P>In addition, when discussing the Korean release of The Whole Story I
mentioned  the exclusion of three tracks which appear on the U.K. and U.S.
versions. One of  these, Breathing, was indeed on the album; it was actually The
Dreaming which was  omitted. The Korean Ministry of Culture and Information
(which &quot;approved&quot; the  album) apparently felt the anti-government
sentiments expressed in the song, even  though directed towards Australia, were
dangerous. Why then did Breathing,  essentially and anti-war song, make it? A
glance at the wonderous little Korean lyric  insert accompanying the album may
reveal why. Kate wrote and sang: &quot;We've lost  our chance, we're the first
and last, after the blast/Chips of Plutonium are  twinkling in every lung.&quot;
The lyric sheet reads as follows: &quot;We've lost our charms,  we're the first
and last, oh, oh, off to get lost/Shipshape and toney, oh that twinkling  in
every lung.&quot; (You think something might have been lost in the translation?)

</P>
<P>Speaking of The Dreaming, the authentic-sounding Australian music was 
achieved in part by having an authentic Australian, Rolf Harris, play his
digeridu on  the track. I mention this because of the recent printing of the
lyrics to Tie Me  Kangaroo Down, Sport in the January issue. The lyrics are
basically accurate,  although I don't believe anyone would win a spelling bee if
&quot;digeridu&quot; was on the  list. Kate's liner notes spell it as above, the
letter-writer, Eric Schenider, however,  prefers &quot;diggerie doo,&quot; while
the sheet music of the songs likes &quot;didgeridoo.&quot; Also,  it's abos [as
already pointed out in the Mailbox], not elbows in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>One final word: I wish to again express my appreciation to DISCoveries for
the  excellent treatment my story on Kate received. Thank you to all concerned.
