<P><STRONG>Face &amp; Figure</STRONG></P>
<P>Kate Bush is 21, and although her lyrics are very much that  of a woman, her
body is that of a child, while her face combines an appealing innocence with a
theatrical sensuality.</P>
<P>That's both on stage and off, and one of the people who should  know is
make-up artist Kirsty Climo, who has worked with Kate  on both her audio visuals
and television appearearnces.</P>
<P>&quot;Kate is gamine, with a sexy elfin quality and is striking  even
without makeup&quot;, she says. An opinion also held  by EMI head Bob Mercer who
says: &quot;She has this tremendous  gamine quality of innocence to sexuality
without seeming  consciousness&quot;. This was strikingly evident on her  recent
sell-out 'Rock Theatre' tour.</P>
<P>Kate Bush first made her impact on the record world with her  hit &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;. In a white Victorian  nightdress, bought down the Kings Road
Road, she cartwheeled  Emily Bronte's heroine out of the moors and into
television  programmes worldwide with her audio film. That and her  peculiar
voice, likened to an instrument but not specified as  to which one, she either
made you love or hate her. </P>
<P>Whether in a gold lame Mary Quant catsuit, sitting on a  perspex light box
so as to appear in limbo for her 'Man  With The Child In His Eyes' or in a lilac
ruched dress to  portray the Hollywood starlet in her song &quot;Wow&quot;, 
Kate acts out every detail of her songs She works on  everything. Her lyrics
about relationships, spiritual and otherwise, are those of a woman though she
looks like  a child, and at 5ft. 3ins, is certainly built like one.</P>
<P>While Kirsty was concentrating on her face there were  others who were
shaping her body. At 16, Dave Gilmour  of the Pink Floyd heard a demo of her
songs. He was impressed enough lo put up the money to have them  produced
professionally. She was signed on the spot by  EMI, and with uncharacteristic
paternalistic concern they  suggested she go away, form her own company and
spend  the next few years writing at their expense. </P>
<P>She used the time taking modern dance classes at the  Dance Centre and then
rook mime classes with Lindsay  Kemp, who helped David Bowie with his Ziggy
Stardust  character, and went on to form her own  show with the  help of
choreographer and principal dancer of the  London Contemporary Dance Theatre,
Anthony Van  Laast.</P>
<P>When Kate first left school she knew she wanted  to  dance. She had tried
Karate and not found it satisfying  but after seeing an advertisment for Lindsey
Kemp's  'Flowers' she was drawn to his classes. Lindsey believed  that people
could be liberated through mime and music  but his classes were for living
fabulously through all  senses -- to release the individual personality. After
six  months with Lindsey she then took modern dance classes  every morning for a
couple of hours with Anthony Van Laast.</P>
<P>After her dance classes she rehearsed with the band into  the evening. In
all, a working day of twelve hours and  this went on for months. At first she
found the dance  classes so exhausting that she would end on her knees. Anthony
had to give her the stamina which he did by  pushing her like a horsetrainer.</P>
<P>Kate is a vegetarian who eats very little. During the  gruelling months of
rehearsals her sister-in-law did  the catering, providing quiches, waldorf
salads, nut  roast and an amazing variery of cheesecakes. Kate's  mother would
come along to the rehearsals with a bag  full of Mars bars, biscuits and fruit
besides advice on how  look after herself -- but, says Kirsty Climo, Kate is
sensible  and it shows.</P>
<P>Kate drinks very little coffee or alcohol. So Kirsty doesn't  have to waste
three quarters of an hour comouflaging any  after-effects on the skin. Kate is
very health conscious  and it show in her pale even skin tone. Her skin with its
 fine pores and her clear almond-shaped eyes are  testimonies to the healthy
life. Her eyes and mouth  which are very wide are appealing. She has pixie  ears
which when not covered by her hair are tipped by  Kirsty with blusher. However,
Kate likes her hair wild  and bushy and does not want to be pruned. She hennas 
her hair herself and her make-up during the day is simple -- just black eye line
and mascara.</P>
<P>But for record albums, television and audio visuals,  Kirsty is called in.
She works around Kate's eyebrows  and eyes by extending and smudging lines into
the  hairline. Kirsty is partial to <EM>Dior</EM> and uses creams and  then
powders over the top, especially around the eyes so  as to get a sooty effect.
She uses matt bright darkish  colour lipsticks for Kate, as anything light
doesn't  balances her eyes.</P>
<P>Kate herself can either take or leave make-up but is  very quick to pick up
new techniques. For her show  she used the </P>
<P>Madeleine Mono</P>
<P>glitter glitter sheen  make-up which was used on her by a make-up artist 
friend. He used a very classy style. He put silver lines  on her eyes and a
jewel by the mouth. He highlighted  her naturally high cheekbones with pink
glimmer, dark  brown underneath, and silver above. Typically she only  needed to
be shown once and she knew how to do her  face for herself throughout her tour.</P>
<P>Kate accepts the way she looks and is quite at peace  with herself. She is
very aware of the way she moves.  Her vegetarianism, yoga and dance exercise
show by  the good blood circulation reflected in her skin. She  doesn't eat much
at all and as she doesn't dance every  day and is aware of the relationship
between the intake  and output of food and energy. She's sensible about her 
diet and it shows in her slim hips and lean thighs</P>
<P>Kirsty is amazed how models and people only take off  the make-up they can
see. She believes certain soaps  are for certain skins but we undermine
everything by  not rinsing them off with at least twenty splashes of  water.
Very hot water is good for washing oily skin  as it helps dissolve the oil. Kate
herself has fairly  normal skin.</P>
<P>Kirsty, who has worked with Elkie Brooks and Linda  McCartney realises that
luminaries do not want to be  changed out of all recognition, only enhanced. She
 sees Kate's face as warm and intelligent and thinks  we are responsible for our
faces through what we  think. Kate's yoga helps her to relax not only her  body
but the muscles in her face. </P>
<P>It is not only in the two and a half hour show with its  17 costume changes
where Kate wears Leotards.  At home she wears bodyclothes, leg warmers and  is
usually barefooted. If you saw her in the street you  would think she was a
casual and informal art student.  Photographer Gered Mankowitz who takes her
publicity  photos says, &quot;When she likes a certain jumper and  boots she
will wear them all the time&quot;. But in her  music and looks she is changing
constantly.</P>
