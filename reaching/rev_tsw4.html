<P> Romping home a close second to the Blue Nile in the increasingly
competitive  Studio Marathon stakes, Kate Bush's sixth album has finally arrived
almost exactly  four years after her last, The Hounds Of Love. &quot;Each record
gets harder to make&quot;  may not sound like much of an excuse for being so
late either, but to judge from the  fineness of detail and diversity of
influences Bush has compressed into the 40-odd  minutes here, it's a perfectly
plausible one: The Sensual World is as highly wrought  and deeply thought as any
album since the last by Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>Like Gabriel, Bush has been busy thinking up ways to incorporate more exotic
 and atmospheric elements into her already broad and quirky rock coalition.
Unlike  him, though, she has leaned less heavily on the obvious source, Africa.
The Uillean  pipes (courtesy of Davey Spillane) which barge brilliantly into the
chorus of the  album's opening, eponymous track are the first of a number of
surprise guests, of  whom the all-woman Bulgarian folk a cappella troupe, Trio
Bulgarka, are the ones  who stay the longest and leave the strongest impression.
Their shrill, ghostly whoops  and harmonies decorate three of the tracks on side
two: a pattery, Gabriel-esque  meditation on the ambiguous blessings of
technology, in this case computers, called  Deeper Understanding; a heavily
modified bluesy rocker, Rocket's Tail; and best of  the lot, Never Be Mine, a
tremulously Bushy ballad with a beautifully wiggly  interlace of keyboard
motifs. 
</P>
<P>While Bush's famous fey voice would probably be enough to hold the disparate
 strands of The Sensual World together, the album takes its cue and colouring
too  from the hypnotically sinuous sway of the pipes on the title track. There
are some  strapping power chords to be despatched here and there, most notably
on Love And  Anger, but the dominant mood is of Oriental reverie, similar in
feel to that achieved  latterly by Japan. And in fact the last track on side
one, Heads We're Dancing,  reproduces that mysteriously *sproingy* bass sound
favoured by Mick Karn. 
</P>
<P>An analysis of its parts however doesn't really do justice to the boldness
of the  album. Bush has taken on a lot of styles but The Sensual World doesn't,
thankfully,  end up sounding simply clever or stylised. Which is not to say that
all the bridges she  tries to build here stand up, but to acknowledge that the
imaginative effort and  patience that went into their design should guarantee
Kate Bush's position in that  peculiar class of her own for some while yet. ****

Rolling Stone<br>
By Sheila Rogers<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400">February 8, 1990</span></P>

<i>After releasing her first album in four years, Kate Bush is blooming<br>
</i><br>
&quot;It's really nice for me to feel that I'm being seen almost as a new artist by 
Americans,&quot; says British singer Kate Bush, who in fact has six studio albums to 
her credit and for over a decade has had an enormous following in Britain, 
Europe and other parts of the world. &quot;In England I had to do so much fighting 
for years. I like the idea that people haven't really heard of me here. Of being 
able to start from a musical base. That's what I've always wanted.&quot; That musical 
base is her most recent album (her first album of new material in four years), <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>The Sensual World</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a potent, heady collection 
that expresses a particularly feminine side of the sensual world.<br>
<br>
Bush, looking a bit tired - belying the unabashed passion of her songs - 
reclines in her chair in front of a fire in her hotel room in New York, noting 
that the fake log burning in front of her is a poor excuse for a real fire. She 
then explains her &quot;battle&quot; - her attempts to maintain control despite all the 
fuss that's been made over her since her debut album went to number one in the 
U.K. twelve years ago.<br>
<br>
While Bush was still in school in Kent, near London, a family friend played smoe 
of her songs for Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour. &quot;I was about sixteen,&quot; Bush says, 
&quot;and I had been writing songs for a while, and my family thought that maybe I 
might be able to make some kind of waves as a songwriter.&quot; She describes her 
family, with whom she's remarkably close, as &quot;a very musical family - there was 
always music around.&quot; Her father, a surgeon, played piano, while her two older 
brothers, Paddy and John, explored traditional Irish and English music. And her 
mother, she says, &quot;used to be a very good Irish dancer.&quot;<br>
<br>
After Gilmour heard Bush's songs, he paid to have three of them professionally 
recorded, and it was through those tracks that she got a recording contract with 
EMI. (Gilmour also appears on Bush's new album. &quot;He gave me a pathway through,&quot; 
Bush says, &quot;and we've always stayed in touch, but this is the first time that 
we've worked together in years.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Her EMI contract enabled Bush to write more songs and pursue studies in dance 
and theatrical mime. In 1977, at nineteen, she released <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>The Kick Inside</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, whose first single, the fiery 
&quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; based on one of the climatic passages in the Emily Bronte 
novel, went to number one in the U.K. That instant success, says Bush, was 
&quot;totally overwhelming. My life completely changed. I had no time for myself or 
my work, and it was very difficult to be private. It became one big promotional 
public exercise.&quot;<br>
<br>
The singer's comely features were splashed across the pages of the British 
press, with such captions as &quot;Cute Kate heads for the heights.&quot; But Bush didn't 
really appreciate the pinup image or the hype. &quot;I had no control over the 
situation,&quot; she says. &quot;It wasn't what I wanted. It was exactly not what I 
wanted.&quot; By acquiring her own studio and maintaining her privacy, Bush did 
manage to remedy the situation. But that was only after her follow-up album, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>Lionheart</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, was hastily released under pressure 
from her record company. (Bush says it's one of her least satisfying albums.)<br>
<br>
In 1979, Bush went on tour in Britain and Europe. &quot;I really enjoyed it,&quot; she 
says. &quot;It was tremendous, a fabulous experience, but it was incredibly, 
incredibly exhausting and a total commitment. I don't think people understand 
the level of involvement that I get into when I do a project.&quot; Anyone who's seen 
the video of her 1979 concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon will appreciate what 
she's talking about. It's an elaborate production replete with mime, magic and 
theatrics.<br>
<br>
She hasn't toured since. &quot;I got straight from an album into making videos, and 
it's a total involvement for me,&quot; she says. &quot;By the time the video and promotion 
are done for an album. I'm absolutely exhausted; there's nothing left of me. It 
would be impossible for me to tour the way I work. What matters to me now is 
spending as much time in the studio as I can, trying to make a good album.&quot;<br>
<br>
The songs on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Sensual World</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 
reveal the care and effort Bush puts into her music. &quot;I suppose I'm obsessive 
about my work,&quot; she says. &quot;There are so many areas on an album. It's only ten 
songs, but it's an incredibly huge challenge to come up with something 
completely new from the last album, and it encompasses so many areas. It's like 
researching for a book, or for five books.&quot;<br>
<br>
As with Bush's first single, a book inspired the title track on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>The Sensual World</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The song is loosely based on 
the closing passage of Jame Joyce's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ulysses</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. 
The track opens with Bush provocatively whispering, &quot;Mmh, yes/Then I'd taken the 
kiss of seedcake back from his mouth/Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I came up with the idea of the word <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>yes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,&quot; 
says Bush, &quot;and I suddenly thought, 'God, wouldn't it be interesting to play 
around with Molly Bloom's soliloquy?' and I went and got the book, and the words 
just worked to the music. It was extraordinary. I've never had anything like 
that happen before, and it was very exciting.&quot; But when she tried to get 
permission to use the text, she was refused. &quot;I tried several times, and they 
were just absolutely adamant.&quot; Instead of shelving the song, Bush came up with a 
new approach. &quot;To reapproach it was quite painful, especially having to let go 
of what I thought was obviously a classic piece of literature that I felt worked 
with contemporary music. Gradually it started to unfold into this idea of Molly 
Bloom stepping away from her author, into the sensual world.&quot;<br>
<br>
That world seems to envelop nearly all of Bush's characters on the album. &quot;Most 
of my songs are about relationships and telling stories,&quot; she says, &quot;and 
relationships cover so many different intensities of emotions. To me, that's 
what songwriting is about: human relationships and telling stories.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bush herself has been in a long-term relationship with bassist Del Palmer, who 
was the album's engineer. (Kevin Killen, whose last credit was Elvis Costello's 
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Spike</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, mixed the 
album.) The songs on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Sensual World</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 
intertwine synthesizers with folk instruments, such as uilleann pipes, bouzouki, 
Celtic harp, mandolin and tupan (some of which are played by Paddy Bush). &quot;Paddy 
always had a tremendous interest in ethnic music and instruments,&quot; Kate says. 
&quot;He's really been very inspirational, exposing me to different cultures.&quot; Three 
tracks were recorded with Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka. &quot;They are my three sisters,&quot; 
she says, brightening. &quot;They're very affectionate people, and they spent most of 
the time coddling me. It was a very special experience musically as well as on a 
human level.&quot;<br>
<br>
Despite her emotional approach to her music, in her own life Bush wants to be in 
complete control. &quot;Within my work, I am very much so,&quot; she says. &quot;You absolutely 
have to be, because otherwise people will sh*t you left, right and center. You 
have to hang on to your original intentions, and I think that's one of the 
hardest things for people to do. It's not easy to keep space in life anyway. And 
it's certainly not easy when you're supposed to be a public person. I try very 
hard to keep privacy in my life. And it helps me termendously. I'd want to go 
completely mad. I don't see what my private life has got to do with my music. 
Although obviously there's a lot of me in my music. It's my music I feel I want 
to give to the world, and not myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bush's lack of participation in her label's promotional efforts may have had a 
hand in her lack of support in the States. &quot;It's impossible to say,&quot; she says. 
&quot;I think the fact that the second and third album weren't released her didn't 
fully keep up any kind of profile here.&quot; (Nonetheless, 1985's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->
<em>Hounds of Love</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> did produce a Top Thirty hit for 
Bush in the United States, &quot;Running Up That Hill.&quot;)<br>
<br>
And Bush, while willing to promote her new album, is unwilling to promote 
herself. &quot;There's not that much known about me, and what is known is so 
diverse,&quot; she says. &quot;There have been at least five books out. It's a continual 
problem for me dealing with people's preconceptions of me. It's very difficult 
to get people to take me as I am. That's why I want my work to speak for me 
Because that's what comes from my heart.&quot; <br>
