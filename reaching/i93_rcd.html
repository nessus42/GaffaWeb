<H2>The Bush Campaign </H2>
<P>The story of Kate Bush is unique, both for the sensitivity with which record
 company EMI has managed her career, and for the personal privacy she has 
managed to retain. As Bush prepares to release a new album and accompanying 
film, she describes how creative control is her prime concern, while musical 
collaborator and ex-boyfriend Del Palmer offers an insider's view of the Bush 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>Story: Tony Horkins 
</P>
<P>If there's one thing Kate Bush's career proves, it's that there's something 
dreadfully awry about record company policy in the '90s. Imagine a major record 
company doing this today: they find a talented 16 year-old, a bit quirky, not
like  much else that's happening. They sign him/her, but let that talent evolve
over a four  year period before releasing a single note. Over that time, they
help train that  protege - dancing lessons, singng lessons, studio time - to
make sure that they're  absolutely ready to impress. Then they let their artist
pick their first single and  watch it shoot to number one. Let's face it; in
1993, it's pure fantasy. But in 1974 it  was a reality for Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>It's been well documented how Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour got to hear her 
demos and passed them on to the top brass at EMI, who promptly signed her up.
But  according to Del Palmer, Kate's long-term musical collaborator and former 
boyfriend, even in the '70s it was pretty exceptional behaviour. 'Someone had
some  real foresight there,' he recalls. 'Even back then, it wasn't exactly
common  behaviour for a record company to behave that way. But they could see
she had  something very special...' Del could too after he was introduced to the
teenage  Bush by her brother Paddy - 'we were dating from the moment we met,&quot;
he says. 
</P>
<P>He'd known Paddy for some time, and was busy getting yet another pub band 
together when a friend suggested they ask Paddy's sister to sing. 'She just said
 yeah, great, I'd love to do it,' he remembers. 'At that stage she was up for
doing  anything at all. She'd already been signed to EMI tbe year before, and
this was  about nine or ten months before she went into the studio to record her
first album.  So she fancied doing a little bit of live work for the crack. We
got a small four-piece  together with her on vocals. and started playing around
the clubs in our local area, in  south-east London, and we were doing all covers
- things like Heard It through The  Grapevine, Knock On Wood, Soul Man- and she
was great, singing all this stuff'. 
</P>
<P>This is where the fledgling Bush started developing her inimitable style,
both audibly  and visually. 'At that time she'd already started singing in this
very high-pitched  voice, but she could really belt it out. I thought this girl
was so slim - there was  nothing of her - but you put her on stage and she was
into the whole thing. We  started doing some of her songs - we did the embryonic
version of James And The  Cold Gun, and she was doing all this stuff with the
gun, out in the audience - they  just loved it. She was a total performcr right
from the word go. Had no problem  with the confidence aspect at all, yet she'd
never fronted a band before. She was an  absolute natural.' 
</P>
<P>Del's enthusiasm for his musical partner's work is infectious. In contrast,
Bush  herself is reserved when it comes to anything except her music. Ask her
about the  technicalities of recording using her Fairlight computer system and
she'll tell you  exactly about how her songs come about. When it comes to
explaining the stories  behind the songs, however, or talking about Kate Bush,
the person, she is uniquely  retiring. But when it comes to her music, Bush has
spent many years developing a  skill for getting what she wants - a skill that
she's developed into a fine art. She  speaks gently and slowly, picking her
words carefully, looking almost frail and  innocent as her expressive wide eyes
stare in wonderment. But her delicate looks  and tiny frame belie her drive and
power - not many artists of any stature get to be  so creatively in control as
Kate Bush. For her, though, it is and always has been the  number one priority.
'I think creative control is so incredibly important,' she says.  'If you don't
have that control your work will be interfered with until it's gone out  of your
hands. I was always aware that things wouldn't be how I wanted them  unless I
was willing to fight. 
</P>
<P>Kate's involvement in what was known as the KT Bush Band was always going to
 be shortlived, as Del and his other musical collaborators realised, but they
were  happy to support her until that moment EMI were ready to whisk her off to
fame  and fortune. 'Right at the end of that period of playing the pub gigs in
that band, we  did a session for EMI at the White Elephant on the River,' he
recalls, 'which was  her first major showcase for the whole record company. It
was quite nerve-racking  for the rest of us, but Kate just breezed on and sang
it. She breezed through the  whole thing - it was really quite amazing. 
</P>
<P>'She always had this total self-belief in what she was going to do - there
was  never going to be any problem for her, from her own point of view. It was
like an  obsessive passion that she just had to go through. And in a lot of ways
she's still like  it now.' Of course, after that it was never quite the same for
the KT Bush band  without Katy Bush, and Del and Co were left stranded in
temporary musical limbo  while Kate was studio-bound. At that stage, Kate was
too young and inexperienced  to insist they play on her debut - 'she had to toe
the party line a little,' says Del - so  the producer bought his own players in
to provide the necessary backing. However,  even then Bush knew what she wanted
and how to get it across. He may not have  played on her debut LP, but Kate made
sure Del got to design the artwork for the  back of the sleeve, and that LP
number two would have his name somewhere on the  playing credits. 'She really
wanted us to play on that album, but politically it wasn't  right/he says. 'But
when the second album came along in '78, we were able to do a  few tracks - she
really stuck out for us. I'm really grateful for that she's given me, 
personally, so many breaks.' 
</P>
<P>Bush is reluctant to go into details on her relationship with her uniquely 
understanding record comapany. Although obviously appreciative of the artistic 
freedom she's gained over the years she also observes: 'You have to fight for 
everything you want. Struggle is important. It's how you grow and how you 
change.' 
</P>
<P>Caught up in the first flush of success, Kate's early days were a flurry of
activity  and creative release. In 1978, both The Kick Inside and Lionheart
albums were  released, and in 1979 she embarked on her first and only, and now
fairly legendary,  live tour. 'As I remember it, it was very hard work,' says
Del of the tour. 'I've  never worked so hard as a musician before. We rehearsed
for six months. In the  morning she was coming up to town for dance lessons and
learning dance routines,  then in the afternoon we'd rehearse the band for six
hours, then in the evening we  were going back for production meetings. And
she's still doing that kind of thing  now with this film she's doing. She's a
complete workaholic and a fanatic where  her music's concerned.' Did she enjoy
the tour? 'She really enjoyed it. It's a  common fallacy that she didn't and
that it was a bad experience for her, but she  really enjoyed doing it. But I
think what happened was, it took so much out of her,  that it also took a little
bit of her self-confidence. She then got into the studio  immediately after that
tour ended, in late '79, to start the third album, and she then  got into
producing. She co-produced it with the engineer she was working with at  the
time, and got completely into it. She thought, this is it, I really need to work
in  the studio for a few years and develop my own production techniques and
music as a  studio musician.' And Kate realised too that she'd have to distance
herself from  outside pressures to achieve what she wanted to achieve. 
</P>
<P>'I've always been tenacious when it comes to my work,' she says. 'And I 
became quickly aware of the outside pressures of being famous affecting my work.
It  seemed ironic that I was expected to do interviews and television work which
took  me away from the thing that had put me into that situation. It was no
longer relevant  that I wrote songs. I could see my work becoming something that
had no thought in  it, becoming a personality, which is never what I wanted. All
I wanted was the  creative process.' 'She's the most unlikely star,' adds Del.
'She does not like being  famous, she really does not like it. She wants to be
an ordinary person, but she wants  to make music. She likes the idea of people
getting something from what she does,  but she doesn't want the fame aspect.
She's not the sort of person who will ever go  out clubbing. She just works,
stays at home, goes to the theatre, goes to see films,  and when she can she
goes off on holiday. But that's very rare.'
</P>
<P> It's hard to imagine Kate Bush padding around the house with her slippers
on,  but even superstars have to recharge their batteries. 'She really just lets
herself go.  I  don't mean she puts on 30 stone. It's like &quot;I'm not working
any more, so I'm not  going to let any of this stuff get into my head&quot;. She
potters in the garden - she does  gardening now - she watches TV, goes to the
theatre, eats... And takes in a little  music too... 'She doesn't like to listen
to anything when she's working, but when  she's resting she listens to lots of
stuff. At the moment, she's really into Talk Talk -  she finds a real affinity
with them. And we had a whole period of getting into this  Bulgarian music, and
in the early days it was Irish music. Generally, there's not  many modern bands
she's into, though she likes the Utah Saints. They did a track  with a piece of
her vocal in it: they were really good about it, went through all the  proper
channels, asked if they could use it, gave her a royalty, and she thought it was
 great. She thought it was absolutely fantastic the way they'd actually used it.
In fact,  one time she thought it would be great to do something with them. It
never came to  pass, though...' 
</P>
<P>What did happen was the extended period of inactivity that lead to a four
year  gap between the last album 'The Sensual World, and the release of The Red
Shoes.  Beset by personal tragedy - the loss of many friends, the death of her
mother and  the breakdown of her personal, if not professional, relationship
with Del- the  creative process simply stopped. 'I just couldn't work,' she
says. 'Singng is such a  deeply personal thing to do, I couldn't manage it.'
'There's been a lot of upset,'  adds Del, 'When her mother died, she really
couldn't work for the best part of a  year. But she soon got the urge to get
back in there again. She has to work.' And  when Bush works, she really works.
Not content with producing just another LP,  she's timed its release with the
simultaneous release of an accompanying 50-minute  film 'We've taken six tracks
from the album and made a story line up from the  title track.' 
</P>
<P>'It's about how Kate's a dancer and gets tricked into wearing a pair of red 
shoes, which are possessed and can't stop dancing,' adds Del, 'it's a bit like
the old  film, 'The Red Shoes (the 1948 British classic about a young ballerina
torn between  two lovers - one a struggling composer the other an autocratic
dance impresario).  It's her own interpretation of the idea. There's lots of
dialogue, and Miranda  Richardson and Lindsay Kemp are in it too. Kate's been
busy writing the storyline  and getting it organised.' 
</P>
<P>'It's something like Magical Mystery Tour,' Kate adds, 'But it's not like it
at all.  It's not finished I hate talking about anything until it's there. like
talking to you  about the album if you haven't heard the tracks. Completely
ridiculous.' 
</P>
<P>Never one to explain herself when a well-turned musical phrase will do, Kate
 Bush remains something of an enigma; intensely private, guarded to the point of
 introversion, but always fantastically unique.
