<H2 ALIGN="center">KATE BUSH: WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE?</H2>
<P>by Nick Krewen 
</P>
<P>One question has followed Kate Bush during the 15 years since she released
her  first album and captured hearts everywhere with her elegant voice. Is she
ever going  to tour in North America? Until now, the British singer's response
has always been  No. In a Toronto interview with Canadian journaltists, the
normall y media shy Bush  said she may change her ways to promote her new album,
The Red Shoes. &quot;I'd like  to do some dates at some point for this record,&quot;
said Bush, 35, during a rare  promotional visit. &quot;But as of right now, I
have no plans.&quot; Bush has never played  outside Europe. She finished her
last tour - which consisted of 30 full production  shows which mixed mime, dance
and music - in 1979. Aside from the occasional  charity benefit, Bush has
shunned the stage in favour of the studio. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My reluctance to tour wasn't deliberate in a lot of ways,&quot; she
explained. &quot;There  was a presumption that I didn't enjoy it, which wasn't
true. I did enjoy it. It was an  exciting time for me. But it was completely
exhausting, and at the end of it I felt  quite exposed. At the time, I was
concerned that I was removing myself from  writing songs and recording them,
which is what I wanted to do at the time. I  wanted to work more in the studio
and learn about production.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush says that by the time she got past a long phase where she lost all
desire to  perform, she grew nervous about returning to the stage. &quot;Now
I've come back to  the idea of doing it - especially over the last couple of
years. If we did do something,  I'd like to do something personal. The idea of
standing here and just singing my  songs more simply now appeals to me.&quot; If
she decides to tour, she won't likely have  to worry about filling seats. Every
Kate Bush album released in Canada has gone  past platinum (100,000 copies
sold), and after just a month, The Red Shoes is already  gold (50,000). 
</P>
<P>The album, her seventh, is loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen 
fairytale about a young girl who receives a pair of red shoes which allows her
to  fulfil her dream of becoming a great dancer. She can't stop dancing, though
and the  shoes won't allow themselves to be removed. Eventually, the girl orders
her own  feet to be amputated, and dies. 
</P>
<P>Mutilation aside, Bush says she identifies with the character. &quot;The
imagery of  possessed by an artform - which in this case is dance - so it has a
life of its own, is  something I can relate to.&quot;, she says. &quot;I look at
my albums as probably the same kind  of thing. I am very obsessed by my work
when I'm in the middle of it. I'm quite  tenacious, and don't like to let go of
it until I'm sure I've finished it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes also shows a lighter side to Bush in such songs as Rubberband
Girl  and Eat The Music. She admits it was a conscious move to contrast her last
project,  The Sensual World. &quot; With every album, I like starting from a
fresh point,&quot; she says,  &quot;It's almost a rebellion. I need to do
something totally opposite.&quot; &quot;I wanted to put  more emphasis on the
songs this time out, and less emphasis on production. I tried to  make the songs
more direct, simple, and honest.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush sees the recording experience as a chance to work with friends and
people  she admires. Some of the special guests on the album include violinist
Nigel  Kennedy, Procol Harum founder Gary Brooker, and guitarists Jeff Beck and
Eric  Clapton. But the tops for her was collaborating with Prince on Why Should
I Love  You? &quot;I'm so glad he agreed to work with me,&quot; says Bush. &quot;I've
been a big fan of  his for a long time.&quot; Bush has also ventured into film,
directing a 50 min. short called  The Lion, The Cross and The Curve, which
co-stars Miranda Richardson and is  based around six of the album's songs. It
should be out on video some time next  year. 
</P>
<P>Right now, it's time for a break. &quot;I'm feeling very tired,&quot; admits
Bush. &quot;I'm  going on a holiday. I'm really looking forward to not pleasing
anyone but myself.&quot;
