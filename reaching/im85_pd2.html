<P>Date: Thu, 7 Jun 90 22:19:53 EDT <BR> From: woj@paladin.Owego.NY.US (the
best things in life always melt) <BR> Subject: &quot;conversation disc series.&quot;
Interview HoL
</P>
<P>the following interview appears on a picdisc cd. it has no title or
information  about the interviewer (well, interviewers. it turns out there are
really two interviews  cleverly strung together), other than saying that the
disc is part of the &quot;conversation  disc series.&quot; it was made in
england and has the catalog number abcd 012 and on the  back it claims to be a &quot;limited
edition full length interview of no less than 40  minutes not available in any
other format.&quot; i'm not sure about the limited edition  (supposedly of 2500)
or the availability, but i do know that it is just shy of 33 minutes  long. 
</P>
<P>also, as i mentioned, there are actually *two* interviews on this disc, both
of  which are from the hounds of love period (neither are the recently posted
cbak 4011  austrailian interview). the picture on the disc is a rather nice shot
of KaTe at about  the time of hounds of love. she looks particularly smashing in
a white blouse with  the collar up, earrings that look suspiciously like silver
crabs and a big smile on her  face. 
</P>
<P>apologies if these interviews have already been transcribed, but as there
were no  respones to my query earlier, i'm assuming that these are either newly
available or  just forgotten. 
</P>
<P>ums and uhs have been edited out... 
</P>
<P>int: many congratulations on the success of the album hounds of love and of
course  the singles which have also been very successful. how are you coping
with the  success this time around - are you finding it alot easier than the &quot;wuthering
 heights&quot; days? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes and no, i mean it's easier cos it's something i've experienced
before, so i  don't have the trauma of going into things that are totally
unknown, but on the  other hand it think it's just as hard coming out of such an
intense working period  which is very private now, ie working in the studio on
an album, where maybe,  we're uhh, in the studio constantly for a year, say, and
then i come out into the  whole world of promotion. and it can be just a bit
scary i think, it's a bit daunting  coming form such a private existance to such
a public one. 
</P>
<P>int: is how you cope with the press, because i know you've talked about them
in the  past and haven't been too happy with the whole situation of promotion. 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't, um, i don't really enjoy promoting. it's something that i do
for my work.  i feel that, obviously that when you spend a lot of time working
on something, it's  only right that you come out and let people know that the
album's there. i don't  feel that ever, hopefully, i'm not promoting myself, but
the work. i'm being the  saleswoman for the record or the video or whatever it
is at the time. 
</P>
<P>int: cos the press finds it very difficult, i mean, to dig up juicy news
items on you and  they're trying hard all the time. i mean there was a rumor
that one of the  reasons why you've been away from the scene for quite a long
time is that  you've risen to eighteen stone! 
</P>
<P>kt: yes... 
</P>
<P>int: ridiculous, isn't it? how do they come up with these things? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think when you don't give people anything they make things up. i think
it's  very flattering on lots of levels, the fact that people are still
concerned about  writing about me, the fact that they still remember me and are
hanging on to me.  it's very flattering. 
</P>
<P>int: has it surprised you that you've had this instant success once again?
were you at  all worried that people might have forgotten about kate bush? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think what you worry about is that people don't like what you've
worked on  hard. i mean, again, i don't feel it's me that people are responding
to directly,  it's myself through the expression of music and the work. and i
can't tell you  how rewarding it is that people do recieve this so warmly. 
</P>
<P>int: now you came away from school with tenner &lt;?&gt; levels, so does
that mean you  were a very attentative pupil? 
</P>
<P>kt: um, i think i've just found the whole system of school something that
didn't  really appeal to me - i couldn't really express myself in that whole
system. 
</P>
<P>int: so, presumably, you're favorite lesson was music? 
</P>
<P>kt: i did enjoy music and english, but, i just didn't really enjoy school as
i got older. 
</P>
<P>int: why was that? 
</P>
<P>kt: it's very hard to say, um, i just... 
</P>
<P>int: it's very restrictive, wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, i think i did find it restrictive. 
</P>
<P>int: right, so you couldn't get away quick enough? 
</P>
<P>kt: well, at that point in my life, i really did want to leave school. 
</P>
<P>int: dave gilmour of pink floyd fame gave you your big break. how did that
come  about? 
</P>
<P>kt: well, i'd been writing, i suppose, since i was about thirteen,
seriously. it was my  family and my brother john who felt it would be a good
idea to see if we could  get some of my songs published. and through a friend of
the family, we made a  contact with dave gilmour, who at that time was scouting
for talent to, perhaps,  produce or encourage. he came down and heard some songs
and i think was  impressed. and basically, eventually, he put up the money for
me to go into the  studio and make three tracks properly produced and through
those tracks i got  the recording contract. 
</P>
<P>int: right. now you mentioned your family. did you, have you always had a
lot of  support from them from a very early age? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes. 
</P>
<P>int: was it encouraged the music? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes. i think so. 
</P>
<P>int: cos your dad taught you piano, didn't he? 
</P>
<P>kt: he didn't teach me piano, but he was definitely the encouraging force,
when i  was writing at that time. and whenever i'd written a song, i'd always go
and ask  him to come and listen to it. and he was brilliant, totally
encouraging, and in the  right way in that he wasn't pushing me into it, which i
think, especially for  children, is the wrong thing to do, cos they rebel
against that automatically. 
</P>
<P>int: something which you did in school at the time? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't know if i was rebellious, but there were certain things i didn't
enjoy  being taught. 
</P>
<P>int: and what's the kt bush band? 
</P>
<P>kt: it was a three piece that consisted of del palmer on bass, brian bath on
guitar,  and vic smith who was our drummer. 
</P>
<P>int: and where did you tour? around london? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, we did clubs and pubs in the london area. but this, i mean, was
three  months? no, longer than that... 
</P>
<P>int: so how did you feel about doing that at the time, cos obviously it was
the first  time you actually played an audience. 
</P>
<P>kt: i really enjoyed it. it was just the experience i wanted at that point.
i was looking  for things that would take me further into where i wanted to go,
which was the  music business and i'd been training as a dancer and this felt
like the perfect  stage, really, to go into a live situation. 
</P>
<P>int: looking back on your debut album, the kick inside, how do you
listen...do you  often listen to it now? do you still put it on the turntable at
home? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, i haven't heard it for years. 
</P>
<P>int: why's that? 
</P>
<P>kt: um, it's old! (spoken the way KaTe said &quot;shut up!&quot; on the vh-1
special) 
</P>
<P>int: but how do you look on that album now, as a sort of very experimental? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think it was probably the least experimental of all the albums. i'd
written, say,  two hundred songs from which we chose the thirteen songs that
went on that.  and it was recorded very quickly, there was very little time for
experimentation.  it was something that had a lot of forethought gone into it. 
</P>
<P>int: of course you had the big number one single &quot;wuthering heights.&quot;
to people who  aren't devout fans of kate bush, you mention your name and
immmediately they  say, &quot;oh wuthering heights,&quot; even nowadays. does
that bother you at all? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, i don't think it would be right of me to be rude to a song that has
done so  much for me. 
</P>
<P>int: how did you feel when it went straight to number one. you must have
been very  take a back. 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, very surprised. 
</P>
<P>int: and it was sort of always **** i suppose. i mean, it must have
encouraged you,  obviously, to do a lot more. did you immediately set to work on
the next album? 
</P>
<P>kt: it was very difficult, that whole stage because being so new to the
whole business  and starting with such a successful song, it meant, really, the
next year of my life  was nothing but promotion. and i think it was quite early
on, during that time,  that i decided that promotion was something that had to
come secondary to the  music or i was going to spend my whole life promoting and
never ever making  another album. so, it was a very busy period for me then. 
</P>
<P>int: what are your main song writing influences? obviously quite a difficult
one cos  you must have many. 
</P>
<P>kt: well, yes, that is a very difficult question. subject matter is, it
stems from people.  either through their expressions in films, books, things
that people tell you about,  things you witness. musically, i think that's a
much more obscure area. i mean in  a way, it's the music that often will suggest
the subject matter, so the music is  quite often the thing that sparks it all
off. and that comes from the air, really. 
</P>
<P>int: did you ever feel that you may have missed out on other aspects of life
that other  teenagers may have enjoyed, cos of you rather isolated life. you
spent a lot of time  in the recording studio and promoting the next album. did
you miss out on a  varied social life, for instance? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, i think in many ways, it made me meet more people in a way i wanted
to,  more that ever would be possible if i hadn't gone into the business. and
it's  isolated in that you meet certain types of people at the time. but, it's
continually  challenging and i think, probably, i have met more people and had
much more  experience through what i'm doing now than if i hadn't. there are no
regrets. 
</P>
<P>int: have you ever felt that you were pushed into adult life too quickly? 
</P>
<P>kt: no. i think that's something that happens to kids now, uh, much sooner
than it  did for me. i think it's something that is generally happening sooner
all the time.  kids just grow up quicker now. 
</P>
<P>int: you never had any worries about getting a job, did you? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, i did. i think when you leave school and you don't know what you're
going  to do, um, i was very much throwing myself to fate. if it hadn't worked,
i would  have been in a very difficult situation. and, i just worked very hard
and hoped  that i'd be able to make something of it and i was very lucky. 
</P>
<P>int: did you ever consider an alternative career? 
</P>
<P>kt: i considered it, but it was never anything serious. and that's why i
felt i had to  leave school and just go for it, cos if i didn't make an attempt
to throw myself into  that lifestyle, i didn't feel it was something that was
going to come to me. it's  something you have to go out and get. 
</P>
<P>int: was that partly influenced by your upbringing, by your parents? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't know what it was influenced by. i think it was the very strong
desire in  me that had started when i first started writing at the piano that
this was what i  wanted to do. i didn't want to go to university. i didn't want
to be in a job where  i couldn't be creative. 
</P>
<P>int: but how did other people react to that? they must have been a bit taken
a back. 
</P>
<P>kt: you mean my family? 
</P>
<P>int: yeah, your family, in particular. 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, i thionk obviously, my parents were very concerned. i was leaving
school  going into something that was completely insecure and i think really
they had a  tremendous amount of faith in me, in that they wanted me to be
happy. and they  understood that i wasn't just spending my time doing nothing. i
was very  seriously working on a career that could be insecure, but they had a
great deal of  faith in me. 
</P>
<P>int: looking back, do you have favorite album? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think the last album you do is quite often you favorite one becasue
that's the  one you put the most energy into recently. but, i think the fourth
album had  some very precious moments for me, so i'll say that one for now. 
</P>
<P>int: the dreaming ? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes. 
</P>
<P>int: a lot of people would have said that album was rather abstract and,
possibly, a bit  obscure. and it didn't sell in the quantities that other had
done. did that influence  you on your new album? 
</P>
<P>kt: very difficult to say. i don't know what influences you between one and
the  other, except your life, really. you change with the environment and my 
environment did change between the last album and this one: i moved out of the 
city and into the country. and i think those two energies are very apparent on 
both albums. the fourth album is very much an oppressed city atmosphere album 
and this one just released is very much a freer elemental album. 
</P>
<P>int: did you feel a real need to get out to the country then? 
</P>
<P>kt: i was getting fed up with being in london, yeah. i don't know about a
real need,  but i think it's a very good thing for me. i'm glad i did. it
certainly helped me  relax as a person. 
</P>
<P>int: did it drain your creative energies, then, being in the town? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, i don't think you can say that it drains your creative energies,
because if  anything, and i'm sure a lot of people would agree with me, the
sense of  oppression and energy that you can get from cities can be very, very
productive  to writing songs. but, i found i was getting too many distractions
that was stopping  me have the time to concentrate on my writing. so rather than
being productive,  it was getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>int: do you now commune with nature? 
</P>
<P>kt: (laughs) i don't know about &quot;commune with nature,&quot; but
certainly when i look  out my window and there's trees and fields i feel a lot
happier than concrete  blocks out there. 
</P>
<P>int: when you see the trees and the fields, do you see a song as well? 
</P>
<P>kt: um...no. no, i think it's not quite as basic as that. there's no doubt
that when  you're writing and you look out the window and there is that force
out there,  that it does effect you very differently than if it was a city or by
the sea.  definitely, your environments do affect you, much more than we think.

</P>
<P>int: and of course, your working environments too. you've just designed and
built  your own studio. how are you finding that, working in your own studio? 
</P>
<P>kt: it's superb. there really couldn't have been better decisions made in
this time  between the last album and this where i've moved and we've moved the
studio  to where we are. there are so many areas where it's helped. again, i
feel much  more relaxed, much freer to work in an uninhibited way. i do get
quite nervous if  you've got people you don't know coming in listening. in the
london studio,  people always coming in borrowing pieces of equipment, the
phone's always  ringing and it's costing you a phenomenal amount of money every
hour. so, you  do feel guilty if you experiment, becasue you feel you're just
throwing money  away. at home, obviously, there aren't those pressures at all. 
</P>
<P>int: cos you've got quite a reputation as a slow worker. 
</P>
<P>kt: yes. 
</P>
<P>int: why do you feel that need to take everything so slowly? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't think i feel a need to take things slowly at all. in fact, it's
very, very  frustrating for me that things take as long as they do. it's never
planned. it's just  something that takes over once you get into the studio. and
the songs are there.  they really do create their own life force and they take
over you and they just  drag me behind them till they're finished. and, uh, it's
strange, cos quite often i  wouldn't really want to go in and work on the album
- i was tired. but, you just  sort of go in there, it drags you behind it. 
</P>
<P>int: have you ever had pressure from a record company to get on with it? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't have that relationship with the record company. i make an album
and i  present it to them and i think if they're happy with the album then our 
relationship is successful. 
</P>
<P>int: you, of course, had the big hit single &quot;running up that hill&quot;
taken from the  hounds of love album. what inspired that song? 
</P>
<P>kt: that was the first song i wrote when we moved to the country. i think it
was,  perhaps, an expression of freedom from the things i'd felt before. it's
very much  about love and the power of love. and the frustration of
misunderstanding within  relationships. if a man could become a woman and the
woman a man, within  their relationship, that perhaps they'd understand a bit
more about each other. 
</P>
<P>int: and that's the deal with god? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes. 
</P>
<P>int: there's some very complicated dance routines in the video. must have
taken a  long time to work those out? 
</P>
<P>kt: that was a lot of fun. i was working there with diane grey, a
choreographer, who  i met a couple of years ago. it's very exciting working with
other people. i think  it's especially so when you spend such a lot of time,
say, in the studio where  you're only working with a set group, say two other
people. and it was very  inspiring working with the, uh, choreographer, who's
also such a good dancer  and we got on well together. we had lots of fun. 
</P>
<P>int: side two of the hounds of love album is a concept piece called &quot;the
ninth wave.&quot;  will you tell us a little bit about that? 
</P>
<P>kt: it's about someone who is in the water for the night. alone in the
water. and it's  really about their past, present and future coming to keep them
awake to stop  them drowning, to stop them going to sleep until the morning
comes. 
</P>
<P>int: it isn't immediately obvious, is it, if you listen to the album? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, i don't think so. i don't know if that's relevant or important
though. i think  the most important thing is that people that listen to it get
something out of it,  that they enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>int: alright. now, you seem to have a fascination with water. i noticed that
a couple of  your favorite movies, don't look now and cruel sea, which are very
much on a  watery theme. so have you a fascination for water? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, yes i do. i think that everyone does really. i think that cruel sea
was one film  that i particularly mentioned though as being a very influential
force for this side.  so, it would have to do something with water. (chuckles) 
</P>
<P>int: and also, there's the tennyson poem, isn't it? &quot;the coming of
arthur&quot;? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think, um, a lot of people tend to presume that the whole side was
written from  that quote and, in fact, that it was completely the other way
around, where, i just  needed a title for the whole piece and there was nthing
within any of the songs,  any of tht titles that was right for it. so i juist
started looking through some books  to try and find a title and found that
quote, which seemed to be saying, more or  less, wehat i wanted to say, so it
was used to express the title. 
</P>
<P>int: and you want to turn the piece into a video? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, it's just an idea. i would very much like to turn it into film. i
mean for me  now, film and video are two very separate visual things. but uh...

</P>
<P>int: for cinema release? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, ideally. but, it's just something you can talk about at this point.
i mean really,  not until early next year, i wouldn't have time to start
checking out the  feasibility, but it is something i would like to do, but
whether it will happen of  not, we'll see. 
</P>
<P>int: alright, you mentioned drowning. have you a phobia of drowning and
death? i  mean, does it worry you in particular, or is it something you just
take in stride? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't think i have a phobia of water at all. i think it is something
we should all  be certainly scared of, be respectful of it. but i don't think i
have a phobia of  water. and death i think is something anyone who writes would
certainly deal  with death at some point. i rather like woody allen's quote
about he doesn't  mind dying, but he doesn't want to be there when it happens.
(laughing) 
</P>
<P>int: (laughs) yes. have you any religious beliefs? 
</P>
<P>kt: no. not, not ones that i could name. i mean, i do believe in certain...
i suppose,  cause and effect is something that i would believe in a bit, but
whether they're  religious beliefs, i don't know. 
</P>
<P>int: &quot;cause and effect&quot; - explain that. 
</P>
<P>kt: well, i think if you behave i a certain way, then that energy will come
back to  you. the boomerang syndrome. 
</P>
<P>int: so the more positive one is in their thoughts and actions, the more
positive life  they will lead? and vice versa? 
</P>
<P>kt: ah, yes, i would...i think there is a lot in that. i think there's also
a lot in that if  you are positive and can be, even if things around you aren't
necessarily coming  back, at least you cope with them better. 
</P>
<P>int: so you think there's this sort of powerful force behind it all? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, i think it's actually a survival technique, a self-preservation
where if you can  always keep coming back, keep coming up again, not staying
down there, then  you're going to get a lot more done, you're going to be a lot
more in control of  what's happening than if you're depressed, unhappy. 
</P>
<P>int: you mentioned earlier that one of your favorite movies was don't look
now,  which stars donald sutherland. is that the reason you picked him for your
new  video? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't know if it's the reason. i mean don't look now is a totally
brilliant film  and everyone in it was wonderful. but, this was a very different
piece. and it was  quite coincidental, i suppose, that we thought of donald. and
i think at that time  the only references to don't look now that there couldn't
have been anyone  better and we were so lucky becasue he was our first choice.
and through a  friend we managed to find a way of contacting him. and um, it was
quite  incredible really to think that he did it. i still find it hard to
believe. 
</P>
<P>int: he's been quite a fan of your for years, hasn't he? 
</P>
<P>kt: um. well, if he was, i certainly didn't know that. i don't, i don't
think so. 
</P>
<P>int: alright. one of those pressure quotes again &lt;?&gt;. tell us a bit
about the song then,  &quot;cloudbusting&quot;. 
</P>
<P>kt: very much inspired by a book, which i found, must be nine years ago now,
on a  bookshelf. i just picked it off the shelf and read it. it's quite an
extrordinary  book. it's very sad and moving. and it's written by the man, his
name is peter  reich, about when he was a child, it was the relationship between
himself as a  child and his father. and it's written very much through the eyes
of the child. so  it has an incredible sense of innocence and intimacy between
him and this great  big man who's his father and meant everything to him. peter
reich's father was  a very respected psychoanalyst who did a lot of of work. and
one thing that's  mentioned in the book, that's quite aside from his theoretical
work was that he  had a machine that could make it rain. and the two of them
would go out  together and make it rain. this was really where the video came
in, to explain all  this. it really is an extrordinary book and everyone that i
gave it to to read said it  was the saddest book they ever read. 
</P>
<P>int: there are many people credited on the latest album, hounds of love, and
the  credits include terry gilliams of monty python fame. why did you give him a
 mention? 
</P>
<P>kt: terry's been a great help in pointing me towards people i could use for
the  videos. i'm a great fan of terry, i think he's a brilliant director - i
love his films.  i think he's more talented than people have appreicated yet.
he's a really great  filmmaker and i think a serious one too. and i just managed
to be lucky enough  to have made contact with him and he's helped me find people
that i could work  with on these last two videos. 
</P>
<P>int: so you're quite a fan of slapstick and that type of thing? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, i'm not a fan of flaps (gets tongue-tied) slapstick! but of doing
things  unusually and brilliantly. i mean i think his sense of composition, his
sense of  photographing things is superb, is brilliant. 
</P>
<P>int: enjoy &quot;faulty towers?&quot; 
</P>
<P>kt: wonderful! i don't think there is anyone who doesn't really. is there?
have you  met anyone who doesn't like it? 
</P>
<P>int: no - i love it personally. now you've had a great deal of success in a
relatively  short time &lt;seven or eight years?!?&gt; really. so where do do
you go from here? it  must be difficult to know what to do next. 
</P>
<P>kt: not at all, i think. trouble is it takes me so long to do things that
i've sorta  brought up a backlog of not being able to do the things i want. so,
um, it's, it's  enjoyable for me to get the album finished and when this
promotional work is  finished, thst means i can launch into the next project. i
think i'd alwasy like to  be able to make albums, that's something that is very
iportant to me, making  music. and apart from that, i think it's experimentation
from now on really. 
</P>
<P>int: do you ever see a day when you might retire? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, not yet (laughs). 
</P>
<P>int: not for a few years yet? (chuckling) 
</P>
<P>kt: well i hope so - don't write me off yet! 
</P>
<P>int: do you see yourself in a little cottage on the countryside eventually? 
</P>
<P>kt: yes, i'd like to be in a little cottage in the countryside now, i think!
i don't think  you have to retire to do that. just makes travelling into london
a bit longer. 
</P>
<P>int: have any plans for a family? 
</P>
<P>kt: no, again, not yet. my work takes up all my time. 
</P>
<P>int: is that altogether a healthy thing, you think? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't know if it's healthy. but, it's certainly very enjoyable. i get
a tremendous  amount of satisfaction out of actually feeling that i've achieved
something. like  finishing an album. or finishing a video. because it's always
so hard when you're  stuck in the middle of a project and sometimes you're
neversure if you're going  to be able to finish it, so to actually reach that
point, that relief when the thing is  over, it's incredibly rewarding! 
</P>
<P>int: particularly when it's a big success. 
</P>
<P>kt: (laughingly) yes, particularly. 
</P>
<P>int: thanks kate. 
</P>
<P>----------
</P>
<P>well, that's the first part. KaTe sounds pretty relaxed throughout the whole
 thing. if anyone can identify the interviewer (who, although some-times 
presumptuous, isn't too bad of a guy), i'd be happy to hear who it is. the total
 length of that interview is about 23 and a half minutes. 
</P>
<P>the second interview is as follows. this time, the interviewer is bit
stifled or stiff.  even more interesting is that there is surface noise during
KaTe's speaking parts  while there is none during the interviewer's, leading me
to wonder if this was one  of those &quot;canned interviews&quot; that radio
stations sometimes get (i know of one with  the cowboy junkies that came with a
script and timings, so you could &quot;interview&quot;  them on the air with you
asking the questions). also, the relative length of the  questions and responses
made me think more and more that this one was canned. 
</P>
<P>i wasn't able to find her words though in any interviews that i had around
the  house, so i figured i'd type it in anyways. 
</P>
<P>it's just under nine minutes long. 
</P>
<P>int: where do you get the ideas for the imagery in your music and videos? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think most of my imagery comes from films. but, initially, it all
comes from  people. films are really the expression of the director, the actors,
the people who  make the music. i think that definitely, it's the stories and
the situations that  people are in that are the bigget inspirations. i have some
very interesting stories  told by friends of things that have happened to them
or people they know. and  books, of course, are another very obvious inspiration
for def- initely some of my  songs. 
</P>
<P>int: what types of books and authors do you like reading? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't think i'm obviously well-read. i think that's something that's,
perhaps,  presumed. i get very little time to read, it's something that i feel
quite guilty  about cos i'm a very slow reader and if i'm sitting down reading a
book i feel i  should be doing something else that's more important. i do get
time to read in  the car, but i don't really read like i would like to and my
favorite kind of books,  i would say generally are fiction. 
</P>
<P>int: when did you start thinking about writing and recording hounds of love
? 
</P>
<P>kt: it has been a big gap between this album and the last one. i hit the end
of '82  having finished the promotion for the last album and really wanted to
take a  break. when you work so intensely on an album when when you're in the
studio  for a year really constantly, you want to spend some time at home, see
your  friends. so i did this, taking in new stimulus realy at the same time for
the new  album, so the material would be different and interesting hopefully and
would not  be the same same energy as the last album, but would be something
fresh and  inter- esting. i started working with a new dance teacher and spent a
lot of time  equipping and building a recording studio which we've recorded all
the material  for the album in. this was very much encouraged by my father who
thought it  would be a good move and i do think that it's one of the best
decisions that i've  made. it make the whole process so much easier. i do
actually write the songs  now in the recording studio, so right form the word
go, i'm writing onto master  tape. i suppose the ideas were actually forming on
tape, so i actually started  writing the album at the very end of '83 and '84
was spent recording and  finishing the writing. and it was finished this year. 
</P>
<P>int: do you enjoy writing? 
</P>
<P>kt: i do very much enjoy writing the songs. for me, more and more so, the
whole  recording production process is all part of the writing. as soon as the
song's gone  onto tape, i'm writing - what i'm doing is actually writing it onto
tape, so the  production, the arrangements, the lyrics, everything are part of
that for me. i  think it would feel like i was fulfilling the whole process now
if i wasn't involved  in these areas. 
</P>
<P>int: what kind of satisfaction do you feel when the production of the album
is  finished? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think the obvious kind of personal satisfaction i do feel when the
album is  finished is pure relief. that's a good feeling, to feel that you've
actually  accomplished it and finished it and hopefully, it wouldn't be finished
if it wasn't  something that you felt was worthwhile going out in some form or
another. 
</P>
<P>int: what was the idea behind the hounds of love ? 
</P>
<P>kt: the idea for &quot;hounds of love&quot;, the title track are very much
to do with love itself  and people being afraid of it, the idea of wanting to
run away from love, not to let  love catch them, and trap them, in case the
hounds might want to tear them to  pieces. it's very much using the imagery of
love as something coming to get you  and you've got to run away from it or you
won't survive. 
</P>
<P>int: tell us about &quot;running up that hill&quot;. 
</P>
<P>kt: &quot;runing up that hill&quot; was one of the first songs that i wrote
for the album. it was  very nice for me that it was the first single released, i
always hoped that it would  be the way. it's very much about a rela- tionship
between a man and a woman  who are deeply in love and they're so concerned that
things could go wrong -  they have great insecurity, great fear of the
relationship itself. it's really saying if  there's a possibility of being able
to swap places with each other that they'd  understand how the other one felt,
that when they were saying things that  weren't meant to hurt, that they weren't
meant sincerely, that they were just  misunderstood. in some ways, i suppose the
basic diff- erence between men and  women, wher if we could swap places in a
rela- tionship, we'd understand each  other better, but this, of course, is all
theoretical anyway. 
</P>
<P>int: and what about &quot;cloudbusting&quot;? 
</P>
<P>kt: &quot;cloudbusting&quot; is a track that was very much inspired by a
book called a book of  dreams. this book is written through a child's eyes,
looking at his father and how  much his father means to him in his world - he's
everything. his father has a  machine that can make it rain, amongst many other
things, and there's a  wonderful sense of magic as he and his father make it
rain together on this  machine. the book is full of imagery of an innocent child
and yet it's being  written by a sad adult, which gives it a strange kind of
personal intimacy and  magic that is quite extrordinary. the song is really
about how much tha father  meant to the son and how much he misses him now he's
gone. 
</P>
<P>int: do you plan a tour, maybe a &quot;hounds of love tour&quot;? 
</P>
<P>kt: i really ernjoyed touring. i've only done the one tour way back, now, in
'79. and  the problem really was getting enough new material to do another tour
initially.  getting enough material took me to the last album. the third and
fourth album  would be the two albums of new material that i would've toured.
but at the end  of the last album, it didn't feel like the right moment to take
a tour around  europe. so, that's still a possibility for the furture, but
that's nothing that i can  commit myself to. i just would like to continue
saying that i would like to tour,  but i've no idea when and i do hope that i
get to do another one before i'm old  and grey. 
</P>
<P>int: how important is video to you? 
</P>
<P>kt: i think video has become something a little out of proportion at the
moment in  that it's being wuite exploited. everyone has to do a video now if
they've got a  single coming out so there's an awful lot of stuff around.
therefore, like  everything, when there's a lot of it, there's a lot of rubbish.
i think there's some  very good stuff happening and when it's good, i think it
can be quite effective. i  think the general badness of things gives video quite
an unfair name in that in  can be quite a creative form of art. i think it's a
shame how it can influence  things too much as well, perhaps it's a distracting
influence sometimes from the  song. i feel that in an industry that's a music
in- dustry that the music should  come first rather than the video. it would be
wrong if this got out of proportion  and people were being signed cos they
looked good on video rather than actually  being musically worthy, so let's hope
that the priorities stay right. 
</P>
<P>int: what are your ultimate goals? 
</P>
<P>kt: i don't think i have any achievement wishes really. i'm continuously
saying to  myself how lucky i am to be doing what i am. i'm happy working in my
music  which is what i've always wanted. in a way, there's more than that in
that i have  all the areas that are attached to the music like the visual
enterprises. i just hope  that i will be able to keep doing that. that's really
my wishes. 
</P>
<P>---------
</P>
<P>hmmm....maybe he just reinserted his questions afterwards. i don't know. 
</P>
<P>if anyone is interested in a copy of these interviews, email me and i'll see
what i  can do for you.
