<P>Return of the vanishing lady 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush dances back and tells of her two years in self-exile 
</P>
<P>by Clive Goodman 
</P>
<P>Daily Mail 
</P>
<P>August 6, 1985 
</P>
<P>At her peak, she had four successful albums in the charts, a series of hit
singles,  and was hailed as the country's brightest, freshest new star. 
</P>
<P>Her dramatic, ethereal voice and erotic, theatrical dance routines had pop
pundits  predicting a long career at the top. 
</P>
<P>Instead, quite suddenly two years ago, she simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>There were stories about drugs and a retreat on a Caribean island. 
</P>
<P>The truth is that Kate Bush, the shy elfin-faced Kent doctor's daughter who
took  the charts by storm with Wuthering Heights, was simply tired of the
showbiz circus  that surrounded her. 
</P>
<P>It took her six months to get her feet back on the ground and relax. It took
her  another 18 months in a private recording studio near the house she shares
with  long-time boyfriend Del Palmer, to produce a new album. 
</P>
<P>Now, with the single released yesterday and the L.P. and video out later,
Kate  Bush feels ready to face the world again. On the Berkshire set where the
video was  filmed, she explained why she had locked herself away. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I finished my last album, did the promotion, then found myself in a
kind of  limbo,&quot; she said. &quot;It took me four or five months to be able
even to write again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's very difficult when you've been working for years, doing one
album after  another. You need fresh things to stimulate you. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's why I decided to take a bit of the summer out and spend time
with my  boyfriend and with my family and friends, just relaxing. Not being Kate
Bush the  singer, just being myself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was an incredible period of isolation. When I restarted work on the
album, I  found times when I didn't even know what was in the charts! 
</P>
<P>SURPRISE 
</P>
<P>&quot;You get up, go to the studio, work there all day, then come home and
go to bed.  There's just no time to take anything in.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There is little doubt the stories that circulated about Kate while she was
away, hit  home. Despite being signed by EMI as a fresh-faced 16-year old and
writing for  three years before becoming a performer, the music business still
took her by  surprise. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The pop scene is incredibly bitchy,&quot; she says. &quot;Reading
stories like that can make  you feel very vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm a private person and when I'm working in the studio I live an
isolated  lifestyle, and not treated like someone famous. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I come out of that into the real world and people start treating
me like a  star, I feel very strange.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her family and her relationship with Palmer helped anchor her against the
ups  and downs of her career. &quot;We're a very close family and all enjoy
being involved in  a project together. That keeps me level-headed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>For her latest album, Kate promises something different. &quot;It took me a
long time  to write the songs because I wanted one side to be a concept, and
that took a lot of  work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>For the video, Kate worked with director David Garfath on the complicated
dance  routines. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I do like to be very involved. That's definitely part of my nature. I
think that if  you have strong idea about things you have to carry them through.&quot;
