<P>Date: Mon, 21 Nov 88 16:55 PST <BR> From: Andrew Marvick (IED) <BR>
Subject: NME by Danny Baker, Fall 1979 
</P>
<P>The following interview was conducted by Danny Baker for New Musical Express
 in the fall of 1979. IED will try to refrain from commenting during the text,
but he  must say at the outset that this interview must rank as one of the most
hostile and  unprofessional to date. Mr. Baker is clearly out of his league when
discussing with an  artist of Kate's intelligence and sensibilty any matters
relating to art. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, he admits that he is not familiar with most of her work; and 
although he also makes it clear that he did not see the live performances, he is
quite  content to repeat his colleague's foolish conclusions about them. He
makes an  offensive and narrow-minded assumption that is all too common among
the English  music press: namely, that his readership are in agreement with his
essentially  Philistine and socialist attitude toward art. He therefore stupidly
assumes that those  comments by Kate which tend to dispute such an attitude are
worthy only of ridicule.  Finally, in stating, with typically misplaced pride,
that he has &quot;cut about a hundred&quot;  of Kate's &quot;wows&quot; and &quot;amazings&quot;,
he inadvertantly undermines the journalistic  legitimacy of his entire text. For
if these words (so casually counted) were deemed  unworthy of the readers'
attention, what else of Kate's speech may have been &quot;cut&quot;,  as well?
It is interviews such as these that explain Kate's great reluctance, these 
days, to speak to the press--especially the English music press. 
</P>
<P>Despite these lamentable transgressions on Mr. Baker's part, Kate manages to
 offer several stunningly brilliant, thoughtful and challenging ideas for the
careful and  openminded reader to entertain. We can only guess at how many
others were  overlooked or rejected by Mr. Baker before his article went to
press. 
</P>
<P>In the interest of fairness, IED would like to let |&gt;oug know that he has
noted  Kate's comments below about fans on the street etc. As far as IED knows,
this is the  only instance in which Kate has expressed such sentiments, and the
reliability of the  transcription is certainly not beyond question. Still, it's
worth noting her apparent  ambivalence about this subject. 
</P>
<P>&quot; Wow, Wow, Wow, Amazing, Amazing, Ama--&quot;
</P>
<P> ( and that's only at the supermarket) 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush puts the problems of western society in perspective. 
</P>
<P>Danny Baker hears the Pop Goddess tolkein about her favourite hobbits 
</P>
<P> EMI: Three letters that have come to represent &quot;the enemy&quot; in
rock'n'roll's  war games. EMI House rambles like a country home with a thousand
warrens of  ministry--type boring pools and divisions. The guard on the
reception listens to my  appointment with Kate Bush with all the emotion of a
weighing machine being told a  hard luck story. Like everyone else, I get told
to take a seat while he talks, unheard,  into one of the extension phones. About
ten minutes later I'm led down and through  EMI House and up to a corridor down
which the Daily Mirror's Pauline McLeod is  striding. She's out--I'm in. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is sipping Perrier water from an elegant glass. I tell her she'll
get a  royal old bulge if she carries on guzzling the gin like that, and she
laughs naturally.  She's far more attractive than I'd ever thought--not being
the globe's most rabid  fan of the woman, y'understand--although quite short. 
</P>
<P>NME had been after a KB interview for a while but, so I'd learned on leaving
 the office, her management were less than obliging. Me? Well, the truth is that
I  had no opinions about Kate at all. I knew the singles, but I really couldn't
find it in  me to go any deeper, to check out her roots (he said, nicking in
this piece's most  contrived gag). I still don't...such was our meeting. 
</P>
<P> Hey Kate. Do you feel obliged to sing like that these days? 
</P>
<P>&quot;What? You mean...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Y'know, like you could age the nation's glassblowers. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, I don't feel obliged--that is me. See, like in
a recording  studio, when it's all dark and there's just you and a couple of
guys at the desk, well,  you get really so involved that to actually plan it
becomes out of the question. It just  flows that way. As a writer I just try to
express an idea. I can't possibly think of old  songs of mine because they're
past now, and quite honestly I don't like them  anymore.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Doing Wuthering Heights must've been murder then. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I was still promoting that up until 18 months after I'd had it
released.  Abroad I was still promoting it on TV, where I was able to do it
backwards and (she  mimes it whilst picking her nose nonchalantly)...just weird.&quot;
Have you still got  people around you who'll tell you something's rubbish? 
</P>
<P>&quot;My brother Jay, who's been with me since I was writing stuff that
really  embarasses me--he'd let me know for sure... Yeah, there's a few I can
really trust.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She smiles again and I was warm to her. Mind you, she speaks my language, so
I  could be sympathetic because she's one of the South London rock mafia. I ask
her  what it's like to be paraded in the Sun and suchlike as the Sex Goddess of
POP! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hmmm. You see, you do a very straight interview with these people,
without  ever mentioning sex, but of course that's the only angle they write it
from when you  read it. That kind of freaks me out, because the public tend to
believe it...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Asking a few more questions, I begin to realise that this isn't the kind of
stuff  that weekloads of Gasbags &lt;The NME letters page&gt; are made of. I'm
searching for a  key probe, but with Kate Bush--well, there's not likely to be
anything that will  cause the twelve-inch banner-headline stuff, is there now? I
recall Charlie Murray's  less than enthusiastic review of her Palladium shows,
which were apparently  crammed with lame attempts to &quot;widen&quot; the
audience's artistic horizons--y'know,  lots of people dressed as violins and
carrots an' that. CSM reckons it was one of the  most condescending gigs in the
history of music. Kate had read the review, but she  didn't break down. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Just tell me one thing,&quot; she said in normal tones. &quot;I mean,
was he actually at the  show that night?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yeah, sure. I remember he told me he'd spent a week there one Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, well, in that case that's just his opinion and he's entitled to
it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We all smiled again, and Kate asked me if I'd seen Alien. I wondered if she
got  out much herself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I don't get out to parties often. I have this thing about
wasting time...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh really? Which thing is that? 
</P>
<P>&quot;You know, I nag at myself all the time for being a waster. I think,
'Gosh, you  could be creating the world or something.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, that certainly seems a worthwhile thing to do, all right, although it
has in  fact been done before. Y'see, occasionally Kate allows the poet and
all-round  Tyrannosaurus Rex dreamer to slip out, a sucker for Lord of the
Rings. For a start I  have cut about a hundred &quot;wows&quot; and &quot;amazings&quot;
from her speech. She talks at  length about how important she feels it is to be
&quot;creating&quot; all the time, and when I  asked her if she looked to the
news for any song inspiration I got this curious  answer: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, whenever I see the news, it's always the same depressing things.
War's  hostages and people's arms hanging off with all the tendons hanging out,
you know.  So I tend not to watch it much. I prefer to go and see a movie or
something, where  it's all put much more poetically. People getting their heads
blown off in slow  motion, very beautifully.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She grins broadly again. Kate is an artist through and through, seeing the
world  as a crazy canvas on which to skip. Her outrageous charm covers the fact
that we are  in the midst of a hippy uprising of the most devious sorts. I
approach her on the  question of being a woman in pop music once more. How do
her workmates treat  her? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, when I started, I felt really conscious of being female amongst
all these  fellows. But these days I feel like one of the lads.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That doesn't sound very healthy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yeah, it is. When I'm working, it's really important for me to get
on with it  in that way. But at the same time, I sense that they're very
respectful, because they  make me aware of being a woman, and will lay off the
dirty jokes and that...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Incredible. Do you find men in awe of you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Socially? Well, I find that--with people that I haven't seen for a
couple of years,  because they won't treat me as a human being. And people in
the street will ask for  autographs and also won't treat you as human,
but...ah...sometimes I get really  scared. Sometimes when I'm going to the
supermarket to get the coffee and cat  litter, I get freaked out and see all
these people staring, and you turn around and  there's like forty people all
looking at you...and when you go around the corner,  they're all following you!
You start freaking out like a trapped animal. 
</P>
<P>&quot;However, I don't notice guys doing it on a personal level. Maybe some
will keep  their distance, but that may be because they don't get off on me. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You see, when I first got started, I thought that I'd better watch out
for these  rip-off artists and stick with old friends. But it's amazing that
since I've been in the  business, I've made many more real friends, especially
on a working basis. I find  that I can get so involved with a guy working with
me--and usually on a platonic  level, which is great! That's so special, like
these two minds linked on this one  project. And that is a very beautiful thing
that I'd never have experienced if I had  not been in this business. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And what's more, I'll keep these friends for life, because not only do
they care  for you, but they give me information and their teachings. What more
could I ask  for?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you think there's a danger of becoming detached inside music? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Probably. I don't read newspapers, and I've said I don't watch the
news. I love  books, but I don't read much. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What I do is I get people to read to me, and I put the stories in my
head.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A bit like a hat, I suppose. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And films. I watch an awful lot of TV films.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you think you might be avoiding real life? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, no, because I think that all these heavy issues--equality among
blacks and  whites, etc.--have all been done before, and if you do it now, it
has to be very  cleverly handled. It all gets too negative and cliched. So I
find that, working with  fantasy, I can handle the same issues, perhaps, but in
a more positive way.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Don't you think that albums can make you feel and think sometimes without 
er...pussyfooting? I remember the first time I heard The Clash, and... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yeah, some of these new bands are amazing. They're just springing
up. The  Police are just amazing...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Here, listen, I think you've got the picture. Kate Bush, to meet, is a
happy,  charming woman that can totally win your heart. But afterwards on tape,
when  she's not there and you actually listen to all this, well...golly gosh.
Don't lose sleep,  old mates, it's just pop music-folk and the games they spin.
Wow. 
</P>
<P>This was Chicken Licken, Cosmic News, Atlantis, goodnight, man...
