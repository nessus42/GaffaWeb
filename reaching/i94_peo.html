</P>
<P>I missed this when it first came out, and I don't remember seeing any
mention of  it on this newsgroup.  Please forgive me if I'm wrong.  But an
earlier issue of  People Magazine (Jan. 24, I believe) had a short interview!

<H3>Talking With...Kate Bush </H3>
<H3>ENDING THE ISOLATION </H3>
<P>&quot;People tell me they feel it's quicker and easier to get into this
record than some  of my others,&quot; Kate Bush says of her new CD, _The Red
Shoes_.  &quot;From the  beginning, I wanted to make this an album of songs
rather than a concept album.  I  wanted a more straightforward approach, to not
be so experimental with my  arrangements.&quot; 
</P>
<P>After tasting success with her lush 1978 debut single, &quot;Wuthering
Heights,&quot; the  35-year-old vocalist has dabbled in straight-ahead rock,
breathy ballads and even  world music.  Until now, most of her recording was
done alone, with accompanists  laying down their tracks separately. This time
Bush avoided that isolation by  spending the past 2 1/2 years working with other
artists at her home studio, a  process that gave the disc more spontneity. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I work in a very contained environment, usually,&quot; she explains. &quot;So
I took more  of a band approach to the tracks this time.  To actually work with
human beings  again was wonderful.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Some of those humans were Eric Clapton, Prince, and ex-Procol Harum 
keyboardist Gary Brooker. Each was invited to play on a _Red Shoes_ song for 
which Bush felt they were particularly suited. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My guitarist [Alan Murphy] died a few years ago,&quot; she says.  &quot;Rather
than look  for a replacement, I went the other way and thought about who would
be my ideal  person on each track.  It was interesting how quickly they
responded.  I was very  flattered that they'd be so positive about working with
me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Famous names lending a hand on a few songs.  Songs that have plenty of hit 
potential. {Sure}  Even rumors of a concert tour, her first since 1979. 
{Heh-heh-heh}   Can a beer commercial be far behind?  Don't count on it.
{Fruitopia, maybe?}  &quot;It's  not my ambition to be a big star,&quot; she
says.  &quot;I'm just lucky to do what I like for a  living.  That's all.&quot;
