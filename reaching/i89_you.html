<P>Date: Mon, 23 Oct 89 17:15:18 BST <BR> From:
nbc%INF.RL.AC.UK@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: You Magazine by Lesley-Ann Jones
October 22nd, 1989 
</P>
<P>The following is an article which appeared in You Magazine (The Mail on 
Sunday), October 22nd, 1989. Writer Lesley-Ann Jones, with pictures by Alistair 
Morrison. Copyright Associated Newspapers Plc. 
</P>
<P>Don't expect too much about the music - this is the same paper that is
serialising  Nancy Reagan's memoirs!! 
</P>
<P>  Under The Burning Bush 
</P>
<P>... is just an ordinary woman very much in control of her life. But in front
of the  camera Kate Bush ignites and the release of her latest album, The
Sensual World, is  bound to start the sparks flying again. 
</P>
<P>She looks like any other young student making the best of a bad grant. Her 
uniform - jeans, sweatshirt and trainers - is on overtime. A plum-rinsed,
disorderly  mane. Kate Bush is a 31-year-old millionairess. 
</P>
<P>The pure unearthly quality in her voice has made a mockery of musical
fashion  and made Kate Bush a platinum-selling artist for over a decade. In the
flesh she is  nice, kind, pretty and she smiles a lot. And that's about it.
Confront her with a lens  though and she ignites. In the 11 years since she made
`Wuthering Heights' she's  learned about the potency of her image and the sexual
invitations it gives out. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I never really understood the power of photography. As a dancer, I was
 incredibly at home in my body. I simply didn't see it the way other people did.
 Pictures give such immediate impressions. In all the early photo sessions I
did, we  experimented with dancers' clothes, discovering how interesting and
versatile dance  garments can be. This was all well before the leotard era. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Subsequently, EMI produced a large poster of me in which you can
clearly see  the outline of my breasts through a rather skimpy vest. It seemed
innocent enough,  rather nice, even - at the time. But with hindsight, I
completely understand why  people said I was overtly sexual. It stood out a
mile. Then it didn't seem the least bit  suggestive. Now, I would definitely
have the picture cropped.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Today she says, almost sadly, that she is now much more aware of the darker
side  of life. And, just as sexuality must not be confused with things sensual,
there is a  great difference between innocence and naivety. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You can retain your innocence throughout life,&quot; she believes,
bless her. &quot;It never  really goes away. No, innocence has nothing to do
with being childlike. No, I'm not a  child-woman. No, I'm not reluctant to grow
up. God. What is this world for if you  can't always appreciate the innocence in
life?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is not exactly the archetypal rock star. When she hasn't got a new
 album out, she disappears off the face of the earth (I mean Eltham). While most
 rock 'n' rollers seize every photo opportunity, from falling out of Langan's 
Brasserie to cropping up at every showbiz bash going, Kate has not even been on
the  road for ten years. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I did a tour once,&quot; she remembers, squinting into the distant
past. &quot;I haven't  wanted to do one since. Consequently a lot of people
think that I hate touring, but  that's not so. I absolutely loved it. But it was
so exhausting mentally and physically  that I was literally drained, wasted,
afterwards. It took a long time to recover.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She gets away with murder when you think about it. One tour in a decade,
then  she retreats into her personal recording studio, leaps about in her own
dance studio  to her heart's content, evaporates into thin air for years at a
time, then comes  belting back into the charts like she's never been away. In
any other artist this  would be intensely annoying, sickening even. In Kate, it
is endearing. 
</P>
<P>You could say she has well and truly screwed the system. She is doing it
still. It is  four years since Kate's last album, Hounds of Love. Last week saw
the release of  her sixth, The Sensual World, which features, so I'm told,
Bulgarian backing singers,  and Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour, the man who
discovered Kate. 
</P>
<P>Theirs was an unlikely encounter: she the shy, 15-year-old, violin- and 
piano-playing doctor's daughter, he the wild and wicked lead guitarist with 70s 
supergroup Pink Floyd. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A friend of the family, Rickie Hopper, introduced us&quot;, Kate
recalls. &quot;Absolutely  terrified and trembling like a leaf, I sat down and
played for him. But Dave liked my  songs very much. He put up some money, sent
me into the studio to make three  really well-produced tracks. I did &quot;The
Man With the Child in His Eyes&quot;, &quot;The  Saxophone Song&quot;, plus some
obscure thing which ended up on a B side somewhere.&quot; 
</P>
<P>By 16, Kate was signed to Pink Floyd's own record company EMI. She has been 
there ever since. To gain live experience, she sang in a three-piece rock 'n'
roll  band, the KT Bush Band, playing pub gigs around the Lewisham area. At the
same  time she started dance and mime classes. 
</P>
<P>She now has a string of top ten hits and five huge selling albums under her
belt.  &quot;It's all thanks to Dave,&quot; says Kate, modestly. &quot;He's such
a lovely person. So  generous. So ... yummy! He did it out of love, you know. I
paid the money back, of  course, eventually - but I couldn't have done it
without his backing. For me to work  with him on this album was a real honour.&quot;

</P>
<P>Not half the honour it must have been for a gauche South London schoolgirl
to be  heard by one of the world's most respected rock guitarists. &quot;I don't
know,&quot; says  Kate. &quot;I wasn't really into Pink Floyd at the time.&quot;

</P>
<P>She wasn't really into school either. Not exactly academically thick, but &quot;the
idea  of university just loomed like a really sinister thing. I couldn't face
it. I was lucky -  something came up and took my mind off it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate would be the first to admit she has led a sheltered life. She emerged
from a  tightly-knit, middle-class family environment (mum, dad, two older
brothers - John,  a photographer, Paddy, a musician) to share her life with the
same boyfriend, bass  player and music engineer Del Palmer, for the past ten
years. 
</P>
<P>She says she was incredibly close to her father. &quot;My mother, to whom I
have  always been very close also, was a muse. But my eye was almost always on
what my  father was up to. Don't you think that, as a child, your aspirations
are out into the  world?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You take the whole domestic situation, including your mother, for
granted. Little  did I know it was mum who was holding it all together. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My relationship with Del is very stable. We work together, we live
together. It  works so well for us. That can be a very intense set-up, but I
wouldn't have it any  other way. It's all very close and direct. After ten
years, maybe we ought to be  restless, but we're not. Some say the decade
between 20 and 30 is a very telling  time in terms of human development, but I
believe that the whole of life is like that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Del and I argue a great deal - over songs. But we consider it healthy.
Who wins?  Normally, I do. I'm not the shy, retiring, fragile butterfly creature
you sometimes  read about. I'm tough as nails.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She's still rather shy and home-loving. Kate laughs openly when you call her
a  recluse, but then admits that, yes, she is happiest behind closed doors.
Preferably  those of her elegant, unostentatious South London Victorian mansion.
Beautifully  decorated, with shades of blue predominant, her home is Kate's
absolute refuge. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't go on holiday,&quot; she says. &quot;I'd rather stay at home.
I went to Jamaica once  years ago. It was a real culture shock. I went from a
dingy little London studio with  no windows to this absolute paradise. I could
barely stand it. Even the sound of the  birds was deafening. 
</P>
<P>&quot;People go on and on about me being a recluse, but it doesn't bother
me. To me,  a recluse is just someone who gets on with what they want to do. If
that's me, then  I'm happy to be one. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A large part of this business is so false, isn't it? You hear such a
lot about the  rock 'n' roll life-style, but I really don't know what that is
meant to be about any  more. The showbusiness life has simply never appealed to
me. I wasn't attracted to  the music business by the idea of wearing a black
leather mini and getting legless at  all the right parties every night. What I
wanted to do was make music. That's all I  want to do now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She makes music, she makes millions. She would be making babies had she the 
time and the immediate inclination, being a gently maternal soul, but she will
make  do with cats for now. She is kind to animals, refusing to eat or wear
them, but gives  in to a fish dish occasionally. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Once, that would have been impossible for me,&quot; she says. &quot;But
later I decided we  have not to be so hard on ourselves or other people in terms
of eating habits or  anything else. It's like me and smoking. It's such an awful
thing to do, it's so  obviously bad for us, but we gaily carry on. I've cut down
a bit, but I can't kick the  habit.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Some call Kate obsessive, claiming that her work is the most important thing
in  her life, and that everyone around her gets dragged in with her. &quot;It's
true,&quot; she  smiles. &quot;I'm obsessive about most things which take my
fancy. I'm just like that.  Once I start something, I'm committed. I just can't
put it down. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's very hard for example, to stand back from an album, allow it to
be finished  and then let people evaluate it for what it is. It's a terrifying
process for me. And  consequently making the album in the first place gets
harder and harder for me.  This one took me over two years to make, so I had
about two years `off' after the  last one. So I come back to writing completely
cold. It's like, I sing, do I? Every time  it's like I've never done it before.
Is it good enough? Is it rubbish? I've had to train  myself to listen to that
internal voice, the one I go to sleep with. I've had to learn to  believe in
myself and in my own judgement. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Most of the new songs are about relationships again. Maybe I'm saying,
&quot;If things  get rough, it's OK really.&quot; And, it takes me two years to
say that! I have to sweat  blood and shed real tears before I know I've put
everything into it. That's why I  worry that the creative process is getting
harder and more painful for me every  time. At what point will I find that I've
used it all up? That there are no more  albums left inside me?&quot; 
</P>
<P>That's a thought. What will she do then? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I'd like to make a little film. Being a movie actress is not
something I  have craved, but the right thing might tempt me. If there comes a
time when I can  only manage one album a decade, it would be good to have
something else to keep  me busy. And anyway, you learn so much just by jumping
in at the deep end.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And jump she intends to. 
</P>
<P>The article includes 5 photos: a page and a half head and shoulders shot,
one of  Kate sitting, an old photo in costume, a head shot with shawl, and one
with Del. 
</P>
<P>Be seeing you. Neil
