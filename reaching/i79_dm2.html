<P>Kate Bush at The London Palladium 
</P>
<P>by Thomson Prentice 
</P>
<P>Daily Mail - April 18, 1979 
</P>
<P> That conventional image of a girl pop star who recites her hits between 
breathless &quot;thank yous' was hurled into deserved obsolescence in this
unlikely  setting. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush lines up all the old stereotypes, mows them down and hammers them 
into their coffins with a show that is - quite literally - stunning. 
</P>
<P>This quaint, cute suburban redhead turns pop upside-down by not merely
singing  but performing songs with explosive originality. 
</P>
<P>Each number becomes a miniature play involving burlesque, ballet, and mime. 
The cast is a troupe of dancers, musicians, and magicians who paint a whole 
kaleidoscope of images. 
</P>
<P>Personally, I don't much for her records, her voice dominated with often
obtuse  lyrics is not a fulfilling enough mixture in itself. 
</P>
<P>But add an endless repertoire of special effects, props, back-screen
projections  and sound effects and the voice becomes part of an entrancing
whole. 
</P>
<P>The relentless imagery, however, sometimes engulfs the intention of the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>But what an ambitious adventure it is for a singer on her first concert tour
- and  how mediocre does she make most of her pop contemporaries seem.
