<P>From: nessus@mit-eddie.UUCP (Doug Alan) <BR> Date: Mon Aug 26 02:57:04 1985
<BR> Subject: Melody Maker 24th August 1985 (extracts) 
</P>
<P>Strange but true, the magazine that only two weeks ago told us that Kate
Bush  must have phony nipples and should be burned at the stake now tells us in
the  August 24th issue: 
</P>
<P>Just like the phoenix really. Once every two years she rises out of the
ashes to  once more bestow a touch of mysticism, a hint of myth, and a copious
supply of  inspired vision upon the burned-out landscape we call the charts. 
</P>
<P>This is the opening paragraph to a feature article on her and interview with
her.  (I'll tell you some of the interesting things that are said, soon). In
general the writer  raves about how wonderful she is. 
</P>
<P>Also, the letter section of this issue of Melody Maker is literally
half-filled with  hate mail to Helen Fitzgerald regarding her &quot;review&quot;
of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;,  including a collage of Kate shooting
Fitzgerald with her bow. (You don't mess  around with Kate Bush fans!) Three of
the four signatures are female too. 
</P>
<P>Not only that, but only two weeks after release, RUTH is at #4 on Melody 
Maker's chart! Madonna holds at #1 and #2 though. Go get 'em Kate!w Show 
Madonna and the brain-washed masses what *real* music is. 
</P>
<P>Strangely, after the initial wave (of 3) bad reviews for RUTH (none of them
on  the basis of the music! One was because, though the guy liked the music, he
didn't  like the picture sleeve! Which is laughable because the picture sleeve
is perfect for  the song! Kate is aiming a bow, which in the context of the song
and the album, is  clearly symbolic of Cupid's bow, but this is no cute little
Cupid's bow she is aiming!  This is a longbow. The kind that is used for killing
things! So the bow becomes a  symbol of a love/hate relationship. (&quot;Is
there so much hate for the ones we love?&quot;)  Just another example of how
wonderfully and perfectly thought-out everything Kate  Bush does is!) 
</P>
<P>What was I saying... Oh yeah, strangely, after the initial wave of bad
reviews for  RUTH, there have been nothing but rave reviews: Melody Maker
changed its mind  (via changing reviewers) apparently and drooled. The reviewer
for Smash Hits  reviewed it 5 times in one column! (Needless to say, he thinks
it is great! He named  it Single of The Fortnight.) &quot;No. 1&quot; said it is
&quot;fab&quot;. The reviewer for Sounds was  &quot;seduced by the sheer
strangeness&quot; of it. The Face said &quot;Not quite a solid state  symphony,
but certainly a prelude to it from this engagingly perverse songstress.&quot; 
Billboard (U.S., not British) recomends it, but strangely enough put it under
their  Black music section.... (I guess Kate's got soul!) 
</P>
<P>So, is all this really just a cruel trick they are playing on me. Right
after they  convince me that the British music press has no redeeming value and
their opinions  are worthless, they turn around and say Kate Bush is great? So
what does this mean,  if their opinions are worthless? It's too bad that I don't
like &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;  as much as some of these reviewers seem
to..... 
</P>
<P>In any case, I want to include some interesting quotes from the article /
interview  in Melody Maker. (I'd almost like the guy, except that he describes
Pink Floyd in  the article as being &quot;chronic boredom&quot;! So who is he to
be a Kate Bush fan!): 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh yes, and I've met *you* too before as well,&quot; she smiles. 
</P>
<P>I try to explain that this is not the case. Mistaken identity perhaps? I'm
damn  sure I'd remember. But she's adament. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps it was in another life,&quot; cries a whimsical voice from the
room. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she stares at me, considering the matter thoroughly. &quot;It
*must* have been  in another life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Once more she has created an album to besot and bewitch the coldest of
hearts. 
</P>
<P>Once more she has come out of her isolated refuge with the charm of a siren,
 and the innocence of a child. Ms Bush is incapable of growing old, she has
merely  grown up. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't want to produce it [&quot;Hounds of Love&quot;] in the wake
of 'The  Dreaming'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I found an inspirational new dance teacher,&quot; Kate replies with
growing  enthusiasm. &quot;The teacher's energy made me really enthusiastic
about writing again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I wanted something new, and to begin with it was extremely
difficult. All  the songs I seemed to write sounded too much like the last
album. I've never seen  any point in repeating things you've already done
before. I think it's a dangerous  thing not to search for new ways of
approaching songs. 
</P>
<P>Oh, Kate, you are tearing me asunder! The thought that have written more
songs  like those on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and are throwing them away! My
poor little heart....  Yes, everyone should grow and change, but if you've
discovered perfection, maybe it  wouldn't be such a waste to mull over it a
little more.... &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is  flawed (as everything
that's commercial is! If you are trying to compete with  Madonna, well... But
why?). Then again, if &quot;Under The Ivy&quot; is one of the directions  you
are moving in, go for it! (But why was it relegated to a single B-side and not
put  on the album?) 
</P>
<P>&quot;There are always so many voices telling me what to do that you just
can't listen  to them. All I ever do is listen to the little voices inside me. I
don't want to  disappoint the little voices that have been so good to me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Of course not. The finely-tuned songs that have made the final selection on
the  album differ greatly from the diversions of previous albums. They are all
love songs  (sigh) using elemental imagery that form a cogent and cohesive
panoply of emotion.  A search and a struggle to secure some sort of meaning. The
discovery that although  you can strip away everything from a person, there will
always be a residue of love  awaiting resurrection. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Phantasmogorical voices tilt the rose-coloured world off its trite axis with
jagged  eerie phrases. Outside observations are slanted metaphors revealing
states of mind.  No longer are we presented with the eclectic collage of &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; whose  continual shifts and spirals allowed an escape with
diversity. No longer is the entire  history of Houdini crammed into three
minutes, until a new fable takes up the torch.  Now the texture is more subtle,
the production more adroit, and the mesmerism  unrelenting. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The last album contained a lot of different energies. It did take
people to lots of  different places very quickly and some people found that
difficult to take. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think this album has more of a positive energy. It's a great deal
more  optimistic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>The album is divided into two sections, the A-side and the B-side. The
A-side is  entitled &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; and the B-side is entitled &quot;The
Ninth Wave&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Regarding &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's about someone who comes off a ship and they've been in the water
all night  by themselves, and it's about that person re-evaluating their life
from a point which  they've never been before. It's about waking up from things
and being reborn  --going through something and coming out the other side very
different.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't really know why people think my songs are strange. Perhaps
because I  bath in goat's milk!! It's not something you should really ask me. My
mum could  probably help you more. It's probably something to do with my
childhood.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I would want to be Breugal, definitely&quot;. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;His work is so real, and yet depicted in a fantastic way. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's so beautiful and elemental. And his faces are *so* haunting.&quot;

</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;My most striking visions of reality always seem to come to me when I'm
in such  a strange situation I feel 'this isn't real'. It's very simple really.
Simplicity is a thing  few people dare to go for. They think it's too easy. In
fact, it's the hardest thing to  do. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I like the hypnotic quality of nursery rhyme repetition. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A lot of traditional music has that as a basis -- that something
tumbling, rolling,  droning throughout the piece. It's very primeval really.
Getting back to when we  were creatures of the earth rather than cement. 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure we'll see each other again very soon.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yes Kate I'm sure we will. I hope we will. Probably in another life. 
</P>
<P>We exited, floating through the nearest wall. 
</P>
<P>So, Mu, what does it all mean? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ooh I remember 
</P>
<P>That rich windy weather&quot;
