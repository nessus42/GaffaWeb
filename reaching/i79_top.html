<P><STRONG>This Bush Is At The Top Of The Tree!</STRONG></P>
<P>There's no doubt about it...1978 was really a cracker of a  year for Kate
Bush, the doctor's daughter from Kent.</P>
<P>At the tender age of 19, the strikingly good looking red-haired  Kate shot
to stardom in a most amazing manner, surprising  probably even the record
people, who were behind the  tremendous promotional build-up of her singing
career.</P>
<P>One minute she was an unknown, likeable girl. The next, she  was being
hailed as a star. And the nice thing is, she still  remains as likeable as ever.</P>
<P>But there is no doubt the girl has changed, as far as her career  and her
performances are concerned.</P>
<P>It was that one haunting song, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;  which launched
her -- and catapulted her to instant stardom. </P>
<P>She first hit the charts in January 1978 with her strange debut  single. The
record was inpsired by Emily Bronte's famous novel,  and went to No. 1 and
stayed there for several weeks.</P>
<P>Her first album followed fairly quickly. Titled <EM>The Kick Inside</EM>,
it was  a collection of her own cleverly-penned and original songs. And  this,
more than anything else, emphasised not only Kate's unusual  vocal range, but
also her unique presentation of music and the  wide emotional depths of the
lyrics to her songs.</P>
<P>Once launched, there was no stopping the girl. Her record success  continued
with &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes,&quot;  which went into the Top 5
in the charts, and then her second album, 
<EM>Lionheart</EM>, quickly earned her a gold disc after jetting into the 
charts on its first week of release.</P>
<P>She has been referred to as having the fragile beauty of a gazelle.  It is
her stunning looks which undoubtedly add greatly to her  vocal performances,
putting Kate in a completely different  category from most other girl singers.</P>
<P>She studied, at one time, under the master of mime and dance,  Lindsay Kemp,
and this comes through vividly in most of her  on-stage performances.</P>
<P>She has a great feeling for the dramatic effect of a song, not only  vocally
but physically, as well.</P>
<P>As a child, Kate was encouraged by her parents and family as  to the values
of self-expression. By the time she was eleven,  she had taught herself to play
the piano and had written her  first songs.</P>
<P>When she was 16, she met David Gilmour, of the Pink Floyd group,  and with
his help made her first demo disc. She was signed up on  a recording contract by
EMI soon afterwards.</P>
<P>But she was always more interested in writing songs than singing  them, she
admits. As well as incorporating a great deal of mime  into her act, she likes
to fit in a jigsaw of music, poetry and  movement, so that her audiences can
relate to her songs on  more than one level.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm extremely nervous about stage performances,&quot;  says Kate. &quot;I've
always been slightly worried about my  capabilities. When I appeared in pubs,
singing, before I was  well-known, that was fine. But now, people will expect a 
certain standard of performance from me.&quot;</P>
<P>Her fantastic year of success has been based purely on her  success in the
recording studios. It has taken her a long time  to pluck up the courage to
build up her act and go out on the  road with a stage show.</P>
<P>Her first British tour, in the Spring of 1979, meant her stage  debut at the
London Palladium, in April.</P>
<P>It has been said, too, that Kate has worked very hard at creating  a public
image. At times, she talks in a strage slangy accent --   which is, quite
clearly, contradictory to her smooth middle-class  upbringing.</P>
<P>&quot;We always encouraged Kate to write songs, but we never  thought for a
minute it would all turn out as it has done,&quot;  says Kate's mother, who is
still very obviously surprised at her  daughter's tremendous success.</P>
<P>Says Kate: &quot;I recall that when I was in the school choir,  I couldn't
sing high notes at all. I had to teach myself, as a sort  of exercise.&quot;</P>
<P>Over the years, she has also become a highly accomplished  dancer.</P>
<P>Last year, her record success led to her name spreading around  the world.
Kate's records sold not only throughout Europe but in  Japan, Australia, Canada
and South Africa.</P>
<P>As well as picking up the Tokyo Music Festical silver prize, and  the
coveted Dutch Editon Award, she rounded off 1978 by being  voted the world's top
female singer in a poll by 'Melody Maker'  readers.</P>
<P>So it's not surprising that Kate figured heavily in the British Rock  and
Pop Awards.</P>
