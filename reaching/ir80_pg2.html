<h3>The Second Paul Gambaccini Radio Programme</h3>

<p>[Here is the second of Kate's radio interviews with Paul
Gambaccini. This programme, aired on BBC One Radio on December 31,
1980, features a selection of Kate's favourite &quot;popular&quot; recordings by
other artists. Transcribed from a tape by Andrew Marvick.]</p>

<p>
Thank you, Newsbeat team.

<p>
This is Paul Gambaccini, and we are with Kate Bush on this New
Year's Eve. Hello, Kate.

<p>
&quot;Hi.&quot;

<p>
You've made it back from last night.

<p>
&quot;Yes, I have, thank you.&quot;

<p>
Now we'll be playing some of your favourite popular songs.
Let's begin straight away with Roy Harper's Another Day.

<p>
[The recording is heard. Kate had already recorded at least two
versions of this song as a duet with Peter Gabriel by this time. The
first version was recorded for Kate's own BBC television special, which
aired in December of 1979; the second was undertaken several months
later in the studios with the hope of a single release. A b-side
co-written by Kate and Gabriel was even recorded to this end, but the
project was unfortunately abandoned. Kate also contributed vocals on a
song from Roy Harper's 1980 album The Unknown Soldier.]

<p>
Roy Harper, and a song called Another Day. Kate, if I were asked
to choose a quintessentially English track, I would choose a Roy Harper
one: When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease. And, uh, I'm wondering if
you consider him a typically English artist.

<p>
&quot;Yes, uh, I think that's a very good point. I think he is a very
English poet. I mean, I think Roy is a poet, I really do. And that one
particular song is classic. Uh, It's funny you should mention Cricketer
Leaves the Crease, because for me that's the other all-time classic,
and it was a matter of choosing between the two, for me. Um, this track
is incredible. In fact, I asked Roy what he wrote the song about, and
he said the whole thing is true. It's a completely true story about a
lady he'd met, and who he really loved, and he was after her. And she
kept putting her nose in the air and running away from him. Then he met
her a few years later, and suddenly realised that she was chasing him,
and he saw the irony of the situation, and wrote this song about the
rooms that the'd been in together. It's a very personal song, and I
think that's why it works so strongly. It's a very emotional, intimate
song.&quot;

<p>
If I may ask a crass question after such an intimate song: An
artist like yourself has enjoyed success in a commercial sense quite
early in her career. How do you relate to an artist like Roy, who has
the respect of his peers but who has never really broken through
commercially?

<p>
&quot;I think it's tragic, I really do. Um, one of the main reasons
that I've chosen these tracks, and the ones from last night, is that
I'm choosing people--deliberately--not like Bowie, Pink Floyd, who are
people I love very much. All the big, famous artists, I really love a
lot of them. I deliberately chose people who I think are very
underestimated, who aren't really recognised as the great talent that
they are. And for me, Roy is one of the greatest English songwriters
we've had, and people just don't realise it. And I really think that
when they do we're going to have another top songwriter up there. He's
brilliant.&quot;

<p>
Well, here's certainly one of the all-time cult figures: Captain
Beefheart, and his Magic Band. Uh, here's a man who for over a decade
has been making music which some people have been absolutely raving
about, and yet he's never broken through to mass acceptance.

<p>
&quot;Yes. Again, I think, um, he's [laughs], he's such an obvious
person to be big here. When you look at a lot of the new wave groups
and the punk groups, they're really nothing compared to Beefheart. He's
the original. And for me he's a, a natural poet. I mean, he's
incredible. Um, I've heard a beautiful quote of his. When he was
backstage one day, um, there was someone hanging around who he didn't
want to be there; and he told them to get out. And when the someone
said why didn't you want me here? he said he's had too much to think.

<p>
And if I may just quote a couple of lines from one of his songs
called Bat Chain Puller. It's about a Voodoo train. Um, his poetry's
incredible. It says: 'A chain with yellow lights that glisten like
oil-beads;' and another line: 'It whistles like a root snatched from
the dry earth. Sod-busting rakes with grey-dust claws announces it's
coming in the morning.' [inaudible]...is a poet. Then listen out for
the line in this song, which is called Tropical Hot Dog Night, and it's
'Like two flamingos in a fruit fight.'&quot;

<p>
[The song is played.]

<p>
Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, and Tropical Hot Dog Night.
Kate, I--I think I would like to stash that one. Maybe it's the New
Year's party I'm going to tonight.

<p>
&quot;Let's play it again right now and get up on the table!&quot;

<p>
[Laughing]
Are--are you going to go to a New Year's Eve party, do
you think?

<p>
&quot;Um, well, I might do. It depends on if I'm--if I get home in time
tonight.&quot;

<p>
Oh, that's right, well...

<p>
&quot;We could have a drink here and then get up on the table!
[Laughs]

<p>
Oh, yeah, we could have a lot of fun after this show! Yes, this is
the show during 1980 when you have the most fun afterwards.

<p>
&quot;[Laughs]&quot;

<p>
We're coming up now on one of Kate's favourite songs of all time.
Ladies and gentlemen, this could be the only show in history to feature
both Frank Zappa and Rolf Harris.

<p>
&quot;[Giggle from Kate.]&quot;

<p>
And I remember, I remember hearing this song on the radio in
America in the Sixties. Did you hear it on the radio or from a copy at
home?

<p>
&quot;Um, from the radio but very much a copy at home, too, a
forty-five. I don't know whose it was. Uh, I think it's the
most fantastic track, I really do. I don't think there's anything being
done like it since then, and I, uh, I wish Rolf would, uh, do some more
musical ventures. I think it's fantastic. I mean to be the discoverer
of the wobble-board, and to be able to play the dijeridu, and sing and
write and draw. He's a very talented man, he really is. And I think
he's very underestimated because of the areas he's got into now. He's a
sort of top television personality. But it seems to me he's got a great
deal of musical talent, and for me this track is just magic. It's
just...Oh...&quot;

<p>
In the early Sixties Sun Arise was a very experimental sound.

<p>
[The record is played. It is immediately obvious how direct and
heavy was the influence of this recording upon Kate's track, The
Dreaming. Not only the rhythmic pulse and instrumentation, but even the
unusual use of a major-key tune that avoids resolution in the tonic,
using instead a single, unchanging dijeridu drone; as well as the use
of the vocal lines as a group of peculiar instruments--all these
qualities are echoed, even reproduced in Kate's track.]

<p>
I was just thinking if John Peel had an experimental radio
programme then as he does now, he would have been playing that Rolf
Harris song.

<p>
&quot;[Laughing] Maybe he would. I wonder what he'd say about that.&quot;

<p>
Just shows you how some artists do change in their career
direction.

<p>
&quot;Absolutely.&quot;

<p>
Sun Arise, that track by Rolf Harris.

<p>
An interesting comment is that, uh, apparently Alice Cooper has
since done a version of Sun Arise. I've no idea what it sounds like,
I've not heard it, but, um, it's an interesting thought.&quot;

<p>
Hm, one to drag out for sure.

<p>
This is Radio One, on New Year's Eve. And we're playing Kate
Bush's favourite songs of all time, and here's one by John Lennon, who
was killed in the most apalling way earlier this month, and Kate I'm
wondering if you are too young at the age of twenty-two to have fully
understood what all of the media fuss was about. So many people were
affected so traumatically for so long. Could you really understand what
Lennon and the Beatles meant to them?

<p>
&quot;Yes, absolutely! I think probably people of about sixteen or
seventeen, that's the age where it wouldn't really mean that much. But
even at my age they really meant so much. I wasn't aware of them first
happening and then being the 'new thing'. But I was aware of them as
the most incredible source, and of Lennon being the most fantastic
songwriter. He really was one of my favourite artists--not as The
Beatles, but as Lennon. And in fact, in compiling this list a couple of
months ago before the news, I'd chosen this track as one of my
favourites. So it wasn't meant as a tribute, it was genuinely planned
as one of the tracks.&quot;

<p>
Why this of all his songs?

<p>
&quot;Um, for me it's just magic. Um, his voice; the production--it's
the most incredible production; uh, little backwards voices. They're
really things that I love. And just, the song and everything--it's
wonderful. And I--I'm really sad, because he's left the biggest hole in
the business that we've known yet, I think.&quot;

<p>
Here's John Lennon's Number Nine Dream.

<p>
[The record is played. In my opinion there is no single record
that Kate's music reflects the influence of more clearly than this
track. All references to Peter Gabriel's influence--even as regards
production--pale beside a comparative listening between Number Nine
Dream and any of a dozen of Kate's recordings.]

<p>
One of the dozen or so most important human beings of my lifetime
so far: John Lennon and Number Nine Dream. We're playing the favourite
records of Kate Bush on this New Year's Eve, and Kate, I have to admit:
you've stumped me. I don't know our next artist.

<p>
&quot;Well, his name's Eberhard Weber. Veh-ber-- [in heavy German
accent:] Eberhard Weber. And he's German. And he's a fantastic fretless
bass-player. He' got his own solo albums, and he works beautifully with
glockenspiel, vibes, uh, vocal pieces. And uh, it's very spacey, um,
jazz-rocky. But what I like about him is always there's Jaco Pastorius,
Stanley Clarke, they're right up at the top with all the big bass
players, but again there're lots of very talented people that aren't
that well known. So I'd like to give him a bit of exposure. And this is
off the album called Fluid Rustle. And the track's called Quiet
Departures.

<p>
[An excerpt from the track is played.]

<p>
Quiet Departures by Eberhard Weber, from the album Fluid Rustle.
Kate, does music like that influence you as well as entertain you?

<p>
&quot;Oh, absolutely. I really feel that anything that I see, read,
listen to, feel, eat, etcetera, is an influence. Because anything you
like you're going to have an automatic attraction and want for. And so
even subconsciously you, um, you use it, somehow it gets in there.&quot;

<p>
Well if that's the case let's, uh, throw you a hard one here and
ask you a question you haven't prepared for. What books have inspired
you?

<p>
&quot;What books? Well, my problem with books is that I used to read a
lot more than I do now, and so I think my book inspiration is now
coming from television, films, newspapers--you know, all the modern
media. But I really do think that all the books I've read have had a
tremendous influence on me because of their strong imagery. I think
books really are a fantastic form of inspiration.&quot;

<p>
Well here's a man who grew popular with his images and his
unusual voice, 'cause in the selections you played both last time
and today I know you love the use of the human voice as an instrument.
The man I'm talking about is Donovan.

<p>
&quot;Yeah, Donovan has got the most beautiful voice--that very slow
vibrato that people like Cliff Richard can put on; but [Donovan] has it
very naturally. I mean he sings like this all the time. And again, he's
an incredible songwriter, lyric writer, he can play the guitar and he
has that fantastic voice. And it seemed that he'd got really caught up
in the copying of Dylan when he first signed up and was singing. And he
was wearing the hats and he was carrying the guitar and everyone
thought he was just a Dylan copy. When in fact he wasn't at all. And it
seems that he's just, um, been forgotten, he's gone under.&quot;

<p>
It's unbelievable. He was one of Britain's leading, hit-making
solo stars of the Sixties and a great international artist. And now
it's almost as though he'd never existed.

<p>
&quot;It's ridiculous. I can't stand to see that happen to people,
especially someone like him. Um, one of my favourite albums of his is
H.M.S. Donovan-- which I think has been deleted now, which is even more
ridiculous. And it's beautiful: fantastic illustrated cover; a double
album, and each song is either a fairy story or something he's written
to other people's words. He's used Blake's poems, he's used some Lewis
Carroll--a big selection of fantasy stuff. And one of my favourite
tracks from there, which he actually wrote himself to his own music, is
Lord of the Reedy River.

<P>
[ The record is played. Donovan actually performed this song well
before recording it for H.M.S. Donovan. He appears in the 1968 film If
It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium, singing this song to his own guitar
accompaniment. Of course, Kate herself recorded this song, and put it
out as the b-side of the Sat In Your Lap single in 1981. A rumour
persists that Donovan actually contributed a bit of backing vocal on
Kate's track, though this has not been confirmed.]

<p>
Donovan, and Lord of the Reedy River. I suppose--

<p>
&quot;...so beautiful...&quot;

<p>
--all it would take would be one or two really good tracks and--

<p>
&quot;Ah, but he's got them, you know, that's the silly thing, he's got
so many good tracks. I think that song there too, is so essential
and erotic. And you know no-one's even heard of it--incredible. I mean
if you put a bit of film to that...what a fantastic...&quot;

<p>
Most people don't realise that most of his hit records were
produced by Mickie Most.

<p>
&quot;I didn't realise that either, no.&quot;

<p>
There's another track of his that you like alot, a b-side.

<p>
&quot;Yes. Uh, it was the b-side of [indecipherable], called Mr. Wind
[I am unsure that this is what she says here]. What I liked about it
was he was using 'Vari-Speed', Um, he was using very low voices and
very high voices [Kate imitates these--precious audio unfortunately not
transcribable] all mixed in together: Mr. Wind spoke like this! And all
the people that he woke up in the morning spoke like this! [Laughs] And
it was beautiful; it was just a really fun track putting a different
speed to the voices of the various characters. And it was really
fabulous for kids, uh, you know? I...I wish there
had been more.&quot;

<p>
Let's come right up to date now, with an album currently in the
charts: Steely Dan, Gaucho LP, and from it, Babylon Sisters.

<p>
[Part of this record is played. Then Kate comes back on,
announcing in a surprising, very uncharacteristic imitation of an
American accent (perhaps prompted by Steely Dan's music, which she has
elsewhere described as quintessentially American):]

<p>
&quot;Hi, everybody! This is Radio Fun, and I'm here with Paul
Dictionary and with him, Miss Bush.&quot;

<p>
[Laughing] And--and we have just heard Steely Dan from their
Gaucho LP, and Babylon Sisters. Now, Kate, this brings us right up to
date, 'cause this is an album that's out right at the moment. And this
is a, a funky little track by these two chaps, Becker and Fagin. And
they're monstrous stars in America--not so here.

<p>
&quot;No, that's uh, again why I played them. I think they're very
underestimated. They're the most incredible musicians. This is it. They
are here--a musician's band. I mean, all the musicians in this country
just rave about them technically, and uh, as songwriters. But you know,
they're not really played on the radio, but they're just
incredible--really good jazz [indecipherable].&quot;

<p>
Kate, if we go beyond the current charts and look beyond this
program and beyond the parties we'll be attending tonight, into 1981,
what are your immediate plans?

<p>
&quot;Well, my immediate plans now are to make another album. That's
what I've been doing the last couple of months: writing, too, and
trying to demo. It's been a really good time for me, actually. I love
writing. That's the thing I'd like to do all the time.&quot;

<p>
As you have had three LPs, do you find that the songs come
quicker, or they kind of take longer?

<p>
&quot;It definitely goes in phases. And I find that if I'm not busy
working on something else, then the songs are going to flow in much
easier. There does seem to be a, a brain--sort of cooperation thing. If
it's busy working on something else then it won't allow me to use up
the back bit for a song [laughing]! But if it's vacant, then I can fill
it up!&quot;

<p>
Do you ever think you'll do anything with Peter Gabriel again?

<p>
&quot;I hope so, yes. Uh, we're trying to work on something at the
moment, but uh, it's quite hard to get all the business uh, through,
but I hope that will happen. He's great to work with.&quot;

<p>
He worked with our next act, didn't he?

<p>
&quot;Yes, he did. It's a very strange coincidence. Uh, because I
saw him the other day, and just mentioned if he'd heard of Jules and
the Polar Bears--which is uh, one of the next tracks we're playing. And
he said yes, he had because he was producing their live EP, and he sent
it on a couple of days later. It's very good.

<p>
&quot;And the track that I've chosen is called The Smell of Home. And
it's off an album called Phonetics. Which is very interesting, because
all the lyrics on the lyric sheet they've actually written
pho-net-i-cal-ly! So you can try to read the words, and it's uh, all in
phonetics. And I think they're great. I've never heard of them in this
country. They've not been played on the radio, as far as I know.
And they're great--he's got an incredible voice, the lead singer.&quot;

<p>
Well, I think, I have been played in the evening--

<p>
&quot;They have?&quot;

<p>
--but not so much during the day, really.

<p>
&quot;No, I've not heard them getting enough recognition anyway.&quot;

<p>
Well, let's hear them in one of their earliest time slots:
Jules and the Polar Bears, The Smell of Home.

<p>
[This record is played.]

<p>
The Smell of Home, by Jules and the Polar Bears, one of Kate
Bush's all-time favourite tracks. Kate, the time has now come for me to
spring on you that question: What is your all-time favourite single?

<p>
&quot;My all-time favourite single. Very, very difficult question, it
really is, because just, just trying to compare songs, you know, let
alone trying to put one higher than all the others...I think I would
say at this point in time John Lennon's Number Nine Dream-- for lots of
reasons.&quot;

<p>
We will close with an artist who has had a long career beginning
in the late Sixties, when Lennon as part of the Beatles was so popular.
I'm talking about Frank Zappa, in those days with the Mothers of
Invention, and in the Seventies doing a series of bizarre LPs on his
own. And one of these has particularly tickled your fancy.

<p>
&quot;Yes. Uh, I think Zappa's great, and one of my favourite albums is
Bongo Fury, where he and Beefheart are together, so we've got two
loonies on one album. It's wonderful, so exciting. And the track
I've chosen is Montana, off of Overnight Sensation. For me this is one
of Zappa's more commercial albums: uh, more instant songs, but at the
same time very versatile. I really do hold it as one of my favourite
albums. And the track's called Montana.

<p>
[The record is played.]

<p>
I still like We're the Brain Police, myself. That's my favourite
by Frank Zappa. That one's called Montana, and that is Kate's
favourite.

<p>
Kate, many people would like to know if they will be able to see
you in live performance again in 1981. Do you think that's a
possibility?

<p>
&quot;It is a possibility, but I wouldn't like to say any more than
that, 'cause, uh, you know, things take so much time. It's incredible.
Uh, the album is the thing that I've decided that's happening, and
we'll see what happens after that's out of the way!&quot;

<p>
Have you enjoyed 1980?

<p>
&quot;Um...Yes, on the whole, but I think, to be quite honest, it's
been a really hard year, and I think so many people will be glad when
it's over. It's been a very testing year. In many ways it's almost been
saying 'All right, let's see if you can get through this, and if you
can then one up to you.' And I think an awful lot of people have really
coped with this year coped with this year fantastically well. So, uh,
here's to them, and here's to 1981!&quot;

<p>
Reason to celebrate.

<p>
&quot;Yeah!&quot;

<p>
O.K., we'll do that right now! Uh, but Radio One continues, first
of all with Mailbag and then with other programs to help you see in the
brand new year.

<p>
Thank you, Kate Bush.

<p>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

<p>
And thank you, folks, for listening.

<p>
Right now it's six-thirty, and here's the news.
