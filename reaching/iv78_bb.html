<P>Date: Wed, 11 Oct 1995 10:07:19 -0100 <BR> From: Wieland Willker &lt;willker@chemie.uni-bremen.de&gt;
<BR> Subject: 3SAT epilogue: Bio's Bahnhof 
</P>
<P>For the linguistic talents: 
</P>
<P>Kate on Bios Bahnhof 
</P>
<P>a translation of the German conversation: 
</P>
<P>B: Kate! Hallo! <BR>    Kate you are great! <BR>    It's even a rhyme:
Kate you are great! 
</P>
<P>   (To a woman in the audience:)     Mylady, you helped me out a little
while ago, can you help me once     again? <BR>    I have no flowers, maybe you
can give me... <BR>    Yes, that's great. So. You're not only a great
music-stand, but also an     excellent flowergirl (Rosenfrau). Kate... <BR> K:
Thank you.. very much, thank you.   <BR> B: Thank YOU! <BR>    Ladies and
gentlemen, isn't she a talent? And in 10 years, maybe in 5, maybe  already in 2,
she will perform in New York, in the Carnegie-Hall, in the Madison  Square
Garden. 15.000 people will go mad. And then she is going to say: Pssst! All 
people will calm down. Do not forget: My very beginning was in the &quot;Depot
der  Koeln-Frechen-Benzelrather Eisenbahn&quot;&lt;a disused railway
station/deposit&gt; 
</P>
<P>(applause) 
</P>
<P>B: The poor didn't get anything. 
</P>
<P>(to Kate, now really in English!:) When you will be very big, and I know you
will,  you will apear in a big hall and you will say: Never forget: My begin was
in the  Depot... 
</P>
<P>Can you say that? 
</P>
<P>K: Ooooh, God, say it... 
</P>
<P>B: (repeating the words) 
</P>
<P>K: (rolling her eyes)                &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I LOVE that!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

</P>
<P>   Koeln-Frechen-Eichenberger... 
</P>
<P>B: Do you know any word in german? 
</P>
<P>K: Nein! 
</P>
<P>B: Nein, - you should learn &quot;Ja&quot;, that's better. 
</P>
<P>   Thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>END 
</P>
<P>IMHO Alfred Biolek is a very nice guy. He has still several shows on German
TV.  We all have to acknowledge his far-sight and this very early realization of
Kate's  genius. Thank YOU, Alfred!
