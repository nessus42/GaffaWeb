(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: &quot;Looking Good/Feeling Fit&quot; U.K. TV,
August 6, 1981 
</P>
<P>55. Looking Good, Feeling Fit: Kate is interviewed during rehearsals for the
Sat  In Your Lap choreography, U.K. TV, August 6, 1981. 
</P>
<P>This clip features an appallingly silly interviewer, but is nevertheless
extremely  interesting for its shots of Kate in rehearsal for an early version
of the choreography  for Sat In Your Lap. About thirty seconds of the rhythm and
background tracks  (without lead vocals or instrumentation) from the song can be
heard; and Kate's  execution of the dance moves is very impressive. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED] 
</P>
<P>[Scene of Kate rehearsing] 
</P>
<P>I: Kate and her two dancers, Stewart Arnold and Gary Hurst, must have gone 
through this routine while we filmed it from different angles and each time it 
was as full of energy and each time it got more tiring to watch. 
</P>
<P>K: Alright lets take it from the top. 
</P>
<P>[More rehearsing.] 
</P>
<P>I: Now, to come to the obvious question, why are you wearing rubber
trousers? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] Well, they're not quite rubber, I think they're some kind of
nylon. And  the idea, as with leg warmers, you wear them to keep your muscles
warm,  because when you work your muscles you can pull them much easily [sic],
and  just things can go wrong easier because you're working them. So, to keep
them  warm... 
</P>
<P>I: So they're not sorta stretch-and-lose-weight? 
</P>
<P>K: No, it keeps your muscles loose all the time so you're less likely to
pull or  damage yourself. 
</P>
<P>I: There must be a lot of stress on tour and a lot of pressure, do you do
yoga and  things? 
</P>
<P>K: No, I don't. I have considered doing that, especially recently, just
cause I can't get  any sleep. There's just not enough time in the day to do
everything. And I have  thought of TM, just seems to be the one that everyone
considers the way to get  over sleep, but I haven't had the time. 
</P>
<P>I: At the moment you relax by keeping going. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! 
</P>
<P>[More rehearsal] 
</P>
<P>I: Now, in the music world there's a lot of late nights, high living and
things, and yet  you do not have pimples, spots... 
</P>
<P>K: [points at face and whispers] pimples. 
</P>
<P>I:.. and all the things that the rest of us get if we stay out late at
night, how do you  manage that? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I do. I do get pimples and things, but luckily I've found some
creams and  things that are incredibly good for my skin and I use them morning
and night and  I seem to be okay. But I do get spots, everyone gets spots. And I
think, you know,  being a female, the most important thing is to get the makeup
off, cause that can  really ruin your skin. So just try to get that, and have a
good time! 
</P>
<P>I: Is it, wash and wash and wash? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, not wash and wash... 
</P>
<P>I: How do you mean, have a good time? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, you could have a good time. If you're worry, then your skin shows
that  you're very worried, I think, everyone knows that. Have a good time,
that's  what it's for isn't it, life. 
</P>
<P>I: You obviously enjoy yourself and you're obviously very happy... 
</P>
<P>K: I am. 
</P>
<P>I: ...do you think that is why you're a healthy person? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think I'm a healthy person. You see, I dance because I want to
dance, not  'cause I want to keep fit. And it's just a sort of side thing that I
happen to keep  fit at the same time. I really like what I do and that that's
what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>[More rehearsals]

Ron's Interviews 
</P>
<P>Vickie here, thanks Ron, for transcribing some of my favorite interviews
lately.  The Friday Night, Saturday Morning especially, and just now... 
</P>
<P> Looking Good, Feeling Fit is a favorite because 1) the sequences with Kate
and  her dancers are *fantastic* and 2) she gets peeved with the interviewer and
acts  clearly impatient with his stupid comments. 
</P>
<P> Razmatazz a very interesting interview, but this is one that should be
*seen*  because 1) Kate is at her most beautiful and 2) she shows the kids so
many  interesting items, such as the storyboards she drew. 
</P>
<P>Old Grey Whistle Test another favorite that combines a beautiful Kate with
dippy  interviewers (Chris and I call them the &quot;Twit Twins&quot;) and,
though Kate stays at the  height of politeness, she manages to get in a few
subtle zingers of her own at these  two dorks. For instance: 
</P>
<P>At this... 
</P>
<P>I1: What is a dijeridu, what does it look like? 
</P>
<P>Kate, so softly you can hardly hear it unless you listen closely and turn
the volume  up, repeats &quot;What is a dijeridu?&quot; with an inflection that
suggests a thought pattern  something along the lines of &quot;You didn't do
your homework?&quot; and it's quite obvious  from her tone of voice that she's
making fun of him. Now, of course, she would  have no problems with someone
asking her that question and she answers it with  care, to make people really
understand the fascinating instrument and the complex  way of playing that is
required. In other words, she's making fun of *him*, not at  anyone else who
might not know what a dijeridu is. It's just so halarious! Her  expressions are
great. She *knows* she's being interviewed by cretins, and *you*  know that she
knows it. I love it! 
</P>
<P>The next time she was interviewed by one of these twits though she wasn't in
a  playful mood like the first time. She's obviously hostile (very subtle, but
you can tell  she's not in a mood to put up with any foolishness) in the second
interview. I  assume IED has provided Ron (or will) with that one, from the HoL
era. 
</P>
