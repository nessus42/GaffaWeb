<P>The London Observer<BR> November 12, 1978</P>
<H3>                 Bull and Bush</H3>
<P>KATE BUSH has the fragile beauty of a gazelle,  is 20 years old and a star.
EMI, her recording company, are well aware of this and last week  jetted her out
to a sixteenth century castle, the  Ammersoyen Kasteel, near Amsterdam, for the 
launch of her new album <EM>Lionheart</EM>.</P>
<P>The next day a private jet zoomed her back to  London for a buffet reception
where she was  given the 'Melody Maker' Readers' award for the best female
singer of the year and most  outstanding hope for the future, ousting the  likes
of Elkie Brooks, Joni Mitchell and Patti Smith in the process.</P>
<P>Her first album, <EM>The Kick Inside</EM>, was a top-seller across Europe
this year and her first single, &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; was top of the
charts here for a month.</P>
<P>Most people think of her as the girl 'with the  high voice.' It flutes and
trills and swoops like  some canary scared stiff on a perpetual  big dipper.
'Actually, when I was in the school  choir l couldn't sing high notes at all. I
taught  myself as a sort of exercise.'</P>
<P>Her other great distinguishing feature is that she  has become a highly
accomplished vampish dancer. Her promotional films for television  consumption
make your average variety show  production number look  like the Clodhoppers'
Ball.</P>
<P>These skills have made it possible for EMI to  promote their near-child
wonder without the hazards of extensive concert tours. Indeed,  she hasn't
performed in this country since  she was 16, when a few pub appearances  led
Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour to  introduce her to the record company.</P>
<P>'Incredible, 'amazing,' phenomenal,' she says,  with the accent of a soap
opera shopgirl (which,  like much of her effect is contrived: her mum and dad
are impeccably middle class), when asked  about her success and how it takes
her.</P>
<P>No one seems able to decide whether she's a  genuine innocent, or a pretty
hard nosed cookie.  Her face can appear angelic, or throw out a look to give
Lady MacBeth the odd shiver.</P>
<P>She shows no side, yet takes to being swanned  about in Rolls Royces as a
duck to water. In the middle of it all it's easy to forget that she can write 
very good songs. Young she may be; lacking in self- possession she is not.</P>
