<P>The Story of A Musical Misfit: Kate Bush 
</P>
<P> Pat Thomas goes walkabout in the Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>[Edited by Andrew Marvick.] 
</P>
<P> In the days when the Boomtown Rats actually had something to contribute to 
popular music and Bobby Geldof's aspirations were to feed his own basic desires 
rather than the world, a strange sort of foil to the new wave movement emerged
in  the shape of a doctor's doctor from Plumstead in Kent. 
</P>
<P>She was Kate Bush, and in the late 'seventies she and Bob used to sweep the 
boards at the then prestigious Melody Maker Readers' Poll awards. They stood 
together like chalk and cheese, but Geldof, not usually known for heaping praise
on  other performers, thought Kate was ace. 
</P>
<P>Kate, whose first single, Wuthering Heights, took her to number one in 1978,
 couldn't have been more flattered by the chief Rat's praise, especially since
she  thought the Boomtown Rats were, well, amazing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't think they'd be into me. With really beautiful punk groups
like that,  and the Stranglers, too, I wonder if they think I'm...not so much
square, but  whether they think maybe I'm oblong.&quot; 
</P>
<P>At the time it seemed like a typically Kate Bush thing to say. But actually,
it's  quite a perceptive statement. In the context of the new wave, Kate Bush
was rather  oblong, a sort of flower floating on a sea of muck. 
</P>
<P>She was born July 30, 1958, and by the time she was sixteen she had pocketed
a  3,000-Pound advance and an EMI recording contract. Mindful of her age, and
since  they probably had no idea what to do with her anyway, EMI kept her &quot;under
 wraps&quot;, studying dance, music and mime, and writing songs, for just over
two years. 
</P>
<P>The advance, plus an inheritance left to her by an aunt, made sure that from
the  moment she left school, with ten &quot;O-levels&quot;, she would never have
to cope with the  same worries that most sixteen-year-olds have about finding a
job. Also, by the time  her first LP came out, her parents had set her and her
two brothers up in a  three-story house (one floor each) in Lewisham--so her
independence was assured  from an early age. 
</P>
<P>Although music was an option, it wasn't really first choice. She really
wanted to  be either a psychiatrist or a social worker. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I never thought of music seriously as a career, because it's so
difficult to make  it. It's all a matter of timing, contracts and talent--and
luck. I deliberately tried to  have a career-orientated ambition, something I
could hold onto.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But as luck would have it, she was so bad at physics, chemistry and maths
that  music won almost by default. &lt;This statement conveys a false causality.
Kate's choice  of a career in music was already well underway by the time she
returned to school  briefly to take her &quot;mock A-levels&quot;.&gt; So she
began writing songs in her bedroom,  never daring to let anyone hear the
results. &lt;Kate had in fact been writing songs  since the age of eleven. There
was in fact no connection between Kate's discovery of  her vocation as an artist
and her performance in the sciences.&gt; Eventually, though, a  family friend,
Ricky Hopper, heard her tapes and tried to flog them to the record  industry.
The industry, true to form, was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>Ricky decided to get in touch with his old pal from Cambridge, Dave &quot;Pink
Floyd&quot;  Gilmour. Gilmour gave Kate some studio time to do proper demo
tapes, introduced  her to a producer--Andrew Powell--and eventually persuaded
his record  company--EMI--to give her a contract. Without wishing to sound too
glib, from  there on in it was plain sailing. 
</P>
<P>Kate comes from a musical family who enjoyed a passion for traditional
English  and Irish music. Indeed, to this day, Kate's brother Paddy plays in her
band. In the  early days, though, she sang in his band, the K. T. Bush Band. &lt;Although
Brian Bath  and Vic King were evidently friends of Paddy's and had been playing
with him for a  time before Kate joined in, it's safe to assume that the band's
name did not  pre-date Kate's involvement.&gt; As Pete Silverton at Sounds
wrote: 
</P>
<P>&quot;She talked about that period as though it were a part of a fondly
remembered  but long lost childhood. Her affection for it, for once, obscuring
the hesitancy and  inarticulacy &lt;sic&gt; of her speech.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The band, such as it was, did the rounds of South East London pubs for only
five  months in the Spring of '77, singing songs by the Rolling Stones, the
Beatles and  Free. The mind boggles at what, say, Satisfaction must've sounded
like with Kate's  tonsils wrapped around it, but she insists that it was &quot;a
good experience&quot;. So she  didn't exactly pay her dues, but neither was she
the novice that early press reports  made her out to be. 
</P>
<P>Her first LP, The Kick Inside, and her second, Lionheart, were released at 
opposite ends of 1979. &lt;Sic--the year was 1978.&gt; The Kick Inside contained
Wuthering  Heights and the superb The Man With the Child in His Eyes (written by
Kate when  she was a mere fourteen), and was a brave musical debut. Few
listeners could  understand how such a young girl could write such sensual and
perceptive songs.  Men wanted to get into her knickers &lt;God how the IED hates
the kind of  sleaze-bags who still make statements like this!&gt; and women
wanted to scratch her  eyes out &lt;And like this, too!&gt; Nevertheless, enough
of the U.K. bought the LP to put  it at number three on the charts. 
</P>
<P>Kate's whooping, soaring vocals, described by NME as capable of &quot;aging
the  nation's glassblowers&quot;, became an immediate target. She refuted
suggestions that it  was a deliberate and cultivated hook. Her story was that it
stemmed from her days  in the school choir. In those days she couldn't hit the
high notes, so she practiced  hard until her voice could span an impressive four
octaves. &lt;This figure, for some  reason quite commonly cited, is quite
inaccurate. Virtually no human voice is capable  of &quot;spanning&quot; four
full octaves. Kate' recorded vocal range extends slightly beyond  three full
octaves.&gt; &quot;Honest,&quot; she would smile, &quot;I just opened my mouth
and out it  came.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Undoubtedly her most eloquent champion back then was Harry Doherty of 
Melody Maker. On the release of Lionheart he wrote: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush scares me for a combination of reasons. The first is the
diplomatic  pleasantness and awesome logic she displays in interviews. But that
is only one  dimension--she is in fact a 'nice' person. It is when that initial
impact is paired with  the multifarious intensity of her music that I start to
quiver. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The contrast is eerie and frightening. In the studio, living out her
imaginative  fantasies, Kate Bush is stricken by a rush of surrealism, and
suddenly a range of  weird personalities are displayed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Which pretty much sums up what Kate Bush's music was, and has continued to 
be, right up to her current LP, Hounds of Love. It also brings up that old
chestnut of  her &quot;niceness&quot;. Most of her early interviewers were
either trying to find the chink  in her armour of niceness or were full of
ridiculous praise for how well adjusted she  was. It's particularly damning to
the music press that most of these articles were  headed Bush Whacked. So much
for creative journalism. &lt;This from a man who  ascribes to &quot;men&quot; a
communal passion to &quot;get into her knickers&quot;!&gt; 
</P>
<P>Kate, however, was difficult to provoke, and breezed through the task of
meeting  the press with impressive ease. Everybody from Vogue to The Vegetarian
was  interested in her off-beat views on sex, drugs and bean curd. Kate's
niceness was,  in fact, a deliberate attempt to hold onto sanity in a world
where praise and success  were being heaped onto her faster than most
personalities could cope with. She  jibed at Tim Lott from Record Mirror, in a
rare moment of sarcasm and after  considerable provocation, &quot;Actually I mug
old ladies. Would you like me to smash a  window or something?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Of course, she didn't break the window. She was never into drugs,
either--her  only real addictions being nicotine and chocolate. In the same
article Lott said, &quot;She  has experimented with drugs--marijuana and
something she never managed to  identify.&quot; He wrote it as an indictment of
her naivete, but it really only served to  reinforce how incredibly average a
teenager she was. &lt;Average? Nowadays, Kate's  moderation is not at all
typical of teenagers.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Spring 1979 saw the next major event in the explosive days of her early
career. For  months Kate had been locked away in a North London theatre
preparing for her  U.K. concert debut. It was one of the most highly publicised
secrets of the time. She  was being wired up with a special headset-microphone
so that she could perform  her interpretive dance sequences without hindrance. 
</P>
<P>The second single from Lionheart at the time was Wow --the story of and &quot;aging
 gay actor and a starlet who slept her way into a dream role&quot;, according to
The Sun.  She sang it on TV for the first time on (and the papers made a real &quot;Shock!
Horror!&gt;  out of this one) Good Friday--and on the BBC, to boot! The occasion
was an all-star  Abba TV special, The Daily Express reckoned she would jam the
switchboards by  flinging her body into wanton, erotic gestures&quot;. The Daily
Mail wrote: &quot;She walks  like Joan Collins. She looks like Joan Collins. For
a moment you think she is Joan  Collins.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Abba show was a taste of what her live show was to be. Kate was given 
enough money to let her fertile imagination run wild, and it did, in an onstage
orgy  of fantasy, theatre, mime, dance, magic, and, oh yes--music. &lt;Actually,
Kate used a  large part of her own fortune to finance the tour. She lost many
thousands of  Pounds on the venture.&gt; She was so busy preparing the
extravaganza that she had to  decline the coveted invitation to sing the theme
from the Bond film Moonraker.  &lt;Again, this is misleading. Kate probably
could have found time to record John  Barry's song if she had wanted to, but she
has said that she did not feel it was quite  the appropriate song for her to
sing. She said afterwards that the song was &quot;lovely&quot;,  and praised
Shirley Bassey's performance.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Things were still coming pretty easy to Kate Bush. The tour was, overall,
well  received, although Charles Shear Murray of NME .bf ital did proffer the
opinion that  it was &quot;one of the most condescending gigs in history&quot;,
and &quot;crammed with lame  attempts to widen the audience's artistic horizons.&quot;.
&lt;Something from which Mr.  Murray would clearly have benefited.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Just tell me one thing,&quot; asked Kate of the review, &quot;was he
actually at the  Palladium that night?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Charles assured her that he spent a week there that night. &lt;This is a
distortion.  Murray allegedly said something like that to his colleague Danny
Baker at NME, and  Baker in turn told Kate.&gt; And so it went. 
</P>
<P>Despite this, her international reputation continued to grow. The only
problem on  the horizon seemed to be where she was going to find the time to
write material for  her third LP. EMI, worried about keeping the momentum going,
released an EP--  Kate Bush On Stage --which, for a show whose entire success
hinged on a stunning  visual impact &lt;Well, obviously not its entire success!&gt;,
seemed a bit silly. The later  release of the video made eminently more sense. 
</P>
<P>From the release of her third LP, Never For Ever (1980), the Kate Bush story
 becomes a real problem. The big noise amidst which she was unleashed onto an 
unsuspecting public had died down. She toured. She kept her head and persevered 
in reading the teachings of the philosopher Gurdjieff, and in her belief in the 
supernatural. 
</P>
<P>&lt; All three of the preceeding statements are misleading. Kate had toured,
once  only, in the spring of 1979. She did not continue to tour; in fact, she
has not  concertised since then, except as a guest performer at other artists'
shows. She did  not &quot;persevere in reading the teachings of the philosopher
Gurdjieff.&quot; All indications  are that whatever benefit Kate gleaned from
the writings of Gurdjieff had been  acknowledged and assimilated long before
Never For Ever was recorded. There is no  indication that Gurdjieff's ideas have
had a particularly important or dominating  influence on Kate's life or work, at
any time in her life--except insofar as those  ideas harmonised with her own.
Finally, Kate has never said that she &quot;believes&quot;  in the supernatural.
She has always tried to make it clear that  she simply maintains an open mind on
such subjects as supernatural phenomena, as  on all subjects about which human
beings have no conclusive data.&gt; 
</P>
<P>She kept on having hit records. She kept making money in the pop world, even
 though to the pop world she was a bit of an outcast. 
</P>
<P>Never For Ever gave her her first number one LP in September 1980, and 
delivered three hit singles: Breathing, Babooshka and Army Dreamers. The Eastern
 Evening News (Who? -- Ed.) &lt;original to text&gt; described the album as &quot;faultless&quot;.
 Melody Maker gave it a grudging thumbs up. NME, bless them, proclaimed it  &quot;dishonest&quot;
and &quot;the very opposite of what we need&quot;. Annabel, ever on top of
things,  stuck its neck out and claimed Kate Bush was &quot;going to be B-I-G.&quot;

</P>
<P>Soon after, the &quot;Kate Bush Silly Season&quot; began in the press. Oh
Boy gave her the  &quot;Nastiest Barnet Award&quot;. &quot;Seems Angela Rippon's
sick of hearing her hair  compared to a lump of stale meringue,&quot; they
wrote. &quot;Instead we've presented the  award to Kate Bush...And 'bush' is the
word, all right. Sometimes she looks like an  old mattress with springs sticking
out! We'll bet if her hairdresser dug deep enough,  he'd probably find her
school beret under all that lot!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate took a break from music, but made a brief appearance in the BBC series 
Looking Good, Feeling Fit. &quot;Slinky, hip-swiveling singer Kate Bush can be
seen  tonight as audiences have never seen her: tired, perspiring and completely
 disheveled,&quot; wrote The Daily Mirror's television editor--who was obviously
into that  sort of thing. Her single, December Will Be Magic Again, just scraped
into the Top  30. There was a six-month silence, then a single, Sat In Your Lap.
Then a year's  silence broken by the occasional press report and a Record Mirror
interview with  John Shearlaw. 
</P>
<P>In it, she spoke about the tiredness and depression that followed her only
tour,  the Tour of Life, in 1979. She recalled that Never For Ever was &quot;the
first album I  would actually hand over to someone with a smile&quot;; and the
long period of  non-creativity that followed its release. She talked about &quot;recharging&quot;
her creative  batteries and about the next LP. &quot;I want it to be
experimental and quite  cinematic--if that doesn't sound too arrogant.&quot;
There it was, that niceness creeping  up again. 
</P>
<P>Her fourth LP, The Dreaming, appeared months later than scheduled, in 
September '82. It was her first attempt at producing herself, and once again the
 reviews were mixed. Peter Gabriel was a contributor &lt;This is untrue.&gt;
whose  influence on the whole tone of the LP was considerable. 
</P>
<P>&lt;This judgement has been made often. It is untrue that Gabriel &quot;contributed&quot;
to  the album. He took no part in its recording, and is not credited with any
direct input  on the album's liner-notes. Some of the sounds and techniques
created for Gabriel's  third solo album--on which Kate sang some supporting
vocals--did indeed influence  some of the sounds on The Dreaming. This is partly
due, however, to the two  albums' heavy use of the Fairlight CMI, a
sophisticated sampling synthesiser; partly  due to the innovative sounds which
the drummer Phil Collins and the engineer  Hugh Padgham devised for the rhythms
on the Gabriel album; and partly due to the  experiments which Gabriel and other
adventurous musicians were making at that  time with the technique of composing
to the accompaniment of synthetic rhythms,  rather than or in conjunction with
other musical instruments. But The Dreaming  was every bit as innovative an
album as the Gabriel LP--in some ways considerably  more so.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Of the disk's three singles-- Sat In Your Lap, the title track and There
Goes a  Tenner --only the first one was a hit. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is a musical misfit who would do better to turn her talents to the
 cinema or the theatre. &lt;&quot;Do better&quot;?!&gt; She is a bedroom
musician who got lucky.  &lt;&quot;Bedroom musician&quot;?! What does that make
pop-music critics?&gt; A delicate creature  who rationalises the creative
process more than is probably good for her. In an  interview with Harry Doherty
she said of the process of recording her first album:  &quot;It's very
frustrating to see something that you have been keeping transient for  years
just suddenly become solid. It's a little disconcerting...but exciting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush still sells lots of records, but now it seems more like hard work 
promoting and explaining her increasingly difficult-to-grasp concepts. With each
 release, her albums become less of an entertainment and more of an adventure. 
&lt;Adventure is not entertaining?&gt; Certainly Hounds of Love (see reviews
section)  finds her diving deeper into that netherworld of fantasy for which she
is so well  known. &lt;Fantasy? Hounds of Love is as firmly rooted in reality as
any album of its  time. The question is, how narrowly can &quot;reality&quot; be
defined?&gt;
