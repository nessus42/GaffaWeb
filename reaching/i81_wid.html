<BR> Subject: Interview by Ian Birch, ca. June 1981 
</P>
<P>&quot;What I Did On My Holidays&quot; by Kate Bush, as told to Ian Birch 
</P>
<P>&lt;Aproximate date: June 1981. Transcribed by Andrew Marvick&gt; 
</P>
<P> &quot;I was almost empty. I had to fill myself up again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Late last year not even jump leads would have revitalized the Kate Bush
batteries.  She was so exhausted that she took the only sensible course--six
months hibernation.  Consequently since her November single, &quot;December Will
Be Magic Again&quot;, nothing  has been released until the current chart
contender, &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;. 
</P>
<P>During the lay-off she caught up with some sleep, saw her closely knit
family  (brother John, for example, is in charge of all her photography) and,
most important  of all, discovered a brave new whirl of electronic instruments.

</P>
<P>Peter Gabriel had introduced her to the &quot;rhythm box&quot; when they
worked  together on songs like &quot;No Self Control&quot; and &quot;Games
Without Frontiers&quot;. It was the  micro-chip that set everything in motion.
Kate experimented with oscillators,  sequencers and the like. &quot;This whole
new world,&quot; Kate marvelled, &quot;struck me with  awe.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But don't expect her to adopt the showroom dummy-style dour faces and a 
relentless electronic bleep. Her aim is to combine the old with the new, craft
with  discovery. As she explained: &quot;I'm very fond of nostalgia and new
sounds. But I'd  like to apply the future to nostalgia rather than the future to
the future.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; is exactly that. Over a beast of a rhythm
which nods in the  direction of the Burundi Big Beat, she hollers words about
the kind of spiritual  pilgrimages that hippies used to make to India in the
Sixties. 
</P>
<P>Talking of which, she has put &quot;Lord of the Reedy River&quot; on the
b-side--a song  written by Donovan, the wispy folk-rock minstrel who reigned
during the Sixties.  Originally she couldn't decide whether to cover a Donovan
or a Captain Beefheart  composition, but the former won the day after a number
of odd events... 
</P>
<P>Like the evening she was half-watching the Crystal Gayle show on telly and 
half-discussing the dilemma when, lo and behold, Donovan appeared as Crystal's 
guest star. &quot;It was like he was planted in my room,&quot; exclaimed Kate. &quot;I
couldn't  believe it!&quot; 
</P>
<P>At the moment Kate is busy on her fourth album. &lt;&quot;The Dreaming&quot;--IED.&gt;
She  has more or less completed five tracks, one of which involves the Irish
folk band,  Planxty. She asked the group if they would be interested in working
with her, they  said yes, she flew to Dublin, found she had a &quot;strong
feeling for Ireland&quot; (mum has  Irish blood), and together they came up with
&quot;Night of the Swallow&quot;. Once again  Kate enthuses: 
</P>
<P>&quot;They're fantastic musicians with open, receptive minds, which is
unusual for  people who work with traditional folk music.&quot; Maybe we're in
for a revival of Irish  fok music. Kate wants to investigate further while John
Lydon is fast discoveing his  Irish roots. Could it be the Shamrock Shimmy? 
</P>
