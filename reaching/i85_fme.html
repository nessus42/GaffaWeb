<P>Date: Tue, 17 Aug 93 01:38 MET DST <BR> From: uli@zoodle.robin.de (Ulrich
Grepel) <BR> Subject: Fachblatt Musikmagazin 11-85 by Andreas Hub 
</P>
<P>I was sent another old Kate Bush interview, this time from the German
magazine  &quot;Fachblatt Musikmagazin&quot; Nr. 11 from November 85. 
</P>
<P>Uli 
</P>
<P>The following is reproduced without permission. Any translation errors from 
German back to English are mine, as are any typos. 
</P>
<P>Kate  Bush Reappeared 
</P>
<P>With Kate Bush you have an easy job. Almost three years she withdrew herself
 into her studio, without a sign of life, let alone a new album. But in March it
was said  by the usually well informed circles: in April Kate Bush will come to
Germany with  a new album! Neither she nor the album came. Nevertheless, after
years she  reappeared in the charts last summer with &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;.
After  &quot;Babooshka&quot; she could launch the first hit at all and the
biggest one since her early  days with &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. This song
from the &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;-LP all at once  made the lady famous in
1978, when she was rather a girl. Her almost unnatural high  voice, lost in
reverie, and her typical, powerful ballads, that was something described  well
by an otherwise sucked out vocable: simply beautiful. 
</P>
<P>Then came, after the work for the first album needed almost three years, an
all  to fast follow-up and with &quot;Never For Ever&quot; a third album that
unfortunately also did  not have the wanted success. But before that Kate Bush
drew attention to her as a  live nature talent with a spectacular tour. With an
almost sensational show consisting  of revue, pantomime, dance and singing the
gracile beauty enchanted her audience,  and this with a discipline and
concentration as hard as iron; even the acrobatic  exercises she did sing live.
Only with &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; her voice came from a tape.  Up to now this
unfortunately should be a unique experience, captured in the video  &quot;Live
At Hammersmith Odeon&quot; and on a live LP that did not appear in this country.
 After this it got quieter around Kate Bush. The singer, once discovered and 
supported by David Gilmour, was not so much in the limelight as in the
beginning,  she probably also had a long lasting process of finding her own
identity that found its  expression in her up to now most difficult accessible
album &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. In  often gloomy sound visions the former fairy
undertook excursions into the abyss of  the human soul. That was a good three
years ago, and now she should reappear  again. For August a new interview date
was hold out of . A meeting with Kate Bush  - a long-standing wish would be
fulfilled. I have, this personal marginal note is  allowed, like probably every
journalist a few dream partners for an interview: Brian  Eno, Peter Gabriel,
Laurie Anderson, Kate Bush. Laurie Anderson was &quot;due&quot; a year  ago, I
met Peter Gabriel, but did not interview him, for Brian Eno I am waiting yet, 
and Kate Bush... 
</P>
<P>Cancelled again! But a month later the go-ahead was really given -I should
come  to the radio and television exhibition in Berlin, there a conversation
would be  possible. Wonderful, I thought, sat myself into the car, put a preview
cassette of the  new LP &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; into the recorder, and set
off - not knowing that all 25  interviews were cancelled without replacement
that very moment, Stern and other  high profile publications included.
Meeting-place Steigenberger Hotel Berlin, me  punctual and still unsuspecting,
she of course not there, noone from the record  company too. &quot;Kate Bush&quot;,
the man at the reception talked through his nose a bit  condescendenly, &quot;no,
Kate Bush does not live here.&quot; The very momet a lift door  opened next to
me - and she stood in front of me. No manager, noone inbetween  who would try to
get rid of me. I say &quot;Hello, I want to make an interview with you!&quot; 
She says, very English, very polite, very certain: &quot;I'm sorry, I cancelled
all  interviews because I don't have time.&quot; But at least she stands still
for a moment and  does not run past me. You have no chance, but use it...
Bringing up the most heavy  artillery - the journalist as fan, as secret
admirer. Will this cut any ice? I try it out:  &quot;Listen, for this moment I
waited seven years and now I did take a 1000 km car trip  on me. Couldn't we
nevertheless make the interview?&quot; She again, very English,  very polite and
a bit moved: &quot;Wait here - I'll see what we can do...&quot; After five 
minutes she came back, compliments me under a torrent of excuses to a table -and
 starts off, at first 20 minutes, finally almost one hour. Coincidences
happen... &quot;These  don't exists, you know that&quot;, she laughs. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: After I read an interview of the American magazine &quot;Keyboard&quot;
with  you I expected a pure Fairlight-LP. Instead of there are a lot of acoustic
parts and  even very silent piano pieces, almost as on your first LP. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: Interesting impression... To me it's completely different. I find
it's  my least piano influenced album to date, because I more or less completely
 switched to composing with the Fairlight. All piano you hear now was added 
later. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: You did, as with &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, produce yourself... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, I did build my own studio after the last album, and because of
that the  borders between composing, recording and producing became even more
floating.  The whole thing is a very organic process, because everything can
happen next to  each other and simultaneously. There are no demos in the usual
sense any longer.  I record something on the 24 track machine and work on that,
so that the demo  in principle is the later master. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: But that cannot always work smoothly. How many versions of one
idea  are there until a complete piece will emerge from it? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Astonishingly there were only two or three pieces that experienced a 
dramatic change. I usually have the base for a piece very quickly, the ideas
often  come like an explosion, a few pieces of melody, a few fragments of text.
But until  the piece is completely finished it can need a very long time and
that of course  depends on the complexity of the song. In other cases I have the
complete  composition ready and then I am suddenly stuck with the text. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Let's pick out an example, the track &quot;Hello Earth&quot;. At
first there's a  very soft melody, sung by you, while the chorus, sung by a
choir, stands in a very  strong and abrupt harmonic contrast. That sounds very
assembled, as if it was not  created in one piece. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Here the &quot;initial ignition&quot; came together with the idea of
the contents of the  song that determined the structure. I recorded the verse at
first and recorded  only a pilot track with piano for the refrain. Then the
musicians from the Irish  band Planxty were added and then the choir. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Did you always intend real voices to be used or did you use
voices  from the Fairlight at first? 
</P>
<P>KATE: It was clear from the beginning that a real choir was needed there.
Only the  choice of singers was very difficult. This chorus is based on a
traditional that I  picked up at some time. What I imagined was not so much
classical choir voices  but voices that somehow had to sound eerie and also a
bit ceremonial. On the  other hand there was the problem not to imply pressure
and to let the people  sing as natural as possible, since especially with choir
singing a posing artificiality  arises quickly. Fortunately from a gig I had
with the London Symphony Orchestra  I knew a man called Richard Hickox who had
an incredible experience with  choir voices. I let him chose the singers. For me
it was an incredibly thrilling  experience, because I never before worked with a
choir. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Almost sounds as monks singing sacred songs. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Sounds quite religious, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: For me the song seems to have a transfered spiritual meaning. In
the  fade out you speak the German words &quot;Irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein
Licht.&quot;  [Somewhere in the deep there is a light] 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, the piece is the highlight of the second side that has a
continuous string  of action (more on this later). It's something like a fever
dream, the delirium,  before the last song comes, that is completely different,
that is about hope, light  and the break of the morning. &quot;Hello Earth&quot;
is about the point where you cannot  go further, where you are very weak. And
then you perhaps are ready to accept  the things, now, where you have arrived at
the end of your journey. You can  chose to change yourself or to continue and to
die. That of course also has a  religious component. But I find it difficult to
talk about it, or rather to explain it.  During the work on the pieces I know it
much more exactly, probably because I  am much more bound to what emerges from
me while it is being created. When  the pieces are ready they want to speak for
themselves. They are not any longer a  piece from me, but rather develop their
own life. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: How do you manage again and again to create such a strong union
of  music and lyrics? I don't understand everything you sing (my tape did not
have  any further givings or lyrics), but I feel what it's all about. It
couldn't be the  words. Do you get the music and lyric ideas for a piece
simultaneously? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, it's often so that I have the idea of what a song is all about
first and then  the words and music come to me in parallel. 
</P>
<P>With &quot;Hello Earth&quot; for example I knew that this piece would be the
dramatical  highlight of the story. Therefore the verse had to be very slow and
the chorus  had to be very heavy. Well, I'll explain what it's all about. We are
talking about  a storm. There's a person that went overboard in the storm and
fights a whole  night against the waves, the tiredness and the danger to give
up. I wrote all pieces  of the second side of the LP about this plot. A concept
album, or at least half an  album, that was a huge challenge for me and a
long-cherished wishful dream. I  wanted to do something where I didn't have to
be ready with the story after just  three minutes. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Even if it's difficult for you, can you tell me a bit more about
the  plot? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I wish I could show you a film about it. The pictures would explain
much  more easily what I had in mind. There's someone going overboard, at night.
He  gets insanely tired, wants to resign. Then his past, his present and his
future  travel past him and try to keep him awake and to bring him through this
night.  These are of course metaphers for a very deep inner experience after
which you  reenter the light at the other end as a purified human being. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: As a kind of spiritual transformation... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, like a rebirth. There is the external, physical moment, and then
there's  a process that happens in the head, thoughts, voyages to inner spaces.

</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Water is a diversely interpretable symbol. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, it also includes the feeling of floating. In addition here
there's the night,  the darkness, the complete loss of sense for space and time,
the shield from all  outer impressions. And when something like this happens
very remarkable things  start happening in your head. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Like in an isolation tank... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, even if I didn't make any personal experiences with that by
myself. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Did you by chance read &quot;In The Center Of The Cyclon&quot; by
John C.  Lilly who experienced first with the tank? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Unfortunately I didn't read it, but I have heard a lot of things about
his work  that I found very interesting. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: I fear we come into areas that do not neccessarily belong into a
music  magazine... Let's talk about your music again. The difference between
your last  album &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and the new &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;
is astonishing. I always  had difficulties to listen to &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
in one piece, because in places it  teared a lot on the nerves. Did your musical
and/or personal attitude change that  much in the last three years that you now
can deliver a quite accessible, at times  poppish album? 
</P>
<P>KATE: The music always subordinates to the contents of the songs. &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;  was an emotionally very intense and often conciously
aggressively sounding  album, because it was about how terribly cruel people
could be, what we do to  ourselves, what amount of loneliness we expose
ourselves. It was a searching,  questioning album and with the music did tear
you from one point to the next. It  provoked extreme reactions, and there were
many who were not able to or did  not want to get involved with the mood of the
album. I was and am very content  with it, because for me I have definitively
achieved what I wanted to. I had to  experience myself what I wanted to explore
there, and now I have made the  experience and could turn to other destinations.
Suddenly I could go dancing  again, I spent a summer out of the house, something
I did not do for several years.  Thereby I felt so positively that I also wanted
to write songs that give a positive  prevailing mood. That was a completely new
challenge, because until then I got  my inspirations more from melancholic and
gloomy moods. But suddenly I could  get enthusiastic about things that were
light and lively. I wanted to write about  the positive power of love and not
any longer about people who destroy each  other. The whole energy that developed
itself that way also transfered itself to  the album. Thereby I did not only
want to describe love as a happy, lightful  matter, but I rather wanted to show
it in all of her aspects, also the dark ones.  The LP has got two very different
sides this way. The first shows an overview  over different forms of love and
without exception deals with relations, and the  second side goes deeper,
therefore the concept spanning all tracks. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Both sides are very different musically too. The first contains a
couple  of very danceable, rhythmic titles. Did you expect to have a hit with &quot;Running
Up  That Hill&quot; or was this just a nice side-effect? 
</P>
<P>KATE: At one point I stopped to have any expectations with respect to the
music  business. But of course it is nice if what you could expect happens... I
always had  the feeling that hopefully there are other people too who like my
albums, if I  only put a maximum of personal engagement into the work. And it
works! Great,  isn't it? 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: And why is the album called &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;? These
seem to be  two contradicting terms. 
</P>
<P>KATE: No, these are the hounds who chase  - symbolically of course - those
who  fear love, who is frightened to be &quot;trapped&quot; by it. But they
aren't really bad  hounds, you can see on the cover how gently and nice the &quot;Hounds
Of Love&quot; are. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Do you rather think of it as an advantage or a disadvantage that 
there's so much time between your albums? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I cannot answer this question this way, since it simply is as it is. I
never said: I  need two or three years to make an album. I just began. Whereever
this leads -  as long as it's positive and productive I continue to do it. If
you do your work  honestly and with your whole heart It will tell you what to
do... 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: But outside there's nobody who tells you if you are on the right
way.  Someone who brings out a single every second month experiences very fast
how  the course is at the moment. 
</P>
<P>KATE: That is a frustrating aspect of my method of working. Besides I also
like to  busy myself with other ideas and projects. But I cannot run away from
the things  I have to do at the moment. That takes my complete energy. I just
have to bring  such sacrifies, and with me it lasts longer as with others. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: When did you start with &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;? 
</P>
<P>KATE: 1983 the studio was built and set up, and in the beginning of 1984 I
started  with the album, all in all 18 months of work. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: In such a long time many things can change. Wherefrom do you take
 the safety that in the end you find those things you recorded in the beginning 
as  good and important? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, if something does not work at all, because you did get off
course, you  just have to have the courage to stop there, even when you already
did invest a lot  of time and work. But this happens very seldom with me, and
except those two  or three pieces with heavy changes that I did mention earlier
the founding  structures did not change. Changes did mostly occur only in the
fine parts, when  we for example exchanged Fairlight violins by real strings. I
wanted to replace  many Fairlight passages by real instruments from the
beginning. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Who played with you? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Mainly the people from the last LP, like for example Eberhard Weber,
Danny  Thompson, Dave Lawson, Stuart Elliott, the musicians from Planxty, my
brother,  but also others, like John Williams. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: In which phase do you include the musicians into the work? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Different. Sometimes in the beginning I only have a program in the
Linn  machine, to which I bring in a few real drum tracks. Normally the
musicians  record to a &quot;demo&quot; that's consisting of Fairlight, voices
and the Linn machine. But  I also use a lot of Fairlight percussion. The most
improtant thing with the work  with other musicians are the additional
stimulations, especially when I sat alone at  the Fairlight before. Then the
influences from outside are very helpful. I need  the feedback, else in the long
run it'll get too boring for me. It's nice just to see  some other faces
sometimes. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Do you get other feedback besides by your musicians? Normally 
there's also a producer next to you who knows and says where it's going. 
</P>
<P>KATE: That's exactly the reason why I produce myself. It is more exhausting
this  way, but in the end I get exactly what I want instead of explaining what I
want to  someone else who tries to explain to the sound engineer what I could
have  meant. And then the sound engineer has to create sounds out of words. I
tell him  directly what I want, that is faster, more easy and more effective.
But there are, I  say this with caution, people with whom I could imagine to
produce together, but  only as long as I have the influence possibilities on my
productions that I have  today. As I said before: With me the composing and
producing almost build a unit  in the working process. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Are there direct connections to your &quot;discovery&quot; of the
Fairlight as  the key element of your studio work? You did, if I recall right,
work without a  producer from the moment where you started with the Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>KATE: No direct connection. Besides it's not completely correct this way. I
did work  with the Fairlight, not with my own, on my third album, but I only
have been  co-producer then. I couldn't take the last and decisive step then,
because I  missed courage and specialised knowledge. You need an enormous amount
of  strength to control you own musical work. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: What general meaning does music take up in your life? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Music takes up all my live. That is always a huge pile of work that
last exactly  as long until the next one starts. But music also means the
pleasure to listen to  pieces from others. Music is everything for me. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: I have heard that you are especially into ECM and Windham Hill...

</P>
<P>KATE: Yes, and I find it good to give some more attention to something as
beautiful  as the music of these labels. Windham Hill is almost completely
unknown in  England, while ECM has a slightly bigger popularity through Pat
Metheny or  Eberhard Weber. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: I think that artists who are very intent on harmonic sounds like
the  most from Windham Hill find it especially difficult in such a trend ruled
music  marked like the English one. If you review your albums, the first one
perhaps  excluded, there never are pieces that are just nice. Somewhere there's
always a  break. Don't you dare to write a piece that's &quot;just&quot; nice? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Difficult to tell. If I write I try to get to something that pleases
me more than  the idea of the moment before. And if it sounds good to me to
break out of the  gentle character, then I do this naturally without following
certain rules. 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: What about gigs? Is there hope? 
</P>
<P>KATE: That is quite wierd, because I always want to, but somehow it never
works  out all right. Until the last LP I did not have enough material to appear
with a  completely new program. After I completed the promotion work for &quot;The
 Dreaming&quot; I had to think about whether to go on tour or to build my studio
and  to look at a new album. Well, now I am again at the end of the work for the
 album, make promotion, shoot videos and actually I would really want to realise
 the said film about the second side of the LP. If this somehow happens not to 
work then I'll think about a tour again... 
</P>
<P>FACHBLATT: Do you find everything that goes with it as a disruption to the 
concentrated work in the studio? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Not as disrupting, but as a burden, yes. I try to put as much time as
possible  into creative processes. When I am ready with an album there are
enough  creative processes left, be it b-sides or videos that get into the way
of public  relations work. I am of course dependent on a certain amount of
success to be  able to afford the next album. And then I unfortunately have to
make timely  compromises with the things that are more important to me. To limit
this as far  as possible I don't give many interviews. I find it completely
justified, since I find  my actual work more important. The only reason why I do
sit here at all is that I  worked on an album for a long time and want to
announce this. But when I used  up three years to meet journalists and to make
promotion, then there won't be a  reason to sit here...
