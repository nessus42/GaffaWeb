<P>Kate Bush<BR> Birmingham</P>
<P>DID YOU ever visit some distant relative for tea and  cakes, and as a
postscript have to sit through the 'party  piece' of their little girl, all
rolling eyes and precocious  gesturing? Kate Bush is a bit like that. Now, I'm
the  heartless sod who with a singular lack of vision  numbered Kate's 'The Kick
Inside' album as a 'tax  loss' flop, but I'm here to tell you I've seen the
light,  and the 'Wuthering Heights' too.</P>
<P>Yes, the light(s). And the mime, the dance, the special  effects, the
professionalism and, must importantly, the  talent. Kate is Cinderella, that
front room brat landed  with a million dollars to play with, and she's used it 
wisely.</P>
<P>For me, her voice is so unique and impossibly high  that it only really
works on record in a singles format,  but on stage she's surrounded by such a
dazzling  barrage of imagery that any lack of versatility in the  melody
department slips by virtually unnoticed amid  the MoR psychedelia.</P>
<P>In fact, Kate's dream machine techniques are by  far the best I've ever
encountered on a British  rock 'n' roll tour.</P>
<P>A SHADOW on a silk-screen, whisked away as willowy  Kate emerged from a
circular  cavern, slinky and innocently  seductive. God knows what the song was,
I was too busy  watching the huge concave screen with its tidal wave  which
seemed about to engulf the band at any minute.</P>
<P>Oh the band! Del Palmer, a bassist who looks like Todd  Rundgren and plays
like a dream. And Brian Bath on  searing but delicate lead guitar, and what
seems like  40 dozen other people, sonically speaking, who are  so good that
most of the time you don't even notice  their presence.</P>
<P>Forgiveable, when you're being distracted by Katy  being wheeled around in a
giant sized satin-lined  choc box contraption by two agile and androgynous 
negro dancers, or listening to the programme links  booming out in the sonorous
tones of John Carder Bush  (is this a family show?)</P>
<P>As her lights stroked the eyeballs with a series of visuals  more formalized
than the 1967 San Francisco variety but  just as effective, the cuddly Kate
posed and flew in  perfectly executed manoeuvres, with her dancing pals  along
for the ride going through as many positions as The  Perfumed Garden without
ever missing a sexy note of her Sunday supplement-rock.</P>
<P>Wolves howled, candles flickered ten times larger than  life, people danced
'Fantasia'-like in eight foot human  violin getups (just like Wayne County) a
magician  worked wonders with an airborne cane (you rarely  saw the wires), dry
ice almost asphyxiated the stalls and Bushy whisperers lines like &quot;You have
the face of a  genius &quot;.</P>
<P>PRETENTIOUS, unfortunately. Effective, undoubtedly.  Resonating
announcements of Byronic waffle about  letting &quot;The wasp settle on the soft
down of  your arm&quot; might be pushing the audience's  tolerance a bit far,
but when it gets to not wanting  to &quot;see two in one coffin&quot; you have
to give  the lady credit for stepping outside of showbizzy  conventions,
although she might still be a little sweet  for hardrock poetaster fans.</P>
<P>Actually, it's difficult to discern who the Kate Bush audience  really
comprises  The place seemed to be full of upmarket  young couples, with a
smattering of 'nice' chaps cruising on  their own. Those lads; the Judy
Garland/Bette Midler axis.  They'd love be Kate, a thousand thrills, a hundred
costume  changes. Humiliating those nasty men with that big rifle,  leather
jacketed in a 'West Side Story' parody. That  predelication for leg-warmers.
Wow! </P>
<P>She belly dances (keeping it covered up, though), and sang  'Kite' while
managing to look like one, and 'Oh England My  Lionheart' in a set straight out
of 'Reach For The Sky'.</P>
<P>KATE BUSH'S show is the connection between rock 'n' roll  and Las Vegas
taken to the outer limits. It's so finely realised  that it's beyond rational,
criticism because she's constructed  her very own universe on a stage, and if
that universe seems  a little precious or twee then it's of secondary importance
 when you consider her purely physical achievement.</P>
<P>Rock turkeys the world over have forever played around with  stage concepts,
but apart from a smoke machine here and a  thunderflash there it's all come to
naught. Kate Bush, however,  has put her dreams into actual flesh.</P>
<P>Maybe the package )she's on stage for nearly 2 1/2 hours) is  overlong, like
Bruce Springsteen's marathons, but she never  bores, and unlike The Greatful
Dead's day and night jobs you  won't need acid or dope to keep you amused.</P>
<P>Mime and crystal pure sound (but the mike attached to her  noggin should go,
simply for visual reasons) do a great show  make. Kate Bush may not have
anything particularly profound  to say, but on this evidence she says it
beautifully. Just like  Walt Disney, a child's garden of good and evil.</P>
