<P>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1991 02:42:36 -0800 <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com
(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: &quot;Tiswas&quot; interview fall 1978
</P>
<P>24. TisWas: Kate is interviewed (fall '78*) by the same woman who would host
 Razzmatazz in No. 50*. In the present brief interview Kate, wearing a black
leather  jacket, and the other woman are kneeling on the floor, close to the
camera. Kate  seems quite ill at ease. 
</P>

</P>
<P>[Hammer Horror is shown. My tape seems to cuts in mid-sentence] 
</P>
<P>I: ...Kate. 
</P>
<P>K: Hi. 
</P>
<P>I: And nice of you to spare some time to talk to us. I know you're in the
middle of  your first tour, which must be quite hectic for you. 
</P>
<P>K: It's going really well, thanks. Yeah, it's really good. 
</P>
<P>I: You have actually received very good reviews, well most of the ones I've
read have  been very good. Were you worried about what the critics were going to
say about  you? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I'm always worried what they're going to say. But personally I
always feel  the most important thing is your audience. Because, whoever the
critics are, it is  only a personal point of view. And although it's very
important, especially to the  public, I can't help but feel that the immediate
reaction you get there is what  matters the most. 
</P>
<P>I: And how have you found the reaction so far from the audience? 
</P>
<P>K: Incredible.. 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah? 
</P>
<P>K: ... I couldn't believe it. They're so beautiful. 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>K: Really. 
</P>
<P>I: Now, of course, it is a rather elaborate show that you're doing, isn't
it? The sort  of set changes, like how you're doing a bit of magic, all sorts of
things going on.  How long did it take to get the whole thing together? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, a few months. We've been working since the beginning of this year,
and it's  coming along well. 
</P>
<P>I: I mean, were many people involved in sort of the whole concept, or was it
basically  all your idea? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, the major concept is basically mine, but I've had a lot of help
from people  and we've all worked together, really, on a lot of levels. And I
think that's the  best thing about it, you know, that everyone's really enjoying
working with each  other. 
</P>
<P>I: Now that it has worked so well, I gather that you were a little bit
worried before  hand that it would be okay, now that it proved to be so
successful, do you think  you might do a more extensive tour later in the year?

</P>
<P>K: That really depends. So much depends on energies, you know, because it
can  become very tiring with the traveling. I don't know, we have to wait and
see. 
</P>
<P>I: Last year was really definitely your year, wasn't it, sort of hit
records, you won  practically every award going, your first single went straight
to number one. Were  you sort of prepared for the success to happen as quickly
as that? 
</P>
<P>K: How can you be prepared for something like that? 
</P>
<P>I: I mean, did it sort of... did it stun you slight that everything was
going was going so  well? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, yeah! Absolutely, I'm still stunned by that. I obviously can't
believe it. It  never really sunk in. It's something that you don't expect to
happen and I'm just  so lucky that people chose me. 
</P>
<P>I: How old were you when you were first interested in music? 
</P>
<P>K: Since I was a kid, I mean I've been interested in music since I was about
five.  But when I was about eleven I actually started writing songs. 
</P>
<P>I: Could you play an instrument when you were eleven, then? 
</P>
<P>K: I was learning the violin and I didn't like it and I used to go to the
piano as a sort  of rebellion against the violin and I'd take it out on the
piano. 
</P>
<P>I: And you'd actually started writing at that young age? Were your family
musical,  did they sort of encourage you? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, my brothers were, but I'd used to sort of lock myself away, I was
quite  lonely as a kid, so I used to use my piano as a friend. 
</P>
<P>I: What really inspires you then to write your songs? I mean do you actually
sit  down and say &quot;right, I'm going to write a song now&quot; or does
something that  happens to you give you an idea? 
</P>
<P>K: Well even if I get the idea, I have to say &quot;right, I'm going to sit
down and right  the song now&quot; because you have to make that decision]
before you actually break  through the thinking about it to doing it. Because
that's the trouble with  everything, you can think about it for ages but to
actually do it is the leap. And it  really depends on so much as to whether it
comes together. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, Kate, thanks very much for talking to us. And good luck next week,
I  gather you're doing a week at the London Palladium. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: I hope that goes well for you. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: We're going to in fact hear your latest single now, the one that's doing
well in the  charts for you. Here's Kate Bush with &quot;Wow.&quot;
