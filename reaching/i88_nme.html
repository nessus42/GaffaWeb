<P>Len Brown's New Musical Express interview, November 12, 1988
</P>
<P>     [Edited by Andrew Marvick.]

</P>
<P>                   Down at the old Bul' and Bush 
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush and Yanka Rupkina sit on a bean-bag couch and sing to me,
Bulgarian style; Rupkina bleating high and joyous above Bush's harmony.
</P>
<P>     Short but sweet, a brief musical meeting of East and West, it's the
sort of sensual aural treat every philanthropist would wish to share with the
world. Except that the World would have been pushed to fit in this studio broom
cupboard off Upper Street, Islington.

<!-- Removed due to copyright takedown request

<P>     We are talking here, my friends, about the power of music. Not &quot;music
to make megabucks,&quot; or &quot;music to drop acid to,&quot; or &quot;music to
make you forget,&quot; but music that stimulates the pleasure senses and gently
feeds emotions. We are talking Trio Bulgarka, those legendary Balkan vocal
veterans--Rupkina, Stoyanka Boneva, and Eva Georgieva--who find themselves
contributing to Kate Bush's first album in three years.
</P>
<P>     While a Beeb camera crew films the Trio--in technicolour national
costume, laughing and chattering through Dva Kornie --for the Rhythms of the
World series, I find myself closeted with the traditionally taciturn Kate Bush.
She rarely agrees to interviews these days, and rarely agrees to interviews
these days, and rarely allows outsiders to intrude on her studio work, yet here
she is relaxed--all in black with long flames of hair--and glad to be back
making music. Particularly with the Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>      Her Bulgarian obsession stems from her brother Paddy,
multi-instrumentalist and student of ethnic musics and musicians.
</P>
<P>     &quot;He had this tape of Bulgarian voices, three years ago,&quot; says
Kate, &quot;just when we were finishing Hounds of Love. It was the most
incredible thing I've ever heard, beautiful. So I decided I wanted to work with
them in some form in the future...But it takes me a long time to digest ideas -
even if I read a book it maybe won't come out into a song until four years
later. So I wrote a track with a choir-synthesiser sound hoping that if we could
get to work with them, they would take the weight of the song from the
synthesisers.&quot;
</P>
<P>     She made contact with Trio Bulgarka through their British
producer/promoter/friend/Bragg-associate Joe Boyd of Hannibal Records, who
released the Balkana compilation in '87 and the Trio's own The Forest is Crying
LP earlier this year. Two weeks ago Kate visited Bulgaria and returned with the
Trio to record two tracks in London.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I was very worried because chances were it might not work,&quot;
she admits, particularly because they're so good. It might just sound like we'd
bunged them in a Western track. I really didn't want them to be dragged down to
my level. I was worried that they wouldn't want to get involved with Western pop
music, because it has a bad name and a lot of people are initially scared of
it...I don't blame them at all.
</P>
<P>     &quot;We had to get a special arranger (Dmitr Penev) because the beauty
is not just in the voices but also in the ancient arrangements. He was
brilliant, it couldn't have been better, the way we managed to communicate
exactly what we wanted despite language problems...It sounds corny, but I do
feel very honoured.&quot;
</P>
<P>     The raw results of these sessions which I hear by accident, sound
impressive. Any fears that Bush might be dabbling in some sort of Bulgarian &quot;Duck
Rock&quot; or even Duck Rock or even Graceland territory are dispelled by the
true spirit of the recording; the emotion of the Trio's traditional singing is
beautifully complimented by Kate's distinctive vocal. The Trio sing Bulgarian
words, so perhaps the Azanian chorals of Gabriel's Biko would be a closer
reference point, although although there's not quite such a potent message here.
</P>
<P>     &quot;You're not distracted by words,&quot; suggests Kate, &quot;all
you're picking up are the emotions that they're translating to you. It feels
like very deep information. There's one point when Yanka's belting it out,
really fantastic, yet she's singing something like, 'Marco sits down with his
mother and has some bread and jam'!&quot;
</P>
<P>     That's one of the strange things about Bulgarian music. You find
yourself sitting, listening, awe-struck, lump-throated, only to find you've been
moved to tears by a song about a bumble-bee or a mosquito playing the bagpipes
or dark-eyed Yanka's marigolds (&quot;I mislaid my kavals by your gates last
night, Elenke, did you see them?&quot;). Whatever they sing about it always
comes over as powerful, spine-tinglingly heartfelt (particularly their lament
for the Bulgarian Robin Hood Indje Voivode). Just listen and it's easy to
understand why Kate Bush and others have been drawn to this music, this
antithesis of producer pop for inspiration.
</P>
<P>     &quot;If they sing Strati Angelaki to me I can't take it,&quot;
confesses Kate, &quot;I have to leave the room, it just makes me cry and there
are very few things musically that affect me like that.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Rather than increasing the difficulties, the language barrier between
Kate and the Trio seems to have promoted their personal and working
relationship.
</P>
<P>      &quot;I've been so excited doing it and it's so lovely for me to work
with women as well, a tremendous difference. And because we can't talk
intellectually - we can't talk about the state of Bulgaria or even what the
shops are like in London--our whole communication is totally emotional.
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's an incredible experience, the warmth they give you, you
don't often get it from Westerners. Here it's very much a communication of 'I
have this, you don't have that' or 'I don't have that and you do,' whereas they
want to know what kind of person you are...you can feel them probing your heart.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Bush has, of course, experimented before with global ideas on odd
tracks: Egypt, Kashka from Baghdad, the aboriginally-inspired The Dreaming,
Greek rhythms and portentous use of Bulgarian teppan (drum) on Jig of Life.
Here, the Bulgarian singers are playing a more central role than previous ethnic
musicians (Esmail Sheikh, Donal Lunny, Liam O'Flynn, Rolf Harris), employed to
compliment Kate's attempts to create lasting pop rather than quick cash.
</P>
<P>     It's been a strange experience for Trio Bulgarka, who are more used to
the familiar string drones of the gadulka or the strummed tambura or the piping
gaida than to Bush-style pop experimentalism. They seem, however, to have
adapted with remarkable ease.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Kate's very popular in Bulgaria,&quot; says Yanka Rupkina through
interpreter Borimira Nedeva, &quot;young people like her very much. She sings
emotionally. There's lots of lovely thinking in her writing and she's a very
good musician. It is our first time with such a famous singer, and we hope we'll
work with her in the future, if we haven't caused her too many worries.&quot;
</P>
<P>     There's the distinct, appealing prospect of Bush (in full Bulgarian
gear?) performing live with the Trio; it's been donkeys since the Theatre of
Kate was last seen onstage (benefits aside) but, she says, &quot;if anything
could make me tour again it would be the people in this studio&quot;.
</P>
<P>      In the meantime we should be glad she'.s back in the studio; in the
80s she's proved to be one of the few artists with the courage to disappear for
years and return with original, quality creations. (Running Up That Hill was
voted number 13 in NME's &quot;Top 150 Singles of All Time,&quot; February
1987). After her initial late '70s/early '80s burst of energy, it was three
years before Hounds of Love followed The Dreaming and, The Whole Story
singles-compilation aside, it's been even longer this time.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I find it very difficult, nothing comes easy to me. I don't know
if I'm a perfectionist, although people say that about me. I just find it harder
each time to write songs. Ten songs doesn't sound many, but you want each to say
something about you and who you are at this point in time; to say something new.
But the more you put into something the harder it becomes.
</P>
<P>      &quot;Making an album for me is very much a psychological process;
it's very painful and it gets more painful each time. I think it's hard for
people to understand because it seems so silly, an album's such a trivial thing,
really...I've had to accept a lot of things about myself for this album that
have been hard for me. Every time I kid myself that an album will take six
weeks, but once I get in there and get halfway through it's too big for me. I
think, 'My God, what am I doing I doing in the middle of this?'&quot;
</P>
<P>     Well, I know what I'm doing in the middle of all this: enjoying myself,
listening to Kate, to the music, to Bulgarian chattering. So ears aroused and
with a Balkan spring in my step, I leave Kate with the Trio, wondering to myself
how all this works. How it's possible to unite east and West, ancient and
modern, while having to overcome cultural and linguistic differences. I express
my surprise at the power of non-verbal communication to the translator Borimira,
half-expecting a lengthy treatise on glasnost, perestroika or One Worldism. But
she replies simply: &quot;Emotions are another world's language&quot;
</P>
<P>     Ooh, I wish I'd said that. Kate Bush's fifth [sic] album, Yanka
Rupkina's first British solo album, and BBC-2's Rhythms of the World programme
will all appear in the New Year.
