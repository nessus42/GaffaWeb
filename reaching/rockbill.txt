Greek choruses of badging vocals
songs of death and life and love, her
sense of humor, her sense of Me
macabre. A question reared up in me
stand demanded an answer*Who is
SKate Bush and where has she beers
my life?
  A four-year old record company
bio revealed only that Kate Bush put
two years into the making of her de-
but disc after being signed by EMl
Records at age 17 (on the sponSoF-
ship of Pink Floyd's Dave Giimour). I
found an incredibly badly written
book on her which provided 100
pages of trivial, but mostly useless
information. Finally, l unearthed her
1978 released-in-U.S.A. album, The
Kick Inside, containing "Wuthering
Heights," which was one Olaf the big-
gest U.K hits of the year. In fact, the
later '70s were banner years for Kate

16

neglect.
    Zere's a confusion over at EMl-
0 Adnerica regarding Kate Bush. Every-
0 one seems to love her, but nobody
tcan explain why this country is virtu-
ally unaware of her. They cite the
unaccustomed complexities of her
sound to American ears. They cite the in
inhibiting cost for not bringing her
stage show over here (due to her in-
sistence on perfection and the in-
credible amount of time it takes to
prepare for her show—over a year
for the last one in '78). Some blame it
on narrow-minded radio program-
mers. Except for KROQ in Los Ange-
les and WLIR in New York's Long Is-
land area and a few others, you won't
hear Kate Bush on the radio. And,
though her videos are outlandishly
expressive, you're not likely to see
them on the cable music stations.

  Yet, there's something about Kate
Bush, age 24, that demands and de-
serves attention. TheDreaming is an
album of textures: The surfaces be-
tween death and life, hate and love,
war and religion, fear and desire, risk
and peace. She weaves disparate
phenomenon together and creates
not a homogeneous whole, but an
Intertwining knot of human relations.
Wisdom and ignorance are not por-
trayed as opposites in her single "Sat
In Your Lap," but as correlaries. To
experience one, causes the other
  The Dreaming is not an album to
hear while you're washing the dishes.
It requires a willingness of the listen-
er to be captivated, to be whirled into
a trans-dimensional, multi-ethnic
meddle of mysterious magical
music.
  "It's a bit like- a poem:' explains
Kate in her near-London home,
where she was getting ready for
Christmas with her extensive family.
'Nfou don't know what on Earth it's
about till you start working with it.
Without that initial effort you
wouldn't have a clue.
  "The songs themselves, apart from i
just a couple, are actually very in-
volved. In order to get what I really S
meant across, things had to be ap-
plied in layers. Although there is a
lead voice, the backing vocals are of-
ten answering the question of the
lead voice. Already, you've got twioE
sets of vocals. lllen, I was actuator l
trying to-create an environment."
  Environment creating in music rest
quires diverse and exotic instru- 0
ments from Irish Uillean pipes t o
Australian Digeridus. Many of these,
throughout her albums, have been X
played by her brother, Paddy.
  "He's attracted to a lot of unusual 4
tones that I like and are good for the 0
songs," she says.
  "Trying to get a sound is really de-
ciding the pictures of the song. Every
song has a story and therefore it;
needs to picture an environment.;
There are so many sounds that can set;
up that kind of situation. I try to make
everything that I play in tune with;
what the Song is ahallt"
a
 l rate's progression through her
 0 t l t four albums is linked to her
 , 1 | k taking on more control with

    l Liszt cach record. Having produced
The Dreaming, the sound on it is the
c losest yet to actually reproducing
the sound-environment in her mind.
Many of these sounds, especially on
"I Leave it Open" and "Get Out of My
House" are distorted for dramatic
effect.
  "l like the idea of distortion. In re-
ality, the most bizarre things you can
think of quite often do occur. Putting
opposites together to create some
 hing...disturbing appealed to me."

  One seeming paradox referred to
often on the album, but especially in
'5Sat in Your Lap" is the coming to
know that there is more to know than
you knew about. When she sings
"Give me the Karma, mama" it's both
in despair and desire.
  "Basically, it's all about the search
for wisdom. Just when you think you
know everything, think you're really
clever, you realize that you don't
know anything at all.
  "All the way along life there is a big
wall. Once you get over one wall,
there's another waiting for you.
You've got to accept it and keep up
with it. It's a very complicated busi-
ness, but the whole point of living is
learning. You can never stop learning.
It's a process that always continues—
not something that you actually en
ish like reading a book."
  The title track involves a neglected
race, the Australian Aborigines, and
the systematic destruction of their
culture and their lives by the greed
and close-mindedness of world
capitalism.
  "Apparently," says Kate, "they're
the oldest race of man on Earth. They
suffer the same problems as other na-
fives have .sllff~red from civilized
man all over the world. It's not just
the Australians, the English have
done it, the Spanish. It's civilized man
wiping out certain natives either by
disease or just undermining them. I
think it's still shown when a native
culture is not allowed to exist be-
cause civilized man doesn't want
them. It's the same problem, though I
shouldn't compare them—they're
not parallel, but it's the problem with
whales and animals that are going ex-
tinct. It moves me. I felt l should
write a song about it—not that it
would have any effect, but perhaps
I'd be able to say something more
than nothing at all."
  In "Night of the Swallow" she
writes of a man "being attached to
fear as a way of proving risk and his
lady who doesn't want to go any-
where near it." In "Houdini," again
there is a man tempting death and a
woman who both loves the man and
hates what he does.
  Kate Bush writes songs like a physi-
cist setting up problems. There are
opposing vectors and chain reac-
tions. She works not on the static
two-dimensional plane of most love
songs, but on a multi-dimensional
sphere where feelings are never cre-
ated or destroyed—they loop back
like invisible boomerangs, to the rad-
ical coefficient.
  "l do seem to pick up vibes from
things and people. Very often you
can't putyour fingeron it,but you get
feelings. Sometimes you don't like
people you meet for the first time and
there's no reason why you should.
You're getting a feeling from them
you can't refer to, yet there's some-
thing there. I think that's in all of us. I
think we had it a lot stronger a long,
long time ago. Some people forget it's
a part of them and the rest, if they
pick up a vibration, don't really know
what it meallS."

  For example, in "All The Love,"'
Kate writes of our general unwilling- .
ness or incapacity to express love to t
someone while they're alive, waiting h
for death to allow the feelings to bet
unleashed.
  "Everyone can say that there have l
been times when they should have
given people feedback and told them,
how good they are, but they leave it §
till it's too late. It's so often a fear of
rejection that stops them from saying I
that, or perhaps it wouldn't fit in with (
their image Everyone needs feed- 2
back. Everyone needs to feel they've j
got friends. At the same time, all of us
feel alone.
  "Suddenly a tragedy will happen so
you'll feel bad for the people who:
died when you hadn't thought about
them for years maybe. It's only shock
that makes you realize the important I
things, otherwise you carry on with
the normal life and don't bother to
think back on people and realize that
they need you."
  If, as in the environment of "Sus-
pended in Gaffa," Kate Bush is a wo-
man stuck to adhesive tape able to
see, but not make contact with, the
metaphysical treasure of omni-uni-
versal prescience or mass humanity
(they're to the same effect), than it's
more our loss than hers. But the pro-
cess is always more important than
the result.
  Kate Bush has created an album of h
dreams and nightmares, gothic hor-
rors and subtle metaphors, low com-
edy and high tragedy. It is imbued $
with looking-glass clarity. It is thel
stuff that not only dreams, but that !
life is made of
  Perhaps the legend on the back of 8
the album, a quote from "Houdini" I
means, as so many things do, more }
than it seems to say.
