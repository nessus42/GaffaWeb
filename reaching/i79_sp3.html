<p><strong>Kate's Great!</strong></p>

<p>(How to become a superstar the Kate Bush way)</p>


<p>IT'S taken less than two years for Kate Bush to slide 
silkily into the top ranks of British performers. It was 
in the cold January of '78 that the public first heard of 
her via the Bronte-inspired debut smash 'Wuthering 
Heights'.</p>

<p>But this was no potlucky, one off single. Kate's career 
really began when she was 16 years old, four years 
before the single was released.</p>

<p>In the intervening time, she was under carefully 
monitored wraps, courtesy of recording giants EMI. </p>

<p>But the story begins before even then . . .</p>

<p><strong>Wispy</strong></p>

<p>Born into a family whose musical tastes were many 
and varied, by the time she was 11 Kate had taught 
herself to play piano and had written her first songs. 
Quietly convinced she had talent, Kate worked at her 
craft studiously. </p>

<p>When she was 16 she met David Gilmour of Pink Floyd 
fame . . . he liked what he heard and seeing the potential 
in the wispy teenager, ensconced her into London's Air 
Studios to lay down some tracks.</p>

<p>The results were quick and decisive; a fully produced 
demo and a contract with EMI Records.</p>

<p>But instead of rush releasing the single and pushing Kate 
on a round the country tour, the vinyl magnates decided 
to bide their time.</p>

<p>During the interim, Kate concentrated on perfecting her 
trade.</p>

<p><strong> Expand</strong></p>

<p>To explore and develop her musical techniques she 
concentrated on writing. To expand her abilities and 
to find a better method of expressing her highly 
imaginative songs, she took lessons in dance. </p>

<p>She studied with the best teachers in the land, 
including the master of mime, Lindsay Kemp.</p>

<p>Learning many aspects of visual communication 
and movement, she cleverly adapted them to her 
songs. Believing that a live performance should be 
a multi-level affair, Kate wanted to incorporate music, 
dance and poetry into hers.</p>

<p>She wanted Kate Bush concerts to be something no 
one would forget. The beginning of 1978 and the 
time was ripe. EMI released the first single, sat 
back and waited for the storm they knew would 
break.</p>

<p>Reviews were mixed. Some likened her voice to 
that of a drowned cat. Some couldn't bear the 
screeching. But some predicted that this young 
lady was going to be the brightest star to emerge 
that year.</p>

<p>The single hung around the bottom of the charts for 
a few weeks, as if the public were just getting used 
to this strange, new sound. Suddenly it shot to number 
one and Kate Bush had the important distinction of 
having a debut, chart topping single. From then on, 
it snowballed.</p>

<p>The single hit number one not only here but in Europe, 
Japan, Australasia, Canada and South Africa, too!</p>

<p>She collected a clutch of awards including the Tokyo 
Music festival Silver Prize, the coveted Dutch Edison 
award and a heap of Best Female Singer / Songwriter 
Awards from the press. Kate Bush had arrived.</p>

<p><strong> Perfect</strong></p>

<p>Her debut album 'The Kick Inside' stayed in the top 
twenty for months and a few more top singles cemented 
her position as one of our foremost entertainers.</p>

<p>After the second album 'Lionheart' Kate Bush had 
another unique distinction. She was one of the premier 
record sellers in the country . . . yet she had never 
played a live date here.</p>

<p>March was chosen as the month for her tour, and 
preparations for it were shrouded in a secrecy which 
put the Kremlin to shame!</p>

<p>But the concerts were well worth waiting for. Kate 
sang, danced and performed her way through a 
two hour show.</p>

<p>Now it's September and a live EP taken from those 
shows sees Kate Bush back in the charts again.</p>

<p>Her rise to fame has been a shrewd, calculated 
manoeuvre, built on the solid foundations of her 
immense talent.</p>

<p>The long period between the signing of her deal 
and the first single was a joint decision taken by 
various EMI heads and Kate herself. They wanted 
her to concentrate on her songwriting: to write 
less songs, but stronger ones.</p>

<p>At 21 she has achieved more than most performers 
twice her age. And the frightening thing is that this 
is still the early days of her career.</p>
