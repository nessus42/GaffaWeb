<H3>Newcastle Evening Chronicle by James Johnson
</H3>
<P>    THE feverish quality of the      pop world barely intrudes into      the
calm atmosphere of the      large, comfortable family      house on the edge of
the Kent      countryside where Kate Bush      grew up.</P>
<P>    Kate the 19 year-old daughter of a      family doctor, is the singer who
     knocked Abba off the top of the charts      earlier this year with her
first single      &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;</P>
<P>    She has since scored another Top      20 hit and one suspects that her  
   parents have become a little startled to      find that their daughter has
suddenly      become a highly successful pop singer.</P>
<P>    Nevertheless, life at home continues      fairly normally. Although Kate
     has a flat of her own in South London,      she spends much of her free
time at her      parent's house where her brother Paddy      has built a
recording studio in the back      garden thanks to the profits from     
''Wuthering Heights. &quot;</P>
<P>    In the last couple of months, Kate      has travelled to Japan and the
United      States on promotional tours and is due      to go off shortly to
Australia and New      Zealand. Following this trip a new      album will be
released and she will then      prepare for a British concert tour.</P>
<P>    &quot;Of course, I worry about Kate at      times, what mother wouldn't?&quot;
says      Mrs. Bush.</P>
<P>    &quot;But she's a very stable girl and      always seems to know what
she's doing.      She hasn't become affected in the      slightest.&quot;</P>
<P>    Indeed, although Kate Bush has      eased herself into public     
consciousness through a combination      of eerie mysterious songs and a frail, 
    delicate appearance, in person she      comes across as much more like the  
   traditional  girl-next-door.</P>
<P>    She does not go to discotheques or      enjoy parties. Work is her only 
    obsession. &quot;lf I get time off I'd rather      spend it at home,&quot;
she says.</P>
<P>    &quot;I'm rather a down-to-earth      domesticated  person when I'm left
to      my own devices. I really do find things      like cleaning and all that
rubbish very      therapeutic.</P>
<P>    &quot;If I get home with all these thoughts      in my head about what's
coming up      over the next few days. I find that a bit      of cleaning or
washing up makes them      go away.&quot;</P>
<P>    She has also tried to keep in touch with     her old friends, although
she admits her sudden      change of lifestyle over the last nine months could  
     make a point of contact difficult.</P>
<P>    Kate goes on: &quot;My best friend is a     girl I used to know at
school. She is a     telephonist.</P>
<P>     &quot;Whenever I'm free, I'll call up       and she'll come over with
her       husband. I don't sit there and say       'Oh I've just got back from
Tokyo       and you should have seen all the       money around,' and so on. Why
      should she wantant to know about that?</P>
<P>      &quot;I do have a boyfriend at the        moment, but the trouble with
this        business is that you can't really have        a strong, emotional
relationship on a        continuous level because you're not        in one place
for long.</P>
<P>       &quot;It's what you could call on uninvolved        relationship.
He's not in the        music business and sometimes I'll        call him up and
we'll go out somewhere.</P>
<P>       ''I do occasionally miss not being        able to have a close
relationship, but        I can't complain really. I'm just so        lucky to be
m this position of having        so much work.&quot;</P>
<P>       Towards the end of this month        Kate Bush's second album,
Lionheart,        will be released in Britain. The        initial demonstration
tapes were        recorded in her brother Paddy's        studio at her parent's
home and the        album was completed earlier this        month in Nice.
Paddy, 25, will also        be part of her backing band when she        goes on
tour.</P>
<P>       As for the album, Kate explains        that it willill consist of a
mixture of        rock 'n'roll and ballads.</P>
<P>       ''After the success of 'Wuthering        Heights', I was worried that
people        would just think I was simply a        squeaky voice. That single
was quite        bizarre in a way and I was afraid        people just liked it
for the novelty        value rather than for the music.</P>
<P>       &quot;I think the last record, 'Tile `.ian .        with the Child in
his Eves' did a lit al        to get away from that because it was        in a
lower key for a start.</P>
<P>       &quot;It would have been terrible if I'd         had to spend the
rest of my life         squeaking and very sore on the tonsils,         I should
think.&quot;</P>
<P>        Kate admits that her parents have         been highly influential in
her rise to         the top.</P>
<P>         &quot;My father plays that piano and my          mother's Irish --
we all owe a lot to          her because she's very musical and         
everybody in Ireland seems to play          some kind of instrument.</P>
<P>    &quot;They were always behind me writing     and singing. They didn't
push me     exactly, but they didn't discourage        me in any way. It was
really good      because if you get any pressure on      you at that age you're
liable to rebel      in one way or another.</P>
<P>    &quot;I think when things started      happening this year, my mother   
  worried about, you know, maternal      instincts, my little girl in the big
time      and so on.</P>
<P>    &quot;But my parents could see I wasn't      nutty or outrageous and I
could look      after myself. It's been a sort of      graduation for all of us.&quot;</P>
