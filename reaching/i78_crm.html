<P>Letter From Britain</P>
<P>The Shape of Things To Come<BR> by Simon Frith</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>But the most unexpected success of the year Kate Bush. Her single, &quot;Wuthering
Heights,&quot; and album, The Kick Inside, swamp the airwaves; her picture
shines out from every London bus, every underground poster, every empty shop. &quot;Wonderful,&quot;
 the ads say, &quot;mysterious, brilliant, unique.&quot; She's got thick, dark
hair, fuzzily photoed, with narrow eyes and a blank mouth. Not much like Poly
Styrene or Ariana of the Slits, more like the heroine of a 1930's romantic
thriller.</P>
<P>&quot;Wuthering. Heights&quot; is an oddly faithful song of the film of the
book. Kate is Cathy, wandering the moors, calling for Heathcliff; her voice
swoops and spirals like a wuthering bird and what starts out as an operatic mess
ends up as a brilliantly conceived pop single -- not a normal number 1 but a
natural, and with all the advantages of surprise. Who is Kate Bush? Why is
everybody buying  her record? Why isn't she a punk?</P>
<P>It turns out, now the publicity machine has begun to roll, that Kate Bush is
a teenage prodigy singer/ songwriter who was discovered three years ago by Dave
Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Since then, she's been nurtured by EMI, Motown style.
She's been pictured, packaged, imaged, sent to mime school, arranged, rehearsed,
developed, dressed and briefed. Out of nowhere, in Kate's case, means a
portfolio of songs and sights and sounds, pre-tested, guaranteed successful.</P>
<P>Ms. Bush's chart conquests (she will, she will) are a triumph of the
romantic will. Her voice, with its shifts from little girl shrill to young woman
blue, and her songs, with their nervy equations of sex and the soul, are
designed for lonely listening. Unlike most British pop women, Kate Bush hasn't
been designed as cute or brassy or accessible or matey. Her talents are remote,
fragmentary, dreams to sustain her house-bound listeners through the dark
winters to come.</P>
