<BR> Subject: TSW Interviews 
</P>
<P>The main topic of this posting are the various interviews The One And Only
has  done concerning TSW album (both those I've read in magazines and those
which  have been kindly posted to the list). 
</P>
<P>It's almost like reading from a menu. For this album we have: 
</P>
<P>A) the family friend and Oppenheimer story 
</P>
<P>B) the Trio and the dial tone story 
</P>
<P>C) the &quot;first started/last completed&quot; Love &amp; Anger story 
</P>
<P>D) the battle to get Joyce's lyrics story 
</P>
<P>E) the story behind This Woman's Work saga 
</P>
<P>F) and, the incredible favorite, the &quot;my most female album&quot; quote 
</P>
<P>Over and over and over again. With some of these later interviews, I'm
surprised  that text like &quot;Kate yawns loudly&quot; and &quot;Kate loses
consciousness&quot; doesn't start  showing up, she keeps getting asked the same
question so often. 
</P>
<P>I am not a journalist, but I know there are other aspects of this album that
have  not been explored. I don't read a lot of interviews with singers,
songwriters,  musicians, so I don't know whether to attribute this to Kate's
tendency towards  privacy or to unimaginative interviewers. 
</P>
<P>But I remember when HOL came out there were stories about the cover 
photographs, some info on how different parts of the album were technically 
produced, and other such stuff. 
</P>
<P>What happened?

<P>Date: Fri, 26 Jan 90 12:09 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Kate and Interviews 
</P>
<P>[Kate and Interviews:]
</P>
<P> Your &quot;menu&quot; was certainly spot on, Douglas: Kate has surpassed
herself during  the past year in repeating the same answers endlessly and
virtually without variation.  As much as IED would like to lay the blame solely
on the heads of her  interviewers--and they have indeed shown an amazing lack of
knowledge or  imagination, as usual--for the dullness of Kate's answers, it just
isn't possible. Kate  knows that interviews are as much an occasion for the
subject to extemporize as for  the interviewer to ask questions. She could
always change the subject and introduce  new ideas into the conversations, but
she chooses instead to reply by rote to the  familiar questions she is asked. 
</P>
<P>In fact, on many occasions she has deflected a novel question by
interpreting it as  a familiar one, and answering with one of her tried and true
formula responses. It's  sad to say it, but Kate doesn't seem to want to
communicate much with the public,  or to spend more time than is necessary in
the public eye, and as time goes by she is  becoming more and more obvious about
it. 
</P>
<P>Her evasive, bland replies and word-for-word repetition of stock answers are
 perfectly compatible with her dismissals of the possibility of touring: in both
cases  there is an implied conviction that her place is at home and in the
studio, not before  the public, and that her energies are too easily sapped when
misdirected into areas  which she considers to be of secondary importance--like
touring and giving  interviews. 
</P>
<P>Face it, folks--Kate has all but retired, permanently, from the &quot;real&quot;
world. From  here on in, she will probably only appear every seven or ten years
to  promote--perhaps via one or two satellite-distributed interviews--a new
album.  Aside from that we will have to amuse ourselves as best we can with what
 information and materials become available to us. -- Andrew Marvick
