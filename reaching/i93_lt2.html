<P><A NAME="4.1c">Date: Wed, 15 Sep 93 13:58:15 EDT</A> <BR> From: Andrew B
Marvick &lt;abm4@columbia.EDU&gt;<BR> Subject: Sunday London Times Interview
w/Kate Bush 9/12/93    
</P>
<P>Here is a restored edition of the Sunday London Times Colour Supplement 
interview, which was conducted by &quot;Chrissy Iley&quot;. IED quotes Kate's
responses  verbatim, but he has been able to reconstruct Ms. Iley's side of the
interview in its  entirety. The version printed in the London Sunday Times is
drastically edited and  revised by both Ms. Iley and other members of the
Times's staff. You will now be  able to experience the interview as it really
transpired, and this should give you,  gentle reader, a better understanding of
Kate's daily routine. 
</P>
<P>As always in IED's transcriptions, the interviewer's words are not put in
quotes;  Kate's responses are; and IED's explanatory comments are framed in
brackets [ ]. 
</P>
<P>[The scene is a little preview theatre owned by EMI. Ms. Iley, a clumsy, 
large-boned woman extruding a strong smell of sour wool and rum, is shown in to 
meet Kate Bush, who smiles warmly and offers her hand, which Ms. Iley looks at 
suspiciously but does not take. Kate notices with some surprise a uniformed
security  guard, who has followed the journalist into the theatre. Ms. Iley
pointedly ignores  him. Formalities completed, Ms. Iley launches into a
rambling, inarticulate diatribe in  which could be caught only the words:] 
</P>
<P>I should begin by telling you I didn't like it when that nasty EMI guard
searched  my purse out in the hall. I don't appreciate that kind of treatment, I
don't! 
</P>
<P>[The guard points out that he had found several copies of Kate's unreleased 
album missing from the stack in the hall, and that he would appreciate it if the
lady  would allow him to search her bag. Ms. Iley blusters incoherently at this
request,  then with a furtive, evil look around her, changes the subject, while
the guard  continues to watch her:] 
</P>
<P>Somebody tol' me you were, like, a &quot;shy megalomaniac.&quot; Zat true? 
</P>
<P>[Kate laughs, replies good-naturedly:] &quot;Oh, yes! Yes, I like that
description.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Smugly, with a nasty leer]: Personally I've always thought shy was just
another  name for awkward, and megalomaniac just meant spoilt! 
</P>
<P>	[Shocked by this unexpected and gratuitous rudeness from a total stranger,
Kate  smiles politely, says nothing.] 
</P>
<P>Someone tol' me you'd actually got (hic!) conceited enough to make a film [&quot;The
 Line, The Cross, The Curve&quot;]! Tell me it's not true, Katey, eh? Remember
what  a self-absorbed, worthless piece of garbage &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;
was, will  you? Heh, heh, heh! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, it is something like Magical Mystery Tour, but it's not like
that at all. It's not  finished yet, and I hate talking about anything until
it's there. It's like talking to  you about the album if you haven't heard the
tracks. Completely ridiculous.&quot; 
</P>
<P>	[Because Ms. Iley had failed to show up for the scheduled listening session
to  which she, with various other journalists, had been invited, Kate had gone
to the  trouble of having five of the songs played again for Ms. Iley at her
later  convenience, and had patiently rescheduled this interview twice to meet
Ms.  Iley's repeated, unexplained postponements. Kate is now under the 
misapprehension that Ms. Iley had at last heard the five tracks. In fact,
however,  Ms. Iley had passed out in an alcoholic fog shortly into the opening
song, and  consequently now has no memory of hearing any of the new music, which
 explains her next question:] 
</P>
<P>So, Kate, what was going on in your pretty little head when you were writing
 &quot;Minutes to Treasure&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;'Moments of Pleasure'? 
</P>
<P>Whatever. Some kind of lovesong, or what? Silly title, though, ain't it?
[Here Ms.  Iley belches resonantly.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Er, it's just a very personal song. It's to show just how precious
life is and all those  little moments that people give you. And that's how
people stay alive, through  your memories of them.&quot; 
</P>
<P>All right, all right, all right, let's just get on with it, shall we? [Ms.
Iley checks a  standard interviewer's question-list, which her paper had given
her several years  earlier. She depends on this list for inspired questions like
the following, which  she reads in a slow, uncomprehending voice]: What have the
last three years  been like for you? 
</P>
<P>[A staff-member at EMI, who has been sitting nearby, draws Ms. Iley aside
for a  moment, and asks:] &quot;Don't you know that Kate's mother died earlier
this year?  And don't you know that 'Moments of Pleasure' was partly prompted by
the  loss of her mother, as well as the deaths of several intimate and longtime
friends  of hers during the past three years? We gave you all this background
information  earlier!&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Ms. Iley mutters something about having lost the copy of her
background-briefing  on the Tube to work that morning...]
</P>
<P>[Meanwhile Kate is replying politely:] &quot;Well, it hasn't been a very
good time at all,  really. My mother died. Sometimes things have been so bad
that I couldn't even  work. Singing is such a deeply personal thing to do, I
couldn't manage it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Ms. Iley, beginning to catch on, says:] Aw, poor Miss Hoity-toity had a bad
time! I  bet your boy-friend left you, too! Eh? Cat gotcher tongue? I'll take
that silence as  a 'yes'! So lemme ask you this, then, Miss High-and-Mighty Rock
Star -- what  happened to your mother, then, eh? Run off with the cook? 
</P>
<P>[Kate, stunned, still manages a polite smile, and replies:] 
</P>
<P>&quot;She got ill and she died.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Ms. Iley pores drunkenly over the lyric-sheet for several long minutes,
then, as  though she has come up with a truly brilliant and original question,
asks:] 
</P>
<P>So I bet your mum was full of sayings like 'Every old sock meets an old
shoe',  right? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Isn't that a beautiful little saying?&quot; 
</P>
<P>I dunno, wudduzit mean? Izzat the same as 'We seek the teeth that made the 
wounds'? Cuz I know that one. I've heard that one. Yeah. 
</P>
<P>[Kate, by this time suspicious that Ms. Iley is not just drunk and
unprepared, but  insane, as well, decides that perhaps the best thing to do is
to humor her]: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, that's so cute, isn't it? So cute.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[But Ms. Iley is already off to the next question on the list] 
</P>
<P>So what does your father do for a living? How much does he make, anyway? 
</P>
<P>&quot;My father is a doctor.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So what kind of a doctor is he, your father? 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's a personal question.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Had many malpractice cases to settle, lately, has he? Heh, heh, heh! 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's not really about my work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Peering at some notes her colleagues had prepared for her earlier, Ms. Iley
reads  that Dr. Bush had once spoken a few lines on &quot;The Fog&quot;, and
retorts  triumphantly:] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, he features in your work!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not something that I really want to talk about.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I bet you're covering for him, eh? I bet you're always crying to get
what you want  -- you've got an awfully tiny body, I bet you behave jus' like
'daddy's little girl',  am I right or am I right? 
</P>
<P>[Kate does not respond, but still manages to smile politely.] 
</P>
<P>What about &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, that whole gender-switching
thing, eh?  What's the line on that, eh? You a pervert, or something? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, in the song, I wanted to be a man in a woman's body. I thought
it would be  completely astounding, so that we could completely understand each
other.  Because in essence we are so different.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I hear you've got some pretty daft notions about men and women having
different  energies, 'n' that. Dead silly, if you ask me! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I do believe there is a feminine energy and there is a masculine
energy. Some  women have very masculine energies, and the creativity of a lot of
women is  maculine-driven because they are ambitious to speed forward. It's just
a way of  characterizing different motivations for living and behaving.&quot;
[Ms. Iley chuckles to  herself in anticipation of the clever editing she will do
later on to make Kate's  words seem less reasonable...] 
</P>
<P>I bet you love money, though, eh? Heh, heh, heh! Betcha you've got pots and
pots!  [Drool begins to drip from Ms. Iley's mouth.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not really ambitious -- not for money, not for material things.
But I suppose I  am driven by some creative force to keep working. It is these
'feminine'  energies, which are very special, that have been a little neglected.&quot;

</P>
<P>Yeah, I remember your erect nipples poking through your nice tight leotard,
back in  the good old days, eh? That was a nice bit o' fun! That was feminine,
alright!  [More drool.] 
</P>
<P>[Kate, by now ignoring Ms. Iley's gross attempts at innuendo, decides her
best hope  is to continue her own point, and wait to see if any of it is able to
come through  in the finished interview:] 
</P>
<P>&quot;I can understand why in many situations women have found the need to
become  masculine. A lot of my friends feel the feminist movement set women back
a long  way. Man-hating is wrong, but many women are ashamed that they can't
just be  a woman. I think ideally people can be quite androgynous. That can be
exciting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh, exciting, eh? Heh, heh! Right, I gotcha! Like all them bananas and such
in this  'Eat the Music' song, eh? It says 'ere, er... wait a minute...Here!
'All is  revealed/Not only women bleed.' I get it! That's dirty, that is! Heh!
Heh! [Thick  ropes of slobbery goo stream from Ms. Iley's maw as she conjures up
unprintable  images...] 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's not simply a sexual description, actually. It's about how
beautiful men can  be on the inside. I think proper opposites are very exciting.
How could you  possibly experience pain until you knew what laughter was?&quot; 
</P>
<P>	[At this point Kate goes into considerable detail about her ideas,
including some  fascinating points about the song 'And So Is Love', which she
reveals has an  underlying positive message, but Ms. Iley, who has succumbed to
her  drunkenness, slides under her chair and begins to snore. Later she will
write  about this forty-minute gap in the discussion: &quot;Kate then goes into
a discourse  about why the song 'Life is Sad' is incredibly positive, and I'm
afraid she lost  me. I cannot tell whether she is being obtuse on purpose but
suspect that she is  trying to avoid the questions about men which she senses
are coming. There have  been so many wincingly intimate songs about
relationships, I wonder who has  been her muse.&quot; What Ms. Iley actually
said, upon being revived by Kate and the  guard, was:] 
</P>
<P>I'm alright, lemmego! 'ere, I've got another question for you, Miss 
Kate-your-royal-Prigginess! All your songs to date have been nothing but a 
bunch of wet, sentimental lovesongs, 'aven't they? So what's it all about, then,
 eh? Bet you've done it wivvabunch of 'em, am I right? You dirty whore! Tell me,
 then, what are the names of your boyfriends, and what are their phone numbers?

</P>
<P>&quot;That's for me to know and you to find out. I don't really see what
that question  has to do with my work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Hey! You're the one that said your life is your work. Come on, then, spill
the beans! 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that's personal, and I'm here to talk about my work. My
private life I  don't want to let go of. I need to keep it close and tender so
that it is still my  own.&quot; [Even Ms. Iley will later report that Kate,
though unfailingly polite, is  &quot;smiling an assassin's smile;&quot; but
evidently it never dawns on her why.] 
</P>
<P>Well, your songs are all autobiographical, so why shouldn't I ask? How can
anyone  tell where the boundaries are? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I'm telling you.&quot; [Ms. Iley later writes: &quot;She is
unsettlingly polite. If she had  been angry with me there would have been at
least a confrontation.&quot; Apparently  this is intended as a criticism.] 
</P>
<P>I betcha you got it on with Prince, eh? Heh! Heh! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Actually, we never actually talked to each other; we simply exchanged
tapes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh. Well, I bet they were dirty tapes, then, eh? How much did you have to
pay him,  huh? Heh! Heh! 
</P>
<P>[Kate changes the subject:] 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think creative control is incredibly important. If you don't have
that control your  work will be interfered with until it's gone out of your
hands. I was always aware  that things wouldn't be how I wanted them unless I
was willing to fight. You  have to fight for everything you want. Struggle is
important. It's how you grow  and how you change.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Ms. Iley has fallen into another boozy doze, and Kate's words here make it
into  print only through an error by the tape transcriber at the Sunday Times:]

</P>
<P>&quot;I've always been tenacious when it comes to my work, and I became
quickly aware  of the outside pressures of being famous affecting my work. It
seemed ironic that  I was expected to do interviews and television, which took
me away from the  thing that had put me into that situation. It was no longer
relevant that I wrote  songs. I could see my work becoming something that had no
thought in it, of me  becoming a personality, which is never what I wanted. All
I wanted was the  creative process.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Ms. Iley jerks awake here, and shouts:] 
</P>
<P>You're getting old, Kate! You must be in your mid-thirties by now. So tell
us, luvvie,  when are you going to 'ave kids? Better hurry it up, you know,
you're old! 
</P>
<P>[Kate does not reply, but smiles politely.] 
</P>
<P>Oh, I get it! [Ms. Iley sneers:] Your albums are your children! 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. Can you imagine a child which took three-and-a-half years to come
out?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yeah, well, I've got a friend who printed an interview with you where you
yourself  said &quot;I'm tough as nails.&quot; Hah! Gotcha there! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, yes. [Kate squints, the brows knitting together under the short
fringe.] The  journalist -- your friend, you say? -- made that up. I'm strong,
but I'm not 'as  tough as nails.' The two are very different. Quite often people
project their life  onto you. Also in the same piece [four years ago] she said I
said I was as fragile as  a butterfly! People impose their own personalities on
me. I'm surprised you  don't know that. [This pointedly ironic remark actually
gets through to Ms. Iley,  who later reports: &quot;She is so full of contempt
that communication is almost  impossible. Is it just me that she doesn't like to
reveal things to?] 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's quite dangerous to go through life extremely open. In a way you
need an  element of trust, of course; for some people it's just very hard. Fear
is such an  enormous thing in all of us, and I think it stops a lot of rather
nice processes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Come on, Kate, give me something juicy about your family. A childhood
recollection.  You know, like maybe you caught your father doing the jig-o'-life
with your  brother or something, eh? Heh! heh! [Ms. Iley here emits a foul
stench from the  depths of her throat, coughs messily and lapses back into a
sullen silence.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;As a child, I was always impressed by the sea. I think it's completely
stunning. I'd  love to be part of the sea. Wonderful.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I can't even swim! Makes me feel like I'm drowning. Hate the sea! Bollocks
the sea!  Tell me about your private life, dammit! 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's been a difficult three years for everybody. The recession has
affected  everybody so badly...&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Kate stands up to show Ms. Iley out. Ms. Iley will later write, in
conclusion: &quot;Kate's  emotional range is intense, stunted, trapped. Although
she insists she is more  happy than sad, I have not found her sense of humour to
justify this. I have not  found her.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the corridor the security guard insists on looking in Ms. Iley's bag; he 
discovers fifteen pilfered copies of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; CD (&quot;I
wanted something to  remember my visit by, thassall!&quot;) For the Times she
will write: &quot;A dilemma: she  doesn't really want to talk about anything but
her music and I am not allowed to  have the album to listen to...&quot;] 
</P>

</P>
<P>P.S.: IED's editor informs him that he has misidentified a Ms. Ivy, who
works for  the Sunday Times of New London, Connecticut, as 'Ms. Iley,' of the
Sunday London  Times. Should there be any legal inquiries, he hopes this
explanation of an  unfortunate editorial oversight is sufficient. He sincerely
regrets any harm that this  error might have caused...
