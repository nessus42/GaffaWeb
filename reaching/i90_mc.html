</P>
<P>The September 1990 issue of the British magazine Music Collector has an
article  about Kate. The author could have used a better proofreader, but here
it is: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH -- The High Poetess of Rock 
</P>
<P>by Mike Day 
</P>
<P>I have noticed him seven times or more <BR> But he has not seen me. <BR>
He may have seen a girl called by <BR> My name --<BR> But neither he, nor
anyone else will <BR> Ever really see me. 
</P>
<P> A shy, quiet, introverted girl called Catherine Bush wrote these lines for
her  school magazine. Years later, they still illustrate the mystery, the enigma
and the  magic which surrounds Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>After twelve years of recording success, she continues to fly in the face of
 tradition, constantly setting her own standards and making her own rules.
Despite  her highly photogenic looks, this is one pop superstar who'd be
insulted to be seen  as a pin-up. Naive young Catherine has become mature Kate.
Deep, committed and  intense about her work, she's a serious musician who also
exudes charisma and sex  appeal but with Kate Bush the music definitely comes
first. Perhaps that's why she  still appears distant -- even threatening -- to
journalists and media people who seek  to discover the REAL Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS 
</P>
<P>Born on July 30th 1958 at Bexleyheath Maternity Hospital in South East
London to  wealthy parents who were easy-going, openminded and musical. Her
father, a doctor  by profession, was also a keen pianist who constantly filled
the house with music.  Both brothers played in local folk groups and mother had
been an Irish folk dancer.  This all helped to make their home, East Wickham
Farm, a happy and contented  place. Kate even had her own den in the house where
she'd spend hours on her  own or with a select group of friends. The time was
spent writng poetry, painting  butterflies on the walls, and sitting by an open
fire toasting marshmellows. This was  the private world of Kate Bush; a world
often misunderstood by her school-friends,  who thought a loner. Certainly her
school days weren't happy ones. She found it  hard to relax in the traditional
surroundings of St. Joseph's Convent Grammar  School, which she described as a
cruel environment where she learnt to get hurt, but  also learnt to cope with
it. She achieved that largely through writing, pouring out  her deepest pent-up
emotions onto powerful, stark poetry. There was also her  music. 
</P>
<P>From the age of twelve, Kate had been recoding songs at home on her
brother's  tape recorder, and later, a friend of the family who worked in the
music business  played some of them to Pink Floyd's singer and guitarist Dave
Gilmour. He was so  impressed that he paid for her to make some professional
demos, and lost no time  playing them for EMI's Bob Mercer. The company were
impressed enough to sign  her up, but they didn't launch her recording career
immediately because they felt  she was too immature; instead she gained
experience by gigging in South London  pubs with brother Paddy and future
boyfriend Del Palmer. Their band was called  appropriately enough, the K.T. Bush
Band. Around this time, Kate was also given  mime and dance lessons by the
legendary Lindsay Kemp, whose past work included  the Rocky Horror Picture Show
[first I've heard of this --Ed], as well as providing  an early spark to the
imagination of the youthful David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>Those early dance sessions certainly had a lasting effect on Kate, making
her very  aware of music's potential as a visual medium. It's worth noting that
without Dave  Gilmour's perserverance and position of influence, the world might
never have  heard of Kate Bush. On her first album, he is credited with much
thanks and love  for 'rolling the ball' in the beginning, but for the
record-buying public, the  beginning came with one haunting single which
possessed the airwaves in February  1978. 
</P>
<P>Written on the night of a full moon, the eerie and ethereal &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;  had been inspired by Emily Bronte's classic novel of that title.
This was three  minutes of Pop magic that grabbed the hearts of some listeners
-- whilst others  couldn't believe what they were hearing and couldn't bear to
listen to it!  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; certainly was a love or hate it
record. .. . the wailing, freakish  vocals caused some critics to dismiss 19
year old Kate as a one-hit wonder. One music  reviewer categorised her voice as
a cross between Linda Lewis and Macbeth's three  witches! Even John Peel
proclaimed that he couldn't take her seriously. 
</P>
<P>LIONHEART 
</P>
<P>Yet &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was a bold and totally original single
which was only  released because Kate insisted on it. A number of EMI executives
had felt that it  wasn't commercial enought. Ironically, twelve years on, it
remains her only No. 1 hit,  and if not her best song, it's undoubtedly her
best-known. Interestingly, battles over  commercialism and marketing were to
become a regular occurrence between Kate  and her record company, but they were
always resolved peacefully, usually with the  singer getting her way! A typical
example came with the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; single.  EMI wanted the
picture cover to carry a snap of her wearing a thin cotton vest, with  breasts
clearly defined. She vetoed this, but EMI used the photos on posters which 
appeared on buses and billboards all over London. Despite the continued efforts
to  be promoted for her music rather than her looks, Kate has always endeavoured
to  use her image imaginatively and creatively in her promotional videos. She
turned a  few heads on her debut Top Of The Pops appearance, with her
eye-catching shaggy  long hair, and multi-coloured outfit. Looking back later,
Kate described her first TV  appearance as bloody awful.. .. millions of viewers
disagreed! 
</P>
<P>Both &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and Kate's first album, The Kick Inside,
featured a  kite image designed by Kate, but when the album received a poor
response in the  States, EMI again pushed her image to the fore, by completely
revamping the LP  cover for the American market. The Kick Inside was relaunched
with a cover photo  of Kate looking provocative, wearing knee length red socks
and patched jeans. The  back of the album, however was identical to the British
release, with the song lyrics  and kite motif printed over an angry-looking
countryside skyline. The US version of  The Kick Inside is still available on
import. [Note this is a British magazine -- Ed]  (In later years, Kate and her
family gained much more control over her product by  setting up her own
management company which licensed her work to EMI.) 
</P>
<P>Aside from its visual merits, the musical content of The Kick Inside was 
particularly strong and innovative for a debut album. Produced by Andrew Powell,
it  featured early Bush compositions such as &quot;The Man With The Child In His
Eyes,&quot;  the lyrics of which she'd written on the walls of her room at East
Wickham farm, at  the age of fourteen. Bearing in mind her tender years, the
LP's songs were lyrically  daring, obsessed with weird images, mysterious forces
and sensual feelings. 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside peaked at No. 3 in the British LP charts in April 1978, and
her  follow-up album Lionheart (also a top-tenner) was relatively easy to put
together,  because when it came to material, Kate was spoilt for choice. During
the past few  years she'd written some two hundred songs, and with the
confidence gleaned from  her initial success, she was influencing the production
on her records much more.  Lionheart, released in Autumn 1978, has been
described by various critics as a very  English album -- in fact Kate's often
been called a very English artist -- but on this  album she's anything but a
traditional English rose. A Leo by starsign, Kate Bush  the Lionheart adorns the
cover wearing a pantomine lion's skin and sitting on top of  a case in an attic.
The album includes an ironic anthem to her home country, &quot;Oh  England My
Lionheart&quot;, a bizarre theatrical song &quot;Hammer Horror,&quot; (which on
its  single release missed the Top 40 due to limited airplay); and also a bold
kick in the  teeth for the media with &quot;Wow&quot;. Kate has always disliked
being interviewed,  especially about her personaly life, and despite her
new-found success, she'd been  very hurt by some of the negative things which
had been written about her. In  interviews, she developed a habit of over-using
superlatives, especially &quot;amazing,&quot;  and one paper derided her by
claiming that if they'd had a good night out, at EMI,  they'd never say it was
amazing -- they'd just say Yes I had a Kate Bush! 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Wow&quot; she poured all the superlatives into the lyrics of one
song, and made it  to the Top 20 -- the best possible way of hitting back at her
critics. However, one  aspect of Kate's work which definitely won critical
acclaim was her live  performances. Reviews for her stage shows at the end of
the seventies were  positively ecstatic. Her first UK tour featured eccentric,
unique and stunning sets.  The stage was filled with a gigantic kite-shaped
circular screen, used as a backdrop  for films and slides, and Kate made no less
than seventeen costume changes per  show! There's no doubt the audience were
impressed -- the ambitious visual effects  and non-stop all-action dance
routines combined music, art, theatre and dance in a  way that left its audience
spellbound. Melody Maker 's Mike Davis was sufficiently  moved to call it the
most magnificent spectacle he'd ever encountered in the world  of Rock! Kate
finished that tour totally exhausted after 28 two and a half hour shows  in
Britain and Europe. She was so drained both mentally and physically that she's 
resisted touring ever since. 
</P>
<P>BREATHING 
</P>
<P>Record-wise though, the hits continued unabated. In Autumn '79 the live Kate
 Bush On Stage EP reached the Top Ten, and the uncommercial but brave single 
release &quot;Breathing&quot; reached No. 16 in Spring 1980, even though it
tackled the subject  of nuclear war. The lyrics describe a baby which will die
inside its mother's womb,  due to nuclear contamination; part of the video
showed a nuclear explosion which  the BBC refused to screen on Top Of The Pops.
Kate described &quot;Breathing&quot; as her  little symphony, the most ambitious
song she'd ever done, and in later years,  Greenpeace included it on an
anti-nuclear album. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; were other single
successes from the 1980  album Never For Ever, which Kate co-produced. The cover
shows a host of  monster-like creatures falling out of her skirt and the back
shows a collection of  bats -- certainly keeping up the Kate Bush tradition of
eccentricity! Dedicated to  Kate's lighting engineer Bill Duffield, who was
killed in an accident on the first  night of her tour, the album quickly went
gold and achieved two landmarks for Kate;  as well as being her first No. 1 LP,
it was also the first ever chart-topping album by a  British female solo star. 
</P>
<P>A genuine Christmas release, the single &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;
 sustained her success, but Kate Bush was becoming increasingly restless. Her
next  album would see her strike out in an entirely different direction, but to
achieve  creative fulfilment she came close to committing commercial suicide.
She was now  working in her own home studio [no, not until Hounds of Love -- Ed]
and producing  herself. She'd also been inspired by recording with Peter Gabriel
(she sang backing  vocals on his 1980 hit &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;
and would later record a duet with  him). Press rumours abounded that Gabriel
and Bush were lovers, but Kate always  denied the gossip, insisting they were
just good friends. [Gabriel denied it also. --  Ed] 
</P>
<P>Getting back to Kate's new-found ideas, the intense driving beat of &quot;Sat
In Your  Lap&quot; (No. 11 in Summer '81) was only a foretaste of what was to
come. DJs, reviwers,  and fans weren't quite sure what to make of this new
harder sounding Kate Bush.  The emotions and moods she created were as evocative
as ever, but this was raw,  daring music with a cutting edge, and the ensuing
album, The Dreaming, left many  people baffled. Despite being Kate's most
adventurous, ambitious and intelligent  work to date, initially it was only
appreciated by serious music critics and die-hard  fans. The title track dealt
with the plight of the Australian Aboriginals, who'd been  pushed out of their
land by white men. Another track, &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;, detailed  the
ordeal of a Vietcong guerilla preparing to kill a white victim. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was proud of this album. She was giving full reign to her
imagination  and creative abilities, whilst stretching her music to new
boundaries and new levels  of advanced production. EMI on the other hand, were
dismayed! 
</P>
<P>After the single &quot;The Dreaming&quot; peaked at the dizzy height of No.
48 in the  chart, they didn't even bother to plug the next release, &quot;There
Goes A Tenner&quot;.  Consequently it didn't go anywhere and became Kate's first
single to miss the  charts completely. At this time rumours abounded that EMI
were about to ditch the  girl whom they'd greeted with so much enthusiasm a few
years earlier. These  rumours intensified when all her previous singles were
released together in one  collection. Surely there was an air of finality to
this, asked the music press? 
</P>
<P>Kate responded typically, by retreating to her private world, the world
which had  inspired her so many times before. With the help of boyfriend Del
Palmer, she  upgraded her small studio in the old barn of her parents' house. It
was there that  she fashioned a quite superb come-back. 
</P>
<P>DEAL WITH GOD 
</P>
<P>In 1985, Kate's new album Hounds Of Love came straight into the album chart
at  No. 1. Combining the depth of production skills exhibited on The Dreaming
with a  hard (but more commercial) edge to most tracks. The first single to be
lifted from  the LP, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, gave Kate her biggest hit
since &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot;, peaked at No. 3. Even now though, her
instincts wer to take a risk.  Wanting to call the song &quot;Deal With God&quot;,
she was persuaded not to by EMI  executives, who claimed that this would be the
kiss of death to the single, denying it  airplay. For once, Kate relented. 
</P>
<P>The next single from Hounds of Love, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, gave her a
vehicle for what  she later described as her favourite video. Featuring actor
Donald Sutherland, it told  the story of a boy and his father who used a machine
to create rain. The authorities  heard of this, and arrested the father.
Directed sympathetically by Kate [wrong --  Ed], the &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
video was a masterful production, illustrating sadness and  depth of emotion
through a child's eyes. Kate played the part of the boy in the video.  She
appeared to have short hair but this was an illusion; her hairdresser designed a
 special wig for her to wear. 
</P>
<P>1986 was a good year for Kate with three more chart entries, &quot;Hounds Of
Love&quot;  (the LP's title track); &quot;The Big Sky&quot;; and &quot;Experiment
IV&quot;, whilst at the end of the  year, the compilation album The Whole Story
topped the LP charts, and has since  gone one to sell a million copies.
Containing the best of her hits and near misses, this  was a master stroke of
marketing by EMI, the kind of album that many people  bought at Christmas as a
gift. The gatefold sleeve opens out to show cover pictures of  all Kate's
singles and albums, a variety of photos taken at different stages of her 
career, and a close-up of Kate looking wistful and demure against a white
backdrop.  The album succeeded in breaking her in the United States, a territory
which up to  then had resisted her talents. [I'd say what broke her here (if she
can be called  broken) was Hounds Of Love, which peaked at No. 30, rather than
The Whole  Story, which peaked in the 70s. It's true that TWS introduced a lot
more people to  her older stuff than had heard it before. -- Ed] It also
featured a completely new  recording of the debut hit, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

</P>
<P>Despite the adventurous (not to say weird) subject matter which she writes
about  in many of her songs, Kate Bush herself is a quiet, reserved and
remarkably  well-adjusted woman. By all accounts, her fame hasn't changed her.
Indeed, she's  probably more laid-back about the music business now than at any
time during her  career. The press have made their usual attempts to drag up
negative aspects of her  personality, but they've encountered little joy because
Kate appears to have very  few vices, although she admits to being a heavy
smoker and has a passion for  chocolate. Luckily her hobbies of dancing and
running help keep her fit. She also  loves gardening and is a vegetarian. Other
miscellaneous likes include science-fiction  books (not surprising when you
consider the mystical quality of much of her work);  television and cinema;
cats; and folk music. Her favourite recording stars have  mainstream appeal; The
Beatles, David Bowie, Elton John, Steely Dan, and the  aforementioned Peter
Gabriel. Her pet hates include flying and reading books about  herself! One book
she did make an appearance in was Patrick Lichfield's collection  of the World's
Most Beautiful Women. 
</P>
<P>For determined collectors, there are a number of Kate Bush &quot;bootlegs&quot;
available,  although the quality of sound reproduction tends to be weak. The
first Kate Bush  bootleg to be marketed was Wow, a double album of Kate at The
Hammersmith  Odeon, combined with recordings from her first TV special,
broadcast in 1979. Other  notables include Secret Message, a Japanese flexidisc
including messges from Kate  and her brother John; Bush -- The Early Years, a
rare and highly collectable German  recording of her early demos; and What Katie
Did For Amnesty International, a live  recording of Kate and Dave Gilmour at the
Amnesty fundraiser, The Secret  Policeman's Other Ball, 1987. [Actually, it was
The Secret Policeman's *Third* Ball.  -- Ed] Her best-selling videos include
Kate Bush -- The Whole Story, The Singles  File [sic]; and Kate Bush Live At The
Hammersmith Odeon, footage of a concert  recorded in May 1979. There are a
variety of fanzines available on Kate and the  address of her fan club is P.O.
Box 120, Welling, Kent, DA16 3DS. 
</P>
<P>THE STORY SO FAR 
</P>
<P>The end of the eighties saw Kate Bush, now in her early thirties, releasing
her  seventh album, The Sensual World. She described it as her most feminine
yet, and  when compared to say, Hounds Of Love, it's certainly a more relaxed
but perhaps  less striking collection. Having said that, the title track (lifted
as the first single)  made the top ten, notable for its infuriating catchy
rhythm, based apparently on the  literary style of James Joyce. A song written
for the John Hughes (director of The  Breakfast Club ) film This Woman's Work
[Hold on here! That was the name of  the *song*! The movie was She's Having A
Baby. Maybe the reason the writer got  this so egregiously wrong is that the
movie was never released in Britain! -- Ed],  unfortunately got swamped in the
pre-Christmas market, and ended up as only a  minor hit. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World album also sees a new departure for Kate: the use of the 
Bulgarian acapella folk group, Trio Bulgarka but lyrically, the most ambitious
track  has to be &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;. 
</P>
<P>As we enter the nineties, Kate Bush's records appear increasingly out on a
limb.  Although she's always enjoyed a cult following, her current recordings
are in  competition with a youth-dominated world of House, Rap and Hip-Hop
sounds. It'll  be interesting to see if the deep, thoughtful and highly polished
music which she  records can sustain its success as the decade continues. With
Kate Bush, you're  never quite sure what's coming next! Whenever people have
written her off in the  past, she's hit back with her boldest and most
adventurous work. With twelve years  of recording success under her belt, Kate
has emerged from the depths of  middle-class Essex [ESSEX?? Everybody knows
she's from Kent! -- Ed] to a unique  status in terms of critical acclaim and
respect within the music industry. Very few  artists could go as long as her
between album releases, only to see their work come  straight back to the top
again and again. She's consistently topped even her own  high standards, and for
that reason alone, you can't help thinking that Kate Bush,  The Whole Story is
incomplete. The best is yet to come!
