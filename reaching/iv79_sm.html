<P>Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1991 00:31:00 -0800 <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com
(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Saturday Morning Show Interview 1979 
</P>
<P> 28. Saturday Morning Show: Kate is interviewed about Faith Brown's parody
of  Wuthering Heights, (w/Brown video), early 1979 (?). I have only seen part of
this  clip. In it Kate chats briefly with a polite male interviewer, then
watches as Brown's  parody of the Rockflix video (see entry number 2) is shown,
and expresses her  admiration for Brown afterward. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above note by IED.] 
</P>
<P>[Wow is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Is indeed wow and welcome to Kate Bush. Want to get more of that, you'll
have to  go out and buy it, right? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I guess so. 
</P>
<P>I: We've seen a tremendous amount of you on television, of course, in the
last twelve  months, but you're about to escape the television studio and the
recording studio  and undertake your first major British tour, aren't you? Are
you at all  apprehensive about it? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, yeah. Very, very indeed. But I'm very exited as well. It's something
very  new for me and it's something that I've always wanted to do, so it's
great. 
</P>
<P>I: What sort of performance, what sort of show, can the audience expect to
see,  without giving to much away, of course. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, [makes mumbling sounds with hand over mouth. Both Laugh] I can't
say  much except that it's just a concept of my music really. And that we're
just  gonna try and present something visually. 
</P>
<P>I: We can expect it to be theatrical anyway, I think? 
</P>
<P>K: [Slightly abrupt] Well, we'll see. 
</P>
<P>I: Right. It's not the first time of course that you've been in front of a
big audience.  The first time in this country, but you were in - was it in
Japan, or Hong Kong,  or Tokyo? Were was it last year, the big film, the big
festival. Tokyo wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>I: Where you got the silver award. And that was in front of a vast audience,
wasn't  it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, there were a lot of people, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Did you enjoy that? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I did. It was a fantastic experience. 
</P>
<P>I: How did they organize those international song festivals, I've never 
been to one. Is it at all like the Eurovision song contest, as we know it? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I wouldn't be able to compare because it's the first thing I've
done like  that. But the amount of organization was phenomenal, because there
was so many  artists involved. And it was in a very big hall, with a live
orchestra, and the  preparation must have been incredible. 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, but you had a good time anyway? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: The single, which we've just seen you performing there, comes your latest
album  here. [Shows album with light bouncing off of it] Hope it doesn't flare
to much.  [Kate Laughs] Which is Lionheart of course. That's the second single
from there,  and your first two hit singles came from The Kick Inside, which is
your debut  album as well. What's your own personal feelings, as opposed to
maybe your record  companies idea, of taking singles from LPs. Do you think the
record company  actually a tremendously fair deal by that? [Note - In many
countries outside the  U.S., Britain included, it wasn't common practice until
the 70s to release songs on  both albums and singles. For instance, many of the
Beatles hits were never  originally on albums in Britain.] 
</P>
<P>K: Well that's something that, generally, I don't really know about. [Kate
smoothly  changes the subject, slightly!] But I know in my case that I do have
certain ideas  of the songs that I want to come out and I put that to the record
company, and  they think about it, and obviously they have things they want to
put out, and we  come to an agreement. [Hate to keep barging in, but note, that
in every  documented case, the company comes to agree with Kate's idea, and not
the  other way around!] 
</P>
<P>I: You come to an agreement between yourselves? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: And of course Wuthering Heights was the record which really kicked it all
off for  you, about a year ago. There was a tremendous parody of that done by
Faith  Brown, which we are going to see in just a moment. Did you enjoy that
when you  saw it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I thought it was incredible. I think she's a genius. 
</P>
<P>I: Alright, lets look at it again over here. 
</P>
<P>[Faith Brown's Wuthering Heights parody is played. Audience laughs.] 
</P>
<P>K: Amazing. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, you had a smile at that? How did the technique, your own technique,
actually  evolve? The one that is being parodied there by Faith Brown, who in
fact is a  guest in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>K: I'd just like to say that I think the amount of research [that] she must
have done.  I mean, she must have watched that video so many times, because the
movements  are just... they're better than mine, you know, even when she falls
over, it's  great. 
</P>
<P>	 But that happened, really, through meeting a man called Lindsey Kemp, who
was  very theatrical, and a mime artist. And he just turned me on to the idea of
 movement being extremely expressive and that's what I try to do, I try to get
the  movement [??? in place?] 
</P>
<P>I: You're about to go out on a concert tour of theatres. But a lot of
ladies, sometime  in there career, get pushed towards the glamour end of the
market, the cabaret  circuit. Does that thought abhor you at all? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Or appall you I should say. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I'm really not into cabaret, I must admit. 
</P>
<P>I: No. So what's new in 1979 after the tour, another album presumably. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, and I've gotta write the songs. 
</P>
<P>I: Great. 
</P>
<P>K: So that's going to take some time. 
</P>
<P>I: Well thank you for taking time out to join us this morning, Kate. All the
best with  the concerts, at the Palladium. I hope to see your there. Alright? 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: Smashing, thank you very much indeed. 
</P>
<P>K: Take care. 
</P>
<P>I: I will.
