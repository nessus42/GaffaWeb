BST <BR> Subject: Article in CD Review Len Brown Dec. 1989
</P>
<P>Some time ago I promised to type in the article from CD review. As I have
not  seen anyone else do it - here it is. Unfortunately, it is only a shorter
rewrite of Len  Brown's article in NME 7/10/89 (transcribed earlier by IED) but
I will include it for  the sake of completeness since Brown's text surrounding
Kate's quotes is different. 
</P>

<P>Positive Female Energy 
</P>
<P>Four years. Is it really that long since Hounds of Love? 
</P>
<P>Len Brown asks Kate Bush why. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I find it extraordinary that people should want to write about me when
I do so  little. I just pop out and do an album and go away again.&quot; Kate
Bush doesn't really  behave like your average pop star. While most performers,
addicted to the limelight,  either rush out records at regular intervals and/or
court publicity in the popular  media, Bush goes out of her way to avoid
attention. &quot;Reclusive&quot; seems something of  an understatement. 
</P>

<P>&quot;It's healthier for me not to indulge in being a famous person,&quot;
she explains,  quietly. &quot;It's ridiculous, there's absolutely no reason why
I should be at all, other  than I make records.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And they're increasingly infrequent too. Tears For Fears may have spent the
last  couple of years struggling with their art in the studio but Orzabal and
Smith seem  almost prolific by comparison with Kate. It's been four years since
the critically  acclaimed Hounds of Love adventure and that followed cold on the
heels of The  Dreaming three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>But now The Sensual World is with us, complete with successful title-track 
single, and it seems that however much she likes to distance herself from the 
business, Kate Bush's music still returns to challenge and provoke and rise
above the  tide of mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>Violinist Nigel Kennedy, who appears on the new release, recently described
Kate  Bush as one of the few geniuses in modern music. And certainly, looking at
past and  present creations, there's a sense of timelessness about her music;
she doesn't  second guess the public or depend on what's fashionable at any
particular moment  in time. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I found the writing very difficult on this,&quot; she admits candidly.
&quot;I didn't know  what I wanted to say or how to treat the songs and make
them sound differently;  whether to get outside musicians in to do something or
just go away and think. A lot  of it is jigsawing. I'd get to the point where I
couldn't write, where I was sick of  the songs. The problem is holding on to
that energy level. 
</P>
<P>She speaks without arrogance, almost without confidence. The business of 
promoting and publicising her art is something she finds embarrassingly
difficult. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't really see myself as a performer and that's hard for me when I
have to  come out and expose myself and be the saleswoman of the hour. I've been
almost  me for the last couple of years, but in the last two weeks I've been
aware of people  treating me as what seems to be a very famous person. It's
totally surreal, going into  an isolated way of working three or four years at a
time, then coming out and having  everyone looking at you as if they know you.&quot;

</P>
<P>Sometimes it's hard to reconcile this small, henna-haired 30 year-old with
the  received images of Kate Bush; the marketed blend of eroticism and innocence
that  helped rocket her to fame in the late 70's and early 80's, through the
likes of  Wuthering Heights, Wow, Babooshka, Army Dreamers, and Breathing. Her 
reputation from the remarkable Kick Inside debut through to 1982's The Dreaming 
was built not only on original compositions but also her presentation as a
theatrical  performer. 
</P>
<P>But, in the decade after she last performed live, Kate Bush has grown up and
 away from girlie things. The Hounds of Love saw her developing lyrically,
musically  and technologically, particularly with it's intriguing &quot;Ninth
Wave&quot; concept  second-half. And while The Sensual World in many ways is
built firmly on rootsy  contributions from Celtic musicians such as Davy
Spillane and Alan Stivell (plus the  extraordinary vocal harmonies of Trio
Bulgarka), it's naturally an even more mature  creation than what's gone before.

</P>
<P>&quot;Someone said that in the teens you get physical puberty and between 28
and 32  mental puberty,&quot; she suggests. &quot;Let's face it you've got to
start growing up when  you're 30. It does make you feel differently. I feel very
positive having gone through  the last couple of years.&quot; 
</P>
<P>According to Kate, now in complete charge of her projects (aided by
long-term  intimate Del Palmer and multi-instrumentalist brother Paddy), The
Sensual World  contains &quot;the most positive female energy&quot; in her work
to date. It's a belief born out  in the title track which was inspired by Molly
Bloom's very erotic and sensual  stream of consciousness in James Joyce's
Ulysses: &quot;Mmh, yes/ Then I'd take the  kiss of seedcake back from his
mouth/ Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's the idea of Molly escaping from the author, out into the real
world, being the  real human rather than the character, &quot;stepping out of
the page into the sensual  world&quot;. 
</P>
<P>It reflects Bush's own sense of maturity, her growing freedom from the
limits  imposed on her early work by inexperience, lack of confidence, ignorance
and  available technology. Tracks like Deeper Understanding and The Fog
illustrate this  development; the idea that Kate Bush no longer wishes to be
seen as a child but  regarded as a serious woman artist. And perhaps she's
trying to convince herself at  the same time. In The Fog her father, Dr. John
Bush, tells her: &quot;just put your feet  down child/ cos you're all grown up
now&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Growing up for most people is just trying to stop escaping,&quot;
suggests Kate,  &quot;looking at things inside yourself rather than outside. But
I'm not sure if people ever  grow up properly. It's a continual process, growing
in a positive sense.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Of course, she's always been a serious thinker in her music. And again,
within  The Sensual World, difficult subjects are tackled, such as relationships
under stress  (Between A Man And A Woman), fears of childbirth (This Woman's
Work, written  for John Hughes' film She's having A Baby), and repressed
emotions (Love And  Anger). Plus there's Head's We're Dancing, a dark chilling
creation compared to  its more positive bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The idea came from a family friend years ago who'd been to dinner and
sat  next to this really fascinating guy, who was so charming that they sat all
night  chatting and joking. Next day he found out it was Oppenheimer and this
friend was  really horrified because he despised what the guy stood for. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was intrigued by this idea of being so taken with a person until you
knew who  or what they were and then completely changing your attitude. Then it
turned into  this story of a girl in 1939 being at a dance and this guy coming
up, cocky and  charming, and she dances with him. Then, a couple of days later,
she sees in the  paper it was Hitler. Complete horror; she was that close,
perhaps she could've  changed history.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's a song firmly in the Bush tradition, dating back to Wuthering Heights
via  Army Dreamers, of immersing herself in a story, breathing life into it and
conveying  the emotions of the participants. However chilling like the rest of
The Sensual World  it's an honest, open, accessible song. 
</P>
<P>Rocket's Tail was inspired by Kate's cat: it's also a celebration of the
transient  beauty of a firework's life; &quot;It's also about how people see
things from different  standpoints. Those with a negative outlook see only the
fizzle-fizzle while others see  the celebration of the moment, the 'YEEAAAHHHHH!&quot;

</P>
<P>Walk Straight Down The Middle is &quot;about following extremes when really
you  want to plough this path straight down the middle. I'd like to think of
myself as  holding the centre course whereas really I'm being thrown from one
end of the  spectrum to the other and taking off all the time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>After four more years in the wilderness, punctuated only by the Peter
Gabriel  collaboration Don't Give Up, several charitable outings and The Whole
Story singles  compilation it's apparent that Kate Bush is stronger, more
original, more  independent than before. The Sensual World may not have the
commercial  obviousness of her early work, or the state-of-the-art high-tech
command of  Hounds of Love, but it's truly a work of &quot;positive female
energy&quot; and, above all, a  labour of love. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love is a wonderful and powerful thing,&quot; concludes Kate. &quot;In
many ways nearly  every song I've ever written is a love song. It's very
important to try and learn to  love people as much as you can but we all get so
scared. It's only when people are at  a point in their lives when they get such
shocks that they take it as it really should  be. The rest of us just seem to
piss about!&quot; 
</P>
<P>There is a small black and white pic of Kate with the sand in her hand from 
TSW poster, and a colour one by J C Bush - head and shoulders, with Kate in a
blue  floral blouse or dress. 
</P>
<P>Be seeing you. Neil Calton
