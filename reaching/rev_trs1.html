ICE Aug. 1993 
</P>
<P>On another point, I got my latest ICE mag (#77, the August 93 issue) anyway
they  have the following artical!! ... 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH/STEVIE NICKS: No, they're not recording together, but these two 
rock divas have separate new albums scheduled for mid-September release.
Penciled  in first, on September 7, is Stevie Nicks' new 'Street Angel'. ...
[stuff about Stevie  deleted to keep this a KaTe review] 
</P>
<P>Presently slated to arrive a week later, on September 14 from Columbia, Kate
 Bush's new 'The Red Shoes' album is being called her most accessable,
commercial  album to date by all who have heard it. On board to help out are
guest luminaries  Eric Clapton, Prince, Jeff Beck and David Gilmore, generally
appearing on one track  apiece. The albums 12 original compositions were
recorded primarily at Bush's home  studio, making it a self-produced effort,
with strings and bass reportedly overdubbed  at Abbey Road studios in London. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's more commercial than anything I've heard Kate do,&quot; says one
insider who's  heard the album. &quot;There are certainly two - if not more -
top ten singles on it,  certainly for the U.K., and that's based on a few
people's opinions.&quot; Another closely  involved source tells ICE, &quot;Certainly
the two lead cuts, 'Eat The Music' and  'Rubberband Girl,' are as accessible as
anything she's done in ... well, maybe  forever.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The complete track listing for 'THe Red Shoes' consists of: &quot;Rubberband
Girl,&quot;  &quot;And So Is Love,&quot; &quot;Eat The Music,&quot; &quot;Moments
Of Pleasure,&quot; &quot;The Song Of Solomon,&quot;  &quot;Lilly,&quot; &quot;The
Red Shoes,&quot; &quot;Top Of The City,&quot; &quot;Constellation Of The Heart,&quot;
&quot;Why  Should I Love You?&quot; and &quot;You're The One.&quot; The first
single planned is &quot;Eat The  Music,&quot; with the CD single also containing
a remix of the song plus another track.  The cover of 'The Red Shoes' depicts,
appropriately, ballet shoes up on points,  hand-tinted red, with a &quot;stormy
background&quot; behind them. Bush is also working on  what's being called a &quot;movie&quot;
in support of the album.

<P>I got this from &quot;CoverStory&quot;, some entertainment rag that comes
with my local  paper: 
</P>
<P>`Red Shoes' on disc 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is the title of Kate Bush's latest album,
scheduled for release  Oct. 5. It's a tribute to the late film director Michael
Powell, who the English singer  met a few years before his death. However, the
first single, &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; will hit  alternative radio stations a
month before that. Bush is also directing, singing and  starring in a one-hour
film based on the album. Co-starring with Bush are &quot;The  Crying Games's&quot;
Miranda Richardson and mime artist Lindsay Kemp. 
</P>
<P>I never heard the bit about Lindsay Kemp on here before! That should be
great!

</P>
<P>The interest in Kate Bush's new album has started -- maybe. The latest news 
about Columbia seemingly postponing the album until January is certainly very 
depressing. However, for what it's worth, here's something from Billboard 
magazine's current issue (Sept. 11). It's from the column &quot;The Beat&quot;,
by Melinda Newman: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush serves up her usual sensual sounds on 'The Red Shoes,' her
first  album in four years. With a voice that could make angels cry, Bush plays
the role of  willing but woeful supplicant on the bouncy 'Rubberband Girl,' and
the hopeful  romantic on the dreamy 'Top Of The City.' Her girlish voice, heavy
with passion,  drips all over 'And So Is Love,&quot; while the organ-drenched,
throbbing ballad 'You're  The One' sounds like the kind of song Prince would die
for. The Columbia Records  release arrives Oct. 5&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, maybe that last sentence is no longer true. We'll see.

<P>from Gavin, Sept. 17 -under AAA new releases.... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eat The Music&quot; (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>Anyone remember the scene from the film &quot;Women In Love&quot;, where
Rupert  (Alan Bates) equates the eating of a raw fig to the sexual act? Kate
Bush, always one  to analyze the tumultuous roles of men and women, draws a
similar analogy. With  the whole album delayed until January, this EP will have
to tide us over until the  new year, I like the modern Celtic bounce. 
</P>
<P>under alternative new releases (and entered the Gavin alt. chart @ #42 -
most  added w/ 24 adds) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eat The Music&quot; (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush returns after a rather long absence w/ the calypso-flavored &quot;ETM&quot;.
 Although the calendar says summer is just about over, this breezy number
inspores  vivid memories of those warm, relaxing days on the beach, and is the
perfect  antidote to the back-to-the-grind-blues many of us experience this time
of year.  Kate's album has been pushed back until the end of January in order to
 synchronize its release w/ her new movie, so don't wait for a retail street
date to  start playing this one. - Linda Ryan 
</P>
<P>in this weeks CMJ (page 4??) full color add for ETM - the cover of the
single w/  wording.. ETM  the 1st song from her long-awaited new album &quot;TRS&quot;.
See the music  come to life in her new short film &quot;The Line, The Cross, The
Curve&quot;. The fast is  over. 
</P>
<P>these are the most recent reviews I've seen in the trades. 
</P>
<P>our rock music director said that his Sony rep said that they were
reconsidering  moving the release date to Nov. (pushed back due to the video).
so, I'd say that it  looks like Nov. for a release date. 
</P>
<P>we just received another copy of TRS on cassette @ the station (in a mass 
mailing). any of U lucky enough to work @ a radio station... start looking (came
in  Tuesday). = )  IMHO the best tracks are TRS (like playing this one @ full
blast &amp; bop  around the rm), MOP (makes me cry - my mom always says &quot;every
pot has a lid&quot;  kind of like KaTe's mom but different ; ) ), and Top of the
City. it's a different  release (again). 
</P>
<P>Oh, one of the lines in TRS is.. &quot;And this curve... it's your smile...
and this  cross... it's your heart... and this line... it's your path&quot;.

<P>KATE BUSH Eat The Music (5:08)

</P>
<P>Glimpse into &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is a kooky blend of delicate Celtic
melodies and  breezy Caribbean rhythms. Fleshed out by swooping support vocals
and a glistening  horn section, track shows Bush at her most vocally relaxed.
She has, gratefully, put  her brooding poetry on temporary hold, in favor of
more playful verbiage. Track is  excellent for alternative and album rock
formats, with solid potential for an AC  [adult contemporary] crossover. Check
out the non-album cover of Elton John's  &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; on the
flipside.

nbc@inf.rl.ac.uk <BR> Subject: Q Magazine review of The Red Shoes Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>The November issue of Q Magazine has a review of The Red Shoes. For those 
interested it is shown below. Elsewhere in the mag they also have a copy of a 
clipping from an unnamed British newspaper which claimed that Kate was 
provisionally booked to appear at the Savoy nightclub in Clacton depending on
how  well Rubberband Girl did! For those in the US who don't know where Clacton
is -  don't worry neither do most people in the UK! Unlikely to have any
substance.

<P>There is also a full page ad in Q for the new album featuring part of the
front  cover and thumbnail pics of all the other albums. 
</P>
<P>Neil 
</P>
<P>SHELTERED 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush balancing precariously between spiritual and flossy-headed. 
</P>
<P>Initially somewhat shrill and unimpressive, The Red Shoes improves 
immeasurably after repeated plays over a long period of time, gaining solidity
at odds  with disparate musical strategies. Though it opens with the unassuming,
direct  singleRubberband Girl - Bush lamenting her inelasticity and finding some
 compensation in vocal bungee-jumping on the coda - it soons finds its natural
centre  with And So Is Love, the first of several tracks dealing, in an
unfocussed,  woolly-mystical manner, with the connections between love and the
abstract,  spiritual nature of creativity. Eric Clapton chips in a few taut
guitar stabs over a  gentle keyboard pulse, while Bush asks vague rhetorical
questions: &quot;And whatever  happens/What really matters?/It's all we've
got/Isn't that enough?&quot;, that sort of  thing. 
</P>
<P>It's her most religious album: &quot;Your name is being called by sacred
things/That  are not addressed nor listened to/Sometimes they blow trumpets,&quot;
she claims on Big  Stripey Lie, a rhythmic sound-collage on which the fiddling
poltroon Nigel Kennedy  contributes deft strokes. He's also on Top of the City,
where Bush's Achilles heel,  her sheltered sensitivity, is paradoxically her
greatest strength: &quot;I don't know if I'm  closer to heaven, but it looks
like hell down there&quot;. From anyone else this would  seem a blandly cynical
acknowledgement of supposed urban spiritual barrenness but  her very
unworldliness gives it an odd authenticity. 
</P>
<P>The same is almost true of Moments Of Pleasure, the closest the album comes
to  old-style Kate Bush, with solo piano, string arrangement and whimsy overload
 carrrying a private lyric whose impenetrable references to &quot;Teddy,
spinning in the  chair at Abbey Road&quot; and her mother's contention that &quot;Every
old sock finds an old  shoe&quot;, renders the song too solipsistic to transmit
beyond her immediate circle. 
</P>
<P>Eat The Music is a jolly trifle which blends South American flavours,
courtesy of  Justin Vali and Paddy Bush's rhythmic valiha guitars, with a
general township-jive  bounce, as Kate stretches a frankly baffling
fruit/sex/music metaphor to snapping  point. The ethnic style seems corny here,
as opposed to the title track, which uses  the valiha as the hypnotic heart of
an insistent rolling rhythm in which Paddy's  &quot;musical bow&quot; adds
didgeridoo-like reverberation, and his whistles a celtic jig flavour. 
</P>
<P>It's the album's most fulfilled piece, and a more convincing application of
the  spiritual theme than the flossier-headed notions - mainly courtesy of
George  Gurdjieff - which litter Lily and The Song Of Solomon. Bush says in the
latter,  &quot;Don't want your bullshit/Just want your sexuality&quot; - though
she seems to have an  apparently boundless appetite for the former. 
</P>
<P>Along with Clapton and Kennedy, there is a distinguished cast adding their 
signatures to selected trakcs. As before, The Trio Bulgarka add their
open-throat  harmonic poignance to a number of songs, including the closing
You're The One, on  which Jeff Beck, tense as ever solos and Procol Harum
organist Gary Brooker pours  waves of whiter-shade-of-Hammond organ into the
chorus - so effectively that Bush  is driven to quote a line from that most
evocative song. 
</P>
<P>The most full-bloodied collaboration of all is Why Should I Love You? 
-co-arranged with Prince, who does most of the rhythm section and chips in
backing  vocals along with The Trio Bulgarka and, er, Lenny Henry. In an album
dominated  by the idea of &quot;soul&quot; as a creative force, this track comes
closest to the actuality of  soul as a musical style. 
</P>
<P>As a whole, The Red Shoes is more musically varied than thematically, as
Bush's  constant returning to the links between love, spirituality and
creativity become  wearing. In compensation, there's a rich pan-global tapestry
woven here in which  the textures and designs from distant cultures are being
used not for effect, but for  the way they express an emotional truth beyond
mere words.

1993 (?) 
</P>
<P>I know that the VOX review of the new KaTe album has already being 
mentioned but here it is typed out in full. 
</P>
<P>The review appeared below a picture of KaTe from the 'This Woman's Work'

</P>
<P>(APOLOGIES IF SOMEONE HAS ALREADY BEATEN TO THIS). I'll try and  type in the
interview as well. 
</P>
<P>SHAKE YOUR BOOTIES 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH The Red Shoes (EMI EMD 1047) 
</P>
<P>Think of the most unlikely pop collaborators you can imagine. Now double
them.  Forget it, because Ms Bush got there before you: Lenny Henry, Prince,
Eric Clapton,  the Trio Bulgarka, Nigel Kennedy, Jeff Beck... wot no Michael
Gorbachev then?  Four years after 'The Sensual World', Kate's musical vision is
reassuringly bonkers  and ambitious as ever. Why else record a concept album
loosely based around  Michael Powell's classic 1948 ballett movie of the same
name? 
</P>
<P>This mad-scientist approach has consistently staved off the mid-life crisis 
afflicting so many of her contemporaries, but this time Kate dances dangerously 
close to the tranquil cul-de-sac inhabited by Peter Gabriel and Annie Lennox. 
Indeed, mid-tempo session-funk like 'Rubberband Girl' or 'Constellation Of The 
Heart' are rigid and sterile enough not to sit happily on recent Gabriel albums,
only  saved by odd flashes of that distinctively flinty, heart stopping warble.

</P>
<P>While previous outings harnessed studio technology to Kate's maverick whims,
 much of 'The Red Shoes' sounds imprisoned by it. Most engaging and sparse 
piano-and-string ballads like 'You're The One', a lovelorn blow-out, with a 
desperate edge. Earthly synthetic calypso 'Eat The Music' suggests splitting men
 open like a pomegranates, the beautifully breathy confessional 'Why Should I
Love  You' finds Lenny Henry mimicking co-author Prince, while the stomping
title track  bashes out a jarring cousin of Bowie's 'Jean Jeanie' riff, but any
Grand Plan is  conspicuously absent. Considering Kate may just be our last
remaining pop genius,  'The Red Shoes' ultimately adds up to less than the sum
of its unorthodox parts. (7  out of 10).

King o' Pain &lt;labspm@emoryu1.cc.emory.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: Details Review
Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>Since everyone else is typing in Kate reviews/articles, I thought I would do
the  same. So, here's the review of The Red Shoes from the Nov. issue of Details
 (Nirvana's on the cover): 
</P>
<P>With her last two albums, 1985's The Hounds of Love and 1989's The Sensual 
World , Kate Bush gradually cast off her established image. Remember that dippy 
English ingenue who said &quot;wow&quot; too often and who launched her career
in her teens  by rewriting Wuthering Heights as an overblown three-minute pop
operetta? She  went on to create her own serene pop dimension, where subtle
melodies and sure  rhythms stabilize the personal obsessions and psychodramas.
Much of TRS is an  unexpected return to Earth. There are terrestrial guests
galore (including Prince,  Eric Clapton, and classical violinist Nigel Kennedy),
but their contributions tend to be  unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>More importantly, Bush avoids setting an overall tone for TRS : Instead, she
skips  freely through musical idioms. &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; is playful
funk; &quot;Eat the Music&quot; is  frothy calypso; &quot;Constellation of the
Heart&quot; feeds off a pure 1979 Chic Organization  groove. And for those who
think Kate is at her best when sounding as though she's  sorting through secrets
in a dusty attic, there is the moving private scrapbook  &quot;Moments of
Pleasure&quot; and the elegiac &quot;You're the One.&quot;  All this weaving to
and  fro leaves her frisky: &quot;Eat the Music&quot; is also an extended sexual
metaphor. &quot;Split the  banana/ Crush the sultana,&quot; she
unsympathetically concludes. Then on &quot;The Song of  Solomon&quot; she
announces: &quot;Don't want your bullshit, yeah/ Just want your sexuality.&quot;
 Perhaps. But anyone who has followed Kate Bush's exquisite, precious conceits
for  the last fifteen years may find it hard to believe that she wouldn't like a
little bit of  lovingly crafted bullshit thrown in-just for good measure.

UK04160@ukpr.uky.edu <BR> Subject: TRS review in Nov. &quot;Musician&quot; 1993

</P>
<P>The November issue of &quot;Musician&quot; has a short review of THE RED
SHOES. The  article features a small photo of the cover, but no matrix numbers
or other such info.  Here's the transcription: 
</P>
<P>If you've pegged Kate Bush as a dreamy cosmic spirit, don't miss the climax
of  THE RED SHOES, where the stunning &quot;You're the One&quot; renews the
tradition of  brazenly pitiful love songs. Though this torchy ballad features
some of her most  powerful singing, not to mention vintage Jeff Beck, who
contributes the sort of  passionate lead work rarely found on his own records
anymore, all pales next to  Bush's gut-wrenching sign-off, a strangled shriek of
pain that might prompt calls to  911. 
</P>
<P>The rest of this fevered meditation on the meaning of it all isn't as
wonderfully  raw or direct, but desperate impulses abound. Exploring the terrain
of the heart in  her hyperdramatic way, Bush argues that romance is all we have,
even if life stinks  (&quot;And So Is Love&quot;), so there's no reason to hold
back (&quot;Eat the Music&quot;), that being  true to your emotions provides the
one sure defense against the darkness (&quot;Lily&quot;), so  don't be scared (&quot;Constellation
of the Heart&quot;); and follow those desires (&quot;Big Stripey  Lie&quot;)
even if they lead to perdition (&quot;The Red Shoes&quot;). 
</P>
<P>Between the theatrical arrangements and aggressively intimate vocals, Bush
has  clearly labored to do justice to the soul's storms. Mostly, she succeeds. &quot;The
Song of  Solomon&quot; finds Bush imitating a crazed angel, shrilly singing, &quot;Don't
want your  bullshit/Just want your sexuality&quot; in a memorable collision of
the carnal and holy.  Just when preciousness threatens to overflow, she tests a
more conventional  alternative that validates her wacky extremism: &quot;Why
Should I Love You?&quot;, a funky  little rocker, featuring heavy Prince
involvement. It's fun and catchy, but it's not  Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>Thus, let us hail this woman who stops at nothing in pursuit of inner
truths, even  to point of imitating the sound of a stretching rubberband in &quot;Rubberband
Girl.&quot;  And, above all, unleashes that dreadful howl at the end of &quot;You're
the One&quot;.  Awesome!

<P>Kate Bush: Eat the Music 
</P>
<P>(by Tony Mulligan) 
</P>
<P>After four years since her excellent &quot;Sensual World&quot; album, 'Eat
the Music,' the  first track from her as yet unreleased new album &quot;The Red
Shoes&quot; is something of  an uneventful foray into radio friendly nonsense
that is thankfully a rarity in her  otherwise innovative career. All is not lost
however as track three on this single, 'Big  Stripey Lie' re-affirms my faith in
her songwriting prowess. A brooding mood  landscape reminscent of her &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; period it is certainly the highlight of  this otherwise mediocre
product. All the same I eagerly await the release of &quot;The  Red Shoes&quot;
as I think Kate needs at least forty minutes to get her beautiful sublime 
message across. I'm sure that it will yield some classic moments as each of her
seven  previous albums have.

<P>Picked up a complimentary copy of &quot;REQUEST, the new music magazine&quot;

they  included a review of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, which I include in this
post w/o permission. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH <BR> THE RED SHOES <BR> (COLUMBIA) <BR>
</P>
<P>Over her 15-year career, Kate Bush has maintained a high level of artistry
in an  increasingly rugged music world. An extraordinary vocal range and grand
songwriting ambition are her trademarks, and she's combined them with a passion
for  dance and drama to become a serious filmmaker as well.

<P>Although she's widely admired, Bush has not always been well-liked or 
understood outside her native England. Her success at creating a surreal
artistic  refuge means she could thrive indefinitely as a precious cult figure.
But to attain a  stature in line with her estimable range and talent, she needs
to break out of h er  own world and enter ours. 
</P>
<P>On The Red Shoes , she crashes through that barrier with grace and
distinction.  Without abandoning her distinct style, Bush has matured from a
fuzzy opera dro  pout into a stepsister of American soul music. Accordingly, her
new lyrics are less  daunting, more emotionally stimulating. Oh, she's still
trying to take us to other  worlds through her words and music, but this time
she's begun her journey from a  point where listeners can follow along. 
</P>
<P>The finest example of this may be &quot;Top of the City&quot;, and update of
the Drifters'  &quot;Up on the Roof&quot;: &quot;I don't know if I'm closer to
heaven, but it looks like Hel l down  there/Take me up to the top of the city,
and put me up on the angel's shoulders&quot;.  From the screaming buildup to the
pleading chorus, the song's romantic yearning  and suicidal symbolism offer
vocal drama as it's rarely done anymore. It's the kind  of love and anger Bush
merely sang about on 1989's The Sensual W orld . 
</P>
<P>On the very next track, &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;, she raises the heat
even more. In  the past, Bush has projected a strange virginal persona that
seemed slightly u nreal  and untouchable. But here, over the thrumming of a
classical harp, she puts her  desires in no uncertain terms: &quot;Don't want
your bullshit, yeah/Just want your  sexuality/Don't want excuses/Write me your
poetry in motion/Write it just for me,  yeah/And sign it with a kiss.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The way Bush can take something primal and give it a sublime quality is just
 another aspect of her regained compositional strength. In the '80s, after Bush
dis  covered synthesizers and retreated to her country home studio, she seemed
to  overthink her songs, piling up layers of synths that obscured her
personality and m  essage.  The Red Shoes is a complete reawakening: colorful,
uplifting, dynamic, and  pulsing with sensuality. Though there's a harder
surface to much of the album,  Bush stands out front sm oothing the edges. And
in the quieter moments, she allows  a point-blank view of her own complexity and
expressive dexterity that's simply  breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>That combination of delicacy and assertiveness works wonders on the 
house-music hymn, &quot;Why Should I Love You&quot;, a smashing collaboration
with  [Symbol that is Pri nce's new name: JW]. Though the two might seem like
stylistic  opposites, the results show they're made for each other. She has the
artistic and  spiritual inte grity he craves, but he gives her the physical
strength she needs to get  her message over. Bush's previous forays in ballet
may have something to do with it,  b ut this song really moves. 
</P>
<P>Interesting enough, the [Prince Symbol] collaboration is followed by the
weary  heartbreak of &quot;You're the One&quot;, which features the lead guitar
of Jeff Beck. Any  resemblence to &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; is probably
intentional, but Bush and Peter  Gabriel's &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; made
unadorned devotion fashionable years before Si  nead O'Connor. And any
resemblence to &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; is due to the  presence of
Procol Harem keyboardist Gary Brooker. 
</P>
<P>Believe it or not, those three highlights are all secondary tracks on a
bountiful  disc that opens with four eclectic pop songs, ranging from bright
synth-rock t o the  bounce mock-mariachi beat of &quot;Eat the Music&quot;.
They're balanced by two gorgeous  slow numbers, &quot;And So Is Love&quot;, and &quot;Moments
of Pleasure&quot;, which are among the  six songs that accompany Bush's new
film, The Line, The Cross, The Curve , a  movie about a ballerina torn between a
struggling composer and a tyrannical d ance  impressario. But only the two
middle cuts--the conversational &quot;Lily&quot; and the title  track--seem at
all dependent on the film's context. 
</P>
<P>Watching an established artist break through to new heights is always a
thrill. At  this point, Bush wants to be heard loud and clear, and she should
be. It co uld be a  very long time before an artist of such strength and beauty
enters our world again.

<P>Though I at times disagree with the authors opinion about Kate and her
previous  work, or his interpretations, it is good that a reviewer recognizes
Kate's talent as  much more than pop music. He makes no attempt to review the
album on the level  of ordinary musisians work, but treats it as an more than an
bunch of tunes--the  mistake so many reviewers make. This is, of course exactly
how Kate's albums  should be treated! 
</P>
<P>PS I like all the new stuff - Even CITW! Of course with Kate's songs, I'm
going  to have to listen another twenty times before I grasp them. These are
more difficult,  especially &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot;, because she is still
digging deeper into the soul and  taking the music with her. But it took several
listenings to ALL her songs before  they really showed themselves to be the
products of a TRUE genius.

<P>Hope every enjoyed this review
