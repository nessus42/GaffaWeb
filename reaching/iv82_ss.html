(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Saturday Superstore by Mike Read October 1982 
</P>
<P>65. Saturday Superstore: Kate is interviewed by Mike Read on the U.K. TV 
programme, October 1982. 
</P>
<P>This rather lengthy guest appearance by Kate on a silly British chat-show in
1982  is remarkable for the blithe ignorance of its host. Kate handles all the
nonsense with  perfect poise. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED] 
</P>
<P>[Blithe ignorance skipped] 
</P>
<P>I: Do you have a local store that you go to, or not? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I do, for vegetables and things like that. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you always buy the same things, I find when I go to the store I always
think  &quot;hmmm, what should I get?&quot; Well, I always end up getting
exactly the same things  every week. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I try to get different things, but normally it's the same things,
yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you get out to shop much on saturdays or not? 
</P>
<P>K: Not much, no. 
</P>
<P>I: You maybe stay in bed after working all week. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I try to sleep as much as I can, normally. 
</P>
<P>I: Right. [Rambling babble skipped] You're very into making videos, Do you
find it  easier. I mean it's a completely different sort of medium, really isn't
it, making  videos? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Is it something you enjoy doing? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. I love doing it. I think the great this is that it's a very growing
industry so  each time you make a video there's probably new effects around and
new  techniques. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you able to throw in your own ideas, you know. Or does the producer
say  &quot;right, Kate, you know you'll do this and you'll do this.&quot; Or are
you able to say  &quot;well, I fancy doing this?&quot; Do you get quite a bit of
freedom. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I do, I think because of the way I used to work. I always used to
work with  Keith Macmillan, who was a fantastic director, because it's really
the director in  videos who keep the direction together. And he was very great,
he always used  to let me get as involved as I wanted to. And I learnt
everything I know from  him, really. 
</P>
<P>I: Who's your choreographer as well. Because having seen lots of you - I've
got a  whole videocassette of you at home 
</P>
<P>K: Have you? [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: - and the dancing is amazing. Does somebody do your choreography or do
you do  that yourself? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, for the tour I had a lot of help from a man called Anthony Van
Laast. But  for a lot of the videos, most of the choreography is mine, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Cause I know a lot of girls would like to dance like... and they say &quot;wooo,
I wish I  could dance like Kate Bush does.&quot; I mean all this sort of
movement. Does that  come from anywhere, did you see anyone and say &quot;that's
how I'd like to dance.&quot;  I mean, did you model your movements on a
particular dancer or not. 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think I actually modeled the movements, but I've definitely been
inspired  by particular people and when you see people that are really great,
you want to  be like them. But I think the thing about dance and music is that
it's very much  an expression of you from within. So even if you learn to dance
or sing, there's  always that thing from you, which is really what it's about, I
think. 
</P>
<P>I: There's hope for me yet. 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, definitely! 
</P>
<P>I: What about the singing style, was that derived from somebody, or was that
 something that just naturally came? Because it's very unique, your style. 
</P>
<P>K: I think that's something that grew over the years, because when I first
started  singing I had a very untoneful voice. I mean I could sing in tune, but
there was  no quality to my voice at all. And over the years, the more I kept
singing the  more it started changing and growing. 
</P>
<P>I: I'm still at the untoneful stage, so you never know. I'll keep trying.
[Laughs] 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, you must try! You must keep trying! 
</P>
<P>I: [Laughs] Right, we're going to see your video in a second. Michael Biggs,
who's  twenty and who live at Evenclose [???] Brampton in Cambashire, says &quot;I'd
like to  see Kate Bush please.&quot; Well, your wish is granted. [Kate spreads
arms in &quot;I'm  here&quot; gesture] And your order is granted as well. Here's
Kate Bush singing &quot;The  Dreaming&quot;. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Was that a laser beam in there? 
</P>
<P>K: It was, it was. 
</P>
<P>I: Amazing, that looked quite good. It's very clever the way you... Do you
actually  see it when your holding onto it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Or pretending to hold onto it. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, that's right pretending. 
</P>
<P>[More stuff skipped]
