Steve Clarke
</P>
<P>&lt;A March 1978 interview with Kate, conducted by Steve Clarke. Edited by 
Andrew Marvick.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush City Limits 
</P>
<P>The Kate Bush sitting opposite me bears scant resemblance to the doe-eyed 
female currently plastered all over London in poster form.
</P>
<P>She looks out from the top of double-decker buses, peers at the weary
commuter  from in-between the tube ads for &quot;Close Encounters of the Third
Kind&quot; and  &quot;Dalton's Weekly&quot;--omnipresent, Kate Bush certainly
is.
</P>
<P>On the posters it's a coy, soft-focused Kate showing enough breast to--well,
at  least titillate the passing passengers. Face to face Kate Bush is an impish
hippy girl  who belies her much touted nineteen years.
</P>
<P>Her debut &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance gave rise to Kate being
described as &quot;a  dark-haired Lyndsay De Paul,&quot; but she is neither
doll-like nor petite, though hardly  tall. Her faded jeans are mostly concealed
under a pair of sheepskin-lined  thigh-high reddish suede boots, and are in
marked contrast to her very feminine  fringed top.
</P>
<P>Without much time to scurry home to the South East London house she shares 
with her two brothers to wash her carefully dishevelled hair for an appearance
on  BBC's &quot;Tonight,&quot; Kate's in a hurry. Still, she remains charming
and unflustered.
</P>
<P>For a girl still in her teens, she's exceptionally
self-possessed--especially since in  recent weeks she's shot from nowhere to
becoming a household name, courtesy of  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, her first
single. The song was inspired by Emily Bronte's  romantic novel of the same name
and is sung in a voice not unlike that of a  newly-neutered cat letting the
world know of his predicament.
</P>
<P>To compound her mercurial success, her first album &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;
is also  high on the chart. Kate is amazed at the way things gone. &quot;If you
think of it in terms  of people and not the money--'cause that's not
relevant--it makes me feel very  humble,&quot; she squeaks in her sing-song
voice.
</P>
<P>She was signed to EMI three years ago, given a 3,000-Pound advance and a 
four-year contract with options after the second and third years; i.e., if EMI
wanted  to drop Kate after either two or three years they could. Last year they
re-signed her  and it seems certain the company will retain her throughout this
year too.
</P>
<P>Amongst the credits on &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; is the Floyd's guitarist
Dave Gilmour.  It was, she says, largely because of Gilmour that she got a
record deal. Kate had  played piano since she was eleven, starting to write her
own songs shortly after. A  friend of the Bushes had offered to take some
home-made tapes she'd recorded  during her early teens round the record
companies, but his endeavours were  abortive--until he contacted Gilmour, an old
friend from Cambridge.
</P>
<P>&lt;Note: Each of these tapes are described by Peter FitzGerald-Morris as
containing  &quot;thirty songs.&quot; The friend was Ricky Hopper.&gt;
</P>
<P>Gilmour liked what he heard and offered to finance the recording of some 
professional demo tapes. It was also Gilmour who introduced Kate to arranger 
Andrew Powell (known for his work with Alan Parsons), who subsequently  produced
&quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. The Gilmour-sponsored tapes received a warm 
welcome at EMI's A&amp;R department. &lt;This was after an earlier (second) demo
tape,  recorded at Gilmour's house, was submitted to EMI without success.&gt;
</P>
<P>Things couldn't have worked out more perfectly for the sixteen-year-old 
doctor's daughter. Fresh out of school with an armful of O levels, 3,000 Pounds
in  her bin and with no immediate pressures from EMI, Kate was free to pursue
her  ambition to dance. She applied to an ad in London's &quot;Time Out&quot;
magazine and  enrolled at Lindsay Kemp's mime school.
</P>
<P> So why did EMI keep you under covers for so long?
</P>
<P>&quot;They were worried about me not being able to cope with things. And I
was  worried 'cause I didn't feel capable of coping with it either.&quot;
</P>
<P>So Kate spent her days at Kemp's school with barely an interruption from her
 record company. &quot;Oh, it was great,&quot; chirps Kate.&quot;I really got
into the discipline. I  had so much time and I could use it. For an artist
that's such a delightful situation  to be in.
</P>
<P>&quot;I came in to EMI on a friendly basis and that was good for me, because
it meant  that I could meet people there as people, and not as a big vulture
business where  they're all coming in and pulling your arm out. Also, I could
learn about the  business, which is so important, because it *is* a business.&quot;
</P>
<P>The daily lessons with Kemp--50p a throw--were very informal. &quot;He
taught me that  you can express with your body--and when your body is awake so
is your mind.  He'd put you into emotional situations, some of them very heavy.
Like he'd say,  'Right, you're all now going to become sailors drowning, and
there are waves  curling up around you.' And everyone would just start
screaming.
</P>
<P>&quot;Or maybe he'd turn you into a little piece of flame...&quot;
</P>
<P>Waiting for EMI to click its fingers did have its drawbacks, though. &quot;Artistically,
I  was getting so frustrated at not being able to get my art to people.&quot;
</P>
<P>Kate says that EMI did have a go at image-building and at persuading her to
write  more commercial songs (&quot;Not so heavy--more hook lines&quot;), but
when Kate finally  went into the studio last summer with half of Pilot and half
of Cockney Rebel as  her backing band, it was on her own terms. &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; was originally  scheduled for release last November, but was
shelved at the very last moment  because of--according to her--delays with
artwork. By the time everything was  right, the Christmas rush was on so Kate's
debut was stalled a second time.
</P>
<P>	 EMI had, however, already mailed out some copies of the single, one of
which  reached Capital Radio's Tony Myatt. Despite EMI's requests to the
contrary,  Myatt played the record before it was actually on sale. Ironically,
Kate feels that  Capital's championing &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is the key
reason for its success.
</P>
<P>So is it natural to sing that high, Kate?
</P>
<P>&quot;Actually, it is. I've always enjoyed reaching notes that I can't quite
reach. A week  later you'll be on top of that note and trying to reach the one
above it.
</P>
<P>&quot;I always feel that you can continually expand your senses if you try.
The voice is  like an instrument. The reason I sang that song so high is 'cause
I felt it called  for it. The book has a mood of mystery and I wanted the song
to reflect that.&quot;
</P>
<P>That she sings in different voices on her album is not, claims Kate, due to
an identity  crisis--to evoke each song's particular mood she has to alter her
pitch.
</P>
<P>Kate insists that she isn't exploiting her sexuality: &quot;That's a very
obvious image. I  suppose the poster is reasonably sexy just 'cause you can see
my tits, but I think  the vibe from the face is there. The main thing about a
picture is that it should  create a vibe. Often you get pictures of females
showing their legs with a very  plastic face. I think that poster projects a
mood.&quot;
</P>
<P>But what about the album cover in which you're showing your legs with a 
vengeance?
</P>
<P>The picture is creating a feeling of flying and movement. If you're up in
the sky  you're going to be free. It would look a bit weird if I had a dirty
great black  serge coat on.&quot;
</P>
<P>Again, one of the hand-out pics is particularly sexy--with Kate drawing
attention to  her crotch.&quot;That came from a seven-hour photo session where
the photographer  and I were trying to produce a vibe. It had to be a relevant
one. A nice, simple,  obvious one for me is the fact that I do dance, so we got
a load of leotards and just  did that, but still trying to create a vibe. Not
necessarily a sexy one--although I  will agree with you that it is--but from now
on we're taking a more subtle  approach.&quot;
</P>
<P>So there'll be no more suggestive shots?
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know, it's hard to say. I don't really think it's important. I
think I'm going  to have trouble because people tend to put the sexuality first.
I hope they don't. I  want to be recognised as an artist.&quot;
