<P>Date: Wed, 25 Oct 89 03:19:50 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Q magazine November 1989 
</P>
<P>The November Q magazine has Kate on the cover. Inside, there's an interview 
and a review of the album. (There's also a full page ad for the album.) 
</P>
<P>First, the review: 
</P>
<P>WIGGLY 
</P>
<P>Welcome back to the fey, pattery, indeed *sproingy* world of Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World 
</P>
<P> Romping home a close second to the Blue Nile in the increasingly
competitive  Studio Marathon stakes, Kate Bush's sixth album has finally arrived
almost exactly  four years after her last, The Hounds Of Love. &quot;Each record
gets harder to make&quot;  may not sound like much of an excuse for being so
late either, but to judge from the  fineness of detail and diversity of
influences Bush has compressed into the 40-odd  minutes here, it's a perfectly
plausible one: The Sensual World is as highly wrought  and deeply thought as any
album since the last by Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>Like Gabriel, Bush has been busy thinking up ways to incorporate more exotic
 and atmospheric elements into her already broad and quirky rock coalition.
Unlike  him, though, she has leaned less heavily on the obvious source, Africa.
The Uillean  pipes (courtesy of Davey Spillane) which barge brilliantly into the
chorus of the  album's opening, eponymous track are the first of a number of
surprise guests, of  whom the all-woman Bulgarian folk a cappella troupe, Trio
Bulgarka, are the ones  who stay the longest and leave the strongest impression.
Their shrill, ghostly whoops  and harmonies decorate three of the tracks on side
two: a pattery, Gabriel-esque  meditation on the ambiguous blessings of
technology, in this case computers, called  Deeper Understanding; a heavily
modified bluesy rocker, Rocket's Tail; and best of  the lot, Never Be Mine, a
tremulously Bushy ballad with a beautifully wiggly  interlace of keyboard
motifs. 
</P>
<P>While Bush's famous fey voice would probably be enough to hold the disparate
 strands of The Sensual World together, the album takes its cue and colouring
too  from the hypnotically sinuous sway of the pipes on the title track. There
are some  strapping power chords to be despatched here and there, most notably
on Love And  Anger, but the dominant mood is of Oriental reverie, similar in
feel to that achieved  latterly by Japan. And in fact the last track on side
one, Heads We're Dancing,  reproduces that mysteriously *sproingy* bass sound
favoured by Mick Karn. 
</P>
<P>An analysis of its parts however doesn't really do justice to the boldness
of the  album. Bush has taken on a lot of styles but The Sensual World doesn't,
thankfully,  end up sounding simply clever or stylised. Which is not to say that
all the bridges she  tries to build here stand up, but to acknowledge that the
imaginative effort and  patience that went into their design should guarantee
Kate Bush's position in that  peculiar class of her own for some while yet. ****
-- Robert Sandall 
</P>
<P>And now, the interview: 
</P>
<P>IRON MAIDEN 
</P>
<P>Although signed at the tender age of 18, Kate Bush stoutly refused to be &quot;the
 record company's daughter.&quot; She's quietly become her own manager,
producer,  publisher, and video director, retreating to the strife-free
sanctuary of a home studio  to agonise over her complex recordings and
cautiously contemplate trips to the  outside world. Phil Sutcliffe encounters &quot;the
shyest megalomaniac you're ever likely  to meet&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It felt like a mission,&quot; says Kate Bush. &quot;Even before I'd
had a record out I had a  tremendous sense of conviction that my instincts were
right. You know, *This is it!*  There could be no other way. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I remember so well sitting in an office at EMI with some very
important people  who were saying that James And The Cold Gun should be the
first single. For me  this was just *totally* wrong. How could it possibly be
anything other than  Wuthering Heights? But they were going, Defintely not.
Look, you don't understand  the market. So we went on saying the same things to
one another for a few more  minutes -- I was being politely insistent, I usually
am in an argument, I'm not good  at expressing anger, that's still hard for me.

</P>
<P>&quot;Then a guy called Terry Walker, another executive, came in with some
papers in  his hands and put them on the desk. He looked around, saw me and
said, Oh hi  Kate, loved the album! Wuthering Heights *definitely* the first
single, eh? And he  walked out again. If he hadn't come in at that moment, well,
I don't know what  would have happened. It was so well-timed it was almost as if
I'd paid the guy to do  it. They obviously thought of me as just a strong-willed
girl, but they trusted his  opinion.&quot; 
</P>
<P>After Wuthering Heights had spent four weeks at Number 1, these same execs
--  most of whom, a contemporary recalls, had groaned &quot;What is *that*?&quot;
when they  first heard it wailing round the corporate corridors -- began to view
this stubborn  kid (all five feet three and seven stone of her) with a mixture
of guarded respect  and superstitious awe. Kate Bush was on her way to taking
control of her working  life and, as she puts it, becoming &quot;the shyest
megalomaniac you're ever likely to  meet&quot;. 
</P>
<P>She'd have put her best dress on for that meeting. Probably the smart red 
number she used to favour when she met the press, black patent leather shoes, 
make-up elaborately conceived and executed. The approach was consistent, the 
effect varied. Sometimes she looked beautiful. Sometimes she looked oddly
blowzy,  like Joan Collins or Elizabeth Taylor at a royal premiere. &quot;I used
to dress up all the  time,&quot; she says. &quot;Every day I felt as if I was
*presenting* myself. Hopefully I'm more  relaxed now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So it seems: she's wearing battered sneakers, old blue jeans, the sort of
Fair Isle  sweater her mum would probably dig the weeds in, hair just combed
back, maybe a  touch of eye shadow, nothing more. But then she is in her
home-from-home, a  recording studio at Abbey Road where she's worked on all her
albums, including  the latest, The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>Lounging in a swivel chair beside one of the mixing desks, she talks very
quietly,  full of thoughtful pauses and also laughter at herself and other
things. Her voice is  faintly accented with the suburban twang and burr from the
boundaries of South  London and Kent where she's lived for all of her 31 years.

</P>
<P>It's an undistinguished area, neither town nor country, but it seems to have
been  a safe haven for her. At least, her family certainly has been. Her home
itself could  hardly have been more solid, a 350-year-old farmhouse with ample
grounds and  outhouses. Her father is a doctor, her mother an Irish nurse.
Brothers Paddy (now  37) and Jay (45), musician and poet respectively, were
always around and encouraged  her to share their own very '60s awareness of
self-expression: writing poems and  painting butterflies on the walls of the old
barn that was her hang-out, listening to  The Beatles, The Incredible String
Band, T. Rex, and reading the tranquil  philosophisings of mystics like
Gurdjieff and Kahlil Gibran. 
</P>
<P>When she was 10 her father showed her middle C on a decaying harmonium and, 
with nobody around who would dream of mocking her efforts, she thumped and 
pedalled away at it. When the mice had finished eating most of the moving parts,
 she moved to an upright piano and drifted naturally into writing her own songs
--  200 of them by the time she was 16. 
</P>
<P>By comparison, the outside world could only have appeared the more 
unpredictable and threatening. Finding herself &quot;a loner&quot; in the crowd
at school, she  would invite a few best friends back to the barn to play
records, cook feasts and  smoke, but she kept her own music secret from almost
all of them. In particular, she  would never mention it to her boyfriends
because when they found out, as happened  a couple of times, &quot;It would
always cause trouble. They'd think I was cleverer than  them or something daft
like that -- I was a threat to their masculinity.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Her own instinct as she approached the outskirts of the music business was
to  make her career feel as much like an extension of her own family life as
possible.  However, young as she was, there was soon a queue of potential
Svengalis forming  whose intention, kindly meant, was that she should become
what EMI people called  &quot;the record company's daughter&quot; -- which she
very nearly did. 
</P>
<P>At first, in ignorance of the industry, the family sent out dauntingly
indigestible  demos of 60 songs at a time. Then when she was 14, a friend of her
parents called  Ricky Hopper, who had some connections with the industry,
contacted Dave  Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Something about those rough tapes caught
his ear and he  began his remarkably generous one-man campaign on her behalf. He
invited her to  his home studio where she recorded three tracks including The
Man With The  Child In His Eyes. When Bob Mercer, an EMI executive, came up to
Abbey Road  where Floyd were recording Wish You Were Here, Gilmour handed him a
cassette  with his recommendation. This was just after Dark Side Of The Moon.
Suggestions  from Pink Floyd were treated with all due reverence. 
</P>
<P>Mercer played it and he was hooked too. After long discussions with Kate and
 her family, at which it was agreed that, even if she already had the songs, she
wasn't  emotionally ready for the hurly-burly, he came up with a novel &quot;sponsorship&quot;
 scheme: in July, 1976, she was given 3,000 pounds by EMI Records and a further
500  pounds by EMI Publishing to finance her for a year of personal and
professional  development. 
</P>
<P>She had passed 10 &quot;O&quot; levels, but she left school without a
backward glance. She  left home too -- but only to a degree, as the Bush
siblings took over a three storey  house in Lewisham with Kate and her piano
ensconced in the top flat. She took  singing lessons to help her reach the
improbable highs and lows she had begun  writing into her songs. She studied
mime with a leading teacher called Adam Darius,  and trained as a dancer in
Lindsay Kemp's 50p-for-two-hours public sessions at The  Dance Centre, Covent
Garden -- she wasn't the sort of person to know that Kemp  was already a pop
cult figure after his work with Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust show,  but she wrote
Moving, on The Kick Inside, about him. 
</P>
<P>From April '77 until recording began in July, she even served a brief 
apprenticship in a proper carry-your-own-amps rock group. Paddy enlisted muso 
mates Brian Bath (guitar), Charlie Morgan (drums) and Del Palmer (bass) to form 
the KT Bush Band who hardnosed the high streets of South London with their elfin
 lead singer getting stuck into stompers like Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Women, and
 I Heard It Through The Grapevine. She also hit it off with the bassman who soon
 moved in with her. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In many ways I was at my strongest then,&quot; she says. &quot;I was
at the beginning of  something and I had a tremendous desire to make an album.
That was all I'd  wanted to do for a long time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As soon as she'd secured the release of Wuthering Heights as her first
single, she  started arguing about the picture bag. EMI were intent on going
with the  subsequently famous Gered Mankowitz shot to tie in with the poster
campaign --  dewy eyes and a skin-tight vest not inadvertently emphasising her
nipples. Although  later embarrassed by the way men reacted to this photograph,
Kate saw nothing  dubious about it at the time in terms of either taste or
sexism (&quot;I suppose it's  reasonably sexy 'cos you can see my tits, but I
think the vibe from my face is  there,&quot; she said). She was simply adamant
that something echoing the kite picture  she had chosen for the album sleeve
would work better. Again she won, even though  the re-design meant putting the
release date back two months to January, '78. 
</P>
<P>By then EMI must have been getting used to waving the white flag under the 
onslaught of relentless calm and charm. With Wuthering Heights taking off, the
next  joust was virtually no contest. The follow-up should be Them Heavy People,
said the  company. No, The Man With The Child In His Eyes, said the company's
daughter.  The company conceded. However, if she'd got a grip within the office,
she soon  encountered the chaos of other pressures and interests attracted by an
overnight  sensation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My first Top Of The Pops I didn't want to do,&quot; she says. &quot;I
was terrified. I'd  never done television before. Seeing the video afterwards
was like watching myself  die. That was when things started getting very
difficult for me because until then it  had all been very creative work,
writing, recording, learning to dance.&quot; But now  what she was involved in
was promotion. &quot;I was talking to press, talking to television,  and I
couldn't express myself easily. I wa up against a different beast.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Improbable schedules were demanded. Suddenly a five-minute mime on an 
Italian pop programme became imperative because it was to be beamed around 
Europe. Kate tried to defend herself by setting what seemed to her impossible 
conditions: OK, if they got her there and back inside a day. A private jet was 
chartered, no problem. &quot;To me it was bizarre,&quot; she recalls. &quot;Up
in the morning, over  to Verona, I think it was, and walk out on this stage. I'm
facing the cameras and a  few hundred people who I assume are the audience. Then
the stage and the whole  set starts to rotate and I realise that it's a huge
circular stadium and out front there  are thousands and thousands of people.
I've never seen so many people in my life!  Anyway I mimed Wuthering Heights,
bowed, and flew off home again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That autumn, when she found the couple of months she had to record Lionheart
 being constantly interrupted by promotional work (much of it abroad as The Kick
 Inside reached new territories), she realised that it would take more than her
own  reserves of polite obstinacy to keep control of the musical life she'd
dreamed of for  so long. &quot;I need to feel free, not manipulated,&quot; she
said. To do that she had to get  organised. 
</P>
<P>With the help of a music industry lawyer, she set up Kate Bush Publishing
and  Novercia, a management company with herself as MD and her parents and
brothers  the board of directors. Thenceforth, these companies licensed her work
to EMI.  &quot;Because my family were involved I was with people I could trust,&quot;
she says, then  breaks off. &quot;I'm sorry, I feel quite worried about
mentioning the companies'  names.&quot; But they're on the album sleeves. &quot;They
are, aren't they? You're absolutely  right. It's my paranoia again! There have
been things in the past.. . Oh, I can't  remember. When you're doing interviews
you have to be almost like a security  guard sometimes. Anyway, for me, one of
the most important things to come out of  managing myself is the fact that I
could decide how long I spent on each album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ever since, Kate Bush has been wholly responsible for herself. On occasions,
 though, the burden of her own aspirations has been all but unbearable. Her
stage  show was like that. Bashing out Stones classics in the back room of a pub
was one  thing, but a concert of her own music had to be a complete expression
of her art and  soul. In four months from January '79, she choreographed and
rehearsed a separate  dance drama for every song in the set, worked in a new
band, took the leadaing role  in set and lighting design, and even interviewed
and picked the senior crew  members. 
</P>
<P>Constantly putting in 15-hour days, she stood up to it because she was in
Olympic  shape from her dance training. But the shows, two-and-a-half hours long
with 17  costume changes, took her to unforgettable depths of fatigue -- such
that the 28  nights in Britain and Europe remain the entire concert career of
Kate Bush, give or  take a Secret Policeman's Ball. &quot;The idea is so
unattractive when I think about what  the tour took out of me,&quot; she says. &quot;I
haven't wanted to commit myself since.&quot; And,  being the overreacher she is,
she simply can't contemplate the straightforward band  set that suffices for
other pop stars. 
</P>
<P>It was the same with TV. Later that year she conceived a half-hour special
for  BBC2 with more elaborate set-pieces including a dramatised version of Roy 
Harper's Another Day with Peter Gabriel. But that was the last time she tried
it. 
</P>
<P>Which left video as her only active visual medium. &quot;They're so cliched
and  narcissistic,&quot; she says. &quot;Most of what I've done makes me cringe,
though I liked  Army Dreamers, because it was a complete little film, not too
grand and not  clouding the issue. And Cloudbusting too (featuring Donald
Sutherland and the  rain-making machine). That's probably the best I've ever
done. But Experiment IV  was the first one I directed myself. I was so keen to
do that because I actually knew  I would be making a video while I wrote the
song, so I was thinking visually from  the start. But then it nearly killed me,
the hours it took, directing and acting in it.  Two weeks non-stop. It was too
much for me.. .&quot; 
</P>
<P>Perhaps it's only in the sound studio that she can truly encompass what she 
strives for. Once Novercia was set up it was clear that, before long, she would
be  producing herself and, after co-producing her 1980 album Never For Ever with
Jon  Kelly, the engineer on her first two albums, she was ready. Setting out on
The  Dreaming, she remarked with tact and a touch of steel that, &quot;Jon
wanted to keep  working with me, but we discussed it and he realised that it was
for the best.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Then, the only people she still had to convince were the musicians: &quot;I
think the  basic fear in everybody's head was, God, does she really know what
she's doing?  But you have to trust your own decisions. When everyone else is
saying, No, that's  dangerous, there's always a little voice in my head syaing,
Yeah, yeah, it's all right.&quot;  There again she's never dealt with hacks who
keep time with the meter running  and the statutory tea break on their minds.
She has a regular team who have  become her alter-family, just as the studio is
a second home -- the tight circle has  included all of the KT Bush Band, Dave
Gilmour and Stuart Elliott (the former  Cockney Rebel drummer, supplied by EMI
as a sessioner on The Kick Inside, and  adapted long-term). 
</P>
<P>Most of these people can make handsome livings anywhere and wouldn't keep 
coming back for more if they didn't enjoy the work and know they're appreciated.
 &quot;They're very good for unblocking the pipes,&quot; she says, then laughs
at the indelicate  image. But the creative plumbing does get clogged on every
album, including The  Sensual World. &quot;There's a song called Love And Anger
which I started two years  ago and kept on shelving because it was rubbish,&quot;
she says. &quot;Paddy and Dave  Gilmour, who put overdubs on it, had so much
trouble with it. They kept on asking,  What's it about? and all I could say was,
I dunno but, uh, doesn't it feel, uh,  cohesive to you? Well, I started bringing
musicians in to see if they could bring it to  life and John Giblin, the bass
player, just said, This is great! and came up with  something fresh right away.
It was so nice having someone put all this enthusiasm  into a song I'd almost
given up on.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Even her writing technique has reflected the will to hold her work in the
palm  of her hand. Plonking away, untutored, on the piano certainly developed
her  unmistakable style, but it left her exposed to experts in rhythm,
arrangement,  orchestration -- a frustrating vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>It was Peter Gabriel who gave her the lead when, in 1980, she sang backing
vocals  on Games Without Frontiers. She was intrigued to find him writing not
with a  melodic instrument, but with a drum machine. She wondered whether she
could do  the same as she plunged herself into The Dreaming. &quot;That was a
brave time for me,&quot;  she says. &quot;I *had* to be brave, take control of
the whole album and go for it, see if I  really could pull it together -- put
some balls into my voice for the first time too.&quot; 
</P>
<P>With the beat box, which she'd never used before, she set herself a
peculiarly  disciplined task: to sit at home and write a new song every night
for as long as she  could. At first the rigid beat drove her up the wall. Then
she got the hang of moving  in and out of it and started to like it. She wrote
20 songs that way before she was  satisfied. 
</P>
<P>She had also begun experimenting with the recently introduced Fairlight CMI 
all-round miraculous synthesizer-sampler. Once she'd mastered that, it was
within  her power to create every part of an arrangement on a keyboard at home.

</P>
<P>But if the theory of self-determination was coming along fine, the practice
was on  the blink. Kate Bush may seem to have had a fairly stable career, always
coming up  with something fresh and surprising, always played on the radio and
talked about,  but the commercial reality was that her album sales had plotted a
uniform  downward curve in Britain, her main market-place given America's
resolute lack of  interest up to that point. The Kick Inside did triple platinum
plus (more than a  million), Lionheart platinum (over 300,000), Never For Ever
gold (100,000), and The  Dreaming was where she hit bottom with a mere silver
(60,000). Reviewers were  ecstatic, Radio Once wholly unreceptive, EMI utterly
miserable. As a single the title  track expired at 48 and the follow-up, There
Goes A Tenner, was her first release  not to show in the charts at all. Harsh
things were said in the corridors of EMI, and  some of them to the artist's
face, which had never happened before so fond and  respectful was the company's
attitude to her. &quot;That was my 'She's gone mad'  album,&quot; Kate says, &quot;my
'She's not commercial any more' album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It was time to regroup and rebuild, in every sense, close to home. Kate's 
remaining dependency in EMI, more conspicuous after a commercial flop, was for 
advances to pay recording costs -- an Abbey Rosd studio then weighed in at 90 
pounds an hour, for instance. The Bush response was to reduce the company's 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>In June '83 she began a major upgrading of the little demo studio she'd had
in  the old barn at her parents' house. As her boyfriend Del Palmer, more of an 
equipment buff than Kate, has acknowledged, they couldn't afford to buy 
state-of-the-art, but they moved a decent 48-track desk in with most of the 
trimmings and by September they were hard at work again on what was to become 
Hounds Of Love. 
</P>
<P>For Kate it must be the perfect sanctuary, a place of freedom to pursue her
work  at the heart of her happiest memories of childhood. It certainly seems to
have  changed her luck, though ironically it emerges that she may be so much at
her ease  there that she's prone to disorientation when she goes elsewhere, such
as when  recording Gabriel's Don't Give Up. &quot;I was so thrilled he asked me
to sing such a  beautiful song,&quot; she says, &quot;but then I got very
nervous. Recording at my home studio  we don't have window contact between the
studio and the control room, you know.  We can't see each other, we talk to each
other through the mike and headphones,  that's all (her choice, of course). It's
quite isolated the way I work and I hadn't  been to anyone else's studio for
ages. And then at Real World I was *terrified*. I  messed it up and had to come
back another day to re-do it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On delivering Hounds Of Love she found EMI slightly changed in personnel and
 much better pleased with her, but there was an old familiar debate to engage
in.  The A &amp; R department had picked Cloudbusting as the first single, while
Kate said it  had to be Deal With God. Good grace revived, EMI gave way. But
then they said she  couldn't call it Deal With God. &quot;For me, that *is* the
title,&quot; says Kate, &quot;but I was told  that if I insisted the radio
stations in at least 10 countries would refuse to play it  because it had 'God'
in the title -- Spain, Italy, America, lots of them. I thought it  was
ridiculous. Still, especially after The Dreaming, I decided to weigh up the 
priorities. Not creatively compromise, but not be so obsessibe that.. . I had to
give the  album a chance.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Running Up That Hill was her biggest hit since Wuthering Heights and EMI
gave  Hounds Of Love the big send-off with a laser show at the London
Planetarium. It  went straight in at Number 1 (it's now sold nearly 900,000,
while the following  year's The Whole Story hits collection is over the
million). David Munns, then  handling her A &amp; R, now MD of Polydor (UK),
says of her renaissance in the charts  and the company's regard, &quot;This is
my favourite artist in the world. But for someone  like her it's sometimes a
lonely road and that can be difficult for people to  understand. Make a record
that's a bit obscure and some people in the company  may start to say things to
the artist that aren't sensible. Well, EMI and Kate just lost  the plot for a
while.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Throughout her indefatigable quest for a working environment sufficiently 
sheltered to allow her the artistic freedom she required, there was one area of
Kate  Bush's life that could not be brought under any semblance of control: the
press. It's  a preoccupation, something she often finds herself talking about
when trying to  avoid what she suspects are privacy-infringing enquiries -- as
she's said, &quot;People ask  you questions you'd only answer under
psychoanalysis.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sometimes it must seem to her that the Garbo solution is the only answer.
For  years, her relationship with Del Palmer was an official --that is, open --
secret, the  subject of many tortuous evasions. Then, in an access of optimism,
they went to the  Hounds Of Love launch arm-in-arm. They smiled for the
photographers. Then the  next day they found that the tabloid party yarn was
that Youth, the former Killing  Joke member who played bass on one track, had
informed the world that Del was a  &quot;wally&quot;. Quite probably he'd said
no such thing, but the whole venture was soured.  &quot;It surprises me that
people can put such an incredible amount of energy into such  negative stuff,&quot;
says Kate, &quot;They can be so wicked.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She still can't take it in stride. She's equally put out by both the
in-depth probe  and the careless stereotype of her as the &quot;sex symbol&quot;
or the &quot;wacky hippy&quot; whose  every third word was &quot;Wow!&quot; or &quot;Amazing!&quot;.

</P>
<P>The life Kate Bush has created is governed by the cycles of her albums.
Despite  her early versing in cosmic philosophies, no-one's ever accused her of
being  &quot;laid-back&quot;, and she once enunciated something adjacent to a
motto: &quot;In music you  have to break your back before you even start to
speak the emotion.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She went through all the usual turmoil on her way to completing The Sensual 
World. &quot;It's really frightening to me the way each album has taken longer
than the  one before,&quot; she says. &quot;The writing gets harder every time.
The Sensual World took  about two-and-a-half years to make in all, but with a
lot of gaps. I was going quickly  at first, thinking, Nah, piece of piss! Then
it all seemed like rubbish and I had to  stop for a while. There's tremendous
self-doubt involved. You think, Oh, God, I'll  never get it finished.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The problem was that she had started too soon after Hounds Of Love, she 
decided. &quot;I'll come off promotion of one album, start on the next and if
I'm not  careful it's nothing but a continuation and I don't want that,&quot;
she says. &quot;It's  important for me to create some kind of wall, shut it off.&quot;

</P>
<P>In part, she does this by going back to dancing. While totally embroiled in
the  studio and consoling herself with chocolate, she gets out of shape -- cause
of the  intermittent chubbier cheeks and hint of extra chin which have launched
a thousand  press rumours of her &quot;blowing up&quot; to 18 or even 20 stone.
She gives her fierce  workouts at the barre and mirrors credit for refurbishing
her mind as well as her  body after The Dreaming. 
</P>
<P>This time round, apart from dancing and running, the panacea was the garden
at  the house she and Del moved into three years ago in Eltham, Southeast London
 (brother Jay and family live next door; her parents' home still only half an
hour  away). &quot;I sometimes I think I might as well just be a brain and a big
pair of ears on  legs, stuck in front of a mixing desk,&quot; she says. &quot;But
when I took that break from  The Sensual World I really got into gardening. I
mean, it's literally a very  down-to-earth thing, isn't it? Real air. Away from
the artificial light. Very  therapeutic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Another renewable source of inspiration has been exotic instrumentation,
usually  provided by a visit to Dublin and various members of the staunchly
traditional folk  troupe, The Chieftains, or by turning to brother Paddy (who
specialised in making  medieval instruments at the London College of Furniture
and will knock out the odd  koto or strumento de porco as and when). But for The
Sensual World she's leavened  the Celtic skirl with a bit of Balkan. She first
heard the Trio Bulgarka in '86 and  was suitably astonished. A year later it
dawned on her that their full-throated  harmonies might suit her songs.
Connections were made through Joe Boyd of  Hannibal Records, their UK label, and
Kate flew out to Sofia for an entrancing  experience of world music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;They couldn't speak a word of English and I couldn't speak a word of 
Bulgarian,&quot; she says. &quot;Everything went through translators and it
didn't matter at all.  Lovely working with women, and especially them, they're
very affectionate. We  tended to communicate through cuddles rather than words.
In fact, we could get on  perfectly well without the translators. At one point
we were talking away in the  studio when the translator walked in and we all
shut up because she'd suddenly  made us self-conscious about what we were doing.&quot;
The Trio can be heard on three  tracks, including the strikingly unlikely
setting of Deeper Understanding, a very  modern-world song about an alienated
woman and her relationship with her  computer. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is definitely my most personal, honest album,&quot; she says. &quot;And
I think it's  my most *feminine* album, in that I feel maybe I'm not trying to
prove something  in terms of a woman in a man's world -- God, here we go!&quot;
She seems to be wary  of provoking a heavy debate about feminism. &quot;On The
Dreaming and Hounds Of  Love, particularly from a production standpoint, I
wanted to get a lot more weight  and power, which I felt was a very male
attitude. In some cases it worked very well,  but.. . perhaps this time I felt
braver as a woman, not trying to do the things that  men do in music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Fog is a brave song. It co-stars Kate's dad on spoken vocals intoning
with  fatherly/doctorly reassurance, &quot;Just put your feet down child/'Cos
you're all  grown-up now&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I started with the idea of a relationship in deep water and thought I
could  parallel that with learning to swim, the moment of letting go,&quot; she
says. &quot;When my  dad was teaching me to swim he'd hold both my hands, then
say, Now, let go. So I  would, then he'd take two paces back and say, Right,
swim to me, and I'd be,  Oo-er, blub, blub, blerb. But I though it was such a
beautiful image of the father and  child, all wrapped up in the idea of really
loving someone, but letting them go,  because that's a part of real love, don't
you think, the letting go?&quot; 
</P>
<P>So it's personal about Kate and her father then. It sounds as though it
might be  personal about her and Del too. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it does, doesn't it?&quot; She laughs, really amused by her
professionally evasive  reply. &quot;Have you ever watched Woody Allen being
interviewed? Obviously his films  are very personal and when the interviewer
asks him the 'Has this happened to you  then?' question, he's all.. .&quot; She
cowers back into her chair, crosses and uncrosses  her legs, thrashes about like
a speared fish. &quot;Then he'll say, Uh, well, no, I'm just  acting out a role.
It's ironic, but it's much easier to speak about very personal things  to lots
of people through a song, a poem or a film than it is to confront the world 
with them through someone asking questions. Maybe you worry because it's going 
to be indirectly reported.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush leads a quiet, fairly limited life so her options on subject
matter my be  relatively restricted. Although she has ventured into political
issues with Breathing  (nuclear war) and The Dreaming (Aborigine rights), she
generally declares her own  ignorance and refrains from writing songs that would
only prove it. But she will  often borrow a story and make it her own -- from
books (Wuthering Heights,  obviously, and Cloudbusting, from Peter Reich's
memoir of his father called A Book  Of Dreams), TV (Pull Out The Pin was
inspired by a documentary about the Viet  Cong), or films (the idea for Get Out
Of My House came from The Shining). 
</P>
<P>However, it was a story told by an older friend that sowed the seeds for
Heads  We're Dancing, a near-disco piece about a night out with Hitler. &quot;Years
ago this  friend of mine went to a dinner and spent the whole evening chatting
to this  fascinating guy, incredibly charming, witty, well-read, but never found
out his  name,&quot; she says. &quot;The next day he asked someone else who'd
been there who it was.  'Oh, didn't you know? That's Oppenheimer, the man who
invented the atomic  bomb.' My friend was horrified because he thought he should
have given the guy  hell, attacked him, he didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But the point was one moment this person is charming, then when you
find out  who he is, he's completely different. So I thought, Who's the worst
person you  could possibly meet in those circumstances? Hitler! And the story
developed. A  woman at a dance before the war and this guy comes up to her
tossing a coin with  this cocky chat-up line, Heads we're dancing. She doesn't
recognise him until she  sees his face in the paper later on and then she's
devastated. She thinks that if  she'd known she might have been able to *get*
him and change the course of  history. But he was a person who fooled a
tremendous number of people and I  don't think they can be blamed. It worries me
a bit that this song could be received  wrongly, though.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It could well be that the musically extended family and extended home of
Kate  Bush even embrace her feelings for her songs themselves. She has an
intimacy with  them, a distinctive candour about sensuality and sexuality to
which her present  album title track is something of a natural conclusion. 
</P>
<P>It passed more or less unnoticed in her early days that she was casually
breaking  taboos in every other song. Tricky items on her agenda included incest
(brother and  sister in The Kick Inside, woman and young boy in The Infant
Kiss), homosexuality  (Wow, Kashka From Baghdad) and period pains (Strange
Phenomena, Kites [sic]).  Her sympathetic, non-judgmental approach was probably
one of the less obvious  reasons why she appealed so strongly to both sexes, but
she would occasionally  remark that she was grateful the tabloids didn't read
lyric sheets. Otherwise she  could have been up to her neck in bishops and Mrs.
Whitehouse demanding that the  nation's children be protected from this filth. 
</P>
<P>In fact, the moment anyone other than a fan thinks they've spotted a hint of
sex  in her songs she becomes very hesitant. Once, when she was working on
Breathing,  an EMI executive walked in to be greeted by the hypnotic &quot;out-in,
out-in, out-in&quot;  chant. Taking a firm hold on the wrong end of the stick,
he asked her how she could  even dream of releasing this pornography. The
possibility of such gross  misunderstandings shakes her faith in the &quot;purity&quot;
-- a favourite word -- of what  she's doing. But not enough to make her back
off. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you think Art is a tremendous sensual-sexual expression? I feel
that  energy often.. . the driving force is probably not the right way to put
it,&quot; she says,  still trying to skirt the fnaarr-fnaarr potential of the
topic. 
</P>
<P>Whether or not her speculation about the nature of Art is on the money, she 
made her own experience of the creative process quite clear with the cover of
Never  For Ever. A cornucopia of fantastic and real, beautiful and vile
creatures -- the  products of her imagination -- is shown swirling our from
beneath her skirt. At the  time, thinking about this and the steamy,
masturbatory atmosphere of many of the  songs she wrote in her teens such as The
Man With The Child In His Eyes and  Saxophone Song, she said: &quot;It's not
such an open thing for women to be physically  attracted to the male body and
fantasise about it. I can't understand that because to  me the male body is
absolutely beautiful.. . Physical masturbation, it's a feeling so  bottled up
you have to relieve it, as if you were crying.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is a song that translates the old ache to a different
level --  with the invaluable help of James Joyce. &quot;I had a rhythm idea
with a synth line I  took home to work on one night,&quot; she says. &quot;While
I was playing it this repeated  *Yes* came to me and made me think of Molly
Bloom's speech right at the end of  Ulysses -- which I *have* actually read all
through! I went downstairs and read it  again, this unending sentence punctuated
with 'yeses', fantastic stuff, and it was  uncanny, it fitted the rhythm of my
song.&quot; (The last lines of Molly Bloom's great  stream of consciousness
read: &quot;then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain  flower and
first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he  could feel my
breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I  said yes I
will Yes.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Although to Kate &quot;it felt like it was meant to happen&quot;, when she
applied through  &quot;official channels&quot; (presumably the Joyce estate) for
permission to use it, she was  refused. But she wasn't to be deflected. &quot;I
tried to write it like Joyce,&quot; she says,  smiling in self-mockery. &quot;The
rhythm at least I wanted to keep. Obviously I couldn't  do his style. It became
a song about Molly Bloom, the character, stepping out of the  page -- black and
white, two-dimensional, you see -- and into the real world, the  sensual world.
Touching things.&quot; She declaims exaggeratedly. &quot;The grass underfoot! 
The mountain air! I know it sounds corny, but it's about the whole sensual 
experience, this wonderfully human thing. . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>And lines like &quot;his spark took life in my hand&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it is rather saucy. But not nearly as sexy as James Joyce.&quot;
She looks  concerned again. &quot;I'd be really worried -- there's nothing I can
do about it now  because it's all part of the process -- but I would be worried
if people felt this  ambiguity between sensual and sexual. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I definitely *became* a person when I left school and suddenly took
control of  my life,&quot; she says. &quot;I felt like that was the first time
I'd really been there. Do you.. .?  It was the beginning of my life really. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Now I think I get a tremendous amount of security from my work,
through  being able to write songs. Though perhaps I'm very insecure except when
I'm  working. There again I work so much.. . I'll have to think about this. I'll
be  thinking about it all day now. What I'm looking out for is to let go of
being so  damned obesessive about work that I just get sucked into it. It's
important for me  now for there to be some kind of, er, *lightness* about it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You know, it's only an album. That is what I keep saying to myself.&quot;
