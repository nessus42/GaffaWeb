<b><a name="icscotland01">Kate Bush back on form with first single in 12 years</a>

September 22, 2005</p>
<p></p>
<p>'For the first time anywhere in the world here is Kate Bush's new single King 
of the Mountain' </p>
<p>The eagerly anticipated new single from the enigmatic Kate Bush got an 
exclusive first play on Ken Bruce's show on BBC Radio 2 yesterday morning 
(September 21st). The very privileged Ken Bruce was inundated with phone calls 
and emails about his exclusive first play of the latest offering from the 
reclusive queen of British music. </p>
<p>I have had a chance to listen back to King of the Mountain a few times and it 
sounds really fresh. Opening with some delightful percussive synth noises, 
Kate's idiosyncratic voice comes through and the whole track feels very 
atmospheric and nonchalant. The song still has the inimitable Kate Bush sound 
about it but is a little more modern than material from her 1993 album The Red 
Shoes. </p>
<p>The brand new album from Kate Bush is called Aerial and will be released on 
November 7th. Aerial is reputed to be a double album and it is currently under 
lock and key in a vault deep in the depths of EMI records. The first disc 
consists of just one track lasting over half an hour! The second disc has seven 
tracks on it. </p>
<p>New single King of the Mountain will be released on CD on October 24th. </p>
<p>King of the Mountain is available for download on September 27th.</p>

<p>( four stars out of four)</p>
<p><b>Talking to wood pigeons, lyrics about laundry, bird sounds, homages to 
Elvis and Joan of Arc, Rolf Harris duets? It can only be the new Kate Bush 
album… <br>
</b><br>
Like millions of Kate Bush fans I’ve been waiting a long time for Aerial, her 
new double album. I have all of her albums on vinyl; I own two video 
collections, which I dug out, carried away by waves of pre release publicity; 
her birthday is the day before mine and I take some sort of cosmic solace in 
this. Not only does her back catalogue stand up in 2005, the videos even at 
their most cheaply theatrical, prove that Kate Bush was always ahead of her 
time. I was a teenager (just about) when she last released an album and The Red 
Shoes, while it has its moments, is not considered one of her best. Wavering 
between excitement and trepidation, I trekked out to EMI’s Dublin office. </p>
<p>As the door closed and ‘King of the Mountain’ filled the room, I sat back 
trying to decide on the ratio between scribbling notes and just soaking it in. 
The single, released this Friday, is already heavily playlisted and is seen as a 
positive precursor of what’s to come on the album. Bush presents the story of 
Elvis the lost genius, through swooping, sweeping strings. A wood percussion 
sample (marimba? xylophone?) runs through adding a playful note and with one 
song down, it’s so far so good. Pi reminds us that we’re in Kate Bush land, 
where song titles about circles and numerical rambling are delivered via Bodhrán 
beats and keyboards stabs. By song three, you begin to notice something. The 
velvet pitch of her voice not only sounds as good as expected after a 12-year 
hiatus, it has a deeper, bewitching resonance. Production on some of the earlier 
albums tended to accentuate its shrill quality, not doing justice to Bush’s 
capability as a vocalist. Here, every nuance is teased out, arching along the 
spectrum of imagination. </p>
<p>‘Bertie’, named after her son (whose drawings adorn the King of the Mountain 
cover) oozes pride and spirituality. Mandolins swirl around the line “you bring 
me so much joy/and then you bring me more joy”, repeated like a maternal mantra. 
‘Mrs. Bartolozzi’ is a real surprise; on the surface a simple domestic tale of 
washing machines – “splashy splosy… get those cuffs and collar clean” - hints at 
something darker. Could anyone else sing about doing laundry and make it sound 
so beautiful? </p>
<p>This is in part, due to a camerilla of contributors who she has worked with 
consistently over the years. The musical arrangements by long-time (and sadly 
late) Michael Kamen echo the multi-layered orchestration of The Sensual World. 
Most obvious on the single and ‘Joanni’ (about Joan of Arc), strings and drums 
build to the kind of epic mysterious highs we’ve come to expect. ‘A Coral Room’, 
a reflective piano piece recalls her mother and strikes the same poignant chimes 
as ‘This Woman’s Work’. </p>
<p>There are dips, and they come in the usual guise: a jarring commercialism 
that sounds as though session musicians bearing big 80s snare drums and sliding 
bass guitars have gatecrashed the studio. ‘How To Be Invisible’ and ‘Nocturn’ 
suffer this fate, but thankfully amid 16 tracks, they are in the minority. </p>
<p>If A Sea of Honey is classic Kate, CD 2, A Sky of Honey is the conceptual 
ante room. Recorded in seven parts, it’s a cyclical snapshot of the 
dawn-dusk-dawn journey. In ‘Prelude’, vocals mimic wood pigeons and a child 
cackles happily, ‘Prologue’ boasts a cello echo bouncing off strings and grand 
piano. Much has been made of Rolf Harris’ appearance on the album – on ‘An 
Architect’s Dream’ and ‘The Painter’s Link’ - but this time he’s without his 
didgereedoo, offering subtle vocals instead. The latter is troubled by more 
overbearing bass but it segues in to the chameleon ‘Sunset’. All three contain 
the same recurring motifs, rhythms and sounds. Kate tells us “this is a song of 
colour”, apt imagery for her broad canvas of moods and sounds. The tempo 
quickens and out of nowhere Spanish guitars usher in a mariachi skiffle. </p>
<p>It’s obvious CD 2 is a test site of sorts for Bush’s continuing interest in 
non-linear musical form and eclectic instruments. ‘Aerial Tal’ continues the 
birdsong and the most palpable electonic flashes surface briefly. Before it all 
gets too vague and unhinged, Kate delivers the best track on the entire album. 
‘Somewhere In Between’ consolidates the overall epic rush of Aerial, but its off 
kilter drums, bass-heavy beats and dreamy incongruity make this the most 
original piece here. </p>
<p>Having left us waiting so long, the last and penultimate tracks both feature 
laughter, whether she’s glad it’s nearly over or happy to back, remains to be 
seen. Nocturn’s only highlight is a big ominous choir (we won’t mention the 
Clannad feel to it) while the title track ‘Aerial’, is sheer hysterical abandon. 
Violin loops fade in and out, tribal beats steer bird tweets and mandolin. By 
the end, you literally can’t help yourself stamping your feet. </p>
<p>Kate Bush is an original, a one-off and it’s not hard to see why everyone 
from Tori Amos to Allison Goldfrapp owe a stylistic and compositional debt to 
her. While she takes risks with the varying mood, overall the album is rooted in 
contemplation of the the world around us. She has come along way since the 
wide-eyed pop urchin who plundered Emily Bronte’s novel, but she has not lost 
her childlike view of things. These are songs of the imagination that transport 
you to a place where you want to daydream compulsively.</p>

<P ALIGN="left">Especially since Lesley Herskovits, loser-hero of John 
Mendelssohn's Waiting for Kate Bush, put off killing himself just so he could 
hear the aforementioned Brit songstress's new album, it's too bad &quot;King of the 
Mountain&quot; doesn't sound like twelve years in the making. Not that it's mom-rock 
or anything. Bush's pipes just don't weird us out like they used to. The song's 
as contrived as it is billowy and ethereal, and she's swapped talk of Wuthering 
Heights for ruminations on Elvis (&quot;Another Hollywood waitress/ Is telling us 
she's having your baby/ And there's a rumour that you're on ice/ And you will 
rise again someday&quot;), all set to 1980s chirps gone new age. Reason enough for 
Lesley Herskovits to live-- still, he's probably wondering, &quot;Baboosh-wha?&quot;</P>

March 20, 2001</P>
<p>With a voice you either love or hate, she belts out a song with a desperation 
that grabs you and won't let go. </p>
<p><br>
The first thing about Kate Bush is her voice. If you hate her, that's probably 
why. It's childish and prickly, and she sweeps through her four-octave range 
with all the inhibition of someone taking a shower in an empty house, seemingly 
oblivious to the fingernails-on-chalkboard effect a voice like that can have. 
Maybe Bush knows this and maybe she doesn't. It doesn't matter, she'll sing 
anyway. </p>
<p>Catherine Bush was born on July 30, 1958, to a doctor and his nurse/dancer 
wife, in the town of East Wickham in Kent, England, 50 miles from Stonehenge. 
The woods around East Wickham, at dusk and in the early morning, take on a misty 
eeriness that carries the scent of something creaking and pagan and scary. And 
the farmhouses there, like the one Kate Bush grew up in, are old, 17th century 
old, and large and drafty and suggestive. It's not hard to imagine that people 
have died in rooms like those from tuberculosis and consumption and childbirth, 
that torrid love letters were urgently delivered and ghosts rattled the windows 
at night. And if you are a bookish teenage girl, and you have the kind of 
imagination that fills in the gaps that life leaves open for you, you will, in a 
place like East Wickham, have a little Kate Bush in you. </p>
<p>Kate Bush was a small person in a small town: meek, delicate and, in the 
recollections of her classmates, annoyingly passive, as reported by Fred 
Vermorel in his &quot;Secret History of Kate Bush: And the Strange Art of Pop.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;She was so nice it was ridiculous,&quot; said one. </p>
<p>Another said: &quot;I was jealous of her. So petite and so pretty. A perfect 
little goody-goody.&quot; </p>
<p>Vermorel quotes Bush saying, &quot;School was a very cruel environment and I was a 
loner. But I learnt to get hurt and I learnt to cope with it.&quot; One way she coped 
was by coming home from school and making up songs at the piano. Loner songs. 
She went inward early on and never came out again. </p>
<p>When Bush was 16, she produced a demo tape with the help of her two musician 
brothers, Paddy and John Carder, who managed to get the tape, through friends, 
to Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. Gilmour liked it and passed it on to EMI, 
which promptly came back to Bush with a remarkable deal: The record company 
wanted her but didn't think she was ready yet. So they gave Bush money and three 
years to &quot;grow up with.&quot; Bankrolled, she dropped out of school and played local 
shows as the KT Bush Band, with her brothers as backup. She took mime classes 
and dance, both of which would always be a part of her work; then in 1977 she 
gave EMI a gigantic hit. </p>
<p>There are probably few things more galling for an established musician than 
reviewers who hover lovingly around work you did 25 years ago, ignoring or 
glossing over anything more recent. This has always been Kate Bush's problem. 
&quot;The Kick Inside,&quot; her first album, went to the top of the British charts almost 
immediately, largely based on the success of &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; her first No. 
1 single and the most commercially successful of her career. </p>
<p>&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; sounded like nothing else. It seemed to come out of some 
raging tornado inside her; it growled and screeched and pitched, as Bush/Cathy 
begs her lover Heathcliff to come join her in death. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely<br>
On the other side from you ... <br>
How could you leave me<br>
when I needed to possess you<br>
I hated you<br>
I loved you too. </p>
<p>Bush has always teetered dangerously at the edge of sentimentality and 
cliché, and her early songs (what one reviewer called her &quot;soft-focus Victorian 
melodramas&quot;) could have gone all wrong had her bizarre phrasing not somehow let 
us know how serious she was. </p>
<p>Bush sang melodramas, but she meant them like truth; those &quot;oohs&quot; aren't 
filler. The conviction in her voice, the baldness and great crushing desperation 
of it, is overpowering. It's the kind of music that grabs your innards and you 
turn it up, squint your eyes with the strain of it. Kate Bush was younger than 
20 when she wrote &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; She couldn't (and still can't) read or 
write music, but she knew how to make a song true, how to up the tension with a 
key change, repeat the chorus with a hardness in her voice. </p>
<p>She was a prodigy, an 18-year-old who looked 35, with an ethereal voice and a 
knack for inventive songwriting. She looks, in photos of the time, 
simultaneously naive and defiant, like someone who doesn't need other people. 
Much later in life, when she was asked in an interview with Rolling Stone why 
she toured so infrequently, Bush replied: &quot;The more I got into presenting things 
to the world, the further it was taking me away from what I was, which was 
someone who just used to sit quietly at a piano and sing and play. It became 
very important to me not to lose sight of that.&quot; </p>
<p>In other words, Bush decided early on that our approval didn't matter. She 
was doing this from herself and largely for herself and if people didn't like 
her, or if they didn't understand her, well then, screw them. </p>
<p>She did everything herself, and it shows in the absolute precision of her 
songs. There's nothing spontaneous about Bush's elaborately produced 
arrangements, from the way she weaves her voice around the Trio Bulgarka, in 
&quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; on the sixth album, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; (1989), to the way she 
mixes in sound effects -- street sounds, bird sounds, artillery shots, wind, 
conversations -- in stereo, sometimes barely audibly. There's a decisiveness 
here, and more than a touch of the perfectionist. Bush was only 21 when she said 
to an interviewer from England's Newcastle Journal: &quot;I'll always be tough on 
myself. But I find the strength in being alone, fighting a battle and emerging 
satisfied that I've done my best. Perhaps that's what is strange about me.&quot; </p>
<p>Kate Bush fan sites commonly and adoringly refer to her &quot;getting her way&quot; 
about everything from the production of an album to the amount of time she has 
to produce it, from the look of a video to the image on her album jackets. She's 
stingy with interviews (and is said to demand veto power over which photos will 
accompany the magazine articles) and as a result of this and her insistent 
aloofness, the interviews that do get published inevitably come off a little 
dull. One Rolling Stone interviewer described the frustration of trying to get 
Bush to speak about her personal life: &quot;Try to pin her down on a matter of 
emotional substance and her expression goes blank, a shutter descends -- clunk! 
-- and that's the end of that.&quot; </p>
<p>Kate Bush wants fame the way Greta Garbo wanted it. She pours her guts out in 
her music and dance and belts out her words with barely a trace of 
self-consciousness, but the edges of her private life -- her relationship with 
bass player Del Palmer, with her brothers, the recent birth of her son Bertie -- 
have been airbrushed out to a maddening obscurity. It took Paddy Bush, Kate's 
brother and longtime musical collaborator (he's responsible for bringing world 
music -- the didgeridoo, Bulgarian choruses, Irish jigs -- to Bush's music), to 
explain her reclusiveness so plainly that you almost like her for it. </p>
<p>&quot;I know this may give her a mystique and make the press all the more curious 
about her, but that's not the intention; it's not a ploy to get her more 
attention. She genuinely doesn't see why people should be interested in her 
personal life and she certainly doesn't like going out to clubs or trendy 
restaurants. It's just not her.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It's the music that says it; it says it eloquently enough,&quot; Kate Bush said 
in an interview with the Toronto Star. Clunk! </p>
<p>&quot;The Kick Inside&quot; was followed quickly by &quot;Lionheart&quot; in 1978, the cover of 
which features Bush, her penchant for leotards and bodysuits firmly established, 
on all fours in a furry catsuit, her hair crimped into a mane. &quot;Lionheart&quot; was 
followed by &quot;Never Forever&quot; in 1980. If &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; offered Victorian 
novels and Feminism 101 (&quot;No we never die/We keep bouncing back/Because we're 
woman!&quot; she exulted), &quot;Never Forever&quot; went dark, winning Bush her goth audience. 
She was getting weirder too: On this album cover she's dressed up as a bat, 
black lace wings outstretched, tongue way out. </p>
<p>She was still young when she made &quot;Never Forever,&quot; and some of her songs gush 
with a naive exuberance that's endearing when it works and saccharine when it 
doesn't. She's crazy for Egypt (&quot;Oh, I'm in love with Egypt!&quot;), the violin (&quot;Get 
the bow going, let it scream to me!&quot;). But it's the last song on the album, one 
called &quot;Breathing,&quot; that really brings out Bush at her hugest, most theatrical, 
over-the-top best. </p>
<p>On &quot;Breathing&quot; she pulls no punches. Her telling of nuclear holocaust starts 
right at the moment of death, at the last gasp. &quot;Chips of plutonium are 
twinkling in every lung,&quot; she sings with so much anguish that it works. It's one 
of the only truly scary songs I know. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>What are we going to do without<br>
Ooh, please, let me breathe<br>
Quick, breathe in deep<br>
Leave us something to breathe<br>
We are all going to die </p>
<p>The drastic scale of this song, the way it ends -- a single synthesized thud 
signaling some kind of global death knell -- would be a little, well, silly if 
it weren't so convincing. Possessed of a confidence so strong, and a sense of 
self-importance so grave, Bush attacks that song like it's the last one she'll 
ever sing. You could laugh at her, but it would be like laughing at a monk; how 
do you argue with someone whose conviction is that strong? Can you help finding 
yourself just a little converted? </p>
<p>It wasn't until &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (1985), Bush's fifth album, that she finally 
became well known in the United States. Even with the success of that album, 
she's better known here as an influence for a generation of young female 
singer-songwriters such as Jewel, Tori Amos and k.d. lang. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was 
big, but Bush's U.S. fame never matched what she'd had in England. </p>
<p>It may be that by the time Americans became aware of Kate Bush we'd already 
decided we liked our women tough. Patti Smith bared her armpit hair on the cover 
of &quot;Easter&quot; and wore her androgyny like a badge. Debbie Harry pouted and 
strutted, and Pat Benatar scowled. When Kate Bush looked at us, if she looked at 
us, she did so blankly, without insult or invitation. She didn't bother to 
provoke. </p>
<p>When female American pop stars weren't tough, they were languid and sexy, two 
things Kate Bush could never be, and she sounded forced whenever she tried. The 
early EMI photos do their damnedest to crank up the sex appeal, but there's 
something a little cold about them, as if she's holding back. Kate Bush is 
beautiful, but at heart, you sense, she never stopped being that overeager girl 
in drama class, the one with the guitar and the black turtlenecks. </p>
<p>Bush was never funny enough, either. Describing her youth, she once recalled, 
&quot;I was aware of a lot of my friends being into things I wasn't into. Like 
sarcasm. It had never been a part of my family -- they still don't use sarcasm.&quot; 
That kind of sobriety is what allows Bush to pull off songs like &quot;Breathing,&quot; 
but sometimes, particularly in her recent work, you want her to take herself a 
little less seriously. </p>
<p>Bush's latest album is not very recent; it came out in 1993. &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; 
was based on the Hans Christian Andersen story about the girl who puts on a 
magic pair of slippers and finds herself unable to stop dancing. Like &quot;Wuthering 
Heights,&quot; this is perfect Kate Bush material. It's got magic and dancing and 
tragedy, and the vaguely sinister mood that permeates so much of her music. </p>
<p>Bush could have toured &quot;The Red Shoes.&quot; Fans are still awaiting a follow-up 
to her only tour, in 1979 -- an elaborately choreographed costume extravaganza 
that necessitated the invention of the first microphone headset. But she chose 
to make a movie instead, opting for the contained and controllable over the 
interactive, and called it &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve.&quot; Like her albums, 
the video was a Bush-only affair, with Kate singing, dancing, acting (along with 
Miranda Richardson and others), directing and presiding over the production. </p>
<p>It wasn't disastrous: Bush's fans are tuned in to the Kate Bush sensibility, 
and the thick symbolism of it fits an aesthetic she's been developing all along. 
She made a film that's as laden with emotion and meaning as anything else she's 
done, but she's like someone remembering a dream she had the night before; Bush 
gets so lost in the story that she forgets whom she's talking to. She leaves her 
audience behind. </p>
<p>&quot;It's not important to me that people understand me,&quot; Bush said in an 
interview after the film's release. And thank God for that. Bush may have lost 
us with &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve,&quot; but it wasn't 
the first time she'd taken the chance. She took us to the apocalypse, after all, 
and if she'd been too concerned with what we'd think of her for that, she never 
would have made the trip. </p>

<p>Now children you may think it's a bit sad to like a track by an artist that 
your Dad fancied over twenty years ago, but Kate Bush deserves your attention. 
In a era of identikit pop stars we should thank our lucky stars that Bush has 
come back from the abyss to grace us with her presence and with 'King of the 
Mountain' she doesn't disappoint. Five minutes of Bush's eerily beautiful voice 
and a windswept ethereal melody proves truly mesmerising. Simplistic in the 
extreme it may be, but a great comeback it is also.</p>

<p>It's the album we, and more than likely you, have been waiting for: the new 
Kate Bush epic, 'Aerial'! </p>
<p>We've been forbidden from telling you about it until now, but, a few days 
ago, we were ushered into a secret room and allowed to listen to the whole darn 
thing. We took some notes, but the man who was pointing the big gun at us (in 
case we tried to steal the CDs) made our handwriting go all trembly. </p>
<p>This is what we could decipher...</p>
<p><b>'King of the Mountain'</b><br>
You know how this one goes. It's the one about Elvis, yetis and Citizen Kane. 
And the one that had some of you going: &quot;Oh it's pretty and everything but it's 
not quite as nuts as we were hoping for!&quot; Well that's true, but it is much more 
than pretty, and is the perfect introduction to an album. Which, luckily, it is!</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty points: 7<br>
Nuts-ometer: 6</font></p>
<p><br>
<b>'Pi'</b><br>
A song about a man obsessed with Pi. Mmm, pie... Kate sings lots of numbers, our 
particular favourite being '59230781'. She's accompanied by a Greek chorus, 
hyperactive bass and pulsing organ. A bit odd.<br>

<p><b>'Bertie'</b><br>
Isn't it funny how songs about people's kids are always rather good, whereas 
having to look at endless photos of said kids with Marmite smeared across their 
chops is one of the lesser levels of hell? This has an almost medieval lute 
thing going on and an instrument called a viol (which we suspect is a viola 
that's had a bit off). A beautiful, warm and carefully structured song, with 
frighteningly perfect vocals. <font color="#FFFFFF"><b><br>

Celebrity</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><br>

October 28, 2005</p>
<p><i>She's glad she's normal...</i><br>
<br>
Kate Bush has slammed contemporary culture’s obsession with celebrity saying it 
is ‘silly’.<br>
<br>
Bush says that she’s glad she has stayed out of the public eye for so long to 
live a “normal” life. <br>
<br>
The 47-year-old told MOJO magazine: &quot;For the last 12 years, I've felt really 
privileged to be living such a normal life. It's so a part of who I am. It's so 
important to me to do the washing, do the Hoovering.<br>
<br>
“Friends of mine in the business don't know how dishwashers work. For me, that's 
frightening. I want to be in a position where I can function as a human being&quot;.<br>
<br>
“A track called ‘Mrs Bartolozzi’ on the new album features a housewife drifting 
off into a dream world while watching her clothes rotate in a dryer.”<br>
<br>
Sounds very interesting Kate!<br>
<br>
Bush also admitted in the exclusive interview that 'King of the Mountain' was 
written nine years ago in 1996 and that other tracks on ‘Aerial’ date back to 
around 1992 when her last album was out.</p>

<p><i>Prefers normal life to 'silly' celebrity culture<br>
</i><br>
The new Kate Bush single is nine years old - she admits in an interview today 
that King Of The Mountain was written in 1996.<br>
<br>
In fact several of the tracks on new album Aerial date from way back in the 12 
year period since her last album, the Red Shoes, in 1993.<br>
<br>
In her only one-to-one press interview Kate also says that she is frustrated by 
the rumour mill that paints her as &quot;some kind of weirdo reclusive that never 
comes out into the world&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends of mine in the business don't know how dishwashers work. For me, that's 
frightening.&quot; Kate Bush&quot;I'm a very strong person and I think that's why actually 
I find it really infuriating when I read, 'She had a nervous breakdown' or 
'she's not very mentally stable, just a weak, frail little creature'.&quot;<br>
<br>
At 47, she has been signed to the same record label since her breakthrough with 
The Kick Inside and number one hit Wuthering Heights in 1978.<br>
<br>
Aerial is her eighth studio album, a double-CD that is released on 7 November.<br>
<br>
In the interview for MOJO magazine she contrasts her normal life as a young 
mother with today's &quot;silly preoccupation with celebritites&quot;:<br>
<br>
&quot;For the last 12 years, I've felt really privileged to be living such a normal 
life. It's so a part of who I am. It's so important to me to do the washing, do 
the Hoovering.<br>
<br>
Friends of mine in the business don't know how dishwashers work. For me, that's 
frightening. I want to be in a position where I can function as a human being&quot;.<br>
<br>
A track called Mrs Bartolozzi on the new album features a housewife drifting off 
into a dream world while watching her clothes rotate in a dryer.<br>

<br>
(5 stars out of 5)</P>
<P ALIGN="left">If a week is a long time in politics then twelve years in the 
music industry is practically the seven ages of man and then some. And yet the 
timing of Kate Bush's absurdly long-awaited comeback is impeccable: the 
Futureheads have recently given her her biggest hit as a songwriter in two 
decades, it's no great a leap of imagination to see her as essentially Alison 
Goldfrapp's mum, and artists as diverse as The Streets and The Mars Volta have 
made entire albums of sequential storytelling. Essentially, then, La Bush is 
either a woman of exceptionally providential synchronicity or absolute genius. 
As you can tell by those booming heads above, it would appear to be the latter.<br>
<br>
Of course, it would be a naive soul that claimed she was ever lacking in 
ambition, but to come back with a double CD is a statement of no little boldness 
regardless. Moreover, it should come as no real shock to discover that CD1 - or, 
as she'd prefer to consider it, <i>'A Sea Of Honey'</i> - is, in fairness, madder than 
a bumper box of frogs dislodged from its perch on a precarious hatstand. <i>'King 
Of The Mountain'</i>, which opens proceedings, you'll already be familiar with as 
the only comeback single in history to be a Bjork'n'Sade Celebrity Deathmatch on 
the subject of Elvis, but, quite frankly, terrific though it is, it's the stuff 
of Westlife compared to what else happens in its wake. For someone whose 
existence since '93 has made Morrissey between <i>'Maladjusted'</i> and <i>'You Are The 
Quarry' </i>appear to have the public profile of Kate Moss, to record a song called 
<i>'How To Be Invisible'</i> is outrageously cheeky. Yet it's stunning regardless, 
combining spacious electronica, military drumming, properly dirty guitars and 
eccentric incantations into what proves to be one of this record's most 
accessible moments in spite of recalling her own, celebratedly difficult <i>'Get 
Out Of My House'</i>. There's plenty more uniqueness besides: <i>'Mrs Bartolozzi'</i>, one 
of the most-discussed tracks here, is a gorgeously piano-driven and surprisingly 
epic marriage of the unsettlingly domestic and complexly carnal, <i>'Joanni'</i> is a 
completely electronic and not-un-Vangelisesque reverie directed to a woman rich 
in mystery and dignity - not unlike its creator, if we're honest - and closing 
on some breathtaking whispery French added to some Muppet-like humming. Courtesy 
of some highly bubbly keyboards and a world of Mick Karny bass, <i>'<font face="Times New Roman">&#928;'</font></i> 
is incredibly moving for a song that's essentially built around the recitation 
of, unless we're mistaken, that selfsame figure to 109 decimal places 
(pretentious? Hell, no more than Spiritualized's glorious <i>'100 Bars'</i>!), and then 
there's <i>'Bertie'</i>, a paean to Bush Jr. that kicks off with a lute introduction, 
changes time signature (yes, there's a lot of that here), and ends up as a 
magnificent madrigal that'll leave Circulus feeling, for once, behind the times. 
As you might've gathered, there aren't exactly loads of records like this doing 
the rounds.<br>
<br>
And then we get to <i>'A Sky Of Honey'</i>, or, more prosaically, CD2, which would seem 
to suggest that its other half is in fact a repository for all the spectacular 
songs Kate wrote that don't fit on this one. Not only is it a self-contained 
entity a la her previous <i>'The Ninth Wave'</i>, but it's rather more personally 
revelatory and singular of purpose than its counterpart. When the excellent<i> 'The 
Red Shoes'</i> came out, Terry Staunton's affectionate review in the NME posited the 
hope that, if the follow-up was inferior, it'd be because Bush was rather 
happier. So he at least will be profoundly chuffed to discover that not only is 
this every bit as ace, but she is in fact more joyful than we've ever known her. 
The nine tracks here blend into each other deliciously, focusing on what must 
amount to 24 hours in the life of a woman who's unafraid to dream but can see 
romance at every turn. Inevitably, the results are staggering, abetted by some 
of the richest vocals of her career and including some truly astounding 
material. <i>'Nocturn'</i> is beauty incarnate, beginning as a widescreen, beatless and 
virtually choral hymn to escaping the strictures of society, while<i> 'Somewhere In 
Between' </i>is as close as she's come yet to drum'n'bass, awash with narcoleptic 
twinkle and swimming in <i>'West End Girls'</i>-like keyboard atmospherics, to say 
nothing of the impossible romance of the arpeggio-heavy <i>'Prologue'</i> or the 
ludicrously wonderful <i>'Sunset'</i>, which alludes to the Beatles' <i>'Blackbird'</i> and 
spends a while as a torch song punctuated by manipulatively lachrymose cello 
before ultimately taking a bizarre left turn into beatific flamenco territory. 
None of which can quite compete with the spectacle of Kate cackling like an 
especially amused slattern or, indeed, the experience of Rolf Harris, playing 
the role of &quot;The Painter&quot;, giving it his best Nick Cave, both of which also 
happen here. Lawks!<br>
<br>
Quite what younger listeners will make of this is, admittedly, anyone's guess, 
but rare - actually, non-existent - is the album of hers you can't say that 
about, and yet she's continued to bewitch newcomers galore since the 70s. 
Heroically, she's delivered again; not only will those approaching afresh enjoy 
an incomparable hour and a half, but longtime Bush believers will find 
themselves treated to an intoxicatingly contemporary fusion of<i> 'The Dreaming'
</i>and <i>'Hounds Of Love'</i>, which is more than anyone could've reasonably demanded. 
It's no coincidence that this starts with<i> 'King Of The Mountain'</i> and ends with 
the lyrics &quot;up, up on the roof, in the sun&quot;; '<i>Aerial'</i> towers over the vast 
majority of even this year's embarrassment of riches, and, with it, Kate Bush 
proves herself not only increasingly influential but also enduringly imperial. 
Worth every day of the wait, and then some.</P>

<P ALIGN="left">Letting more than a decade elapse between albums isn't usually 
advised, but on this 12-years-in-the-making set, Kate Bush proves herself as 
impervious as ever to the music world's changing sonic fashions and short 
attention spans. The double-disc Aerial is divided into two conceptually 
separate components, melding the ethereal and the earth-mother aspects of Bush's 
persona most engagingly, flitting around the edges of Red Shoes-styled rock, 
folk, and Celtic sounds without settling comfortably into any one niche. The 
first disc, subtitled &quot;A Sea of Honey,&quot; is dominated by more accessible 
material, both melodically and topically -- from the piano-led &quot;Mrs. Bartolozzi,&quot; 
an intricately woven tale that makes doing laundry seem like an exercise in 
erotica, to the pulsing &quot;How to Be Invisible,&quot; which bluntly addresses the 
distaste for the spotlight that contributed to Bush's extended career hiatus. 
Such openness is par for the course here, whether Bush is moving toward the 
light, as on the medieval-sounding &quot;Bertie,&quot; written for her young son, or 
dealing with the darkness, as on &quot;A Coral Room,&quot; which revolves around the death 
of her mother. Disc 2, subtitled &quot;A Sky of Honey,&quot; is more abstract but also 
decidedly more focused, given that it's intended to capture the passage of a day 
in the English countryside. Introduced by the sound of songbirds -- a device 
that's both quaint and fitting, given the bucolic music that follows -- the disc 
is unflaggingly upbeat lyrically, with melodies marked by a gentle rolling that 
suggests the hilly terrain of rural Britain. &quot;Sunset,&quot; for instance, conveys an 
impression of waning daylight with a rhythm that stretches languidly, evoking 
memories of The Dreaming. The disc-closing title track, on the other hand, is 
the set's most buoyant, a bright-eyed greeting to a new day, which Bush 
approaches with guileless excitement. That's an ideal way to approach Aerial in 
general -- with the knowledge that something new and beautiful lurks beyond the 
next turn.</P>

<P ALIGN="left">It's often said that a musician's debut represents the 
culmination of a lifetime's worth of experiences, but their sophomore effort is 
usually derived from just the intervening year. By waiting 12 years between The 
Red Shoes and her new double CD, Aerial, Kate Bush has tried to regain that 
lifetime. It's a remarkably coherent recording, reflecting the unique world of 
sound and spirit Bush has inhabited since her debut. The first disc, subtitled A 
Sea of Honey, is a suite of personal reveries. It ranges from &quot;King of the 
Mountain,&quot; a contemplation of unbridled celebrity and its isolation that 
references Elvis and Citizen Kane, to the piano-and-voice study &quot;Mrs. Bartolozzi,&quot; 
an ode to household chores whose chorus is &quot;Sloshy sloshy sloshy sloshy, get 
that dirty shirty clean.&quot; With its Depeche Mode-influenced synth pads, electro 
pulses, and lyric cadences, &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; is vintage Bush pop. But many 
of the songs attain more epic proportions, like the dynamic &quot;Joanni,&quot; a hymn to 
Joan of Arc. It's the second disc--a suite called A Sky of Honey--on which Bush 
really comes into her own. Using metaphors of the turning of the day and the 
flight of birds, she orchestrates a meditation on the cycles of life. Musically 
expansive, she weaves her compositions out of birdsong, subtle orchestrations, 
and jazz trios, showing herself at her experimental best. Embracing her 
relatively new motherhood, as well as the death of her mother, Aerial is a 
deeply personal album, and a welcome return from one of pop music's true icons 
and vocal wonders.</P>

<p>After 12 years of waiting Kate Bush fans finally get their hands on an album 
of new material. A double album-sized helping of new songs should keep most fans 
happy with 16 tracks to delve into. </p>
<p>Disc one is a varied set of numbers which mainly centre around her private 
life, with odes to her son and a moving song about the loss of her mother. But 
at times these songs feel too personal and are hard to decipher with dense and 
difficult melodies. They encompasse a range of musical styles - from folk 
(&quot;Bertie&quot;) to new age (&quot;Pi&quot;) and classic Kate Bush (&quot;How to be Invisible&quot;). 
However, some of these tracks never really achieve lift-off and could have been 
left on the recording studio floor. </p>
<p>The Kate Bush of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;-fame is in there but 
struggles to get out. After the flatness of disc one, the second disc is full of 
surprises. It's an old-fashioned concept album that takes the listener on a 
journey. And what a journey! Bush has written a lyric poem set to music, which 
has an epic quality, transporting the listener to a deeply lush and fertile 
landscape. Lyrically cryptic, but strangely seductive, side two is the album 
Pink Floyd might have made in 1979 if Bush had been their lead singer. </p>
<p>Concept albums are not everyone's cup of tea - but this is a masterpiece.</p>

<p>There aren't many artists who could get away with a 12 year break and come 
back from semi-retirement with an album that has grown men quivering with 
anticipation. Aeriel is undoubtedly an 'event', partly due to EMI's now 
compulsory security measures surrounding the release, but also because Bush's 
absence has only meant that our hearts have grown even fonder of her. </p>
<p>Aerial comes to us in two parts, and it's clear that this isn't an album to 
listen to on 'shuffle' on the iPod. The first disc, subtitled A Sea Of Honey, 
contains seven songs of an intensely personal nature, covering subjects such as 
her mother's death, the domestic routine of having a family, and, erm, 
mathematical formulae. The second disc, A Sky Of Honey, is that old fashioned 
beast - a concept album. </p>
<p>There are few people who could pull off a concept album, but as anyone who's 
heard the wonderful The Ninth Wave from Hounds Of Love will testify, Bush is one 
of the few who can. The conceptual piece follows a day's progress from the 
afternoon, through dusk and nighttime, onto sunrise. It also features Rolf 
Harris reprising his guest appearance on The Dreaming - all as per usual in the 
world of La Bush then. </p>
<p>Of the two discs, the A Sea Of Honey is the most accessible, but A Sky Of 
Honey is the more rewarding. The latter is designed to be listened to in one 
blissful sitting, allowing 41 minutes of beautifully atmospheric music to 
captivate you. The former is more conventional, although whether anything Kate 
Bush produces could accurately be described as conventional is a moot point. </p>
<p>The single King Of The Mountain opens the album, and it feels like an old 
friend coming home. There's a slight reggae lilt to the song, which mentions 
Elvis Presley and evokes Citizen Kane. It appears to be about the empty lives 
led by celebrities (&quot;why does a multi-millionaire fill up his home with 
priceless junk&quot; asks one line), and Bush's voice sounds as good as ever. It's a 
marvelous introduction to a complex, challenging album. </p>
<p>Bush has always walked a fine line between audaciousness and silliness, and 
here she slips into both, sometimes in the same song. A prime example of this is 
the beautiful Mrs Bartolozzi - a woman's ode to her new washing machine. One 
minute, she makes performing the daily wash sound like the most erotic thing on 
earth (&quot;my blouse wrapping itself around your trousers&quot;), then she descends into 
baby talk (&quot;slooshy shoshy shooshy shoshy, get that dirty shirty clean&quot;). 
Bizarrely, despite a repeated and seemingly endless refrain of &quot;washing 
machine...washing machine&quot;, it still works beautifully. </p>
<p>Another highlight is Pi, which features Bush reciting the mathematical 
formula to 112 decimal places, and the almost poppy How To Be Invisible (and how 
much will that title by analysed by the Kate obsessives?). The declaration of 
love to her son, Bertie, despite some rather queasy lyrics, is nicely touching 
and sounds rather like a medieval waltz. She saves the best till last though 
with A Coral Room, a starkly beautiful tribute to her late mother, which sounds 
a distant relation to the heartbreaking A Woman's Work. </p>
<p>The second disc is quite simply a thing of beauty. It would be unfair to pick 
out any particular track, although the jazzy stylings of Sunset are particularly 
nice, and Bush manages to express her wonderment of nature just perfectly in 
Somewhere In Between: &quot;We went to the top of the highest hill, and stopped 
still/It was so beautiful&quot;. </p>
<p>She even manages to get away with sequencing some bird songs and arranging 
them into a rather lovely tune on Aeriel Tal, although the less said about Rolf 
Harris' mercifully brief attempt at singing on The Painter's Link the better. 
Generally though, from the opening coos of the owl on Prelude right through to 
the dramatic rhythms of the excellent title track, this is Kate Bush at her very 
best. </p>
<p>Like all ambitious double albums, Aeriel is not without its flaws, but even 
Bush's moments of failure are much more interesting than those of her 
contemporaries. And when Aeriel works, which it does for the vast majority of 
the album, it sounds sweeter and more beautiful than anything else on earth. 
Let's just hope it doesn't take her another 12 years to make the next one.</p>

<a name="musicomh02">Kate Bush: Mystery Maiden? </a><br>
</strong>MusicOMH.com<br>
by Richard Ings<br>
November 6, 2005</p>
<p><i>Kate Bush is back, 12 years since The Red Shoes, with a double album: 
Aerial. </i></p>
<p><i>Her record label, EMI, have treated the album's launch with the same 
absurd security as the latest releases by Coldplay and Robbie Williams. Advance 
review copies weren't available - for this was meant to be &quot;an event&quot;. </i></p>
<p><i>Does Bush really live up to the hyped Mystery Maiden image? Is she the 
Stanley Kubrick of pop?</i></p>
<p><br>
In the run-up to Aerial's launch, the press were full of stories about Kate 
Bush. She was depicted as a strange, reclusive star who refuses to play the 
traditional PR game.<br>
<br>
And there will, as ever, be the one interview where she expresses her perplexity 
at how she is so utterly misconceived as an ethereal, other-worldly goddess who, 
like some mysterious deity, comes to visit us as irregularly as a minor comet: 
album five in 1985, album six in 1989, album seven in 1993 and now Aerial in 
2005.<br>
<br>
For a persistent researcher, it's not too difficult a task to understand that 
Kate is not quite what she is perceived to be. Time after time, she has uttered 
the same amazement at how far her reputation precedes her and how little it 
resembles her. &quot;People have (a preconception) of me as a sort of big Bronte fan, 
a Tolkien fan, the pre-Raphaelite lady,&quot; she told VH1 in 1989, &quot;which I think is 
actually a very big misconception.&quot; In 1983 she said &quot;if people look at the 
album covers and buy the records then listen to them and perhaps read the lyrics 
then a lot of this mystery about me will fade.&quot; <br>
<br>
Her rare interviews consistently reveal a woman who is more earthy than 
ethereal. This always seems out of kilter with the perception of her as an 
alabaster beauty who floats just above the ground, probably in that red dress 
she wore in the Wuthering Heights video.<br>
<br>
She is no stranger to using the language of the gutter. Of the infamous Gered 
Mankowitz portrait of her in a leotard, which caused traffic havoc by being 
placed on the back of London buses, she told the NME: &quot;I suppose the poster is 
reasonably sexy just because you can see my tits&quot;. Well, quite. To the Record 
Mirror, she once said: &quot;Some lyrics take a long time to come, others just come 
out like diarrhoea .&quot; Charming. &quot;If you're writing a song... then you have a 
responsibility to (the fans). It's important to give them a positive message 
(which) is far more effective than having a wank and being self-pitiful.&quot; 
Lovely.<br>
<br>
Her fear of the press and how she has been misinterpreted, and her 
protectiveness about her privacy, has led her to a long-held position that she 
prefers the music to speak for itself, and declines to give personal details in 
interviews because she's there to talk about the music. But, reflecting on this 
in RAW magazine in 1989, she revealed how much this has actually worked in her 
favour. It is worth quoting her in full:<br>
<br>
&quot;I went through a period where I didn't actually speak to anyone (in the press) 
at all. Or if I did, I was very careful about when I did it and who I spoke to. 
And I think two very positive and interesting things came out of that... <br>
<br>
&quot;Firstly, I think I achieved what I wanted...suddenly my music started speaking 
for me instead of this personality whom the press had tremendous preconceptions 
about anyway. And through that, I think people took my music more seriously. <br>
<br>
&quot;And, secondly, it created this sense of mystery about what I did; I think that 
helped a lot as well with the way people were ready to receive my music.&quot;<br>
<br>
What this suggests is that Bush is acutely aware of how keeping quiet actually 
enhanced her reputation as a musician. The public and more particularly her 
fanatical followers love to know what they cannot find out. Hence her refusal to 
tour since the rock pantomime of 1979 has taken on comparable mythological 
status to awaiting the Second Coming. Yet it has nothing to do with Bush being 
reclusive and shy which is the reputation it has garnered. <br>
<br>
Reading between the lines of what she has said about touring being exhausting 
and that she is not being happy being herself on stage, preferring to play the 
characters she has invented for the song, it seems clear that she cannot commit 
to doing anything by halves. Like taking twelve years to finish an album, for 
example.<br>
<br>
Indeed, Bush has said that part of the problem she has is that she is afraid to 
let something go and be publicly apprised in case it falls on their approbation. 
She told You magazine in 1989 that &quot;it's very hard to stand back from an album, 
allow it to be finished and then let people evaluate it for what it is. It's a 
terrifying process for me. And consequently making the album in the first place 
gets harder and harder for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The public and the press like to believe the myth that Kate is a Howard 
Hughes-like genius who makes occasional forays into the world of mere mortals, 
like a tooth fairy leaving a pound. It would be rude to suggest that she 
cultivates this, and her candour when she is interviewed suggests that she could 
easily reveal something personal she had not intended to. EMI, with the security 
around Aerial at a maximum before its release, will not be hurt by the hype 
about the return of the mysterious Bush. But is the excitement reserved for new 
Kate Bush material justified by her historical output?<br>
<br>
The evidence is mixed. For every pounding Hounds of Love, there's a pompous Army 
Dreamers, and for every sensual Kick Inside, an unintentionally hilarious 
Dreaming complete with sheep noises. You may disagree about where the unevenness 
lies, but it is still there. <br>
<br>
Her latest single, King of the Mountain, which takes Bush's most successful 
songwriting formula of layering riffs and rhythms upon one another in increasing 
intensity over the course of five minutes, is accompanied by the cheesiest video 
ever which actually tells us more about the meaning behind the song than we 
really want to know. <br>
<br>
When Bush grounds her musical electricity visually, it often loses much of its 
spark. Cloudbusting is a sensual delight of looping string phrases which builds 
through her trademark drum sounds and floating, chorus-light melodic flow to an 
intense conclusion. The video, on the other hand, is an ambitious piece of 
kitsch.<br>
<br>
In a sense, there is a tension between the Kate Bush we think we want (the one 
who gives us an album a year, tours constantly and tells all about her private 
life to Word magazine) and the Kate Bush we actually need. While the 
mythologising is not of Bush's doing (except insofar as she realises its 
artistic fringe benefits), it sustains her in the public's mind as an isolated 
genius whose wisdom and creativity are barely worthy of us.<br>
<br>
I must confess: I too love the myth. Aged eight, I heard the dramatic beauty of 
The Man With the Child in his Eyes and fell in love. Later, when I learned how 
young she had been when she wrote the song (16), my frustrated teenage sexuality 
yearned for similarly aged young women who might have such sensual maturity. And 
her ability to stay true to an artist's vision (except on, in my view, 
misconceived forays into politics such as Breathing) has meant that she has 
dodged bullets around incest and implied paedophilia in her songs. As she 
herself has said, she's glad that The Sun doesn't (or can't) read her lyrics.<br>
<br>
I have bored people silly at parties with my passion for the woman who has added 
music to poetry and, possibly more importantly, created some of the most 
heartbreaking melodies ever written (Moments of Pleasure is a particular gem). 
Freak or unique, she has never been less than sum of her parts. <br>
<br>
Much as she may not wish to accept it, her Celtic looks, eccentric sexual 
persona and that picture of her tits in a leotard means that she has a power 
over certain heterosexual men that is difficult to avoid. As Johnny Rotten said, 
at the Q awards a few years ago when she received a lifetime achievement award, 
&quot;I love you, your music is @#%$ brilliant.&quot; I know exactly how he feels.<br>
