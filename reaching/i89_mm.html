IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: The October 21, 1989 Melody
Maker interview 
</P>
<P>Sorry, folks, IED sent this in a few days ago but for some reason (no doubt
an  error of IED's) it never showed up. So here it is again. Note once again
that IED's  comments are always enclosed in brackets &lt;&gt;, so anyone who
doesn't want to read  them can just skip over them. Anything in parentheses ()

</P>
<P>  The Language of Love 
</P>
<P>by Steve Sutherland 
</P>
<P>With her Sensual World LP being hailed as one of this year's best and the
single  of the same name still high in the charts &lt;This was already untrue at
the time this  interview was published&gt;, Kate Bush celebrates her triumphant
return with  Steve Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>An hour before she tells me I have a lovely energy and just about makes my
year,  she apologises for keeping me waiting. &quot;I just had to have a fag,&quot;
she says, dogging a  butt in the ashtray. &quot;I was just dying for one.&quot;
for one.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Something isn't right here. I mean, I don't know who I thought Kate Bush 
would be when I walked into the downstairs room of Durrant's Hotel where she is 
drinking tea and, but I didn't think Kate Bush would smoke. 
</P>
<P>I think perhaps I was expecting her to be like Emma Thompson, a woman whose 
precocious talent has been critically downplayed because it springs from a
privileged  background rather than one of strife or suffering; a woman not so
much other  -worldly as cocooned from the weird old world for her own safety and
sanity. 
</P>
<P>I think I still expected to meet a hippy nymph despite the evidence of my
ears.  Sitting in the foyer under the influence of her new LP, watching the
first, solitary  autumn leaf blow in off the street onto the Axminster, and
reading symbolism into  the American photographer asking for the price labels to
be removed from the olde  worlde mementoes on show in the Regency cabinets, I
must have ignored the fact  that only Prince has been more consistently
intriguing &lt;More? More ??&gt;, more  exuberantly experimental, more willing
to take risks for the sake of pure music in  the Eighties. Only the pneumatic
Purple Rain pumped blood faster than Hounds of  Love, only Around the World in a
Day repatterned the embroidery of pop with the  same haughty disregard for
convention as The Sensual World, her seventh LP if you  her seventh LP if you
count the greatest hits compilation, 
</P>
<P>I think I thought Kate Bush would be Green and ozone-friendly--all ballet
shoes  and Laura Ashley frocks. The St. Michael's blouse and slacks, the tiny
navy socks  and no shoes, the Benson &amp; Hedges freaked me out. 
</P>
<P>I think I thought of Kate Bush as a precious oasis in a tarnished world, a
pearl  cast before the swinish hordes. I gues I forgot Kate Bush is a genius. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think most people tend to think of me as the weird Wuthering Heights
 singer--that is definitely the image that's stuck with most people, which I
find  extraordinary because it's...so long ago.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She laughs and, when she laughs, her cheeks dimple like a Disney chipmunk. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Extraordinary is a very good word, I think. I don't know why people
are still  keen on...I don't know why people bother with me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Really? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Really.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She's so small, it't extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>It took Kate Bush four years to make The Sensual World, and we've been given
 an hour to talk about it. Great. 
</P>
<P>I think about telling Kate how surprised I am she's so small, or how shocked
I  am she smokes, but time is not on my side so I decide, instead, to tell her
how  delighted I am that she's come to the conclusion that the past and the
future aren't  beyond changing. The album sounds so optimistic in an era when
absolutely  everything appears to be falling apart. 
</P>
<P>&lt;Kate naturally loves this interpretation, but the fact is that the album
is certainly  as loaded with dark and pessimistic images and ideas as it is with
optimistic ones. In  IED's opinion Sutherland has swotted up on what Kate has
been saying recently, and  is now rephrasing a lot of her own preferences in
conversation with her, as though  they were his own ideas rather than borrowed
ones, precisely in order to ingratiate  Kate. It works, and it may even be a
good idea, since the other methods of engaging  her in conversation have seldom
produced great publishable material.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, thank you! Thank you so much! That's really how I wanted it to be
but,  talking to a lot of friends and that, they feel it's a dark album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I didn't think that at all... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, great.&quot; 
</P>
<P>...I thought some of the situations were dark, but the way they're resolved
is  optimistic. &lt;What about the way Heads, We're Dancing is &quot;resolved&quot;?
What about  the way Deeper Understanding is &quot;resolved&quot;? What about the
way Never Be Mine is  &quot;resolved&quot;?&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, that's great. Thank you. Yes. That's really great. I'm so pleased
you heard  it like that. You see, for a lot of people it's so complicated to
listen to, and that  worries me, because I like the idea of people being able to
listen to it easily  and...uh...I don't want to confuse people but, for some
people, it's very hard for  them to even take it in, let alone sort of get
anything out of it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I do think art should be simple, you see. It shouldn't be complicated,
and I think,  in some ways, this has come across a bit complicated.&quot; &lt;This
is one of Kate's &quot;new&quot;  ideas--opinions which she has not really made
prior to 1989, but which she has been  repeating in multiple interviews since
the release of the new album. IED finds it  highly intriguing, because it is so
vague and so patently at odds with the way her  own art has always been--and
continues to be--made.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Maybe that's because, for me, the album's about relationships--the
relationship  between language and emotion, the relationship between language
and music, the  relationship between emotion and music and how all this
expresses, or more crucially  fails to express, the relationship between people.
And relationships, as we all know,  are never ever easy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;How interesting. Could you give me an example?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, in Love and Anger you say, &quot;It's so deep I don't think that I can
speak  about it,&quot; as if language betrays your aims, and then you go on to
say, &quot;We could be  like two strings beating/Speaking in sympathy,&quot;
which suggests that music, rather  than language, comes closest to expressing
our emotions. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah! Actually, Love and Anger was an incredibly difficult song for me
to write  and, when people ask me what it's about, I have to say I don't know
because it's  not really a thought-out thing. It was so difficult for me to
write that: in some ways,  I think, &lt;it's&gt; about the process of writing
the song: I can't find the words; I don't  know what to say. This thing of a
big, blank page, you know: it's so big...It's like it  doesn't have edges around
it, you could just start anywhere.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She studies her socks for a moment. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes...um...I don't think I was consious of it, but it's something I'm
aware of  when writing songs. &lt;Has IED missed something here, or did Kate
just contradict the  first half of this sentence in the second half?&gt; There's
such a lot you need to say  through words. And it's a beautiful thing, language:
actually being able to put words  together and say something...maybe say two
things in one line. But, like you say, it  misses the mark so often.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You created your own language, too, don't you? It seems when you're at your 
most sexual, your most emotional, you emit...the only word I can find for it is
noises,  but that sounds too crude. Your &quot;Mmh yes&quot; on The Sensual
World (the most  heavenly sound ever on Top of the Pops ) and your &quot;Do-do-do-do-do&quot;
in Heads,  We're Dancing are like cries that language has deserted you or, more
positively, an  attempt on your behalf to merge words and music, to create a new
emotional  language from a combination of meaning and sound. I remember you used
to go  &quot;Wow!&quot; when words failed you. It shivers me. It's thrilling. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think that's a lovely thing to say...Yes, often words are
sounds for me. I  get a sound and I throw it in a song and I can't turn it into
a word later because it's  actually stated itself too strongly as a sound. Like,
in Love and Anger, the bit that  goes 'Mmh, mmh, mmh' was there instantly and,
in itself, it's really about not being  able to express it differently. Do you
know what I mean?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Indeed I do. Liz of the Cocteau Twins does it all the time. She never sings
a lyric  as such, it's all noises. &lt;Actually this is not true. Fraser has
admitted that she picks  real words and names from dictionaries, but simply
throws them together without a  narrative foundation.&gt; But somehow, the way
you burst language, the tension that  leads to the victory of sound over sense
whips your music into another dimension.  It's the frustration that gives your
songs dynamic, and the way you remedy it that  makes them attractive. Most of
the Sensual World LP seems to be saying, &quot; This can  be worked out .&quot; &lt;IED
does not agree. Fully half the songs on the album simply do  not bear this claim
out.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Between a Man and a Woman is almost a soap opera situation, with you trying
to  drive off any external interference which might ruin the chances of a
relationship's  natural growth. It's like you're saying we live in a fast
culture--fast food, fast-edit  TV, disposable pop, disposable sex--and, if we
don't get instant gratification, we're  not interested. You seem angry and
determined. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that's nice, because when people ask me about this song, in
terms of  having to talk about it, it's rubbish. But yes, I think you're right,
it is perhaps about  how you actually have that choice sometimes, whether to
interfere or not. &lt;This was  not Sutherland's idea at all, but Kate's.&gt;
You know, there's this tendency to want to  leap in and take over and control:
'Oh, I know best!'; when I think a relationship is  a very delicate balance:
it's very easily tipped, and then needs to be refound again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>No matter how precarious, though, you think love's worth it, don't you? 
Reaching Out is full of danger--the child reaching out to feel the fire, for the
hand  that smacks...You endorse the instinct. 
</P>
<P>Rocket's Tail probably sums up what I'm getting at best. In the beginning
you  scoff at someone else's romantic notion. They say they want to be the
glorious  rocket, and you say you only see &quot;A stick on fire/Alone on its
journey/Home to the  quickening ground/With no one there to catch it&quot;. But
a verse later, you're putting  on your pointed hat and strapping the stick to
your back. It seems to me that love  triumphs over cynicism and, whether you're
dashed to the ground and destroyed by  throwing yourself into a relationship or
whether you survive doesn't matter. The  risk, the vulnerability's worth taking.
It's the only way you're alive, and anything's  better than the loneliness of,
say, Deeper Understanding. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah! Yeah! There's a lot of that going on on the album, and I'm
really pleased  that you should hear it: like, 'It might not be easy, but there
is a way of getting out  of it, so try not to worry too much.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Perversely, you seem to revel in the mess our emotions can get us into.
Having  said all that about language wanting to be music, you then take some
poor soul and  allow music to mislead her into the most dangerous relationship
of all. In Heads  We're Dancing, the girl surrenders to the rhythm and ends up
dancing with Hitler! 
</P>
<P>(It's okay--she survives. The man wasn't Hitler when she danced with him, he
 was just a man. He became Hitler later. We all have the capacity for infinite
evil.  And infinite good.) &lt;This parenthetical aside was evidently not
addressed to Kate  during the interview, but was added by Sutherland to his text
afterward. There is  furthermore no support in the song's text for for
Sutherland's interpretation.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Even under these extreme circumstances, there's no regret. Again you're
saying  it's worth giving yourself up to another because anything's better than
being alone.  &lt;This is a very weird way of interpreting the text of the song.
IED would say that the  narrator's wry admission that she just stood there
laughing even after learning who  it was she had danced with was an extremely
bitter comment on the human  consciousness.&gt; There are so many images of
loneliness on the album... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I think there are. I suppose, in relationships, there's a lot
that can go wrong  very quickly, and you have to work at them, which, I think,
is something a lot of  people aren't aware of until they grow up a bit. These
things gradually reveal  themselves to you, don't they? 
</P>
<P>&quot;You're right--most of my songs are about relationships, probably
always have  been, really. That feels to me how things are, really:
relationships towards other  things and people, and how we actually manage to
make these forms of contact...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding is the most extreme song on the album. &lt;'Most
extreme?'  This seems a very arbitrary selection.&gt; How do you feel about the
character who's so  desperately, pathetically lonely, (s)she's formed an
addictive relationship with a  computer? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, wherever you live, chances are you won't know your neighbours,
you  won't even know the person who lives next to you. But I see this song set
in  America, just because it's so much more extreme out there: people don't go
out of  their houses, they watch the television, they can shop from the
television, they speak  to people on the phone. If they want, they needn't have
any form of human  communication of a real kind at all, and I think that's being
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You know, a couple of years ago there was a lot of news about how
women were  divorcing their husbands because they were spending all their time
with their  computers--they were in there all night. I suppose it's still
happening. And this song  is about this very intense relationship that
developed, where this person spends all  their time with computers. They talk to
the computer and the computer talks back. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose I really liked the idea of deep, spiritual
communication--deep love  which should come from humans--coming from the last
place you'd expect it to, the  coldest piece of machinery. And yet I do feel
there is a link. I do feel that, in some  ways, computers could take us into a
level of looking at ourselves that we've never  seen before, because they could
come in from outside all this...I'm not really sure  what I'm saying...&quot; 
</P>
<P>She laughs and takes a sip of tea. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think a lot of things in Nature are almost programme-based, and a
lot of things  that we do are very mechanical, so maybe somehow going right
through a computer,  almost so that you come out the other side--going through
all that science--will take  us to something very spiritual but very earthy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was very inspired by Stephen Hawkins &lt;sic--this is almost
certainly  Sutherland's mistaken spelling, not Kate'. The man she is referring
to is Stephen  Hawking.&gt; Have you heard about this guy? I think he was an
Oxford scientist.  &lt;Cambridge.&gt; He's very ill and, basically, he's coming
up with how everything is  created...or not created, as he sees it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I saw him on television, and it was so moving: this guy who's so close
to the  answer of it all, in a body that was desperately...it was going, and
quickly. And he  was fighting against the time he had left, and yet...Here was
this guy who was  probably the closest to knowing it all, and he was speaking
through this  voice-processor. It was almost, for me, like hearing the voice of
God. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What he was saying was so spiritual, it was not like a scientist. It
was someone  saying, 'Well, look: it wasn't ever created and it won't end, it
just is .' You know,  this wonderful conceptualism is almost beyond words,
because he's gone so far  through the process. Words can't explain what he's
discovered.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I find that a bit scary. I wonder if we want the answer? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I wonder if we'd understand it! Even if we knew the answer, we
probably  wouldn't understand it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But if we ever found out, definitely, whether there's a God or not, it would
be  like definitely finding out there are aliens from outer space: the human
race  couldn't handle it, couldn't cope with not being the centre of the
universe. And  what if we found out there definitely isn't a God, what then? The
truth would be  too much to bear. The idea of death being an inconceivable
nothing would drive us  mad with the contemplation of extinction. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We seem to be very much in the era of reason, and I think science is
the  ultimate example of that. The other side is the instinctive, which is not
logical on any  level. Perhaps it's the putting together of the two. You know,
like what you were  just saying there about aliens? Most people's response would
be that it's just not  possible because their reason says so, but then an
instinctive person might feel, 'Yes,  this is so's because it just feels right.

</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe we've lost touch with our instincts, so it's become very
important for us  to work out logical explanations for things all the time,
which I think is a bit of a  shame, really.&quot; 
</P>
<P>After months of experimentation, Kate Bush decided the Trio Bulgarka were
the  closest thing she'd ever heard to the voice of God. She first heard Yanka
Rupkhina,  Eva Georgieva and Stoyanka Boneva--Bulgaria's foremost vocal
trio--just after  she'd finished Hounds of Love, when her brother, Paddy, played
her one of their  few recordings available in the Western world. &lt;This was
before any of the  now-popular compilation albums had been released in the west.&gt;

</P>
<P>&quot;I was devastated. Everyone I know who hears it is. At the time I
didn't really  think in terms of us working together but, the more I listened to
it, the more I  thought how wonderful it would be, and it seemed to gradually
make more and  more sense to try and get them involved in the album. Still, I
needed a lot of time to  gather the courage to do it. I was scared about it not
working.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Did you think you might cheapen their gift? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh God, absolutely. It was a big responsibility. And what was so nice
is that they  really enjoyed the experience. I mean, when we first met them,
they asked us into  their house, and they'd made a big meal for us: it was a big
social event, and yet  we'd never met. And within minutes, someone said, 'Oh,
why not sing them a  song?' So Eva, the eldest one, picked up the phone,
listened to the dialing tone, went  'Mmmmmmh,' and they all tuned to that, and
just burst into song! 
</P>
<P>&quot;They were sitting over the kitchen table and, within minutes, I was
just  completely taken by them and the tears just...And they loved this, because
it meant  that the'd got through. Everyone who was with me was really moved--you
could see  people just trying to wipe the tears away. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I was working on Deeper Understanding, the idea was that the
verses  were the person and the choruses were the computer talking to the
person. I  wanted this sound that would almost be like the voice of angels:
something very  ethereal, something deeply religious, rather than a mechanical
thing. And we went  through so many different processes, trying vocoders, lots
of ways of affecting the  voice, and eventually it led to the Trio Bulgarka. 
</P>
<P>&quot;it made absolute sense--you know, this loving voice--because they have
a certain  quality: their music feels so old and deep. It's really powerful;
such intense, deep  music that, in some ways, I think it is like the voice of
angels.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's as if they're possessed of it, rather than it's theirs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah! Absolutely! Beautiful music! Old music like that is magical, and
it can be  preserved and kept. We must have lost so much of it all over the
world. It must have  just gone!&quot; 
</P>
<P>If we take it as read that the album is concerned with relationships and the
 problems of communication and how these problems aren't insurmountable, I 
imagine working with the Trio Bulgarka must have put this to the test and
enriched  the LP through the experience of recording. I mean, I assume you
couldn't talk to  each other. I assume you had no mutual language, and yet you
created together  through music. &lt;IED, ever the cynic, submits that this
sounds an awful lot like  Sutherland had read the NME interview or seen the
Rhythms of the World  programme, and was here pretending that this observation
was original.&gt; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, and it was extraordinary. They didn't speak a word of English
and we  didn't speak any Bulgarian, but we could communicate through music, so
that  absolutely transcended barriers. There were things we needed to translate
but,  generally, we communicated emotionally, and I just loved that. They'll
come up and  give you a big cuddle. They'll just come up and touch you and
cuddle you, and you  can go up and give them a big cuddle, and I really enjoyed
that kind of  communication, it felt very real and direct to me. I'd never
experienced that kind of  communication before. It's something we could do with
more of. It's a lovely thing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;They were over not long ago, and we hadn't seen each other for a while
and,  when the translator went out of the room, we all started chatting. I don't
think any  of us knew what the other one was talking about but everyone was
talking at the  same time, and we were all chatting away, about six of us in a
room. Then the  translator walked back in and suddenly everyone felt really
self-conscious and shut  up. It all went quiet and we all sat and looked at the
floor. It was a really great  moment, really great!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Apart from The Cure's sumptuously creepy Lullaby, The Sensual World is
surely  unrivalled as the most seductive single released this year. Like her
very first release,  Wuthering Heights, its inspiration lies in literature, but
it expands on its theme with  an insight and maturity which would have been
unthinkable to the girl who rewrote  Bronte. &lt;This is highly debatable.&gt; 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is about Molly Bloom, the fountain of lust and life in
James  Joyce's dauntingly super-realist novel, Ulysses. It's a book that't
defeated my  attempts to read it again and again, and I confess to Kate that it
gives me a hell of a  lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>&quot;God, yes!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why Molly Bloom? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I just thought it was such an extraordinary piece of writing.
It's  so...ooh!...It's such a beautiful style. It's like trains of thought
continually  tumbling...You know, tumbling speech, and not kind of...'stopped.'
I first heard her  speak being read years ago by...I'm pretty sure it was
Siobhan McKenna. &lt;There is  in fact a recording of McKenna's reading of this
soliloquy, so Kate is almost certainly  remembering correctly.&gt; And it had
such a femininity about it. That was my first  exposure to it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And it just came together with this song. We'd written this piece of
music in the  studio, and I thought, 'What about putting the Molly Bloom speech
together with  this?' So I went and grabbed the book, and it worked perfectly.
It just scanned--the  whole song. But, unfortunately, when I applied for
permission to use the words, they  wouldn't let me. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Obviously, I was very disappointed. It was completely their
prerogative, you  know, they don't have to give their permission. But it was
very difficult for me,  then, to reapproach the song. In some ways I wanted to
just leave it off the album.  But we'd put a lot of work into it--the Irish
musicians had worked hard--so it was a  matter of trying to rewrite the lyrics
so it kept the same rhtymic sense, because the  words are so rhythmic; and to
keep the sense of sensuality as well, without using the  Joyce lyrics. So it all
kind of turned into this piece where Molly Bloom steps out of  the book into
real life, where she can actually reach out and touch things in the real  world.
In a lot of ways, because of their lack of co-operation, it transformed the 
track into something else.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When you say the Joyce piece had a &quot;femininity&quot; about it, what do
you mean? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's difficult to put into words, but I think, on the last album,
Hounds of Love,  particularly in the production, I wanted to try and get across
a sense of power, and  the way I related to that was very much what I consider
very good male music--the  kind of power I found there was not what I found in a
lot of females' music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not that I was trying to write like a man or anything--but there
was this  level of approaching the album, soundwise, that I think had a male
energy. But I  didn't want to do that on this album. I wanted to do it as a
woman, not as a woman  working around a man's world. This all sounds awful!&quot;

</P>
<P>It's making sense. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, is it? Good! The Sensual World was very much a chance for me to
express  myself as a female in a female way, and I found that original piece
very positive  female talking...That's the only way I can describe it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's like a sister piece to This Woman's Work. The Sensual World is
completely  self-absorbed in its own erogenous pleasure, while This Woman's
Work, plaintively,  over stark acoustic piano, reviews the man's side of the
relationship and, really, pities  him.

<P>&quot;John Hughes, the American director, was doing a film called She's
Having a  Baby --a great film, very nice and comic. And he had this scene which
he wanted  me to write a song for where it gets very heavy. The film's about
this guy who gets  married and he likes being a kid, really--very much up in the
clouds--and she gets  pregnant and they go into hospital, and she's rushed off
becuase the baby's in the  breach position. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And suddenly there he is, just left in the waiting room by himself.
It's probably  the first time in his life he's had to grow up. It's a lovely
piece of film, where he's  looking back on their times together--there are
scenes where they're decorating  their flat, going for walks and things--and it
was very much just a matter of telling  the story in words--how, at times like
that, you tend to go into something akin to  guilt mode and you think of all the
things you should have done and you just didn't.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I think men are bigger babies than women. I don't think we grow up so fast. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe men can avoid more situations than women in terms of facing
things. I  guess there are things for women that are different and they tend to
deal with life  situations rather than perhaps the business world or whatever.
God, this sounds so  sexist...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Not at all. Women give birth, they are physically part of the creative
process. It's  as if their orgasm grows and bears fruit, whereas men fuck and
that's it--it's a  release, something we get rid of rather than something we
gain. Then it all builds up  again, and we can't handle it. I think women are
far stronger emotionally. Men  can't cope with emotions. We get frustrated and
aggressive and destructive because  we can't express ourselves, whereas women
seem to embody their feelings better.  Something positive grows from them.. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I think you're right. It's very hard on all of us but, yet,
through the process  of giving birth, I'm sure women are much stronger than men,
and it's incredibly  hard on them that they should not be able to show their
emotions when actually it's  okay to be weak.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We men are confused. The trouble with the invention of the notion of sexism
and  the paranoia surrounding it is that the only way we can deal with it is
based on a  fallacy. We think that, just because women should quite rightly have
equal rights and  equal opportunities, the sexes are the same. But we're
not--women are aliens to us,  we don't understand you at all. You speak a
different language altogether. We're  different creatures entirely. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Absolutely, I'm with you 100 per cent. I couldn't agree more. I think
it's awful  what's happening to people's sense of their own sexuality. Women are
made to feel  awkward about expressing themselves as women in a man's world, so,
 subconsciously, a lot of the time, they're behaving like men because they don't
 know how strong they're supposed to be. Then again, women's lib has left men in
a  lot of areas where they don't know how to behave in case they get called
sexist, a  pig, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We are different, and we should be helping each other. Unfortunately
there was  such a lot of shit to get through that it was a battle, but I don't
think it need be.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The album seems to be saying, &quot;If you find yourself in a tricky
situation, follow  your instincts--just behave the way if feels right and at
least you're being true to  yourself, irrespective of the outcome.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, absolutely...And what an incredibly difficult thing to apply to
life. I think  there are some very good things going on to help us through. I
must say, for me, the  comdy in this country has been really educational. You
know, Ben Elton and The  Comic Strip--all those people you can't really call
alternative comedians anymore  because they've become mainstream. I think
they've really done a lot to stop it  being fashionable to be humorous with
sexist overtones. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It used to be very hip to make fun of women. Old comedy was all about
treating  women as a threat and, therefore, making fun of them. And I think
they've really  changed a lot of that. They've done so much for men and women
because now, in  most circles, among people our age, if you make a sexist joke,
it's really considered  tasteless. I think that's a fantastic step forward. And
to see people like Dawn French  and Jennifer Saunders out there doing comedy
being women as women is brilliant. 
</P>
<P>&quot;They're just out there doing it and, the more women can be strong
enough to do  that, the more it'll help everybody. It used to really scare me
the way women were  portrayed in comedy, and the way they behaved: either they
were bitching off other  women and being sexist themselves, or they were
allowing themselves to be used as  sex objects, either positively or
negatively--they were either very beautiful or very  stereotypically ugly. Women
would just be batted around from these extremes, but  that hold's been broken
now and, as comedy's so much part of our nature in this  country, so much a part
of our roots, to break old things like that is an incredible  step.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What you've achieved musically is pretty incredible too--the way you can do 
exactly what you want exactly when you want without anyone interfering. You're 
very much admired for your independence, and most of the women I know who 
aspire to make a living making music would rather be you than, say, Madonna. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, really! Ha!&quot; You seem to live the life you want to, almost in
a world of your  own, whereas Madonna's constantly playing corporate games. She
has to compete,  you don't 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I'm incredibly lucky to be in this position now, although it's
not  something I'm aware of without people sparking off my realisation. I think 
Madonna's very clever, and I think she's very aware of what she's doing, don't 
you? I think that's the game she wants to play, and she seems to have her heart 
stuck on being an actress, and absolutely good luck to her because she's
really...talk  about on the front line! She's such an exposed person. I would
find that so difficult  to live with. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I guess I have fought for what I want, but you always have to do that.
I am very  lucky. But it's hard to keep up that level of concern, particularly
when you feel the  music business becoming very mercenary--there are so many
things that encourage  you to abuse it. It's so horrid. It's such a shame.&quot;

</P>
<P>Do you listen to much pop music? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not much when I'm making albums. In the evenings I probably watch a
film or  comedies or something visual to take me away from my ears. But, in
between  albums, yeah--there's some great stuff. Johnny Lydon's new album is
just great, and  I heard some tracks off the new Jeff Beck album and they were
great, too. I think  there's been some good, good music out there. Everyone in
the music industry's  been wearing black for, what, the last four years? Well, I
think everyone's in  mourning for good music. It's a show of mourning--'Look,
here we are, where's  the music?' And there's little snatches now, and that's
exciting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you hypersensitive to music? I mean, just because you make music that 
moves other people, that doesn't necessarily mean that music moves you, does it?

</P>
<P>&quot;God, I'd love to think that my music could move people, because it
doesn't  happen to me often, but, when it has, it's a lovely experience. The
Bulgarians did it  to me, and Nigel Kennedy (the young classical violinist who
also plays on the album)  sometimes makes me cry.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There are so many musical cliches, and you're breaking them down. Using
Davey  Spillane's Uillean pipes and Dave Gilmour's guitar and the Trio, you've
succeeded  in creating a new, uncategorisable sort of music which isn't
anything, it's just music.  I think that's important, because it makes people
open their ears to stuff. It enriches  their lives. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that's lovely. What a really nice thing to say. Um...I think
everything  seems too easy to categorise, and...I think that's just such a
lovely thing to say...&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's like what you were saying about relationships--you've done it with
music.  You've given it time to grow, to see if it's compatible. And it sounds
natural, not  cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think that's fantastic...that's just such a nice thing to say,
that's really  great...wonderful, absolutely wonderful. Because I think this is
really what music  is--a continual process of people experimenting, taking this
and that and putting  them together: all these experimental marriages. And when
they work, I think  that's such an important step, because then they've created
a new music of a sort  which then goes on to evolve. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And, if it doesn't work, that's absolutely fine, too, because that
shows you what  doesn't work. So, if you feel this is a natural union, that's
really good. I suppose I'd  like to think that, as long as I really care about
making music, there will always be  people out there who want to hear music that
is cared for.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The hour's up and Kate thanks me for saying such lovely things about her
album.  I thank her for making such a great album, and she thanks me for
thanking her,  and says I have a lovely energy, and...shucks...We blush a bit
and shake hands, and I  shuffle out of the room, out of her life, elated and
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>Another relationship we just couldn't handle.
