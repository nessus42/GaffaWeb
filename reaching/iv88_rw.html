March 11th 88 
</P>
<P>The piece on Kate was quite small and the Radio Times copywriters had 
obviously seized on it as a selling point. Anyway, here's my review (!) of the 
programme. 
</P>
<P> Rhythms of the World - BBC2 8.10pm 11/3/88 
</P>
<P>The Music of Bulgaria 
</P>
<P> This programme in the series Rhythms of the World looked at a number of 
Bulgarian musicians/singers. The commentary was provided by The Ranking Miss P 
and started by looking at the Stara region, and a female singer Yanka Ouchinkova
 performing an open-air rendition of a song called &quot;Go Harvest Bride&quot;.
Next was the  Bulgarian National Folk Ensemble singing &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;,
followed by a gadulka  player (Volchev?) performing a folk dance. Then came the
section featuring Trio  Bulgarka. 
</P>
<P>Miss P: Rhythms of the World filmed Trio Bulgarka at work in the recording 
studio with singer-songwriter Kate Bush. We talked to them about this
collaboration  and asked them to perform some traditional Bulgarian songs. 
</P>
<P>Cut to the Trio Bulgarka performing &quot;Tregnalae Malika Moma&quot; in a
studio The  Trio are dressed in regional costumes. (This studio was presumably
the one off  Upper Street, Islington). Each of the Trio were then interviewed
(now dressed in  casual clothes) in turn and asked about their home region, its
costumes and songs.  Each member sang a short song to illustrate the typical
music of their region. 
</P>
<P>The programme then cut to a scene of Kate Bush and an engineer at a mixing 
desk (still the same studio from what I could make out). They were listening to
the  Trio adding vocal backing to a track. Yes, here it was ... a piece of KBVI!
The short  extract featured drums to the front of the mix, with guitar, sax and
fairlight also  distinguishable (about mid-tempo I would say - sorry I am
hopeless at describing  music). Yanka was singing (in Bulgarian naturally) with
Eva and Stoyanka providing  fill-in harmonies. Too short to say much more, but
definitely promising! The scene  then cuts to Kate (wearing the white pullover
shown in the NME photos), and  talking to an unseen male interviewer. 
</P>
<P>Kate: I first heard their music about three years ago when I was just
finishing the  last album, through my brother Paddy who has always been
interested in, in ethnic  music and collected instruments--since he was a kid
really. And he played me a tape  and I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. I
listened to it all the time and thought  how lovely it would be if perhaps on
the next album I'd be able somehow to work  with them; somehow incorporate their
music with my own. 
</P>
<P>So then we had to find out how to best approach it so as not just to use
them in  the music for the sake of it, but to make the most of what they do.
Because what  they do is so special. And, really through a process of
elimination we decided the  best thing to do was actually to go to Bulgaria and
to meet them and to work with  them there with their arranger and work out the
process there in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>So we went over there last weekend and we met for the first time. And we 
worked the whole weekend with their arranger Dimitar and Borimira translating, 
and between us as a group we actually pulled together all the work that we've
been  doing the last two days on the record. 
</P>
<P>Male: Can you tell me, if you're working in a studio with western musicians,
 normally there's ... there's a common language: go back to the middle eight,
cut,  take two, whatever. Do you find the process more difficult, trickier,
interesting,  when you actually have to go through ... everything through an
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>Kate: It takes longer maybe to actually communicate but in some ways it's
the  most exciting communication I've ever had with musicians because we can't 
communicate intellectually because we don't have the language. So we speak to 
each other emotionally really. We ... we sort of feel each other. That's what it
feels  like. 
</P>
<P> The programme cuts to Kate and Yanka (without her regional costume) arm in 
arm and recording a song, while Eva &quot;conducts&quot; Kate. 
</P>
<P>Kate [in voice over]: This is a traditional song that Yanka wanted me to
sing with  her. I just hold a drone underneath while Yanka solos. Eva's showing
me how to  come in with a ... 
</P>
<P> Here the tape seems to go haywire and there is an odd squeaking noise which
 was supposed to be an &quot;eeeyah&quot; kind of sound but came out as if the
edit had been  totally screwed up The song finishes with the &quot;eeeyah&quot;
sound, with Kate coming in  when Eva signals, and Kate and Yanka turn and smile
broadly at each other. The  next cut is to the Trio singing &quot;Dva Kornie&quot;
(in their regional costume again). (This  features some of those &quot;eeeyah&quot;
noises). This is followed by a cut back to the three  members of the Trio being
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>Eva: [translated] Music does not recognise the existence of two systems.
Music  travels around the world without a visa, without a passport. Music is
international.  The opportunity our Trio had to record with Kate Bush was very
important to us  and we consider it a great honour. I think that everything went
well. We coped well  with the variety of rhythms and our composer [sic. probably
arranger was the  correct translation] Dimitar Penev was a great help. I think
that Kate Bush was  satisfied with the work we did together. I think she chose
to work with Trio  Bulgarka because we are folk singers with strong musical
roots and able to meet any  musical challenge we are faced with. 
</P>
<P> Cut to the Trio singing &quot;Strati Angelaki&quot;. The rest of the
programme featured  the clarinet player Ivo Papasov. There was no evidence from
this programme that  Kate had recorded with the Trio at her own studio. Kate
mentions the work they  have been doing &quot;the last two days&quot; but does
not say whether it was at this studio or  her own. Certainly, the programme gave
the impression Kate was recording the Trio  at the Islington studio. However, it
is possible that her studio resembles the Islington  one sufficiently for me to
get confused (I will need to see the tape again). The KBVI  piece could have
been set up for the TV cameras but I think this is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>As for the piece of music itself, then, I would say that it definitely had a
feel of a  &quot;choir-synthesiser sound&quot; as described in the NME interview
(and so this suggests it  indeed was a piece of KBVI). Since the Trio were
definitely singing in Bulgarian on  this piece one must assume that it was their
choice rather than Kate's. There were  definitely &quot;lyrics&quot; not just
open-throat sounds. The overall feel of the rhythms was  however definitely
western and was not a westernised version of a Bulgarian tune. 
</P>
<P>Sorry I am such a complete flop at describing musical sounds. It sounded
good to  me anyway. 
</P>
<P>Regards. -- Neil
