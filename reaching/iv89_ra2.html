<P>Date: Fri, 27 Oct 89 17:05:19 BST <BR> From:
nbc%INF.RL.AC.UK@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Rapido Interview on BBC2 TV 14th
October 1989 
</P>
<P>This is a transcript of the item on the BBC 2 programme Rapido about Kate's 
album. The punctuation is mine, and is as accurate as I can make it given that
Kate  ums and ers a lot and does not always complete sentences. There is an
unseen female  announcer and Kate replying to unheard questions. 
</P>
<P>A. The Sensual World is Kate's first collection of new songs in four years.
Advance  reports of the album have already raised a few eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>K. I shouldn't have made the mistake of saying that I felt ... I felt that
this album  was my most personal and most female so far, and everyone has been
saying to  me &quot;What do you mean by female?&quot; And it's just a feeling
really, that ... it just  feels more an expression of myself as a woman this
time. 
</P>
<P>I. Much of the new LP was recorded at Kate's home studio in Kent but its
musical  contributors come from far and wide. They include French harpist Alan
Stivell  who obviously wasn't put off by Kate's tea-making . 
</P>
<P>&lt; shots of Kate making tea in best British transport cafe tradition&gt; 
</P>
<P>K. I've been a big fan of Alan's music for quite a while and I thought how
nice it  would be to get him to come in and play some harp and about two days
later this  letter turned up out of the blue ... and I'd never met the guy or
spoken to him or  anything, and it was a letter from Alan saying that he'd
really like to work with  me and he didn't know if I'd heard his music but ...
and it's like, you know,  within a space of two days we'd suddenly come into the
air ... and so that is how  we met and worked together. 
</P>
<P>I. Among the other guests on The Sensual World are Bulgarian singers the
Trio  Bulgarka and an old friend, Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd. 
</P>
<P>K. It was so good for me to come this full circle where, as you know, Dave
was very  involved in getting my initial signing to the record company and I'd
kinda written  this song and I knew I wanted the Bulgarian singers to be the
main body of the  song. And the idea is that at one point in the song the
character dresses up as a  rocket and jumps off this bridge, and it just felt so
right that Dave Gilmour should  be the rocket - you know, sort of ... off the
bridge. You know ... he's kind of the  guitar hero isn't he? 
</P>
<P>I. There was a time when Kate could turn out two albums in the same year and
then  go off on a major tour. Nowadays the excitement of an LP release is more
likely  to make her disappear for a few years. 
</P>
<P>K. I feel that it's important for me to retreat and to ... I don't see
myself as a  famous person, as a personality. It's really just me pushing my
work. You know, I  have to kinda promote my work, not me. So as soon as the work
has been  promoted then I can go back to doing the work and not promoting it. So
I tend  not to get involved in a lot of areas of the business and just sort of
stay quiet until  I've got another album out. &lt;laughs&gt; 
</P>
<P>I. Kate's debut some eleven years ago provoked an epidemic of weak knees
amongst  schoolboys and grown-men alike. Many have never recovered and in fact
seem to  get worse with each new Bush sighting. 
</P>
<P>K. Well, I think they must be completely mad. &lt; laughs &gt; It's
extraordinary. You  know, I find that even more extraordinary than the fact that
people are willing to  wait four years and then want to buy an album, and the
fact that people still even  bother to ask me if I'm going to tour, you know ...
I think you're all completely  mad ... &lt;laughs&gt; and thank you very much,
but ... &lt;laughs &gt;
