<P> What Katie did next 
</P>
<P>Tony Horkins delves deep into the private life of Kate Bush to discuss her
new  cut, The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>Sitting comfortably in the high tech surround of Abbey road studios, Kate
Bush,  that most English of English roses, is trying to define exactly what
English music  really is. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think lyrically there's a lot that defines English music, and I
suppose a certain  approach to sounds,&quot; she considers emotively. &quot;There
are very definite American  approaches to sound - guitar sounds, approaches to
songs, the Fender Rhodes; as  soon as you hear that it's America. But to
actually define African, or American.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Which may go some way to explain why her new album, The Sensual World, is so
 mixed in its influences and so far removed from anything we may immediately 
consider to be English. A swirling mass of eastern European rhythms, Bulgarian 
singing, Irish fiddling and that unique vocal and lyrical quality that belongs
to Kate  Bush. But then Kate Bush isn't the type to be influenced by day time
radio; not for  her hours spent tuned in to the inane ramblings of Gary Davies
and co. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't spend much time listening to radio, and when I do it tends to
be Radio 4.  I guess we spend so much time listening to music in a very
sensitised way, in  recreational terms, that you need relief for the ears. I
tend to listen to more when I  just finish an album, rather than during, which
is stupid. 
</P>
<P>&quot;A good example of this is that when I finished the last album, I heard
this  Bulgarian music. (Les Voix de Bulgare, the extraordinary close-harmony
choir whose  two Les Mystere albums were surprise hits for 4AD). I thought
'Shit, I wish I'd  have heard this while I was working on the album.' I think it
was good in one way  because I had a lot of time to think about the possibility
of doing something with  them. The thing that would worry me a bit is that if
you like something you are  influenced by it, and I'd probably try and connect
to other people's music of that  time. it takes me such a long time to make an
album that it would be drastically out  of date.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This is, perhaps, something of an underestimate. It's been nearly four years
since  we had the opportunity to discuss her then current album, Hounds of Love.
Surely  she hasn't been working on The Sensual World since then? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was saying to Del (Palmer - boyfriend/ bass player/ programmer/
mixer) that  I think my tapes wouldn't know what to do if they weren't left
sitting around for  years. I think they'd have a nervous breakdown - they go
through a fermenting  process. Like wine, or something. I don't do anything to
the songs, I just sit and let  the tapes mature. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think in real terms it's been about two and a half years, and it's
been done in  bits. We started and then took quite a few months off to do a few
things at home,  and also it was the only way I could cope with this album - to
keep taking breaks.  It's quite an intense process - especially Del and I
working together so isolated. We  had to take a lot of breaks to think about
stuff. A lot of time with this album was  spent thinking. Not actually doing,
but just thinking.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Home is where the Art is 
</P>
<P>As with Hounds of Love, The Sensual World was recorded mainly in Kate's 
home studio, with orchestral parts added at Abbey Road, Irish extras in Windmill
 Lane, Dublin, and the Bulgarian women recorded at Angel studios. The result is
as  diverse as it is interesting, and on first listening much more complex than
her other  albums. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Some of them are really bizarre - I worry about my sanity sometimes,
really. All  of the tracks have taken such completely different processes.&quot;

</P>
<P>Including the opening track, also the first single, which didn't quite end
up as  Kate imagined it initially would. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Now that was a really complicated process for a track to come
together. It  started off with a song - no words. I'd had this idea for about
two years to use the  words from Molly Blooms' speech at the end of Ulysses,
which I think is the most  superb piece of writing ever, to a piece of music. So
Del had done a Fairlight pattern,  and I'd done a DX riff over the top of it,
and I was listening to it at home, and the  words fitted absolutely perfectly. I
thought God this is just ridiculous, just how well  it's come together. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We then approached the relevant people for permission to use the
lyrics, and  they just would not let me use them. No way. I tried everything. So
I thought if  we're really getting nowhere with this, let's take a different
approach to the song. I  heard this piece of music which a fan sent in about two
years earlier, and we put the  tune in the choruses in place of what we had. So
that went in, and all the lyrics I  had to change. 
</P>
<P>&quot;To try and keep the sense of the original words, but something that
would be  original, I came up with this idea of Molly Bloom stepping out of this
speech into the  real world. And in the book she's such a sensual woman -
womanly, very physical, it  just seemed that she would be completely taken by
the fact that this 2D character  could actually go around touching. So that's
what it turned into. The fact that they  didn't let me use the lyrics turned the
song into something very different. It was  such a complicated process, and
really quite painful to actually let it go.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Fairlight still plays a large part in the music making process for Kate,
even  though many others may have abandoned it for more contemporary, and
cheaper  sampling sources. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's a very good instrument still. It's just one of those
things. Everyone I  know is the same; we pull out the Fairlight and they go, 'Oh
no sounds rubbish.  Eventually you do find sounds that really work. I think the
whole process of  sampling instruments is becoming very boring, wading through
sounds.. 
</P>
<P>And she further proves her reluctance to purchase This Year's Model by
raving  about a recently acquired DX7. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was very impressed. Initially I thought I'd just use it for ideas,
but we've used  it quite a lot on the album. We blend it in with other stuff,
and hopefully it doesn't  sound too like a DX7. I use mainly pre-sets. I think
it's amazing how different you  can make pre-sets sound if you treat them
differently and bung another sound with  them. It takes on quite a different
character.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One of the first tracks she wrote for the album was Love and Anger. Again,
the  track didn't exactly write itself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't get the lyrics. They were one of the last things to do. I
just couldn't  find out what the song was about, though the tune was there. The
first verse was  always there, and that was the problem, because I'd already set
some form of  direction, but I couldn't follow through. I didn't know what I
wanted to say at all. I  guess I was just tying to make a song that was
comforting, up tempo, and about how  when things get really bad, it's alright
really - 'Don't worry old bean. Someone will  come and help you out.' 
</P>
<P>&quot;The song started with a piano, and Del put a straight rhythm down.
Then we got  the drummer, and it stayed like that for at least a year and a
half. Then I thought  maybe it could be okay, so we got Dave Gilmour in. This is
actually one of the more  difficult songs - everyone I asked to try and play
something on this track had  problems. It was one of those awful tracks where
either everything would sound  ordinary, really MOR, or people just couldn't
come to terms with it. They'd ask me  what it was about, but I didn't know
because I hadn't written the lyrics. Dave was  great - I think he gave me a bit
of a foothold there, really. At least there was a  guitar that made some sense.
And John (Giblin) putting the bass on - that was very  important. He was one of
the few people brave enough to say that he actually liked  the song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you give your musicians quite a free hand? 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I don't know what's happening, yes. But that song was just so
bizarre. In  some ways it's a very ordinary structure compared to the other
songs. I think  putting the Valiha on was very important. It's a beautiful
sounding instrument - it  looks a bit like a Zither, and it's from Madagascar.
It sounds like sunshine - it has  this really happy, bubbly sound. I think that
really helped to give the song a different  perspective. It's a very
straightforward treatment - drums, bass, guitar, piano - and I  think for me
it's one of the more straightforward songs on the album. A chirpy little 
number.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Misty Business 
</P>
<P>The next track, The Fog, finds Kate once again exploring atmosphere and 
emotion through music; like a lot of her material, the motivations and
expressions  behind the lyric and the way the track is recorded are inseparable.
One very clearly  dictates the other. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That started at the Fairlight. We got these big chords of strings, and
put this line  over the top, and then I got this idea of these words - slipping
into the fog. I thought  wouldn't it be interesting to sort of really visualize
that in a piece of music, with all  these strings coming in that would actually
be the fog. So I wrote a bit of music that  went on the front of what I'd done,
and extended it backwards with this bit on the  front that was very simple and
straightforward, but then went into the big orchestral  bit, to get the sense of
fog coming in. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Then we put a drummer on, and Nigel Kennedy, the violinist, came in
and  replaced the Fairlight violin, which changed the nature of it. He's great
to work  with - such a great musician. The times we work together we sort of
write together.  I'll say something like, 'what about doing something a bit like
Vaughan Williams?',  and he'll know the whole repertoire, and he'll pick
something, and maybe I'll  change something. By doing that we came up with this
different musical section that  hadn't been on the Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>&quot;So when I got all this down it seemed to make sense story-wise. This
new  section became like a flashback area. And then I got the lyrics together
about  slipping into the fog, and relationships, trying to let go of people. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It sounded great with the Fairlight holding it together, but it just
didn't have the  sense of dimension I wanted. So we got hold of Michael Kamen,
who orchestrated  some of the last album, and we said we wanted this bit here
with waves and  flashbacks. He's really into this because he's always writing
music for films, and he  loves the idea of visual imagery. So we put his
orchestra in on top of the Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Again a very complicated process, and he was actually the last thing
to go on. I  don't know how anything comes out as one song, because sometimes
it's such a  bizarre process. It does seem to work together somehow.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Stepping Out 
</P>
<P>However, some come quicker than others, like track four, one of my personal 
favourites, Reaching Out. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That was really quick, really straightforward. A walk in the park did
that one  for me. I really needed one more song to kind of lift the album. I was
a bit worried  that it was all sort of dark and down. I'd been getting into
walks at that time, and  just came back and sat at the piano and wrote it, words
and all. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I had this lovely conversation with someone around the time I was
about to start  writing it. They were talking about this star that exploded. I
thought it was such  fantastic imagery. The song was taking the whole idea of
how we cling onto things  that change - we're always trying to not let things
change. I thought it was such a  lovely image of people reaching up for a star,
and this star explodes. Where's it  gone? It seemed to sum it all up really. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We did a really straightforward treatment on the track; did the piano
to a  clicktrack, got Charlie Morgan (Elton John's drummer) to come in and do
the  drums, Del did the bass, and Michael Nyman came in to do the strings. I
told him it  had to have a sense of uplifting, and I really like his stuff - the
rawness of his strings.  It's a bit like a fuzzbox touch - quite 'punk'. I find
that very attractive - he wrote  it very quickly. I was very pleased.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's always used a wide variety of musicians on her records, but drummer 
Stuart Elliot seems to have been there from the beginning, even though he 
sometimes shares the drum stool with Charlie Morgan. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He's the only one that's worked on every album - he's lovely to work
with. I  think it's good to keep that long term relationship. He's so easy to
work with  because he knows what I'm like. Occasionally I even ask him to use
cymbals on a  track now! He's been through that whole stage where I just
couldn't handle  cymbals or hi hats. Now that I'm actually using them again he
can't cope. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I always found them something that we used too much. I felt they were
leant on  too much. It held the music down in such a specific way. They're very
marked. Not  using them is just a way of opening up the music, I think. I learnt
a lot from it. It's  always been, 'this is the drum kit, so let's use it.' I
always found that extraordinary.  But I think now that I've taken that break
from it, I see it very differently.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Even though both Stuart and Charlie get to contribute on most tracks, The 
Sensual World features more programmed drums than earlier recordings. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We replace a lot, but there's a lot that's still there. We used the
Fairlight for the  drums this time, and because the quality was so much better
we could keep them  all. It's just the last album, with the Linn patterns, they
had to be much more  disguised because they sounded like a Linn machine. We had
much more finished  drum tracks to work with - that caused some problems. They
were so good that I  didn't want to get in and replace them at an early stage
like on the last album. I had  to be quite brutal and get drummers to just get
in there and throw bits of the  Fairlight away, just to give it different
levels. On the next track, Heads We're  Dancing, it was all based around the
Fairlight pattern that Del did, which is the basis  of the whole song. The only
thing I think we replaced was the snare.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why bother? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Because I think it gives it a human feel, even though he's got to stay
in with the  machine. There's still a certain amount of movement, and there's
all this human  energy. I even believe that the sounds a drummer makes can be
part of the track -  they all make sounds, sing along while they're playing,
grunting ... It puts air in  there. It's nice to get someone else's input as
well. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I like to use real musicians - it's so exciting. Machines are great
but you can get  such great feedback from people when they think they're working
on something  intimate. Things you'd never think of. Like Mick Karns' bass on
Heads We're  Dancing puts such a different feel to the song. I was really
impressed with Mick -his  energy. He's very distinctive - so many people admire
him because he stays in that  unorthodox area, he doesn't come into the
commercial world - he just does his  thing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Not a totally different position to her own. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose so, but I take an awfully long time to do it. What I admire
about  people like Mick is the way they travel from one environment to the
other, but keep  themselves intact. For me, I'm so used to being in my own
studio now, that if I'm  put in another one I actually get so nervous. I suppose
it's finding a balance. When I  did work in commercial studios all that time, I
did find it very uncomfortable,  because there was so much pressure, and so many
distractions. I love working at  home so much - though it does leave me quite
vulnerable when I go outside.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sentiments which must have inspired the next track, Deeper Understanding. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's about someone being trapped in the city, in isolation at work,
where they  just spend all the time with this computer, actually really
developing a relationship  with it. Which a lot of people seem to do - they talk
to it. So the idea is in sending  off this programme for the lonely lost; they
put it in and this sci-fi being comes out  and says 'I know you're lost, but I'm
here to help you, we love you.' This person  doesn't have human contact any
more, he's just kind of addicted to the machine. I  suppose in subject matter
terms I really do see it visually. 
</P>
<P>&quot;So I had this thing and started to write it on the Yamaha piano at
home - one of  the old CP90s, which is still great. I asked Del for a rhythm,
and he put down this  very mechanical rhythm on Fairlight. I put DX7 over the
top, John Giblin did the  most beautiful bass - though it took a while. It
always does when I work with John -  the main problem is that he just makes me
laugh so much.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding is also the first track to feature the Trio Bulgarka. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That song was sort of finished when I got involved with the Bulgarian
singers. I  just thought of all the people to represent a being that exudes
divine love, it had to  be the Bulgarian singers. The idea was to put them in
the chorus where the  computer was singing, so that they'd have this ethereal
sound.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Track seven, Between A Man And A Woman, gets a simpler treatment. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That was, let's get a groove going at the piano, and a pretty
straightforward  Fairlight pattern. Then we got the drummer in, and I thought
that maybe it was  taking on a slightly Sixties feel - not that it is. So we got
Alan (Murphy, Level 42  guitarist) in to play guitar - who unfortunately wasn't
credited - a printing error.  He played some smashing guitar. Then I wanted to
work with the cellist again,  because I think the cello is such a beautiful
instrument. I find it very male and  female - not one or the other. He's
actually the only player that I've ever written  out music for. They're lucky if
they get chord charts normally. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We were just playing around with a groove. We actually had a second
verse that  was similar to the first, and I thought it was really boring. I
hated it, so it sat around  for about six months. So I took it into a completely
different section which worked  much better. Just having that little bit on the
front worked much better. Quite often  I have to put things aside and think
about them if they just haven't worked. If you  leave a little time, it's
surprising how often you can come back and turn it into  something.&quot; 
</P>
<P> The Write Stuff 
</P>
<P>Inevitably, some of them are set aside for good. 
</P>
<P>&quot;On this album I probably wrote more than I have in ages, but some of
them  really weren't up to much. They needed so much work to get them into
shape. It's  just not worth the effort. And you tire of it really quickly. You
hear it three or four  times and think it's so boring. I think something's got
to have a personality, almost.  It doesn't take much. Maybe just a little bit
that you think works, and then you  develop the whole thing from there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One track that made it for further developing was Never Be Mine. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wanted a sort of eastern sounding rhythm. I wrote it first on the
piano, though  the words were completely different, except for the choruses. I
did it on the piano to  a Fairlight rhythm that Del programmed - I think that
maybe because of the quality  of the sounds, it was harder for Del to come up
with the patterns. And I was more  strict - he found it much harder. I think the
pattern in Heads We're Dancing is  really good - really unusual, the best he
came up with. But Never Be Mine was kind  of tabla based. We got Eberhard
(Weber) over to play bass and he played on the  whole song. When we were trying
to piece it together later we kept saying it just  doesn't feel right, so we
just took the bass out and had it in these two sections. You  hardly notice it
going out at all. I think the song has a very light feel about it, which  helps
the whole imagery. The Uilean pipes have a very light feel, and the piano is 
light .. I think it's a nice contrast when the bass suddenly come in. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The piano on this is an upright Bernstein that has a really nice sound
- I think it  has to do with proportions for us. We did have a big piano and
it's a small room, and  it didn't record well. The small piano sounds much
bigger.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How do you decide if a track's going to feature acoustic or electric piano? 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I write the song on piano in the studio, chances are that's how it
will be. If I  write at home on the electric piano, or the synth, it's probably
going to be a synth  track. I was getting worried at one point that so many of
the songs are all based  around the piano. On Hounds of Love I got away from
that, and most of the songs  are based around the Fairlight, which gave them
different flavours. 
</P>
<P>Having used the Bulgarian singers to slot into existing tracks on the album,
with  Rocket's Tail she wrote the song specifically for them. 
</P>
<P> A Rocket's Tale 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was a vehicle to get their voices on a track in as dominant a way
as possible.  So I put this down with a DX7 choir sound so it had this kind of
vocal feel. Then we  got a drummer in and got this big Rock 'n' Roll thing
going. Then I got some  friends in to hear what it would sound like with big
block vocals singing behind my  voice, and although they were English people
that sing completely differently, it still  gave me a sense of vocal intensity.
So these two friends must have spent all day  trying to sing like Bulgarians.
But it was so useful, because there were so many  things I immediately
understood we couldn't do, and lots of things it felt like we  could do. 
</P>
<P>&quot;So we took it to Bulgaria and started working with this arranger. I
told him  what I wanted, and he just went off and said 'what about this?' and
they were  great. He kept giving me all these things to choose from, and we
worked so well  together. It was so good that we decided to hold the drum kit -
it was originally  starting much earlier in the song. Then we let Dave Gilmour
rip on it, so we'd have  this really extreme change from just vocals to this
hopefully big Rock 'n' Roll kit,  with bass, and guitar solos.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The last track on the album, though not on the CD and cassette, is This
Woman's  Work, which again started life on the piano. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That was a really easy song to put together; all that was added to the
piano was a  bit of Fairlight, a bit of backing vocals, and a tiny amount of
orchestra - about four or  five bars. But the difference it makes is
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That song's really all to do with John Hughes, the American film
director,  who'd just made this film called She's Having A Baby. He wanted a
song for this  scene in the hospital that's very powerful where the father is
expecting to go in  there with her, and the nurse comes out and says the baby's
in a breach position.  He's sitting in the waiting room, thinking about their
relationship, and I think it's at  the point where he actually grows up. He's
sitting there and he's not a little boy any  more -he's got this big
responsibility. You can see he's sitting there thinking of all  these great
times they've had together, and that possibly she could die with the  baby. I
wrote the song to the film - one of the quickest things I've written. The 
imagery was so strong. I really enjoyed being asked to do it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think this is the big problem with song-writing - it's this blank
page. You can  start anywhere. There's too much to choose from, and I think
technology in studios  is doing the same to people. There's so much to choose
from, so much information,  that you're not working within restrictions that
actually help you to form a  direction. I'm sure that for me, doing this, it was
quick and easy because the song  had to be about that. It couldn't be about
anything else. I think that helps  tremendously.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Extra-Ordinary 
</P>
<P>CD and cassette buyers get one extra track for their money, Walk Straight
Down  The Middle. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That song was definitely the quickest I've ever recorded anything.
We'd given  ourselves a specific day to cut it, so I had to do it fast. The
backing track I'd  originally recorded ages ago. At the time I wasn't happy with
the lyrics, and I felt  the song needed more developing. When we came back to
hear it again, both Del  and myself were really impressed with the sounds and
how together the song  sounded; previously we thought it had been rubbish. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wrote the lyrics, recorded the vocals, backing vocals and synth
overdubs in one  day, which is totally unheard of for me. The next day we did
some more overdubs,  and then mixed. I'm glad it was tagged on. We made the gap
longer, so that you  could get a sense that the album was finished, it sounds
okay, but I don't think it  holds the same depths that the other tracks do.&quot;

</P>
<P>How did it feel without the hours of agonising? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Terrible. I couldn't cope. I couldn't sit and anguish over my lyrics.
It was very  difficult. But I think it's all right, some nice sounds, nothing
special. The whole thing  is just an album, that's what I keep telling myself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Just an album.&quot;

<P>&quot;We now have an SSL. It's an expensive board, but not the most
expensive, and  it's very versatile. It has a good sound, and all those
facilities. For the money the  Soundcraft was great, but the SSL is much more
efficient to work with. On the last  album we spent a lot of time working around
the desk, and on this one it was just  working around me.&quot;&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;We're still using two A80s - we work on 48-track all the time, though
it drives  people crazy. When you get outside people in, you can see their
impatience with the  machines. We use them with the Lynx, though we used to have
a Q-Lok. I'm not  sure there's that much in it, but I think the Lynx is a bit
quicker. It would be even  better if we had 800s. The A80s seem a bit archaic
now. 
</P>
<P>&quot;With outboard, I love the Quantec. It has a crystalline quality to it,
very  distinctive. I use it on instruments sometimes, but particularly vocals.
We've got two  Lexicons - the 224 and the 224X. We hire stuff in when we mix
-outboard eqs, like a  couple of old Pultecs, they have a really warm sound
-warmer than the SSL eq. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We master analogue half inch. A lot of noise, but I still prefer
working analogue.  At this point we've found it wise not to change machines
mid-stream. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Monitoring is on AR18s, and we did get some Gold Spot Tannoys, they're
quite  useful for some things, though generally we stick to the 18s, and
Auratones. We  don't use big speakers. We had some but they sounded awful. 
</P>
<P>&quot;As we have a Fairlight, it tends to negate us getting in other
sampling gear.  We're pretty well covered with the Fairlight and the DX7 for
keyboards, and the  quality of the Fairlight is much better, though so difficult
to use. Everyone says that.  I used to programme it myself, but since the new
software ... I can't keep up. They  keep changing it as soon as I learn to
programme it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes we're happier just flying in the half-inch, the old
fashioned  technique. There's something about it - I quite like the purist
approach. Like tape  delay - you can't get that same sound. It doesn't have the
same presence, it has a  whispy quality. With tape delay it's lovely. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I guess I'm just a sucker for analogue sounds.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate and the Bulgarians 
</P>
<P>&quot;They work so hard!&quot; says Kate: &quot;When we went out there we
worked from nine  in the morning to 11 at night. They'll sing all day and always
stand in the same order;  you'd think that the soloist would stand in the
middle, but she stands at one end.  They run Yanka, Eva, Stoyanka - and it
spells 'yes' ...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;... We didn't mike them individually. We took advice from Joe Boyd,
who's  worked with them, and he suggested a single ambient mike ... It's
incredible the  quality when the three of them are singing - you can almost hear
the air cracking.  The harmonic distortion is so exciting. One of the songs they
do I just cry - there's  very little music that hits me deeply enough to make me
cry.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Dorka Hristova is conductor of the Women's Choir of the Bulgaria
Broadcasting  Service, conducting some of the most beautiful female voices in
the world -  including The Trio Bulgarka: 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's quite different from Bel Canto singing in the West. It is
straight and natural.  Very direct with great tension. The sound comes from the
epiglottis, with the  resonance mainly here in the breast and not in the
forehead. That is why the  women in our choir are ... not fatter, but have
fuller breasts!&quot; 
</P>
<P>But it isn't just the style of singing that makes the music so unusual: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, the harmonies are different. Bulgarian Folk is characterised
with one voice  singing, then two voices - Diatonic - and sometimes, three
voices singing, Triaphonic.  Diaphony is typical for the Sophia region. One is a
drone and the other voice makes  the melody. These are at second intervals and
include quarter notes as well as  semitones. Western harmonies are based on 3rds
... This type of singing cannot be  taught in the colleges; it comes from inside
the person. So, it is a kind of mystery to  us as well.&quot;

<P>That completes the International Musician article folks. There is a rather
washed  out photo of Kate on the front cover wearing a black hat, and a colour
photo of Kate  with the sand in her hands from TSW promotion.
