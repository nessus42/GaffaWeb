<P><STRONG>And now -- shudder heights?</STRONG></P>
<P>By PAUL DONOVAN</P>
<P>THE wailing voice and haunting looks of Kate Bush  have already sold a
million records. So what's the next  step for the 20-year-old doctor's daughter
who this  week is playing to sell-out audiences at the London  Palladlum? If the
movie makers get their way, they'll  turn her into a sexy vampire and bring
shuddering frights  from the girl who rose to fame with her number one  smash
hit &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; </P>
<P>Elfin-faced Kate revealed yesterday : 'I've had two  scripts offered to me
recently. Both were horror films.</P>
<P>&quot;But I wouldn't have thought I was a vampire.  And I don't consider
myself an actress, anyway.&quot;</P>
<P>Kate, who dances sinuously on stage to a background of  conjurers, smoke and
back-projected films, was asked  about the other role in which she has been
cast...a vamp. </P>
<P>&quot;I was very rebellious when the Press first gave me  the label of a sex
symbol,&quot; she said. </P>
<P>&quot;But it s an incredible compliment for a female to  get, so long as it
doesn't stand in the way of the music.&quot;</P>
