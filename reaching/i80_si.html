<P>From Sound International, September 1980
</P>
<P> [Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to Tracy Robin for the interview]
</P>
<P>The Kate Gallery 
</P>
<P>How Kate Bush outgrew being seen as &quot;this strange creature&quot; being
manipulated  by this huge record company' and began to gain a little respect as
a  singer/writer/producer. Words and pix: Ralph Denyer.
</P>
<P>While I listened to an understandably much guarded advance cassette copy of 
Kate Bush's third and new Never Forever album she was completing her other 
interview in another room close by. That over, she came into the room I was in
to  use a phone and we introduced ourselves to each other. She's quite small and
 somewhere in between pretty and beautiful. Her manner is very friendly with
none  of the tough facade that most successful music business people develop
through  time. Loads of smiles and an offer to help me to the next room with my
cases of  equipment follow. On the way through she laughs when I tell her it's
nice to have a  roadie for a change.
</P>
<P> She had just completed her new album. She has taken car of all the piano
playing  on the record, as usual, as well as playing a bit of synth. One big
change on her new  album is that the orchestral backdrops have gone. Replacing
them are some of the  best specialist keyboard players around. Mr. Funk, Max
Middleton, plays Fender  Rhodes, Larry Fast defies gravity. Andy Mackay, Richard
Burgess, and John Walters  make use of Landscape's Fairlight CMI system to
provide what Kate describes as  'Musical animation'.
</P>
<P> At 21 she has just reached the point where she has complete control over
her  own music. She has achieved this by taking over the artistic side of her
record  production, choosing to work closely with John Kelly. He engineered
Kate's  previous two album, The Kick Inside and Lionheart. For the new album he 
continued in that role but also took car of the technical aspects of recording
which  would normally be the producer's province. But more of that later.
</P>
<P> I asked about the day-to-day decision making and what role her family play.
 &quot;I've got two brothers (Andrew alias Paddy and John alias J) and they're
both very  important. My family are very close and I think there are very few
family  establishments left, generally speaking, that are close. It's become
very much an  individual society. We all love each other very much, we all love
much and we've all  grown up together. Even my parents, they grow up all the
time too. When things  started happening for me in so many ways, they were
happening to the family as  well because we are so close. As things were going,
the most important thing  seemed to be that I had control. Because one of the
worst things that can happen to  one's product - that terrible word - is that
you become manipulated, as I've seen  written about me in so many papers. They
think you're a little doll who's being  manipulated.
</P>
<P> &quot;The public, not because of being ignorant but because of propaganda,
have such  strange ideas about what happens in various businesses. The only one
that I get to  see and be amazed by is this particular business because I am in
it. The things that  some people think you can do are wonderful, they really
have no idea.&quot;
</P>
<P> The Bush family are all musical and Kate's mother has been a dancer. Their 
keen interest in - if not addition to - traditional Irish music and dance meant
that  Kate was exposed to music from quite an early age and was soon hooked
herself.  While still at school she had violin lessons and then moved on to
piano. When her  career started to take off, not surprisingly the whole family
took an interest.  Professional help was enlisted in the form of an accountant
and a solicitor. At the  appropriate moment a company was set up. &quot;Really
though [though?] all the things  that keep happening, different roles keep
coming up. My brother J has now taken  over a great deal of the business
operation.&quot;
</P>
<P> They have now set up a fan club near Kate's parent's home in Kent. Many 
would consider this to be a relatively unimportant facet, but Kate has positive
ideas  on how the club should be run and does not intend to allow it to become
the usual  catastrophic mess such organizations usually degenerate into. &quot;Yes,
well that is what  we didn't want. One of my best friends is taking care of
that. I think that it is only  right that you should try and get control over as
many areas and make sure that  people get something nice and making sure they
get something which is accurate.  The further you get away from the public the
more misinterpreted... the more  wrong information becomes.
</P>
<P> &quot;We decided that I didn't need a manager because the main reasons for
having  a manager are for him to give musical direction, ways in, you know, all
the things  that an unbroken act needs. But in my situation I'd already had &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot; without a manager, we'd already released the album (The Kick
Inside)  without a manager. And although everyone kept telling us that I needed
one, we  couldn't see it at all!&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;I thought: Good, because I want to make my own decisions and it's my
life. It  can be very dangerous when you are not in a position to make your own
decisions  and therefore you can be doing things that you never intended.
Practically selling  your soul, which should never happen. So we went along
those lines and it has been  taking all this time to build things up into an
organization of our own and it will  continue to build, companies are always
growing and organising themselves.&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;And I think we've done remarkably well. Hilary Walker is my PA and
apart  from the solicitors and accountants it's just me and my family. So all
the information  that comes in is passed on. The stuff that they know I won't
want to do they say no  to. Stuff that I see I say yes or no to. And it's really
wonderful to have that sort of  control and not have people doing things behind
your back, which inevitably happens  with managers. They establish contact here
and there for their own good and not  necessarily for the artists. I'm not
slagging of all managers because there are some  good exceptions, and there are
some very, very, good ones. But you know the sort of  thing I'm talking about,
it's just wicked, the things they do to young bands.&quot;
</P>
<P> There is a surprising amount of variation between the different media
accounts  of Kate's beginnings in the 'biz' so I shall endeavor to set the
record straight. First  attempts to get a reaction from record companies were
made by a friend of Kate's  armed with n early demo of some of her songs. He met
a blanket of rejection until  1975 when he played the tapes to an old friend
from Cambridge by the name of Dave  Gilmour. The Floydian guitarist reinforced
his reputation for giving help to new acts  by advising Kate to cut finished
masters of her best three songs for presentation to  companies. The tapes are
often referred to as &quot;demos&quot; but after exhaustive research  (I read
the sleeve notes on The Kick Inside) I can reveal that he Gilmour financed 
recordings provided two of the tracks which were to appear on Kate's first album
 some two years later. They were &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;
and &quot;The  Saxophone Song&quot;. I asked Kate about all this as the album
has a continuity that  makes the two-year &quot;gap&quot; surprising.
</P>
<P> &quot;Yes, they do fit very well on that album, don't they? Maybe there's a
few  reasons for that. But the thing that I notice is the difference in my
voice, that's the  only thing that gives it away for me. They probably fit well
because Andrew (Powell)  was the arranger on all the tracks. I wonder how many
people would notice that  because no-one comment on hearing any difference,
you're the first person to  mention that. No-one's commented on that before so
it's very interesting.&quot;
</P>
<P> When Gilmour took Kate into Air Studios to record &quot;The Man With The
Child  In His Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Saxophone Song&quot; she was 16. When
Gilmour played the tapes  to an EMI executive they wanted Kate. EMI treated her
well from the word go,  though the media (true to form) stereotyped the
situation with a standard: Big  company manipulates and exploits the young
innocent etc, etc.
</P>
<P> The company did not rush Kate into completing an album although she has
some  100 songs already written. Instead they advised her to get a lawyer, an
accountant,  and advanced her L3,000. Around that time an aunt of Kate's died
and left her some  money. Finding herself able to forget about immediate
monetary problems she went  about developing various aspects of her abilities.
Lindsay Kemp had an ad in Time  Out offering his services as a teacher of mime
and dance. Kate responded and she  was soon receiving group instruction for 50p
a day from the magister artis. She was  fascinated by singing in a high register
and worked on singer higher and higher  notes. She wrote more songs.
</P>
<P> It was two years exactly before she returned to Air Studios to record the
rest of  the material for her debut album The Kick Inside. Virtually the last
song she wrote  for the album was &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; - &quot;The Man
With The Child In His Eyes&quot;,  for example, had been written some five years
earlier. Apart from the general  supportive role her family plays, they make
individual specific contributions to her  music and business affairs. As well as
taking care of business, J also photographs  Kate. His shots can be seen on the
&quot;Babooshka&quot; sleeve as well as on the back of her  new album. Paddy has
played mandolin, guitar, mandocello, panpipes, and sung  back-up on her albums.
Kate says that her father remains a doctor first and  foremost but ... &quot;mulls
over anything with negative and legal aspects.&quot;
</P>
<P> She undoubtedly is a very together person. My impression is that she does
use  her family as a sounding board and frequently takes their advice. On the
other hand  I think she frequently listens carefully to their advice before she
goes on to do  exactly what her instincts had told her in the first place! There
again, she does not  display any of the signs of an ego which forces her to do
thing her way for the sake  of it. Her satisfaction comes from being good at
what she does. Obviously the fact  that she produced her new album - albeit with
the technicalities handled by John  Kelly - is the major point of interest.
Before talking her about that I asked about her  relationship with Andrew Powell
who produced her first two albums.
</P>
<P> &quot;Dave knew Andrew. I don't know how, and he thought Andrew was a very 
competent arranger and would be quite capable of taking care of the production 
side. So we went into Air Studios, I was about 15 or 16 at the time.&quot;
</P>
<P> Was she terrified? &quot;Yes, I was very nervous. It's a big studio. Andrew
was  fantastic. He was completely in control of it. I was just a schoolgirl
doing my exams at  the time and reeled at the prospect of someone just working
on my songs. The  musicians did their own thing and Andrew wrote some beautiful
strings. We  managed to get it to EMI and they leapt at it. Then there was the
situation obviously  where I was only 16, totally naive to the business and
everything and EMI were  wondering what to do with me.
</P>
<P> &quot;They could either send me out into the world with the songs I had - a
16-year  old - or hang on. I was more then happy to hang on because I didn't
feel that I was  ready. Although I was waiting to make an album for at any
minute, after about six  months I realised that it was a long-term project so I
stated getting on with my own  things. I decided to leave school and go fully
into the business. Then I got a little  group and we played around in pubs.
After that came the album. And Andrew, of  course, because he had done so well
on the earlier tracks, was the first guy we  thought of.
</P>
<P> &quot;As soon as I started the first album, already three years had passed
from the  demos (sic) to the album and I obviously gathered a lot more self
confidence. I was  beginning to understand what I wanted in my music. The songs
were obviously  maturing and I was getting around and understanding the business
more. Andrew  did a fabulous job on the album, he really did. Even at that stage
I could feel that  there were areas where he was taking the music that perhaps
if I had been in  control, I wouldn't. That's understandable. He was the
producer and therefore - he  was very good and always listened to what I wanted
- he would obviously plant his  feelings there. 
</P>
<P>Kate helped out with some vocals on Peter Gabriel's recently acclaimed album
 and I presume it was through Peter that she met Larry Fast. &quot;We managed to
get  Larry before he flew off and he's a fantastic guy, wow. He's wonderful. He 
finished off &quot;Breathing&quot; for us. We got to the point where there was a
deadline  coming up for the release of the song as a single. So far up to then
we'd been  working on the tracks quite generously. When we had a guitar overdub
to do we'd  do all the guitar tracks for the album as you logically would. As we
had a deadline  for &quot;Breathing&quot; we put aside all the other tracks and
worked on the one song until it  was complete. Larry came in for a day and he
was wonderful. We were all gathering  such and intense vibe working on the one
very nuclear song. We'd been working  on it until about five or six in the
morning each day for about a week. It was very  intense in the studio and very
nuclear. It felt just like a fallout shelter.&quot;
</P>
<P> For those unfamiliar with Studio Two at Abbey Road it is a huge studio with
a  high ceiling. The control room looks down from a top corner giving a false 
impression of being underground. Also the decor is basic and deliberately 
unchanged since the days when the studio's prime users were the Beatles. &quot;Larry
 came in in the middle of all this nuclear intensity and he was wonderful, &quot;
said Kate.  &quot;He's put on some incredibly right animation sounds. You see, I
think of synth  players like that. It's probably wrong because I'm thinking just
in terms of my  music. I see them as such an animation thing, they seem to
complete the picture so  beautifully. It's like they put on the colour on the
track sometimes.
</P>
<P> &quot;So Larry was there for a whole day just working on the one track and
built up  some beautiful stuff, just sort of underneath the back of the
arrangement. It was  such a pleasure to work with him because I've always wanted
to but he's such a  busy many. I really hope I can work with him again. His
standards are ridiculous, I  mean he works to the clock. He'd say: 'Gosh, that
took me 10 minutes and it's only  supposed to take two!' and gets really upset.
He's such a professional and he works  so hard, I think a lot of people can
learn from him&quot; (see interview, SI March '80).
</P>
<P> Kate wanted to put together the promo film for &quot;Breathing&quot; - and
did. It became  a visual presentation of the subject matter, and showed her as
the unborn child at  the time of nuclear attack. &quot;We decided to make it
very abstract. I had the image of  me being a baby in the womb yet not a baby
because it's like a spiritual being,  surrounded by water and fluid in a tank
because that's what a baby does, floats  around inside this beautiful place.&quot;
</P>
<P> Keith Macmillan is the man who has been interpreting Kate's ideas and
actually  getting them on film for the great part of the 2 1/2 years she has
been releasing  records. He explained one or two problems to her with this
particular idea. Like she  might drown. Also no insurance company would
underwrite the risk. Kate has total  faith in Macmillan and was happy to leave
it with him to come up with an idea for  overcoming the problems.
</P>
<P> &quot;He went away, he's got fantastic guys working with him who get all
the props  together. So he came up with he idea of inflatables which when filmed
through  would give a watery effect. So I would be inside one which would be
inside maybe  one or two others.
</P>
<P> &quot;Then we had a problem with the costume because an embryo is of course
 naked but we couldn't make it sexual because of the innocence and sincerity of
the  thing. And we had a few problems with that because it is very difficult to
look  clothed but not clothed. Because we were working with inflatables which
were  basically just plastic we decided to use the same material which would be
pretty cool  for an embryo because it would just be flesh that was amongst all
the other. So we  just wrapped polythene all around me and then the whole thing
became this sort of  transient stuff that wasn't either costume or inflatables.
The next thing with the  video was to get from the break into the end where the
baby has come out of the  womb. Because of the fallout the first thing that
would happen is that the baby  would be put straight into a protective suit,
probably sprinkled with Fuller's earth.  [??? Does anyone know what this is?]
</P>
<P> &quot;Again we tried to do that in an abstract way so that I would burst
out of the  bubble and land somewhere outside that was very weird. Then the two
guys with  the suns - the anti-nuclear sign - hand me the fallout suit as the
symbolism of being  in the outside world full of fallout. The end was getting as
many people as I could in  water - again water because that was the whole visual
them - and say: 'What are  we going to do without clean air to breathe?'
</P>
<P> &quot;It took us two days of filming, one to do the studio lot and one to
do the end  sequence with all our friends in the water and for the nice quiet
scene at the end. It  was really quite an epic compared with all the other
videos I've done. It wasn't that  extravagant or expensive, not that long and
not that anything. But as I said it felt so  important because that one song for
me - and quite a few people who are close -  was like a mini-symphony or
something. So everything had to go into it even if it  wasn't going to be a big
hit and that's how we felt about it. OK, people say: 'It  didn't get into the
top five.'
</P>
<P> &quot;But I'm so pleased with how it went because for the subject matter I
was  dealing with, you know my previous associations with the public: that I'm a
very  harmless unpolitical songwriter.&quot;
</P>
<P> The association of the image she projected on a totally unprepared public
with  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in 1978 has stayed firmly in the minds of
many: this strangely  dressed peculiar person singing in a voice that can only
be described as weird. At  least that's how it sounded at the time. Kate
maintains that at the time - as now -  she was singing in a voice which was
natural to her.
</P>
<P> &quot;Yes it is natural for me. So many people, I guess it's stopped a bit
now, but  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was the one that started it, they
thought it was a bit contrived.&quot;
</P>
<P> It was about the time of &quot;Wow&quot; that I personally began to enjoy
Kate's singles.  Listening to the songs now on an album with lyrics in front of
me I discovered there  is far more to her songs lyrically than just interesting
and effective hooklines. &quot;I  think that was the big thing with 'Wuthering
Heights&quot;, so many people didn't even  know I as singing in English! I think
on the new album the diction is clearest. You  see, for me it is important that
I keep changing with each album. When I was  singing on that first album it was
the most incredible experience of my life because  it was the first real album.
The one I'd been waiting for for five years, it was  actually being made. And
basically I was getting all my harmonies together in the  morning before I went
into the studio and just trying to sing my heart out. By the  time I got round
to singing on the first album I was very tired and at that time I  used to write
so many of my songs in a higher octave because that was where I used  to enjoy
singing.
</P>
<P> &quot;I used to find it fascinating to write in a note that I couldn't
reach and then a  week later I'd got my throat into the shape that it could
reach that note. It wasn't  actually acrobatics that I was playing with. It was
just that the songs I was writing,  they just seemed to leap, that was what I
wanted them to do, just fly in the air and  be high.
</P>
<P> &quot;The fact that people thought I was contrived - especially on the
first album -  worried me a lot. That there was this strange creature being
manipulated by this  huge record company. I think that actually as I am managing
to hang around a bit  longer - a year goes by and I'm still here - people are
beginning to take me  seriously and that's a fantastic breakthrough because
they're realising that I can in  fact churn out albums. And it's such a big
achievement for me to feel that I'm  actually getting through to people from me
rather than the rumours and stuff that  get around. And I'm so thrilled when
people do respect me, especially as a writer.
</P>
<P> &quot;Singing is such an important thing for me. I have such a strange
thing about it,  probably like every other artist. I really often feel that I
can't sing. I know I can sing  but when I hear the track back it's not what I
want, it's just not. I don't get  paranoid but I do get very, very worried about
it because it's so important to me  that I express the perfect emotion of the
word because they are telling a story, and  unless I feel that I fulfil the
character perfectly, I should get someone else to sing it.  Especially as people
have been kind enough to give me awards as a female singer  that I have to try
so hard to make it good for them.
</P>
<P> &quot;I think maybe I should relax a bit more about it, I am getting a bit
paranoid. I  love singing, it's just that when I hear it back on tape it is
never quite perfect  enough for me. But I'm sure you understand that. So many
artists, like Eric Clapton,  he probably thinks his solos could be better. He
probably wouldn't say it but I'm  sure that he feels that. But I wouldn't stop
singing because I love it. All I need is for  someone to say: 'That's great.'
And then I can go: 'Really?' Then I feel all right,  especially in the studio.

19:23:50 -0500 <BR> Subject: Fuller's earth 
</P>
<P>From the Sound Internation interview transcribed by Ron: (thanks Ron!) 
</P>
<P>&quot;that the baby would be put straight into a protective suit, probably
sprinkled  with Fuller's earth. [??? Does anyone know what this is?] 
</P>
<P>Fuller's earth is a kind of powdered clay, used for soaking up oils. A boon
to  klutzes who spill grease on their silk blouse or tie, and to those with oily
skin - for  making their own mud facials. 
</P>
<P>It's also slippery like talcum powder, so that's probably what Her KaTeness 
meant it to be used for.
