<P>Kate Bush Touches The U.S. At Last 
</P>
<P>From Pulse! April 1984 
</P>
<P>by Richard Laermer 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush first touched America's music sensibilities in 1977 with the
release of  her first record, a mysterious, melodic collection called The Kick
Inside [the album  wasn't released until 1978] and an appearance on Saturday
Night Live, performing  strange mime to some of her more viscerally meaningful
lyrics. While many viewers  scoffed at the undefinable movement on the screen,
some ran out in curiosity to buy  the product behind the performance. 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside feature Bush as writer, singer, and keyboardist, and
dissects such  esoteric subjects as telepathy, sensuality, incest, and the
classic film Wuthering  Heights. In 1977, a year laden with disco, Kate's vinyl
presence stood out as new and  original. But the Bush sound - unusual to be sure
- has taken time to catch on in this  country. While British critics call Kate &quot;too
commercial,&quot; because of her frequent  appearances on family talk shows and
other promotional venues, her label, EMI, has  felt until recently that her
records were &quot;too British for American tastes.&quot; So, with  only one of
her four records available here domestically, Bush fans had to search the 
import bins for her product. Her second album, Lionheart, was suddenly released 
without explanation by EMI on January 13 and it entered Billboard's LP and tape 
charts at #202, Kate's first appearance on those charts. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know why they released it,&quot; said Caroline Prutzman of EMI
in New  York. &quot;I think EMI believes in Kate and would like to see her break
over here. They  have all that material, and she does have a following, so it
seems like a good idea.&quot; So  good, in fact, that by the time this Pulse!
hits the stores, EMI should have a domestic  release of Kate's third album,
Never For Ever, in the stores. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's hard to say exactly what they're trying to do.&quot; Prutzman
commented, &quot;but  Kate's video (Kate Bush In Concert) has been playing all
over the country, and it's  been received very well.&quot; That video is also
commercially available. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Only two of my records have actually been released in America,&quot;
Kate notes  from her studio in Great Britain. &quot;I was really pleased that
there were so many  people trying to get hold of the albums on import.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This sentiment is from a 25-year old lady who began writing songs at age 11.
She  says, &quot;I didn't think I was going to do it for a profession. It was
fun, something I  really enjoyed. I spent most of my time create scenarios for
songs. At 16 I had gotten  to the point where my songs were presentable. That
was after five years of writing  ballads and slow songs like 'The Man With The
Child In His Eyes.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate started recording her songs at that young age with the help of close
friend  David Gilmour [actually they weren't and aren't &quot;close friends&quot;],
lead singer of Pink  Floyd. Gilmour was so impressed with his pal's burgeoning
talent that when she was  16 he introduced Kate and her vast collection of music
to EMI. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I signed a recording contract at 16. The hardest thing,&quot; Kate
admits modestly,  &quot;was choosing the songs.&quot; Having stockpiled much
more than an album's worth of  songs, she was able to choose from the cream of
the crop. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; the first single, was a huge it in several
European countries.  &quot;The story in 'Wuthering Heights' had been bugging me
for about a month,&quot; Kate  recalls, pondering on the lives on Emily Bronte's
doomed lovers. &quot;At the time I was  recording the album, I began to down my
thoughts on Cathy and Heathcliff and  their incredible relationship. I really
enjoyed the energy between those two.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And so did single buyers in England, pushing Kate Bush to superstar status
her  first time out. She toured the continent and Japan - where The Kick Inside
still  reigns as a national favorite - and returned six months later to record
Lionheart, a  quickly-produced recording that Kate now things [sic: thinks]
harshly about: &quot;I had  only a week after we got back from Japan to prepare
for the album. I was lucky to  get it together so quickly. But the songs seem to
me, now, to be somewhat  overproduced. I didn't put enough time into them.&quot;
She gave more time, and  thought, to her 1980 release, Never For Ever, her first
self-produced effort which,  surprisingly enough, sported her first released
single (&quot;Babooshka&quot;) in the states and  a big selling cult single in
several American cities (the import &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;). 
</P>
<P>The U.S. record buyer, however, ignored Kate until '82 when the rocker LP
The  Dreaming came out stateside in large quantities and suddenly the anonymity
of a  singer from Kent, England was reversed. That albums' hard sound proved to
be her  American kick-off, and due to the newfound saleability of Kate Bush, EMI
quickly  followed The Dreaming with a 1983 EP featuring some of her best
material from the  pervious four releases (called Kate Bush). Available only in
the United States and  Canada, this limited edition, with Kate dramatically
poised in brass armor, was  EMI's intended mode of bringing U.S. attention to
Britain's singer elite. 
</P>
<P>Strength was her one motive when commencing work on The Dreaming, she  says,
explaining how for the first time she relied &quot;on the power of the music&quot;
rather  than sultry tunes and serene lyrics prominent in her previous albums.
And the  power in Kate Bush's music was an evolutionary process that is traced
in the Kate  Bush EP, fusing the new Bush force with those beautifics utilized
in the earlier  records. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was trying, in The Dreaming, to get myself up to the point I knew I
was  capable of,&quot; kate says of the search for power. &quot;the Dreaming was
my emotional  image and I am thankful that I had good people to help with the
dynamics.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The last studio effort took almost two years to complete as she needed to
work  with specific technical directors who, unfortunately, weren't always
available for  her. Today she works with only one. &quot;I was looking for a
certain imagination in an  engineer and I ended up going with quite a few and
working in many different  studios,&quot; she notes. &quot;That's not what I
would've wanted to do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The visual imageries that come across in The Dreaming are due, she points
out,  &quot;to the painstaking time we took to get every effect perfect.&quot; &gt;From
The Kick Inside  to the last album, movement has been an evident element in her
work. Kate  mentions how, &quot;Back when I recorded Kick I had just discovered
the enjoyment of  dance and I was so knocked out by that, that writing was a
breeze for me.&quot; Dance,  and the fine art of movement, Kate says, are
responsible for the free flow of many of  her songs. 
</P>
<P>In The Dreaming, she lends a topical theme to many cuts. &quot;Sat In Your
Lap,&quot; a  punk influenced homage to pop Brit culture circa 1982, shows off
Kate's feelings on  knowledge and education: &quot;Knowledge is something sat in
your lap/something that  you never have,&quot; because, in the singer's eyes, &quot;the
more you realize, the more you  need to learn.&quot; But other parts of the
record present a more maudlin view of things:  The crazed &quot;Get Out Of My
House&quot; was inspired by the horrors in Steven Kings  The Shining and
utilized several overlapping tracks that simulate madness. Kate sings  about a
house that takes over, a house possessed by devilish innards. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm writing a particular song,&quot; she says excitedly, &quot;I
can feel a character  so strongly that perhaps I'm feeling the same.&quot; Well
aware that her songs provide  listeners with some extreme characterizations, she
finds it &quot;terribly important ... to  make the person I am writing about
come alive. Unless I can somehow live the  experience I don't feel that I've
achieved what I want to as a writer.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate is busy these days putting the pre-studio finishing touches on her
fifth  record. &quot;I've been writing material for my new album - the songs are
almost  complete now,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope to start recording in a
couple of months when I've  finished writing and tightening up the lyrics.&quot;
As for the direction the record's  music will take, she hasn't decided yet. She
will venture to the U.S. later this year  to promote it but not to tour. &quot;It's
a shame, but for now I don't see the possibility of  a tour,&quot; she says with
a sigh. &quot;We can't afford to do it the way I'd want to.&quot; The way  she
wants to do it is right. For now she will wait and see the reaction to her
newest  product, and in the meantime hope that her American success continues to
grow.  About America, Kate is glad that video has made it to the forefront of 
entertainment. Having produced a clip for each single to date, on of her
problems in  not catching on here, she is well aware, has been the lack of video
venues. These  days most musically inclined cable channels carry Kate's work,
both past and  present. (According to ABC's 20/20, Kate was one of the
ground-breakers in video  production - years before MTV.) 
</P>
<P>On the twentieth anniversary of the Beatles' invasion, Kate said she only
became  &quot;very interested in the Beatles about four years ago. I'd always
liked their singles  but only really started listening to their albums a little
while ago. I think they are a  great influence on any writer,&quot; she noted, &quot;the
quality of their work is something, I  feel, every composer aspires to.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Specific songs have left their mark on Kate Bush: &quot;So many records have
left  great impressions on me. It is always hard to just call them all to mind
so quickly but  to mention a few - &quot;No. 9 Dream&quot; by John Lennon: &quot;I
Am The Walrus&quot; by The  Beatles: &quot;He's My Man&quot; by Billie Holiday: &quot;Best
of Both Worlds&quot; by Robert Palmer:  &quot;Really Good Time&quot; by Roxy
Music: &quot;Tropical Hot Dog Night&quot; by Captain Beefheart:  &quot;Montana&quot;
by Frank Zappa: music by Eberhard Weber, and &quot;the Wall&quot; by Pink  Floyd
(and pal David Gilmour).&quot; 
</P>
<P>The first record this lady of music ever purchased was &quot;They're Coming
To Take  Me Away, Ha-Ha&quot; by Napoleon XIV. She was very young. Pondering the
subject of  when she got into music, said that, &quot;I've always been into
music. I was a child then  and I think all children embrace music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>These days Kate finds she's too busy to get involved in pop culture. &quot;Since
I've  been in the business I've had a lot less time to keep up with what's
happening,&quot; she  said regretfully. &quot;I don't feel I have to 'keep up'
as such, but I always love to hear  good music and see new interesting bands.&quot;

</P>
<P>But most of what she listens to these days is classical. &quot;Very little
contemporary -  mostly old favorite records and Radio 4.&quot; Britain's quiet
one on the dial.
