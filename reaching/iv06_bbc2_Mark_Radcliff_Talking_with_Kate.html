<P ALIGN="left"><em>Hello, I'm Mark Radcliffe, and this is &quot;Talking with Kate&quot;. 
I suppose, like everyone else, I was first confronted by Kate Bush, when I heard 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Still one of the most extraordinary pop records ever made; 
an astonishing, intoxicating debut single for an artist who seemed like no 
other; a passionate, driven, unique and - let's be honest - drop dead gorgeous 
woman who at the time was just 19. Since then, her career has been one the most 
correct fascinating in music.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Despite a love of dance and expression she toured 
just once before retreating into the studio to make a series of audibly 
different, yet consistently fascinating albums. Which reached a peak with 
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; in 1985. One side contained irresistibly off-kilter hits; the 
other, an ambitious song suite. There was another classic album of &quot;The Red 
Shoes&quot; in 1993, and then nothing. Nothing until November 2005 when a new double 
album &quot;Aerial&quot; was released to an avid public. The Bushites came out of hiding 
to enter the shelves eager to immerse themselves in &quot;Kate World&quot; once again. 
&quot;Aerial&quot; entered the charts at number three. Brit nominations followed. After 12 
years with barely a peep, Kate had produced a contemporary classic.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(&quot;Joani&quot; segment played)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Given our lengthy career as a minor disc jockey on 
a range of popular music radio stations, I've been lucky enough to meet and talk 
to most of the artists whose work I've admired. On occasion, I'll admit I get a 
little blasé at the prospect of interviewing another band or singer, but talking 
with Kate was different.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I pursued her relentlessly across the airwaves, 
building a montage of her photographs on the studio wall, and when I heard there 
was a new album I raced in there, called the head of her record company, who 
conveniently went to the same school as me and got an early interview requests 
straight to the notoriously publicly publicity shy enigma. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The adolescent fantasy, who'd retreated into a 
private world of studios and motherhood. I got a call back. Kate might do it. 
But she wanted to talk to me, and they'd given her my mobile number. For days I 
jump every time the phone rang and was then disappointed when it wasn't her. And 
when she did ring of course Sod's Law it went to answerphone.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I've still got the message saved though. It's not 
a bit everyday you get a missed call from Kate Bush is it? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Eventually we did speak at length. And we got on 
well. She was funny and interesting and well, normal and I was... well she could 
tell I wasn't a stalker or anything. So she invited me to her house for cheese 
flan and a chat about the new record. The record is wonderful. The cheese flan 
was delicious and the chat... well decide for yourself. Here's me... talking 
with Kate:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It seems to have taken quite a long time (laughs) first album since 
1983, does it feel like a long time to you?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Why's it taken so long?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, I suppose when I finished the last record, I really didn't 
want to go straight back in and make another one. I thought I'd take a year 
out...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Which takes us to 1994<br>
<br>
(Both laugh)<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes, it's been a long year. After about a year, I decided really 
that it was just something I want to kind of stay with a bit longer. I suppose 
really, since I was about 17 or 18, I'd gone and made a record, promoted it, and 
then gone straight back in to do the next one. And because they take such a long 
time, there's the impression that, you know, there's these big gaps in between 
where I'm not doing anything. But with a lot of those records, I was actually 
working on them for a long time. And it's... it's quite an intense process. And 
I think it got to the point, at the end of the last one, where I just thought, I 
don't want to just go straight in and do another one. I want to just take a 
break, and do some other stuff.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Why does it take so long?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Well, that's a very good question. I ask myself that. The actual 
writing is normally very quick. And with a lot of them, what I do is go in and 
just write straight onto tape.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Right, so that's the first time the song exists outside your head 
is when you go into the studio...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b>... so its all just in there and all just flows out. In one take?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, no. It just sort of comes together.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Right<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> It's a bit different with piano/vocal tracks, that would be written 
at the piano as opposed to written onto tape and then once I've written it, I 
would just put it onto tape so that's a different process. Because that's the 
way I used to write when I was a little girl I used to just sit at the piano and 
write the songs and, in a way, it was like I was the tape machine I guess. But 
once I started working in my own studio. I wanted to stop making demos, because 
the problem was, you'd make a demo, and it'd be really good, but I couldn't use 
it because it wasn't you know, technically sounding right. So you try to 
reproduce it in their never sound the same wouldn't have the atmosphere or the 
buzz. So I thought, well let's just not make demos, let's put it straight on the 
master tape, and that way even though you might redo elements of it. You've 
always got an initial energy and atmosphere.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's called &quot;Aerial&quot;, there's &quot;A Sea of Honey&quot; and &quot;A Sky of 
Honey&quot;... what's the concept that's driving it?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> One of the things I thought I did wrong with the last record, was 
that I think it was too long. And what I was trying to do, was give people as 
much for their money as possible. With the last record I was making a CD, as 
opposed to a vinyl record.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's a problem then isn't it? I think a lot of my favorite albums, 
there might be eight tracks on it and it's great and you can turn it over and 
everything. And there was this thing with CDs... it can take 70 minutes, 
therefore we should do 70 minutes, and it's a mistake... is that they can be a 
mistake.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I think it's very difficult, ‘cause as an artist you want to give 
people their money's worth. In a lot of ways, people's attention span doesn't 
really last that long. And what was so great about vinyl records was you had 
that forced gap. I suppose, also, I always really liked the process of making 
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, which was a sort of... similar idea... except that was one 
side of a record, rather than a two record set. So in some ways, this is a bit 
like a kind of larger version, more like a sort of... &quot;Irish Wolfhounds of 
Love&quot;.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Yeah!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Aerial&quot; is Kate Bush's first album since &quot;The Red 
Shoes&quot;, 12 years ago.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(&quot;King of the Mountain&quot; is played)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The lead track and first single from the album is 
called &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;. When it was released in October 2005, it was a 
tantalizing taster for the album and got to number four in the charts. Like many 
of Kate's earlier singles &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; was a great airplay hit and 
will be a staple of Radio Two's playlist for many years to come I imagine. &quot;King 
of the Mountain&quot; has enigmatic lyrics and is accompanied by an equally 
inscrutable video containing references to National Enquirer-style fantasy 
objects such as the man in the moon, a Himalayan yeti colony and William 
Randolph Hearst's mansion. All linked by an animated Elvis Vegas suit. I might 
be a bit thick, but despite this cascade of iconic information, I'm still no 
wiser as to what the songs actually about.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, I think a lot of people haven't got a clue what it's about<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> But you like that though, don't you?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes I do, I think it's brilliant, and I think whatever I have in my 
head when I'm writing it is important to me, but I think it's very important how 
that works for people who then listen to it or see it or whatever for that is, 
and then they become part of the process. It's like when you read a book part of 
the process of reading a book is that you as the reader... you're... you're as 
important as the book really. It could actually exist as a book in as you were 
there reading it. I think you become part of the process so how you interpret 
it, and mis-hear lyrics and ideas is...great. <br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> So, you don't what to say what it's about? Because you think that 
kind of negates that process for people then?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Yeah, I think so in a way. I mean, I thought it would be 
interesting to put this out as a first single, because people might be intrigued 
by the lyrics, because they're not, you know terribly straightforward. I don't 
think of myself as somebody who's got to come out and write hit single and I 
thought it might give it a bit of mileage that there might be a story there to 
discover.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> You'd rather not have to talk about it at all wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes, I would, but I want people to know the records out there. And 
so I have to let people know that it's out there. But I know, I just get on with 
my life, and so this for me is just a very small part of it. And yet for people 
standing at the outside looking in, this is a bit that they see and then they 
have this impression of me just retreating away into you know, some sort of 
big... vampire castle or something.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> To me it's mad because, you know, this is just a little bit, where 
I come and say &quot;Hi, the albums out, please come and buy it&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Aerial&quot; is a two CD set. The first disc contains 
seven songs, some of which seems to be concerned with feelings, whilst others 
are absorbed with direct references to Kate's domestic life. When I first heard 
this album. I'm surprised at this apparent frankness, and I couldn't understand 
why an artist to seem so protective of her privacy present songs that seemed to 
put her deepest feelings up to public scrutiny. Wasn't there a contradiction in 
that?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>I don't think that is a contradiction. I think that in a lot of 
ways, it makes complete sense and it's not that I guard my privacy fiercely but 
I think the creative process is something that's very difficult to focus on. You 
have so many distractions there such an incredible amount of stuff that comes in 
to interfere with that process, you know, you got so many technical things 
interfering with doing a vocal for instance. I often think it's like an actor 
trying to get into their role and they can't have that take because the lighting 
was wrong...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Or they get a great take and then they've got to do it again 
because a bit of the set fell down. It's almost like hanging onto that creative 
intention is actually very difficult throughout all the distractions that come 
along and I think for me to get into that creative process, I have been a sort 
of quiet place that I work from. And if I was living the life of somebody in the 
industry as a pop star, whatever... it's too distracting. Its too to do with 
other people's perceptions of who you are and what's important me is to be a 
human being who has a soul, and who hopefully has a sense of who they are and 
not who everybody else thinks you are. And I think that's something that's very 
difficult for people who become extremely famous to hang on to just being a 
human being.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>At times &quot;Aerial&quot; features lots of instruments, 
sounds, voices and complex arrangements. Other times, it's just Kate at the 
piano. But then, she's always had a vivid musical imagination. And I wondered 
where that first surfaced?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(Mrs Bartolozzi played)<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I was probably about 9 when I just started playing around with just 
little ideas, but by the time it was 12 through to 14 I was taking it very 
seriously. I mean, I come home from school and I'd sit and play the piano.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Even at that age, you knew that you were going to have a crack at 
it?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>I don't know, I knew it was something that I felt semi-obsessed by 
really that getting hooked process, which I think, again, I was very lucky to 
find that so young, because it allowed me to have a deep connection with that 
somehow.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Do you still play the piano for fun, or does it feel too much like 
work?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, I think my work is fun! And so there's not really a 
distinction. It's one and the same.<br>
<br>
(segment of &quot;Mrs Bartolozzi&quot; played)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There is a song on the album primarily about a 
washing machine.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(&quot;washing machine&quot; segment of &quot;Mrs Bartolozzi&quot; played)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Mrs...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Mrs. Bartolozzi<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> There will some people who will say &quot;perhaps you ought to get out 
more often, if you're writing a song about a washing machine&quot;<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Is it? Is it a song about washing machine? I think it's a song, 
about Mrs. Bartolozzi.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> I don't know who Mrs. Bartolozzi is<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, she's this lady in the song, who... does a lot of washing! 
(Laughs)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's not you then?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, it's not me, <br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Is it a real character or a fictitious one?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>No, it's fictitious, but as soon as you have a child a washing 
suddenly increases enormously...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Absolutely. Ours is on all the time at our house<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> And I spend all this time washing...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> What I like too is that a lot of people's actually think that it's 
funny! And I think that's great, as I think actually it's one of the heaviest 
songs I've ever written.<br>
<br>
(segment of &quot;Mrs Bartolozzi&quot; played)<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> It's the idea of this woman who's kind of sitting there looking at 
the washing going round, tumbling around in the water, and water becomes the 
sea, in the clothes, and the sea and the washing machine and the kitchen... and 
I just thought it was an interesting idea to play with.<br>
<br>
(segment of &quot;Mrs Bartolozzi&quot; played)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> There's a journey that goes on in that song I don't know where it 
leads. And he gets very sensual sounding it almost gets sexual sounding a one if 
the waves were different kind of waves. Or am I reading too much into it? 
There's one place were your skirt is up around the waist, and I was sort of 
reminded of the cover of &quot;Never Forever&quot;, the drawing of you lifting your skirt 
and all these fairies and goblins emerging from under it.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>(Laughs) I still can't look at that without laughing!<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's great! I like that!<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Oh, did you?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Yeah, yeah I do!<br>
<br>
(segment of &quot;Mrs Bartolozzi&quot; played)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> I always think of this sensual thing that comes out of a washing 
machine, and doing the washing and all that, and I'm almost thinking you're kind 
of the musical Nigella... the sensuality of the domestic experience.<br>
<br>
(Kate giggles)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Did you think about that at all?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>No.<br>
<br>
(&quot;swashy-swashy&quot;)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Is that song about sex?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't think it's about sex, but they do think it is quite sexy.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It made me think about that John Donne poem, &quot;The Good-Morrow&quot; the 
key line: &quot;And makes one little room an everywhere&quot;... the idea that everything 
you see is through this kind of... this domestic world that you create around 
you... that one place can be a kind of spy glass to lots of other places.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Well, I think in some ways, you know we all see our lives from 
inside our heads, which aren't really connected to the physical world or the 
structure of time at all. That's what's so interesting about art forms like 
music and books there to do with the passing of time there's a connection of you 
being taken somewhere on a journey that is not the same as perhaps a painting. 
Its almost something that is set in that instant. You know what I mean, whereas 
its music and stories unfold with time<br>
<br>
(&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is played)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kate Bush's work is often linked with literature.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kate loves narrative, because it can both expand 
and freeze time, it can take us on a journey, it can take us within ourselves or 
forces to turn outwards and all those ideas were there right at the start of her 
career.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Were you always reluctant to be a celebrity right from the 
beginning?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Ah, but I don't think of myself as a celebrity. I don't think I am. 
To me that's a dirty word, really.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Well, reluctant to be a pop star or reluctant to be famous.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't like pop star either.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> I know you don't, you've laughed...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Famous. You can't argue with famous.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Infamous, I would prefer.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Celebrated. Cherished.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Ohhh, cherished is lovely I wouldn't mind that...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I mean, I find it completely ridiculous, this obsession with 
celebrities. The important people are surgeons and doctors and people who 
actually put people back together and make a difference in people's lives, not 
somebody who's in an ad on telly. I mean, OK so that's valued for what it is 
too. But why so much attention on something that so shallow?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Some people seem to kind of want fame just for itself. Maybe 
there's the nothing wrong with... that I can't understand it, you find that kind 
of difficult because fame... which you undoubtedly attained... is almost a 
slightly unwanted byproduct of what it is that you do, isn't it really? Has 
there ever been a time where you enjoyed the fame when you were younger did you 
enjoy being &quot;Kate Bush the pop star&quot;. I noticed that you laughed when I said pop 
star because you obviously don't see yourself as a pop star. But your pop star I 
saw you on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; doing a number one hit single. So you must've been. 
Did you ever enjoyed that?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I think so, a lot of times when it's fun, and I think that's again 
that's important, if you can, to kind of try to keep it fun, because in a lot of 
ways. It's quite ridiculous really, what I desired was not to be famous, and I 
think that's the difference. I didn't want to be famous. I wanted to make a 
record, that was the big thing. And I was on a mission from God, and that's what 
I was going to do.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Were you always nervous about that? I mean in the beginning, it 
must've felt as a young girl, I mean, it must've felt great.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Nervous about what?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Being known, being famous, being bothered when you go out.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, I thought it was absolutely hilarious at first.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Even at that age?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Yeah, was fun! And it was my first record was very successful, 
which was I think was a big surprise to everyone.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Was it a surprise to you?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yeah, it was. I didn't expect it to do as well as it did. I mean, I 
hoped it would do well, but it was extraordinary success for a first record.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> You were quite a long time on that. Just very briefly I don't want 
to go through the whole thing again, but when you're kind of signed to EMI for a 
long time they let alone to sort of find your feet a bit, didn't they?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Well, that's what they say.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Right, so they were pressurizing you at the time?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, they weren't pressurizing me, quite the opposite. I wanted to 
make a record, and I think in a lot of ways, what they did is they signed me. 
Because they could see that there was potential there... then they just left me. 
And I think there was an element of their not wanting someone else to sign me. I 
mean through the help of Dave Gilmore, I had at least two of the tracks that 
were on the first album that was presented the record company, so &quot;The Man With 
A Child In His Eyes&quot; basically got me signed.<br>
<br>
(&quot;The Man With A Child In His Eyes&quot; played)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Looking back on Kate Bush at the time, and you used to present 
things... I had a flashback to that &quot;Not The Nine O'clock News&quot; Pamela 
Stephenson, what was it... &quot;Oh England My Leotard&quot;, or something.<br>
<br>
(Kate laughs)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Do you remember that?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes I do.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Do you find that flattering, maybe you find it insulting. Or maybe 
you thought, &quot;I've arrived and being taken off on 'Not The Nine O'clock News' &quot; 
which is the biggest TV show of that era.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I was obviously very flattered, because she was very beautiful. I 
think at the time it was very nervous that I was thinking that people were just 
taking the piss out of me because I was having the piss taken out of me so much 
by everybody. But I saw it a couple of years later, and I thought it was 
brilliant. It was really wonderful.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> You were marketed...In quite a...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Marketed?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> ... sensual sexual way weren't you?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't think I was marketed<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Well, the photographs that came out, were very sensual photographs. 
You know, very womanly photographs there is nothing wrong with that. But does 
that kind of... did you go along with that, or you quite surprised to see that 
kind of images when they came out?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> A you make it sound like it was something I was put together 
against my will<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> I don't know whether it was or it wasn't. I mean you were young, it 
would be quite understandable if some of it did.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> You mean the early photographs?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, because at that time I was a dancer and I think...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> That was what you saw yourself as first and foremost?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, I saw myself as a singer, but I was also a dancer and how do 
you present yourself as a singer in a photograph unless you are standing in 
front of a microphone? I was very comfortable in my body, I was a dancer and 
most dancers are. I mean, all the dancers when I was in dance classes used to 
wear leotards it was no big deal.<br>

<b>Mark:</b> When I first heard the album I didn't have any track listings. And 
then the next one seemed to be a sequence of numbers. And then this into a few 
times when I picked up on 3.1... and I'm pretty sure from my basic mathematics, 
which I haven't done since &quot;O&quot; level. Well you see, that's how old I am... we 
are... I think we're about a month apart... I thought &quot;that sounds like Pi&quot;. So 
why are you writing about numbers in a way? Why did Pi become the subject of the 
song?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I really like the challenge of singing numbers. Because numbers are 
so unemotional is a lyric to sing. It was really fascinating singing that. 
Trying to sort of put an emotional element into singing about a seven you know, 
into really care about that nine.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Did you care about...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I really cared about that nine.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Are hooked on Sudoku or whatever it's called? Number puzzles or 
something like that? Are you in a numerate sort of person?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I find numbers fascinating. I think the whole idea that nearly 
anything can be broken down into numbers is a fascinating thing. And I think 
also we are completely surrounded by numbers now in a way that we weren't even 
20, 30 years ago we're all walking around with mobile phones and numbers on our 
foreheads almost, and it's like computers... you know numbers are a very 
integral part of how we live now.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's often been said that Kate Bush could sing the telephone book 
and would sound fine to me. You've kind of almost done, it really. It's a 
sequence of numbers. Why Pi?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well I think... (laughs)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> That's the dog snoring, by the way<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't think he thought much of that question, he's getting fed 
up.<br>
<br>
(Both laugh)<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I suppose, you know, I find it fascinating that there are people 
who actually spend their lives trying to formulate Pi trying to take it to just 
a few more numbers further, because you know when I was at school it was a 
recurring number. It didn't go into the details past the point really. So the 
idea of this number that is in a way possibly something they could go on to 
infinity. And yet people are trying to pin it down and put their mark on it and 
make it theirs in a way I guess.<br>
<br>
(&quot;Pi&quot; ends &quot;Bertie&quot; begins)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Then there's a song &quot;Bertie&quot;, about your son, in a kind of medieval 
sort of style that then leaps in consecutive tracks from singing about numbers 
to singing about your son. You know, for the most emotional subject, you can go 
to then.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> As those really with the song like that you could never be special 
enough from my point of view. I wanted to try to give it an arrangement that 
wasn't terribly obvious. So I went for sort of put this early music...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes, very jaunty and medieval and kind of brings a childlike sense 
of fun to the thing<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Being a mother, and the mother and son, how much is that inspired 
and infused this record do you think?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I think it's all over it. It's everywhere in the record, it's such 
a big part of my life. So he's a very big part of my life.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> The life you lead has been because you prioritize being a mother, 
more or less, above everything else, isn't it?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes, it's such a great thing being able to spend as much time with 
him as I can, and you know he won't be young for very long and already he 
starting to grow up and I wanted to make sure they didn't miss out on that. So 
the idea was that he would come first in the record would come next, which is 
also one reason it's taken such a long time. To me that was really difficult at 
first I couldn't really work, because I'd always had as much time as I wanted in 
the studio, you know, I'd spend 14 hours day working on an idea you notice sort 
of going with the creative flow and I couldn't do that anymore. At first I found 
it crippling, because after two or three hours I'd have to stop. But actually I 
think it's one of the best things that could have happened because what it was 
in forcing me to do was keep standing back from it. And I think it was really 
good, but also, it was like on holidays as well and wanted to spend my time with 
him, so there were very big gaps in the whole process.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Where you didn't do any work on the album at all ?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Yeah.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> So, it's easy to see how time stretches out, isn't it?<br>
<br>
(&quot;Bertie&quot; ends and &quot;Prelude&quot; begins)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As we already said, &quot;Ariel&quot; is an album split into 
two parts. &quot;A Sea of Honey&quot; and &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot;. The first disc, &quot;A Sea of 
Honey&quot; contains seven separate songs whereas the second, &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot; is a 
nine piece song suite that needs to be listened to in a single sitting, as Kate 
said, to take a listener on a journey.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In his review in the Independent Andy Gill 
described &quot;Aerial&quot; as having a core of contented domesticity at its heart, 
nowhere is this more abundantly apparent than in &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot;. I'm already 
blocking out summer afternoons in next year's diary, so I can listen to it in 
the garden. Kate has expressed in understandable reluctance to have pieces of &quot;A 
Sky of Honey&quot; played in isolation outside their proper context. I asked her why.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I feel very strongly about the way things have moved. Its like the 
art form of an album is seriously under attack, with iTunes and people's lack of 
time or attention span to sit through a whole album everything's becoming very 
fast - gimme a quick hit now - people will go onto iTunes and just pick the one 
track they want off an album they won't listen to the whole album. I know that 
the album will always exist as an art form, but I think it's a shame. I don't 
like to see stuff being dissected like that. It's very much a symptom of the way 
we live now - everything's sort of disposable.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Yeah, sure, I see what you're saying, definitely... because I mean, 
I kind of forget what I hear a track from a my favorite albums and the next 
track doesn't follow, because that's a sequence of things I remember, how wanted 
to be. I don't like iTunes as I can't work it anyway.<br>
<br>
(&quot;Prologue&quot; plays)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> What about the relationship between your voice and the birdsong, 
because it's almost like... there are parts of the record where you actually you 
let your voice have free reign, don't you. It's kind of, you got a wide octave 
range anyway, but you've...really kind of let rip with the voice... is kind of 
like taking off in the fight really at times, isn't it?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, I suppose I was just kind of playing with the idea of how 
could human language connect with Birdsong.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> There's times when it's kind of it's almost like the rhythm of the 
wood pigeons or something. They're creating their own natural rhythm through 
their voices. Perhaps it's manipulated natural rhythms and you spent ages just 
trying to drop in the right places...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, no, it is just the natural rhythm. I think Birdsong was really 
beautiful sound. What I find interesting about it too is the way they mark the 
day. Like for instance the dawn chorus... they seem to be very strongly 
connected with light, and I think in some ways, that was sort of the 
explorations I was trying to go off on... with this the connection between their 
song and light in the passing of day. And as the sun goes down, all the birds 
sing again, the beautiful thrush and blackbird songs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Apart from her feathered friends Kate is invited 
some other old acquaintances to help on &quot;Aerial&quot;. Here's one of them. Can you 
hear who it is yet?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(Rolf Harris' voice)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> How did Rolf come to be involved again?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> You know, it's very interesting, because when people hear the 
records, the only two points that they stop to comment while they're listening 
is after &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;. People go. That's real drums, and I think, you 
know, &quot;My God&quot; , you know, where we got to the people have to comment that 
there's real drums on the track, and the next point they comment is when Rolf 
comes in, and they go &quot;is that Rolf Harris?&quot; And they have this really childlike 
delighted look on their face. Because they know it's Rolf, but they just wanted 
to be confirmed. I think it says a lot about how he's touched a lot of people. 
He's like a national treasure of ours now, isn't he?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Well, he's been around, you know, ever since we were kids. The 
public safety, swimming adverts and things like that.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes, really part of our culture, and I think he's a very talented 
guy is well. We all recognize him as a brilliant painter and very seriously 
accomplished painter.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> A portraitist by royal appointment now, isn't he?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, absolutely, and I suppose really that's what he sprung to 
mind because I needed a singing painter.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> And there aren't many in the Yellow Pages<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> There aren't many.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> You've got Rolf doing the painting, and that's weaved through it, 
and you talk about the light in Italy at one point, and you talk about the rain 
goes on Rolf's paintings, and smudges the colors and things. There's a track on 
their called &quot;An Architect's Dream&quot;, and in that there's a line where you say, 
&quot;it was the best mistake he could make&quot;. Is that a kind of key phrase that like 
even though you get this precise way of making the sounds in your head that 
sometimes it's what you might call the mistakes or the accidents that are kind 
of a really special moments?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Yeah, well, I think in a lot of creative processes, that's the best 
thing can happen to you... is to make a mistake, and it's something you would 
never have consciously thought of, and it just happens. And it gives you 
somewhere to go off to that is far more interesting than something you would've 
thought of.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> There's a lot of kind of folk instruments pop up, a lot of 
technology, and you kind of... Fairlight and things like that... right at the 
forefront of technology. It seems you want to humanize it with some kind of 
texture of folk instruments that you've used on different records.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I really like the combination of technology and acoustic, and I 
think it's very interesting to combine the two, so you get a kind, of a don't 
know, interesting textural thing that comes with using very warm acoustic 
sounding instruments with cold electronic sounding.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Right, here's some theories, some &quot;Aerial&quot; theories, right, of 
mine… mother and son relationship, a lot of water images in what you do. &quot;Ariel&quot; 
is the little mermaid, there’s one. Sylvia Plath wrote a collection of poems 
called &quot;Ariel&quot;, very intense love poems...<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Did she?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Yeah, there's a Shakespearean spirit in ‘The Tempest’ called 
Ariel...somebody got the Tempest... and there's also Ariel washing powder for 
the washing machine we were talking about before.<br>
<br>
(Both laugh)<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Uh..uh..&quot;Product placement&quot;?<br>
<br>
(Both laugh)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> So?<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> None of those, presumably?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Well, I think, I think all of them, [They laugh] and many more. But 
that's what I liked about the word was it's got so many levels to it. It 
actually means &quot;of the air&quot;, and, you know, also I always have an image of 
aerial suggesting height, as well so, it felt like it worked very well for the 
second disc. Uh, you know, with the sort of theme of birds...and also an aerial 
is something that collects and gives out sound waves, and we've all got aerials 
connected to our televisions and our mobile phones, and…. I just thought it was 
an interesting word that had lots of puns.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark: </b>Well I'll tell you what I think... here's Rolf Harris, in your 
garden, painting a picture with all the birdsong going on and everything, and it 
seems to be a kind of dream sequence or something the develops into a Midsummer 
night from that.<br>
<br>
(Kate laughs)<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Anything in that or am I clutching at straws?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, I think that's great! I think it's what you want it to be. If 
that's how you see it then I think that's lovely.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's wrong<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't know if it's wrong<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It's not wrong?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> It's not wrong, it might not be what I thought of when I was 
writing it. Again, I don't think that particularly matters if it does something 
for you, if it takes you on a journey, then that's great. Somebody said to me, 
they said &quot;it's not like listening to record it's like watching a film or 
something&quot;. And that was just the most fantastic compliment anybody could have 
said, I mean, if that's the only good thing that anyone says, then that's 
wonderful.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Time constraints means that sadly we can't present 
the whole of &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot; as Kate intended it to be heard. That's a genuine 
shame, because when taken as one continuous piece of music, it's breathtaking. 
But one of the pieces from the suite, which I feel gives a real flavor of the 
whole thing is called &quot;Somewhere in Between&quot;. Here it is:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(&quot;Somewhere in Between&quot; is played)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That was &quot;Somewhere in Between&quot; a section of the 
&quot;A Sky of Honey&quot; disk from Kate Bush's new album Ariel, and you're listening to 
Mark Radcliffe on Radio Two, and I'm talking with Kate Bush. &quot;Aerial&quot; has been 
12 years, on and off, in the making. For a major artist like Kate Bush the 
responsibility to get the work finished must have been almost suffocating at 
times.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Do you need a team of people around you to do the work or do you 
work a lot on your own?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I think a lot of the process is quite insular. It's similar to 
being a writer, as you know, it's that quiet place again. But yes, I do. I do 
have to have a team around me and this is a small group of people who it's very 
important to me, their feedback. I know it's very important to me what Danny 
thinks of my stuff...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> He's your partner and Bertie's dad?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> And he's very critical, which is fantastic, which is what I want.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Who else?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I suppose in the studio context, I work with a sound engineer that 
I've worked with for a very long time. So...<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> That's Del?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes. So that's important too<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Yeah.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> But you know what's interesting. I think sometimes when people say 
that you can't do that or it wouldn't work was actually the beginning of 
something that made me think &quot;Oh, so this must be quite interesting then&quot;. 
Because in a way, I think you have to make things that you like. And if somebody 
says that they don't like it... it's challenging your own thoughts of whether 
you really think it's any good or not, and if you really do think it's good, 
even if people say they don't like it... there's maybe this sense in there that 
maybe it's not right yet. But that doesn't mean it's not good.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>That what's good about having people around you who were quite 
critical<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Right, so sometimes the criticism can be really positive thing 
then?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>Yes.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Yeah. Even though you got you this team of people, this support 
network of people you need around you, it's in no way a democracy. It's your 
record. And you kind of make your own decision absolutely. I mean, you write it 
and you produce, it is entirely her vision in the end.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes. And that's what's the buzz for me. I don't think I could work 
with a producer, I'd find it terribly infuriating. I just wouldn't like it.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Well, you've got a new album out and you're very proud of it, and 
you're very proud of it. Reaction is very positive. Is there any part of you 
that thinks. Actually, I wish I could get out on stage and to do this for 
people.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> But you won't.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't know if I won't. Normally something else comes along to 
sort of take me away from even pursuing the idea the any further. Yes, I would I 
would like to do some shows.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> So you wouldn't rule it out?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>No, I wouldn't rule it out, but then, I haven't ruled it out for 
the last 20-odd years.<br>
<br>
(Kate laughs)<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I haven't done it yet<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> It just hasn't happened yet.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Have you got songs lying about that might form the basis for 
another record?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No. <br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> No, nothing?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate: </b>No, there's bits and pieces, but I wouldn't use them.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Right, because at current rates, if you repeat the gap between &quot;The 
Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;Aerial&quot;... we should expect a new album in 2017. Is there any 
prospect it would be sooner?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Well, I hope, so, yes. I like to be unpredictable, because I've 
heard this before... then I'd be like 84 or something before the next one. I 
like to think that I'm not that easy to pin down.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> That's for sure!<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Do feel a relief now that it's out? Is a great to have the it 
finished?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> Yes.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Is it also frightening because now you've kind of got to see what 
people think of it?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> No, it's fantastic. I'm so excited about it coming out. It took so 
long to make I just thought I was never going to finish it.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Did you? There were days when you to sort of almost crying with 
frustration and beating the mixing desk, because you thought you were never 
going to finish it?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I don't know about beating in the mixing desk, but... I just... it 
took so long trying to piece it together and try to make it work in so many 
times I just thought I was even have the energy of the strength to sue. To try 
and finish it. So it's fantastic relief to have it all done. I mean, when I 
first finished it I thought like I was being let out on good behavior.<br>
<br>
<b>Mark:</b> Did you doubt what the response would be?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b> I think I did worry about there being such a long gap, I was 
worried that... without wanting to sound sentimental, I was worried that people 
would forget about me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kate Bush, through the quality for work, and the
