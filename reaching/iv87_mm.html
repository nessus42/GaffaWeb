<P>From: 840248n@aucs.UUCP (Derek Noble) <BR> Date: 29 Jan 87 19:19:33 GMT
<BR> Subject: Much Music Spotlight, Canada TV, 28th Jan 1987 
</P>
<P>On Wednesday Jan. 28 on Much Music (the Canadian answer to MTV) there was  a
Kate Bush spotlight which highlighted 6 of her videos and a few snatches of an 
interview that VJ Christopher Ward conducted with her in the Much Music studio
in  Toronto. The following is what transpired: 
</P>
<P>KB: I can actually say I'm happy with some of the things we did in it. It's
one of  those things that when you make a video, quite often the song isn't
lending itself  to the kind of visual ideas that you'd like it to, and with
Breathing I think it had  such a strong story that it was easier for us to
visualize something that we felt  was powerful. 
</P>
<P>CW: The song sounds like it was built on visual ideas to begin with, to some
extent. 
</P>
<P>KB: I think when I'm writing songs I do have quite strong visual ideas but
they're  not necessarily video vidual ideas if you know what I mean. I think in
order to  get to a place or to consider yourself in someone else's position you
try to  imagine an environment and I thinkk in some ways you think quite
visually about  that. 
</P>
<P>Video: Breathing 
</P>
<P>Video: Sat in Your Lap 
</P>
<P>CW: You suffered a fate in the early going of your career of being somewhat
of a  pinup girl in the British pop mags. How did you deal with that? 
</P>
<P>KB: I think what worried me was that it was going to stop people taking my
music  seriously. I always find it very complimentary of people who say that
they find  me attractive and my worry is really that it would get in the way of
my music. It's  not that I find that so much of a problem as people wouldn't
accept my music,  but I don't think that that has been a problem, I think people
do seem to accept  my music for its sake. 
</P>
<P>Video: The Dreaming 
</P>
<P>Video: Running Up That Hill 
</P>
<P>Video: Cloudbusting 
</P>
<P>Video: Experiment IV
