<P>STEVE STROUT<BR>  AND ASSOCIATES</P>
<P> NOTE TO DISC JOCKEYS AND INTERVIEWERS</P>
<P>The lady is only 19, but she's been called  &quot;phenomenal,&quot; &quot;amazing,&quot;
 &quot;fantastic,&quot; &quot;incredible,&quot;  and all the other superlatives
you can think of.  And they're all accurate, but to top it all, KATE  BUSH is a
truly warm, sensitive and generous  human being. And would you believe she's
beautiful,  as well. This truly remarkable woman who hails  from southeast
London, had a number one single  in England with &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; 
a soulful song based on the classic novel.</P>
<P>And now her first album, &quot;The Kick Inside,&quot;  is out here in the
States on the EMI label. It's a major  hit all over Europe and should repeat its
success on this  side of the big pond and establish Kate as a major new star.</P>
<P>This is the KATE BUSH RADIO SPECIAL, from EMI  Records, with this remarkable
singer-songwriter who  came to music early, her two older brothers being 
members of an Irish traditional band. At age 11, Kate  began poking around at
the piano, making up ditties  and then putting poems she learned in school
together  with the melodies. Kate sings in a kind of unforgettable  banshee wail
and moves like an oil slick when she's  performing. Altogether, she is something
else!! </P>
<P>This SPECIAL is a &quot;SELF-PORTRAIT,&quot; by  Kate Bush; an intimate,
revealing audio autobiography,  in which you share her thoughts and feelings as
she  introduces four tracks from her 13 track album.</P>
<P>It's a completely flexible program, for use during any  35-minute portion of
your show - in its entirety, or the  bands may be used individually, as time
permits.  Commercials may be used at the end of each segment,  or news, etc. In
each instance, ad-lib your way back in.</P>
<P>The songs included are, &quot;THE KICK INSIDE,&quot;  &quot;WUTHERING
HEIGHTS,&quot; &quot;THE MAN  WITH THE CHILD IN HIS EYES,&quot; and &quot;STRANGE
 PHENOMENON.&quot;</P>
<P>An original and unique talent, this young doctor's daughter  has made an
outstanding debut album. The name Kate Bush  is one you'll be hearing for a long
time!</P>
<P>Thanks for your interest and co-operation.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>

<BR> Subject: TKI promo cassette 1978
</P>
<P>hello all...just got back from germany and am slowly readjusting to the
grind  again. i've got a few tidbits to share first though: 
</P>
<P>- however, said guy is not a total asshole as he kindly gave me a copy of
what he  said was a promotional cassette that KaTe recorded for the release of
the kick inside  (in germany, i would presume). the most interesting thing about
this tape (besides  KaTe's utter idealism which i will transcribe for you
momentarily) is that the songs  that are on it *are not* the same versions that
were released on the album. the  differences are subtle, but they are there:
different instrumentation, diffrent mixes,  etc. 
</P>
<P>so for you reading pleasure, i now produce a transcipt of said tape: 
</P>
<P>[A stripped down version of The Kick Inside&quot; is played. KaTe's voice
seems less  full than it does on the lp - I haven't fully compared them yet. It
fades after the first  verse and is used as a backing track for the following
words.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hello everyone. This is KaTe Bush and I'm here with my new album The
Kick  Inside and I hope you enjoy it. The album is something that has not just
suddenly  happened. It's been years of work because since I was a kid, I've
always been  writing songs and it was really just collecting together all the
best songs that I had  and putting them on the album, really years of
preparation and inspiration that got it  together. As a girl, really, I've
always been into words as a form of communication.  And even at school I was
really into poetry and english and it just seemed to turn  into music with the
lyrics, that you can make poetry go with music so well. that it  can actually
become something more than just words; it can become something  special. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The way I've always worked is to be with the piano. I never write
songs without  the piano - it's always me and it and we communicate. And I
always write the words  with the tune - they seem to come together and it's very
much a thing of moods. if  the chord I'm playing is telling me something, then
the words will come from that.  If it is a minor feel, it will be a sad song
because minor chords are very sad things. If  it's a major chord, it will be a
slightly maybe, rockier, happier song. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What happens is that I sit down and I start playing the piano and it's
the  progression of chords that comes out that actually leads to the song. Until
I sit down  at the piano and have no idea what's going to happen. Sometimes,
before I go there,  maybe I'll have an idea that I've picked up from a film or
just from talking to  someone about something I've never known about before. You
can find inspiration  can click in so many different ways: it can be something
completely out of the blue  that you'll suddenly think 'i really want to write a
song.' I think that's how it  works though. I think art is about spontaneous
feelings and feedback of people,  objects, whatever. It's just a continuous
process of creation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The song 'The Kick Inside', the title track, was inspired by a
traditional folk  song and it was an area that I wanted to explore because it's
one that is really  untouched and that is one of incest. There are so many songs
about love, but they are  always on such an obvious level. This songs is about a
brother and a sister who are in  love and the sister becomes pregnant by her
brother. And because it is so taboo and  unheard of, she kills herself in order
to preserve her brother's name in the family.  The actual song is in fact the
suicide note. The sister is saying 'I'm doing it for you'  and 'don't worry,
I'll come back to you someday.' this is it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[&quot;The Kick Inside&quot; is played.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;'I'll send you love to zeus oh by the time you read this...' 
</P>
<P>&quot;That was the song 'The Kick Inside' off my new album released on EMI.
I hope  you liked it. this is KaTe Bush speaking&quot; 
</P>
<P>[commercial break?] 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Feel It&quot; begins and fades] 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is KaTe Bush again. I think maybe the reason I write songs is
maybe I need  to my express myself. That I need to be heard by people, maybe
just to feel that I  am someone for some reason. But I don't really think it
matters why as long as what  I'm doing has some purpose and if it, in any way,
makes other people feel happy,  which is all I'm into. I really hope that listen
to the song will enjoy it and have fun. 
</P>
<P>&quot;For me, age is very nebulous concept. It's something you can't really
label on  people. You meet people are maybe sixty years old are like a kid. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think life is all about your attitudes and how you actually see
things. I was  lucky enough to be born into a family that consists of very
observant people.  They're very aware of people's motivations and why they do
things. I think I'm  very lucky because a lot of that has rubbed off on me.
Since I've been a kid, I've  always been aware of observing people and trying to
observe myself and why I do  things. It's such an incredibly fascinating process
the way people work, I can't help  but be inspired by all that goes around me.
It's just incredible. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I was very lucky cos when I was a small child, my brothers
were  extremely musical. They were into traditional music: English and Irish
folk. They  were always playing stuff on the record players and had their own
bands and go  around the clubs. I got quite involved with it. I would sing along
with them and sing  harmonies. I think it was important cos when you are very
young, your mind is so  open for new stimulus and direction. I think it was
given to me then, so I didn't  really have to spend maybe ten years finding out
what I was here for. I think that's  been an important part of my life. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My other musical influences really have been things from the radio,
obviously,  because what you listen to are the things that are going on. And
again, what my  brothers were playing on the radio. At a later stage, I started
seeking out my own  stimulus and that came from people like, um, especially
billie holiday. She was a  really important thing to happen to me. Her voice
just really did things to me. So  emotional and so tearing. I still can't get
over how incredible her voice was and her  presence. I'm into more progressive
people, I guess, like david bowie and roxy  music and steely dan. I think they
are a very underestimated group, especially in  England. They really are an
important musical influence. And nearly anything really.  I love so much music.
I think that's the amazing thing about it: music can go into  every corner of
every room. There's so many different styles of music. Everyone is  great in
their own right - it's just a matter of personal taste, really. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think also one of the most amazing things about music, especially
for the last  twenty or thirty years, is the fact that we've been able to pre-
serve it on record. So  it's no longer someone jamming in a little club in the
thirties in a little smoky place.  It's an eternal process. You can listen to
people that have died maybe twenty years  ago. You can see them on the
television. You can see them moving and young. They  are no longer there. You've
captured that moment, purely through mechanical  things, which is really quite
ironic because music is such a pure emotional thing to  be captured on such a
mechanical modern contraption. But it's the only way we can  do it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This next song's called 'Wuthering Heights' and it's my single in
England. It's  from the novel called Wuthering Heights - you probably might know
it better as the  film. It's about the end of the film where Cathy has actually
died and she's coming  back as a spirit across the moors to come and get
Heathcliff again. And it just struck  me very strongly because it shows alot
about human beings and how if they can't  get what they want, they will go to
such extremes in order to do it. This is exactly  what she did. She wouldn't
even be alone when she was dead. She had to come back  and get him. I just found
it really amazing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is played.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that song was 'Wuthering Heights' and this KaTe Bush talking to
you and  I hope you're still with us and having a good time. That was from my
new album,  The Kick Inside on EMI records.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[commercial break?] 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Feel It&quot; begins again and fades again...] 
</P>
<P>&quot;this is KaTe Bush again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think probably one of the most amazing things about the music scene
today is  the fact that music is purely one aspect of it. It is in fact a very
large commercial  business. This is why it is so hard for new unknown people to
get into to - because  it's a money-making business. A lot of companies are into
creating formulas that  will actually make the money for them and it's hard for
people who have got  something new to get through. But then again, there are the
people in the companies  who are aware of this and I think that that's where the
magic lies because if you get  through to them then you're all right. 
</P>
<P>&quot;For me, the most important thing is my music. That's what I'm here
for. I think  it's important that you realize that it is a business because you
can't just play your  music and shut yourself away because you have to
communicate with your audience  becasue they're the people that you're doing it
for. You just have to compley with  all the rules.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think an interesting thing is happening in the music scene at the
moment - I  think from the beginning of this year, especially in England. It was
purely because  of Punk. It was a very quick dynamic thing that happened and I
think its purpose  was in order to bring new things out of it. We now have a
sort of thing called new  wave, which has come from punk, but it's not like punk
at all. It's rich in  interesting lyrics, completely different attitude towards
music. There are very  interesting lyrics that are based a lot more on reality
than a lot of things have gone  before. I think that's the trouble with a lot of
music that was happening: things  were becoming purely romantic bubblegum. Just
talking about boy meets girl. The  great thing about music is that it's a
message. You actually have the power to convey  a message to people to let them
know about something they didn't know about  before. I think that's an
incredible responsiblity on behalf of the artist. I find myself  very aware of
that and I often wonder if I am doing any good, but I know it's my  purpose.
It's what I must do. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I do love singing other people's songs. I have done. But I feel that
that is in fact  cheating becasue there are so many good singers around who sing
other people's  songs and there aren't as many songwriters in comparison. For
me, my only reason I  sing is becasue I write the songs and I feel because I've
written them and I know  what they're about, I'm the one that can convey the
message the best. But, I don't  really consider myself a singer. I'm a
singer/songwriter, but only because I write  the songs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe another interesting thing about this album is that two of the
tracks, 'The  man with the child in his eyes' and 'Saxophone Song' were recorded
about three  years ago. This was in fact my initial plunge into the business, as
they say, with the  help of Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd. I managed to get
through to him through a  contact of my brothers' and at that time he was
looking around for unknown talent.  He came along and heard me and we put some
things down and he put up the  money for me to make my first demo in a proper
recording studio with  arrangements. I owe to him the fact that I got my
contract and that I'm where I am  now. Two of these original tracks that we had
on the demo are on the album, so  maybe that helps with the variation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The inspiration for 'The man with the child in his eyes' was really
just a  particular thing that happened when I went to the piano. The piano just
started  speaking to me. It was a theory that I had had for a while that I just
observed in  most of the men that I know: the fact that they just are little
boys inside and how  wonderful it is that they manage to retain this magic. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I, myself, am attracted to older men, I guess, but I think that's the
same with  every female. I think it's a very natural, basic instinct that you
look continually for  your father for the rest of your life, as do men
continually look for their mother in  the women that they meet. I don't think
we're all aware of it, but I think it is  basically true. You look for that
security that the opposite sex in your parenthood  gave you as a child. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;The man with the child in his eyes&quot; is played.] 
</P>
<P>[&quot;L'amour looks something like you&quot; is played and faded.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is KaTe Bush again with my new album, The Kick Inside on EMI.
there are  thirteen tracks on this album. When we were getting it together, one
of the most  important things that was on all our mind was, that because there
were so many, we  wanted to try and get as much variation as we could. To a
certain extent, the actual  songs allowed this because of the tempo changes, but
there were certain songs that  had to have a funky rhythm and there were others
that had to be very subtle. I was  very very greatly helped by my producer and
arranger Andrew Powell, who really is  quite incredible at tuning into my songs.
We made sure that there was one of the  tracks, just me and the piano, to,
again, give the variation. We've got a Rock'n'Roll  number in there, which again
was important. And all the others there are just really  the moods of the songs
set with instruments, which for me is the most important  thing, becasue you can
so often get a beautiful song, but the arrangements can  completely spoil it
-they have to really work together. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think one of the really interesting things was compare live work
with actually  recording. It's such a completely different process, because when
you're gigging,  which I did for a little while with my band, the KT Bush Band,
we were just doing  pubs around London. We were singing other peoples' songs
-rock'n'roll songs. It's  really different because you feedback off the
audience. You can see their faces. You  can tell if they hate you or if they
love you. All you're trying to do when you're on  the stage is to excite them,
get them to have a good time and enjoy it. With the  album, it's a very
different thing because that's a piece of plastic that people,  hopefully, will
listen to again and again. So you have to make it a very different kind  of
thing, it has to be purely for the ear, to allow people's imaginations to just
move  on their own. We just tried to do this by the arrangements and harmonies.
There are  so many of those things that you can't do live because you,
obviously, can't overdub  your own voice three times when you're singing live.
You can't put harmonies in -  you get other people to do it. 
</P>
<P>The thing actually about playing it live is that in fact we weren't doing
any of my  songs - we were just doing other people's Rock'n'Roll numbers,
becasue in fact, in  the pubs in London, unless you're well known that's the
only way you get people to  listen to you. They need to know the songs and they
need to be able to drink their  beer and dance. And with the album, I was trying
to initiate my songs, which is a  completely different thing, and I was amazed
at how lucky I was getting people to  listen to me. I've been very lucky. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This next song is called 'Strange Phenomena' and it's all about the
coinsidences  that happen to all of us all of the time. Like maybe you're
listening to the radio and  a certain thing will come up, you go outside and it
will happen again. It's just how  similar things seem to attract together. Like
the saying 'Birds of a feather flock  together' and how these things do happen
to us all the time. Just strange  coincidences that we're only occasionally
aware of. And maybe you'll think how  strange that is, but it happens all the
time. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I hope you've enjoyed all the tracks we've been listening to.
It's been  great to be with you all - I hope that you're all well and happy.
They're the tracks  of my first album and I'm working on my second one at the
moment in france. I  hope you like that one too and maybe I'll come back again
sometime and tell you all  about that one.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Strange Phenomena&quot; is played.] 
</P>
<P>[there follows a number a short bits that are separate from the main
interview.  Probably there were to be used as shorts between songs on the radio
or as intros to  her songs when they were played...] 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is KaTe Bush speaking. On the whole, I listen to very few lady
singers. I  identify myself much more with male singers, especially male
songwriters. But the  people I really admire: Billie Holiday, she's in a right
of her own. David Bowie, I  think he's an incredible songwriter. Bryan Ferry I
think is an imnportant writer.  the other people I do listen a lot ot are Steely
Dan. And I think the main common  denominator for the people that I like are
that they are songwriters. They all seem  to be either male groups or male
single personalities who write their songs and sing  them. And I think this is
why I tend not to listen to females as much becasue the  few that do get this
together I don't find particularly interesting. Joni Mitchell  stands on her
own. I think Joan Armatrading too - she's special. But on the whole, I  think I
just identify more with male songwriters.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hi everyone - this is KaTe Bush. The things that I hope for the future
are that I  continue to write songs and sing and that they progress. That they
become more  purposeful - that they have a purpose there all the time. One of
the most important  things to me is that I expand as a human being. So really
any other sort of other  levels that would take me onto a different plane, I'm
welcome to if it's right. I'd  love to get into the film media sometime, but I
don't know if I as an actress can act.  I don't think I could. I don't know.
I'll just wait and see what comes and hope that  I can expand and grow.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- my fingers hurt. 
</P>
<P>- recall that this was recorded sometime in 1978 or so. keep this in mind
when  reading what she said. it's most interesting to compare it to what she
says now - or  how she acts now (especially with reference to paying attention
to her audience and  reacting to them...).

<BR> Subject: Re: TKI promo cassette 1978 
</P>
<P>first, upon more careful and closer listening and comparison to the original
 tracks, i must retract my earlier statement that the songs that appeared on the
 promotional cassette for tki i recently transcribed are alternative mixes. they
are not.  rather, the recordings of the songs are not particularly good - the
treble is much too  high and the bass much too low. this gives them a certain
quality that one does not  hear on the official releases that fooled my ears. i
also plead that i was not quite  awake the first time i hear the tape - it was
about 2 am in the morning. and you all  know how first impressions are...
