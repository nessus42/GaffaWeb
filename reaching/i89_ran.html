<P ALIGN="left">&quot;I'd like to think that some of the songs could be of some 
comfort if anyone's having a hardtime,&quot; says Kate Bush, whose new album, The 
Sensual World, is just out. &quot;Each song is a scenario in a way, a short story.&quot;<br>
It's been four years since Bush has released an album of new material - she did 
release a compilation album in 1986 - but it's been even longer since she's 
toured. &quot;My touring situation is a little unusual, to say the least,&quot; she says. 
&quot;I've only ever done one tour, and that was ten years ago, and since then I've 
only concentrated on albums. I much enjoyed the tour. But touring is just 
re-creating music that already exists.&quot;<br>
Perhaps because she doesn't tour, Bush, who's a major star in England, has never 
reached as broad an audience in the U.S. &quot;It doesn't really surprise me,&quot; she 
says. &quot;I've never seen making an album in terms of sweeping the market.&quot;<br>
