<P>Date: Mon, 20 Nov 89 16:32:02 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: AP telephone interview 
</P>
<P>            by Hillel Italie reprinted in Valley Herald Nov. 17 1989 
</P>
<P>There is an Associated Press telephone interview with Kate. It appeared
locally  last Friday (Nov. 17 89) in the Valley Herald a small newspaper serving
the  Livermore, Amador, and San Ramon Valleys. I never expected to see anything
about  Kate in *this* newspaper! I suppose the article must have appeared in
other places  as well. 
</P>
<P>I believe there are several errors in the article. I won't bother correcting
them,  but if anybody wants to, such as IED, be my guest. 
</P>
<P>In any case, here it is: 
</P>
<P>Getting past the myths surrounding Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>by Hillel Italie, Associated Press 
</P>
<P>Some myths about Kate Bush: 
</P>
<P>-- The four-year wait for her new album, &quot;Sensual World,&quot; was by
choice. 
</P>
<P>Bush, a perfectionist in the studio, says no. She did take a brief rest
after issuing the  popular greatest hits package, &quot;The Whole Story,&quot;
but said creating suitable  material caused the delay. She also changed labels,
from EMI to CBS. 
</P>
<P>-- She doesn't like to perform live. 
</P>
<P>Not so, the singer insists. This most visual of artists loves the stage, but
worries about  maintaining the intensity night after night of material such as &quot;Get
Out of my  House&quot; and &quot;Sat in Your Lap.&quot; That's why she hasn't
toured in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>-- Her favorite author is Emily Bronte. 
</P>
<P>Wrong again. Yes, the title and story of &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; a
No. 1 single in  England in 1978, were taken straight from the novel. But no,
Bush didn't like the  book and, in fact, hadn't seen the movie. 
</P>
<P>It is true, however, that the British star has a few things to say about
love, and a  few more about the, well, &quot;Sensual World.&quot; All that is no
surprise to anyone whose  ears have rung from her operatic passion on &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; or has gazed at  those penetrating brown eyes which glow from her
album covers. 
</P>
<P>So Bush fans won't be surprised that the title song of her new record more
than  lives up to its name. 
</P>
<P>A better story is how it came to be recorded. Originally, having composed an
 appropriately seductive track, Bush thought of James Joyce's erotic classic, &quot;Ulysses,&quot;
 and thought she had found the ideal lyrics. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The lyrics were taken straight from Molly Bloom's soliloquy,&quot; the
31-year-old  singer-songwriter siad in a telephone interview from London. &quot;The
words were so  rich, so intimate. It was like magic the way they fitted.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Joyce estate had no interest in hearing the author's
words set  to music. If Bush wanted to invoke &quot;Ulysses&quot;, she'd have to
start from scratch. She  did, cooing &quot;Mmh, yes,&quot; and murmuring images
of &quot;seedcades&quot; and &quot;arrows of love&quot;  while uilleann pipes
and an Irish bagpipe moaned in the background. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was disappointed,&quot; Bush admitted, &quot;and it was very
difficult. I wanted to keep  the original sense, but obviously I am not Joyce.
But with the rhythms I had it began  to turn into what the Molly Bloom character
is about. I was stepping out of the song  into the beauty [of] nature.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She calls her dreamlike songs &quot;short stories,&quot; and brings to them
a fiction  writer's fascination with legend and reality. That means imagining
heists with  Bogart and Cagney, summoning the spirit of Houdini and springing
from the head of  Zeus. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;Heads We're Dancing,&quot; a young girl meets a charming stranger
at a dance in  1939 and discovers she is conversing with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was thinking of the devil incarnate, the ultimate evil,&quot; she
said. &quot;It was inspired  by a friend of mine who had been to this dinner and
sat next to this guy and found  him absolutely fascinating, intelligent and
well-educated. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He asked the next day, 'Who was that?' and was told it was (atomic
bomb  developer) J. Robert Oppenheimer. My friend went back in horror. He said
he  would have behaved completely differently if he had realized who it was.&quot;

</P>
<P>Obsession, like Cathy for Heathcliff, drove Bush to make music. She played
piano  for hours as a child and was 15 when a friend introduced her to Pink
Floyd guitarist  David Gilmour. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He was looking for different acts and my friend said to him, 'Come and
have a  listen.' They came down and worked on a few songs with me. I couldn't
afford  anything like paying for a studio so Dave put up the money. We put three
tracks  down, two of those tracks went on the first album ('The Kick Inside').&quot;

</P>
<P>Go to a record store and you'll find her albums in the &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;rock&quot;
section,  between Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds. But neither of these 1960s
groups had a  singer with a four-octave soprano, or called a song &quot;Suspended
in Gaffa,&quot; or ever  used the Digeridu or Bouzouki. 
</P>
<P>Bush was inspired by British art rockers Peter Gabriel and Bryan Ferry
rather  than country and rhythm 'n' blues. Instead of getting her kicks from
electric guitar,  Bush fell in love with the Fairlight synthesizer, which she
began using on her third  album, &quot;Never for Ever.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I took one look at it and said, 'This is what I've been looking for
all my life.' I  couldn't believe the Fairlight. It's called a synthesizer, but
many of its sounds are of  natural source. To be able to play with strings,
waterfalls, anything you want, it's  wonderful. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was just like opening this great door for me, a complete
revolution. It meant I  no longer felt a need to write on the piano and fill it
out with synthesizers.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush talks of colors, moods. There's the anger of &quot;Between a Man and a 
Woman,&quot; the loss of innocence of &quot;The Fog,&quot; the dry wit of &quot;Running
Up That Hill  (a Deal With God).&quot; 
</P>
<P>She also writes of lying awake at night, worrying about love, in &quot;The
Man With  the Child in His Eyes,&quot; and being brought to tears by a bad dream
in &quot;Cloudbusting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;All of us tend to live in our heads. In 'Cloudbusting,' the idea was
of starting  this song with a person waking up from this dream, 'I wake up
crying.' It's like  setting a scene that immediately suggests to you that this
person is no longer with  someone they dearly love,&quot; she said. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It puts a pungent note on the song. Life is a loss, isn't it? It's
learning to cope  with loss. I think in a lot of ways, that's what all of us
have to cope with.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There's also an old picture of Kate from the Hounds Of Love promotion days
(the  one with Kate wearing the hat), and the caption reads: &quot;Kate Bush
draws on a more  varied background than pop and country music.&quot;
