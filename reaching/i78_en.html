<P>Evening News Interview by John Blake, February 18, 1978. 
</P>
<P>Sexy Kate sings like an angel 
</P>
<P>by John Blake 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was a wistful, wide-eyed 14 year-old schoolgirl when she first
realised  she was destined to become a star. 
</P>
<P>By the time she was 16, EMI Records had released it too and they advanced
her  L3,000 to live on while she developed her prodigious song-writing and
singing  talents.
</P>
<P>Now, at 19, her first record - a plaintive, tormented song, &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; -  has just been released.
</P>
<P>The record has jumped into the top twenty and I'll be astonished if it
doesn't  make No. 1 by the middle of next month.
</P>
<P>Yet the song is merely the tip of a whole iceberg of talent.
</P>
<P>And, having listened to Kate's album, The Kick Inside, and been charmed by
her  company I'm convinced she is the most important girl singer to have emerged
in  Britain for at least ten years. 
</P>
<P>SEXUAL
</P>
<P>She's beautiful too and very sexy - al huge brown eyes and long, tangled
auburn  hair.
</P>
<P>&quot;But I'm not going to fall into the trap of doing the whole female
thing, being a  sex object,&quot; she says.
</P>
<P>&quot;I think a lot of woman are conditioned to want to look like that when
they are  young.
</P>
<P>&quot;But it's so dangerous to come on all sexual because straightaway you
are label as  a woman instead of an artist.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm very interested, though, in people's emotions and their
relationships. I'm  intrigued by the way women use their power over men.
</P>
<P>&quot;They can use their bodies and they can use the obviously sexual way to
get  through but I just think that's wrong.
</P>
<P>&quot;That's relying on something that is fading and something that is
purely material  anyway - it's not really anything.&quot;
</P>
<P>Kate's fascination with relationships prompted her to write &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;.
</P>
<P>It is a strange, almost mystical song which is based around the part of the
novel  by Emily Bronte where Cathy wants to take Heathcliffe's soul so they can
be  together in the spiritual world.
</P>
<P>&quot;I developed a kind of fascination with Cathy after I saw the last 10
minutes of  the television series where she was at the window and cutting
herself with the glass.  It always stuck in my brain.
</P>
<P>&quot;It was probably a lot to do with the fact that her name was Cathy -
and I was  always called that as a child.
</P>
<P>&quot;My feeling about it was so strong that it kept coming back to me again
and again.
</P>
<P>&quot;Then I read the book and discovered that Emily Bronte had her birthday
on the  same day as me, July 30, and I really, really wanted to write a song
about it all.&quot;
</P>
<P>She is the daughter of a general practitioner and was brought up in a 
middle-class home at Plumbstead, in Kent.
</P>
<P>&quot;I have two older brothers and they were both very keen on musical
instruments  so I just grew up with music all around me,&quot; she says.
</P>
<P>&quot;When I was about 11 I just started poking around at the piano and
started  making up little songs.
</P>
<P>&quot;It was just an easy way to release all the energy I felt inside me. I
never played  Beatle songs or anything like. I was always just exploring the
instrument.
</P>
<P>&quot;Then, when I was 14, I started taking it seriously and i began to
treat the words  to the songs as poetry. I'd always been keen on poetry at
school and it was lovely to  put the poems together with the music.&quot;
</P>
<P>Her brothers were astute enough to realise that here's was a quite
exceptional  talent - but no record companies were interested when they were
offered tapes of  little Kate singing and playing the piano.
</P>
<P>Eventually, via a friend of a friend, Dave Gilmour, Pink Floyd's millionaire
 guitarist, came to hear about this strange little girl who sang like an angel.
</P>
<P>&quot;I was really nervous about meeting Dave but he was so nice and kind,&quot;
she says.
</P>
<P>&quot;He told me to go into a studio to make a finished demo tape and then
to select  the three best songs and to offer them to a record company.
</P>
<P>&quot;Dave took me into AIR London studios and put up the money for
everything. It  must have cost a fortune but he didn't want to get anything out
of it.
</P>
<P>&quot;He's done the same sort of things with a couple of bands. He just
discovers them  and tries to help them. Since then he's always kept in touch and
made sure  everything is going OK.&quot;
</P>
<P>EMI jumped at the chance of signing Kate up when they heard the tape.
</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; she says, &quot;I was only just 16 and then and - though
everyone had been  telling me for a couple of years I was going to be a star I
wasn't really capable of  handling it. I needed time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>GIGGLES
</P>
<P>So, spared from the drudgery of having to work by EMI's generous advance, 
Kate first studied mime under Lindsay Kemp - David Bowie's old tutor, then moved
 on to work at the Dance Centre, in Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't believe how hopeless I was,&quot; she giggles.
</P>
<P>&quot;I went on thinking: 'Oh well I'll have this off in a week.' But after
a year I  realised that I didn't know anything - ten years and I might just be
starting to get  good. It really is so very difficult.&quot;
</P>
<P>During this period she moved from her parents' home to a flat in a house
owned  by her father in Lewisham.
</P>
<P>&quot;It was good for me to be independent,&quot; she says.
</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't leave home because we were having home troubles. I did it
because I  wanted to maybe grow up a bit, to find out about the world - to be
myself and not  have the influence of my parents all the time.
</P>
<P>&quot;In fact my father owning the flat is a great situation because both my
brothers  have flats below me and they are always there when I need them.&quot;
</P>
<P>She composes now on a honky-tonk piano she bought from a second-hand show 
in Woolwich.
</P>
<P>&quot;I feel as though I've built up a real relationship with the piano,&quot;
she says. &quot;It's  almost like a person. Like, it's really comforting just to
sit down and play it.
</P>
<P>&quot;And the piano almost dictates what my songs will be about.
</P>
<P>&quot;If I haven't got a particular idea I just sit down and play chords and
then the  chords almost dictate what the song should be about because they have
their own  moods.
</P>
<P>&quot;Like a minor chord is very likely to tell me something sad. A major
chord tells  me something a little more up-tempo and, like, on a more positive
level of thinking.
</P>
<P>&quot;If I ever made enough money I'd like to get a piano that sings: a
great big  singing beast like a Steinway.&quot;
</P>
<P>On stage, though, Kate is very aware of the need to have a band with her and
is  busy lining one up. One dead cert member will be her 25-year-old brother
Paddy -  who plays mandolin on her album.
</P>
<P>Though her name is cause a huge stir in the music business -with such 
luminaries as Steve Harley and Dusty Springfield constantly singing her praises
- she  still has no manager.
</P>
<P>&quot;I know so many people who have almost been destroyed by having amateur
 managers chained around their necks.
</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't afford to have someone to tie me down like that. And not
having a  manager has been great because I have been able to personally deal
with people and  so I have learned a lot about the business side.
</P>
<P>&quot;I've had quite a few offers recently from people who want to manage me
- but  I'm thinking it all over very carefully before I make my decision.
</P>
<P>Not merely a beautiful young lady, but a clever one too. Surely an
unbeatable  combination.
