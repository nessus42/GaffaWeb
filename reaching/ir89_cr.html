<P>Hello again, all Love-Hounds everywhere! 
</P>
<P>On my local commercial radio startion (Capital Radio), there was an
interview  with Kate herself. Considering there are a LOT of people out there
who don't listen  to this station, I thought that I'd post a transcript of it.
It was actually on the air  about a week and a half ago, but with holidays and
the time it took me to transcribe  it...anyway there was some interesting stuff
on it. All the attempts at punctuation are  mine - but bear in mind before you
flame me that it was off the radio. 
</P>
<P>Oh well, read it and mentally digest...... --John 
</P>
<P>Announcer: ...but in the last four years since the &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
album, Kate  Bush has been working on a new album - &quot;The Sensual World&quot;.
David Jensen  was given a rare opportunity to catch up with her in her North
London Home. 
</P>
<P>KT: It's not a pleasant experience for me the fact that it takes so long,
but I can't  do anything about it. So much work just seems to go into it for me
until it is  finished. I just had to keep taking breaks, so I'd take maybe six
months off  rather than just a couple of weeks, just to get away from it. 
</P>
<P>DJ: Why did you call the album &quot;The Sensual World&quot;? 
</P>
<P>KT: An album title is a very difficult thing. It's got to say, hopefully,
something  about the mood of the album, but also be an interesting enough phrase
or title to  catch people's attention - and that felt about the best one,
really, to call the  album. 
</P>
<P>DJ: Church bells signal the start of &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. What
gave you the  inspiration for that? 
</P>
<P>KT: The original words for this song were taken from Molly Bloom's speech at
the  end of &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce, and I couldn't get permission to
use the words.  The original words were all about going back to a time when her
husband  proposed to her, and so the wedding bells were like the start of the
whole song. 
</P>
<P>DJ: Your songs on this album are complex, aren't they? Unlike previously, I
mean  when you started out; it's easy to remember, it seems like yesterday when
&quot;The  Kick Inside&quot; came out, and the songs were more straightforward.
But with each  successive album you've become more, I guess &quot;progressive&quot;
or you've been  more adventurous. Is that something deliberately that you're
doing, or is it just a  consequence of growing with your music? 
</P>
<P>KT: I don't know. I mean, I think really that art should become simpler
rather than  more complicated; and in a lot of ways it worries me that I think
this album is  quite a complex thing, and I think that most people will have to
listen to it  DEFINITELY more than twice just to maybe even get a sense of it.
That's hard  for me to understand, because I just don't HEAR it like that, and
ideally I would  like the music to be an easy experience. But I think people's
music is a reflection  of that person; and in the same way that it takes me such
a long time to make an  album, I think it's all a process of me growing and
that's just the way I am. 
</P>
<P>DJ: After four years, are you apprehensive about how it willl be recieved,
or are you  pretty confident? 
</P>
<P>KT: At the moment, I feel like I'm about to be hung. You know - will I get
off, or  will I be hung?
