<p>This is an article for the Canadian magazine &quot;Music Express&quot; or &quot;ME&quot; Jan. '90 
</p>



<p> The front cover has a small picture of Kate that is nothing short of amazing. It is 
a vertical oval about 4&quot; high, with the word &quot;BUSHWACKED&quot; beside it. In it, Kate is 
standing facing slightly to her right, her right arm across her stomach, her right 
hand under her left elbow, her left hand held just below her throat. She's wearing a 
midnight blue, crushed velvet, off-the-shoulder dress. It looks antique. She is 
wearing one gold hoop earring. She is looking up and to her left, head tilted slightly 
back and to her left. The picture is very bluish, I don't know if it's lighting or 
tinting, probably both. The only non-blue elements in the composition are her lips 
and the earring. It is one of the most beautiful photos Vickie and I have ever seen of 
Kate, It's just to small.

<p>Woman's Work 
</p>

<p>by Mary Dickie 
</p>



<p>[There are two intro pieces; the first, over the byline on the facing page is; ]
</p>

<p> Gender confusion has never been an issue in the reclusive Kate Bush's elegant, 
lush, evocative music, but the diminutive diva sees her new album, The Sensual 
World, as her most &quot;female&quot; work yet. 
</p>

<p>[The second in the first column of the right hand page is; ]
</p>

<p> This story begins with the ringing of a telephone - a special line set up as a 
promo gimmick. as it connects, a tiny, perfect English voice says, &quot;Hello, this is Kate 
Bush, and this is The Sensual World&quot;. There follows several minutes of tinkling 
music that sounds half Irish and half Middle Eastern, accompanying some murmers 
from that unmistakable voice. Apparently, after an absence of four long years, Kate 
Bush is back in the limelight. 
</p>



<p> What does that mean to the music world? Well, a lot to some people and not 
much to others, because Kate Bush is the kind of performer that receives extremely 
polarized reactions (it's been said that her voice is either Minnie Mouse or the 
Heavenly Host, depending on the listener). Ever since The Kick Inside - a collection 
of airy songs that stood in marked contrast to the punk and new wave then 
dominating the scene - came out when she was 19, Kate has built up a following that 
includes some of the most devoted fans anywhere, while a large segment of the 
record-buying public remains immune to her charms. 
</p>

<p>That disparity is partly geographical - although Kate's albums routinely top the 
British charts, she's always had a harder time in North America, where she enjoys 
little more than cult status. But for every person who moans and groans and rolls 
their eyes at the sound of Kate's unusual, eerie melodies and breathy voice, there's 
at least one who has found some kind of personal salvation in her deliberately 
enigmatic and mystical story-poems, her dance-y videos and her otherworldly 
singing style. 
</p>

<p>Kate herself seems to have no problem with that diversity of reactions. &quot;It's 
impossible for me to know how other people hear my music,&quot; she says. &quot;I think the 
wonderful thing about art is that it's all down to the receiver as to whether they 
like it or not, what they see in it, how they feel about it. It's a totally personal 
relationship between that piece of work and that person, and a really special thing. I 
just continually think how extraordinary it is, really, that people do want to hear my 
stuff, especially when I take so long to make records, you know.&quot; 
</p>

<p>And Kate does take a long time to make records. The Sensual World has been 
four years in the making, and now that it's finished she'll admit to a few qualms 
about how it's going to go over. &quot;I spend a lot of my time away from everything, in 
the studio, and I don't know if people are going to like it or not,&quot; she says. &quot;The 
more time it takes to make, the more you think, 'Oh, my God, they're just not 
going to think it's worth having spent all that time on!&quot; 
</p>

<p>Well, there's no question that people want to hear her stuff, and a consid-erable 
number think it's well worth waiting for. In fact, for those of us who have some 
how remained unaware of the impact Kate has had on some people's lives, the 
amount of adulation she receives from her fans and the dizzing heights to which they 
raise her are astounding. For example, a copy of Breakthrough, a {defunct} Kate 
fanzine, includes sprited discussions of Issues Kate has raised in her work, drawings, 
elaborate personal interpre-tations of songs, and a quiz which includes provocative 
questions like: &quot;What are Kate's thoughts on revenge?&quot; and &quot;What is Kate's own 
explanation of the meaning of Sat In Your Lap ?&quot; There's even detailed advice on 
vegatar-ianism, for those who want to go the full nine yards in their Bush emulation. 
</p>

<p>But now that The Sensual World is finished, it's time for Kate to emerge to face 
the public, or at least a few journalists. Kate dosen't like flying, so interviews have 
to be done on her home turf in Kent, England - round-table style, with groups of six 
writers sharing 15 precious minutes with her. Meanwhile, the record company has 
held back copies of The Sensual World &quot;so as not to diminish the impact&quot; of the first 
hearing at the listening party that's been scheduled prior to the interviews. It's 
hard not to get the initial impression that Kate is some sort of rare and fragile bird, 
protected by and coddled by her record company, her management and her 
boyfriend/engineer, Del Palmer, who hovers around the edge of the room 
throughout the marathon session. 
</p>

<p>But nothing could be further from the truth. In spite of being very ( very ) small, 
Kate is no delicate flower; she's a woman who, from the beginning, has taken an 
unusual amouny of control over the direction of her career. Kate has been writing 
songs since she was a child, but she got her big break at 16, when Pink Floyd's David 
Gilmour helped her record a three-track demo that got her signed to EMI. Then, 
after The Kick Inside and it's single Wuthering Heights, shot up the British charts 
in 1978, there was pressure on her to churn out another LP, and Lionheart came out 
the next year. However, with each successive album - Never For Ever in 1980, The 
Dreaming in 1982, Hounds Of Love in 1985 and now The Sensual World - Kate has 
taken progressively more time to work on the songs, and also expanded her control 
over things, learning production techniques, directing her videos and gradually 
upgrading her recording studio to professional levels. 
</p>

<p>Now Kate may be part of the record industry, but she can insist on doing it her 
own way. That means minimal publicity and contact with the public, and no touring 
(although she continually toys with the idea). It also means keeping things close to 
home and in the family - one brother is in her band, another is her legal advisor and 
photographer, her father contributes a vocal to the new album, and her mother runs 
the fan club. 
</p>

<p>Most importantly, it means that she can work in a style that, even by the lenient 
standards of the music industry, could be called idiosyncratic, even eccentric. Kate 
writes and produces her albums for the most part by herself, painstakingly working 
in her own studio with just her boyfriend to help her record them. That's why they 
take so long to appear. 
</p>

<p>As Kate explains, that method of working is necessary to get the results she's 
looking for, and has a direct influence on the finished product. &quot;I feel in many ways 
that The Sensual World is my most personal album, and I think a lot of that's 
directly to do with the way we worked on it,&quot; she says. &quot;I think that having just the 
two of us in the studio, being very isolated, has made it much easier for me to get 
things across, because I'm dealing with someone who knows what I'm trying to 
say, rather than three or four people who keep changing. The problem with 
commercial studios is that there are so many distractions and strangers, which makes 
me nervous. To be at home and be so relaxed, working with someone I know and 
love so much, gives it a very intimate and special feeling. It's not always easy, but I 
wouldn't have it any other way.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate also says she frequently has to get completely away from the studio, and even 
from the songs themselves. &quot;That's really because after intense periods of work, I'd 
feel I couldn't go any further,&quot; she says. &quot;Sometimes I'd just be so bored by the 
songs that I wanted to take a break - I was so sick of listening to them and not being 
able to get anywhere with them. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Also, I need to take breaks to write lyrics, which I find impossible to do - so 
difficult. It's just a very long process of draft after draft, continually trying to tighten 
up the words. 
</p>

<p>&quot;There were also periods on this album when I just couldn't write,&quot; she 
continues. &quot;I found it very difficult to know what I wanted to say, and I kept sort of 
hitting this block. So I took breaks, and that was all I needed. I spent time at home, 
did gardening - very earthy sorts of things. Things I really needed, because you 
know all my work was coming through my head.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The Sensual World is, according to Kate, something of a departure of her in that 
besides being her most personal, it's also her most &quot;female&quot; album. What does she 
mean by that? 
</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm not sure what I mean, except that's how it feels to me,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I 
suppose what I'm trying to say is that some of the songs feel like I'm writing them 
as a female, which is not necessarily something I've felt strongly before. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I think people tend to presume that when you are female you write from a 
female point of view, but I'm not sure I always have, really. A lot of my songs have 
been written from a man's point of view, or a child's point of view - I've never 
necessarily felt like a female writer. In fact, I think in the past I've very much 
enjoyed not writing as a female. It's kind of like writing stories - you don't really 
want to be yourself; you want to put yourself into other situations that are much 
more interesting.&quot; 
</p>

<p>This time, however, Kate's into the &quot;positive female energy&quot; thing. The song The 
Sensual World, for example, was inspired by the famous monologue at the end of 
James Joyce's Ulysses by Molly Bloom (amusingly misidentified as &quot;Wally Blue&quot; in 
the press information). But more than that, it's the sound of the album that makes it 
different. 
</p>

<p>As Kate explains, &quot;Although Hounds Of Love was definitly a female work of art, 
from a sound point of view I wanted to get the sense of power I associate with male 
music - strong rhythms, big drum sounds, very sort of male energy sounds. But I just 
didn't necessarily want to go for that anymore.&quot; 
</p>

<p>But if big drums are male energy sounds, what are female energy sounds? &quot;Well, 
I think that unfortunatly most female sounds in rock music are dissipated by male 
sounds, because generally it's the males who are producing and playing the 
insturments,&quot; she says. &quot;So I'm not sure there is a strong female sound in 
contemporary music. There is in ethnic music, though. Now the Bulgarian singers 
[The Bulgarian State Choir and Orchestra, an all-female choir whose haunting 
Mystere Des Voix Bulgare album and tour took music lovers by storm last year] - 
that's very much female music, from a strong female point of view. I think it has a 
tremendous intensity because of that, and it's very unusual for us to hear that kind 
of positive female strength, which you don't really find in contemporary music.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate found herself so inspired by the Bulgarian singers that she wound up using 
three of them, the Trio Bulgarka, to contribute vocals to three songs on The Sensual 
World. The interweaving of the Bulgarian voices with Kate's is particuarly startling 
on Rocket's Tale, which she wrote with the trio in mind (and which, in spite of its 
rarefied sound, turns out to be named for her cat ). But the singing of these women 
(Yanka Rupkhina, Eva Georgieva and Stoyanka Boneva) seems to have had a lasting 
impact on Kate, as well as setting the tone for the whole album. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The first time I heard them sing was just after we finished the last album,&quot; she 
says. &quot;My brother Paddy, who listens to a lot of ethnic music, heard them on Radio 
Sofia, and he played me a tape. And I could not believe it. It was just devastating, as 
it is for everyone the first time they hear it. It's like angels, isn't it? And when I 
was thinking about making another album, I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if 
perhaps we could work try working together!' That was scary for me, because their 
music is so good - you don't want to drag them down to your level, you know? I 
mean, funky Bulgarians would be just terrible!&quot; 
</p>

<p>In any case, Kate eventually made the trip to Sofia, Bulgaria, to meet the singers, 
and rehearsed with them for three days. As she says, &quot;It was just incredible - some 
of the purest musical communication I've ever had, and we didn't have any other 
language in common, because they don't speak English and I don't speak 
Bulgarian!&quot; 
</p>

<p>Besides Bulgarian singers, books - which have been a continuing source of 
inspiration ever since Wuthering Heights - and cats, what else inspires Kate to write 
songs? 
</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think relationships are probably what continually entice me, as well as 
films and books,&quot; she says. &quot;And conversations with people. They're all very much 
inspirational things. Just ideas, and things people might have said that sparked 
something. 
</p>

<p>&quot;But it's interesting how most of these things originated long ago, and maybe four 
or five years later they're regurgitated into an idea,&quot; she continues. &quot;Like 
Cloudbusting [on the Hounds Of Love LP) - that was originally from a book I read 
nine years before I wrote the song! It struck me very deeply, but it took a long time 
to step back enough to write the song, because it was a very powerful experience 
for me. I think sometimes the more powerful something is, the more you're scared 
of it. You're a bit wrapped up in it, and it takes time to move back, to perhaps see 
how you could look at it differently.&quot; 
</p>

<p>One song, This Woman's Work was inspired by, of all things, a John Hughes 
movie - She's Having A Baby. Says Kate: &quot;It's a light film, very comic, about a 
young guy whose wife gets pregnant, and everything remains light until they get to 
the hospital, and suddenly she's rushed away and he's left sitting there. You get the 
impression that this is the moment when he has to start growing up. Up until then 
he's been a kid, and very happily so. It's a lovely piece of film, and in some ways 
it's an exploration of guilt, I guess. 
</p>

<p>And now for the age-old question, the one that Kate doesn't like: what about 
touring? Kate has done only one tour in her career, way back in 1979, and though 
she said she enjoyed it, it looks as though she won't do it again. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Why do people still ask me if I'm going to tour?&quot; she say's, incredulously. &quot;I 
haven't toured in ten years! I mean it's absolutely ridiculous!&quot; Perhaps it's because 
she hedges so much about it, never quite coming out and saying that she'll never do 
it again. 
</p>

<p>&quot;A lot of people of people think I hated touring, and that's why I haven't done it 
again,&quot; she acknowledges. &quot;But actually I really enjoyed it. Sometimes I think I would 
like to, but I guess I'm scared of commiting myself to something like that again. I 
found it very tiring, and it was really difficult for me to do anything for a very long 
time afterwards...&quot; 
</p>

<p>As everyone who's seen Kate's videos knows, she definitely has an interest in 
the theatrical, and her live show was reportedly full of stage antics and special 
effects. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I was very much influenced by dance and theatre at the time, and I really 
wanted to do something special with the show,&quot; she explains. &quot;But recently, 
especially over these past two albums, it's been very important for me to spend time 
being a songwriter. I didn't want to be a performer. I didn't feel like a performer, 
and I didn't want to be exposed to all that it entails. I wanted to spend some tome 
alone at home and just be a songwriter and not be out there in front of everyone. I 
feel very exposed, doing that.&quot; 
</p>

<p>What about other people's music? Does she listen to records? 
</p>

<p>&quot;I tend not to listen to music too much when I'm working on an album,&quot; she says, 
adding, &quot;it's so intense that when I get home I like to watch things instead. But in 
between I like to listen. Right now I'm listening to the new John Lydon album, 
which is fantastic! It's really good!&quot; 
</p>

<p>Although she will admit to missing audience contact, Kate has a large and steady 
following and can afford to remain in her Kent cocoon, insulated from and even 
unaware of trends in music - even if she did happen to hit upon one with the 
Bulgarian choir. 
</p>

<p>&quot;If I was trying to be hip, I wouldn't stand much of a chance,&quot; she laughs. 
&quot;Because by the time my record came out, four or five years later, it would be so 
passe! I'd have to leave it for 10 years, so that it would have time to come around 
again!&quot; 
</p>

<p>------------------
</p>



<p>There are three pictures in the article, the first is the picture in which she's 
wearing blue jeans and a white blouse, is kneeling and is barefoot. In the second she 
is wearing a yellow blouse with a black grid pattern, a grey scarf and black pants. 
She's holding, with her left hand, what looks like an electric mandolin. In the third 
she is on her left knee with her right elbow resting on her right knee. Her hair is 
pulled over her right shoulder. She's facing her right and looking to her upper left. 
She is wearing what appears to be black velvet, I can't tell much due to this damn 
newsprint.
