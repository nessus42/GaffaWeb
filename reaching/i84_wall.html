<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A converted Mick Wall explores the (dream) world of Kate Bush
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It was a night, cool and replete, like any other night. I was bedded down in
my fox-hole, my day-ticket all turned in and chewed over, gliding on a cushion
of ozone into the calmer tonic waters of sleep release. In the distance...a
sound. 
</P>
<P>Darkness surrounded me in opaque chiffon veils which were lifting casually,
layer after layer, from the sweet night ground scented with earth beneath my
bare feet. 
</P>
<P>Oh yes, now I could see; I was standing in a square by a gate. Before me,
its menacing grey spires cutting deep incisions into the intestinal sac of the
night sky, was an unlit church. I stood transfixed before the altar of my own
confusion for an uncertain length of time, listening all the while for the
sound, mellifluous in its steadily increasing velocity. 
</P>
<P>Suddenly, the heavy oak doors of the church swung open and a regiment of
children carrying ochre candles aloft moved with their own dancing light into
twilight view, humming and cooing the ancient songs of their fathers, heretical
choruses all. Breath left me in translucent plasmic gasps. Time stopped. 
</P>
<P>In the centre of these columns of glittering child-light stood a woman. She
was quite, quite breathtakingly beautiful. Her face a constellation of feline
expression, ancient hieroglyphic image, a saucerful of secrets. The woman,
accompanied by her honour guard of tiny laughing folk, moved elegantly up the
footpath from the church doors, past where I was standing agape, and forward
into the dark velvet forest that trimmed the hills to the North. She was
singing. It sounded like:      &quot;Ninny ninny nacky poo, nacky poo, nacky
poo. . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>And it moved me in a way no other singing voice could; it was a delicious,
indulgent moment of unspoilt pleasure, a caress that tickled me behind the ears
and laid one finger on my groin. My heart was an open wound which would never
heal. 
</P>
<P>With the urgent balletic step of one who is possessed, I ran to join the mad
procession of twinkling human light, ascending the slopes of impossible desire,
praying for the Autumnal Heavens to spill with naked gifts. And all the while
the woman sang... 
</P>
<P>Ineffably spellbound, I followed the voice...the face...the slender moment.
And thus it would have remained had not the inexplicably cruel hand of fate
touched my shoulder. A second more and I would surely have been lost for
eternity, left to walk the oatmeal carpet of stars that connects this world
with...another. Instead... 
</P>
<P>I woke up! 
</P>
<P>Well, well, only a dream and nothing more. So some might say, but I know
better. The realm of dreams is the ultimate reality and one you would be wrong
not to take seriously. It cuts time to ribbons, scuffs it up and sends it
rolling into the open sewer, and it tells of the future and of the past, and it
speaks in tongues of that most inexplicable of all puzzles-- the now! 
</P>
<P>I wasn't dreaming of Kate Bush so much as wandering through the white Winter
world of her songs. Sleigh-bells and wasteladen trains in a merry Easter march,
with night and his army approaching...slowly. Kate Bush tells me that: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm very influenced in my writing by old traditional folk songs,
handed down by new generations of musicians but with the original atmosphere and
emotion still maintained. The sort of music my mother, who's Irish, would have
listened to and danced to, and used to play for me when I was very little. It's
probably my biggest musical influence; I really like that feeling folk music
has--classical music, too--that timeless feeling you experience from the joy of
just playing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush has an astonishing talent for writing songs and an unmistakable
singing voice, unique in its intensity and pitch. Her dancing is a more recent
acquisition. Though her mother was a prize-winning dancer, Kate began taking
classes as late as her seventeenth year, a little over twelve months before her
first ever single release, Wuthering Heights, reached number one in the UK
charts. 
</P>
<P>She is also the star of a dozen or more lavishly produced videos, the allure
of which continues to titillate the jaundiced palate of TV audiences the world
over. In their glamorous wake has come a chain of film and TV offers which up
till now she has consistently declined. 
</P>
<P>All of which affords the lady a globe-wide reputation as one of the
classiest, most outstandingly talented (not forgetting most successful) female
pop performers of the last six years. 
</P>
<P>Simply, she's the best! 
</P>
<P>Mind you, and I'll be perfectly straight here, I only discovered the truth
gradually. By stages. Three, to be precise... 
</P>
<P>I'd been writing for Sounds for about three months, off and on, when one day
a call comes through. The voice says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;You are reviewing the singles this week.&quot; Just like that. And me,
the tail-wagging, keen as a witch's breath asshole I was in those days, I said,
&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; Just that. 
</P>
<P>I started playing the first of the 250 or so singles that had been released
that week at about eight o'clock in the evening, scribbling down notes and silly
bits and pieces like that. By four the next morning I had about 40 left to go
and I was panicking, so wiped out with boredom I was beginning to hallucinate an
early suicide. It was then that I spotted a single in a full colour pic
sleeve--a luxury for an unknown artiste even today--called Wuthering Heights. A
woman, vaguely oriental in appearance, posed erotically on the cover. For a
second, I thought this one might even be good, or at least a bit good. I played
it... 
</P>
<P>I still shudder at the memory of the occasion! I hated it. The sinister
attack of the opening vocal lines carved my senses into lead shavings all over
the floor. Do you know pain? Well, that's what it was for me, that first time. 
</P>
<P>I pasted the record with a virulent vitriol refined into an almighty sneer,
pronouncing it dead from the neck up. Three weeks later it was number one in the
charts. 
</P>
<P>Stage two commenced with the release of &quot;Man With The Child in His Eyes&quot;,
taken from her first album, The Kick Inside. That whole album, but more
particularly the second single, opened my eyes wide to the remote hinterlands of
youthful imagination and populist conceit that must surely make up a large part
of the artistic nature of the author of such a sweetly motivated pop single. It
also finally rid me of those stinking prejudices I'd had about he voice. She
sang like an angel...the woman with the child in her voice. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush wrote her second hit single when she was fourteen. 
</P>
<P>The last stage began when I was invited by a friend to go and see Kate Bush
on her first tour. She was appearing at the London Palladium. Live! Oh, what a
night! An evening drawn in exotic inks across the canvas of my mind, an illicit
confection of sensations. 
</P>
<P>On a totally professional level, the lights, the complex choreography made
to appear simple and careless, the dancing flesh, evoked an atmosphere that
oozed pleasure, that reeked of shameless beautiful entertainment enjoyed from
both sides of the footlights. Indeed, when I remind Kate Bush of that night I
forget for a moment that she was the bearer of such insouciant warmth and I
merely the receiver. We speak of our (shared) memories of the occasion with so
obvious and touching a mutual delight you would swear we had gone to the show
together, sat next to each other in the stalls... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I got so incredibly nervous before I'd go on,&quot; she admits. &quot;All
I'd ever really done in the way of live performance before the tour were things
like TV shows, and videos. I'd never done a big tour...and the sort of props and
ideas for the show we were carrying around with us seemed a bit ambitious, a bit
awesome, at first, but I loved those shows. Once I was onstage I had so much
fun. I'd like to do more of it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>From there on in, Doc, I was hooked. And my habit keeps creeping up, getting
bigger all the time. 
</P>
<P>Her last album, The Dreaming, is her best, to quote a cliche. Self-produced,
self-written songs, she even picks the ideas for the sleeve graphics, and that's
before she sits down to think about what she wants to do with the new
video...damn, I don't mean this to be a love letter, I jes wanna wake y'all up
to whas-happ'ning. 
</P>
<P>Own up, you lather over the videos, right? Something in your head says &quot;swim&quot;
when you hear her on the radio, yes? Then follow me down to Kate dance studio
where she's sitting cross-legged on the floor, bundled up in wool against the
icy January breath of Jack Frost, a tray of tea and biscuits laid in neo-Chinese
ceremonial fashion between us, your arse and mine parked on the only cushion
available, and we'll smoulder away the chill afternoon together... 
</P>
<P>Before you studied dance did you ever feel you might have a natural aptitude
for dancing, performing? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. Never. Within the first two weeks of trying--I went to this dance
school up in London where, you know, you can just go along part-time--I thought,
there's no way I can do this, this is just ridiculous, I'm useless and it's
going to take me years and years...I'd really thought that after about a year
I'd be a really great dancer. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But I got hooked and started going up to London every day. Suddenly, I
became a human being--just learning to move!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you employ a choreographer? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. The only time I've ever used one really was on the tour, though it
can be almost impossible to work at dancing by yourself, you need a teacher.
When I'm working on my classes I tend to go up to London because my teacher
can't travel. She's too busy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In another life, could you have made a career out of dancing? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know. There was a time, when I'd been dancing for about a year
and a half, and I was never really sure if an album was going to manifest
itself, that I thought, if you want to be a dancer you should do it now. Because
I had people approaching me at the dance class, asking if I wanted to go to
Germany and dance in clubs and things, and for a time I really got into the
dance thing much more seriously than I thought I would. But I don't thin I was
good enough. I didn't stand out enough.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you write all the time? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. I have to be right [?--Words unclear.] for an an album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You're not very prolific then? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I used to be. I used to write every day and if it wasn't very good
keep a little bit and maybe use it in something else. As soon as 'Wuthering
Heights' became a hit, though, my whole routine was just blown apart, it was
extraordinary how suddenly everything changed. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I had such a routine going. It was like, get up, play the piano, go
dancing, come back, play the piano, write songs all night, then go to bed. It
was like that every day.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Were you very happy then? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I was. I think it was one of the happiest times for me as a
person. I'd just left school and I was beginning to find myself as an
individual. It was very exciting, but I wanted more than anything in the world
to make an album, just to see that piece of plastic. And then it happened, and
it was instant, you know, Round the World in 80 Days sort of thing. It's
frightening. I don't know how I did it. I couldn't do it now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you come from a particularly artistic family? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my mother's a dancer, she won a lot of prizes cleaning the floor
with the opposition, and my father's a musician.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I know your family are involved in your business, but were they behind you
when you signed to EMI at sixteen? Did they freak out? Sex and drugs and writers
etc... 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, not at all. They had seen it coming for a long time. The original
idea was to see if we could sell my songs to a publisher, not that I should be a
singer or a performer or anything. We had quite modest, curious aims. So it was
gradual and they were always supportive.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Did you ever have singing lessons? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Did your teacher try to get you to sing in a lower voice? (Stupid joke).
[This was Wall's own comment.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, not at all. I used to go for about half-an-hour a week and the guy
would get me to practice my scales and my breathing or something and then ask to
hear my new songs. So I'd sing them for him and he helped me more that way. He
was really good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you get self-conscious when you're making a video? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I get very nervous before I do anything. I feel I have to work at
songs for days before I start to produce anything interesting. Before I perform,
I'm always worried that we didn't spend enough time getting this or that
together. 
</P>
<P>You never cover other people's material. Why? Don't you see yourself as The
Interpretive Singer? A touch of the 'Rod Stewarts'? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Actually, I love singing great songs written by other people, it can
be fun discovering how beautiful some composers' work is. But I've felt happy
recording my own numbers. I regard myself primarily as a songwriter and I don't
want to cop out of writing. I get guilty enough as it is when I'm writing for
lengths of time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush and I carry on talking while the sun goes down behind my back. We
talk and she tells me she is currently writing songs for a new album scheduled
for the autumn. How appropriate, thought I. Do you like the winter? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I like all the seasons. They each have something to bring,&quot; she
replies enigmatically. God, this is getting wistful! 
</P>
<P>She tells me that she hennas her hair, crimps it occasionally, and that she
has make-up artists and hair beauticians available as well as costume designers
equipped to run off fantasy threads like the &quot;Babooshka&quot; number,
guaranteed to dry your throat, boys! 
</P>
<P>She says that she finds it hard to read a book without turning it into a
song, and she informs me that Oscar Wilde is probably her favourite author. She
is especially fond of his childrens' stories, which can still make her cry. 
</P>
<P>All I can say is...well, yeah. Me too.
