<P>Date: Mon, 5 Aug 1991 22:17:45 -0800 <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com
(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Nationwide Breathing Interview, April 25, 1980. 
</P>
<P> 40. Nationwide: Kate is interviewed briefly about Breathing, U.K. TV, April
25,  1980. 
</P>
<P>This is the brief interview during which segments from the Breathing video
were  aired--segments which Peter FitzGerald-Morris claims had been &quot;banned&quot;
by the  British music-video programmes. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED. Thanks to IED for providing me
an  audio tape of this television program.] 
</P>
<P>I: Now a much used phrase in the fifties and early sixties was &quot;living
in the shadow  of the bomb.&quot; And those of us that remember the CND, the
Campaign For  Nuclear Disarmament's marches will also remember that ban the bomb
ballads  from singer's like Joan Biaz. Well today many people believe that with
increasing  tension in the middle east, we've never been closer to the prospect
of nuclear  war. And with headlines echoing that fear, over last few weeks it's
not surprising  that a singer should produce a song with the same sentiments as
those in the  fifties [sixties], but with a style that belongs entirely in the
eighties. The singer is  the British star Kate Bush, and the song is called
Breathing. 
</P>
<P>[Breathing is shown] 
</P>
<P>I: Kate, that's a total departure from the sort of romantic songs you've
been  associated with in the past. Now is there any significance in that? 
</P>
<P>K: I think only significance in as much as it's a subject that's very real
and it's  obviously more outspoken then a lot more of my songs, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: When you said real - to you personally? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, I think to me personally and especially to the public. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you seriously believe, for instance, that the world is drifting
towards war and  that concerns you? 
</P>
<P>K: I hope not, I hope that we're not drifting towards war. But it does
concern me  tremendously, yes it does, as one of the one of the human beings on
this earth. I  think we should be very concerned about looking after each other
[rather] then  destroying each other, which we are doing gradually anyway. 
</P>
<P>I: But what do you say to the criticism that might be put that actually that
kind of  song is a commercial exploitation of difficult world situation? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, absolutely I think that's people would.. they're quite likely to
say, and I  would expect that of people, quite rightly so. But, in fact, when I
did write the  song it was from a purely emotional personal point of view, that
I was incredibly  struck at what we were doing to each other. And that just one
button, one bomb,  could do one hello of a lot to any of us. And I thought it
was just something I had  to say. And at the time it wasn't something I was
thinking of commercially it was  purely an emotional exercise. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you think in any sense that it marks a return to the kind of protest
songs that  were so familiar in the sixties? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think that's a very interesting angle, I think. People were very
aware at  that time of what could happen. And I think at this time again, people
are even  more aware because there is such a real shadow of it happening, all
over the  world. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, Kate thank you very much, indeed. Lots of luck with the song,
indeed I  don't think you need best wishes for luck because it's moved up
fifteen places I  gather in the past week. Let's now have another look at the
sequence from the  video tape from your new song Breathing.
