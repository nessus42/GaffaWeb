(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: MTV interview 85 (unedited version) 
</P>
<P>85. MTV: Kate is interviewed by J.J. Jackson for the U.S. cable rock-video 
channel. 
</P>
<P>An additional generic interview, nearly one hour long, is shot, and very
brief  excerpts are aired on MTV. November 1985. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Jackson's questions are necessarily superficial but are very deftly
posed, and  Kate seems a bit more at ease and more forthcoming than in the other
U.S.  interviews. The questioner for the longer, largely unaired interview draws
 remarkably interesting answers. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above note by IED. Thanks to Ed Suranyi for 
providing me with the tape. I am not sure if the actual interview is J. J.
Jackson, as  the voice sounds different. Kinda a depressed, bored sounding
voice!] [It's not J.J. Jackson  VM]
</P>
<P>[Kate getting prepared for the start of the interview.] 
</P>
<P>I: Let's go all the way back to your childhood, rather than the other way
around.  [Kate Laughs] But, we'll see.. Let's just do how it's scripted out..
Alright...  [Start of interview] So what's different about this new album, as
opposed to all  the other ones, how is it a progression? 
</P>
<P>K: I think one of the biggest differences is that we recorded it in our own
studio.  That made a very big difference to me, it's probably one of the best
decisions  I've ever made. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, now, this studio... This is like right in your home or what? And what
do you  have to do to build one of these things, does it take years, does it
cost millions of  pounds? What's the story behind it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, it cost a lot of money. [Coughs] You gotta find the right place.
[Coughs  twice]. 
</P>
<P>I: Can you start again? 
</P>
<P>K: I'd like to, please, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: And you know, if want, just for instance, &quot;When I built the studio
it cost me a lot  of money.&quot; You know, you could like bring up the end of
my question to the  beginning of your response. 
</P>
<P>K: Do you want me to do that? 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, I sorta would prefer it, because it makes it easier for us to cut a
piece out of  it. 
</P>
<P>K: I see, yeah. Ok, I'll try. [Smiles] 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, you know you don't have to do it every time. But if you think of
it. 
</P>
<P>K: Uh, huh. 
</P>
<P>I: That would be good. And in fact, I might ask you to say things again if I
see that  it's coming out in a way that might not work that well on TV. It's one
of the  things that we have to do. 
</P>
<P>K: Great. No, that sorta helps me really. 
</P>
<P>I: Just sit back and don't worried about it, just talk and it'll be good. 
</P>
<P>K: Thanks. 
</P>
<P>I: Alright. We were talking about the studio, right? And you're gonna tell
me like  what it was like to build it and what you want built. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. One of the main reasons for wanting to build our own studio was the
 amount of money that it was costing in a commercial studio per hour. And when 
you work experimentally it actually becomes prohibitive when it's costing that 
amount of money. Plus the distractions. So you've gotta find a place, and you 
gotta get the best equipment in there that you can that you can afford because 
[phone rings loudly] obviously it's very expensive stuff. 
</P>
<P>[Kate smiles. Phone rings again. Tape cuts.] 
</P>
<P>I: Can you see was that a wig, was it Memorex [Kate smiles], what was it
because... 
</P>
<P>[Tape cuts again.] 
</P>
<P>Tech: We're ready anytime you want to. 
</P>
<P>I: This studio's jinxed now, because the phone rings and everything stops.
So, I  mean, you have the studio and everything, and it was help make it easier,
but  what about the subject matter. Do you feel that these songs are about
different  things then songs on your previous album. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think the last album was quite an intense album. I think it was
about  emotion and there were alot of things that I wanted to say that I wasn't
happy  with. I was feeling mankind to be cruel, negative. And I think I
expressed that in  a lot of the songs. For this album there's a completely
different energy. I moved  from the city to the country. I was surrounded by
elemental forces which I really  feel feature on this album. And I was feeling
really happy and positive, and  considering mankind to be much better than on
the last album. So I think it...  it's got a more positive energy. 
</P>
<P>I: That kinda weird that you say that, because especially on the first side
all the  songs are so pessimistic, these songs about people who just cannot
communicate. 
</P>
<P>K: On this album? 
</P>
<P>I: Yes. 
</P>
<P>K: But I think it's actually finding a way for them to communicate, if they
can't.  The positive side is that they find a way to, and if they don't then
there's the  hope that they can. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, so then Running Up That Hill is just the beginning of a whole cycle? 
</P>
<P>K: [Long pause] How do you mean? 
</P>
<P>I: Well, cause I mean that is like a really pessimistic thing. I mean, two
people  wanting to switch places like that. Saying &quot;if you could feel what
I feel now, then  what?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: But why is it pessimistic though, why is it not positive to want to
experience what  the other person feels? For me, it's a positive thing, it's
saying that they can get  rid of the problems, or they want to, they care enough
about each other to want  to do that. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, great. So on this side then... we got the optimist... What caused you
to write  lyrics though like &quot;You never understood me, you never really
tried.&quot; Is it some  personal experience? 
</P>
<P>K: I think everyone at some times feels misunderstood. But I can't think of
any song  that I would say was truly autobiographical. There's something of me
in every  song, in that I'm expressing something I'm hoping is interesting. But
I don't  think they're truly autobiographical comments in any way. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok. I have written here &quot;what's Cloudbusting about?&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Well Cloudbusting was inspired by a book that I found in a shop about
nine years  ago, it's out of print now. Written by a guy called Peter Reich, and
it's called A  Book Of Dreams. And it's very unusual, beautiful book, written by
this man  through the eyes of himself when he was a child, looking at his
father, and the  relationship between them. Very special relationship, his
father meant so much to  him. His father was a psychoanalyst, very respected,
but he also had a machine  that could make it rain, and the two of them would go
out together and they  would make it rain. And in the book there was such a
sense of magic, that it a  way the rain was almost a presence of his father.
Unfortunately, its a very sad  book in that the peak of it is where his father
was arrested, taken away from  him, because of his beliefs he's considered a
threat. And it's how the child has to  cope from that point onwards without his
father. And the song is really using the  rain as something the reminds the son
of his father. Every time it rains instead of  it being very sad and lonely,
it's a very happy moment for him, it's like his  father is with him again. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, his father's Wilhelm Reich, right? [Kate nods] Hmm, good. And in the
video,  was it easy for you to portray a child? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's something I'd obviously worried about. When you're not a
child  there are lots of things that could be a problem. Like I could look old
and not  young. And we were also [coughs] - excuse me - trying to take away the 
feminine edge so that in a way I could be a tomboy rather than a little girl. 
Trying to keep the thing as innocent as possible. And I think rather than being 
that worried about playing a child, I was just worried about the whole process
of  acting, because it's something I've not really done, in a true sense. I've 
preformed in lots of ways, but not really acted. And it was something that I was
 wary of and I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>I: Well that's what everyone around the office is saying, for instance, like
saying  &quot;well she should play Tess the Dervervilles&quot; this English
classic. [Kate stiffels a  laugh] I mean is this something that you are really
considering doing now? 
</P>
<P>K: Acting? 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, acting more. 
</P>
<P>K: It's nothing that has ever really been a strong desire for me. I mean,
never at any  point in my life have I wanted to be an actress. But if there was
something  offered that was interesting enough, I would certainly want to do it,
yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, good. Let's get back to the video then. How'd you get Donald
Sutherland to  be in it? 
</P>
<P>K: Really lucky. The brief, really from the start, was that I wanted a great
actor to  play the father. I wanted it to be a piece of film rather than a video
promotional  clip. I wanted it to be a short piece of film that would hopefully
do justice to the  original book. And let people understand the story that
couldn't really be  explained in the song. So we wanted a great actor. We though
of Donald  Sutherland and though &quot;well, chances are we won't get him, but
why not try?&quot;  So we found a contact and explained the story and sent the
script to him, and he  was interested in doing it. And just happened to have the
days free when we  were shooting. So, um, pretty incredible really! 
</P>
<P>I: So what was he like? 
</P>
<P>K: Fantastic! Really professional, really patient, and an incredible help to
me. In my  debut acting role I had a pretty good actor opposite me. And he was
so  encouraging and made it so easy for me. I mean, whenever we were acting, he 
was my father. I just had to react to him like child. He made it very easy. 
</P>
<P>I: Great. Who directed the video and where was it shot? I think the setting
of its  really beautiful. 
</P>
<P>K: It is a beautiful place. It's the Veil of The White Horse, in England.
And the  director was Julien Doyle. 
</P>
<P>I: And tell us more about Julien Doyle. 
</P>
<P>K: Julien Doyle... [Kate looks over. The tape cuts. Kate laughs. A voice in
the  background goes &quot;sorry about that&quot;. Kate coughs then looks around
and smiles  real big! Who need art when you've got Kate Bush smiles?] 
</P>
<P>I: .. we've been talking about Julien Doyle and where he's from and what
he's  done and how you met him. 
</P>
<P>K: I'm a big fan of Terry Gilliam, I don't know if you know him, suburb
director.  And I was interested in working with him and he put me in touch will
Julien,  who works with Terry on his movies. He's a cameraman and this was
really his  first role as director. Terry was involved with the storyboard as
well, and this is  how I met Julien. 
</P>
<P>We spent a lot of time on this video and what was nice was the way that
everyone  became so concerned with the story and also concerned with giving
justice to it.  You know everyone wanted it to be something special. 
</P>
<P>I: Why is it set in the fifties? 
</P>
<P>K: Because of the book. That's the time that it happened to the boy. He was
about  twelve... 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, in this question you &quot;Because of the book, The Book Of Dreams
that it's  based on...&quot; Ok? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. It's because A Book Of Dreams, that it's based on, was actually at
that  time, in the fifties, that his father was taken from him. He was about
twelve.  [Kate makes an &quot;I hope I got that right&quot; look] 
</P>
<P>I: And that's really it, you just took the exact time from the book? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think also it made it more interesting. It's not totally accurate
to the fifties  and I think that in itself is important. We wanted to create a
sense of - no certain  time. I think it's more interesting in way when it could
be any time. But also by  not making it contemporary time you get a big sense of
nostalgia, of something  that has happened in the past. So I think visually it
was a very good combination. 
</P>
<P>I: How did you make that machine? 
</P>
<P>K: Well the book very little details of what the actual machine looked like.
But from  what I could gather the reality of the machine wouldn't look right. ON
screen  it's got to be exaggerated. So it was trying to design something that
would look  powerful and possible of doing it but that wouldn't be comical,
because we  didn't people to laugh at it, we wanted people to be astounded by
the machine.  So it was really designing something that was a cross between an
Akatan [???]  gun and a pipe organ. I just felt that it had to have these huge
funnels that would  reach to the sky and could be moved around. And the whole
thing should be  rotatable. And so we worked with some designers that worked on
the Alien and I  think it looked pretty good. 
</P>
<P>I: It looks great. Is this the first video where you're not dancing? 
</P>
<P>K: No, but it's quite a departure. I have done a couple of others that again
we were  trying to treat like piece of film, but we were using lip sync or
something like  that. And we were working on video as well, which makes it quite
different. 
</P>
<P>I: How come there are two Running Up That Hill clips. Well you should
probably  tell us what they are. But why is that? Did you actually make them
both and  authorize them both? 
</P>
<P>K: No, I think what's happened here is your seeing a TV performance that we
did  in England to promote the single. And I don't do very many TV performances.
It  concerns me that to try and to do everything you can and put as much effort
into  it, and sometimes its very difficult to make things look good in TV
situations. But  that was a live TV and we presented it that way for the British
audience. It  wasn't my intention that that clip would be shown anywhere else at
all, apart  from that one live performance in England. And it was something that
the record  company wanted to use here, and that's why you're seeing that. From
my point  of view, the expression visually that goes with that song is the film
that we made  that is the dance video. And the other one is really for me just a
one-off TV. 
</P>
<P>I: Well who are you dancing with in the dance version and who directed that
one? 
</P>
<P>K: The director of that was a guy called David Garfath and the dancer was a
guy  called Michael Hervieu, who we auditioned. We wanted to do a piece, a
serious  piece of dance. Over the last couple of years, all the videos I seen,
dance has  become a very exploited thing and hasn't really been treated
seriously. It's been  used to sorta be accessories [makes broad motion with
hands] around the person  who's starring in the film. And we thought it would be
nice to do almost a  classical piece of dance, filmed as well as possible,
because it's very rarely filmed  well now. In fact, the only well filmed piece
of dance I think I've ever seen was  [???? anybody know who she's talking about
here???] and I think that's because  she was so involved in it that it was so
good. So that's what we wanted to do, a  nice serious piece of dance, simple,
well-filmed and give dance a chance in a real  way in this pop world. 
</P>
<P>I: I like the masks, I liked the scenes with the masks. How did you think
those up? 
</P>
<P>K: Well that was very much a coincidence, where the director was talking
about  these masks and I had a film on video that we'd taped that had a section
where  people were wearing these photographic masks. And we just felt that it
was a  really interesting idea, this crowd that would suddenly sorta rush in
through the  dance sequence. And the idea of the crowd being the force of either
the man or  the woman and so the faces change from the man to the woman. And
then the  idea of drowning in yourself. Just sorta those kinda plays on things.

</P>
<P>I: Ok, good. Now everyone says side two of the album is all about someone
drowning,  is that true? 
</P>
<P>K: I'd say it was more about someone not drowning. They're in the water for
the  night... 
</P>
<P>I: Okay, Okay, that's the thing. You should start by saying &quot;Even
though alot of  people say side two is about drowning...&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Okay, uh huh. I think, even though a lot of people say that the side is
about  someone drowning, it's more about someone who's not drowning. And how 
they're there for the night in the water being visited by their past, present,
and  future to keep them awake, to keep them going through until the morning
until  there's hope. [Big smile] 
</P>
<P>I: Alright. Is there going to be like a whole video film based on that side?

</P>
<P>K: That's something that I like the idea of trying, but it's all talk and no
more. And  talk to action is a big leap, so I don't know. 
</P>
<P>I: OK. Who's ... This is like scattering around a bit, but why not?... Who's
the  band in TV performance. Like who are the members of it? Is that the band
you  perform with? Are those people on the album? 
</P>
<P>K: When you say the TV performance, you mean of Running Up That Hill? 
</P>
<P>I: Running Up That Hill? 
</P>
<P>K: Alot of them are musicians that were on the album and others were people
that  we had to call in because, for instance, the Fairlight part I played on
the record,  but visually it just looked better if I was singing. So we had
someone on the  keyboards. And a few of them were in the band when we toured in
'79. 
</P>
<P>I: Alright. I like that part with the bow and arrow at the end by the way. 
</P>
<P>K: Do you? 
</P>
<P>I: It's really striking. Something you thought of at the moment? 
</P>
<P>K: It's a kind of thread that's been running through that song. The cover of
the  single is using a bow and arrow. In the video at the end there's a section
where  there's an invisible bow. [Imitates end of video and laughs] So it was
just the  kind of thing that kept occurring and I thought it would to fun to...
live television  with an audience just taking out a bow and arrow, makes people
go [makes whoa  movement] for a minute and maybe that's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>I: Uh, huh. That looks real good. Have you ever toured? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Will you ever tour again? Will you ever come to America and play a tour,
play at  various places? 
</P>
<P>K: I'd really like to tour again and the one tour I did in '79, England and
Europe,  was really exhausting. We rehearsed it for maybe six months and by the
time we  got around to the first night, I was really looking forward to having
an audience  out there so that you could how you see how they would react, see
if they liked it.  It was really a lot of fun and in many ways very educational
for me as a  performer as well as a person. But it's the commitment, it's so
much time and  effort. And I just don't know if it's something I want to launch
into. It'd  probably be a year out, at least. 
</P>
<P>[A voice says &quot;We have to change tape.&quot; Tape cuts into Kate and
the interviewer  talking about the Running Up That Hill videos.] 
</P>
<P>I: ... they show the live performance. 
</P>
<P>K: Do they? 
</P>
<P>I: They show it alot. 
</P>
<P>K: Hmm. That's interesting. 
</P>
<P>I: It's been shown alot. 
</P>
<P>K: Hmmm. So would you say that the dance one has ever been shown? 
</P>
<P>I: I don't know. [Kate Laughs]. I don't know. [Kate laughs again] I don't
know if  it's ever been shown. 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs more] Great. That's really interesting. 
</P>
<P>I: [Back to asking questions] Did you start out dancing before you became a
singer? 
</P>
<P>K: No, when I um... I left school at ah... I was about sixteen, seventeen.
And I  actually left school with the decision that I wanted to throw myself into
the world  of music and [swings arm] go forth and get into it. And I felt that I
had to work  in order to find a way in. And I took up dance really to sorta fill
up the day, give  me some kind of discipline, and a way to get to meet people
and become  independent. 
</P>
<P>I: Really, like does it take a lot of time? Do you work out a lot? What has
it done for  you? 
</P>
<P>K: It did an incredible amount, especially when I started back then. I had a
 recording contract, but I didn't know when I was going to be making the first 
album, and I had, in a way, time to kill and use until that point. And I had
very  little experience... certainly the business, I mean coming straight from
school.  And I had almost two clear years of going to the dance school, learning
to dance,  getting more control over my body, and writing. Just using the time
generally as a  kind of foundation for what was to happen next when the album
was released  and the single was very successful. I think without having used
the time like that,  things could've been very different for me. I was very
lucky. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you choreograph all the clips then? Like Sat In Your Lap and Suspended
In  Gaffa and Wuthering Heights, those all are your choreography? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, and those ones that you mentioned particulary. I worked with a
chirographer  when we toured and I was using two dancers and he was involved
with  integrating the routines between the three of us. And the Running Up That
Hill  dance performance, I worked with a lady chirographer called Dianne Grey,
and I  really enjoyed that. It was really exciting to work with someone else and
get that  feedback. And her experience with my sorta non-technical ideas were a
very  good combination, we had a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>I: Where did you shoot some of these? Like Suspended In Gaffa it's like in a
barn  or something. Are these all sound stages or do you use locations? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, they're all stages and extremely good designers. 
</P>
<P>I: Okay. I want to go back to when you were signed and everything like that,
sorta  back in time a bit. And do you feel that... you very young, and recording
very  young, and had an album out at a young age, right? And do you feel that it
was an  advantage to you or a disadvantage, that that happened to you so early?

</P>
<P>K: I think it's been a big advantage. I am doing what I want to do, I really
want to  be involved in this business. I don't think... If I hadn't started so
young, I  probably wouldn't have my own recording studio now, I probably
wouldn't have  the kind of control that I have over the situation at such an
early age. So I think  it's been really beneficial for me. 
</P>
<P>I: Um, what role did David Gilmour have in getting you signed? 
</P>
<P>K: I was about fifteen. My family thought it would be interesting to see if
we could  get some of my songs published, I'd written loads of songs. I just
used to write  one every day or something. And through a friend of the family
who knew Dave  Gilmour, we made a contact for him to come and hear some of my
songs. At that  time, he was sort of scouting for talent, looking for bands that
he could produce  or become involved in or just encourage. And I became one of
the people that he  was visiting. I think he liked the songs sufficiently to
feel that it was worth him  actually putting up money for me to go in and
professionally record the tracks,  because all my demos were just piano vocals
and I had, say like 50 songs that  were all piano vocals. And he felt, quite
rightly, that the record company would  relate to the music much in a more real
way if it was produced rather than being  demoed. So he put up the money, we
went into the studio, recorded three tracks,  and I got a recording contract
from that. I: Great. What about Peter Gabriel?  How has his music influenced
you? 
</P>
<P>K: I think anything you like influences you, and I do like his music. I
think he's  very clever, he's brilliant. And I think he's one of the few people
who is trying  to do something interesting with contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, what do you mean by that, by &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;different&quot;.
Well, you didn't say  &quot;different&quot;, you said &quot;interesting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Hmm. Well I think it's both and I don't think there's much of that
happening.  For me the Floyd were doing something interesting, especially with
the Wall.  Talking Heads are doing something very interesting. I think David
Bowie  certainly was as was Roxy Music way back in the seventies, in fact they
set a kind  of formula that people are still copying and getting away with now.
I mean so  many people sound like Brian Ferry, so many people look or sound like
David  Bowie. And I think it's these kind of original stamps that create an
incredible  amount of imitators, but it's still these people who leave the mark
and who are  doing something really interesting. 
</P>
<P>I: Well you sang with Peter Gabriel, right? 
</P>
<P>K: Say again? 
</P>
<P>I: You sang Peter Gabriel on one of his records. Can you tell us about that?

</P>
<P>K: Um, I was really delighted to be asked to do something and it was a lot
of fun. 
</P>
<P>I: What was the song and what do you think of the song? 
</P>
<P>K: I thought it was a great song, I think that that album that Peter did was
one of  those albums that actually set a mark in a point in time. And I think it
was well  appreciated, which is good. I think another album like that was David
Bryne and  Eno's Night in The Bush Of Ghosts. I don't know how popular that was
here,  but it didn't really get that much attention in our country. And I think
that left a  very big mark on popular music, particularly when you look at the
charts at the  moment. The things that are happening again in our country are so
derivative of  that album. 
</P>
<P>I: That's the sort of album that a lot of people in music or who really
follow music  listen to alot. So it definitely got a lot of attention. It wasn't
like a top 100 album  or anything but... 
</P>
<P>K: No. 
</P>
<P>I: .. it really had it's audience. What have you been able to do since you
started  using the Fairlight that you couldn't do before? 
</P>
<P>K: It gives me much more control over arrangements, particulary. And it
effects so  may different areas. As soon as I start writing now I'm working with
a sound  that is sparking off a particular atmosphere. When you sit down and
write at the  piano, the sound of the piano is not as different as brass and
strings, etc. And I  think it really effects the whole flavor of the song. Like
the difference between  writing on the piano and a guitar, but maybe amplified
by a hundred times  because of all the different sounds that you have. 
</P>
<P>I: What songs on the album did you write on the Fairlight and what did you
write on  the piano? 
</P>
<P>K: THere were very few track on this album that I wrote on the piano
-Running Up  That Hill, Hounds of Love, Watching You Without Me. Most of them
were  Fairlight based. Cloudbusting I wrote on the Fairlight and I just felt it
would be  much more interesting with real strings, so we transcribed the
Fairlight  arrangement from string players to reed. And then they redid it. 
</P>
<P>I: THere are other people using the Fairlight now to, like Simple Minds and
Thomas  Dolby. Have you heard their records? 
</P>
<P>K: I've heard some of Simple Minds stuff, yes. I think the Fairlight is one
of those  instruments that is definitely in there now. When it first came out it
was so  expensive that I think it prohibited people from getting close to it,
getting to  know it. But it seems to have conquered that barrier now, it's
available in studios,  at least, and people can get to use it. And I think it
will be on so many things  from now on. 
</P>
<P>I: We're going to change the subject now. Do you see a connection between 
mysticism and science? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know, I'm sure there is. I think there's a connection between 
everything, I think everything is linked up somehow, you just got to find where 
they meet. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you consider yourself a religious person? 
</P>
<P>K: That's a question that I get asked a lot. Some people come in, they're so
 convinced that I'm of a particular order. [Laughs] And I think everyone has 
something in them that is seeking some kind of religion, but whether I call 
myself a religious person - I don't think so, no. But I think I am fascinated by
 religious imagery, I think most people are. And it's one of those things that
has  an incredibly extreme effect on people and that, from a writer's point of
view, is  fascinating. 
</P>
<P>I: Are there any writers who've really influenced you alot. Print writers
like [???  mentions two writers I couldn't figure out names! Bo Gorge?] that you
want to  talk about? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know if there are any writers that have really influenced me.
Particular  books certainly have. But again they're much on a novel level rather
than a  reality level. 
</P>
<P>I: Uh, huh. Well like let's have a couple of examples. 
</P>
<P>K: I used to read quite a lot of Kurt Vonnegut and C. S. Lewis when I was a
kid was  one of my biggest ones. I also think when you're very little, like I
don't know if  you were ever read fairy stories by your mother, I think those
kind of things get  in very, very deep. And when I was really little, one of my
favorite writers was  Oscar Wilder and his fairy stories. And I actually think
that they got in quite  deep. I think his sense of tragedy and poetry is
something that still moves me  very much. 
</P>
<P>I: I didn't know he had fairy stories. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, he does indeed. 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, really? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh yes, and they're beautiful. 
</P>
<P>I: Can you like describe one? 
</P>
<P>K: Well one of them. [Coughs]. Just trying to think what it's called. The
Happy  Prince is one of his stories. It's about this huge statue that stands in
the middle of  a city. And it's incredibly beautiful, it's coated in gold, his
eyes are rubies, he just  sparkles. He's a beautiful statue of the prince. And
there's a little swallow who's  flown in and nests at the feet of the statue
overlooking the city. And the statue  speaks to the swallow and says does he
realize how much poverty and sadness is  going on in the city. So bit by bit the
little swallow strips the statue of the gold and  the rubies and distributes it
around the city to all the poor people. So eventually  the Prince is just like a
lead blob. He eyes are taken so he's blind, and he's just  left completely
alone, all his great finery has gone to the poor. And it's winter  and the
swallow should really migrate or it will die and the swallow will not leave 
him. And the tragedy is the closeness between them - that the swallow should go 
or it will die and how beautiful he was and now he's completely stripped. The 
little swallow dies and eventually they just sort of pull the statue down and
stick  him in the dump. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, no. 
</P>
<P>K: But the way it is written and it's so beautiful and so sad! And there was
one...  you know, at the point where the swallow was discovered I always used to
cry as  a child. 
</P>
<P>I: So you like to write songs like that that are sorta so archetypal in a
way? 
</P>
<P>K: I think his sense of tragedy in telling a story attracts me tremendously.
And I  think it's very similar in a way to a lot of the traditional music that I
was again  influenced by when I was very little... by my family. My brothers
were really into  folk music. And a lot of folk music is so into telling
stories. And it's in a way  something that doesn't feature so much in
contemporary music any more. I think  contemporary music is used to help
relationships a lot of the time. Like you go to  the disco and you meet someone,
so you have a song, and it's your song. It's more  about that then actually
telling stories. Like the traditional things are. And I think  that's a big
fascination for me. 
</P>
<P>I: Well is this a recent thing? Like on your last couple of albums I've
noticed a lot  more like jigs and stuff and folk instrumentation. Is this a
direction that you're  going in more? 
</P>
<P>K: I think I've always been really influenced by it, but I haven't been able
to  express it through my songs. It's weird, trying to talk about the process of
 writing. But it does actually take over you and you don't have control over it 
beyond a certain point. And it's only really, I suppose, the last couple of
albums,  where I feel I've had enough control over the process to be able to
express the  influences that are in there. And particulary the Irish ones. I've
wanted to work  with Irish musicians and the pipes and fiddles for a long time
but haven't really  had anywhere in my music for them. 
</P>
<P>I: Could you talk about your brothers for a bit and how they've affected you
in  you're being a creative person, not just like in the sounds that have come
out on  the album? 
</P>
<P>K: We're a very close family and they're my friends. My parents as well as
my  brothers are friends. And I think they're a very creative family. And I
think  being brought up in a situation where music is there, people are being
creative, it  feels natural for you to do that to. So I think that was a very
big opening for me  at a very young age to have that kind of energy around me.
And in fact, the  energy that I'm in now. 
</P>
<P>	 And I think they have been a very big influence on me. When I was very
little it  was their music that I used to listen to before I got my own record
player and  then could play my own music. And I think older brothers, sisters
can't help but  be an incredible influences. 
</P>
<P>I: So when you were younger you were much, like, closer with your family
then  with people outside? I mean, were you a shy person to people outside the
family? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think so. I think I'm still quite shy. It depends on the
situation, but I can be  very shy with people. But I think it just depends on
the situation and the person. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok. Do you feel you're a reclusive person or social person? 
</P>
<P>K: I think I'm really fighting between the two. I think there's a side of me
that  really loves being social and really loves being with people and there's
another  side of me that doesn't, that finds.. for instance most of my creative
work I  couldn't do with people around. I couldn't write a song with someone
else in the  same room. It's a very private process for me. I think I've
probably got a bit  better about it, I mean when I first used to start writing,
even if someone walked  in, it would just completely blow my concentration. And
at least now I can keep it  going maybe if they're one person in the room. But
yes, I think there's a strange  struggle in there between those two areas, for
me. 
</P>
<P>I: What records did you like when you were younger. Like when you said &quot;You
 know until I got my own record player and had my own music.&quot; What was
that? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I used to listen to a lot of singles that my brothers had bought
that weren't  out when I was there. Songs from the early sixties that actually I
wouldn't have  heard had it not been for there collection. And I suppose I
started buying all the  singles that were out, I was very singles orientated.
All the hits. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: So you liked the singles. Were there like any that you can remember that
you still  have now? 
</P>
<P>K: Well one of the first records I ever bought was called They're Coming To
Take  Me Away, Hah Hah by Napoleon the 14th. I thought that was great! I thought
it  was really interesting. I suppose it was one of the first rap records
really.  [Laughs] I think the first album I bought was Bridge Over Troubled
Water. I  liked the songs on that. I think again that's been a big attraction
for me. I'm sure  stimulated by traditional music, the thing of the structure of
songs and having a  story, it does attract me. 
</P>
<P>I: [to cameraman] Now you're saying there's two minutes left on this tape or
what? 
</P>
<P>Cameraman: Uh, huh! 
</P>
<P>I: So maybe we should [tape cuts] 
</P>
<P>Cameraman: It's awfully dark out there. [Pause, Kate looks at the blue
screen  behind her]. Steadily change. 
</P>
<P>I: Don't jump cut to much. That'll look weird if you jump cut back and
forth. It  would drive people crazy I sort like.... 
</P>
<P>K: Hmm. You could have completely different weather in every scene! That
would  be great! 
</P>
<P>I: That's a really good idea. We should sometime. You could probably do that
with... 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! Have it snowing and then brilliant sunshine. That would be really
good  wouldn't it! 
</P>
<P>I: Sat In Your Lap, like could you, that seem to be about like knowledge and
not  getting it and not knowing if you've got it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, the search for knowledge. And I suppose the thing of people... 
</P>
<P>I: Okay, could you say &quot;Sat In Your Lap that's about the search for
knowledge&quot; you  know, say something like that. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Say the title and then what it's about. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, Sat In Your Lap is very much a search for knowledge. And about the
kind  of people who really want to have knowledge but can't be bothered to do
the  things that they should in order to get it. So they're sitting there saying
how nice  it would be to have this or to do that without really desiring to do
the things it  takes you to get it. And also the more you learn the more
ignorant you realize  you are and that you get over one wall to find an even
bigger one. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: How bout the video, is that on ice, the video, or what? 
</P>
<P>K: No, it's roller skates. That was a lot of fun. I don't think we felt it
was a serious  video, you know, it's meant to fun. We thought the roller skates
needed an  airing. [laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, how about Suspended In Gaffa. Like what's the song about and then
I'll ask  you what the video's about. First the song. 
</P>
<P>K: Suspended In Gaffa is I suppose similar in some ways to Sat In Your Lap -
the  idea of someone seeking something, wanting something. I was brought up as a
 Roman Catholic and had the imagery of purgatory and of the idea that when you 
were taken there that you would be given a glimpse of God and then you  wouldn't
see him again until you were let into heaven. And we were told that in  Hell it
was even worse because you got to see God but then you knew that you  would
never see him again. And it's sorta using that as the parallel. And the idea  of
seeing something incredibly beautiful, having a religious experience as such, 
but not being able to get back there. And it was playing musically with the idea
 of the verses being sorta real time and someone happily jumping through life 
[makes happy motion with head] and then you hit the chorus and it like 
everything sorta goes into slow mo and they're reaching [makes slow reaching 
motion with arm] for that thing that they want and they can't get there.
[Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: And is like the video a dance interpretation of that? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, that video and the one that went with There Goes A Tenner, quite
honestly,  were rushed. There was very little time to do them. I had to do three
videos in  something like two months and I don't really think that if we'd had
more time  that we would have done that. 
</P>
<P>I: So what takes the most time for you, the ideas or the execution? 
</P>
<P>K: I'm sorry? 
</P>
<P>I: What takes the most time for you? Is it the ideas or is it the execution?
Like is it  making the video or coming up with what you think is a really good
idea to... 
</P>
<P>K: It does depend on what you're doing, but I think the ideas are probably
the most  time consuming thing. Because if you can have as much organized before
you go  into shooting then it's going to be that much quicker and that much more
 efficient. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, and I guess finally, could you just tell us about your one
performance in  America? 
</P>
<P>K: Saturday Night Live? 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, that one. 
</P>
<P>K: It was a lot of fun! It was really good. I was asked to come over here by
Eric Idle  from Montey Pithon, who was hosting the show. And it was a great
honor for me  and a real pleasure to do. Complete madness! 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, yeah? What did you do, what songs. 
</P>
<P>K: I did, The Man With The Child In His Eyes and Them Heavy People. That was
a  while ago now that was '79. 
</P>
<P>I: That's right, that's a long time ago already. 
</P>
<P>K: Hmm. 
</P>
<P>I: Um, what about Wuthering Heights, what inspired you to write that? That
sounds  like an obvious question, but maybe it's not an obvious answer, I don't
know. 
</P>
<P>K: I think it is an obvious answer. [Laughs] It was very much the book. The
idea of  a relationship that even when one of them is dead, they will not leave
the other  one alone. I found that fascinating. Not unlike the energy behind the
Houdini  song that we did, where the strength of love... I mean it's incredibly
romantic.  But a very nice story and the sense of how even when she's dead she
has to come  back for him. Possessive lady. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: Have you ever been in love in that way or that much? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think love effects you in a funny way and I think everyone loves
something  or someone so I think everyone understands at least on some level the
 experiences. I wouldn't say I was a terribly possessive or ... [Laughs] I mean
I  would hate to think that I was like Cathy! But I think everyone certainly has
 shadows or little tinges of those things in them. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok. I think that's about it, we should probably just shoot little a
couple of cut  aways. At which point we'll probably think of a couple of other
questions, just see  how it goes. 
</P>
<P>K: OK, great. 
</P>
<P>[This is where my tape ends. According to end, there is a tape that has
another  question about the ninth wave in it. If anyone has this final question
please post.]
