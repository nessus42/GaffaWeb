<P><STRONG><EM>Kate Bush</EM></STRONG>  
</P>
<P>&quot;One day, along comes this friend of my brother's. He worked in the
record business himself and thought he might be able to make contacts. Well, he
knew Pink Floyd from Cambridge and he asked Dave Gilmour (Pink Floyd's
guitarist) down to hear me.&quot;</P>
<P>Little did Dave Gilmour know that he was about to meet the child-woman who,
only a scant two years later, would have the No. 1 hit in England with her
single debut &quot;Wuthering Heights;&quot; Kate Bush.</P>
<P>&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is an eerie, almost hypnotic tune which is
based on the section of Emily Bronte's novel where Cathy Earnshaw wants to seize
Heathcliff's soul so they can be together in the spirit world; on the surface an
unlikely candidate for Pop chart success. It's a measure of Bush's right
instincts and the charisma of her talent that the single became such a huge
success and won column after column of critic's raves in the English press.</P>
<P>&quot;When I first read 'Wuthering Heights,' I thought the story was so
strong. This young girl in an era when the female role was so inferior and she
was coming out with this passionate, heavy stuff. Great subject matter for a
song.</P>
<P>&quot;I loved writing it,&quot; she enthuses. &quot;It was a real challenge
to perceive the whole mood of a book into such a short piece of prose Also, when
I was a child I was always called Cathy not Kate and I just found myself able to
relate to her as a character. It's so important to put yourself in the role of
the person in a song. There no half measure. When I sing that song I am Cathy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was only a harbinger of things to come from
the talented Kate Bush. With the release of her debut EMI America album <EM>The
Kick Inside</EM> (previously released in North America by Capitol in March
1978), Kate Bush herself is rapidly on the way to becoming a classic in her own
time. (The LP earned the nineteen year-old singer/songwriter Top 10 honors on
the British Pop charts prior to its U.S. release.)</P>
<P>Born July 30, 1958, she grew up at Plumstead in Kent, England, and seemed
destined from an early age to become involved with music.</P>
<P>&quot;I have two older brothers and they were very keen on musical
instruments. So I just grew up with music all around me,&quot; she explains. &quot;When
I was about eleven I just started poking around at the piano and started making
up little songs. I never played Beatle songs or anything like that. I was always
just exploring the instrument.</P>
<P>&quot;Then, when I was 14, I started taking it seriously and I began to
treat the words to the songs as poetry. I'd always been keen on poetry at school
and it was lovely to put the poems together with the music.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, along came Dave Gilmour. Impressed by her talent he funded a session
at the Air London studios for Bush to record a demo tape. EMI heard the tape and
signed Kate Bush to the label, posthaste. Because she was so young (sixteen at
the time), it was decided that she should spend the next few years developing
her already considerable talents.</P>
<P>She studied mime and modern dance with the highly respected Lindsey Kemp
(who also tutored David Bowie) for a short time. After Kemp went to Australia,
Bush began dance classes at The Dance Centre in London's Covent Garden.</P>
<P>&quot;That was all two years ago now,&quot; she says. &quot;Since then I've
been singing, playing and writing until we made the album last summer.
Originally it was to be released last autumn but it kept getting delayed. I'm
glad we waited till 1978 though. It kind of signifies it all starting with the
new year for me.&quot;</P>
<P>And what a start.</P>
<P><EM>The Kick Inside</EM> features thirteen of Kate Bush's own compositions.
In addition to the aforementioned &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; there's &quot;Man
With The Child In His Eyes,&quot; a complex and intriguing song in which Bush
probes the intricacies of a relationship between a young girl and an older man.
&quot;Strange Phenomena,&quot; she explains, &quot;is about how coincidences
cluster together.&quot; On &quot;Kite&quot; the versatile Bush assumes the pose
of the inanimate flying machine to describe what might happen if a man could fly
like a kite. &quot;Feel It,&quot; &quot;Oh To Be In Love&quot; and &quot;L'Amour
Looks Something Like You&quot; deal insightfully with different angles of love,
and &quot;James And The Cold Gun&quot; tells about a man who leaves home to &quot;live
by the rifle&quot; until the friends he left behind &quot;get out of hand&quot;
and beg him to return.</P>
<P>The album was produced by Andrew Powell (whose credits include working with
Alan Parsons and Cockney Rebel) and Dave Gilmour is listed as Executive Producer
on &quot;Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Saxophone Song.&quot;
As a singer, Bush has an unusual and, once heard, addicting style. She possesses
a breathtaking vocal range; her voice gracefully  entwines with each individual
note.</P>
<P>As a writer, she is amazingly insightful; blending the universal with the
personal, she transcends both.</P>
<P>And, she has her own way of coaxing melodies from her beloved instrument.</P>
<P>&quot;I feel as though I've built up a real relationship with the piano.
It's almost Iike a person. If I haven't got a particular idea I just sit down
and play chords and then the chords almost dictate what the song should be about
because they have their own moods.&quot;</P>
<P>The present has never been brighter for Kate Bush whose future looms as
infinite as the uncharted stars.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm really not sure how I'm going to develop from now,&quot; she
explains. &quot;What direction my music will take.</P>
<P>&quot;I just want to carry on exploring.&quot;</P>
<P>EMI AMERICA</P>
<P>KATE BUSH, &quot;WUTHERING HEIGHTS&quot; (prod.  by A. Powell) (writer K.
Bush (Glenwood, ASCAP) (3:33). 
</P>
<P>The record debuting in the U.S. was # 1 for some time in Australia and the
U.K. Bush's voice is most unusual but  continued listening and the lovely hook
should endear it  to pop and adult audiences alike. EMI America P-8003.</P>
