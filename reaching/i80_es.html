<P>The Things Kate doesn't tell mother 
</P>
<P>by James Johnson 
</P>
<P>Evening Standard 
</P>
<P>Friday, Sept. 5 1980 
</P>
<P> KATE BUSH would be less than human if she did not sometimes marvel at the 
attention she has received over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>She says: &quot;Sometimes I see myself in the paper and it's hard to
associate with the  name Kate Bush. She is this well-known person who has almost
become like a  brand name like Maxwell House coffee or something. Meanwhile, I'm
just working  on my music and my life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Somehow she remains an awkward personality to categorize. One newspaper has 
described her as Britain's top pop sexpot while a new, unauthorized biography 
about her life opted for the title Suburban Princess. 
</P>
<P>Even now she comes over in person as part pop star and part ordinary girl
from  East Welling in Kent, firmly in the south London commuter belt, while her 
conversation ranges between traditional pop world cliches to perceptive comment.

</P>
<P>Her guilelessness and insistence on being eager to please almost offers a 
challenge to find some kind of hidden dark secret to her life. However, nothing 
rarely emerges. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I often think people are looking for something in my life that they
can't find,&quot;  she comments. &quot;A number of performers, I suppose, come
from working-class  families or their parents were divorced, perhaps that gives
them the urge to go out  and struggle for something. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But basically I have always had a normal, very happy life with my
family. I never  went out and beat up old ladies or became an alcholic at
school. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think the public have become conditioned to want to know who is
sleeping  with who, or how many marriages somebody has had, but as far as I'm
concerned  it's totally irrelevant. I'm really very normal and there is nothing
sensational to  uncover. I wouldn't talk about some private things to my mother
so why should I to  anybody else.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless one still feels impelled to broach the subject of sex,
especially as  many of her songs seem to incorporate underlying sexual themes. 
</P>
<P>According to Kate: &quot;I think music and love are very similar. They're
both natural  energies, they have the same kind of all-embracing freedom, the
elation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The communication of music if very like making love. If you play a
piano, for  example, you're so united it's really a beautiful thing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now 22-years-old, the singer has accomplished almost everything the pop
world  has to offer except in the U.S.A. as yet. She has performed at the
Palladium, made  frequent appearances in the charts, and been given almost every
major award  available. 
</P>
<P>POWER PLAY 
</P>
<P>A new album due out next week has been held back for three months by EMI 
since they regard it with such importance that they did not want it's appearance
to  clash with other major releases this year by Paul McCartney and the Rolling
Stones. 
</P>
<P>When we arranged to meet this week one could feel the power-play of the 
record business grinding into action as a car whisked one off to her hotel to
meet  the singer on her return from a television appearance in Germany. 
</P>
<P>While she remarks that she has felt more grown up of late, she has always 
appeared untouched by the pressures and difficulties that can accompany fame and
 fortune. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I can see why people do have nervous breakdowns and so on, but it all
depends  on the person rather than what you happen to be doing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes I have felt that I'm losing control and that it's all
running away with  me, but all I have to do then is say to myself 'well leave
then, give it up' and I know  I never would because my life is really music and
I love it so much. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I would like to survive like people like Cliff Richard or Paul
McCartney. If you  look at them they're so strong and solid and happy, they'll
be able to go on for as  long again as they have already. They're happy because
they're doing exactly what  they want.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One particular buffer against the outside world would seem to be the Bush 
family. Her father, a former family doctor, and her three [three?] brothers are 
involved in different levels of her career. 
</P>
<P>FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
<P>One brother, Paddy, plays an assortment of instruments on her new album,
while  Novercia Ltd., the company that has been formed to look after her
interests, has no  fewer then five Bush family members as directors. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm lucky to have a family I love who can give me advice when I need
it. I like  to think of myself as director of the force, but I'm not a business
woman, for  example, and when it comes to legal jargon I need some help. 
</P>
<P>&quot;They're obviously people I trust and not just motivated by money,
because if  they wanted some, I'd give it to them anyway. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Right at the beginning they weren't that involved, though they were
always  interested. It's just been something that's evolved as there has become
a need for it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My parents weren't keen on me giving up school at the beginning to go
into  singing and dancing, but once they saw I was serious about it they gave
support. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was quite stubborn about my decision and in the end they realised it
was for  the best.&quot;
