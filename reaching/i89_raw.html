nov 29. 1989) 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush interview from RAW 
</P>
<P>(from issues 32, nov. 15 and 33, nov 29. 1989) 
</P>
<P>For more than ten years, Kate Bush has woven her siren-like spell over a
nation.  While she may polarise opinion, of one thing there can surely be no
doubt: She is a  quite extraordinary artist. Love her or loathe her, her skill,
her artistry are beyond  question. Her latest album 'The Sensual World', finds
Ms. Bush exploring herself  and the world around her with an openness she has,
till now, shied away from. It is a  record of mystery and secret pleasure, like
a children's hiding place to which we  have been granted access. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush reveals herself to us through a gauzy veil but, if we work hard
and  listen carefully, we can gain a fascinating and compulsive insight into
this reclusive  artist. It would be churlish, indeed, to refuse such an
invitation. 
</P>
<P>Kate first invited us into her then make-believe world in 1978. In January
that  year EMI released 'Wuthering Heights', the debut single from the girl they
signed  while she was still at school, at the suggestion of Pink Floyd
guitarist/vocalist Dave  Gilmour, a family friend. He paid for her to record a
demo which he then shopped  to EMI. The label bit the bullet and paid for her to
study music, dance and drama. 
</P>
<P>Two years later EMI reaped the benefit of their investments as 'Wuthering 
Heights' went to number one. The single and it's high pitched, squeaky delivery 
annoyed me so much that I went out and bought her subsequent album, 'The Kick 
Inside'. On hearing the Whale-song intro to 'Saxophone song' and the haunting 
delights of 'The Man With The Child In His Eyes', I decided a hasty
re-evaluation  was in order. 
</P>
<P>Since then Kate Bush has released another five studio albums and one 
compilation, 'The Whole Story', all of which, with the exception of her second
LP  ('Lionheart' - 1978), have reached the top five in the charts. 
</P>
<P>She also conducted a solitary UK tour in the spring of 1979. The London show
(at  the Palladium) was filmed and subsequently released on video for those of
us  unlucky enough to have missed out on the experience. Since then we have had
to  content ourselves with Ms. Bush's eclectic and erratic output, and a
collection of  superbly crafted, not to mention erotic, videos, which have
served to further enhance  the mystery. 
</P>
<P>With 'The Sensual World' Kate Bush draws back this veil. Unlike her previous
 work, wherein she might adopt a character to portray a situation - as in 
'Cloudbusting' from HoL or virtually the whole of 1980's 'Never for Ever' - on
this  album she comes perilously close to autobiography. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think this is my most personal album so far,&quot; she confesses,
hesitantly. &quot;I think  other albums have been ... I can't think of the word.
Maybe I haven't been  prepared to be as honest as I feel I have been on this
album. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not that there's autobiographical stuff in there. It's not that
the songs are  about me, but it feels - this time anyway - more honest, more ...
I feel I've been  braver about what I'm trying to say. Although I'm sure it is
still quite hidden.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And Kate Bush is a master of disguise. But maybe this time around she feels 
secure enough to allow her art to act as her own defence. Art as self-analysis?

</P>
<P>&quot;It's the most honest you can be in some ways, but it's also your
shield, because  you're hiding behind it. And yet this itself is something
you've put out there. Isn't  that wonderfully ironic?&quot; 
</P>
<P>There's a sense of irony, too, in Kate Bush, a woman loved and adored by the
 masses, writing a song as moving yet emotionally void as 'Deeper Understanding&quot;.
 The song postulates an affair between a computer hacker and a programme 
obtained through an advertisement. The horror of it is that this love could be
the  closest the hacker knows to the real thing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think more and more we're becoming isolated. We don't have healthy
human  contact, we spend the entire day with machines, all of us. And I do think
that human  beings are getting lonely. There's a lot of unhappy people in our
modern world. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You must know these people, who spend all night in this crazy
relationship they  have with their computers. Their wives want to divorce them
because they're in  there all night with the computer. And it was an idea born
out of something so cold,  so inhuman, so unfeeling as this computer buff
sending off for a programme he sees  in a magazine. He puts it in - and suddenly
this programme almost becomes a being,  like the voices of angels, a visitation.
And it's the idea that this could actually happen  through a computer, that
someone can get the most real love they've ever  experienced from the most
unexpected source. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose in some ways one of the inspirations for that ... have you
ever heard of  a guy called Steven Hawking?* I recently saw an interview with
him on television; it  was so beautiful, that's the impression I was left with.
It was this really moving  notion of a guy who's body is deteriorating, but his
mind and soul are so alive.  Hearing him speak through his voice processor, for
me it was the closest thing I've  heard to God speaking. Because some of the
things he was saying were pure science,  but it was as if he'd gone right
through science and onto the spiritual level. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't have a 'downer' on computers at all, I think they're really
good and  very important. And I also feel there's this really strong spiritual
age that's going to  hit us soon and it will be very much due to computers,
because of the pure way they  can break things down. Also I think they can teach
us a lot about ourselves; We've  never been in the position of having something
else through which to look back at  ourselves. But they are encouraging humans
not to have as much contact as they  should have, not to be as affectioate as
they should be. We should really try to  develop our priorities as people.&quot;

</P>
<P>Kate Bush has realigned her priorities too. She is a serious artist, but has
come to  the realisation that, in the end, &quot;It's only a record&quot;. When
it comes to the creation of  that art, however, she is deeply serious. 'The
Sensual World' took four years of  musical experimentation to issue forth. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Some of those experiments just didn't work, so there wasn't any point
carrying  on with them. Most of them are still lying on pieces of tapes and
things. I don't  know, I might go back to some of them. 
</P>
<P>&quot;'Love and Anger' was a track that we did early on, but I got fed up
with it and  must've left it for two years. And then I thought: 'Well, maybe
I'll go back to it'.  So I dug the song out, but still it nearly didn't go on
the album because I wasn't  happy at all. The tune was there, I just couldn't
get any lyrics or work out what to  do with the instruments. I just didn't know
what I wanted to say. Really, it was a  bugger, that song. And in some ways I
still don't know what I'm wanting to say.  But what the hell ...&quot; 
</P>
<P>She trails off, still doubtful. But as for the message contained on the
album she is  more sure: &quot; If I'm saying anything, it's that if people are
having a hard time and  things look really dark and it seems like you can't get
out, then try not to worry too  much. It'll be alright, someone will come and
help.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So what does the seemingly autobiographical &quot;...Sensual World&quot;
reveal about Kate  Bush, this shy, almost intensely retiring creature? She
presents to the world a  delicate face of near egg-shell fragility. It would
take a harder man than I to  brutally penetrate tha facade hoping to uncover the
source within. But Kate Bush is  also impeccably honest, apparently incapable of
guile. Can the woman who has  woven such intricate and complex spells be so
ingenuous? I think the answer has to  be ...Yes. 
</P>
<P>She speaks slowly, carefully plucking her words from the air, ever concious
of the  fact that her conversation is being recorded, subsequently to be turned
into print.  This caution comes as a result of an early, overanxious courting of
the press, only  later to be substituted by suspicion as she began to appreciate
how much she was  selling herself rather than her music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wne through a period when I didn't actually speak to anyone at all,
or if I did I  was very careful about when I did it and who I spoke to. And I
think two very  important things came out of that... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Firstly, I think I achieved what I wanted - suddenly my music started
speaking  for me instead of this personality whom the press had tremendous
preconceptions  about anyway. And through that I think people took my music more
seriously. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And secondly, it created this sense of mystery about what I did; I
think that  helped a lot as well with the way people were ready to receive my
music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So the courtship between Kate Bush and the music press came to an end. Now 
she is much more selective about who she will talk to. The release of a new 
necessitates some contact. But it isn't intimate contact, its only second-hand.
Only  once, a decade ago, did Kate Bush expose herself to the intimacy of
physical contact  with her audience when she toured the UK. Since then she has
refused all offers,  not to mention pleas from her fans to repeat the process.
Is this reluctance on her  part due to a fear of giving too much of herself
away? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Ooh, is that deep! I think you're absolutely right. I loved touring,
but it left me  completely exhausted. Not necessarily at that stage, because I
was going from the  road straight into recording another album, but I did reach
a point a couple of years  after where I felt incredibly exposed. I felt really
vulnerable...and I didn't like it.  And, yes, I wanted to get those pieces of me
back that I felt had been taken away. 
</P>
<P>&quot;For me, that's what this type of exposure did - it made me feel like
I'd lost  pieces of myself. That I'd become a public person, and the private
person - and  that's who I really am - was actually getting very frightened and
lost. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think this is a problem for any famous person, particularly for
creative famous  people. Creativity and sensitivity are very similar and you do
have to be very, very  strong. It doesn't surprise me at all that people go mad
or become incredibly  addicted to things. Becuase it's the psychological
pressure of what happens to you  when you're famous. Everyone sees the glamour,
the fact that you have fame, lots of  money, riches - it's all incredibly
superficial stuff. Money is no longer a problem,  it's more the psychological
pressures which come in when you get famous that  crack people up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And Kate Bush is not about to crack up. She has matured, her outlook has 
changed, she has become less introspective. So is she happier in herself? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think when I was younger I really liked what I felt I was trying to
do. Here  was the young songwriter, ha! You know, when you're young you have
that thing  that you're aiming for, hopefully. It might be five or six things -
mine just happened  to be one, namely making a record. And you can feel quite
proud of yourself for  achieving things like that; you set yourself a goal and
achieve it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Now, though, I think as a person I'm less obsessive, and that
realisation was a  terribly important step for me. Because, although when I
start an album I'm still  incredibly obsessive - no-one can come near me! -
although I do all the work on the  album, it's not everything now. And I think
at some point, it was - my work was  everything because it had such a sense of
importance about it. That's so stupid, so  blown out of proportion, and if
you're not careful that spiralling effect can make you  believe what you're
doing is the most important thing in the world! Ha! When it's  absolutely not
all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>For an artist like Kate Bush this is a quite extra-ordinary admission, ie.
that her  work - while internally important - is externally not the be-all-and
-end-all of  existance. But she has arrived at this conclusion after more than
ten years in the  limelight. During that time her relationship with her audience
has remained  nebulous. Kate Bush claims to neither know nor understand her
audience. But she  knows they are there, and it amazes her. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm continually surprised by how nice those people are. Not that I
would expect  them to be horrible, but for people to take the time to write to
you and say: 'Are  you alright. We don't want to hassle you or anything but the
album has been a long  time coming and we just want to check that you are
alright? Are you working on an  album or have you done something else? Whatever
you're doing we just hope  you're alright.' I think that's fantastic, it's so
affectionate, it's such an incredible  thing to do for someone that you don't
even know. But presumably they feel  something for my music that makes them feel
affectionate like that towards me. And  I think that's absolutely incredible,
very moving. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I find the whole process completely extraordinary. The fact is that
the last time I  toured was ten years ago, yet people are still asking me
whether I'm going to tour  again. Why on earth haven't they given up? Why are
they so patient with me? Why  do they even care? 
</P>
<P>&quot;And not to do an album for four years... for all those people knew I
could've  been off in the Bahamas, flying private jets. They didn't know I was
actually in a  studio, working hard.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush has emerged from those four years of rather intense
self-examination  with an album of quite extraordinary warmth, depth and power.
She has also come  to terms with herself and her art, recognising and accepting
the limitations that  imposes on her. Now, perhaps for the first time in her
life, she feels ready and able  to reveal certain other facets of her character.
