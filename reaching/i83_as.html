<P>The Kate Connection 
</P>
<P>by Abby Sheffield 
</P>
<P>C. 1983 
</P>
<P>This interview was printed in BREAKTHROUGH 5, I don't know if it is 
originally from there or another source. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill, thanks to Jackie Zucconi for supplying me with the
 interview.] 
</P>
<P> At the highest level, a transatlantic phone connection can be &quot;the
next best thing  to being there&quot;, and at the worst; a near disaster.
Amplified buzzing, humming, and  other disturbing effects can put a damper on
the most intriguing of conversations. So  when Kate Bush placed a song to this
Stateside writer, apprehension was being  developed at both ends. The anxiety
was quickly dissipated, however, when Kate's  charming accent clipped through
the line, with hardly a disturbance to bother with. 
</P>
<P>We rapidly adjust to the five hour time difference between us and begin to 
converse; naturally about her and the music she creates. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm concerned with promoting the music. I'm not really concerned with 
promoting me.&quot; she professes. 
</P>
<P>The statement is an accurate one. Whatever information is discovered about
this  25 year old singer-songwriter-producer, must be learned from interviews,
or more  importantly, from the music itself. 
</P>
<P>1978 was an auspicious year for Ms. Bush. Records being played most often on
 British airwaves, during that time, were mostly banal and inane. The initial
reaction  to her debut single, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was one of
incredulousness. How did this  young upstart get to challenge musical stalwarts,
anyway? After a couple of listens  &quot;Heights&quot; became firmly entrenched
in the minds of the record buying public and  speedily soared right to the top
of the charts. The whirlwind journey of the single,  and later The Kick Inside,
her album debut, triggered other enticing prospects for  the deserving
songstress. The star making machinery was in full sing and Kate went  'round and
'round. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wanted people to like my music&quot; she recalls. &quot;It was
fantastic that people  received it so well. My schedule was full, and I had so
much to think about. I went  to Australia, Japan, Europe. In between from coming
back from Japan and going to  Australia, I recorded the second album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The smell of success was sweet, but problems sometimes developed to thwart 
Kate from her ascension to the top of the heap. Decisions made were not
necessarily  the correct ones. 
</P>
<P>Reflecting on her choice to record a second album hot on the tracks of her
initial  smash, &quot;That's the only time I'd ever been in that situation,
though that's how I  wished it to be. I feel it's not good to be releasing an
album between promoting  another album. The success of the first album was so
great, that I couldn't ignore  the opportunity of pushing that success. When
you've got something like that, you  can't remain there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate subsequent releases outlined her continued evolvement into new
territory.  Lionheart, Never For Ever, and most recently The Dreaming, could be
compared  more to journeying into uncharted waters than following a well trailed
path. You  won't find this lady altering her style to suit the average Joe. A
quick spin through  one of her discs will prove this out. What's forcefully
apparent is that she refuses to  be bullied into playing it safe. 
</P>
<P>Kate's situation seems to be more the exception than the rule. Many
corporate  head tend to champion high chart positions and balk at the mention of
artistic  freedom. To parlay some of that artistic freedom into big bucks may be
what some  executives dream about, but scarcely expect. 
</P>
<P>No matter. The connection between Kate and her label is real peachy. A
carefully  crafted bunch of songs are handed over periodically and are
eventually released to  the waiting public. 
</P>
<P>Admittedly Kate has more razzle dazzle success in her native England than in
 North America. The mass sterilization of today's radio doesn't leave much room
for  esoteric offerings, however good they are. 
</P>
<P>What propels the serious music listener to plunk down the cash for one her 
albums anyway? 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I could actually pin down the quality that enables me to keep
working and  keep people enjoying it, I wouldn't worry very much. Whenever I
make an album I  do everything I can to make sure, within the time allowed, is
that every song is as  good as I possibly can make it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There's been many printed works assembled regarding Kate and her career, but
 The Dreaming becomes the focal point since it's the latest of her releases. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Many people keep finding new things within The Dreaming,&quot; offers
Kate. &quot;I'm  really surprised that people are letting that happen to them.
By the third of fourth  time of listening to it, they will hear some of the
things that we've pu there in  layers. Some of my favorite experiences are
listening to albums. When you start  listening to it a few times you start
hearing things that you've never heard before.  It's a great compliment.&quot; 
</P>
<P>O.K., Kate and I have been discussing matters for at least an hour. My
editor  would be chagrinned lest I omit a much requested matter. We've all been
milling  about, waiting for something new. When will Kate comply? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm about halfway done,&quot; she volunteers. &quot;I'm very pleased
with the songs that  I've got so far. I think they're different then the last
album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Pressing further on this matter elicits this response. &quot;I'm only about
halfway  done. The other songs could be dramatically different. I always feel
wary about  talking before anything is completed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We'll keep you posted.
