	 <P>The record, debuting in the U.S., was #1 for some time in Australia and
		the U.K. Bush's voice is most unusual but continued listening and the lovely
		hook should endear it to pop and adult audiences alike. EMI America P-8003.</P>

	 <P>Produced by Andrew Powell</P>
	 <P>Bush is a pretty ,18-year-old discovered by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.
		The perky young songstress just topped the English chart with her sweeping
		"Wuthering Heights" ,in which she based the song along the lines of the novel.
		Bush has a flair for writing evocative lyrics about varied subjects. And
		helping in its delivery are her smooth and unrestrained vocals which appear to
		take on a squeaky child-like intonation. And it's effective. Sound instrumental
		backing by Bush's band puts the point across.</P>
	 <P>Best Cuts: "Wuthering Heights " "Moving" "James And The Cold Gun", "Them
		Heavy People" </P>
	 <P>Dealers: Bush is a promising writer/ performer.</P>

	 <P>The Kick Inside<BR> Kate Bush<BR> Capitol (ST 11761)</P> 
	 <P> Mary Hopkin meets Emily Bronte, Laura Nyro discovers reggae, Joan
		Armatrading masquerades as Joni Mitchell -- comparisons with other vocalists
		are inevitable, but Kate Bush won't be stuck with them for long. Bush is an
		original; she bends oblique imagery into harmony with frank questions, skitters
		in and out of character roles and often pairs a munchkin falsetto with
		charmingly shameless Iyrics.</P> 
	 <P> The chorus of "Feel It" is more erotic than any of Rod Stewart's crude
		suggestions or Donna Summers' pathetic panting; the mounting tension and
		banshee vocal on "Wuthering Heights" is more effective than all those freaky
		teenage death-love songs of the '60s combined.</P> 
	 <P> Kate's singing is decidedly delicately unsettling; her musicians are
		careful not to tromp their fullbodied arrangements over it. Sometimes her
		phrasing has the sophistication of a jazz singer's, her delivery joyfully
		percussive; sometimes Bush's childish enunciation slides into lullaby. She's
		artificially sweet and nearly punk with "James and the Cold Gun" elated but
		tremulous an "Kite." A misplaced accent or awkward line occasionally betray her
		control of her gifts, but they should disappear with time.</P> 
	 <P> Bush's talent for soul-baring would be frightening were it not so
		ingenuous; she writes from a well of fantasy and feeling with a patina of
		experience, her concerns universal and womanly -- not the usual wilted kitten
		yearning or last-rave bathos. She embraces love, sex, creativity and freedom as
		experience, with all the emotional complications they entail and successfully
		pulls off a witchingly sly celebration of the menarche and women's intuition
		("Strange Phenomena").</P> 
	 <P> With a voice so eerie it's difficult to imagine Kate Bush as a popular
		taste but then she's already proved quite palatable in England. Sometimes
		strange is wonderful.</P>

	 <P> "...[Tom Robinson's] Glad to be Gay was a fine record, which brings me
		right back to the big record companies. Tom Robinson's 2-4-6-8 Motorway " was
		an example of Capitol Records being inefficient and losing that record in
		America along with the Kate Bush single and even Steve Harley's "Come Up And
		See Me". They don't seem able to break British records in America to save their

	 <P><A NAME="stereoreview">KATE BUSH:</A> UNCAGED BIRD (THE KICK INSIDE
		REVIEW) </P> 
	 <H3><A NAME="stereoreview">STEREO REVIEW</A><BR>1978<BR>by Peter Reilly
		</H3> 
	 <P>A lot of people are not going to like what they hear Kate Bush saying in
		her new album <EM>THE KICK INSIDE</EM>, about being a woman in the Seventies.
		And perhaps even more are going to object to the way she says it, for in many
		of her songs she treads on a territory (sex-as-sex-as-sex) long held to be a
		male preserve. She does so with the same brisk authority and self-possession
		that has characterized at least some British women since the days of Emmeline
		Pankhurst, suffragist-extraordinaire, and for this reason she will surely
		offend a great many men. </P> 
	 <P>But probably as many women will be equally upset by Kate Bush's candor
		and honesty, though for a much different reason, the gallingly accurate one
		given by Germaine Greer in her book "The Female Eunuch". Greer says that as far
		as women's rights and equality are concerned, they are an accomplished fact,
		that indeed for the last fifty years the cage has been open, <EM>but the bird
		has refused to fly out</EM>. Bush's frankness and sense of what a female friend
		of calls "gut nooky" will hardly endear her to those women who still cling to
		the perch while making complaining Tweetie-Pie denials of their own sexuality.
		</P> 
	 <P>What is different, however, about Kate Bush -- and what makes her songs
		important -- is not agitprop but excellence. With such songs as "Room For The
		Life", "Feel It", or "L'Amour Looks Something Like You", listeners know that
		they are in the presence of a real person, a real woman who lives in the
		here-and-now dealing with life as it is being lived, not as it is
		<EM>supposed</EM> to be lived in the perfume ads. Bush's females are fully as
		hungry as males are -- not in the angry, doomed, and rather dreary way of the
		romantic-gone-wrong of LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR, but simply as healthy, alive
		human beings with sensual and sexual appetites to satisfy. And they are as
		guiltless about expressing their hunger as most males have been for years. </P>
	 
	 <P>Consider this from "Feel It": "Feel your warm hand walking around/ I
		won't pull away, my passion always wins/ So keep on a-moving in, keep on
		a-tuning in/ Synchronize rhythmn now..." Or this from "L'Amour": "I'm dying for
		you just to touch me/ And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me/ L'Amour
		looks something like you." Bush performs these songs with a direct sincerity in
		an appealing, rather quavery, high-pitched voice that communicates not
		lubricity but the joy of satisfactory love-making. What we have here is not the
		eye-rolling lewdness of Xaviera Hollander (the greatest management consultant
		of modern times), the kinkiness of a Pauline Reage, or even the brittle comedy
		of sexual manners of an Erica Jong, but a human being telling about one aspect
		of her humanity. </P> 
	 <P>There is a great deal more to Kate Bush and her album than matters
		sexual, however, and aside from two clinkers -- "Wuthering Heights", a weary
		rehash about "cruel Heathcliff", and "James And The Cold Gun", a song about 007
		[not!] that seems as deliberately nonsensical as the plots of some of the Bond
		films -- all her songs have a lively sense of truth-telling about them. In the
		lovely "The Man With The Child In His Eyes", the protagonist confesses. "And
		here I am again my girl/ Wondering what on earth I'm doing here/ Maybe he
		doesn't love me/ I just took a trip on my love for him." Probably the strongest
		song in the album is "Room For The Life", which in one way is a call to those
		still-caged Tweetie-Pies and in another is a simple statement of the perils of
		freedom, liberation, and independence in the life of any Seventies woman:
		"NIght after night in the quiet house/ Plaiting her hair by the fire, woman/
		With no lover to free her desire/ How long do you think she can stick it out/
		How long do you think before she'll go out, woman/ Hey get up on your feet and
		go get it now/ Like it or not we keep bouncing back/ Because we're woman." </P>
	 
	 <P>Nobody's said it better than that in quite a while -- not even Katherine
		Hepburn, who was asked a few years ago if she missed having a home life because
		of the demands of her career and replied, "Well, we can't have it all, can we?"
		Kate Bush seems to know and to believe and, most important, to communicate that
		what women can have, if they are honest with themselves, is quite enough.
		You've come a long way, Emmeline baby! </P>
