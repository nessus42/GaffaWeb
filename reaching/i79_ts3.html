<P><STRONG>&quot;Wow! Wow! It's Raunchy Kate&quot; <BR> by Nina Myskow</STRONG></P>
<P>AMAZING! It's Kate Bush as you've never seen her before.</P>
<P>Powerful. Sensuous. Raunchy. And dangerous. </P>
<P>The Pop world's weird and wonderful little gipsy  has turned into a
gun-slinging, snaked-hipped  glamour girl.</P>
<P>A seductive siren with a deadly aim.</P>
<P>Kate, 20, recently packed out the London Palladlum  for a week.</P>
<P>Our exclusive pictures captured her during her European  tour, which is a
complete sell-out.</P>
<P>Her sensational &pound;150,000 show stuns and delights  audiences everywhere.</P>
<P>Little Miss Bush has blossomed into Britain's biggest female  superstar.</P>
<P>lt's rumoured that she has been offered one of the film world's  top prizes
-- recording the title track of the new Bond movie,  Moonraker.</P>
<P>How does she feel about her fame?</P>
<P>&quot;I certainly don't feel like a superstar,&quot; she says.  &quot;I'm
not really speclal. I'm just lucky that so many people  like what I'm doing.&quot;</P>
<P>Her hit records, like &quot;Wutherlng Heights&quot; (EMI) and  her latest
chart success, &quot;Wow&quot; do not prepare you  for her live show.</P>
<P><STRONG>Mood</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>It is a 2 1/2 hour spectacle, incorporating the most  imaginative use of
back-projection sets, lighting and  theatrical effects.</P>
<P>Each number is choreographed and has its own mood  and setting.</P>
<P>There is an excellent band, which includes Kate's brother,  Paddy, three
back-up singers, two male dancers and a  magician, Simon Drake.</P>
<P>But above all there is Kate. She dominates the stage with  her superb
dancing and bizarre interpretations of songs.</P>
<P>On stage, she is amazlng. Off-stage, it's a different matter.</P>
<P>She's just a polite, nice, sweet, ordnary, rather boring girl.</P>
<P>She talks with a funny little accent and her conversation is  peppered with &quot;Amazin',&quot;
&quot;t'rrific,&quot;  &quot;really, 'ever so fantastic.&quot;</P>
<P>Does she mind being an unsexy let-down to people who meet  her?</P>
<P>She shrugs it off.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't care,&quot; she says. &quot;That's falr enough.  People are
going to think what they want of you anyway.</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm not performing, I'm just a normal person.</P>
<P>&quot;And I'm going to stay that way.&quot;</P>
