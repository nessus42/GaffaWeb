Subject: NME article ca. 1982
</p>



<p>I've just been reading a xerox that a friend sent me of an article from the NME. 
I think it is circa 1983, and is strange in that it claims that the NME has been very 
unfair to Kate Bush and is almost an appology. Here are some interesting parts: 
</p>



<p>There is the school of thought that Kate Bush is for mums and dads. Freakily 
lovable. The ET of pop -- something to laugh at when females impersonate her on 
TV by donning explosions of brown wig, making stabbing motions with their hands, 
all the while wailing like a cat fight. 
</p>

<p>And there's a school who believe Kate Bush is &quot;profoundly subversive&quot;, like Fred 
Vermorel. 
</p>

<p>... 
</p>

<p>But among a younger generation, the school of thought seems to be that liking 
Kate Bush is about as hip as owning a set of Melanie albums or else that she is... 
*wonderful*. 
</p>

<p>Someone at EMI said: &quot;I've yet to see anyone sum Kate Bush up.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush said: &quot;The thing I don't like about NME is it seems so cynical...&quot; 
</p>

<p>Those are the two main problems. 
</p>

<p>It would be so easy to be horrible about Kate Bush. A hundred, even affectionate, 
jokes immediately come to mind. 
</p>

<p>The press tends to think Ms Bush is immune to satire, innuendo and downright 
rudeness. Somehow it's alright for Simon Bates to phone her up live on Radio 1 and 
bellow down the receiver about Kate's bank balance and sex life. The press can 
always say, &quot;fuck you, you turgid cretin&quot;, but a household name is trained to be 
polite. It's a shame. 
</p>

<p>But on the other hand, Kate Bush is enigmatic, and what do you do when you 
don't understand someone? Either attack them (&quot;Kate Bush is a spaced-out druid 
with lush tits...&quot; is a familiar cry), or build fantasies around them a la Fred 
Vermorel. 
</p>

<p>... 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush hit her artistic peak on 'The Dreaming' album. Yet sadly it was not 
recognized as an important or courageous album, and caused more confusion than 
fuss. The three singles taken from it, 'Sat In Your Lap', 'The Dreaming' and 
'There Goes A Tenner', were her finest ever and sounded to me like sure-fire 
radio hits. But the Radio 1 DJs (except David Jenson) tittered nervously, and 'The 
Dreaming' just about did the whole station in. 
</p>

<p>... 
</p>

<p>She is reluctant to do press because of bad experiences. She seems obsessed with 
doing things right, be it a performance or a photograph, and she does not seem 
afraid to wait. I find that a rare quality. 
</p>

<p>... 
</p>

<p>[From my interview with her] I've got only one clear impression of Kate Bush's 
personality: she's sweet. She wouldn't stomp a spider if was three inches wide and 
crawling through her hair; she wouldn't shout at anyone no matter how obnoxious 
they were being. I got the feeling that all the energy other 25 year olds might 
expend on being sassy, sexy and a minor hell-raiser in order to impress their 
personality on the world, for her is contained and released in her work. 
</p>

<p>... 
</p>

<p>She lacks the cynicism and mistrust of the 80s, yet she's got a single-mindedness 
that transgresses all the pitfalls of fashion and falling sales.
