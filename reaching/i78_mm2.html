<P>&quot;The Kick Outside&quot; 
</P>
<P>Interview with Kate Bush by Harry Doherty, Melody Maker, June 3, 1978 
</P>
<P>This week, friends, we find ourselves in a 350-year-old home enjoying the 
company of a girl called Kate Bush and a dog named Piggy. Outside, we have her 
doctor father's surgery and a barn-cum-studio, in a secluded Kent pastoral
setting. 
</P>
<P>This Kate Bush is 19 years old and a budding beauty, though she'd prefer it
if you  ignore the sex symbol stakes. She is exquisitely mannered and
articulate. In six short  months, via a single, &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot;
and album, &quot;The Kick Inside,&quot; both of  which stayed in the chart for
12 weeks, she has shed the anonymity of a beginner  and become, for want of a
better word, a star. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is doubtless the success of '78. Should you have difficulty in
swallowing  the talent of Ms. Bush, then consider that she counts many
established songwriters  and new wave leaders among her early fans. Bob Geldof,
not usually noted for  dishing out praise elsewhere, swears by her. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is taking a break from the arduous task of writing songs for her 
second album. It is not coming along too well. She is finding it a bit stifling
to write  to demand, but is sure that once the intenseness of sitting at her
piano returns, so  will the songs. 
</P>
<P>The trouble, of course, stems from the rush of acclaim that greeted &quot;The
Kick  Inside,&quot; which, with half a dozen examples of classic writing and
singing, was more a  sign of potential than actual realisation of it. &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; was the proverbial  smash, and suddenly the whole world went
crazy. Kate made a valiant and successful  attempt at keeping it all under
control. 
</P>
<P>The songs for the debut had been written over a period of three years.
Because  of a number of fortunate encounters, first an inheritance and then the
record  company (EMI) advance, she could concentrate solely on her writing and
dancing  without worrying about finance. 
</P>
<P>Dave Gilmour, of Pink Floyd, was impressed enough by her potential to put up
 the money for proper demos, and Andrew Powell, usually noted for his orchestral
 arrangements, stepped in to produce her album. With all the business taken care
of,  Kate was able to &quot;educate&quot; herself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Train myself for the ...ah...Coming, I guess. I really felt that I
wanted to get  some sort of bodily expression together to go with the music.
Music is a very  emotional thing, and there's always a message, and your purpose
as a performer is  to get it across to the people in as many ways as you can.&quot;

</P>
<P>The &quot;Coming&quot; came and Kate Bush took everybody by surprise,
including herself  and EMI, by breaking through immediately. She had insisted
that &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot; be the first single, as much for business
reasons as artistic ones. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I felt that to actually get your name anywhere, you've got to do
something that is  unusual, because there's so much good music around and it's
all in a similar vein. It  was, musically, for me, one of my strongest songs. It
had the high pitch and it also  had a very English story-line which everyone
would know because it was a classic  book.&quot; 
</P>
<P>EMI had wanted to go with another track, &quot;James and the Cold Gun,&quot;
a more  traditional rock'n'roll song. But Kate was reluctant, just as they were
with the new  single, &quot;The Man With the Child In His Eyes,&quot; which,
musically, is a complete  contrast to her first hit. The record company would
have opted for a more obvious  follow-up in &quot;Them Heavy People.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I so want &quot;The Man With the Child In His Eyes&quot; to do well.
I'd like people to  listen to it as a songwriting song, as opposed to something
weird, which was the  reaction to 'Wuthering Heights.' That's why it's
important. If the next song had  been similar, straight away I would have been
labeled, and that's something I really  don't want. As soon as you've got a
label, you can't do anything. I prefer to take a  risk.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The relationship with EMI has been good. Kate has been astonished that
they've  allowed her so much say. But she was very insistent that she should be
involved in  every facet of her career, to the point where, at such a young age,
she had almost  been self-managed, with help from friends and family. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always had an attitude about managers. Unless they're really
needed, they  just confuse matters. They obviously have their own impressions of
a direction and  an image that is theirs, and surely it should come from within
the actual structure  rather than from outside. I often think that generally
they're more of a hindrance  than a help.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ideally, she would like to exert control over every area to ensure that she
is  projected as she wants to be. Strangely, very strangely, the pressure and
frightening  newness of the music business hasn't upset her at all, and she
reveals shyly that she  somehow feels she has been through it all before. &quot;I
wonder if it has to do with the  concept of time in some way, in that everything
you do, you've done before.&quot; (Refer  to &quot;Strange Phenomena,&quot; on &quot;The
Kick Inside.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>For her, there is an unreal aspect to all that's happened. That she has had
a  number one single, a gold album, television appearances, interviews,
attention . She  has held a reasonable balance throughout and generally got
through all the hub-bub  as she would have liked. Disasters were her first
television appearances in Germany  and England, on Top of the Pops. &quot;It was
like watching myself...die. It was a bloody  awful performance.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I remember watching with some shock when she appeared on Saturday Night at 
the Mill, hardly the most inspiring rock programme, and thinking those people 
didn't have a clue what she was about. To them she was a curvey little girl who 
contorted her figure erotically to a song they didn't give a damn about. Another
 weird programme to do was Tonight. Both, Kate points out, were at peak viewing 
time. 
</P>
<P>She doesn't know how ended up on them. They probably phoned EMI, but there 
was no way she would be averse to appearing on programmes like that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was reaching an audience that was a little wider-spread, and that's
incredible.  That's what I'm really into. I'm into reaching more than the
ordinary market  because I think it's very...not snobby, but something similar,
when you're choosing  your public, and I think your public should choose you and
you should get to as  many people as you can, so that as many people as possible
can choose you. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm reaching people that have maybe had a totally different life from
me and  are well ahead of me in many standards, but yet they're accepting me. A
lot of  older people won't listen to pop music because they have a biased idea
of what it is,  and that's wrong because a lot of them would really get into
some of the music  that's around. It's not all punk, and if you can get music to
them that they like, then  you're achieving something. You're getting into
people's homes who have been shut  off from that sort of music for years.
They're into their Bach...'Bach is wonderful,  but I don't like that pop music.'

</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe they do, but they're never given the option. They're always
given the  music that people might think they like. But I think they're really
into exploring.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She would, then, like to be more than just a young people's musician? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd really like to think that there is no age barrier because that's a
shame, and  I'd like to think that there's a message in my music for everyone.
That's the  greatest reward I could get -- to get different people getting into
different tracks. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It really means a lot to think that I'm not just hitting on an area
that may be just  identified with me, that people are actually identifying with
what the songs are  about. I'm really not sure where my music is hitting,
although I think it is mainly  hitting younger people.&quot; 
</P>
<P>All of this involvement -- she'd also like to learn to produce -- mounts up.
At  times, the pressure must be unbearable, especially as all Kate's successes
have come  so fast. But no, she assures me again, the pressures don't come from
the hits. She  feels more pressure from the future, the fact that she has
another album to do and  there is so much to live up to. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a great challenge. There's always something good in whatever
pressure is  around. There's an incredible challenge, and if you can do it and
if you come out the  other side and even if you lose, you've done it. I think
that makes you stronger. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The songs for the first album were written over a two-to-three year
period, and  now I've got a two-to-three month period for this one. It's
ridiculous, and my  admiration for people like David Bowie and Elton John, and
Queen -- although I'm  not into their music -- grows all the time. It's
incredible how they do it. They do it  all. They record and tour and promote. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's awesome to me. Incredibly so. I mean, I'm on a little level
compared to  that. It amazes me that they can keep their brains in a logical
order without their  speech getting all tangled because there's so much going
on.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So what happens when you reach that situation? (There are plans to tour next
 year.) 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know how I'll cope, but when you're in the situation it's very
different.  I would have thought it impossible to do what I'm doing now a few
years ago, but  now I'm here, it doesn't seem that amazing because, really, it's
just doing your  work on whichever level it is, and I'm really lucky for all the
work I've been  given.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But you've not had to struggle? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, that's true, and it's a little frightening. There was only a
struggle within  myself. But even if your work is so important to you, it's not
actually your life. It's  only part of your life, so if your work goes, you're
still a human being. You're still  living. You can always get a job in
Woolworth's or something. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose I would find it very hard to let go because for me it's the
only thing  that I'm here to do. I don't really know what else I could do that I
would be  particularly good at. I could take a typing course, loads of things,
but I wouldn't  actually feel that I'd be giving anything. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think you can kid yourself into destiny. I have never done another
job. It's a  little frightening, because it's the only thing I've really
explored, but then again, so  many things are similar. They all tie in. I really
feel that what I'm doing is what  everyone else is doing in their jobs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's really sad that pressures are put on some musicians. It's
essential for them  to be human beings, because that's where all the creativity
comes from, and if it's  taken away from them and everybody starts kneeling and
kissing their feet and that,  they're gonna grow in the wrong areas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Everybody associates the whole star trip with material gains. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But it's wrong. Again, the only reason that you get such material
gains from it is  because it's so media-orientated. If it wasn't, you'd get the
same as a plummer. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I worry, of course, that it's going to burn out, because I didn't
expect it to  happen so quickly and it has. For me, it's just the beginning. I'm
on a completely  different learning process now. I've climbed one wall and now
I've got another  fifteen to climb, and to keep going while you're in such
demand is very hard. It  would be different if I had stayed unknown, because
then it would be progressing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is a frequently sensuous woman but she has no wish to be hooked as
a  sex symbol or anything concerned with selling her body (metaphorically
speaking) to  achieve ambitions. She has, for instance taken a meticulous
interest in EMI's  promotion campaign to ensure that the sex angle isn't played.

</P>
<P>&quot;The sex symbol thing didn't really occur to me until I noticed that in
nearly  every interview I did, people were asking: 'Do you feel like a sex
symbol?' It's only  because I'm female and publicly seen. The woman is tended to
be seen on that level  because it gets them through quicker, like the actress
who sleeps with the producer  makes it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That seems so dated, because we're all shifting to a different level
now. The  woman's position in music is really incredible now. It's getting more
and more  accepted, if not more than men at the moment. God, there's so many
females in the  charts. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I felt very flattered that those people should think of me in those
sex symbol  terms. That was my first reaction, but it can be very destructive.
For a start, there  are so many incredibly good-looking women around, and their
craft is in that.  They're either models or acting, so their physical image is
important. What I really  want to come across as is as a musician, and I think
that sort of thing can distract,  because people will only see you on a
superficial level.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She would like to think, too, that being female has nothing to do with her
success  and that she is being judged primarily as an artist. She has very
strong views on the  matter. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm at the piano writing a song, I like to think I'm a man, not
physically  but in the areas that they explore. Rock'n'roll and punk, you know,
they're both  really male music, and I'm not sure that I understand them yet,
but I'm really  trying. When I'm at the piano I hate to think that I'm a female
because I  automatically get a preconception. Every female you see at the piano
is either Lynsey  DePaul, Carole King...that lot. And it's a very female style.

</P>
<P>&quot;That sort of stuff is sweet and lyrical, but it doesn't push it on
you, and most  male music -- not all of it, but the good stuff --really lays it
on you. It's like an  interrogation. It really puts you against the wall, and
that's what I'd like to do. I'd  like my music to intrude. It's got to. I think
that anything you do that you believe in,  you should club people over the head
with it! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not many females succeed with that. Patti Smith does, but that's
because she  takes a male attitude. I'm not really aware of it as a male
attitude. I just think I  identify more with male musicians than female
musicians, bucause I tend to think of  memale musicians as...ah... females. It's
hard to explain. I'd just rather be a male  songwriter than a female. What it
is, basically, is that all the songwriters I admire  and listen to are male.&quot;

</P>
<P>She loves Steely Dan and David Bowie (&quot;I wish I could write
constructions like  his.&quot;) But she was probably most influenced by Bryan
Ferry, during his days with  Roxy Music and Eno. &quot;It was the moods of the
songs. They had a very strong effect  on me, because that had such atmospheres.

</P>
<P>&quot;I really enjoy some female writers, like Joni Mitchell, but it's just
that I feel  closer to male writers. Maybe I want to be a man,&quot; she laughs.
&quot;I like the guts than  men have in performing and singing --like the punks.
Like the way Johnny Rotten  would use his voice was so original, and you get
very few females even having the  guts to do that, because they unfortunately
tend to get stereotyped if they make it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really enjoy seeing people doing something that isn't normal, you
know. It's so  refreshing. It's like that guy, you know, 'Cor baby, that's
really free.' John Otway.  It was amazing watching him perform and you just
don't get females like that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What surprised me most about Kate, and it shouldn't have because she's only 
nineteen, was her awareness of the new wave. She seemed to regard new wave 
bands as contemporaries, and her comments about those bands in relation to her 
work seems to emphasise that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't regard myself as a rock'n'roll writer. I'd love it if someone
said they  thought I wrote rock'n'roll songs. That'd be great, but I don't think
I am. Some of  the punk and new wave songs are so clever. Quite amazing, really.
It's a modern  poetry idiom. Some of the lyrics are fantastic, so imaginative,
not sticking to a reality  level, shooting off and coming back again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She mentioned the Boomtown Rats as &quot;amazing&quot; and was genuinely
ecstatic when  I told her of the Rats' fondness for her music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Do they? Really? Oh, I didn't think they'd be into me. Great!
Fantastic! I  wonder if really beautiful punk groups like that -- I think the
Stranglers are really  good, too, there are so many -- I wonder if they think
I'm...not so much square, but  whether they think... ah...square...Sort of
oblong. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really admire those bands, and I really admired the Sex Pistols
tremendously. I  don't know if I liked them that much, but some of their songs
were great. I  admired them so much just for the freshness and the guts,
although I did get a hypey  vibe off it, and that they were in fact being pushed
around, because it seemed more  an image that was being forced upon them, from
what people were expecting. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I feel apart from those bands, because I feel I'm in a different area,
but I really  like to think that they get off on me like I do them. That's why I
don't see them as  contemporaries, because I'm apart. It's not a matter of being
above or below them,  but if it was, I think I'd be below them. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think they're on a new level, inasmuch as...it's hard to explain.
They're  definitely hitting people that need stimulation. They're hitting tired,
bored people  that want to pull their hair out and paint their face green.
They're giving people the  stimulation to do what they want, and I think I'm
maybe just making people think  about it, if I'm doing anything.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you see that as the main difference between your role and others'? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah. I'm probably, if anything, stimulating the emotional end, the
intellect, and  they're stimulating the guts, the body. They're getting the
guts, jumping around.  That's a much more direct way to hit people. A punch is
more effective than a look.  Teachers always give you looks.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Would you like to have that effect on people? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think I could becase...&quot; She stumbles over the next bit. &quot;...it's
not  what...I'm...here to...do. I really love rock'n'roll. I think it's an
incredible force,  but there's something about it that I don't get on with when
I write it, maybe  because I'm very concerned about melodies in my music, and
generally I find  rock'n'roll tend to neglect it a bit because it's got so much
rhythm and voice that  you don't need so much music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Some of the new wave, though, is so melodic. Like the Rich Kids {early
 EMI-produced new wave band led by Midge Ure}. I'm not really a rock'n'roll 
writer yet. I'd like to be, though, and I hope I'll become more that way
orientated. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Mind you, I identify with new wave music. We're both trying to stir
something  in the attitudes we've got, but I honestly don't know if I'm doing
it. I guess I'm  more interested in stirring people's intellects. It's longer
lasting but not so much  fun as new wave. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The good thing about people like the Boomtown Rats is that not only is
it really  good, but it's really exciting and fun, and maybe my things are
sometimes a bit too  intricate to become fun. They're more picking pieces out
and examining them.  There's very little music on my album that will make you
want to stamp your feet  violently and hit your head against the wall. 
</P>
<P>&quot;To actually understand what I'm about you have to hear the lyrics,
which is a lot  to expect; whereas in something like the Boomtown Rats, it's the
complete energy  that knocks you over.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Would it upset you if you missed the mark, and people totally misread what 
you're about? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a lot, to expect people to sit down and read my lyrics, and I'd
be amazed if  many people did. Not many people read poetry, and it's a similar
effort. No, it  doesn't worry me that much if they don't. That's what I'd like
them to do because  that's why I do it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But really, I think I've had enough response from people to make me
have done  enough to fade away now. I've had much more of a chance than most
people to get  through with a message. From some of the letters I get, it seems
that people have  understood, and it seems to have helped them a bit. That's all
I could wish for.&quot;
