Subject: The Music Journal by Robert Henschen, Dec. 1978 
</P>
<P>The Music Journal interview 
</P>
<P>&lt; This article was written by Robert Henschen and appeared in the U.S.
magazine  Music Journal in December 1978. All the quotes from Kate, and some of
Henschen's  own observations, are derived from the EMI promotional article
(included above)  and from the interview LP produced for radio promotion
purposes in the same year.  Edited by Andrew Marvick.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: She'll crush the lily in your soul 
</P>
<P>At age sixteen, with some dozen-and-a-half songs already self-penned, Kate
Bush  learned that was not yet ready for music stardom...she had to wait two
more years.  So, while continuing to compose unusual tunes on an old honky-tonk
piano, Kate  studied mime and modern dance with David Bowie's former mentor
Lindsay Kemp  and then at The Dance Centre in London's Covent Garden. 
</P>
<P>She also read, and wrote a song about, Emily Bronte's classic English novel 
Wuthering Heights, subsequently topping the British charts with this her very
first  record. Wuthering Heights made full use of the Bush voice...a deceptively
frail,  slightly bizarre tool of surprising range and unearthly expressiveness.
The song's  repeating chorus-hook seemed to transcend the imposing barrier
between catchy  pop music and artistic progressiveness. In short, Wuthering
Heights was a great song  that found Kate playing the role of heroine Cathy
Earnshaw, and the European press  promptly made Kate Bush their new discovery.
Holland's recording industry  awarded her an Edison (the equivalent of our
Grammy) for Single of the Year, Music  Week magazine called her the Top Female
Album Artist, and high praises are still  rolling in. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I loved writing it,&quot; Kate enthuses regarding the song. &quot;It
was a real challenge to  process the whole mood of a book into such a short
piece of prose. Also, when I was  a child I was always called Cathy, not Kate,
and I just found myself able to relate to  her as a character. It's so important
to put yourself in the role of the person in a  song. There's no half ways. When
I sing that song I am Cathy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I first read Wuthering Heights I thought the story was so strong.
This  young girl in an era when the female role was so inferior and she was so
inferior,  and she was coming out with this passionate, heavy stuff...Great
subject matter for a  song. I wrote the song from Cathy's standpoint. Cathy
wants to take Heathcliff's  soul so that they can be together in their spiritual
world.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Released in the U.S. several months ago, Kate's album The Kick In-side has
not  achieved overwhelming success in the States as of yet, but that may soon
change.  The album has been reissued with a new album cover, and impressive AOR
radio  support has been building for Kate's remarkable music. Almost every cut
on the  debut record is equal to, or even better than, Wuthering Heights .
There's an impish  quality to Kate's singing on the quasi-reggae Room For the
Life, she almost sounds  like a munchkin on Oh To Be in Love, her voice soaring
above the wicked witch's  guardsman...And she reveals more dramatic profiles on
the near-jazz Saxophone  Song or the serious, moving Man With the Child in His
Eyes . 
</P>
<P>This latter piece, about the relationship developed between a young girl and
an  older man, is a showcase for the singer's subtle and sensitive imagery. &quot;She
sees this  man as an all-consuming figure,&quot; explains Kate. &quot;He's wise,
yet he retains a certain  innocent quality. The song tells how his eyes give
away his 'inner light'. He's a very  real character to the girl, but nobody else
knows whether he really exists.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Appearances on European television programs like Top of the Pops, Saturday 
Night at the Mill and Tonight helped launch Bush, still new to performing, into
a  sudden spotlight...and more than a little controversy. Her act is a sensual 
combination of dance and dramatic vocal presentations, her body not exactly
hidden  in a flesh-colored body stocking, and some viewers apparently found Kate
to be  erotically shocking or in bad taste. Even Kate cringes at the thought of
those first,  unpracticed attempts at visual communication. She has since
learned to handle live  performing more effectively, touring England to
widespread acclaim. &lt;This is not a  reference to her Tour of Life, but to
earlier promotional tours abroad.&gt; Ms. Bush is  something stunningly
different to see...as well as hear. 
</P>
<P>With or without the sensationalism surrounding her good looks and offbeat 
performing style, Kate writes music of incredible depth. Just as her dawning
public  image comes up displaying the physical woman, so do her amazing lyrics
bespeak  100% twentieth-century female. Seldom, if ever, has the feminine
standpoint been  more boldly and beautifully stated, and songs like Room For the
Life, Strange  Phenomena or Feel It penetrate directly to new depths of
corporeal and spiritual  realization. 
</P>
<P>Some of the poetry herein is unexpurgated and erotic; other portions take an
 inanimate pose to evoke new feelings from the listener. 
</P>
<P>For instance, Kate creates a flying feeling for Kite, a song that exhibits
her  songwriting knack for approaching a subject in some refreshingly original
way: &quot;In  the song the character starts to feel that he is rooted to the
ground, but there is a  force pulling him up to the sky. A voice calls out,
'Come up and be a kite,' and he  is drawn up to the sky and takes the form and
texture of a kite. Suddenly he's  flying 'like a feather on the wind,' and for a
while he enjoys it, but the longing for  home and the security of the ground
overtake these feelings.&quot; Just as Kate becomes  Cathy Earnshaw in Wuthering
Heights she assumes the role of a young sister in The  Kick Inside (inspired by
the traditional folk song Lucy Wan ) who, after a tragically  incestuous
relationship with her own brother, leaves this incredibly sad and hopeful 
farewell note. Intriguing song-poem ideas. 
</P>
<P>How did Kate Bush learn to write brilliant songs of such unnerving
emotionalism  and intelligence at such an early age? &quot;I just grew up with
music all around me.  When I was about eleven I just started poking around at
the piano and started  making up little songs. I never played Beatle songs or
anything like that. I was always  just exploring the instrument. Then, when I
was fourteen, I started taking it  seriously and I began to treat the words to
the songs as poetry. I'd always been keen  on poetry at school and it was lovely
to put the poems together with the music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have two older brothers and they were very keen on musical
instruments. One  day, along comes this friend of my brother's &lt;Ricky Hopper&gt;.
He worked in the  record business himself, and thought he might be able to make
contacts. Well, he  knew Pink Floyd from Cambridge, and he asked Dave Gilmour
down to hear me.  Since then, I've been singing, playing and writing until we
made the album.&quot;  Originally the album was to be released in late 1977, but
it kept getting delayed, and  finally appeared on Harvest in early '78. Now The
Kick Inside has come out a  second time on EMI-America, distributed by Capitol,
and Kate Bush is finally  available throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>Shortly after her phenomenal success with Wuthering Heights, Kate celebrated
 her financial windfall by picking up a $13,000 Steinway baby grand. &quot;I
feel as though  I've built up a real relationship with the piano. It's almost
like a person. If I haven't  got a particular idea I just sit down and play
chords, and then the chords almost  dictate what the song should be about
because they have their own moods.&quot; Kate  may be working on new songs for
another album, but she seems content to let her  career evolve without outside
interference or commercial pressures: &quot;I'm really not  sure how I'm going
to develop from now...what direction my music will take. I just  want to carry
on exploring.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Perhaps Wuthering Heights could only scale the pop music charts in her
native  England, fueled by fervor for the great British novel ...and novelty.
Maybe  America's Top 40 isn't quite ready for a singer-poet-pianist this unusual
and  challenging, even if she has sold over 250,000 albums in the smallish UK.
But we're  all going to find out. Kate Bush is demonstrating the kind of
creative imagination and  insight that could have an impact on music now and for
years to come.
