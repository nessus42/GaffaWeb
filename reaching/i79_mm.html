<P>Kate Bush<BR> Palladium, London</P>
<P>One could say of St Pancras   &quot;c'est magnifique,  but ce n'est pas le
gare.&quot; To describe Kate Bush  at the Palladium as bold, bravo and
stunningly effective  is to say that Fred Astaire could dance a little. Her 
performance was risky, teetering often on the brink  of the periously
over-blown, but a nerveless triumph  of energy, imagination, music and theatre.</P>
<P>Original and unique don't necessarily mean brilliant.  But what Katy did, on
Sunday, was to achieve a series  of tableaux vivants of peerless visual and
aural dazzle  that added immeasurably to the complexity and variable  excellence
 of her songs. I think she must have  been practising.</P>
<P>The performance was breathless, breathtaking and  perfectly  integrated. No
pauses, no chatter. Simply --  or, rather, elaborately -- and beautifully one
long  song-and-dance. Using most of the material from  &quot; The Kick Inside&quot;
and &quot; Lionheart &quot;  and then some, she was mesmerically centre-stage
for a  good two hours -- scampering, vamping, whirling and grinding.</P>
<P>The voice (both that impossible chandelier-shaking squeal  and that sinking
throatier register) swooped loud and true  round the theatre. The little mike
round her face looked  disconcertingly like a thermometer at first, but it
enabled  her to sing on her back, on her front, in the air and while  locked in
such various subltle embraces as to make my  companion stiffen in his seat. </P>
<P>She owes much to her eight-piece band and back-up  singers; especially to
three extraordinary dance partners;  to marvellously effective lighting and
costumes; and to  sexy choreography (yes, she's read Mime Kemp). </P>
<P>But she has the brains as well as the size and voice  behind it all, and
although she's derivative in some  ways, she is creatively so. Pinching moods
from Theda  Bara, Douglas Fairbanks, Lilian Gish and Bogart movies,  and
matching them to the shifting, jerky and silky-then-strident  rhythms of her
songs worked easily.  </P>
<P>Occasionally (viz. &quot;Wow&quot;) she couldn't quite  capture the purity
of the recordings. Sometimes she does  sound shrill, and when she takes a
breather at the piano  for a slow song like &quot;Feel It,&quot; Lynsey De  Paul
is distressingly recalled. Still, win some, lose  some. It's also true that
without the visual distractions  much of Kate Bush's material could become
monochromatic,  since many songs have the same shape. But you forgive,  forget
and remember such moments as the exquisite  &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;, &quot;Moving&quot;,
 &quot;Violins&quot; [sic] and &quot;Little Warm Room&quot;. [sic]  </P>
<P>Her dance to &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; (which she mimed,  to a tape), was in
the Salome class -- bring me the head of  Yma Sumac -- and she closed with &quot;James
And The  Cold Gun&quot;, prowling with cordite in her eyes and a  rifle in her
hand. It recealled the end of a Sergio Leone  movie, with the band rising to a
cacophonous climax.</P>
<P>In her encore, she carried on wuthering for ten minutes. I was bushwacked.
