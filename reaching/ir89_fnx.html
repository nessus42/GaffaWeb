<P>Date: Sat, 18 May 91 20:45:37 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward J.
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: WFNX radio interview from the fall of 1989 
</P>
<P>A lurker on gaffa who shall remain nameless just sent me a tape of the
interview  Kate did for WFNX Boston in the fall of 1989. I don't think it has
been transcribed  before, so I'll do it now. 
</P>
<P>Key: A = nameless Announcer. 
</P>
<P>B = Bruce McDonald, the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>B L = Bruce's words added later. 
</P>
<P>K = Kate, of course! 
</P>
<P>[&quot;The Sensual World&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>B L: 101.7 WFNX, the title track from Kate Bush's new LP, The Sensual World.
 Traditional Irish instruments are featured throughout the album, giving it a
more  pronounced Celtic flavor -- more so than any previous Kate Bush record.
Kate  attributes this influence to her family. 
</P>
<P>K: I guess I've always been very intrigued by Irish music. Since I was a
little girl it's  always been played in our house. My mother's Irish, and my
family are very  musical. And, um, I think that's probably been the strongest
musical influence on  me for a start. I love Irish music, and although I think
it was never really obvious  until the third, fourth album, it's kind of always
been in my blood. 
</P>
<P>B: It was in the background, but now it seems more in the foreground. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. And we love to actually go to Ireland when we can, to record them
there,  because obvously, it's just so much fun being in the country with those
people.  We love the Irish. 
</P>
<P>B: It has to add to the atmosphere, too. 
</P>
<P>K: I think so, yes, absolutely. 
</P>
<P>B L: &quot;Love And Anger&quot;, Kate's current US single, is one of two
tracks on the record  that features Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on guitar. Dave
was an early supporter  of Kate's, having financed some of her early demo tapes,
and helping to secure  her a recording contract. &quot;Love And Anger&quot; was
also one of the first songs  written for The Sensual World, and one of the last
songs finished. 
</P>
<P>K: It's one of the most difficult songs I think I've ever written. It was so
elusive, and  even today I don't like to talk about it, because I never really
felt it let me know  what it's about. It's just kind of a song that pulled
itself together, and with a  tremendous amount of encouragement from people
around me. There were so  many times I thought it would never get on the album.
But I'm really pleased it  did now. 
</P>
<P>B L: Here's &quot;Love And Anger&quot; from Kate Bush at 101.7, WFNX. 
</P>
<P>[L&amp;A played.] 
</P>
<P>A: You're listening to the sensual world of Kate Bush on 101.7, WFNX. Now
back to  your host, Bruce McDonald. 
</P>
<P>B L: Another song from The Sensual World, &quot;The Fog&quot;, appears to be
on the surface  the story of a father teaching his child to swim. Yet there's
much more to it than  that. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, it's very much using the parallel of the father teaching the child
to swim,  with a relationship where -- well, when I was taught to swim, my
father would  take me out into the water and then he'd say, you know, &quot;Swim
to me,&quot; and you  had to sort of let go of his hands and he'd keep stepping
away so it was always  like you kept going. And the whole process of kind of
letting go that I think we  have to do throughout life. I think, really, the
older I get the more I feel this is  what so much of life is about. It's just
letting go of all these things that you get  caught up in. The idea in the song
that things that you're frightened of, quite  often, it's the thought of it
that's more frightening than the action. It's the idea  of the water seeming so
deep that you're going to drown if you put your feet  down, but actually, if you
do put your feet down, the bottom's really close and  you can stand up and it
will probably only come up to your waist. Everything's all  right, you know. 
</P>
<P>B: That song also features dialogue by your father, Dr. Bush. 
</P>
<P>K: That's right. 
</P>
<P>B: That was just sort of a natural thing, or did you hear that when you were
first  composing the song? 
</P>
<P>K: I love using bits of dialogue in music as well. We haven't done too much
of that  on this album, but I have used my parents and my family and friends
before to  speak various passages. Obviously in this song, because it was within
the context  of a father teaching a child to swim, I thought it was -- who else
could have done  it? Who else? 
</P>
<P>B: Sure. 
</P>
<P>K: It had to be him. 
</P>
<P>B L: This is &quot;The Fog&quot; from Kate Bush, on 101.7, WFNX. 
</P>
<P>[TF played.] 
</P>
<P>B L: 101.7, WFNX. That's &quot;The Fog&quot;, from the new Kate Bush album
The Sensual  World. &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot; is the tale of a woman out
for the evening at a  nightclub in pre-World War II Germany, who is asked to
dance by a charming,  handsome man, who she only later realizes is Hitler. 
</P>
<P>B: What was the inspiration behind that? This, well, once again it's unusual
-- in  sort of a pop context. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it's a very dark song, and it's certainly a song I don't think I'd
write now.  But I guess it was inspired a) by the idea of, I mean one of the
fairy tale images  for a little girl, is to go to a fantastic ball, like
Cinderella does, and she meets this  handsome, supposedly, prince. It was the
reversal of the idea. He was like the  worst person you could possibly meet. But
that really sprung from a story that a  friend of mine told me who had been at a
dinner years ago, and had spent the  evening sitting next to this incredibly
charming man. Very intelligent, very witty,  he just loved his company so much.
The next day he asked the host &quot;Who was  that man I was sitting next to. He
was fascinating.&quot; They said, &quot;Didn't you realize,  that was
Oppenheimer.&quot; Now, my friend's reaction to that was absolute horror, 
because for him Oppenheimer represented such evil, because of his work with  the
bomb. 
</P>
<P>B: Sure. 
</P>
<P>K: But in some ways I felt a little sorry for Oppenheimer, because I think
he really  paid for himself. He was -- he committed suicide, he couldn't handle
what he'd  done. [Is this true? -- Ed] But the whole idea of the story was so
fascinating for  me, that he'd been so taken by this man until he knew who he
was, and then it  was like a complete reversal. I guess that hung around in my
head and I was  thinking, really, who's the closest embodiment to the devil, who
is the most evil  person ever, and I think --
</P>
<P>B: Especially in modern times. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, who else is there, really? But I would really hate anyone to be
offended by  the song. It's not meant to be a glorification of that whole event.
It's just meant  to be an exploration of the idea that evil quite often appears
in a charming guise,  and we should all be careful. He fooled so many people,
and I don't think you  can blame them for being fooled. But it's terrifying,
isn't it? 
</P>
<P>B: It is rather frightening. 
</P>
<P>B L: This is &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;, from Kate Bush's album The
Sensual World,  on 101.7, WFNX. 
</P>
<P>[HWD played.] 
</P>
<P>B L: Among the guest musicians featured on The Sensual World was Mick Karn, 
former bassist from the group Japan. Kate explains how she came to choose Mick 
for &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;: 
</P>
<P>K: I met Mick years ago at a charity gig that we did in London, and I've
always liked  his style of playing. 
</P>
<P>B: It's very distinctive. 
</P>
<P>K: *Very* distinctive. He has such a strong personality, and I know he's
very  respected for his work by other musicians, which is always a good sign.
But I felt,  for some reason, that this track was just right for him. So he came
along with a  part that he'd worked out -- I'd sent him a cassette. It was
fabulous. He  understood the whole story line. I hadn't sent any lyrics or
anything, and he just  kind of played this part. It was so right for the song. I
was really knocked out.  He's a very nice person as well as a great musician. 
</P>
<P>B: Would you consider working with him again? 
</P>
<P>K: I'd love to, but I find more and more with musicians, that there are
certain  tracks that call out for certain people. It's a bit like casting actors
for a film, so  this is how we approach things now. 
</P>
<P>B: Not necessarily would a film director cast the same people for every
film,  naturally. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>B: It's similar, in the analogy. 
</P>
<P>A: We'll be back with Kate Bush's sensual world, right after these messages,
on  101.7, WFNX. 
</P>
<P>[Fragment of &quot;Babooshka&quot; played, then ads, then a fragment of &quot;Hounds
Of Love&quot;.] 
</P>
<P>A: Welcome back to the sensual world of Kate Bush. Now here's Bruce
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>B L: Some of the more haunting tunes in The Sensual World feature the vocals
of  the Trio Bulgarka, a critically acclaimed group of women singers from
Bulgaria.  Their participation reflects Kate's long-standing interest in world
music. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, about three years ago my brother Paddy played me a tape of the
Trio, and  he's always been very interested in ethnic music and has collected
instruments  from around the world. When he played me this tape I was
devastated, I'd never  heard anything like it. It was like hearing angels
singing. I listened to this tape for  months, and I just started thinking, &quot;Wouldn't
it be nice to work with them?&quot; I  was so scared, really, about the idea of
belittling this great music, that it took me  a long time to get up the courage
to actually approach them. But once I did, it was  the most wonderful
experience, working with them as people, as well as  musicians. We managed to
make contact with them through a friend of ours  called Joe Boyd --
</P>
<P>B: Sure. 
</P>
<P>K: -- who got us in touch with people out there. We actually went to
Bulgaria and  met them there. We spent three days rehearsing. They don't speak
any English,  we don't speak any Bulgarian, but we had a great time! Although we
had  translators, a lot of the communication was done on an emotional level, and
it was  very interesting. They just come up and cuddle you, and then you sing to
each  other, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. They're like my
sisters  now, I now have three sisters! 
</P>
<P>B: In Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! 
</P>
<P>B L: &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, one of three tracks featuring the
Trio Bulgarka, is a  different take on love in the computer age. 
</P>
<P>K: I suppose it's looking at society where more and more people are being
shut away  in their homes with televisions and computers, and in a way being
encouraged  not to come out. You know, there's so many people who live in London
in  high-rise flats -- they don't know their neighbors, they don't know anyone
else  in the building. People are getting very isolated. It was the idea of this
person  who had less and less human contact, and more and more contact with
their  computer, where they were working on it all day and all night. They see
an  advert in a magazine for a program for people who are lonely and lost, so
they  write off for it. When they get it back in the mail and put it into the
computer,  it's the idea -- a bit like an old sci-fi film, really -- where it
would just come to  life and suddenly there's this kind of incredible being
there, like a great spiritual  visitation. This computer is offering this person
love, and the idea that they've  had such little human warmth, they're getting
this tremendous affection and  deep love from their computer. But it's so
intense it's too much for them to take,  and they actually have to be rescued
from just being killed with love, I suppose. 
</P>
<P>B L: This is &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, from The Sensual World, on
101.7, WFNX. 
</P>
<P>[DU played.] 
</P>
<P>K: Hi, this is Kate Bush, and you're listening to 101.7, WFNX Boston. 
</P>
<P>B L: That's &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; from Kate Bush's new album, The
Sensual  World. &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;, the current UK single from the
album, is a song  we first heard in the soundtrack to the John Hughes film &quot;She's
Having A  Baby&quot;. 
</P>
<P>K: Really, the subject matter in the film laid down the grounds for what the
song  was about. It's the man waiting in a waiting room while his wife is in
there  having a baby, and there are complications. So it's the exploration of
someone  being left on their own in a big way, very suddenly. In this part of
the film, the  guy has to grow up, he's suddenly confronted with all these
terrible things, that  he could be a much better human being. It's moments like
that that make you  feel these things. 
</P>
<P>B: And life's not all fun and games. 
</P>
<P>K: No, and that you should really try and make the most of it when you can,
and not  when it's too late. 
</P>
<P>[TWW played.] 
</P>
<P>A: We'll be back with more of Bruce McDonald, and more of Kate Bush's
sensual  world on 101.7, WFNX. 
</P>
<P>[ads] 
</P>
<P>[Fragment of &quot;Experiment IV&quot;] 
</P>
<P>A: Welcome back to the conclusion of the sensual world of Kate Bush. Now
here's  your host, Bruce McDonald: 
</P>
<P>B L: Independence has always been characteristic of Kate Bush in her work.
Since  the early days, she's been managed by herself, with help from her family,
 through a company she set up called Novercia. [Note -- he pronounces this 
noh-VER-shah. Assuming he heard Kate say it, I guess this is the corrrect 
pronunciation. I had always thought it was noh-ver-SEE-ah. -- Ed] It was a move 
designed to allow Kate the artistic freedom she needs. 
</P>
<P>B: Does having such complete control seem overwhelming at times? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it does. But I think in a way, what I'm moving towards, and I don't
know if  it'll work or not, but I feel like it's all leading me to the
combination of music  and film. I hope that someday maybe in a few years, I
could experiment with  making a film. 
</P>
<P>B: Really? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. I'm really --
</P>
<P>B: You mean, like a full length feature? 
</P>
<P>K: Maybe not a full length feature, but yes I'd love to, I really would like
to work  with visuals and music at the same time, because at the moment I'm
restricted to  making visuals in the context of videos to music that already
exists. I'd really like  to play with this a lot more. 
</P>
<P>B: Your brother Paddy Bush plays numerous instruments in The Sensual World.
We  talked about his interest in many different kinds of instruments. Your other
 brother John Carder Bush did the cover photos and that's just like more of a 
natural extension of the family? 
</P>
<P>K: I suppose what's really great is I'm surrounded by very talented people
who also  --
</P>
<P>B: Are related to you. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah! And they're really close friends. Obviously, John's photographs are
really  good, and that's why I work with him -- he's a great photographer.
Because we  know each other so well it's such a relaxed atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>B L: Kate Bush has not toured in over ten years. While Kate has always been
a  pioneer in the field of music video, she does realize the limited nature of
that  medium. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it's not an adequate substitute, and it is, unfortunately, that -- a
substitute,  when that can't be. You know, there is nothing that can substitute
live work, like  nothing can substitute an album. 
</P>
<P>B: Sure. 
</P>
<P>K: And it can do it. And I suppose the problem is that since the last tour,
I've been  so wrapped up in making albums, in trying to sort of keep control of
what I do. I  get so involved in what I do, it's an exhausting, long process for
me. Really, with  the albums taking so long, over the last few years I don't
think I've had the  space in myself to tour. I really enjoyed the last tour. A
lot of people think I  didn't, and that's why I haven't toured since. But it's
really more that I've just  got so wrapped up in all the projects I do that I
don't feel I've wanted to do it  enough, and I don't think I would have done it
well. 
</P>
<P>B: Plus, when you did tour it was this huge multi-media ambitious, sort of 
provocative production that took months and months just to get that together.
Not  to mention the actual playing the live gigs. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. Terribly over-ambitious, and I think probably that's a trait of
mine. I am  terribly over-ambitious with things I try to do, so it's quite scary
as well, you  know, trying to deal with such big things. 
</P>
<P>B: Well, I get the impression that you feel as though -- if you can't do a
tour or a  production up to your standards you're just not going to do it. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think it would be unfair on everyone if I did a tour and didn't
really want  to. I'm not really going to be exuding joy and happiness, am I? 
</P>
<P>B: At the same time, every time you release new music and we play it on the
radio,  we get listeners calling up saying, &quot;Please tell us Kate's going to
tour this time  around!&quot; Is that like --
</P>
<P>K: That's great. 
</P>
<P>B: -- a strain, or extra pressure, or --
</P>
<P>K: It's difficult for me, because, you know, obvously I hate the thought of
a lot of  people wanting me to tour and I don't. It's frustrating for them not
to have any  contact with me as an artist -- that there are only records and
videos. I mean, this  is great, because this is direct contact. You know, they
can hear you asking me  questions and me replying. That's great, but in a way
doing interviews for the  press and that is all such a removed process. But all
I can say is that I think it  would be wrong for me to tour, if I wasn't 100%
happy about doing it, and that I  felt I could do something special. I just
think everyone would be unhappy. So  maybe that's all I can say. I'm sorry, I
don't want to starve people of contact.  It's just -- doing what I do well is so
important to me, I've got to try and to the  best I can with everything. 
</P>
<P>B: Do you think that not touring has held you back from mainstream success, 
particularly here in America? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I think it's very possible, but I also think there's been so many
other  inaccessible areas, to me here as an artist. Where, I guess my last
record  company found it difficult to know how to express me as an artist to the
public.  My second and third albums weren't released here -- they were released
at a  later date. I think people must have quite a confusing image of me. 
</P>
<P>B: Sure. 
</P>
<P>K: But, in a way, I think that that's something I have to not worry about
too much,  because that's not really my responsibility. My responsibilities are
the artistic,  where I have to make the best record I can at the time, and I
have to try and let  people know it's out there. But all those areas, they're
kind of out of my control,  really. 
</P>
<P>B: Plus, a lot of that's in the past. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>B: And you like to look towards the future. 
</P>
<P>K: Absolutely! 
</P>
<P>B: Well, you've always been very popular in Boston. Do you have anything
else to  say to our listeners, your fans? 
</P>
<P>K: I'd love to say, to everyone in Boston, have a very happy Christmas and I
hope  1990 is a good year for all of you, and thank you so much for all your
support. It's  nice to know that you like my music out there, thank you. 
</P>
<P>B: Well, thank *you*. As a long-time fan of your music it's been a real
thrill, and a  pleasure to talk to you today. 
</P>
<P>K: Thanks very much. 
</P>
<P>B: And I hope to see you again. 
</P>
<P>K: All the best, Bruce!
