22:45:24 +0200 (EET) <BR> Subject: KaTe Interview in Vox, Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>The latest interview to keep your eyes open for is the November issue of Vox
 magazine. My pal that sent me the RbG single last week picked it up in London
on  Saturday and brought it back with him last night. 
</P>
<P>KaTe is featured on the cover (looking gorgeous). The Interview (pp32-34 &amp;
172)  is very much aimed at her personal life, and I get the impression that
she's very  tired right now. Quite despondent about life in general - not
suicidal (phew) just a  little cheesed off. But hey, that's just my impression.

</P>
<P>She also speaks a little of the album and the film as well as when she met
Michael  Powell. 
</P>
<P>There's a &quot;wallpaper&quot; of promo-pics (nothing that's not in &quot;A
Visual  Documentary&quot;) and a discography - singles and interview discs
included. 
</P>
<P>If there's sufficient interest (and legallities aside :-) I can OCR or
retype the  Interview and post it. 
</P>
<P>Thumbs crossed for the November release date sticking at last....

VOX Interview Nov. 1993 
</P>
<P>Here is the VOX Magazine Nov. 1993 interview. Enjoy.

<P>Kate Bush has worn countless images, but when the most incisive of
examinations  all bounce off, it's impossible to gauge those true to her private
self. In a rare  interview, she provides a few clues about her latest opus, The
Red Shoes. 
</P>

<H2>Rubber Souls</H2>
<P>By Marianne Jenssen 
</P>
<P>There's Eric Clapton, and Prince, and Nigel Kennedy... and Lenny Henry. The 
guest appearances on The Red Shoes, Kate Bush's ninth album, and her first since
 The SensualWorld, testify to the astonishing pulling power of one of the
business's  more enigmatic and reserved souls. She could teach the Purple One a
thing or two  about reticence. Encounters with Bush are rare and frequently
leave the selected  interviewers more baffled than when they entered. Opinions
differ on whether  Bush's ambling responses are the archly drawn veils of
someone who deliberately  wants secrets kept, or the honest display of an artist
with no more to say than what's  already in her lengthily gestated albums. Not
to mention a frowning wonder at why  anyone would think there was something else
anyway. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that's personal and I'm here to talk about my work,&quot; she
said recently  in an interview for The Sunday Times. &quot;My private life, I
don't want to let go of. I  need to keep it close and tender so that it's still
my own.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As befits a masterwork, The Red Shoes was kept carefully under wraps, 
reviewers being handed numbered lyric sheets (for later collection) at select 
playbacks. The detail within the tracks and the choice of guests offer witness
to  Bush's confessed pursuit of perfection. Sadly, history does not relate
whether Prince  and backing vocalist Lenny Henry were in the studio at the same
time for the track  'Why Should I Love You', or whether Henry got to say: &quot;Hey
Vic, I do this great  impression of you&quot;. 
</P>
<P>A film to accompany the album, with a working title of A Lion. A Cross And A
 Curve, features Miranda Richardson and Lindsay Kemp. Currently, its release is 
being delayed (and the album with it) as Bush toils over getting it right. It's
been  described as her Magical Mystery Tour, but she's reluctant to discuss it
until  completed, and has postponed other interviews to allow a clear run at the
work.  Again, she told the nationals: &quot;I've always been tenacious when it
comes to my  work. It seemed ironic that I was expected to do interviews and
television which  took me away from the thing that had put me into that
situation. It was no longer  relevant that I wrote songs. I could see my work
becoming something that had no  thought in it, becoming a personality. All I
wanted was the creative process.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the following interview, Kate Bush reveals just how important that
process has  become... 
</P>
<P>What inspires you? Do you have to achieve a particular mood or are songs
triggered  off by particular events? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's incredibly elusive. I think I used to write in a more
formulated way.  When I was very young, I would sit there at the piano and just
write a song - I  actually hadn't done that for a long time. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm working, I'm continually hit by how you start off with
something, and  though it doesn't necessarily change in essence, there's this
whole evolution that  happens around it, little ideas that get pulled in. I
think that may be one reason  why the albums take so long. I feel very grateful,
really, to have my work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you escape into it? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Umm... I don't know about escape - I think it's inseparable, that's
what it is. It's  not that I'm running away into my work, it's more that my work
moves  headlong into my life. There's a lot of my very personal experiences that
go into  my work, and my work gives me a lot of very personal experiences.&quot;

</P>
<P>If something traumatic occurs in your life, do you find it easy to express,
or does it  come out in some other form? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It depends on the trauma, it depends how heartbroken you are. Usually,
1 can pull  myself through things like feeling low or having problems by working
that  through. But I have been at points where I just couldn't work. I couldn't
possibly  sing--it was beyond me, it just hurt too much. Sometimes you have to
allow a bit  of time to come between you and the experience in order to even
touch it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think the biggest thing on this album is that I lost my mother. I
haven't been able  to write about any of it--nevertheless, the experience is in
there. It's something I  couldn't possibly express in music, and yet it is being
expressed through very  subliminal things, like the quality of some of the
performances. I couldn't work  for months, I couldn't go near the whole process.
I had no desire to start, no  desire to work at all. 
</P>
<P>	It was a terrible shock for all of us. Really, I'm so grateful that we had
so much  time together and we had such a good relationship. I had an incredibly
good  relationship with her, as did all my family. I often think how awful it
must be for  people who don't really get on with their parents--or don't know
them - to lose them  and be so bereft after having had nothing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What happens if people want to interfere in your work? I take it you don't
let  them? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think it's so much that I got interference at the start, but I
was aware that  things wouldn't be how I wanted them to be unless I was willing
to fight. I think  you have to fight for everything you want. Whether it's work
or life, it's just that  sort of thing of struggling; struggle is very
important. It's how you grow and  change and it also tests your intention - if
you really care about something, you  won't let go. 
</P>
<P>	I was 19 when it [the first album] came out, and my life completely
changed. The  big emphasis was that I was no longer allowed to work. My whole
day used to be  centred around work, in the most pleasurable way: I'd get up and
play around on  the piano, then I'd go up to London and see some friends, go
dancing ...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Did you feel that you were manipulated. Were you ever encouraged to be 
bimbo-esque for pictures? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think, on a couple of occasions, I was very naive and I was very
young. It was all  very new to me and, in the first year, 1 learnt so many
lessons about how people  wanted to manipulate me. I was always quite strong
about what I didn't want to  do, but nevertheless it doesn't take much.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you think of yourself as a feminist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think a lot of respect went for the feminist movement. I think it's
really wrong. A  lot of women resent women who have pushed their energies,
because it's kind of  made feminine energy look stupid. I believe there is a way
that feminine energy  can stand strong and powerful without having to be
something it's not.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Qualities such as ambition and competiveness are, supposedly, traditionally
male  ones, but do you possess either? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I hate both words intensely I suppose that's because, in a lot of
ways, they  represent to me an incredibly driven male energy that offends my
feminine  energy. But I do think I'm driven, and I don't know about this thing
of ambition.  I don't know because I think my ambition is creative I don't think
I'm  ambitious to conquer the world, but I am ambitious to try out ideas and
push  things, to see if you can make it better. I'm certainly very driven in my
work. I  do think that for a lot of women, their creativlty is quite masculinely
driven--it's  quite a masculine trait to speed forward, I suppose.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How much time have you spent working on The Red Shoes? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, 1 haven't spent that long. It went on over a long period of
time-about two  years of solid work amongst three-and-a-half to four years.&quot;

</P>
<P>Each album seems to take you longer to make than the last Is this because
you are a  true perfectionist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think 'perfect' is... I have used that word in the past, and used it
wrongly  because, in a way, what you are trying to do is make something that is
basically  imperfect as best as you can in the time you've got with the
knowledge you have&quot; 
</P>
<P>You don't normally release material unless you're totally satisfied... 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's right. That doesn't necessarilly mean'perfect', but it's to the
best of my  ability. I've tried to say what needed to be said through the songs,
the right  structure, the shape, the sounds, the vocal performance--that is, the
best I could  do at the time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When you've worked hard for something, you obviously don't want somebody 
interfering with it. In your cuttings, you've been described as the shyest 
megalomaniac on the planet, so how do yout work out the balance between that 
and being an incredibly quiet, private person? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's quite true that most people are extreme contradictions.
It's like this  paradox that exists, and I think that on a lot of levels, I'm
quiet and shy, and a  quiet soul. 
</P>
<P>	I like simple things in my life...I like gardening and things like that,
but when it  comes to my work, I am a creative megalomaniac again. I'm not after
money or  power but the creative power. I just love playing with ideas and
watching them  come together, or what you learn from something not coming
together. 
</P>
<P>	I'm fascinated by the whole creative process--I think you could probably
say I  was obsessed I'm not as bad as I used to be, I'm a little more balanced
now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What's calmed you down? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Just life, I think... Life gets to you, doesn't it? I also think
there's a part of me  that's got fed up with working. I've worked so much that
I'm starting to feel...  I felt I needed to rebalance, which I think I did a
bit, just to get a little bit more  emphasis on me and my life.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Where did you get the idea of 'Rubberband Girl&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, it's playing with the idea of how putting up resistance... um...
doesn't do any  good, really. The whole thing is to sort of go with the flow.&quot;

</P>
<P>What about the sexual content--'He can be a woman at heart, and not only
women  bleed? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not really sexual, it's more to do with the whole idea of opening
people up -  not sexually, just revealing themselves. It's taking a man who is
on the outside,  very macho, and you open him up and he has this beautiful
feminine heart.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you found many of those? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I've seen a lot of them, yeah. I think there are a lot of men
who are  fantastically sensitive and gentle, and I think they are really scared
to show it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A father image often comes out in your work. Is that because you're
particularly  close to your father or does it merely represent somebody or
something you  respect? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think they're very archetypal images: the parents, the mother and
the father...  it's immediately symbolic of so many things. I'm very lucky to
have had an  extremely positive, loving and encouraging relationship with both
my parents.  And you know I feel very grateful... I feel very honoured,
actually.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Who is the Douglas Fairbanks character in 'Moments Of Pleasure '? 
</P>
<P>'Ah... In a lot of ways that song, er.. well it's going back to that thing
of paying  homage to people who aren't with us any more. I was very lucky to get
to meet  Michael (Powell, the film-maker who directed the original The Red
Shoes) in  New York before he died, and he and his wife were extreme;y kind. I'd
had few  conversations with him and I'd been dying to meet him. As we came out
of the  lift, he was standing outside with his walking stick and he was
pretending to be  someone like Douglas Fairbanks. He was completely adorable and
just the most  beautiful spirit, and it was a very profound experience for me.
It had quite an  inspirational effect on a couple of the songs. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's a song called 'The Red Shoes'. It's not really to do with his
film but  rather the story from which he took his film. You have these red shoes
that just  want to dance and don't want to stop, and the story that I'm aware of
is that  there's this girl who goes to sleep in the fairy story and they can't
work out why  she's so tired. Every morning, she's more pale and tired, so they
follow her one  night and what's happening is these shoes... she's putting these
shoes on at night  before she goes to bed and they whisk her off to dance with
the fairies.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you still as involved in dancing as you were? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've had a lot of periods off, unfortunately, because my music is so
demanding and I  went through a phase where I just had no desire to dance. The
last couple of  years, it really came back, and it's been very interesting
working in an older  body. Your brain seems better at dealing with certain kinds
of information. And I  think there's something about trying too hard which takes
the dynamics out of  everything. 
</P>
<P>	I think I've become less conscious through dancing, because it's very 
confrontational in a positive way - standing in front of a mirror and looking at
 something that basically looks like a piece of you, and you've got to do
something  with it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Does that mean looking like a piece of shit? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It does at nine in the morning. When I started dancing again, a couple
of years ago,  I hadn't done anything for about three or four years and although
I had the  desire to dance again, I really didn't know if I had the energy, or
whether I  could be bothered to go through all that and my body being so sore.
But I was  aware that, although it was difficult for me, I always felt better
after the classes  than I did before. I'd get up grumpy, then after I'd feel
really good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Is it true you once planned to be a psychologist or psychiatrist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes I did. I really wanted to be a psychiatrist, I really did, but I
knew I'd reached  the point where I would never be able to do all the training.
You have to train as  a doctor, I think, and be good at chemistry, physics, etc.
I was never any good at  maths, I just knew I'd never make it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are there any parallels with what you do now? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've never really thought of it, but I suppose I really like the idea
of helping people  and that I was really fasdnated by people's minds and the way
they work--I still  am. I don't think I've ever got into people's minds, but
I've always been  interested in how people think. 
</P>
<P>	People think so differently from each other, people come to completely
different  conclusions from seeing or hearing the same thing... Now, how do they
do that,  other than there's all these internal processes going on? 
</P>
<P>	I think it's like anything in life--you can never be sure. Sometimes I
think you  have to put complete trust in your feelings: this doesn't feel right,
so I won't do  it; logic says I should bury my feelings and say no, so I won't.

</P>
<P>	Also, in my position, you can't be naive. The chances are, there will be
people  who will approach me whose intentions are not pure, they're after
something  which is not necessarily kindly. Again, I think the whole process of
allowing  people to misrepresent you puts you in an extremely dodgy situation. 
</P>
<P>	If you show someone something that's very honest and revealing, what are
they  going to do? Are they going to show themselves or are they going to hit
you in  the face?&quot;
