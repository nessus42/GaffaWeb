<P>Kate the (Fashion) Plate! 
</P>
<P>As we all know from her television appearances, Kate Bush the last person
who  could be accused of following fashion trends. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I was at school, I thought it was a bit dull to buy the same
clothes as all  my friends.&quot; Kate smiles. &quot;I think fashion is more fun
if you can find something  different to wear. I've always liked old clothes and
I used to go rummaging through  second-hand shops looking for bargains. Jumble
sales were always good too, and my  money went a lot further than it would have
done in the local boutiques. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I still like old clothes and the material they're made in...all those
velvets and  satins. But the trouble is, if the owners of a second-hand shop
recognize me, the  prices go up. So, I get one of my friends to buy the things I
want. That way I can still  get a bargain!&quot; 
</P>
<P>When it comes to fashion, Kate's a winner...
