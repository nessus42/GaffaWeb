<H3>   Kate Bush: learning to sing and <BR>     defying convention as she
<BR>     reaches for the heights
</H3>
<P>Kate Bush's extraordinary high-pitched voice, first heard on her
interpretation of her own song  Wuthering Heights, has provided the music
business  with one of its earliest highlights for 1978. Still only 19 years of
age, she talks to R&amp;RN about the  frustrations of the past two years during
which she  was signed to EMI but not recording and how the speed of her success
has affected her.</P>
<P>   &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; provoked more      controversy when it was
released than       probably any record by a new artist in recent      years.
Reactions split into two groups, one half      going bananas over Kate Bush's 
extraordinary      voice and writing style, and the other half having      to
turn the radio off when the song was played --      so annoying they found her
voice.</P>
<P>    Now that airplay has transformed into strong      sales, Kate Bush has
converted many of those      sceptics, and looks easily set to have the first   
  number one record by a British female artist in      many a week.</P>
<P>    At number 10 in the R&amp;RN airplay chart,      it seems that she has
also converted those      hardest-to-please men, the programme directors      of
Britain's 19 ILR stations. The public has      responded magnificently to EMI's
1978 trump      card, for until this year Bush, although signed to      the
label for over two years, had been allowed to      keep a very low profile.</P>
<P>    The release of the album and single came at a      time when she was
getting anxious about the      non-starting of her career. &quot;People,&quot;
she said,      &quot;had promised a lot of things over the years, but      this
was the first time something had actually      happened.&quot;</P>
<P>    In fact the single was to be released in      November, but a week
before release it was held      back, and she was made to hang on again. EMI    
 was afraid that it would get lost amongst the      deluge of Christmas records.
Bush consoled herself      via Capital Radio. &quot;A few promotion copies got  
   out and they played it straight away. That was      amazing,&quot; she says, &quot;And
what has happened      now is all far beyond my dreams.&quot;</P>
<P>    She first came to the attention of EMI      through Pink Floyd
guitarist, Dave Gilmour      who made some demos of her songs and took      them
around to his contacts, eventually securing a      deal with EMI.</P>
<P>    It wasn't as an artist that Kate originally saw      her career
developing. &quot;I started as a writer, I      couldn't sing or keep in tune,
and it was only      through hours of singing every day that my voice      got
its own quality. It's meant a lot to me being      accepted as a singer.&quot;</P>
<P>    Recording the album was the first positive      thing that Kate felt she
had accomplished in her      career. It took six weeks to record last summer.   
  &quot;Most of the songs had been written for over a      year,&quot; she says,&quot;
and producer Andrew Powell,      who first treated me like a session musician,  
   eventually gave me an incredible amount of      freedom in the studio. I
would suggest      instruments and he would get them for me.&quot; </P>
<P>    19-year-old Bush found the whole process      exhausting, both mentally
and physically, &quot;I had      all this energy and I couldn't let go.&quot;
She admits to      having only written a couple of songs since she      made the
album.</P>
<P>    Since she made the album she had      evolved a clearer perspective
about her      work. &quot;At first I couldn't hear it objectively      as a
whole, I got irritable and had to leave      the room. Two days ago I heard it
for the      first time in months. It could have been so      much better, there
were so many more      things I could have done.&quot;</P>
<P>    Though she is dissatisfied with her      album, she is aware that its
success must      generate other areas. Touring and      performing are her next
plans. </P>
<P>    &quot;Performing is the only time when      you get to people&quot; she
observes. &quot;The     human element is so important to      me, I'm finished
if I start losing it.&quot;  </P>
<P>    She has formed her own band and at      the moment is rehearsing a full
set with      them and as with everything she does there      is little that is
conventional about her      proposed stage act. She is very interested in     
dance as an art form and hopes to include      some sort of dance or mime
routine in her      act.</P>
<P>    She feels influenced by Lindsay Kemp, the      brilliant mime artist
whose work      <EM>Flowers</EM> sank itself indelibly in her      mind. &quot;I
thought if one person can combine      their music with that degree of body     
expression then it would be marvellous.&quot;</P>
<P>    Such is her confidence, she is prepared to      have a go at anything. &quot;There's
nothing      you can't do, it's important to learn about      yourself, and to
know how to use your      body.&quot;</P>
<P>    Dance, at one stage, seemed likely become      her vocation. When she
left school she      compatibly merged dance and songwriting as      her
main-studies. &quot;At one point I was dancing      from Monday to Friday and
enjoying it more      than my music. Now the writing is more      important.&quot;</P>
<P>    Through dance she has developed another      persona to her basic
character. &quot;When I      perform I'm definitely someone else, but     she's
a lot stronger and I wouldn't be as daring      as her.&quot; The separation
between performer      and artist is crucial she believes. &quot;People don't   
  do it to you, you do it to yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>    &quot;On stage everything should be a      communication,&quot; she
continues, &quot;but      everyone wants to package you.&quot; She cites     
David Bowie as being another main influence.      &quot;He's individual, and
keeps everything      moving. He's always exploring, and he's very      clever
as a performer.&quot;</P>
<P>    Her admiration for the most individual male      performer of the
Seventies does not limit      itself only to his live performances. Like     
Bowie, she wants to produce her own work,      but she doesn't feel equipped to
do it just yet.      &quot;You have a more complete picture when you      do
everything yourself.&quot;</P>
