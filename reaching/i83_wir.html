<P>THE WIRELESS INTERVIEW 
</P>
<P>by Brian Berry 
</P>
<P>September 1983 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill, from a transcription in BREAKTHROUGH 7. Thanks  to
Jackie Zucconi for providing me with the interview] 
</P>
<P>Capital/EMI America's latest attempt to bring Kate Bush's music to a wider 
audience is in the form of a &quot;mini-album&quot; simply titled, &quot;Kate
Bush&quot;. Kate hails from  England and has been an international sensation
since her first album, The Kick  Inside, was released in 1978. However, in
America her music has only been enjoyed  by a small, but devoted cult following.
The &quot;mini-album&quot; contains no new material,  but rather it includes
five songs previous [sic previously] available on three of her  previous
recordings. The album had been timed to coincide with a visit by Kate to  the
States last June. A massive promotion via the press had been planned. However, 
the visit was postponed due to transportation problems that arose. I asked Kate 
about the five songs and if she felt that they were fully representative of her
work.  &quot;Quite honestly, I don't think I would have chosen those five. It
has very much to do  with the record company and what they see a market for. I
did want &quot;Sat In Your  Lap&quot; to be on there. It's also quite nice to
get the French song on there 'cause I  quite like that.&quot; The French song is
a new version of &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;, which  originally appeared in
English on her third album Never For Ever. The French  version, as it turned
out, was targeted for the Canadian record market. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think there's so much aimed at the Canadian market where there's a
French  population and the song was especially done for the French people, so it
made sense  to put in on the Canadian version.&quot; The &quot;mini&quot;
concept is something that  Capital/EMI has had substantial success with in
breaking new or unknown artists.  Thomas Dolby, Missing Persons, and Duran Duran
are but some of the acts that have  been established through this approach. The
record is lower priced and is appealing  to a customer that may want to sample
an artist's work. This is a welcome idea if it  will help sell Kate's music to
the masses. 
</P>
<P>Kate originally singed with EMI/U.K. at the age of 16. Following the advice
of her  record company she tells of the period of development until EMI thought
she was  ready for her debut. &quot;I had finished taking my 'O' levels at
school and was coming  up to the stage where you start thinking about 'A' levels
at the University. And I  wasn't really into the idea of going to University, so
I thought I should leave school  and concentrate on my career, already having
signed a contract with the record  company. And I wanted to do something that
would show my name creatively, that it  would hopefully complement the music, so
I decide to take dancing. I saw a  performance by a mine artist called Lindsay
Kemp and I thought that's really what I  wanted to do, that kind of movement and
combine it with music. So, I spent the next  two years writing songs and just
dancing. After about 18 months, I went on to be a  singer in a band. We started
doing gigs around local pubs, doing other people's  songs. After we had been
doing that for just a couple of months, the record company  decided it was time
for me to do my own.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside was then recorded and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was the
album's  first single, released in England in January of 1978. The single was a
smash and  steadily climbed the U.K. charts to the number one position in March.
The single  was accompanied by a video featuring Kate's dancing talents. Her
reaction to the  tremendous success was of course, amazement. &quot;No, I don't
think anyone could ever  by ready for anything like that. I mean, you don't
really expect things like that to  happen, and as far as I'm concerned that's
the only time that will ever happen. I  think it was very strange, very
wonderful though. It was incredibly unreal and I still  find it hard to believe.&quot;
Kate's reflection on The Kick Inside today; &quot;That was such a  long time
ago. Some of the those songs were written eight years ago. They feel a  long way
away and I haven't heard it in years, so I don't really know how I would  react
to it if I heart it. But the last time I heard it I was quite shocked by how
young  I sounded.&quot; Some of the songs date back to about 11, true? &quot;No,
the earliest would be  about 15, the latest about 17 or 18.&quot; She cites her
favorite songs as &quot;Moving&quot; and &quot;... I  suppose I have to like &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's second album, Lionheart was released in December of 1978. The album 
continued with the same high and mesmerizing vocals that had become her 
trademark. Kate explains, &quot;I thought that was very much a part of where I
was with  the first album and alot of the songs were songs around the same time.
I think in a  way not much happened, it was really more of the same person.&quot;

</P>
<P>In April of '79, the British public was treated to the first in a series of
Kate's  stunning live shows. The performances combined the total persona of Kate
and the  results were visual marvels. She prepared for the live appearances with
strenuous  exercising. &quot;I have to work very hard. It's something you can't
just up and go out  and od, you have got to build up for it. If I had tried to
do it before all the training, I  wouldn't have gotten through the first song.
It's something you have to work into  gradually. I don't know how I did it
really. I think back now and I know I would  pass out.&quot; As for plans of a
tour in the near future, Kate replied that &quot;I have really  wanted to tour
since the last tour we did. But, I'm in a situation that if I don't do an  album
this year there will be too long of a gap between albums.&quot; So you do have
an  album planed for release at the end of the year? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I'm not sure if it will make the end of the year, but hopefully
the beginning  of the next year. So that's the next thing. But I do very much
want to do a show but  as soon as I decide that there's an awful lot of
problems, like where do we get the  money for it?&quot; I was anxious to
discover if she would ever bring her show to the  States. &quot;Well, you see
again that depends so much on finance. We wanted to bring  the last show to
America but it really did cost too much money and at that time we  were
basically paying for it. As it was we were really losing money. We can't really 
afford to do more than one of that type of show. We were very careful about
that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The tour was documented with the release of a four-song EP. The songs were 
live versions of previously released material and they showcased Kate's unique
vocal  range. Her lyrical, shimmering voice showed its agility and the ease to
which it  adapted to the dynamic demands of different songs. 
</P>
<P>Kate's third studio album, Never For Ever was greeted with great response,
and  it made it's initial appearance at the top of the British charts. Her
musical visions  soared to new heights with songs that defined a rethinking in
musical approach.  Topics included nuclear holocaust in the emotionally stirring
&quot;Breathing&quot;, a mother's  grief in &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, and
fantasies about afterlife in &quot;Blow Away&quot;. A change  had taken place in
Kate's musical horizons, Kate explains. &quot;I think the tour did quite  a lot
from the start. I learned an incredible lot about myself as well as the whole 
thing of performing. Singing songs that maybe i had written five years ago, over
and  over again, I find completely exhausting. I think it did change me quite a
lot and I  think in a way that was one of the brave things I did along with the
tour. I decided  to go through co-production with the engineer I had worked with
before instead of  having produced it, it was quite a big thing for me to learn
and I think it was quite  positive.&quot; Where do you get the inspiration for
your songs? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's very difficult to say. I usually get them from film but I think
the general  thing is probably people. They do such strange things, such
wonderful things.&quot; Do  you design your videos from your songs? &quot;Yes,
it tells you what to do to a certain  extent.&quot; Do yo rehearse your videos
with professional choreographers or do you  choreograph them yourself? &quot;I
choreograph and come up with the basic ideas. They  always get changed when new
ideas come along, but I suppose again ideas come  from what the songs say.&quot;

</P>
<P>The Dreaming is the latest studio album from Kate and is the only other full
 recording besides The Kick Inside to be released in the States. [This is not
quite  true, Lionheart was released in the U.S. in 1979, on a very small scale.
It wasn't fully  released until 1984.] Released her in October of '82, The
Dreaming continued the  musical evolution of Kate that began on Never For Ever.
New sound experiences  were evident within the initial U.K. single release, the
title track of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.  Kate had been working with the
Fairlight, a rather complex combination keyboard  computer which has the
capability of reproducing or creating an almost indefinite  variety of sounds.
Unusual sounds accompany the already innovative song structures  and the album
is a pure delight to hear. Kate describes the role of the Fairlight in  her
music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Since the last album, I've been very much writing on it. I think I
would have  earlier except before I started the last album I went back to the
old one. I used to  hire one in and it was so expensive, and eventually I
realized it would be alot cheaper  to buy one. So, it's only really since I
finished that last album that I've had time to  play with one at home and it's
great.&quot; The Dreaming was her first completely  self-produced album and I
enquired as to how if effected the outcome. &quot;Well, I  think when I was
writing for it, I wasn't thinking of myself as being the producer.  The way that
the actual demo tapes turned out, I just felt I could handle it. It was  very
demanding and I enjoyed it.&quot; Was it your most difficult album? &quot;Yes.&quot;
Would  you say it was your favorite? &quot;Yes, I would. Although, I think in a
way, some of my  favorite bits are a couple of tracks from Never For Ever, but I
would say that The  Dreaming, I'm pleased with that altogether.&quot; Are any of
the songs from The  Dreaming about you? &quot;No, I only put little pieces of
myself in them. And I think  what exactly you find in a story or a situation,
that I find I've been moved or in case  I should like something, I then apply my
own limited experience of that situation.  Besides I occasionally try to imagine
what it would be like. I think that's where I  come into the song, but no more
than that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What do you think it would take for Kate Bush to break here in America? Kate
 replied, &quot;I think probably like in every other country, you need a song
that's a hit  single. There are other ways but they are very much unpredictable
courses.&quot; One of  the courses could be M.T.V., but their rotation of her
videos in next to nil. &quot;Maybe  they don't like them,&quot; was kate's only
explanation for the problem. It seems such a  waste, it's been several years
since her American television debut on &quot;Saturday  Night Live,&quot; but I
still hear people vividly remember the lady &quot;... rolling the ball.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush does not follow trends and nobody can equal hers. It's hard to
find a  more entertaining and original artist. Her ability to knock down musical
dimensions,  puts her in the league of David Bowie and Peter Gabriel. It's great
to find someone  that will be an original regardless of the going fashion. The
rest of the world has  found her, I only hope America will someday make the same
needed discovery.
