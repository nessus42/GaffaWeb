<H2 ALIGN="center">Dear Diary: The Secret World of Kate Bush</H2>
<P>by David Sinclair 
</P>
<P>Cricklewood is not at all the kind of place you would expect to find Kate
Bush.  Although immortalized long ago in the title of a Ten Years After album,
it's a  peculiarly desolate and tragically unhip area of north London. 
</P>
<P>You feel Bush belongs more in an English garden, reading poetry on a bright 
summer day, or else in the Yorkshire moors, nursing some terrible, unspeakable 
grief. But on this gray morning, she is actually ensconced in a concrete
building so  ugly and functional that it looks virtually derelict from the
outside. 
</P>
<P>It's a sound-dubbing studio where Bush has been frantically punching the
clock  to finish work on a 50-minute movie, The Line, the Cross, the Curve, the
cinematic  companion piece to her latest album, The Red Shoes.  Inside, there is
a plush  reception area where we are introduced. Dressed in a big leather
jacket, she seems  small but surprisingly sturdy. She complains of being tired
but looks bright and  cleareyed if a little pale under her trademark thatch of
lustrously dark hair. We are  swiftly tucked away in a tiny, cold back room,
where the stillness is disturbed only  by the sound of thick sheets of rain
splattering steadily against the small windows. 
</P>
<P>As she points out several times, Bush doesn't do many interviews. She
doesn't  leave herself much time, for one thing. As with her recent videos, she
directed this  new movie -- in which she sings six songs from The Red Shoes --
as well as handled  the choreography and scriptwriting. 
</P>
<P>Co-starring her former dance instructor Lindsay Kemp and actress Miranda 
Richardson, the movie is loosely based on the Powell and Pressburger film of
1948  The Red Shoes, about a dancer (Bush) who is tricked into wearing a pair of
red  shoes that are possessed, after which she can't stop dancing. Explaining
the title of  her movie, Bush says, &quot; The Line is the path, the Cross is
the heart, and the Curve is  the smile,&quot; quoting a line from the movie The
Red Shoes. So now you know. 
</P>
<P>A control freak who was already overruling her record company's decisions 
when Madonna was still playing drums in her first group, Bush writes and
produces  her albums, has her own publishing company and recording studio and is
 self-managed. Right down to the post-production tasks of editing and sound
dubbing  her movie, she maintains a strict hands-on policy. The effect can be
draining. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't have enough hours in the day,&quot; Bush readily concedes. &quot;I
don't do  everything myself. I have people working with me who are wonderful.
But I've  managed for so long without a manager, I'm not sure there are a lot of
things I'd  want a manager for. I suppose I feel that at least the decisions I
make are coming  from me, and I'm not put into a situation that I wouldn't want
to be in.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But another, unspoken reason why Bush subjects herself to interviews so
rarely is  her singularly English reluctance to dwell publicly on herself or her
private affairs.  Gracious but guarded, she will cheerfully burble on about her
artistic motivations.  But try to pin her down on a matter of emotional
substance and her expression goes  blank, a shutter descends -- clunk! --and
that's the end of that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Albums are like diaries,&quot; Bush says. &quot;You go through phases,
technically and  emotionally, and they reflect the state that you're in at the
time. This album has  been a very big transition point for me. Right from the
beginning of writing there  was a different energy coming out. It probably
sounds a bit silly. But I do believe that  the people who are in the studio
exude an energy into the tape which is very much  to do with what they feel.
It's a very emotional process, really. And when you get  these close working
relationships with people, you start to get this weird  communication.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Apart from Bush, the person who has contributed most to the album has been 
bassist and studio engineer Del Palmer, her partner both musically and
romantically  since the earliest days. But despite his continuing involvement on
a professional level,  is it true that they are no longer a couple? 
</P>
<P>&quot;We have an extremely good working relationship,&quot; says Bush, &quot;and
I'd like to  think that the album reflects that. I tend not to talk about my
relationships, really.  That's quite a personal thing.&quot; Clunk! 
</P>
<P> The Red Shoes also features an unusual array of high-profile guest
musicians:  Eric Clapton on the smoldering, bluesy &quot;And So Is Love&quot;;
Jeff Beck on a stately  ballad called &quot;You're the One&quot;; and Prince,
who contributes guitar, keyboards,  backing vocals and a very Princely
arrangement to &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;If started off as a bit of a laugh, a game that turned into reality,&quot;
Bush says of  those star turns. &quot;The sort of people that I would have
dearly loved to have played on  the album, I actually got up the nerve to ring
them up and ask them if they would  like to come and play on the track. I don't
feel they've been used for their names.  I'd be very unhappy to think that they
weren't being shown off properly. But I do  feel honored that all of these
people were so responsive.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush's surprise at finding such luminaries so willing to participate (even
the  famously negotiable &quot;fee-paid-will-play&quot; Beck) may not be false
modesty. She has  collaborated with one or two close friends in the past,
notably Peter Gabriel on  &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and the affecting &quot;Don't
Give Up.&quot; But Bush hasn't  spent much time fraternizing with the rock
community since the whirlwind success  of her debut single, &quot;Wuthering
Heights,&quot; which topped the U.K. chart for four  weeks in 1978. 
</P>
<P>In many ways, Kate Bush has had a privileged -- some would say cosseted
--ride,  having been elevated from an early age above the general rough and
tumble of rock  &amp; roll. She was still a schoolgirl when Ricky Hopper, a
family friend and wanna-be  talent scout, financed a demo tape of her songs,
which he passed on to David  Gilmour, a guitarist with Pink Floyd (who, she
says, neither sought nor received any  financial reward for his efforts), Bush
was signed to EMI Records in Britain in 1974  at the tender age of 16. 
</P>
<P>Supported financially, but otherwise left to her own devices, she spent the
next  three years honing her talents and developing material at her own speed.
It's a habit  that has yielded diminishing commercial returns in later years as
gaps between  albums have grown steadily longer. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
is still her biggest single  worldwide. In America, 1985's Hounds of Love is her
only album to have even  dented the Top 40, although The Red Shoes has become a
current college-radio  favorite. 
</P>
<P>Bush has toured only once, a multi-costume-changing, singing and dancing 
extravaganza that played for 28 dates in Europe in 1979. It was a trailblazing
show, so  much so that it was Bush's sound engineers who first hit on the idea
of the  microphone headset, developing a prototype made out of a wire coat
hanger, which  she used in the early shows. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I did enjoy it,&quot; Bush says of her touring experienced, &quot;but
I was really physically  exhausted. Eventually, I got nervous about performing
live again, because I hadn't  done it for so long, and I think I actually
started losing a lot of confidence as a  performer. I felt that I'd become a
writer in a very isolated situation, just working  with a small group of people.

</P>
<P>&quot;The more I got into presenting things to the world, the further it was
taking me  away from what I was,&quot; Bush says, &quot;which was someone who
just used to sit quietly  at a piano and sing and play. It became very important
to me not to lose sight of that.  I didn't want my feet to come off the ground.&quot;

</P>
<P>Does she worry that she is missing out, that she is, to use her own word, in
 danger of becoming too isolated? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Touring is an incredibly isolated situation,&quot; Bush argues. &quot;I
don't know how  people tour for years on end. You find a lot of people who can't
stop touring, and  it's because they don't know how to come back into life. It's
sort of unreal.&quot; 
</P>
<P>For Bush, the trick seems to be shutting out as much of the background blare
as  possible. She rarely reads the papers or listens to the radio or goes to see
shows or  buys albums. She claims no knowledge of the notoriously Bushlike
singer Tori Amos  -- &quot;I heard one track and I thought it was very ... uhh,
nice&quot; -- and cites as her own  primary influences the English and Irish
traditional music that her piano-playing  father, her singing mother and her
older brothers played and sang in the house  when she was growing up. 
</P>
<P>&quot;From the earliest age I can remember,&quot; Bush says, &quot;I was
hearing the most  beautiful tunes being made up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The recent death of her mother, to whom she was always very close, is one 
reason why Bush has taken so long to produce The Red Shoes, her first album
since  1989's The Sensual World.  According to those around her, it took Bush
the better  part of a year after the death to get back into the frame of mind to
work. But  despite the long periods out of the spotlight, she has maintained a
core following  with a deep and unswerving loyalty. 
</P>
<P>Her fans, Bush insists, mean a lot to her. &quot;It's very moving that a lot
of people  that I don't know are so supportive of what I do,&quot; she says. &quot;I
don't tour, I don't  give them that much, really. Obviously I try to make the
best music that I can, but  after about two years of making an album you start
to worry: 'Is it going to come  out all right? Is it all going to sound churned
out?' And then you get odd little letters  from fans here and there encouraging
you, and that's a fantastic boost. I suppose I  hope that if I keep an integrity
in my work, then they'll always feel that.&quot;
