<P><STRONG>Kate's not saying too much</STRONG></P>
<P>By Val Marriott</P>
<P>The word for Kate Bush is enigmatic. This year's top girl singer  isn't
putting all her cards on the table. She may give all her  considerable intensity
to her music, but she isn't revealing too  much as a person.</P>
<P>For a 20-year-old who has suddenly been catapulted into the  crazy world of
pop stardom she remains her private self.  Uncompromising, logical and
disciplined in her work -- and  keeping her &quot;family&quot; image far away
from the  rigours of song-writing and singing.</P>
<P>With &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; she set her first challenge  to the
public.</P>
<P>&quot;See what I've done with Emily Bronte's story.&quot; she  demands. And
at first not understanding, then intrugued, finally  won over, the record-buyers
responded.</P>
<P>&quot;We want more!&quot; they chorused. But the astute Kate  Bush didn't
give them the mixture as before.</P>
<P>&quot;If you can keep changing and get away with it, that's great.&quot; 
she says, risking her neck and her new-found reputation every time.</P>
<P>Her father is a doctor -- and Kate grew up in a caring, loving family.  Her
father is musical, and one of her two brothers is a maker of  musical
instruments.</P>
<P>&quot;We think alike, musically.&quot; she says.</P>
<P>&quot;With my new album, I feel ready to explore deeper, to make  the sound
heavier and with even more meaning for the listener.&quot;</P>
<P>A Leo subject, Kate has the iron control to keep her strong personality  in
check. &quot;I think I know when to speak out and when to be  tolerant,&quot;
she says.</P>
<P>&quot;I used to wish I were a man, but now I'm happy to be a woman.  I now
believe that my looks don't get in the way of being accepted as  a musician --
I've surmounted that hurdle.</P>
<P>&quot;I'll always be tough on myself,&quot; she says, &quot;But I find  the
strength in being alone, fighting a battle and emerging satisfied  that I've
done my best. Perhaps that's what is strange about me.</P>
<P>&quot;I grasp any chance of a family get-together, because I love my 
parents and brothers.</P>
<P>&quot;But looking back, maybe the happiest times of all are when I've  been
alone, in an emotional state because a new song is beginning  to flow...&quot;</P>
