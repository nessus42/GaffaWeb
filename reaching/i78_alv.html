<P>VERY occasionally a new personality bursts (and sometimes creeps gently)
into the limelight of public attention, and steadily takes the world by storm.
Among the countless seven-day wonders which the entertainment industry throws
off its perpetual conveyor belt, we witness, on the rare occasion, a special
talent with an almost hand-cast individuality that is instantly recognised as
totally original and tastefully engineered.</P>
<P>Kate Bush is undoubtedly from this rare mould.</P>
<P>In January, Kate stunned the music world with her extraordinary single
'Wuthering Heights' based on Emily Bronte's novel. It shot to No. 1 in the
national charts and her debut album which followed had many more pleasant
surprises. '<EM>The Kick Inside</EM>'* comprises thirteen of her own
compositions and demonstrates not only an unusual vocal range, but the
sensitivity with which she approaches her writing -- and her life.</P>
<P>Kate's sensitivity is not restricted to surface matters, but is heightened
by her intense awareness. Although only 20, she has the sagacity and insight of
many people twice her age. Her eyes, and ears, are turned gently to some source
of light and inspiration which gives her the impetus and zest apparent through
her work. New Age philosophies are an important aspect of her life, and she has
been deeply impressed by the works of Gurdjieff. Her sensitivity and compassion
have led her to shun animal food. &quot;Life is a very precious thing,&quot;
says Kate. &quot;I suddenly came to the realisation four years ago, that to eat
the flesh of the animals who share our joy in living, is very wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>Kate comes from a musical family and began playing the piano at an early
age. She had written her first batch of songs by the age of eleven, and recorded
her first demonstration disc at sixteen. Since then she has been exploring and
developing her musical technique and, to expand her abilities even further, she
has been taking dancing lessons. For a time she worked with Lindsay Kemp, master
of mime and dance, and discovered the combined aspects of visual impact, mime
and movement in relation to music and voice. &quot;I believe,&quot; she says, &quot;that
a performance should be musical poetry in motion.&quot;</P>
<P>Kate's popularity is spreading overseas, but we hope that she is one British
export that will stay with us for many years. D.M.</P>
