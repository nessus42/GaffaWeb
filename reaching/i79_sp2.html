<P><STRONG>Kate's Great!</STRONG></P>
<P>(How to become a superstar the Kate Bush way)</P>
<P>IT'S taken less than two years for Kate Bush to slide  silkily into the top
ranks of British performers. It was  in the cold January of '78 that the public
first heard of  her via the Bronte-inspired debut smash 'Wuthering  Heights'.</P>
<P>But this was no potlucky, one off single. Kate's career  really began when
she was 16 years old, four years  before the single was released.</P>
<P>In the intervening time, she was under carefully  monitored wraps, courtesy
of recording giants EMI. </P>
<P>But the story begins before even then . . .</P>
<P><STRONG>Wispy</STRONG></P>
<P>Born into a family whose musical tastes were many  and varied, by the time
she was 11 Kate had taught  herself to play piano and had written her first
songs.  Quietly convinced she had talent, Kate worked at her  craft studiously.
</P>
<P>When she was 16 she met David Gilmour of Pink Floyd  fame . . . he liked
what he heard and seeing the potential  in the wispy teenager, ensconced her
into London's Air  Studios to lay down some tracks.</P>
<P>The results were quick and decisive; a fully produced  demo and a contract
with EMI Records.</P>
<P>But instead of rush releasing the single and pushing Kate  on a round the
country tour, the vinyl magnates decided  to bide their time.</P>
<P>During the interim, Kate concentrated on perfecting her  trade.</P>
<P><STRONG> Expand</STRONG></P>
<P>To explore and develop her musical techniques she  concentrated on writing.
To expand her abilities and  to find a better method of expressing her highly 
imaginative songs, she took lessons in dance. </P>
<P>She studied with the best teachers in the land,  including the master of
mime, Lindsay Kemp.</P>
<P>Learning many aspects of visual communication  and movement, she cleverly
adapted them to her  songs. Believing that a live performance should be  a
multi-level affair, Kate wanted to incorporate music,  dance and poetry into
hers.</P>
<P>She wanted Kate Bush concerts to be something no  one would forget. The
beginning of 1978 and the  time was ripe. EMI released the first single, sat 
back and waited for the storm they knew would  break.</P>
<P>Reviews were mixed. Some likened her voice to  that of a drowned cat. Some
couldn't bear the  screeching. But some predicted that this young  lady was
going to be the brightest star to emerge  that year.</P>
<P>The single hung around the bottom of the charts for  a few weeks, as if the
public were just getting used  to this strange, new sound. Suddenly it shot to
number  one and Kate Bush had the important distinction of  having a debut,
chart topping single. From then on,  it snowballed.</P>
<P>The single hit number one not only here but in Europe,  Japan, Australasia,
Canada and South Africa, too!</P>
<P>She collected a clutch of awards including the Tokyo  Music festival Silver
Prize, the coveted Dutch Edison  award and a heap of Best Female Singer /
Songwriter  Awards from the press. Kate Bush had arrived.</P>
<P><STRONG> Perfect</STRONG></P>
<P>Her debut album 'The Kick Inside' stayed in the top  twenty for months and a
few more top singles cemented  her position as one of our foremost entertainers.</P>
<P>After the second album 'Lionheart' Kate Bush had  another unique
distinction. She was one of the premier  record sellers in the country . . . yet
she had never  played a live date here.</P>
<P>March was chosen as the month for her tour, and  preparations for it were
shrouded in a secrecy which  put the Kremlin to shame!</P>
<P>But the concerts were well worth waiting for. Kate  sang, danced and
performed her way through a  two hour show.</P>
<P>Now it's September and a live EP taken from those  shows sees Kate Bush back
in the charts again.</P>
<P>Her rise to fame has been a shrewd, calculated  manoeuvre, built on the
solid foundations of her  immense talent.</P>
<P>The long period between the signing of her deal  and the first single was a
joint decision taken by  various EMI heads and Kate herself. They wanted  her to
concentrate on her songwriting: to write  less songs, but stronger ones.</P>
<P>At 21 she has achieved more than most performers  twice her age. And the
frightening thing is that this  is still the early days of her career.</P>
