Subject: TSW Interviews 
</p>



<p>The main topic of this posting are the various interviews The One And Only has 
done concerning TSW album (both those I've read in magazines and those which 
have been kindly posted to the list). 
</p>

<p>It's almost like reading from a menu. For this album we have: 
</p>



<p>A) the family friend and Oppenheimer story 
</p>

<p>B) the Trio and the dial tone story 
</p>

<p>C) the &quot;first started/last completed&quot; Love &amp; Anger story 
</p>

<p>D) the battle to get Joyce's lyrics story 
</p>

<p>E) the story behind This Woman's Work saga 
</p>

<p>F) and, the incredible favorite, the &quot;my most female album&quot; quote 
</p>



<p>Over and over and over again. With some of these later interviews, I'm surprised 
that text like &quot;Kate yawns loudly&quot; and &quot;Kate loses consciousness&quot; doesn't start 
showing up, she keeps getting asked the same question so often. 
</p>

<p>I am not a journalist, but I know there are other aspects of this album that have 
not been explored. I don't read a lot of interviews with singers, songwriters, 
musicians, so I don't know whether to attribute this to Kate's tendency towards 
privacy or to unimaginative interviewers. 
</p>

<p>But I remember when HOL came out there were stories about the cover 
photographs, some info on how different parts of the album were technically 
produced, and other such stuff. 
</p>

<p>What happened?

Subject: Kate and Interviews 
</p>



<p>[Kate and Interviews:]
</p>

<p> Your &quot;menu&quot; was certainly spot on, Douglas: Kate has surpassed herself during 
the past year in repeating the same answers endlessly and virtually without variation. 
As much as IED would like to lay the blame solely on the heads of her 
interviewers--and they have indeed shown an amazing lack of knowledge or 
imagination, as usual--for the dullness of Kate's answers, it just isn't possible. Kate 
knows that interviews are as much an occasion for the subject to extemporize as for 
the interviewer to ask questions. She could always change the subject and introduce 
new ideas into the conversations, but she chooses instead to reply by rote to the 
familiar questions she is asked. 
</p>

<p>In fact, on many occasions she has deflected a novel question by interpreting it as 
a familiar one, and answering with one of her tried and true formula responses. It's 
sad to say it, but Kate doesn't seem to want to communicate much with the public, 
or to spend more time than is necessary in the public eye, and as time goes by she is 
becoming more and more obvious about it. 
</p>

<p>Her evasive, bland replies and word-for-word repetition of stock answers are 
perfectly compatible with her dismissals of the possibility of touring: in both cases 
there is an implied conviction that her place is at home and in the studio, not before 
the public, and that her energies are too easily sapped when misdirected into areas 
which she considers to be of secondary importance--like touring and giving 
interviews. 
</p>

<p>Face it, folks--Kate has all but retired, permanently, from the &quot;real&quot; world. From 
here on in, she will probably only appear every seven or ten years to 
promote--perhaps via one or two satellite-distributed interviews--a new album. 
Aside from that we will have to amuse ourselves as best we can with what 
information and materials become available to us. -- Andrew Marvick
