<P>Date: Sun, 15 Mar 87 15:39 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: Electronic Soundmaker
interview, 1983? (excerpts)
</P>
<P>The following is part of an interview published in the European magazine  &quot;Electronic
Soundmaker&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush and the Fairlight 
</P>
<P>The Fairlight isn't just capable of instantly replaying a given sampled
envelope  (waveshape) at a different frequency: it can be used to modify the
shape. Kate,  however, finds it infinitely preferable to retain the natural
envelope. 
</P>
<P> &quot;Quite often there's very little that needs doing to it. Occasionally
I quite like  reversing it -- quite an interesting example of that was when I
was working on &quot;The  Dreaming&quot;. I wanted a dijeridu, and as the
Fairlight is an Australian instrument, it  happened to have a dijeridu as one of
its present samples.&quot; This was used as the basis  of a loop, which
illustrates another aspect of the &lt;Fairlight&gt; CMI: it can construct a 
sound that lasts longer than its maximum sampling period, by looping sections of
the  original envelope together. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's a page &lt;commands for modifying or setting up sounds are
presented as  pages on a display screen&gt; where you can loop your sound up,
and you can vary the  length of the loop according to what you want. Other pages
have different functions.  For instance, page two is the voice page, so that's
where you actually call up the  sound. You can actually create sounds by drawing
your own waves, but the problem  is that they do tend to sound very synthetic,
and I haven't found any use for them.  It's very hard to draw something that
sounds natural -- it's a very complicated  thing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We then rounded on the visual dimension of the CMI. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's something that's very useful: you can actually see a sound.
Incredibly  ugly sounds can look really beautiful. It's really like another
dimension: visual  interpretation of the world rather than audial.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And again Kate enthused about the &quot;human element&quot; of the
Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm very into natural sounds -- particularly taking them out of their
range, and  maybe sometimes putting them backwards. I suppose I like distortion
of natural  things. I like to still feel there's something natural in it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The main employment for the Fairlight -- certainly as far as Kate Bush is 
concerned -- is as a tool for filling gaps in the music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When you've already got the song, and there's a gap in there, and you
know  that there's some kind of instrument that will fit it, you know that it's
gonna come  out of the Fairlight, and just can't find it, it's incredibly
frustrating.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Most of Kate's songs are &quot;demo&quot;ed before the Fairlight is put to
use, and in the  case of &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My
House&quot;, the demos were responsible  for decideing the mood of the finished
song. 
</P>
<P>&quot;For demos, I'd use the Yamaha CS80 because what happens on it seems
quite  nice &lt;the synth has independent touch sensitivity on each note&gt;,
and it was just a  matter of setting the same sounds on the Fairlight. The bell
sound on &quot;Sat In Your  Lap&quot; was originally done on the CS80 and we
thought at the time that it was a good  sound, but when we did it on the
Fairlight it was much better.&quot; Kate finds that it is  possible to come up
with a new song using the Fairlight, but this very much depends  on her mood. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think I could ever write with a group of musicians sitting
around -- I  always have to write alone. I've got an eight track system at home,
and I'll put a  rhythm from the Linn Drum down and then put one or two pieces of
Fairlight on it.  Then I put on a lead vocal and some backing vocals. Sometimes
I just can't find a  sound to inspire me; I find it's very exciting to use
natural sounds rather than using  a synthesizer though, and getting the
Fairlight has been revolutionary for me and my  work.&quot;
