Subject: KZSC radio in Santa Cruz Dec. 1989 (one quote)
</P>
<P>A friend of mine participated in a telephone interview with Kate Bush last 
December sponsored by the record company. 
</P>
<P>I recently heard this tidbit and couldn't resist posting it, pardon if it
was already  posted: 
</P>
<P>Phil Benson (KZSC radio in Santa Cruz): Could you share an interesting story
 from the making of the current album? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well yes, there is quite a nice story in context of what I was saying
earlier  about Sensual World, the song, how its based on the solilquy at the end
of Ulysses  and the pacing word is yes, yes, all the time. And so because we had
a lot of energy  going into this while we were making the album it became quite
a feature. When  we worked with the Trio Bulgarka their names, Yanka, Eva,
Solyanka (sp?). And  when they stand in line and you write their initials on the
desk they spell 'yes', 'y',  'e', 's'; and we thought that was a pretty nice
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>That was from her mouth, ladies and gentlemen, and I must say it is just as
silly as  something LHs might dredge up. 
</P>
