(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Ask Aspel September 5, 1978 
</P>
<P>19. Wuthering Heights: the second lip-synch of this song for the U.K. TV 
programme Top of the Pops, summer '78. Kate is dressed in a white gown similar
to  that worn for the &quot;official&quot; video of the song. Some
multiple-image video effects are  also very similar. An excerpt from this
performance was re-broadcast as the  introduction for Kate's appearance on the
U.K. TV programme Ask Aspel. Her  backing was from a large studio ensemble, with
whom Kate had had minimal  opportunity to rehearse. Nevertheless, the result is
very professional, far more  assured than her first Top of the Pops performance.

</P>
<P> 20. Kashka from Baghdad: live, solo w/piano on the U.K. TV programme Ask 
Aspel, September 5, 1978. She is also interviewed. This was a children's
programme,  although its host is more polite and asks more intelligent questions
than most of  Kate's interviewers had done up until that time. Kate is
extraordinarily poised in  the interview segments, and her solo performance of
Kashka, with  self-accompaniment on the piano, is completely assured. All in
all, a very satisfying  early clip. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above notes by IED. Bracketed words are Ron's 
comments] 
</P>
<P>I: I'm very happy today because my guest is Kate Bush. Welcome Kate. 
</P>
<P>K: Hello. 
</P>
<P>I: And you're going to play for us latter on? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, yes I am. 
</P>
<P>I: You've promised. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes I have. 
</P>
<P>I: Ok, then. Straight away, Susan Alton of Fleetwood, Sharlock Campel of
Hampton  Hills, Micheal Burch of Wetherby, and Soleen Meean of Vardbee [I have
no idea  if these names are right] have asked dear Kate to sing the song that
got her to  number one in the charts. From the Top Of The Pops program, here's
Kate  singing Wuthering Heights. 
</P>
<P>[Wuthering Heights is played. This version has several Kate's superimposed
next to  each other] 
</P>
<P> I: Those were Kate Bushes with her first hit. And Adam Currey Whiteney of 
Surrey, Kate, wants to know if you were you a bit apprehensive doing your first 
song in that very high voice? But then, have you always sung like that? 
</P>
<P>K: No, no I haven't. It was really specifically for that song that is was
that high.  Because of the subject matter and the fact that I'm playing Cathy
and that she  was a spirit and it needed some kind of ethereal effect, and it
seemed to be the  best way to do it, to get a high register. 
</P>
<P>I: Very much an acting job as well, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think so, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Absolutely. Now lets get back to the beginnings. You're 19 now? 
</P>
<P>K: 20. 
</P>
<P>I: 20. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, just. 
</P>
<P>I: And you're from Kent? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: And is Kate Bush your own name? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes it is. 
</P>
<P>I: Now your fathers a doctor. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Is it a musical family? 
</P>
<P>K: My brothers are very musical, yeah. They were really responsible for
turning me  on to it in the first place. They were always playing music when I
was a kid. 
</P>
<P>I: You got lot of &quot;O&quot; levels, you got 10. [Kate laughs] Seems like
a world record to me. 
</P>
<P>K: How did you know that? 
</P>
<P>I: Oh, I know a lot of things. [Kate laughs] Did you always want a musical
career in  spite of all those qualifications? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I did. I've always wanted to be involved in music. I never thought
I'd actually  be able to sing them, sing my songs. But it seems that I've done
it. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, I don't think anyone else could do them really. You left school at
16, what did  you do as soon as you left school? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I started training as a dancer, because it seemed very complimentary
to the  music, and I just didn't want to waste my days doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>I: You were writing songs then, from way back. How old were you when you
started  writing songs? 
</P>
<P>K: About 11, I think. 
</P>
<P>I: And mostly late at night I read, or just these days. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, it always was, really. It seems to be the time of day that things
gather, you  know? 
</P>
<P>I: Your mind really works, then? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, I'll wake up about 11 o'clock. I'm sorta sleepy all day, then about
11 I really  wake up. 
</P>
<P>I: Now your first single, Wuthering Heights, was a success straight away.
Did you do  anything excessive with the money it brought you. 
</P>
<P>K: Well I think the main thing I've done is try to use it. Because it's so
rarely that  you're in a position where you can have money, you know, especially
for your  work. 
</P>
<P>I: So what did you do? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, um, we built a studio at my parents place, so we've actually got a
demo  studio and we can use it for recording and helping the band and all sorts
of  things. Pretty useful. 
</P>
<P>I: And a really good piano. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, a really great one, terrific. 
</P>
<P>I: Must be nice. What was the inspiration for Wuthering Heights, simply the
story? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I'd hadn't read the book, that wasn't what inspired it. It was a
television  series they had years ago and I just managed to catch the very last
few minutes,  where there was hand coming through the window, and blood
everywhere, and  glass. And I just didn't know what was going on and someone
explained the  story, and it was just hanging around for years. So I read the
book, in order to get  the research right, and wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>I: And that had just stuck in your mind, all those years. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, it seemed so strong. 
</P>
<P>I: Yes. Well it's a haunting song, certainly. Well now we've got something
for  Rebecca Maycok of Darbey and D.P. Aleen of Preston. 
</P>
<P>[My tape cuts here, right into this question :-(] 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, it's great. I love lions. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you. Well, I look forward to that coming up on your next song perhaps.
Now  [??? mentions two names] want to know, and I've think you've answered this,
 how old you were when you first started singing, it was, what 11, wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I guess so, yes. I've been singing since I was a kid really. 
</P>
<P>I: But Deborah Loaph of [??? inaudible city] asks, Do you find it easier to
write  songs now, then when you were younger. Is the process becoming easier. 
</P>
<P>K: No, it's not easier. I find it's much more difficult, actually, because
I'm much  more critical of what I do. I mean, I used to just write loads of
rubbish, and  definitely lots of people think I still do, but it's a much more
complicated process  now, but I'm much more satisfied with the songs then I used
to be. And I think  that's good. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, of course. And it's a perfect cue now for a live performance which
you did  promise us. We've wheel our BBC piano in, what's it going to be? 
</P>
<P>K: It's a song called Kashka From Baghdad, and it's off the new album, which
is in  fact called Lionheart. 
</P>
<P>I: Ah, the lion bit. You know I wasn't wrong. 
</P>
<P>K: Big coincidence. 
</P>
<P>I: Certainly. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Well there you are, as Kate makes her way to the BBC piano, we'll here
this one,  called Kashka From Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>[Kate plays Kashka From Baghdad. To quote Peter FitzGerald-Morris from 
Homeground, &quot;She later explains that she wanted to sing In the Warm Room,
but  felt that it was too risque for a children's show. She sings Kashka From
Baghdad,  a song about two gay lovers, instead.&quot;] 
</P>
<P>I: Um. Unmistakably Kate Bush, extraordinary song. You've written it
yourself, but  it still, as its so complicated, be difficult to play. Kate
Walshire of Canterbury  wants to know, do you get very nervous before you
perform your songs? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I do. Especially when it's live. There's so much you have to think
about,  really. And you can't help but be aware of yourself, you just find
you're out  there looking at yourself. It's a very strange feeling. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you ever put on a kind of disguise to get over that? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, yes. I mean I use all kind of props, I think like any actor. Like the
makeup,  and the clothes, and especially the piano. That's a really big prop. 
</P>
<P>I: Hide behind them. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>I: Well [mentions several names] want to know, as many people do, when your 
second album is coming out. 
</P>
<P>K: Well it should be out late this Autumn, hopefully October. 
</P>
<P>I: And this song will be on it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, it will, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: And Sophie Bell, there's a nice name... 
</P>
<P>K: It's great. 
</P>
<P>I: Sophie Bell of Rochester wants to know who's responsible for releasing
the tracks  that are released as singles? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I certainly have my idea of the singles that I want to release, and
I put them  forward. But they have to be agreed by the company, because
obviously the  company aims to sell records, and unless they think the single's
capable, they're  not going to release it. But so far we've agreed and it's been
great. 
</P>
<P>K: No quarrels, yet? 
</P>
<P>I: No, not yet. [Well....] 
</P>
<P>K: Right. 
</P>
<P>[Tape cuts here.] 
</P>
<P>I: Have you any hopes to branch out into films or to theatre. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I have hopes. No plans, though. I think that's very much something
that will  come along and I'll know when it is. And I don't think it's in the
near future. 
</P>
<P>I: Really? 
</P>
<P>K: No, I don't think so. I've got to much to do in music, I've only just
begun.  [Inaudible] 
</P>
<P>I: Well, we'll see. John Edmonds of Tapista wants to know, what will your
backing  band consist of, when you go on tour? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, we're not actually sure, as yet. Because we're going to need quite
a few  extra musicians, because with the production on the album, people are
going to  expect to hear the same quality when they come to see us live. But
we'll  obviously have drums, probably two guitarists, bass, hopefully some kind
of string  quartet, if not a synthesizer player, keyboard player. 
</P>
<P>I: And you're brothers, will they be with you? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I hope so, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: Keep it in the family. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: OK, well lets hear another song from you. Not live this time, we've got
it  recorded. It's at the special request of Karen and Tracey of Glasga, Gary 
Ackinson of Gateshead, and Loranda Richardson of Redding. And they would like 
to hear Kate singing The Man With The Child In His Eyes. 
</P>
<P>[The Man With The Child In His Eyes is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Now Kate, all that specialized movement, comes a question from Graham
Raderson  of Leeds, who wanted to know if you've been influence by mime artists
like  Marcel Marceau or Lindsey Kemp? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I've definitely been influenced by Lindsey Kemp, because he's one
of my  heroes and he was my teacher for a while. Mercel Marceau. I admire his
stuff,  but it's a little too, staid for me. You know, it's the art of illusion,
it's not really  the actual showing of emotion, which is really what Lindsey
teaches. And for me  that's perfect because it's what music and any form of art
is about, it's emotion,  it's from inside. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, here's another one from Cameron Underwood of Shefield. He asked
asks a  question that lots of people ask about a fan club. 
</P>
<P>K: Ah, right. [Looks at camera] Well hello Cameron, I remember you 'cause he
in  fact wrote to me the other day. 
</P>
<P>I: Really? 
</P>
<P>K: And your letter's in the post. [Both laugh] Yeah, we're forming a fan
club very  soon and I'd like to apologize to all the people who have written to
me, and I just  haven't managed to get around to replying to you, but it's on
the way, and we'll  inform you as soon as we've got something done. 
</P>
<P> I: Well, that's the thing. If you're successful you have little time for
other things. 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, but they write such wonderful letters, I mean it's incredible. It's
really  lovely. 
</P>
<P>I: One last question from Jane Fear of Dungannon. About your hair, what do
you do  to it, she loves it ? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, we just pull it out... Well I put henna on it because it is a very
good  conditioner, and it's like a mud and just all [makes slurping sound] slip
in on all  over, and I plait it and it makes it frizzy. 
</P>
<P>I: And that's that. 
</P>
<P>K: That's that. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, there you are Jane. It's up to you now. [Kate laughs]

<P>Thanks to Ron Hill for posting the Ask Aspel interview. I just wanted to say
that  those places where the tape cuts are places where Aspel is talking about
other  subjects, not with Kate.

-0800 <BR> Subject: Place names and Cathy 
</P>
<P>Ron &quot;fingers&quot; Hill had some problems with place names in some of
the (many)  interviews he has kindly been typing in. I know they are only very
minor things  (like children's addresses) but I can help with some. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Subject: Ask Aspel <BR> &gt; ...of Hampton Hills, Micheal Burch of
Wetherby, and Soleen Meean of Vardbee  [I have no idea if these names are right]

</P>
<P>Derby could have been misheard as Vardbee 
</P>
<P>&gt; I: Yes. Well it's a haunting song, certainly. Well now we've got
something for  Rebecca Maycok of Darbey 
</P>
<P>This one is Derby. 
</P>
<P>&gt; I: OK, well lets hear another song from you. Not live this time, we've
got it  recorded. It's at the special request of Karen and Tracey of Glasga,
Gary Ackinson  of Gateshead, and Loranda Richardson of Redding. 
</P>
<P>These are Glasgow ... and Reading. 
</P>
<P>&gt; I: Well, here's another one from Cameron Underwood of Shefield. 
</P>
<P>This is spelt Sheffield.
