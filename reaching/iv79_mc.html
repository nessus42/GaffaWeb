(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Musical Chairs -  &quot;Keef&quot; MacMillan, BBC 2
TV, March 7, 1979 
</P>
<P>31. Musical Chairs: Kate's appearance on the news magazine report about
Keith  &quot;Keef&quot; MacMillan's work, including the making of the Wow video,
BBC 2 TV,  March 7, 1979. This brief film focuses equally of MacMillan, Kate's
experience during  the making of the video, and the topical subject of the rise
of a then-new  phenomenon: the promotional music-video. Kate predicts a great
future for the  laser-video-disk, before the home video-cassette market had yet
taken off. Her  early prediction may well prove ultimately accurate, however.
This clip includes  footage of MacMillan directing the &quot;flying&quot;
special-effect which involved connecting  Kate to wires and hoisting her in the
air; as well as one or two brief shots of Kate  rehearsing the lip-synch.

<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED] 
</P>
<P>A: We'd like to tell you about a young man called Keith MacMillan, who makes
 video promotions for groups and singers. 
</P>
<P>[Scenes of setting up video] 
</P>
<P>A: We filmed him in the chilly surroundings of Wilton's [??? spelling] Music
Hall in  the East End of London. Keith MacMillan was working with Kate Bush.
He's also  worked with Blonde, David Essex, Abba, and countless others, but he
and Kate  Bush get on particularly well together. When we arrived, Keith
MacMillan was  stringing her up for a new sequence for &quot;Wow&quot; her new
single. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of Kate being hoisted into mid-air for filming.] 
</P>
<P>K: [In air] Wooo! [Everybody laughs] Oh, that's great! Oh, lovely! 
</P>
<P>A: Kate told us how they set to work inventing a new video promotion. 
</P>
<P>K: Well normally I have a routine that I work out, like I sort of form a
character, if  you like, for that particular song. And then we always get
together, like a week  before we film, and just and chat. And he comes up with
ideas and I do. And we  just work together and he's just so inspiring, he's
great. 
</P>
<P>KEEF: I started in the business as a photographer and sleeve designer. About
1968 I  started, I used to photo and design album sleeve covers and I did that
for seven or  eight years. I got a bit fed up doing that because I'd done
basically over a  thousand by then and I was just basically a little bored with
it. And [I] really  thought that the up and coming thing was film and
specifically video tape for the  music business. 
</P>
<P>	 One of my early successes and one I'm quite proud of was one I did for
Kate  Bush which I'll show you a little of. This was &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

</P>
<P>[The video is played] 
</P>
<P>KEEF: The record company loved that one and so did the broadcast companies
that  the record company gave it to. So, suddenly, really from that point onward
I was  asked to do more complex and more exciting type of tapes. And I think
that  particular tape illustrated that song very well and people, I think,
became aware  that you could make the visuals flow with the music and illustrate
the song in a  more pictorial way then had been done before. Before it had been
fairly straight  forward. 
</P>
<P>[A Blondie video is shown] 
</P>
<P>KEEF: Well I started making video promotional films two years and up till
now I  think we're nearing our three-hundredth production. I do seem to work
very  hard at the moment, I've been doing two or three a week. The problem is,
as  you've probably gathered, is keeping the ideas coming. But in this
particular  aspect I'm very lucky because basically I get the ideas from the
music itself and  from the artists and from their performance. The lyrics
obviously help, but I tend  not to be to literal on that, I try and just
basically get the flavor right. 
</P>
<P>[Scene of Kate in the air again] 
</P>
<P>KEEF: At the moment there isn't a direct market for these [videos] selling
to the  public, in this country. I mean, my whole production company is geared
up to  providing a service to the record companies to do what we do, make
promotional  film. In America now, they've started marketing the video disk. And
the first  few video disks [players] that came off the production lines in
January were  immediately snapped up, as were all the actual disks themselves.
So I think  there's... in the future there's going to be a huge market for
music-video disks,  where, instead of buying an ordinary album, you buy your
video disk, which gives  you better hi-fi. So you've got better hi-fi stereo
sound, with the option of  visuals, if you want them. 
</P>
<P>K: I think they have the most incredible potential, and I think people will
buy them,  yes. The only thing that I wonder about is boredom, because I think
when you  play a record again and again, if the visuals aren't abstract enough
or stunning  enough, they could become very tedious. But then again, people can
always switch  them off. But I think it will be very exciting, I think a lot of
revolutionary things  will come up. 
</P>
<P>[More scenes of the video being made] 
</P>
<P>KEEF: I tend to shoot video tape rather then film, for a number of reasons.
The  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; clip that you saw, we set it up on a monday
morning, we  shot it in the afternoon, we edited all night, and it was ready for
Top Of The Pops  the next morning. Well, if you'd done that on film, I think it
would've taken  about six months of opticals in the lab to get to that stage. On
video tape we can  act very fast, the record companies like that because if a
record breaks in the  charts they phone me up and say, &quot;Keef, we're sending
a motorcycle over with  this record, can you do it tomorrow?&quot; If I'm free,
I say yes. I listen to the music  overnight, we set the production up overnight,
we do it, we shoot it, we edit it. In  twenty-four hours you can have a complete
finished production.

 made.]
