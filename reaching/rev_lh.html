	 <P>20-year old Kate Bush caused quite a stir in Britain last year with a
		number one single,"Wuthering Heights",and a good debut LP to boot. With
		Lionheart, she consolidates her position as a major new female songwriter;her
		constant unpredictability giving each song a fascinatingly different yet
		alluring quality. The fantasy-like ambience that Kate's unusual voice gives her
		songs imbues them with an eerie, phantasmagoric feel and atmosphere,
		reminiscent of the warblings of some unearthly fairy princess.</P>
	 <P>If that sounds a bit wimpy, it's not. Kate Bush is a sensuous songwriter
		who never denies her own sexuality. Songs like "Symphony in blue" and "In the
		warm room" seethe with a warmth and passion unequalled by any current woman
		songwriter. Whether these songs are indicative of Kate's fantasies or realities
		remains unanswered, but sample these couplets from the latter tune: " In the
		warm room/ You'll fall into her like a pillow/ Her thighs are soft as
		marshmallows/Say hello,to the soft musk of her hollows." The singing itself is
		as impassioned as the action taking place in the song.</P>
	 <P>Bush is also unafraid to tackle gutsy and powerful material. The
		unusually contrasting slow then fast tempos of "Don't push your foot on the
		heartbreak",give Kate a chance to build tension and then wail like a banshee on
		the hard-rocking chorus,a sound unlike any thing else on record. Kate Bush is
		more than just another pretty face-as both singer and songwriter she's both
		unique and compelling.</P>
