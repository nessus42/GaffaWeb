</P>
<P>LIONHEART PROMO CASSETTE 
</P>
<P>Interviewer unknown <BR> 1978 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Thanks to Tom Richards for supplying me with the 
tape] 
</P>
<P>This is one of the most interesting interviews I've seen in a long time. It
is  apparently from an official EMI promotional cassette issued in Canada. 
</P>
<P>I: How did the sleeve design come about, of Lionheart? 
</P>
<P>K: Well that was just an idea that we had that was basically around the
title  Lionheart. We wanted to get across a vibe within me of a lion. And for
the front  cover it basically comes from an idea that my brother had, which was
an attic  setting with me in a lion suit, so it's slightly comical, but just a
really nice vibe on  the front that would take away the heavy, crusader, English
vibe, because  Lionheart is always associated with Richard the Lionheart. And I
think it's a  word that could become more readily used, it's such a beautiful
word. It's kinda  like hero, and hero's a very cliched word now. It's used in so
many songs. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Have you or will you be writing more songs on classic English themes? 
</P>
<P>K: Not intentionally, no. But I think that's already been done a little on
this album.  There's a song on in called &quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot; and
it's sorta about  childhood. And the book itself is an absolutely amazing
observation on paternal  attitudes and the relationships between the parents -
how it's reflected on the  children. And I think it's a really heavy subject,
you know, how a young  innocence mind can be just controlled, manipulated, and
they don't necessarily  want it to happen that way. And it's really just a song
about that. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Which have you most enjoyed recording, so far? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, I think I there are probably two, for me. I've really enjoyed
recording  &quot;Wow&quot;. I'm very, very pleased with my vocal performance on
that, because we  did it a few times, and although it was all in tune and it was
okay, there was just  something missing. And we went back and did it again and
it just happened, and  I've really pleased with that, it was very satisfying. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Can you tell me how you enjoyed recording in France? 
</P>
<P>K: Ah, it was an amazing experience. I mean it's the first time I've ever
recorded  out of the country. And the environment was really quite phenomenal, I
mean it  was just so beautiful, it was so unlike anything I'd seen for a long
while. And I  think there was so many advantages to it, but there were a couple
of  disadvantages - the fact that it was so beautiful, you couldn't help but
keep  drifting off to the sun out there, you know, that sort of thing. But you
just didn't  feel like you needed a break, because the vibes and the weather and
everyone  around was just so good, you know, you didn't feel like you were
working. It was  really, really fun. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbreak&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Can you tell me, why is it called Lionheart? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, again it's similar to the last album, in as much as it's the title
after the title  track. And the title track on this album is called &quot;Oh
England, My Lionheart.&quot;  And it's really very much a song about the Old
England that we all think about  whenever we're away, you know, &quot;ah, the
wonderful England&quot; and how beautiful  it is amongst all the rubbish, you
know. Like the old buildings we've got, the Old  English attitudes that are
always around. And this sort of very heavy emphasis on  nostalgia that is very
strong in England. People really do it alot, you know, like &quot;I  remember
the war and...&quot; You know it's very much a part of our attitudes to life 
that we live in the past. And it's really just a sort of poetical play on the,
if you  like, the romantic visuals of England, and the second World War...
Amazing  revolution that happened when it was over and peaceful everything
seemed, like  the green fields. And it's really just a exploration of that. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played.] 
</P>
<P>I: Did you find that this time writing the songs for the album came easily
to you, or  was it quite difficult? 
</P>
<P>K: It was a difficult situation because there was very little time around
and I felt  very squashed in by the lack of time and that's what I don't like,
especially if  it's concerning something as important for me as my songs are,
they're really  important to me. But it all seemed to come together and it was
really nicely  guided by something, it just happened great. And there were quite
a few old  songs that I managed to get the time to re-write. It's a much lighter
level of  work when you re-write a song because the basic inspiration is there,
you just  perfect upon it and that's great. And they're about four new songs so
they all  came together, it was great. In fact, we ended up with more then we
needed  again, which is fantastic. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Fullhouse&quot; is played.] 
</P>
<P>I: And where will you be touring? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, in February we're hoping to start in England, and then go on to
Europe. 
</P>
<P>I: And America? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think that's actually be thought of yet, I think we'll play it by
ear as we  often do when the time comes. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;In the Warm Room&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Have you got plans for the third album yet, or is it....? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, no. No, I think, that has to be written yet. I never think of it in
those terms  really. When we're still very much involved in this one, I think it
would be  unfair to neglect it. I think all the attention should be focused on
it, until the very  last fader has been lifted. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Kashka From Baghdad&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Are there any other tracks that you could explain the meanings of to us,
from the  album? 
</P>
<P>K: Yeah, well there's one called &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; which was in
fact inspired  directly from a cab driver that I met who was in fact a bit
nutty. And it's just a  song about someone who thinks they're being poisoned by
another person, they  think that there's Belladonna in their tea and that
whenever they offer them  something to eat, it's got poisen in it. And it's just
a humorous aspect of paranoia  really and we sort of done it in a Breteen [?]
style, the old sort of jamming [???  vibe] to try and bring across the humour
side of it. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>I: And a single, any idea of a single? 
</P>
<P>K: We've got a short list. And I'm sure we'll know which one it is, it'll
tell us in a  few days. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Hammer Horror&quot; is played.]
