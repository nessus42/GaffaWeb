<BR> Subject: Interview in 'Q', Dec. 93 
</P>
<P>The New 'Q' Interview with Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>By the way, someone with graphics capabilities should snatch up a copy of
this,  the December '93 issue of 'Q', because there are four stupendous new
large color  portrait photos of Kate, one of which is the cover. Never has she
looked more  mature, or more striking. 
</P>
<P>For no apparent reason except sheer bloody-mindedness, the cover bears the 
inscription: 
</P>
<P>&quot;'Booze, fags, blokes and me.' KATE BUSH IN THE Q INTERVIEW.&quot;
</P>
<P>Although she does briefly respond to questions about drinking and smoking,
she  never uses any of the above language, making the quotation marks completely
 unfair. The interview, which appears below, is however not bad. The photos also
 shows what may or may not be a Bush-owned property; there is no explicit 
identification of the locale for the photos (the interview is described as
having taken  place in a dubbing studio). Certainly Kate herself is making new
statements, ones  which in some cases wholly contradict things she has said in
dozens of earlier  interviews; and the general tone she manages to transmit (in
spite of the journalistic  filter) is fascinatingly different from that which
has characterized her speech  heretofore. Enjoy.

<H2>Little Miss Can't Be Wrong </H2>
<P>&quot;She might be a self-confessed power head, prone to control freakery
and  studio-hermitdom and a total stranger to the nightclub dancefloor...&quot;but
I'm never  grumpy,&quot; Kate Bush tells Stuart Maconie. &quot;I like to think
I'm quite a happy little  soul.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Catherine Bush, 35, a doctor's daughter from Welling, finishes her
mid-afternoon  vegetarian meal and brings her goblet of red wine through into
the small adjoining  office, with its high window and battered typewriter, deep
in the bowels of a  dubbing studio in Cricklewood. &quot;Do you mind if I don't
sit behind the desk,&quot; she  begins nervously, Silk Cut already en route to
famous mouth, &quot;but it will seem a bit  like a job interview.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Job interviews, one suspects, are an area in which Kate Bush has had limited
 experience, having held the position of waif-like songstrel by appointment
since the  age of 17. Later, we shall enquire what she does for fun. But already
it's obvious  what she doesn't do. Interviews. Right down at the foot of the
list with slam  dancing, casual abattoir work and unanaesthetized surgery we
would wager. It's not  that Kate Bush is anything less than charm, elegance and
fragrance during  interviews. Rather that behind the winsome smile and girlish
laugh, there's the  seasoned reluctance of a woman who decided at 21 that
spending twice as much time  talking about her records as she did making them
was a pretty preposterous state of  affairs. 
</P>
<P>By her own admission, this has been a difficult 18 months. Her new album The
 Red Shoes was begun, as all the others, with good intentions of an early
finish, soon  to dissipate into another protracted bout of studio work, moving,
at times, as if  through treacle whilst wearing diver's boots. &quot;It's
ridiculous, isn't it? Three years to  make a record. The worst is the stuff is
often written very quickly. A day, a day and  a half, but once you get into the
studio, it starts to take on a life of its own. But I  wouldn't understand it if
I wasn't involved. I'd think it was outrageous.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On a personal note, her mother died, a tragedy at the best of times but 
particularly to someone whose family ties are as indissolubly knit as Kate's.
(She has  never had a manager [Not quite true, actually; there were two back in
the early days  -- IED] and her business affairs have always been handled by the
Bushes  themselves.) And, at a time when she should have been lighting cigars
and wetting  The Red Shoes' head, she's found herself rushing to complete
another  long-standing project, her directorial debut with the 50-minute
[elsewhere described  as only 40-minutes -- fair warning] feature The Line, The
Curve and The Cross.  Featuring Kate herself, Miranda Richardson and mime guru
Lindsay Kemp, it's a  fairy tale revolving around six of the songs from The Red
Shoes. &quot;Ideally I would  have had more time, but I didn't think of it until
after I'd finished the album. But  the people were great. It was humbling having
all these specialists working on  something I'd thought up. It was quite brave
of me in some ways, I think. And I  would do it again, but I'd just fancy a
little walk-on this time,&quot; she says with the  prospect of two more weeks
dubbing in darkest Cricklewood before the film is  premiered at the London Film
Festival this month. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's career falls neatly in half like a well-thumbed book, the broken
 spine in this instance being The Dreaming, 1982's &quot;difficult&quot; album.
Prior to this,  Bush had established her stellar reputation with a debut Number
1 single at 19 with  Wuthering Heights and a trio of albums that revealed her as
rock's premier ingenue  --precocious (she apparently wrote The Man With the
Child In His Eyes at 12),  beautiful, talented and with the ability to turn
everything from incest, sexual  yearning towards infants, the threat of nuclear
incineration and Delius into limpid  ballads and new-minted pop-rockers. Grown
men and women alike cooed, DJs said  &quot;Great Lady!&quot; and Bobby Davro and
Faith Brown clogged up Saturday evening TV  with unfunny impressions of her
unrestricted performing style (although, weirdly,  Kate once wrote a four-page
letter of congratulation to Faith Brown). 
</P>
<P>She is oddly disparaging of albums like Lionheart and Never For Ever now and
 even then seemed keen to leave this phase behind, perhaps understandably -- she
 had been given two years to write the songs for The Kick Inside and, allegedly,
four  weeks to come up with Lionheart. By 1982 she was under the influence of
Peter  Gabriel and the revolutionary drum sound of Phil Collins's In The Air
Tonight.  Determined to do something like this herself, she became locked into a
hellishly  expensive round of aborted studio stints, finally emerging with The
Dreaming, easily  her weirdest effort and one that effectively stalled her
career, peaking at Number 3  (Never For Ever entered at Number 1) and spawning a
batch of flop singles. Wild  rumours abounded, including the choice story
advanced by the Daily Mail that she  had ballooned up to 18 stone. This was
patently untrue but she *had* ground herself  down into a state of nervous
fatigue, not helped by a reputed diet of junk food and  chocolate. It was not
the happiest of times. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I look back at that record and it seems mad,&quot; she says now. &quot;I
heard it about  three years ago and couldn't believe it. There's a lot of anger
in it. There's a lot of  'I'm an artist, right!'&quot; Fingers burned by the
experience of The Dreaming, she  decided that a studio of her own and a retreat
into her domestic shell was a priority.  Thus was ushered in a period of
stability from whence came the enormously  successful Hounds of Love and, in
1990 [1989], The Sensual World. These later  records reflected her growing
interest in the studio as a compositional tool and her  growing desire to stay
well out of the public eye. 
</P>
<P>The Red Shoes is a return to a more direct style. Rubberband Girl is the
poppiest  thing she's essayed in 10 years, the long-awaited Prince collaboration
Why Do I Love  You? [sic] can barely contain its own exuberance and
Constellation Of The Heart is a  happy experiment with disco-funk. Kate Bush
would rather talk about the whys and  wherefores of her art than about anything
else. Her personal life is off limits; but  given this, she agrees -- helpfully
but warily, and lighting another Silk Cut as she  goes -- to talk a little about
Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>What do you do for fun? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I make records (laughs). There's a lot of other stuff that I like to
do. But I find  making records really exciting. It's making something out of
nothing and you can  involve other people. It's brilliant.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But what do you do when you're not making records? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I don't listen to records. I tend to watch a lot of films. I
tend to work quite  late and I tend to put in quite long hours. If you work like
that, you don't get a  great social life. I watch a lot of comedy. I suppose
it's the same if you work in  film: You don't want to watch films to relax. You
want to give those particular  senses a rest.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So what makes you laugh? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Lots of stuff. I think it's an incredible gift to be able to make
people laugh. It's not  just a question of guts, it's having the talent to
achieve it. I can't think of  anything braver than being a stand-up comedian. I
suppose you must learn a lot  about yourself. Even if you get booed off you must
get so much insight. I love all  kinds of stuff. I still think Fawlty Towers is
the best sitcom ever. I like Python, I  like Ben Elton, I like what Rik and Ade
do. We've got a load of good comics  here...and a lot of good comediennes, which
is nice.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Could you do it? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, I don't have that gift for comedy. I love having a laugh but there
are people  who do it so well I wouldn't dare to presume I could do it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you grown up in public? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think I have grown up in quite a strange way, but then a lot
of people  do...and a lot of people don't grow up at all. But it's been unusual,
yes. In  public? Well, I'm very grateful that people have wanted to listen to my
music.  It's more like them that have grown up with me. People from way back who
 became fans, they're still there. There's still the odd name I recognise.
People  have grown up with my music and they identify periods of their life with
it. I find  that lovely. It's very difficult to get to grips with the idea of
someone playing  your stuff at home. It's a very strange idea to be taken into
all these people's  houses.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you read your fan mail? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I used to read much more than I do. I don't seem to have the time to
get involved  in that any more. People are just so sweet, so encouraging,
sometimes it's the best  thing to get an encouraging letter, particularly if
you're in one of those phases  where you can't seem to get ahead. It's just nice
to read a letter that says, 'I  really like your music and good luck with the
new record and everything.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>You are famously uncynical. Or at least, you were. Has all that changed? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it has. I think it's impossible to move through this business
-- in fact, it's  impossible to move through life without adopting a bit of
cynicism. It's a  protective and defensive thing. People are going to rip you
off, they're going to  stitch you up, and if you're cynical, it prepares you for
the reality of this. It  prepares you for things that, chances are, are going to
happen to you (laughs).&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you ever lose your temper? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah. How can you be human and not? It's healthy for you. I used to
see it as  totally negative, when I was much more uncynical (laughs). I'm not so
sure now.  It's quite a motivator, you know.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Would you make a good therapist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really don't know. When I was little, I really wanted to be a
psychiatrist. That's  what I always said at school. I had this idea of helping
people, I suppose, but I  found the idea of people's inner psychology
fascinating, particularly in my teens.  Mind you, it's probably just as well I
didn't become one. I would have driven all  these people to madness. I'm better
off just fiddling around in studios.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What newspapers and magazines do you read? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't, really. I find them all slightly biased and angry in their
own ways, and  generally I prefer the radio or the television, especially where
news is concerned.  I know the television is biased too, but it doesn't seem as
sort of characterised as  the press. And magazines I don't read at all, I'm
afraid. I did for a while and  found them quite boring and slightly
manipulative. I thought a lot of magazines  were trying to -- or if not trying
to, then ending up, making you feel inadequate.  I didn't think a lot of healthy
things were going on in them. I had friends who  got magazines regularly and
they were getting more and more concerned about  them, more and more obsessed
with the articles and the quizzes. It took me a  long time to grow out of The
Beano, though, so perhaps I'm just not grown up  enough for magazines.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Which of your old songs make you wince? 
</P>
<P>&quot;My God, loads. Absolutely loads. Either the lyric's not thought out
properly or it's  just crap or the performances weren't well executed. But you
have to get it in  context. You were doing it at the time and it was the best
you could do then.  You've got to live with it. Some of those early songs,
though, you think, 'What  was I *thinking* about? Did *I* write that?'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Like what? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I can't name one. There's not just one. There were too many to
mention. But I was  very young, so I can be gentle on myself for that. Having
said that, I think some  of my lyrics were just, well, mad, really. And why not!
You've got to be prepared  to fail and get a bit hurt or bruised along the way.&quot;

</P>
<P>As someone who's written a very stirring song about England (Oh England My 
Lionheart), will you always be happiest here? 
</P>
<P>(Astonished:) &quot;Do you like that one? That's one of the ones I meant. It
makes me  just want to die. There's just something about that time. It's such an
old song.  Ooh God, I haven't heard it for so long. Must have been on tour in
1979. Anyway,  England, yeah, I am happiest here. We're a funny race, we give
each other such a  hard time, don't you think? One thing we take very, very
seriously is this whole  business of taking the piss, the whole stuff about
irony. I think there's a real  integrity about us under all the layers and our
sense of humour is so strong. I've  always felt pulled to Ireland because my
mother was Irish, but whenever I've  gone, I've never felt very at home. So I've
played with the idea of staying there.  I'm not sure I really could live
anywhere else but here. But it might be  interesting. For a while.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Could you manage on a croft in the Outer Hebrides? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, I think I probably could. There'd come a point when I'd have to
come up for  air, but a lot of my ways would suit that kind of life quite well,
particularly if you  wanted to do some writing. You can quite handle a very
introverted lifestyle, but  when that's finished, it's nice to get out. Do
something different. But I'd love to  end up somewhere quiet in the country.&quot;

</P>
<P>You wouldn't miss the bright lights? 
</P>
<P>(Glances ruefully through window at Cricklewood drizzle:) &quot;I think I
could manage  it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you got any heroes or heroines? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm a really big fan of the English director Michael Powell. I just
had this phase of  really being into old film directors. Like Hitchcock. His
stories are just so clever.  So lots of film directors are, well, not heroes but
strongly admired. A hero  suggests something inhuman to me. And my favourite
people and those dearest to  me are very human and have such weaknesses, and
that's what makes them  special. They're not larger than life or inaccessible. I
like quiet people and their  funny ways.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If you were casting yourself, what part would you be good at? 
</P>
<P>&quot;God! What would I be good as? A learner driver. I do drive. It's not
my driving  I'm not happy with. I just feel that's how I go through life --
behind the wheel,  pretending I know how to drive when in fact I'm only
learning.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You wouldn't make a good Lady Macbeth? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Lady Macbeth? (Laughs) No. To tell you the truth, I'm not that
intrigued by acting.  If someone offered me something really interesting,
especially someone I  admired, I'd do it because I'd be crazy not to. But I'm no
actress. I don't have  the talent or the temperament.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you cry at soppy films? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, if it's the right thing, though not as much as I used. I used to
be very  emotionally based. I'm not so sure I am now. Things can still make me
cry,  though, particularly music. Like the first time I heard the Trio Bulgarka.
It's just  sound. I didn't understand what they were saying, but I wasn't the
only one  sitting there weeping. Music has that way, doesn't it? You just go.&quot;

</P>
<P>Have you got into grunge yet? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Err, no. I like a lot of diverse music, but nothing really wild.
Nothing very odd. I  don't watch The Sound of Music every night or
anything...But what is  unexpected these days? I like classical music, but I
wish I was more eloquent  with it. I hear things and think, 'That's beautiful,'
but don't know what it is. As  you get older, you do get more into instrumental
music, don't you? It's as if as  you get older you don't want people telling you
what they think or what you've  got to think or do. Also, those great composers
really knew what they were  doing. A lot of contemporary art is made by people
who haven't got any talent.  Art made by talentless people can sometimes really
work, but it's not the same  as real craft.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you worry about getting old? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't actually worry about aging, but I am at a point when I'm older
than I was  and there's a few things I'd like to be doing with my life. I've
spent a lot of time  working and I'd like to catch up. Over the next few years
I'd like to take some  time off.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What particular catching up would you like to do? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, nothing very significant or particular. Nothing, really...just
travel and have some  holidays. It's silly that I haven't taken more breaks.
I've spent a long time in the  city and I love being by the sea, and I'm
starting to pine for it. I'd like to put  energy into stuff like that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How self-centred are you? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Quite a lot, probably. I must be because of my work. It's all to do
with delving into  the self. That's how humans function. You're relating stuff
all the time to  yourself. My work is very selfish. But it's very meaningful to
me when I see a  letter saying that somehow it's helped someone else. It's quite
a selfish thing that  I do. And I'm becoming more aware as I get older of
wanting to be more, well,  giving to others. Like making this film: it feels
better that the group is larger and  there's more interaction.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Quite apart from the Prince collaboration, how do you get the likes of Lenny
Henry,  Eric Clapton and Nigel Kennedy to play on your records? 
</P>
<P>&quot;You just phone them up. It's that basic. The main worry is getting up
the guts to do  it. Some people are kind of mates, so you just hope that you
won't end up  embarrassing each other. But with the others, you just have to get
up the nerve to  call them.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you believe in the paranormal? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Is that it? 
</P>
<P>(Smiling:) &quot;Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>O.K. Do you like shopping? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I used to like it a lot, but I find it difficult now. I don't have a
lot of time. I always  feel that I'm rushing in and out to get stuff. People
help me get a lot of my  shopping when I'm busy, so I'm a bit removed from it.
But I used to love it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you get stopped in the street? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, not really. Sometimes people will come up, but I don't generally
get stopped in  the street. People tend to just smile at you. But you may have
your trousers on  back to front. It may not be anything to do with fame.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You don't go out in Michael Jackson-style diguise? 
</P>
<P>(Laughing:) No, I'm not sure people care that much. Occasionally I see them 
nudging each other, but I feel it's more part of American culture, that idea of 
TV fame and celebrity. It's more of a laugh here, isn't it? 'Look, there's that 
bloke off the telly!'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you into sport? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Not really. I sometimes wish I was. I see friends getting enormous
pleasure out of  watching Wimbledon or something, but no, not for me, I'm
afraid. Sometimes I  enjoy watching athletes and gymnasts. But that's maybe
because of dancing. I like  dancing because there's the combination of music and
athleticism without the  competition that's integral to sport.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you go out dancing? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I used to for a very short phase. Of course, when I was little the
aunts would drag  me up and get me to dance, and I'd love that. I had a phase as
a teenager when a  group of us would go dancing. But then I got famous after my
first record and  I'm not sure I had the desire to do it any more. It was
something I did in my  teens. But I've never felt very comfortable with it. Not
unless I'm really drunk.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you get drunk often? 
</P>
<P>(Pause, smile:) &quot;No, not really. I don't go out clubbing and all that.
I don't make an  exhibition of myself out on the floor.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What's the worst thing about being a musician? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think of myself as a musician.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What then? 
</P>
<P>&quot;As a writer, I suppose. I only ever play the piano to accompany myself
singing. I  could never sit and read a piece of music. At best, I'm an
accompanist. [This from  the person who played the guitar solo on Big Stripey
Lie! -- IED] I suppose the  worst thing is frustration at your own ability. Not
being able to do what you want  to do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Is there a song you're in awe of? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yeah. Plenty of things I'd like to have written. Lots of Beatles
songs, for  instance. They were just so beautifully, beautifully written, and
they still stand up,  and for pop music it's so well crafted. On every level:
not just the songs but the  arrangements and the vocal performances. There's
quite a few Beefheart and  Zappa, too. Early Roxy Music songs. Loads of 'em,
really. It's interesting how  many young people are getting into old records,
because there's a buzz they just  can't get from contemporary music. Look how
many old songs are hits again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you ever had any embarrassing crushes? 
</P>
<P>(Laughs:) &quot;None that really embarrass me, no. At one point I had this,
well, I don't  know if you'd call it a crush, a bit of one on Elton John. I
thought he was  fantastic. I thought he was so clever. It was before he got
really famous...around  Madman Across the Water. I thought he was so wonderful.
I'd play the records  and dream of being able to play like him, those fantastic
hands. But a crush like  that is quite sweet, isn't it? I had David Bowie on my
wall, as well.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you a member of anything? Are you a good joiner-in? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, I'm afraid not. I was never a Girl Guide. I'm a bit of a loner. I
love being with  people but I've never been one for clubs. But again I was quite
young when I  began to do this work, so I was putting my energies into different
things from  what my friends were doing. Not that I missed out on a childhood or
anything  dramatic like that. But it was around the age that a lot of my friends
were joining  groups and going to youth clubs and discos.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you proud of what you've done? 
</P>
<P>(Long pause.) &quot;On some levels, yes. I'm proud of having faced up to
difficult times  and situations and finshing projects that felt like they would
never be finished.  But I have spent a lot of time working. I'd like to redress
the balance. I haven't  wasted any of my life yet, but I'm a bit fed up with
being stuck in a studio. I  shouldn't complain. It's a privilege, really.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you an optimist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was when I was young. More than an optimist -- an idealist. That
goes hand in  hand with youth: you're either anarchic or optimistic. I had such
a positive  attitude. I wish I had as much now as I did then. Some of the
positivity is gone.  But on the whole I'm more positive than negative. I'm never
grumpy. I like to  think I'm quite a happy little soul.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And, finally, are you a recluse and a publicity-shy enigma? 
</P>
<P>&quot;That does amuse me. Well, the reclusive thing is because I don't go
clubbing and I  don't do a lot of publicity. I'm a quiet, private person who has
managed to hang  around for a few years. Ridiculous, really. I didn't think it
would be like this. All  I wanted to do was make an album. That was the dream.
I'd been writing songs  since I was little and I just wanted to see them on an
album. This was my purpose  in life -- to just look at the grooves and think, I
did that. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And then from my first record my life was very dramatically changed.
My music  was popular instantly. It's a pressure. You can't quietly get on with
it. But it was  so exciting. My life was turned upside down very fast when I was
very young. I  was quite a way down the road before I got a chance to look back.
At the time it  just all seemed like a laugh. That was healthy, though. Keep
laughing and you  stand a chance of getting through it alive.&quot;
