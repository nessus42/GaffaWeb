<P ALIGN="left"><i>After a 12-year absence, British rock enigma Kate Bush 
returns to the fertile musical landscape she helped create</i></P>
<p>In the weird cast of eccentric, renegade geniuses credited with having 
influenced the course of late 20th-century pop music, Kate Bush is perhaps 
weirder, more eccentric, more of a renegade and more influential than most. </p>
<p>Not that she cares. </p>
<p>&quot;I've never been aware of inspiring others,&quot; she says over the phone from her 
home in Reading, England, on the eve of the release this Tuesday of Aerial, her 
first album in 12 years. </p>
<p>&quot;That was never my intention. You do the best you can ... that's all I care 
about.&quot; </p>
<p>A child prodigy who burst into public view in 1978, Bush churned out seven 
extemporaneous, genre-defying albums in the following 15 years. </p>
<p>She also released a string of groundbreaking videos, undertook one strange 
and fantastic tour before retreating, apparently forever, to her home studio, 
and in 1993, disappeared completely, leaving a legion of mythically devoted fans 
puzzled and gasping for more. </p>
<p>Bush might have remained one of the curiosities of the 1980s Britpop 
explosion had it not been for a steady stream in subsequent years of performers 
who clearly owe much to her vision and style. Hip-hop star Antwan &quot;Big Boi&quot; 
Patton of OutKast has called Bush his &quot;No. 1 musical influence next to Bob 
Marley.&quot; And if that's hard to believe, try listening to Björk, Sarah McLachlan, 
Dido, Fiona Apple or Tori Amos without conjuring Kate Bush. </p>
<p>Her passion, frankness and musical daring with electronic and symphonic 
structures has its roots in 1970s British prog rock, but Bush, who's now 47, is 
one of those rare and preternaturally gifted artists whose work stands outside 
time, impervious to musical trends and changes in social, economic and political 
patterns. </p>
<p>In fact, the time away from the music biz whirl has passed so quickly for her 
that she barely feels it, she says. </p>
<p>&quot;I've been having a good time. I've been raising my son (Bertie, aged 7), and 
living a quiet life, shopping, cleaning my house, going to movies with friends. 
And I've been recording, taking my time. Once I start recording, I have to make 
it as good as I can. This album didn't start out to be as big as it is, but by 
the time it was finished, I'd been at it for almost five years. I have a 
reputation for being overambitious.&quot; </p>
<p>Cheerful and talkative — except when it comes to details of her personal life 
— Bush sounds genuinely at a loss to explain her reputation in the media as a 
wacky recluse. </p>
<p>&quot;Reclusive, mysterious and weird — it's ridiculous, isn't it? Just because 
I've chosen to live a normal life, and not in the public eye. I've never 
promoted myself, I'm not a celebrity, I'm a worker, and I don't see a reason to 
do interviews unless there's something to talk about, a piece of work. </p>
<p>&quot;I don't hide from people. I go shopping, I go to restaurants and movies ... 
yet somehow I'm made out to be some mad hermit. It's too much. </p>
<p>&quot;I think my cult following got grumpy waiting so long,&quot; she laughs. </p>
<p>That all sounds a bit disingenuous in light of the number of high-end 
European art and fashion photographers whose ubiquitous images of Bush created 
at least the impression of a showbiz diva between 1978 and 1990, when an 
eight-CD anthology appeared in the box set This Woman's Work — complete with a 
colour booklet containing nothing but these extravagant portraits. <br>
<br>
In lieu of personal appearances — erroneous reports of stage fright that have 
apparently prevented her from touring after 1979 are another bone of contention 
with her — fans have had nothing to fuel their addiction other than Bush's wild, 
rich and allusive music, and magnificent, stylized graphics. </p>
<p>&quot;I never consciously gave up touring,&quot; she explains. &quot;I only did just one, in 
1979 and 1980, and I think other people gave up on me. I remember it as a 
fantastic experience, like being on the road with a circus. We're working on 
some ideas about doing some shows to promote this album, but it's early days.&quot;
</p>
<p>And she says she has no regrets about the image she helped create, though 
Aerial comes unadorned with large and ornate likenesses of her, and instead 
features realistic images of the ornaments of an ordinary village life — washing 
on the line, a view from the kitchen window, a placid seashore, pigeons in the 
yard. </p>
<p>&quot;Graphics are important,&quot; she adds, by way of explaining the effort that went 
into designing the honeyed landscape artwork for Aerial. &quot;This may sound 
pompous, but I'm uncomfortable working with the CD format. I used to work in 
vinyl, when the artwork was big, and said something significant about an artist.
</p>
<p>&quot;And I loved double albums. They indicated that the music was conceptual, too 
important to be reduced, and you could open up the covers and get lost in the 
pictures and information inside. </p>
<p>&quot;I liked it when an album was 20 minutes of music a side, with a breathing 
space in the middle. I think CDs are too long for people with short attention 
spans, people who are distracted by all the technological tools we have these 
days.&quot; </p>
<p>The Aerial format, she explains, is a respectful nod to the great days of 
vinyl. The package contains two discs, both around 40 minutes in length, the 
first a collection of single songs, the second a conceptual piece that unfolds 
as a musical panorama encompassing the span of a single day, with vast dreams 
and powerful reminiscences inspired by simple sounds of nature, the words of 
passers-by and routine chores. </p>
<p>The album lacks the frenetic pace and bluster of her last conceptual effort, 
1985's Hounds Of Love, and achieves an almost elegiac, English pastoral grace. 
Several songs feature just vocals and piano, and expose matters closer to her 
heart than the turgid melodramas of her earlier work: the joy childhood brings 
in &quot;Bertie,&quot; memories of her late mother in the eerie but strangely comforting 
waterscape &quot;A Coral Room,&quot; the bucolic &quot;Sky Of Honey&quot; with its compelling echoes 
of Vaughan Williams. Orchestral charts were written by award-winning composer 
Michael Kamen, who died of a heart attack at age 55 in 2003. They were recorded 
just weeks before his death. </p>
<p>&quot;He was a lovely person, very talented and brave,&quot; Bush recalls. &quot;I'd worked 
with him on other albums, and he was never offended if I suggested changes — 
he'd rewrite arrangements on the spot, even with the orchestra waiting in the 
studio. I admire his work for its visual qualities.&quot; </p>
<p>While it's debatable, as acolytes claim, that Kate Bush's impact on Western 
music and female artists in particular is as profound as Joni Mitchell's, it 
can't be denied that Bush has attracted more than a fair share of serious 
attention from new artists in the years since her so-called self-exile began. 
This includes R&amp;B singer Maxwell, whose reworking of Bush's childbearing 
chronicle &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; was a hit in 2001, as well as male-dominated 
British rock acts Placebo and The Futureheads, who scored a hit last year with a 
version of her &quot;Hounds of Love.&quot; </p>
<p>Her beginnings were more than auspicious. Bush was &quot;discovered&quot; at age 16 by 
Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. He who paid for an orchestra to back her 
distinctive, hyperbolic soprano on demos of several elaborately theatrical, 
sexually loaded romantic fantasies that would become the core, three years 
later, of her hair-raising debut, The Kick Inside. </p>
<p>Though she had nothing in common with the post-punk, new wave acts with whom 
she shared the high end of the charts — she was genteel, well educated, and 
possessed of aesthetic and artistic sensibilities that had less to do with rock 
than with the progressive side of opera, world music, jazz, musical theatre and 
epic cinema — she became the darling of British prog-rock. Peter Gabriel gave 
her a nod by recording the moving duet, &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; with her in 1986. Procol 
Harum member Gary Brooker's organ and vocal contributions anchor Aerial, an 
exotic two-CD set. </p>
<p>Some pieces on Aerial will remind fans of the daring Kate Bush of old: &quot;Pi&quot; 
is little more than a series of numbers sung with dramatic extremes of emotion; 
&quot;King Of The Mountain,&quot; the first single, is a contemplation on celebrity and 
its cost, with direct references to Elvis; in &quot;Mrs. Bartolozzi,&quot; a washing 
machine becomes a sexual allegory in the romantic fantasies of a cleaning woman.
</p>
<p>&quot;After seven years with Bertie, I know a lot about washing machines,&quot; Bush 
chuckles. &quot;He keeps me normal. I never wanted to be famous. I just want to 
create nice music, and I believe celebrity threatens creativity. </p>
<p>&quot;What's important to me is to have a soul — and my lovely little boy.&quot;</p>
