<P>Date: Sat, 6 Jan 90 21:07:18 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Dirty Linen 
</P>
<P>There's an article about Kate in the Winter issue of Dirty Linen, a magazine
 published in Baltimore. For those worried about copyright infringement, I
should say  that this magazine says, &quot;Excerpts and entire reviews my be
reprinted as long as  credit is given to the author, artist, or photographer and
Dirty Linen magazine.&quot; I  intend to do that. Here's the article: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: In Focus 
</P>
<P>by John Anthony Wilcox 
</P>
<P>&quot;Imagination sets in, <BR> then all the voices begin.&quot; 
</P>
<P>-- from &quot;Fullhouse&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush. In the U.K. and Europe the name invokes memories of a seemingly 
endless string of hits. &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Babooshka,&quot; &quot;Sat
in Your Lap,&quot;  &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot;
the list goes on and on. But in the States,  it's a different story. Here, La
Diva Bush has only obtained a small, albeit devoted,  audience. Her music is
alternately wistful, folky, gutsy, and passionate. Perhaps it's  the inability
for the public to pigeonhole her into one concrete style of music that  has let
stardom elude Bush here. No matter. What Kate Bush the 
singer/songwriter/performer/producer presents has very little to do with stardom
 and quite a bit to do with substance and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>In a conversation I had with Kate Bush a while back, she mentioned that she 
seldom, if ever, wrote in an autobiographical context. She much preferred
creating  characters, and the songs were stories either about them or from their
point of view.  One need look no further than her introduction to the public --
the song  &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; She relates the story of obsessive love
from the viewpoint ot  the deceased Cathy and her beyond-the-grave love for
Heathcliff. Bronte would  surely find no fault in Kate Bush's homage to her
timeless characters. &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot; was a prelude to Bush's
debut album The Kick Inside. The album  showcased a fragile, imaginative young
woman and focused on delicate piano (played  by Kate) and lush arrangements to
counterpoint Bush's willowy multi-octave voice.  Her sophomore album, Lionheart,
was much in the same vein. Perhaps *too* much. 
</P>
<P>Lionheart came across as a somewhat lightweight Xerox of The Kick Inside but
 with less substance. However, for all its faults, the album did contain a few
gems  among the pebbles. &quot;Fullhouse,&quot; &quot;Wow,&quot; and &quot;In
the Warm Room&quot; are very strong  compositions, and &quot;Wow&quot; in
particular is to date the closest Kate has come to writing  about herself. This
album was also backed by a brief but memorable tour that  yielded both the Kate
Bush: Live at the Hammersmith Odeon videocassette and the  live EP On Stage.
This would mark an end to a chapter in Kate's career, as the next  release
brought us a new and different performer. 
</P>
<P>1980 saw the release of Never for Ever. With it, Bush took a more active
hand in  every facet of her music -- from concept to arranging to producing, she
was in on  every step. The album opens with &quot;Babooshka,&quot; a tale of
infidelity, and closes with  &quot;Breathing,&quot; a prayer for our Earth. In
between, Never for Ever offers a cornucopia  of styles, and an impressive array
of guests. Look for contributions from Preston  Heyman to Mike Moran to Roy
Harper (Kate would return the favor by appearing  on Harper's The Unknown
Soldier disc that same year). The album is full of  mandolin, balalaika,
bodhran, and even a strumento de porco, thanks in no small part  to Kate's
brother Paddy, a specialist in ethnic instruments. 
</P>
<P>As big a step as Never for Ever was from Lionheart, 1982's The Dreaming was
a  giant *leap* from Never for Ever. A caustic, dark album full of cynicism and 
shattered dreams, The Dreaming puts aside Bush's inherent romanticism in favor
of  kinetic energy. Bush whoops, snarls, and quivers her way through the
predominently  percussive &quot;Sat in Your Lap,&quot; &quot;Get Out of My
House,&quot; and &quot;Suspended in Gaffa,&quot; to  name a few. But it is the
title cut that shows Kate Bush at her strongest, her most  confident. &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; relates the plight of the Aborigines and is punctuated by 
authentic digeridoo and Bullroarer. Bush handles it all with sensitivity and
respect  for all involved. 
</P>
<P>By that time Kate was in full control of every aspect of her musical
endeavors and  clearly loving it. That buoyancy is reflected in 1985's Hounds of
Love. Side one of  Hounds... showcases Kate Bush, the quirky pop princess in &quot;Running
Up That Hill,&quot;  &quot;The Big Sky,&quot; and the title cut. Bright and
poppish, they are full of color and  sparkle. They are contrasted by &quot;The
Ninth Wave,&quot; a side-long concept piece. Kate  informed me that &quot;The
Ninth Wave&quot; relates a tale of a drowning person who  encounters their past,
present, and future. Cheer up, folks, there's a happy ending.  Folkaholics
should note that members of Planxty turn up on this epic to provide  some
musical wonder to a section entitled &quot;Jig of Life.&quot; Once again,
another chapter  in Kate Bush's story closes, and the 1986 retrospective The
Whole Story is a fine  souvenir, collecting many of her finest moments as well
as a new tune, &quot;Experiment  IV&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Which brings us to 1989. After a lengthy hiatus, Bush came back with The 
Sensual World. It's clearly her most &quot;global&quot; effort to date,
incorporating rhythms  and instrumentation from such diverse sources as the
Middle East and the Balkan  countries. One of the most well-known Bulgarian
groups, The Trio Bulgarka,  provides authentic vocals. Lyrically, Bush is
delving more into relationships and less  into creating stories from whole
cloth. Songs like &quot;Never Be Mine,&quot; &quot;Reaching Out,&quot;  and &quot;Between
a Man and a Woman&quot; are her most direct yet. Curiously, she also  chose to
include an older song, the delicate &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;, which
originally  appeared a few years back on the motion picture soundtrack to She's
Having My  Baby [sic]. Also, in a tip of the hat to her mentor, Pink Floyd's
David Gilmour, who  was responsible for getting Kate her big break, lends some
blazing guitar to the  album. 
</P>
<P>It should be noted that Kate Bush doesn't lie idle between albums. She's
guested  on several other artist's albums, as well as turning up on the odd
soundtrack or two.  Bush has also lent her considerable talents to several
charitable organizations, most  recently to the preservation of the rain
forests. This woman's work is clearly far  from finished!
