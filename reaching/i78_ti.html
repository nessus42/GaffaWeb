<H3 ALIGN="center">Tales of<BR> Christmas Past</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="center">For song-writing, singing sensation Kate Bush<BR> Christmas
is a family occasion with Dickensian<BR> overtones. Jan Etherington has been
talking to<BR> the girl whose first record topped the charts and<BR> whose
first album won a gold disc.

<P>Photo caption 1: This beautiful red dress in heavy satin  dates from the

at Pot Pourri, which  specialises in original clothes.</P>
<P>IT'S a great compliment in a business where comparisons  are a way of  life
and most things are derivative, that Kate  Bush has emerged as an original. Her
extraordinary first  single &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; which she wrote 
after watching the film on television, enabled Kate to move  into the Number One
spot for such an astonishing length of  time that she practically bought the
freehold. She'd barely  vacated the premises when her second single &quot;The 
Man With the Child In His Eyes,&quot; a haunting look at  adolescent fantasy
which she wrote four years ago,  plus an album of her own songs, <EM>The Kick 
Inside</EM>, won her a gold record, proving that  Kate Bush. far from being a
one-hit wonder was  definitely - something.
</P>
<P>Still only 20, music has always been a part of her life.  She began writing
songs when she was 11 and grew  up in a loving, caring family always ready with
help,  advice and encouragement. Her father, a doctor, plays  well and one of
her brothers, Paddy, makes and plays  musical instruments and appears on Kate's
albums.  Her other brother, John, is a poet and writer and is  married with two
sons.
</P>
<P>Only the slightest excuse is needed by Kate and her  brothers for a family
get-together and Christmas in the  Bush household tends to be a Dickensian
affair.
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always loved Christmas,&quot;- she says.  &quot;It's a very
special time. It has it's own special  vibe. It's marvelous now, with my two
nephews,  seeing Christmas through a child's eyes. I remember  getting a toy
from my brother, Paddy, one year-- a  little cooker. He broke it. He didn't mean
to, but it's  so heartbreaking when you're a kid. &quot;We all get  together as
family for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day  and Boxing Day and because we're all so
close, we  have a terrific time. One thing I really love is the tree.  It's
wonderful to have a real tree in the house, the  smell and colour is so
beautiful. I really look forward  to Christmas at home.&quot;
</P>
<P>But for Kate, one thing's missing. Turkey is out. For  four years she's been
a vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>Kate's arrival on the pop scene came after a long  period of waiting in the
wings. EMI put her under  contract three years ago after hearing a demo tape 
prepared by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Very  impressed, they felt, however,
that Kate should  spend some time writing before she was launched. 
</P>
<P>Kate found it a strange period of limbo.
</P>
<P>&quot;Once I got the contract I presumed things  would happen. I didn't go
on holiday in case  they called me to do some recording. But  nothing happened.
Finally  I decided to study  dance because I felt at least that would be 
something progressive.&quot;
</P>
<P>It was a wise move. Her classes in dance  and mime with Arlene Phillips and
Lindsay  Kemp have added enormously to Kate's  impact as a visual performer,
although Kate  found the lessons no easy task. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's an awful lot of dance training in  mime and I found it very
difficult because I'd  never danced before. A lot of the other  people in the
classes were good and I was  useless. I looked an idiot for months and I  used
to get so depressed and frustrated  because I couldn't do it but challenge is
very  important to me and I was really tough  with myself to carry on and stop
looking a fool.  If you don't dare a little you won't progress.&quot;  </P>
<P>Her continuous movement on stage is one  literal way in which she manifests
her horror  of remaining static as a musician and a writer.  She had four years
to get together the songs  which gave her the initial impact.  </P>

</P>
<P>Success has given her many things. but  it's taken away her time to herself.
 </P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes I get really worried because  I'm not sure if I can ever
write another song.  but that's often because I've not had enough  time to get
the flow going. It's very inspiring  sometimes to write under pressure because 
you're in a very extreme emotional state and  enjoying new experiences.  </P>
<P>What I do find a problem, is actually being  left alone to put it on paper.
I can't remember  the last time I was alone for any length of  time, even a day.
It must be well over a year. I  miss being by myself very, very much but it's 
very difficult because you can't just ask  people to leave, they don't
understand.  </P>
<P>When I was studying dance and writing  songs I was alone a lot, but I was
being so  creative and I got so much done. I think it  was probably one of the
best times of my life:  I was really happy.&quot;
</P>
<P>Not that she's unhappy at the moment but  she realises that one album doth
not a legend  make, even if it was a gold one, and her new  album <EM>Lionheart</EM>
will be very important. She's  very happy with it, she feels it's a major 
progression.  </P>
<P>&quot;Writing songs is what I'm good at and I  really do feel it's what I'm
meant to do. What  I'm here for. I can't think of anything else that  would be
as fullfilling and I would be happy to  be just a songwriter, full stop. But
there are  always new beginnings. As soon as you climb  one wall, there's
another wall to climb. The first album was a showcase, a foot  in the door if
you like, and it's very important  for me to change and improve. I think I can
be  reasonably objective about my own work and  I was lucky to get the songs
together for 
<EM>Lionheart</EM>. There are no special themes  because I always treat each
song as a separate  entity and work on them one at a time but I  think many
other songs are much more  up-tempo. I love rock songs but normally  they're
just three chords and I don't believe in  that sort of writing. I like a really
strong  melody line and that was a technique to learn  but l seem to have
cracked it. It's pleased me,  anyway.&quot;  </P>
<P>She's confident enough to know when  she's done a good job and appears to
have all  the necessary ingredients for survival and  sanity in the music
business. She also has all  the strong characteristics of her Leo  birthsign. It
was she, for instance, as a young  unknown, who over-ruled EMl's first choice
and  insisted that they release &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as  her debut
single.  </P>
<P>&quot;For me &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was the only single  and I felt
very strongly about it. Eventually they  agreed, but it would have been terrible
if it had  failed after all the effort I had put into it.&quot;  </P>
<P>But it was obvious after the first few days that  it was a winner and E.M.l.
were quick to realize  that not only did they have a unique song but also  a
very attractive singer. The fact that she can also  deliver the goods musically
has enabled her to  accept with some tolerance the interest her looks  generate.
 </P>
<P>&quot;It's a bit of a conflict. I want to come across in  an attractive way,
naturally, to attract attention, but  I also want to say something in the
photograph.  It's just very hard to draw the line between being attractive  and
being sexy. Naturally, looks can help, but if  you can't provide something
interesting to listen  to, that won't hold anyone's interest tor long.''
</P>
<P>It would help sometimes she believes, if she  were a man: their looks are
less inclined to get in  the way of their music. She's firstly a musician  who
taught herself to play the piano. She rebelled  against early attempts to teach
her the violin.  </P>
<P>&quot;I love the violin and I'd really like to try it again  but I just
didn't like being taught because I do feel  very strongly that music should be
free-form  expression. I think frustration is the most important  part of
learning. You're forced to carry on until  you can do it, at least I am. And
when you get it  out it feels SO good. Teaching yourself the piano  has it's
advantages, for instance, I can read  chords, but I can't read notes. It's easy
to give in  but I was very determined to get it absolutely  right.&quot;  </P>

</P>
<P>Kate lives in a large house divided into three  flats, one for her and one
for each of her  brothers. She shares her flat with her cats, who,  she insists,
can tell a good friend from a &quot;phoney&quot; with no problems at all. They
are either  affectionate or extremely impolite and Kate tends  to watch for
their reactions when visitors arrive.  </P>
<P>Without being suspicious. she tends to be wary of &quot;heavy&quot;
relationships. Her boyfriend, Del, plays  guitar in her band. Her family are
very involved in  her career and her future. She fights against the  show
business circus of image-makers and  hangers-on. The people she needs. like her 
manager, Hilary Walker, are also good friends  of Kate and her family.  </P>
<P>  It's rare for Kate to do a photo session.  She insists she's not a model
or a clothes-horse  but she enjoyed being photographed for <EM>Tune-in</EM> 
because she fell in love with the clothes. In  fact, one of the jackets she
couldn't bear to be  parted from, and took it home.  </P>
<P>&quot;They're real fabrics. I love the feel of silks,  satins, pure cotton.
They just feel so good.&quot; Kate's  own full length black velvet coat was
bought in an  antique clothes shop and it's unlikely you'll ever  spot her in
crimplene and pearls: The clothes  she wears tend to be as unusual and original
as her songs.  </P>
<P>The photos taken. Kate went happily out into the  night and said she'd had a
smashing time. It wasn't  the cool, slightly bored farewell of a  show business
hot property. Kate Bush is defitely  SOMETHING.  </P>
<P>Beautiful clothes from the past</P>
<P>Naturally, all the clothes photographed are  unique, but similar outfits can
be found at Pot  Pourri. 5 High St, Thames Ditton, Surrey, which  is owned by
Shirley Dunlop. At Pot Pourri,  Shirley has an enormous collection of silk, 
satin, crepe and cotton nighties from Victorian  to the 1940's from &pound;3 - &pound;12.
She also sells the  very popular collarless shins at &pound;3.50 and  narrow ties
at &pound;1 each. She's interested in  buying any clothes you may wish to sell
from  Regency to 1940's. But if you're buying, you'll  be amazed how cheaply you
can acquire her  beautiful and original clothes.</P>
