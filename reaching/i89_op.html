<P>Well, we all know how Kate loved working with TR, but what did they think of
 working with KaTe?

<P>&quot;The Trio Bulgarka recently helped Kate Bush on three tracks of her
upcoming  album. &quot;We were glad to have the opportunity to meet and work
together with Kate  Bush,&quot; the trio explains with the help of an
interpreter. &quot;Joe Boyd (background  deleted) was the one who initiated it.
Kate Bush is a wonderful person and singer,  and highly proffesional. She is a
good musician, has a very good attitude towards  others. She's modest, you know,
with a very big heart. Her singing has warmth to it.  We had to record the
vocals in about two days. It was hard work, and we improvised  Bulgarian
harmonies onto her music. It is not an easy job grafting those harmonies  onto
other types of music. But everything went very well, and she was happy to  work
with us.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was interesting to work in the sphere of pop music,&quot; explains
Yanka. &quot;It's  another genre, and every professional singer has to take
risks and try new things,  has to work to enrich himself, not only in the field
of music but in many other  things.&quot;
