08:16:33 -0800 <BR> Subject: Radio 1 Classic Albums interview HoL (26/1/92) 
</P>
<P>This was one of the best interviews I've heard (even if the interviewer did
refer  to &quot;*The* Hounds of Love&quot; 8^). KaTe was relaxed, witty, giggly
and generally  altogether wonderful. 
</P>
<P>Much of what she said, she had said before (the story behind &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;,
&quot;A  Deal with God&quot; being retitled, etc) but she did say some things I
hadn't heard  before: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Morning Fog&quot; *does* represent the rescue of the character -
although she  admitted this wasn't explicit. I suppose &quot;The light.../Begin
to bleed/Begin to  breathe...&quot; does sound like someone's senses returning
after being rescued from a  state of sensory deprivation... 
</P>
<P>The steam train effect at the end of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; wasn't
actually a steam train  (it was Del and a Fairlight whistle sample) and was
included mainly to mask the  various instruments petering out inconclusively at
the end, and also to symbolize  some sort of &quot;arrival&quot;. 
</P>
<P>No transcription yet, but if nobody else is feeling dweebish enough (only
joking  guys! 8^), I might get round to it eventually.

<P>Date: Mon, 27 Jan 1992 02:40:37 -0800 <BR> From: Clive Backham &lt;mcdd1!clive@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt;
<BR> Subject: Re: Radio 1 Classic Albums interview (26/1/92) 
</P>
<P>In addition to Scott's information about Kate's Radio 1 interview, she also 
explicitly said that &quot;Mother&quot; is about a woman protecting her SON. I
seem to recall  some debate about whether this song was written from a man's
point of view (eg.  can a &quot;murderer&quot; be a woman?, etc). Mind you, it
always seemed more obvious than  that to me, considering the line &quot;Mother
will hide the madman&quot;. 
</P>
<P>BTW, I have a recording of the interview (with the album tracks themselves 
edited out); there's about 20 minutes of talk, 95% of which is Kate. If anyone
would  like me to make a copy and post it to them, I will be happy to do so,
just email me.

-0800 <BR> Subject: Radio 1 Classic Albums interview HoL (26/1/92) 
</P>
<P> I've typed in the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; interview from last month
(taped the middle  of last year). Thanks to Clive Backman for supplying me with
it. 
</P>
<P>It is, to me, THE BEST Hounds of Love interview EVER! She somehow manages 
to say new things about every track and it's blown away everyone I've read stuff
 from it to. It's 20 minutes long (20 minutes = 20k) and I'll post it when
everything  gets back to normal. 
</P>
<P>In the meantime, maybe we can have some disccusion as to what is in the 
interview (be interesting to have a discussion where the answer is known).
Perhaps  people's answers would be more interesting then Kate's. 
</P>
<P>Here are some questions: 
</P>
<P>1) What exactly is the &quot;little light&quot; in the song? 
</P>
<P>2) Who was the deal with God originally going to be made with? 
</P>
<P>3) Aside from dying, whats the most terrifying thing about the whole Ninth
Wave  experience? 
</P>
<P>4) What else could the Cloudbuster do aside from make it rain? 
</P>
<P>5) Where did the steam sound at the end of Cloudbusting come from, and why
is  it there? 
</P>
<P>And my (unanswered) question is, what would they have offered God, in &quot;the
 deal&quot;?

<P>CLASSIC ALBUMS INTERVIEW 
</P>
<P>From BBC Radio 1 
</P>
<P>January 25, 1992 
</P>
<P>This interview was actually recorded around the middle of 1991, making it
one of  only two known interviews she did that year. 
</P>
<P>Kate sounds very enthusiastic during the interview, and manages to convey
some  very interesting new information about the album she's talked the most
about. In  fact, this is probably the BEST interview on the album, it's one of
only three (along  with the KBC and HOMEGROUND interviews) where she goes track
by track over  each song. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill, thanks to Clive Backham for supplying me with the 
tape.] 
</P>
<P>A: ... for the start of a new series of Classic Albums, introduced by
Richard Skinner. 
</P>
<P>A: It's a music business cliche that the second album is the difficult one.
The truth  is that they all are, especially when the singer writes the songs and
produces the  record as well. The album we're about to hear was the artist's
fifth, and it  certainly wasn't easy. The year is 1985, and our classic album is
the Hounds of  Love [sic]. 
</P>
<P>A:...for the next hour, is Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>K: I think it was probably the most difficult stage I've been at so far.
Because The  Dreaming, the album before... I'd never produced an album before
that one.  And because it had a lot of unfavorable attention from some people, I
think it was  felt that me producing Hounds of Love wasn't such a good idea. And
for the first  time I felt I was actually meeting resistance artistically. I
felt the album had done  very well to reach number three, but I felt under a lot
of pressure and I wanted  to stay as close to my work as possible. And everyone
was saying &quot;Oh, she really's  gone mad now.&quot; You know, &quot;hey,
listen to this, it's a really weird record.&quot; But it  was very important
that it happened to me because it made me think, &quot;Right. Do  I really want
to produce my own stuff?&quot; You know, &quot;Do I really care about being 
famous?&quot; And I was very pleased with myself that, no, it didn't matter as
much  as making a good album. 
</P>
<P>	 So we started Hounds of Love in our own studio, and I started to find out
an  awful lot of things that I wouldn't have realized otherwise. I relaxed 
tremendously within my own environment, for a start. And also, on The  Dreaming,
because I was working in such an experimental way, the studio costs  were
becoming absolutely phenomenal, and I really don't think I could have  afforded
to have made Hounds of Love in a commercial setup. So, here I was in a 
situation of having as much creative control, really, as I could ever ask for. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is played in the background] 
</P>
<P>K: I had an idea of what I wanted to say in the song and I actually asked
Del to write  me a drum pattern, and he wrote this great pattern in the drum
machine. So I  just put the Fairlight on top of it and that was the basis of the
song, with the  drone [drum ???], which played quite an important part. 
</P>
<P>[The song continues] 
</P>
<P>K: I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman, can't understand
each other  because we are a man and a woman. And if we could actually swap each
others  roles, if we could actually be in each others place for a while, I think
we'd both  be very surprised! [Laughs] And I think it would be lead to a greater
 understanding. And really the only way I could think it could be done was 
either... you know, I thought a deal with the devil, you know. And I thought,  &quot;well,
no, why not a deal with God!&quot; You know, because in a way it's so much  more
powerful the whole idea of asking God to make a deal with you. You see,  for me
it is still called &quot;Deal With God&quot;, that was it's title. But we were
told that  if we kept this title that it wouldn't be played in any of the
religious countries,  Italy wouldn't play it, France wouldn't play it, and
Australia wouldn't play it!  Ireland wouldn't play it, and that generally we
might get it blacked purely  because it had &quot;God&quot; in the title. Now, I
couldn't believe this, this seemed  completely ridiculous to me and the title
was such a part of the song's entity. I  just couldn't understand it. But none
the less, although I was very unhappy about  it, I felt unless I compromised
that I was going to be cutting my own throat, you  know, I'd just spent two,
three years making an album and we weren't gonna  get this record played on the
radio, if I was stubborn. So I felt I had to be grown  up about this, so we
changed it to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. But it's always  something I've
regretted doing, I must say. And normally I always regret any  compromises that
I make. 
</P>
<P>	 &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. Well, again this was written at home, this was
an early song.  And it was inspired in some ways by this old black and white
movie that is a real  favorite of ours, called Night of the Demon. It's all
about this demon that appears  in the trees. And the line at the top of the song
&quot;It's in the trees, it's coming&quot; is  actually taken from the film.
Morris Demon [??? spelling] is the guy that sang it. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>	 When I was writing the song I sorta started coming across this line about 
hounds and I thought &quot;hounds of love&quot; and the whole idea of being
chasing by  this love that actually gonna... when it get you it just going to
rip you to pieces,  [raises voice] you know, and have your guts all over the
floor! So this very sort  of... being hunted by love, I liked the imagery, I
thought it was really good. 
</P>
<P>	 &quot;Big Sky&quot; was very difficult to write. I knew what I wanted to
finish up with,  but I didn't seem to be able to get there! We had three
different versions and  eventually it just kind of turned into what it did,
thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>	 That was really about... you know the thing of when - I used to do it a
lot when  I was a kid, we'd go out somewhere and sit up and look at the sky. And
if you  watch the clouds long enough, they take on different shapes, you can see
 dinosaurs in them, or castles. And at the time I was writing this album, we
were  living in the country and my keyboards and stuff were in this room
overlooking a  valley and I'd sit and watch the clouds rolling up the hill
towards me. And there  is a lot of weather on this album. The countryside was a
big inspiration at this  time, and it's always changing, it's a very different
perspective from living in the  city, sometimes you hardly see the sky above the
buildings at all. 
</P>
<P>A: &quot;The Big Sky.&quot; Kate had first used a Fairlight on her third
album Never For Ever  and by the time she made Hounds of Love it had become a
key element in the  creative process. 
</P>
<P>K: I'd say with this album, that most of the songs were written on Fairlight
and  synths and not piano, which was moving away really from the earlier albums,
 where all my material was written on piano. And there is something about the 
character of a sound - you hear a sound and it has a whole quality of it's own, 
that it can be sad or happy or... And that immediately conjures up images, which
 can of course help you to think of ideas that lead you on to a song. So
everything  is crucial for trying to find some direction with inspiration, and
really sounds,  now, I think are pieces of gold for people, you know. A good
sound is worth a lot,  artistically. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>	 Quite often I find synthetic sounds create a coldness, that if the track
is lonely or  sad or dark, sometimes you want that kind of coldness, that
machine-like  coldness, which is very specific. And with acoustic instruments
you get a real -  normally - a very warm, human presence and something that's
intimate and  really there, something that breathes, you know, it's not this
kind of dead, cold,  machine. And I feel that both are very usable, depending on
what you want to  say. 
</P>
<P>A: How about, &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; for instance? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, the personality that sings this track is very unfeeling in a way.
And the cold  qualities of synths and machines were appropriate here. There are
many different  kinds of love and the track's really talking about the love of a
mother, and in this  case she's the mother of a murderer, in that she's
basically prepared to protect  her son against anything. 'Cause in a way it's
also suggesting that the son is using  the mother, as much as the mother is
protecting him. It's a bit of a strange  matter, isn't it really? [laughs] 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>A: &quot;Mother Stand For Comfort&quot; Our classic album is the Hounds of
Love [sic] by  Kate Bush, and the next track is &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. 
</P>
<P>K: This was very special to me because it was all inspired by a book that I
found  years ago. And I went into a bookshop I used to go into regularly and
just saw  this... I liked the title, it said A Book of Dreams, and took the book
off the shelf,  I never done it before, an unknown book. And it was this
beautiful story by this  guy called Peter Reich. And it's all about his view of
his father, but through the  eyes of a child, so it was all about his childhood
and how he saw his father as this  incredibly magical figure. And his father was
Wilhelm Reich and he was a very  respected Psychoanalyst, I believe, but his
work became very controversial and he  eventually arrested and died in prison.
But one of the things that features in the  book is how he used to go with his
father cloudbusting. And his father had this  machine that when you pointed it
up to the sky you could make the clouds  disperse or you could gather them
together, and if you gathered them together it  would rain. And the machine is
all based on Orgone energy, which is one of the  bases of Reich's teachings. And
the book is just extraordinary. It's so sad, but  it's also got this beautiful
kind of happy innocence that goes with childhood. And  as the guy grows up in
the book, in does get sadder and sadder as you can feel  him hanging onto his
childhood. And the book really touched me, and the song is  really trying to
tell that story. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>K: That did all fall apart over a period of about ten bars. And everything
just started  falling apart, 'cause it didn't end properly, and, you know, the
drummer would  stop and then the strings would just sorta start wiggling around
and talking. And  I felt it needed an ending, and I didn't really know what to
do. And then I  thought maybe decoy tactics were the way, and we covered the
whole thing over  with the sound of a steam engine slowing down so that you had
the sense of the  journey coming to an end. And it worked, it covered up all the
falling apart and  actually made it sound very complete in a way. And we had
terrible trouble  getting a sound effect of steam train so we actually made up
the sound effect out  of various sounds, and Del was the steam. [Laughs] And we
got a whistle on the  Fairlight for the &quot;poo poop.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A: The continuous flow of music on a compact disk masks the fact that Hounds
of  Love and The Ninth Wave were conceived as two quite separate sides to the 
album. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes they were. I started off writing, I think, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;,
&quot;Hounds of  Love&quot;, and then I think probably &quot;Dream of Sheep.&quot;
And once I wrote that, that  was it, that was the beginning of what then became
the concept. And really, for  me, from the beginning, The Ninth Wave was a film,
that's how I thought of it.  It's the idea of this person being in the water,
how they've got there, we don't  know. But the idea is that they've been on a
ship and they've been washed over  the side so they're alone in this water. And
I find that horrific imagery, the  thought of being completely alone in all this
water. And they've got a life jacket  with a little light so that if anyone
should be traveling at night they'll see the light  and know they're there. And
they're absolutely terrified, and they're  completely alone at the mercy of
their imagination, which again I personally find  such a terrifying thing, the
power of ones own imagination being let loose on  something like that. And the
idea that they've got it in their head that they  mustn't fall asleep, because
if you fall asleep when you're in the water, I've  heard that you roll over and
so you drown, so they're trying to keep themselves  awake. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>K: Well at this point, although they didn't want to go to sleep, of course
they do.  [Laughs] And this is the dream, and it's really meant to be quite
nightmarish.  And this was all kinda coming together by itself, I didn't have
much to do with  this, I just sat down and wrote this little tune on the
Fairlight with the cello sound.  And it sounded very operatic and I thought &quot;well,
great&quot; because it, you know, it  conjured up the image of ice and was
really simple to record. I mean we did the  whole thing in a day, I guess. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>K: Again it's very lonely, it's terribly lonely, they're all alone on like
this frozen  lake. And at the end of it, it's the idea of seeing themselves
under the ice in the  river, so I mean we're talking real nightmare stuff here.
And at this point, when  they say, you know, &quot;my god, it's me,&quot; you
know, &quot;it's me under the ice. Ahhhh&quot;  [laughs] These sort of visitors
come to wake them up, to bring them out of this  dream so that they don't drown.

</P>
<P>	 My mother's in there, my father, my brothers Paddy and John, Brian Tench -
 the guy that mixed the album with us - is in the there, Del is in there, Robbie
 Coltrane does one of the voices. It was just trying to get lots of different 
characters and all the ways that people wake you up, like you know, you sorta
fall  asleep at your desk at school and the teacher says [song cut's in at &quot;Wake
up  child, pay attention!&quot; line] 
</P>
<P>[Song plays through to helicopter sound] 
</P>
<P>K: Couldn't get a helicopter anywhere and in the end I asked permission to
use the  helicopter from The Wall from The Floyd, it was the best helicopter I'd
heard  for years for years [laughs]. 
</P>
<P>	 I think it's very interesting the whole concept of witch-hunting and the
fear of  women's power. In a way it's very sexist behavior, and I feel that
female  intuition and instincts are very strong, and are still put down, really.
And in this  song, this women is being persecuted by the witch-hunter and the
whole jury,  although she's committed no crime, and they're trying to push her
under the  water to see if she'll sink or float. Uooo, ah. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>A: And the next track on &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is &quot;Watching You
Without Me&quot;. 
</P>
<P>K: Now, this poor sod [laughs], has been in the water for hours and been 
witch-hunted and everything. Suddenly, they're kind of at home, in spirit,
seeing  their loved one sitting there waiting for them to come home. And, you
know,  watching the clock, and obviously very worried about where they are,
maybe  making phone calls and things. But there's no way that you can actually 
communicate, because they can't see you, they can't you. And I find this really 
horrific, [laughs] these are all like my own personal worst nightmares, I guess,
 put into song. 
</P>
<P>	 And when we started putting the track together, I had the idea for these 
backing vocals, you know, [sings] &quot;you can't hear me&quot;. And I thought
that maybe  to disguise them so that, you know, you couldn't actually hear what
the backing  vocals were saying. 
</P>
<P>[The song continues] 
</P>
<P>A: &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;. Next is &quot;The Jig of Life&quot;.

</P>
<P>K: At this point in the story, it's the future self of this person coming to
visit them  to give them a bit of help here. I mean, it's about time they have a
bit of help. So  it's their future self saying, &quot;look,&quot; you know, &quot;don't
give up, you've got to stay  alive, 'cause if you don't stay alive, that means I
don't.&quot; You know, &quot;and I'm  alive, I've had kids [laughs]. I've been
through years and years of life, so you  have to survive, you mustn't give up.&quot;

</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>K: This was written in Ireland. At one point I did quite a lot of writing,
you know, I  mean lyrically, particularly. And again it was a tremendous sort of
elemental dose  I was getting, you know, all this beautiful countryside.
Spending a lot of time  outside and walking, so it had this tremendous sort of
stimulus from the outside.  And this was one of the tracks that the Irish
musicians that we worked with was  featured on. 
</P>
<P>	 There was a tune that my brother Paddy found which... he said &quot;you've
got to  hear this, you'll love it.&quot; And he was right [laughs], he played it
to me and I just  thought, you know, &quot;this would be fantastic somehow to
incorporate here.&quot; 
</P>
<P>	 Was just sort of, pull this person up out of despair. 
</P>
<P>	 &quot;Hello Earth&quot; was a very difficult track to write, as well,
because it was... in  some ways it was too big for me. [Laughs] And I ended up
with this song that  had two huge great holes in the choruses, where the drums
stopped, and  everything stopped, and people would say to me, &quot;what's going
to happen in  these choruses,&quot; and I hadn't got a clue. 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>	 We had the whole song, it was all there, but these huge, great holes in
the  choruses. And I knew I wanted to put something in there, and I'd had this
idea  to put a vocal piece in there, that was like this traditional tune I'd
heard used in  the film Nosferatu. And really everything I came up with, it with
was rubbish  really compared to what this piece was saying. So we did some
research to find  out if it was possible to use it. And it was, so that's what
we did, we re-recorded  the piece and I kind of made up words that sounded like
what I could hear was  happening on the original. And suddenly there was these
beautiful voices in these  chorus that had just been like two black holes. 
</P>
<P>[The song is continued] 
</P>
<P>	 In some ways I thought of it as a lullaby for the Earth. And it was the
idea of  turning the whole thing upside down and looking at it from completely
above. You  know, that image of if you were lying in water at night and you were
looking up  at the sky all the time, I wonder if you wouldn't get the sense of
as the stars  were reflected in the water, you know, a sense of like, you could
be looking up at  water that's reflecting the stars from the sky that you're in.
And the idea of  them looking down at the earth and seeing these storms forming
over America  and moving around the globe, and they have this like huge
fantasticly overseeing  view of everything, everything is in total perspective.
And way, way down there  somewhere there's this little dot in the ocean that is
them. 
</P>
<P>A: The Ninth Wave song sequence concludes with &quot;The Morning Fog&quot; 
</P>
<P>K: Well, that's really meant to be the rescue of the whole situation, where
now  suddenly out of all this darkness and weight comes light. You know, the 
weightiness is gone and here's the morning, and it's meant to feel very positive
 and bright and uplifting from the rest of dense, darkness of the previous
track.  And although it doesn't say so, in my mind this was the song where they
were  rescued, where they get pulled out of the water. And it's very much a song
of  seeing perspective, of really, you know, of being so grateful for everything
that  you have, that you're never grateful of in ordinary life because you just
abuse it  totally. And it was also meant to be one of those kind of &quot;thank
you and  goodnight&quot; songs. You know, the little finale where everyone does
a little dance  and then the bow and then they leave the stage. [laughs] 
</P>
<P>[The song is played] 
</P>
<P>K: I never was so pleased to finish anything if my life. There were times I
never  thought it would be finished. It was just such a lot of work, all of it
was so much  work, you know, the lyrics, trying to piece the thing together. But
I did love it, I  did enjoy it and everyone that worked on the album was
wonderful. And it was  really, in some ways, I think, the happiest I've been
when I'd been writing and  making an album. And I know there's a big theory that
goes 'round that you  must suffer for your art, you know, &quot;it's not real
art unless you suffer.&quot; And I  don't believe this, because I think in some
ways this is the most complete work  that I've done, in some ways it is the best
and I was the happiest that I'd been  compared to making other albums.
