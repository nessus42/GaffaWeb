(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: Rockline (French TV) Sept. 1985 
</P>
<P>78. Rockline: Kate is interviewed and video clips are shown on the French TV
 programme, September 1985. 
</P>
<P>A typically constrained interview for this period, with more or less stock 
questions and replies. This interview was conducted in English, but was
broadcast  with the questions dubbed in afterward in French and Kate's replies
left intact but  given French subtitles. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Above note by IED. Since the questions are only
heard  in French, I have not been able to transcribe them. If anybody out there
speaks  French and would like to fill them in for me I would be appreciative.] 
</P>
<P>[The &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; video is played.] 
</P>
<P>I: Kate Bush... [???] ...Akido, kendo. 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, that's interesting. Maybe you're thinking of Kendo because of the
clothes  that we're wearing. We're wearing Hakama, which are the Japanese
trousers. It  was really fun working on that video, I've been working with Diane
Grey, a  dance teacher who I found at the top of '83. And while I'd been making
the  album, I hadn't really had any time to carry on the dance at all, for me
it's one  thing at a time. And when we had to make that video, I basically went
into full  training again from a year of having done nothing. And we worked
together, with  Diane choreographing, and it was fantastic, it was just such a
such good  experience. And I think what we were trying to do was, we felt that
all the  videos that are around that there's a lot of dance appearing in them,
but it's not  really serious dance. And no-one has yet tried to film just a nice
serious piece of  dance, properly, and that's what we were trying to achieve...

</P>
<P>I: Kate, [???] 
</P>
<P>K: Well after the last album, I really wanted to take a break. Working on an
album  is a very intense process for me, really, locked away in the studio for
maybe up to  a year working on it. And when you get to the end of a project like
that you  really want to go and get some new stimulus, create a new energy for a
new  album. So I took some time out, finding a new dance teacher, and a lot of
time I  spent building and equipping our own recording studio, which we then
recorded  all the material in. 
</P>
<P>I: [???] 
</P>
<P>K: I don't think that's the priority in my head, what really concerns me is
that what  I do has as much effort put into it that we can, that we can do the
best we can  within our limitations. It just tends to take me longer then most
people to do  something that I'm pleased with. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate Bush, [???] 
</P>
<P>K: I don't enjoy working so [??? long] It's actually very frustrating for me
that  things take so long. But again, it's the level of the work, that in a way
it's  something that's bigger than me. And that when I start it's... I'm never
sure if  I'll actually be able to finish it because I'm not sure if what I want
to accomplish  is possible. And so I think again thats why it does take a long
time. 
</P>
<P>I: [???] Hounds Of Love? 
</P>
<P>K: It's almost like two separate albums for me, this really, in that the
first side is  five separate songs, if they're linked it's only be the theme of
love - they're all  forms of love songs, they're about relationships. They're
all very different subject  matters from each other. And the second side of the
album is a conceptual piece  which is seven songs all linked together. And it's
very much something that was  designed and written to work as one piece of
music. 
</P>
<P>I: [???] 
</P>
<P>K: I think that's how human beings are, though, I don't think anyone has a
real  sense of reality. Everything we see is how we experience it in our heads
and I  think along with that goes an awful lot of dreams and illusions and so I
think it's  quite a real thing. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate, [???] 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I'd really love to do another show and since that last one it's
really been the  matter of finding the time and the moment to do it. It wasn't
until I'd got to the  end of the last album that I had enough new material to do
a completely new  show. And so now here I am at the end of this album and maybe
when I get the  projects out of the way that are definitely what I want I do
first, I would then  very much like to do a show. It was a fantastic experience,
I learnt such a lot  about myself as well as the whole process. And I would
dearly love to do it again,  it's really just finding the moment. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate [???] 
</P>
<P>K: Kate, I don't think there's anything I could ask for, I think he's given
me far too  much as it is. 
</P>
<P>I: Bye, bye, Kate.
