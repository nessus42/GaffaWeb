<P>If only Emily Bronte were alive today to hear  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
put to verse in a three  minute, plus hit single by Kate Bush.  </P>
<P>A contralto, the 19-year-old London lass is  nothing less than striking in
her beauty, but  her voice is best described as remarkable.</P>
<P>Although it took three years to record her  first album, including the
hit-single &quot;Wuthering  Heights,&quot; it took only 12 weeks to turn both 
into highly acclaimed hit records in Britain.  </P>
<P>Now she is looking toward North America,  &quot;a goal of every artist,&quot;
she said.</P>
<P>On a recent promotional junket to meet North  American press and radio
people Kate Bush  visited Toronto to talk about herself, her album, 
<EM>The Kick Inside</EM>, and about coping  with her sudden success.  </P>
<P>&quot;I felt that to actually get your name anywhere,  you've got to do
something unusual, not more  of the same. I chose 'Wuthering Heights' as a 
vehicle and because the book moved me.&quot;</P>
<P>Her first mentor was Pink Floyd's guitarist Dave  Gilmour, who steered her
toward Harvest Records, one of the most noteworthy of all U.K. pop labels today.</P>
<P>That union made, the songstress battled with  inhibitions, vocal control and
psychological duress  until the takes started to come naturally, with  &quot;feeling&quot;
in the vocal expression.</P>
<P>Musically, she said her leanings are toward Steely  Dan, David Bowie and
Bryan Ferry during his  days with Roxy Music and Eno.  </P>
<P>The album's only attempt at an all-out rock number  (and its only flaw) is &quot;James
and the Cold Gun,&quot; in which she tries a Patti Smith vocal posture and 
suffers at the hand of a weak song.  </P>
<P>With a record contract at age 15, she studied mime  with Lindsay Kemp and
learned basics in karate,  dance and vocal control. Now that she has won 
Britain and is a known name on this continent. Bush  said her plans won't change
much. &quot;I still want to  progress in my dancing...just develop the arts.&quot;
 </P>
<P>With no immediate plans for touring, she must write  another album's worth
of songs. &quot;Have you read  'Jane Eyre'?&quot; one is forced to ask. &quot;No,&quot;
she laughed,  &quot;no more Emily Bronte.&quot; </P>
