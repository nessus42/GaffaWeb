Shane Wright is a Kate Bush tragic. This week, Bush released her first new music 
in 12 years. Wright explains what it is about the English songstress that had 
her fans holding their breath.<br>
<br>
There are now wiley, windy moors across southern NSW. It's even tougher finding 
a Heathcliff and a Cathy - and there's definitely no Wuthering Heights. But it 
was there, in my early teens, that I fell in love with the music of Kate Bush.<br>
<br>
Two decades on, and the voice of Kate Bush is about to return to the world's 
airwaves. The close-knit Kate Bush community has been abuzz all year that their 
heroine would break 12 years of silence and release a new album. The wait is 
almost over.<br>
<br>
Her first single since the Red Shoes album of 1993, King of the Mountain, was 
played on British radio this week. The response to the single in some of the 
world's music chatrooms gives you and idea of the devotion of Kate Bush fans. 
&quot;Well, I'm sitting here with a friend of mine who actually started crying after 
he heard King of the Mountain,&quot; one wrote. &quot;I don't know what to make of 
it...it's like a holiday. It's like...nothing I've ever experienced before.&quot; 
Another enthused: &quot;It keeps growing and getting even better. I wonder if or 
where this obsession will stop. It's hypnotic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Early signs of Bush obsession appeared. One person admitted to listening to the 
song 59 times in the 10 hours or so after it was first aired on BBC2.<br>
<br>
But will the music of Kate survive the 21st century? In the 12 years since Bush 
released her last album, music and the music industry has changed dramatically. 
Bruce Springsteen has managed to split from the E Street Band, reform it, and 
then go solo again. Britney Spears has had an entire career - and a baby - since 
she asked to be hit one more time. Madonna has gone from erotica to motherhood.<br>
<br>
There were no American, British or Australian idols clogging up the radio 
airwaves. It was a time before iPods, web pages and DVDs. And Michael Jackson 
was still known for his music rather than his court appearances.<br>
<br>
Australian music guru Glenn A. Baker remembers fondly an interview he conducted 
with the &quot;beguiling&quot; Bush back in her then south London flat in the early 1980s. 
Bush was discovered by Pink Floyd member Dave Gilmour in the early 1970s, before 
she was taken under the wing of record label EMI. Baker says EMI did what today 
is almost unthinkable - it gave Bush time to develop her talents. She delivered, 
releasing Wuthering Heights at a time when punk was marching across British 
carts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Record companies gave people three or four albums to develop. Nowadays, they 
give people two or three singles before they're dropped,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Baker ranks Bush as one of the more important female contemporary musicians of 
our time. &quot;She's one of the strong female performers out of the 1980s and 1990s, 
and she was one of those who proved that women are not just ornaments to the 
music,&quot; he said. &quot;And she was one of the few who was as good behind the mike as 
in front of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
So what is it about Kate Bush that draws such strong opinions from fans and 
critics alike? It could be the focus on rhythm, her use of synthesizers, the 
at-times obscure lyrics, or just about the entire musical package. This is a 
woman who has covered so many issues in her music - from incest to nuclear 
annihilation to the plight of the Aborigines - and adopted a range of images to 
portray it.<br>
<br>
On the cover of The Dreaming album, she portrays herself as the wife of Harry 
Houdini, delivering a key on her tongue to the great escapeologist. On the 
Hounds of Love, she became Shakespeare's Ophelia. And ten there's the links from 
literature, most memorably started with Wuthering Heights, but progressing to 
Molly Bloom, from James Joyces masterpiece, Ulysses.<br>
<br>
But back in Cootatarnundra, sitting as it does on the banks of the Muttarna 
Creek in southern NSW, all this imagery meant nothing to this (then) young 
teenager.<br>
<br>
It was the music that drew me in - and maybe the outfit she wore in the 
Babooshka video. As my university flatmate - and Bush fan - once told me, Kate 
just sings unlike any other person.<br>
<br>
Already it appears Bush will find success with her new album.<br>
<br>
King of the Mountain went straight to the top of Britian's hot 100 CD singles, 
just hours after it appeared on radio and four weeks before it goes on sale.<br>
<br>
In Australia, the last big chart performance by Bush was back in 1991 when her 
cover of Elton John's Rocket Man went to number two. But have the music lovers 
of the world moved on, ready to ditch a woman who has influenced and changed 
music so much during her years in the business? Me, along with thousands of 
other Kate Bush fans, don't care.<br>
<br>
The world could be listening on their MP3 to Kelly Clarkson, or downloading the 
latest mobile ring tone, but I'll be waiting for that voice that sounds like an 
angel floating in the fog of a British moor. Other music doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
As one chatroom member said this week: &quot;Oops...Kate did it again...eat your 
heart out Britney, Kate is going for the real stuff! Shivers all over, 
goosebumps all over...Worth the waiting!&quot;</P>

<p>Singer Kate Bush will release her first album in 12 years in November - a 
double album entitled Aerial. It will follow with a single, King of the 
Mountain, out in October. Both the single and the album were produced by Bush 
herself, the BBC reports. </p>
<p>The 47-yer-old performer's last album, The Red Shoes, was released in 1993 
and was the soundtrack to a short-lived Broadway show [huh? -ed]. Her last 
public appearance was in 2001, when she received Q magazine's &quot;classic 
songwriter&quot; award in London. </p>
<p>Bush was only 19 when she hit the charts in Australia and Britain in 1978 
with her debut single, Wuthering Heights. Her run of hits in the 1980s includes 
Babooshka, Running Up That Hill and Don't Give Up, a duet with Peter Gabriel.<br>

The Sunday Telegraph (Sidney)<br>

<p>There's a joke doing the rounds at the moment on Kate Bush newsgroups. </p>
<p>Q: How many Kate Bushes does it take to change a light bulb? </p>
<p>A: One, but it takes about 15 years and requires absolute silence. </p>
<p>If you're not a Kate Bush fan, this joke might not be very funny. </p>
<p>The point is that all around the world, people like me are sitting glued to 
the computers in the desperate hope that there will be some news, and news about 
her new album. </p>
<p>Despite it having been due for release in March, there's still no word on 
what must be the most awaited recording since Guns'n'Roses announced the phantom 
that was Chinese Democracy. </p>
<p>For months, I've been plagued by images of Kate in a crumbling Edwardian 
manor, her finger stuck in a faulty power socket, her body dead on the floor.
</p>
<p>Has anyone gone around to check? In desperation, I contacted her record 
company. </p>
<p>&quot;We'll let you know when we hear anything,&quot; they said. But what if I can't 
wait that long? </p>
<p>English writer John Mendelssohn wrote an entire novel called Waiting For Kate 
Bush about a cast of misfits in an apartment building driven insane by 
anticipation. It sounds terribly familiar. </p>
<p>Kate's last album, Red Shoes, was released in 1993. It was an uneven effort, 
but featured some stunning compensations (Moments Of Pleasure is one of her 
finest.) </p>
<p>In the interim, Bush's legend has undergone a revival of of sorts. First, The 
Futureheads had a hit with her Hounds Of Love, then bands in the states began 
naming her as an influence. </p>
<p>It seems a generation who were pre-pubescent when Bush was prancing about in 
the metal Babooshka bra are the new face of rock. </p>
<p>The reasons Kate Bush inspires such fanaticism are well noted. Her output is 
tiny and completely; she is utterly mysterious and rarely seen in public. </p>
<p>Without a human face, she becomes a blank screen on which people project 
their problems and fantasies. </p>
<p>For millions, Kate Bush has become the Wizard of Oz hiding behind the 
curtain. The reality is perhaps an inevitable disappointment. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, all we can do is wait.</p>

<P ALIGN="left">No one can sing the words 'washing machine' with such beautiful 
intensity as Kate Bush; but then again, who would want to? 'Slooshy-sloshy, 
slooshy-sloshy/get that dirty shirt clean' she goes on, all ethereal, mystical 
and Kate Bushy on <i>Mrs Bartolozzi</i>. It's twelve years since we heard Bush 
on CD and she still treads purposefully that fine line between genius and what 
might be construed as .......well, a bit silly. Dull she is not, though, and <i>
Aerial</i> is brimful of the Bushiness that characterised her best albums, <i>
The Kick Inside</i> (197<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) -->8)<!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> 
and <i>Hounds of Love</i> (1985).<br>
This much anticipated comeback is split into two CDs, <i>A Sea of Honey</i> and
<i>A Sky of Honey</i>. The former is a mixed bag, with the aforementioned <i>Mrs 
Bartolozzi</i> and <i>Bertie</i> (a reference, one of several, to her seven year 
old son) the flimsiest of the seven tracks. They are counterbalanced by the 
inspired, ambient, funky and sexy <i>King of the Mountain</i>, with Bush's voice 
at its most soulful and least flighty, and the most acutely poppy song, <i>How 
to Be Invisible</i>. These contrast greatly with <i>A Coral Room</i>, an eerily 
stark eulogy to her late mother. The second CD is more conceptual, a journey 
from early morning (<i>Prelude</i>, <i>Prologue</i>) through to night (<i>Nocturne)</i>, 
accompanied by a selection of birds and on two occasions by the dulcet warble 
and didgeridoo of Rolf Harris (no, really). <i>Nocturne</i> is the most 
compelling track, a soaring, confident, hopeful 8 1/2 minutes (<i>'we tire of 
the city/we tire of it all/we long for just that somthing more'</i>) that segues 
seamlessly into the more celebratory title-track finale. Bush can be heard 
laughing towards the end, supposedly with the birds. Given her long absence, she 
might also allow herself a chuckle at being able to transcend time and trends 
with such remarkable ease.<br>

<P ALIGN="left">(<a href="AerialReviewAge11-11-05.jpg">scan of original article</a>)</P>
<P ALIGN="left">There's a bit halfway through disc one of this outrageously 
long-awaited double album, in a song called Mrs Bartolozzi, that's destined to 
polarise the curious listener and the Kate Bush obsessive.<br>
<br>
The former is perhaps unaware that Aerial is her first release in 12 years. The 
latter has counted with anguish every empty Christmas since The Red Shoes, and 
knows precisely what has kept the Bexley doctor's daughter occupied during this 
unprecedented absence.<br>
<br>
To the delicate, staccato accompaniment of her piano, the bit goes like this: &quot;Slooshy 
sloshy slooshy sloshy/Get that dirty shirty clean/Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy/Make 
those cuffs and collars gleam&quot;.<br>
<br>
A new mother and oblivious pop legend, Kate Bush's chief occupations these past 
dozen years have been blissfully domestic. Judging by the ingenious micro/cosmic 
focus of this home-studio opus, her deliberate distance from pop fashion and 
expectation has enhanced her gift for finding magic under her own fingernails.<br>
<br>
Mrs Bartolozzi, for instance, is a sexually charged Cinderella fantasy loaded 
with ghosts and longing and one of Bush's favourite metaphors, a fearful body of 
water. Or maybe it's about an Italian washing lady enjoying a sneaky spliff.<br>
<br>
Aerial is barmy, sumptuous, personal, playful, profound and unmistakably Kate. 
It cares not a newt's whisker for cool - yes, that's THE Rolf Harris on An 
Architect's Dream and The Painter's Link - and it refers any question of musical 
progress to the old &quot;ain't broken&quot; rule.<br>
<br>
Del Palmer's trademark slithering fretless bass and the late Michael Kamen's 
lush orchestrations weave through the same pristine, three-dimensional cathedral 
of sound that Bush pioneered in the 1980s. That's what happens if you blithely 
ignore 12 years of alleged musical progress: you can pretend the post-grunge 
backwash, the nu-rock cacophony, the Prodigy, Robbie Williams, generations of 
recycled retro filler, a thousand sub-genres of dance music and the entire 
chill-out muzak tragedy never happened. Mmmm, nice.<br>
<br>
Not that Kate Bush has taken the tiniest leaf from anyone else's book since the 
British art-rock of Pink Floyd, David Bowie and Roxy Music inspired her as a 
mid-'70s teenager. In form and content she's always drawn purely on her 
eccentric English imagination.<br>
<br>
Her high-concept roots show in Aerial's twin-disc presentation, each with 
subtitle: A Sea of Honey and A Sky of Honey. Given that both could have squeezed 
onto one CD, we're clearly dealing with an Artistic Statement here, stubbornly 
rooted in the age when such things came with Side One and Side Two, with the 
enforced listener participation that used to entail.<br>
<br>
A Sea of Honey comprises seven unconnected songs, beginning with the downbeat 
single King of the Mountain. With its references to Elvis Presley, Citizen Kane 
and &quot;a multimillionaire (filling) up his home with priceless junk&quot;, it's an 
unusually transparent song about the sad game of wealth and celebrity.<br>
<br>
The alleged reclusive pop sorceress enjoys another joke about her reputation 
with How To Be Invisible. It grooves like a spooky incantation, but the spell 
lists household ingredients: &quot;Hem of anorak/ Stem of wallflower/ Hair of doormat 
. . . Jump into the mirror/ and you're invisible&quot;.<br>
<br>
A slightly dodgy song about Joan of Arc continues her flirtation with literary 
and/or historical figures, but it's mostly kitchen-table heroes that inspire 
these songs. Her six-year-old son Bertie is celebrated in a medieval pastoral 
feel, with the kind of open-hearted expression that will aggrieve cynics no end.<br>
<br>
<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font> is a highlight, both for its eccentricity 
and unlikely lyricism. To the whimsical throb of bass and synthesisers, Bush 
sings the titular mathematical conundrum digit by digit, to 120 decimal places. 
Infinitely daft or unfathomably deep? Make your own calculation.<br>
<br>
Where The Red Shoes erred on the side of over-production and unwelcome guests, 
much of Aerial finds Bush returning to her elegant acoustic piano and vocal 
arrangements. A Coral Room is a touching song about her late mother with a 
refrain based on Little Brown Jug. Again, perhaps only Kate people understand.<br>
<br>
That goes double for disc two, A Sky of Honey, which is your full-blown concept 
album awash with birdsong and shifting colours as it follows the natural cycle 
of light from late afternoon to night. Bertie and Rolf both crop up in the 
orchestrated soundscape, and mummy sings an astonishing harmony duet with a 
blackbird before bedtime. No, really. Think of it as a calmer, gracefully older 
sequel to Side Two of Hounds of Love.<br>
<br>
According to the logarithmic spread of previous releases, the ninth Kate Bush 
album is due sometime in the 2050s. On this evidence, it will probably sound 
like she's only popped off for a minute to do the laundry.</P>

November 10, 2005</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Back to dispel the esoteric recluse theory, Kate Bush has 
extended herself beyond her highest accolades.<br>
<br>
The inimitable character behind the wildly eccentric Wuthering Heights crafts a 
beautifully tempered sea of ambient drama (Joanni ). At age 47, she has drawn 
much of the inspiration for this album from her only child, son Bertie.<br>
<br>
It was also he who prolonged the gestation period which spawned this double 
album.<br>
<br>
The coupling of her operatic voice with gentle piano (even Rolf Harris' 
didgeridoo) delivers an uplifting air and her rich strike rate of infectious 
harmonics is cast with stark imagery and lilting orchestral finery.<br>
<br>
The simple frailty of Mrs Bartolozzi is masterful.<br>
<br>
So it is that precision and minimalism outline the arrangements (Prologue ). 
While last month's release of the first single, King of the Mountain, was a 
surprise tempter, it is just a fraction of her greater musical equation. Sure, 
she has challenged past listeners with a love it/leave it quandary but, here, 
Bush presents more magnetic beauty in her return from music's periphery than 
most artists muster in a life's work.</P>

								Twelve quiet years of 'normal life' haven't 
								dimmed Kate Bush's fiercely individual take on 
								pop music.</strong><p>It starts with a high 
								piano tinkling in the key of A - so far so 
								normal. Then it shifts and shifts again, four 
								quick key changes, sharp to flat, major to 
								minor, sweet to downright strange. A classical 
								pianist would have understood what the girl was 
								doing to get such unsettling sound but no one 
								wrote pop like that. And no one sang like that 
								wailing falsetto, with its hint of the madwoman 
								in the attic, its dash of Emily Dickinson and 
								touch of Emily Bronte herself, who died of 
								consumption in her early 20s and who was born on 
								July 30, the same day as a teenager growing up 
								in Kent in the 1970s called Catherine Bush - who 
								heard this fact, was spooked and thrilled by it, 
								and sat down one night under a full moon at 
								midnight and wrote a song called <em>Wuthering 
								Heights</em>.</p>
								<p>Released in 1978, when Bush was 19, <em>
								Wuthering Heights</em> raced to the top of the 
								British charts (knocking off Abba), the first 
								time a woman had done so with a song she wrote 
								herself. That year she put out two albums, 
								drawing on hundreds of songs she had written 
								since she was 12. She sang of incest and 
								suicide, of Peter Pan and the ghost of a 
								shot-down Spitfire pilot yearning to see London 
								Bridge in the rain. As her London gay fan club 
								later described her, she was &quot;eccentric, 
								elusive, and very, very English&quot;.</p>
								<p>If her roots could be defined they were in 
								folk, classical music, literature and the 
								romantic tradition, never in the trends of the 
								day. At the snarling, spitting height of punk, 
								she wore a leotard and pranced about on videos 
								trailing bits of pre-Raphaelite fabric behind 
								her. She was an easy target for parody, because 
								she was one of a kind.</p>
								<p>She made five albums in seven years, 
								culminating in her 1985 work <em>Hounds of Love</em>, 
								perhaps her masterpiece, which former Sex Pistol 
								John Lydon described as &quot;beyond an album, an 
								opera&quot;. Though she toured only once - she 
								disliked live performance and is said to have a 
								fear of flying - she attracted an army of 
								adoring, sometimes obsessive, fans.</p>
								<p>Then, in 1993, after two commercially 
								unsuccessful albums and widening pauses between 
								them, the music stopped. Bush vanished. She made 
								no records, gave just one interview in 12 years. 
								Despairing fans debated on websites whether it 
								was all over. The tabloids, possibly irked by a 
								celebrity who dared to deny them their daily 
								feed, painted her as Miss Havisham of <em>Great 
								Expectations</em>, a weirdo recluse shut up in 
								her mansion on an island in the upper Thames. 
								What was she up to? Rumours ran wild: Bush had 
								finally succumbed to the pleas of record company 
								executives, invited them to her house to witness 
								her latest creation, and produced a batch of 
								home-made cakes from the oven.</p>
								<p>At last, in August, came an EMI press 
								release: a new Kate Bush album was imminent. 
								After 12 years, the revelation caused a stir. 
								Newspapers dusted off headlines: Kate 
								Expectations and Dithering Heights. Journalists 
								were invited to EMI's London headquarters to get 
								a sneak preview, with a security man watching 
								over them. Bush even did an interview.</p>
								<p>This week she released <em>Aerial,</em> a 
								16-track double album. As with everything she 
								has done, it is diverse, unpredictable, wild. A 
								conventional rock track precedes a cascade of 
								flamenco guitar, which runs on from a strings 
								arrangement. Her word imagery is 
								characteristically vivid: &quot;the spider of time is 
								crawling over the ruins,&quot; she sings in <em>A 
								Coral Room</em>, about the death of her mother, 
								Hannah. She also sings to a pigeon and, as 
								immune to fashion as ever, has a dialogue with 
								Rolf Harris, who plays a street painter and 
								blows the didgeridoo.</p>
								<p>The album betrays Bush's preoccupations: 
								there's a song about Elvis and Citizen Kane, 
								another called <em>How to be Invisible</em>. Yet 
								there's a better clue to the mystery in the 
								narcotic ballad Mrs Bartolozzi.</p>
								<p>A woman is watching clothes in a washing 
								machine. Around and around they go, slosh slosh, 
								and as she stares at them, she starts to imagine 
								...</p>
								<p>&quot;My blouse wrapping itself around your 
								trousers ... oh the waves are coming in ... my 
								shirt floating up around my waist ...&quot;</p>
								<p>Then she looks outside: &quot;I think I see you 
								standing outside, but it's just your shirt 
								hanging on the washing line.&quot;</p>
								<p>The dream broken, drudgery returns: &quot;Slooshy, 
								sloshy, slooshy, sloshy ... washing machine, 
								washing machine, washing machine.&quot;</p>
								<p>Bush broke her silence in an interview in 
								Mojo this month. &quot;For the last 12 years, I've 
								felt really privileged to be living a normal 
								life,&quot; she said. &quot;It's so a part of who I am. 
								It's so important to me to do the washing, do 
								the Hoovering. Friends of mine in the business 
								don't know how dishwashers work. For me, that's 
								frightening. I want to be in a position where I 
								can function as a human being.&quot;</p>
								<p>She was devastated by the death of her mother 
								in the early 1990s. She slept a lot, couldn't 
								work, watched a lot of bad television. She ended 
								one long relationship - with the musician and 
								sound engineer Del Palmer - and started another, 
								with musician Danny McIntosh. In 1998, the 
								couple had a child and managed to keep it quiet 
								for 18 months, until Bush's friend, the musician 
								Peter Gabriel, blurted it out on radio. She 
								built a home studio so she could make her own 
								music. She took complete control of her life.</p>
								<p>Here's how Bush has explained her seclusion: 
								&quot;The more I got into presenting things to the 
								world, the further it was taking me away from 
								what I was, which was someone who just used to 
								sit quietly at a piano and sing and play ... I 
								am just trying to be a good, protective mother. 
								I want to give Bertie as normal a childhood as 
								possible while preserving his privacy.&quot; In an 
								age of obsession with even the minutiae of 
								celebrities' lives, being a recluse is the only 
								way Bush can lead a normal life.</p>
								<p>To Paul Rees, editor of British music 
								magazine <em>Q</em>, it helps to explain her 
								success. &quot;She is a genuine enigma,&quot; he says. 
								&quot;Contrast her with Madonna. You can't possibly 
								want to know any more about Madonna.&quot; He sees 
								Bush's restraint as the key to her longevity. 
								&quot;What you know of her you know through her 
								music.&quot;</p>
								<p>Rees, who hadn't heard Aerial when he spoke 
								to the <em>Herald</em>, sees it as a critical 
								album for Bush: will it help her break through 
								to a new, younger audience? BBC entertainment 
								writer Darren Waters thought Aerial was &quot;not for 
								the iPod generation&quot;. Yet several contemporary 
								bands cite her as an inspiration, from Antony 
								Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons to Placebo, 
								who sang a cover of <em>Running Up that Hill</em>, 
								to the Futureheads, whose 2001 version of <em>
								Hounds of Love</em> was a bigger hit than it was 
								for Bush.</p>
								<p>So far critics are divided about the album. 
								Incomparable, impenetrable, pretentious and 
								sublime: British reviewers have used all these 
								words in the past two weeks. One found its heavy 
								use of synthesisers dated, like a Sting album 
								from 1985. Although Pete Paphides in <em>The 
								Times</em> found much to admire on it, he also 
								wondered whether it marked the point where &quot;her 
								lifelong artistic deceleration finally grinds to 
								a halt&quot;. But to <em>The Observer</em> reviewer 
								Kitty Empire, <em>Aerial</em> was genius and 
								&quot;arguably the most female album in the world, 
								ever&quot;.</p>
								<p>That may be the point. &quot;Luvverly Bertie,&quot; 
								Bush trills to her son, backed by Renaissance 
								guitars. Its intensity is compelling, though as
								<em>The Guardian</em> reviewer Alexis Petridis 
								pointed out, it's a song that will have Bertie 
								slamming doors and yelling, &quot;Mum, you're so 
								embarrassing,&quot; when he gets to 15. For now, 
								though, Bertie leads a magical life of sun, 
								wind, paint, chirruping birds and English green. 
								His mother's life is also in the music, not 
								hidden. If <em>Aerial</em> tells the truth, at 
								47, Kate Bush has found her compass, her own way 
								home.</p>

								<p>You know how some days you just ache to cut 
								yourself off from the world, not to see the news 
								or hear about the next big thing?<br>
								<br>
								You can put the headphones on and do that with 
								Bush's first album in 12 years, which has 
								nothing contemporary or topical about it. In 
								terms of sounds, it could have been recorded in 
								1985.<br>
								<br>
								Bertie, a song of love for Bush's seven-year-old 
								son, goes back even further, since it is a 
								folk-based tune which might have been sung at 
								court centuries ago.<br>
								<br>
								Domestic matters are high in Bush's thoughts, 
								although her erotic charge is still in evidence 
								in Mrs Bartolozzi, a song which at first might 
								seem to be about washing day but which most 
								certainly is not. 'Slooshy sloshy', Bush 
								enthuses, 'get that dirty shirty clean.' 
								Jeepers.<br>
								<br>
								It's a vast piece of work across two CDs and 90 
								minutes, and no reviewer can pretend to get to 
								the bottom of it in just a few weeks. Some of it 
								is brilliant, some floats ethereally by on drum 
								machines and synthesisers which everyone else 
								sent to the tip years ago. The CD, A Sky of 
								Honey, floats easily through the course of a day 
								from morning until night, complete with birdsong 
								and didgeridoo from Rolf Harris.<br>
								<br>
								But Bush is still her own woman, still walks the 
								line between the ordinary and the wondrous and 
								daft, undiluted by attempts to follow trends or 
								please corporate bosses.<br>
								<br>

								Melbourne Herald Sun<br>
								by Cameron Adams<br>
								November 10, 2005<p>(4.5 stars out of 5)<p>Few 
								artists dare to leave 12 years between albums. 
								Yet few artists are like Kate Bush. </p>
								<p>In an industry filled with corporate 
								pretenders, Bush is an original. And originals 
								work at their own pace. </p>
								<p>Since Bush's last album, 1993's The Red 
								Shoes, Bush clone Tori Amos has released seven 
								albums, which matches Bush's entire catalogue 
								since her 1978 debut. </p>
								<p>Moody single King Of The Mountain was a 
								striking comeback: that instantly identifiable 
								voice over a song that unfolds at its own pace.
								</p>
								<p>There's a reason why Aerial is a double album 
								- and not just because you'd imagine that after 
								12 years there's a backlog of songs. </p>
								<p>Disc one house houses the more 
								straightforward tunes; disc two is a concept 
								piece filled with all manner of ideas and 
								instrumentation. </p>
								<p>Fans will be enthralled; you are channeled 
								directly back into Kate's mysterious, sensual 
								world. </p>
								<p>The gorgeous Pi boasts that low voice Bush 
								pulls out at just the right moment (she even 
								sings numbers from the pi equation - it's 
								musical porn for mathematicians) and the 
								sprightly, string-soaked Bertie is an ode to her 
								young son, her main distraction during the past 
								few years. </p>
								<p>The hypnotic How to Be Invisible is powerful. 
								And even stripped back to just Kate and piano 
								(in Prologue) she still sounds like nobody else 
								and as vital as ever. </p>
								<p>There's still plenty of weirdness - and not 
								just Rolf Harris (cast as a painter) popping up 
								on disc two among an array of bird noises. </p>
								<p>Mrs Bartolozzi not only has the lyric &quot;slooshy 
								sloshy slooshy sloshy get that dirty shirty 
								clean&quot;, but Kate singing &quot;washing machine&quot; over 
								and over. Beat that, Tori. </p>
								<p>Ah, it's so good to have her back. </p>
								<p>The verdict: **** 1/2<br>
								In a word: unique</p>

								</b>November 12, 2005<p>&quot;The wind is whistling 
								through the house.&quot; It was with some 
								appropriateness that Kate Bush named her 1989 
								album The Sensual World. It is in the realm of 
								the senses that Bush explores and always has: 
								from the dark Yorkshire moors to the utterly 
								primal pleasure in the response to your child's 
								smell. It is in the realm of the senses that 
								Bush is at her most compelling and, often, 
								confounding. </p>
								<p>That duality is the coin of this realm so if 
								you enter it with this double album - split into 
								slightly emotionally divergent discs called A 
								Sea of Honey and A Sky of Honey - you must come 
								knowing that you may not always &quot;understand&quot; 
								intellectually but that you will always feel.
								</p>
								<p>Take, for example, Mrs Bartolozzi, from the 
								first disc, which on superficial reading could 
								be dismissed as some ode to the char lady (the 
								refrain is &quot;washing machine/washing machine&quot; and 
								there is a bit of &quot;slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy&quot;). 
								But feel it rather than think it and you begin 
								to grasp issues of domestic bliss and 
								loneliness; earthiness and innocence; Virginia 
								Woolf and W. H. Auden. </p>
								<p>Similarly, on disc two - which is a 
								song-cycle built from one day's first birdsong 
								through to the morrow's dawn - there is 
								Somewhere in Between. Built on a warm, ambient 
								bed reminiscent of Talk Talk's Life's What You 
								Make It, it could be cast aside by the hasty as 
								both lyrically and musically slight. But that 
								would be to miss the slowly settling warmth and 
								pleasure, that sensation of coming to rest at 
								the end of a day of action. </p>
								<p>To skip over what Somewhere in Between does 
								would be to miss the way it prepares the ground 
								for one of this album's climactic and quite 
								stunning emotional soundscapes, Nocturn and 
								Aerial. Here are songs that open up to you like 
								one of those time-lapse photography nature 
								documentaries: gentle, promising, then 
								flowering, bursting and finally radiant and 
								erotic. It charges you with energy, with life.
								</p>
								<p>The songs already mentioned are, in a sense, 
								the tent markers, the perimeters, rather than 
								the whole story of this album (I could spend 
								twice as much time talking about the heart- and 
								gut-wrenching A Coral Room alone). </p>
								<p>There isn't a genuine pop song here, a Hounds 
								of Love or even a Cloudbusting, and in isolation 
								some tracks would feel lost. But then this is an 
								album to be played for its cumulative effect 
								rather than its single moments. An album to be 
								felt. &quot;The wind it blows the door closed.&quot;</p>

                                &quot;How to be Invisible&quot; is a song title that well 
                                defines the past decade of Kate Bush's life: 
                                after 1993's odd album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, the 
                                waifish singer retreated to quiet family life, 
                                toiling sporadically on an album even she 
                                sometimes doubted she would complete.<br>
                                <br>
                                Thankfully, she persisted. &quot;Aerial&quot;, a double 
                                album of two distinct halves, is probably her 
                                best ever, a confident, adventurous, delicate 
                                and enchanting work that displays a fascination 
                                with life, love, nature and the tedium of 
                                domesticity.<br>
                                <br>
                                &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;, written in 1996 as a 
                                musing about Elvis, is the most conventional 
                                pop, reminiscent of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. &quot;Pi&quot; 
                                tells of a man obsessed with numbers, while 
                                &quot;Mrs. Bartolozzi&quot; is a sexually-tinged reverie 
                                of a woman watching the washing going round. Er, 
                                right.<br>
                                <br>
                                Disc two is the deeper half, a lush song suite 
                                of piano, strings and birdsong, charting the 
                                progress of day from one dawn to the next.

                                rock's great enigma for more than a decade but 
                                she returns with an eccentric album mixing 
                                domestic passions and mystique, writes James

                                <br>
                                It starts with a high piano tinkling in A - so 
                                far, so normal. Then it shifts and shifts again, 
                                four key changes in two bars, sharp to flat, 
                                major to minor, sweet to downright strange. A 
                                classical pianist would have understood what the 
                                girl was doing to get such unsettling sound, but 
                                no one wrote pop like that.<br>
                                <br>
                                And no one sang like that: a wailing falsetto 
                                with a hint of the madwoman in the attic, a dash 
                                of Emily Dickinson and a touch of Emily Bronte 
                                who died of consumption in her early 20s and who 
                                was born on July 30, the same day as a teenager 
                                growing up in Kent in the 1970s called Catherine 
                                Bush - who heard this fact, was spooked and 
                                thrilled by it, and sat down one night under a 
                                full moon at midnight and wrote a song called 
                                Wuthering Heights.<br>
                                <br>
                                Released in 1978, when Bush was 19, Wuthering 
                                Heights raced to the top of the British charts 
                                (knocking off Abba), the first time a woman had 
                                done so with a song she wrote herself. That year 
                                she put out two albums, drawing on hundreds of 
                                songs she had written since she was 12. She sang 
                                of incest and suicide, of Peter Pan and the 
                                ghost of a shot-down Spitfire pilot yearning to 
                                see London Bridge in the rain. As her London gay 
                                fan club later described her, she was 
                                &quot;eccentric, elusive, and very, very English&quot;.<br>
                                <br>
                                If her roots could be defined they were in folk, 
                                classical music, literature and the Romantic 
                                tradition, never in the trends of the day. At 
                                the snarling, spitting height of punk she wore a 
                                leotard and pranced about on videos trailing 
                                bits of pre-Raphaelite fabric behind her. She 
                                was an easy target for parody, because she was 
                                one of a kind.<br>
                                <br>
                                She made five albums in seven years, culminating 
                                in her 1985 work Hounds of Love, perhaps her 
                                masterpiece, which former Sex Pistol John Lydon 
                                described as &quot;beyond an album, an opera&quot;. Though 
                                she only toured once - she disliked live 
                                performance and is said to have a fear of flying 
                                - she attracted an army of adoring, sometimes 
                                obsessive, fans. Then, in 1993, after two 
                                commercially unsuccessful albums and widening 
                                pauses between them, the music stopped.<br>
                                <br>
                                Bush vanished. She made no records, gave just 
                                one interview in 12 years. Despairing fans 
                                debated on websites whether it was all over. The 
                                tabloids, possibly irked by a celebrity who 
                                dared to deny them their daily feed, painted her 
                                as Miss Havisham of Great Expectations, a weirdo 
                                recluse shut up in her mansion on an island in 
                                the upper Thames. What was she up to? Rumours 
                                ran wild: Bush had finally succumbed to the 
                                pleas of record company executives, invited them 
                                to her house to witness her latest creation, and 
                                produced a batch of home-made cakes from the 
                                oven.<br>
                                <br>
                                At last, in August, came an EMI press release: a 
                                Kate Bush album was imminent. After 12 years, 
                                the news caused a stir. Newspapers dusted off 
                                headlines: Kate Expectations and Dithering 
                                Heights. Journalists were invited to EMI's 
                                London headquarters to get a sneak preview, with 
                                a security man watching over them. Bush even did 
                                an interview.<br>
                                <br>
                                This week she released Aerial, a 16-track double 
                                album. As with everything she has done, it is 
                                diverse, unpredictable, wild. A conventional 
                                rock track precedes a cascade of flamenco 
                                guitar, which runs on from a strings 
                                arrangement. Her word imagery is 
                                characteristically vivid: &quot;the spider of time is 
                                crawling over the ruins,&quot; she sings in A Coral 
                                Room, about the death of her mother, Hannah. She 
                                also sings to a pigeon and, as immune to fashion 
                                as ever, has a dialogue with Rolf Harris, who 
                                plays a street painter and blows the didgeridoo.<br>
                                <br>
                                The album betrays Bush's preoccupations: there's 
                                a song about Elvis and Citizen Kane, another 
                                called How to be Invisible. Yet there's a better 
                                clue to the mystery, in the narcotic ballad, Mrs 
                                Bartolozzi.<br>
                                <br>
                                A woman is watching clothes in a washing 
                                machine. Around and around they go, slosh slosh, 
                                and as she stares at them, she starts to imagine 
                                ...<br>
                                <br>
                                &quot;My blouse wrapping itself around your trousers 
                                ... oh the waves are coming in ... my shirt 
                                floating up around my waist ...&quot;<br>
                                <br>
                                Then she looks outside: &quot;I think I see you 
                                standing outside, but it's just your shirt 
                                hanging on the washing line.&quot;<br>
                                <br>
                                The dream broken, drudgery returns: &quot;Slooshy, 
                                sloshy, slooshy, sloshy ... washing machine, 
                                washing machine, washing machine.&quot;<br>
                                <br>
                                In an interview published in Mojo last week Bush 
                                broke her silence. &quot;For the last 12 years, I've 
                                felt really privileged to be living a normal 
                                life,&quot; she said. &quot;It's so a part of who I am. 
                                It's so important to me to do the washing, do 
                                the hoovering. Friends of mine in the business 
                                don't know how dishwashers work. For me, that's 
                                frightening. I want to be in a position where I 
                                can function as a human being.&quot;<br>
                                <br>
                                She was devastated by the death of her mother in 
                                the early 1990s. She slept a lot, couldn't work, 
                                watched a lot of bad television. She ended one 
                                long relationship - with the musician and sound 
                                engineer Del Palmer - and started another, with 
                                musician Danny McIntosh. In 1998, the couple had 
                                a child and managed to keep it quiet for 18 
                                months, until Bush's friend, the musician Peter 
                                Gabriel, blurted it out on radio. She built a 
                                home studio so she could make her own music. She 
                                took complete control of her life.<br>
                                <br>
                                Here's how Bush has explained her seclusion: 
                                &quot;The more I got into presenting things to the 
                                world, the further it was taking me away from 
                                what I was, which was someone who just used to 
                                sit quietly at a piano and sing and play ... I 
                                am just trying to be a good, protective mother. 
                                I want to give Bertie as normal a childhood as 
                                possible while preserving his privacy.&quot; In an 
                                age of obsession with even the minutiae of 
                                celebrities' lives, being a recluse is the only 
                                way Bush can be normal.<br>
                                <br>
                                To Paul Rees, editor of British music magazine 
                                Q, it helps to explain her success. &quot;She is a 
                                genuine enigma,&quot; he says. &quot;Contrast her with 
                                Madonna. You can't possibly want to know any 
                                more about Madonna.&quot; He sees Bush's restraint as 
                                the key to her longevity. &quot;What you know of her 
                                you know through her music.&quot;<br>
                                <br>
                                Rees, who hadn't heard Aerial when he spoke to 
                                The Age, sees it as a critical album for Bush: 
                                will it help her break through to a new, younger 
                                audience? BBC entertainment writer Darren Waters 
                                thought Aerial was &quot;not for the iPod 
                                generation&quot;.<br>
                                <br>
                                So far critics are divided about the album. 
                                Incomparable, impenetrable, pretentious and 
                                sublime: British reviewers have used all these 
                                words in the past two weeks. But to Observer 
                                reviewer Kitty Empire Aerial was genius and 
                                &quot;arguably the most female album in the world, 
                                ever&quot;.<br>
                                <br>
                                That may be the point. &quot;Luvverly Bertie,&quot; Bush 
                                trills to her son, backed by Renaissance 
                                guitars. Its intensity is compelling, though as 
                                Guardian reviewer Alexis Petridis pointed out, 
                                it's a song that will have Bertie slamming doors 
                                and yelling &quot;Mum you're so embarrassing&quot; when he 
                                gets to 15. For now, though, Bertie leads a 
                                magical life of sun, wind, paint, chirruping 
                                birds and English green. His mother's life is 
                                also in the music. If Aerial tells the truth, at 
                                47 Kate Bush has found her compass, her own way

                                by Ross Clelland<br>
                                November 22, 2005<p align="left">It's easy to 
                                trot out the typical words 'enigmatic', 
                                'unique'. But with Kate Bush, they almost 
                                understate her status. Not many artists would 
                                take a decade between albums and still have it 
                                welcomed with such anticipation.<br>
                                <br>
                                And what she delivers after this hiatus of life 
                                changes- the birth of her son and death of her 
                                mother obviously pivotal events- is a Kate Bush 
                                album; nothing more or less. Musical beds are 
                                largely built on layers of synths that some 
                                younger pretenders might consider a little 
                                old-fashioned. Her voice is still that thing of 
                                wonder which can soar, though maybe not as 
                                hysterically as the precocious 19 year old who 
                                offered that psycho-analytic dissection (with 
                                eccentric dancing) of Wuthering Heights. It's 
                                leavened now with a conversational lower 
                                register, with a couple of decades more life 
                                colouring it. It can still move you: in a nice 
                                twist on singing the phone book, in the midst of 
                                Pi's musing on a mathematician's obsession, she 
                                starts reciting the decimal places of the 
                                equation, and somehow imbues the numbers with 
                                real longing and emotion.<br>
                                <br>
                                As that suggests, her worldview and lyrical 
                                concerns cover everything from cerebral to 
                                historical, from mundane to eccentric. Joanni 
                                has Joan Of Arc's sparkling armour inspiring 
                                rockstar-like devotion. Meantime, Mrs Bartolozzi 
                                imagines love scenes in her washing machine's 
                                spin cycle.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Sky of Honey second disc centres on a theme 
                                of a twilight to dawn, probably see from her own 
                                window. Birds fly home and outward, a painter 
                                (as voiced by Rolf Harris no less...) sees his 
                                day's work marred by rain, but then finds 
                                something new in the streaks.<br>
                                <br>
                                But overall Bush's priorities have changed, And 
                                while some mothers will write nursery rhymes of 
                                love to their sons, Bertie now has his mother's 
                                affection in song, but it's more medieval 
                                madrigal than Hi-5. Aerial is a portrait of a 
                                woman- a woman continuing to confound and 
                                delight us.
