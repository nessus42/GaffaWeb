</P>
<P>Hi-Fi &amp; Record Review 
</P>
<P>December 1985 issue 
</P>
<P>&lt;The following article was written by Sue Hudson, an editor for the
British  magazine Hi-Fi &amp; Record Review. It appeared in their December 1985
issue. Ms.  Hudson's article may not be accurate in every detail, but it's one
of the most  heartfelt brief statements about Kate to have appeared in a
mainstream British  publication to date. IED felt it would be a nice
introduction to the world of Kate  Bush.&gt; 
</P>
<P>Back Door: Sue Hudson explores the unique poetry of Kate Bush 
</P>
<P> We've been holding our breath for a long time. Three years of playing the
old  songs and wondering &quot;whatever next?&quot; Would it be even weirder
than The  Dreaming ? Would it leave more admirers by the wayside, shaking their
heads? 
</P>
<P>The real fans will happily go along for the ride, even if she isn't going
the pretty  way. For Kate journeys into new and exciting territories. She is an
original in a music  world dominated by cover versions, regressive movements and
identikit superstars.  The direct opposite of the archetypal rock star:
compulsively introvert in a world of  screaming extraverts, middle-class and
deeply English amid England's all-pervasive  working class American ethos,
boldly feminine in rock's macho climate. Her  melodic genius and articulate
lyrics make the rest seem moronically simplistic. Her  instrumentation is far
removed from the traditional guitar/drum-kit set-up and  predictable synthesiser
riffs. Instead, she brews a heady mixture of musique  concrete, multi-tracked
chorus and acoustic instruments from the digeridu to the  balalaika; all
skillfully appropriated to produce precisely calculated effects. Her lyrics  are
also multi-diverser. After a thousand songs on the theme of 
boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl or Thatcher's Britain, exposure to her music comes
as  an imaginative release as we go giddily flying into the limitless
possibilities of the  poetic viewpoint. Here is talk of whales, of Peter Pan,
kites, Houdini, mysticism... 
</P>
<P>Acquaintances have observed, &quot;She lives in a world of her own.&quot;
But it's a world  that lives within all of us, and her songs shine light into
neglected areas of our  minds. Using imagery nostalgically familiar to fellow
Englanders, her subjects come  tripping from library shelves, television and
cinema screens and musty books of fairy  tales, the stuff that dreams are made
of. She spins tunes that haunt, twist and turn  the mind, triggering long
forgotten moods. Listening intently to her albums is an  experience akin to
having a lucid and feverish dream. Jungian symbols of youth,  innocence,
spiritual escape and the dark, feminine realm abound. Ghosts haunt the  black
vinyl grooves. Uncanny intimations disturb the sensitive. The spirit of Peter 
Pan hovers over her work, sometimes overtly, as in &quot;In Search of Peter Pan,&quot;
but also  covertly, as a yearning for the human closeness and heightened
awareness of youth.  The plangeant beauty of Irish and English folksong lies at
the heart of the music,  working its ancient magic. Magic, too, is the rich
Celtic blood that Kate shares with  so many poets and spell-weavers. 
</P>
<P>But it's not all brooding intensity. There are jokes, too: some Ealingesque
--  movie-obsessed bank robbers break into The Dreaming, there's a Brechtian
romp  through Arsenic and Old Lace country in &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;, and
those &quot;Darling,  you were wonderful!&quot; theatrics from &quot;Wow&quot;.
Teasing seduction has produced some  adorable songs, a poet's sensuality
perfuming the lyrics. Images of silk and lace,  flickering candlelight, white
rosebushes in a storm, dusty ivy, plaiting hair by the  fire, ravish the mind's
eye. 
</P>
<P>But don't imagine that her music is &quot;wet.&quot; When multi-layered
sonic collage,  Kate's own spectacular vocal tricks and chant-like Oriental
rhythms combine at the  ends of the more fey tracks, the effect can be as
power-packed as the heaviest metal.  The use of Eastern borrowings in odd
harmonies and interlocking, unfamiliar  rhythms opens up and strengthens the
Romanticism. The lyrics, too, have Oriental  influences, in the shape of
Gurdjieff -- a Sufic guru whose strange terminology and  mystic psychology are a
recurring motif. While it must baffle most listeners, it does  lend a suitably
mysterious distancing to her deeply personal songs, sharpening an  image that
threatens to become too sweet. It's a mischievous paradox that, while  rock at
its ultra-macho best is exhilarating and energising, just at the moment when  it
is most strident and loud, it leaves you needing something more. Then along
comes  a shy doctor's daughter from Welling who out-screams the best, out-powers
the  noisiest and tops it with the satisfying impact of musical and
psychological depth. It's  almost Wagnerian. 
</P>
<P>In a sense, the music is retrospective, since it uses the English/ Irish
folk idiom  that went, via country-and-western, to make up rock and roll. The
blues/gospel  element of Kate's &quot;rock&quot; music is very minor. The
rhythms are more often Oriental  or old-European than African -- waltzes, jigs
and ragas. So, to the European and the  Eastern ear, Kate's music has a sweet
familiarity, especially for the British, who  learn their folksongs in school
and still sing hymns and carols in the traditional  settings. 
</P>
<P>Her talent was precocious. The &quot;Saxaphone Song&quot; and &quot;The Man
With a Child in  his Eyes&quot; were recorded as demo tapes when Kate was still
at school. The first  album, The Kick Inside (1978), cased tremendous media
interest and is still the  public's favourite. Her voice, criticised at the
time, was small and childlike, the  range erratic, if impressive. Since then it
has improved enormously, deepening and  gaining power and flexibility, until now
it is a great asset, individual and capable of  both subtle and stunning
effects. The fleshing out of the basic material has also  improved with
experience, the moods becoming more atmospherically defined, with  more
sophisticated instrumentations and extrapolation of themes. 
</P>
<P>The second album, Lionheart, was made at the height of her popularity and is
 almost extravert in tone, with a strong dash of theatricality. Its
hit-that-never-was,  &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, has fun with the ghosts and
ghouls that lurk in the dark corners  of her more sombre songs. &quot;Symphony
in Blue&quot; is optimistic and self-affirming. The  title track is a beautiful
lullaby for a sleeping nation. 
</P>
<P>Never For Ever came next and starts in happy mood, with a summer night of a 
cha-cha-cha tribute to a new-found hero, Delius. The philosophic &quot;All We
Ever  Look For&quot; creates a remarkable and rare mood of reassurance and
upbeat  resignation, a Bush specialty. We end Side One with a hippy tour of
Egypt, but Side  Two plunges straight into gloom with a violent Western. The
dark continues with  the shiveringly ghostly &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;, based
on Henry James's 
</P>
<P>The Turn of the Screw, and the bittersweet &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, with
its ingenious  use of waltz time. The end comes in the horrifying &quot;Breathing&quot;,
a vision of the  nuclear holocaust through the eyes of an unborn child. 
</P>
<P>On to The Dreaming, a strange, alien album full of mysticism and obscuranti.
Its  impact owes much to sheer production quality. Kate has gradually taken over
this  aspect of her records since Lionheart, and each LP is technically more
impressive.  Her voice here is forward and strong and, in &quot;Leave It Open&quot;,
deliberately distorted  to create a surreal effect. &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;
is a shattering trip into madness,  with a stunning culmination which finds Kate
braying like a mule amid a chorus of  Indian drum talk. 
</P>
<P>The new album, Hounds of Love breaks new ground for Kate with the &quot;B&quot;
side.  This is a story -- The Ninth Wave -- told in a series of songs, like a
Pink Floyd  concept album. Free from the necessity of setting a fresh context
for each track, the  lyrics are more spare, more integral to the music, and her
talent blossoms. The  strong storyline, with its claustrophobic, mystic theme,
has possibilities beyond a  mere side, as do many of Kate's ideas. Such a
fertile imagination is quite capable of  keeping our interest in one situation
for an hour, or longer. Her musicianship is now  skilled and inventive enough to
sustain more instrumental episodes and linking  themes. And as mistress of mood,
she has the right combination of talents to stretch  out beyond the limiting
confines of pop into more &quot;operatic&quot; form. 
</P>
<P>Casual listeners will miss the depth of the music. You must sit down with
the lyric  sheet and find out what's going on. All the vocal acrobatics and
weird sounds click  into place when you know what ideas, stories and situations
they are expressing. In  most rock and pop, the music and words may be linked,
but are basically separate.  Kate creates, more and more, a fusion between the
two -- the sounds directly  expressing the subject. this is a throwback to
Wagner's music-drama, with its  leitmotifs, turning music into an idea. The
Beatles revived the technique, and bands  of the hippy era like Pink Floyd
carried the banner. But only since the development  of electronics, which put
virtually the whole world of sound at the fingertips of the  &quot;player&quot;
of a Fairlight, has there been such flexibility to allow individuality and 
encourage creativity. Kate is fast becoming a master in the use of this sonic
montage,  perhaps because the ideas she is using are far more complex, have more
 &quot;resonances&quot;, than those of her contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>But Kate will never be an academic artist, drily applying intellectual music
theory  to the delight of a handful of peers, forging into new areas for the
sake of  &quot;progress&quot;. Her style is personal, individual,
impressionistic. Like Delius, her music  will always flow from poetic necessity,
breaking from the confines of tradition  because expression demands it. I just
hope that she will have the confidence to  follow her instincts and not be
discouraged by the music press, who in the main are  baffled and annoyed by her
uniqueness. Unable to pigeon-hole her music, they turn  instead to ridicule and
condescension to fill the pages. Which is a disservice to the  British public,
who to their undying credit, have made Kate Bush such a popular  success.
