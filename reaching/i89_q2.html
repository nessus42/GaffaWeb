<p>What follows is the latest interview with Kate in a Q/HMV special mag: 
</p>



<p> Follow That! 
</p>

<p>This month adds another blockbuster to record shelves. Presented with the 
requisite lavishly illustrated booklet, This Woman's Work is the title which gathers 
together Kate Bush's six albums plus 31 further tracks hitherto only available on 
B-sides, in French, as &quot;alternative &quot; mixes, and on the live Onstage EP. In short, the 
complete works. And still only 32. For Kate Bush, this collection marks both a 
breathing space and a turning point. &quot;in some ways this boxed set has almost put an 
end to an era, &quot; she says softly, a charming, unaffected woman in jeans, boots, blouse 
and jacket you wouldn't remark if worn by a schoolteacher. Her only armour, in 
fact, is the tape recorder with which she duplicates our interview, perhaps just in 
case she is misquoted. &quot;I can't say what will be that different about my work from 
now on, but it feels like a rounding up, a putting to bed-putting all those little sheep 
in apen! &quot; So with one eye on the future, Kate looks back at a dozen years as a 
recording star, and assesses how she feels about the songs that today stand as a 
corner- stone of modern British music, songs mostly never performed live or, if so, 
not for 11 years and therefore unchanged since the day they were cut. With one 
exception.. . 
</p>



<p>Q: Why did you sing a new vocal on Wuthering Heights for 1986's The Whole Story 
compilation? (Both versions are included in the box. ) 
</p>

<p>I'm happy with my voice now, and I suppose I wanted to make Wuthering Heights 
somehow step up through the decade. It sounded very dated to me: my voice 
sounded so young, the production sounded so '70's. I like the idea of taking the 
song I'm most associated with, and making it me now as opposed to a very young 
girl, as I was in '77. 
</p>

<p>Q: When most artists revise their old songs, they do it live. This, however, is an 
option you've forsaken since 1979 and the multi-costumed and exhausting shows 
of that year, never repeated. Will you continue to forsake that option? 
</p>

<p>I think I'm starting to feel different about a few things, and my attitude toward live 
work is one. I would like to think from this point onwards I could speed up, and 
keep the momentum of my work faster. I have a tendency to think too much. 
I've just started writing again, and there's no pressure on me. I get no sense of 
people expecting anything from me, because I take so long. That's a very nice 
feeling, actually doing something in my own space. How I wrote at least the last 
two albums was to go into the studio and write ideas on to tape, as it werew 
dump stuff on to tape, forget about it and then move on to the next area. But 
when I first started, I always used to write on the piano, and just the last couple 
of months, I've felt at home again writing on the piano. It's such a different 
process, I find it quite shocking. It's like suddenly you've become the memory 
banks; instead of dumping it on tape, it's staying in you. And each time you play 
the song, it changes. The sense of transformation is very subtle; each time you 
play it, something will change. And by continually playing that song, it actually 
begins to develop, almost like it takes on a life of its own. I find this 
fascinating-and exhausting, because I have to use memory and concentraion 
which I haven't had to use in quite a while. Going back to a rooted way of 
working, I do feel a change in myself. Maybe I'm taking the opportunity to 
peruse the landscape and see if there's not things I could change. 
</p>

<p>Q: Is this return to the piano a result of feeling you'd gone as far as you could with 
hi-tech? 
</p>

<p>I do feel that I've achieved things on that last album(TSW). At some points when I 
was making it I thought I would ever finish it. It was a mammoth task. Just 
getting up the courage to get in touch with The Trio Bulgarka took me a long 
time. I wanted to preserve the sense of how precious they were, I didn't want to 
abuse it. A lot of time goes into my fear and worry about something, and 
afterward it's all right anyway. In a way I feel what I should do is jump in there 
and do it! 
</p>

<p>Q: What are you trying to prove? Or have you now overcome that need to prove 
yourself? 
</p>

<p>There is a big part of me that is very over-ambitious. It's ridiculous! And it drags 
me along behind it. It's one of my qualities that I can't deny in my work. I guess 
I'm trying to prove something to myself. But perhaps rather than having to prove 
something, people who create feel a great empty sense of hunger, a feeling of 
emptiness in life. And by being able to create, you can somehow express yourself 
in a way that maybe youn can't in the ordinary realms of life. I really feel it's 
connected to religion-real religion. In your teens you hit the point where there's 
a big introversion-you're saying. Who am I? What am i going to do with myself? 
I really felt when I was 17, which was when the whole propulsion of my creativity 
took over. I changed very dramatically in about two years. I do feel it's an 
introversion that all creative people go through, and a lot of it is linked to religion. 
So many artists are looking for God, and this is where we find the voice to try 
and speak. It's also a kind of self-therapy, trying to heal yourself. 
</p>

<p>Q: Of what? 
</p>

<p>Probably a sense of inadequacy. And through this expression you at last have a voice, 
whether it's through painting, whatever. And I think it can be a much wiser 
voice. In your creativity there can be quite deep attitudes, and I think its got to be 
linked somehow with the unconscious that you're tapping into. 
</p>

<p>Q: Which of your songs particularly connect with this form of spirituality? 
</p>

<p>Breathing, I think, was one of my first, what I would call spiritual songs. The subject 
matter isn't necessarily, but the spark is. When I was writing it, it felt like: Hang 
on, I don't think I'm writing this-this is a bit too good for me! Rather than the 
song being my creation, I was a vehicle for something that was coming through 
me. 
</p>

<p>Q: Have you defined your religious feelings? 
</p>

<p>No, I don't think so. Iwas a Roman Catholic and brought up in Roman Catholic 
schools. I would never say I was a stict follower of Roman Catholic belief, but a lot 
of the images are in there; they have to be, they're so strong. Such powerful 
beautiful, passionate images! There's a lot of suffering in Roman Catholicism. I 
think I'm looking for not necessarily religion, but ways of helping myself to 
become more understanding, more complete, a happier person-what we all want 
in life. But I really don't think I've found a niche. 
</p>

<p>Q: You hint at the possibility of confronting a live audience again. Was your 
performance as a hapless bride in TV's Comic Strip play, Les Dogs, by way of 
dipping a toe into public appearance? 
</p>

<p>I love comedy. I think comedy is so.. .. profound. And like everyone, I really love the 
whole new wave of comedy that started with The Young Ones. I'm a big fan of 
all the people involved. I'd seen Strike(another Comic Strip special), and I was 
very impressed by the look and Peter Richardson's direction. What those guys 
do is very special: it might not always work-it's experimental-but its essence is 
challenging and wonderful. I wanted to make a video for TSW, but I was feeling 
insecure as a peformer. Though I like being the observer rather than the 
observed, I felt this time I had to confront myself as the observed. And what 
would help would be to take on a part that would give me a sense of confidence 
and creative feedback. I liked the idea of working with Peter, and I also really 
like the attitude in their work towards women. A lot of films I sit there thinking, 
That's stupid! We worked on the video and it was alot of fun, and we stayed in 
touch as friends. When he was working on the Comic Strip series, I got a script 
and he asked me if I'd play a part. It was a perfect challenge. I thought, OK, if 
you're going to confront yourself as a performer, here's an opportunity. I felt 
very honoured to be asked. It was a completely different pace of working and I 
learned a lot. You sit around and read all day, but also you're on tenterhooks. 
Videos are much more frightning, because there I'm trying to be me rather than 
someone else. I quite enjoyed acting; I wasn't sure I would. I'd never really 
wanted to be an actress, but I love film. I'm not sure if I want to act again, but if 
an interesting director asked me, my ego probably wouldn't let me say no! I love 
film directors, and I guess part of me would eventually love to make a film-just a 
short one. 
</p>

<p>Q: The promo film for Cloudbusting was short-and it included Donald Sutherland, a 
real film star.. .. 
</p>

<p>I still can't get over the fact that he did it! It was great! It means a lot to people that 
someone who is supposedly so famous and inaccessible makes the effort to make 
themselves accessible for such a little project. I was extremely moved by the fact 
that he did it; it meant a tremendous ammount to me. And to work with 
him-Jesus, I thought I would never have the luck. I was his co-star! Ridiculous! 
</p>

<p>Q: The boxed set rarities include Cloudbusting's so called &quot;Orgonon Mix&quot;. The song 
was based on A Book Of Dreams, Peter Reich's memoirs of his father, Wilhelm 
Reich, who held that sexual energy could be transformed into what he called 
&quot;orgone&quot; energy. Yes? 
</p>

<p>If I've got this right, he believed that sexual energy was positive, usable energy that 
he tied in with his concept of orgone energy. He upset a lot of people selling 
orgone boxes, saying they could cure cancer and stuff. He ended up being 
arrested and put in prison. I knew nothing about Wilhelm when I read the book, 
which was his son's experience of all this, written from a child's point of view 
with atremendous innocence and sadness. Years ago, I just went into a shop and 
picked it off the shelf, and really liked the title and the picture on the front. I'd 
never bought a book before which I hadn't known anything about; I just felt I'd 
found something really special. And nine, 10 years later, I re-read it and it turned 
into a song. When it was finished, I wrote a letter to Peter Reich saying what I'd 
done. It was important to me in some way to have a sense of his blessing because 
his book really moved me. He sent me back such a lovely letter. It was an 
incredible feelin g of returning something he'd given to me. 
</p>

<p>Q: Molly Bloom's monologue from Joyce's Ulysses in the song TSW, Wuthering 
Heights of course-have other books provided inspiration? 
</p>

<p>Every book I've read has had a very big effect on me. At the moment it's a 
conscious decision that I'm trying to do a lot more reading. When I was very 
little I read a lot, but not that much in my twenties. I think people should read 
more; we've all got conned by the cheap thrill of television. Reading a book does 
not just make you think, it makes you explore. I think The Shining is terrific; its 
the only book by Stephen King I've read. It's atmosphere ended up in a couple 
of my songs, and Get Out Of My House(from The Dreaming) was very inspired 
by it. I think literature is the most powerful form, but all works of art inspire 
artists; I find films very inspirational. 
</p>

<p>Q: Like.. . ? 
</p>

<p>So many films touch you, even if it's only the atmosphere you're left with. There 
was The Innocents(adapted from Henry James's ghost story The Turn Of The 
Screw and directed in 1961 by Jack Clayton, starring Deborah Kerr and Michael 
Redgrave) which I saw when I was a kid. It was so strong, and years later I wrote 
The Infant Kiss. There's an old horror film called Night Of The Demon(adapted 
from the M. R. James short story Castin The Runes and directed in 1957 by 
Jacques Tourneur, starring Dana Andrews and Peggy Cummins) and that very 
much inspired Hounds Of Love. 
</p>

<p>Q: Is other music inspirational? 
</p>

<p>I tend not to listen to music as consistently as i take in visual imagery. I don't know 
if this is deliberate or because i spend so much time working my ears listening to 
music. There's also a slight problem, i guess, that if you really like something, you 
find yourself being pulled towards it without realising. 
</p>

<p>Q: And pictures? 
</p>

<p>I love paintings. Years ago when I didn't have the money to afford it at all, I bought 
a big picture. People thought i was mad, and they were right! But I just fell in 
love with it. It's a bit like Millais's Ophelia, but a modern image of it; in fact, 
she's floatin in a sewer, hahaha! But I thought the irony was great, and the 
water, although it's disgusting, has all the colours of oil in it. I do have a 
tremendous fascination with grotesque beauty and sad humour, opposites put 
together. I'd sit and look at that picture and than spend a couple of hours 
writing. 
</p>

<p>Q: Your fans are among the most devoted in music. Lacking the feedback of a live 
audience, are you aware of many people's more than averagely intense interest in 
you and your work? 
</p>

<p>It sounds really corny, but i feel so honoured that people into my music are so.. .. . 
patient. Their priorities are gorgeous; I don't feel thare's a fickleness- they're 
happy with whatever i do. It's almost a form of love. When we did the shows last 
time(1979), I did love it. The contact with the audience was fantastic. But I did feel 
a tremendous sense of intensity towards me and I felt very exposed. I'm really 
quite a quiet, private person, and it was very difficult for me, and that's got a lot 
to do with why I haven't toured, which has left me without a great sense of 
contact with an audience. It's quite a surprise to me to think I'm a famous 
person. It jolts me and I think, Oh my God! Right now, I would like to have more 
contact with audiences again. I think it would be a nice thing. 
</p>

<p>Q: Peter Gabriel, Nigel Kennedy, Dave Gilmour-these are the musicians whom 
you're linked. Is it a social set, or do you have a social life that excludes music? 
</p>

<p>It depends. I do go through phases, very much so. Some are professional and some 
are very much friends. Nigel is the fullest of the two, in that we work together 
and he's also a great friend. He's really nice to work with, and because we're 
friends, the communication's great. You develop an almost unspoken sense of 
what you want, and a lot less needs to be said. They trust you, you trust them. 
It's much easier to experiment because they're not so frightened. There's a lot 
to be said for workin with people who are close to you. I've lost one of our 
important members of that group: Alan Murphy(a regular guitarist with 
Kate)died late last year and another friend of mine died this year. Again, that's 
why I feel the boxed set marks the end of an era because I'll never work with 
them again. And I do miss them, and it's made me think about a lot of things, 
and I have consciously taken a break from work since their deaths to do nothing. 
I've just taken six months off. I've had six months gaps between things, but 
always carrying this project around, and I don't know why I haven't done it 
before. I'm a bit obsessive about my work you see. But now I can see there's a 
part of me that loves not being tied into a project, that loves just to be able to go 
off. 
</p>

<p>Q: Have you begun to formulate your next move? 
</p>

<p>Yes, I have, but I can't tell you because it's probably oing to change! I want to find a 
balance between the observer and the observed. I love making music, and as long 
as I'm doing that, even if the albums don't sell, there'll be a certain amount of 
recognition. I feel I have to accept that, and learn from it and not run away from 
it any more.. . 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush relaxes with a Silk Cut-a habit common among ballet dancers past and 
present-and is asked once again to contemplate the life of isolation. In other 
words, to select her desert island discs. Sitting as we are in the legendary Abbey 
Road studios, her choice of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 
and Magical Mystery Tour could not be more appropriate, followed by Brian Eno 
and David Byrne's My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts (&quot;tremendously influential on 
me and the whole of modern of modern music with the repitition and sampling 
&quot;), her friend Nigel Kennedy's The Four Seasons (&quot;There's something light and 
uplifting about it&quot;), The Trio Bulgarka's Strati Angelaki (on the Bulgarian 
compilation LP, Balkana), Donal Lunny's last album (called Donal Lunny) 
Eberhard Weber's Fluid Rustle (&quot;a lot of fond memories&quot;), Billie Holliday's I love 
You Porgie (&quot;the singer of singers. Lindsey Kemp used to use this one in a show 
of his, and the combination of her sining and his theatre was terrific&quot;) and Pink 
Floyd's Comfortably Numb. 
</p>

<p>Q: A song of your own? 
</p>

<p>&quot;The song The Sensual World. Cloudbusting has fond memories for me because of 
the book and the video, but The Sensual World because musically I'm jolly 
pleased with it-and it was hell to make! &quot; 
</p>

<p>Q: And your book? 
</p>

<p>&quot;Oscar Wilde, in particular The Happy Prince. That's a strong story for me; I heard 
it a lot when i was little. It's so sad. I guess that's the Irish. We all like the 
beauty of sadness, but I do think there's a real Irish link of the happy with the 
sad. Everything contains the opposite-the little observer and the little observed. 
This is my plan, to get the balance.. . &quot;
