<h3>Red Shoes Diaries</h3>

<p>It's a fact: You never know how many friends you have 
until word leaks out that you're planning to interview 
Kate Bush. Then long-lost &quot;pals&quot; come 
slinking through the woodwork, creeping from under 
the floorboards, even jumping out at you from your 
own refrigerator, with the most outrageous requests.</p> 

<p>Things like, &quot;I know you and I haven't spoken in 
years, but could you get Kate to autograph this rare 
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; picture-sleeve 45?&quot; 
Or, &quot;Here's a turn-of-the-century copy of 
<em>Wuthering Heights</em>, the Bronte book she 
based her first single on -- could you give it to her, 
along with my name and number?&quot; And, of course, 
the bad taste topper, &quot;I have a limited-edition Kate 
Bush boxed set containing all her work -- would you mind 
very much getting it signed while you're speaking with 
her?&quot; All contestants, form a line! Would the 
entreaties never end? </p>

<p>After a while, a frank answering machine message seemed 
like the best idea: &quot;Thanks for calling, but if you're 
phoning about a Kate Bush autograph, go tell it on the 
mountain.&quot; </p>

<h3>   THE NEW ALBUM</h3>

<p>Bush, 35, has always kept her songwriting purposely oblique, 
which probably confounds fans trying to catch a fleeting 
glimpse of her psyche. What a surprise, then, to hear the 
unabashed honesty of her <em>Red Shoes</em> requiem, dedicated 
to the memory of her recently departed mother, Hannah. </p>

<p>Most of the project finds her as a lost and frightened small 
child abandoned in a busy shopping mall and calling out for 
guidance from all the passing adults. At one point, Bush 
seeks the advice of family friend &quot;Lily,&quot; who -- 
while brother Paddy coaxes chirrupy noises from strange 
instruments like fujare and singing bowls -- recommends, 
&quot;Child, you must protect yourself/ l'll show you how 
with fire.&quot; But still her charge frets, &quot;Oh Lily, 
I'm so afraid/ l fear I am walking in the veil of darkness.&quot;</p>

<p>There are no quick solutions for Bush this time around. 
In the plaintive piano ballad &quot;And So Is Love,&quot; 
she mourns, in a voice that rises to the rafters and beyond, 
&quot;We used to say, 'Ah, hell, we're young'/ But now we 
see that life is sad/ And so is love.&quot; For 
&quot;You're the One,&quot; even the dulcet tones of the 
Trio Bulgarka can't penetrate the melancholy mist: 
&quot;I've got everything I need,&quot; she sadly notes, 
&quot;I've got petrol in the car/ l've got some 
money with me/ There's just one problem....You're the 
only one I want.&quot; Did a breakup occur between 
Bush and her paramour/bassist, Del Palmer? It's never 
explained, and -- given the lady's penchant for privacy -- 
it was probably planned that way. Set to a sprightly 
walking rhythm, the irresistible single &quot;Rubberband 
Girl&quot; offers Bush at her most hopeful, wishing she 
could become a &quot;rubberband bouncing back to life.../ 
lf I could learn to give like a rubberband/I'd be back on 
my feet.&quot;</p>

<p>Elsewhere, as in the Celtic-flavored title track and the 
Macedonian-inspired &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; a 
celebratory sound holds sway, getting Bush up out 
of her funk and back into life's pulsing rhythm. Well-wishing 
cameos aside -- Gary Brooker, Eric Clapton, and Prince 
put in guest appearances -- the ultimate success of 
<em>The Red Shoes</em>, and how it will likely be viewed in 
future catalog context, is as an artistic catharsis. Or, 
if you're into primal scream therapy, one long howl 
into the impartial void.</p>

<h3>  NEW YORK</h3>

<p>These were some of the things bouncing around in 
my noggin as the jet touched down in the Big Apple. 
Where, I quickly learn, Kate Bush had done a rare 
Tower Records in-store the night before. As the winter
winds beat down on Broadway, an unexpected crowd 
of 2,500 queued up for autographs; most came bearing 
gifts, and Bush's reception table inside was soon piled 
high with CDs, books, flowers, even a pair of red dance 
shoes in the singer's size. One young female fan asked 
to have her forearm signed, but Bush declined upon 
discovering the girl's plan to have the design permanently 
tattooed there afterwards. Another acolyte became so 
flustered he could only stammer, &quot;Your music...good!&quot; 
to his storybook princess. Pretty much says it all, doesn't it?</p>


<p>And this isn't some passing fad, either. Kate Bush 
commands a certain type of respect usually reserved 
for old-time film stars. That Gloria Swanson, 
glide-down-the-staircase, ready-for-a-closeup kind of awe. 
For instance, several writers are seated in the Sony 
Records screening room, ready for the first 
Stateside viewing of Bush's <em>The Line, the 
Cross, the Curve</em>. We're all talking amongst 
ourelves, wondering aloud how good the movie might 
turn out to be, when in walks Bush, prim and proper in 
a flowing pantsuit and tinted owlish spectacles, 
looking like a more professorial Mary Steenburgen. 
A hush falls over the room. A big hush. An awe. 
&quot;I'm so glad you all could make it today,&quot; 
she coos in a soft, cultured English accent. 
&quot;And I'll be right here, enjoying the film with you!&quot; 
Nervous glances ping-pong around the room, and if 
there was one collective thought rising up from the 
seats, it was, &quot;Oh my god! I'm watching Kate 
Bush's film with KATE BUSH!&quot; Screenings don't 
get much more personal than that.</p>

<p><em>The Line, the Cross, the Curve</em> didn't 
disappoint. In the starring role as a nubile naif duped 
by an evil witch (played with cunning zeal by Miranda 
Richardson) into trying on the cursed red slippers, 
Bush isn't the greatest actress. But her direction -- 
full of flowing color and kinetic movement -- keeps 
the screen lively as her 50-minute fairy tale unfolds. The 
soundtrack, of course, is taken directly from <em>The Red
Shoes</em>. For the tropical &quot;Eat The Music,&quot; 
Bush chases Richardson through a field of fresh fruit
and stomps in time to the music; for &quot;And So Is 
Love,&quot; she sits alone in a garret while a bird flutters 
overhead and then falls moribund to the floor, done in --
you reckon -- by the overwhelming sentiment, not Bush's 
piercing vocal style.</p>

<p>Lindsay Kemp pops up in a guest spot, as the white-faced 
otherworldly guide who tries to free Bush from the magic 
dance/manic spell. Paraphrasing a line from &quot;The Red 
Shoes,&quot; he keeps repeating, &quot;It's really happenin' 
to ya!&quot; to his protege until it's almost laughable, but 
his solution -- as with most fairy tales -- is suitably violent. 
The witch, shall we say, buys the farm. And those red shoes 
will live to frug another day.</p>

<p>The credits roll. The lights go up. And Bush -- remarkably -- 
is still there, seated on a dais in the back and ready to greet 
her audience. Some of the toughest-looking journalists -- the 
kind who look like they've just gone two rounds with Mazzy 
Star -- get a bit tongue-tied as she shakes their hands. 
Is this what meeting British royalty is like? Should you wear 
gloves? Offer some pithy historical witticism to keep the 
conversation going? Just what <em>do</em> you say to 
Kate Bush?</p>

<h3>THE INTERVEW</h3>

<p>Understandably, we writers would have to say <em>something</em> 
to Kate Bush...otherwise there would be no interview. So 
the question of <em>what</em> to say becomes a pretty 
big deal. How do you bring this hermit out of her shell? 
What fires her up, gets her talking, what grounds such 
a busy artistic lifestyle? Is she human, full of emotion 
and vulnerable to predators? Is she superhuman, 
standing tall on Mt. Olympus and watching the plebeian 
riffraff throng adoringly at her feet?</p>

<p>That evening, Bush saunters into her hotel restaurant, 
her attire shifted to a more subtle blue blazer, stirrup 
pants, and low-heeled granny boots. She's even 
removed her glasses, so her points come across 
with the precision she seems to demand in all her 
projects. But -- as expected -- you can't get too 
close, query-wise, and any forays into the personal 
are met with a sidelong glance, a puff of apathetic 
cigarette smoke, and a cold, case-closed smile. 
At the close of the day, Kate Bush remains a mystery.</p>

<p><strong>
CREEM: How did you like the <br>
in-store? Were you surprised <br>
at the turnout?</strong></p>

<p>KATE BUSH: It was really nice to see all those people, 
but I've got a lot of books to get through now.</p>


<p><strong>
I'd always heard that you <br>
graduated from high school <br>
sooner than most kids. Is the <br>
British educational system <br>
better than America's?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure. I suppose I've always felt that the American 
system is a lot better, but I think education is such an 
important thing, and I really wish I'd been better-educated. 
I took the O-levels at the same time as all my friends at 
school, but I left school shortly after that, because I didn't 
want to go on to college -- it wasn't something that 
appealed to me at all. At quite an early age I had a 
very strong drive to get involved with music, and I 
was also very lucky to meet a friend who got me 
through to the part of making some very good 
recordings that eventually led to Gilmour. And then 
we actually ended up going to a master recording 
studio, so I had a deal with a record company while 
I was still very young. It was a very unusual situation to 
be in, because I was still in school. So from that 
point onwards, all I wanted to do was make a good 
record. My heart was set on music.</p>

<p><strong>Is <em>The Red Shoes</em> a metaphor <br>
for that decision, of jumping into<br>
the music biz and then realizing <br>
it's cursed -- you can't stop?</strong></p>

<p>It wasn't meant like that. But I think it's a very interesting 
idea, the whole thing of being possessed by art. 
Because, obviously, I'm under a lot of pressure in 
what I do, but I feel incredibly honored to be in a 
situation where I can do what I like doing. So I 
think that in a lot of ways, I'm very lucky, and I 
don't think that many normal pressures of the 
business really affect me in a very strong way. 
What's important to me is to be able to make 
records that I'm pleased with, and because 
everyone's been so supportive of my work, 
I've been able to do that.</p>

<p><strong>But you also made a decision <br>
to let your family handle most <br>
of your business and management <br>
affairs.</strong></p>

<p>I was very lucky that, early on, I had some really good 
advice from the people around me. And particularly
around that time, I was aware of a lot of friends that
were in bands who would get a manager and have 
nothing but trouble. I'm not saying this is how it is 
nowadays, but that was how it was at that time. I
was advised not to get involved with a manager, 
so I think by not having someone like that around, 
I was more in control of my own situation. And what 
I didn't want to do was end up spending all my 
time being a kind of TV personality, talking about 
my work. Just being happy with what we ended up
with on this record, which does take a lot of time in 
writing -- by my being in control, I was able to choose 
how much time to spend on it, which is a very important
creative decision.</p>

<p>But I don't think you can ever be removed from all the 
bullshit. I think you can spend as little time with it as
possible. I think, ultimately, we are all what we are, 
and it's not so much the situations you go through 
as how you deal with them, how you react to 
things. And a lot of that has to do with a person's
nature. I think most people in this business, writers 
of songs, tend to be very sensitive people, so 
generally, they're quite good at being aware of 
the right priorities. And that's what keeps you down
to earth. Most of the people I know who are very 
successful and good at what they do are actually 
very down-to-earth people.</p>


<p><strong>Songs such as &quot;And So Is Love&quot; <br>
seem filled with despair. And<br>
<em>The Red Shoes</em> might stand as<br>
your most somber work.</strong></p>

<p>I don't think of it as sorrowful or sad. I think there are sad
images, but in most of the situations I tended to balance 
them with things that are quite happy or that have a 
sense of humor. I think a few tracks on this have got 
much more of a sense of humor -- I had a lot of fun 
doing a lot of things on this album.</p>

<p>But I think ultimately, the thing is to look for a positive 
outcome for a sad situation. And what those situations 
ideally do is make you realize how precious life is. It's 
an incredibly privileged position to be in life and be 
happy and to have a life, and it's kind of our duty to enjoy it.</p>

<p><strong>Legend has it that no-one's <br>
ever heard your true singing <br>
voice outside of the studio, <br>
that you always somehow <br>
mask it in effects.</strong></p>

<p>No, that's not true at all.</p>

<p><strong>How do you know when <br>
a song's finally done?</strong></p>

<p>It just comes to a point where you feel it's finished. 
Things just seem to kick into place. And most of 
my songs are written as songs, instead of coming 
up with sections and verses at  different times. 
They're written as a whole piece. And I wanted 
<em>The Red Shoes</em> to be an album of 
songs, to have a little less emphasis on the 
production, to let the songs actually speak for 
themselves, and to try and make it much more 
direct, a bit more simple. So we approached it 
more like a band, where things were being done 
by human beings as opposed to machines. And 
it was really nice working like that, really satisfying.</p>

<p><strong>You've referred to yourself <br>
as an &quot;accompanist,&quot; rather <br>
than a singer. I'm sure your <br>
fans would disagree.</strong></p>

<p>It's very much that the two go together. I don't really think 
of myself as a singer -- I think what I do is, I write songs, 
so that involves a voice singing it with the keyboards as 
accompaniment. [When I started] I could sing in tune and 
that was it, really. I have a very plain voice. And it moves 
through phases -- I think voices get better as you get older, 
as well. </p>

<p><strong>And now you're a big-time<br>
film director, eh?</strong></p>

Did you enjoy it?

<p><strong>Definitely. It's visually stunning, <br>
always something colorful <br>
happening onscreen.</strong></p>

<p>Good. I'm pleased. I think it's just such a fantastic thing 
to play with, working with sounds and pictures. And I 
find the combination really fascinating -- it's something 
I'd like to be able to do more of, just experiment with 
the whole idea of making some kind of film.</p>

<p><strong>How'd you get into directing?</strong></p>

<p>I think it was a fascination with film and editing it. 
Very early on, the director I used to work with would 
always encourage me to go into the editing room, 
and I found that the way a film is put together is 
essentially what it's all about. And eventually I 
became more interested in the idea of using 
videos to tell stories, particularly if that song had 
a story.</p>

<p><strong>The mirror scene, where <br>
Richardson crashes in to <br>
your dimension, reminded <br>
me of Cocteau's <em>Orpheus</em>. </strong></p>

<p>Oh that's nice. I don't know a lot of Cocteau's work, but 
what I've seen I think is fantastic. What's so interesting 
about it is that it's so simple, and yet has such profound ideas.</p>


<p><strong>Can you catch a film at the <br>
theaters without being <br>
recognized?</strong></p>

<p>Well, a lot of time I tend to bring stuff, because if you're 
busy you can't go out and see something really late. 
But I go out to the pictures quite a lot, if it's something 
I really want to see. Like <em>The Fugitive</em> -- I 
saw that in a cinemadome and it was fantastic, so 
well-made. It's absolutely brilliant, with a great story 
and great acting.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any directors you're in awe of?</strong></p>

<p>I don't know about in awe of. There are people's works 
that I'm in awe of. When I see what some people 
manage to create, I stand in wonder at how people 
can achieve these things. There are a lot of filmmakers 
I feel that way about -- Michael Powell, Alfred Hitchcock, 
Terry Gilliam.</p>

<p><strong>It's a wonder  more people <br>
don't take film seriously.</strong></p>

<p>I think it's just what turns people on, really. Do you have 
trainspotters here? In England, we have these people 
who sit and spot trains -- they watch trains, look at the 
number, and they have an absolute passion for it. They 
live their lives to spot trains. And that turns some people 
on, but for other people it's watching movies or reading 
books or appreciating art, opera, or ballet. And some of 
these things appeal to lots of people, and some of them 
only appeal to small groups. And I think they're all valid, 
and out of all the arts I think film is probably the most 
rar-reaching. Not everyone likes the same film, but I 
haven't met anyone who doesn't like watching some kind of film.</p>

<p><strong>How did you land Miranda <br>
Richardson for your project?</strong></p>

<p>I met Miranda at a ball, and she was just perfect for 
the character. And I was so excited when she said 
she'd do it. You don't really have to tell Miranda what 
to do, either. She was lovely to work with. But I think 
what was tough was being in it as well as directing. 
The amount of stamina that you need to do both is 
really difficult to keep up -- I much prefer just directing. 
If you had a small part in a film you could probably get 
away with it, but to take on a major role is just too 
demanding.</p>

<p><strong>And your old friend Lindsay <br>
Kemp dropped in too.</strong></p>

<p>He turned me on to the whole idea of dance. He's a 
very unique mover -- it's not exactly dance, it's a kind 
of, like, expressionist theater. And it was really nice to 
be able to work with him again after all this time.</p>

<p><strong>Ever since you were young, <br>
it seems like art-books, in <br>
particular, have taken you <br>
away to a dream world.</strong></p>

<p>I don't know about living in a dream world, but I think I 
used to read more as a kid than I do now. And I really 
like to spend time reading books. There's nothing like 
reading a book, nothing else at all -- it's so personal. 
All other art forms, in a way, are shared, and not 
something that relies on imagination in such a 
personal way. I think more and more we're being 
removed from the whole experience of reading by 
television, radio, lots of new visual formats. Hopefully, 
it will all end up leading back to the written word.</p>

<p><strong>And <em>Wuthering Heights</em> <br>
was one of your faves?</strong></p>

<p>I wouldn't say that was one of my favorites, really. I 
think it's a very good book, and I think in many ways 
it's the ultimate love story. But it's not one of my 
favorites. But nearly every book I've read has had 
an effect on me -- I enjoyed <em>The Shining</em>. It was a 
really scary one, so well-written, although I don't 
think I've read any other books by Stephen King.</p>

<p><strong>You've just passed the Christ age, <br>
33, when they say you finally gain <br>
true insight into your own soul. <br>
Have you learned anything?</strong></p>

<p>I think that happens once a year for me, really. I think I 
learn more things the hard way -- it takes me quite a 
long time to learn things. So whatever it is, I think I'm 
still learning it. But the way I know I'm progressing is 
that things are a little less disappointing to me each 
time, and that means you're getting somewhere. And 
the positive thing is to let go of what you've done in the 
past and see everything as kind of a new adventure. 
And every time I start an album, I feel like I'm doing it 
for the first time.</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>

<p>Bush finishes her coffee, rises to leave, then turns to 
shake my hand, a professional to the end. &quot;I 
hope we can do this again soon,&quot; she smiles 
warmly. But -- given her shyness and the meticulous 
way she works -- we might be talking some time after 
the millennium here. Still, the gesture seemed heartfelt.</p>

<p>So, all too soon, the adventure was over. Bush went her 
way (Concorde-ing back to her U.K. hideout) and I went 
mine, a bit wiser than when I arrived. And, I'm sure, right 
about now there are Bush-o-philes from coast to coast 
pulling their hair out about this interview. The old 
&quot;Why didn't he ask her <em>this</em>?&quot; and &quot;He 
<em>shouldn've</em> talked to her about <em>that</em>&quot; bit. Which is 
another time-tested fact -- those who can't do, teach. </p>

<p>So, to all of you fanatics who won't be satisfied until 
you know the color of Kate Bush's underwear, I 
apologise for not producing a completely revealing 
profile. And I apologise to all those folks who were 
counting on me to provide them with their first Kate 
Bush autographs -- I confess, I left a day early to 
avoid lugging your crates of CDs, 45s, LPs, and 
books along. I figured Kate would've wanted it that way.</p>
