<P>Date: Fri, 9 Mar 90 06:53:07 EST <BR> From: katefans@world.std.com
(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;
Paul Gambaccini Oct. 8 1982 
</P>
<P>It's always so much fun to go back to old interviews and see things that
point up  to &quot;future&quot; songs. This is a partial transcription of a TV
interview Kate did with Paul  Gambaccini (sp?) in * 1982 *. The show is called &quot;Pebble
Mill at One&quot;. 
</P>
<P>There's a (minor) reference to a future Ninth Wave-type song, but this is 
interesting for other reasons too. Paul is talking first about a radio show that
he and  Kate did together in which Kate chose all the music played on the show.

</P>
<P>The song The Dreaming had been released as a single and had bombed horribly 
(#48 peak) but the album was just then being released. 
</P>
<P>Before you start reading, stop and *think* about the sheer and utter courage
it  took Kate to insist that The Dreaming be the first single from the album. If
Tenner  or Gaffa had been the first single the album would have done much better
(even  though it did reach #3 in the UK). 
</P>
<P>Paul: 
</P>
<P>&quot;When we did our radio program for Christmas, for Radio One, about your
 favorite records, I'm sure that many people were surprised to hear how few 
conventional pop tunes were in there. You had a lot of Irish folk melodies,
African  songs, song with unusual instruments and I therefore thought that when
you really  did take full control of your career there would be a lot of various
surprises for  people which they may not find actually commercial and I think
that's what  happened on the latest single The Dreaming, isn't it?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes absolutely. I mean, it's not really a commercial song at all and I
think that's  rather lovely that you could see, from that program that we did,
perhaps the  direction I was going in and, from my point of view, that program
was fantastic to  get, you know, all those songs played.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Paul: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I recall you had some whaling songs so I'm waiting for your number
about  Orca.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate: 
</P>
<P>(laughs)&quot;yeah, yeah, sea shanties, that'd be great! But I think that's
the problem  too because the direction I'm going in with my art is the way *I*
want to go  because, for me, it's a little deeper, it's got more meaning. It's
not so poppy I  suppose, but of course, maybe that won't be so widely accepted,
especially in the  singles chart, where it seems that things do have to be
obvious really to stand a good  chance of getting places.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Paul: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think a lot of the tracks on your new album are so intense and deep,
with a lot  of various sources of input, that it's difficult to hear on the
radio, catchy the first  time. For example, on The Dreaming you have Rolf Harris
with his digeridu and you  had Percy Edwards doing the animal voices and very
complex lyrics and a change of  voices on your part and I think that probably
was the problem.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I think it was a very complicated single in many ways. It was
demanding as  much from the audience as anything that they would give the time
to listen to it and  try to understand it. So many people said to me that by the
fifth, sixth time that  they'd heard the song that they were actually starting
to really like it and before  then they just hadn't understood it at all. So,
yeah.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The interview continues on about other things but this is all I really
wanted to  post. Paul G. seems to be one of the few DJ types (besides Roger
Scott) that Kate  actually had intelligent conversations with. He's Canadian
(maybe American) and I  haven't heard anything about him in years. Does anyone
know what he's been up  to? 
</P>
<P>So there you have it. Sea shanties no less! Who knows, maybe Paul gave Kate
the  idea for TNW with his crack about Orca! :-) 
</P>
<P>By the time the single TD was released I was a die-hard hard-core Katefan. I
 lived in Leavenworth and made the 80 mile round-trip drive to Kansas City
*just* to  get the single! I remember driving home with it on the passenger seat
and I kept  patting it and picking it up to look at it and hold it and laugh and
the way my spine  was tingling....oh my god. I kept giggling. I just could not
believe that I actually  really honestly no foolin' really and truly no kidding
had a *NEW* Katesong! It's a  wonder I didn't get a speeding ticket. I've driven
all over the country but that was  the longest drive I ever made in my LIFE! 
</P>
<P>When I got home I yelled to my sister-in-law (I'd been trying to get her
into  Kate, maybe this new song would do it for her) &quot;I HAVE KATE'S NEW 
SINGLE!!!!COME LISTEN!!!&quot; I raced upstairs to my room and fumbled to get
the  single on the turntable. When that digeridu sound started I was intrigued
but within  seconds I was wringing my hands in despair. As soon as Kate started
singing I  looked at Cathy and she just shook her head and walked out of the
room. Oh Kate,  ohmygod what have you done? I truly thought she had gone off her
rocker. I took it  off and turned it over to listen to Dreamtime. More of the
same. I sat in silence for a  while and thought ok Kate, you're doing something
I don't understand. What's the  key to this song? I listened again. Horrible! 
</P>
<P>I listened again. Weird! I listened again. Strange, but I like the way you
sing &quot;see  the light bounce off the rocks to the sand&quot;. I listened
again. Unusual, but the  digeridu sounds are very interesting and the animal
noises are cool. I listened again.  Hmmm, odd, but I like those tires squealing
then, BANG-a goes another Kanga on  the bonnet of the van. And that really
interesting sound, what the hell is that? (I  later found out it was Orch 5).
Well, one more time did it. I really liked it. I turned it  over and listened to
Dreamtime again and that's actually when I fell in deep and  irrevocable love
with the A-side! So, first I loved the details, then I loved the music,  then I
learned to love her vocals! 
</P>
<P>By the time the album was released (another 80 mile drive!) it (The
Dreaming)  was my all-time favorite Kate song (besides Wuthering Heights, of
course). Getting  into the album is another story. I listened to it once without
the lyrics and once with  the lyrics. I put the lyrics away and for the next two
weeks played the album  whenever I could as background music, not paying
attention to it. I had to get the  music into my subconcious. I'd read, write
letters, play games, whatever, with the  album playing over and over and over
again. 
</P>
<P>One night I was sitting on my bed reading and all of a sudden the chorus of 
&quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; hit me like a ton of bricks!! That's when I got
the lyrics back  out and spent the next few hours learning the words song by
song. Well, for the next  few months the *only* other album I listened to was
Peter Gabriel's Security (I'd  given that album the same treatment). It may seem
a hell of a weird way to get into  an album but for me it was the best way. 
</P>
<P>She's a genius... 
</P>
<P>She really is... 
</P>
<P>Vickie (one of Vickie'n'Chris) 
</P>
<P>ps: Cathy finally came around and saw the Katelight. 
</P>
<P>pps: A little less than a month after TD album came out I met Chris. What a 
wonderful thing!
