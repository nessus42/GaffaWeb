<P>SWEET KATE! 
</P>
<P>The very private life of the Top Twenty mystery girl 
</P>
<P>By Nina Myskow - The Sun's Queen of Pop 
</P>
<P>The Sun - Sept 22, 1978 
</P>
<P> KATE BUSH is the mystery girl of the pop world. Ever since her weird and 
wonderful single, Wuthering Heights soared its way to the top of the charts,
fans  have found her fascinating. 
</P>
<P>She sings in a strange, swooping way. And when she first appeared on Top Of 
The Pops, the effect was electrifying. 
</P>
<P>Moving like a beautiful, willowy gipsy, she seemed strangely unusual. But is
she? 
</P>
<P>I found her normal, friendly, sweet. And just plain nice. 
</P>
<P>Pop singers are not noted for their punctuality, but she arrived at the 
photographer's studio where we met, exactly on time. 
</P>
<P>A tiny, slender girl, very polite. 
</P>
<P>Was she aware that people thought she might be a bit strange? 
</P>
<P>She said: &quot;I didn't even think that my voice was unusual until people
started  mentioning it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps because I'm a songwriter they think I'm a bit different, that
there  might be something unexplored about me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Songwriting is her main passion. She started writing early in her teens and 
Wuthering Heights was written when she was just 16. 
</P>
<P>Fans 
</P>
<P>She said: &quot;I saw the end of the serial on television. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I hadn't read the book, but that inspired me to read it, and that, in
turn,  inspired the song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now 19, Kate has had two hit singles - the other was [The] Man With The
Child  In His Eyes - and a good album, The Kick Inside, which comprised 13 or
her own  compositions. 
</P>
<P>Her follow-up album is due at the end of October. 
</P>
<P>She appeals to an amazingly wide-ranging audience. From older pop fans to 
children. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I always hoped that I'd reach as many people as possible,&quot; she
said. &quot;It's lovely  to get fan letters, particularly from the kids. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I got a lovely fan letter recently from two little boys written in big
loopy  handwriting, including photos of themselves which I've pinned up in my
flat.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate remembers her own days as a fan. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I was younger I had a really big thing about Elton John,&quot;
she said, &quot;I was  really crazy about him, his music, everything he did. 
</P>
<P>Thrill &quot;I knew classical pianists from records, but he was the first
great popular  piano player I heard. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I used to sit and listen to his records for hours. I wanted to be able
to play like  him, so I used to practice harder.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate even sent Elton a fan letter. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wrote saying how much I like him,&quot; she said. &quot;I quoted
some of Bernie  Tauplin's lyrics and told him how I played his music when I was
low, and how much  better I'd feel. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I took it round to the BBC. I didn't know where else to send it. I
don't suppose  he ever got it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've never met him, I'd love to, of course, but it wouldn't be same.
It would still  be a thrill, though.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's other musical influences come from her family. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have my mother to thank for that. She's Irish, and all her family
are musical,  and could get up and just dance and sing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Friends 
</P>
<P>It was Kate's parents who encourage her to do something with her songs when 
she was 15. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I never thought I'd get anywhere or be successful,&quot; she said. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd, a friend of a friend of her two brothers,
provided  the link with the record company who signed her up a year later. 
</P>
<P>Her younger brother, Paddy, 25, is a member of Kate's backing band. 
</P>
<P>Kate has lived on her own in a flat in London for three years. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I love being on my own with just two cats,&quot; she said. &quot;It's
really good for me. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I decided to leave home because I couldn't stand the traveling from
Kent where  we lived to my dance classes in London.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate works out her dance routines for her songs in her flat. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I learned a lot from Lindsay Kemp's mime classes. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I just put the tape on and work out what it should be,&quot; she said.

</P>
<P>&quot;I don't use a mirror. I haven't got a big one in the flat, only my
dressing-table  mirror. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It gets so depressing looking at yourself if it's not right.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What she sees in her mirror must be far from depressing. 
</P>
<P>She has a heart-catching face with luminous skin and a perfect shape. 
</P>
<P>She looked stunning in the outfit we had chosen for her to wear. 
</P>
<P>Kate also looked fantastic in her own clothes - simple cord jeans and a
satin  waistcoat. 
</P>
<P>When she has time off, Kate likes to spend it just pottering about her flat
and  seeing friends. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've got quite a few friends I've known for years,&quot; she said. &quot;One
special friend,  Lisa, I've know since I was nine. She's a telephonist&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate seems unaware of the devastating effect she has on her male fans. 
</P>
<P>She said: &quot;I didn't realise that they fancy me the way you say.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Happy 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't meet many men on a chat-up level.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate is very happy, though, about her love life. There is a new man around. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We've been going out for a couple of weeks,&quot; she said. &quot;He's
a friend of my  brothers. He's not in the music business, but he's great.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I thought she was very nice, too.
