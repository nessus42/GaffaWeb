<P>  Bushwacked by Kate 
</P>
<P>by Adam Sweeting 
</P>
<P>The woman pouring tea in a hotel near EMI records has a wide, warm smile and
 speaks with such endearing openness that you wonder if the real Kate Bush, the
one  who makes those strange videos and allusive, elusive records, has hired a
double to  do the talking. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's difficult. In interviews I talk complete rubbish most of the
time,&quot; she  protests with a baffled expression. &quot;People ask you
questions and I don't know what  I'm talking about. You're just kind of working
through your thought processes a lot  of the time. That's the thing about
writing songs. You can think very carefully about  what you want to say, but
words are such a powerful thing. Our language is  beautiful but incredibly
ambiguous, isn't it?&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's very hard to say what you mean. Is that what you mean? 
</P>
<P>&quot;And for people to completely understand what you mean,&quot; Kate goes
on. &quot;You  might easily think they do, but actually they've taken it
completely the other way,  and they just wouldn't say. So much of our
communication deals with words when  half the time we don't actually know what
the other person meant at all. We think  we do, and they think we do, so again
it's just continual misunderstanding&quot; 
</P>
<P>Lawks, what a muddle. Kate's complicated layers of meaning were obviously
too  much for the journalist who spoke to her ahead of me because he phoned in
panic  half an hour later to say there was nothing on his tape. But a large
chunk of the  world is in no doubt that the music of Kate Bush is for them,
whether she meant it  to be or not. 
</P>
<P>Kate is only a little less reluctant to meet the press than she is to go on
tour, and  she is facing the hacks this time in order to shed some light on her
latest album, The  Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>To her surprise and delight, people have finally stopped asking her about
her 1978  hit Wuthering Heights and about her sexuality, and instead have been
asking &quot;much  deeper things&quot;. Perhaps, with the charts stuffed with
House, Kylie or heavy metal,  her real worth has become clear. 
</P>
<P>Pop's comings and goings don't interest her much. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's some really bad stuff happening in pop music, isn't there?&quot;
she  murmurs, like somebody discussing a newspaper report of a small, distant
war.  &quot;everyone's been wearing black for the last five or six years in the
music business,  and I see it as a real state of mourning for good music..&quot;

</P>
<P>She admires artists like Peter Gabriel and Pink Floyd, whom she sees as 
perfectionists who work at their own pace. She gets cross with people who
dismiss  middle-aged rockers as unsightly relics of a bygone era, pointing out
that artists in  any other medium rarely reach a peak before they're 40. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World isn't much like the stuff they play on daytime Radio 1,
though  the title track received bags of airplay as a single. The album contains
10 songs - 11  on the CD - and if it takes a while before you feel you know your
way around it, it  eventually dawns on you that it is magnificent. 
</P>
<P>Ms Bush has nimbly drawn a thread of continuity through music patched
together  from any number of sources. 
</P>
<P>Folk melodies rub shoulder with jolting funk rhythms. Simple chord
progressions  are transformed by audacious instrumental voicings and tone
colours. Lyrics which  look flat or oddly naive on paper get up and dance when
Kate sings them. 
</P>
<P>Sometimes, maybe in Deeper Understanding or Rocket's Tail, you find yourself
 ambushed and overwhelmed by great rushes of emotion, about love or childhood or
 the way things keep changing even though you want them to stay the same
forever. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's stupid really,&quot; she says, &quot;the amount of time that's
gone into writing 10  songs. They're just 10 songs, it's not like some cathedral
or something. 
</P>
<P>Technology is all moving very fast, and I think that's very good if you can
keep  the balance between technology and compassion, which is the human element
where  really the work comes in. I think maybe what gets more difficult each
time is  writing material, finding something to say that feels worth saying -
something new  that hasn't beens aid on the last album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It's no mean feat to remain a commercially successful artist while taking
years to  make each album, touring once in a decade, and completely ignoring the
bland  parameters of modern pop. Kate's last album of new material was 1985's
Hounds Of  Love, though it was followed a year later by the swiftly-selling
compilation, The  Whole Story. 
</P>
<P>She avoided the traditional rock-biz route of slogging round pubs in a van,
instead  securing a songwriting deal with EMI when she was 16, with a little
help from Dave  Gilmour. She was able to work on her writing in private, away
from the public and  unknown to the press. 
</P>
<P>Her only tour took place in the spring of 1979, and it was so stressful and 
exhausting she hasn't repeated it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;By the end of that tour, I felt a terrific need to retreat as a
person, because I felt  that my sexuality, which in a way I hadn't really had a
chance to explore myself,  was being given to the world in a way which I found
impersonal. When I started in  this business, I felt very at home in my body. I
was a dancer, that was the areas I  explored. And it was very scary for me those
next few years, because whatever I  wore, whatever I did, people were putting
this incredible emphasis of sexuality on  me, which I didn't feel. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think I was a victim of the fact that I was a young woman who was
writing  music and the emphasis went on the fact that I was a young woman. There
were a  lot of things that didn't fit like I was very young, I was female,
people thought I was  attractive, and I had a very idealistic and positive
attitude at a time when negativity  and anarchy were hip. So I was coming in
from completely the wrong tangent. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I'd seen a lot of things I could have trodden a lot more carefully
in those early  days. But I was very young, and I didn't see them. I trusted
people. But all that  aside, and I did have a hard time, I think what I've
managed to achieve is worth all  that shit I went through.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World, the song, is some sort of statement of a new maturity and
 confidence. It's unashamedly erotic, but this time she's gone into the subject
with  her eyes wide open. &quot;I think I'm just starting to think of myself as
a woman, and to  actually feel quite nice about that,&quot; she explains. &quot;I
also feel I can express myself as a  woman without having this tremendous
pressure from the outside world, which I  felt - I felt I couldn't move. But I
feel really good now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There is a photo of Kate standing in a stairwell looking over the banister.
There  is also a separate review of the album - I will post that later. 
</P>
<P>Enjoy, Neil.
