<P>Date: Tue, 28 May 91 00:04:54 PDT <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald
Hill) <BR> Subject: More Canadian Interviews 1985
</P>
<P>88. Good Rockin' Tonight, Much Music, The New Music, Toronto Evening News, 
etc.: excerpts from interviews (all dating from the same day, in the same
Toronto  studios) conducted by Christopher Ward, Nan Devitt and Daniel Richler
in late  November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>These interviews have a strikingly better atmosphere than their U.S. 
counterparts, which had been conducted only a day or two before. Much of the 
credit for this must go to the excellent interviewing techniques of the Canadian
 hosts, particularly Mr. Ward and Mr. Richler. Both men had prepared well for
their  interviews and both show evident respect for their guest on camera. Kate
responds,  consequently, with greater frankness and fluidity than she had in any
other  interviews of the 1985 promotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above note by IED. Boy does Kate look good in
these  interviews! ] 
</P>
<P>[Interview 1: The MuchMusic Interview. - Running Up That Hill is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Running Up That Hill, from Kate Bush. And please welcome my guest, Kate
Bush.  Very nice to have you here. 
</P>
<P>K: It's a pleasure to be here! 
</P>
<P>I: Yes, indeed! Congratulations on the success of Hounds of Love. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you, it's fantastic! 
</P>
<P>I: It is going well isn't it? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes. 
</P>
<P>I: The UK is no surprise, but it looks like North America is finally falling
in line.  Are you happy about that? 
</P>
<P>K: I'm very happy. It's always great when people like your music. 
</P>
<P>I: You said that you anguished long over this record. Is that typical for
you, recording  wise? 
</P>
<P>K: I think so yes. I think, um, certainly since the third album it has been
like that. It  just seems to be a long process. You go into it to be that
involved and before you  know it's dragging you behind it, until it's finished.

</P>
<P>I: Is that partly result of having your own studio now? That you felt you
had to work  out the kinks in that situation and learn to work in your own
facility? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, I think it was the last album that made me realize I needed one
because I  was being so prohibited by the amount of money it was costing every
hour that I  thought it was actually being anti-productive to what I wanted to
do. We work  very experimentally and it takes time. So it really made sense to
get our own  studio together. 
</P>
<P>I: I understand that you moved to the country fairly recently. Is that part
of the  process of building a home studio as well? Did that all come part and
partial? 
</P>
<P>K: It did really. It was a kind of re-organization I wanted to do between
the last  album and this where I moved from the city to the country, we got the
studio  together, and I just took some time to get back in training. That kind
of thing. I  think I made some of my best decisions during that time. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you becoming more reclusive as a result? 
</P>
<P>K: I think I have extremes, where I'm very reclusive while I'm working and
then  totally non-reclusive when I come out to promote and say to people &quot;here's
the  album.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I: Would you consider yourself a social creature at the best of times? Do
you have a  community of musicians, aside from your family obviously and those
you work  with, that you would see regularly and party with? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes I think there's, again, two parts of me. One that's a very social
beast and the  other side of me is probably very quiet and likes to work alone,
and in fact can't  really work if there's more than a few people around. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you have special work habits that you subscribe to? You seem like a
very  disciplined artist, just judging by your work. Do you have a special place
you go to  work, a certain environment, and certain hours? Do you do that? 
</P>
<P>K: I think the studio has become that disciplined place that I can go to
now. It used  to be my music room, wherever I had the piano. And I think it's
helped me  tremendously to actually have an environment where I can go to work.
It just  makes it that much easier for me to concentrate. 
</P>
<P>I: And do you set hours that you go there? 
</P>
<P>K: Not actually set hours, it depends how I feel. But normally I'll go there
for a  certain amount each day, depending on how well the ideas are coming
through.  So it depends. 
</P>
<P>I: We mentioned the old videos and you said you would like to see Breathing.
What  was it about particularly about that one that you felt was a success? 
</P>
<P>K: I think it's one of the few that I've done that I can say that I'm quite
happy with  some of the things we did in it. It's one of those things. The way
you make a  video, quite often the song isn't lending itself to the kind of
visual ideas you'd  like it to. And with Breathing, I think it had such a strong
story that it was easier  for us to visualize something that we'd felt was
powerful. 
</P>
<P>I: The song sounds like it was built of visual ideas to begin with, to some
extent. 
</P>
<P>K: I think when I'm writing songs, I do have quite strong visual ideas, but
they're  not necessarily video visual ideas if you know what I mean... 
</P>
<P>I: Yes. 
</P>
<P>K: I think in order to get to a place, or to consider yourself in someone
else's  position, you try to imagine an environment. And I think in some ways
you think  quite visually about that. 
</P>
<P>I: Lets take a look at Breathing from Kate Bush on MuchMusic and we'll be
right  back. 
</P>
<P>[Breathing is played] 
</P>
<P>I: There you have Breathing from Kate Bush on MuchMusic and my guest, Kate 
Bush. Very nice to have you hear. You suffered a fate in the early goings of 
you're career of being somewhat of a pin-up girl in the British pop mags. [Kate 
laughs]. How did you deal with that? 
</P>
<P>K: I think what worried me was that it was going to stop people taking my
music  seriously. I've always found it very complimentary if people said that
they found  me attractive. And my worry is really that it would get in the way
of my music.  Its not that, um... I find that so much of a problem as...as if
people wouldn't  accept my music. But I don't think that that has been a
problem. I think people  do seem to accept my music for its sake. 
</P>
<P>I: And does your sexuality have a role in your music? 
</P>
<P>K: Well I think that's something I find very confusing because I think that
the  essence of all art is sensuality. And sexuality, I mean I don't suppose I 
understand it fully, but I always tend to think that that's something that's 
projected. And that sensuality is really were art is at. It's a much more subtle
 form of expression. 
</P>
<P>I: You have interesting theories. There was an interview that I saw that
Daniel  Richler for the New Music did last year, he was visiting in England, and
his show  is done out of this building as well. And there was a quote where you
said &quot;the  artist is like a magpie, pitting out little bits of gold, and
storing them away&quot; to use  later. What are you picking through these days? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] I think the whole process is like that, you're continually
looking for  lyrical ideas, musical inspirations, people that would be good to
work with, people  that you want to involve in your work. I think all the time
you have to keep  looking and listening because it's that accumulation of things
that all your ideas  and your work depends on. 
</P>
<P>I: What are you looking at and listening to these days? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, well at the moment I'm caught in the middle of a big promotional
trip... 
</P>
<P>I: Of course. 
</P>
<P>K: ...but it's interesting for me. I'm getting a great deal of feedback from
people  which is incredibly rewarding. And also I suppose one positive side of
it is it  makes you think about areas of yourself and your music that you
wouldn't do  unless people were asking you these questions. 
</P>
<P>I: So you don't have any current obsessions in terms of...oh film or music
or art that  you might pass on to us? 
</P>
<P>K: I think my current obsessions are perhaps films. Between the last album
and this  one I got very into our video machine at home and taping lots of films
off the  television. I think they've become very inspirational for me. And I
think perhaps  my video work is moving away from being theatrically and dance
oriented to  perhaps being more cinematically influenced. 
</P>
<P>I: We have the video for Sat In Your Lap, do you have a few thoughts on that
one to  pass along? 
</P>
<P>K: Um, well I think that's one of the fun videos that we did, where the song
is  about the search for knowledge. And um, I suppose we just wanted to have a
bit  of fun in this video and try to express that [makes funny voice] &quot;we're
looking  for that thing&quot;, yeah. [Laughs] 
</P>
<P>I: This is Kate Bush, Sat In Your Lap, on MuchMusic. 
</P>
<P>[Sat In Your Lap is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Christopher Ward on MuchMusic with my special guest, Kate Bush. And Kate
as  early as about 1980 you were experimenting with the Fairlight computer
musical  instrument. Has that changed the way you approach creating music? 
</P>
<P>K: Yes, very much so. I think it was one of the best thing to happen for me
along  side rhythm machines. Not only has it helped with the initial writing
process,  were I'm getting associations off the sounds straight away as I start
writing the  song, but also from an arrangement point of view, where if I want
strings or  brass on a track I can work out an arrangement on the fairlight with
that  particular sampled sound and then if want get the real musicians in to
redo it. 
</P>
<P>I: Yeah, well your use of it has become more and more extensive. But you
were  perhaps one of the first artists that I ever knew, along with perhaps
Peter  Gabriel, who used the Fairlight at all. 
</P>
<P>K: I was very lucky in that I was at the studio where they decided to
demonstrate  the machine at a very early stage. It had only been in the country
for a while and  they were just setting up the company. As soon as I saw it I
knew that I had to  have one, and it was going to become a very important part
of my work. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you an aggressive business person? We hear stories that on the first
album a  very young Kate Bush insisted Wuthering Heights be the first single,
against  some resistance. Is that true, and are you, in fact, very aggressive
about your  business? 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know if I'm aggressive about my business, but I do a lot of the
time feel  strongly about what I want or how I want to see it presented. It is
an expression  of me at some point and it seems wrong that as soon as it goes
out into the world  it should leave me and my expression behind. Wuthering
Heights I felt was a  much more interesting single then perhaps some that were
being suggested at  that time. And um, I just felt it was a good idea at the
time to hang [slurs words  ???- out with it ??]. I did feel strongly about it,
[makes cute Kate confused face],  yes. 
</P>
<P>I: It certainly paid off, number one record in the U.K. 
</P>
<P>K: It would seem so, yeah. 
</P>
<P>I: Do you rely on dreams a lot for inspiration for your songs? 
</P>
<P>K: It's strange, a few people have started asking me that question recently,
and I  would so no, that I can't actually think of any song that a dream has
directly  inspired. No. 
</P>
<P>I: Are you a keeper of a dream diary or something like that? 
</P>
<P>K: No I'm not, no. 
</P>
<P>I: I've experimented with that sort of thing and it's interesting -there's a
 surrealistic quality to some of your songs that might lead one to think that,
[Kate  makes polite expression] but not the case? 
</P>
<P>K: No, not consciously but... 
</P>
<P>I: Now I wanted to ask you about the second side of The Hounds Of Love LP -
it's a  conceptual piece called The Ninth Wave. And what led you to that concept
and  how did you go about developing it? 
</P>
<P>K: It's quite hard to pinpoint the initial inspiration, but I'm sure that it
came from,  um, a combination of war movies where people were, soldiers were,
either  thrown out of the ship or a plane into the sea. And that whole strength
of  imagery of water, of the sea, this enormous great power with this tiny
little  human being in it. And I suppose the whole parallel to things likes
sensory  depravation, where if you're in the water long enough, you know you
start, ah,  your mind starts traveling. So it gave me a vehicle to travel to
different places and  yet keep a theme. 
</P>
<P>I: Did you take yourself to an isolation tank or anything to achieve that
particular  sensation? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] No, it's something that I would certainly like to experience.
But I spent  a lot of time writing, particularly the lyrics, by water. I was
standing by the sea or  by lakes. So a lot of the time there was water stimulus.

</P>
<P>I: We have your brand new video for Cloudbusting, also from Hounds of Love.
And,  ah, I read an article in Number One magazine and they said something very 
unusual happened during the shooting of it. Is that all rumors? 
</P>
<P>K: [Laughs] Yes, I can't think of anything! 
</P>
<P>I: They talked about ghosts and all sorts of things, so... 
</P>
<P>K: Did they? 
</P>
<P>I: Do you want to straightened out any of those rumors for us? 
</P>
<P>K: Well as far as I know there were no ghosts present, but there were lots
of human  beings. And a particularly good actor called Donald Sutherland. 
</P>
<P> I: Of course, a well known Canadian actor as well. 
</P>
<P>K: Absolutely, yes. 
</P>
<P>I: So tell us about the video, what were you trying to accomplish? K: I
really wanted  it to be a short piece of film. I didn't want it to be seen as a
promotional clip or  even a video, but as a film. And part of that idea was
having an actor, hopefully a  great actor, that would play the part of the
father, and myself playing the part of  the young boy. And the song was inspired
a book that's all about a very special  relationship between the guy that wrote
the book, as a child and his father. His  father was a very respected
psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and had lots of theories on  life energy, and also
had this machine called a cloudbuster that could make it  rain. And together
they'd go out into the dry desert and make it rain and this  was a very magical
moment for the child. 
</P>
<P>K: It's called A Book Of Dreams, and the man that wrote it is called Peter
Reich.  And unfortunately the peak of the book is that his fathers arrested, his
beliefs  were considered outrageous, people afraid of things that they didn't
know -  especially at that time. And it was very, very hard for the child to
cope without  his father. And in some ways the connection with rain, for him
every time it rains  he thinks of his father, so its a positive of him coping
without him. 
</P>
<P>I: Kate thank you very much for joining us today, it's really a pleasure to
meet you.  And I know that there are fans across this country who love you
dearly and  would very much like to see you perform here, so we hope that you
will be able  to come back to North America and... 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: ...we'll see you on stage. I think I have a present somewhere. Yes here
it is. [Kate  laughs, he hands here a MuchMusic shirt]. A little memento to take
with you. 
</P>
<P>K: [Makes funny Kate voice] For me??? 
</P>
<P>I: For you!!! Please wear it in good health. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. Really nice to meet you. 
</P>
<P>I: Thanks very much Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>K: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I: And here we have the brand new video for Cloudbusting on MuchMusic. 
</P>
<P>K: [Looks again at shirt] Oh...! 
</P>
