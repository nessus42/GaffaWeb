<P>Date: Thu, 25 Jan 90 13:23:31 PST <BR> From: portuesi%tweezers.esd@sgi.com
<BR> Subject: The VH-1 interview Jan. 1990?
</P>
<P>Sorry I took so long to post the interview. I finished transcribing it this
weekend,  though technical problems at work have prevented me from moving it off
a floppy  disk and onto to my workstation. The transcription is a very faithful
rendition of  what she said, with only the &quot;uh's&quot; and a few of the &quot;you
know's&quot; edited out. The  punctuation is done largely to my own tastes, so
flame me if you think it reads badly.  I did puncutate the part where she talked
about Wilhelm Reich very carefully. It  seemed to me that she hesitated, that
she didn't want to get into the full story, and  gave a shortened version
without really saying what she felt about Reich and his  work. 
</P>
<P>For those who have not seen the special, the interviewer and questions are
never  shown -- we are shown only Kate's responses to the questions. So the
whole show  has the feel of a monologue, where Kate changes the subject on a
regular basis. The  show generally denoted each change of subject with an
excerpt from one of her  videos, or from some footage they shot of Kate walking
through the park in the  autumn, leaves sweeping at her feet, black cape blowing
in the breeze.

<P> The VH-1 Interview 
</P>
<P>I think this album for me, unlike the last album, say, `Hounds of Love,'
where I  saw that as two sides -- one side being conceptual --this album is very
much like  short stories for me. Ten short stories that are just saying
something different in each  one and it was a bit like trying to paint the
pictures accordingly. Each song has a  different personality and so they each a
need little bit of something here, a little bit  of that there -- just like
people, you know, some people you can't walk up to  because you know they're a
bit edgy first thing in the morning. So you have to  come up sideways to them,
you know, and it's kind of like how the songs are too.  They have their own
little personalities, and if it doesn't want you to do it, it won't  let you. 
</P>
<P>&lt;&quot;Never be Mine&quot; is played while Kate walks through the park&gt;

</P>
<P>I do think it's a very big self-therapy for me now. The more my work coming 
out, and the more I think it's actually almost a process for me to try and heal 
myself, have a look at myself. 
</P>
<P>I feel this is probably my most female album as well, in that I've explored
female  energies in myself as a writer, producer, that before I've really just
done what I've  seen all the other guys do, because really everything I've
learned in the music  industry about making records has been from them. And it
occurred to me more in  hindsight that at the time that a lot of what I was
doing was very male influenced,  and I just wanted to try and find a female
energy for myself. Not that there's  anything negative about male energy in
music because it's great you know. I was  just looking for a female approach, I
guess. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpts from &quot;The Sensual World&quot;&gt; 
</P>
<P>We wanted to make the video for `The Sensual World' as simple as possible in
 that so many videos now are overloaded with effects, big sets, they look
expensive.  So what we wanted to do was just keep it in one set, one environment
and depict  what for me the song `Sensual World' is about, which is the
sensuality of this  planet, the weather, the elemental changes, being able to
reach out and touch, the  sound of the wind, all of these wonderful things that
we are surrounded by. 
</P>
<P>&lt;more TSW excerpts&gt; 
</P>
<P>I think nature is very important to me as an inspiration. It's very
important for  me to be able to just look at intense pieces of landscape and
throughout history  people have always gained inspiration from the sea, from
mountains, from the sky.  It's what we sort of strive for, isn't it? You know,
nature is perfect. God made the  world in absolute perfection and anything that
a human being does can never really  be perfect. 
</P>
<P>&lt;&quot;Reaching Out&quot; played while Kate walks the countryside&gt; 
</P>
<P>Discovery of music personally for me came when one day my father took me
into  the &lt;kennel?&gt; and showed me the scale of C on the keyboard. And I
couldn't believe  that this was how this worked, that it was so logical, that
there was actually a plan to  the keyboard that was so easy to see, that was
like playing one finger on the notes  and then singing that tune. And then
gradually I got to to understand about chords,  and once I hit chords that was
really it, you know. This was the most exciting thing  in my life, the chord. 
</P>
<P>My family is very musical, and as long as I can remember there was always
music  playing in the house. 
</P>
<P>It surprises me even now when I look back at the amount of time that I was 
putting in, that as you say I was dedicated. And I would think it was
extraordinary  looking back on it now if it wasn't for the fact that at the time
I just felt so strongly  that this was what I had to do. Its like it almost felt
like a mission to me, that this  was why I was herem this was what I had to do
-- I had to make an album. And  that was, that was it I didn't want to be
famousm I didn't want to make lots of  money, I didn't want to successful, but I
desperately wanted to make an album that  I hoped people would want to hear. So
all my energy was going into that. Even the  dancing was tied in really with
just trying to allow myself to grow a bit, to be able to  express myself. And I
also think if I hadn't put in those two years of dance training,  I don't think
I could have coped with anything after that point. Because the  discipline and
the humility of it taught me was something I think I've so gained a  tremendous
amount from. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>Well I actually left school, and I was training as a dancer. I kind of
worked out a  routine for my day, which would be get up in the morning, I'd
practice scales  without my piano, go out and dance and in the evening I'd come
back and play the  piano all night. And I sure remember, well, the summer of 76
which was really hot  here. We had such hot weather, I had all the windows open.
And I'd just used to  write until you know four in the morning, and I got a
letter of complaint from a  neighbor who was basically saying `Shuuut Uuuup!'
cause they had to get up at like  five in the morning. They did shift work and
my voice had been carried the whole  length of the street I think, and they
weren't too appreciative. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>Well, the video we made for `Wuthering Heights' was probably amongst the 
first ever made, certainly here in this country in terms of a video, and I was
very  influenced at that time still by Lindsay Kemp. So it was very much the
dance  influence that I was expressing. So it was really working out
choreography that just  looked interesting, that would kind of create a persona
of Cathy. 
</P>
<P>Well, I'm not actually a big Emily Bronte fan. A lot of people think I am,
they  presume I am. It just goes with this whole preconception they have of me
as a sort of  big Bronte fan, a Tolkien fan, the pre-Raphaelite lady. Which I
think is actually a  very big misconception. For me, `Wuthering Heights' is the
ultimate love story. You  just cannot get beyond the passion that they cover
there. You know, its a love affair  that goes beyond death -- they will not be
stopped by nature's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt of &quot;Wow&quot; from Hammersmith Odeon concert is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>I only actually toured once ten years ago -- '79 -- and we toured England
and  Europe. I had never done anything like that before. I'm not a performer,
I'm not  someone who's grown up playing around clubs or pubs and then becomes a 
recording artist. I'm someone who from a young age wrote songs, and then 
gradually learned to sing, and then gradually there I was in the studio and
then...  It's all sort of an unfolding process for me. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt of &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot; from Hammersmith is played&gt;

</P>
<P>We wanted to do something special, and I guess really because of my
influences  from people like Lindsay Kemp we wanted to make it kind of
theatrical. And so it  would incorporate lots of different things, like dance,
and we had a magician, and we  had some poetry and just all different elements
thrown together and it had a kind of  a circus feel. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt of &quot;Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake&quot; from
Hammersmith is  played&gt; 
</P>
<P>In terms of what we were doing then it was very experimental. I mean apart 
from musicals, or opera production, it was kind of unheard of to involve so many
 elements. 
</P>
<P>What I needed was a microphone that I didn't have to hold, because we wanted
 to do dance that involved two other dancers so I could be lifted and we could
run  across the stage, and holding a microphone was very inhibiting. So the
sound guy  that we had for the tour, I said to him `I want you to invent a
microphone for me  that I don't have to carry'. So he basically invented the
radio mikes that you see  now, that he made it out of a coat hanger. So he got
an old coat hanger and kind of  bent it into shape here, and then had this piece
that came round here, that the  microphone was then put on so it was just in
front of the mouth. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>For me, what's important is writing songs and it's just incredible how many 
things spill out of that. How the lyrics, being a singer, and then really by
making  videos it becomes an extension again of the song. And I suppose I've
always been  interested in the visual side of things. I've always loved film,
and it just seemed like  a natural progression for me to get more and more
involved in what I did musically  and visually. Because I made the first album,
and then I made the videos that went  with it. so these are things that I've
been doing for years now, and each time I've  done them I've become a bit more
involved. 
</P>
<P>I suppose my favorite one is when it's a story, though, because then it's
like  making a film. 
</P>
<P>`Cloudbusting' is about Wilhelm Reich, who...was...kind of remembered for 
work he did on `orgone energy' and he had this thing called a cloudbuster, which
 was all tied in with orgone energy, but...he could make it rain. 
</P>
<P>When we were thinking about someone to play the part of the father, we just 
sort of instantly came up with Donald Sutherland, and everyone laughed, because 
it's like, you know, he's one of the greatest actors in the world, really, and
we  jokingly thought `yeah, yeah wouldn't it be great'. 
</P>
<P>So we did actually approach his agent, who immediately said no, he couldn't 
because he's just too busy. But a friend of ours knew a friend of his, who asked
 him, and he gave us three days of his time in between shooting two other films.
And  I still can't believe he did it. It was a wonderful thing for him to do,
give us that  time. Made it a very, very special thing for me. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from &quot;Big Sky&quot;&gt; 
</P>
<P>Well, it's very difficult making videos. Obviously you want to try and do 
something different. Everyone is making videos -- there's competition out there
like  probably nothing else. 
</P>
<P>&lt;cut to set of &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;&gt; 
</P>
<P>Tim is kind of sitting throughout the song, waiting for his girlfriend or
whoever  who is in the hospital. So most of the video is very distressed. You
know he's in a  room, distressed state and he sort of looks up, and then light
goes away from the  window, this spot comes down. So he's just sitting in this
spot and he's like he's  suddenly conjuring up these memories. And then I sort
step in with a raincoat and  put it around his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; video&gt; 
</P>
<P>When I'm directing them I would storyboard them, and then get them drawn up 
professionally so that other people can understand. Cause otherwise it's like
`ha ha  ha, what's that meant to be,' you know, `that's not meant to be me, that
looks like  a blob'. And also, just getting camera moves and that across, on a
professionally  drawn storyboard. Everyone can relate to an image -- its such a
good way of getting  people to understand what you really mean. 
</P>
<P>I don't think I ever wanted to become an actress. Acting is something that
I've  never had a passion for, or an ambition for. Really, everything so far has
stemmed  from songwriting for me. 
</P>
<P>One of my favorite people from the movies was Alfred Hitchcock, because for 
me the guy was a genius. He was completely revolutionary, he was very witty, but
 witty in a very `out there' sense, and I still think people are learning about
the film  industry from him every time they watch one of his films. Beautiful --
it's like the  guy had a camera for a pair of eyes. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from TWW is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>All right, I wouldn't like to sit here and say that feel like I'm emulating 
Hitchcock, but definitely he's a tremendous influence on me whenever I'm making 
a video. You know, he's really the ultimate reference point. 
</P>
<P>&lt;excerpt from LAA is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>Well `Love and Anger', of all the songs on the album, is really the one I
know  the least about. I don't really know what it's about --it's had so many
different  faces. But it was one of the first songs to be written, and one of
the last songs to be  finished. And I think all the songs on this album are
about relationships. 
</P>
<P>&lt;more of LAA is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>I don't think i'm politically minded at all. Politics are something that --
they're  just not a part of me. I don't understand what it is, I don't like what
I see in  politics. I don't see politics doing any good for people, really. It
seems a very  intellectual preoccupation, you know, it's a kind of action, isn't
it, that does things  for people. I think I'm an emotionally based person, and
when political issues reach  me emotionally, which of course is how most of use
feel the hollowed end of them,  that would then move me to write a song or
something. But I wouldn't ever sit and  write about politics -- it's not a part
of me. 
</P>
<P>I suppose if I had to name the main things that are very very good triggers
for  ideas, it would be books, films, and conversation. And that just about
covers it really,  for me. The odd walk in the park?
