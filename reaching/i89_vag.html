<BR> Subject: &quot;Kate Bush and her women&quot; in Vagant by Johann Grip 
</P>
<P>This article was recently published in the Norwegian magazine &quot;Vagant&quot;.
 &quot;Vagant&quot; is an arty magazine with, I would guess, a very small
circulation. I am  Norwegian, the article was written in Swedish and I have
translated it to English.  The translation is problaby pretty horrible, but I
think it is might be readable. I  think it's an interesting article. 
</P>
<P>&quot;this house is full of M-M-MADNESS&quot; 
</P>
<P>An article about Kate Bush and her women 
</P>
<P>by Johann Grip 
</P>
<P>To begin with a (rhetorical?) question: In our culture, is there a
specifically  female literary tradition that differs from a typically male,
patriarchal tradition? 
</P>
<P>If there is, then what does it look like, and what would this have to do
with Kate  Bush? 
</P>
<P>According to the authors of the book &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot;
(Sandra M.  Gilbert and Susan Gaber, New Haven/London 1979) the first question
has to be  answered affirmative. Starting from the 19. century authors Jane
Austen, Charlotte  Bronte and the later Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf and
Sylvia Plath, they can  trace a distinctly feminine literary tradition with &quot;pictures
of entrapment and escape,  fantasies of mad &quot;twins&quot; that play the
roles of anti-social surrogates for an unselfish  I, metaphors for physical pain
in frozen landscapes and a furious inner - these  patterns are recurring
throughout this tradition, together with manic descriptions of  illnesses as
anorexia, agoraphobia and claustrophobia&quot; (s.xi). 
</P>
<P>And why should just female authors be haunted by these metaphors and 
fantasies? According to the same book: &quot;Confined in an overwhelmingly 
male-dominated social architecture, these literary women were trapped in the 
literary constructions that Gertrude Stein called 'patriarchal poetry'&quot;
(s.xi). 
</P>
<P>A literary woman in the 19. century doesn't only live in a house owned and
built  by men, &quot;she was also hindered and enclosed by the Palaces of Art
and Houses of  Fiction that male writers authored.&quot; 
</P>
<P>With these women the serious and difficult attempts to redefine the womans 
place in art, fiction and society started. 
</P>
<P>Something this specifically female literary tradition had to do was to
examine the  ruling metophors that has described an excluding, wholly male
process of creation,  in which the women has been tied up in either angelic or
monstrous shapes. One is  tempted to cite a few lines by Norman O. Brown as an
example of this picture of  women: &quot;Poetry, this sexual act. Sexuality is
poetry. The women is our creation or  Pygmalions statue. The women is poetry;
(Petraca's) Laura is in fact poetry.&quot; (The  Madw., p 13). 
</P>
<P>Using this feminist theory, I will take a walk through Kate Bush's
landscapes and  try to show how such an investigation of traditional
(patriarchal) metaphors and  attempts to break free of them is staged in a
excellent fashion. 
</P>
<P>The journey starts on the first record Kate Bush produced on her own, &quot;The
 Dreaming&quot; (-82), on the last track of the album, &quot;Get Out of My
House.&quot; 
</P>
<P> THE HOUSE OF FICTION 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; the listener/reader finds &quot;pictures
of imprisonment  and escape.&quot; Here we meet the Woman's ambigous attempt to
lock herself in her  own house and at the same time trying to lock the Man, the
male, outside. The Man  is drawn to, and controls, the outside world. 
</P>
<P>&quot;When you let the door was (slamming) <BR>  You paused in the doorway 
<BR>  As though a thought stole you away  <BR>  I watch the world pull you
away&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Woman has acquired this metaphorical house and key. She is full of  &quot;anxiety&quot;
over this crime to the patriarchal tradition. She locks the door. However,  she
has to pay dearly for this victory. She has stepped into her own trap. She has
her  own house, but she has lost the world: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm barred and bolted.. and I  <BR>  Won't letcha in&quot; 
</P>
<P>Has the woman in &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; really conquered her own
woolfian  house, from which she can develop her distinctly feminine universe?
No, the scenario  is a bit more complicated than that: 
</P>
<P>&quot;This house is as old as I am  <BR>  This house knows all I have done&quot;
 <BR>  This house, that becomes a picture of the woman herself, is  <BR>  &quot;(This
house is) full of m-m-m-my mess  <BR>  This house is full of m-m-mistakes 
<BR>  This house is full of m-m-madness&quot; 
</P>
<P>It is a house that still is &quot;built&quot; by men, and as architects they
have defined the  house's/the Woman's shape and being. Against this monstrous
binding the Woman  has to oppose by dressing up in the masculine metaphor of
aggression: 
</P>
<P>&quot;This house is full of, full of, full of, full of fight&quot; 
</P>
<P>A fight both inside the Womans house and with the Man from the outside, who 
acts as the seductive Devil's Advocate of the tradition, and who tries to force
his way  in into her fictive house with promises and threats: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Woman let me in  <BR>  Let me bring in the momories  <BR>  Woman let
me in  <BR>  Let me bring in the Devil dreams&quot;  <BR>  The attemps to
acquire the Womans fictitious house seems to fail:  <BR>  &quot;I will not let
you in  <BR>  Don't you bring back the reveries  <BR>  I turn into a bird 
<BR>  Carry further that the word is heard&quot; 
</P>
<P>But don't be fooled. The Womans attempt to escape as a bird is just going to
 bring her out into a world controlled by men. And this romantic metaphor, the
bird,  does not have sufficient force. It's song does not have the force to
resist the Man.  The Temptor suggests this when he in the shape of air tries to
bind the bird/the  Woman with a (cold) kiss, the binding touch of love: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I turn into the wind  <BR>  I blow you a cold kiss  <BR>  Stronger
than the song's hit&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yet the Woman resists in an ironic manner. She decides to enter a strange 
compromise: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I will not let you in  <BR>  I face toward the wind  <BR>  I change
into the mule  <BR>  'Hee-haw'  <BR>  'Hee-haw'&quot; 
</P>
<P>Into a mule. Both the Man and the Woman has in fact been transformed into
this  mixture of different elements. This would suggest that no-one has won,
that none of  them has managed to kill the other, because &quot;As we will show,
the images of  'angel' and 'monster' have been so everpresent in the male
litterature that these  images have also penetrated women's writing to such a
degree that women definitly  have 'murdered' one or the other figure&quot; (p.
17). 
</P>
<P> &quot;IS THERE SO MUCH HATE FOR THE ONES WE LOVE&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;What concerns all the nonsense that Henry and Harry were talking
about, the  necessetiy of &quot;I am God&quot; to be able to create (I assume
they mean &quot;I am God, I am  not a woman&quot;) - this &quot;I am God&quot;,
that mokes the creation to an act of loneliness and  pride, this picture of God
that creates heaven, earth and sea, this is the picture that  has confused
women.&quot; (Madw., Anais Nin, p. 3). 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Running up that Hill/Deal with God,&quot; the first song on Kate
Bush's latest  record &quot;Hounds of Love/The Ninth Wave&quot; (-85), we meet a
scenario not unlike the  one proposed by Anais Nin. We here meet the Woman who
would, very much, like  to arrange a swap with God or somebody in a similar
position: 
</P>
<P>&quot;And if I only could  <BR>  I'd make a deal with God  <BR>  And I'd
get him to swap our places&quot; 
</P>
<P>A swap like that would make the woman able to control the outer world, from 
which she locked herself in in &quot;Get Out of My House.&quot; And she would no
longer run  away from something, escape, she would run with aim, with direction.

</P>
<P>&quot;Be running up that road  <BR>  Be running up that hill  <BR>  Be
running up that building&quot; 
</P>
<P>This song, that I will refrain from exploring in greater depth due to the
length of  this article, describes a Woman, &quot;free&quot; from &quot;anxiety&quot;.

</P>
<P>In the next song, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; we meet this Woman's direct
opposite, the  mirror image, let us call her an innocent Snow White. The opening
line of the song  is not written on the lyric sheet. It says &quot;Symmetry!
It's coming,&quot; and I think it  suggests an attempt to &quot;repair&quot; the
previous song's - in the patriarch's eyes -  dangerous wishes. 
</P>
<P>Here we meet Snow White, as we have chosen to call her, as an innocent
child,  filled with fear as to what the outer world (dominated by men) has to
offer: 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I was a child  <BR>  Running in the night  <BR>  Afraid of what
might be  <BR>  Hiding in the dark  <BR>  Hiding in the street&quot; 
</P>
<P>Then the text returns to the present where we meet the Woman, confused by 
what Anais Nin called &quot;this image of God as lone creator of heaven, earth
and sea,  this is the picture that has confused the woman.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always been a coward  <BR>  And I don't know what's good for me&quot;

</P>
<P>This Woman is chased by the Hounds of Love, a repressive love that strives
to  keep her down by pointing out that her will is not independant. By doing
this the  woman, in my eyes, is transformed into a &quot;Monkey of the Working
Class,&quot; or, I  should say, into a different kind of bird than we are going
to meet later - not into  &quot;this Blackbird&quot; - but into a parrot. The
Woman, who, in &quot;Running up that Hill&quot;,  wanted to swap places, puts
herself back into &quot;her proper place&quot;. By making the  Woman confused,
the Hounds of Love make her repent; she'll feel better if she  remains in her
prescribed role: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always been a coward  <BR>  And never knows what's good for me 
<BR>  Here I go - Don't let me go - Hold me down...&quot; 
</P>
<P>And continues: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know what I really need  <BR>  Do you know what I really need 
<BR>  I need love, love, love, love...&quot; 
</P>
<P>In these two songs the listener/reader has been presented with both (Song 1)
a  kind of theme for development or dramatization of the Woman who must acquire 
the male (and phallic) pen in order to not (Song 2) continue to be a hunted
victim, a  Snow White fleeing through shadows, forests and streets. Or put in
another way:  &quot;Patriarchal texts have traditionally suggested that every
angelic, unselfish Snow  White must be hunted, if not haunted, by an evil and
selfish stepmother; for every  glowing portrait of humble women trapped in
family life, there exists an equally  important negative picture that
encorporates the blasphemous devilishness that  William Blake called 'The female
will'&quot; (p. 28). 
</P>
<P>But as the quote indicates, every Snow White has to have an opposite, a
negative  mirror image. We get a glimpse of her in the fourth song, &quot;Mother
Stands for  Comfort.&quot; We meet the child that has - in her own opinion -
done somehing that is  illegal. The Mother knows this, but keeps silent: 
</P>
<P>&quot;She knows that I've been doing something wrong  <BR>  But she won't
say anything&quot;  <BR>  ...  <BR>  &quot;Mother stands for comfort  <BR> 
Mother will hide the murderer&quot; 
</P>
<P>This fits the child well as the mother lets the child live out its monstrous
 aggressiveness (the child as murderer), the opposite of the harmless Snow
White.  Still, the child is bothered by this situation, because the
aggressiveness has come to  her from the outside, it has not been created by
herself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It breaks the cage, fear escapes and take possesion  <BR>  Just like
a crowd rioting inside&quot;  <BR>  &quot;It&quot; makes her do things:  <BR> 
&quot;Make me do this, make me do that, make me do this  <BR>  Make me do that&quot;

</P>
<P>Is she the hunted or is she the hunter? In the mothers eyes she is hunted,
not a  hunter, and here we might see a thematic conflict. The mother, the very
sign of  &quot;comfort&quot;, chooses to see her daughter as an innocent victim,
an unselfish Snow  White. The child sees herself as someone who has taken on the
image of a very  young stepmother and acted out a symbolic murder. The murder
can be interpreted  both as a murder of Snow White and as an acquisition of the
male pen. 
</P>
<P>Is this an elegant dramatization, from the Woman who wants to &quot;make a
deal  with God&quot;, to a fully developed &quot;son&quot;, a Woman who must
accept and enter the male  world on these terms, by becoming a man? With the
last song of &quot;The Hounds of  Love&quot;, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, with
it's music filled with victory, one is tempted to answer  &quot;yes&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is directed towards a father figure, Daddy, as
opposed to the last  songs Mother/Mum-figure. The father represents something
ambigous the same  way the mother does. Kate Bush here uses an image of rain for
Daddy: 
</P>
<P>&quot;You're making rain  <BR>  and you're just in reach  <BR>  when you
and sleep escapes me&quot; 
</P>
<P>She has used this image in &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; from &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;This house is as old as I am  <BR>  This house knows all I have done 
<BR>  They come with all their weather hanging  <BR>  around them&quot; 
</P>
<P>This rainmaker as equated with a luminous yo-yo. What made the yo-yo unique 
- the fact that if was luminous - was also what made it dangerous. Therefore it
had  to be buried, hid away, let us call it &quot;repressed&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You're like my yo-yo  <BR>  that glowed in the dark  <BR>  what made
it special  <BR>  made it dangerous  <BR>  so I bury it and forget&quot; 
</P>
<P>The rainmaker has this luminous ability, he is a sort of god on earth with
creative  superiority. This makes him dangerous. Why? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Everytime it rains  <BR>  you're here in my head  <BR>  Like the sun
coming out&quot; 
</P>
<P>This makes the cycle of nature, which God created - this image of male
creativity  - defined, every time, as a male act. And it is this luminous symbol
of manhood that  has to be buried if the Female is not to remain a dominated
culture. Or it has to be  sublimated, posessed and become a natural part of her.
It seems as if this is what  happens - or what is at stake - in &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot;
described as the Womans change  into the Rainmakers son. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oooh, I just know that something good is going to happen  <BR>  And I
don't know when  <BR>  But just saying it could even make it happen&quot; 
</P>
<P>The song ends with this symbolic transformation: &quot;Oh, God, Daddy - I
won't  forget 
</P>
<P>Your son's coming out&quot; 
</P>
<P>In the second part of this record, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, which is an
allusion to  Tennyson's &quot;The Coming of Arthur&quot;, we meet a somewhat
different thematization  of this situation than we have encountered earlier.
However, here it is not the  acquisition or the destruction of this &quot;I am
God&quot; as symbol of creativity that is  focused on. Instead we meet the
exploration of female motives that one could call  The Mirror Motive, The
Painful Discovery that The Other Woman, The Monster or  The Mad Woman in the
Attic, in fact is the Woman herself. 
</P>
<P>Let me start with he closing lines of the first song, &quot;And dream of
Sheep,&quot; where  the journey starts when &quot;They&quot; say that they are
going to bring the Woman (that has  acquired the light in &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;)
home: 
</P>
<P>&quot;And they say they take me home.  <BR>  Like poppies, heavy with seed.
 <BR>  They take me deeper and deeper.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This &quot;home&quot; soon reveals itself as a gallery of images of women
that the Woman  has earlier been bound to. In &quot;Under Ice&quot; we are
presented with the Mirror Image  and the Other Woman. The woman above the ice is
skating and enjoys the speed and  the control. The the picture is soon changed:

</P>
<P>&quot;In the ice, splitting, splitting sounds  <BR>  Silver heels,
spitting, spitting snow&quot; 
</P>
<P>Something is moving, trapped under the ice. One is tempted to equate the ice
to a  mirror. There is something that's trying to break free, but it doesn't
seem to  manage it. In one - frozen - moment the skater painfully realizes that
this  dangerous something that is trying to get out, is herself, trapped behind
this scarred  ice-mirror. 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Waking the Witch,&quot; a song with Faustian shape, with the
witchtrial as theme  - throwing the witch into the water to see if she floats -
we meet a scene where the  witch is going to confess her sins to a Priestly
figure. &quot;Under&quot; this scene we can also  hear another voice, the
trapped bird we almost met in &quot;Get Out of My House,&quot; but  that changed
into a mule. One of the reasons is explained here. The bird, now a  &quot;Blackbird&quot;,
is described as tied, trapped. 
</P>
<P>&quot;(Help this blackbird, there's a stone round my leg)&quot; 
</P>
<P>Neither this metaphor or the witch-metaphor fits this Woman who wants to see
 her &quot;real&quot; mirror image. Both the witch and the blackbird is in the
domain of the  water which is the domain of the patriarchy. Something that is
expressed in the line  &quot;I am responsible for your actions,&quot; which is
said by the Priest, a hellish figure in  &quot;Waking the Witch.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One could carry on, dig deeper in. And I will, but I will only sketch it
out, as I  have already written too much. In &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;
we meet the  Invisible Woman in &quot;her fathers house,&quot; where she is
reduced to nothingness, where  she comes and goes like a ghost. The invisibility
does, however, give her one  advantage. She can objectify Him, explore Him and
at least have her invisibility and  freedom of motion to herself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You didn't hear me come in  <BR>  	 You won't hear me leaving&quot; 
</P>
<P>One should say more. But that will have to do, even though we haven't been 
introduced to the old woman, the Fortune Teller in &quot;Jig of Life&quot; or
the Woman in  &quot;Hello Earth&quot; that has replaced God and is controlling
the world for a while, or the  Woman in &quot;The Morning Fog&quot; who is
reborn, but really just &quot;repairs&quot; everything she  has done when she
conquered &quot;the light,&quot; how she becomes a nice girl again and fills 
the role as an all-loving mother: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'll tell my mother  <BR>  I'll tell my father  <BR>  I'll tell my
loved one  <BR>  I'll tell my brothers  <BR>  How much I love them&quot; 
</P>
<P>You'll have to look yourselves. What is left is simply a classical summation
of  what is caught in the article's mirrorframe: &quot;And when self-concieving
women from  Anne Finch to Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson stepped out of the
glass coffin of  male-authorized text, when they burst out of the queen's
mirror, the old dance of  death turned into a dance of triumph, a dance of
authority.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, could anybody out there understand my English? I won't make any 
comments on the article, as this is much too long already. Just one thing: The 
opening line to &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; should probably be &quot;It's in the
trees! It's coming!&quot;  Well, that's it.
