<P>This is a transcription of the Kate Bush interview aired on
Dallas/Fort-Worth's  KDGE (94.5 FM) radio station on 1/7/90, 7 - 7:45 pm. It is
reproduced here with the  kind permission of KDGE's DJ George Gimarc. 
</P>
<P>Thanks to George for conducting such a wonderful interview. Special thanks
to  Darryl Cate for his help with the transcription.

</P>
<P>GG: George Gimarc here and joining us... Kate Bush. Hello Kate. 
</P>
<P>KT: Hi George. 
</P>
<P>GG: Its great to have you on the air with us. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well thank you, its very kind of you to ask me. 
</P>
<P>GG: Well you've got a fabulous new album out. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well I'm pleased. 
</P>
<P>GG: A very emotional album, as relationships can be I suppose. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well let's hope so. 
</P>
<P>GG: It seems to have that common thread throughout it - relationships. 
</P>
<P>KT: Yes, I think so. I think maybe most of my songs are about relationships,
and  always have been. It's just what I find very fascinating. 
</P>
<P>GG: Your critics might say that because you were discovered and signed so
young  that you never really had to deal with real life so that you kind of have
a different  view of things. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well I think you know, I wasn't famous that young. It wasn't like I was
a child  prodigy. But I guess you know everyone has to go into life in their own
way and  we all seem to have paths (?) chosen for us somehow don't we, that we
don't  necessarily have that much control over. 
</P>
<P>GG: Ya. 
</P>
<P>KT: So I've just been doing my life the way I do it (laughs). 
</P>
<P>GG: You also tend to lead what some people would say would be a rather
secretive  life. For between albums nobody sees you much and I mean people like
to have  their rock icons, their pop idols, out visible and gossip about them.
But you seem  to be a bit of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>KT: I am not a secretive person, but I am not a public person and for me
what I feel  is that my work is to go out to the world, but not me as a person.
I am not a great  personality, I don't want to be a TV personality. I am a song
writer, I am a  singer, and I want my music to go out to the world and that's
what I want to talk  to people about is my music. 
</P>
<P>GG: Well let's get straight into it then. 
</P>
<P>KT: (laughs) 
</P>
<P>GG: The Sensual World, top track of the album. I gotta think if there was
ever a  video for this that it would never get shown on TV. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well there is actually a video already made and it's been shown quite a
lot on  TV. 
</P>
<P>GG: Has it ? 
</P>
<P>KT: Yes. 
</P>
<P>GG: What's it basically, what happens in the video ? 
</P>
<P>KT: Well its really conveying what I feel about The Sensual World, which is
that its  an incredible planet that we live in. It has tremendous sensuality,
the texture and  the colours of everything that nature supplies is incredibly
beautiful, and the song  is about a character Molly Bloom stepping out of a book
into the real world. So its  the idea of how someone who's been living in a
black and white two-D world is  so struck by the beauty of our real world and in
the video its really like one long  journey through a wood with the elemental
changes of the weather and the day  and the night, really just celebrating the
world that we live in. 
</P>
<P>	&lt; The Sensual World is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>GG: Its a shame you couldn't quote straight from Ulysses but its almost
become  more than that. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well thank you, that very nice. I mean obviously it was very
disappointing for  me that I couldn't use the original piece and I did approach
for permission to use  the words, but I was refused. So I had to actually rework
it and I am glad to see  that you think in some ways it might have, you know,
changed the song into  something else because that's what I feel. I feel that
actually the lack of  cooperation has turned the song into something else which
is a positive thing. 
</P>
<P>GG: Its an incredible song, The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>GG: There's other elements on the album, that you know, when you put it on
it just  kinda swirls around your head and you just gotta kinda wonder about
this.  You've got... 
</P>
<P>KT: (laughs) What do you want ? 
</P>
<P>GG: Well, you've got like the Celtic elements in the music, then you've
brought in  Trio Bulgarka and who would've thought the two would fit together.
But you've  pieced them together and it works in a totally new level. 
</P>
<P>KT: (laughs) Well I'm so glad you think it works because obviously a lot of
what I  do is very experimental and its always a bit scary because you are never
sure if its  gonna work and when I was working with The Trio their music is so
beautiful, I  didn't want to spoil what they did in any way or belittle it by
bringing it into  contemporary music. So I am really pleased to hear, you know,
when people say  that they think it works. That's a great reward for me, and for
them. 
</P>
<P>GG: How did you find them ? 
</P>
<P>KT: Well, I was very lucky. About three years ago my brother Paddy, who has 
always been into ethnic music and collected instruments from all around the 
world had got hold of this tape of The Trio and when I heard it I was devastated
 and I kind of listened to it for a long time before I thought wouldn't it be
nice if  I could work with them maybe on the next album and a friend of ours
called Joe  Boyd who releases their records in London put us in touch with
people in  Bulgaria. And we actually went to Bulgaria to meet them and we
rehearsed for  three days. Its one of the most incredible experiences I've had,
you know, to  meet them as people as well as musicians. They are so warm and
affectionate, and  they don't speak a word of English and we don't speak
Bulgarian, but it just  didn't seem to matter. The communication is on a very
emotional level and it was  great. I really hope I can work with them again. 
</P>
<P>	&lt; Rocket's Tail is played &gt; 
</P>
<P>GG: Wow, you know, its always a trip (?), every time a new album comes out
its  kinda there's a different set of sounds, a different something coming out.
In fact  one of our listeners called up, who's wondering if there's ever any
hope for you  to work with Liz from the Cocteau Twins (Kate goes AH !) sometime
in the  future. 
</P>
<P>KT: That's a great idea. 
</P>
<P>GG: It would. She has just done a song recently with Ian McCllough (sp?)
where she  actually sang lyrics (Kate goes UH !) which was something I had never
heard her  stray into and on your albums every once in a while you stray into
singing  non-lyrics, using the voice purely as an instrument. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well, I think the voice is an instrument, and its I think its good to
experiment  with all the instruments we have. 
</P>
<P>GG: On Walk Straight Down The Middle you've got some incredible things going
on  there. 
</P>
<P>KT: You like that ? 
</P>
<P>GG: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well good. 
</P>
<P>GG: Its a fitting end for the album, you know it kinda bookends the album
very  nicely. Where do you come up with these things, where do you dig them from
 inside you ? 
</P>
<P>KT: I think its a very difficult question, that one, because making music is
such an  elusive thing. I guess with a song like that, that was very much just a
matter of  me playing patterns (?) and chords on the fairlight and I came up
with the tune  and then ofcourse Eberhard Weber put in his bass on, gave the
song such a strong  personality. It kind of took on a life of its own as most of
these songs do. 
</P>
<P>	&lt; Walk Straight Down The Middle is played &gt; 
</P>
<P>GG: There's a song on the album that is finally a love song for lonely
computer  hackers (KT laughs). They have their own song now. Deeper
Understanding. 
</P>
<P>KT: That's right. 
</P>
<P>GG: People are of course gonna think that you are a whiz on computers now 
because you've done a song about them, but what's the real truth ? 
</P>
<P>KT: It's kind of what you said, its about these lonely people in this modern
world  who more and more they are being encouraged to stay in their houses and
watch  television and not go out and not meet people but do it through computers
all the  time. And this song is about someone who spends all their time with
their  computer. They have a very steady relationship and they see very few
people,  have not much contact. And its the idea of them seeing an ad in a
magazine for a  program for people who are lonely and lost. And they send off
for the program  and when they put it into their computer it comes alive and its
like, its like a  visitation and what the computer is offering them is real love
and basically this  human being just can't take it (laughs). Its too much for
them, its like trying to  be killed by love. I suppose in a way this song is
saying that this world is getting  colder and getting more and more isolated. To
experience love and affection is  getting more difficult in the world we live in
and its the idea of this person  actually getting that kind of love from the
coldest form of machine we have,  which is the computer. 
</P>
<P>GG: But its still love. 
</P>
<P>KT: Ya, I think actually that computers could hold a tremendous amount for
us in  the future. I think they could teach us an awful lot about ourselves. I
have a lot of  faith in the potential for computers and our spirituality. 
</P>
<P>	&lt; Deeper Understanding is played &gt; 
</P>
<P>GG: I must confess one comic note on Deeper Understanding. I have a
telephone  that has the exact same sound (KT laughs) and the first eight or nine
times  through the album I was continually running up to get the phone and no
one was  there (KT laughs again). Two minutes later I'd do it again and I
finally went,  wait a minute that's on the record. 
</P>
<P>KT: Wow. 
</P>
<P>GG: It was running at such a volume that... 
</P>
<P>KT: That's great. The time you wanna worry is when you pick up the phone and
 there's a voice at the end going Hello George !!! 
</P>
<P>GG: There's another song with kind of a wry twist to it and I've heard a
great  story about this one and that is Head We're Dancing. 
</P>
<P>KT: Oh yes. 
</P>
<P>GG: What's the story ? 
</P>
<P>KT: Well its a very dark story and I really think its not a song I would
write now,  but it was inspired by a friend of mine who had been with someone he
found  absolutely fascinating. And the next day he said to the host who was that
person I  was sitting next to last night and they said that it was Oppenheimer,
the guy  who'd been involved in creating the bomb. And my friend's reaction was
horror  because he just really hated what this guy stood for. His feelings
completely  changed about the guy soon as he knew who he was. And I found that
really  interesting, that you could be with somebody fun and so charming but
then find  out at one point who they are, you know, its like a completely
different story. So I  was thinking of, you know, the fairy tale of little girls
where they go to a ball and  then they meet the charming mysterious stranger who
turns out to be a prince.  And I was thinking, really who is the worst person
you can meet as a stranger,  who is the embodiment of evil, you know the closest
thing to the Devil. And of  course really the only person that stands out there
in modern history is Hitler and  so its really saying that evil people can be so
charming and its so easy to be fooled  by people and its saying that how often
evil comes in a charming guise. So its  really just exploring that and I would
be very worried if people were offended by  the song. I really had no intentions
to offend anyone. 
</P>
<P>GG: But then we might want to be careful about some of the very charming,
smiling  gladhands. 
</P>
<P>KT: I think so. Ya, watch out for the charmers, I'll reckon. 
</P>
<P>GG: I think there are a lot of people watching out for you. 
</P>
<P>KT: (laughs) Well they should. 
</P>
<P>GG: Is there something lurking in Kate Bush's heart that we have to watch
out for ? 
</P>
<P>KT: Oh, I think there is something lurking in everybody's heart. It's good
as well as  bad, you know. Let's try and get the good out, alright ? 
</P>
<P>	&lt; Heads We're Dancing is played &gt; 
</P>
<P>GG: When you're writing songs, you're not embarassed about getting extremely
 personal and really baring yourself on your albums. 
</P>
<P>KT: That's really true, all art to some extent has to be personal and I
think what's  difficult is not handing that work out to the world but its having
to then justify it  and explain it to people. That's what is difficult. Then you
are caught in a  moment where you have to analyse it or somehow go back on
moments that were  long ago. It somehow takes art out of its context. I think
really you should just go  out to the world and be as personal as you dare. 
</P>
<P>GG: I have to ask because everybody is going to just, you know, come up the
hill  with torches if I don't. Is there going to be a tour ? 
</P>
<P>KT: I feel so embarassed at... and I feel so flattered that people keep
asking. I just  have been so much with making albums and I get so involved in
what I do. The  projects become longer and longer and I just haven't had the
space to do this.  And I would really like to at some point, but I can't promise
anyone anything so  that's what I can say and thank you so much for everyone
wanting me to. 
</P>
<P>GG: Well thank you for spending some time with us Kate. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well, thank you George... 
</P>
<P>GG: Its been a real pleasure. 
</P>
<P>KT: ...really nice speaking to you. 
</P>
<P>GG: With you too and good luck with the new album. We'll be watching for the
 next. 
</P>
<P>KT: Well thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>GG: Not four years this next time, OK ? 
</P>
<P>KT: Oh, I hope not. 
</P>
<P>GG: OK, take care. 
</P>
<P>KT: All the best. Bye. 
</P>
<P>	&lt; The Fog is played &gt;
