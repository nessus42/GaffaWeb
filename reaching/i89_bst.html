<P>Date: Mon, 30 Oct 89 11:59 PST <BR> From: Andrew Marvick (IED) <BR>
Subject: French Best Magazine by Gerard Bar-David November 1989 
</P>
<P>This interview was conducted in English by Gerard Bar-David, then translated
 into French and published in the November 1989 issue of France's music
magazine,  Best. The following is a re-translation back into English, by IED.
Love-Hounds are  therefore advised not to mistake any of Kate's statements for
verbatim quotations. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual Bush
</P>
<P>&quot;If you know nothing of music, what good is it to be Irish?&quot; 
</P>
<P>In dizzying profusion, minibuses and limousines follow each other on the
straight  path which leads to the manor of Chilston Park, the place
designated--no doubt at  the command of Mr. EMI--to serve as the epicenter of
the explosion of the new and  long-awaited (four years--how time flies!) opus
signed by Lady Kate Bush.
</P>
<P> With its eighteenth-century paneling and elaborate bric-a-brac, this
splendid  &quot;rustic English&quot; domicile is the perfect decor for
rediscovering the babe--Bush--who  baptised her latest single The Sensual World
in opposition to the ubiquitous  crudeness of our sexual world. In the age of
software, Kate battles for the comeback  of softness.
</P>
<P>In such a place as this, one dreams of a portrait-gallery. If you had to
collect one,  Kate, whose faces would be found in it?
</P>
<P>&quot;That's a very personal question, but amid those faces that I'd like to
collect,  Hitchcock's would definitely have to be included among my favourites,
because  he was absolutely brilliant. He was a genius. He saw life with the
vision of a  camera, as though his eyes were the view-finder. Most of the other
portraits  would be friends who have mattered a lot to me. It's a little like
this album,  where each song is a painting of a friend, or of a privileged
moment.&quot;
</P>
<P>A friend like Alan Stivell, who in fact is found on your record?
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always adored his music. My brother John had already been a fan
for years. He  listened to his songs endlessly at home. My meeting with Alan was
an amazing  coincidence. Once we had begun working on this album, I thought that
it would  be fantastic to integrate Stivell's harp into the songs' atmospheres.
We had never  met, Alan and I. Two days later, by the purest chance, I found a
little note in my  letterbox signed 'Alan Stivell': he knew that we had never
met, but perhaps I  had heard some of his music; in any case, he said, he would
love to work with me.  What a coincidence! I telephoned him, and he came over to
contribute to the  album. It's a lovely story.&quot;
</P>
<P>In your portrait-gallery, one would no doubt find your &quot;mentor&quot;,
David Gilmour,  who put his guitar to service on your Sensual World .
</P>
<P>&quot;Let's see...Where can we put David? Over the mantle-piece, no doubt.
It was a  dream to have Dave with me on this LP, because in all these years we
had never  really worked together, and he's such a great virtuoso. And was I
terrified when  we first met! He was such a big star, and me, I was still
nothing but a tiny little  plant. A friend we had in common had known him since
high school. At the end  of the '70s Dave was looking for new artists to foster,
and his friend told him,  'You absolutely have to hear this girl'. Dave freaked
out, and helped me to  produce my very first demos. I could never have succeeded
without him, and to  have him on my album was like a little girl's dream come
true.&quot;
</P>
<P>With Irish acoustic musicians, Greek bouzoukis, Celtic harps and the Mystere
des  Voix Bulgares, is your Sensual World your tour of the best possible worlds?
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always wanted to use Irish musicians. So I went to Dublin to
throw myself into  its roots. The Irish are affectionate and warm, and the music
there strangely  resembles them in that way. Like their language, which is
intense, musical and  spiritual, their music knows how to transport me. My
mother is Irish, and since I  was a child I've always been immersed in its
sound. At home there were always  members of our family who would come over to
play on the fiddle or the  accordion. In our group everyone could play at least
one instrument, and you'd be  taken for a real fool if you didn't listen to any
music. My mother often said: 'If  you know nothing of music, what good is it to
be Irish?' This music, it's really a  part of myself.
</P>
<P>&quot;As for the Bulgarians, I experienced an amazing musical contact with
them. I  discovered their music, and I had hoped to include them in my album. So
I went  to Bulgaria to meet them. These women have been singing together for
twenty  years--thirty years--and they worked so hard. I didn't speak a word of
their  language and in ten minutes they opened their house to me. After the
dinner, we  were sitting in their kitchen and one of them picked up the
telephone to listen  for the dial tone. Eva then gave the tone to the others,
and they began to sing. I  was so moved that I broke into tears.&quot;
