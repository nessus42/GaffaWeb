Garden</A>.)</P>
<P>The Keyboard/Totally Wired/Songwriter U.S.A. interview (early 1985)
</P>
<P>    [The following interview with Kate was published in the June 1985 issue
of Keyboard magazine (she appears on the cover sitting at the keyboard of her
Fairlight.) A very similar version of the interview then appeared in the
premiere (September/October 1985) issue of Songwriter U.S.A. magazine, which
added the first six paragraphs of the present edition, as well as a brief
discography (not reproduced here).
</P>
<P>     [Portions of the interview were also broadcast as part of the Totally
Wired, Mark II series, which aired on public radio stations. The interview was
conducted by John Diliberto. This, the first integrated transcription, is by
MarK T. Ganzer (Thanks again, MarK!). Edited by Andrew Marvick.
</P>
<P>     [On listening to the radio interview, it became clear that Kate's
comments, as printed in Keyboard, had been re-phrased and edited. Similarly, the
radio interview had taken comments from different portions of the interview and
spliced then together to make it sound like one continuous chain of thought.
Despite these faults, the interview is quite good, as it goes into the details
of how Kate uses the Fairlight in her writing. I have attempted to rectify the
faults with the two interviews by merging the two and using Kate's own words
where possible. Those portions that were transcribed from the radio interview
will be enclosed in parentheses.]
</P>
<P>     (Since the last album (The Dreaming, released towards the end of 1982)
Kate Bush has achieved the long-held ambition of designing, building and
equipping her own recording studio. Upon its completion, six months of
songwriting was followed by nearly a year of recording. The result, the album
Hounds of Love, shows Kate at a new creative peak, both musically and lyrically.
It also displays her increasing prowess as a producer, which was recognized in
early May in Montreux, Switzerland, where she won several awards.
</P>
<P>     ([Her debut album The Kick Inside ] contained the atmosphere-laden
Wuthering Heights, which introduced Kate to the world, and which topped the
singles chart for four weeks. The hits continued with The Man With the Child in
His Eyes, Hammer Horror and Wow, the last two taken from the second album,
Lionheart.
</P>
<P>      The next project was Kate's only tour to date, but one which remains a
milestone in the live presentation of popular music. A dazzling combination of
music, theatre and dance, she was involved in every aspect of its elaborate
staging, from the choreography and costumes to the lighting and sound.
</P>
<P>     The single Breathing (released in April 1980) marked a dramatic
departure from her previous material, one which was consolidated with the
release of the album Never For Ever in the late summer. It crashed into the
charts at Number One and spawned two further hit singles, Babooshka and Army
Dreamers.
</P>
<P>      (With Never For Ever Kate was co-producing for the first time, and by
the next album, The Dreaming (released in September 1982), she had complete
involvement in the production. With the benefit of hindsight The Dreaming can be
seen as having set the scene for Hounds of Love, both musically and from a
production point of view.
</P>
<P>     (With the accompanying promotional activities precluding the
possibility of another tour in the immediate future, Kate is currently working
on an idea to present Side Two of Hounds of Love through another medium to which
she has already made a notable contribution--video. This is planned as a visual
interpretation of The Ninth Wave. [This plan was later abandoned.]
</P>
<P>     (Before then, on September 16, the Hounds of Love will be unleashed in
the U.K. on record, cassette and compact disk.)
</P>
<P>     Despite enormous success in her native England, evidenced by a string
of hit albums and singles that goes back to her debut in 1977, Kate Bush is
practically anonymous in the States. Even with an intense cult following and a
Canadian fan club that is so fanatic that they hold their own Kate Bush
conventions and publish a fanzine, she has had no luck breaking into the
American charts. Lost in the trans-Atlantic crossing is the fact that Kate is a
vital and innovative composer, singer, keyboardist, and producer who has shaped
a uniquely personal and organic sound. Her brilliantly orchestrated vocals weave
effortlessly in and out of structures whose foundations are built on Bush's own
piano and Fairlight playing. The stories told by her lyrics, the way she mingles
the music of many cultures, the shifting rhythms, and even the drum sound on her
1982 tour de force, The Dreaming, have caused many to draw comparisons between
Kate and another British luminary, Peter Gabriel.
</P>
<P>     The history of Bush's career is one of those classic tales people dream
about: an unknown singer, discovered by a rock star (Pink Floyd guitarist Dave
Gilmour), is molded into a hitmaker who uses success to take charge of her own
career, overcoming the sex-kitten image of her early years (which led many a
writer to talk about her various sexual attributes--&quot;pouting lips&quot; and
so on--rather than her music).
</P>
<P>     Kate was born on July 30, 1958, into a musical family that included two
older brothers who played traditional Irish and British music. At age 11, she
began playing the piano. &quot;I was just mucking around with it,&quot; she
claims. &quot;There was something in myself that could just wander off when I
started playing the piano.&quot;
</P>
<P>     She was soon captured by the instrument, and as a self-taught musician,
it took her a while to catch onto the mechanics of songwriting. &quot;I started
trying to put words to the piano, and found it incredibly difficult,&quot; Bush
remembers. &quot;I couldn't understand how people did it got some books from the
library to see if I could make those words fit my music. It was absolutely
useless, so I had to try to make my own words to fit. I spent years of every day
getting home from school and playing the piano.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Until she was 16, Kate's only audience consisted of friends and family,
but they were so enthusiastic that they tried to get her a publishing deal.
Eventually friends of friends led them to Dave Gilmour, who was seeking out new
talent at the time. He liked what he heard, put up money to produce some demos,
and landed a recording contract for Kate with EMI. She left school a year later,
and the following summer, 1977, she recorded her debut album, The Kick Inside.
Her first single, Wuthering Heights, which was later covered by Pat Benatar,
went to the number one spot on the U.K. charts.
</P>
<P>     That first album fell somewhere between cabaret and rock and roll.
Produced by Andrew Powell with top British session artist like Alan Skidmore,
Duncan Mackay, and Morris Pert, it tended to emphasize the uncanny quality of
Bush's four-octave voice. [An exaggeration.] She sang in a high, child-like wail
that lent a distinctive unearthly quality to her narrative songs. From the
beginning, she merged dance and theater into her live performances, one of which
is captured on the video Live at the Hammersmith Odeon. Her songs provided
characters whose roles she played, and as with the best actresses, audiences
could rarely separate Kate Bush from the characters she portrayed. Fans and
media alike hooked onto the image of the auburn-tressed child seductress singing
about mythological incest (The Kick Inside) and lost loves.
</P>
<P>     Even on that first album, there was maturity of composition and some
fine romantic piano that belied Kate's years. Her idiosyncratically twisted
rhymes and meters sounded perfectly natural. Besides, in the initial blooming of
Britain's punk movement, with it's monochromaticism, Bush was a refreshing
alternative to the angst of the day.
</P>
<P>     Her second album, Lionheart, recorded close on the heels of The Kick
Inside, was a sophomore slump. Its light MOR arrangements seemed to be grooming
Bush for the adult-contemporary audience, but it too yielded it's share of U.K.
hits. With two LP's under her belt, and despite an inability to crack the U.S.
charts, Kate took control of her third album, 1980's Never For Ever. The results
were dramatic. Using a Fairlight CMI for the first time, her arrangements took
on new dimensions and her voice gained added maturity and versatility. Songs
were no longer designed to show off her chops; instead each song was given its
own vocal character- unique and distictively Kate Bush. &quot;When I was younger&quot;,
she explains, &quot;I was into the idea of singing high, expanding my voice and
making it leap. So I wrote some songs to really push my voice and increase it's
range. Now I concentrate more on the song.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Bush's involvement as co-producer as well as performer on her third
album can be seen in the unity of the songs. While each is clearly
different--the romantic Delius, the haunting Breathing (which featured Larry
Fast on Prophet-5 synthesizer), the rocking Violin -- they all hold together
sonically. Kate is credited with playing piano and some Fairlight on the album.
Max Middleton accompanies on Rhodes and plays a gorgeous synthesizer solo over
some spacious changes in Egypt. With help from co-producer Jon Kelly, her studio
manipulations hold a wealth of detail. Coupled with the Fairlight, instruments
like kotos and mandolins gave her music a new exotic quality that seemed to free
her voice, allowing it to be more natural.
</P>
<P>    In 1980, Kate also performed on Peter Gabriel's third eponymously
entitled record, and the experience seems to have influenced her own
self-produced masterpiece, The Dreaming. Gabriel and producer Steve Lillywhite
used the Fairlight (played by Larry Fast) and extensive studio processing to
obtain dark and percussive ethnic textures on Gabriel. Bush's The Dreaming is
also full of tribal rhythms and swirling electronic atmospheres. The album's
title is taken from the concept of &quot;dreamtime&quot;, which Australian
aborigines consider an altered state of reality. This is what The Dreaming is--a
harrowing psychological foray into another world. From the opening song of
failed spirituality, Sat In Your Lap, with its African percussion and Geoff
Downes' Fairlight trumpets, to the trance rhythms of the title track, to the
emotional catharsis of Get Out of My House, The Dreaming thrusts you into an
uncharted realm and won't let you escape.
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush leaves no doubt that she is the master of this dream world
that, frighteningly, has its roots firmly seated in reality. This is not the
woman-child of The Kick Inside (if she ever was that). This is the mature and
experienced artist whose own arrangements have a clarity and depth that makes
her previous records, as professional as they were, sound flat and lifeless by
comparison. Her voice becomes a full orchestra, alternating between hellish
choirs, ascending angels, and compelling exhortations. She can simply narrate a
straightforward tale of crime, replete with Saturday afternoon marching band
arrangement (done on Synclavier by Dave Lawson accompanied by Bush herself on
piano and Yamaha CS-80), sing a poignant lover's lament (Houdini) or a song of
self-recrimination with phase-shifter-tortured vocal (Leave It Open). Kate has
always written her own music, but having acquired a Fairlight and her own
studio, she began to orchestrate all her own arrangements, which include heavy
doses of Uillean pipes, penny whistles, and bouzoukis played by her brother
Paddy and his friends from the Irish group Planxty.
</P>
<P>      That was three years ago, however, as Kate Bush takes longer and
longer between releases since the rush of the first two albums. We spoke with
her in her suburban London home, just as she was finishing work on her new
release (due out in August), which she describes as a long and exhausting
project. Having just arisen moments before the interview, Kate was enthusiastic
and candid, at least as much as someone could be expected to be who wrote:
</P>
<P>     &quot;With my ego in my gut,       My babbling mouth would wash it up. 
     (But now I've started learning how)       I keep it shut.&quot;
</P>
<P>      --Leave It Open 
</P>
<P>     Your image has changed dramatically from that of a pop chanteuse, as
you were perceived on your first two albums, to that of someone with a very
clear artistic vision, which is how people have come to perceive you since your
third and fourth records. Is that an accurate assessment?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Even on the first two records, I was doing what I'm doing now as
a artist, only (because I was a lot younger, and I didn't have the room and the
space to be able to truly present my music. I had to work with a producer and
within certain kind of set-ups because of the fact that- that's how it was, I
wasn't powerful enough basically to be able to say, 'Look, I'm producing this
myself. This is what I do.' And that's what I do now.) I think that if I had
been a little older, and if I'd had the experience at the time, I would have
done it then, too. (But I was--When I was making my first album, I was 18. I had
never really worked with a band before, let alone a producer in a studio setup.
So I just had--[laughs]--I mean I just about had the guts, you know, to sing and
keep it together.) But you learn very quickly what you want. By the time the
second album was finished, I knew that I had to be involved. Even though they
were my songs and I was singing them, the finished product was not what I
wanted. That wasn't the producer's fault. He was doing a good job from his point
of view- making it sound good and together. But for me, it was not my album,
really.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Is the album you're working on going to be a departure from The
Dreaming, or is it a continuation of the ideas you developed there?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's difficult for me to say, really. I think it is different
from The Dreaming. When I sit down and write songs for a new album, that's one
of the things that's important to me--that it's at least somehow different and
hopefully interesting.&quot;
</P>
<P>     The album The Dreaming was quite a radical departure from you previous
records.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, I think it is different, but I don't know if it's that
different. It's very different from the first two albums, but the third album is
where I think we started to get there. I think it was a progression, really. But
perhaps not such an obvious one.&quot;
</P>
<P>     [Note: The following comment appears in the radio interview with regard
to The Dreaming, but does not appear in the magazine interview.]
</P>
<P>     (&quot;But it is quite...dark, I suppose, without meaning to be
negative. I think it is saying...nearly all those songs are saying that people
are great, but they really hurt each other, and you know, look at the things we
do to each other. Why do we do this...you know, questioning. I think albums are
like that, they're...they are little diaries. You know, you sort of sit there
and write--not autobiographical things--but what you feel at the time, things
that move you. I think it does say alot about you at the time.&quot;)
</P>
<P>     What were the differences?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think the main difference was connected to my involvement. The
more I get involved in the production, then the more I'm going to get exactly
what I can out of it. Therefore, it automatically becomes a more demanding and
personal project.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You started using a Fairlight on Never For Ever.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Right, I didn't have my own Fairlight and we had to hire one in.
(And really as soon as I met the Fairlight, I realized that it was something I
really couldn't do without because it was just so integral to what I wanted to
do with my music. I think I've always enjoyed synthesizers...I found them very
interesting, but I never really enjoyed all the sounds. And what really gets me
about the Fairlight is that any sound becomes musical. You can actually control
any sound you want by sampling it in, and then being able to play it. I mean
obviously, it doesn't always sound great, but the amount of potential
exploration you have there with sounds is never-ending, and it's fabulous.)
</P>
<P>     Do you write songs around the Fairlight?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, I do now. This is actually the first album that I've done
that on. Up until now, I've always written on the piano. It's been a very
important part of it. The songs came from the piano and the chords. But with
this album, the majority of the songs have come from the Fairlight and working
with drum machines and things like that.&quot;
</P>
<P>     It seemed that many of the rhythms on The Dreaming, especially the
title track, came more from vocal rhythms. They don't seem keyboard-based at
all.
</P>
<P>     &quot;You're quite right. ([Laughs.] That's not a keyboard-based song
at all. It's very much based on aboriginal music that I'd been able to hear.)
(And it does have quite a specific ryythm--that sort of slow, spacey thing. It's
got so much space in it. And that was very much one of the things we wanted to
get across, this... much like landscapes of huge deserted flatlands. That's what
the music seems to say. It talks about, you know, where they --the
aborigines--went; their environment.) That was actually an idea I'd had since
the third album. I knew I wanted to write a song that was about abuses-the
aborigines, the Indians, these tribes whose counties had been taken away from
them by so-called civilized man. I wanted it to be based around the aboriginal
style of music. Their music says so much to me about space, earth, and living on
the land. So the whole thing is based around the dijeridu. I have a rough sample
in my Fairlight, and I sort of worked out ideas from that. Then we got people in
and pieced all the other sounds together. It was quite a visual song, because
you could see so many things that suggested to you where to place sounds.
</P>
<P>     But you actually used a dijeridu player instead of the Fairlight sample
on the track.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think it would be insulting to the instrument to suggest that
the Fairlight could do it better--I don't know if you realize the sort of
circular breathing technique that's involved in playing it. (The dijeridu is one
of those incredible instruments with the circular sound that's incredibly...sort
of rooted in the earth. And we got Rolf Harris in to play it, and he is a
brilliant didgeridoo player. He could just keep it going for half an hour.)&quot;
</P>
<P>     What kind of things have you been doing with the Fairlight?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I use the Fairlight in a basic way, really. (What really appeals
to me most is the idea of having any sound that is available put into the
Fairlight. And I use it  mainly as I would my piano. So it's finding the sound I
want, which cyan take ages- that's the most difficult thing- and then working
around it musically to make it suit the song. When I'm writing a song around it,
normally I just use chords with a quite simple Fairlight sound. And then if I
want to build up things, I'll do small overdubs just as we go throughout the
album,) with the Fairlight being dragged in every other week. So in the writing
process, the main Fairlight sound goes down even on the demos. You find the
sounds that work for overdubs at a later date. For me, the ideal is the
combination of Fairlight and acoutic instruments, rather than it being all
electronic or all acoustic.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Are you using sounds that they give you with the Fairlight, or have you
been sampling your own?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Some of the presets that they supply are actually quite good. But
there's one favorite that everyone is using, called 'Orch. 5' or something.
Every time anyone who has a Fairlight hears it they go, 'Oh,no! Not again!'
There are a couple of good preset sounds, but I think that the most exciting
thing is actually recording sounds and sampling them in. Quite often the nature
of the sound changes when you put it in the Fairlight, but that in itself can be
quite interesting.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You used 'Orch. 5' yourself in The Dreaming [single].
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes [laughs], but as far as I know, at that time no one had used
it. Of course, this was the early days of the Fairlight. Actually I'm surprised
that so many people have used the same sound.&quot;
</P>
<P>      You seem to go for more natural sounds, rather than electronic ones,
on The Dreaming LP.
</P>
<P>     (&quot;There's a human element in that album that's quiteo a...sort of
tormented human looking for, you know, how to sort out all these problems and
pain. And I think it's... these sounds are right, the human sounds, the
sensitive emotional sounds. It's quite an emotional album really, and I just
want to suit it.) I think that the combination of very acoustic real sounds and
very hard electronic sounds is fabulous too. I like to create contrasts and
extremes for the atmosphere that you're building around a particular song.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You get those extremes in Night of the Swallow, going from the Irish
folk music played by the members of Planxty into a very sparse piano part.
</P>
<P>      &quot;It's always the song that tells you what to do. In my head, I'
thinking that I'm finished with this, but the song will go, 'Look, you can't get
this if you don't do this...' The song is controlling you. It's tell you what to
do really. If it works, great. If it doesn't, it just keeps you dragging along
behind it. It's strange.&quot;
</P>
<P>     When you're working out a song to a particular chord pattern you've
come up with on a keyboard, what comes first, the lyrics or the vocal melody?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Quite often, I get the lyrics and melody in a short burst. Maybe
I'll get the first verse or the choruses straight away. Then it'll take me
forever just trying to piece the rest together, because you have to try to
maintain a level of quality within the lyrics, especially if you're trying to
tell a story. You have to get the phrasing right, but you're hoping your
audience will be able to see where you're going. I find that the most difficult
thing to do, especially if it's something like The Dreaming, [a song] which I
found totally interesting. It was very difficult for me to do that and get what
I wanted across. Some of the songs really do take me a very long time, although
perhaps the initial ideas came rather quickly.&quot;
</P>
<P>      Your vocal arrangements are often complex enough to suggest that a
keyboard instrument was involved in coming up with the parts. Is this the case?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Sometimes the backing vocals just come in automatically as part
of a song when I'm writing it. Other times, maybe it won't be until I've
recorded the main voice and a few events in the song. And then I'll think it
needs something there. Those are really the two extremes: I either come up with
the backing vocals in the initial writing, or I hear a hole that needs filling.
Whether I build up a really thick, grand vocal depends on the song. If the song
needs that, then I'll just overdub the voice and build the vocals up. If it's a
very intimate song between the singer and the subject matter, then you'd write
it with just one voice.&quot;
</P>
<P>      You process your voice quite a bit.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I'm sure there are quite a few people like me who really prefer
the sound of their own voice when it's affected a bit. To hear your own voice
absolutely straight with nothing on it can be very painful. Again, it depends on
what the songs are about.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Where do you work your songs out?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I've had a home studio for the last few years. For this album, we
put together a master home studio. The difference it makes is fantastic. The
obvious difference is that we're not paying a phenomenal amount of money every
hour for a London studio. That makes you feel so much more relaxed. The amount
of pressure that the studio situation puts on you is quite surprising. You also
feel a lot freer to experiment.&quot;
</P>
<P>      We understand that before, you'd do the demos and often not be able to
duplicate the same feeling in the studio.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think that's one of the most impossible things to do, and
everyone in the business must have it happen to them. You do a demo and it's the
song, the spontaneity of how you put it down, that little inflection in the
voice there, or something in the demo says it all. Even though the vocals are
rough and the drums are out of time, it's got the feel of the song. Them you
come to master it and it's not there. It's too fast or too clean. It's just not
the same. Trying to recreate the moods of something you did so spontaneously can
be so impossible. What we've done on this album is make the demos the masters.
We demoed in the studio so that there were no demos anymore. They've transformed
into the masters.&quot;
</P>
<P>    When you started working with electronic instruments, did you start
listening to what other people were doing?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, you can't help but hear other people's electronic music.
music is an inspiring thing to hear. But unfortunately, 99% of my time is eaten
up listening to my own and nothing else. And then, it's only listening to what
I'm working on at that moment. When I'm finished, I go through these big phases
of listening to other people's stuff. It's so exciting.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Who do you listen to at those times?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I'm particularly into a label called Windham Hill. That's
beautiful music--absolutely gorgeous. And there's a German label called ECM that
has a lot of jazz-rock music. One of my favorite artists there is (bassist)
Eberhard Weber. He's fantastic [Weber appears on The Dreaming]. I find that the
most enjoyable thing for me to do when I get in from the studio, other than
listen to music, is to watch videos. My ears are so tired. You get such a form
of concentrated listening--you've got to listen for clicks and drums and the
voice...So when you get back, you want to rest your ears and let your eyes watch
rubbish for half an hour.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Why do you sometimes use other musicians to play certain keyboard parts
on your records? Listening to your piano playing, you wouldn't have any trouble
covering the parts that they play.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, I don't play the Synclavier. I play the Fairlight, but I
didn't have a Fairlight of my own until the last album, and that was only
towards the end of it. In fact, that's why I had to get people in. I had to hire
their Fairlight and Synclavier and I had to have them play it as well-- until I
had my own.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What do you have in your studio?
</P>
<P>     &quot;We have a Soundcraft mixing deck, a Studer A-80 tape machine,
lots of outboard gear, and Q-lock. We normally use 48 tracks now, even if it's
for a vocal idea or something. 24 tracks doesn't seem to go anywhere with me.
And the Fairlight, of course. We have a room simulator called a Quantec, which
is my favorite. It would be lovely to be able to draw the sort of room you
wanted your voice to be in. I think that's the next step.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Any other synthesizrs besides the Fairlight?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I've got an Emulator, but I haven't really used that on any of
the master recording--yet. It's the only other synthesizer I have in there.&quot;
</P>
<P>     You played Yamaha CS-80 on The Dreaming. Was that hired?
</P>
<P>     &quot;No, that was mine, but I must admit the Fairlight has taken over
completely now.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What sort of piano do you prefer?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think my favourite piano is the one I have at home. It's an
upright Bechstein. It's absolutely beautiful, but it's not ideal for master
recordings. For me, the piano is one of the most difficult things to record
well. It sounds good in the room, but it doesn't always sound good coming
through the speakers. We find that we have to do quite a bit of work on them to
get them to sound good on tape. But I like Bechsteins, and I think Steinways are
quite good. I find that it sometimes helps for the piano to be older. I have a
Grotrian-Steinweg piano that I use all the time in our studio, and that seems
quite nice.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What sorts of things do you have to do to get pianos to sound good?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It depends on the nature of the piano. Some pianos are very
mid-rangey, so it's nice to get away from the mid- and go for the top-end and
things like that. But there's only so much you can do. Hopefully, you have the
nicest sounding piano you can find and you don't have to do much to it. It's
also nice to have the piano in a live-sounding room with an ambience mike on it.
That helps a lot.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Who was the biggest influence on your piano playing?
</P>
<P>     &quot;In my teens, it was mostly Elton John. For me, he was the only
person who was writing songs and then playing and singing them together. I
thought his piano playing was fantastic and quite jazzy in some ways. What I
liked was that his accompaniment was always so right for the songs. He was
definitely a big inspiration for me in my teens. I think my favorite keyboard
players are more keyboard players than pianists. And I love the stuff that Brian
Eno does. The sounds he comes up with are really brilliant.&quot;
</P>
<P>     How did There Goes a Tenner come together?
</P>
<P>     &quot;That was written on the piano. I had an idea for the tune and
just knocked out the chords for the first verse. The words and everything just
came together. It was quite a struggle from there on to try to keep things
together. The lyrics are quite difficult on that one, because there are a lot of
words in quite a short space of time. They had to be phrased right and
everything. That was very difficult. Actually the writing went hand-in-hand with
the CS-80.&quot;
</P>
<P>     It's easy to hear how the piano was used for the verses, but what about
the choruses? Those sections are very uncharacteristic of what you'd expect to
be written on a piano?
</P>
<P>     &quot;That was really the difficult structure of the song. I could hear
what I wanted, but until we put the Synclavier in there--which was played by
Dave Lawson--I couldn't get the full picture. I really liked what we did in
that.&quot;
</P>
<P>     How are you putting together songs now?
</P>
<P>     &quot;At least six or seven of the tracks on this new album have been
done in totally different ways. There's one track that I literally wrote on the
Fairlight and then re-did things completely with strings. And the drums, which
were originally Linn, were re-done with a live drummer. Then there's another
track that's completely different, where I'd write through a guitarist. It
really needed to be based around a guitar and I can't play guitar. If I'd used a
piano or Fairlight, it would've been wrong, so I literally had to write through
the guitarist. That was fabulous.&quot;
</P>
<P>      What was it that made you decide to replace the Fairlight and Linn
with real strings and real drums?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I suppose it's when I get the voice and lyrics on, they tell me
what to do. (I thought, um...Although the Fairlight strings were interesting,
they didn't have the...the warmth and the intimacy that the song required,
and...it sounded a bit bland on the Fairlight.) That particular song was a very
intimate one. (It needed...a wooden, human error, you know, the fact that it
wasn't always on the beat, and that there was this group of people working
together creating that sound. I do feel that in most cases when you've got a
brilliant musician and an instrument you really...I mean, what's the Fairlight
there for? I think it...it's a different purpose, to me anyways. I don't feel I
want to create the world's greatest cellist on the Fairlight. You know, I'd
rather get a really good cello player in, and record him with a good engineer,
and then use the Fairlight to do something that complimented that.) The most
exciting thing for me is the combination of real and natural sounds and
extremely electronic synthesized ones. It's just the blend of two worlds that I
find fabulous. In the next few years, it's going to be really lovely to see how
people start working these things. We've been in a real synthetic era for the
last three years. People have been interested in the new advances in
synthesizers. It's really exciting, and I think it's got people so wrapped up in
electronics that now perhaps will come the time when the blend will happen.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What about the idea that you may not be create the best cellist on the
Fairlight, but that you will be the cellist? It won't be Pablo Casals'
expression, it will be Kate Bush's expression?
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, I think that could be interesting, but I also think that
could be boring. On this album I've done so much of the work that I really enjoy
other people's input. I find it boring, actually, to have to work with my ideas
all the time. (The great thing, again, you can do with the Fairlight that I
enjoy so much is I can write a piece on it, say, with an acoustic guitar or a
cello, and I can write it out, and then I can get a musician in to actually play
that. So he's playing what I've written, but he's doing it much better than I
could do.) (You see, without the Fairlight, I probably couldn't have written
these parts before. I would have written them on the piano and they wouldn't
have had the feel of the strings, or acoustic guitar. And at the same time, you
know I don't think me playing them on the Fairlight is as good as these people.
But it's an interesting blend.)&quot;
</P>
<P>     Do you feel you have a better understanding of how these people play?
</P>
<P>     (&quot;Well, certainly in my experience, it's given me the most
incredible insight into composing and how instruments work. And I think it's
sort of...If you're not careful it can give you an arrogance as well, where
you're sort of sitting there playing all these drums and thinking, 'Hey, you
know, why can't you do this?', you know--like it's so easy. On the other hand,
you know, there are little inflections that would be so difficult to get on the
keyboard. I mean, you could probably get it to sound very close, but it...it
might...just not sound like the real instrument. A lot of natural instruments,
that's what it's about. It's the inflection of the musician, the way he works
it, personalizes it. I mean, you know real instruments should never die. I don't
think they can. That's what all these electronic things have come from. They
should go hand in hand.&quot;)
</P>
<P>     Do you compose on paper or right into the Fairlight or tape machine?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It's really in my head first and then onto the tape machine. I
onl compose onto paper when it's an instance like a guitar or cello, where I
play in real time to the track, and then when I like what it is, I'll write it
out for someone to play. If it's me playing it, I don't bother to write it out.
I work much better in my head. It takes me hours to write things out. I'm so
slow. But writing it out is a very accurate way to get them to do what you want
very quickly.&quot;
</P>
<P>     There's a depth of texture and complexity to your last two records that
makes them bear up well under repeated listening. They reveal more every time
you hear them.
</P>
<P>      &quot;That's lovely that you should say that. My favorite albums are
the ones I love more and more with each listening. That would be absolutely
dynamite if I felt that I was doing that for other people with my albums. Two of
my ultimate favourite recordings are Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper.&quot;
</P>
<P>      It's interesting you'd mention those particular Beatles albums,
because it seems that The Dreaming and Never For Ever harken back to that time
of the concept album and the idea of stepping into a different world when you're
listening to a record. There is a fantasy element to your imagery.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I always tend to resent that. I always feel that the Tolkein,
fantastical images seem to suggest that they're not based in reality, which I
can't help but feel that a lot of my stuff is. Not all of it, but a majority is
based in reality rather than fantasy. A lot of people say this, and I can't help
but feel that the first two albums set that impression. You know, the feel of
the production, the high voice, they sort of had a floating feel about them. But
few of those songs weren't based in reality.&quot;
</P>
<P>      You do make a lot of social statments in tunes like Pull Out the Pin
and Breathing.
</P>
<P>      &quot;My motivations are not social or political. It's an emotional
motivation, where I'm so moved by something that's happening that I have to
write about it. Apart from a few artists, I think that's how most of us feel
about it. We're not necessarily politically minded. Myself, I'm not all. I find
politics extremely destructive. I see very few good, long term productive things
being done by politics. It's one of those things that seems theoretically very
sound, but practically, it must be an impossibility. I think that's just an
emotional situation. Like nuclear war is a political thing, but it's also
incredibly emotional, because it means we could all be blown up. And no one
wants to be blown up. That's basic. The reason that you have to care about
politics is because of how bad people are to each other.&quot;
</P>
<P>     It's interesting that Pull Out the Pin was written from the Vietnamese
perspective.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, there was a fantastic TV documentary about a cameraman who
was on the front lines. He was a brilliant cameraman and he was so well-trained
a technician that he kept filming things no matter how he was feeling about it
at the time. Some of the stuff he was shooting was really disturbing. Some of
the Vietnamese guys would just come in and they were sort of dying in mid-air.
And he'd just keep on filming. (It was a strange sort of irony that the
Vietnamese who were fighting the Americans were very into Buddha...were
Buddhists...And they would pop a little silver bullet that they wore on their
neck--on a chain--in their mouth before they went into battle, so that if they
died, they would have Buddha on their lips. This is the whole irony throughout
history between religion and war. Religion, surely, would never regard killing
as a good thing, and yet it is done so constantly, and so hand-in-hand as well.
You know the fact that they...they would have the little Buddha in their mouth
and the guns in their hands to go and kill, I found the imagery very striking.)
Breathing is about human beings killing themselves. I think that people smoking
is one of those tiny things that says a lot about human beings. I mean, I smoke
and I enjoy it, but we smoke and we know it's dangerous. Maybe there's some kind
of strange subconscious desire to damage ourselves. It would seem so if you
looked back through history, wouldn't it?&quot;
