<P><STRONG>&quot;Call me sexy - I don't mind,&quot; says Kate</STRONG></P>
<P>With singer Kate Bush sex takes very much of a second  place.</P>
<P>Music is the love of her life.</P>
<P>Twenty-year-old Kate, flushed with the success of her  spectacular debut at
the London Palladium, made that  plain yesterday.</P>
<P>However if you do think of Kate as a singer with sex  appeal -- in that
order -- it's quite OK now.</P>
<P>But she wasn't so happy about it when she was released  on the world a year
ago with the smash hit number  &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; and was
immediately  hailed a as a sex symbol. </P>
<P><STRONG>  Worried</STRONG></P>
<P>&quot;That worried me very much,&quot; she said. &quot;I  did not want
people to start looking at me just as a face and  a body, rather than a person
who was presenting music. </P>
<P>&quot; &quot;As long as the 'sex symbol' tag doesn't get  in the way of that
then I'm very happy to be called one.&quot; </P>
<P>As for her own love life, Kate said: &quot;I have no time for  constant
boyfriends. I am obsessed with work.</P>
<P>&quot; I find myself worrying about perfection in everything.  My one danger
is that I can run out of fuel because there is so  little time to relax.&quot;</P>
<P>Kate who lives in Lewisham, South-East London with her two  brothers added: &quot;Marriage
will be out for me unless I want  children. It's really a heavy responsibility.&quot;</P>
<P>Monday's Palladium show, which Kate herself produced, was  one of the most
spectacular rock concerts for years.</P>
<P>It was also one of the most expensive. Kate shared the costs with  EMI, the
record company which discovered her natural talents at  the age of 16.</P>
<P>They kept her on ice, paying her a &pound;3,000 a year retainer,  before
launching her three years later.</P>
<P>&quot;They were frustrating times,&quot; Kate admitted. &quot;But  it was
worth waiting for. I had so much more confidence and  experience when I finally
get started properly.</P>
<P>&quot;I am still amazed that people like me so much. As they  do, I am
determined to give them nothing but the best.&quot; 
</P>
<P><STRONG> Rehearsed</STRONG></P>
<P>&quot;This is why I spent so long preparing for a European tour.  I wanted
everything absolutely right.</P>
<P>&quot;I rehearsed for two to three months, six days a week, up  to 14 hours
a day.&quot;</P>
<P>One of her own heroes, is Cliff Richard, &quot;He is a perfect  example of
someone who has been able to change with the  times,&quot; said Kate. &quot;That
is something I have to do.&quot;</P>
