Subject: Sounds 4th June 1986 (excerpts)

<P> &quot;SOUNDS&quot; Does a total Hatchet Job on Kate - newsflash from
Britain.... 
</P>
<P>I just picked up the latest copy of &quot;Sounds&quot; (June 7 issue) which
just came out  today (Wednesday, June 4). At first, I was really excited when I
saw that Kate was  on the cover, although I was puzzled by the use of one of the
most commonly  available record company promo-photo of her (the one with her
head resting with  her palms on her temples). Then my heart sank when I saw who
wrote the &quot;article&quot;  - the Infamous Richard Cook, who interviewed her
after the release of &quot;The  Dreaming&quot; in '82, and filled the article
with sarcastic and petty sniping at her (then  why bother to interview her?). 
</P>
<P>Anyway, despite the &quot;front cover status&quot;, this &quot;article&quot;
is nothing more than an  extended forum for his criticisms of Kate, with no
input whatsoever from her.  Although it is too long to completely transcribe
(and I have a paper due tomorrow)  here are the low-lights... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush, a teenager from a wealthy middle-class family, had art-rock
waiting  for her like a gift from the tooth fairy. The dinosaurs of her
listening youth weren't  monsters for he r. Pink Floyd, the most miserable group
that ever existed (Doug's  gonna LOVE this!) and the skeleton in many a
pioneer's closet, provided her first  archangel in the form of David Gilmour,
who produced that first studio work. She  would later admit her fascination with
`The Wall.' It's not hard to perceive the  echoes of Floyd's weary symphonies in
the Bush catalogue.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The tunes sounded like the fussy little melodies one associates with
musical  sewing boxes. The record is a folly...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;One can toil through Bush's work making flip comparisons all the time,
but it's  a search that turns over no personal vision on all these bits and
pieces.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;This grain-by-grain pursuit, a quintessence of art-rock, reached
overload with  `The Dreaming.' IT'S A THUNDEROUSLY AWFUL LP. AFTER THE OPENING 
`SAT IN YOUR LAP', AN ENERGETIC HOWL ABOUT THE GETTING OF  WISDOM, THE RECORD
COLLAPSES INTO A SLUGGISH, ELEPHANTINE  BLOW-OUT OF WORDS AND MUSIC IN SEARCH OF
MEANING AND  STRUCTURE. EVEN BUSH'S FAITHFUL WERE FOXED BY IT.&quot; !!!!!! 
</P>
<P>&quot;The second side (of Hounds of Love) is a dream sequence that's about
as  substantial as cotton wool&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Bush can't create anything more than a mood, a nostalgia for the
resonance of  art. She's like someone who flicks through the pages of a book,
impatient for the  pictures to come up. It has always been the way of art-rock&quot;
&quot;Bush, like Peter  Gabriel and Jim Kerr, is a mere translator. A simple
soul. A show woman. She is  really NO MORE PROFOUND THAN SHEENA EASTON, and you
can't imagine  Bush making a record that's as much fun (or vapid -ed) as &quot;SUGAR
WALLS&quot; (this  is getting funny...) or &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. When asked
if she might be a bit strange, she  says yes, she might be. I think not.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;After all, we all know `Kate', don't we? She's not strange, or barmy,
or  anything that's very far out of line. She just passes on her dreams; she
sets art to  rock. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And somehow, we find it all fascinating. Then we knock; but she does
not let us  in-a-her window.&quot;

<P>(Once again, the article was by Richard Cook, in the June 7 issue of Sounds.
(And  the article was called &quot;The Girl [sic] With the Stars in Her Eyes&quot;).
