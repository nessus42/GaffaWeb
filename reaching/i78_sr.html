<P>KATE BUSH: UNCAGED BIRD (THE KICK INSIDE REVIEW)  
</P>
<P>by Peter Reilly/STEREO REVIEW/1978 
</P>
<P>A lot of people are not going to like what they hear Kate Bush saying in her
new  album THE KICK INSIDE, about being a woman in the Seventies. And perhaps
even  more are going to object to the way she says it, for in many of her songs
she treads  on a territory (sex-as-sex-as-sex) long held to be a male preserve.
She does so with  the same brisk authority and self-possession that has
characterized at least some  British women since the days of Emmeline Pankhurst,
suffragist -extraordinaire-,  and for this reason she will surely offend a great
many men. 
</P>
<P>But probably as many women will be equally upset by Kate Bush's candor and 
honesty, though for a much different reason, the gallingly accurate one given by
 Germaine Greer in her book &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot;. Greer says that as
far as  women's rights and equality are concerned, they are an accomplished
fact, that  indeed for the last fifty years the cage has been open, -but the
bird has refused to  fly out-. Bush's frankness and sense of what a female
friend of calls &quot;gut nooky&quot;  will hardly endear her to those women who
still cling to the perch while making  complaining Tweetie-Pie denials of their
own sexuality. 
</P>
<P>What is different, however, about Kate Bush -- and what makes her songs 
important -- is not agitprop but excellence. With such songs as &quot;Room For
The Life&quot;,  &quot;Feel It&quot;, or &quot;L'Amour Looks Something Like You&quot;,
listeners know that they are in  the presence of a real person, a real woman who
lives in the here-and-now dealing  with life as it is being lived, not as it is
-supposed- to be lived in the perfume ads.  Bush's females are fully as hungry
as males are -- not in the angry, doomed, and  rather dreary way of the
romantic-gone-wrong of LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR,  but simply as healthy, alive
human beings with sensual and sexual appetites to satisfy.  And they are as
guiltless about expressing their hunger as most males have been for  years. 
</P>
<P>Consider this from &quot;Feel It&quot;: &quot;Feel your warm hand walking
around/I won't pull  away, my passion always wins/So keep on a-moving in, keep
on a-tuning  in/Synchronize rhythmn now...&quot; Or this from &quot;L'Amour&quot;:
&quot;I'm dying for you just  to touch me/And feel all the energy rushing right
up-a-me/ L'Amour looks  something like you.&quot; Bush performs these songs with
a direct sincerity in an  appealing, rather quavery, high-pitched voice that
communicates not lubricity but  the joy of satisfactory love-making. What we
have here is not the eye-rolling  lewdness of Xaviera Hollander (the greatest
management consultant of modern  times), the kinkiness of a Pauline Reage, or
even the brittle comedy of sexual  manners of an Erica Jong, but a human being
telling about one aspect of her  humanity. 
</P>
<P>There is a great deal more to Kate Bush and her album than matters sexual, 
however, and aside from two clinkers -- &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, a weary
rehash about  &quot;cruel Heathcliff&quot;, and &quot;James And The Cold Gun&quot;,
a song about 007 that seems as  deliberately nonsensical as the plots of some of
the Bond films -- all her songs have a  lively sense of truth-telling about
them. In the lovely &quot;The Man With The Child In  His Eyes&quot;, the
protagonist confesses. &quot;And here I am again my girl/Wondering what  on
earth I'm doing here/Maybe he doesn't love me/I just took a trip on my love for 
him.&quot; Probably the strongest song in the album is &quot;Room For The Life&quot;,
which in one  way is a call to those still-caged Tweetie-Pies and in another is
a simple statement of  the perils of freedom, liberation, and independence in
the life of any Seventies  woman: &quot;NIght after night in the quiet
house/Plaiting her hair by the fire,  woman/With no lover to free her desire/How
long do you think she can stick it  out/How long do you think before she'll go
out, woman/Hey get up on your feet  and go get it now/Like it or not we keep
bouncing back/Because we're woman.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Nobody's said it better than that in quite a while -- not even Katherine
Hepburn,  who was asked a few years ago if she missed having a home life because
of the  demands of her career and replied, &quot;Well, we can't have it all, can
we?&quot; Kate Bush  seems to know and to believe and, most important, to
communicate that what  women can have, if they are honest with themselves, is
quite enough. You've come a  long way, Emmeline baby! 
</P>
<P>(SysOp note: &quot;James And The Cold Gun&quot; has nothing to do with James
Bond)
