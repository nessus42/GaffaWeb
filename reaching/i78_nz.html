<P>Date: Sat, 8 Aug 1992 19:14:28 -0700 <BR> From: hobbs a@kosmos.wcc.govt.nz
<BR> Subject: &quot;NZ Listener&quot;, 2 Dec 78 interview with David Young 
</P>
<P>A few preliminary remarks: 
</P>
<P>I've been a lurker on .gaffa for 2 years now (hardly ever had email in all
that  time) and sometime in late last year I noticed Ron Hill's list of
interviews with her  Immortal Wutheringness that he didn't have yet - and on it
was one from my  personal favourite magazine, the NZ &quot;Listener&quot;. Well,
since I had no posting rights I  couldn't help Ron, but I resolved to chase up
this famous interview for myself. I  wended my way up to the National Library
and looked through their periodical  subject index. Sure enough, there it was
under &quot;BUSH, KATE&quot; - NZ Listener, 2 Dec  1978. So I requested said
issue, photocopied the relevant page and took it home to  treasure forever. 
</P>
<P>Well, this year I finally got posting access back, and I went to read my
beloved  .gaffa. Imagine my excitement when I saw that Ron still didn't have my
interview!  So... here it is. I hope you like it. If you do, do I get a place in
the Love-Hounds Hall  o' Fame or something? :-)

<P>HAUNTING KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>NZ Listener, 2 Dec '78 
</P>
<P>interview with David Young 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush had measles on her other visit to New Zealand; as a voyaging 
six-year-old with her parents. She saw little of this place. 
</P>
<P>This time, as writer and performer of the song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
the lady is  even more feverish and house-bound; the prime hostage of a
multinational record  company. 
</P>
<P>It is after 10pm at a party in a large, Hollywood-style ranch house on 
Wellington's wavering heights, Korokoro. She has been working all day, with some
 heavy-handed DJ's and a television special that will keep her spritely dancing,
roller  coaster vocals and haunting features before us until her second album is
released  shortly. 
</P>
<P>But pop music is the smile on the face of a savage tiger and Kate Bush,
EMI's  waif-like Topsy, is riding it with all the grace and energy her 20 years
can muster.  At this hour there is still no rest. In the mad dance of
merchandising she must move  at the party with those who will make her records
sell and keep them spinning  across the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>Click. Our turn. She extends red hysterical fingernails but the narrow eyes
are  calm and friendly. &quot;You've got five minutes,&quot; says EMI as she
settles on the vinyl  couch. Ah, well... 
</P>
<P>&quot; Wuthering Heights is really the only book in that era I've read; they
tend to be  extremely over-romantic in that period, especially the women.&quot;
The voice is Kentish  with a strong overlay of Cockney. &quot;I like a really
extensive story with levels; I enjoy  science fiction, especially Kurt Vonnegut.
He's a mixture of humour and tragedy... I  really like him.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She's sisterish and chatty. Relaxed. But there are no exclusive interviews
or  fantasies. Through the wall come all the beautiful people, women in boots
and high  dudgeon, men with shirt colars pasted over their jacket lapels.
Eyeballs and  flashlights popping. 
</P>
<P>Her manner is open to the point of vulnerability. Suggest that some songs
seem  to spring from folk and she is excited. &quot;Really? That's great. Folk
was my first  introduction when I was just a baby. My brothers were into folk
music, the  traditional English and Irish - it couldn't help but have an
influence on you when  you're so young. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In Ireland it's so strong, my mother's Irish and sometimes all day
there would  be fiddlers and everyone would dance in the garden. My brothers and
myself owe a  lot to her, she's got the musical gift and we're all into music.&quot;

</P>
<P>She has a bewitching way of fixing you with her conversational eye; it seems
you  have her undivided attention. Maybe her impeccable middle-class manners?
Her  father is a doctor and she grew up in pleasantly rural Plumstead, Kent. 
</P>
<P>Family is strong. A brother plays in her K.T. Bush Band. &quot;He's great,
he plays all  kinds of instruments, none brilliantly, but all well and he has
lost of musical ideas.&quot;  Her older brother, nearly 33, is a writer. &quot;Poetry
originally and now books and some  of it is really great.&quot; But little
published. 
</P>
<P>The faces press in on us as through a fish-eye lens, shimmering autograph 
hunters through a haze of cigarrette fumes. She tries to rally her ebbing
adrenalin  with a mug of tea. But... &quot;Yes, I would like a ciggy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>From an early age she was playing piano and by 14 had fused her interest in 
poetry, music and song-writing. Through contact with David Gilmour of Pink Floyd
 (whom she holds in awe) she won a contract with EMI by the time she was 16 and 
for three years remained unheard of, virtually in corporate captivity. 
</P>
<P>During this time she studied dance and mime, for a while under Lindsay Kemp.
 She did not know it but Kemp also tutored David Bowie who, together with Bille 
Holiday, her greatest inspiration. &quot;The first time I heard a song by Billie
Holiday I  just wanted to cry, she's so emotional.&quot; 
</P>
<P>A promotions manager comes across, &quot;You'll have to stop now.&quot; Just
a few more  minutes please? 
</P>
<P>She says wistfully, &quot;Sometimes I'd like a bit more time to myself. I'm
really  happy and I love to work, I think I need to and I feel good doing
something really  productive. I start feeling guilty if I'm wasting time.&quot;
Too many commitments is the  reason she gives for not having done a concert yet.
Until she does, suspicions will  linger that her music is as air-brushed as her
posters. But misgivings melt beneath  her candour. 
</P>
<P>There are frequent references to her occult in her music; to Beelzebub, to
her  love of the &quot;whirling of the dervishes&quot;, and even the invitation
in &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot; to &quot;let me grab your soul away&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's really interesting, that's an amazing thing about interviews,
they really  make you think. I am interested in the occult but not the negative
side of it. I really  don't know much about it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I believe we are controlled by forces... the moon and the stars.&quot;
And, as she  describes in &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;, seemingly purposeful
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>It is the witching hour. She must drill for her Christchurch performance 
tomorrow before sleep. At the ranchslider her female manager kisses her
goodnight.  &quot;I'll ring you in the morning.&quot; The blow-waved youth with
the monogrammed R  who has spooked her all night becomes the footman who shuts
her in a big Ford  emblazoned with Kate Bush and The Kick Inside. She waves and
the car disappears  into the hilltop rain and night. 
</P>
<P>If anything possesses her, it's EMI.
