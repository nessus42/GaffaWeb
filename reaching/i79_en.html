<P><STRONG>&quot;In Loving Memory From Kate And Friends&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P>A tragic accident almost wrecked Kate Bush's debut  tour this month, she
revealed today. </P>
<P>Kate and her band were rehearsing at Poole Arts Centre  on April 1 when
their lighting director slipped and fell  25 feel to his death from a gantry.</P>
<P>&quot;Kate was so upset that her first reaction was to want  to call
everything off.&quot; a friend tells me.</P>
<P>But she was persuaded to carry on. And now Kate is giving  a special show at
Hammersmith Odeon on May 12 in tribute  to Bill Duffield, the man who died.</P>
<P>With her will be two other friends of Bill -- Steve Harley, making  his
first British state appearance for two-and-a-half years, and  Peter Gabriel.</P>
<P>All profits will be given to a trust fund set up in Bill's memory.</P>
