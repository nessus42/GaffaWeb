</P>
<P>STAR PARTS 
</P>
<P>Source Unclear, Possibly The No.1 Book or Star Parts 
</P>
<P>Reprinted in Never Forever 19 
</P>
<P>by Phil McNeill 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill] 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush Isn't your everyday songwriter. 
</P>
<P>For years she's been regarded as one of the best in pop - as songs like  &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;, &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, and &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;
have proved.  Yet no one else has ever recorded one of her songs [several people
had actually  recorded Kate's songs by the time this was printed], and she
wouldn't know how to  write a hit single if she tried. 
</P>
<P>What's more, she reckons most of her lyrics leave most of her fans
completely  mystified. 
</P>
<P>Compared to hard-headed commercial songwriters like George Michael and 
Madonna, she's almost unworldly. 
</P>
<P>Like Prince, she's intensely private. When she spoke to us for The No. 1
Book, it  was her first and probably last interview of 1986. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't really like doing interviews,&quot; she confesses. &quot;People
have so many  preconceptions about me that even when they meet me they still go
away writing  about the preconceptions.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Even so, she answered our questions thoughtfully, trying to get to the art
of her  art: the songs. 
</P>
<P>ELTON'S INSPIRATION 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush signed a contract with Britain's biggest record company, EMI, at
the  age of 16, so it's not surprise to learn that she stared songwriting young.

</P>
<P>&quot;When I was about 11, I used to much around on my father's piano in our
house  in Welling, Kent. I got a tremendous sense of fulfillment out of it - it
just became an  obsession. I used to spend all my time writing songs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Because Kate was so young, she hadn't heard enough music to be influenced by
 other artists. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't really listen to music until I was a bit older,&quot; she
admits. &quot;my influences  were traditional, which is the music by brothers
Paddy and Jay were into.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When she did start listening to pop, she developed at least one thing in
common  with George Michael: a taste for ELton John. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I thought he was fantastic because at that time pop was mainly guitar
- I didn't  know anyone else playing the piano and writing songs. He was an
inspiration.&quot; 
</P>
<P>GETTING TECHNICAL 
</P>
<P>In those early days, says Kate, &quot;I used to just write at the piano.
It's changed now.  I've got my own studio and the production has become part of
the songwriting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>From being simple, songwriting has become a highly technical operation. With
 thousands of pounds worth of electronic equipment like a Fairlight and an
Emulator  - which between them can ape just about any sound on Earth - Kate's
songs can  start anywhere. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's quite difficult to say there's a certain way I write. I'm very
lucky to have so  many facilities - it's made a tremendous difference. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Commercial studios put so much pressure on you. You've always got
people  watching you, and it costs so much every hour. That makes me nervous.
The  freedom I have now is great. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What is also really good is that my boyfriend Del (Palmer) is an
engineer. So I  can go into the studio with an engineer who I feel totally
uninhibited with, and play  around with ideas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's songs usually start from a sound. The studio is her inspiration. 
</P>
<P>Take &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; for instance - that bewitching single with
just violins and  cellos marching behind Kate's fragile voice. Most artists
would write the song on  acoustic guitar or piano and then think, hey, that
would sound great with a string  sextet! Not Kate: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was just mucking about in the studio. I got a violin sound on the
Fairlight, and  wrote the tune on it. Then we replaced the Fairlight with real
strings on the record. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The words came after the music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>CLOUDBUSTING 
</P>
<P>This doesn't mean that Kate's words are less important than her music. If
they  seem hard to understand, that's because there's often quite a story behind
them. In  the case of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, it's a whole book... 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's not very often that I have actually written songs about books. &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot; is a well-known one. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But there's this incredibly emotional book I picked up years ago
called The  Book of Dreams by Peter Reich. He was the son of Wilhelm Reich, who
I suppose  you'd call a psychoanalyst. This book is about their relationship. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Reich had this theory about an energy called Orgone. He also had a
machine  he'd built that could make it rain. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a terribly sad book because people don't understand what he's
trying to do.  He ends up being arrested and dies soon after - and his son is
left without his father  who has been absolutely everything to him. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a true story. The book's so full of anguish, yet at the same time
there's  something happy about it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I very much wanted to capture the combination of happiness and sadness
in the  song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now that Kate explains it, it's possible to see some light in the song's
mysterious  phrases: &quot;I still dream of Organon... Every time it rains,
you're here in my head...  you son's coming out...&quot; 
</P>
<P>But does Kate seriously think any of her listeners will understand it
without the  explanation? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think it's incredible, the feedback I've got,&quot; she
replies. &quot;So many  people do understand it. I've had letters from so many
people who know about  Wilhelm Reich and his theories. Loads of people have gone
out and got the book -  even though it's out of print. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I actually contacted the man who wrote the book. I sent him a copy of
the  record and he was very kind about it. It was a very strange experience.&quot;

</P>
<P>MYSTERIES OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>So some people do understand - but what about the rest of us? Does it matter
if  people don't get it? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Kate replies. &quot;I think the most important thing is what
they feel when they  listen to it. THat's what music is really all about:
emotion.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Would Kate in fact agree that most of her listeners don't know what most of
her  songs are about? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I think that would be fair enough,&quot; she admits. &quot;It's
the same for me with a  lot of music I like. It's the feeling you get that's
important.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why doesn't Kate ever write straightforward love songs? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think that love is never straightforward,&quot; she parries. &quot;There
are lots of  tangent and consequences, and it can be very difficult to convey
all that in a  four-minute song. So often you have to cut at least half of them
out.&quot; 
</P>
<P>RUNNING UP THAT HILL 
</P>
<P>Kate's last LP Hound of Love was her most ambitious to date. The second side
 was a series of songs called The Ninth Wave which, as she puts it, &quot;all
tell a story  together.&quot; Now her studio is complete, she's eager to get
onto the next album. But  will her music change? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I have no idea,&quot; she admits. &quot;I don't know what will happen
until I go in there  and start mucking around.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In other words, Kate's songs control her as much as she controls them. &quot;It's
a  weird thing,&quot; she says, &quot;because you don't always like what you are
writing. I try  very hard now to write things I like.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That battle determines Kate Bush's whole life, because without her songs
there  would be no Kate Bush records, no Kate Bush videos, even fewer Kate Bush 
concerts and interviews than there are today... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; says Kate. &quot;Songwriting is the most important thing I
do. All the rest comes  out of it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's idea of a love song is &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. Although it
was a big hit,  few can have realized it was about two lovers swapping roles. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's the idea of two people, a man and woman in this case, who are
very much  in love,&quot; Kate explains. &quot;It's about the problem of not
being able to understand what  the other person means when they say something. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's a kind of delicacy that arises in extreme emotion. When you
feel a  great deal for someone, you're more likely to be upset by something and
take it the  wrong way. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And the whole idea is that if you could be that person in a
relationship, looking  at yourself, you would know exactly what was going on.&quot;

</P>
<P>So why the phrase &quot;running up that hill&quot;? [This is the only time
that I know of  that Kate was asked this seemingly obvious question.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's meant to be the positivism of going somewhere. Climbing up a
mountain,  going up. It might be hard but you are getting there.&quot; 
</P>
<P>HOUNDS OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>And while we're on love songs - &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is about fear of
being in  love...? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; says Kate. &quot;It's about running away from being caught,
being frightened of  being trapped. I think everyone is afraid of love, of
emotional commitment.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;And in the song it's treated like these hounds that you want to get
away from,  because you think they might rip you apart!&quot; 
</P>
<P>This sounds like the right moment to ask [as it does for most
interviewers!]: are  Kate's songs personal? 
</P>
<P>&quot;They always end up being personal,&quot; she hedges, &quot;because you
put a lot of time  into them. But I don't think they are autobiographical. Quite
often they are  observations of other people, or inventions - though they
obviously echo some of my  attitudes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>OUT OF THE GROOVE 
</P>
<P>One thing that's unusual about Kate Bush is that she never writes in
cliches. 
</P>
<P>Some writers do so quote deliberately. Madonna, for instance, puts together
a  series of little catchphrases like &quot;Get into the groove, boy you've got
to prove, your  love to me&quot;, and fills them with her own zest for life. The
listener can borrow those  phrases and use them to make themselves feel good, to
get them through the day. 
</P>
<P>Great pop writers like Madonna and George Michael use cliches in a good way
-  but all too many use them badly. Certain glib phrases crop up time and again.
Yet  Kate Bush has probably never used one of them in her life. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think that's quote a nice thing to say,&quot; she says. 
</P>
<P>Nice, but true. Kate seems to steer clear of the music business both
musically and  physically. Does she deliberately avoid outside influences,
especially whilst recording? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I think that's inevitable,&quot; she says, &quot;because it's...
an obsession. Once you  find the way into an album and you're involved, you just
can't get out. It drags you  along until it's finished. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I find there are always points where I don't want to go on. I'm always
really  glad when an album's finished.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Sounds like a slow process. How long does it take Kate to write a song? 
</P>
<P>&quot;They're such unpredictable beasts,&quot; she replies. &quot;Sometimes
it can be just an  evening - that's all it took to write 'Running Up That Hill'.&quot;
