Radio One Interview by Roger Scott 14th October 1989
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was interviewed by Roger Scott on Radio One on Saturday 14th 
October. I unfortunately missed the start of the interview, I just tuned in by 
accident, and only realised it was KT when I heard a reference to Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>What impressed me most about this interview was how excited KT sounded. She 
obviously really enjoyed this interview, quite a contrast to the NME interview
IED  posted recently. She was very open and revealing, really expressing her
feelings. The  interview was rather long and I will post it as a series of
several episodes. 
</P>
<P>Here is a transcription of the first part of the interview I heard, at
approximately  5.50pm. KT talks about the Trio Bulgarika and explains Rocket's
Tail. 
</P>
<P>KT: They all come from different parts of Bulgaria, they all come from
little villages  and they're very earthy people. They've all lived very full
lives, and they work  so hard. I've never worked with such hard-working
professional people, and I've  never worked with women before on that level
either which I found fabulous. It  was very exciting for me working with women
creatively. 
</P>
<P>&lt;Never Be Mine is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>KT: That whole process was incredible because I was really scared, I didn't
know if  it was going to work. We arrived in Bulgaria, and they didn't speak a
word of  English, and we didn't speak a word of Bulgarian, and the communication
was  really stunted to start with. Within 10 minutes they welcomed us into their
house,  so affectionate, and they sat down and sang one of their songs for us.
It was a  beautiful song, just the three of them sitting opposite this kitchen
table. The  eldest one Eva picked up this telephone and listened to the dialling
tone and went  &lt;tone&gt;, and they all took their note off the dialling tone &lt;laughs&gt;.
And then they  just burst into song and it was the most beautiful thing. It's
very rarely that I'm  moved by music enough to want to cry, and within minutes I
was sitting there  with tears running down my cheeks. I think in some ways this
was how we  communicated, not that it was that extreme all the time but it was
very much  emotional communication between us, no words could be used really,
and they  loved the fact that we were so moved, and working in the studio
consisted of  cuddles mainly rather than long conversations &lt;laughs&gt; and
it was wonderful. A  really special experience, I wouldn't have missed it for
the world, it definitely  affected me in a big way. I'm so honoured to have
worked with them, really just  so honoured with them as people as well as
musicians, because the music speaks  for itself. It's just so incredible to be
with people like that. 
</P>
<P>RS: What would be your choice for the song that would best demonstrate these
 voices? 
</P>
<P>KT: Most definitely Rocket's Tail. It shows the trio off the most, and
sometimes  when they're singing, if you're in the same room as them when they're
singing,  you can hear the air cracking, it's like there's so much harmonic
information in  their voices &lt;laughs&gt;. 
</P>
<P>RS: Tell me about that song then. 
</P>
<P>KT: About Rocket's Tail? Oh God, you would ask me about that one &lt;laughs&gt;.
I  wrote this for the trio, really, musically, in that I wanted a song that
could really  show them off. The other two songs that they appear on were
already structured  and in a way they had to very much fit around the song's
structure to become a  part of it, but this song they were there en masse,
really, the whole song was  based around them. And I wrote it on a synthesiser
with a choir sound and just  sang along. We put John's on and I had no idea if
their voices were going to  work on it at all, really, so the whole thing hung
on the fact of whether when we  went out to Bulgaria, whether it worked or not.
And the arranger we worked  with out there was such a brilliant man. In some
ways, I think that the fact that  we didn't speak the same language made our
communication much easier  because he seemed to know exactly what I wanted, and,
really, just after a few  hours he was coming up with the most incredible tunes,
and I just had to say &quot;Oh  yes, I like that one,&quot; &quot;Er, no, not
too kean on that one,&quot; &quot;Umm, that's lovely!&quot; and  just go away
and write it out. It was incredible, I've never worked like that  before, so
quickly with someone I've never met before. It was really exciting to  find that
kind of chemistry. 
</P>
<P>RS: Rocket is one of your cats. 
</P>
<P>KT: Rocket *is* one of my cats, and he was the inspiration for the subject
matter for  the song, because he's dead cute &lt;both laugh&gt;. And it's very
strange subject  matter because the song isn't exactly about Rocket, it's kind
of inspired by him  and for him, but the song, it's about anything. I guess it's
saying there's nothing  wrong with being right here at this moment, and just
enjoying this moment to its  absolute &lt;something&gt;, and if that's it,
that's OK, you know. And it's kind of using  the idea of a rocket that's so
exciting for maybe 3 seconds and then it's gone  &lt;phutt!&gt;, you know that's
it, but so what, it had 3 seconds of absolutely  wonderful... &lt;both laugh&gt;

</P>
<P>&lt;Rocket's Tail is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>RS: Is Rocket's Tail by Kate Bush, from her new album The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>	 Are you concious of time going by as you're making these records, because
the  gap between records seems to get a year longer every time? If we go right
back  to your first and second albums there seems to be an extra year go in
there every  time. Are you concious of it, or do you just put that out of your
mind? 
</P>
<P>KT: &lt;laughs&gt; Yes, I am very concious of it. I think it would be
totally impossible for  me not to be aware of it, because, you know, it just
gets worse and worse as time  goes on. My God, I'm never going to finish this!
And I think my tapes wouldn't  know what to do if they didn't have to sit there
fermenting - it's getting like  wine now, where I just leave the tapes as I go
off and do something else, and the  music kind of ferments by itself, you know.
&lt;laughs&gt; It's terrifying, I'd love to be  able to make an album in eight
weeks, I'm so envious of people who can make an  album that quickly, but I know
I wouldn't and if I did, I just don't think I'd be  happy with it unless I
drastically changed and then I might be able to. But this is  me, it just takes
me a tremendous amount of agony, I mean, the agony I go  through -it's pathetic,
you know, it's just a record, it just ten songs on a record... 
</P>
<P>RS: This song, _The_Fog_ on here, featuring your father as himself... 
</P>
<P>KT: &lt;laughs&gt; ...My first feature film. &lt;laughs&gt; 
</P>
<P>RS: A family affair, this album. Tell me about that song. I haven't quite go
the hang  of it, it's something to do with childhood, it's something to do with
childhood  memories and growing up and having to stand on your own two feet. I
think so  anyway, but can you tell me what you were thinking? 
</P>
<P>KT: Yes, well that's jolly good. 
</P>
<P>RS: Totally wrong, but... 
</P>
<P>KT: No, it's not. Again, it's quite a complex song, where it's very watery.
It's  meant to be the idea of a big expanse of water, and being in a
relationship now  and flashing back to being a child being taught how to swim,
and using these two  situations as the idea of learning to let go. When I was a
child, my father used to  take me out into the water, and he'd hold me by my
hands and then let go and  say &quot;OK, now come on, you swim to me.&quot; As
he'd say this, he'd be walking  backwards so the gap would be getting bigger and
bigger, and then I'd go  &lt;splutters&gt;. I thought that was such an
interesting situation where you're scared  because you think you're going to
drown, but you know you won't because your  father won't let you drown, and the
same for him, he's kind of letting go, he's  letting the child be alone in this
situation. Everyone's learning and hopefully  growing and the idea that the
relationship is to be in this again, back there  swimming and being taught to
swim, but not by your father but by your partner,  and the idea that it's OK
because you are grown up now so you don't have to be  frightened, because all
you have to do is put your feet down and the bottom's  there, the water isn't so
deep that you'll drown. You put your feet down, you can  stand up and it's only
waist height. Look! What's the problem, what are you  worried about? 
</P>
<P>[question missing here?]
</P>
<P>KT: Again, I think it's such a human condition, where we actually, a lot of
the time,  have such fear of things actually there's no need to be frightened of
at all. It's all  in our heads, this big kind of trap --- you know, that
actually it's not always as  terrifying as we think. Again, you know, it's meant
to be saying &quot;OK, so it can be  rough but there must be a way out --- it's
all right!&quot; &lt;laughs&gt; 
</P>
<P>&lt; The Fog is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>RS: Kate Bush and The Fog from The Sensual World . I got to stick this
question in  at some point, because everyone's saying &quot;When is he going to
ask her?&quot; I ask  you this every time and it's, &quot;Are you going to tour
this?&quot; --- are you going to  take it out on the road and 'do it'? 
</P>
<P>KT: It's a very good question... &lt;pause -- laughs&gt;. Umm... &lt;pause&gt;...
I really enjoyed  touring and this is so ironic. Everyone presumed I hated
touring and this is why  we haven't since. I wanted to spend time being a
songwriter and writing songs,  not re-creating songs that were already written,
in front of an audience. They're  two very different experiences. Touring is
very much about contact. Real contact  with an audience; with people. It's
really having a good time, and it's also quite  exhausting. It's a big
commitment and exhausting. 
</P>
<P>	 Now, music is completely different. It's very microscopic --- that thing
of taking  lots of little bits of time and putting them together: it's just not
running in real  time. It's very introverted and it is the actual process of
creation from scratch,  and that meant so much more to me over the last few
years than that contact.  And I think I've learnt a tremendous amount by being
in the studio for such  intense periods doing this. Not only have I learnt a lot
about the process of  writing and and working with music but I've learnt a lot
about myself, I think.  But I do miss the human contact of touring and it really
scares me --- the idea of  performing live --- because I haven't done it for so
long and the odd times I  have, I felt very uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>	 I'd really like to tour again but I'm terrified of committing myself at
this point,  but I guess this is one of the first points for a long time I'm
actually starting to  think &quot;...it could be fun!&quot;. So the answer, in a
short way... 
</P>
<P>RS: ...is &quot;maybe&quot; 
</P>
<P>KT: ...is &quot;I dunno&quot;! &lt;laughs&gt; 
</P>
<P>RS: Only do it if it's going to be fun. 
</P>
<P>KT: Yes. 
</P>
<P>RS: Don't do it if it's going to be a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>KT: Yes, and I think another reason why I haven't is I haven't been sure
about that.  You're absolutely right. 
</P>
<P>RS: I must ask you this --- you must know what this one's about. It's called
&quot;Heads  We're Dancing&quot; and... I read the lyrics here --- well, no, I'm
not going to read  them out but you just tell me what gave you the idea for this
song. 
</P>
<P>KT: This is the darkest song on the album and I think, in some ways, it's
not a song  I would write now. But I had a friend who went to this dinner, years
ago. He was  sitting next to this guy all evening and they were chatting ---
they had some of  the most incredible conversations: he was so impressed with
this guy. He was so  intellectual and charming; so well-read, you know. He just
thought this guy was  perfect --- the chemistry between them... wonderful! They
talked all night. And  the next day, he went up to his friend who had arranged
the evening and he said,  &quot;Who was that guy I was sitting next to last
night? He was fascinating!&quot; And the  guy said to him, &quot;Oh, didn't you
know? That was Oppenheimer!&quot; And my  friend's reaction was absolute horror,
because he had no idea. 
</P>
<P>	 And if he had known, he said he would never have behaved like that. He's
not  even sure he would have spoken to the guy because he had such strong
feelings  of hatred for everything that man represented. I thought that was
really a bizarre  and interesting situation, that he should really have liked
this guy. He was sitting  there with this person and he really liked him. But as
soon as he knew the guy's  name, he almost wanted to throw up in absolute
disgust, he was so turned off by  what this guy represented. And I thought, in
some ways it must have been a  wonderful relief for Oppenheimer that night. 
</P>
<P>	 I think he himself perhaps paid the price --- you know what I mean? He did
not  have an easy conscience, that man. And I was thinking this was very
interesting:  the idea of someone you found so charming, and later you find out
they're the  most horrific thing you can imagine. And I thought, well, this is
kind of like the  devil, isn't it? Where the devil is meant to be very
sweet-spoken, very charming,  very good looking! Everything that's kind of
attractive in order to tempt ---  temptation is an attractive thing. And I
thought, what about the idea of someone  who dances with the devil? And then I
thought, you can't, you know --- it has to  be a human. 
</P>
<P>	 Who is the nearest thing to the embodiment of the devil? It's Hitler: he
is the  personification of evil, as far as you can think of a single being out
of history. It's  a very dark idea, but it's the idea of this girl who goes to a
big ball; very  expensive, romantic, exciting, and it's 1939, before the war
starts. And this guy,  very charming, very sweet-spoken, comes up and asks her
to dance but he does it  by throwing a coin and he says, &quot;If the coin lands
with heads facing up, then we  dance!&quot; Even that's a very attractive &quot;come
on&quot;, isn't it? And the idea is that she  enjoys his company and dances with
him and, days later, she sees in the paper  who it is, and she is hit with this
absolute horror --- absolute horror. What could  be worse? To have been so close
to the man... she could have tried to kill him...  she could have tried to
change history, had she known at that point what was  actually happening. 
</P>
<P>	 And I think Hitler is a person who fooled so many people. He fooled
nations of  people. And I don't think you can blame those people for being
fooled, and  maybe it's these very charming people... maybe evil is not always
in the guise  you expect it to be. 
</P>
<P>&lt; Heads We're Dancing is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>RS: As Kate was saying, a very dark song: Heads We're Dancing , from her new
 album, The Sensual World . Well, from that, let's move to this truly beautiful 
song right at the end here, called This Woman's Work , which you've done with 
the orchestra. This one I can't get to grips with, either. What it is she's just
 done; whether she's expecting; or exactly what's going on in this. All I know
is: I  hear it; it's a beautiful song; but I can't quite get to grips with it. 
</P>
<P>KT: All right. John Hughes, the American film director, had just made this
film  called &quot;She's Having a Baby&quot;, and he had a scene in the film
that he wanted a  song to go with. And the film's very light: it's a lovely
comedy. His films are  very human, and it's just about this young guy --- falls
in love with a girl,  marries her. He's still very much a kid. She gets
pregnant, and it's all still very  light and child-like until she's just about
to have the baby and the nurse comes  up to him and says it's a in a breech
position and they don't know what the  situation will be. 
</P>
<P>	 So, while she's in the operating room, he has so sit and wait in the
waiting room  and it's a very powerful piece of film where he's just sitting,
thinking; and this is  actually the moment in the film where he has to grow up.
He has no choice.  There he is, he's not a kid any more; you can see he's in a
very grown-up  situation. And he starts, in his head, going back to the times
they were together.  There are clips of film of them laughing together and doing
up their flat and all  this kind of thing. And it was such a powerful visual:
it's one of the quickest  songs I've ever written. It was so easy to write. We
had the piece of footage on  video, so we plugged it up so that I could actually
watch the monitor while I was  sitting at the piano and I just wrote the song to
these visuals. 
</P>
<P>	 It was almost a matter of telling the story, and it was a lovely thing to
do: I really  enjoyed doing it. 
</P>
<P>RS: Has the film been out yet? 
</P>
<P>KT: Yes. I don't think it was released here. It was released in America and
did OK,  but not really as well as his other films, which have been very
successful. But it  was a lovely thing to be asked to write for, because it was
such a moving piece of  film and I really like writing to visuals as well --- I
find that very exciting. 
</P>
<P>&lt; This Woman's Work is played&gt; 
</P>
<P>RS: Just to conclude, you said earlier that the making of this album and the
years of  work that have gone into this, that one thing that came out of it, you
did learn a  lot about yourself. What sort of things have you learnt about
yourself over the  past three or four years? 
</P>
<P>KT: Um, well that's a very &quot;up front&quot; question there, Roger! And I
suppose, I don't  think I would have said after the last album &quot;this is
just an album&quot;. That's a very  important thing for me to have learnt: I am
very obsessive about my work. I  spend most of my time working, and I think this
is something that I've really  looked at in the last few years: there's a lot
more to life than just working and  just making an album. It is just an album,
it's just a part of my life. It's not my  Life. And I think it was, you know...
making albums was my life and it doesn't  feel like that is any more. And that's
tremendous, the sense of freedom that that  gives me. It's so good and I think
it's really healthy and much better for me, to  try and put these things into
perspective, you know. 
</P>
<P>RS: Right. Let us conclude with Deeper Understanding here... just fill me in
on that  one. 
</P>
<P>KT: This is about people... well, about the modern situation, where more and
more  people are having less contact with human beings. We spend all day with 
machines; all night with machines. You know, all day, you're on the phone, all 
night you're watching telly. Press a button, this happens. You can get your 
shopping from the Ceefax! It's like this long chain of machines that actually
stop  you going out into the world. It's like more and more humans are becoming 
isolated and contained in their homes. And this is the idea of someone who 
spends all their time with their computer and, like a lot of people, they spend
an  obsessive amount of time with their computer. People really build up heavy 
relationships with their computers! 
</P>
<P>	 And this person sees an ad in a magazine for a new program: a special
program  that's for lonely people, lost people. So this buff sends off for it,
gets it, puts it in  their computer and then like &lt;pyoong!&gt;, it turns into
this big voice that's saying to  them, &quot;Look, I know that you're not very
happy, and I can offer you love: I'm  her to love you. I love you!&quot; And
it's the idea of a divine energy coming through  the least expected thing. For
me, when I think of computers, it's such a cold  contact and yet, at the same
time, I really believe that computers could be a  tremendous way for us to look
at ourselves in a very spiritual way because 
</P>
<P>	 I think computers could teach us more about ourselves than we've been able
to  look at, so far. I think there's a large part of us that is like a computer.
I think in  some ways, there's a lot of natural processes that are like
programs... do you  know what I mean? And I think that, more and more, the more
we get into  computers and science like that, the more we're going to open up
our spirituality.  And it was the idea of this that this... the last place you
would expect to find love,  you know, real love, is from a computer and, you
know, this is almost like the  voice of angels speaking to this person, saying
they've come to save them: &quot;Look,  we're here, we love you, we're here to
love you!&quot; And it's just too much, really,  because this is just a mere
human being and they're being sucked into the  machine and they have to be
rescued from it. And all they want is that, because  this is 'real' contact. 
</P>
<P>RS: Let's hear the song: Deeper Understanding , Kate Bush, from her Sensual 
World album. Kate, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>KT: Thank you.
