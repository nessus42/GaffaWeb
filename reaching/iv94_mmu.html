Subject: Muchmusic Special Jan. 1994 
</p>


<p>The Muchmusic special on the Mighty Kate last night was pretty interesting. A lot 
of it was old interview footage, where the tape must be shredding because it has 
been shown so many times, but there was some new interview footage from Dec./93 
- presumably done on the same trip where Kate B. did the in-store in New York. 
</p>


<p>The part that I found particularly interesting was a short clip of an interview 
with Del Palmer, also from Dec./93. Suffice it to say that Del used the royal &quot;we&quot; a 
lot, and if you didn't know better you would think that Kate hid in her room until 
Del invited her to sing in pubs with the KT Bush band, that she would have 
continued to record in expensive studios until Del had the brilliant idea of expanding 
the demo studio, and that she never would have come up with the idea of things like 
using the Fairlight on her own! I was just waiting for him to say something like it 
was actually him in that racy costume in the Babooshka video :) since he seemed to 
have a very high opinion, justified or otherwise, of the importance of his 
contributions to Kate's work. 
</p>

<p>The new interview footage was not really insightful except that the interviewer 
(Janna Lynn White? who?) seemed pretty airheaded and Kate looked (blasphemy 
about to occur) really horrid - tired and puffy. I hope it was just bad lighting or 
something. 
</p>

<p>The show included clips (not the whole videos) from pretty well all the videos. 
What I found annoying was that they just showed a part of the &quot;new&quot; Rubberband 
Girl video. It looked really cool! I wanted to see the whole thing! 
</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's my review.... 
</p>

<p>Cheers, Fiona
