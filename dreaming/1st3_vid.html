    <P>&gt; Oh well, your collection sounds quite interesting no matter what.
    </P>
    
    <P>The Dutch videos for &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; are actually really
      excellent. They are significantly better, I think than other early Kate
      Bush videos. The Dutch video for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is much
      better than the promo video -- it seemd to have a much higher budget. The
      other ones are all much simpler, and probably had a small budget, but they
      are very well done and don't appear to be as hastily done. All of Kate's
      early promo videos, and most of her other ones (or at least &quot;The
      Dreaming&quot;) were each filmed in one day. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Videos </P>
    
    <P>A few comments and questions: </P>
    
    <P>First off, KaTe is MORE beautiful than ever when you can see her moving
      around, not just frozen in stills on her albums. If only.... Oh well.
      Hopefully I'll get the chance to see her in person (if not up close) on
      Tour of Life II, right IED? </P>
    
    <P>I must say that the flesh coloured leotard in The Man With the Child in
      his Eyes was quite, um, surprising until I realized that it WAS a leotard.
    </P>
    
    <P>Two questions about the Breathing video: is the backing spoken vocal the
      description of a nuclear blast (that's what it sounds like)? And are those
      Kate's brothers (or some of them, and the rest of the band) in the lake
      with her? </P>
    
    <P>Are the fragments of live performance in the Wow video from the Tour of
      Life? Is this a slightly different version of the song? I liked it
      better.....really! </P>
    
    <P>Is there any &quot;valid&quot; compilation of videos that has the &quot;moors&quot;
      version of Wuthering Heights and the &quot;Wogan&quot; version of Running
      up that Hill ? The masks in RutH were interesting, seeming to indicate
      being lost among her imitators..... </P>
    
    <P>While I noticed that Kate was quite dramatic with her expressions in
      several ov the videos, I thought the bug-eyed stance in Sat In Your Lap
      rather ridiculous looking, to say the least. Probably the only bad thing I
      found in all of them.... Did anyone else notice the &quot;See no Evil, Say
      no Evil, Hear no Evil&quot; relationship between Kate and the two jesters
      on either side of her during the latter sections of SIYL ? </P>
    
    <P>I did find one other thing I didn't like in the videos....is there some
      significance to her jerky, clockwork motions in Babooshka ? I really
      didn't care for them. Is the Bass symbolic (to do with Del perhaps?) </P>
    
    <P>Overall, I loved the videos, I HAVE to get a VCR and a (legally bought)
      copy of this tape. </P>

    <P> &gt;Are those Kate's brothers (or some of them, and the rest of the
      band) in the lake with her? </P>
    
    <P> One is. Paddy, one of her two brothers, is in the lake scene (and the
      scenes after that). Her other brother John, does not appear in the video.
      Also in those final scenes are Brian Bath and Stewart Avon-Arnold; and
      there are three other men in the video. IED doesn't know them off-hand by
      face, but presumably they were among the musicians who played on the
      track. One of them looks a little like Roy Harper to IED. Harper sang
      backing vocals on the track. But IED could easily be wrong about that ID.

    <P>Greetings again, all. And special thanks to Tracy and Andrew for making
      the Santa Cruz bash such a success. </P>
    
    <P>At long last I've started acquiring copies of the official videos on
      laserdisc for careful perusal. Those discs at the party, Corey, were
      Andrew's, not mine, and our gratitude should be rightfully be his. </P>
    
    <P>At any rate, I present installment #1 of Dave's Excessively Trivial
      Observations On Kate's Video's. </P>
    
    <P> Breathing </P>
    
    <P>Well *I* think the sun-people scene represents a birth into the
      post-nuclear world, whose twin suns represent the H-bomb blast as well as
      the sun itself. After all, the narration does refer to the initial flash
      as &quot;brighter than even the sun&quot;. And of course, Kate approaches
      them wearing the umbilical-cord suit while they dangle a bunny-suit of the
      type we see everyone wearing at the end. But hey, who expects clear and
      exquisite imagery in a Keef video? </P>

      <BR> Subject: The Innocents/The Infant Kiss Video </P>
    
    <P>Hello Chris here; </P>
    
    <P>Uh-oh - there goes my humility - right out the window - oh well, (sigh),
      ... a few years ago the sound company I worked at bought a VHS video
      editing system. As soon as it was set up I went to work with a copy of the
      film &quot;The Innocents&quot; and a cassette of &quot;Never for Ever&quot;
      and started to make a video for &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;. 200 hours and
      3 complete re-edits later, I sent a copy to Kate's brother John (who has a
      multi-standard VHS VCR &amp; TV). </P>
    
    <P>I'd finally quit my awful job the day before. Kate-Fans were visting
      from St. Louis, so I was at home when the phone rang. It was Kate. Luckily
      I'd hooked up a recorder to the phone the week before. Unluckily, Vickie
      wasn't home. As I fumbled for the record button I said, breathlessly, &quot;Hi
      Kate&quot;. The look on my friend's (Mike Weaver) face was classic. We
      chatted for 10 minutes about my video, and about video and editing in
      general. Well to be perfectly honest- she chatted; I babbled. I sounded
      like Porky Pig. Buh-de buh-de buh-de. She said &quot;well I've tried
      calling a couple of times before but there was no answer. I was probably
      calling at terrible hours of the night.&quot; I told her &quot;no it's one
      in the afternoon here&quot; and she said &quot;oh good - then it's
      civilized.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>She is extremely pleasant and very nice. But all of you knew that
      already. She got a kick out of my flusterment - she said &quot;are you
      having a good time?&quot; and giggled. Kate said that she'd watched the
      video several times. I glowed. I bounced. She said &quot;Bye!&quot; </P>
    
    <P>I'd like to think that I might have had something to do with her
      decision to direct her own videos and use a &quot;filmic&quot; style. I
      have two theories about this depending on the state of my ego: </P>
    
    <P>1: She liked it and it inspired her. </P>
    
    <P>2: She thought &quot;well if this bozo can make one anyone can&quot;.

    <P>Gary Hurst died of AIDS at the end of January. &quot;Gary's
      contributions to Kate's visual presentations have been enormous, since he
      was first recruited to take his place with Stuart Avon Arnold as the
      dancers for the Tour of Life in 1979. His first video was. .. 'Them Heavy
      People,' and he appeared in almost every video of Kate's since which
      required a dance routine. Indeed he can be seen in the clip for 'Love And
      Anger,' his last contribution to Kate's work made only weeks before his
      untimely death.&quot; </P>

    <P>Hello there Richard-- </P>
    
    <P> As a reply to your inquiry regarding my KT video...yes, it DOES include
      the &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot; video, with Kate curled up in
      the oversized wicker chair in her foxy red snuggies. (*grin*) I thought it
      was pretty interesting as well. How in the world does she manage to look
      so secutively innocent like that?? :) </P>
    
    <P>The tape also includes the video for &quot;Delius&quot;, but (if you ask
      ME), it's much more than a short clip...the video continues for most of
      the song. And I'm not ashamed to tell you that I was absolutely SPELLBOUND
      watching it. The sight of Kate, with that white gown all floating and
      gauzy around her, was breathtaking. Perhaps the lovliest I'VE ever seen
      her... </P>

    <P>Vol. 1990 No. 5 of CD International has just come out, and it has Deb
      Wentorf's article. In addition, there is a review of the Live at
      Hammersmith laserdisk. I don't know who wrote it: </P>

    <P>USA: not released England: not released Germany: not released Japan:
      MP102-15EM (EMI Music/Pioneer) </P>
    
    <P>With all the attention Kate Bush gets in this issue some of you must be
      already sick of her, but don't miss this live show even if you pass on all
      of her records. Taped on May 13, 1979 at London's Hammersmith Odeon
      Theatre, it will probably remain the all-time recorded highlight of Kate's
      creativity. From the opening song until the final bow, she doesn't stop
      for a second changing costumes, moods and movements, song after song. Once
      the captivating Wuthering Heights was over (during the audience's standing
      ovation), I just started watching the whole disc over one more time. I don
      not belong to the Kate Bush fan club, but I do know a sincere performance
      when I see one, and this concert is quite high on my list. </P>

    <P>The new issue of Pulse! (May 1991) just arrived at Tower Records, and
      there are several mentions of Kate: </P>
    
    <P>A review of the Hammersmith video in the Music Video column. In fact the
      headline reads &quot;Videos from pioneers Gabriel and Bush cause for
      celebration.&quot; After discussing Peter Gabriel's POV, Barry Gutman
      writes: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Also a long time coming was the recent rerelease, at an affordable
      price, of Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon (EMI Video/19.98 for
      videocassette). This 52-minute performance was videotaped 12 years ago,
      only two albums in Bush's careeer; her talents as a dancer, choreographer
      and mime made her a natural pioneer in the then-fledgling home-video music
      industry. Video is, in fact, the best medium through which to appreciate
      Bush -- even today. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I often can't decipher her high, veddy English trill without a
      lyric sheet. But whether reading along or not, it's very easy to
      appreciate her bewitching countenance, fluid body English and bold,
      dramatic, strikingly imaginative conceptual skills. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Clad in an array of costumes, including trenchcoat, harem pants,
      black leathers, cowgirl suit and sleeveless gown, Bush twirls through
      several numbers from her first two albums, supported by two male dancers,
      an illusionist/mime, two backing vocalists and a seven-piece band. She
      hasn't toured since this show was shot, and it's not hard to see why
      --such a production, at least as lavish as a small-scale musical comedy,
      would probably be too expenive to tote around the world. Rumor has it that
      Bush may, in fact, tour in support of her next album. Meanwhile, this and
      her other home video release are highly recommended -- even more so than
      her albums -- to newcomer fans as well as the already converted.&quot;

      <BR> Subject: Early Tour of Life review 1979 </P>
    
    <P>At the San Jose Katemas, IED did not remember having ever seen the
      review of the London opening of the Tour of Life that appeared in THE
      GUARDIAN next day. Memory may not have served that afternoon, and the
      following might be redundant, but it's relatively short and an interesting
      'take' on Kate from the days when nobody knew WHAT was coming at them yet.
    </P>
    
    <P>THE GUARDIAN, April 17, 1979 </P>
    
    <P>PALLADIUM </P>
    
    <P>Robin Denselow </P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>IN SO FAR as stardom can ever be instant, Kate Bush is the instant star.
      Others may start at the bottom, slowly gaining confidence and success, but
      she has been launched right in there at the top. </P>
    
    <P>She may have a string of hit singles and awards behind her, but that's
      still no substitute for live performance. This was a massive gamble, and
      it almost succeeded magnificently. </P>
    
    <P>For her first London performance she was given dance and mime lessons,
      lengthy rehearsals and technically inspired special effects to help her,
      and as a piece of musical theatre alone the result was unevenly
      spectacular. </P>
    
    <P>She sang for rather too long--well over two hours--and changed her set,
      clothes and image for almost every song. There were back projections, male
      dancers, clowns and illusionists, and Miss Bush pranced among them all
      with the boundless self-confidence of a very sexy and knowing gamin. </P>
    
    <P>But the real surprise of the show, apart from her ability to behave as
      an unflappable old trouper, were the innovations in rock choreography and
      microphone design. She sang while dancing, while being thrown around by
      male dancers, and while acting out an endless series of elaborate cameos
      that included everything from cowboy scene to ancient Egypt, British army
      parachutists to dancing violins. </P>
    
    <P>Taken in short bursts, most of it was exceptional. What made the overall
      result less than perfect was the sense that theatrical styles were being
      played around with without enough sense of continuity--she clearly has the
      ability to write and star in a musical, and that could show her off better
      than distracted sketches. </P>
    
    <P>Then, of course, there's her music. She has some great songs, but that
      shrill acrobatic voice still becomes a little monotonous after so long,
      but those are minor quibbles. Kate Bush, live for the first time, was very
      impressive. </P>

    <P>Hi, </P>
    
    <P>I've promised to transscribe/late the following article that was
      presented in the German edition of the international 'Rock World' magazine
      2-93. Since Paul from Vienna has seen the English version I'll wait with
      my translation until he has decided to (or not to) transcribe his already
      English version. </P>
    
    <P>Anyhow, here's the German text: </P>
    
    <P>KATE BUSH </P>
    
    <P>Nun gut, vielleicht war sie der feuchte Traum eines jeden
      Lastwagenfahrers, aber Kate hat ihre eigene Karriere praezise gesteuert
      und zwar mit einer unverbluemten Individualitaet, die fuer sowohl Frauen
      als auch Maenner unerhoert war und sie weit ueber die Grenzen der
      anerkannten sexuellen (und sexistischen) Werte hinausfuehrte. In
      Interviews trat sie mit entwaffnender Ueberzeugung als neckisches &quot;verlorenes
      kleines Maedchen&quot; auf, aber sobald sie vor der Kamera stand, spielte
      sie das maennermordende Weib (oder die Prinzessin oder die Hexe oder die
      Verfuehrerin), ebenfalls mit verblueffendem Elan. Ihre Darbietung in &quot;Army
      Dreamers&quot;, wo sie sich um ein Cello windet, reicht schon aus, um sie
      zum sinnlichsten, wenn auch subtilsten, britischen aller weiblichen Stars
      zu erklaeren. Sie begriff sehr frueh, dass Video das ideale Medium fuer
      ihre wild wuchernden Phantasien war und ist, abgesehen von einer
      erstaunlich ehrgeizigen Tour am Anfang, konsequent iden Einschraenkungen
      jeder Live-Situation aus dem Wege gegangen. Schon das unterscheidet sie
      von den meisten anderen Kuenstlerinnen. Die aussergewoehnliche Sorgfalt,
      die Kosten und die Zeit, die sie fuer ihre Alben aufwendet, macht
      deutlich, dass sie seit der Stunde Null das Sagen hatte. </P>

    <P>And here is the English version: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Well, maybe she was every lorry driver's wet dream, but Kate
      dictated her own career moves with a forthright individuality that was
      almost unheard of for a man or a woman and took her way beyond the realms
      of established sexual (and sexist) values. In interviews she played the
      coy little-girl-lost scenario with disarming conviction, but put her in
      front of a camera and she plays the man-eater with stunning panache. Her
      performance with a cello on 'Army Dreamers' is alone enough to put her in
      the frame as the most sexual, if subtle, British female star of them all.
      She realised that video provided the ideal vehicle for her rampant
      fantasies and, apart from one astonishingly ambitious tour early on, has
      constantly avoided the limitations of live performance. This in itself set
      her apart from most other women artists and the inordinate care, expense
      and length of time she takes on albums leave no doubt that it is she who's
      called all the shots every inch of the way.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>by Colin Irwin, Rock World Issue 2/Vol 2 (Feb 1993), p.17. </P>
    
    <P>Factual question: I suspect the cello is from Babooshka. And I don't
      agree with the first statement! </P>

    <P>Uli's suggestion that the Rockflix video was most likely shot in
      mid-1977 seems an excellent one. IED buys the idea. As for the
      near-duplicate entries in IED's old videologue, Uli, you're right again:
      an error. The two entries describe the same Rockflix video, which IED
      understands is the one now available in Europe/England on a home video
      release. </P>

    <P>Hi! </P>
    
    <P>From the July/august 1995 issue of B-Side Magazine, this random review:
    </P>
    
    <P>[All typos mine -- though believe me, I corrected plenty while
      transcribing this! They're a great publication, but they need a copy
      editor BAD.] </P>
    
    <P>KATE BUSH LIVE AT THE HAMMERSMITH ODEON </P>
    
    <P>What a stylin' woman our lady of the fluffy crimped mane is! On this
      video, dating from 1979, she goes from tights to trenchcoat to top hat and
      gowns... a leather jacket, a sheepskin jacket, scarves and leotards whiz
      by before our adoring eyes. She even throws in goggles in case you harbor
      a flyboy fetish. </P>
    
    <P>Obviously this is for fanatics only: there's no other reason to get
      this. Kate Bush isn't someone you buy because you're merely curious: you
      either adore her every inch or you hate her and wish she'd stop shattering
      mirrors at 50 paces. Ever since I saw her perform on Saturday Night Live
      eons ago, I thought this was one weird and wonderful woman and where has
      she been all my life? Oh, hiding in Britain and not touring. The nasty
      girl: offering us aural chocolates and then slamming the visual box shut.
      Sigggghhhh. </P>
    
    <P>Still, you can soak in her visual presence on her many classy videos and
      with this concert. Since it was filmed back in 1979 the video quality is a
      touch pale, but since Kate glows so beautifully who cares. Her music
      sounds dated when you compare it to what she's recently concocted, but who
      cares. It's the voice that counts here and it's in fine form, she mostly
      opting for headset microphone instead of tying down her little hands to a
      hand held model. One glaring point is when she dances to herself singing
      on &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; ... but once you see how much she has to
      throw her body about in frantic dancing you realize there's no way she
      could sing too. The poor dear would break a lung! &quot;Feel It&quot;
      works best on an aural level 'cause it's just her voice and her piano.
      That's all we really need, right? </P>
    
    <P>The video takes advantage of the film medium by slashing the waiting
      period where she's changing her costumes, and by adding little visual
      tricks like double images (also dated, honeys). The audience is glimpsed
      once in a while: she _never_ speaks to them. But on the whole by the time
      she closes out with her amazing hit &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; you
      think Heathcliff, don't be no fool: let that girl in and forgive her!
      Especially if she's our Kate. </P>
    
    <P>She can call at my window anytime. It's open! </P>

    <P>----------------- </P>
    
    <P>B-Side is a wonderful magazine, perhaps the best music mag out there
      (imo). Their publishers and editors are all women, and they focus on
      artists like Kate (whenever there's something to say), Tori, Sarah
      McLachlan etc. as well as lots of others on the &quot;alternative&quot;
      side of things. Radiohead is on the cover of the current issue, for
      example. </P>

    <P>&gt; Speaking of the Kate Saturday Night Live appearance, I read
      somewhere that her performance on the show was &quot;controversial&quot;.
      Anybody know why? </P>
    
    <P>IED can only suggest why it MIGHT be considered controversial, though to
      date he has overheard no actual KT-on-SNL controversy. As far as IED is
      aware, Kate's performance of &quot;The Man With the Child In His Eyes&quot;
      on Saturday Night Live is the only one in which she makes a reference to
      intravenous drugs. While singing the line &quot;I just took a trip on my
      love for you&quot; she extends her right arm in front of her, makes a fist
      and grabs the arm with her left hand just above the elbow, as though
      preparing for an injection. Although Kate's SNL routine for the song is
      essentially the same as in earlier taped renditions, this particular bit
      of pantomime is exclusive to the SNL performance. </P>
