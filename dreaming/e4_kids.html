    <P>I have 2 small girls (3 yrs and 18 mos) who both love to watch my Kate
      videos. My 3 year old loves to dance along with Kate. Since then, my wife
      has become a little more tolerant and may be coming around... </P>

    <P>&gt; btw, my 5 year old son has fallen in love with Kate. He asks me:
      'Who is my girlfriend?', to which my only valid response is: 'Kate'. He
      has taken to hoarding the Sensual world CD's as often as he can. </P>
    
    <P>The only CD covers that my 1-1/2 year old (whose name happens to be
      Kate, for some reason!) recognizes are the KaTe ones. She likes to rifle
      through the CD crates, pull them out, and run around saying, &quot;Kate
      Boosh, Kate Boosh, Kate Boosh.&quot; It makes me happy! She knows them
      all, except for Never Forever, which may take some time - with no photo of
      Kate on the cover. - Greg Clark </P>

    <P>Here's another &quot;Kate first experience&quot;: My daughter, also
      named Kate (hmmmm...), is almost 5 and has always enjoyed Kate Bush. I've
      been playing it for her since she was born. She really enjoys listening to
      Kate Bush and expressing her interpretation of the music through dance.
      It's really quite amazing to watch what she does to a particular song. She
      makes quite the little Babooshka! </P>
    
    <P>Back a couple of years ago, she used to SAY that SHE was Kate Bush and
      would dance around trying to sing along and say, &quot;Daddy, listen! It's
      Me Bush!&quot; So, if nobody has seen or heard anything from Kate Bush
      lately... </P>

    <P>The other problem I have is that I am beginning to get sick of hearing
      Wuthering Heights. I thought this could never happen, but my 18 month old
      daughter has decided she likes copying Kate dancing. She says &quot;Keh
      Boosh&quot; over and over, pointing at the laserdisc player or disc. When
      Wuthering Heights is playing she does a remarkably credibly job of copying
      Kate. </P>
