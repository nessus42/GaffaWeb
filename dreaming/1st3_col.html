    <P> One little acknowleged Kate sample is on Peter Gabriel's Rhythm of the
      Heat; the female voice singing &quot;ah-ah-ah&quot; doubling Peter's voice
      right before the big african drum section. We don't have comfirmation on
      this, but a friend worked on one of Larry Fast's Fairlight Series IIs a
      number of years ago, and found some samples on it called &quot;KATEBUSH1&quot;
      and &quot;KATEBUSH2.&quot; </P>

    <P>We bought at Tower, and finally had a chance to listen to the &quot;Games
      Without Frontiers&quot; remix on the b-side of the &quot;Steam&quot;
      cassingle, and it's *GREAT*!!! It's *completely* different. The best I
      could do to describe it would be to say.....uh... ...something like....
      the &quot;acoustic dub&quot; mix. At first I thought that Kate was taken
      out altogether, but later in the song she comes in singing her part in a
      very soft, ethereal way. I'm sure it's not new vocals by either Peter or
      Kate, but I do think they are alternative recordings. You know Peter,
      he'll record something fifty million ways then choose which one to use. Oh
      to have free run of his archives! </P>
    
    <P>Btw, we didn't see a CD single, though I'm sure one exists. </P>

    <P> Incidentally, speaking of run-out-groove messages, there's one on Roy
      Harper's The Unknown Soldier LP (the highlight of which is a duet with
      Kate called You &lt;The Game Part II&gt;). It reads: &quot;With love to
      Kate, from Roy, x&quot; </P>

    <P>Date: Tue, 03 Apr 90 08:17:40 EDT
      <BR> From: JONES%RPIECS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: An answer for Declan </P>
    
    <P>Hello there Declan-- </P>
    
    <P>Saw your posting regarding the song &quot;Another Day&quot;, and
      couldn't resist replying since it happens to be one of my all-time
      favorite things that Kate's been involved with. The song was originally
      Roy Harper's, but Kate did an absolutely haunting duet with pal Pete
      Gabriel for Kate's 1980 (?) Christmas special, which was shown on BBC-TV.
      I managed to pick up a video of said Christmas special at a local record
      convention a while back, and although the tape has been PAL converted and
      the quality leaves something to be desired (to say the least), the quality
      IS still good enough to see what's happening. </P>
    
    <P>In the video, Gabriel and Kate are seated at a small breakfast table,
      with a tea set scattered between them. Both are wearing jeans and plain
      blouses. A screen in the background shows a film of the two of them
      dressed much differently, both in black (Kate in a long, slim black gown),
      and this film is almost like the thoughts which are going through their
      minds at the moment. (Sorry, it's all kind of hard to explain, especially
      since I don't have the lyrics but would REALLY like to). But their duet is
      GORGEOUS...very sad...but judging by the audience's response as the last
      note dies away, they obviously loved it. </P>
    
    <P>If you ever attend a record convention and see a tape labelled Kate Bush
      Xmas Special or something to that effect, ask the vendor to put in his VCR
      so you can catch a bit of it to check the quality. If the quality seems
      pretty good, and he's not asking more than $20-25 tops, it might be worth
      your while. This BBC Christmas special also shows our dear Kate
      singing/performing such favorites as &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;
      (appropriate for Christmas, right?), &quot;Ran Tan Waltz&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot;,
      &quot;The Wedding List&quot;, and a VERY neat version of &quot;Violin&quot;,
      which opens the show with Kate basically dressed in a bat's costume. If
      you can find it, a good time is promised for all! Enjoy!</P>
    
    <P>I realize this is a very long-winded response to such a simple question,
      but I always WAS one for chatting. :) </P>
    
    <P> All the best, </P>
    
    <P> Deb Wentorf </P>

      <BR> From: katefans@world.std.com (Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City)
      <BR> Subject: Lyrics to ANOTHER DAY....here you go </P>
    
    <P>Vickie here. Request and ye shall receive (most of the time) These
      lyrics came from the lyric sheet in Roy Harper's LP. I added the K &amp; P
      breakups when I submitted it to Break-Through about a million years ago. I
      already had it transcribed and on a floppy because a Cocteau Twins fan
      e-mailed a request for the lyrics a couple of months ago. I've left on
      part of the letter I wrote to him. </P>
    
    <P>Another Day </P>
    
    <P>written by Roy Harper </P>
    
    <P>Peter: </P>
    
    <P>The kettle's on, the sun has gone another day.
      <BR> She offers me Tibetan tea on a flower tray.
      <BR> She's at the door, she wants to score,
      <BR> She dearly needs to say, </P>
    
    <P>Kate: </P>
    
    <P>I loved you a long time ago, you know,
      <BR> where the wind's own forget-me-nots blow
      <BR> but I just couldn't let myself go
      <BR> not knowing what on earth there was to know.
      <BR> But I wish that I had,
      <BR> 'cos I'm feeling so sad
      <BR> that I never had one of your children. </P>
    
    <P>Peter: </P>
    
    <P>And across the room inside a tomb
      <BR> a chance is waxed and wanes.
      <BR> The night is young, why are we so hung up
      <BR> in each others chains.
      <BR> I must take her, I must make her
      <BR> while the dove domains
      <BR> and feel the juice run as she flies
      <BR> run my winds under her sighs
      <BR> as the flames of eternity rise
      <BR> to lick us with the first-born lash of dawn. </P>
    
    <P>Kate: </P>
    
    <P>Oh really my dear
      <BR> I can't see what we fear
      <BR> sat here with ourselves in-between us. </P>
    
    <P>Peter: </P>
    
    <P>And at the door we can't say more
      <BR> than just another day </P>
    
    <P>Kate: </P>
    
    <P>And without a sound
      <BR> I turn around
      <BR> and I walk away. </P>
    
    <P>Well, it's a bit obscure, but still very moving. In case you're curious,
      when K&amp;P did this live, they sat opposite each other at a kitchen
      table, in character, wearing the most bored, ho-hum, who cares,
      expressions on their faces. Between them, on the wall like a framed
      painting, is a video screen showing the characters as feeling, hurting,
      anguished human beings also sitting at a kitchen table. It's interesting.
      The foreground characters are acting the way a lot of people act when
      they're hurt. Put on an act and pretend it doesn't affect you. The
      background characters are acting out the emotions that the foreground
      characters are keeping bottled up. Pride keeps the couple from saying &quot;I'm
      sorry&quot; and trying to work it out. Love is lost. It's all very
      wasteful and sad. </P>
