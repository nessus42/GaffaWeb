    <P>It's not that difficult to come up with images like these. Here's a
      certified, guaranteed method for doing it: (1) Stay awake for 48 hours (2)
      Place a blank piece of paper and pen next to your bed (3) Eat 1 quart of
      Vlassic Deli Dill Pickles (4) Eat one pint of Ben and Jerries Dastardly
      Mash or Heathbar Crunch icecream (5) Put on the &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
      at a loud volume level (6) Go to sleep (7) When you wake up write down
      what you were dreaming about (8) Go to 5. </P>
    
    <P>When you wake up in the morning, you may find what you have written down
      on the paper to be quite strange! And you don't even need to bathe in
      goat's milk.... </P>

    <P>A friend of mine from New Jersey was up visiting for Xmas, and among the
      cassettes he brought with him was a tape of Comic Relief, the British
      Version, in which the Young Ones (from the BBC-2 tv show, which is
      amazingly juvenile and stupid, but insanely funny) poked a bit of fun at
      Kate. I can't remember the lines exactly but apparently Vyvyan was on the
      floor jumping on Neil... </P>
    
    <P>Mike: Vyvyan, get off. That's not Kate Bush, it's Neil! </P>
    
    <P>Vyvyan: It is not, Michael. Kate Bush is underneath, I'm using Neil as a
      contraceptive. </P>
    
    <P>Well, not exactly earthshaking I'll admit, but it was funny at the time,
      and ghod I'm bored... </P>

      <BR> Subject: More phun from &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; Steve Berlin... </P>
    
    <P>Some interesting facts about Kate Bush: </P>
    
    <P>o Kate Bush was a musical prodigy - her first album, &quot;The Kick
      Inside&quot;, was recorded when she was only 4 years old. </P>
    
    <P>o Kate is the shortest musician in Europe - a mere 18&quot; tall! </P>
    
    <P>o Although Kate has been popular in England, she was unable to get
      airplay in America due to the FCC's Minimum Height Regulations. This law
      was made in 1942 to keep Japaneese off the airwaves, and was not
      overturned until 1986, which allowed Kate to get her first American hit
      single. </P>
    
    <P>o Ms. Bush is in charge of all aspects of her live shows - From the
      choosing of the band members to the choreography to running the lighting
      board to being usher. </P>
    
    <P>o Yes, Kate Bush *IS* related to Vice President George Bush. However,
      George is the sole memeber of the Bush clan never to appear on any of
      Kate's albums. </P>
    
    <P>o If you play the last line of &quot;Leave it Open&quot; backwards, you
      can distinctly hear Kate say &quot;Paul has been dead for years.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>o Kate is heavily influenced by liturature. For example, &quot;Wuthering
      Heights&quot; is based on a novel by Harold Robbins. </P>
    
    <P>o Film is another large influence for Kate. Example: &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;
      is an ode to American International Films. </P>
    
    <P>o If you listen carefully to the second verse of the title track of &quot;The
      Dreaming&quot;, you can hear Paul Hogan drinking a Foster's. </P>
    
    <P>o The second side of &quot;The Hounds of Love&quot; is a concept piece
      about the endless arguments of pimply white males over which Kate album is
      better. </P>
    
    <P>o Kate has been married for three years to Jerry Lee Lewis. </P>
    
    <P>o Kate Bush, due to both her seasickness and her fear of flying, refuses
      to go to amusement parks. </P>
    
    <P>o The album &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; was released with 517 different
      album cover designs. </P>
    
    <P>o IED owns all of them. </P>
    
    <P>o Last but not least, Kate is doing the soundtrack to a film by Nicholas
      Rogue, based on his very popular computer game. </P>

      <BR> From: ugpoltr1@cs.Buffalo.EDU (Jim Poltrone)
      <BR> Subject: New Kate Bush album to be called &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Got his piece of news from someone I know in Britain (no, not IED): </P>
    
    <P>After three years since her album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, famed
      British performace artist Kate Bush has gone into studio to work on her
      most recent album, tentatively titled &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;. The
      album is scheduled to be released on 23 November 1988, the date which lots
      of people remember as the 25th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>For twenty-five years, the time lord has been flying through our skies,
      and our TV sets. Recently, the programme has not been one of the BBC's
      most popular shows, and some people have been leery that the programme
      would eventually be cancelled. </P>
    
    <P>However, according to the show's producer, John Nathan-Turner, there are
      plans for this season to be one of the best. &quot;We're very confident
      that this will be a banner year for the programme&quot;, said
      Nathan-Turner. &quot;In fact, to co-incide with the release of Kate's
      album, she is going to have a guest role in one of the stories this
      season. In fact, it's the first appearance of a musical artist since the
      Beatles over twenty years ago. One of my production unit managers, Gary
      Downie, has been a fan of Kate for some time now, and he's looking forward
      to working with her.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Kate herself is thrilled with being associated with the programme. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I remember seeing the very first Doctor Who, in November of '63.
      In fact, I used to hide behind the sofa a lot when the Daleks first
      appeared. John always used to taunt me about that. Since then, he's been
      following the show more closely than I have been. But it was Paddy's idea
      that I appear on the show, after Bonnie [Langford] had her stint. He said
      'You can do better than that'. So I talked to my agent about it, and he
      rang up Mr. Nathan-Turner.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It was after I landed the part that I thought of using Doctor Who
      as the basis for my latest album. I used to think of myself as Susan --the
      first companion -- and what it would be like to travel through time and
      space from a child's point of view. Each of the songs are going to be
      filled with a feeling of wonder and innocence.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>BBC-1 controller Jonathan Powell, when asked about the programme's
      future, said &quot;This doesn't mean we're changing the direction of
      Doctor Who into a song-and-dance variety show. We still plan on keeping
      the drama as the main feature. I feel having Kate Bush on the programme is
      a major coup for us, and given her popularity, it will mean a higher share
      of the ratings for the programme.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>(From the Guardian, 1 April 1988) </P>
    
    <P> [Dr. Who as the basis for a KB album??? Now, that's something I hadn't
      ever imagined!!! Hmmm.... -- |&gt;oug ] </P>
    
    <P>[Many people took this April-fool hoax for real and it caused some
      irritation. --WIE] </P>

    <P>&gt; From: Douglas Weiman &lt;WEIMAN@SRI-NIC.ARPA&gt; </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I can't wait until we discuss the meaning behind the word &quot;the&quot;
      in the title of Man with the Child... </P>
    
    <P> C'mon, Doug, don't you see it? It's very significant that Kate used
      'the' instead of 'a'. She is, of course, referring to a specific child, as
      opposed to some vague concept of 'child'. Naturally, 'the' child, without
      any other information, implies the Christ child. Now, any other writer
      might have capitolized it in the lyrics, i.e. &quot;The man with the Child
      in his eyes.&quot; But Kate, being the clever woman she is, doesn't want
      people to get everything handed to them on a silver platter, and so she
      *didn't* capitolize it, her intention being to confuse us in this matter.
      I hope this has cleared some things up. Next time: the use of the word
      'of' in &quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot;. </P>

    <P>Todd, perchance this will enlighten you.. </P>
    
    <P>In The beginning, There was only The musiK of KaTe, buT few Knew of iTs
      exisKTence, and fewer sTill undersTood The beauTy of her message. And for
      The few, much pondering was given To This and how her message mighT be
      shared. And from this a greaT plan was KreaTed, and This plan worKTed
      Thusly.. </P>
    
    <P>On The firsT day, man KreaTed The NET. And Then afTer much labor, man
      looKed down aT his KreaTion and said unTo himself, &quot;This is good, buT
      alone iTs exisKTence serves no purpose for KaTe.&quot; And so iT was ThaT
      on The seKond day, man labored again and placed inTo his NET many groups.
      And he allowed for These groups To range and feed from many far away lands
      so ThaT TogeTher They mighT form The Tree of all Knowledge. And aT The end
      of The second day, man looKed down on his KreaTions and said &quot;IT is
      good, buT This sTill does noT serve KaTe.&quot; And so iT was. Then, on
      The morning of The Third day, man seT unTo himself The TasK of finishing
      The NET by KreaTing and molding unTo iT a greaT paTch fashioned from The
      rib of one of The men. And a man Kalled IED gave This paTch unTo The NET
      and he named iT. And iT was Kalled &quot;reK.musiK.gaffa.&quot; And KaTe
      looKed down on This newesT KreaTion and saw ThaT iT was good. And on The
      evening of ThaT day, There was much rejoicing, for here man Kould have a
      place To refleKT on all ThaT was pure and good and beauTiful. And so iT
      was. </P>
    
    <P>Then, on The morning of The fourTh day, one of The men who had noT been
      paying much aTTenTion To all ThaT was pure and good and beauTiful looKed
      down and said unTo The NET &quot;whaT is all This?&quot; And The oTher men
      saw iT and spaKe unTo him, &quot;This is a place To worship all ThaT is
      pure and good and beauTiful. This is an alTer for KaTe Bush.&quot; And The
      man looKed aT Them and said &quot;KaTe who?&quot;, for he did noT yeT
      undersTand. And The oThers TooK iT upon Themselves To Teach This man so
      ThaT he mayesT also Know of The joys and wonders of all ThaT is pure and

      oTher Things. And The man Kould noT undersTand The joys and wonders of all
      ThaT is pure and good and beauTiful. And on The evening of The fourTh day,
      The man slepT lisTlessly, for even afTer much encouragemenT, he sTill
      Kould noT see. And The oTher men looKed down on This man and said unTo him
      while he slepT, &quot;He will learn, for he is sTill jusT a flegling To
      The Knowledge of The joys and wonders of all ThaT is pure and good and
      beauTiful.&quot; And so iT was. Then on The morning of The fifTh day, The
      man awoKe and his eyes were opened. And he saw and undersTood. And The man
      said unTo himself, &quot;WOW! man, This musiK is ToTally awesome!&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>And on The fifTh day, The man seT himself The TasK of learning more of
      The joys and wonders of all ThaT is pure and good and beauTiful. So he
      spaKe unTo The NET and said, &quot;show me more.&quot; And The oTher men
      saw This and They said unTo Themselves, &quot;IT is good.&quot; And on The
      fifTh day, much email was senT unTo The man Telling him again of The joys
      and wonders of all ThaT is pure and good and beauTiful. So The man
      lisTened, and wondered aT all ThaT was said unTo him. And The man, in his
      desire To learn more, Traveled afar and boughT all of The KaTe Bush musiK
      he Kould find. And he lisTened To iT all, buT again he Kould noT
      undersTand, even Though he ached for more of all ThaT is pure and good and
      beauTiful. And on The evening of The fifTh day, The man again slepT
      lisTlessly, for he sTill Kould noT see and ThoughT himself To be blind.
    </P>
    
    <P>BuT on The morning of The sixTh day, The man's eyes were again opened.
      And on ThaT day he undersTood and he rejoiced. The man Told many of his
      friends of The joys and wonders of all ThaT is pure and good and beauTiful
      so ThaT They mayesT also share Them. And many of Them ThoughT him To be
      Krazy. BuT he did noT Kare. And The man subsKribed To &quot;reK.musiK.gaffa&quot;
      and wondered ThaT he Kould have been so blind before. And Then, The man
      made This posTing so ThaT he mighT ThanK The NET and oTher men for helping

      lisTened again and wondered aT The greaTness of The musiK of This KaTe

    <P>March 25, 1985: Bill, now living in San Francisco, is hired by a major
      biotech firm. </P>
    
    <P>March 26, 1985: Bill &quot;discovers&quot; USENET. </P>
    
    <P>Early 1988: Bill &quot;discovers&quot; rec.music.gaffa while browsing
      .newsrc one day. &quot;&lt;Gasp&gt;... could it be?!!&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Early 1988, 90 seconds later: Bill overcome with joy. Comes down a
      little as he remembers that he cannot send mail from this site, but
      nevertheless elated. </P>
    
    <P>July 7, 1989: Bill leaves company, thinking he will hook into USENET via
      FidoNet in a matter of days. Wrong. Bill spends next months in travel;
      calls record stores every few weeks to check on TSW status; pretty much
      blows off work on his BBSs; generally maintains state of relaxed
      enjoyment, aided by obsKuriTies 2 (thanks IED!) and partially fueled by
      knowledge of an imminent release by KT. </P>
    
    <P>Oct 13, 1989: Bill learns of 10/17 release date. Some Friday 13th! (or
      perhaps an omen?) Finds self in state of euphoria; arranges temporary
      USENET connection and awaits validation on Monday; spends weekend
      literally tingling with anticipation; can think of nothing other. </P>
    
    <P>Oct 16, 1989: Three days out of warranty, Bill's CD player dies. Cannot
      possibly phase him at this point: No problem, will buy new one tomorrow.
    </P>
    
    <P>Oct 17, 1989: Finally validated. Bill demonstrates self-restraint of
      near-mythic proportions--does not even break daily routine until early PM.
      Downloads past month of L-H for later perusal. Buys TSW. Buys new Sony
      CDP-C8ESD. Straps both to rear of motorcycle and returns home. Savoring
      the sheer joy of the moment, brews coffee, hooks up new toy, inserts disc
      and even takes time to scan instructions and name disc. Pours coffee,
      turns off all computer equipment in adjoining room and thermostat in
      attempt to achieve near silence and turns volume on stereo way up. Has now
      been involved in this ridiculous foreplay for 20 minutes. </P>
    
    <P>Oct 17, 5:04pm: Bill presses &quot;play&quot; on remote control.
      Beautiful strains of tolling bells begin to emerge from the speakers. The
      earth begins to tremble. Suddenly, those possessions which are not already
      flying across rooms are cascading to the floor. At the instant Her voice
      enters this scene, the house is slammed by a single shockwave so violent
      as to defy description, and the music ceases. </P>
    
    <P>I spare you the ensuing progression of events. Suffice it to say the
      house still stands, it was 48 hours before my first listening and the
      final lines of my responses to the myriad &quot;What were you doing?&quot;
      queries were along the lines of &quot;...I know Her music's powerful,
      but...&quot;, &quot;...I knew Her Voice could make me tremble, but...&quot;,
      &quot;...incredibly moving...&quot;, &quot;...She really breaks new
      ground...&quot;, etc.(ad nauseum).</P>
    
    <P>So you see, Doug, for me, the two events shall forever remain
      intertwined. (You all were pretty sure I was going to eventually make some
      point or another, right?) ;) </P>
    
    <P>Thank you, Love-Hounds, for indulging me... </P>

      <BR> From: Michael Mendelson &lt;mendel@cs.uiuc.edu&gt;
      <BR> Subject: the laugh </P>
    
    <P>Obviously, the laugh is on the wrong album entirely! I suggest it is the
      result of a long, often fruitless fight between Kate and the record
      companies. For years, Kate has wanted to insert a laugh between tracks,
      and for years the record execs have nayed the proposition. </P>
    
    <P>Originally, the laugh was to go between Strange Phenomena and Kite on
      TKI. When this plan was nixed, Kate decided to place the laugh after Peter
      Pan on Lionheart. And after that on NFE at the very end of the album.
      Again, to no avail, but this time the execs met Kate half way and let her
      add a little extra bass at the end of Breathing instead. </P>
    
    <P>Despite the first three rejections, Kate endeavoured once more to
      include the laugh on TD just after Suspended in Gaffa. The execs dismissed
      this demand as unreasonably antagonistic towards the general public who
      would have a hard enough time figuring out just what Gaffa was (not to
      mention the &quot;WLTWI&quot; at the culmination of the very next track)
      without the added intimidation of a mocking laugh. </P>
    
    <P>So it was HoL where Kate was first able to sneak in the laugh, cleverly
      mixed *backwards* into the secret message in WYWM, the forward contents of
      which were discovered by fans only recently. Luckily, the record execs
      never discovered this laugh, although its effect is all but lost in the
      mix. But Kate was still unsatisfied, since she knew most people would
      probably never know the laugh was even there. </P>
    
    <P>TWS was the next candidate for the laugh, but since it had never charted
      as a single, the execs refused. Kate even volunteered to redo the laugh as
      a &quot;new vocal&quot; cut, but alas, no go. </P>
    
    <P>Finally, Kate had had enough. &quot;Look,&quot; she said, &quot;no more
      albums unless I get a full, uncut, forward, undistorted laugh on the next
      one.&quot; British execs gave in, but Kate had to change labels in America
      to have her demand met. </P>
    
    <P>But still, it wasn't easy... a full year of bickering about where the
      laugh should go on the new album ensued and caused unprecedented delays in
      release. And now we see the fruits of Kate's effort: the laugh, in full,
      is indeed a part of TSW. But in attaching the laugh to different songs on
      the two pressings of the CD, and omitting it entirely from the single and
      the video, it looks like in the final analysis the bigwigs still had the
      last laugh. :-) </P>

      <BR> From: aurs01!aurxc3!whitcomb@mcnc.org (Jonathan Whitcomb)
      <BR> Subject: A little history... </P>
    
    <P>&gt; 1. Is this group JUST for Kate? It appears to be totally obsessed
      with her. </P>
    
    <P>Actually when this group was founded 72 years ago in Sri Lanka it was
      originally intended for afficianados of hunting dogs and other canines
      pressed into manual labor. The orignal name of the group was &quot;Amos
      Canis Woofis&quot;, and was written on dried leaves and spread from town
      to town by passing merchants. Occasionally, some of the written passages
      were so controversial that readers would burn the leaves in anger, leading
      to the modern term &quot;flaming&quot;. Many found that inhaling the smoke
      of the burning leaves caused a hallucanatory effect, and thus smoking
      leaves became more popular than reading them in some areas. </P>
    
    <P>Traffic on the group was light, but started to pick up in the 60's when
      some of the free love fringe mistook the title (by then &quot;Hound-Lovers&quot;)
      to imply more intimate relationships between man and his best friend. The
      name was then changed to &quot;Love-Hounds&quot; to avoid any further
      confusion. </P>
    
    <P>By 1986, the group was an entirely electronic media, and the release of
      Kate Bush's &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; album brought so much traffic to
      discuss this album and the artist that the original hard core group of
      hunting dog fans split off to form another group, the well known and
      highly read rec.pooches.kill.bad.deer.yeah. Since that time the Kate Bush
      crowd has dominated the group, although lately it seems that a religious
      cult based around holy relics created, used, or discarded by the recording
      artist is gaining favor. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; 2. Where did the group creators get the word &quot;gaffa&quot; and
      what does it mean? </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Gaffa&quot; (as has been explained ad nauseum in this forum) is
      another Sri Lankan word referring to the mental state achieved by those
      smoking too many of the leaves this group was originally printed on. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; 3. I'm more into the Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance etc. Is this the
      place for me or should I get lost? </P>
    
    <P>As long as you make the occasional kowtow to the Bush crowd and say the
      appropriate holy words and use lots of initials to refer to albums and
      song titles, welcome. You may find after a few days reading this group
      that getting lost was the safer option, however. Of course, we try to be
      open to new thoughts and ideas, so if you do indeed *want* to get lost,
      don't feel anyone here is pressuring you to do otherwise. It's just that
      we don't want everyone to get lost together, because then invariably
      someone will know where they are and the whole excersize would be
      pointless. But do what you want. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; 4. Is Kate on the 4AD label? Just what IS the 4AD label anyway, and
      who is on it beside the above two groups? </P>
    
    <P>Kate is not on the 4AD label. The 4AD label originally started many
      years before 4 A.D., and was responsible for such works as the Rosetta
      Stone and the Shroud of Turyn. They continue publishing artifacts by
      little known or dead societies for the amusement of archeologists and
      necrophiliacs. Other well known acts include &quot;Thrown Mooses&quot;, &quot;Clone
      of Xerox&quot; and &quot;The Picked Seeds&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Thanks for any answers! </P>
    
    <P>We are here to inform and entertain (as well as occasionally inflame and
      irritate). </P>

    <P>6. Is the boxed set coming out on 8-track tapes? </P>
    
    <P>5. In &quot;Running up that Hill&quot;, which hill in specific does she

    <P>3. The song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Is this, like, from, like, a

    <P>2. If Kate Bush is God, can she make a rock so big that she herself can
      not lift it? </P>

      <BR> From: vickie@chinet.chi.il.us (Vickie Ann Mapes)
      <BR> Subject: Kate Tour Joke </P>
    
    <P>It's a wonderfully elaborate joke. Here's what appeared in Ecto: </P>
    
    <P>Well, now the cat's finally out of the bag I guess I can let you all in
      the fact that Kate had an impromptu set of 3 &quot;Dreaming&quot; concerts
      in York back during August this year. York is about 90 minutes drive from
      Perth, where I live... so I went and stayed over for the weekend and saw
      the last two concerts on Saturday night and Sunday afternoon. </P>
    
    <P>Apparently Friday was fraught with technical difficulties anyhow,
      according to a friend of mine who saw it... Kate's negligee was nearly
      ripped off by a falling mike stand and her Fairlight actually fell off the
      stage at one point when she knocked it during the dancing bit for &quot;Sensual
      World&quot;. The music of course was superb, a really good selection from
      all her albums - even the Ninth Wave, which I found surprising. The male
      choir in &quot;Hello Earth&quot; were particularly good. </P>
    
    <P>The audience of about 600 each night had mostly driven up from Perth as
      I had, but there quite a few locals, too. A lot of them hadn't really
      heard much Kate before but got enthusiastic when she did a &quot;Dreaming&quot;
      medley incorporating the Australian national anthem and a few old Slim
      Dusty numbers. The local hotel owner featured on digeridu and the whole
      effect was nearly awesome. </P>
    
    <P>It was not extensively advertised even in Perth... just a simple splash
      panel in The West Australian gig guide and a mention on our public radio
      station. The result was I didn't find out about it until the Thursday of
      that week, so I didn't have time to get any decent recording equipment
      together to make a bootleg. All I managed to get was most of the first
      half using my dad's portable dictaphone. </P>
    
    <P>It was good to see her chatting with the audience between songs... She
      seemed to enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of the place and at one point
      even said as much, something about how she loved to perform live but hated
      all the work involved in creating concerts for hard-core fans. Apparently,
      she and Del were holidaying anonymously down here when some equipment
      became available after the annual Jazz Festival and they thought, what the
      hell...why not. </P>

      the incident on Calligar we were beaming down to a planet. Since then all
      I seem to be aware of is a series of bizarre text messages floating
      through my consciousness. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: I have been aware of these messages too, Captain, and
      it is through that link that I have been able to establish contact.
      Apparently the Calligar rift left disturbances that we were not aware of.
      It appears that we have once again been sent back through time and, rather
      then materializing in solid form, our consciousness has been placed in the
      memory banks of a twentieth century computer system. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Amazing, Spock. Good thing McCoy isn't here. What
      exactly is this place? </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: I am not entirely sure, Captain. We have been here for
      93.2 hours and I have been using this time to examine the memory systems
      of the network we are in. It appears to be called, &quot;The Love Hounds
      Computer Network.&quot; It appears to be dedicated to Kate Bush, a
      contemporary singer and musician of some renown. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: This Kate Bush, she appears to be a God to these people.
    </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: That was my initial hypothesis, although I now believe
      that most of the members of this system don't see her as a God, but
      instead this appears to be a form of humour to these people, though I am
      at a loss to explain it. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Which you often see to be when it comes to humor, though
      I must admit I can't explain it either. This seems to be an awful lot of
      reading material devoted to one singer. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Indeed? It never fails to amaze me how you humans often
      tend to find in-depth discussion of issues related to the arts
      distasteful, though I must admit that many of the issues discussed on this
      network concern items of trivial interest. However I have found an
      interesting area of this system entitled &quot;The Love-Hounds Archives&quot;,
      which contains many interesting photographs of the young woman as well as
      a fascinating document entitled &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; which appears to
      be a historic predesesor to the post-autobiographical format which became
      popular in the early 21rst century. Unfortunately Cloudbusting, needless
      to say, contains only information up to the current year, 1991, and so
      does not include information on Kate's 1993 album, Late Again, her 1996
      album, For The Love Of Stern, or her Tour Of Life II, which was held in
      1998 and became the basis for an entire civilization on planet Gaffan II.
      Indeed, I am sure that the inhabitants of that planet would be very
      interested in the existence of this network as it may confirm their murky
      historical record as to where their ancestors...[BREAK] </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: SPOCK. [BREAK] SPOCK. [BREAK] </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Yes, Captain. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: This is all very interesting but it's not going to help
      us any. Can you formulate a plan to remove us from the memory banks of
      this computer system? </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Indeed, Captain. I have already been working on just
      such a plan, of course. I developed the idea while attempting to formulate
      a link with you, and instead having been connected to this time period's
      mass entertainment system, and to an entertainment program entitled &quot;Quantum
      Leap.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Are you sure it wasn't &quot;Back To The Future II&quot;,
      Spock. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Quite certain, Captain. Though the principle is
      remarkably similar. I believe that I can device a computer virus that will
      travel from computer to computer, undetected, until a specific stardate,
      when it will flash a message on the Enterprise's computer screen,
      revealing the location of our minds inside this computer. The Enterprise
      should then be able to beam us out, through the same time-portal that we
      were beamed in. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Are there any risks, Spock? </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: &gt; If the initial virus does not succeed, it is
      unlikely that any further versions will. In this case, the only option
      open to us would be to simply wait in computer memory until after the
      accident, transfering ourselves when needed, and then leave the messages
      ourselves. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: And be trapped listening to these people for who knows
      how long? Please tell it will work, Spock. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: I shall endeavor to do my best, Captain. Although I
      enjoy the above average intellectual level shown on this network, I find
      this flagrant &quot;flaming&quot; most distasteful. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Actually, Spock, I was going to say that I found the
      insufferable intellectualism of this network &quot;most distasteful.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Indeed? </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Indeed. Oh, no, Spock, I think I feel another wave of
      messages coming across. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: According to these messages, this system has not been
      working properly for the past several days. Our presence here appears to
      have disrupted the normal operation of this network to a great degree.
    </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Is there any danger that the management of this system
      will discover the cause of the problem and attempt to delete it, namely
      us? </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Unlikely, Captain. The management here appears to be
      lax to the extreme. In any case, I believe I have finished the computer
      virus. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MAKE IT WORK SPOCK. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Captain, we have been in stressful situations before,
      why are you so emotional at this moment? </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: I just read another bunch of messages. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: I see, Captain. I am preparing to release the virus.
    </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Will there be any record of our appearance here? </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: There will be inactive copies of our consciousness here
      in the memory banks, but at the rate these people type these should be
      entirely destroyed in 89.3 days, far less if one Ron Hill acquires any
      more interview material. However, remnants of our conversation may be left
      in the messaging system. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: I doubt we have said much that could effect the future
      course of Earth. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: You are correct, Captain. Also, it appears to be a
      custom of these people to skip large threads of messages when they don't
      know the source or understand the content. While reviewing the messages of
      the last five years, I have noticed a fascinating discrepancy. The people
      here appear to be aware of many things that people in the 20th century
      should not. I have seen the names &quot;Klingons&quot; and &quot;Romulans&quot;
      used as well as other things from our century. Most puzzling they appear
      to possess information which, if true, refers to the century AFTER ours.
    </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Thats incredible, Spock! </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Indeed. I can offer no explanation, Captain. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Perhaps Starfleet will authorize another mission back
      here, though I would insist that we be sent in human form, rather then as
      computer memory. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: That would be preferable. Well the computer virus is
      finished. I will release it now. </P>
    
    <P> (Kirk) writes: Thank you, Mr. Spock. We shall have to play some of this
      Kate Bush's music when we're back on the Enterprise. </P>
    
    <P> (Spock) writes: Indeed we shall, Captain. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Misplaced love and TWW </P>
    
    <P>Hi, </P>
    
    <P>I'm sorry to burden you lot with my problems, but there must be someone
      out there who has experienced something similar to what I'm going through.
      I only discovered Kate Bush three months ago. Prior to this momentous
      revelation, I had assumed that I just didn't like music that much. </P>
    
    <P>Try to imagine what it would be like to obtain for the first time, over
      a period of three months, everything she has ever done. Imagine listening
      to nothing else over that period. Imagine buying books, posters and using
      up three ribbons printing &quot;The Garden&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>To the best of my knowledge, Kate Bush Overdose (or KBO) has never been
      documented before. Here are my symptoms: </P>
    
    <P>1) I can't concentrate for more than five minutes on non-Kate related
      topics. My work is suffering. </P>
    
    <P>2) I dream about her. In one dream she brushed against me as she was
      leaving a stage. In another she transformed before my eyes into a Jersey
      cow (I can only hope that this was inspired by &quot;Get out of my House&quot;,
      otherwise I'm sicker than I thought). </P>
    
    <P>3) I make up little fantasies about her. In one, she sits next to me on
      a really long flight. More recently, I intercept sniper bullets meant for
      her, and almost die. </P>
    
    <P>Is there a cure? As I see it, I have never suffered the long waits
      between albums. This passion has got to fade eventually. </P>
    
    <P>All yours, Selwyn Selwyn Selwyn ya ya </P>

      <BR> Subject: Proof that she really is! </P>
    
    <P>You'll have to forgive me if this is not as good as it could be. Chalk
      this whole thing up to a few hours in the middle of the night after doing
      layout for the paper. All of this is strictly in fun, and if you can't
      deal with that, then that's your problem. Flame me for not making it
      better, or for not being funny enough, but not for being insulted! </P>
    
    <P>The first book of KaTe commonly called The KreaTion: </P>
    
    <P>In the beginning KaTe kreated the big sky and the earth. (&quot;Hello,
      earth!&quot;) The earth was without form and void, and there was no deeper
      understanding to be found; and the Spirit of KaTe was moving under the
      ice. </P>
    
    <P>And KaTe said, &quot;Let there be music&quot;; and there was music. And
      KaTe saw that the music was good; and KaTe separated the bailaikas from
      the uiellian pipes. KaTe called the music Gaffa, and the darkness she
      called Baghdad. And there was a night of the swallow and there was the
      morning fog. </P>
    
    <P>And KaTe said, &quot;Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
      love-hounds, and let it separate the love from the anger.&quot; And KaTe
      made the firmament and separated the love which was under the ivy from the
      anger which was under the leaves and the trees. And it was so. And KaTe
      called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning,
      a second day. </P>
    
    <P>And KaTe said, &quot;Let the seven waves under the heavens be gathered
      together into one place, and let the homeground appear.&quot; And it was
      so. KaTe called the dry land a &quot;sensual world&quot;, and the waves
      that were gathered together she called snow. And KaTe saw that it was
      good. And KaTe said, &quot;Let put forth musical instruments, keyboards
      yielding notes, and bulgarian trios bearing background vocals in which is
      their seed, each according to its kind, upon the world.&quot; And it was
      so. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. </P>
    
    <P>And KaTe said, &quot;Let there be little lights shining in the firmament
      of the heavens to separate the warm from the soothing; and let them be for
      shivers and for quivers and for moans and sighs, and let them be reactions
      in the hearts of the believers to give light upon the earth.&quot; And it
      was so. And KaTe made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the
      day, and the lesser light to rule the night; she made her rare flowers
      also. And KaTe set them in the firmament of the records to give light upon
      the earth, to rule over the mind and the soul, and to separate the light
      from the darkness. And KaTe saw that it was good. And there was evening
      and there was morning, a fourth day. </P>
    
    <P>And KaTe said, &quot;Let the waves bring forth swarms of live tours, and
      let dances pass through the air across the front of the stage.&quot; So
      KaTe kreated the great musical performances and every poem that
      accompanies, with which the images flew, according to their kinds, and
      every interpretation according to its kind. And KaTe saw that it was good.
      And KaTe blessed them, saying &quot;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the
      amphitheaters in the countries, and let concerts multiply on the earth.&quot;
      And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. </P>
    
    <P>And KaTe said, &quot;Let the earth bring forth videos according to their
      kinds: rain-makers and dunce caps and chain mail bikinis according to
      their kinds.&quot; And it was so. And KaTe made the demons of the
      experiments according to their kinds and the celtic images according to
      their kinds, and everything that breathes within the womb according to its
      kind. And KaTe saw that it was good. </P>
    
    <P>Then KaTe said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness;
      and let them have dominion over the terminals of the network, and over the
      flame wars, and over the explanations of 'gaffa', and over the inaudible
      lyrics in the background, and over every note that creeps upon the song.&quot;
      So KaTe kreated love-hounds in her own image, in the image of KaTe she
      kreated them; lurker and regular she kreated them. And KaTe blessed them,
      and KaTe said to them, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth
      and subdue it; and have dominion over the newsgroups.&quot; And KaTe said,
      &quot;Behold, I have given you every song yielding beauty which is upon
      the face of all the earth, and every video with seed in its fruit.&quot;
      And it was so. And KaTe saw everything that she had made, and behold, it
      was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.</P>
    
    <P>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
      And on the seventh day KaTe finished her work which she had done, and she
      rested for four years from all her work which she had done. So KaTe
      blessed the long waits and hallowed it, because on it KaTe rested from all
      her work which she had done in kreation. Valerie Nozick </P>

      <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald Hill)
      <BR> Subject: Kate Endorsements </P>
    
    <P>Here's something from an old STILL BREATHING that I always thought was
      kinda cute. </P>
    
    <P>KATE NOT ENDORSING COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS </P>
    
    <P>By Bob Davis </P>
    
    <P>I've noticed that Kate hasn't endorsed any commercial products that I
      know of. Which, I always think, says a lot for artistic integrity.
      Especially since I could imagine she could use the money for things for
      her recording studio. I was wondering how many offers she has had. So, I
      imagined this scenario... </P>
    
    <P>Kate and Del are having afternoon tea, cones and scramble tofu at her
      home, when suddenly, like always, the doorbell rings, not for the first
      time that week. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Oh dear, Del, would you be so kind as to peek out the window and
      tell me it's not that product marketing salesman again. </P>
    
    <P>DEL: It's not that marketing salesman again. Anything for you, Kate.
    </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Thanks, Del. I knew you wouldn't let me d... </P>
    
    <P>PRODUCT MARKETING SALESMAN (P.M.S): Open up, Kate! I've got some more
      offers, and I know you can't refuse these! </P>
    
    <P>DEL (opening door): Don't worry, Kate. I'll take care of him. Sir, don't
      you think it's about time you gave up? We've been through this over and
      over. Kate does not want to license HOUNDS OF LOVE dog food. She's not
      interested in singing a jingle for your WEDDING LIST catering service. She
      is not going to sing THEM HEAVY PEOPLE for your Slim-N-Trim weight loss
      program. She wouldn't dream of letting you use GET OUT OF MY HOUSE for you
      ant and roach killer. She is definitely unwilling to let THE BIG SKY be
      used to sell telescopes. She wouldn't be caught dead singing FEEL IT to
      plug you skin softening soap, and if you dare let your from the Navy
      recruiter use a lyrically altered ARMY DREAMING for promotion, I guarantee
      you will soon face the wrath of Zoodle's ghost. Now I think that about
      covers everything. </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S: Oh no, not quite! My colleagues and I have come up with many
      revolutionary new idea since we last spoke. We'd really like to use Kate's
      song BREATHING in ads for our new and improved Decongest-N-Rest nasal
      mist! Helps unclog those stuffed nasal pas... </P>
    
    <P>DEL: I'll unclog some other passages of yours if you don't get.... </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S.: We've also developed a revolutionary new diaper and we'd like to
      use PULL OUT THE PIN. We'd like to use RUNNING UP THAT HILL to plug our
      new health spa where you can go, work out, and get in shape so you can run
      up those hills with no problem. YOu must be getting awfully weak from all
      that rabbit food. </P>
    
    <P>DEL : All right, that does... </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S: In case you're one of those people who is constantly woken up in
      the morning by those noisy leaf blowers, you should know about our new
      silent leaf blower. We'd like to use BLOW AWAY for that. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: (Who has now come to the door): Over my dead body! And Minnie's,
      Moony's, Vicious', Buggy's, Sandy's... </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S: Ah, yes, Minnie! Minnie Wickerdom. She did that song &quot;Loving
      You&quot;, I remember. And I'm sure she would have loved for you to let us
      use ALL THE LOVE for our new special rate long distance phone service. And
      THERE GOES A TENNER for our new bank investment offer. And HAMMER HORROR
      for our new shock resistant carpenter gloves! No more painful blows to
      your thumbs when you miss the nail... </P>
    
    <P>DEL: How would you like a painful blow to your.... </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S: And think of the possibilities if we could use THE KICK INSIDE
      for our new home pregnancy test... </P>
    
    <P>KATE: You've got a lot of... </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S: And this is really brilliant... Are you mean as a witch when you
      get up in the morning? Then you must having morning breath... the worst
      breath of the day. Use our revolutionary new mouthwash and your friends
      will never have to worry about WAKING THE WITCH! </P>
    
    <P>DEL: Are you insulting... </P>
    
    <P>P.M.S: And if you could be so kind as to let us use COFFEE HOMEGROUND,
      because we only use the best mountain grown flaked crystals for the
      richest, most aromatic kind coffee... </P>
    
    <P>DEL: I've got a marvelous idea for a new video of JAMES AND THE COLD
      GUN, and a certain pushy marketing salesman I know who would be great to
      play a primary part in it. So, you just run along now and don't come back
      unless you'd like that idea to become reality! (Del slams the door, P.M.S
      leaves. Kate and Del return to their chairs.) </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I thought Mrs. Olsen had retired by now. </P>
    
    <P>DEL: Who? </P>
    
    <P>KATE: That coffee lady who used to be on the telly. </P>
    
    <P>DEL (Sipping his tea): Must've been her husband. </P>

    <P>(KIRK): We, know, Leonard. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): What, how could you possibly know? Listen, Jim, I'm a doctor
      not a computer program. We've gotta get out of here... </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): No need to rush, there is exactly 43.2 minutes remaining until
      the scheduled beam-out point. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT? I'M SUPPOSED TO BE RESCUING
      YOU! Jim, what's going on? </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): Brace yourself, Bones, we are not only back in time but we have
      traveled to an alternative universe. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): Not this again, as if being stuck in a computer system isn't
      bad enough. Does Spock have a beard in this universe, too? </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): No, he doesn't. In this universe and this time we are not real
      people but are characters in a TV show. There are many other differences
      as well... </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): I'm a doctor, not a blender!! </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): What was that? </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): Oh... ah, nothing. (KIRK): Well, as you know we had accidently
      traved through a portal back in time and into this universe while beaming
      down to a planet. Our consiousness's were placed into a computer system
      entitled &quot;The Love Hounds Computer Network.&quot; After we had
      suffered through, what seemed at the time, seemily endless messages, Spock
      released a computer virus that was intended to be passed from computer to
      computer until it reached the Enterprise in our time, when it would
      release a message giving Scott instructions on how to beem us back through
      the portal that brought us here. However, this is not what happened. The
      virus reached the future, but, in this universe, Scott was not there.
      Indeed, The Enterprise and it's crew did not even exist, at least not as
      we know them. The entire galaxy was different. Fortunately the people in
      that time intercepted the message and brought us forward in time
      themselves, to the future of this universe. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): Why? </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): Simply because, as they put it, it was the nice thing to do.
      They were able to show us around, while they searched through the ancient
      computer systems with their Past Time Viewers until they were able to find
      information about you coming to rescue us. They then sent us back here.
    </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): But we don't have any machines capable of viewing the past like
      that. </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): In OUR universe, but in this universe their future is full of
      many strange and wonderful things. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): I haven't been able to make any sense of the messages here or
      to understand what these people are talking about. I've never heard of
      Kate Bush. Does this computer system also exist in the past of our
      universe? </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): Yes, it does. Though things are subtly different between the
      two universes, especially when it comes to the people. In our universe,
      Vickie is happily married to Richard and Chris is married to Melissa. IED
      is a real person and Andrew Marvick has never heard of Kate, having missed
      that fateful day... Ron Hill is well known for &quot;Wuthering Heights -
      Pat Benatar in her Own Words&quot;,(this is particularly ironic since his &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
      book, in this universe, will become the holy book of the people of Gaffan
      II). Also, in our universe, no one has heard of Cynthia, though Sinead
      O'Conner makes frequent, flaming appearences. However, Kate Bush's life up
      to this point in time is virtually the same in both universes. Kate enjoys
      a healthy and productive life, making wonderful albums, and subtlely
      changing the world. You probably are not aware of it, but Gorbachev has
      long been a secret Kate Bush fan. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): No, I didn't know that. </P>
    
    <P>SPOCK: It won't become well known for several years. We have also been
      told of the future of Kate's life in OUR universe. At a 1994 Kate Bush
      convention she met Ken SaintJohn and instantly fell in love. The next
      several months would prove to be the happiest time in Kate's life, but
      unfortunately that happyness was short lived as Ken was tragically killed
      when his Amiga exploded after he tried to plug the American machine into a
      British socket. Kate couldn't live in the country that had caused her
      love's death, so she moved to America where she quickly became involved
      with and then married to talk show host Howard Stern, to whom she
      dedicated her disappointing 1996 album, For The Love Of Stern. Although
      she was said to be happy with Howard, she still longed for Ken, and drew
      strength from this pain when she launched her triumphant 1998 Tour Of Life
      II which was the first to use virtual reality musical techiques, which
      were based on ideas of Ken. </P>
    
    <P> It is then that the story again takes a down turn. She then joined
      Howard's talk show, as the &quot;featured&quot; singer, and the two
      remaining albums she released consisted mainly of the bad cover versions
      she sang on the show. Both of these albums are banned (by punishment of
      death) on Gaffan II. Her future after 2004 is unknown in our universe, due
      to the turbulance of the times, and this gave rise to innumerable &quot;Kate
      is alive&quot; and &quot;Kate is Suspended in Animation, Somewhere&quot;
      stories, for which there is no evidence, though Oliver Stone XV did make a
      smash film based on this theory. </P>
    
    <P> Of course, this is the future of OUR universe, which is very different
      from what will happen in THIS universe. In fact, I have discovered that
      the exact point of divergence is the point when Ken and Kate met. If it
      were not for that meeting, the history of our universe, in all probability
      would have been much sunnier. </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): Ironic that one meeting with one person could make such a
      difference. </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): Indeed it is, Captain. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): So what happens in the future of THIS universe? </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): In 1997 she releases her album entitled, simply, Love. It is a
      concept album about what happens after The Ninth Wave, when the woman goes
      to tell the world what she has learned. It is not particularly popular at
      first, since it is mainly one long song, but when she takes it on the road
      in The Tour Of Life II, the world is changed forever. Later, when contact
      with the Romulans is reached, the album is sent as the first subspace
      message, and The Romulan War never happens and a peace treaty is worked
      out almost immeadiately. Even the Klingons mellow somewhat. The humans and
      other races make great leaps and become thousands of years advanced from
      where we are in our universe. Ironically, the only conflict left in the
      galaxy is on Gaffan II, where The Round Uppers often fight The Round
      Downers over whether the 45.5 minute album should be considered a 45 or a
      46 minute album. The ritualist flame-thrower-wars can be quite messy. But
      we don't have time for The Whole Story. </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): Ha, ha. The Whole Story, that's funny, Jim! :-) </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): Spock, this is increadible, I've never heard you laugh before!
    </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): Since I've heard Love, I've realized that you can't be overly
      logical and overly uptight about everything. Look what's happened on
      Gaffan II! :-) </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): So, you've heard the album? </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK:) Indeed, we have. Indeed that is one of the reasons they sent us
      back to meet you. We have brought with us a high quality sample file of
      the entire album, and we intend to bring it back with us in the hope that
      it will help our universe as much as it helped this universe. Our universe
      will just get it a few hundred years late. When people understand what has
      happened, I have the feeling that the name Ken SaintJohn will be cursed
      throughout the galaxy. Ironic that what started out as a minor mission
      will bring peace to the entire galaxy. </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): But that can't be, I've seen some of the &quot;Star Trek&quot;
      message sections, and they talk about &quot;The Next Generation&quot; in
      which our universe is run by self-righous, uptight morons! </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): I too have seen the information about that show. I find it
      highly illogical and I think it is very unlikely we will end up like that.
      I never would have beleived the Romulans in the episode &quot;Re-Unification&quot;
      and everybody knows we've already found a cure for baldness. Captain, the
      beam-out time is in 20 seconds. </P>
    
    <P>(KIRK): Okay, Spock. C'mon McCoy, when we finish playing the album for
      you, we'll show you how to find the Kate Bush symbol hidden on the cover.
    </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): You know what, Bones? </P>
    
    <P>(MCCOY): What? </P>
    
    <P>(SPOCK): She really is. </P>

      <BR> Subject: What is a KaTeFan? </P>
    
    <P>I think there are three stages of KaTe Fandom: </P>
    
    <P>1) The Kate Fan - owns HoL, TWS, maybe TD. Would not recognize them by
      those initials. </P>
    
    <P>2) The KaTeFan(tm) - owns all KaTe's albums, except for maybe &quot;Lionheart&quot;.
      Possibly has a poster, maybe a few GIFs, the more hard-core in this
      KaTegory might own &quot;The Secret History Of...&quot; or &quot;An
      Illustrated Biography&quot;. Maybe has copied a video or two off a
      KaTeFanaTiK. </P>
    
    <P>3) The KaTeFanaTiK - owns all the albums, including import pressings.
      Owns most, if not all, back issues of &quot;Homeground&quot;. Owns all
      singles. Has at least three posters. Owns every Katebook he (gender
      implication intentional) knows of, including &quot;The Whole Story&quot;.
      Has bought every Kate Video (as opposed to copying them off someone else).
      Types in 10-year-old KaTe interviews in R.M.G. Is proud of the &quot;sensitive&quot;
      drawing he did of KaTe. If he could, would get into fisticuffs over the
      meaning of &quot;Gaffa&quot;. Never heard of half the bands in Billboard's
      Top 10. Basically is to Kate what a Trekkie is to Star Trek. </P>
