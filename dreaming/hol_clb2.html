</P>
<P>- CLOUDBUSTING ANNOTATED LYRICS -
</P>
<P> by Ron Hill, Henry Chai, Doug Alan, David Hsu, and Peter Manchester. 
</P>
<P>Compiled by Ron Hill 
</P>
<P>Last Update: November 5, 1993 
</P>
<P>VERSIONS 
</P>
<P> Including the album version, there are three released versions of this
song: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Cloudbusting (The Orgonon Mix). &quot; An extended remix of the
original  recording, featured on the twelve-inch single. It's misidentified on
the US twelve  inch as the &quot;Meteorological mix&quot;! That, as you all
know, was the name of the  twelve-inch mix for &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, NOT &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;

</P>
<P>The video uses an extended version of the original recording, with a brief
insert  of new music. 
</P>
<P>QUOTES FROM KATE 
</P>
<P> The following quotes are more or less reflective of the quotes from Kate on
this  song. For more detailed quotes see the book Cloudbusting. 
</P>
<P> KATE: The last song is called &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; and this was
inspired by a book  that I first found on a shelf nearly nine years ago. It was
just calling me from the  shelf, and when I read it I was very moved by the
magic of it. It's about a special  relationship between a young son and his
father. The book was written from a  child's point of view. His father is
everything to him; he is the magic in his life, and  he teaches him everything,
teaching him to be open-minded and not to build up  barriers. His father has
built a machine that can make it rain, a &quot;cloudbuster&quot;; and  the son
and his father go out together cloudbusting. They point big pipes up into the 
sky, and they make it rain. The song is very much taking a comparison with a
yo-yo  that glowed in the dark and which was given to the boy by a best friend.
It was  really special to him; he loved it. But his father believed in things
having positive and  negative energy, and that fluorescent light was a very
negative energy - as was the  material they used to make glow-in-the-dark toys
then - and his father told him he  had to get rid of it, he wasn't allowed to
keep it. But the boy, rather than throwing  it away, buried it in the garden, so
that he would placate his father but could also go  and dig it up occasionally
and play with it. It's a parallel in some ways between how  much he loved the
yo-yo - how special it was - and yet how dangerous it was  considered to be. He
loved his father (who was perhaps considered dangerous by  some people); and he
loved how he could bury his yo-yo and retrieve it whenever he  wanted to play
with it. But there's nothing he can do about his father being taken  away, he is
completely helpless. But it's very much more to do with how the son  does begin
to cope with the whole loneliness and pain of being without his father. It  is
the magic moments of a relationship through a child's eyes, but told by a sad 
adult. (1985, KBC 18) 
</P>
<P>ANNOTATED LYRICS 
</P>
<P> Peter Reich was known as Peeps to his Dad, which is why the 7 inch single
has  &quot;For Peeps&quot; engraved into the runoff groove. He was close to his
parents. When he  was 10, his mother left them because she was a rather
independent person and also  because she got fed up with Wilhem's work. Thus
Peter was very close to his dad  after that. 
</P>
<P>The &quot;march&quot; music of the song could have been inspired by the &quot;Corps
of the  Comsic Engineers&quot;, in which Wilheim was the general, Peter was both
lieutenant  and sergeant, and their followers were soldiers and scouts. (It is
with powerful irony,  therefore, that the footsteps of the government agents in
Kate's film for  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; are shown keeping time with the
music.) They believed they were  soldiers fighting against UFO's. 
</P>
<P>In the following analysis, quotes from A Book of Dreams are given in
quotation  marks. 
</P>
<P> I still dream of Orgonon. 
</P>
<P>This should actually be spelled &quot;Organon&quot; (see seperate section
below). 
</P>
<P>I wake up crying. <BR> You're making rain, <BR> And you're just in reach,<BR>
 When you and sleep escape me. 
</P>
<P> KATE: All of us tend to live in our heads. In &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; the
idea was of  starting this song with a person waking up from this dream, &quot;I
wake up crying.&quot; It's  like setting a scene that immediately suggests to
you that this person is no longer  with someone they dearly love. 
</P>
<P>It puts a pungent note on the song. Life is a loss, isn't it? It's learning
to cope  with loss. I think in a lot of ways, that's what all of us have to cope
with. (1989, AP) 
</P>
<P> You're like my yo-yo <BR> That glowed in the dark. <BR> What made it
special <BR> Made it dangerous, <BR> So I bury it <BR> And forget. 
</P>
<P> Fluorescent lights and glow-in-the-dark yoyos are very very bad for one's  &quot;Orgone
Energy&quot;, so Wilhelm made Peter bury his yoyo. But every now and then  Peter
would want to play with it anyway, even though he knew it was bad for him.  So
he would dig it up, play with it for a while, and then bury it again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What made it special, Made it dangerous&quot; also refers to Peter's
father, who was  considered &quot;dangerous&quot; by the government. 
</P>
<P>But every time it rains, <BR> You're here in my head, <BR> Like the sun
coming out--<BR>  Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.
<BR> And I don't know when, <BR> But just saying it could even make it happen.

</P>
<P> KATE: And the song is really using the rain as something the reminds the
son of  his father. Every time it rains instead of it being very sad and lonely,
it's a very  happy moment for him, it's like his father is with him again.
(1985, MTV) 
</P>
<P>The phrase &quot;...something good is going to happen...&quot; stems from a
recurrent  foreboding, in the book, that &quot;something bad was going to
happen.&quot; 
</P>
<P> On top of the world, <BR> Looking over the edge,<BR>  You could see them
coming. 
</P>
<P> &quot;He was like a man who was standing on top of the world looking over
into a  new world. That is what Daddy was like. He had lifted himself so he was
looking  the horizon to a new world, a free and happy world. He stood there on
the edge of  the universe looking into the future. [...] They pulled the ladder
out from under  him and killed him.&quot; 
</P>
<P> You looked too small <BR> In their big, black car, <BR> To be a threat to
the men in power. 
</P>
<P> The government people came and took Wilhem away when Peter was 13  (Wilhem
also died in the same year). With regards to the line &quot;I can't hide you 
from the government&quot;, I quote a passage that describe what happened when
the  government people FDA agents and a US marshal came in &quot;a shiny black
car&quot;. To get  to the Reichs' estate, Orgonon, visitors have to pass the
abandoned laboratory at the  foot of the hill. Wilhem instructed Peter to keep
the government people at the lab  by asking them to wait, and then to call him
on the phone, so that Wilhem can be  prepared. Peter did as he was told, and as
he called Wilhem, who was in his study,  the government people sneaked up the
hill: 
</P>
<P> &quot;Daddy! They didn't wait&quot; 
</P>
<P> Tears tangled my words making the reciever wet and shiny. The car
disappered  around around the lab up the hill. 
</P>
<P> &quot;Daddy! They're coming up! OH DADDY OH GOD THEY DIDN'T WAIT.  THEY'RE
COMING UP DADDY THEY'RE COMING UP!&quot; 
</P>
<P> The screen door slammed before the receiver hit the floor. Grass was
already  whipping my legs as I ran up the hill. [...] 
</P>
<P> Everett Quimbly said if you run with your hands open you could go faster so
my  hands were wide open going back and forth like a train all the way up to the
hill  like a train running. Because if I run fast enough maybe I could beat them
to he top  of the hill and warn Daddy. What did they want? What did they want?
Why did  they always make us unhappy? 
</P>
<P> Actually that time the FDA people just wanted the orgone accumulators 
destroyed. The actual &quot;capturing&quot; of Wilhem was not described. 
</P>
<P> I hid my yo-yo <BR> In the garden. <BR> I can't hide you <BR> From the
government. <BR> Oh, God, Daddy--<BR>  I won't forget, 
</P>
<P> 'Cause every time it rains, <BR> You're here in my head, <BR> Like the
sun coming out--  Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.<BR> 
And I don't know when, <BR> But just saying it could even make it happen. 
</P>
<P> The sun's coming out. <BR> Your son's coming out. 
</P>
<P> When Peter was about 26, he saw the movie &quot;The Fly&quot; (you know,
the one about  the scientist who did an experiment which caused his own body to
be mixed up with  a fly's so that he has the head and an arm of the fly's). It
had a most profound  effect on him: 
</P>
<P> In the last scene, a benevolent uncle comforts the scientist's widow and
son. He  tells the son that his father had &quot;touched on knowledge of the
future,&quot; and, &quot;Maybe  someday, in many years, the world will
understand his contribution,&quot; and, &quot;he was  ahead of his time&quot;.
[..] Right there in the movie, people were laughing at how  incredible The Fly
was when sitting right there in the middle of the crowd was  someone who had
been through something like that and it was real. It was just more  believable
in a movie. 
</P>
<P>And: 
</P>
<P>The first thirteen years of my life always seemed most real to me, more real
than  anything that happened afterwards. And now, suddenly, with the infant
soldier  fading away in the bright lights after the movie, I felt afraid that my
life would be  empty and lost. 
</P>
<P> The last thirteen years were lost and unhappy. The infant was frozen inside
me,  unable to live. [..] It took a movie to break my shell, maybe because
movies are so  close to dreams and I love my dreams more than reality. There had
been too much  sadness; not enough laughter. 
</P>
<P>(The song ends with the sound of a steam train) 
</P>
<P> &quot;(See above for full quote) Everett Quimbly said if you run with your
hands open  you could go faster so my hands were wide open going back and forth
like a train all  the way up to the hill like a train running. Because if I run
fast enough maybe I  could beat them to he top of the hill and warn Daddy.&quot;

</P>
<P>KATE: That did all fall apart over a period of about ten bars. And
everything just  started falling apart, 'cause it didn't end properly, and, you
know, the drummer  would stop and then the strings would just sorta start
wiggling around and talking.  And I felt it needed an ending, and I didn't
really know what to do. And then I  thought maybe decoy tactics were the way,
and we covered the whole thing over  with the sound of a steam engine slowing
down so that you had the sense of the  journey coming to an end. And it worked,
it covered up all the falling apart and  actually made it sound very complete in
a way. And we had terrible trouble getting a  sound effect of steam train so we
actually made up the sound effect out of various  sounds, and Del was the steam.
[Laughs] And we got a whistle on the Fairlight for  the &quot;poo poop.&quot;
(1991, Classic Albums) 
</P>
<P>KATE: We got so many tapes of steam trains, and they don't sound anything
like  what you'd expect steam trains to sound like. They sounded so pathetic. So
we had  to build up all this steam sound and big wheels and brakes, you know,
coming to a  halt and everything. We had to totally exaggerate what the real
thing sounded like,  so that people would realize what we meant. (1985, BAM) 
</P>
<P>BOOK 
</P>
<P> A Book of Dreams was re-issued as a Dutton-Obelisk oversize paperback book 
in the United States in 1989. The domestic retail price is $7.95. And get this:
Kate is  on the cover! Unfortunately, as of 1992, this book appears to again be
out of print in  the USA. 
</P>
<P>It's highly cool! The cover design features a photo by John Carder Bush (one
of  the shots he took at the end of one of the shooting-days, with Kate's figure
at the  cloudbuster, in silhouette against an orange sky). The design is
credited to some  other woman, and there is no I.D. of the photo itself, nor of
its photographer. 
</P>
<P>Also, there is a mention of Kate on the back-cover blurb: she is listed
among  several pop-culture figures who have acknowledged the book's inspiring
influence  upon them. She is not identified in the photo, nor is John Carder
Bush credited for  his photograph. The brief new preface by Peter Reich is a
wonderfully concise  explanation of his reasons for remaining vague about his &quot;stand&quot;
on WR's theories--  words which also serve as justification for Kate's own
evasiveness. 
</P>
<P>CLOUDBUSTING VIDEO QUOTES 
</P>
<P> KATE: &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; was really exciting to make. I really wanted
it to be like a  short film. The song was inspired by the book A Book of Dreams
by Peter Reich,  which was such a strong, magical story that the plot was there
and the most difficult  areas were trying to do the story and the characters
justice, and deciding how to  &quot;distill&quot; all the information. 
</P>
<P>I worked with Julian Doyle as director. He was suggested to me by Terry
Gilliam.  Terry is one of my favourite film-makers, and I was so honoured that
he got  involved; and we worked very hard for about five-six weeks. It seemed to
make  sense to treat it like a film and cast actors, and I had this initial
crazy idea of using a  very tall actor who would play the father, and myself to
appear as the small boy. It  continually astounds me that I have the nerve to
publicly announce these crazes, and  I'm even more surprised when they work. It
seems to be connected to a kind of  faith? 
</P>
<P>The first move was to check that I'd be able to look boy-like or tom-boyish,
so  we pulled &quot;The Team&quot; together. This consists of Tina Earnshaw on
make-up - she  set about with foundation and stick-on freckles; Anthony
Yacomine, who designed  and cut a short wig which my hair was bundled up inside
of; and Pamela Keats, who  had brought a variety of dungarees, cardigans and
wellies [rubber rainboots] that  completed the character; and Del gave options.
I looked a bit like Coco the clown,  and someone mentioned Harpo, but we all
felt with fine adjustments we could get  away with it, especially when we took a
polaroid with Anthony standing on the chair  to look tall next to me. 
</P>
<P>We were all trying to think of a tall actor who would be perfect for the
part, and  who else, really? We thought Donald Sutherland would be superb, and
it's still hard  to believe that he actually said &quot;Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is one of the few videos we've made that has the
right visual  content within the subject matter. It is a story, and could easily
be treated as such. 
</P>
<P>One of the things that needed a lot of work was the Cloudbuster machine. It 
came out of our heads, based on vague information from the book. It had to look 
larger than life - elegant, strange, aimed at the sky. And when I went to see it
in its  early stages I really wondered: four cardboard tubes on wheels - eek!!
But by the  last stages it looked great, and on screen it looked superb. 
</P>
<P>Another thing that needed a lot of work was the weather. We needed so much 
luck to complete the shoot. We had only three days, and we demanded the weather 
to change for different scenes; and somehow - we still don't know how - it did;
even  to the moment when it began to rain just as the light and the film in the
camera was  running out. (1986, KBC 19) 
</P>
<P>You mentioned earlier that one of your favorite movies was Don't Look Now, 
which stars Donald Sutherland. Is that the reason you picked him for your new 
video? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I don't know if it's the reason. I mean Don't Look Now is a totally 
brilliant film and everyone in it was wonderful. but, this was a very different
piece.  And it was quite coincidental, I suppose, that we thought of Donald. And
I think at  that time the only references to Don't Look Now that there couldn't
have been  anyone better and we were so lucky because he was our first choice.
And through a  friend we managed to find a way of contacting him. And um, it was
quite incredible  really to think that he did it. I still find it hard to
believe. 
</P>
<P>He's been quite a fan of your for years, hasn't he? 
</P>
<P>Um. well, if he was, I certainly didn't know that. I don't, I don't think
so. (1985,  Profile 6) 
</P>
<P> And in the video, was it easy for you to portray a child? 
</P>
<P>KATE: I think it's something I'd obviously worried about. When you're not a 
child there are lots of things that could be a problem. Like I could look old
and not  young. And we were also [coughs] - excuse me - trying to take away the
feminine  edge so that in a way I could be a tomboy rather than a little girl.
Trying to keep the  thing as innocent as possible. And I think rather than being
that worried about  playing a child, I was just worried about the whole process
of acting, because it's  something I've not really done, in a true sense. I've
preformed in lots of ways, but  not really acted. And it was something that I
was wary of and I was actually  surprised at how much I enjoyed it. (1985, MTV)

</P>
<P> Who directed the video and where was it shot? I think the setting of its
really  beautiful. 
</P>
<P>It is a beautiful place. It's the Veil of The White Horse, in England. And
the  director was Julien Doyle. 
</P>
<P>And tell us more about Julien Doyle. 
</P>
<P>I'm a big fan of Terry Gilliam, I don't know if you know him, suburb
director.  And I was interested in working with him and he put me in touch will
Julien, who  works with Terry on his movies. He's a cameraman and this was
really his first role  as director. Terry was involved with the storyboard as
well, and this is how I met  Julien. 
</P>
<P>We spent a lot of time on this video and what was nice was the way that
everyone  became so concerned with the story and also concerned with giving
justice to it. You  know everyone wanted it to be something special. 
</P>
<P>Why is it set in the fifties? 
</P>
<P>It's because A Book Of Dreams, that it's based on, was actually at that
time, in  the fifties, that his father was taken from him. He was about twelve.

</P>
<P>And that's really it, you just took the exact time from the book? 
</P>
<P>Yes, I think also it made it more interesting. It's not totally accurate to
the fifties  and I think that in itself is important. We wanted to create a
sense of - no certain  time. I think it's more interesting in way when it could
be any time. But also by not  making it contemporary time you get a big sense of
nostalgia, of something that has  happened in the past. So I think visually it
was a very good combination. 
</P>
<P>How did you make that machine? 
</P>
<P>Well the book very little details of what the actual machine looked like.
But from  what I could gather the reality of the machine wouldn't look right. On
screen it's  got to be exaggerated. So it was trying to design something that
would look powerful  and possible of doing it but that wouldn't be comical,
because we didn't people to  laugh at it, we wanted people to be astounded by
the machine. So it was really  designing something that was a cross between an
Ack-Ack gun and a pipe organ. I  just felt that it had to have these huge
funnels that would reach to the sky and could  be moved around. And the whole
thing should be rotatable. And so we worked with  some designers that worked on
the Alien and I think it looked pretty good. 
</P>
<P>It looks great. Is this the first video where you're not dancing? 
</P>
<P>No, but it's quite a departure. I have done a couple of others that again we
were  trying to treat like piece of film, but we were using lip sync or
something like that.  And we were working on video as well, which makes it quite
different. (1985, MTV) 
</P>
<P>* You see the book in the video if you're clever. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes! Don't blink or you'll miss it. [Both laugh] (1985, The Old Grey 
Whistle Test) 
</P>
<P> The machine that features in the video - what's become of that now? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, it's at the moment resting in a garage not far from here.
[LAUGHS]  (1985, Picture Disk) 
</P>
<P>NOTES ON CLOUDBUSTING VIDEO 
</P>
<P> So people question whether or not Peter does sees Wilhelm pointing at the
hill  from within the car. I think so, as he begins gesturing even as Peter runs
into the  road not 5 feet after the car passes, and continues as it disappears
around the bend. 
</P>
<P>In one time-lapse scene you can see a rapid jet contrail. A partial excuse
for this  can be found on page 20 of the Obelisk edition &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;.
Peter describes  how the Air Force would fly overhead to indicate where there
were high  concentrations of DOR to be found, and that DOR caused their exhaust
streams to  dissipate rapidly. However, the long, wide, straight cloud farther
to the right looks  like a second, older contrail and it dissipates only
slightly. Perhaps the cloudbuster  has already been applied there. 
</P>
<P>In a rare lapse of continuity, we see the sun overhead in the path of the 
cloudbuster. Both before and after, we see the sun near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>Note that Kate is actually wearing women's clothing throughout the video;
the  shirts and sweaters all button on the left side. 
</P>
<P>Reich's office contains an unusual assortment of paraphenalia for a
psychoanalyst,  but consistent with his interest in pseudo-biochemistry. The
glassware is typical for  a chemist, but he also has two microscopes and a small
centrifuge on the bench. The  walls sport anatomical diagrams, and he is growing
at least one vine-like plant in a  long glass column (but not
hydroponically...it grows in dirt). 
</P>
<P>There are two old (non-glowing) yo-yo's in the in tray on his desk. 
</P>
<P>Reich picks up a paper from the lower right of his desk, studies it, then
crumples  and discards it. There are only three words on it, barely visible;
viewed with a  mirror I think they say &quot;My Final Paper&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Although the car leaving the farmhouse is clearly right-hand-drive, later we
see  that it sports a license plate the correct size and shape for an American
one. 
</P>
<P>IED would only add that although Sutherland looks absolutely nothing like
the  real Wilhelm Reich, he does (perhaps co-incidentally, it's true) rather
resemble  Kate's own father--at any rate, when IED made Dr. Bush's acquaintance,
his hair  and mustache (though certainly not his height or body type) seemed
quite like  Sutherland's in the video. 
</P>
<P>Apparently also there was a problem with obtaining a work visa on such short
 notice, so Sutherland agreed to do the work on Cloudbusting for free. 
</P>
<P>The newspaper is &quot;Oregon Times&quot;, which is apparently a blooper as
the events in  the book take place in Portland, Maine NOT Portland, Oregon.
Aparently they either  confused the states or perhaps used &quot;Oregon&quot;
since it is simular to &quot;Orgonon&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The first paragraph of the paper actually contains words that relate to the
story,  the rest of the words do not. The words can barely be made out if you
have the  laser-disk version. 
</P>
<P>ORGANON? 
</P>
<P> &quot;Orgonon&quot; was the name used by Wilhelm Reich when he named his
estate. He  mixed together the word &quot;organon&quot;, which is a word one
might use to describe  Reich's body of work if one were foolish enough to think
of Reich's work as  scientific or philosophic, with the word &quot;Orgone&quot;,which
is a nonexistent form of  energy that Reich claimed was responsible for rain,
orgasms, and all sorts of other  things. 
</P>
<P>In the lyrics to the song say &quot;Organon&quot; and Kate's 12 inch version
of the song was  sub-titled &quot;The Organon Remix.&quot; Which was incorrect
since Reich's ranch in Maine  was called &quot;Orgonon,&quot; based on &quot;Orgone&quot;
energy, with an o. This error was  corrected in the lyrics (but not music)
section of the book Kate Bush Complete.  Tracing whether or not this was
intentional has lead to much research on the  subject. 
</P>
<P>Kate was asked by love-hound Doug Alan the day after he interviewed her,
while  she was signing records at Tower Records. &quot;She gave my a look of
amusement that  said 'my fans sure are cute coming up with all these ridiculous
questions' and said  that no, the mispelling was not intentional at all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>However, John Carder Bush, when later asked directly about the spelling,
replied,  &quot;It could be intentional.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Andrew Marvick came up with these (apparently tongue-in-cheek) explaination 
in a 1986 paper on HoL : 
</P>
<P>...new implications arise from the re-spelling of the name Orgonon itself
within  the song. It has not been determined yet whether or not this re-spelling
was  originally a deliberate one. It is arguable, however, that, by the time the
twelve-inch  &quot;Organon Mix&quot; was released, the emphasis on this spelling
reflected Kate's  intentions. If this is so, then the word &quot;organon&quot;
may be seen as a reference not only  by pun to Reich's once-controversial sexual
theories, but also directly to the term  &quot;organon&quot;, used by Aristotle
in reference to several of his logical treatises, and again  by Sir Francis
Bacon in some of his philosophical writings. Suggestions have been  made, as
well, that the misspelling may be a reference to a character from the 
long-running British television series &quot;Dr. Who&quot;, although this seems
a remote  possibility, since it is unlikely that Kate is certain of the correct
spelling of that  character's name. 
</P>
<P>The most likely reference is to the British pharmaceutical product Organon,
a  common sleeping aid: such a connotation is not wildly arcane; nor is it
unrelated to  the theme of the song. It is not inappropriate, however, that the
term seems also to  rationalize her single known vice by referring to Walter
Rumsey's &quot;Organon  Salutis&quot;, an obscure document of 1659 subtitled, &quot;Divers
New Experiments of Tobacco  and Coffee: how Much they conduce to preserve Humane
Health.&quot; 
</P>
<P> The issue of whether or not it was intentional was finally put to rest by
Peter  Manchester: 
</P>
<P>... in correspondence between me and Kate. The relevant paragraph of my
letter  to her of May 18, 1986 ran like this: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I am a 43 year old professor of philosophy and speculative theology,
which I  believe I can verify by my first remark, which is to complain
pedantically that Peter  Reich follows his father Dr. Reich's practice of
spelling 'Orgonon' as I have just  written it, with an 'o', from 'orgone'
energy, whereas your song title and lyrics for  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; write
'Organon'. Organon was originally the title given to the five  logical treatises
of Aristotle by his editor of record, Andronicus of Rhodes. It has  thereafter
had some currency among philosophers as a title for a general  methodological
tractate, or an 'instrument of thought' in the sense of a fundamental  logical
mechanism. I would not put it past you to be aware of this fact, at least 
subliminally, and to have perpetrated a deliberate pun. But I rather suspect I
have  caught you in a spelling error. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course maybe you have a whole thing with A and O, Alpha and Omega&quot;:
my  ears hear the lyric in &quot;Not This Time&quot; as 
</P>
<P>To the A, to the O<BR>  To the A, to the O <BR> To the O that's bursting
<BR> To keep me going and to keep the shit away. <BR> And certainly you're
right that we all sin!&quot; 
</P>
<P>In her reply (undated, but immediate), Kate writes: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm afraid the Orgonon mis-spelling IS a mistake and we were aware of
this as  soon as we saw the 'copy'. It is very difficult to correct everything
and this one  slipped through my hands but I find it a wonderful experience when
errors of this  kind give birth to such fascinating theories!&quot; 
</P>
<P>[I am nervous about transcribing private correspondence, but this one issue 
seems to have come to her and the family from several angles, so I place this
much  of our exchange on the record.] 
</P>
<P> In Greek 'organon' simply means 'tool'. So an 'organ' is a tool (of life),
an  'organism' is a system of tools. In designating the logical treatises of
Aristotle as an  Organon, Andronicus of Rhodes interpreted them as a fundamental
set of 'tools'  for philosophical thinking (which may not have been Aristotle's
view at all). By the  Middle Ages this view of logic as a 'primer' became
official and finally officious,  provoking the Englishman Francis Bacon to
publish a &quot;Novum Organum&quot; (1620)  rejecting medieval philosophy and
instigating the tradition of critical empiricism that  evolved into what today
is called 'scientific method'. Bacon wrote in Latin, where  the form is
'organum', but in English translation his work is entitled &quot;New  Organon.&quot;

</P>
<P>Two years ago someone speculated that the revisionist and anti-traditional
aspect  of Bacon's work might underlie the spelling in Kate's lyrics and titles
for CB. I  doubt it. I do still suppose that some sort of subliminal awareness
of the term  'organon' on Kate's part generated the initial misspelling, but
given her Catholic  schooling, it is far more likely to have been Aristotle than
Bacon. 
</P>
<P>It is interesting that the word 'orgasm' does NOT derive from the same root,
but  instead from a different Indo-European root that means 'to swell'. Wilhelm
Reich  may well have wanted on good scholarly grounds to emphasize the
difference by the  innovative spelling 'orgone' for his postulated
hyper-Freudian life-energy. The  name he gave his ranch in Maine, Orgonon, is
based on that eccentric spelling, and  violates the regular linguistic laws of
formation for the particular Greek root, though  once again with the advantage
that it makes clear that he is NOT talking about an  'organon'. 
</P>
<P>To throw in one last twist, it could be that the Reichian spelling of 
orgone/Orgonon is behind the video's placement of the ranch with the
cloudbusters  in Oregon (instead of Maine). In which case we have a NEW slip/pun
to take up  with Kate.

<P>Date: Wed, 27 Apr 94 17:20:16 PDT <BR> From: steve.b@TQS.COM (Steve Berlin)
<BR> Subject: Cecil Adams on W. Reich
</P>
<P>Recently, I picked up a copy of &quot;Return of The Straight Dope&quot;, by
Cecil Adams  (my hero). If you want to make your life MUCH better, learn the
secrets of the  cosmos, and increase your IQ tenfold, I suggest you pick up
seven or eight copies of  this book. Anyway, here's something that stopped me in
my tracks on page 73: 
</P>
<P>(A reader asks) &quot;I've always cast a jaundiced eye on the shenanigans of
scientific  fringe groups. But my eye is a little less yellow when I look at
Wilhelm Reich. Reich  claimed to have discovered a life energy he called &quot;orgone&quot;
back in the 1930s. He  made a device that supposedly accumulated the energy, the
&quot;orgone accumulator&quot;  (ORAC), and another that allegedly could
manipulate it in the atmosphere called a  &quot;cloudbuster.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Some MD's who still subscribe to Reich's theories publish the 'Journal
of  Orgonomy'. I remember one article claiming tomato plants grown inside an
ORAC  produce more and larger tomatoes. There's a meteorologist named Jame DeMeo
 who does research on the cloudbuster. Plus (and this is the ultimate evidence)
Kate  Bush sang a song about the cloudbuster on her 'Hounds of Love' album.
Seeing as  you're the last word on subjects like this, what's the last word on
orgone? Yes, no,  or maybe?&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Steven Stocker, Baltimore 
</P>
<P>To which Cecil answers: 
</P>
<P>&quot;No. Reich was a nut-an unjustly perecuted nut, it should be said, but
still a nut.  He claimed that (1) he had done battle with alien spaceships, (2)
he could produce  clouds and create rain with his cloudbuster, and (3) his
orgone boxes could cure (or  at least ameliorate) everything from cancer to the
common cold. He believed living  cells arose spontaneously from inorganic
matter, that cancer cells are actually  protozalike critters that have tails and
can swim like fish, and that orgone energy is  what makes the sky blue and
causes heat shimmer. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Even his terminology was like something from a bad science-fiction
movie.  UFOs he called EAs, for Energy Alpha. The alien spaceships gave off DOR,
for  Deadly Orgone. The aliens themselves he called CORE men, for Cosmic Orgone 
Engineering. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Still, you have to give Reich some credit. He was an intelligent,
charismatic man  who had his share of admirers. He was a cherished associate of
Freud's in his early  years and made some useful contributions to psychoanalytic
theory. 
</P>
<P>&quot;But he seems to have had only the most tenuous grasp of reality. His
ideas  became more and more eccentric over time and he was eventually expelled
from the  International Psychoanalytic Association. He wound up in the United
States and  from then on devoted all his time to the mad pursuit of the orgone.

</P>
<P>&quot;Reich convinced a great many people, including a few scientists like
the  aforementioned DeMeo, who claims he ended a drought with a cloudbuster. To
this  day there are several orgonomic societies. But the mainstream view has
always been  that Reich was a quack and that his ideas have no scientific basis.

</P>
<P>&quot;Loony though Reich was, he did not deserve the shameful treatment he
received  at the hands of the government. From early 1950s onward he was hounded
by federal  agents. His laboratory in Maine was raided, his equipment destroyed,
and his books  confiscated and burned. Reich did make exaggerated claims for the
medical powers  of his orgone boxes, but he was hardly a major threat to the
republic and there was  no excuse for the ferocity of the campaign that was
raised against him. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In 1956 Reich was convicted on shipping orgone boxes across state
lines in  defiance of a court order obtained by the Food and Drug
Administration. He was  sent to prison, where he died of a heart attack in 1957.
But his ideas, both good and  bad, live on.&quot;

<P>&gt; At the end of Cloudbusting, you hear a train coming to a stop. Why?
What is  the significance? I read A Book of Dreams and there isn't any reference
to trains. 
</P>
<P>I believe in an interview once Kate said that they just couldn't figure out
how to  end the song. It went along great then just seemed to trail off and fall
to pieces as  the end. They tried all sorts of things, and just happened across
the train sound on a  whim. It just seemed to fit and give the song a sense of
clousre, so they used it. I'm  afraid there's no deeper significance that than.

<P>I'm not so sure. I posted on gaffa some passages from the book when HoL came
 out, and there *is* a mention of trains - the part where Peter saw the men in
the  &quot;big black car&quot; coming up the hill and he runs like a train (or
something to that  effect) trying to reach his father. 
</P>
<P>So either 1) Kate didn't tell the truth (and this has happened before) or 2)
she  forgot but it stayed in her subconcious memory (it was a powerful passage)
or 3)  Stuart's RAM is faulty :-) :-) :-)

</P>
<P>Here is part of the text of the NYT Book Review I told y'all about a few
weeks  ago. What's best about it is something I discovered only just now, as i
reread and  retyped it. In the last to the next paragraph notice the dream
sequence about the  train! Here we have another interesting, IMHO, explanation
for that whistling at the  end of Cloudbusting. . . (I seem to remember a thread
about this a few weeks ago ) 
</P>
<P>Here goes:

<BR> Illustrated 256 pp. New York: <BR>  Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $25 
</P>
<P> ... [most stuff deleted]
</P>
<P>&quot;. . . Reich's entries about his personal relatiosn show great pathos
and loneliness  . . . . A dream he records, of an express train thundering
through empty plains with  no destination, expresses this loneliness, and
perhaps also the runaway streak of  madness in this otherwise sane man. So far,
Reich's belief that he had discovered  the secret of life has not been
validated. But perhaps it will be, when we understand  what the elusive concept
of 'energy' really means.&quot;

</P>
<P>Well, there are three official releases of The Organon Mix of Cloudbusting 
(regard the wording and spelling...). All three are expensive: 
</P>
<P>1. This Woman's Work boxed set: 
</P>
<P>2. moments of pleasure / The Best Works / 1978-1993: 
</P>
<P>This is a 2-CD promo set from Japan. It's one of the rarest official Kate
items,  and was recently advertised in a magazine for not less than $800. The 2
CDs contain  quite a lot of b-sides as well, though nothing that's not available
elsewhere on CD. 
</P>
<P>3. Cloudbusting: 
</P>
<P>This US promo CD from '86 contains the 'Meteorological Mix' of Cloudbusting,
 which is the wrong title for the right song. The CD was Kate's first ever
non-album  CD and is quite rare. If you *need* to have it *soon*, expect to pay
quite a lot as  well. 
</P>
<P>The mixing of song titles (Organon Mix vs. Meteorological Mix) is an
interesting  thing in itself: EMI America seems to have gotten this wrong at one
point in time  and halfway stuck to that. It's easy to get lost in the song
titles, because there in fact  *is* a remix of a Kate song called The
Meteorological Mix, though it's not  Cloudbusting but rather a different single
from the Hounds of Love album, The Big  Sky. Now The Big Sky was the last single
in the UK for the HoL album, and the US  Cloudbusting promos (there's a 12&quot;
with the same typo) came out for the The  Whole Story album, so this was even
after The Big Sky came out in the UK. Not as  easy to understand is the typo of
Cloudbursting which also is quite common and even  extends to such items as an
Australian video compilation tape from 1991 which is  used in discos, bars, etc.

<P>Since Uli is cataloguing the spelling errors regarding this release, he
should add  that Kate herself has admitted that the spelling of &quot;Orgonon&quot;
as &quot;Organon&quot; was a  mistake. Reich's home/center in Maine (like its
smaller cousin in Arizona) was  properly named &quot;Orgonon&quot;. (See A.
