    <P>The music for Patriot Games was indeed performed by Clannad. One of the
      songs that was feature was &quot;Theme from Harry's Game&quot; which can
      be found on Clannad's album &quot;Magical Ring.&quot; This song was
      originally written for a UK TV show and made it to No. 5 on the UK charts
      back in the early 80's. Just to jog memory &quot;Harry's Game&quot; was
      the song playing when the IRA tried to shoot (what's his face) in the
      house while the TV was playing. If you looked closely at the screen you
      might have noticed that not only does the voice sound like Enya but the
      woman on the TV somewhat LOOKED like her too! This is easily explained
      though, Clannad's lead singer is Maire Ni Bhraonain --- Enya's older
      sister. In fact Enya is the baby sister of three of Clannad's members and
      the niece of the other two members. The only mystery that still remains
      for me is who is Maggie Boyle listed in the music credits....I haven't
      heard of any connection with Clannad before. Well, like I said to my
      boyfriend 5 seconds after the movie started &quot;I'm getting the
      soundtrack!!&quot; </P>

    <P>P.S. Ann Archer has portrayed the ultimate wife: </P>
    
    <P>She's a successful surgeon, has time to play with her daughter and knows
      how to use a shot gun WITHOUT ammunition!!! </P>

      <BR> Subject: Anne Archer and &quot;Patriot Games&quot; soundtrack </P>
    
    <P>First, I second all the nice things said about Anne Archer, one of my
      favorite actresses. </P>
    
    <P>After seeing the movie Sunday I went to the record store and found they
      already had copies of the soundtrack CD; the Clannad song used is &quot;Theme
      from Harry's Game&quot;, and the other Irish track (used I believe at the
      start and end of the movie) was not Enya but Molly (Maggie?) Boyle. I
      didn't pick it up because I've got the Clannad track twice over already
      and I had a problem paying full CD price for one (admittedly good) track.
      I also suspect that may have been Maire on the TV while &quot;Harry's Game&quot;
      was playing. </P>
    
    <P>I *did* pick up Loreena McKennitt's The Visit. Wonderful stuff. </P>
    
    <P>Congratulations, Cynthia! </P>

    <P>I like Anne Archer too. I first saw her in Lifeguard when it came out in
      1976 and she also made Hero At Large (1980) worth seeing again and again.
      I'm glad she's still acting and doing well. </P>

    <P>ps, too bad she's a <A HREF="http://miso.wwa.com/~vickie/cos/cos.html">$cientologist</A>

      <BR> Subject: Patriot Games and Kate </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Oh, remember a while back when we were talking about people we
      thought looked like Kate? And I said I thought the woman who played
      Michael Douglas' wife in Fatal Attraction looked alot like Kate, but I
      couldn't recall her name? Well, it's Anne Archer, and she playes the wife,
      Catherine Ryan, in Patriot Games. And to me, she bears quite a resemblance
      to Kate. </P>
    
    <P>Kate? Oh, yeah, Kate. There's a newsgroup about Kate. You're right about
      the resemblance, but there was another scene where I saw a ringer for
      Kate. When the little girl is trying to distract the palace guard there is
      a woman watching from the side who really struck me as looking like Kate
      Bush (and I'm not prone to seeing her everywhere I look). </P>

    <P>&gt; Kate Bush Look-A-Like #1 .. The actress who played appeared in the
      following movie: </P>
    
    <P> wife of Harrison Ford in Patriot Games </P>
    
    <P>I think she is a really good lookalike .. IMHO! </P>
    
    <P>Her name is Anne Archer. She has made a name for herself as the
      estranged, yet loyal wife to Michael Douglas's character in the film
      'Fatal Attraction'. She seems to have a reputation for being cast as the
      loyal wife. </P>
    
    <P>Her looks? Well, I suppose it's her eyes. </P>
    
    <P>Cheers, Mik. </P>
