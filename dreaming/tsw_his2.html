<P>From: henrik@eddie.MIT.EDU (Larry DeLuca @ The Bandykin Server) <BR> Date:
23 Sep 89 16:14:38 GMT <BR> Subject: How long do you think we can stick it out?

</P>
<P>Summary: How long do you think until it's out, WOMAN!!!!! 
</P>
<P>Miss Kate Bush sits somewhere in the sensual world tonight, most likely on 
holiday, most definately not trying to think about the album that she's just
foisted on  an unsuspecting world. There are those of us who, as the minutes
pass, can't stop  pondering what it's going to do to the UK, Eire, the US,
Pago-Pago, and every other  stretch of land with a record shop. 
</P>
<P>While not as cohesive as &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
drips its sticky  goo of tension &amp; release all over us, impossible to
remove. Her voice reaches up into  the high registers while fluid bass slithers
inbetween your legs like a tiny fish in the  shallow part of the beach. 
</P>
<P>Larry Speaking: 
</P>
<P>2 Listens and an amazingly huge number of continuous multiple orgasms later,
 This Woman's Work is as fabulous as any and 	all of the others to date - in a
word,  STAGGERING. 
</P>
<P>My particular favourites are &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;, &quot;Walk
Straight Down the  Middle&quot;, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, and all the
other tracks as well...God, she's  *AMAZING*!!! I mean, WOW!!! INCREDIBLE!!!
UNBELIEVABLE!!! 
</P>
<P>But you probably don't want to hear me just jizz about the album. You're 
probably much more interested in how we came to be capable of jizzing over the 
album - and besides, it's a more amusing story. So here it is... 
</P>
<P>Joe 	(just waking up): blblththp. I need to call Newbury's to see if they
have  the single yet. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Why bother? My copy's going to get here from the UK in a couple of 
days. 
</P>
<P>	(Larry is suddenly bit by the realization of the inanity he has just 
sputtered, and dials &quot;IN-FOR-MA-TION (due to a labor dispute...)&quot;. He 
gets the number and calls. Besides, if the truth be told Larry called Tower  the
night before and they hadn't heard about it.). 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Hello. Do you have the new Kate Bush single, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;?

</P>
<P>Newbury: No. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Any news on when? 
</P>
<P>Newbury: No. All we have is this promo cassette of the 		album. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Pfttbppbbhblblblttpbbh!!!bbkbpbggkb!!!pppp P-_P-(slaps himself)
Promo  Cassette!!?!?!?! 
</P>
<P>Newbury: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Well, what's it look like? (Yeah, this is a stupid question since
Larry had  already read what would be most likely much better descriptions, but,
hey,  he was still reeling from the fact that not five miles away from him was 
the Songbird of Happiness). 
</P>
<P>Newbury: It's just her face with a flower in front of it. She looks kinda
psychotic,  actually. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	That's not at all unusual for Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>Newbury: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Can I buy it? 
</P>
<P>Newbury: It's not for sale. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Are you going to play it in the store anytime soon? 
</P>
<P>Newbury: Not till October 17 when the album comes out. 
</P>
<P>	(Larry is now seriously bumming, but looking for any kind of an out at 
this point). 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Can we come look at it at least? 
</P>
<P>Newbury: Yeah, sure. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	See you shortly! 
</P>
<P>Newbury: Yeah. Bye. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Bye! 
</P>
<P>	(Much screaming, hooting, frantic showering, planning, playing of  &quot;Running
up that Hill&quot;, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, and &quot;The Big Sky&quot;,
first the  seven-inch versions, and then the twelve-inch versions - Joe took a
long  time in the shower.). 
</P>
<P>Larry: Joe! Hurry up! Armageddon could happen at any moment and we could
MISS  IT!!!! 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	Calm down! (Pause). What am I saying? 
</P>
<P>	(Larry and Joe get in the car and break a great many laws to get to 
Newbury's in Harvard Square. They pay three dollars for parking, since it  would
be a bummer to get towed and not be able to listen to the new  album. 
</P>
<P>	Listen to the new album, I say? Yes. We were determined to do so one  way
or another. We had come prepared. We brought a ghetto blaster and  cassette to
transcribe it if we could get away with it, a camera and several  lenses to
photograph the cover, and enough money to bribe the &quot;Just Say  No&quot;
Foundation into letting us start a marijuana ranch on the front lawn of  the
White House. 
</P>
<P>	Larry and Joe park and enter Newbury's in Harvard Square. There is a  huge
line, and we wait patiently until it is all gone). 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	I am starting to feel silly. 
</P>
<P>Larry (quoting Maude): It's every person's right to make an ass out of
himself.  Don't let the world judge you too harshly. 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	OK. But you do the talking. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	As soon as I stop hyperventilating, OK. 
</P>
<P>	(The Counter Person offers to help us.). 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Can I help you? 
</P>
<P>Larry (subtle and scheming and looking for an unobtrusive place to set down
the  camera equipment so he can use his towel again): We called and were told 
you had a promo copy of the new Kate Bush album, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, 
and that we could see it if we came down, so here we are. 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Oh. (There is much conferring behind the counter and to a
couple  of other people, but no one seems to know anything about it, much less 
claimed to have answered the phone so authoritatively). 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Are you sure this was the store you called? 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Yes. I asked for the one in Harvard Square. 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: What number did you call? Did it begin with 491? 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	No, it was 225-9700. Do you have a store with that number? 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Yeah, at the MIT Student Center. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Ohmigod!!! We have to go!!! 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Bye. 
</P>
<P>	(Larry and Joe go tearing out to the car, breaking more laws, speed 
records, and generally wreaking havoc throughout Cambridge until they  arrive at
MIT and park illegally. By now only one thing matters -  wrapping fingers, arms,
ears, legs, and any other body part available  AROUND THAT TAPE!!!). 
</P>
<P>	(Larry and Joe come tearing in and calm down long enough to talk to the 
people at this store). (The Counter Person offers to help us.). 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Can I help you? 
</P>
<P>Larry (subtle and scheming and looking for an unobtrusive place to set down
the  camera equipment so he can use his towel again): We called and were told 
you had a promo copy of the new Kate Bush album, The Sensual World&quot;,  and
that we could see it if we came down, so here we are. 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: Oh. I don't know. Hey, Spike! Do you 		know anything about a
new  Kate Bush album? &quot;The Sen ... 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	&quot;The Sensual World&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Counter Person: &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	And we wanted to see it (he says holding the camera equipment,
flanked  by Joe with the ghetto blaster and blank cassette, toweling himself). 
</P>
<P>Spike: 	OK. 
</P>
<P>	(Spike searches for it and unceremoniosly presents it, *STILL IN THE 
CELLOPHANE*!!!! complete with the &quot;For Promotional Use on October  17&quot;
label on it. Larry takes it in his hand. This is too much. His head is  reeling.
He sets it on the counter, four years of need answered in a  heartbeat. He can't
leave without it.). 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	How much? 
</P>
<P>Spike: 	It's not for sale. 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	We'll give you fifty. 
</P>
<P>Spike: 	Fifty bucks? 
</P>
<P>Larry and Joe: Yes. 
</P>
<P>	(Spike realizes that A) they are dead serious. B) A Kate Bush fan and his 
money are soon parted. C) He would be a chump if he and the other guy  didn't
each pocket $25 and make up some lame story about not having any  idea where it
went. D) These two are crazy fuckers and will probably  become totally
psychotic, take him, the store, half the inventory, and most  of the building
out to get the cassette.). 
</P>
<P>Spike: 	You give me fifty bucks and it's yours. 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	OK. Here's fourty-seven. (You will recall that Larry spent three
dollars on  parking). Joe! Give me three bux. 
</P>
<P>	(Joe, without a moment's hesitation, produces the requisite cash.). 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Can we have it? Can we really have it? 
</P>
<P>Spike: 	You just paid fifty bucks for it. 
</P>
<P>	(Larry grabs the cassette and he and Joe go running out of the store, 
war-whooping and shoving it in the faces of passers-by trying to express  the
elation of the moment, just what it means to them. Words fail, but  hysteria
helps paint a touching if somewhat understated picture. 
</P>
<P>	Larry and Joe get in the car after a brief panic that they might have paid 
$50 for a promo copy *OF THE SINGLE* but Larry points out that A) It  had that
sticker on it saying October 17 - the Album Release Date, and B)  Now that he
had it open, there was a complete track listing ---  INCLUDING THE BONUS
TRACK!!!!!!!!!!!. 
</P>
<P>	Larry and Joe get in the car, hands trembling, and put the cassette in the 
player. The familiar chimes that Larry has heard countless times over the  past
week that he's been listening to the single over the phone (Joe used  three-way
calling to create a VoiceMail copy for him which he has played  nearly
constantly, and of course there's the tape that Larry made with his  answering
machine with the beeps every fifteen seconds, Larry and Joe  jizzing in the
background, and the constant warble of worn belts that he  listens to now and
then in the car) sounded much better, as expected. 
</P>
<P>	But then IT HAPPENED!!!! She came in with the Fairlight and the Drums  and
EVERYTHING!!! It was breathtaking! It was magnificent! It was  ***HUGE***! It
was at this point (after wiping the jizz off the ceiling)  that Larry and Joe
realized that FIFTY BUCKS IS DAMNED CHEAP IF  YOU'VE BEEN CRAVING KATE BUSH!!! 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	Larry! Stop screaming! I can't hear her! 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Sorry. 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	Larry! Stop screaming! I can't hear her! 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Sorry. 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	Larry! Stop screaming! I can't hear her! 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Sorry. 
</P>
<P>Joe: 	Larry! Stop screaming! I can't hear her! 
</P>
<P>Larry: 	Sorry. 
</P>
<P>(After the title track we had to rest. Then we listened to the remainder of
the first  side, letting it wash over us, drag us along, wrap us in itself, make
us quiver with  delight, knowing there was absolutely NOTHING it could possibly
do that would  disappoint us. 
</P>
<P>We paused for the requisite refractory period again after the completion of
the  first side, rescued Joe's stereo from his parents' house, tried to explain
but again  words failed. Of course, by this time we were drained from the
incredibly emotional  experience of hearing the first side, and even our
hysteria was muted by that pause  that comes in the middle of exquisitely slow
and delicate love-making such as this. 
</P>
<P>	 We then listened to the second side on the ride home. If it was possible
it was  even more breathtaking than the first. 
</P>
<P>As &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; began, we sat back, fulfilled, glad after
visiting a host  of new realms to come back home to something warm and soothing.
Familiar. It was  a perfect track to close an album to. 
</P>
<P>EXCEPT - Then came &quot;Walk Straight Down the Middle&quot;. YOW! AWESOME! 
CCCCRRAAZZZYY!!! 
</P>
<P>Then the moment. Stunned silence. We'd probably just heard almost all (if
not  all) the material she'll dole out to us for ANOTHER FIVE YEARS (follow the 
progression between 	 albums). 
</P>
<P>But it was OKAY. This album definitely needs hundreds more listens, and
maybe  in five years I can come to appreciate all of its delicate and subtle
shades of nuance  and meaning (and maybe in five years I'll have figured out all
the lyrics). 
</P>
<P>Larry: I think I came in my pants. Again. 
</P>
<P>Well, that's the story of how we came to get a copy. We're on the *THIRD* 
listen, making a tape copy for Joe. It just keeps getting better. 
</P>
<P>Honest! We've tried to reach you all! But no one is home! We wanted to have
a  party, turn out all the lights, and let it wash over the collective lot of
us! But  NOBODY IS HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
</P>
<P>Oh, well, time to turn out the lights and enjoy Side II all over again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is Larry and Joe signing off from Sensual World Headquarters,
USA.&quot;

<P>Vickie of K.C., MO wanted IED to forward her thanks to all the Love-Hounds 
(more than 35 of you at last count) who called her Kate Bush telephone-message 
number over the last couple of days. She wants IED to re-iterate, however--even 
stress--that all callers are urged to leave a comment or two after the message
ends  (after the beep), and even if they don't want to leave their names, could
they say  where they are calling from? Thanks. The telephone number, again, is
(816) 561-0846.  It contains a special experience for all those who are still
waiting for Kate's new  album. Enjoy!

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Love and Anger SINGLE
NEWS--U.S. 
</P>
<P> The Columbia Records promo CD-single of Love and Anger is out there now, 
folks, and it is a very nice item indeed. The 5-inch CD is housed in a hard
paper,  &quot;book&quot;-style sleeve--sort of like the old Prince CD of Around
World in a Day was,  remember that one? Inside there's a plastic panel to hold
the CD. The cover is in  black-and-white, and features a close-up of Kate's eyes
from the cover photo of the  album (a shot of Kate with a large flower in front
of her face). The CD itself  features a photo detail of the flower itself, again
in black-and-white. The CD's  program contains Love and Anger only. There is no
additional track. Nevertheless,  this package is attractive and unique, and will
certainly become a highly sought-after  item among Kate fans, especially
overseas. Unfortunately, there are not many of  them, and they have been sent
mainly to radio stations, so there is no way of  predicting when or if copies
will become available even to the alert collector  combing the record shops for
promos. IED wishes everyone happy hunting!

</P>
<P> The following notice from the KATE BUSH CLUB arrived in IED's mailbox 
today: 
</P>
<P>As many of you will already know, Kate's new album &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
will  be released on 16th October. We thought you might like to know in advance
about  some of the interviews which will be appearing over the next month or so.
As far as  Kate knows, she will not be doing any P.A.s &lt;Personal appearances&gt;.

</P>
<P>Q MAGAZINE...........November issue (out 10th October) 
</P>
<P>THE GUARDIAN........Arts page (12th October) 
</P>
<P>MELODY MAKER........Issue of the week ending 14th October * 
</P>
<P>N.M.E......................Issue of the week ending 14th October ** 
</P>
<P>YOU MAGAZINE.........15th October 
</P>
<P>TRACKS (Free at Woolworths)..November issue (out 26th October) 
</P>
<P>R.A.W......................Issue 31 (out 1st November) 
</P>
<P>INTERNATIONAL MUSICIAN....December issue (out 2nd November)--6-pg. 
</P>
<P>There will be articles in various overseas publications but we could not get
 definite information in time so keep your ears and eyes open. 
</P>
<P>The Club magazine will be with you soon after the album is released. 
</P>
<P> That is all the note said. 
</P>
<P>*--IED believes there was nothing (aside from an album-release announcement)
 in the issue of MM for the week ending October 14th. Perhaps MM means to have
an  interview in the October 14th issue. 
</P>
<P>**--The NME interview for the week ending October 14th (i.e., the October
7th  issue, IED assumes) did indeed contain a long interview with Kate, and IED
has  already transcribed and posted it for the delectation of Love-Hounds
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>With luck Neil Calton and the other admirable U.K.-based Love-Hounds are 
reading this posting, and perhaps one or more of them will make an effort to
acquire  some of the interviews listed above--in particular those which will
probably never  be imported to the U.S. American fans can probably get hold of
the Q Magazine  interview, the one in The Guardian and the one in International
Musician. But things  like the Woolworths throwaway paper Tracks, the
publication with the (to IED)  mysterious name R.A.W., and You Magazine will
almost certainly never wash up  onto U.S. shores, so IED implores the English
philocanines to take pity on us  benighted Yanks and obtain/transcribe/ post
these rare British treasures as soon as  they become available.

<P>A major earthquake here the day of the album's release -- is Kate trying to

</P>
<P>I was at home listening to the CD when it struck -- all power went out for a
 while and the chandelier in my bedroom was swinging almost to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>I'd like to hear from any Bay Area love-hounds through e-mail to see what
their  situation is, if they can get through. I'm especially concerned about
Tracy Roberts; I  heard that Santa Cruz was particularly hard hit.

</P>
<P>On my first real serious listen to TSW, I couldn't help but let a giggle
escape at  the &quot;yes&quot; closing Love and Anger. What a surprise to hear
Kate laugh back at me! 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, my listening pleasure has been slightly clouded by the news
of the  earthquake -- I have not yet heard from my family but I am assuming that
they are  safe. I suppose this may postpone the South Bay Bush bash. Perhaps the
west coast  party will coincide with an east coast get-together after all (we're
working on it).  Here's wishing the Northern Californians a safe return to some
normalcy. Take  comfort in Kate...

</P>
<P>I have been able to contact, directly or indirectly, Larry Hernandez, Tracy 
Roberts, and Andrew Marvick (who is up in the Bay Area on vacation), and they
are  all all right. The party at Larry's house will go on as scheduled this
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>For those love-hounds outside the Bay Area, the Red Cross has said that 
monetary donations would be greatly appreciated. I was lucky -- Livermore was 
hardly damaged, although we sure felt it. Others got hit much worse. 
</P>
<P>Power was restored, so I was eventually able to finish listening to the CD.
Mostly,  I have to say, I've been listening to the news. KITS, that radio
station I've been  telling you about so much, was knocked off the air for about
a day; they are now  broadcasting from a makeshift studio on a boat in the Bay.

night.) It's  no longer than earlier KCBNs, but it does have a bunch of
completely exclusive new  photographs, including a couple of Kate with the Trio
B. outdoors. The article by  Kate is minimal, and says mainly that she tried
discussing the songs but found  herself simply quoting the lyrics, so decided
the best thing was to be interviewed, so  this is followed by an interview by an
outside music journalist (IED forgets which,  offhand) [Roger Scott!]. In it she
is asked will she tour, and she replies with  quintessential Bush ambivalence
and ambiguity. The upshot is that it would have to  be fun for her to want to do
it, and that she's beginning to think that it might be  made fun, so that the
answer is: she doesn't know. Hey, at least that's not nearly as  negative a
response as we've read in the most recent print interviews. 
</P>
<P>There's an article by Paddy in which (irony of ironies) he thanks an
unidentified  Dutch person for giving them a tape of Macedonian music which they
ended up  using (very loosely) for The Sensual World, and asking the Dutchman to
get in touch  with them so that they can give him credit! Seems this Dutch
bastard just couldn't  keep his mouth shut long enough, but had to go and accuse
Kate of &quot;fraud&quot; the  second he heard the song. IED bets he regrets his
nasty-mindedness now! And  apparently he never made his bloody identity clear to
the Bushes anyway! 
</P>
<P>And there's an article by Del about the miking on the new album.

</P>
<P>Someone has already mentioned that the next single will be &quot;This
Woman's  Work&quot;. The Kate Bush Club also state that it will be twinned with
a re-mix of &quot;Be  Kind To My Mistakes&quot; from the film Castaway as the
B-side. The 12&quot; will feature an  exclusive track. 
</P>
<P>The magazine has pieces by Kate, Del and a transcript of the Roger Scott 
interview. 
</P>
<P>On a sad note, it should be reported that Roger Scott died recently from
cancer  and the Kate interview must have been one of the last he was able to do.

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Items from Homeground #36 
</P>
<P>Here are some things from the latest issue of Homeground : 
</P>
<P>First of all, from the update included in subscription copies: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Despite Kate's attempts to keep the album for presentation on the day
of  release, 'The Sensual World' seems to have the worst kept secret since Kim
Philby  was in MI6. Copies have been dished out with the cornflakes to staffers
at EMI both  in the UK and the US. [I suppose they mean CBS here in the US.] The
biggest gaffe  came when a whole shipment of cassettes was mistakenly packed in
cassette boxes  labelled as the new Beach Boys album and sent to record shops in
SE London and  Kent. For a few hours the Beach Boys became a mega-seller in the
area as word  quickly got round. Attempts by EMI to get the cassettes back met
very little success  (surprise, surprise!) Reports from a source in the 'Our
Price' chain tell us that  people were coming in and asking to hear the 'new
Beach Boys cassette', and  quickly taking it away. After these sold out the
salespeople were vainly offering the  vinyl versions -- but for some reason
these were not acceptable!&quot; 
</P>
<P>HG says the Canadian telephone number was set up by EMI. 
</P>
<P>In the regular part of the fanzine, it says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate has been/is working on the production of two tracks of the next
album by  Alan Stivell, the Breton master celtic-harpist.. . .The two tracks
will also have  backing vocals by Kate, and many of the other musicians will be
those who have  worked with Kate. John Carder Bush has been involved in the
English translation of  the Breton lyrics.&quot;

new  re-mix of Be Kind to My Mistakes. The 12-inch and CD-single will contain
both  those tracks, plus a brand new Kate Bush track called I'm Still Waiting (a

<P>Next, I was able to obtain the new CD single at Bleecker Bob's in L.A. I was
 discussing this with Andrew Marvick, and we think we see only minor differences
 between the &quot;Single Mix&quot; version of &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; and
the album version.  He finds some differences between the new and old versions
of &quot;Be Kind To My  Mistakes&quot; I'm not sure yet. Of course, my copy of
the old version of BKTMM is  pretty damn poor, having been taped off a VCR when
I rented the movie once. The  ending is definitely different.

<P>Kate Bush will appear on UK's The Wogan Show this week, probably to perform 
This Woman's Work. All UK Love-Hounds are commanded to watch and (if  possible)
record! 
</P>
<P>Also, a camera crew was at East Wickham Farm &quot;recently&quot; to make a
new  video-interview with Kate. No details were forthcoming, but this could very
well  have been the VH-1 crew. 
</P>
<P>Aside from this, Kate has not been doing anything like the degree of TV 
promotional work that she did for Running Up That Hill and Hounds of Love in 
1985-86. Instead, she seems to have been keeping pretty much to herself, except
for  the occasional interview, and the new Wogan appearance. 
</P>
<P>That is all that IED knows as of now. This information comes directly from 
someone who is truly in a position to know, and it is quite literally five

<BR> Subject: Kate on Wogan 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush appeared on the Wogan show last night on BBC 1 (IED's source of 
information about this being spot on). 
</P>
<P>Kate did a lip-synch to This Woman's Work. I have not had a chance to
compare  the song on the show with the recorded versions but it seemed much less
 orchestrated. The overdubbed vocals near the end were present but the early 
sections of the song were much sparser. This song is rapidly becoming one of my 
favourites of hers - it's hard to stop the odd tear forming in the eyes,
especially  watching Kate's emotive performance of it. 
</P>
<P>The set was just Kate at the piano surrounded by a few pillars, lit by blue
light  and with a little dry ice. Kate was dressed in a long black dress,
blacket jacket, white  blouse, and black bow-tie. Kate's hair was formed into a
long pony-tail wrapped  with a scarf. The really odd thing was that her long
laced boots were placed right in  front of the piano stool (Kate played
barefoot) and given the simple nature of the set,  the boots dominated the scene
- it was almost surreal! (Rather like football fans  being told to remove their
&quot;bovver boots&quot; before entering the ground). 
</P>
<P>Terry Wogan seemed genuinely delighted to have her on the show and 
commented that it had been ages since she was last on. He also mentioned that
the  album had gone platinum.

<P>I just spoke to the DJ of a local radio station here (94.5 FM, KDGE). He
said Kate  Bush is going to be in New York and he is going to interview her this
Thursday  (12/14). Apparently she will be in NY to do promotional interviews and
he said he  doubts if she will go to other cities. Have you heard anything about
Kate's US visit ?  It is surprising news to me, considering there has been no
mention on  Gaffa/Love-Hounds. You can call the radio station at (214) 580-9400
to confirm this or  to leave any questions for Kate (they want Kate fans to send
in questions).

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: More on Kate in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>The news is completely true: Kate is in the U.S. She touched down in NYC 
yesterday at about 2 p.m., and will be here for about a week. (IED assumes that 
includes a stop in Canada, though he has no specifics.) 
</P>
<P>The reason no-one has said this before is two-fold: first, when IED and
Vickie  first heard the rumours last week, we both made pointed inquiries of our
respective  CBS sources, and were both given the answer: &quot;No, she's not
here.&quot; (Though the  answer Vickie got was a bit suspicious.) Second, when
the news was confirmed the  other day by a source who is very close indeed to
the decision-makers, he felt it  would not be right to divulge a confidence till
independent corroboration could be  found. Vishal's report finally provided that
corroboration. 
</P>
<P>So, anyone in the NYC area, please start taping Live at Five and all other
local  interview shows starting immediately, and also check out Tower Records's 
Greenwich Village and upper Bwy stores for news of any possible record-signing, 
etc. Also, you might call up cable stations like MTV and ask whether she'll be
taping  an interview there. 
</P>
<P>And accept IED's sincerest and humblest thanks in advance for whatever 
information you are able to dig up.

<P>One thing Kate has been doing while in New York has been phone interviews 
with alternative stations across the country. Here in Phoenix, they had an
interview  at around 1 pm local time on a local alternative AM station (KUKQ
1060 am). I was  not able to hear any of it, although I hope to convince them to
replay it for those of  us who work during the day. The person who told me about
it couldn't remember  many details, but Kate did mention that the reason she
doesn't like to fly is that it  bothers her ears and that this time is wasn't
too bad.

</P>
<P>Hello there fellow Love-Hounds--
</P>
<P> Was glad to see that there is a short article on Kate in the latest issue
of Rolling  Stone. The accompanying b&amp;w photo takes up approximately half
the page; in it,  Kate has her hair curled and pinned up on her head, and is
wearing what looks to  be either a dark blouse and skirt or a dark colored
dress. One large, ornate earring  depends from her right ear. She is bent over
slightly, supporting herself with her  right elbow on her knee. Her eyes look
soft and sleepy. It's a nice, flattering picture.  By SHARP contrast, the &quot;finger-painting&quot;
of her which appears to the left of the  magazine's table of contents is about
as unflattering as anything I could dare  imagine. If it wasn't for the caption
labelling the picture as Kate Bush, (and the fact  that she's holding the
sceptre and orb from Love and Anger ), I wouldn't even have  known it was her. 
</P>
<P>So it goes. At least Kate has found a small niche in Rolling Stone.

(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: Re: Nigel Kennedy 
</P>
<P>I met Nigel Kennedy a few months ago. It was before we had access to post to
 the net (though we were reading it) which is why you didn't hear about it then.

</P>
<P>I took off work to go see the concert. Nigel was only scheduled for one 
piece--the Walden piece. He performed right before the intermission. He was 
excellent! He was fascinating to watch because he does not stand still and play.
He  hops and jumps and twists and bends over and every single note is reflected
in his  body language and his facial expressions. I'd never seen anyone play the
way he  played! When the piece was over he received a rousing standing ovation
and was  called back to the stage many times. I was pleased because when he
first came out  on stage I don't think the audience really knew what to make of
him. He was  wearing this baggy suit with &quot;things&quot; pinned all over it.
I don't know what they  were. His hair was spiky and he really looked as if he'd
be more at home in grungy  clothes, playing in some grungy punk rock band. As
soon as he started playing  though, everyone in the hall was absolutely
mesmerized! 
</P>
<P>Once intermission started I got up the courage to go backstage. No one
stopped  me and I went right to his dressing room. He was standing at the door,
signing  autographs for other people. I hung back and when everyone else was
gone I  stepped forward. He smiled and asked me how I liked the show. I told him
it was  wonderful at the same time I was pulling the extended 12&quot; mix of &quot;Experiment
IV&quot;  out of a sack. As soon as he saw it his eyes lit up, he broke into a
wide grin and he  exclaimed 
</P>
<P>&quot;Honey, come look! It's a Bush Baby!!&quot; 
</P>
<P>A woman sitting on the couch in the room got up and came over to look and 
admire. She was beautiful and very interesting looking but I turned my back 
attention to Nigel when he started talking about Kate. He has a *VERY* thick 
cockney accent and it was extremely hard to understand him. I honestly can't
tell  you much of what he said. I caught &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;lovely&quot;,
&quot; wonderful to work with&quot;, &quot;fun&quot;, and when I pulled out some
demo cassette copies of the album he said that he  didn't have it yet! I
couldn't believe it, he hadn't heard The Sensual World? Oh,  he'd heard it, at &quot;Kate's
place&quot; he just didn't have a copy of the album. 
</P>
<P>He asked me what I thought of the album. Of course, I told him I loved it
and  that I especially loved his work on &quot;The Fog&quot;. I said that I have
a radio show and he  broke in quickly to ask if I played Kate. Well,
absolutely!! &quot;Good!&quot; he said. &quot;It's so  nice to meet a Bush Baby!&quot;
That was cool, he must have called me a Bush Baby 4 or  5 times! People were
lining up behind me to talk to him and get his autograph so I  couldn't stay any
longer. I said bye to him and the woman with him and walked off,  a big smile on
my face! I stopped in the stairwell to sit down and put things in order. 
</P>
<P>After putting the EIV 12&quot; back in the plastic sleeve I tried to read
what he wrote  on the back. Impossible! He either writes in a foreign language
or else he's taken  writing lessons from a doctor, because it is absolutely
illegible! I almost went back to  ask him but thought that would be a bit rude.
So I have a personal message from  Nigel Kennedy but I have no idea what it is!

</P>
<P>I can't complain, I did get to see Nigel perform. I did get to meet him. I
did get to  hear about Kate and I did get to hear him call me a &quot;Bush Baby!&quot;
and I got to meet  Brix, even if I didn't know it was her! All in all, it was a
wonderful Sunday  afternoon!

<BR> Subject: NEWS FLASH - unless I'm the only one who doesn't know 
</P>
<P> According to a guy at one of the local record stores there will be a NEW
Kate  CD released next week. I don't know if it is official or not but the title
(he thinks)  is: 
</P>
<P>Introspections of The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Might be interviews, a bootleg, or &quot;Be Kind to my Mistakes&quot;, &quot;Ken&quot;,
&quot;GLC&quot;, and &quot;I'm Still Waiting&quot; He seemed to think that it
had four tracks on it.

SENSUAL WORLD Finally! 
</P>
<P>  WOW! 
</P>
<P> We were given an wonderous thing today. 
</P>
<P>The American CD 12&quot; of The Sensual World! 
</P>
<P>The CD is called &quot;ASPECTS OF THE SENSUAL WORLD&quot; the cover is the
same  &quot;sand through the fingers&quot; cover as the UK version, with the
gold lettering exactly  the same except that it adds ASPECTS OF to the title.
The coloring is sepia-toned,  but not as much as the UK version and the photo
isn't as clear and crisp as the UK  one. The spine also gold lettering and says:
44K 73174 KATE BUSH ASPECTS OF  THE SENSUAL WORLD COLUMBIA By the way, it's a
full-sized plastic CD case,  not cardboard like L&amp;A or thin like the one
from the UK. 
</P>
<P>This is on the back of the box, all in gold lettering: 
</P>
<P>COLUMBIA 
</P>
<P>AAD  KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>ASPECTS OF THE SENSUAL WORLD 
</P>
<P>1. THE SENSUAL WORLD*+ (3:56) <BR>     (LP VERSION) 
</P>
<P>2. BE KIND TO MY MISTAKES** (3:03) <BR>     (FROM THE FILM CASTAWAYS -WITH
THANKS TO NICOLAS ROEG) 
</P>
<P>3. I'M STILL WAITING** (4:25) 
</P>
<P>4. KEN** (3.48) <BR>     (FROM THE COMIC STRIP FILM G.L.C.) 
</P>
<P>5. THE SENSUAL WORLD* (3.56) <BR>     (INSTRUMENTAL MIX) 
</P>
<P>&quot;COLUMBIA&quot; REG. U.S. PAT. &amp; TM. OFF. MARCA REGISTRADA 
</P>
<P>(I wouldn't have added that except that I like the name &quot;Marca
Registrada&quot; Does  anybody know what it means?) 
</P>
<P>In the inside &quot;groove&quot;, are some very interesting symbols (NOT
anything that  Kate put there I'm sure)

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: KBC competition 
</P>
<P>One other item of interest. IED got a letter from Lisa Bradley, Secretary of
the  Kate Bush Club in England, in which she informed him that Love-Hounds's 
submission for the official Kate Bush Club competition to see how many words of 
four letters or more can be formed out of the letters in the title THE SENSUAL 
WORLD was accepted, but was not a winner--this even though IED's list, which 
was mainly the work of east-coast Love-Hound Julian West, numbered well over 
five hundred words. It seems that we are not the only KompuTerized Kate fans out
 there, folks, for there were not one but three people who turned in longer--
much  longer--lists than IED's and Julian's. The second runner-up's was over 700
words,  the first runner-up's was more than one thousand three hundred words
long, and  the winning list of words from THE SENSUAL WORLD contained TWO 
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN entries. Oh, well, Love-Hounds's glory will have to await 
another day... 
</P>
<P>IED hasn't seen a Digest in about a week now, so he apologizes if pressing
issues  have not been addressed by him in this posting. It is this that brings
us together.

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Homeground #38, Spring '90 
</P>
<P>Well, Homeground #38 just arrived. I'll type in some items of interest. 
</P>
<P>First of all, I was astounded to see that in February, the album was
actually  charting higher in the US than in the UK! From my postings, you may
remember  that in the US the album went from 49 to 61 in that month. Well, in
the UK the  album went from 51 to 66 in the same period. This is undeniably the
only time such a  thing has happened! 
</P>
<P>The British reviews of the L&amp;A single have on the whole not been very
good,  especially considering the rapturous reviews the album as a whole got.
The reviews  of TWW were, on the other hand, very good. 
</P>
<P>Kate wants &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; for the next UK single. 
</P>
<P>Sales of the album are now over 300,000 in the UK. 
</P>
<P>There's an article about someone who managed to get a ticket to see Kate on 
Wogan. I'm so jealous! And, what does he say about the performance? &quot;The
rest  many [sic] of you will have seen yourself. Wasn't it just an absolutely
fantastic  performance? So emotional and intense -- and it took several big
gulps to choke  back the tears!&quot; Grrr. We Americans HAVEN'T seen this yet!

</P>
<P>Vickie here. 
</P>
<P>Peter Morris (aka Peter David Fitzgerald-Morris/&quot;Mr Homeground&quot;)
called me  today and said that he'd just come back from The Bush home (Dr. &amp;
Mrs.). 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>One more (bummer) item: &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; as a single is
definitely  cancelled. It's such a shame too because it would have made a GREAT
video! I  should add that it's been cancelled in England. Since CBS is in
control of what  happens in the US, they still could release another single,
though I wouldn't hold my  breath. 
</P>
<P>Well, cheerio from Chitown...

</P>
<P>I just got issue #39 of Homeground in today's mail. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate actually went to France in May and appeared on a number of TV
programs  as follows: La 5 -- the evening news, for a dubbed interview; Top 50
-- the pop chart  show, for a subtitled interview and a clip from the &quot;This
Woman's Work&quot; video;  Giga -- a show for teenagers, with a career digest
including video clips; and finally  Champs Elysess -- the most famous TV show in
France on 15/5 when she  performed &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;.

</P>
<P>Here's some news from the leaflet that so far has not been posted: 
</P>
<P>Apparently the three videos from TSW are not yet commercially available in 
Britain; Kate hopes they will be next year. Wow! America is actually ahead of 
Britain in this respect! 
</P>
<P>&quot;The competitions will continue to run until the next magazine. So far
the highest  number of words from The Sensual World stands at 2806 words with a
2nd place of  2450 words -- I don't know how I'm going to check them. The [Kate
symbol] sign  on the album was found very quickly without us even printing it as
a competition.  We'll announce the first 3 received in the next mag, but until
then, see if you can  find it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate has the following message: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks for all your lovely cards, presents and the good wishes you
sent for my  birthday, they were very much appreciated. Thanks too for all your
feedback to the  album -- it's great to know you're out there. I hope you've had
a wonderful  summer.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[signed] with love,

<BR> Subject: Stuff at the local importer 
</P>
<P>On to the biggest surprise of the evening: 
</P>
<P>Maybe the discussion of this just slipped past me on the net, but have any
of you  seen a picture-disc import of TSW? This is the full CD (all 11 tracks),
and has the  sand-through-fingers picture silkscreened onto the disk. It's quite
nice. 
</P>
<P>So has anybody else seen this? What do you think is a good price for it?

<P>&gt;&gt;They don't site a source for this but it sure sounds likely. We are
not seeing any  of the signs of an imminent album release that I seem to recall
from the summer  prior to The Sensual World release. 
</P>
<P>&gt; What signs were those? (Just so I know what to look out for 8^). 
</P>
<P>Minor things like the planets shifting in their orbits, earthquakes, floods,
a change  in the earth's rotation and a oppossum that got squashed into the
exact shape of a  KT symbol near where I-71 and I-270 intersect. 
</P>
<P>Also, by this point in the summer before The Sensual World we knew the
title,  the release date was being firmed up and the publicity machine was
showing some  signs of coming to life. 
</P>
<P>I wonder if any singles will be released from the Elton John tribute (if it
does  finally materialize). Rocket Man would seem an excellent choice.
