Subject: Pre-Review of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; by D. Alan
</P>
<P>I have acquired a copy of an advance tape of Kate Bush's new album &quot;Hounds
of  Love&quot;, and have had two days to listen to it. This is going to be a
relatively short  review of it. As soon as I am up to it, I will post a more
detailed review. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is basically two separate and very different but
coherently  related albums. The A side, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is (except
for one song) a commercial  pop album. It is excellent -- just about as good as
commercial pop ever gets, but  commercial pop only gets so good. When I first
heard this side of the album, I was  very disapointed. It was neither what I
wanted nor expected from Kate, but it is  good enough that it's difficult to
consider complaining too loudly. &quot;Running Up That  Hill&quot; is typical of
the quality of the songs on the A side. 
</P>
<P>The B side, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, is a totally different story. It is
completely  different from, but every bit as good as &quot;The Dreaming&quot;!
It is a very diverse and  unbelievably strange progressive rock collection of
songs that tell the story of a  woman who has apparently been shipwrecked and is
floating alone in the water at  night, and how this traumatic experience changes
her outlook on life. The music  ranges from a simple folk-like piano ballad to
bizarre progressive rock to strange  compilations of sounds to Aborigine
digeridu to backwards vocals and instruments to  dirge-like chants over chilling
bass violins to Greek choruses surrounded with  Floydian space music and
submarine sounds to a cheerful ditty to a traditional Irish  fiddle jig mixed
with an African drum beat and Burtonesque rap vocals! It's  amazing! Just
completely indescribably amazing! 
</P>
<P>One of the songs, &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; even has a part that must
have been sung  by Helen Fitzgerald: 
</P>
<P>You will burn <BR> You won't breathe <BR> Confess to me girl <BR> Guilty!
Guilty! Guilty! 
</P>
<P>Overall, the album is much more happy and positive than anything else Kate
has  ever done. Some of the the songs on the A side are completely exhuberant.
This is  strange, in that it comes right after &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, which
is the most pained and  frustrated album she has done. While &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
is an album of frustration  and pain and fear traced with hope and love, &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; is an album of love  and hope traced with frustration and pain and
fear. 
</P>
<P>I'm not so wild, in general, about &quot;happy&quot; music, but on &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; the  other elements keep it from becoming too sappy. Also &quot;The
Ninth Wave&quot; is about a  traumatic experience and is often very scary or
very sad or very haunting -- always  touching. 
</P>
<P>Overall, I don't like &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; as much as &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;, but this is  largely due to my personal biases (If both sides of
the album were as good as the B  side, I wouldn't be writing this article now,
though, because I would have suffered  from immediate massive coronary
failure....) &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is perhaps, in some  ways, a more
amazing album than &quot;The Dreaming&quot; due to the sheer diversity of it 
contents. It has something for everyone. It will almost certainly be a huge 
international success. It is a work of heart! 
</P>
<P>&quot;I still dream of all the love&quot;

Subject: Detailed review of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; 
</P>
<P>Here's a copy of something I just posted to net.music: 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Hound me down&quot;] 
</P>
<P>As previously advertized, what you are now reading is a track by track
review of  Kate Bush's new album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Side 1 -- &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate's foray into commercial music. Four of the five songs on this side have
 strong commercial potential. It seems likely that they will all be released as
singles  eventually. In the past, Kate has had the tendency to take one of the
most  uncommercial songs on an uncommercial album and release it as the first
single.  This backfired with &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, though. Will an
uncommercial song be  released as a single from this album? Probably not, but
we'll see... 
</P>
<P>(1) &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; 
</P>
<P>It doesn't hurt me <BR> Do you want to feel how it feels? 
</P>
<P>The first single. Kate's only disco song. As good as disco ever gets!
Throbbing  mechanical drums mixed with erratic subtle drumming form the
background  texture for a strange mixture of guitar, balalaika, and gentle to
firm melodic vocals  about the philosophical problem of never knowing what it is
like to be anyone else,  anyone other than oneself, and how this relates to art
and love. The twelve inch  single extended version contains vocal echoes whose
rhythms clash wonderfully with  those of the drums. 
</P>
<P>Major flaw with song: silly Fairlight sound playing out a four note hook. 
</P>
<P>A certified hit. Currently number 2 in England. Number 1 on WFNX (the trendy
 new wave radio staion in Boston). Receiving radio play on AOR and pop stations.
 Will certainly be Kate's first song ever to make the Top-40 in the U.S. Might
make  Top-10. Has firmly put Kate back in the limelight in England after five
years away  from it. Will guarantee that the album sells millions. Profits from
this song will pay  off mortgage on Kate's new 48 track recording studio. 
</P>
<P>(2) &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; 
</P>
<P>I found a fox -- come back ducks <BR> I'm gonna take him in my hands <BR>
His little heart, it beats so fast <BR> And I'm ashamed of running away 
</P>
<P>The third single? Will pay to have new 48 track recording studio converted
to  digital? 
</P>
<P>Nice rhythm. About being scared of love (and fans?) and overcoming that
fear. 
</P>
<P>On &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, background vocals were haunting and incisive
phrases, e.g.  &quot;Lock it -- lock it up&quot; and &quot;I want it all&quot;.
Here background vocals are &quot;Doot doot  doot doot doot&quot;. Not so
inpsiring. Song's still excellent, though. 
</P>
<P>(3) &quot;The Big Sky&quot; 
</P>
<P>That cloud <BR> That cloud -- it looks like ivy!    [it is &quot;Ireland&quot;
actually, WIE]
</P>
<P>The second single? Will pay for disk-based editing system in digital studio?

</P>
<P>Very up, positive, jubilant, celebrative song recommending a positive
attitude.  Overly cute backgrounds vocals (Himinee down, himinee down) evolve
into better  background vocals. Builds up a very very nice and complex rhythm,
but kind of  thrashes it to death at the end. 
</P>
<P>(4) &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; 
</P>
<P>And by the cat that takes the bird <BR> To hold the hunted 
</P>
<P>Beautiful! Amazingly beautifully haunting! Amazing background vocals. Can
you  listen to this without crying? A love song to mom. Piano ballad with with
slow,  strange, and erratic drum beat. Breaking plates and other sounds form
parts of the  rhythmic backbone. Inspirational fretless bass playing -- must be
Eberhard Weber!  Beautiful! Wonderfully strange and atmospheric Fairlight work.
So beautiful! So  beautiful! So beautiful! Send a tape of this song to your
mother on her birthday.  She'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>(5) Cloudbusting 
</P>
<P>You're like my yo-yo <BR> That glowed in the dark <BR> What made is
special, made it dangerous <BR> So I buried it <BR> Forget 
</P>
<P>The forth single? Will pay for life-time operating expenses of studio so
that Kate  will never have to write a commercial song ever again? The best of
the commercial  songs on the album. Better than any commercial song can possibly
be! How'd she do  it? A love song to a fugitive. Nice violins! Rhythm evolves
into military marching  snares at end. The charts will never before have seen
such a great song. 
</P>
<P>Side 2 -- &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; 
</P>
<P>The deeply moving story of a shipwrecked woman alone in the water at night. 
Supposedly based on the poem &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;, by Tennison. 
</P>
<P>(1) &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; 
</P>
<P>Like poppies, heavy with seeds <BR> They take me deeper and deeper 
</P>
<P>Gentle and sad piano ballad with acoustic guitar. The struggle is too much.
Let it  be over. &quot;Let me be weak. Let me sleep. And dream of sheep.&quot;
So good! 
</P>
<P>(2) &quot;Under Ice&quot; 
</P>
<P>Splitting -- splitting sound 
</P>
<P>Silver hairs spitting -- spitting snow Bass violin dirges. Sonar. Kate
chants.  Digeridu. Trapped under the ice! Haunting. Scary! Scares me shitless! 
</P>
<P>(3) &quot;Waking The Witch&quot; 
</P>
<P>You will burn! <BR> (Red red roses) <BR> You won't breathe! <BR> (Pix and
posies) <BR> Confess to me girl! <BR> (Red red roses go down) <BR> Guiltly!
Guilty! Guilty! 
</P>
<P>Undescribable! Totally. All of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; crammed into three
mintues?  Whales sing. Space and echoing piano playing over clips of expressions
used to wake  people up mutates into a battle between Mother Goose and Satan on
the mixing  console until they are carried away by the helicopters!
Unbelievable! Unbelievable! 
</P>
<P>(4) &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; 
</P>
<P>I'm not here <BR> But I'm not here<BR> 
</P>
<P>Starts off a little slow, but builds eventually into something quite
interesting. Nice  bass playing. More strange drum rhythms, especially for a
slow tempo song.  Backward vocals and strange digital effects. 
</P>
<P>(5) &quot;Jig of Life&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now is the place where the crystals meet <BR> We will look into the future 
</P>
<P>The most bizarre Irish jig you will ever hear. The Bothy Band meets the
Talking  Heads meet Richard Burton meets Run DMC meet Heart in Kate Bush's mind.
I  burst into tears the first time I heard this. It's that awesome! It's that
awesome! 
</P>
<P>(6) &quot;Hello Earth&quot; 
</P>
<P>I was there at the birth <BR> Out of the cloudburst <BR> The head of the
tempest <BR> Murderer! Murderer of time! <BR> Why did I go? 
</P>
<P>Paddy Bush overdubbed into an entire Greek ritual chorus alternates with 
celestial all-seeing, sadly warning Kate, U-boat space music and German whispers
of  the deep. Infinitely effective. Infinitely bizarre. Infinitely haunting.
Infinitely  wonderful. 
</P>
<P>(7) &quot;The Morning Fog&quot; 
</P>
<P>Know what? I love you better now <BR> ... <BR> I kiss the ground <BR> I
tell my mother <BR> I tell my father <BR> I tell my lover <BR> I tell my
brothers <BR> How much I love them 
</P>
<P>The happy results of the traumatic experience. Gently celebrative music.
Beautiful  guitar and bass playing. Very very touching. 
</P>
<P>The end. 
</P>
<P>And the beginning. 
</P>

<BR> Subject: Things that appeared on more than one song: TNW 
</P>
<P>In The Ninth Wave side, there are little things that appeared on more than
one  song, thus somehow tying the songs together. Here's what I've found: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Little light...&quot; (a leap of a perfect fifth) in &quot;And Dream
of Sheep&quot; &amp; &quot;Waking the  Witch&quot; (beginning part) 
</P>
<P>surf + seagull &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; &amp; &quot;Waching you
without Me&quot; (&amp; &quot;Hello  Earth&quot; ?? just before the 2nd Greek
chorus -- but it sounded more like wind than surf) 
</P>
<P>submarine sounds &quot;Under Ice&quot; &amp; &quot;Hello Earth&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Over Here&quot; (Spoken by male voice) &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; &amp;
&quot;Jig of Life&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Listen to me, Talk to me...&quot; (chopped up) &quot;Waking the Witch&quot;
&amp; &quot;Watching You  Without Me&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now I'm sure that there are other, more subtle things that are treated in a 
similar way, but since my equipment is lo-fi, that's all I can come up with.
Does  anyone else have any similar discoveries?

<BR> &gt; In The Ninth Wave side, there are little things that appeared on more
than one  song, thus somehow tying the songs together. Here's what I've found: 
</P>
<P>In addition to what you listed, there are a couple others I've found. The
first one  is very obvious. &quot;Get out of the waves. Get out of the water.&quot;
occurs in both 'Waking  The Witch' and 'Hello Earth'. This one is more difficult
to notice: &quot;We are of  water and the holy land of water&quot; occurs in
both 'Waking The Witch' and 'Jig Of  Life'. Can anyone make out what the voices
say in 'Waking The Witch' just before  &quot;We are of water....&quot;? 
</P>
<P>Also, some people were mentioning here a little while back musical themes
that  recur in different songs and musical pieces of some songs that appear on
other songs  on the album. Could someone point out some of these? I'm really bad
at noticing  things like this. I never even noticed that I have two different
versions of Kate's &quot;Ne  T'Enfuis Pas&quot; on record, until someone pointed
it out to me several days ago.

<P>IED enters the scene
</P>
<P>[Andrew B. Marvick's first regular posting:]
</P>
<P>Date: Wed, 16 Apr 86 22:52 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: Venturing into the Garden
IA 
</P>
<P>Hello, Kate fans. The following is the first, I hope, in a series of papers
devoted to  the relatively new scholarly field usually grouped under the heading
Kate Bushology.  As always,comments and criticism are encouraged, so long as
they contribute to the  body of Kate Bushological knowledge. 
</P>
<P>//IED0DXM JOB <BR> /*JOBPARM ROOM=GSM <BR> // EXEC SCRIPTDC,DEST=IBM6670 
</P>
<P>Venturing Into the Garden: <BR> A Look at Themes in Hounds of Love, Part I
(Beginning) 
</P>
<P>Paper contributed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree
Doctor  of Kate Bushology by Andrew Marvick K4735r 
</P>
<P>The following is the first in a series of personal essays which represent
one Kate  fan's attempts to come to grips with some of the countless messages
that lie within  the fabric of Kate Bush's new album, waiting to be dug up and
decoded. None of my  interpretations is meant to be taken as &quot;correct&quot;,
although for the sake of argument  lengthy qualifiers have been omitted. For
clarity's sake album titles are underlined,  song titles put between quotation
marks. To many fans I may seem to have a terrible  love of knit-picking; but I
am neither the first nor the last fan to whom no detail of  Kate's music is
insignificant or without interest; and it is to these patient, mildly  obsessive
fans that I offer the following reflections. 
</P>
<P>In this essay I will only discuss Hounds of Love proper; that is, Side One
of the  album. 
</P>
<P>And I will make no attempt here to unravel the many &quot;secret&quot; or
half-secret  voices, both lyrical and musical, which seem to multiply with each
new listening. I  sincerely hope that other fans are searching for and finding
these voices and that  they will consider sharing them with the rest of us in
the near future. 
</P>
<P>The first and last audible sounds of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; are
the same: a  synthetic drone based on an E-flat and its harmonic root in the
B-minor chord  around which the song revolves. This drone travels quietly but
insistently throughout  the recording like a musical parallel to the thematic
thread that connects the songs  of Hounds of Love. 
</P>
<P>The sonic textures of both the drone and the lead monophonic motif of the &quot;song&quot;
 are, at least in their final presentation, artificial. They are, as in purely
abstract art,  entirely non-referential, like an aural Rorschach image: the
listener can associate  freely in hearing these sounds in a way which is not
possible when hearing, say, the  Irish instrumentation of &quot;Jig of Life&quot;,
because these synthetic sounds were originated  and designed exclusively for &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; -- they are sounds without a  history, at once atemporal and
eternal within the space of the recording. (One can of  course identify them,
correctly or incorrectly, with the Fairlight CMI, but such an  association is a
Catch-22, since the nature of this synthesizer is in the potential for  the
complete effacement of its own sonic identity in favor of that of the user's 
imagination and his original sources.) 
</P>
<P>This internal, autonomous song-time, so to speak, is in keeping with the
circular  structure of the song itself (listen especially to the twelve-inch
remix, which returns,  in its final bars, to its point of origin not only
instrumentally and musically but  vocally and lyrically, as well.) 
</P>
<P>Whereas &quot;Jig of Life&quot; (or &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, with its
marching snare-drum tattoos)  is imagistic, or reference-specific, &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; seems to defy, through its  enigmatic lyrics and cyclical
structure, the very accessibility of sound which helped  to bring it and,
somewhat misleadingly, the album, to the public's attention. A good  proof of
the recording's elusive essence can be obtained by asking a new Kate fan,  or a
casual admirer of her &quot;hit record&quot;, what that solo synth motif &quot;sounds
like&quot;. 
</P>
<P>My own ears register a cat's plaintive miaow; but a friend told me recently
that it  seemed to her more like a cow's low, sped up and &quot;disguised,
somehow, by that  Fairlight she's always fiddling around with!&quot; Another
friend, listening to the same  sounds, heard a chorus of successive cries of the
question &quot;Why?&quot;, one cry dying  upon the next. Douglas Allen has
denigrated this sound (and the motif for which it  was developed), but his
reasons for this are unclear. 
</P>
<P>None of these interpretations is the &quot;true&quot; source. Yet all may be
considered  legitimate interpretations, because all were personally and honestly
felt by their  respective listeners. As with so many of the &quot;secrets&quot;
buried within the dense and  fertile soil of Kate's latest musical crop, the &quot;correct
answer&quot; may not be more  relevant than the many &quot;incorrect&quot; ones:
these interpretations are even encouraged, I  think, by Kate's music; and they
add to the richness and intricacy of the music's  design, in the same way, for
example, that the various &quot;mis-interpretations&quot; of the  &quot;weirdness&quot;
passage of &quot;Leave It Open&quot;-- based on the &quot;false&quot; assumption
that the  passage could only be understood when played backwards (resulting in
the phrase,  &quot;They said they were buried here,&quot; and its many variants)
-- actually contributed to  the recording's interest and mystery. 
</P>
<P>Appropriately, the theme of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is perrenial,
endless and  insoluble: the contrast between female and male attitudes, or
roles. The female  shows strength and endurance in adversity, surviving
indomitably under great  emotional strain: &quot;It doesn't hurt me...Do you
want to know/Know that it doesn't  hurt me?&quot; How else could she express,
with such clear-headed resignation, &quot;But see  how deep the bullet lies&quot;;
or pose a question with philosophical, almost  psycho-analytical implications, &quot;Is
there so much hate for the ones we love?&quot; 
</P>
<P>The male voice is active, aggressive, crudely seductive: &quot;C'mon baby,
c'mon  darlin'/Let me steal this moment from you now&quot;. But to be more
accurate about  which gender says what, or even to determine whether such an
interpretation is any  more than vaguely accurate -- this is beyond me. There is
in the lyrics, as in the  theme itself and the seamless succession of verse upon
chorus upon bridge, a  constant swapping of places. This deliberate confusion
and conflict of roles in  &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; presages the struggle
between action and the failure to act  which is taken up in the next track, &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The difficulty of facing intense love, the exchange of confidences and
resulting  vulnerability, become not only the central theme of &quot;Hounds of
Love&quot;, but a  recurring theme of the album, too -- see how, in the last
lines of The Ninth Wave,  that same admission of love is finally, soberly risked
(&quot;I'll tell my mother...How  much I love them&quot;). It is also the theme
of &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;, wherein the secret  shared with another person is
accorded tremendous emotional value -- is made to  seem as precious as some holy
relic, hidden for centuries by devout acolytes in the  depths of a private
shrine, exposed for the first time to a public whose adoration  may prove
fickle. The theme appeared earlier, in &quot;All the Love&quot;, except that the
 conclusion there was more pessimistic -- a resolution to withdraw rather than 
expose oneself to such emotional risk. This in turn was related thematically to 
&quot;Leave It Open&quot; (&quot;Keep it shut&quot;) -- in that case resolved
positively, as in &quot;Hounds of  Love&quot;, &quot;The Morning Fog&quot; and &quot;Under
the Ivy&quot;, while having less connection with  love, per se, than with
emotional relations in general, or with the appreciation of  human works, art,
etc. So, the final message of &quot;Leave It Open&quot; refers to the least 
tangible form of emotional magnet: &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;; and,
with the benefit  of hindsight, we can see movement from The Dreaming's thematic
generalities  expressed in reference-specific terms, to the sharp thematic focus
and relative sonic  abstraction of Hounds of Love. 
</P>
<P>But if &quot;weirdness&quot; is let in, and if something (simply the mind?)
is left open, then  what is it that, earlier in that song, had been locked up (&quot;I
kept it in a cage&quot;)? 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot; we may have the answer: &quot;It
breaks the cage and  fear escapes&quot; -- dangers of, and resulting fear of,
letting loose one's emotions. It may  be misleading: Kate has not written &quot;Fear
breaks the cage&quot;; the pronoun &quot;it&quot; may be  interpreted here as a
reference to something else besides fear -- madness, perhaps  -- so that the
natural inference -- that the pronoun signifies the manifest noun --  may be
incorrect. If the natural interpretation is the correct one, however, then the 
danger which arises from the terrible destructive power of fear -- fear of
madness  itself, perhaps -- brings us full circle, back to &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
and the line, &quot;But  I'm still afraid to be there&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The general, surface meaning of this song, already explained by Kate on
several  occasions, may be summarized as follows: the hounds represent the
unknown  response to love; by admitting love for and emotional dependence upon
another  person, one exposes oneself either to tremendous release and joy in
finding that love  accepted and returned (the friendly Weimeraners so
sensitively photographed by  John Carder Bush on the LP's sleeves); or to the
horror of rejection, humiliation and  emotional injury (the dogs that have
caught the fox). The human dilemma itself is  thus likened to a hound -- which
might be gentle and loving, or which might equally  prove vicious and deadly. So
the vivid scene in which the narrator encounters a  trapped fox becomes doubly
self-referential, for it deepens the basic analogy of  hounds to love (or to
death): the dogs have caught the fleeing, desperate, but  ultimately helpless
fox; in the same way, and with similar desperation, the narrator  feels trapped
by the possibilities and liabilities of concession to the advance of love;  and
in the end, he/she, too, falls helpless to that advance. 
</P>
<P>It is to this implicit meaning of the song that Kate adheres in her film,
rather  than to the equally vivid and literal imagery of fox and hounds which
runs through  the lyrics themselves. Could not the hounds, then, correspond, as
well, with the  driving, almost bestial masculine force which pled, in &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot;,  &quot;C'mon baby, c'mon darlin'/Let's exchange the
experience?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Rhythmically, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; seems to begin where the huge
climactic drum  tattoos at the climax of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; left
off. That climax, it is interesting  to see, occurs simultaneously with the
masculine call to love quoted just above.  Maintaining what for Kate Bush is a
relatively unusual &quot;constancy of &quot;rhythm&quot;&quot;,  (Interview by
Capital Radio's Tony Myatt for the 1985 Kate Bush Convention,  November 1985). 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; nevertheless steps up the pace and increases the
volume as the  hesitant lover steels her-/himself to take the emotional plunge,
so to speak, in such a  whirl of sonic activity that with the last, utterly
abandoned confession of the song (&quot;I  need love love love love love...&quot;),
the density of sound seems to tax the very limits of  demo-cum-master tape on
which it was recorded. 
</P>
<P>In fact, of course, this is still only a foretaste of what might be called
Hounds of  Love's &quot;catharsis in decibels&quot;, for in the last choruses of
&quot;The Big Sky&quot;, the  celebration of sheer sound does finally saturate,
if not the master, certainly the  typical vinyl pressings (especially those &quot;marbleized&quot;
American ones!), and I would  venture to say (at the risk of upsetting more
conservative audiophiles) that it is only  on compact disc that this
overwhelming musical shout of triumph resists distortion  completely. 
</P>
<P>We can now see that &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, too, shares a common thread
with several  other Kate Bush recordings, and that thread is, again (and for
want of better words),  emotional release, or the liberation of feeling. Kate
has herself &quot;explained&quot;  (Newsletter #17) how she tried, in the song,
to recapture a child's appreciation of the  glories of nature, when all sensory
experience was new and filled with great emotive  power. She has often suggested
that adults are still children -- and that, in  consequence, many of our adult
struggles are simply attempts to regain the wonder  once enjoyed in childhood. 
</P>
<P>There is a great deal more going on in &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, however,
than immediately  meets the ear. Take the lyrics, for example, their syntactical
complexity and shifts in  tense: in most of the song the narrator sings, &quot;I'm
looking,&quot; &quot;It's changing,&quot; etc. But  set against that release in
the present action and the promise of freedom to come is  a resentment in the
remembrance of the past -- &quot;You never understood me/You  never really
tried.&quot; Does this not imply that the narrator is in fact an adult, possibly
 herself -- and in this song the narrator does appear to be a woman, at least
when  she calls out, &quot;Tell 'em, sisters!&quot; -- trying to revive
childlike feelings which had been  suppressed by environment? A third
development arises out of this, namely the  child's imagination: with a child's
easy transference of the imagined onto the real,  the narrator -- and her
(imagined?) companions -- suddenly are &quot;leaving with the  Big Sky&quot;;
and, to show the clarity -- the hyper-realism, even --of the child's fantasy,  &quot;we
pause for the jet&quot;. No wonder then that we, too, are made to hear the jet.
As  always in Kate's music, the sound effect is indispensible, not merely
incidental; it  serves to reinforce in a very direct and graphic way both the
musical and the  narrative content.

</P>
<P>Venturing Into the Garden: <BR> A Look at Themes in Hounds of Love, Part 1
(Conclusion) 
</P>
<P>Paper contributed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree
Doctor  of Kate Bushology 
</P>
<P>by Andrew Marvick K4735r 
</P>
<P>Similarly subtle but equally significant shifts in meaning through the
alterations in  tense or mode appear both in &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot;. In  &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; the shift occurs in the
second verse, which begins the narrative as  a past event: &quot;I found a fox
caught by dogs/He let me take him in my hands&quot;. But as  the narrator
continues we suddenly move into the present: &quot;His little heart beats so 
fast/and I'm ashamed of running away/ From nothing real/I just can't deal with 
this...&quot; At first we merely listen to a story, set safely in the past --
factual, perhaps,  but part of another time, another world, even; memories of
the huge, magical and  dangerous world of childhood. Suddenly we must confront
this world -- we have  become children again, ourselves; and the scene of the
hunt, the trauma to a child's  consciousness in beholding a helpless, dangerous,
yet mysteriously gentle fox, is  presented to us as it happens. 
</P>
<P>In defiance of the safety of a historical event, we see the terrified but
passive fox  as it rests in the narrator's hands; the heart beats now. And in
fact, this crucial,  transitional moment is stressed -- almost underlined, in
fact -- musically by a single,  long, vigorously bowed {treble} F-natural in the
cello part, dubbed over the by-now  familiar ryhthmic cello obligato (in octaves
of the same note, on the opposite &quot;side&quot; of  the recording) that
enters the song at the beginning of that crucial second verse.  The leap into
the present (we are confronted with the moment, much as is the  heroine of ..us
The Ninth Wave at the climax of &quot;Jig of Life&quot;: violently, with the 
harshness of grim reality) from the safety of the past, effectively connects the
past  event --the fact safely remembered -- with the figuratively dangerous,
present  moment of truth in an adult romantic relationship (which the fox's
beating heart  perfectly represents). So, with the first chorus, facing
childhood fears in a forest, the  narrator sings: &quot;Help me someone&quot;,
but with the second chorus, experiencing the  new dangers of romantic love,
he/she cries, &quot;Help me ..us darling&quot;. 
</P>
<P>With a similar use of language, the narrator of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;
asks, in  the first verse of that song, &quot;Do you want to hear about the deal
that I'm making?&quot;  only to add, a moment later, &quot;And if I only could/
I'd make a deal with God&quot;.  Presumably this deal refers to the swapping of
gender roles -- perhaps of gender  itself -- between the man and the woman. A
transition has been made from the  present participle (fact) to the conditional
(fantasy); and with that transition is  expressed a realization of the
impossibility of such fundamental change in human  relations. No deals are made
with God, the words imply. This relationship begins --  and may end (witness the
tragic second verse) -- in the human sphere, on the  earthly level. 
</P>
<P>In fact, if we see this all too human relationship as struggling on the
earthly plane,  then perhaps we can see related meaning, at last, in the title
and its surrounding  textual lines, &quot;Be running up that road/Be running up
that building.&quot; Again we are  presented with an eternal struggle to reach
some new level of awareness -- in this  case a fuller understanding of
interpersonal relationships; just as in &quot;Sat In Your  Lap&quot;, the
struggle lay in reaching a fuller and deeper understanding of space, the 
universe and everything; and just as in, in &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; (and
here I'm really  treading on cat's ice), the struggle lay in attaining a new
spiritual understanding and  self-confidence, despite the constrictions of
personal or mundane limitations  represented by the titular pun on the words &quot;gaffer
tape&quot;. Yet, in keeping with the  general subject of &quot;love&quot; which
Kate has declared to be the main focus of Hounds of  Love, the struggles in &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot;, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and even (if we  consider long
enough the connotations of the lines &quot;You never understood me/You  never
really tried&quot;) &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, revolve around people's feelings
for and against  each other, rather than the more intangible subjects addressed
in &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;  and &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;. 
</P>
<P>With this in mind both &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot; and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
seem  wholly relevant, in complete thematic harmony with the three tracks which
precede  them. Both deal with interpersonal love -- in fact, familial love of a
very specific  kind. &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot; treats the subject of
a woman's love for her  child, however misguided or ill-fated that love might
be. The converse of the same  subject, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, investigates
the mutual love of a father and his son. It is  quite appropriate that one
should follow directly upon the other. And in fact the two  subjects have more
in common. Both refer to the protective instinct among family  members, and both
carry intimations of failure and eventual separation: in &quot;Mother  Stands
for Comfort&quot; there are the lines &quot;Mother will hide the murder/Mother
hides  the madman&quot;; in &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; we see not only the
explicit reference to Wilhelm  Reich's actual separation from Peter (&quot;You
looked too small/ In their big black  car/To be a threat to the men in power&quot;
-- a reference to the United States' Food  and Drug Administration, which
brought suit against Reich in the 1950s), but also  signs of an almost paternal
concern on the part of the boy for his father's safety: &quot;I  can't hide you
from the government&quot;. 
</P>
<P>No-one as far as I know has yet identified any specific source for the
subject of  &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot;, although I suspect that there
is one, whether  consciously drawn on by Kate or not. (Knowing Kate's admiration
for The Shining, I  might suggest as a possible source a memorable scene from
Stephen King's The  Dead Zone, in which the mother of a psychopathic murderer is
found to have been  protecting her son despite the knowledge that he was
continuing to kill; but there  are no doubt many other possible sources.) In the
case of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, however,  because the source is known to us,
there arises a great temptation to draw  comparison not only with the book
(Peter Reich's A Book of Dreams) --especially  as Kate has herself admitted
feeling an obligation to &quot;do justice to the book&quot; (Capital  Radio
interview, November 1985.) -- but also with the facts surrounding the elder 
Reich's sorry treatment at the hands of the FDA. Certainly there are many
specific  references to the subject in the song. 
</P>
<P>The phrase &quot;...something good is going to happen...&quot;, for example,
stems from a  recurrent foreboding, in Peter Reich's memoir, that &quot;something
bad was going to  happen.&quot; And, in fact, the military, march-like rhythms
in the recording may have  arisen directly from the author's descriptions of the
Cosmic Engineers, in which, as  a child, he had filled the rank of Lieutenant.
(It is with powerful irony, therefore,  that the footsteps of the government
agents in Kate's film for &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; are  shown keeping time with
the music.) 
</P>
<P>There are, however, significant discrepancies between these sources and
Kate's  work, as well. A single look at the marvellous Donald Sutherland in the
film suffices  to demonstrate that fidelity to the picture in her own mind's eye
bears far greater  weight with Kate than any responsibility to the facts. (In
reality Sutherland,  moustached and grey-haired as he appears in the film,
looks, I dare to suggest, a bit  more like Kate's own rather than Wilhelm Reich,
who was bald, clean-shaven, and  quite stocky!) Furthermore, the gorgeously
verdant but unmistakably English  countryside; the fascinating but factitious
gizmos in the laboratory; the utterly  intriguing -- because alliteratively and
phonetically suggestive -- reference to  Oregon rather than to Maine or Arizona,
where Orgonon and Little Orgonon were  located, respectively; the new
implications that arise from the surely deliberate  re-spelling of the name
Orgonon, itself-- the substitute, organon, referring not only  by pun to Reich's
once-controversial sexual theories, but also directly to the term  &quot;organon,&quot;
an alternative form for &quot;organum,&quot; which plays a major role in the 
philosophical writings of Francis Bacon; Ken Hill's quite breath-taking
Cloudbuster,  far more beautiful and impressive than the originals ever were;
and even the boy's  disclosure --with conspiratorial smile -- of a paperback
edition of A Book of Dreams  in his father's jacket pocket (an element of the
surreal or fantastic quite in keeping  with the gathering rainclouds attracted
by positive orgonotic energy); all of these  details combine to show that the
ultimate source for the recording, as for the film,  was the imaginative
authority of Kate Bush herself. 
</P>
<P>One final group of comments before this rumination on Hounds of Love is 
suspended, these in relation to one of the many aspects linking Sides One and
Two,  heretofore de-emphasized by Kate herself in an understandable wish to make
clear  to her public the basic autonomy of The Ninth Wave from Hounds of Love.
Apart  from the many images which define the atmosphere of both sides -- images
of sky,  clouds, water, darkness, storms and animals -- everywhere animals, from
the cat  (&quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot;) to the sheep (&quot;And Dream
of Sheep&quot;) to the  blackbird (&quot;Waking the Witch&quot;) to the gulls
and whales which are audible at various  points in The Ninth Wave, and back to
the fox and hounds, to name creatures from  this album alone -- apart from
these, there is one specific transitional motif which I  cannot help but see as
an implied invitation to move from the setting of  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; to
the structure of the whole of The Ninth Wave: namely, the dream.  (Not without
communicative purpose did Kate recently name Salvador Dali as a  favourite
artist.* (Newsletter Number 19, p.) 
</P>
<P>As &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; begins (&quot;I still dream of Organon {sic}&quot;),
so does The Ninth  Wave (&quot;Let me be weak, let me sleep/and dream of sheep&quot;).
In fact, Kate has  shown a longstanding fascination with dreams and dreamlike
states (I've been told  that she once described having dreamt of a long vigil in
the sea in an interview  dating as far back as 1978), and with the thin line
between waking and dreaming --  her interest in the experience of sensory
deprivation being one recent example. It  seems to me no mere co-incidence,
therefore, that Peter Reich's A Book of Dreams  unfolds in a fashion almost
eerily like that of The Ninth Wave; both develop around a  temporarily helpless
and incapacitated person drifting between conscious  understanding of real
danger and pain, and unconscious dream experiences. In fact,  if there is one
thing that Hounds of Love and The Ninth Wave do not include, amid  their huge
variety of subjects, images, symbols and partly or wholy hidden  references, it
is --mere co-incidence.

<BR> Subject: DOA / Francis Bacon 
</P>
<P>The first Marvick posting was interesting, the second was long winded. I
would  seriously like to ask the question, Doesn't Kate ever write music devoid
of  'deep-meaning'. Granted, we all get the message concerning Cloudbursting,
and  we are aparently informed of its meaning. How the essay ever got from
Kate's  musical tragedy to mention of Francis Bacon and his tragedy to mention
of Francis  Bacon (bravo on getting the correct Bacon, here) and his prophetic
masterpiece  &lt;Novum Organum, The New Atlantis&gt;, eludes me. Am I missing
satire, here. Or as  the nuns of good ole St. Josephs High kept on telling me, I
don't understand artistic  symbolism. To think that I actually believed that the
Scarlet Letter was a story about  an innocent who got knocked up by some
preacher, and that the Merchant of Venice  was about a typical loan shark in the
18th century. Maybe we should ask the most  important question, if we were to
reverse the context of RuTH would we then have  a song about somebody traversing
a ski slope afraid to fall? 
</P>
<P> &quot;We have harmonies, which you have not, of Quarter sounds and lesser
slides of  sounds. Diverse instruments of Musick, likewise to you unknown, Some
sweeter  than any you have, together with Bells and Rings that are dainty and
Sweet ...&quot;

Subject: Re: Kate Bushopathy 
</P>
<P>Mr. Alfke, I wouldn't expect someone who thinks that Madonna has merit to 
agree with the statement that pop music can be *real* literature. But I see no
reason  for you to spoil the fun of those who were forced to write lots of
unenjoyable papers  in high school on symbolism in *Hamlet* and *The Great
Gatsby* and the collected  works of Keats, and who have finally found something
that they can apply all of this  previously wasted education on and *enjoy*. 
</P>
<P>You might also speculate on the the fact that Kate refuses to talk about how
she  does her two-way messages or the contents of them, even though she *does*
admit  reluctantly that they are there, and how this strange attitude of hers
might bear on  her unwillingness to talk about symbolism in her words. 
</P>
<P>You might also speculate on the fact that when I asked John Carder Bush
similar  questions about his lyrics to those I asked Kate, he said that I was
right. Consider  that Kate has said on several occasions that John is one of her
biggest influences. 
</P>
<P>Your parody of my interview is I feel not very appropriate. This would be
much  more accurate: 
</P>
<P>DOUG: In the song &quot;The Dreaming&quot; you sing &quot;The Pull of the
Bush&quot; to mention the  attraction of the Aborigine in Australia to the
unspoiled land. But you are also  making a pun on your own name. Did you have
any special intention in doing this,  other than in being a bit humorous? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Pun on my name? I'm not sure what you mean. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: &quot;Bush&quot; occurs in &quot;Pull of the Bush&quot;. 
</P>
<P>KATE: So? 
</P>
<P>DOUG: That's your name. 
</P>
<P>KATE: I had nothing of the sort in mind when I wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But why is &quot;Bush&quot; capitalized on the lyric sheet? 
</P>
<P>KATE: It wasn't intentional. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: And in the video, the two male dancers pull on you from either side
when  you sing that line. 
</P>
<P>KATE: How people interpret your art really has nothing to do with you
anyway. But  it's great if people get as much out of it as they can. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: But surely... 
</P>
<P>KATE: Excuse me for a moment -- I have to use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>In any case, I just got a letter from John Carder Bush (and a pile of his
poetry)  that some might find somewhat interesting: 
</P>
<P>Dear Doug, 
</P>
<P>Thanks for your interesting letter; it's nice to meet someone these days who
gets  excited about words. 
</P>
<P>[Two pages of stuff...] 
</P>
<P>Entendres are, indeed, interesting things. Over the years I have evolved a
sort of  personal understanding of this planet/God/life in terms of rhyme. If
you can see the  Supreme Being as merely a harmonizing force, then coincidence,
synchronicity are  easily explained; as the poet makes his rhymes, the pattern
of life makes its rhymes.  And in double, tripple, or whatever, entendres, the
poet exercises a god-like  technique. 
</P>
<P>Keeping this in mind, I feel that for someone working in an artistic medium,
and  thence becoming &quot;godlike&quot;, by imitation, there must come a series
of levels of  progress, each level preceded by intense periods of obsession and
worry with the  creation -- late nights, wrong food, ill health, etc. -- and at
each level something  crystallises, and an energy vortex with a consciousness of
its own starts going. 
</P>
<P>Once it is able to generate its own creative direction, it needs to be fed
and  looked after like any machine, but it can be relied on to offer up an
image, a line, in  which the levels are all there, up and down, and can be
understood depending on the  level of the receiver. Sufi stories, Zen stories,
Greek myths all have this spiralling  mult-interpretation power, as do all the
great written works of religion. You can  keep coming back to them and finding
the next level confirmed as you grow. 
</P>
<P>So I am sure you are right when you find these meanings in Kate's music, but
 whether it was conscious or unconscious is not important if you accept that she
is a  vehicle for the Great Rhymer. Kate's subject matter for her lyrics has
always been  extraordinary, which I think comes from an ability to empathise
with life forms that  is unusually sensitive. 
</P>
<P>So, I hope you enjoy these poems and watch out for Big Sky, soon to be
released  over here and the video is the best so far. 
</P>
<P>All that's good, 
</P>

<P>Jorn asks: <BR> &gt; 5) That mysterious Madame Maria Nanky, whose cover

acknowledgements. 
</P>
<P> Pretty Good Authority (PGA) tells us that Madame Maria Nanky, Enrico
Baratta,  Reverand Normal and others are fictional characters invented quite a
while ago by  Kate and her brother Paddy. Sharp-eyed viewers might be able to
spot Mr. Baratta  in the Experiment IV video as the silhouette visible through
the window of the  Major's (?) office as Kate/Monster brings in the tea.

<P>On the back cover of HOL, Kate is supposed to be Ophelia in a lifejacket. 
</P>
<P>Ophelia was in love with Hamlet who pretended to be mad to get rid of her.
She  then went mad herself. She drowned in a river that she used to put flowers
into as a  message to people (the flowers not the drowning). The picture itself
is inspired by a  painting by John Everett Millais. -- Steve ZPJ

Subject: &quot;Ophelia&quot; and &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; 
</P>
<P> &gt; On the back cover of HOL, Kate is supposed to be Ophelia in a
lifejacket. 
</P>
<P>This is not strictly accurate. All that we can say for sure about this
photograph is  that it represents the protagonist of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;.
All else is supposition,  however reasonable. 
</P>
<P>Kate has not actually acknowledged the close visual link between the Ninth
Wave  photo(s) and Millais's 1851-52 painting, &quot;Ophelia&quot;. An
interviewer once suggested an  indirect connection, in noticing the likeness of
the Ninth Wave shots to a picture  which Kate owns, painted by an unidentified
artist, entitled &quot;The Hogsmill Ophelia&quot;.  Kate once mentioned that she
bought this picture at a time when she hadn't  anything like the money to afford
it. It depicts an infant (or a doll) floating on its  back in a dirty gutterlike
area. 
</P>
<P>Kate has, however, acknowledged and expressed a deep love for Millais's
early  Pre-Raphaelite work, and specifically praised his &quot;A Huguenot, on
St.  Bartholomew's Day, Refusing to Shield Himself from Danger by Wearing the 
Roman Catholic Badge&quot; (1851-52). 
</P>
<P>Kate's brother, John Carder Bush, has said that Kate and he attended the
great  &quot;Pre-Raphaelites&quot; exhibition mounted at the Tate Gallery in
1984, so there is good  reason to assume that she is at least somewhat familiar
with the imagery in question.  Of course, some of it, including &quot;Ophelia&quot;,
is famous, and part of the English  people's collective subliminal self-image,
so to speak; reasonable assumptions of  familiarity can be made on that basis,
too. 
</P>
<P>There are several other veiled references to Pre-Raphaelite sources in
Kate's  work, including two likely allusions to J. W. Waterhouse's 1888 version
of &quot;The Lady  of Shalott&quot; (or possibly to other related images,
including the many &quot;Elaine&quot; scenes  in the British canon). Knowing
that Kate is aware of this pictorial legacy, then, we  may even see the
photograph of ivy on the back of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; as a 
Pre-Raphaelitesque (sorry!) reference; but no evidence proves it.

<P>Greets. 
</P>
<P>A couple of 'Kate spots' in this month's 'Q' magazine. Details follow. 
</P>
<P>Firstly the free tape on the cover features R.U.T.H., amoungst some other
rather  good tracks. The tape is entitled &quot;Drive! An hour of cruisin'
classics&quot;. Inside the  cover a small photo of Her Kateness and a few words
: 
</P>
<P>3 KATE BUSH Running Up That Hill 
</P>
<P>Aside from her breakthrough effort, Wuthering Heights, this intoxicatingly 
rhythmic beauty from August 1985 was Bush's most successful single, as well as
her  most significant, signalling a new complexity and maturity for the already
prodigious  talent. According to the astonishing lyric, she wished to swap
places with no less  than God. Pushing things a tad, even for Kate. A
wizardette, a true star.

Subject: Tennyson + de la Tour
</P>
<P>The &quot;ninth wave&quot; reference is not found in Tennyson's &quot;Holy
Grail&quot;. Although it  is from the &quot;Idylls&quot;, it is part of &quot;The
Coming of Arthur&quot;. The false reference was a  mistake which Kate did
discover before the release of the first edition of the album,  but which she
could not prevail upon the printers to correct. Later pressings  incorporate the
correction. According to one interviewer, she was very distressed by  the error.

<P>&gt; Surely the author has misunderstood the lyric?
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;If I only could <BR> &gt; I'd make a deal with God <BR> &gt;
and get him to swap [?] places&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Is it &quot;swap OUR places&quot; or &quot;swap places&quot;? And in
any case, isn't she talking  about swapping places with the significant other
person, and God is the person  facilitating (so to speak) the swap? 
</P>
<P>Well, it is indeed OUR places, and I too had always thought that Kate was 
wanting God to swap her place with that of a lover. But grammatically, it still
works  the other way: 
</P>
<P>'I'd get him (God) to swap our (God's and my) places&quot; 
</P>
<P>But the following lyric, &quot;I'd be running up that road&quot; hardly
seems to be an act  worthy of a God(dess).

<BR> Subject:  The Coming of Arthur 
</P>
<P>Hello All, 
</P>
<P>You might be interested in the full story of the miscredit on the back of &quot;Hounds
 of Love&quot; 
</P>
<P>At HOMEGROUND we got hold of an advance copy of the album sleeve in late 
August 1985. Being already aware of the Arthurian connection from something Kate
 had said to us some time earlier, I was keen to look up the poem and get the
full  context. My first discovery was indeed that Kate had credited the wrong
poem, &quot;The  Holy Grail&quot; rather than &quot;The Comming of Arthur&quot; 
</P>
<P>We let EMI know, who told Kate, by phone in the middle of some promotional 
interviews if memory serves. 
</P>
<P>There was time to change the UK vinyl lp covers, but not the CD inserts. 
</P>
<P>When Kate was speaking to Dave Cross on the phone in early September 1985
she  was extremely grateful.
