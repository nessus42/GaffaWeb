      <BR> Subject: Garry Numan 1979 </P>
    
    <P>P.S. I have on video tape some of the footage from 1979 British Pop and
      Rock Music Awards. Garry Numan won best male singer, and Kate gets to give
      him the award, but he's not there -- he's in Philadelphia and accepts the
      award over a live satelite link, looking and acting like he's in tenth
      stage catatonia. </P>
    
    <P>Later, Kate wins the award for best female singer, and when she accepts
      the award she says something like &quot;I'm glad I'm not here over
      satelite, because it look like it really freaks you out!&quot; </P>

    <P>In the recent readers' poll in Sounds, Kate scored a double success
      being voted top female vocalist and also heading the list for female sex
      object! </P>
    
    <P>Behind Kate in the vocalist section were Liz Frazer, Siouxsie, Suzanne
      Vega, and Annie Lennox. Madonna was runner-up to Kate in the female sex
      object category. Best male vocalist was Peter Gabriel, who also had the
      best single with Sledgehammer and best promo video for the same song. PG
      and Kate's single Don't Give Up came 8th. Hair of the Hound was voted 10th
      best retail video. Best British band, best new band and best LP went to
      The Mission. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Best Female Singer </P>
    
    <P>More KT news for Americans: Kate won Best Female Singer at the British
      Record Industry Awards AGAIN! [Last year she was nominated, but didn't
      actually win! --WIE] And this time she won without even having released a
      new studio album. Despite this, she was very prominent in the British
      charts in 1986, first at the beginning with the &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
      and &quot;The Big Sky&quot; singles, and then at the end with the Peter
      Gabriel duet (a big hit in the U.K., in the singles charts for many
      weeks), and the Whole Story LP with its accompanying single (which latter
      record was the only commercial disappointment of the lot). </P>
    
    <P>And for those who missed Kate on Entertainment Tonight last night
      (February 10), you didn't miss much. In the forty-five second story on the
      &quot;BPI&quot;'s, as they're called, Kate appeared for all of .75
      seconds. She looked smashing in a quasi-Cossak-collared black suit, with
      her hair up. Not to worry if you didn't see her --the entire Awards show
      is scheduled for syndication, airing later on this month, so scour your TV
      Guides over the next couple of weeks!</P>

      <BR> From: ganzer%trout@nosc.mil (Mark T. Ganzer)
      <BR> Subject: British Record Industry Awards Program </P>
    
    <P>The British Record Industry Awards program mentioned back in Feb. made
      its appearance in Los Angeles last night on KHJ Ch. 9. </P>
    
    <P>As mentioned previously, Kate won best British female award (they have
      such good taste). She looked smashing in her black dress, although it
      appeared she might have been hitting the Kit-Kats a little much recently
      (Could this be the results of a new album in the works? naw, probably just
      normal TV distortion). She also presented Peter Gabriel with the best
      British male award. Kate's 1986 accomplishments were listed as four top 40
      singles, two top 10 albums (both double platinum), with &quot;The Whole
      Story&quot; reaching No. 1. </P>
    
    <P>The program was hosted by BBC radio personality Guy Davies, and the MC
      was Jonathon King. Performing on the show were Spandau Ballet, Simply Red,
      Level 42 (a bad lip sych performance), Chris De Burgh, Curiosity Killed
      the Cat, Five Star, and Whitney Houston (what's she doing on a British
      awards show? Must be the hook to draw more of an American audience). The
      award winners are old news by now, but include Paul Simon, Dire Straits,
      Five Star, the Housemartins, the Bangles, and the Pet Shop Boys. An award
      for Outstanding Contribution to British Music was given to Eric Clapton.
      It was interesting to see what has been going on across the big pond for
      someone like myself who only had a passing interest in pop music for the
      past 10 years (in fact, I know of Kate only by accident, having caught the
      Hammersmith concert on the USA cable network. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
      is one of the few songs that sent shivers up my spine when I first heard
      it. Indeed, I still prefer that version to either the original or new
      version. That ought to start another argument. But I digress....) </P>

    <P>The nominations for the 1990 BPI Awards have been announced. Kate has
      been nominated twice: for Best British Female Artist and Best British
      Producer. Nigel Kennedy, whom we know plays on Kate's album, was nominated
      in the category of Best Classical Recording for his version of Vivaldi's
      The Four Seasons. </P>

    <P>Now that you're all thoroughly bored by all this gory detail here's
      something I've been meaning to type in for a long time. It's from Sounds
      magazine (I think) last year or early this year under a heading, The Sol
      awards. It's not very complimentary I'm afraid but anyway ... </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Inland Revenue Award for the greatest contribution by an

      fun by comparison : KATE BUSH.&quot; </P>

    <P>The pop poll 93 of the German magazine Musikexpress/sounds (2/94) has
      Kate at the top of the vote list in the category 'darling of the year'. I
      don't know how that vote took place, but I presume that me/sounds gave a
      list of people/bands in each of the many categories, and in one Kate is on
      top: </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate in FHM </P>
    
    <P>Recently, FHM listed the top 100 sexiest women of all time. Kate came in
      at number 78 (although she should have been higher). This is what they

    <P> Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>Mad Singer </P>
    
    <P>Discovered by Pink Floyd Guitarist Dave Gilmour in a Surrey pub, this
      37-year-old songstress first made her name in 1978 with her caterwauled
      chart topper &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Similarily off-key hits like &quot;The
      Man With the Child in His Eyes&quot;, &quot;Babushka&quot;, &quot;Running
      Up That Hill&quot;, ensued; throughout it all she remained as gorgeous as
      she was mammacious. </P>
    
    <P>Sexiest Moment: That infamous &quot;nipple&quot; poster. </P>
    
    <P>As you can see it is rather inaccurate, they can't spell Babooshka and
      it is pretty degrading but at least she got a mention in a list that she
      should have dominated. --Steve ZPJ </P>
