Subject: KBC trivia 
</P>   
<P>I just got some back issues of the KBC newsletter (unfortunately, they are
out of  many of them), and here's some interesting trivia from the first couple
(from 1979): 
</P>   
<P>Kate had not read &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; at the time she wrote the
song. 
</P>   
<P>&quot;Wow&quot; was Kate's try at a Pink Floyd song. &quot;Kite&quot; is a
Bob Marley song. 
</P>   
<P>&quot;Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake&quot; is a Patti Smith song.

Subject: What is so different about KB? 
</P>   
<P>&gt; It is almost like it was some kind of cult or religious following.... 
</P>   
<P>Kate Bush probably has the most dedicated following of any artist in the
world.  (There was a review for &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; in Melody Maker which
read &quot;Miss Bush's  frighteningly intense fans will already know that the
second single from &quot;Hounds of  Love&quot; is a dreamy, gentle intense
Sousa-esque matching tune chockablock with the  usual whimsy.&quot; Yow, are we &quot;frighteningly
intense&quot;? The review gave a nice  description of the song too. To bad it
doesn't seem quite overly positive....) 
</P> 
<P>What makes her fans so dedicated? I guess that to those whom she reaches,
she  touches them more deeply than other musicians touch anyone. To those who
she  reaches, her music takes them to another world -- this world. This world
viewed  through Kate-colored glasses. An escape from reality into reality. Where
one is  shown the beauty of ugliness and the ugliness of beauty. A world where
estranged  lovers settle their differences by turning into mules. Where
electronic swallows and  blackbirds swoop and dive through the recesses of the
inner mind. Where hounds  attack to tear you apart with love and witches try
themselves. Where Irish jigs and  African drums and Tennyson poems and movies
about vampires are coherently  aspects of One. Where frustration and pain are
fundamental and essential, but  where there is always hope and love and joy. A
world of infinite pain and infinite  pleasure. A mirror for all that is
important in life. Life itself. 
</P> 
<P>Uh, er, um..... I'm sorry....

Subject: Kate Bush influences 
</P>   
<P>Well here's a list of some of the musicians that I recall Kate saying have 
influenced her: 
</P> 
<P>David Bowie, John Lennon, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Killing Joke, King
Crimson,  Peter Gabriel, The Beatles, Roy Harper, David Byrne, Brian Eno, Brian
Ferry, Stevie  Wonder, Captain Beefheart, Rolf Harris, early Roxy Music, Nat
King Cole, Frank  Zappa, Donovan, Steely Dan, Windom Hill, ECM, Eberheart Weber,
Alan Stivel, A.  L. (Bert) Loyd, Ewan MacCall, Delius, Eric Satie, Debussy, The
Eagles, The TV  National Iranian Chamber Orchestra, Pipers Rock, Kate and Anna
McGarrigle,  Choir of King's College Chapel, The Bothie Band, Billy Holliday,
Buddy Holly, Jules  and The Polar Bears, Bob Marley, Patti Smith, .... 
</P> 
<P>She also claimed to be influenced by the energy, emotion, and newness (at
the  time) of Punk music. 
</P> 
<P>She says that her song &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; was inspired by seeing a
Stevie Wonder  concert. How &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; came out of that, I
don't know... but art is strange! 
</P> 
<P>She once said that after hearing Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; she
nearly couldn't  write music again, because she thought it said &quot;everything
there is to say&quot;. 
</P> 
<P>The song &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is clearly based on a Rolf Harris song
from the sixties  called &quot;Sun Arise&quot;. 
</P> 
<P>She has also said that she loves backwards vocals. 
</P>   
<P>&quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;

<P>I was in a mall a few days back and happened to see a book called something
like  &quot;The New Rolling Stone Encyclopaedia of Music&quot; or something like

like this: 
</P> 
<P>Kate Bush caused quite a stir in some circles back in '78 with &quot;The

Subject: Erotics 
</P>   
<P>And about this erotic undercurrent that's always been there... there are
some  things that have been puzzling me for a while. Like in &quot;L'Amour Looks
Something  Like You&quot; Kate sings at the end &quot;I find I'm living in that
evening with that feeling of  sticky love inside&quot;. What is this feeling of
sticky love inside? She's not talking about  *seamen* is she? Gosh. Is the
feeling of old seamen inside you something that is fun  to remember? Perhaps
some of the women on the list would like to elaborate. 
</P> 
<P>And in &quot;Ran Tan Waltz&quot; Kate sings &quot;But some night she'll run
back in fright if  she picks on a Dick that's too big for her pride.&quot; I
don't get it. Are all of the  woman's extramarital boyfriends named &quot;Dick&quot;?
And why would they be too big  for her pride? Oh... golly, she's not talking
about penises, is she? Well why would a  penis be too big for the woman's pride?
I don't get it. Could someone explain this  to me. 
</P> 
<P>And once in an interview, Kate was asked what her favorite songs on &quot;The
 Dreaming&quot; were, and for one of them, she said &quot;Nice To Swallow&quot;.
Now, there's no  &quot;Nice To Swallow&quot; on the album. There's &quot;Night
Of The Swallow&quot;, so Kate must be  making a pun. But why &quot;Nice To
Swallow&quot;? Oh, golly. She's not talking about  penises again, is she?!? Or
maybe seamen again? 
</P> 
<P>This reminds me of one of my friends who was in my M.I.T. dorm. He went to 
Wellsley for a semester as an exchange student. In a biology class there, the 
professor was talking about how seamen has a high salt content. One of the
students  blurted out &quot;But it tastes so sweet!&quot; and then she
immediately looked very  embarrassed. Maybe someone would like to elaborate and
tell us whether or not  seamen and/or penises are nice to swallow and whether
seamen is salty or sweet. 
</P> 
<P>Well, I'm pretty confused now, but at least I can rest assured tonight that
since I  haven't used any profanities here, that at least *I* haven't offended
anyone today.

Subject: &quot;Never for Ever&quot; 
</P>   
<P>Don't always believe stickers. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; has the sticker that
says &quot;Contains  'Suspended In Gaffa' as seen on MTV'. Right. Maybe MTV
showed it twice. And  the most recent U.S. pressing of &quot;Never for Ever&quot;
has a sticker which says &quot;Featuring  'Never for Ever'&quot;. 
</P> 
<P>Now, there is *no* song &quot;Never for Ever&quot; on the album, but putting
that sticker  on the album sure is a way to drive KB fans crazy, because Kate
*did* record a song  called &quot;Never for Ever&quot;, but she decided to leave
it off the album. 
</P>   
<P>&gt; And what is Kate doing on Harvest records? 
</P>   
<P>KB was originally on Harvest in the U.S. The first U.S. pressing of &quot;The
Kick  Inside&quot; was on Harvest and had the Canadian cover. She was very
shortly moved to  EMI-America, however. In Canada, she was probably on Harvest
for a longer period  of time.

<P>The fact that there are as many totally devoted fans as there are for Kate
Bush in  the United States, where she's gotten nearly no support, publicity, or
hype from her  record company, is in itself strong evidence that her music
deserves the praise that  she has received.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: Early KT 
</P>   
<P>I was going to try to set J. Rossi straight about early KT but Doug already
did an  excellent job, and, besides, Mr. Rossi is already recanting. But I, too,
want to stress  that this was long, long ago. 
</P> 
<P>The Kick Inside was universally regarded as a major stylistic departure from
 anything else on the market in 1978. I remember hearing &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
on  the radio in April of that year and thinking that *no-one* sounded like
that; but it  wasn't just the voice, there was that bizarre phrasing -- the
lyrics were twisted into  strange phonetic jumbles, and the time signature had a
way of changing every few  bars. (In the final measures before the fade-out, if
you follow the drummer's  back-beat, you can hear him lose track himself, and
skip a few beats rather than  make a mistake). This was a very young girl, still
without control over the  production; it's easy to hear the weaknesses in the
early music now, when we have  The Dreaming and Hounds of Love to compare it to,
but The Kick Inside was  definitely a break-through album in its day. 
</P> 
<P>Lionheart always gets abused nowadays, mainly because it's so smooth and
safe.  That was audible even when it first came out, but remember that Kate had
to put  that LP out in November of 1978, only five or six months after The Kick
Inside. Only  a few of the songs on that album were newly written, and she still
had little control  over the arrangements or sound. Even so, Lionheart has a
sonic intimacy and  eccentricity that sets it far apart from other pop music of
its time. And there are  many first class Kate Bush musical ideas in it, as
well. 
</P> 
<P>The tour, too, was unanimously accepted as completely unique, mainly because
of  the use of choreography and theatrical methods in performance. And once
again,  that was *seven* years ago.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: Kate and the commercial 
</P>   
<P>In response to John's ominous predictions of Kate &quot;selling out&quot;,
let's set aside for  the moment the fact that nobody can reasonably predict what
Kate's next album  will sound like before it is heard; and come instead to the
question of what defines  &quot;selling out&quot;. 
</P> 
<P>The big mistake being made in Love-Hounds (and everywhere else, for that 
matter) is the confusion of &quot;innovation&quot; with &quot;quality&quot;. The
words are not  synonymous. I am willing to concede that Hounds of Love was
probably not as  &quot;daring&quot; or &quot;challenging&quot;, from a musical
standpoint, as The Dreaming. This does  not, however, by any means indicate that
Hounds of Love is a &quot;worse&quot; album, even in  reference to its musical
content alone. The Dreaming is raw where Hounds of Love  is polished. Kate may
hone the jagged edge of her creative development to an even  smoother finish in
the future, or she may react against her recent tendency to  perfect a fully
developed style. This is a relatively insignificant matter, when one  realizes
that, whether partially accessible to a large and unconsidering public or not, 
whether rough or smooth in texture and effect, whether related to recognizably 
&quot;commercial&quot; musical idioms or not, it still cannot fail to be the
best music of its time,  because it will evolve out of the mind of Kate Bush. 
</P> 
<P>There are different ways of defining the nature of &quot;progressive&quot;
music. Is  Thursday Afternoon, Brian Eno's nth edition of non-commercial and
highly  sophisticated ambient music, really deserving of greater respect than
Gabriel's  unabashedly commercial new record, simply because Eno's work still
bears  hallmarks of an avant-garde sensibility, despite the inescapable fact of
its similarity  to Discreet Music, a recording of nearly ten years earlier? I
don't particularly like  Gabriel's venture into the musical idiom of Otis
Redding, but I see no reason why  his deliberate change of direction should be
deplored, simply because the result is  more palatable to the public. Should not
the stagnant productions of a self-conscious  avant-garde be deplored equally? 
</P> 
<P>For the same reason, I will argue, Ferry's latest -- and admittedly highly 
commercial, even cloyingly commercial -- record, is not to be regretted more
than  the recent work of his renegade colleague; there is, after all, in the
tameness of &quot;Is  Your Love Strong Enough?&quot;, at least a sign of
movement, evidence of a kind of  creative development which Thursday Afternoon's
rolling fields of arcane sound  lack. Commerciality is not in itself proof of
poor quality or low artistic value;  conversely, an unswerving devotion to
pre-conceived ideas of the &quot;new&quot; does not in  itself gain admission
into the neverland of the &quot;good&quot;. So, as we recognize the  audible
signs of commercial finish in Hounds of Love, we should appreciate, as well, 
the novelty that such a finish can acquire, when born of a union of the
commercial  and -- Kate Bush.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: The Fairlight 
</P>   
<P>Kate first learned of the Fairlight during her sessions on Peter Gabriel's
third  solo LP. She hired Richard James Burgess, the leader and synth wiz of a
shortlived  electro-pop group called Landscape, to help her learn more about the
technical  aspects of composing on the Fairlight. 
</P> 
<P>Since Never For Ever Kate has done all of her own Fairlight work. That means
 that for five years and two history-changing LPs she has been in complete
control of  all aspects of the Fairlight (and of everything else connected with
her art). Don't  you think just once you could try catching up with the facts
before launching your  inept slurs, Rossi?

airplane engine (or something similar  -- in fact, that's what I thought it was
for years, until someone told me it was a  digerdoo), again showing how FUCKING
brilliant Kate is.

ed191-bq%violet.Berkeley.EDU@berkeley.edu (Taylor) <BR> Subject: Digital
recording &amp; Kate 
</P>   
<P>(Really from Hugh Maher) 
</P> 
<P>Glad to hear someone was interested in my posting yesterday - Thanks Andrew!
 Whatever anyone might say about IED, at least he's consistently the most polite
 person on the net! 
</P> 
<P>However, I don't remember the exact source and date of that interview -I 
remember reading it after having a discussion with Peter Morris and the others
at  Homeground about Kate's attitude toward digital recording. He showed me this
 article/interview that she gave to a magazine called something like &quot;Electronic
 musician&quot; or &quot;Modern Music and Recording&quot; or something the
equivalent of  &quot;Musician&quot; magazine in Britain. I'm pretty sure that
the interview was given in the  wake of the release of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
(Fall '82 or spring '83). Perhaps you could  scour your old copies of Homeground
for the &quot;Medialog&quot; section and track down  articles around this time
in magazines that sound like this. 
</P> 
<P>I'm certain, though, of the content (I have a weirdly sharp memory for this
stuff,  but it tends to fail rapidly in other areas!). She definitely did do
comparison tests  between analog and digital and expressed a preference for the
analog recording,  although she admitted that it could probably just be due to
past biases. Also, when  she said that the analog was &quot;warmer&quot; she
also said something about how the digital  was somewhat &quot;harsh&quot; - but
NOT in terms of the actual sound of the instruments as  many claim; but more
along the lines that it was TOO good at perfectly reproducing  the sound of the
instrument without any background hiss or noise. This seemed to  throw her off,
and she DEFINITELY made a statement that she LIKES a certain  amount of tape
hiss &quot;Just to remind you that you're listening to a tape&quot; or something
 like that. She even said something like &quot;If you listen to &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; closely, you  can still hear a bit of hiss, which is comforting&quot;
(I don't know if &quot;comforting&quot; was  the word, but that was the general
idea). 
</P> 
<P>She also went on about what a nightmare it was to digitally mix &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;  (this is from the one-column Musician feature on her home
recording techniques in  the spring of 1983) and how certain parts took &quot;easily
twice as long as analog&quot; to do;  However, her liking for the end product
and the &quot;edge&quot; that digital mixing gives is  supported in the fact
that &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was also digitally mixed. 
</P> 
<P>I think she should take a leaf out of Peter Gabriel's book and think about
using a  combination of the two - the digital recorder for the electronic stuff,
fairlight, drums,  and voices (which all work great with digital) and use an
analog for the acoustic  instruments. I have to admit, the opening fiddle on &quot;Jig
of Life&quot; is one of the most  earthy and real sounding acoustic instruments
I've ever heard on CD, and it was  done on analog. This way, she'd have the best
of both worlds. As it stands, her  constant re-playing of the analog tape over
and over (I think) tends to erase the  highs and generally muddy up the sound.
This might explain why &quot;Hounds&quot; doesn't  sound as good as &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; in terms of clarity. I have to admit, I sort of worry  about her
using Del as the sole engineer - sure it saves money, but how good is he  around
the studio?

<P>I'll be curious to see how the next album sounds, since it will be done from
start  to finish in her home studio. (The basic tracks of Hounds of Love were
recorded on  an 8-track as demos, and then were transferred onto the new analog
24-track, which  probably has a lot to do with the &quot;muddier&quot; HOL
sound).

</P>   
<P>To Hugh Maher: 
</P> 
<P>The passages of muddy sound you notice are undeniable in HoL. But IED thinks
 he understands what Kate means when she says that signs of hiss are &quot;comforting&quot;.
 At any rate, he has his own reason for appreciating such traces of hiss,
especially in  Kate's work. First, we're talking about traces of hiss which come
and go throughout  a given track, and these can only be detected on the CD
versions. Both other media  have far too much hiss or other surface noise of
their own to make Kate's  master/demo hisses audible. 
</P> 
<P>Now, what's interesting is hearing where the hiss comes in and goes out. On 
&quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot;, for example, not only can you hear where
the  different master tracks are augmented by the earlier demos (or perhaps vice
versa),  but you can also hear very distinctly a constant low hum, which may
come from the  Fairlight (being left on throughout the recording). Whatever the
cause, these traces  of the recording experience are like traces of
underpainting beneath the final  touches on an oil painting: they are reminders
of the artificiality of the illusion, the  stamp of the studio environment. 
</P> 
<P>Anyway, that would explain her comment that &quot;she LIKES a certain amount
of  tape hiss, 'Just to remind you that you're listening to a tape'. It's the
artist's love  of process, an unwillingness to remove all traces of her &quot;handwriting&quot;,
so to speak.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: unconnected reflections 
</P>   
<P>The following are a series of unconnected reflections on Matterse Katte 
Bushologicke which IED originally sent off to individual victims, mainly MarK T.
 Ganzer. This explains the author's peculiar (for him) references to a
non-existent  &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. Please disregard those. 
</P>   
<P>Dear MarK. 
</P> 
<P>As I'm sure you're aware by now, I'm in the midst of making a new 
transcription of the complete lyrics, emphasizing their narrative side, and I've
finally  gotten almost all the way through. 
</P> 
<P>I can't get over how terrific Kate's lyrics are. The biggest eye-opener so
far has  come out of my feeble attempts to re-structure the lines' break-off
points by trying  to keep stricter ties with the musical structure -- something
which none of the  earlier transcribers has ever managed with any consistency.
In doing this, I've been  gaining a new appreciation of the complexities of the
song-structures. 
</P> 
<P>There are very few songs -- even including the early ones --which follow a 
conventional verse-chorus pattern. Almost all of the songs include a third, &quot;bridge&quot;
 component, and there isn't a single song that doesn't involve a significant 
re-organization of the verses' original rhythms and melodic lines in later
verses.  This is completely at odds with the tendency in pop music in general,
where  virtually all songs follow a simple verse-chorus pattern (once in a while
adding a  radically shortened and usually instrumental bridge interlude), and
where the  melodic line or the lyric metre is rarely altered by so much as a
note or a syllable. In  Kate's recent songs her shifts and additions are so
significant that the job of figuring  out where one verse ends and another
begins becomes quite difficult. 
</P> 
<P>Take &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;. [Explanation omitted, see TD-section.
--WIE]
</P> 
<P>... 
</P> 
<P>I've had quite a run of similarly fortuitous, minor but exciting little
discoveries  recently. Finding the lyrics and music to &quot;The Two Magicians&quot;
and The Ballad of  Lucy Wan&quot;; hearing Edna O'Brien on the radio last week
(her Irish accented voice,  which JCB said they had originally wanted for the
reading of the poem in Jig of Life,  was exactly the same nearly-&quot;BBC&quot;-English-accent-with-just-a-trace-of-Irish-
 lilt-to-it that John used in the recording); the discovery of the original &quot;Auntie
 Hetty&quot; in an episode of The Avengers ; and now all this stuff about There
Goes a  Tenner. 
</P> 
<P>It's exciting, but it's also a bit worrying, because it implies that there's
a  similarly clear solution to all of the other countless mysteries to Kate's
work, which  we'll probably never know unless someone just happens to stumble on
them in the  same way.

</P>   
<P>&gt; Is IED sure? The 'cello part for HoL only has one stinken note in it!
Well, okay,  two notes (but the second is just an octave of the first). I can
hardly imagine Kate (or  anyone else for that matter) sitting down and writing
that out. Hell, even I picked it  up the first time I heard it. 
</P>   
<P>Yes, Kevin, that's what Kate said herself, anyway. As for the cello part
being all  of one note in octaves, that's misleading. Try really listening to
the two (separate)  cello parts, each playing in octaves, all the way through
the track, and you'll discover  that there are actually several melodic shifts;
in addition there's a crucial third cello  line (actually just one note) that
comes in with the words &quot;His little heart/It beats so  fast&quot;. 
</P> 
<P>Admittedly, the cello parts are quite simple, and that's probably why Kate
was  willing/able to write them out. Since, as you say, it sounds as though the
parts would  be very easy to pick up by ear, the fact that Kate did go to the
trouble of writing  them out is further evidence of the precision which she
expects from her players in  the translation of her original musical ideas. Here
are Kate's words on the subject: 
</P>   
<P>Question: You don't have staves with whole lines of music written out? 
</P> 
<P>&quot;Well, no, the only time I did that was for the cello parts in 'Hounds
of Love',  that's the only time I've ever written out a part, that's the only
time I've ever  written out a part. I stayed up all night to do it and wasn't
sure if I could. But I  worked them out on the Emulator and wrote out the chords
that I played in the  treble clef. Then the cellist Jonathan Williams--he's such
a great player and so into  the music he was-- helped me out by working it an
octave lower.&quot; 
</P>   
<P> The catch is, though, that Kate's method of &quot;writing&quot; is still
very unclear. In the  following excerpt from the Keyboard interview (this part
was excised from the  published version) Kate seems to indicate that she
actually does &quot;write out&quot; parts  more often than her above comment
would seem to imply; and that she uses the  Fairlight to help her actually
notate (in other words, she uses it not only to create and  record sounds, but
also to help with the actual notation process). 
</P>   
<P> &quot;The great thing, again, you can do with the Fairlight that I enjoy so
much is I  can write a piece on it, say, with an acoustic guitar or a cello, and
I can write it out,  and then I can get a musician in to actually play that. So
he's playing what I've  written, but he's doing it much better than I could do.
You see, without the Fairlight,  I probably couldn't have written these parts
before. 
</P> 
<P>I would have written them on the piano and they wouldn't have had the feel
of  the strings, or acoustic guitar. And at the same time, you know I don't
think me  playing them on the Fairlight is as good as these people. But it's an
interesting  blend.&quot;

endless dialogues (more  often monologues) about inconsequential musicians
(i.e., all musicians unconnected  with Kate's work). No matter how strong the
argument, he has found, Love-Hounds  will keep prattling on about &quot;Colourboxes&quot;
and &quot;XTCs&quot; and all the other flotsam and  jetsam of the pop-music

<BR> Subject: on the multitude of Her talents 
</P>
<P>On Her voice: 
</P> 
<P>I think the great thing about Kate's voice is not necessarily her range,
although  that's technically impressive. It's the way she uses it: her sense of
how to phrase,  what to do with a note, which way and how long to &quot;smear&quot;
the first or last note of a  phrase. Take &quot;The Man with the Child in his
Eyes&quot;, for example. Pat Benatar (ecch)  or even Suzanne Vega could not get
the emotional content out of that song that Kate  does. Consider specifically
the following (my punctuation): 
</P>
<P>&quot;Here I am again my girl, wond'rin' what on earth, <BR> I'm-a doin'-a
here; maybe, he doesn't love me; <BR> I just took a trip, on my love for him.&quot;

</P>
<P> Think of what she does with each note there. The only singers I can compare
 that to are Nat King Cole, and Barbra Streisand when she had some sense of
musical  style. 
</P> 
<P>But of course there's more to it than that, because that great sense of 
presentation is integrated into the writing of all her songs. When she wrote the
 melody to the line &quot;the man with the child in his eyes&quot;, she knew
exactly how she  was going to sing it. (Actually I suppose the two came
together.) Similarly with all of  &quot;The Flight (night? oops, I forget) of
the Swallow&quot;, or &quot;The Hounds of Love&quot;, for  example. 
</P>   
<P>On Her videos: 
</P> 
<P>What we must remember is that Kate was making videos back when they  weren't
even called videos, when it was kind of &quot;oh yeah, Kate Bush has recorded 
this kind of movie clip to go with her song&quot;. The videos for &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot;  and &quot;TMwtCihE&quot; are pretty embarrassing (to me, anyway),
but for instance those for  &quot;Breathing&quot; and &quot;Sat In your Lap&quot;
I think are excellent, and they were before the  video boom too. 
</P> 
<P>Of the post-video boom videos, I think &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is vaguely
farcical  (unfortunately, because it's my favourite Kate song). But &quot;HoL&quot;
and &quot;RUtH&quot; are  great, and I would almost say that she wrote &quot;The
Big Sky&quot; as a video song  specifically, it works so much better on video
than just the record itself. 
</P>   
<P>On Her emotional impact: 
</P> 
<P>I think the thing that ties together Kate's songs with things like, say (for
me)  Blade Runner, Lolita, or Ravel's music, is the sense of &quot;artistic
rapture&quot; in them (to  coin a phrase). It's art taken to a level where it
becomes a tangible sense of esthetic  bliss. When it doesn't work it comes off
as bad melodrama or bad psychedelia,  which is how some people view all of these
things anyway, but when it works it  really is rapturous.

</P>   
<P>I quite like Clannad and have a CD of theirs (Macalla) and a few tapes as
well.  They were in Australia a few months ago and some friends of mine went to
see  them. I breated them severely for not getting me a ticket, Apparantly, they
sound  every bit as clear and harmonious on stage as they do on their albums. 
</P> 
<P>I have quite an interest as well in Celtic and Gaelic legend and mythos. Its
 wonderful stuff. The fantasy fiction books that follow this line are amongst my
 favourites. As to the connection with KaTe, I'm not sure. Certainly her music
is very  deep minded and alive with subconcious imagery. I find that many myths
tend to  also be like that. Jung has a lot to say on the subject (not that I'm
necessarily a  Jungian). Basically KaTe's music can scare the shit out of me,
especially the Ninth  Wave. 
</P> 
<P>Although I couldn't say off hand if KaTe draws imagery directly from any 
particular mythos, it is entirely possible that these sorts of legends are the
sort of  thing tht she may have been bought up on on in her childhood. This
would probably  have an affect on her music.

<P>Ferruccio Busoni said: <BR> &quot;Every notation is, in itself, the
transcription of an abstract idea. <BR> The instant the pen seizes it, the idea
loses its original form.&quot; <BR> [ Sketch of a New Aesthetic of Music, c.
1907] 
</P>   
<P>So I can see where Kate would want to be able to transcribe directly the
ideas in  her head onto the recording medium. Varese had much the same attitude,
as shown  here: 
</P> 
<P>&quot;I find myself frustrated at every moment by the poverty of the means
of  expression at my disposal. I myself would like, for expressing my personal 
conceptions, a completely new means of expression. A sound machine (and not a 
machine for reproducing sounds). What I compose, whatever my message is, would 
then be transmitted to my listener without being altered by interpretation...&quot;

</P> 
<P>[Edgard Varese, c. 1933, in The Recording Angel, Evan Eisenberg, 1987] 
</P>   
<P>This &quot;sound machine&quot; that Varese desired is obviously the
forerunner to the  modern synthesiser. Eisenberg asserts that a musical
laboratory, also envisioned by  Varese, was fully available only in 1977 at
Pierre Boulez's IRCAM. However, Varese  was given an early Ampex tape machine in
the early fifties, and he began splicing  (by hand) the tape portions of his
piece Deserts, for winds, piano, percussion, and  tape. Eisenberg further
asserts that although Ussachevsky and Stockhausen had  been producing electronic
music experiments at this time... 
</P> 
<P>...Varese, by contrast, had been making electronic music in his head for
half a  century; the moment the tools were put in his hands he knew what to do
with them.  Deserts expresses all the emptiness of those fifty years of history
in a language  exploding with their fullness... Stockhausen's Gesang der
Junglinge of 1956 was  perhaps the first worthy successor of Deserts, and Morton
Subotnick's The Wild  Bull of 1971... perhaps the most popular... 
</P> 
<P>[ The Recording Angel ] 
</P>   
<P>I think that perhaps Kate wasn't the first composer to be able to put the
ideas in  her or his head directly onto tape. I would argue that Frank Zappa was
also doing  this before Kate, but Zappa also chose not to devote himself
entirely to this, as Kate  has -- Zappa wanted to be able to do the live show,
and thus chose to limit himself  with the capabilities of the live rock band.
Although he did take those recordings  and add many overdubs in the studio to
produce a different kind of musical  experience than the live, he was not
performing musical alchemy. 
</P> 
<P>My other concern is expressed fairly well by the Talking Heads' song &quot;Seen
and  Not Seen&quot;: 
</P> 
<P>He would see faces in movies, on T.V., in magazines, and in books... He
thought  that some of these faces might be right for him... And through the
years, by  keeping an ideal facial structure fixed in his mind... Or somewhere
in the back of  his mind... That he might, by force of will, cause his face to
approach those of his  ideal... 
</P> 
<P>He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people... 
</P> 
<P>ALthough some people might have made mistakes... They may have arrived at an
 appearance that bears no relationship to them... They may have picked an ideal 
appearance based on some childish whim or momentary impulse... Some may have 
gotten half-way there, and then changed their minds. 
</P> 
<P>He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: alchemy...
</P>   
<P> Again, IED wasn't making himself clear, judging by the nature of people's 
comments. He never meant to say (nor, in fact, did he say) either that Kate was
the  first to produce her own music or that she was the first to use the
Fairlight CMI!  Nor did he mean to say (or say) that Kate was performing &quot;alchemy&quot;
by the mere  use of synthesizers! Nor did he mean to say (or say) that Kate used
only synthesizers  (unlike much of Tangerine Dream's music, which was an example
one L-H gave). It  should go without saying that none of those propositions is
true. IED doesn't believe  that these misunder-standings would have arisen had
readers paid closer attention to  IED's words--but on the other hand IED will
admit that his words are not of a type  that inspires people to read them with
excessive care. They're more likely to make  people hit the 'scroll down' key
with a vengeance. So no offense is taken. 
</P> 
<P>About the comparison with Wagner. Yes, in some respects Kate's efforts are 
similar to Wagner's, though IED would never dream of trying to suggest that any 
kind of qualitative comparison between these two artists' work is warranted. The
 technical differences between the two musicians' methods are enormous, however.
 That's one reason why IED used the term &quot;modern musical history&quot; (by
which he  had post-WWII music vaguely in mind). Anyway, the likeness of Kate's
work to  Wagner's is more sensible when considering her overall performance
concepts of  her music--either the stage shows or the videos, and perhaps a few
of the television  lip-synch performances. IED isn't so sure that Wagner's
orchestration  techniques--the actual sonic &quot;fingerprints&quot; of his
music--are in themselves the result  of quite the same attitude that IED sees
behind Kate's creation of The Dreaming.  But again, it's all subjective, and all
a matter of degree. 
</P> 
<P>He also wants to reiterate that he was only stating a very personal view of
how  Kate fits into musical history. He realizes that it's relatively easy to
provide examples  of music which, at least by objective comparison, seem to have
preceded Kate's in  terms of the innovative approach which IED has ascribed to
Kate's work. Ah, but if  only you could all make such comparisons after
listening through IED's hopelessly  Kate-obsessed ears! There'd be no argument.

</P> 
<P>IED honestly didn't want to start a fight over this nebulous question as to
which  artist was first with this or that innovation, much less which artist is
&quot;better or  worse&quot;. That's been done in this group in the past, and
IED still smarts from the  tanning he got for sticking to his guns. Also, his
comments about musical alchemy  were not intended to stand as an intellectually
defensible argument. They were  merely impassioned expressions of IED's more or
less spiritual conviKTions. That's  why they were admittedly vulnerable to
rebuttal.

</P>   
<P>Reagarding all the ferver IED has created over his claims about Kate's
unique  alchemical approach... I think most people are completely
misinterpreting what he  said. IED never said that Kate was the first person to
use synthesizers, or the first  person to produce her own album, or anything
like that. I don't know if I've  correctly interpreted IED either, so I'll just
tell you my opinions about Kate's  unique innovation on *The Dreaming*, which I
think is quite related to what IED  had to say. 
</P> 
<P>Most often throughout the history of recorded music, production techniques
in  the studio have been used to add something to already existing music. Most
often this  studio production has been used to smooth and polish the music; to
remove rough  edges and turn the music into a glossy commercial product.
Sometimes it has been  used to add embelishments to the music. And sometimes the
studio has been used  itself as a primary artistic tool. In recent years, we
have seen music that could not  exist without the studio -- music, where the
studio production is so integral to the  music that if you removed the studio
production, there would not be enough left to  stand on its own. This is not a
bad thing -- in fact it is a quite good thing, because  it's a whole new art
form. Groups like Tackhead and M|A|R|S come to mind. 
</P> 
<P>The Beatles did some of the earliest interesting art using the studio. *Sgt.
 Peppers* was a showcase for the state of the art in studio production. And 
everything was done on 4-track tape recorders! The Beatles didn't take this 
approach to it's conclusion, however. They didn't have the technology to, nor 
probably the desire. Parts of *Sgt. Peppers* could not have existed without the
studio  production (some of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, for instance), but
for the most part, the  music could have existed in a form without the studio
embelishing and still have been  darn good and recognizable. On the White Album,
Revolution Number 9 is  completely a studio production and could not possibly
exist without the studio.  However, Revolution Number Nine can not really be
though of as a &quot;song&quot;. It is more  a collage of sounds. In the
seventies there were many avant-garde musicians who did  works that could only
be studio creation, but almost all of this is more apropriately  classified as
sound collages. Pink Floyd did a lot of interesting studio work that  greatly
enhanced their music. Listen to all of the sound effects and sounds on *The 
Wall* and try to imagine the album without these. I think it could be done -- it
 wouldn't be as good, but it would still be good. The same thing can be said
about  Peter Gabriel's third album. 
</P> 
<P>What about *The Dreaming*? Could *The Dreaming* exist in any recognizable 
form with the massive studio effort that was put into it? Without samplers, and 
overdubbing, and all the weird little sound effects, sound processing, and
sounds? I  don't think so. There are a couple of songs which might be
recognizable in an  unproduced form, played on more convential instruments, but
for the most part, the  &quot;instrument&quot; the songs were played on is the
studio. *The Dreaming* would not of,  could not of existed without the studio.
*The Dreaming* is the first album of music  (as opposed to sound collages) which
took studio production to the maximal artistic  extreme, and thus it deserves a
place in history just for this (not to mention for also  being the greatest
album ever recorded).

Subject: re Alchemy
</P>   
<P>Listen, I think that Kate is a wonderful artist and I bless her for not
being  restrained by the limited musical outlooks that too many modern pop
artists have  adopted. But, PLEASE, don't take this too far. Talking about who
did what first is  always a dubious undertaking. This process (or non-process)
of musical creation may  be a refreshing change in pop music of the eighties but
it is hardly something that  has been uncovered by Kate (or any single artist
for that matter). 
</P> 
<P>It is a fundamental practice of artists in many of the Eastern countries.
The fact  that principles of Zen, meditation and the like have slowly been
trickling in to the  West has become more evident as musicians like Kate, Steve
Reich and David Sylvian  get recognition and understanding. Even so, I would
contend that the only means of  &quot;Alchemy&quot;, as you term it, would be
through improvisation. This, of course, could be  argued (probably without any
decipherable outcome). While I'm way out here on a  limb, I would liken The
Dreaming to a Claude Debussy piece rather than to a John  Cage piece. That is,
like Debussy, Kate uses the studio sounds like a palette. Of  course, the studio
has certain limiting factors (to our minds), but Kate seems  unaware of them
(and thus they don't exist! (there is a nice explanation of this idea  in Zen in
the Art of Archery by Eugene Herrigel)). These are ideas that both  Debussy and
Cage explored. They did not see limitations in there work. That is a  feeling I
get with a few of Kate's records: the artist's total indifference to the ideas 
of limitation in their composition. 
</P> 
<P>This is something I am working towards in my own music and something that we
 all can aply to any aspect of our lives. So, LIVE CREATIVELY!!!!!

<P>P.S. If the tone of this article sounds a little negative, it is not meant
to be. I think  that having sheros is fine. I think keeping your feet on the
ground when talking  about them makes for better net reading. On the other hand,
when listening to  her...

<P>Date: Sat, 13 May 89 12:13 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: production
</P>   
<P>Thanks to |&gt;oug for his hearty defense of IED's observations about The 
Dreaming. IED agreed with virtually every word |&gt;oug had to say on the
subject.  |&gt;oug and IED seem, oddly enough, to be of one mind on most aspects
of this  particular issue. 
</P> 
<P>IED questions only one point of |&gt;oug's--the idea that even one or two of
the  songs on TD could stand on their own &quot;without the production&quot;.
IED doesn't know  how such a thing could possibly be proved, unless Kate herself
were to strip away  the production and make recordings of the simple &quot;songs&quot;
themselves. I really  believe now that even the tracks that seem to have been &quot;built
up&quot; around &quot;songs&quot; (  Suspended in Gaffa, There Goes a Tenner,
etc.) are nevertheless inextricably mixed  up with their production. For
example, one could certainly recognize the song Leave  It Open if Frank Sinatra,
Jr. sang it on Late Night with Paul Shaffer on electric  piano. There's enough
of a &quot;song&quot; for that to be possible. But without the extremely 
elaborate and varied treatment of the different parts of the vocal (to say
nothing of  the multiple effects in the instrumental parts), would it really be
the same song ?  IED thinks it would be like listening to Tristan und Isolde (to
use Julian's analogy)  with just a single bel canto soprano and a piano
accompaniment. In other words,  identifiable but hopelessly incomplete, and
totally at odds with the intentions of the  music's creator. 
</P> 
<P>IED never thought he would be coming to the defense of &quot;Phil Collins&quot;
in this  forum, but |&gt;oug's opinions should not be taken as representing all
Love-Hounds'.  IED agrees that Collins seems very often to be actively courting
popular favour, and  that much of his music seems to be designed for commercial
success, rather than  through what IED believes Kandinsky liked to call &quot;inner
necessity&quot;. But that is not  always a totally damning motivation for the
creation of art. On that point IED  definitely does not agree with |&gt;oug. It
seems to IED that the reasons for someone's  creativity--whether &quot;purely&quot;
aesthetic; related to questions of morality; or merely  commercial--are quite
irrelevant to the end result. All that matters to IED--or all  that should
matter to him--is the music itself. 
</P> 
<P>There is much to admire in Phil Collins's work, although IED personally
never  listens to it, and would never spend any money on it. And God knows
Collins has  made a lot of music that is far superior to some of the high-minded
crap lauded in  L-Hs in the past. (IED won't be specific because he's a coward
and doesn't want to  bring everyone in the group down on his head.) IED's point
is that sure, commercial  motivations can be terribly damaging to a person's
art. But anti-commercial  motivations can be equally damaging. So can any other
motivating factor that isn't  directly related to the making of the music. But
it's also possible that these factors  can have no effect, or at least have no
ill effect on the art, too. That's because there  are just too many other
possible conditions that could affect the creative process--not  the least of
which is talent --something which Collins unquestionably has in  considerable
degree. 
</P> 
<P>(Anyway remember, Kate once raved about In the Air Tonight. And that's 
enough reason for IED, as all of you know.) 
</P> 
<P>The other thing about |&gt;oug's criticism of Collins that IED didn't agree
with was  his statement that because &quot;the other half of his music is
completely derivative,&quot; it's  &quot;of no interest&quot;. IED thinks that's
a very dangerous kind of generalization to make.  It's impossible to be &quot;completely&quot;
derivative. No artist in history has ever been  &quot;completely&quot;
derivative. Collins's work is sometimes quite derivative of earlier  musical
styles by other artists, and it is quite often very derivative of his own
earlier  recordings. But that in itself is not a damning quality. It's possible
to identify  virtually any artist in history as &quot;derivative&quot;. But the
degree to which a given artist is  &quot;derivative&quot; is not proportionate
to the &quot;interest&quot; level of that artist's work. One  could easily argue
that Mozart (jeez, this kind of analogy always makes IED  cringe--sorry,
people!) was extremely derivative of Johann Christian Bach; and that  he
repeated himself endlessly, as well. 
</P> 
<P>One could also condemn much of Mozart's work for having been motivated by 
purely economic and/or extra-musical social conditions in his life. (Even the
keys in  which many of his works were written were chosen by Mozart because they
were  the &quot;official&quot; Court Keys for a given year!) But these
criticisms still wouldn't in any  way touch on the ultimately indefinable
aspects of Mozart's work which have made  them so curiously moving to so many
people over such a long period of time.  Without meaning in any way to compare
Collins's work to Mozart's (God forbid!),  IED fails to see how the fact (if it
is a fact) that Collins's work is often motivated by  the wish to succeed with
the public and in the marketplace should in and of itself  condemn the music
which results from those motivations. Nor can IED see how the  fact that
Collins's work is closely derived from other music should in itself mean  that
his music is &quot;of no interest&quot;.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: IED wrestles with
Love-Hounds' Big Issues 
</P>   
<P> &gt;A similar question: if I have mastered only one style but you have
mastered  many, haven't you accomplished more than me? These questions lead to
possible  criteria for judging musical greatness, like: 
</P> 
<P>o mastery of various styles <BR> o making one's work accessible <BR> o
invention of a new but personal style <BR> o invention of a new and
widely-adopted style <BR>
</P>
<P> -- Glenn Bruns 
</P>   
<P> All these little formulae look sound enough, but they leave out a mass of 
variables, Glenn. First, how do you define &quot;mastery&quot;? Second, how does
the number  of accomplishments in itself have anything to do with the quality of
those  accomplishments? Chopin was a &quot;master&quot; of composition for the
piano. Beethoven  wrote &quot;masterly&quot; piano music as well as orchestral
music. But does that have  anything to do with the accomplishments of Chopin?
No. Does it make Chopin an  inferior atist? Of course not. Such comparisons are
pointless. Wagner was the first  master of the Gesamtkunstwerk--incorporating a
number of different media all at  once to make a new, &quot;comprehensive&quot;
artwork. But does that in itself make Wagner  the &quot;greatest&quot; artist in
history up till then? Of course not! What he did was unique,  and not something
that we can rank by totting up the number of inventions in it.  And what makes
Wagner's music great is its ability to move people. It's not its  innovations
alone that give Wagner's work &quot;greatness&quot;; rather, it's its evocative 
power that gives his innovations a reason for being. 
</P> 
<P>Conversely, the &quot;ability&quot; to make one's art &quot;accessible&quot;
to a larger audience is not  something to be considered a virtue in itself. If
one artist makes powerful music, but  it's not popular, he isn't less good an
artist than another who makes powerful music  that is popular. It just means
their arts are different. In other words, these  criteria--number of techniques
mastered by the artist, number of people attracted to  the work, number of
innovations in the art, etc.--are all far too vague and subject to  other more
work- and artist-specific criteria to be of much use in comparisons. 
</P> 
<P>A far more sensible means of gauging artists' &quot;greatness&quot; would be
to begin with  Kate Bush's work as the ideal, and to measure all other art in
terms of the degree  to which it approaches that ideal. That way, no art could
be mistakenly identified as  equal or superior to Kate's. As a result, the
differences in quality between all other  artists' work would rightly be
recognized as an entirely trivial and irrelevant matter,  since no matter how &quot;good&quot;
they might be, they could never be as good as Kate's!

<BR> Subject: Playing a Role 
</P>   
<P>To change the subject again, I have noticed (especially in the very early
works of  Kate that IED recently transcribed), a very unusual point of view that
seems to show  itself in the majority of Kate's works. It's so unique that I
can't quite think of the  right word for it, but the closest that I can come is
&quot;victim.&quot; 
</P> 
<P>Not to mean that Kate's persona in her songs are asking for pity or
anything, but  there seems to be a genuine feeling of &quot;There's nothing I
can do about this. I'll just  ride it out (sit back and look at the Big Sky.)&quot;
Maybe the word is powerlessness. 
</P> 
<P>This is apparent in many of her songs dealing with relationships: she would
run  up that hill *if* she could -- the actor can't save himself in Wow -- Mrs.
Houdini  stands powerless, watching the magician die --the girl has no ability
to choose  what's happening and who she picks in Canasta. 
</P> 
<P>At the same time, there is no real feeling of anger in much of her songs.
Revenge  is only on her mind in The Wedding List. Anger is displayed in GOOMH
and, to a  smaller degree in Hounds of Love, but there is also a strong sense of
running and  hiding in both songs. 
</P> 
<P>In her non-relationship songs, there is a similar feeling of helplessness --
the  fetus in Breathing, the child in Cloudbusting, the stalked in Hammer
Horror. 
</P> 
<P>Anyway, I have just been listening to a long stretch of Kate's works, and
this  thought came to me. I know Kate is pretty infamous for her lack of anger,
and it  really seems to come through in her material. I find it just adds to the
genius of Kate  that she can make songs about kinds of powerlessness so strong.

</P> 
<P>Thought I'd pass my thoughts on for comments...

<P>Date: Tue, 04 Jul 89 12:16 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Kate's point of view 
</P>   
<P> On quite a different subject, Doug MacGowan has made some very compelling 
and provocative new points about Kate's themes: 
</P>   
<P> &gt; To change the subject again, I have noticed (especially in the very
early works  of Kate that IED recently transcribed), a very unusual point of
view that seems to  show itself in the majority of Kate's works. It's so unique
that I can't quite think of  the right word for it, but the closest that I can
come is &quot;victim.&quot; Maybe the word is  powerlessness. 
</P> 
<P>This is apparent in many of her songs dealing with relationships: she would
run  up that hill *if* she could; the actor can't save himself in Wow ; Mrs.
Houdini stands  powerless, watching the magician die; the girl has no ability to
choose what's  happening and who she picks in Canasta. 
</P>   
<P> This is a very interesting thesis, and IED cannot deny that Doug gives
strong  examples to support it. It's a mystery, since Kate does not, in fact,
believe that  people are, strictly speaking, &quot;victims&quot; of fate, or
helpless beings. Her philosophy, if  it can be called that, is that we can
affect our fate through our attitude. But she  doesn't mean by this that there
is any supernatural force at work. She has made it  clear in interviews that
what she means is that if we are able to view our  environment in a positive
light--if we can succeed in transforming our &quot;negative  energies&quot;, or
attitudes, into positive ones, through the exercise of our will --then that 
very positive attitude will have an effect on our environment, hence on our
personal  destiny. 
</P> 
<P>She has been quick to stress that if such an attitude can be maintained,
then even  if tragedy should befall us, we will be better able to deal with that
tragedy, and thus  our fate will be more hopeful. 
</P> 
<P>Therefore, it's very interesting that Doug notices a theme of hopelessness 
running through Kate's work. Kate has said at least twice that she always wants
to  include at least some note of hope in her work. But IED believes she was
referring  more to her albums in a general sense, rather than to each individual
song. Also, she  insists that The Ninth Wave ends on a note of hope for the
future (the heroine does  NOT die at any time in that work, and that's FINAL,
Joe!). This attitude is not  always readily apparent in the songs, and Doug
MacGowan makes a very valid point,  IED thinks. It's a puzzle, but IED would
just like to remind everyone that Kate is  not writing autobiographically in
these songs. 
</P> 
<P>When she assumes the pessimistic, forlorn attitude of the fetus in
Breathing, or  the even more pathetic aspect of the mother in Army Dreamers, she
is not trying to  express her own personal attitude or opinion. In this respect
Kate Bush is quite  different from 99.9% of the artists writing songs today.
Kate tends to take on the  personalities and to share the attitudes and opinions
of the characters who narrate  the various songs she composes. She does not (for
the most part) mean to endorse  those characters' attitudes and opinions,
although she might happen to agree with  some of them. Rather, she simply
responds to those characters' situations as she  believes they would respond:
her capacity for empathy seems to be one of her  greatest gifts and
inspirations. 
</P> 
<P>Given this fact, it's not necessarily a contradiction of her own philosophy
that a  certain number of her songs seem to explore the theme of helplessness or
 hopelessness. Such emotions are of great concern to her, and it's almost
inevitable  that she should be moved to try to express them in her music. IED
believes,  however, that her ultimate and overriding message is a positive one.

<BR> Subject: More Powerlessness 
</P>   
<P>IED sez: 
</P> 
<P>&gt;Therefore, it's very interesting that Doug notices a theme of
hopelessness  running through Kate's work. 
</P>   
<P>I don't have my posting in front of me, but I'm pretty sure I used the word 
&quot;powerlessness&quot; -- which is quite different from *hopelessness*. I
agree that Kate's  work is full of hope and good beliefs, and that she has the
attitude that we can make  changes to the beds that we lie in. 
</P>   
<P>&gt;she insists that The Ninth Wave ends on a note of hope for the future 
</P>   
<P>Interesting you should point this one out, IED. After thinking about the
theory I  presented in my last posting, I have come to the conclusion that this
aspect of  helplessness or powerlessness is most apparent in The Ninth Wave, the
song Hello  Earth particularly: 
</P> 
<P>Can't do anything - just watch them swing on the wind out to sea 
</P> 
<P>And the passages where all the possible rescuers (sailors, fishermen,
life-savers,  etc.,) are told to head for home. 
</P> 
<P>The more I think about it, the more I see this trait in her songs. Even a
song  about transitionary action, such as Full House, has the character making a
change,  but only after Pride and The Voices force her into it. 
</P> 
<P>I cannot think of any of Kate's songs where the perspective is that of a
person  who is not acting on some kind of interior or exterior source that leads
them into  action: Under The Ivy has the &quot;little girl inside me&quot;, Ran
Tan Waltz's main character  is a very weak man, Cloudbusting is full of other
sources, and Ne T'en Fuis Pas  (which I still maintain is the *best* song Kate
ever did) has &quot;the large eyes of my  God.&quot; 
</P>   
<P>&gt;she is not trying to express her own personal attitude or opinion. She
does not  (for the most part) mean to endorse those characters' attitudes and
opinions,  although she might happen to agree with some of them. 
</P>   
<P>I'm going to have to ask you to expound on this one. Maybe I am 
misunderstanding what you're saying, but I would maintain that she identifies in
 some way with most, if not all, of the attitudes and opinions of her
characters. This  does not imply that she has experienced everything that her
characters have (so I  agree the songs are not autobiographical), but I believe
that her character's actions  must portray some aspect of her personality. I've
read that she gets some of her  ideas from TV or things she's read; and while
she has not experienced events like in  King's The Shining or World War III, she
can imagine if-that-were-me-  I'd-feel-like-this, and write songs like Get Out
Of My House and Breathing, putting  herself into those imaginary situations. The
very fact that there is so little  resemblance between GOoMH and The Shining
(thank god) is because Kate took  that material and put aspects of *herself*
into it. 
</P>   
<P>&gt;IED believes, however, that her ultimate and overriding message is a
positive one. 
</P>   
<P>Abso-blooming-lutely, to quote the Griffin in &quot;Dreamchild.&quot; But
not, however,  your run-of-the-mill kind of positiveness.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: English allusions in Kate
Bush 
</P>   
<P>OK, so what is the special British significance of purple flowers? Also, IED
 meant to ask this of the Love-Hound who indicated he/she knew of a special 
meaning to the &quot;ravens&quot; in Lionheart a couple of years ago in
Love-Hounds. If  someone can explain this reference, IED would appreciate it.
(He feels appropriately  ignorant and foolish having to ask about these.) 
</P> 
<P>Incidentally, IED believes there is more than just a general passing
reference to  Spring in the following lines from Lionheart : &quot;Just give me
one kiss in apple  blossom/Just give me one kiss and I'll be wassailing/In the
orchard, my English  rose/Or with my shepherd, who'll bring me home.&quot; 
</P> 
<P>Knowing that Kate is quite intimately acquainted with the early
Pre-Raphaelites'  paintings, IED believes the above verses are certainly a
reference to one picture,  possibly two. The certain (or nearly certain)
reference is to John Everett Millais's  Apple Blossoms, also known as Spring
(1859). It depicts a group of young girls and  ladies sitting or standing in a
rough semi-circle on a softly sunlit day, in a meadow  near an orchard of
apple-trees in blossom. Some of the girls are drinking some sort  of drink or
porridge. The painting is one of the most famous and important of  Millais's
Pre-Raphaelite works. Knowing that Kate's lyrics for Lionheart were  designed to
be a kind of panorama of distinctively, recognizably English images, it  seems
extremely likely that the apple-blossom verse is meant to allude to Millais's 
painting. (Kate has specifically singled out two of Millais's other early, 
Pre-Raphaelite pictures in interviews: his Ophelia and his A Huguenot, both from
 about 1852.) 
</P> 
<P>The other possible (but not certain) reference is to another famous 
Pre-Raphaelite picture of English life, William Holman Hunt's The Hireling 
Shepherd, which shows a ruddy-faced British shepherd stretched out on a field, 
sweet-talking a young country maid (who is feeding an apple to a little lamb),
while  behind them the shepherd's flock of sheep, unattended, stray dangerously
out of  their proper meadow. The shepherd has a small cask of beer round his
waist. Hence  IED's suggestion that the verses above may also refer to this
picture.

a person  who is not acting on some kind of interior or exterior source that
leads them into  action... 
</P>   
<P>IED must applaud you, Doug, for introducing a really intriguing new way of 
considering Kate's work. You have provided a large number of examples to support
 your thesis, too, and IED agrees that there are many songs which seem to stem 
from, if not &quot;hopelessness&quot;, than at least a kind of fatalism, or a
sense of resignation  about the inevitability of fate. One could, however, argue
that every action is merely  a re-action to another, previous action; so we
should be careful not to lump all of  Kate's songs of action into this &quot;reactive&quot;,
or &quot;power-less&quot; category, if only because it  becomes too general a
criterion. 
</P> 
<P>IED can think of several songs, off hand, which seem to celebrate a kind of
power  ful, affirmative action and attitude on the part of the narrator. What
about Pull Out  the Pin ? There we see a Viet Cong guerilla soldier taking
drastic (and highly  efficient!) action in what he sees as a perfectly justified
act (even though his attitude  is not entirely unmixed). And in There Goes a
Tenner the group of protagonists,  although perhaps (only perhaps, :&gt;oug!)
not ultimately successful, nevertheless have  taken upon themselves an
extraordinary new step in their &quot;careers&quot;, so to speak.  These are not
exactly heroes, but they are also not powerless victims of fate. They  have
taken a position and they will stick to it till the end. 
</P> 
<P>Moving, about Lindsay Kemp (or about a young girl in the audience at one of 
Kemp's shows, perhaps), is another highly affirmative song, one which seems to
defy  the fatalism of many of Kate's other early texts. And the words of Them
Heavy  People very clearly advocate that we can change our situation in life and
the universe  through the acquisition of knowledge. Room For the Life is another
call (this time  directed at the passive, fatalistic woman whom the narrator
addresses) to take a  positive direction, to survive difficulties and overcome
them, to embrace life rather  than shy away from it. James and the Cold Gun does
much the same thing, only this  time in reference to a man. In both these songs
the subject is being urged by the  speaker to change course toward a more
life-affirming philosophy. Both songs seem  (to IED, anyway) to be arguing
against a negative or fatalistic attitude. 
</P> 
<P>There are several other songs with similarly optimistic, determinist
messages:  L'Amour Looks Something Like You ; Leave It Open (perhaps); the man's
position  (told through the choruses and bridge) in Night of the Swallow ; The
Big Sky ; Jig of  Life (a song which fairly reeks life-affirmative, determinist
philosophy!); and The  Morning Fog. All of these songs, in IED's view, seem in
one way or another to carry  strong anti-fatalist, anti-powerlessness messages.

</P> 
<P>This is not to deny your own point, which is amply documented. IED is even 
ready to concede that the songs which convey a feeling of pessimism or 
powerlessness exceed in number those which suggest a more determinist attitude. 
But this all really goes to the more central characteristic of Kate's work: its 
empathic, rather than autobiographical, nature. 
</P> 
<P>IED doesn't want to try to argue that none of Kate's songs bears any
relation to  her personal life. That would be ridiculous. Clearly many of her
songs, particularly in  the early work, bear the mark of the confessional
songwriter. And some songs are  so vague--or at least their specific narrative
referents are so obscure to the public so  far--that, in the absence of more
concrete information, they appear to us to be  self-referential ( Under the Ivy,
for example, or Burning Bridge, perhaps). But in  general, Kate's source of
inspiration for her songwriting seems to come from  outside herself. She is
captivated by other people's situations, ideas, feelings and  predicaments. She
seems perpetually to be delighting in, even revelling in, her own  capacity to
empathize with the mind and soul of another human being. 
</P> 
<P>She gets inside her subject, and assumes his/her world and viewpoint long 
enough to write and record a song. For the most part this vast, almost limitless
 capacity to empathize with the experience of people other than herself is
absent in  other contemporary songwriters. And it's this capacity which is at
the core of  Kate's ability to crystalize human emotions that are at once
universal and complex  --something which virtually no-one else working today can
do, certainly not to the  degree that Kate can. 
</P>   
<P>&gt; I'm going to have to ask you to expound on this one. Maybe I am 
misunderstanding what you're saying, but I would maintain that she identifies in
 some way with most, if not all, of the attitudes and opinions of her
characters. 
</P>   
<P> Well, this is just the point IED is wrestling with. There is a world of
difference  between empathy and sympathy. When you say that Kate &quot;identifies&quot;
with the  attitudes and opinions of her songs' characters, IED must agree, with
some  hesitation. But he would argue that Kate &quot;identifies&quot; with those
attitudes only long  enough to communicate the power of the characters'
feelings. There is no reason  for us to assume that Kate shares those
characters' attitudes herself, when she is not  performing those songs. On the
contrary, she herself has explained many times that  she becomes the character
only when she is performing (or, of course composing)  that character's song;
she does not &quot;carry it home&quot; with her at night. And she often  uses
language very carefully so as to avoid sounding as though she has taken a 
definite moral or intellectual position in regard to an issue raised in a song.

</P> 
<P>Her remarks about Cloudbusting, Mother Stands For Comfort and Experiment 
IV, for example, are amazingly neutral and detached. She is always very careful 
never to say, for instance, that she &quot;believes&quot; in the theories of
Wilhelm Reich, or  even in the cloudbuster itself. Nor will she ever say that
she feels the mother in  Mother Stands for Comfort is &quot;justified&quot; in
protecting her murderous son from  harm. And she is even careful to describe the
policy of the government types in  Experiment IV as &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;fascinating&quot;,
rather than &quot;horrid&quot; or &quot;rotten&quot; or  something like that.
This is what IED means by &quot;empathy&quot;: Kate &quot;puts on the skin&quot;
 of her subjects. But this means that the song represents the thoughts and
feelings of  her subjects, and not necessarily of herself. 
</P> 
<P>Now naturally there are some exceptions, and they are very obvious ones to
spot:  the plight of the Aborigines in The Dreaming, of the fetus in Breathing,
etc. We all  know that Kate has definite views about these songs' themes. But
these are  exceptional songs for that reason; they are not typical of her work.

</P>   
<P>&gt;can imagine if-that-were-me-I'd-feel-like-this, and write songs like Get
Out Of  My House and Breathing, putting herself into those imaginary
situations... 
</P>   
<P> IED agrees with you completely here. It seems we have simply had a
confusion  of terminology. Kate does &quot;put herself into those imaginary
situations,&quot; exactly. This  is what IED means by &quot;empathy&quot;. But
that's quite different from saying that, just  because she can imagine what her
characters are feeling and thinking, she  herself--even when not performing
those songs--feels and thinks the same way that  her characters do. It's
precisely because she does not (necessarily) share her  characters' views that
she can write songs which present such a wide variety and  range of
attitudes--including ones which seem to be in direct contradiction with one 
another, as in the case of the group of songs which explore themes of  &quot;powerlessness&quot;
and those which seem to present &quot;determinist&quot; attitudes.
