      <BR> From: nessus (Doug Alan)
      <BR> Subject: A message from Kate (Tourprogramm 1979) </P>
    
    <P>This is the introduction by Kate which appears in the tour program for
      her 1979 concert tour: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Remembering the streets of a rush-hour London, with my carrier
      bags and dancing clothes under my arm -- Mad people, mad things and me, a
      hoping heart with no idea what was going to happen just around the corner.
    </P>
    
    <P>Then the adventure of the gigs in English pubs, scented of summer beer.
      Wondering -- dancing -- sweating and waiting, waiting, waiting. </P>
    
    <P>My obsessions, my teachers, my aching bones, my comforts and
      frustrations. So much laughing and crying but always music, music
      everywhere. </P>
    
    <P>And now, crashing out in traffic jams all over the world, longing for
      home but waking with that same strange feeling --whether from a plane, a
      bed or a dream &quot;how come -- it's happening to me?&quot; -- and it's
      only just begun. -- You're carrying me into a land of the stage, a place
      for swallows and trapped mice. </P>
    
    <P>Since the time I saw magic made by loving bodies that moved me beyond
      words -- I've craved for my own troupe of gypsies, my own show, the chance
      to take a trip with you. </P>
    
    <P>And now it's here -- the best and bad times rock 'n rolled into one. The
      fear and sparkle in my stomach. </P>
    
    <P>Sure, it's for me -- but it's for you, too </P>
    
    <P>-- So take it -- take *me* away with you....... </P>
    
    <P>lots of love </P>
    
    <P>Kate </P>
    
    <P> xxxx </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: Kate recommends books to read, ca. 1979 </P>
    
    <P> &lt;Reproduced from the fourth issue of the Kate Bush Club Newsletter,
      which came out in late 1979. It's important to bear in mind that at this
      stage the Club was directed mainly toward very young fans--it took a while
      before Kate and her group realized how many older fans there were,
      apparently. Nevertheless, these books, which are all children's books,
      must be at least somewhat representative of the kind of books Kate herself
      enjoyed at that time.&gt; </P>
    
    <P> Books to Read </P>
    
    <P> I thought it would be a good idea to recommend some of the books I've
      enjoyed recently. They would be nice to give and to receive as Christmas
      presents. </P>
    
    <P> The Snowman, but Raymond Briggs (Hamish Hamilton). A lovely story, told
      entirely in pictures, of a boy's adventures with a snowman who comes to
      life one night. Beautifully drawn, funny and moving. A real delight. </P>
    
    <P> Masquerade, by Kit Williams (Cape). The riddle book to end all riddle
      books. If you can unravel the clues they will lead you to a golden hare
      that is buried somewhere in Britain. Super illustrations. </P>
    
    <P> The Stone Book, Tom Fobble's Day, The Aimer Gate and Granny Reardun,
      all by Alan Garner (Collins). A linked quartet by one of the finest living
      prose writers, though each book is an entity in itself, covering eighty
      years, from 1860 to 1940, in the life of a Cheshire family. Each book is
      only eighty pages long, and a fuller, richer, more exhilarating eighty
      pages would be hard to find. Each story is filled with the mysteries and
      magic of working with stone, wood and metal, and each has a stunning
      set-piece that left me literally breathless--a girl's whilrling ride on a
      church weathercock, a boy's climb to the inner tip of a steeple, the
      thrill of sledging in new snow in an air-raid. They are also well made
      books, with fine etchings by Michael Foreman--a delight to hold as well as
      to read. </P>
    
    <P> The Haunted House by Jan Pienkowski (Heinemann). Open every page and
      horrific things jump out at you, and there are lots of tabs to pull and
      push and turn to make it more ghoulish. Really good fun. </P>
    
    <P> The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, illustrated by Arthur
      Rackham (Methuen). Everyone will know about this classic, but I would like
      to recommend this edition, because it's a good size--it feels like a
      book--and has the superb Rackham illustrations. It's worth having for
      those alone. </P>
    
    <P> Moshi the Jackal, by Tas Gibson (Rex Collings). The life of the Jackal,
      told through the story of Moshi, brilliantly illustrated by one of the
      leading wildlife illustrators. Tas also had a hand in the design of our
      Lionheart logo. </P>
    
    <P> The Mouse and His Child, by Russell Hoban (Faber). A brilliant, funny
      and profound novel following the attempts of a father-and-son clockwork
      toy to achieve self-winding, in the face of attacks by Manny Rat, one of
      the great villains. </P>
    
    <P>-- Kate Bush </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU
      <BR> Subject: Auntie Hetty interview </P>
    
    <P>And now, since it seems IED forgot to post this after having finished
      typing it up, here is Kate's self(?)-interview, the one which preceded the
      &quot;Zwort Finkle&quot; interview. This one's called &quot;Auntie Hetty&quot;.
      Enjoy.</P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush interviews herself: The &quot;Auntie Hetty&quot; Interview
    </P>
    
    <P>&lt;Kate apparently interviewed herself for two of the latest issues of
      The Kate Bush Club Newsletter, attributing the questions to the fictitious
      characters Auntie Hetty and Cousin Zwort Finkle. </P>
    
    <P>The &quot;Auntie Hetty&quot; interview first appeared in the 20th issue
      of the Newsletter; the second followed it in the 21st issue. Edited by
      Andrew Marvick.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>An Interview With Auntie Hetty </P>
    
    <P> Let me introduce myself. I'm Kate's Auntie Hetty, and I've been waiting
      to do this interview for years, but she's such a busy dear, and I like to
      keep myself active with my amateur dramatics. Such a lovely group of boys
      and girls -- so enthusiastic --keeps them away from nasty things like
      sniffing glue and listening to Sigue-Sigue Sputnik. I'm terribly into
      Method acting and have just had a nice long sleep. I was playing a woman
      alcoholic who'd been up for three days and three nights, so I stayed up
      for three days and three nights and drank both bottles of sherry (from
      that lovely boy who played Bottom three years ago in Little Hampton). It's
      so much more fun than acting. But I feel most refreshed now, and as I
      enter Katie's front gate I notice the garden's a little untidy --I really
      must tell her about old Mr. Squashy, and I've some lovely hollyhocks she
      could put by the door. </P>
    
    <P>So, with a nice cup of tea, I refer to my notes, take up the old crochet
      hook and begin: </P>
    
    <P> Now Katie, dear, we're all so pleased about this album doing so well
      and we heard a lot about a film called &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; --Will
      that be your next project? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;The film was something I very much wanted to try. The b-side of
      the album was originally written with visual ideas in mind, and I am
      intrigued by the combination of pictures and sound on film. I went as far
      as approaching a couple of people about the idea, but I found the success
      of the album and the rate of single releases extremely demanding,
      especially as each single required a video, 12&quot;, single artwork...It
      soon built up, and there was no time to even think about this film. The
      promotion for this album almost lasted a year. By the time I'd taken a
      break, the gap between albums was already becoming too big to consider
      fitting in another project. I've now had a holiday and some time to do
      nothing, and am in the process of thinking out some ideas to take into the
      studio.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Oh, I see, dear. Well, you must have been very busy. Did you have a
      lovely holiday? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Yes, it was...lovely.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Now, you have a video E.P. out called The Hair of the Hound, and it's
      been at Number One in the charts, which is very nice, lovely. They must
      have taken a lot of time to do. You see, I understand these things --
      Amateur dramatics is the same thing, you know: rehearse, rehearse,
      struggle, toil, iron your costume every night... </P>
    
    <P> &quot;I really wanted to try and make videos that looked like short
      films this time. I think I've always wanted to do this, but apart from one
      or two of the previous videos I have not achieved it. I started
      approaching film directors. I believed that video and film were two very
      different worlds, and that people who made videos would be less likely to
      make a pop &quot;video&quot; look like a piece of 35mm film. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;All the people I approached were very kind but very busy, and I
      began to realise that unless I was extremely lucky, no one that I wanted
      would be able to shoot the promo. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I am a big admirer of Terry Gilliam's work -- he is a great
      director. I asked his advice; could he suggest people I could work with
      who were good. He recommended David Garfarth, who had worked as a
      cameraman for him. The lighting cameraman was Phil Mayheux --who,
      interestingly, worked on the Max Headroom special, which was superbly lit
      -- &quot; </P>
    
    <P> Max who? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;The video &lt;&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;&gt; took eight
      weeks: six weeks' training and choreography working with Dyane Gray, and
      three days shoot, plus editing and various meetings. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;'Cloudbusting' took eight to ten weeks, working with Julian Doyle,
      who has worked many times with Terry Gilliam. He is multi-talented, and
      covered many areas of the shoot, with Brian Helighy lighting for the first
      time -- it's hard to believe that it is his first time at lighting.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Yes it is so atmospheric, I love the story. But I'm very upset that you
      didn't bring that lovely Donald Sutherland to see me. You know your Uncle
      Bertie used to get quite jealous...eh, hmm, yes. Now I noticed you didn't
      move your lips to the music in three of the videos -- or should I call
      them films? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Well, they were all shot on film, but all eventually were edited
      on video. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Apart from 'Running Up That Hill', which was edited totally in the
      video suite, the others were edited on film as much as possible: doing all
      the cuts -- except the ones that need special effects: slowing down,
      speeding up. All this is much quicker (and sometimes cheaper) to do on
      video, and with promo deadlines video is so convenient. But it does change
      the quality of the pictures when the film is transferred to video: it
      somehow loses its depth. But I'm sure in a couple of years the quality
      will be brilliant. Video is advancing all the time, but for me you can't
      beat the original quality of film, it's a very ancient form. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The advantage of video is being set loose on all the effects,
      although on the E.P. all except 'Big Sky' have been approached from a
      purist film-maker's point of view: very few special effects. We
      deliberately encouraged this, again trying to emphasise the film aspect.
      Which has a lot to do with no lip-synch: as soon as a performer is
      'singing', they become that performer doing other things while singing.
      Which is great live, but on film, people acting out events without the lip
      distractions have more chance of playing a character. I found it very
      interesting and much more enjoyable. I'm always concerned about the miming
      being as accurate as possible, and that takes a lot of concentration and
      makes me behave like a singer. So without the lip-synch I could put much
      more effort into a character. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I felt a little nervous about it in 'Cloudbusting'. In 'Running Up
      That Hill' it was different: no lip-synch, but I was trying to act a
      dancer, and they are facial expressions I know the sensations of. But
      playing a little boy, and playing opposite Donald Sutherland, I began to
      wonder if I was going mad, voluntarily putting myself in these situations
      where I had a ninety percent chance of looking a total absolute idiot! But
      if anything, Donald made it seem extremely natural, he was just like my
      Dad. He could make it rain, and I would watch him being taken away. I must
      say it was an extremely moving experience, burnt strongly into my memory
      upon the hill with the machine and the wind... </P>
    
    <P> I had a similar experience with Sir Cecil Dill in the last performance
      of Ooh, Was it Really? at Dulwich. He was playing Mortimer West, and as he
      rushed on the stage with his epee in his back and said, &quot;Good God! It
      was him all along!&quot; I knew I would never forget that moment, and with
      tears in my eyes I said, &quot;Ooh, was it really?&quot; and down came the
      curtain to the roar of applause, with that smell of old velvet -- Still
      brings a tear to my eye. </P>
    
    <P>Now, where was I? Oh, my dear, you've made more tea. I didn't see you
      go! </P>
    
    <P>I notice that you directed two of the videos. Did you enjoy doing that?
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It was very interesting and extremely educational. I've had a lot
      of encouragement from people to get more involved, and it can be difficult
      sometimes to find directors who are enthusiastic about the amount of
      involvement I like to put in. I found it took all my time rather than
      most, and the actual shoots felt very relaxed. Cupcake, Aunt Hetty?&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Ooh, don't mind if I do, dear. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I am extremely lucky to have worked with such a good film crew:
      Mike Roberts was the cameraman. He's worked on The Killing Fields and The
      Mission; and Billy Camp was assistant, who organised everyone and
      everything so efficiently on the days of the shoot that I could almost
      relax. I used two different lighting men: Hughie Johnson; and Roger Pratt,
      who again worked with Terry Gilliam. The crew were so receptive, and made
      a very daunting, expensive task a lot of fun. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It is very like making early albums: I feel a bit disappointed
      with the results, not having enough rehearsal, a big enough budget, etc.,
      etc., but the shoots were so much fun. It's such a good feeling to work
      with a big group of people. I seem to like working with crowds. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;On both 'Hounds of Love' and 'The Big Sky' shoots there was such a
      relaxed air --both shoots involved crowd scenes, and 'The Big Sky' was
      especially satisfying. Besides a large number of performers to fill a
      stage and give the effect of a live concert, we needed an avenue of
      people, from the Wright brothers to two astronauts, to simulate aviation
      history. The Wright brothers looked remarkably like Dave Cross and Peter
      Fitzgerald-Morris, and one of the astronauts looked so like Jay...We also
      needed a large, enthusiastic crowd, so we asked Dave Cross to organise
      some members of the Club, and two hundred beautifully behaved people
      arrived on the day of the shoot. It was very moving, they filled us all up
      with energy --It made it feel like a real concert. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;All the film crew remarked on how incredible everyone was. They
      had been terrified with past experiences of invited audiences, but I told
      them they hadn't met the right ones. Everyone left just as beautifully --
      nearly everyone with a burnt thumb from being a star in the sky holding up
      lighters and waving. I'd never been in the same room with so many stars
      before.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Oh, the little angels, how lovely! Did it take long to edit those two
      clips? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;No, I worked with John Mister as film editor. On both those
      shoots we worked to very detailed storyboards, and in both cases could
      give John a photostat of the script beforehand so he'd know the gist of
      what we were working on. Then he'd do a rough cut by himself, following
      the storyboard. Then we'd work together until we were happy. He was great
      to work with, and both edits were very quick: just taking them into the
      video suite for bits and pieces. But it would have to be transferred to
      video for T.V. showings, anyway, so all ads, &lt;sic -- Does she mean
      'adds', as in 'additions?&gt; etc., end up on video. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;'The Big Sky' was a little more complicated. The beginning part on
      the rooftops involves chromakey, where all the live action goes on in
      front of a blue screen and then the various weather effects were put in at
      the edit. The pieces of film with the weather were chosen beforehand and
      transferred to video; they then replaced the blue screen.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>That sounds awfully complicated, dear. We just roll our scenery up and
      down from the wings, it's so much easier. </P>
    
    <P>Now you must tell me about all these darling people you've been working
      with. What was it like working with that lovely Peter Gabriel again? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;I was so excited that he asked me to sing on that track --It's
      such a lovely, haunting song, and I love his work. But I do get nervous,
      especially when it's something I really like. His music is very strong,
      and he is a great person -- I love working with him.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> </P>
    
    <P>And those dear Big Country boys... </P>
    
    <P> Yes, I like the Celtic influences in their music. They were lovely to
      work with -- I really enjoyed it. They asked if I'd like to do some
      backing vocals, and I went in for an evening. They were really nice. It
      was fun. I like working with different people. I really enjoyed doing the
      Comic Relief concerts.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Oh, but my dear, the language was appalling. I'm afraid I had to write
      to &quot;Points of View&quot;. I was more than a little shocked that you
      and Cliff Richard of all people... </P>
    
    <P> &quot;It was fantastic. I'm a big fan of so many of those comedians
      --They are so talented. For me, alternative comedy is the most exciting
      thing coming out of this country at the moment, and to be involved in
      something with them all was really fulfilling. I felt nervous there, too,
      it's been a long time since I've performed live to an audience, but they
      were so warm. Unfortunately the piano pedal jammed on the first night in
      'Breathing' and I sang to the most horrific combination of chords you can
      imagine, so the second and third nights were relatively relaxed after
      that! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Singing with Rowan was hilarious. He's one of those people who can
      make his face and body language make you laugh without him having to
      speak. Again, I was so pleased that they asked me to take part. I wouldn't
      have missed it for the world. I just wish I'd been brave enough to ask
      most of them for their autographs --'Er, Ben, would you? I say, Rick, I've
      got this nephew...Just sign it, don't bother signing it to him...' You
      know, you're meant to act nonchalant, but I found myself starstruck.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P> I did see gorgeous Ronnie Corbett and the Monty Python chappies
      --Wasn't Terry Gilliam there? </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Yes, he was...Just so much talent. British comedy is unique and
      the best.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Here, here, Gr-r-reat Britain... </P>
    
    <P>I hear you sang &quot;Brazil&quot; on the soundtrack to Terry Gilliam's
      film. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Yes, what a beautiful song -- and I always thought it was a
      really bad cabaret number, but actually it is very sad and nostalgic. </P>
    
    <P> Of course it is, you silly girl -- One of the best tunes
      ever...Br-a-a-zillll... </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Michael Kamen did the orchestral arrangements. He worked on The
      Ninth Wave: 'Watching You Without Me' and 'Hello Earth'. He is very
      clever. He did the music for the film, and was putting the soundtrack
      album together with Terry, and they played me this beautiful arrangement
      without a voice. I'm not sure if this piece was in the film or not, but I
      don't sing in the film at all. It has such a 30s/40s feel, and Michael
      asked if I would sing over it -- My immediate reactions were fear and
      'Yes'.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Now, just before we have another cup of tea, I want to ask you if
      you're going to work with any more famous actors, because if you worked
      with that lovely Peter O'Toole you could tell him to pop in and see me and
      have a nice cup of tea, and we could act out one or two scenes from Romeo
      and Juliet... </P>
    
    <P>&lt;End of interview&gt; </P>

      <BR> Subject: Zwort Finkle Interview </P>
    
    <P>Finally, part one of a new KT interview: </P>
    
    <P>The following is a brand new interview with Kate, published in the
      latest issue of the official Kate Bush Club Newsletter. Don't ask IED what
      the deal on this Zwort guy is, he has no idea. The last time Kate was
      interviewed by &quot;Auntie Hetty&quot;... </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Cousin Kate&quot; by Zwort Finkle </P>
    
    <P>Hi, my name's Zwort Finkle, I'm from the U.S. of A. and I'm a distant
      cousin of Kate's. We haven't seen each other for years, so I had to fill
      her in on my life story. I left college three years ago, and have been
      following a brilliant career in journalism, working for such well known
      magazines as &quot;Blurt&quot;, &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;Let's Go
      Crazy Again&quot;, &quot;Son of Blurt&quot; and &quot;Let's Go Blurt Again&quot;.
      This was my first visit to London, and I was astounded at how you guys can
      survive this climate, how you manage to keep to one side of the road when
      the roads are so small, how quaint and cute you all are, and how totally
      bored and unenthused you all are with things that would make us little old
      Americans go &quot;Yee-Hah&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Tell me, Katie, have you ever thought of living in America? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: There are very few places I've been to that I've felt I could
      live in -- I think too many of my roots are here in England, and so much
      of my work is based here, and I seem to spend most of my time working.
      I've only been to America a few times, and then only to New York, L.A. and
      Las Vegas, but maybe if I visited more parts of America I would find a
      place that I feel I could live in. I really enjoyed my visits, especially
      to New York -- there's so much energy there, so many different and
      interesting people and a very social sense between artistic people, that
      certainly in the music business doesn't exist in this country. People seem
      to work in great isolation here, whereas in New York, people want to get
      together and talk and enthuse. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Like, er, do you feel there's a lack of enthusiasm here, cous'?
    </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes, I do, and I feel a lot of people, certainly within the music
      business, are particularly attracted to America by this. &quot;Artistic&quot;
      people like -- possibly even need -- a lot of feedback, and Americans are
      wonderful at making you feel wanted, and are very positive about the
      launching of new ideas, new approaches. It's exciting to be among this
      energy, and in England I think we're all a bit hard on each other, but
      this country has a great wealth of talent and creative ideas, it's just
      that people have to fight a little to get a bit of enthusiasm going. But
      maybe that's not such a bad thing -- maybe it creates more determination
      in a cause. What do you think, cousin Rodney? </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Actually, it's Zwort. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Sorry? </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Zwort!! </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Sorry, WHAT'S Zwort? </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: My name, of course. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Oh! </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: What were you doing in Las Vegas? That's an unusual place to
      visit! </P>
    
    <P>Katie: I was there with a guy from the record company just for a day,
      and it was really just an opportunity to see the place while he had
      business matters to deal with. It is an extraordinary place. Instead of
      saying &quot;How you doing?&quot;, everyone says, &quot;Feeling lucky?&quot;
      It's like a strange oasis stuck right in the middle of the desert away
      from everything. We took a flight in a small plane over the Grand Canyon,
      and it was one of the most terrifying experiences I've ever had. The
      Canyon is totally enormous, and we were so tiny --I've never experienced
      that kind of vertigo before or since, and with all the air pockets, we
      went up and down, up and down. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: I understand you don't do many interviews. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: That's right. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Why is that? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: I find it very difficult to express myself in interviews. Often
      people have so many preconceptions that I spend most of the interview
      trying to defend myself from the image that was created by the media eight
      years ago. That is understandable to a certain extent -- that's when I did
      most of my interviews, and I think the image was created by what the press
      felt the public wanted, how they interpreted me as I was then, and how I
      projected myself at that time. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: You mean like saying &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;, and
      that you were frail and fragile, etc. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes, that is part of it. I was very young, idealistic and
      enthusiastic about so much then, but I felt they exaggerated these
      qualities. And I was -- and am even more so now -- a private person, and
      perhaps because I wouldn't talk about these areas of my life they turned
      to the &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot; girl, even when I didn't use
      those words. The few interviews I do, people still seem to dwell on this
      old &quot;me&quot;, and I find it disappointing when I want to talk about
      my current work. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Do you, like, er, think enthusiasm was an unfashionable thing,
      particularly at this time, when punk and street cred were the &quot;hip&quot;
      thing? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes, I do. I think it still is, particularly in this country. But
      I think clever people hide their unfashionable faces from the public.
      Perhaps in a way, I was too open with the press, maybe I should have &quot;performed&quot;
      for them, and puked and gobbed at the cameras, but it's not my nature, I
      was brought up too well. The interviews I've sat through patiently,
      sometimes hanging onto my patience with the skin of my teeth, thinking
      it's good for my tolerance and might make me a better person. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: But you do occasionally talk to the press? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes. There are good people to talk to, they're not always talking
      about the past, or deliberately trying to make you look like an idiot, and
      are genuinely interested in my work. But it's like I said, I find it hard
      to express myself in interviews. It depends how I feel -- sometimes
      they're fun, especially if I know the journalist, and the questions are
      interesting -- they make you think about areas you might not have even
      considered before. But sometimes I find myself saying things just to
      please them, or just to give a question an answer. Sometimes I get verbal
      diarrhoea and just burble complete rubbish, and sometimes I feel so
      guarded that I invert, and feel like a trapped animal. Quite often I go
      over an interview in my head afterwards and realise I've said something
      completely contrary to what I believe, but I put most of it down to being
      quite a private person, and being someone who likes to think carefully
      about how I say something. Words are very special things, and are so
      easily misinterpreted --I much prefer to write lyrics than do an
      interview. I feel I'm a songwriter, not a personality, and I find it
      difficult to even talk about my songs, sometimes. In a way, they speak for
      themselves, and the subjects or inspirations can be so personal, or just
      seem ridiculous when spoken about. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Do you think it's important that people know what the songs are
      about? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: No, I think it can be interesting for people, but their
      interpretation is what matters, and I find it fascinating how people do
      seem to understand so much about a song that must be totally obscure and
      is so personal to me, but maybe they just FEEL it, they feel the emotions
      of the song, somehow grasp the meanings. It's so hard for me to tell
      because I know what it's about, but for example, some of the stuff on The
      Ninth Wave are so obscure lyrically, and yet people seem to know exactly
      what I'm trying to say. That's a great feeling. It stops me worrying about
      that aspect of songwriting -- that someone somewhere knows exactly what
      you're trying to put into words. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Do you have favourite lyric-writers, as opposed to &quot;musical&quot;
      songwriters? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: I'm not sure you can separate the two, because once a word is
      sung, it can completely change its feeling to the point where you don't
      recognise the word any more -- for me that is part of the fascination. But
      my favourite lyric just now is &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; by Paul
      Simon. The chorus of that is totally brilliant, particualarly the line, &quot;The
      way we look to the distant constellation that is dying in the corner of
      the sky.&quot; It's poetry, but the impact is the combination of the words
      with the music, and the way he sings it -- it's SO good. But quite often I
      mishear lyrics, and prefer my version to the real words when I find them
      out. I know a lot of people who have the same experience, and again we're
      back to what music means to the listener, or how they hear it. Music is a
      very special thing. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Would you say that music is something religious, even holy to
      you? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Some of the most beautiful music ever was written for God, for a
      loved one, in a state of grief, sorrow, suppression -- it seems to be an
      expression from a person on a higher level...? I'm not sure I understand
      it at all, but music seems to come out of people when very little else
      can. Some of the great composers wrote beautiful music but, as people,
      were monsters or maniacs. People who can't speak properly because of
      stutters can sing fluently. I saw a clip from a programme about a man who
      only had a short-term memory -- he couldn't remember anything: what he'd
      just said, just done. He lived in a constant state of panic, buecause he
      didn't know where he was, or why he was there. It was terrifying. The only
      thing he could remember was he wife, and when he sat at the church organ
      at his local church he could sing a play complete pieces of music without
      any problems. It was like he'd suddenly been set free. And yet when he was
      shown a video recording of him doing this, he had no memory of it 
      whatsoever. Music is a strange and beautiful thing. It means a great deal
      to me. I love listening to and making music. I am very lucky to be able to
      be involved with music -- I hope I always will be. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Do you think music comes from the soul? This is what some people
      believe. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: I don't know. I just know that music is something special, and
      also something very personal for people. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Going back to the obscurity of some of your songs that are
      personal to you, and how you feel people pick up on this --can you give
      some detailed examples? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Mmmh, let me think. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: I'll make a cup of coffee and you have a think, cous'. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Can I have tea? </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Yeah, sure -- you English and your tea. It's so quaint! Can we
      have scones and I'll have tea too? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Sorry, haven't got any, but there's some fig rolls... </P>
    
    <P>&lt;ten minutes later...&gt; </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Okay -- teabreak over. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Right, back to your question. I think it works on the basis of:
      if it moves you, it could move others. Hitchcock was talking about his
      films and saying the best subjects for his films that were frightening
      were things that frightened him -- like &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Apparently he
      was terrified of heights. It seems logical, doesn't it? </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Yeah, sure. Hitchcock was brilliant. </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes, I agree, a genius. An engineer we were working with picked
      out the line in &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; that says &quot;Come here
      with me now.&quot; I asked him why he liked it so much. He said, &quot;I
      don't know, I just love it. It's so moving and comforting.&quot; I don't
      think he even knew what was being said exactly, but the song is about
      someone going to sleep in the water, where they're alone and frightened.
      And they want to go to sleep, to get away from the situation. But at the
      same time it's dangerous to go to sleep in water, you could drown. When I
      was little, and I'd had a bad dream, I'd go into my parents' bedroom round
      to my mother's side of the bed. She'd be asleep, and I wouldn't want to
      wake her, so I'd stand there and waid for her to sense my presence and
      wake up. She always did, within minutes; and sometimes I'd frighten her --
      standing there still, in the darkness in my nightdress. I'd say, &quot;I've
      had a bad dream,&quot; and she'd lift up the bedclothes and say something
      like &quot;Come here with me now.&quot; It's my mother saying this line in
      the track, and I briefed her on the ideas behind it before she said it.
      And I think it's the motherly comfort that this engineer picked up on. In
      fact, he said this was his favourite part of the album. &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
      is, again, lyrically very obscure. I think the idea is easy to grasp, but
      the story behind it is very involved, and in a way the video that
      accompanies it is equally so, but I've spoken to several people who have
      felt very moved by the song or the video or both, and they all say they
      feel this really personal relationship between the child and his father,
      how real it seems, how sad it is. For me, that is wonderful -- the book
      that originally inspired the song and video moved me so much! It's so sad,
      and it's also a true story, and somehow even if people don't understand
      the story, they pick up on the feelings, the emotions -- this is a very
      rewarding experience for me. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: did the writer of the book get to hear the song and see the
      video? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes. These were worrying moments for me -- what if he didn't like
      it? If I'd got it wrong? But he said he found them very emotional and that
      I'd captured the situation. This was the ultimate reward for me. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Do you stay in contact? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes, we write to each other, and I enjoy the contact very much.
      Many people have tried to get this book &lt;A Book of Dreams, by Peter
      Reich&gt;, many have read it since and adore it. The trouble is, the book
      is out of print, and I think it's such a shame that it's unavailable for
      those that would love to read it. It's very difficult to find copies of
      it, though I understand that some libraries still carry it. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: How do you feel about &quot;The Whole Story&quot;? Were you
      against the release of a compilation album? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes, I was at first. I was concerned that it would be like a &quot;K-Tel&quot;
      record, a cheapo-compo with little thought behind it. It was the record
      company's decision, and I didn't mind as long as it was well put together.
      We put a lot of work into the packaging, trying to make it look tasteful,
      and carefully thought out the running order. And the response has been
      phenomenal -- I'm amazed! </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Careful, there's that word! </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Surely I can say it once or twice. Everybody else does, and gets
      away with it -- Zzzwort!! </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Only teasing. How do you feel about the video compilation? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Again, I was worried initially, because of the release of &quot;The
      Single File&quot; and &quot;Hair of the Hound&quot;, but with the
      opportunity of getting &quot;Experiment IV&quot; on it, and the record
      company being sure there was a market, I felt it could be a good idea. We
      spent a lot of work on &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, and because of it almost
      being an &quot;adult&quot; video, we were sure we'd have trouble getting
      it shown on TV. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Did you have trouble getting it shown? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Yes. The video took a long time to make, and with having to write
      and record the single with the tightest deadlines I've ever had, the video
      was needed before we'd finished it. But we did get a minute clip ready in
      time to be shown when the single was charting, but Top of the Pops refused
      to show it, saying it was too violent! It's not violent at all, but we
      expected a response like this. Pop promos are in a very sensitive area.
      They're considered &quot;family viewing&quot;, but there are many sexualy
      ambiguous videos shown on children's TV -- yet this was considered too
      extreme. However, The Tube showed it in its entirety, and it's now showing
      at the cinema with a feature film, so we've made a sort of B-film!! That's
      quite exciting. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: I noticed that instead of the &quot;Wow&quot; video you've pieced
      together footage from the live shows. Why is this? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Two reasons, really. Firstly, I really don't like the promo we
      did for &quot;Wow&quot;. I think it's silly. And also, looking through the
      videos I noticed a great absence of &quot;performance&quot; promos, and
      the tour was an important part of the story. Also, it makes it a more
      interesting item for people who have some of the other videos. That way
      it's not just &quot;Experiment IV&quot; that is a new visual. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: I understand you directed this clip. How did it go, and why did
      you direct it? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Directing is a new experiment for me -- actually, it was
      Experiment III -- and with this track I had such strong visual ideas while
      I was writing the song that I wanted to give it another go. It's the first
      time the video and song have come together. It was very hard work, but a
      lot of fun. </P>
    
    <P> We filmed in an old disused hospital, and the conditions were very cold
      and damp, but everyone got very involved and we had a great time. </P>
    
    <P> The cast included Dawn French, Hugh Laurie, Richard Vernon, Peter
      Vaughan, Del, Paddy, Jay, Lisa and many friends. It was wonderful to work
      with people who I admire so much, and a very exciting experience. Paddy
      played the lunatic, and in every take his sounds were just as impressive
      as his visuals -- I wish I'd put it onto tape. He literally &quot;threw&quot;
      himself into the part, and the crew were so impressed they applauded him
      -- a great accolade! </P>
    
    <P> Although this was the most complicated of my directions, it was so much
      easier for me because I appeared in it only briefly, so I could
      concentrate on being behind the camera, which I really enjoy. And it's so
      nice to involve the people I like -- not only are they great performers
      but they're good to be with. </P>
    
    <P> There were some wonderful moments, like filming in East London. We had
      a field full of &quot;dead bodies&quot; who kept moving about to get more
      comfortable, so we had to shout out over a loud-hailer, &quot;Stop moving
      -- You're supposed to be dead!&quot; And the music shop that we created
      for the shot &lt;&quot;Music for Pleasure&quot;&gt; was so realistic that
      passers-by kept popping in wanting to buy some of the instruments. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: How do you view the changes audially and visually on &quot;The
      Whole Story&quot; album and video? </P>
    
    <P>Katie: I really like the idea of the album being available on video --
      I've always wanted to make a form of video album, but I never thought it
      would be a compilation! </P>
    
    <P> I see two main changes, although I'm very subjective. Audially, the
      important step for me was production, which had led on to our own studio.
      The process is so much more personal because of this. On the first two
      albums all my arrangements were contained within the piano arrangement,
      which was the foundation, but which was then handed over to Andrew Powell
      as producer to interpret with his string arrangements. And the musicians
      and I worked in my backing vocals by playing the tapes over and over and
      singing along. But being producer I could put a lot less emphasis on the
      piano arrangement and interpret the song through other instruments onto
      tape, even playing around with the parts after the musicians had gone, and
      getting our own studio meant I could build up the song straight onto tape,
      keeping bits that worked and building up ideas even before the musicians
      came in. </P>
    
    <P> Visually, I see a shift from being inspired by dance (Lindsay Kemp
      being a big influence), to filmic imagery (being influenced by all the
      films I love so much). I find the combination of film and music very
      exciting, and it's very rare for people to concentrate on both with equal
      concern -- film-makers don't want the music to distract, and musicians
      don't want the visuals to be stronger than the music. But when it works,
      it's so powerful! For instance, &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Singing in the
      Rain&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot; -- there are definitely people moving this
      way more and more. It's great. </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: Wouldn't it be great to attack all the senses at once? To have
      film and music, sensurround fitted to the seats, scents filtered in
      through the air-conditioning -- Yee-hah! </P>
    
    <P>Katie: Oh, Cousin Rodney -- that's what I love about you: you're so
      enthusiastic! </P>
    
    <P>Zwort: It's ZWORT! </P>

    <P>Kate seems like the kind of person I would enjoy having tea with and
      discussing absolutely anything, quite a contrast to The Boss or most other
      chart-toppers (not all). Someone with a mind, and with some passion for
      her art. A pleasure to know, even if only 3rd hand. </P>

      <BR> Subject: 'A Could Be Story' by Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>The following is a short story written by Kate Bush. It's called &quot;A
      Could Be Story&quot;, and was printed in the fourth Kate Bush Club
      Newsletter, which came out in the late summer of 1979. </P>
    
    <P> A Could Be Story </P>
    
    <P>When the Shades went into Priory Street Studios to make their third
      album they were working on a very tight schedule. Their first album had
      made the top sixty but their second had hardly done anything at all, and
      now their third one had to be good or they would have difficulty in
      getting another recording contract. They felt they needed to find a
      Christmas single that would help them out of their troubles, but they only
      had until the end of November to get this together. Any later than that
      and the record company would be unable to bring a single out -- even
      November was cutting it pretty fine! They had decided to try something
      different on the new album and had become interested again in the music
      that was around in the middle 50s. </P>
    
    <P>They had come across a song that none of them had ever heard of before,
      and it could be the one they were looking for. The song was called &quot;I'm
      Riding with Santa Tonight&quot;, by someone called Billy Smith. They
      decided they would give it a very genuine Bill Haley treatment, with
      saxaphones and lots of </P>
    
    <P>shoo-bops-doo-wah-woo-bops-di-wops. </P>
    
    <P>They worked on the rhythm track the first day, putting onto tape the
      drums, bass guitar and some funky rock-and-roll piano, with a rough
      voice-track to keep it all together. Late that night they played the
      various takes they'd done, to choose the one they would keep. Half way
      through listening to the first take the recording engineer started to look
      worried and began pressing buttons and pulling down slide controls on his
      mixing desk where all the sounds were controlled. When he was asked what
      was the matter, he said he was starting to pick up interference on the
      track that certainly hadn't been put on there by any of the band during
      the day. This was the first time he had worked in Priory Street Studios,
      and he was not used to the equipment. He played back the bit that he
      thought was wrong, and there was quite clearly a whining sound breaking in
      on the track. It could have been a loose connection, or even one of the
      band's stomachs rumbling. </P>
    
    <P>They listened to all the takes, but the interference was there on each
      one, and the engineer couldn't find a way of shifting it. This meant a
      whole day of studio time had been wasted, and feeling pretty disappointed
      with their first attempt at a comeback, the Shades slid back home in the
      early hours to get some sleep before starting again the following day.
    </P>
    
    <P>At two o'clock the next afternoon they turned up at the studio and did
      the rhythm track once again. But on listening to it that evening, instead
      of the interference having been cleaned off, it was now even more
      noticeable, and the engineer could not understand what was happening. It
      put him in a difficult situation because the band were now talking about
      using other studios; but he'd been booked for the next two months to do
      the album, and he was determined that was what he was going to do. After a
      lot of arguing and shouting the Shades were sitting on one side of the
      studio and the recording engineer and his assistant on the other and they
      weren't talking. </P>
    
    <P>At that point the roadie who looked after the Shades' equipment came
      bouncing into the studio hoping to get an earful of what had been going on
      for the last couple of days. When he saw the glum faces he knew something
      was up, and had great difficulty in persuading the engineer to let him
      hear the tape. Eventually he was persuaded, and the roadie sat back and
      listened with a critical ear. The Shades knew that he never missed
      spotting a potential hit single and they often used him as a test of their
      music. </P>
    
    <P>When the track came to the bit with the heavy interference the roadie
      began to brighten up, much to the surprise of everyone else in the room.
      When the track had finished, he said it was one of the best things he'd
      ever heard, and how on earth did they get the amazing effects? The
      engineer had to say that it was a mistake, and they'd been trying to get
      rid of it. The roadie said that that was ridiculous, and he managed to
      persuade everybody that if they pretended it wasn't interference but a
      very interesting form of synthesiser, it could be the hook needed on the
      record to make it sell. So it was agreed that the Shades would come back
      in the next day and put down some guitar work and talk about the vocals.
    </P>
    
    <P>On the third day, at the end of the evening, they played back an almost
      completed track, apart from the lead vocals. Once again, the interference
      was there, and once again, if anything, it seemed to be a lot more
      dominant. But they had to agree with the roadie that it certainly did give
      the song a lot of crackle and bite. When the lead vocal was put on and the
      track finished and ready to go off to the record company for their
      approval -- and hopefully then for release as a single -- they all
      gathered for one final listen. </P>
    
    <P>The odd thing was that the interference now seemed to have mellowed out,
      and was almost adding a very strange sort of harmony to the lead singer's
      voice. But everyone agreed that the track was good, and that it could
      work. </P>
    
    <P>When &quot;I'm Riding With Santa&quot; eventually reached number ten on
      the hit parade, the Shades arrived at the Top of the Pops studio to appear
      for a Christmas edition and sing their hit single. While they were waiting
      in the canteen to be called up to perform, they talked with a producer
      friend and mentioned that they had recorded the single at Priory Street
      Studios. He nodded his head to show that he knew the studios, and then
      asked them if they'd had any trouble with the ghost. </P>
    
    <P>The Shades looked at each other, and went whiter than the white make-up
      they wore on stage. The producer explained to them that Priory Street
      Studios had a reputation for its ghost, and that at one time the owners
      had thought of closing down the studio because of the electrical
      interference they kept getting on takes. They had gone as far as taking
      out all the equipment, having it thoroughly looked at and put back in
      again, but this had made no difference. In the early 70s the Studios had
      been completely re-modernised, and he'd assumed that the troubles were
      over, but he had heard that occasionally they still had problems. </P>
    
    <P>The Shades didn't say anything, but after doing a strong appearance --
      though it was a rather shaky one -- on the television, they went for a
      celebration party at a friend's house. They now had a good talk about the
      ghost story they'd heard, and they were all wondering whether it was the
      ghost that had made the single a success. </P>
    
    <P>The following day they sent their roadie off to the publishing company
      where they'd found the song, with the job of looking through the
      catalogues and finding anything he could about the song and the
      songwriter. That evening he met them at the studio with some very
      interesting news. It seemed that Billy Smith, who had written &quot;I'm
      Riding with Santa Tonight&quot;, recorded his first and only album at
      Priory Street Studios. All the songs on the album were his own
      compositions -- this was quite unusual in those days, as most of the early
      rock-and-roll singers in England sang other people's songs. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, just after the album had been completed he'd been
      electrocuted in the Studios when something had gone wrong with his
      electric guitar. The record company hadn't thought much of his album
      anyway, so it was shelved and eventually completely forgotten. </P>
    
    <P>The Shades thought this was a pretty good reason for a ghost to hang
      about the studios and, wondering how they could best express their thanks
      to the dead rock singer, they decided to put a credit on the album -- &quot;Ghost
      Synthesiser by Billy Smith&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Apparently there has been no more trouble with interference at Priory
      Street Studios, which probably goes to show that a ghost is quite content
      when his music has eventually reached his public. </P>
    
    <P>-- Kate </P>
    
    <P> Perhaps it's worth mentioning that this story came out at about the
      same time that Kate was working on the early version of her Christmas
      recording, &quot;December Will Be Magic Again,&quot; which she also
      performed on Top of The Pops; and that more than once since then she has
      commented on the powerful sense of history she experienced while working
      in Abbey Road Studios. </P>

      <BR> Subject: 'On the Road Home' by Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>Here is the last of the three short short stories which have appeared in
      past Kate Bush Club Newsletters. &quot;On the Road Home&quot; was
      published in Number 15, the Christmas 1983 issue; and like the two earlier
      stories, this one is set off by snow, cold rain and a dark winter night...
    </P>
    
    <P> On the Road Home </P>
    
    <P>It had been a good day, and as I tied the tree on to the roof it
      showered me in its green perfume. For just a moment it took me to that
      place where all my Christmas days meet as one; where there are reindeer
      and chimney pots and blazing fires. It hung in my head for an instant and
      then was gone as I checked the clock and made for the shops. </P>
    
    <P>It was unusually quiet for an afternoon so near to Christmas. It had
      even snowed that morning, and the shop attendants seemed almost happy at
      their work. It felt like some kind of magic, wrapping everyone and
      everything up. </P>
    
    <P>The ever-growing list was finally getting smaller -- tick, tick, tick:
      the turkey, the pudding, the crackers. Tick, tick: a present for David, a
      present for Granddad. </P>
    
    <P>With just five minutes to spare, I had finished the shopping and was
      wading back to the car through the snow. It really was quiet that night,
      and it had been dark for a good hour. I opened the car boot and wedged as
      much as possible into the already full space. </P>
    
    <P>It was great to be in the car and on the way home. Everything looked so
      beautiful in the snow! It was like driving down a tunnel of trees to
      Narnia. I was in no hurry, and didn't feel like the radio -- the snow and
      my thoughts were just right together. Not too fast, remember the driving
      conditions, ease off the accelerator, check the mirror (no-one around),
      nice and easy... </P>
    
    <P>It was just as I started thinking about checking the tree on the roof
      that I got this feeling...this feeling that there was someone else in the
      car. I dismissed it -- ridiculous, I'd have seen them. Check the mirror.
      There. Nothing. But what if he's lying down on the back seat and I can't
      see him? </P>
    
    <P>I slowed right down, and twisted my head round. Nothing. </P>
    
    <P>Check the mirror. It must be paranoia. I'm going just a little faster
      now. I know it's nothing, but it's just this feeling... </P>
    
    <P>Then his face is right there, in between the two front seats: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Look out, look out...Stop.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>My eyes turned from his moving lips to the road, my foot already
      reacting on the brake. I skidded to a stop. After just a few seconds I had
      taken in that there was nothing in the road. Nothing in front, nothing
      behind...and no-one in the back of the car. </P>
    
    <P>The thought of having to get out into the night -- out of the car --was
      more terrifying than staying in it, so I started up the motor, put my foot
      steadily on the accelerator and turned on the radio --light music, nice
      and loud. </P>
    
    <P>By the time I turned into the drive I was wondering if it had really
      happened at all. I was shaking, and hadn't checked my mirror once since
      I'd had to stop. I ran into the house. As soon as I saw David I released
      the tears. </P>
    
    <P>I don't know if he believed me or not, and it didn't matter at the time.
      He acted like he did, that was all I needed. After all, I was seriously
      doubting it myself. </P>
    
    <P>It was a week later, and we were all to go out for the evening. We
      arranged for our friends to pick us up on the way. It was Christmas Eve --
      the first time for years we'd left the house on that night. We were
      looking forward to the break, and once we were at the party we relaxed and
      enjoyed the rest from the rush. None of us really drank, but we ate as
      much as possible, working our way up the table -- the food was delightful;
      and like perfect guests, as soon as we'd had our fill we left, in order to
      be in our homes to celebrate Christmas. </P>
    
    <P>Since we'd arrived the weather had broken into a storm -- heavy wind and
      rain. We piled into the car -- our friends in the front, David and I in
      the back -- and rolled toward home. After a while I realised what route we
      were now taking on the way to our house: past the shops... My eyes fixed
      on the road ahead. I felt uncomfortable -- it was that same feeling -- I
      would not panic -- </P>
    
    <P> We came to the spot where I had stopped that night, that figure
      shouting in my ear. We were travelling at a fair speed. Then there he was
      -- standing in the road, waving his arms to and fro. He was right in front
      of us. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Look out, look out...Stop.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The words came out as if they were not my own. </P>
    
    <P>The car ground to a halt, all four of us staring ahead. Still held by my
      fear, the other three slowly turned their faces toward mine. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;God, what's the matter with you?&quot; shouted David, his face
      pale. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Didn't you see him?&quot; I screamed. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;See what?&quot; </P>
    
    <P>I couldn't believe it -- he must be joking. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;What did you see?&quot; queried my two friends, now laughing a
      little as they shook off their fright. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The man...in the road!&quot; I gasped. </P>
    
    <P>As I pushed open the back door and got out, I looked back --nothing. I
      looked ahead of the car -- nothing. I would not have this! I knew I had
      seen him this time -- he was real. The car headlights -- the light beams
      filled with rain -- stopped dead about six feet from the car. After that,
      darkness. Maybe he had fallen down. He must have been further ahead than I
      had thought. My friends, now concerned by my worry, were sitting with
      knitted brows in the car. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Please,&quot; I said, &quot;move the car forward very slowly -- I
      need the light on the road.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The light slowly moved across the tarmac. I waited for a shoe, a hand.
      Then the edge of the light hit a rough brown surface. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;There's something here!&quot; I shouted. The light steadily moved
      forward and revealed the huge bough of a tree. It must have been a
      twenty-, thirty-footer, fallen in the storm. The car stopped. All four of
      us stood, fixed on the object. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The speed we were going...&quot; David said. &quot;How did you see
      it?&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I didn't,&quot; I answered. I hadn't seen it. </P>
    
    <P>None of us could say anything -- we were too shocked. We couldn't
      believe it. It had been close. So strange. </P>
    
    <P>In the distance the clock struck the first chime of Christmas day. </P>
    
    <P>And in the distance but coming towards us was the constant buzz of an
      engine. We'd all heard it. Something travelling fast: a motorbike, and now
      he's in view, he's coming straight towards us. He's not wearing a helmet,
      and with his hair pelted back by the rain, his face is white and stark in
      the night. His face is very like that man's -- that man who was first
      shouting, then waving, is now coming straight for us. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Look out, look out...Stop.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>-- Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>Nice little story, no? A bit more art to it than in &quot;A Could Be
      Story&quot;. Judging from the driving paranoia in it, it's fair to assume
      that it was written about the same time that Kate was learning to drive
      (she's said she learned during the hiatus between The Dreaming and Hounds
      of Love.) Also of interest to IED are the image of car headlights (as in &quot;Full
      House&quot; and &quot;Don't Put Your Foot on the Heart Brake&quot;); the
      shifts from past to present tense at crucial dramatic moments; the phrase
      &quot;something traveling fast&quot; (as in &quot;Hello Earth&quot;); and
      the reference to a meat Christmas -- not the first time Kate has let
      negative traditions override her personal convictions for the sake of
      their beauty, or of their associative or artistic power.</P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
      <BR> Subject: 'Tansa's Guitar' by Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>Here is a second short story written by Kate Bush. &quot;Tansa's Guitar&quot;
      first appeared in the Christmas 1981 issue (#11) of the Kate Bush Club
      Newsletter. Another cold, snowy story from Kate... </P>
    
    <P> Tansa's Guitar </P>
    
    <P>Weston was going on his winter tour and needed some focal point to make
      the tour more complete and relevant. He had recently bought a guitar at an
      auction in New York. The guitar had been beautifully made in California by
      a small company with a reputation among the leading rock musicians. </P>
    
    <P>The guitar had a strange history, and was meant to have passed through
      the hands of a number of guitar heroes at the end of the sixties and early
      seventies. There was no documentation with the instrument to indicate who
      had owned it over the years, but the original bill showing that it was
      bought from Tansa of California had come with the instrument. </P>
    
    <P>Weston hoped that he could use this instrument as an extra dynamic in
      his act. For a moment he remembered how the auctioneer had held the guitar
      by its neck, looking as though he was acknowledging the roars of a crowd
      at the end of a concert, with the handmade gold machine-heads on the
      instrument suddenly reflecting the lighting of the auction rooms. Weston
      had known instinctively as a professional musician that his excitement at
      seeing the guitar was nothing to do with the external appearance of the
      instrument. It was something deeper, almost like seeing a beautiful girl
      in a crowded place and then seeing her eyes turning to meet his, and not
      turning away. </P>
    
    <P>There was a great deal of carving on the instrument, not unlike the sort
      of tooling and decoration that used to be found on muskets. The instrument
      was heavy, but Weston liked a heavy guitar, liked to feel its weight
      pulling down on his neck and centering in his stomach. With that sort of
      stability, his hands could flit around the neck and body of the instrument
      like white spiders. </P>
    
    <P>When the rehearsals for his tour began, Weston realised that the guitar
      was no ordinary instrument. At first it wouldn't work at all. He felt
      clumsy, he felt as though he'd only been playing guitars for a couple of
      years, he felt as though his bones and muscles were reacting to the cold
      winter air like thick oil. But after a couple of hours the instrument
      began to sing, and by the end of the rehearsal session Weston was feeling
      good. When he had finished, he handed the guitar to his roadie. The roadie
      made it quite clear that although he thought the instrument very beautiful
      it was, in his terms, a &quot;weird axe&quot;, and Weston would be better
      off leaving it alone. Weston laught this off -- if the guitar had any
      sinister connections, he was going to blow them to pieces with his
      playing. </P>
    
    <P>As he was getting ready for the first gig of the tour a message came
      through that Tansa of California were phoning from America, saying that
      Weston owed them for a guitar he had recently purchased at an auction.
      This puzzled Weston, as he had personally handed over the money to the
      auctioneer, but he had no time for these sort of problems, with only half
      an hour to go. As he warmed up in his dressing room the instrument
      responded well and Weston felt that the night was going to go in a
      positive direction. But when he got out under the lights in front of the
      audience and roars of appreciation had quietened down, he began to feel
      that same thick, oil-sump movement in his hands. He asked the management
      to put up the heating on the stage during the act. But things didn't get
      very much better, and by the interval he had changed his guitar and was
      back on one of his standard favourite instruments. When the second half
      ended, he pulled the place together and during his last number the
      audience had begun to dance at the back. </P>
    
    <P>On the second gig, a similar situation occurred. With only a few minutes
      left before going on stage a message came through that Tansa wanted to
      talk to him about payment for a guitar. And again, when he went on to the
      stage the same thing happened: he couldn't make the instrument function
      properly. </P>
    
    <P>It was during one of these moments, when he was on the verge of deciding
      whether to try a particularly tricky solo on the instrument, that he
      noticed a man sitting in the front row of the audience, clearly lit up by
      the stage lighting. This man was looking at him with something more than
      just the expression of a fan lost in a dream of appreciation. He was
      definitely trying to catch Weston's eye, and it wasn't to indicate to him
      that liked what he was doing. </P>
    
    <P>Again he had to change over to another guitar for the second half, and
      again the gig took off as soon as he'd made the switch. Afterwards in the
      dressing room, he was told that there was somebody at the back stage
      entrance demanding that he see Weston about payment for the guitar. Weston
      dismissed it; but as they were driving away from the gig, and as usual
      many faces pushed themselves against the window of the car to look at
      Weston, staring into the back seat through the warm glass of the window
      was the face he'd seen in the front of the audience. The man was shouting
      something at him and he appeared angry. Weston gave instructions to the
      driver to go faster, and they cleared the crowd without any mishap. </P>
    
    <P>By now the rest of the band were quite familiar with the weird,
      unpredictable playing of their front-man and were trying to persuade him
      to leave the instrument alone. Weston, however, took it on stage on the
      third gig, and after the first hour of the first half, having been unable
      to make the instrument sing and soar, he flung it across the stage, where
      it smashed into a stack of amplifiers and fell to the ground, with the
      whole of the back-plate coming apart and tinkling on the wooden stage
      floor. He picked up one of his other guitars, but the anger and
      frustration that had caused him to sling Tansa's instrument away from him
      seemed to have affected his guitar playing, and the concert was not a
      success. </P>
    
    <P>This gig was in London, and by the time they'd finished and were coming
      down backstage, Weston could hear a strange silence through the dressing
      room windows, and he knew immediately that the whole of the city was
      encased in snow. Depressed and puzzled, he got ready to make a run for the
      car. As he was doing this, his guitar-roadie came in with the broken
      instrument, pointing out that there was no real damage and that it was
      nothing he couldn't sort out in a couple of hours. </P>
    
    <P>Weston wanted to get back to his bed and sleep, so he went with the
      roadie in the crew van. As they were pulling away from the theatre down a
      narrow alley, a man came running out of a shop doorway, and immediately
      Weston recognised him as the man who'd been watching him from the
      audience. The roadie pointed out to him that it was the same man who'd
      been hanging around the stage door saying he was from Tansa and needed
      payment. </P>
    
    <P>As they accelerated away, the man ran faster and faster, and although
      the vehicle was quite easily doing in excess of 40 mph on the wet and
      sludgy road, the man was still gaining on them. They could hear him
      shouting that he'd come for payment, that payment was needed and that
      until Weston had made the payment he would never be able to play the
      guitar in fron of an audience. The people inside the van were beginning to
      panic now, as on a straight run up a deserted and quite Oxford Street they
      hit 55, almost 60 mph -- but the man was still gaining. </P>
    
    <P>The roadie suddenly kicked open the back door of the vehicle and slung
      the guitar out into the snow towards the running man. He slammed the door
      and they skidded round the corner and were away. The last Weston saw of
      the guitar was the man gently picking it up out of the sludge, talking to
      himself -- or to the instrument. Then a shop window full of Christmas
      decorations blocked his view. Weston didn't feel angry, but still he
      wanted to know what the hell his roadie meant by throwing his best guitar
      out of the back of the van. The roadie, who was quite shaken and upset,
      took a piece of paper from out of his pocket. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I found this stuck inside the back of the guitar.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>It was a bill from Tansa, and written on it were the words: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;One handmade custom guitar -- material and
      <BR> sundries: $2000.00. </P>
    
    <P>Special effects for enchanting &amp; capturing
      <BR> the minds of audiences, OUR FEE: One soul. </P>

    <P>From: KNIGHT%MAINE.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU (Michael Knight)
      <BR> Date: Thu, 31 Dec 87 00:56:46 EST
      <BR> Subject: New Kate Bush Interview. </P>
    
    <P>Here is the interview from the new Kate Bush Club newsletter. </P>
    
    <P>Q. How is the new album going? </P>
    
    <P>A. Well, as usual it is slow but I keep writing new songs as I feel the
      urge and I now have lots of songs but most of them have pieces missing or
      sparse lyrics and sorting these things out takes a lot of time. </P>
    
    <P>Q. How are you approaching this album, is it different from the last
      one? </P>
    
    <P>A. Again I am working straight onto master tape in out home studio, as I
      get ideas I put them onto tape.. sometimes this causes more problems
      because I'll like parts of it and not others but I try to re-do as little
      as possible.. I like to try and keep the performances quick and
      spontaneous, it's the sorting out of these performances afterwards and the
      rethinking of structure or arrangements that take the time. Each musician
      changes the feel of the track dramatically and it's important to keep the
      track moving in the right direction and to communicate what is wanted whic
      in my case is achieved through images, humming lines and letting the
      musicians do what they feel is right and saying if I don't like it.. it
      seems to have worked so far and I always find musicians so imspiring.
      Quite often they'll put an edge to the track that gives it greater
      potential so I sit and rethink bits again. The tracks continually change
      and yet the original &quot;feeling&quot; goesn't seem to.. I'd like to
      think that by putting the initial &quot;muse&quot; onto tape.. we've
      captured it's soul.. so that whatever we put on top of it, it is in
      essence the same. </P>
    
    <P>Q. Are you using a lot of synthesizers, if so, which ones and how? </P>
    
    <P>A. I'm using the Fairlight again and a DX 7 but a lot of the songs have
      been written on piano initially and it does definitely give the songs a
      different flavour from those written on Fairlight. A lot of rhythms are
      arranged by Del and we tend to keep bits and replace a lot with real
      drums.. but still keeping his &quot;feel&quot;, but there are a few tracks
      which are just synthesized drums.. it's whatever works but I am using a
      lot of real instruments on this album. I really like working with
      musicians, they approach things from a different angle.. they have fresh
      ideas. </P>
    
    <P>Q. When will the album be finished? </P>
    
    <P>A. Umm...... </P>
    
    <P>Q. When do you think it will be finished? </P>
    
    <P>A. Umm...... </P>
    
    <P>Q. Have you been doing other projects besides the album? </P>
    
    <P>A. I've been mainly concentrating on the album and catching up on my
      life a bit but I did write a song for a film by an American Director..
      John Hughes. The piece from the film is extremely moving an I really
      enjoyed writing to it.. Let's hope when the film is released (hopefully
      some time in '88) that you get to see it.. the director has a very
      distinctive style (he directed &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; ..which I really
      like) and I think this, his lates film &quot;She's Having A Baby&quot; is
      well worth a watch. </P>
    
    <P>Q. You also appeared at Peter Gabriel's live concert at Earls Court...
    </P>
    
    <P>A. Yes, it was very much a last minute decision.. Peter had asked me and
      I wasn't sure if I was brave enough to perform unrehearsed in front of
      such a large crowd.. it is such a beautiful song to sing but the reception
      from the audience was overwhelming.. I couldn't hear what I was singing..
      so if anyone reading this was there that night.. sorry if I was a bit out
      of tune and if you were one of those people.. thanks for an incredible
      experience, I don't think I'll ever forget that welcome. It was a
      fantastic concert and I am again very honoured to have been involved in
      Peter's work. </P>
    
    <P>Q. I know you like animals and I hear you keep cats.. I wondered how
      many you have? </P>
    
    <P>A. I used to have 2 cats.. Zoodle and Pyewackit but I'm afraid that
      Zoodle died earlier this year.. I was very upset but she was eleven and
      had a good life. She was a beautiful cat. Pyewackit is absolutely fine
      although she missed Zoodle at first. A few months ago we adopted a stray,
      feeding her and letting her live in the garage and she had 3 kittens. We
      now have the 3 kittens, they are called Rocket, Sparky and Torchy and
      although Pye didn't like them all at first.. they all get on really well
      now and we find them cuddled up on a chair together when we get in..
      they're such good company for her and they all have such different
      personalities.. it's so entertaining just sitting watching them play..
      it's bringing out the kitten in Pye, I've noticed her springing across the
      floor and leaping onto ledges that are far too small for her.. she does
      things she hasn't tried for years and seems to be enjoying it all. I guess
      we're all young at heart.. but sometimes it takes something to rediscover
      it! </P>

      <BR> Subject: KT NEWS </P>
    
    <P>The following notice from the KATE BUSH CLUB arrived in IED's mailbox
      today: </P>
    
    <P>As many of you will already know, Kate's new album &quot;The Sensual
      World&quot; will be released on 16th October. We thought you might like to
      know in advance about some of the interviews which will be appearing over
      the next month or so. As far as Kate knows, she will not be doing any
      P.A.s &lt;Personal appearances&gt;. </P>
    
    <P>Q MAGAZINE...........November issue (out 10th October) </P>
    
    <P>THE GUARDIAN........Arts page (12th October) </P>

    <P>R.A.W......................Issue 31 (out 1st November) </P>
    
    <P>INTERNATIONAL MUSICIAN....December issue (out 2nd November)--6-pg. </P>
    
    <P>There will be articles in various overseas publications but we could not
      get definite information in time so keep your ears and eyes open. </P>
    
    <P>The Club magazine will be with you soon after the album is released.
    </P>
    
    <P> That is all the note said. </P>
    
    <P>*--IED believes there was nothing (aside from an album-release
      announcement) in the issue of MM for the week ending October 14th. Perhaps
      MM means to have an interview in the October 14th issue. </P>
    
    <P>**--The NME interview for the week ending October 14th (i.e., the
      October 7th issue, IED assumes) did indeed contain a long interview with
      Kate, and IED has already transcribed and posted it for the delectation of
      Love-Hounds worldwide. </P>
    
    <P>With luck Neil Calton and the other admirable U.K.-based Love-Hounds are
      reading this posting, and perhaps one or more of them will make an effort
      to acquire some of the interviews listed above--in particular those which
      will probably never be imported to the U.S. American fans can probably get
      hold of the Q Magazine interview, the one in The Guardian and the one in
      International Musician. But things like the Woolworths throwaway paper
      Tracks, the publication with the (to IED) mysterious name R.A.W., and You
      Magazine will almost certainly never wash up onto U.S. shores, so IED
      implores the English philocanines to take pity on us benighted Yanks and
      obtain/transcribe/ post these rare British treasures as soon as they
      become available. </P>

      <BR> Subject: MESSAGE FROM KATE </P>
    
    <P> I'm kinda surprised that there hasn't been more talk about the KBC
      flyer, though I may have missed the talk. First off it contains a message
      from Kate which says: </P>
    
    <P> I was really knocked out by the beautiful cards and gifts you sent for
      my birthday, you are all so very kind - thank you. The album is going well
      and I think it might be good...... </P>
    
    <P>Meanwhile I hope you like Rocket Man. </P>
    
    <P> With Love, </P>
    
    <P>Kate </P>
    
    <P> It's not long, but hey it's from Kate. </P>
    
    <P>Also there is a picture included of the audience from the con, which
      includes our very own Love-Hound Jorn Barger!!! I was sitting next to him,
      but that is where the picture is chopped! :-( </P>
