</P>
<P>Finally, unrelated to the above, but something interesting... I noticed
tonight  while listening to &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; that Kate Bush uses a
musical device which  Steve Howe also uses a lot, which I am very fond of. This
involves having the music  accompanying the voice part anticipate new themes
that appear in the voice;  specifically, just before &quot;Give me the Karma
Mama&quot;. She doesn't do this as  beautifully as Howe (for a really amazing
example, listen to &quot;The Revealing Science  of God&quot; on Tales From
Topographic Oceans, e.g., preceeding &quot;Talk to the sunlight,  caller; soft
summer-mover, distance, mine.&quot;). I wonder if there is a name for this? 
Usually in songs the voice part makes the first statement of new themes that
appear  in the middle of the song, I think. (Though I could be wrong).

</P>
<P>Welcome Carlo Samson, whose questions are all challenging and interesting: 
</P>
<P>&gt; 4.) Why is knowledge &quot;something sat in your lap&quot;? 
</P>
<P>It's not, but &quot;They say&quot; that it is. The song is more or less
about the character's  impatience with the difficulty of absorbing knowledge.
The expression &quot;to be sat in  (one's lap)&quot; is part of English ideom,
meaning &quot;to be sitting in&quot;. The distinction is a  subtle one created
by the shift from the active to the passive mode.

</P>
<P>IED recently said something to the effect that &quot;sat in your lap has
more than you  can comfortably absorb in three minutes&quot; in opposition to a
statement that ran  something like &quot;it was too short for three minutes...&quot;

</P>
<P>I would agree with the original poster - &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; could
run for 15  minutes, with 10 of those merely the drum track and it still
wouldn't be enough!  Maybe IED can live with three minutes as the perfect length
for covering the  profound statement Kate is making, and I would agree that &quot;Sat
In Your Lap&quot; as it is  is a striking piece of music, but one of these days
I'll get access to her master tapes  and make a recording of ten minutes of
those striking drums, which convey as much  of a message in themselves as the
rest of the tracks put together!

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: rhythm section of &quot;Sat
In Your Lap&quot; 
</P>
<P>To Jonathan Drukman: 
</P>
<P>It's very interesting that you suggest making a track of just the rhythm
section of  &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;. 
</P>
<P>First of all, let IED just say that he didn't mean to imply that &quot;Sat
In Your Lap&quot; --  or any other Kate Bush track, for that matter --wouldn't
be magnificent in an  extended form. In fact, IED has for several years been
making extended home mixes  of her records, and two of them are of &quot;Sat In
Your Lap&quot;. One was a forty-five  minute loop, alternating between the LP
and seven-inch mixes. The other,  interestingly enough, incorporated the solo
rhythm section of the record (about  which you fantasize) taken off the &quot;Looking
Good, Feeling Fit&quot; TV appearance by  Kate (UK TV), in which she was shown
dancing in a studio to the drum track  (without the other music). Of course, the
sound is absolutely terrible, but it still  sounds amazing. 
</P>
<P>IED's only objection earlier was to the idea that Kate's original was FLAWED
by  being compressed into three minutes and some odd seconds' length. It may be
more  satisfying to some listeners to hear a longer version, but that's their
affair, and has  nothing to do with the success of the original.

Lap
</P>
<P>All right, it's true, in between Colourbox fixes, I slapped on... (oh god,
can I  come out and say this in Public???) THE DREAMING!!! (Awk! Gag! It's the 
plumber - I've come to fix the sink....) Yes, I admit it. I was just curious to
know,  like, is it really the Greatest LP of All Time and I'm afraid the answer
is a  resounding YES!!! I think it was &quot;get out of my house&quot; in a
darkened room played at  mega volume that did it. Those guitars! Those donkey
brays! The drum-talk! Kate's  screaming her goddamm lungs out! And, hey, when I
heard the title track, I didn't  even THINK of &quot;Hammerheads&quot; by
Danielle Dax! (Which all Love-Hounds must  know uses the rhythm track from &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; sped up). 
</P>
<P>Then I whipped out my sampler cartridge, took a snapshot of the beginning of
 &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;, set some loop points and let the drums POUND POUND
POUND  until I just couldn't take it no more. The most intense five seconds in
pop music  history infinitely repeating IN MY BEDROOM! And by the way, after
re-reading  |&gt;oug's interview with Kate concerning donkeys and feet
representing sexual organs  and all that, I must conclude that the big Mr.
Moderator is totally correct about  everything.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: drums at the beginning 
</P>
<P> &gt; Subject: drums 
</P>
<P>&gt; Jon and I are having a bet: Are the drums at the beginning of sat in
your lap  sequenced or programmed or drum-machined (non-human) OR are they done
by a  real drummer? 
</P>
<P>It'll be hard to divvy up on the bet. In a way, you're both right. Since
Kate said  that the &quot;demos&quot; were more or less retained in all ten of
the tracks on The  Dreaming (though not so completely as on HoL ), it's safe to
assume that at least a  tiny bit of the original Roland sound still exists in
the final mix (especially perhaps  the single mix, which has an earlier date
than the LP mix). But she says that she  eventually &quot;replaced&quot; the
rhythm-box with a real drum sound. Also, of course, we  have to remember that
Kate never explains the real details of her technical methods.  IED doesn't
think he's ever read or heard a complete and satisfying explanation by  Kate of
the recording process of any of her music to date. In the interests of 
accuracy, here is Kate's own commentary: 
</P>
<P> Sat In Your Lap 
</P>
<P>I already had the piano patterns, but they didn't turn into a song until the
night  after I'd been to see a Stevie Wonder gig. Inspired by the feeling of his
music, I set  a rhythm on the Roland and worked in the piano riff to the
high-hat and snare. I  now had a verse and a tune to go over it but only a few
lyrics like 
</P>
<P>&quot;I see the people working,&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I want to be a lawyer,&quot; and 
</P>
<P>&quot;I want to be a scholar,&quot; 
</P>
<P>so the rest of the lyrics became &quot;na-na-na&quot; or words that happened
to come into  my head. I had some chords for the chorus with the idea of a vocal
being ad-libbed  later. The rhythm box and piano were put down, and then we
recorded the backing  vocals &quot;Some say that knowledge is...&quot; Next we
put down the lead vocal in the  verses and spent a few minutes getting some
lines worked out before recording the  chorus voice. I saw this vocal being sung
from high on a hill on a windy day. The fool  on the hill, the king of the
castle... &quot;I must admit, just when I think I'm king.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The idea of the demos was to try and put everything down as quickly as
possible.  Next came the brass. The CS80 is still my favourite synthesizer next
to the Fairlight,  and as it was all that was available at the time, I started
to find a brass sound. In  minutes I found a brass section starting to happen,
and I worked out an  arrangement. We put the brass down and we were ready to mix
the demo. 
</P>
<P>I was never to get that CS80 brass to sound the same again--it's always the
way.  At The Townhouse the same approach was taken to record the master of the
track.  We put down a track of the rhythm box to be replaced by drums, recording
the  piano at the same time. 
</P>
<P>As I was producing, I would ask the engineer to put the piano sound on tape
so I  could refer to that for required changes. 
</P>
<P>This was the quickest of all the tracks to be completed, and was also one of
the  few songs to remain contained on one twenty-four track tape instead of two!

(Jonathan S. Drukman) <BR> Subject: SIYL drums 
</P>
<P>Regarding the SIYL drum track, the basic debate that Damian and I are having
is:  are the huge pounding drum sounds we hear produced by a real person really 
hitting huge drums with real sticks, or are they sampled sounds being played via
the  Fairlight? I'm fairly sure its the former. There may be vestigial traces of
the Roland  tinkle-bonk in there somewhere, but those are not the focus of our
interest. Thanks  for your comments, however. Jon Drukman

stupid three four dumb) <BR> Subject: Re: Sat In Your Lap - revisited 
</P>
<P>This is one of my all time favorite KT songs, but I still don't profess to
have any  absolute definition for the lyrics. I think it's about bogus
spirituality and the futility  of attempting to achieve anything worthwhile
without great personal effort/sacrifice.  &quot;I want to be a scholar, but I
really can't be bothered.&quot; You see? The speaker  desires something
(knowledge) but won't work for it. Thus, &quot;some say that  knowledge is
something sat in your lap.&quot; She hopes it will just come to her without  any
effort. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've been doing it for years, my goal is moving near <BR> It says
'look i'm over here' then it up and disappears.&quot; 
</P>
<P>She keeps thinking she's close to the end of her quest, but she'll never get
to the  end because she can't make the effort. The deception is her fault. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In my dome of ivory; a home of activity <BR> I want the answers
quickly, but I don't have no energy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This should be pretty clear, if you subscribe to the rest of my theory. She
won't  exert herself, and thus will never get anywhere. Kate said that she
wanted the song  to sound like someone on top of a windy hill - the fool on the
hill, shouting into the  wind, feeling self-pity without good reason. 
</P>
<P>It's actually a kind of negative song, probably why I like it so much. Also,
I can  relate to the narrator - I want the answers quickly, but I don't have no
energy!!  (note the incorrect grammar - this is a brilliant stroke on Kate's
part, showing the  false learning which the narrator is stuck with... i'm in
awe...)

18:20:28 EST <BR> Subject: Re: Sat In Your Lap - revisited 
</P>
<P>I think that Jon's comments on &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; are all good. I
think that there  is also a more metaphysical component to them. 
</P>
<P>Some say knowledge is something sat in your lap <BR> Some say that
knowledge is something that you never have 
</P>
<P>This refers, of course, to the millenia-old philosophical debate on just
what  knowledge is. Some philosophers think that you can't really know anything
at all.  Some philosophers think that every human is a well-spring of knowledge.

</P>
<P>Just when I think I'm king, I must admit (I just begin) 
</P>
<P>Kate wants knowledge, and she works for it. She works to climb to the top of
an  intellectual mountain, but when she gets there, she finds that there's an
even taller  mountain behind it. 
</P>
<P>I've been doing it for years, my goal is moving near <BR> It says &quot;Look
I'm over here&quot; then it up and disappears 
</P>
<P>Kate works hard to achieve something and finally when she's learned enough
to  do it, she finally knows enough to see that this goal is not the one she
really wanted.  But to achieve what she really wants, she will have to start
from the beginning again. 
</P>
<P>I hold a cup of wisdom, but there is nothing within. 
</P>
<P>When Kate was younger and more naive, she looked up to people with more 
knowledge than her -- thinking of them as wiser. Now that she's learned what
they  know, but she feels no wiser than before. All this knowledge has done her
no good. 
</P>
<P>I think that it is this pattern of becoming disillusioned through gaining
knowledge  - of climbing mountains only to find even taller mountains - that has
made the  character in the song lazy: 
</P>
<P>I see the people working and see it working for them, <BR> And so I want to
join in, but then I find it hurts me.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Sat In Your Lap 
</P>
<P>&gt; What the heck is &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; about? 
</P>
<P>The song is about &quot;the search for knowledge&quot;. Kate has also said
it's about &quot;really  the lack of knowledge&quot;. And she has also said that
it deals with laziness, the wish  that one could acquire knowledge without going
through the effort of learning.  You're right, though, that she has never
written about the song's meaning in any of  her own published articles; all we
know about the song comes from her comments  in interviews. With one exception:
she did say this about the line, 
</P>
<P>&quot;Just when I think I'm King&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I saw this vocal being sung from high on a hill on a windy day. The
fool on the  hill, the king of the castle...'I must admit, just when I think I'm
king.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>As to whether there is a specific, narrative context for Sat In Your Lap,
IED  doesn't believe there is. Kate has remarked on the difficulty she had
coming up  with suitable video imagery for the song, because SIYL didn't have an
actual  storyline. As a result, it didn't lend itself to the kind of linear,
cinematic approach  Kate obviously favours for videos. Instead, she just &quot;threw
together lots of images of  knowledge, or the lack of knowledge,&quot; and
decided to make the video &quot;silly&quot; and  &quot;just fun, really.&quot;

</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; As an aside: could someone please explain what &quot;sat in your
lap&quot; means? I  suppose it's some kind of English saying. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Don't know much about English sayings, but form teh context of the
song,  &quot;Some say that knowledge is something that's sat in your lap / Some
say that  knowledge is something that you never have,&quot; I'd say that &quot;Sat
in Your Lap&quot; is akin  to the saying &quot;Handed to you on a silver
platter.&quot; In other words, something &quot;Sat in  Your Lap&quot; is given
to you without you having to expend any effort on it. 
</P>
<P>There's a German saying &quot;in den Schoss gelegt&quot; which is basically
an exact  word-by-word translation of &quot;sat in your lap&quot;, and indeed it
means you got it by  heritage, instinct or any other method that doesn't need
any efforts.
