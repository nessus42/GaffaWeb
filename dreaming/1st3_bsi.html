    <P> &quot;December will be magic again. Take a Husky to the ice while Bing
      Crosby sings 'White Christmas' -- he makes you feel nice. December will be
      magic again...Old Saint Nicholas up the chimney, just popping up in my
      memory...Dropping down in my parachute (the white city, she looks so
      beautiful!), up on the black-soot-icicled roofs...Oh! And see how I fall,
      see how I fall, like the snow, come to cover the lovers (Don't you wake
      them up!), come to sparkle the dark up, come to cover the muck up with
      just a touch of make-up (with a little luck). See how I fall... </P>
    
    <P>&quot;December will be magic again. Light up the candlelights to conjure
      Mr. Wilde into the silent night. (Ooh! It's quiet inside, here in Oscar's
      mind!) December will be magic again. Don't miss the brightest star, kiss
      under mistletoe...I want to hear you laugh --Don't let the mystery go now!
      &quot;December will be magic again...&quot;</P>
    
    <P> Season's greetings from IED. Remember, even if you didn't get any
      presents at all this Christmas, you've still got Kate. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: The December CD </P>
    
    <P>IED has finally got hold of a copy of EMI's It's Christmas CD, which
      includes Kate's December Will Be Magic Again, available for the first time
      on compact disk. </P>
    
    <P>The earlier reports were indeed correct: this is not the well known
      version of the song which Kate released as a single in 1980 (with the
      b-side Warm and Soothing ). Rather, it is an alternate recording which
      Kate made approximately one year earlier. </P>
    
    <P>The version heard on the new CD was recorded in 1979, and was formerly
      known to the public only through a &quot;hastily filmed&quot; video
      performance given by Kate on a BBC music special hosted by Abba and called
      The Winter Snowtime Special. That programme aired on December 21, 1979.
      The recording was ready in time for a video airing, but not in time for a
      Christmas-single release that year. In fact, it very nearly wasn't ready
      the next Christmas, either, because by that time Kate had decided it
      needed a completely different treatment with a heavy rock beat. </P>
    
    <P>The CD version is the second of three arrangements of the song--the
      first, featuring Kate on piano with Kevin McAlea on electric piano, was
      heard on Kate's own Christmas special, Kate, which aired one week after
      the Snowtime version (December 28, '79), but which was probably taped
      sometime during the preceding autumn. (The contrast in style is not
      limited to the musical arrangements: Kate's two nearly contemporaneous
      video performances are very different: on Snowtime she moves and projects
      extravagantly during every note, really pushing the song's theme of
      childhood wonder. On her own television special, however, her manner is
      much more subdued--perhaps a result of the natural constraint imposed by
      simultaneous singing and piano-playing. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, here, completely without warning or explanation, is a brilliant
      CD transfer of the Winter Snowtime version of December, complete with that
      inimitable combination of Moog synthesizers and Christmas bongo drums.
      What's most interesting to IED, hearing the recording for the first time
      in high-quality audio, is the discovery that the &quot;bongos&quot;
      version is actually a fully realized, even ambitious production, rich with
      parallel melodies, multiple backing vocals, subtle reverbs, sleigh-bells
      and surprising counter-rhythms. </P>
    
    <P>This CD is well worth the money. Even the additional presence of
      Christmas singles by &quot;Slade&quot;, &quot;Shakin' Stevens&quot;, &quot;Aled
      Jones&quot; and others cannot dim the sparkle of this rare Bushohistorical
      treasure. Recommended. </P>

      <BR> Subject: December is a Lond Way Off... </P>
    
    <P>There was an enquiry about a version of &quot;December Will Be Magic
      Again&quot; described as the one from the Xmas Special. In fact, there are
      two entirely different versions of &quot;December...&quot; that could be
      described as the &quot;Xmas Special&quot; version. &quot;Kate&quot; was
      the actual title of a 48-minute TV show (aired shortly before Xmas '79 and
      thus frequently called the &quot;Xmas Special&quot;, though it was taped
      in October '79), and on this show Kate performed a version of the song at
      the piano, accompanied by Kevin McAlea (?) at the electric piano. About
      the same time an Abba Xmas special appeared on UKTV, and this is the show
      on which Kate performed the &quot;bongos&quot; version. The latter, as
      Sakari says, is available on a legitimate EMI compilation CD. The former
      was never released, and can only be heard (on vinyl, CD, cassette, video)
      in dubs from the TV show. Neither of these versions, of course, is like
      the official EMI single release, which is available as part of the &quot;This
      Woman's Work&quot; box set. </P>

    <P>A little something I noticed while watching Kate performing &quot;December
      Will Be Magic Again&quot; on the Love-Hounds tape: she sings &quot;Come to
      carpet the lovers&quot; in that version, whereas everywhere else I've come
      across only &quot;Come to cover the lovers&quot;. Why the difference? And
      why the different tune? When was the inferior D, D, up an octave &amp; F
      replaced by the much better D, C,F, D, B flat, F? </P>

      <BR> Subject: DWBMA - versions </P>
    
    <P>&gt; On a compilation CD of Christmas songs the name of which escapes me
      at the moment, appears Kate's December Will Be Magic Again. However, it is
      a very different arrangement to the 7&quot; single version. Why is there
      another version of the song on this compilation and why did Kate record
      two versions. I have never seen mention of the two arrangements
      anywhere... </P>
    
    <P>They have been discussed in this forum several times, and there is some
      talk of their differences in The Garden and in Homeground issues past. The
      name of the CD is &quot;It's Christmas!&quot;. It was an EMI release. Only
      the first edition of the CD contains the rare &quot;alternative&quot;
      version of the track you mention. The &quot;mistake&quot; was discovered
      eventually, and the word is that more recent editions of the CD feature
      the familiar single-mix of the song. </P>
    
    <P>The alternative version actually predates the single version. It was
      recorded by Kate for a video performance (isn't it included in the
      Love-Hounds Collection?) from 1979 called &quot;Abba's Winter Snowtime
      Special&quot;. It's sometimes referred to as the &quot;bongos&quot;
      version. There is a still earlier version of &quot;December...&quot;,
      featuring Kate at the piano, from &quot;Kate&quot;, the so-called
      Christmas special (taped in October 1979). </P>
