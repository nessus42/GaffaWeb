Subject: Track listing
</P>
<P>Direct from England! Here is the full track listing of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
 (scheduled for September 13th release in the U.S.): 
</P>
<P>Side 1 (Hounds of Love): 
</P>
<P>Running Up That Hill <BR> Hounds of Love <BR> The Big Sky <BR> Mother
Stands For Comfort <BR> Cloudbusting 
</P>
<P>Side 2 (The Ninth Wave) 
</P>
<P>And Dream of Sheep <BR> Under Ice <BR> Waking The Witch <BR> Watching You
Without Me <BR> Jig of Life <BR> Hello Earth <BR> The Morning Fog 
</P>
<P>There will be a massive push by EMI (in England) including TV ads. The
cassette  (I hope this means the CD, too!) will include at least one extra
track. 
</P>
<P>I mentioned in a previous note, that a friend who is visiting England saw
Kate  Bush publicity posters that said &quot;That Big Hill&quot;. Maybe they
really said &quot;The Big  Sky&quot;? Maybe that's the next single? Maybe that
was originally planned as the single?  Just idle speculation.... 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is thunder in our hearts&quot;

Subject: The Holy Grail 
</P>
<P>According to the radio show Rock Over London, the B-side to &quot;Hounds of
Love&quot;,  &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, was inspired by the poem &quot;The Holy
Grail&quot; by William Loyd  Tennison. Does anyone know anything about this
poem?

Subject: &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; at number one! 
</P>
<P>I just posted this to net.music: 
</P>
<P>Hi here! 
</P>
<P>The following appeared in one of Daily papers here: 
</P>
<P>Date: 26 sept 
</P>
<P>CONGRATULATIONS... 
</P>
<P>...to sultry Kate Bush whose comeback album *Hounds of Love*, has shot
straight  into the charts at No.1. 
</P>
<P>If you havent heard it yet, rush out and buy a copy... Its by far the
*classiest*  album of the year so far. 
</P>
<P>That's right, KB's new album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; has *entered* the
British charts  at NUMBER ONE, knocking Madonna (insert many side remarks here)
out of that  position, which she only held for one week with &quot;Like
Perversion&quot;. 
</P>
<P>This is the second time that Kate Bush has had an album enter at number one.
 Five years ago, &quot;Never for Ever&quot; also entered the British charts at
number one. At  that time she was the only woman ever to have a number one album
in England. 
</P>
<P>In any case, I guess it just goes to show, that every now and then quality
does  prevail. Too bad it happens so rarely. 
</P>
<P> &quot;Now is the place where the crossroads meet <BR> Will you look into
the future&quot;

<BR> Subject: Did you like HoL first time through? 
</P>
<P>There seems to be a general concensus among Kate Bush fans that: 
</P>
<P>1) We didn't like &quot;The Dreaming&quot; the first time we heard it; in
fact, it took  several plays before we even liked it at all. But now, we think
it's (one of) the best  album(s) ever made. The delayed appeal is one of the
things, or a side effect of the  things that make it so great. 
</P>
<P>2) We thought the &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; album was great the first time
we heard it.  Overall, it's probably not as good as &quot;The Dreaming&quot;,
but &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; is at  least in the same class as &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;, and we realized that the first time we  heard it. 
</P>
<P>My question is, &quot;does this mean anything?&quot; &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;
is the first Kate  Bush album that I liked all the way through the first time I
heard it. Is that because  it's shallower and simpler than her previous work,
and therefore is easier to like at  first but will probably be less rewarding in
the long run? Or is it just because I've  finally become accustomed to her
weirdness, so when I hear something like &quot;The  Ninth Wave&quot; for the
first time, it doesn't shock me into thinking it's noise now but  it probably
would have 3 1/2 years ago? I think it's the latter because, although I  may get
tired of the &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; side, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; sounds
like  something I'll love forever. However, I have another theory. Maybe she has
taken  the interesting, rewarding, layered complexity of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;,
and improved it  by adding another ingredient, an ingredient that makes it more
likeable on the first  listen. 
</P>
<P>What do the rest of you think? Are there any KB fans who didn't like &quot;The
 Ninth Wave&quot; the first time? What do people that haven't heard her other
work  think of the new album?

Subject: Cloudbusting 12 inch single! 
</P>
<P>I just picked up Kate's new &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; 12-inch single. The
cover is  wonderful! It's a solarized picture of Kate in the role of Peter Reich
as a kid at the  controls of this *huge* cloudbuster. On the back cover is the
caption &quot;We're  cloudbusting, Daddy&quot;. (I wonder if she's wearing a
wig, or if she really cut off most  of her hair for the role....) 
</P>
<P>The A-side contains &quot;Cloudbusting -- The Organon Re-mix&quot;. It's
very different  from what's on the album. It's very extended and has new
material. It's better than  the album version, though many of the lyrics are
missing. 
</P>
<P>The B-side contains two songs. &quot;Burning Bridge&quot; is a song in some
ways similar in  style to the songs on the A-side of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;.
It has a heavy rhythm and  at-first-seemingly-happy background vocals, but
Kate's lead singing is quite  disturbed and unusual. It somehow sounds both
pretty commercial and pretty  uncommercial at the same time. It's quite good,
but I haven't listened to it enough  yet to determine just how much I like it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My Lagan Love&quot; is a traditional song and is sung solo a cappella.
(Be still my  beating heart!) It's as beautiful as you could possibly imagine. 
</P>
<P>Think I'll go listen to it again. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Our thumping hearts hold the Ravens in&quot;

Subject: Letter to New York Times 
</P>
<P>This is a letter I just put in the mail.... 
</P>
<P>22 October 1985 <BR> Doug Alan <BR> 260 Sidney Street, Apt. 1 <BR>
Cambridge, MA 02139 
</P>
<P>Dear Mr. John Rockwell: 
</P>
<P>I enjoyed your review of Kate Bush's &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and Jane
Siberry's &quot;No  Borders Here&quot;. You should know, however, that the
devotion of Kate Bush fans (like  me) is legendary and one who says that Kate's
lyrics are &quot;pretentious, vague and  rambling&quot; in print is seriously
risking his life. I find them wonderful, complex,  meaningful, deep, powerful,
and fascinating. They are packed with emotion,  intelligence, metaphor,
symbolism -- everything that one could want -- no one's  lyrics are better! 
</P>
<P>You are right, however, about her music. 
</P>
<P>Also, you say that her video for &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is &quot;oddly
unimaginative&quot;.  To say this is to say &quot;I have not seen the video&quot;.
Perhaps you have seen what they are  showing on Empty-V? That is not Kate's
video -- that is a clip from a live  appearance on the Terry Wogan show. Kate's
video is so unusual that Empty-V  refuses to show it. If you live in the New
York area, perhaps you should be watching  U68 instead. 
</P>
<P>Kate's video is a largely a work of modern ballet and is very beautiful and
highly  symbolic. For example, when Kate sings &quot;Is there so much hate for
the ones we  love?&quot;, Kate and the male dancer become symbolically crucified
on each other. At  the end of the video, Kate drowns in a crowd of Kate Bush's
-- symbolizing how we  are forever trapped within ourselves. It is a
masterpiece! 
</P>
<P>Doug Alan 
</P>
<P>P.S. I also would rather not see any more less than complementary comments
on  Suzanne Vega! 
</P>
<P>P.P.S. You could have selected a more dignified photo of Kate. Everyone
makes a  mistake every now and then, and that outfit was one of Kate's....

Subject: German verison of Ruth? 
</P>
<P>I sent a letter off to the Kate Bush Club asking where I could get a copy of
the  German version of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. I got a letter back
from Lisa, Kate's  best friend and the person in charge of answering letters to
the club. She said that  there is no German version of RUTH. So, now I don't
know who's lying to me. The  two friends who said they heard it in German while
in Germany (they wouldn't be  mistaken because one of them is a big fan, and
they hadn't heard the song before --  they recognized it as Kate by her voice),
or Lisa. I guess this means that if there *is*  a German version, then it is
just a demo tape that Kate gave to a radio station. She  has done this before.
There are songs which she's given to radio stations, but which  aren't on any
record. Argh! How can one continue life with such knowledge? 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I only could, I'd make a deal with God&quot;

</P>
<P>BUT she didn't win any of them, (i'm not surprised, she's much too 
independant for this sort of award) For a concilation prise she did get to ding
the  new single HOUNDS OF LOVE so at least that should boost the sales.

Subject: British Music Industry Awards and Kate 
</P>
<P>I caught the British Music Industry Awards on TV last Friday. (See, I didn't
miss  it, Tim! &quot;England's newest pop star&quot;???? &quot;England's newest
pop star&quot;??? &quot;England's  newest...&quot;??? ...) In any case, for
those who missed it, you didn't miss much. Most  of it was a complete farce. The
highlight of the night came when the award for &quot;Best  International Group&quot;
was presented. Among those nominated were The Talking  Heads and Hewey, Dewey,
Lewey, and The News. Needless to say Hewey, baby, won.  And later this beautiful
human being came out to give this wonderful speech about  how the music industry
is so competitive these days, and how this is such a  wonderful thing for
everyone. Sign me up on the ideology! I wanna be a record  company executive
now. 
</P>
<P>In any kase, Kate was nominated for three awards, Best Album, Best Single,
and  Best Female Artist. She lost all three. Best Album was won by Fill Colon
for &quot;Faith  Valueless&quot;. Best Single was won by Spears for Queers for &quot;Everybody
Wants To Rule  The Whirlpool Refrigerator&quot;. And Best Female Artist was won
by Annie Eunuchs. 
</P>
<P>There were pseudo-live (lip-synched) performances by Fill Colon, Spears for 
Queers, Hewey, and Kate Bush, among others, who I've probably forgotten. It's 
good to see Kate thrown in among so much talent in front of 100 million viewers.

</P>
<P>Kate performed &quot;Dogs of Lust&quot;. The lighting and the eclecticness
of the band and  the clothes the band members wore were quite impressive. There
were Kate, two  cello players (one of them Paddy), a keyboardist (Del Palmer),
and three (yes, that's  right -- *three*) drummers. The drummer in the middle
played sampled electronic  drums (he was dressed rather formally and acted very
mechanical and precise, as if  playing the part of a human drum machine) and the
other two drummers played  normal acoustic drum sets. 
</P>
<P>Still, it was a bit disappointing because Kate basically just stood there
and sang (or  pretended to sing, rather). I've also seen live appearances for
RuTH and  Cloudbusting, and in neither of these did Kate do the strange dancing
she is famous  for. Kate's dancing and choreography ability for live appearances
reached a peak  after &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. Once she appeared on the Italian
equivalent of &quot;Solid Gold&quot;  and had to perform the song &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; on a transparent disco stage with  rotating and flashing lights
-- but the stunning power and quality of her bizzare  dance for this song is so
amazing that the video clip is a classic just for the  superposition of such
class and such tackiness. And the dance routine she did for live  appearances of
&quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot; is bizzare, cute, and wonderfully charming. 
</P>
<P>In videos, her dance skills reached a peak in the video for &quot;Running Up
That  Hill&quot;, which is beautiful and wrenchingly poignant. But the dancing
disappeared for  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and in her recent live appearances.
It's almost as if she's saying &quot;I  achieved my goals in dancing -- my live
appearances for 'The Dreaming' and the  video for RuTH are the conclusion of
what I have to say in that area, and now it's  time for me to go on to something
different.&quot; On the other hand, maybe in her old  age, she's just become
more self-conscious about appearing foolish with dancing,  because she's not a
professional dancer, and wants to appear more in total control  and be the
target of less ridicule for her &quot;poncy&quot; dancing. She certainly appears
 more &quot;impressive&quot; and mature recently, but it this necessarily a good
thing? What  happened to the youthful spunk and naivity? Is this what three
years can do to you?  Don't grow old too quick, Kate! (&quot;Stay young. And
keep in touch.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Then again, Kate risking appearing silly by playing a little boy in the  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
video helps restore my faith. (Hear that Hofmann!) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Moving stranger, does it really matter? As long as you're not afraid
to feel&quot; 
</P>
<P>Doug 
</P>
<P>P.S. Newsflash: The U.S. 7&quot; single for &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;
appeared in the record  stores around here today. And the British single for &quot;Hounds
Of Love&quot; was released  on Monday. Unlike in the U.S., release dates in
England are when you can actually  buy the record in the stores, so better
import record stores should be getting the  import by Friday. 
</P>
<P>The British single has a new song on it -- an a cappella cover of &quot;The
Handsome  Cabin Boy&quot;. (Wasn't this done by Bert Loyd and Ewan MacColl? Or
am I totally off  the wall?) The 12&quot; single will also have &quot;Jig Of
Life&quot; on it. The U.S. single has  &quot;Burning Bridge&quot; on it.

they got it  right the 2nd time.

<P>The award for best female artist went to Annie Lennox.

<P>Also, it's just possible that Kate might not have been lip-sync -- she had a

</P>
<P>KATE BUSH releases the title track from her 'Hounds of Love' LP as her new 
EMI single next Monday, coupled with the traditional and unaccompanied 'The 
Handsome Cabin Boy'. She's recorded a completely new vocal for the 12&quot;
extended  version, which is called 'Alternative Hounds of Love', and this also
has the bonus of  'Jig of Life'. And to complete the action, Kate has directed
her own video of the  single.

<P>On the subject of the BMI awards... 
</P>
<P>I got my brother to tape it, and when watching it later, I fast-forwarded
through  *everything* except Kate Bush. What a junky show. Not quite as bad as
the  Grammys, but pretty close (at least Kenny Rogers didn't host BMI). 
</P>
<P>Kate looked bored as hell, and like she wasn't having much fun. I think she
was  lip-syncing, cuz otherwise the song would have sounded like shit (no
excitement or  effort on her part). She also looked pretty awful --someone put
about an inch of  makeup on her. 
</P>
<P>Note that I'm not cutting down Kate, because I'm sure that it wasn't all her
 idea. Just that I wasn't very impressed, and I'm pissed that I had to sit there
for an  hour fast-forwarding thru the shit to get to her. Oh well. Such is life,
and TV, and  business, and...

<P>Issue 22 of &quot;HOMEGROUND -- The International KATE BUSH Fanzine&quot;
has just  arrived in my mailbox, and they've gone glossy (to compete with &quot;Under
The Ivy&quot;, I  suppose). The late-breaking Kate news is: 
</P>
<P>-- Kate has been working with Peter Gabriel on his new album. There will be
a  new duet (their version of &quot;Another Day&quot; has never appeared on a
non-bootleg  album), and it is planned that it will be released as a single. 
</P>
<P>-- Kate has shelved the &quot;Ninth Wave&quot; film, and has decided to
instead work on  her next album after finishing her current projects. 
</P>
<P>-- Three books of photographs of Kate taken by John Bush are due for 
publication within the next few months. These are of Kate as a child, a
teenager, and  as a famous person, and will contain 'biographical' captions. 
</P>
<P>-- Kate has been nominated for two of the prestigious &quot;Novello&quot;
awards for  songwriters. The nominations are Best Song for RUTH and Best Lyric
for  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. 
</P>
<P>-- The next single will be &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. Kate will be shooting
the video soon  and the single is scheduled for release at the end of May or the
beginning of June.

<P>At this point, A. Marvick is resigned to the apparent failure of the U.S.
follow-up  single &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. The seven-inch version has been
widely available for more  than three weeks now, yet it is still unlisted in
either the Billboard or the more  optimistic Cashbox Top 100 charts; as a
result, MTV have absolutely no intention of  even considering air-time for the
film. Furthermore, it is not listed by any of the  playlists recently published
in Billboard, nor is it on any dj's &quot;bubbling under&quot; lists  or &quot;pick&quot;
lists. Perhaps in reaction to this indifference to the single, EMI seem to  have
scratched plans (if such plans ever existed) to release the twelve-inch version 
domestically; and there has been no visible promotion for the single. 
</P>
<P>If anyone out there among the lion/love-hearts/hounds is more optimistic in
the  face of the above barrage of bad news, let him/her speak soon. My
explanation for  this apparent failure is two-fold: first, it is possible, even
in the snail-paced Stateside  music business, to let too much time pass between
the release of an album's first  single and its follow-up, and this, due to the
delay in delivering the promotional film  for &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, may
have been the case here; second, there is fiercer  competition from the hordes
of &quot;seasoned American pop artists&quot; now than there may  have been last
summer/fall. 
</P>
<P>My suggestion is, for those devoted Kate fans who just spent hours trying to
 request the &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; film from MTV, that they schedule another
dial-a-thon  to that infamous corporation, but with the new U.S. single in mind,
not a  Europe-only release like &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. A similar project
might be undertaken  with EMI-America as the target, with the aim of encouraging
the release of a  twelve-inch, now that the seven-inch of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
has had time to sow the  seeds of interest among the poor benighted,
swindled-of-music American people.  Waiting to hear any comments from l/l-h/h's
nation-wide...

<P>I called up EMI-America today. The person at EMI-America Publicity in NY
said  &quot;There are no plans to release any more singles from that album&quot;.
The person at  EMI-America Marketing (for &quot;alternative&quot; marketing&quot;)
in CA said, &quot;Yes, 'The Big  Sky' will be a single, and there's a video!
I'll send you a copy.&quot;

<P>The guys at &quot;alternative marketing&quot; usually don't seem really know

Subject: KB news: The Big Sky
</P>
<P>I went away for the weekend, and when I came back there was an incredible 
amount of international mail in my mailbox. The latest of Kate's semiannual 
newsletters was there. A newsflash from *Homeground* was there. And a pile of 
poetry by John Carder Bush was there. 
</P>
<P>The *Homeground* newsflash: 
</P>
<P>The Big Sky 
</P>
<P>Kate's next single THE BIG SKY will be in the shops on the 28th April. The 7&quot;
 (KB4) will have a remix of THE BIG SKY for the A-side, and a new song NOT  THIS
TIME on the B-side. The 12&quot; (12KB4) will feature a *ten minute* remix of 
THE BIG SKY plus NOT THIS TIME and THE MORNING FOG. 
</P>
<P>It's now up to all of us to push this single into the Top Ten, so get to
work --  HUP HUP!! 
</P>
<P>Kate says in her newsletter: 
</P>
<P>The visits to America and Canada were lots of fun, everyone seemed so
positive  about this album -- it is so nice to think people in different parts
of the world are  listening to ideas you might have had in the bath! 
</P>
<P>The difference in the attitudes of the journalists was very apparent -- a
lot of the  interviews were conversational and their enthusiasm, endless. We did
one in-store  appearance in New York and it was a very moving experience. There
were so many  people there that they went around the corner of the street,
everyone was so  considerate and well behaved that even the New York police
commented on how  unusual this was. It was wonderful to meet you all and we were
very taken by  warmth and all the presents you gave -- thank you.

</P>
<P>Incidentally, during my final visit to London in March of this year, Kate 
performed a lip-synch of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; on TOTP, with the same three
 drum-kits and two celli used at the BPI awards, but without the 31 Steps
film-star  type and dressed in a restrained business pants suit, not noticeably
forties-era in  style.
</P>
<P>Other news: the May 2 issue of Billboard came on the stands today, and
Kate's LP  was not in the top 200 for the first time since its release;
curiously, it was #200 two  weeks ago, then went back up to #196, I think,
perhaps a faint transfusion of energy  from the &quot;Hounds&quot; single; but
it's seen its last legs on the charts, I'm afraid. 27  weeks in Billboard. 30
weeks in Cashbox now, and still only down to #167 there.  Who really knows which
is more accurate, anyway? The one thing I'd really like to  know is what these
rankings signify in terms of sales figures, but no-one ever  mentions the
subject in Billboard unless a record makes gold or platinum. I would  have
thought 27 weeks in the top 200 in the U.S. would be more than enough to go 
gold, but I guess not. Meanwhile, all the weeks in the UK charts since November
15  (when the platinum record was issued) have racked up insufficient sales to
merit a  second platinum, despite the amazing resurgence following the release
of the  &quot;Hounds&quot; single (it got up to #4 in some charts).

<P>Mainly to Doug in re KT video trade: I haven't heard from you about my 
explanation of my KT video collection. I think it's possible I forgot to send it
to you  after writing it. This computer stuff is really messing me up. If
interested in  complete list, let me know. An edited version of the message
follows this one, just in  case. 
</P>
<P>I have &quot;The Big Sky&quot; Meteorological Mix in front of me --haven't
listened to it  yet, but my whole week has just been made. This record feels to
me like the  cornerstone of the album -- eight months after the release of &quot;RUTH&quot;,
we have  finally got the last track in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>This whole Kate Bush 12&quot; business is a great new aspect to her music, I
think,  since she doesn't just leave the re-mix to some Jellybean or other, but
ammends and  enriches the original herself, or with Del. The only thing like it
before Hounds of  Love was &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, and of course that bit of
video-tape of Kate rehearsing to an  instrumental of &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;.

<P>For those of you who haven't gotten around to reading the TV listings for
that  Kate Bush concert coming up this Saturday night (Sunday Morning
technically..)  here's the line up as I read it. It's on a show called 'Night
Flight' on the USA  Network. 
</P>
<P>12:30 'A video profile of Kate Bush.' Sounds like that lineup of videos
we've all  heard about recently. 
</P>
<P>1:00 'Footage of a 1979 Kate Bush concert.' 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>If you bothered to read on it repeats again at 4:30 and 5:00am respectively.
I know  *I* plan on tapeing this. Let's all pray for no interuptions by Captain
Midnight.

Subject: Japan. HoL CD
</P>
<P>A few brief notes: 
</P>
<P>Although I havn't had a chance to thoroughly compare them, the first
difference  I have noticed between the second Japanese pressing of the CD of &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot;  and the original British-released pressing is in the beginning of
&quot;Running up that  Hill.&quot; One things I've always noticed (and sort of
been bugged by) is how the  fairlight droning intro (when I listen on
headphones, or turn it up loudly) has a  &quot;break&quot; in it - so instead of
steadily fading in from nothing, it sort of fades in a bit,  and then suddenly
increases in volume, which was probably due to some sort of CD  mastering error.
(Perhaps the engineer sneezed while holding onto the fader....) 
</P>
<P>However, on the Japanese second pressing, they must have corrected it, 'cos
it  fades in evenly and slowly. (OK, flame at me for promoting KT trivia...)

<P>Meanwhile, EMI-America has finally released the 7&quot; &quot;Special Single

from their rotation lists. I  swear those EMI people are the biggest nudniks on

has passed into the  semi-finals for MTV's annual award for &quot;best video by

</P>
<P>&gt; This should make up for my little lapse, though, IED -- a brand-new
Kate  Kollectible is on the market. A CD single of &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot;
produced by good ol'  EMI America. There's only one li'l hitch --it's
promo-only. Which means that they  are scarce and expensive. Music Machine had a
copy which they wouldn't part with;  they'd only gotten a couple in and the
first one had immediately sold for $20. I told  them to pleeease hold one for me
if they got another one in, but they could make no  guarantees about their
availability. Some artifaKT, eh? 
</P>
<P>This is really an amazing co-incidence, Sue. Only LAST NIGHT IED got a call 
from a Missouri Kate-fan (and good friend), telling IED of the new limited
edition  promotional CD single of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. THIS GUY HAD JUST
GOT ONE FROM  MUSIC MACHINE YESTERDAY! He paid $20.00, just as you said. He must
have  been the person that you said they had sold one to! Anyway, IED called MM
at the  crack of dawn this morning, only to be told that he was too late, but
that they would  be trying to get more in. There are supposed to be only 1,000
of them. Anyway, since  this morning IED has made the complete rounds of every
record store in the L.A.  area asking about the damn thing, but no-body here had
seen or heard of one yet.  Darn it! If you find an extra one, could you PLEASE
let IED know?? He will forever  pledge his troth unto you, or whatever...

</P>
<P>Well, IED's not as mad as he was yesterday. He even answers the latest
question  to be asked and answered again (for about the fifth time). The reason
Terry Gilliam  is thanked in the liner-notes of Hounds of Love is because he
helped Kate work on  the storyboards for the Cloudbusting video and then, when
he couldn't continue,  helped Kate to get the right crew to work with. (The
video's director, Julian Doyle,  worked under Gilliam on Brazil, one of Kate's
favourite films.) Also, there are  references to Gilliam's films in her own
self-directed video The Big Sky. And she  also contracted Michael Kamen, now a
very busy and highly respected filmscore  composer but then virtually unused
except by Gilliam, to provide orchestral  arrangements on The Ninth Wave ; and
shortly after Brazil came out Kate was  invited to record her own version of the
old popular song Brazil for the soundtrack  album. That album was never
released, and Kate's version obviously doesn't appear  in the film itself, so
no-one has ever heard it, but it's another sign of the close ties  between Kate
and Gilliam.

</P>
<P>Vickie &amp; I and Frank Maiale met her plane (the Concorde) at Kennedy
Airport  when she came to the U.S. and Canada to promote HoL. 
</P>
<P>Kate and Del took a long time to get off the plane and through Customs. We
took  to joking about the other people getting off the plane &quot;oh there's
Kate, She's dyed  her hair black and gotten a foot taller!&quot; Al Pacino
walked past. (he was in the midst  of filming &quot;Revolution&quot; with Donald
Sutherland. Did he and Kate talk on the plane?)  Finally us and one other couple
were the only people waiting. We asked if they were  waiting for Kate. They
looked at us funny and moved away. Finally Kate and Del  came out. We talked for
a bit. I told them we drove from Kansas City, half-way  across the country, and
Del said &quot;what intrepid fans!&quot; Kate's honesty has been  batted around
on the net. Well, one thing that she very definitely lies about is her  height.
She is tiny. Very tiny. And she was wearing heels. 
</P>
<P>I gave her the most recent edit of &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot; and they got
into a grey limo  with the couple from EMI. We saw Kate and Del several times
later that week -  outside of radio stations and at the Tower Records signing.
We also talked to Cynthia  Freidland, the producer of &quot;Night Flight&quot;,
and she invited us to see the interview  being taped for &quot;NF&quot;, &quot;Radio
1990&quot; and &quot;Heartlight City&quot; at United Video. We sat on  a couch
at the back of the control room with Kate's brother John. The picture was 
astounding and the sound guys were total fools. Well, that's our tale. 
</P>
<P>She is a truly nice person. It is always a pleasant surprise when you meet 
someone you admire and find them friendly as well. I've been a big fan of Todd 
Rundgren for 16 years and on the &quot;30 second&quot; times I've met him I
haven't gotten a  civil word out of him yet. I still love his music and admire
him. Damm shame he's an  arrogant jerk, it really is.

<P>There was a little segment on Nigel Kennedy tonight on Much Music. He is 
playing with the Toronto Philharmonic Orchestra for a few nights I guess. I
couldn't  believe what a great violinist he is. I knew he was good, but I didn't
know that he  was THAT good! 
</P>
<P>He was on stage wearing a tatered black shirt, jeans, and a bandana (sp?).
They  showed a segment of Exp. IV, and then he commented on working with Kate.
He  said (I'm forgetting already) something to the effect that she was one of
best  composers around right now and that working with her was like having a jam
 session with Mozart or Bach! 
</P>
<P>He sang her praises a bit more and then there was more orchestra footage. 
Luckily the show is repeated so I will tape it when it rolls around again.
