      <BR> Subject: KT and Commodore </P>
    
    <P>Many MANY years ago when I first became interested in computers I went
      out and bought a Commodore VIC-20 computer, this guy of course had no disk
      drive but instead one of those tape recorders that you would pop a
      cassette in and wait 20 min for the program to load. One of the very first
      cassette I purchaced was program where you could type someones name and
      the computer would randomly insert the name into randomly selected
      sentences (well it was a big deal at the time;-). This program had some
      demo files so I ran them and it looked something like this: </P>
    
    <P>1. The queen has very small feet. </P>
    
    <P>2. The queen likes her tea. </P>
    
    <P>3. Kate Bush is a singer from England. </P>
    
    <P>4. Kate Bush is a very mysterious person! </P>
    
    <P>At this point in my life I thought for sure that there were only about 3
      KaTe fans in the US, it just cracked me up to see her name on the computer
      screen. Turns out the program was written in the UK. </P>

      <BR> Subject: A pointless little story </P>
    
    <P> Um, I have noticed that occasionally people will share some little
      story in which Kate's music made an impact on their lives, so I will share
      a recent one. </P>
    
    <P> Two nights ago, I ended up being left by two friends (who happened to
      be my ride home) at a bar. They left me in the company of someone who,
      shall we say, does not respect women very much, and apparently has never
      heard the word &quot;no.&quot; Anyway, I ended up basically hiding from
      this guy and taking a cab home, and my driver was this young college guy.
      I was in the backseat, pretty upset, when he asked if I minded if he
      played a music. I said no, and he popped in a tape of Hounds of Love. So,
      I rode home listening to Kate sing &quot;Running Up that Hill.&quot; I
      have heard it countless times before, but I felt like I was hearing it for
      the first time. And it just goes to show you: she may not tour, but when
      you need her, she's there. </P>

      <BR> Subject: KT Recipe! </P>
    
    <P> This might be old news, but I found the recipes for KT's favourite meal
      in Delia Smith's book. As we all know Kate's a vegetarian, and apparently
      her sister-in-law Judith created these recipes especially for her. So now
      we can all cook KT Special for dinner.... </P>

<PRE>
</PRE>
    
    <P> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sauteed Mixed Vegetables (serves four):- </P>
    
    <P>Soften 8oz onions in a heavy pan for two minutes, then add 6oz of
      chopped carrots for another two mins, then add 8oz mushrooms, 6oz green
      peppers chopped and 12oz ripe tomatos quartered. Then add 2.5 tablespoons
      of sunflower seed oil and some salt and freshly ground pepper, turn the
      heat down low, put a lid on and let the vegetables steam in their own heat
      for 20-25 minutes. You can also add some curry spices or chilli at this
      point if you're feeling experimental.... </P>
    
    <P> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cucumber and Yoghurt Sauce:- </P>

<PRE>
</PRE>
    
    <P>Combine in a bowl 4 inches-worth of cucumber cut into strips and then
      thinly sliced (ie, as small as possible), 10oz of natural yoghurt, the
      juice of half a lemon, 1 tablespoon of snipped chives and salt to taste.
    </P>
    
    <P> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Toasted Sesame and Sunflower Seeds:- </P>

<PRE>
</PRE>
    
    <P>Take 2oz sunflower seeds and 2oz sesame seeds and toss them in 1
      dessertspoon of soy sauce. Then spread out evenly on the bottom of a
      shallow heatproof dish and grill for 4 mins, shaking dish occasionally.
    </P>
    
    <P> So.... cook some rice to serve with the vegetables, pour over the
      cucumber and yoghurt sauce and sprinkle with the toasted seeds. Yummy! Let
      me know how it works out if you try it.... </P>
