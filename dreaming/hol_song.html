Subject: RUTH: What's this song about, anyhow? 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>Ever hear of a philosopher named Thomas Nagel? He made himself famous by 
writing a philospophy paper (circa 1974) entitled &quot;What Is It Like To Be a
Bat?&quot; I  seriously doubt if Kate Bush has ever heard of Thomas Nagel, yet
in &quot;Running Up  That Hill&quot; she says in four minutes everything Nagel
had to say in his paper and  more! (&quot;Do you want to feel how it feels?&quot;)
And much more beautifully too! 
</P>
<P>It's all about art and how artists make their art but can't know what its
like to  experience it, and how fans, who experience the art, can't know what it
was like to  make it. Everyone is trapped forever within themselves, never
knowing what it feels  like to be anything or anyone else. And all this, in the
song, is wrapped up in a  powerful sexual metaphor. 
</P>
<P>Once someone asked Kate Bush to respond to the common comment that one 
can't dance to her music. She responded that it didn't bother her, because *she*
 could (and does) dance to it. I wonder if it's any coincidence, considering the
subject  matter of the song, that this is the first Kate Bush song that is &quot;danceable&quot;?

<P>Date: Thu, 19 Sep 85 00:34:34 edt <BR> From: harvard!jerpc.PE!topaz!jer
(Eric Roskos @ Home) <BR> Subject: Meaning of RUTH Lyrics 
</P>
<P>Well, today I finally got the time to sit down and reread all the previous 
comments on the lyrics for RUTH, and also to listen to it several times.
However,  after listening to it, I still can't figure out how the song is about
the solipsistic nature  of the art experience or something of that sort. 
</P>
<P>My mundane and superficial interpretation, which I thought of after
listening to it  the first time, still makes more sense than that (although a
convincing argument for  a better interpretation could change my mind)... that
this song is about a woman  jogging in the city, who runs by some construction
workers, who are up in the  girders of a building under construction, who begin
shouting things at her the way  construction workers often shout things at
women. This makes her angry and hurt,  and she wishes they could exchange places
so that they could appreciate this. She  wishes she could go out and jog &quot;with
no problems;&quot; but she also wishes she could  run up the side of the
building, where the men are safely sitting, and confront them. 
</P>
<P>The lyrics puzzle me, though; is the first &quot;it doesn't hurt me&quot;
supposed to be a  denial of the reality? Since later she says, &quot;You don't
want to hurt me, but see how  deep the bullet lies.&quot; Or is it supposed to
reflect their mistaken sentiments, &quot;Aw,  gee, it doesn't hurt her none.&quot;

</P>
<P>See, this line &quot;Tell me, we both matter, don't we?&quot; suggests the
object-ification of  women which such comments imply. However, I don't see how &quot;You
and me won't  be unhappy&quot; relates to this, unless it means to suggest the
relative unimportance of  attraction based on appearance which such comments
also imply (if it meant this, it  would seem to be a sort of flaw to me; since
clearly people could be thus attracted  and still unhappy. Or maybe it merely
reflects another mistaken idea, like the &quot;it  doesn't hurt her&quot; one.).

</P>
<P>There aren't many other lyrics to this song, so it's hard to find much more
in it,  for me... but the reason I don't understand how it might relate to the
isolation  between the artist and the audience is that there is a sort of anger
and hostility  there; what does &quot;is there so much hate for the ones we
love,&quot; or the other  suggestions of harm (&quot;unaware that I'm tearing
you asunder&quot;) have to do with such  a concept? I would think that a song
about that subject would have a sad tone; I  think I could write such a song
myself, but it would have phrases denoting emptiness  and isolation, and tonal
echoes, and so on, rather than this sort of angry sound.

<P>Date: Wed, 9 Oct 85 05:39:24 edt <BR> From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus&gt; <BR>
Subject: The meaning of RUTH 
</P>
<P>Will it help to convince you if I tell you that both Peter Morris (one of
the editors  of Homeground, a KB fanzine) and I independently came to the same
conclusion?  This is what Peter Morris says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;It is that eternal mystery -- how can you see things from the
viewpoint of  another human being? Even enmeshed lovers cannot ultimately know
what the other  feels, though perhaps a deal with God to swap their places might
solve the  connundrum.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I should also point out that the promo video (not the one being shown on
MTV)  perfectly matches this interpretation (which I had long before seeing the
video or  *even* hearing the song -- I had the lyrics). There are hills and a
road and a  building and lovers, but no construction workers and no jogging. At
the point where  &quot;Is there so much hate for the ones we love?&quot; is
sung, Kate and her partner become  symbollically crucified on each other, and
later Kate becomes trapped in a whole  croud of Kate Bush's. 
</P>
<P>Also, Kate's newsletter just came out (I got it Friday), and Kate's
explanations of  all her songs are all compatible with my interpretations of all
of the songs (except  perhaps &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, because even her
explanation is pretty cryptic). This is what  Kate says about RUTH: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The song is very much about two people who are in love and how the
power of  love is almost too big for them, it leaves them very insecure and in
fear of losing  each other. It's also perhaps talking about some of the
fundamental differences  between men and woman.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I believe that all this is also a metaphor for the artist/fan relationship. 
</P>
<P>&gt; You would have to explain these things: <BR> &gt; What the hill
symbolizes. <BR> &gt; What the road symbolizes. <BR> &gt; What the building
symbolizes. <BR> &gt; What the phrase &quot;with no problems&quot; means. 
</P>
<P>Okay, I'll do a line by line analysis. 
</P>
<P>It doesn't hurt me <BR> == Don't be afraid of loving me. 
</P>
<P>Do you want to feel how it feels <BR> Do you want to know, know that it
doesn't hurt me <BR> == If you knew how it felt, you wouldn't be afraid. 
</P>
<P>Do you want to hear 'bout the deal <BR> that I'm making <BR> You, you and
me, <BR> And if I only could I'd make a deal with God <BR> And I'd get him to
swap our places <BR> == If only we could know what it's like to be each other. 
</P>
<P>Be running up that road <BR> == I want to solve the problems, to achieve my
goals, to realize perfect  communication, to reach prefection. 
</P>
<P>Be running up that hill <BR> == I want to overcome the natural obstacles. 
</P>
<P>Be running up that building <BR> == I want to overcome the man-made
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>If I only could, oh.... <BR> == But it seems so impossible. 
</P>
<P>You don't want to hurt me <BR> But see how deep the bullet lies <BR> ==
Difficulty with communication causes problems. Because I don't know what it  is
like to be you and you don't know what it is to be me. Sometimes it does hurt a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>Unaware I'm tearing you asunder <BR> == And sometimes I hurt you by
accident, without knowing it. 
</P>
<P>Ooh there is thunder in our hearts <BR> == This causes strife between us. 
</P>
<P>Is there so much hate for the ones we love?<BR>  = Love and hate are so
intertwined. A love relationship is always a love/hate  relationship. 
</P>
<P>Tell me we both matter don't we? <BR> == Both of us are important in the
grand scheme of things, aren't we? (Hints  strongly at the artist/fan
interpretation.) 
</P>
<P>You <BR> You and me <BR> You and me won't be unhappy <BR> == If we could
know what it is like to be each other, we wouldn't be unhappy. 
</P>
<P>C'mon baby c'mon darlin' <BR> Let me steal this moment from you now <BR>
Come on angel, c'mon,c'mon darling <BR> Let's exchange the experience oh, <BR>
== If only we could know what it's like to be each other.... 
</P>
<P>If I only could <BR> Be running up that hill <BR> With no problems. <BR>
== I'd be on the road to perfection and have no problems. 
</P>
<P>&gt; And, finally, why the song has an angry tone. 
</P>
<P>It's not &quot;angry&quot;. It's frustrated. But frustration is anger at the
hopeless situation  of the universe, right? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I hold a cup of wisdom <BR> But there is nothing within&quot; 
</P>

Subject: RUTH
</P>
<P>RUTH: 
</P>
<P>Actually, I find it to be one of her most enduring songs, that gets better
with each  listen. (Unlike the second song!). 
</P>
<P>One really weird thing, though, is that it literally sounds to be running at
a  different pace every single time I listen to it! 
</P>
<P>At first I thought that the 12&quot; and the cassette, and the CD were
mastered at  different speeds, but someone at the convention assured me that he
counted the  beats, and they are all the same. However, when I put it on this
morning, it seemed  to be running DOWN that hill, it was going so fast! (And it
can't be the turntable  'cos I have a portable CD player). Is this an aural
illusion? Has anyone else  experienced the same thing?

</P>
<P>The latest interview I've got contained a bit of a revelation. There was
some  debate on Love-hounds a few months back on exactly what the &quot;running
up that  hill&quot; section of that song has to do with the song's theme. Here's
Kate's answer: 
</P>
<P>So why the phrase &quot;running up that hill&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's meant to be the positivism of going somewhere. Climbing up a
mountain,  going up. It might be hard but you are getting there.&quot;

</P>
<P>The connection between &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and &quot;Curse of the
Demon&quot; has been  noticed before, most memorably by Dave Cross, who
presented a home-made video  to the song at the 1985 convention which included
scenes from the movie. 
</P>
<P>The really amazing thing about the quotation from the film (&quot;It's
coming...It's in  the trees!&quot;) is that, despite the almost perfect likeness
of Kate's version to the  original, Kate's is NOT lifted from the film. John
Carder Bush has said that the bit  of dialogue at the beginning of &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; is not the original, but a  re-creation.

ed191-bq%violet.Berkeley.EDU@BERKELEY.EDU (Taylor) <BR> Subject: Hounds of Love

</P>
<P>As far as the &quot;fan&quot; interpretation of Hounds of Love, although
Andrew Marvick  says that &quot;there isn't a shred of evidence in the song to
support&quot; the interpretation  that the pursuing hounds are her fans, I think
that Doug's interpretation is really  accurate. Judging from her behavior in the
past, Kate consistently has been very  skittish about letting her fans get too
close to her, which is totally understandable,  since she's a really private
person and deserves to be left alone, without thousands  of fans from all over
the world &quot;hounding&quot; her down with requests for locks of hair, 
personal advice or what have you. So although she is too polite to come right
out and  say, &quot;Lay off!&quot; I think the song contains a really strong
(even subconscious) message  to her fans to give her some room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>Of course, this doens't invalidate the fact that the song can also be
applied to a  one-on-one relationship type of situation. 
</P>
<P>I think a good example of her fear of fans was seen in last years (first)
convention  in Romford/London, where she only poked her head 'round the curtain,
and several  hundred rabid fans rushed to the stage. I wonder what it must have
looked like from  the stage?

</P>
<P> &gt; Hounds Of Love (alternate version) is WONDERFUL! 
</P>
<P> Yes, it is. What's even more wonderful is playing both the original (album)
 version in synch with the Alternative Hounds version. There're a couple of
tricky  discrepancies of bar-counts between the two versions, but once you get
them  straight, and providing you have some basic mixing equipment and a way to
affect  the speed/pitch of the two recordings, the result is stunning. (IED's
version is  extremely primitive, but it's not really much work, and a highly
rewarding  experience.)

</P>
<P> &gt; where did you find this version of 'hounds of love'?? i haven't heard
this  one--it's great! all the &quot;run run run run run run run, honey, run
from the hounds  of love&quot;'s--where'd it come from??? 
</P>
<P> That's the so-called &quot;Alternative Hounds&quot; mix of Hounds of Love,
Tracy. It was  on the 12&quot; version only (never released in the U.S.). It's
amazing, too. 
</P>
<P>It's IED's opinion that Kate sang most of that alternative vocal
spontaneously (ad  lib) while listening to the original version through
headphones. He says this because  he took out an evening and some two-track
equipment to graft the original  album-track to the &quot;Alternative Hounds&quot;
mix once, taking care to add the extra two  measures to the LP mix which crop up
toward the end of the 12&quot; mix, and the result  was incredible--the two
vocals (and their respective background vocals) dovetail  together absolutely
beautifully: they sound almost like a question-and-answer  session. Also, the &quot;Alternative
Hounds&quot; vocal often harmonizes a third away from  the original vocal. Try
it sometime, if you can take the time to synchronize the two  mixes. It's really
neat.

</P>
<P>&quot;Alternate Hounds of Love&quot; <BR> &gt;&gt; [Peter Manchester:] &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; is one of the most important of the single  releases, because the
12&quot; (12KB 3) presented &quot;Alternative Hounds of Love,&quot; an early 
sketch of the song that goes in a different direction than the final version,
and has  become my favorite. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;oug objects: <BR> &gt; What makes you think that this in an &quot;early
sketch&quot; of the song rather than a  later variation? 
</P>
<P>Fair enough--it is only a surmise, but I would say a very natural one. We
know  how Kate works; she works up a demo of a song, tries out various
approaches to the  vocal, looking for the feeling, the 'ring' of the song. &quot;Alternate
Hounds&quot; has got the  drum, strings (are they still synthesizer at this
point?), and background vocals pulled  together in the same arrangement as the
album version, but the lyric seems  rudimentary compared to the album version,
all refrain in effect, and the vocal  sounds to me like it is working more on
feeling and expression than final design of  the song, without the modulation
and variation of the album version. My assumption:  she released the song in its
final form, but then decided she couldn't let go of the  slightly different,
bawdier, straight-ahead feeling of an earlier form, and shared it  with us.

during the  instrumental lull in the middle of the song belonged to any members
of Monty  Python. The phrases used and the way they're delivered have me

these lines:

(Chris n Vickie) <BR> Subject: The Big Sky question 
</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that I really love the concept of &quot;The Big Sky&quot;
er, just the act  of looking up to notice the sky. People don't look up very
much any more. I'll be on  the bus or train, staring in wonder at a magnificent
sunset, someone will see me  staring and glance out, then go back to their book
or newspaper. Happens all the  time. I grew up on a farm and had vast expanses
of sky to look at. I love it that Kate  wrote a song about looking up and
noticing the clouds in the sky. 
</P>
<P>Sort of related, we just saw The Fisher King (loved it!) and I laughed at
the part  where Jeff Bridges' character says &quot;thank God no one ever looks
up in New York&quot;  because it's so true. I love architectual details, so I'm
always looking up at buildings,  but very few people do. 
</P>
<P>Did anyone else notice that when Robin &amp; Jeff's characters are in the
park, Perry  (Robin) says he's going to go &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;? 
</P>
<P>Terry &amp; Kate are friends....hmmm....

</P>
<P>Both Vickie and Jeff Burka mentioned enjoying looking at the sky, and I'm
glad  to see it. I have enjoyed it as long as I can remember, enough to make it
my  profession (research meteorologist). I can stand at my front room window or
out in a  field for a long time just enjoying the sky colors, clouds, weather,
etc. The sky is also  one of the prime attractions while hiking and backpacking.
An organization has even  been created (For Spacious Skies) to promote looking
at the sky for students, both  for its aesthetics (sp?) and as a lead-in for
learning. As for KaTe's music, I've also  loved The Big Sky just for that
reason. Heck, when was the last time you looked up  and said, &quot;That cloud
looks like Noah! Build me an ark!&quot; The act and the song are  tons of fun!!
You can also toss in Cloudbusting as a KaTe song with strong  meteorological (if
pseudo-scientific) interest. 
</P>
<P>Keep looking up!

</P>
<P>&gt; I got lots of stares in the theater yesterday when I saw The Fisher
King 'cause I  cracked up when Perry made the cloudbusting comment... (I also
got some stares  for laughing at the Brazil poster on the wall in one scene). 
</P>
<P>Jeff (whose kites often force people to look at the sky...;-) 
</P>
<P>My husband and I were at Gilliam's press conference for The Fisher King in 
Toronto and Gilliam was asked if the Brazil poster in the video shop was 'a
cheap  promotional plug'. Gilliam agreed that it was and said that ALL his
movies' posters  were hung in the video shop. I WISH I had picked up on the
Cloudbusting line -  didn't pick up on it or I could have ASKED...

</P>
<P>Jeff speculated on the nature of the line &quot;You never understood me, you
never  really tried&quot; in The Big Sky. My feeling is that this may be &quot;the
sky&quot; or &quot;the clouds&quot;  saying this, saying that people don't take
the time to appreciate these things any  more. I don't have any real &quot;proof&quot;
of this, but here's a quote that kind of suggests  it: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The next song is called &quot;The Big Sky.&quot; Someone sitting
looking at the sky,  watching the clouds change. I used to do this a lot as a
child, just watching the clouds  go into different shapes. I think we forget
these pleasures as adults. We don't get as  much time to enjoy those kinds of
things, or think about them; we feel silly about  what we used to do naturally.
The song is also suggesting the coming of the next  flood - how perhaps the &quot;fools
on the hills&quot; will be the wise ones.&quot; (1985, KBC 18)

<P>Actually, I always thought &quot;the Big Sky&quot; was a song about a hobby
or an obsession.  I get this vision of the movie with Clark Gable, Myrna Loy,
and Spencer Tracy in a  movie from 1938, about an airplane pilot called &quot;Test
Pilot&quot;.  I feel this song is about a  love that only very few can
appriciate.

Subject: I'm Looking At..... 
</P>
<P>The impression I always got from &quot;The Big Sky&quot; was of the singer
sitting on a hill,  looking at the clouds, etc., and enjoying them, while
thinking of the inadequacy of  the people in her life. I.e. the clouds and sky
were beautiful, didn't make demands  on her, and were just there to be enjoyed,
while people, well, &quot;never  understood..they never really tried..&quot; 
</P>
<P>I don't think this is out of the line with the quote Ron Hill posted, but
I'd sure  like to know what part of the song is about things to come....

Man 5:	That cloud looks like industrial waste.

why does the  arrangement give such a. .. haunted/chilling atmosphere to the
