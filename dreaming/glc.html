      <BR> Subject: Belated News Flash! (for UK Love-Hounds) </P>
    
    <P>Vickie here, </P>
    
    <P>I just talked to Peter David Fitzgerald-Morris (professor of Kate
      Bushology and Homeground fellow) and he told me that Kate wrote a song for
      an episode of The Comic Strip. </P>
    
    <P>It's the title theme for an episode named &quot;G.L.C&quot; (I don't
      know if that's the song title as well) and he thinks she may have written
      more incidental music for the episode as well, though he's not sure about
      that. This song will be on the b-side of L&amp;A when it's released in
      England in March. The episode is supposed to air this week or next. Check
      your TV Times. According to Peter, GLC is &quot;a film starring Charles
      Bronson (but actually Robbie Coltrane) as fearless Ken Livingston out to
      save London from the evil Ice Maiden (alias Margaret Thatcher).&quot; Ok,
      so it's a bit obscure to non-British. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Comic Strip </P>
    
    <P>The G.L.C. episode of the Comic Strip was shown last night on BBC 2 TV.
      As mentioned in this forum by Vickie, it featured music by Kate. There was
      not only the title theme &quot;G.L.C.&quot; (that's Greater London Council
      in case people are wondering) but also all the incidental music within the
      programme. Kate was credited for original music score at the end. </P>
    
    <P>The G.L.C. song was featured about two or three times in the programme,
      though only for c. 30 seconds in ecah case. It is a very raucous, up beat
      number with Kate at her bitchin' best! The lyrics were hard to decipher
      behind the dialogue and sound effects, but the main refrain was &quot;Ken
      is the leader of the G.L.C.&quot; (ok not particularly riveting). At times
      Kate's voice was almost screaming. As this song will be available soon on
      the next single I will not embarass myself further by trying to describe
      it in more detail. </P>
    
    <P>There was an instrumental piece at the start of the show which reminded
      me of Heads We're Dancing. At the end of the programme after the Ice
      Maiden has been laid to rest there was a very quiet, lyrical section but
      unfortunately again I could not make out the words. In one scene in a bar
      we heard Running Up That Hill. There were other short sections of
      incidental music some of which featured stings. In all, quite a varied
      selection, totally inadequately described by me - but I was trying to
      follow the dialogue as well (shame on me). </P>
    
    <P>The scenario of the show was the story of Ken Livingstone's rise to
      leadership of the G.L.C. and his struggle with Mrs Thatcher (the Ice
      Maiden) with just a slight distortion of the truth in true Hollywood
      style. Ken with the help of Joan Ruddock, Tony Benn and later Prince
      Charles replaces Horace Cutler as leader of the G.L.C. by popular acclaim
      (Horace beaten into third place by Screaming Lord Sutch). The Ice Maiden
      plots his downfall and bans the G.L.C. leading to an armed battle between
      Ken and his followers with the army. Prince Charles persuades the army to
      lay down their arms only for the Ice Maiden to persoanlly join the attack.
      Slain by a flagpole heaved by Ken, she is revealed to have been possessed
      by an alien force. </P>

    <P>[Sorry, header accidently deleted. --WIE] </P>
    
    <P>GLC: </P>
    
    <P>First of all, to clear up a misconception, GLC doesn't have anything to
      do with comic books. The Comic Strip is a generic title given to several
      series of short comedy movies broadcast on British television over the
      last few years, featuring some or all from a loose association of well
      know British comedians, including Rick Mayall, Dawn French, Jennifer
      Saunders, Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Robbie Coltrane, and several
      others. The movies usually satirise some specific cinematic style or some
      aspect of British life, and are most often written and/or directed by
      Peter Richardson, who usually plays one of the characters as well. The
      latest series, broadcast February/March on BBC2, included two movies which
      involved Kate Bush: &lt;GLC&gt;, for which she did the original music
      score; and &lt;Les Dogs&gt;, in which she played the role of the bride,
      Angela. </P>
    
    <P>&lt;GLC&gt;, as with &lt;Strike&gt; from the previous series, is a
      pastiche on a major political event in the UK (in this case, the rise and
      fall of the Greater London Council), with the main characters played in
      the style of movie characters associated with well known actors. Here are
      some snippets to whet your appetite ... </P>
    
    <P>J R Goldstein </P>
    
    <P>in association with </P>
    
    <P>Octopus Petroleum Products Corporation, Tokyo </P>
    
    <P>present </P>
    
    <P>G L C </P>
    
    <P>the carnage continues ... </P>
    
    <P>Dawn French plays Cher as Joan Ruddock </P>
    
    <P>Jennifer Saunders plays Brigitte Nielsen as The Ice Maiden </P>
    
    <P>Robbie Coltrane plays Charles Bronson as Ken Livingstone </P>
    
    <P>Peter Richardson plays Lee van Cleef as Tony Benn </P>
    
    <P>The movie begins outside the Warner West End, in London's Leicester
      Square, where the movie is being premiered. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;We've just heard that Cher has arrived, with the usual phalanx of
      highly trained bodyguards. - Miss Cher, Miss Cher, excuse me, Miss Cher,
      I'm from the BBC, might I have a few words with yo- ooff! - (crunch) -
      (thud) - aarrghh! - uurrgh! ...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The movie charts Ken's putatively unwilling rise to leadership of the
      GLC (the song &lt;Ken&gt; accompanies the election campaign section),
      ousting the corrupt Conservative administration and implementing his
      socialist policies; the homicidal rage of the Ice Maiden (aka. Margaret
      Thatcher) as her candidate is defeated at the polls, and her ministers
      fail to prevent Ken's increasing popularity (they meet various unpleasant
      ends for their failure); the assault by her private army on the besieged
      'good guys' in County Hall; and the final confrontation between Ken and
      the Ice Maiden. </P>
    
    <P>It is an imaginative satirical fantasy, with both sides in the conflict
      being shown in an equally jaundiced light (although the socialist's
      indictment is rather more subtle), and most of it beyond the bounds of any
      probable reality. (If you don't live in the UK, however, you'll miss out
      on some of the humour, which is dependent on some knowledge of the real
      characters and events upon which the story is based.) </P>
    
    <P>The Ice Maiden kills without mercy, being able to transform her right
      arm into various vicious weapons, and is eventually shown to have been
      possessed by an alien being; she keeps the Prince of Wales (Adrian
      Edmondson), an old man, imprisoned on a country estate, fed with drugged
      food to keep him docile. </P>
    
    <P>(The prince, walking in the garden, finds a book amongst the flower
      beds.) &quot;'Let's grow plums'. Hmm - that's interesting - never seen
      that one before.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Seeing that the prince's popularity goes beyond party boundaries, and
      could be used to unite the people against her, the Ice Maiden plans to
      dispose of him. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Good evening. It is my sad duty to have to inform you that our
      beloved Prince of Wales, whom all of you know has been unwell for some
      time, is unlikely ever to appear in public again. His head will remain on
      the money and on the stamps - but not on his shoulders. (Ha, ha, ha - you
      can wipe that bit.) I can assure you he is receiving the very best
      attention, from my own personal surgeon.&quot; (Cuts to crazed headsman in
      the Tower of London, sharpening his axe.) </P>
    
    <P>In the end the socialists have to call on the monarchy to save them, as
      they rescue the Prince of Wales from execution in the nick of time, and he
      subsequently persuades the attacking soldiers to lay down their arms. </P>
    
    <P>(The prince, speaking from the steps of County Hall.) &quot;... It is
      therefore my profound hope that the power of this country should rest with
      the people, and not with a woman who, one suspects, is not of this Earth.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>The Ice Maiden finally dies, impaled by a flagpole thrown by Ken, and
      the spirit of the real woman is released from her torment. </P>

    <P>Not being too political (in my head, nor on this group) the GLC stands
      for the &quot;Greater London Council&quot; which used to exist and was &quot;headed&quot;
      by Ken Livingstone, before the Maggie Thatcher Goverment got rid of the
      idea of local governments. At the time I seem to remember Maggie &quot;had
      it in for&quot; Ken, but maybe that was just the media. They painted Ken
      to be a really nice guy, he seemed to be doing nice things for the people
      and the city, but it could all be fabrication, newspapers like to publish
      a good/bad story. The Comic Strip which consists of a group of modern
      comedians (not sure on all of them, but there's about 5 or 6, I'll guess
      at Rik and Ade - as you said, but also Dawn French, perhaps also Jen
      Saunders, Robbie Coltraine, Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry, I've missed
      someone or two), and they made a &quot;Charles Bronson&quot; parody of the
      GLC vs Maggie incident. </P>
    
    <P>Please someone correct my mistakes! </P>

    <P>The GLC was the Greater London Council, i.e. London County Council. </P>
    
    <P>Its leader from c.1981 until its abolition by Thatcher's Tory government
      on January 31 1986 was Ken Livingstone, now Labour MP for Brent East. </P>
    
    <P>He was legendary as a hard left politician of whom there are very few in
      1990s UK politics. Vilified by many and loved by just as many, he is one
      of the true characters of British politics over the last 20 years!! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;GLC&quot; the film by the Comic Strip has various British comedy
      actors playing the parts of Hollywood stars trying to play characters from
      the GLC story. An example (I believe) was Robbie Coltrane as Charles
      Bronson playing Ken L. Thatcher was played by Jennifer Saunders (if I
      remember rightly - or was that another Comic Strip film?) </P>

    <P>Up until 1991, London had its own controlling authority called the
      Greater London Council (GLC). Its leader was Ken Livingstone (Labour) and
      his nickname was Red Ken! The Tory Party of the Day got really fed up with
      Ken (He hould do really annoying stuff like: the headquarters of the GLC
      were offosite the Houses of Parliament so he used to place the numbers of
      unemployed on a big sign on the roof facing the HOP every day so that all
      MPS could see it). </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, The Tory Patrty of the day decided that Local Government for
      London had to go and so abolished the GLC. Ken Livingstone is now a Labour
      MP and I think is in the shadow cabinet!?! </P>
    
    <P>On the last day of the GLC Red Ken held a huge party in Central London.
      Most Londoners want the return of the GLC. He subsudized Transport and
      provided arts and parks and lots of other stuff..... </P>

    <P>I haven't been onboard Gaffa for a while, but thought I'd add my two
      cents to this one. Right now, right in front of me (well, slightly to the
      right), but definitely very LEFT, is a button I picked up on my personal &quot;Summer
      of Love&quot; tour through Great Britain and France in 1984. It says &quot;Keep
      GLC Working for London&quot;. I distinctly remember being handed this
      button by a punkish young woman along with some pamphlets about the GLC
      and the great crime about to be perpetrated by the Tories in abolishing
      it. Of course, this was at the height of Maggie's reign of terror, and the
      GLC was a particularly annoying thorn in her side, what with all their
      communistic talk about housing and feeding the poor, providing decent day
      care for children etc. Funny how Mikhail Gorbachev was a man with whom she
      could do business, but Ken Livingstone wasn't...Never could figure out
      those brain-dead Tories...Maybe if Ken had acquired an SS7 and aimed it
      across the street he would have gotten more respect. </P>
