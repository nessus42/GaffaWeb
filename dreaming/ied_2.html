</P>
<P>As many astute readers of The Love-Hounds Digest will probably already know,
 due to mailer problems, The Love-Hounds Digest sent out this morning went out 
incomplete, and did so about ten times. I am very sorry about any problems this
may  have caused you with your disk quota, phone bills, and system manager. The
cause  of this problem is that IED posted a 220Kbyte article, the size of which
causes many  mailers a serious case of indigestion. 
</P>
<P>PLEASE REFRAIN FROM DOING THIS AGAIN. 
</P>
<P>Since Love-Hounds is now on autopilot, it is difficult for me to prevent
problems  like this. Now, I don't necessarily see an article before it goes out
to everyone. It is  therefore up to everyone to be careful with the articles
they post to make sure they  are of reasonable length and format. 
</P>
<P>In the near future I will repost in smaller pieces IED's article that got

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Mailbag: Enya, etc. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally about thirty other IED postings sent to Love-Hounds in October
and  November have STILL NOT APPEARED...|&gt;oug! 
</P>
<P>[on Enya:]
</P>
<P> Well, Craig, IED discovered Enya the other way around. He bought the first 
album (Enya, actually the soundtrack to the UK TV series The Celts) first, and
then  the second. The first album is very similar to Watermark in style, except
that it's  not as advanced technically. IED liked some of the tracks on the
first album  (including an absolutely heartmelting melody for uillean pipe solo
with synth  backing, with pipes by Liam O'Flynn) enough to seek out the CD,
which he finally  found yesterday. There is also a track called Aldebaran, which
IED thinks is very  beautiful, though it all depends on how high your
expectations are. It sounds to IED  a lot like an Irish-tinged early-Jean-Michel
Jarre album. Since IED has long ago  come to the realisation that there is
no-one out there with talent anywhere near the  level of Kate's these days, he
is content, when listening to pop music of any kind, to  accept as a given the
modesty of other musicians' achievements. 
</P>
<P>Enya has a definite melodic gift, a laudable interest in synthetic musical
processes,  and very good taste. (Aldebaran was dedicated to Ridley Scott.) On
the other hand,  her music is all very much of a type, most of the tracks use
essentially the same  narrow range of sounds and chords, and she doesn't even
write her own lyrics (her  producer's wife does that for her). Even with all
these pretty serious limitations,  IED finds a lot of beauty in her music, and
recommends it to anyone who is free of  prejudice against sweetness and
commerciality; and open to something more than  merely the overtly &quot;subversive&quot;
in music and art.

<P>Date: Sat, 31 Dec 88 15:14 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: XYZ and cloudbusting 
</P>
<P> &gt;&gt; Wilhelm Reich was killed for scientific heresy, and that is the
part of his story  that Kate Bush deals with in her excellent song &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;.

</P>
<P> &gt; Compare and contast with IED. 
</P>
<P> IED has no quarrel with Tim's statement above. He only wanted to point out 
that all aspects of Reich Sr. in the song are told from the point of view of his
young  son Peter. Wilhelm Reich's work is relevant only because it provided much
of the  child's early experience of life. Reich Sr. is relevant in the song--as
in the  book--only as a father dearly loved by his son. In the same sense, Reich
Sr.'s arrest  by U.S. government agents in the video are depicted because they
were a powerful  image, in the child's memory, of the forces which caused his
separation from his  father. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Reich was not even a minor martyr. 
</P>
<P> IED has no firm opinion about whether Reich was a &quot;martyr&quot; or
not. That he  was a victim of the political and social atmosphere of his
environment is beyond  question, however. Reich's practise in Maine and Arizona
in the 1940s and '50s was  never &quot;dangerous&quot; in the slightest degree
to anyone. XYZ's comparison with laetrile  is inappropriate. In the case of
laetrile there is a well-documented and rather high  incidence of patients whose
death may (or may not) have been hastened by their  reliance on the drug instead
of on more conventional treatments. In Reich's case  there were never any such
documented incidences. The analogy which XYZ draws is  unfair and unsupported by
the facts. 
</P>
<P> &gt; I would like to respond to the rather mean-spirited response by Andrew
 Marvick, to my posting about Kate and orgone energy. 
</P>
<P> IED's responses are all too often mean-spirited. This is one of his many
failings.  It cannot be said, however, that in the present context his ill
feeling was not  provoked, at least in part, by XYZ's own venomous attitude
toward both Reich  (whom he so eloquently termed &quot;a outrageous crank&quot; &lt;sic&gt;)
and Kate. 
</P>
<P> &gt; I will not continue this discussion here, (though email is fine),
since andrew (he  does not think it is impolite to use the miniscule form in
addressing others) is  repeatedly cited as a reliable source of information in
this group; `debates' on  someone else's home turf are never true debates. 
</P>
<P> Actually, there are almost certainly as many readers of Love-Hounds who do
not  consider much of IED's information and opinions &quot;reliable&quot;, so
you shouldn't feel at  a disadvantage there, XYZ. As for L-Hs being &quot;home
turf&quot;, you--like any other Kate  fan who isn't trying to make a financial
profit--are welcome to make Love-Hounds  your home turf, if you wish. 
</P>
<P>For the record, XYZ, IED called you &quot;dana&quot; simply because you
called yourself  &quot;dana&quot;--for no other reason. In fact, you continue to
call yourself &quot;dana&quot;. So why is it  seen as an insult that IED should
reproduce your own form of self-identification as  faithfully as possible?
Extremely peculiar. There are several Love-Hounds who  decline to use upper-case
letters in their signatures. IED cannot be expected to  know when this is
intentional and when it is just the writer's carelessness. 
</P>
<P>IED has discussed his self-reference in the third person many times over the
past  three years in Love-Hounds. He is not going to go over it again for a
late-comer, and  he is sure that the rest of the group are grateful for that.
Sorry. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, IED did try several times to e-mail XYZ directly, but without 
success. So for the time being any discussion between IED and XYZ will have to
be  conducted in public. Apologies to the rest of you. 
</P>
<P> &gt; (XYZ doubts &lt;Kate&gt; much cares if IED comes to her rescue.) 
</P>
<P> No argument there. IED never thought she did. But it certainly seems to
matter a  lot to you! 
</P>
<P> &gt; The theory is a series of statements that are falsifiable (and
false!). It is not  metaphysical, philosophical, or religious; if it has no
scientific validity is just plain  worthless. 
</P>
<P> Your faith in the omnipotence of science seems almost religious in its
intensity,  XYZ. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Is IED saying XYZ is not acquainted with the details of Reich's works?

</P>
<P> IED can only go by what you tell him, XYZ. You continue to cite secondhand 
sources like Gardner (and now H.G. Wells, too!) as the only basis for your
highly  emotional condemnation of Reich's work. IED once again suggests that you
try going  to the works of Reich himself. You might gain a broader insight into
another  person's point of view. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Further XYZ suggests that IED will find Gardner a far more reliable
and less  biased source of information than Peter Reich. 
</P>
<P> Reliable for what kind of information, XYZ? Try to keep the issues clear in
your  mind for a moment. Gardner is presenting pre-edited and abridged bits of 
information to you, secondhand, in order to support a very strong personal point
of  view about Wilhelm Reich's work. Peter Reich is presenting a highly personal
 account of his childhood experiences, including evocations of his personal 
relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich, the man. The two books have
virtually  nothing in common with each other. They concern quite different
subjects. Do you  see this yet? 
</P>
<P>It may be true that Gardner provides more reliable factual information about
 Reich's work and career than Peter Reich does. But it is definitely true that 
Wilhelm Reich's many fascinating books will tell you a great deal more about
that  work than Gardner can. 
</P>
<P>You're so fond of the scientific method, XYZ, why not follow one of
science's  most basic premises: don't rely on secondhand information when the
firsthand  source is readily available to you. Find out for yourself! 
</P>
<P> &gt;Grand theories by cranks are a dime-a-dozen and Reich's is one of the
least  interesting. If IED thinks they have a `magical appeal', then IED is
easily impressed,  or doesn't get out much. 
</P>
<P> But how could you possibly know whether Reich's books are interesting, XYZ,
if  you have never read them? One can scarcely experience the magical appeal of 
Crime and Punishment, for example, by reading the plot synopsis in a Cliff Notes
 booklet! IED is trying to make you understand that Reich's work is valuable as 
literature, as art, not for the validity or lack of validity of his claims. You
are simply  not in a position to judge the value of Reich's work until you take
the time to read  it--preferably several volumes. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Incidentally, your statement that the real Cloudbuster was the same as
Kate's is  also false. 
</P>
<P>[The rest of this paragraph then seeks to show that, in fact, the statement
is true.  XYZ does know what it looks like. Sheesh!] 
</P>
<P>&gt; XYZ conveniently fails to reproduce &quot;the rest of this paragraph&quot;!

</P>
<P>How could anyone possibly come to the conclusion that the original
cloudbuster  and Kate's video cloudbuster are &quot;the same&quot;? It's absurd.
They have only the most  basic qualities in common. It is clear that XYZ does
not know what the two models  look like, or he would not continue to embarass
himself on the point. 
</P>
<P> &gt;XYZ cannot help but be impressed by IED's choice of `treatment'; this
leaves  open that it is not `about' the book, but just some sort of
impressionistic treatment.  If it were actually about the book then all XYZ's
other comments still apply.  Otherwise it is an ethereal book report. 
</P>
<P> You raise an interesting point. Kate's method has usually been to treat a
story  (whether it be derived from a book, a film, a picture, a newspaper story
or  someone's oral account) without making its source immediately clear. There
is a  very good reason for this. Kate's intention is always to try to evoke the
emotions  which she felt in experiencing the original stimulus which inspired
the song. The  frequent result of this intention is a song which plunges the
listener directly into the  experience of the story's characters. This means
that very often the listener has  difficulty figuring out exactly what the facts
surrounding the narrative source are.  Kate has often said that a bland
explanation of the story has the effect of reducing its  emotional power. So IED
often refers to Kate's songs as &quot;treatments&quot; of a story,  rather than
literal explications of a text. XYZ may choose to call such songs &quot;ethereal
 book reports&quot;, if he wishes. IED wouldn't argue the point; it's
substantially true.  But why is this bad ? On what grounds do you criticise
Kate's method? 
</P>
<P> &gt;It is certainly curious that Peter cannot seem to understand orgone
energy,  while 1000s of others seem to; he tries to avoids claiming to believe
anything that is  patently absurd. But Peter does claim to understand, or at
least is intrigued by the  real possibility of, rainmaking. The two are
inextricably mixed. To claim to believe in  (to even discuss) cloudbusting
without mentioning orgone energy is an intellectually  dishonest ploy. If this
IED's idea of a defense, then the situation is worse than  expected. 
</P>
<P> Once again, XYZ, you have failed to grasp a crucial point. Apparently you 
haven't yet understood that Peter Reich's book is an account of his experiences
as a  child. As a child ! Got it? His aim in writing A Book of Dreams was not to
address  the question of whether cloudbusters actually attract and repel various
forms of  orgone energy, nor even the question of whether cloudbusters can make
it rain.  These issues are irrelevant to the book. Peter Reich was simply trying
to  communicate the emotions which he experienced as a child, during a period
early in  his life when he really did believe in the cloudbuster's power to make
it rain.  Although in fact, the boy's experience of losing his father, and
indeed of all the last  few months he spent with Reich, Sr. prior to his
conviction, is symbolised in part by  intimations that the &quot;magic&quot;
wasn't really true. As Peter's childhood situation  crumbles around him, his
belief in the cloudbuster (and in many other aspects of his  life with Reich,
Sr.) takes on an increasingly defensive quality--one of the many  brilliant and
genuinely moving aspects of the book. 
</P>
<P> &gt;While XYZ has no evidence, it must be considered that Peter will profit
as long  as he straddles the fence. 
</P>
<P>Well, XYZ, you're certainly right in saying that you have no evidence. Since
Peter  Reich has only written the one book, and since that book has now been out
of print  for a number of years, and since he has never given any lectures about
his father's  work (to IED's knowledge), it seems highly unlikely that he &quot;profits&quot;
by his father's  reputation. Beyond that, however, IED must ask you once more to
explain why it is  so imperative to you that Peter Reich should have to take
some definite position on  the issue. Why does everything have to be so
black-and-white to you, XYZ? 
</P>
<P> &gt;XYZ thinks that A Book of Dreams must have been one the least
surprising  titles in any bookstore, much less an occult one (XYZ will not
pursue the question of  what she was doing in such a store - its a free
country). (Gardner calls the book a  `touching biography of his father'.) But
this is of no real importance. 
</P>
<P> A Book of Dreams was never a popular seller, XYZ. It only went through
three  rather small pressings before going out of print for good. Its appearance
even in an  occult bookshop was not something one could have counted on even in
1974, let alone  in a general bookstore. Nowadays, a used copy is a real rarity.

</P>
<P>If Gardner really called A Book of Dreams a &quot;biography of his father&quot;,
then IED  suggests you put down Gardner's book right away and read Peter's book.
It is not a  &quot;biography&quot;. Gardner sounds as though he hasn't even read
the book. It contains  virtually none of the kind of specific factual
information which one would expect to  find in a biography. The book is
concerned mainly, even exclusively, with Peter's  own experiences, both as a
child and as a young adult, and all the references to his  father's life are
described from the decidedly unbiographical point of view of a  small boy. 
</P>
<P> &gt;Peter, of course, thinks they were trumped up charges! 
</P>
<P> Where do you get this stuff from, XYZ? How do you know what Peter Reich 
thinks of the charges against his father? He didn't make his adult position on
the  Reich case explicit anywhere in the book that IED could see. Anyway, what 
difference does it make to the beauty of Peter's childhood memoir whether he now
 accepts Wilhelm Reich's side of the case or not? It's irrelevant. 
</P>
<P> &gt; However the song is not about the boy's introspective attitudes
towards having  grown up with a crazy father. It concerns cloudbusting which
rests on the `value in  Reich Sr.'s theories'. Without an outlook the lyrics are
pointless (in the strict sense  of the word). 
</P>
<P> Perhaps that's just your problem, XYZ: you're always trying to preserve the
 &quot;strictest sense of the word&quot;. The fact is that Peter's book is about
the child's  attitudes toward the experience of growing up with his &quot;crazy
father&quot;. It concerns  cloudbusting only insofar as cloudbusting was a part
of that child's experience. The  &quot;outlook&quot; of the child toward
cloudbusting changes subtly from one of relatively  unthinking belief to one of
slightly defensive faith. But it is the faith of a child in  both cases. Kate is
true to the book in that respect, and her &quot;outlook&quot; is an  emotional,
rather than an intellectual, one. 
</P>
<P> &gt; (BTW, XYZ has not had an opportunity to see any Kate videos.) 
</P>
<P> Oh, great. So you're really arguing from a position of strength! You
haven't seen  the video, you haven't read any of Wilhelm Reich's own work, and
you haven't  read Peter Reich's memoirs. Some scientist! 
</P>
<P> &gt;If she cannot identify cloudbusting as a sham after talking to Peter
for ten  minutes then .... 
</P>
<P> When did you talk to Peter, XYZ? If you haven't talked to Peter, or read
his  book, or read his father's books, or seen Kate's video, how do you know
whether  Peter is convincing or not, or whether he defends cloudbusting or not,
or whether he  has ever tried to argue that cloudbusting actually works? And
this is the kind of case  you make against IED's openmindedness! 
</P>
<P> &gt;Reich's work is not harmless; perhaps XYZ was too circumspect when he
said it  was worthless - it is dangerous to people's health and their
pocketbooks.He  repeatedly recommended orgone energy(used in conjunction with
various  accumulators) be used to cure illnesses, such as cancer. It is
dangerous the same as  laetrile. XYZ's comments only came from trying to `make
sense' of the lyrics. XYZ  never questioned the artistic value of the music; IED
knows this but he cannot resist  a predictable and sweeping argument for
dismissal. 
</P>
<P> IED is overwhelmed. XYZ, your latest posting is so ill-conceived, poorly
written  and sloppily considered that IED really doesn't feel energetic enough
to reply in the  detail that he would like. 
</P>
<P>The main conclusion that IED must draw from your latest mass of jumbled 
verbiage is that you have an axe to grind. You despise all aspects of
metaphysics, and  it's clear that your position of angry disbelief is utterly
unshakeable. There are  dozens of indications of this dogmatic attitude in your
posting, but the baldest of  these is your suggestion that Kate's decision to
visit an occult bookstore is somehow  allowable because &quot;its &lt;sic&gt; a
free country&quot;! How is one to argue rationally with  someone who has the
great questions of life and death so tidily solved for himself  that there can
be no intellectual justification for even visiting an occult bookstore? 
</P>
<P>Another of your statements which IED must react to concerns the contention
that  there was a contradiction in IED's supposition regarding Kate's &quot;belief
in&quot; or  disbelief in Reich's orgone work. IED's point--clearly and
concisely presented--was  that Kate retains an open mind on questions for which
neither science nor art have  satisfying answers. Obviously this is not true of
XYZ. He apparently has found all the  answers he needs in science. IED has not.
There's really not much else that can be  said on this subject. 
</P>
<P>Another point arises. There is no evidence that any of Reich's patients was
ever  harmed in any way through their involvement with orgone research and
practises. If  you believe otherwise, you have simply been misinformed. For an
exhaustive and  eminently dispassionate account of the F.D.A. case in all its
permutations, read  Jerome Greenfield's Wilhelm Reich vs. the U.S.A., published
in 1974. There is also a  very readable little book called Some Sense about
Wilhelm Reich, by Lee Raditsa,  which might help you out. And again, XYZ, you
are advised to read Reich's own  work itself, rather than relying (as you
evidently continue to do) on the opinions of  third parties. 
</P>
<P>Finally, XYZ, please try to remember that Kate's song was inspired and based
on  the memoir of Reich's son's childhood. Rather than taking your guru,
Gardner's,  word for it that A Book of Dreams is &quot;moving&quot;, why don't
you read the book for  yourself, XYZ? There is no reason why Kate Bush should
have to take some kind of  ideological position on the scientific reliability of
the cloudbuster. Kate was trying to  evoke in musical terms the emotions which
she felt were communicated in Peter's  book. That's all. Since Peter, as a small
boy, actually believed that the cloudbuster  could make it rain, Kate's song
makes the same assumption. It is quite clear,  however, from both the song and
the video, that this belief is that of a small boy.  What Kate herself believes
is quite irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>Please, XYZ, try to show a little tolerance of others' ideas and attitudes
toward  life. It's not all science, you know. Last time IED checked, life, like
Kate, was still a  great mystery.

<P>From: dsr@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu (Dana S. Richards) <BR> Date: 3 Jan 89
19:29:50 GMT <BR> Subject: Re: XYZ and cloudbusting 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED is overwhelmed. XYZ, your latest posting is so ill-conceived,
poorly written  and sloppily considered that IED really doesn't feel energetic
enough to reply in the  detail that he would like. 
</P>
<P>I am sorry to hear this. My posting was carefully-conceived; it was composed
over  an 8-hour period after much research, editing and re-editing. Every word
was  carefully chosen to avoid any misconception. Some phrases were meant to be 
provocative, but IED exceeded my expectations in rising to the bait. It was not 
written in an emotional state -- in spite of this I have described as wildly 
`emotional' and `venomous'. 
</P>
<P>I will not rehash his rejoinder. It suffices to say that, almost without
exception,  every response IED made to each of my points was a non-sequitar, or
a gross  distortion of my position, or read things into my discussion that were
simply not  there. I do not know were the problem lies (my writing, or the
electonic medium, or  IED's need to read things emotionally) but true
communication seems impossible. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Oh, great. So you're really arguing from a position of strength! You
haven't  seen the video, you haven't read any of Wilhelm Reich's own work, and
you  haven't read Peter Reich's memoirs. Some scientist! 
</P>
<P>First, since the lyrics alone were being discussed, the video is at best an
appendix  to the discussion. 
</P>
<P>Second, it is not clear how reading these would make me more `scientific'
since  you have already granted that they have `no scientific validity'. 
</P>
<P>Third, this is an old and effective argument for dismissal, that really does
not hold  water. Essentially it says I cannot consider anything worthless that I
have not  rigorously and exhaustively studied. But that is not how science
works; everyone  relies on expert opinion to guide one's way through the dense
forest of conflicting  claims. (Of course, when someone finally decides to
become an `expert' on a  subject, then one should be more exhaustive.) 
</P>
<P>I have played this game with other people before (e.g., Velikovsky,
creationism,  homeopathy) and they always claim this is an unjust approach. But
if you read some  of their literature, to appease them, then you are told you
read the wrong parts, and  if you read it all then you are told that you did not
understand (or worse you refuse  to understand). It is a no-win situation that
recurs all too often. 
</P>
<P>I remain steadfast that there is too much junk not there to not rely on
trusted  expert opinion. 
</P>
<P>(IED, and everyone else, does it but claim not to when it convenient. For
example,  if IED lived in California last May, he surely would not leave the
state because of a  Nostradamus `prediction'. He would not say the only
scientific thing to do is read  the original predictions. Of course not, he
would rely on a) the fact it is nonsense,  and 2) the fact that expert opinion
lends no support to the theory.) 
</P>
<P>(Incidentally Gardner is not my `guru', but he is a close friend of mine; I
have  discussed these matters many times at his home. If Gardner says the book
is a  `touching biography' of his father you may take it that: 
</P>
<P>a) he has read the book (as well as all of Reich Sr.'s works on orgonomy),
and 
</P>
<P>b) he regards the book as supplying a portrait of his father.) 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; Incidentally, your statement that the real Cloudbuster was the same
as Kate's  is also false. 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; The rest of this paragraph then seeks to show that, in fact, the
statement is  true. XYZ does know what it looks like. Sheesh!] XYZ conveniently
fails to  reproduce &quot;the rest of this paragraph&quot;! 
</P>
<P>&gt;How could anyone possibly come to the conclusion that the original
cloudbuster  and Kate's video cloudbuster are &quot;the same&quot;? It's absurd.
They have only the most  basic qualities in common. It is clear that XYZ does
not know what the two models  look like, or he would not continue to embarass
himself on the point. 
</P>
<P>I never said is was `the same'; I said it was an `ornate version', which you
 conveniently fail to reproduce. If I say I know what a cloudbuster looks like,
you can  take it that I do. 
</P>
<P>I said I would not respond point by point, so let me stop here. The
following  paragraph, which is essentially repeated several times, deserves
comment. 
</P>
<P>&gt; The main conclusion that IED must draw from your latest mass of jumbled
 verbiage is that you have an axe to grind. You despise all aspects of
metaphysics, and  it's clear that your position of angry disbelief is utterly
unshakeable. 
</P>
<P>I do not `despise' metaphysics; I do not `despise' anything, except,
perhaps,  having words put in my mouth. 
</P>
<P>It is true that I `believe in' science. There are many wonderful and
mysterious  things science has not explained. I ascribe these to ignorance and
not to mystical (not  `metaphysical') causes. All the evidence of history is my
favor; I would be surprised  if really thought you had any evidence that you
thought would change my mind. 
</P>
<P>I would hate that think that I would have to have a mystic outlook in order
to  approach Kate's music.

<P>&gt; Dana clearly sees book-burning as a very minor thing, of no real import
as long  as the books being burned are the right ones. I find this mindset so 
incomprehensible that no possibility remains for real debate. He would no doubt 
find better company in Jerry Falwell's Liberty College than here. 
</P>
<P>Dana Richards said: 
</P>
<P>&gt; I seem to be defending myself against things I never said. (I confess
it is a good  debating tactic: paraphrase in so an outrageous way as to leave
the impression you  are dealing with an idiot. Falwell would be proud.) 
</P>
<P>An even better debating tactic, at least as far as scoring points with an
inattentive  audience is concerned, is to deny that you supported a position
which can easily be  subjected to a reductio ad absurdum. The fact is that you
said Reich was treated as  he should have been, and therefore since his books
were burned, you supported the  burning of his books. 
</P>
<P>As for making it appear that you are an idiot, I need not lift a finger to 
accomplish that which you have so effortlessly achieved. Surely more people that
IED  and myself were given the opportunity to snicker when you claimed that your
 incoherent, ranting message against IED, utterly devoid of points, was composed
and  extensively revised over the course of eight hours. 
</P>
<P>&gt;I never advocated book-burning, or any form of censorship. I merely said
 medical fraud is a crime. I am sorry if you think that is controversial. 
</P>
<P>You supported book burning. You did not say &quot;I support book burning&quot;,
but you  said very explicitly that a situation in which books were burned was
handled well.  They are equivalent statements. 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;I can only repeat that any reading of the lyrics to &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
shows that it  concerns primarily Reich's arrest by federal agents, not
orgonomy. 
</P>
<P>&gt;No doubt this is meant to leave the impression the two things are
unrelated.  They are not.

<P>Date: Fri, 06 Jan 89 20:48 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Mailbag: Kate-echism
XVIII.1.vi 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P> &gt; Right on, dude. That was absolutely beautiful! Definitely the best
shot against  Marvick that I've ever read. 
</P>
<P>-- Mike Schmelzer 
</P>
<P> IED was genuinely unaware that his correspondents in Love-Hounds think of 
themselves as being &quot;against Marvick&quot;. He honestly doesn't think of
himself as  being &quot;against&quot; them! His only intention in contributing
to this group is to spread as  much accurate information about the work of Kate
Bush as possible, and to provide  defense of that work when he feels that a
defense may be beneficial to the readers.  That has always been his only
intention. As his acknowledgement of his recent error  concerning the lyrics in
The Ninth Wave shows, he is (and always has been) willing  to admit personal
failings whenever they are shown to him to exist--especially when  those
failings confuse a Kate-related issue. 
</P>
<P>In the case of the recent argument over Wilhelm Reich and Kate Bush, IED has
 so far made no such errors, and therefore will not retract a word. He is sorry
if  Mike Schmelzer and XYZ/dana/Dana are offended as a result of IED's
commentary  on the subject, but he can do nothing about that. When a Love-Hound
makes false,  misinformed or unfair remarks about Kate or her work, IED will say
so, whether  feelings get hurt or not. 
</P>
<P> &gt;My posting was carefully-conceived; it was composed over an 8-hour
period  after much research, editing and re-editing. Every word was carefully
chosen to  avoid any misconception. Some phrases were meant to be provocative,
but IED  exceeded my expectations in rising to the bait. 
</P>
<P> It makes no difference whether you spent eight hours or one minute
composing  your posting about Cloudbusting, XYZ--all that matters is the result:
a messy,  unsupported message leveling unwarranted criticism at Kate Bush. IED
is sorry if  your posting, the weakness of which IED felt it important to expose
in Love-Hounds,  was the product of so much careful labour on your part.
Nevertheless, the errors and  distortions exist in it, and they are a matter of
record. 
</P>
<P> &gt;First, since the lyrics alone were being discussed, the video is at
best an  appendix to the discussion. 
</P>
<P> Your premise is false. IED responded to your criticism that Kate was
somehow  culpable for failing to condemn the work of Wilhelm Reich. IED pointed
out several  aspects of the subject which you had been unaware of--among these
were a number  of details included in the video. Whether you had seen that video
or not has no  bearing whatever on the relevance of Kate's video to the subject
of Kate's attitude  toward Reich. The fact is, you passed a harsh and hasty
judgement on Kate about  this subject, before you had bothered to find out all
that Kate had actually said about  the subject. That's the danger of mouthing
off half-cocked: you're liable to suffer a  backfire. 
</P>
<P> &gt;Second, it is not clear how reading these would make me more
`scientific'  since you have already granted that they have `no scientific
validity'. 
</P>
<P> You're confused again, XYZ. IED was pointing out the lack of logical, 
step-by-step thinking in your comments. IED has never denied that there is a
lack of  scientific support for Reich's ideas. But he finds it odd that someone
like yourself,  who apparently values such qualities as scientific verifiability
very highly, is so  careless with the facts himself. IED was being ironic in
saying of you, &quot;Some  scientist!&quot; Get it? 
</P>
<P> &gt;Essentially it says I cannot consider anything worthless that I have
not rigorously  and exhaustively studied. But that is not how science works;
everyone relies on  expert opinion to guide one's way through the dense forest
of conflicting claims. (Of  course, when someone finally decides to become an
`expert' on a subject, then one  should be more exhaustive.) I have played this
game with other people before (e.g.,  Velikovsky, creationism, homeopathy) and
they always claim this is an unjust  approach. But if you read some of their
literature, to appease them, then you are told  you read the wrong parts, and if
you read it all then you are told that you did not  understand (or worse you
refuse to understand). It is a no-win situation that recurs  all too often. 
</P>
<P> This is a specious argument. As IED has already said several times in this 
increasingly silly discussion, he agrees that one can't be expected to learn 
everything about a subject before deciding that it holds nothing for him. But
this is  quite different from noisily announcing that a vast body of work (like
Reich's) is  entirely without value either as science or art; criticizing
another artist's work on  moral grounds for failing to make the same kind of
rash condemnation which you  have made; and then blithely admitting that you
have made no firsthand study of the  subject whatsoever! 
</P>
<P>Here is IED's point: Certainly it's true that one must be selective about
what  information one invests time in acquiring. IED would never deny, either,
that it is  acceptable to rely on one's general life experience for the
formation of opinions and  personal taste. But it is also true that one should
not base all of one's conclusions on  nothing except second- and thirdhand
information, general experiences and wildly  emotional personal biases! In other
words, XYZ, it's all relative. So, for example, IED  would never have made the
slightest objection (nor, probably, would he have even  bothered to respond) had
you announced in Love-Hounds that you personally didn't  enjoy the lyrics of
Kate's Cloudbusting, and that you had such deep feelings about  the immorality
of Reich's later career that it spoiled the atmosphere of the song for  you. 
</P>
<P>But instead of that, you came out shouting (in very angry language, whether
you  wish to remember it as such or not) that not only was all of Reich's work
utterly  without value of any kind--either as science or as art--; but also that
because this  was somehow a &quot;fact&quot; which any respectable person should
agree with you about, it  was somehow reprehensible of Kate to dare to write a
song about Reich without  making explicit not only the subject, but the
immorality (as you see it) of the subject  as well. When in fact, you hadn't
bothered to find out even the most rudimentary  facts that 1.) Reich's early
work is quite different in nature to his later work; 2.)  Reich's own original
writing--as opposed to the carefully pre-digested and myopic  synopses of
Gardner--is actually quite remarkable as literature; and 3.) Kate's song  wasn't
even about Reich Sr., but about his son's deeply personal account of his 
childhood! 
</P>
<P>Now, relying on general knowledge of the world and personal taste is one
thing.  Blaring long series of silly, unsupported and misinformed statements
about a subject  you evidently know nothing about is quite another! 
</P>
<P> &gt;I would hate that think that I would have to have a mystic outlook in
order to  approach Kate's music. 
</P>
<P> Well of course not, XYZ (or dana, or Dana, or whatever you choose!). Nor
has  IED ever even implied any such thing, as you surely know! IED thinks it's
safe to say  that Kate would have no problem with a skeptic enjoying and even
appreciating her  work--possibly better than many &quot;mystics&quot;, even. Why
not? 
</P>
<P>It would help you a little, perhaps, however (in IED's opinion) if, instead
of  assuming that what hasn't yet been proved is necessarily impossible, you 
entertained the notion that what hasn't yet been proved might simply be beyond 
human science's present capacity to recognize. You know, science didn't even
admit  the possibility that the Earth was round until quite recently in human
history.  Wouldn't you at least concede that there's still a lot we don't yet
know?

</P>
<P>The reasons for IED's excessively defensive tone are 1.) that he takes Kate
far too  seriously for his own good, and 2.) that he has periodically provoked
genuinely hostile  reactions from readers in this group for that very
seriousness. IED will try to  discipline himself better to stick to the subject
and avoid the personals. But at least  now all the newer Love-Hounds have had a
good look at IED's reaction to unfair  and abusive criticism of Kate Bush. They

</P>
<P> &gt;&gt; Could IED do all of us Love-Hounds a favor and package up his
transcriptions  in a large file available through anonymous FTP? I have been
following each of the  interviews posted by IED, but I haven't archived them. I
would much prefer to grab  them all in one big package. 
</P>
<P>A couple of problems with that idea. First, IED doesn't know what the fuck 
(pardon his French) an &quot;FTP&quot; is, nor does he particularly want to find
out. He is a  stubborn computer-illiterate. Second and more importantly, all of
his Kate files are  stored in laser-printer format only. He does not have the
time to re-format any of  that stuff for easier L-Hs re-reading. If, therefore,
someone can give IED a very  repeat very brief lesson in how to send this stuff
to you--using a simple repeat  simple, and reliable, e-mail address, and not
requiring that he spend an hour or  more breaking the 30,000 lines+ of material
into more convenient little blocks--and if  you don't mind figuring out how to
re-format it all yourself--then IED will try to  oblige. 
</P>
<P>But why oh why didn't these people save the texts when they were originally 
posted??? The texts that IED keeps transcribing are for life-long study, you
know,  not a few moments' fleeting entertainment!

the  reference librarian if they carried any of the works of Kate Bush, and lo

but on  closer examination its cover-photo was different. IED asked if he could
inspect it,  and the visitor grudgingly obliged. Lo and behold, what should the

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: retraKTion; and admoniKTion 
</P>
<P>ANNOUNCEMENT OF POLICY CHANGE: 
</P>
<P>IED is going to have to set a new policy, and not only because it's too much
work  to go on the way he has been. From now on, when some new (or inattentive) 
Love-Hound asks a question that IED (along with perhaps many others) has 
answered in L-Hs before, IED will probably not be forthcoming with an answer.
It's  just getting to be ridiculous. This month alone there were renewed
questions about  whether there were computer images (and if so how to access
them), whether  someone had the address of the sheet-music company, whether
there was an  address for Intergalactic Garage, whether there was an address for
Homeground,  whether the lyrics were on file, whether there were lyrics on the
U.S. re-issue CD  of TD, whether that was Donald Sutherland in Cloudbusting or
not, whether there  were bootleg records of Kate live, whether those records had
good sound, whether  there had been a first obsKuriTies tape, whether it was
still available, why not,  whether postage was required for the new tape
project, etc., etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>All of those questions have been answered at least twice, and in some cases
many  more times, in Love-Hounds before. There's supposed to be a Love-Hounds 
Archives for just this sort of thing. IED has become very frustrated at the
almost  incredible lack of retention on the part of many Love-Hounds. If you've
got such  curiosity about Kate, you should access the archives and read about
her. And in cases  where the answer has actually been asked and answered already
within a matter of  a few weeks, you should be able to access your own
Love-Hounds files. Some of you  people would seem to be dumping each L-Hs
transmission right after reading it, and  then a week later you figure you want
to know something so you ask all over again.  Nuts. It's all in Archives. So it
takes a while to weed out stuff you don't need. 
</P>
<P>If you're really a seriously interested fan of Kate's work that shouldn't
deter  you. If you're only casually curious, then IED is going to let someone
else worry  about filling you in from now on. There's just no satisfaction
anymore in telling  Love-Hounds the basic facts over and over, only to have
someone else (sometimes  the same people) ask the questions again a week later.

</P>
<P>Anyway, IED has begun to question the very premise of Love-Hounds. Just 
exactly why is it such a great idea to make information about Kate Bush's work
so  easy to obtain? A very large part of Kate's own aesthetic has to do with
aspects of  secrecy, and the concealment of the message. That being so,
shouldn't IED be  encouraging these newer Love-Hounds to dig up the information
on their own?  Isn't it fundamentally contrary to Kate's own designs and plans
for IED to be  exposing all the hidden information all the time? Yes, it really
is. It's about time IED  re-considered his role in this group, and whether his
long-held policy of unlimited  free access to pre-digested information about KT
is a wise one. 
</P>
<P>And no, IED will not be making the first obsKuriTies tape available again!
There  are 130+ people who have copies out there. Find one and get a copy that
way. And  don't ask IED to post the list of the other recipients again for your

<P>Hey, IED! Wake up and smell the coffee! If I hadn't found out about &quot;The
Ninth  Wave&quot;'s intricate plot and construction thru Love-Hounds I would've
figured it was  just a bunch of random noise thrown together and never listened
to it. It is not easy  for a person who doesn't know what he or she is looking
for to find out about Kate,  particularly if he or she is an American. I am well
aware that the story associated  with &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; was published
in a zillion places, but none of those zillion  places crossed my path, until I
hooked up with Love-Hounds (which I was duped  into reading on the rather
spurious claim that it was an alternative music discussion  list&gt;!! Nobody
ever mentioned Kate Bush...) 
</P>
<P>SO anyways... You can keep quiet if you want, but information must never be 
guarded! We live in the information era, and it must be readily available to any
and  all seekers.

<P>Jon Drukman and Joe Turner both seem to share a sad, adolescent fear of
direct  expression of softer emotions in art. The Sensual World : &quot;Ack barf&quot;
(even though  it's plainly one of the greatest album titles in the history of
music); &quot;The sheets are  soaked by your tiny fish&quot;: &quot;Ack barf&quot;
(even though it's clearly a line of pure genius,  especially as sung--two
different ways--in the song); the &quot;visuals&quot; in Hammer-smith  : &quot;laughably
inane&quot; (even though there can really be no question whatever that  Kate's
performance is beyond any legitimate aesthetic criticism of any kind ); the 
lyrics of In the Warm Room : &quot;Ack barf&quot;: (even though they are among
the only  lyrics in the history of music to have dealt with such a subject from
such a  perspective, and with amazing lyrical success--and this is of course
quite beyond any  question); etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>IED recommends that Jon and Joe take off a few weeks to &quot;get in touch
with  their feminine sides,&quot; or something. Because their criticism has
begun to say far  more about their own hangups than about the work they attempt
to criticize (which,  of course, is completely uncriticizable).

<P>You bet. Art is not the place for songs about posies and red roses and soft
sunlight  diffusing like a million optic fibers through your auburn tresses
while a string  quartet plays a brilliant little piece off to the left behind
that gorgeous sequoia. Art is  about beer cans being smashed into foreheads. Art
is about not being able to have  your orgasm on the Playboy Channel because of
horrible noise interference. Art is  about the reconciling of fundamentally
irreconcilable objects. Hence &quot;Waking The  Witch&quot; - brilliant piece of
work. ART in the highest sense. Everything else is just  decent pop music, which
ain't art. But I don't want to get into this, because I'm  being really
facetious and flip and off the cuff here. This is because all through high 
school my teachers constantly told me that I was a good writer but didn't take 
things seriously enough. So here's my rebellion, a few years too late. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, I seem to have lost the main thread here. Oh yeah, Andrew, wake up 
and smell the coffee. I ain't gettin' in touch with my &quot;female side.&quot;
It sounds  suspiciously illegal at the least, amoral at the best, and completely
disgusting. How  can I maintain my intensely macho image otherwise? 
</P>
<P>For those interested in seeing more of my &quot;female side,&quot; address
your  correspondence in a plain brown wrapper. 
</P>
<P>BTW, me and my less female side will be making a smashing debut at the East 
Coast Katemas party with a version of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; that I've
been  working on that guarantees to send all purists Running For The Hills.
Bring your  audio and/or video recorders and don't miss out on this once in a
lifetime  performance art spectacular. It promises to be more than I can handle.
Joe Turner  is helping out with this, although he just found out about it by
reading this sentence.  The audience is requested to bring oil drums, coke
bottles and anything else that  would make a large percussive crash.
