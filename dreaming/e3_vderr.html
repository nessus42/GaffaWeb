    <P>From: Andrew Marvick (IED) </P>
    
    <P>At least two Love-Hounds have privately requested that IED itemize the
      errors in Mayes and Cann's Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary which IED
      recently alluded to. IED will not call attention here to the many
      grammatical errors in the book; nor will he list the many statements--most
      of them to do with Kate's childhood--which are simply rehashed from the
      collection of suspect hearsay originally found in Fred Vermorel's first
      book about Kate, Princess of Suburbia. These statements are derived from
      the &quot;recollections&quot; of former &quot;schoolfriends&quot;--who
      remain for the most part unidentified--as told originally to arch-jerk and
      -slime Fred Vermorel, and as such they should be given no more weight than
      their dubious provenance merits. </P>
    
    <P>To be fair, IED should add that the book contains a large number of
      interesting facts and observations--the book has many good qualities. That
      said, here is a list of 39 errors of fact and untenable opinions which
      Mayes and Cann offer their innocent and unsuspecting readers: </P>
    
    <P>On page 12 a detail from a group photograph of Kate's class at St.
      Joseph's Convent Grammar School, Abbey Wood is almost certainly not a
      photograph of Kate Bush, but of some other unidentified girl. A careful
      look at the entire photograph, showing all the girls in the class, reveals
      that Kate, by this time a senior student at the school, is in fact
      standing in the back (highest) row, next to her friend Lisa. This mistake
      is under-standable, because it was made before in earlier sources, but
      readers should be aware of the error. </P>
    
    <P>On pages 17 and 94 the statement that the song Maybe &quot;has never
      appeared&quot; is not strictly speaking correct. Although the version
      referred to on these pages has yet to be heard, part of an earlier
      recording of that early song, with David Gilmour himself on guitar, was
      briefly played by Kate on BBC radio in 1978 or 1979. </P>
    
    <P>On page 19: &quot;...other members of the KT Bush Band were completely
      excluded &lt;from the TKI sessions&gt;. (Kate later brought them back into
      the fold for the tour, and after that they joined her in the studio for
      subsequent albums.)&quot; This is not accurate. Kate actually fought for
      and won the right to bring in the entire KT Bush Band (Charlie Morgan,
      Brian Bath, Paddy Bush and Del Palmer) for the recording of two tracks
      from Lionheart ( Wow and Kashka From Baghdad ). </P>
    
    <P>On page 20: &quot; Moving is a strange but beautiful song in which (as
      in many songs) she seems to be clasping a lover to her with one arm while
      pushing him away with the other...&lt;More in a similar vein.&gt;&quot;
      While all this is hard to dispute outright, Mayes's and Cann's analysis of
      this song makes clear their ignorance of the fact that Moving is a tribute
      to Lindsay Kemp, an innovative mime, dancer and choreographer who
      intro-duced Kate to the world of movement as an expressive element in her
      art. </P>
    
    <P>On page 21: &quot; James and the Cold Gun is a jaunty rock song about a
      cowboy (Jesse James?)...&quot; This is false. Kate has stated
      categorically that the James in her song refers to no particular
      historical or fictional character. </P>
    
    <P>On page 28: &quot;They &lt;Kate's family&gt; all write for The Club
      magazine...&quot; Actually only John's brothers Paddy and John have
      contributed to the Newsletter (unless one counts a ten-word-long thankyou
      note from Hannah several years back). </P>
    
    <P>On page 37: &quot;18th-21st February 1979. Kate visits Leysin in
      Switzerland to record appearances for a BBC-inspired European television
      showcase. The only footage to survive is a video of Kate's following
      single Wow, but this was never broadcast either.&quot; Actually it was
      broadcast, on the very programme in question! It is known among fans as
      the Abba Easter Special version of Wow. The other performance from the
      Swiss taping session was an outdoor lip-synch of Wuthering Heights which
      Kate performed in the Alpine snow. This version, it's true enough, has
      never been released--it was originally scheduled to be included in the
      second Abba special (a Christmas follow-up to the Easter show called the
      Winter Snowtime Special ), but shortly before airtime Kate replaced it
      with a hastily taped lip-synch of December Will Be Magic Again. </P>
    
    <P>On page 44: &quot;&lt;For the live performances of Hammer Horror &gt;
      Kate, in widow's weeds and a black veil, was manhandled in a vigorous
      dance routine--performed to the record...&quot; False: Kate went to extra
      time and expense to re-record the song for the stage performance, partly
      in order to avoid problems with the Musicians' Union concerning the use of
      taped music. The sound of the Tour version is clearly more &quot;live&quot;
      than that on the album </P>
    
    <P>On page 45: &quot;The two bars of 6/8 time at the beginning of Symphony
      in Blue were also extended &lt;for the Tour&gt; as a long waltz intro...&quot;
      Mayes and Cann are confusing the live intro for Kite, apparently, for the
      intro for Symphony in Blue. The latter song has a quite different sort of
      live introduction in the Tour performances. </P>
    
    <P>On page 48 Kate's abbreviation of the Stockholm show is ascribed to &quot;voice
      strain&quot;. Actually she had come down with a bad flu which necessitated
      shortening not only this show but the Copenhagen, Hamburg and Amsterdam
      shows which followed. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 48 (in the margin): &quot;Recordings of the &lt;13th May
      Hammersmith Odeon&gt; show were also released on record.&quot; This
      implies that a live album of the entire show was released, when in fact
      only four songs, carefully re-mixed and overdubbed, from that performance
      were ever officially released, in the form of an EP called On Stage. </P>
    
    <P>Also in the margin, page 48: &quot;Kate turns down the offer of writing
      the theme tune for the new James Bond movie of the day, Moonraker ...&quot;
      Kate was never asked to write the theme tune for that film, only to sing
      the lead vocal of John Barry's theme tune, which had already been written.
      Kate praised Barry's song as &quot;beautiful&quot;, but &quot;not right&quot;
      for her. She also praised the recording which was eventually made with
      Shirley Bassey. </P>
    
    <P>On page 51 it is suggested that Kate's comments about the dangers of
      accidents during a bank heist, made in an interview in reference to the
      song There Goes a Tenner, offered possible insight into Kate's reluctance
      to tour. There is no connection between these two subjects. </P>
    
    <P>On page 57 Mayes and Cann claim that Kate identifies with the cat in the
      second verse of Egypt. Actually, the character is a.) not Kate, but a very
      different personality invented for the song, and b.) not symbolized by a
      cat, but enthralled by the image of the ancient Egyptian Sphynx--a very
      different situation, one which has a bearing on the theme of the song.
    </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 57: &quot; The Wedding List may have come straight out of a
      newspaper--but was the whole story there or did she read about the first
      killing and dream up the revenge to get something out of her system?&quot;
      Kate did not get the subject of this song from newspapers, nor did she
      invent the idea of the protagonist's revenge. The entire story is closely
      based on the plot of a film by Francois Truffaut called La Mariee etait en
      noir, or The Bride Wore Black. In fact, when Kate performed the song in
      her Christmas special of 1979, she reproduced almost frame for frame the
      initial assassina-tion scene from the movie, and changed little from the
      original aside from shifting the setting from modern times to the Old
      West. </P>
    
    <P>On page 60: &quot;The moral of these tales &lt;the songs in Never For
      Ever &gt; is, there is nothing you cannot change if you try hard enough.&quot;
      This is a highly disputable assumption. As far as IED is aware, Kate has
      never said any such thing. </P>
    
    <P>On page 61: &quot;The first verse &lt;of December Will Be Magic Again,
      in its final vinyl version&gt; is a humdrum Christmas mixture...&quot;
      Nothing could be further from the truth! The first part of this recording
      is sheer magic. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 61: &quot;In the second verse--'Light the candle lights to
      conjure Mister Wilde'--she settles down in her den with a Christmas
      present: The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde perhaps, published in 1976.&quot;
      Aside from the fact that complete editions of Wilde's work had appeared
      well before 1976, Mayes and Cann could have discovered, had they done
      their homework, that Kate's love of the fairy tales of Oscar Wilde dates
      from her early childhood. She has said so on several occasions. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 61: &quot;The B-side, Warm and Soothing is a gentle but
      unsentimental portrait of an elderly married couple with Kate wondering
      how her ideas of love will weather in old age.&quot; This interpretation
      is problematic, and Kate herself has never said anything of the sort about
      it. Also, the song's &quot;gentleness&quot; is highly deceptive, in IED's
      opinion. </P>
    
    <P>On page 65, in reference to the 1982 Prince's Trust Gala performance of
      The Wedding List, often (foolishly) remembered for the moment when the
      strap of Kate's top broke during midsong, Mayes and Cann write: &quot;She
      ended her performance clutching her bosom and improvising choreography.&quot;
      Untrue. She clutched only the strap, not her bosom, and not only did Kate
      not improvise choreography for the end of the performance--there was no
      choreography for the performance at all! Kate began and ended the song
      more or less standing still. Unnecessary sensationalism. </P>
    
    <P>On page 67: Suspended in Gaffa is likened to this verse from Gilbert and
      Sullivan's Nightmare Song, in Iolanthe: &quot;Well this you can't stand so
      you throw up your hands/And you find you're as old as an icicle/ In your
      shirt and your socks--the black silk with gold clocks/Crossing Salisbury
      Plain on a bicycle.&quot; IED has listened to the passage in question, and
      sees only a generic similarity which could as easily be found to exist
      between Kate's song and dozens of other waltz-time popular songs of the
      late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. And the lyrics are wholly
      unreleated to those of Suspended. </P>
    
    <P>On page 68: &quot;Kate has solved the problem &lt;of foreign buyers
      misunder-standing her lyrics&gt; by insisting the lyrics are printed on
      every album.&quot; Yet lyrics are not included in The Whole Story, nor for
      most of her b-sides. </P>
    
    <P>On page 69, in reference to Night of the Swallow: &quot;Using cinematic
      images she shows us a man of the gun about to migrate like a bird and she
      pleads with him not to leave her. Kate treads carefully in politics but
      she can feel her way into the subject through the personal angle. She
      returns to the problem of a woman's loyalty in Mother Stands for Comfort .&quot;
      Kate has said that she intended no political implications at all in Night
      of the Swallow. Nor has she ever described the man in the song as a &quot;man
      of the gun&quot;. On the contrary, he is a pilot who has been hired to fly
      on a completely unspecified dangerous, possibly illegal, mission at night.
      There is no sign that the pilot totes a gun. Furthermore the woman is
      anxious only for the man's safety--loyalty is not at issue in the song, as
      it is in Mother Stands for Comfort. </P>
    
    <P>On page 70 some completely inappropriate and irrelevant stuff about the
      sterility of mules is posited by the authors, in reference to the end of
      Get Out of My House. Since so much has been said in Love-Hounds already
      about this subject, IED will not repeat Mayes's and Cann's wildly
      off-the-mark observations here, but will only comment that Kate herself
      has made it abundantly clear that the reference to the mule was intended
      to have no sexual connotation of any kind. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 70, in the margin: &quot;Kate also records one track with
      The Chieftains ( Night of the Swallow ) on a brief trip to Dublin.&quot;
      Not The Chieftains, but Bill Whelan, Donal Lunny, Liam O'Flynn and Sean
      Keane, played on this track. </P>
    
    <P>On page 72: &quot;These contract-release gestures &lt;in Kate's routine
      for The Man With the Child in His Eyes &gt; are again straight out of a
      contemporary dance class...&quot; Not true at all. Some of the basic
      movements are perhaps rudimentary, but there is not one movement in even
      Kate's earliest routines which is not made for a directly relevant
      expressive or narrative purpose. Snide criticism such as Cann's and
      Mayes's above only betrays their own ignorance of the sophistication of
      Kate's choreo-graphic vision. </P>
    
    <P>On page 73 (and elsewhere), the authors refer to Kate's longtime dance
      partners Stewart Avon-Arnold and the late Gary Hurst (both black) as &quot;boys&quot;.
      Since they were unmistakably men even from the time of their earliest
      collaborations with Kate, IED cannot help but find this terminology
      offensive, to say the least! </P>
    
    <P>On page 76: &quot;From the first her writing was extraordinarily mature
      but she took time to realise the potential of video, unlike Bowie who was
      quick to grasp the possibilities of the medium but slower in developing
      real songwriting maturity...&quot; IED will overlook the stunningly false
      assertions about Bowie's development as a songwriter, and will merely
      comment that Kate's slowness to &quot;realise the potential of video&quot;
      is a matter for extended debate; and is anyway quite unfair, since Kate
      was virtually the first artist to make promotional videos to accompany
      singles' releases at all ! The truth is that by the time the rest of the
      industry had begun making videos at all (early 1980) Kate had already been
      making highly original and enormously expressive videos for well over a
      year. </P>
    
    <P>On page 78 Mayes and Cann interpret a line from Under the Ivy (&quot;I
      sit here in the thunder/The green on the grey/I feel it all around me&quot;)
      as some kind of low bathroom joke: &quot;She may smile at the line 'I sit
      here in the thunder'--the thunder-box was an old-fashioned privy or
      lavatory...&quot; Judged within the context of the song as a whole and
      especially the line &quot;I feel it &lt;the thunder&gt; all around me&quot;,
      there can be no question of any such utterly irrelevant and stupidly
      scatological symbolism. Such an interpretation reveals far more about
      Mayes and Cann than it does about Kate's song. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 78: &quot;In due course &lt; Hounds of Love &gt; went
      double platinum &lt;in England&gt;.&quot; Well before Mayes and Cann
      published their book the album had already attained triple platinum
      status, and at this point it has already reached quadruple platinum status
      in the UK. </P>
    
    <P>On page 79, Kate's reference in The Big Sky to those who &quot;look down
      at the ground, missing&quot; is interpreted as an allusion to journalists
      who &quot;thought she was too wide-eyed, too Gosh! and Golly! Too Wow !&quot;
      There is nothing in this song to lead us to believe that it is intended to
      be autobiographical, and Kate has often cautioned listeners of her music
      not to confuse the narrators in her songs with herself. </P>
    
    <P>On page 80: &quot;The serene voice &lt;in Cloudbusting &gt; soars above
      a low string quartet.&quot; Del Palmer and Kate both made it clear in
      their respective Newsletter accounts of the recording sessions for this
      track that the part was written by Kate, on Fairlight, expressly for
      string sextet, and that subsequently six string parts were recorded. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 80: &quot;The cover photo for The Ninth Wave (taken by
      Kate's brother Jay &lt;John Carder Bush&gt;) is Ophelia in a
      life-jacket--a young woman floating in water, strewn with wild plants and
      with her hair flowing about her. This was inspired by a celebrated
      Pre-Raphaelite painting by John Everett Millais.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Although the picture does strongly recall Millais's 1852 vision of
      Ophelia; and although we know that Kate herself greatly admired both that
      painting and a modern re-interpretation of it which hangs on her own wall;
      and although (as IED learned through conversation with John) Kate's
      brother is highly knowledgeable about Pre-Raphaelite imagery, nevertheless
      we should believe Kate's own statement that Millais's Ophelia was not in
      their minds when they created the photos for The Ninth Wave. Perhaps it's
      an example of unconscious influence, but IED for one would prefer to take
      Kate's word for it. </P>
    
    <P>On page 81, the &quot;little light&quot; in The Ninth Wave is
      interpreted as simply a metaphorical reference to &quot;love and life &lt;which&gt;
      lights up her face.&quot; In fact, the &quot;little light&quot;, while
      possibly a symbol for these things, is, in narrative terms, a reference to
      a lighthouse. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 81: &quot;'White horses' and 'buoy' are sea images but they
      carry overtones of sex.&quot; They do? How so? This is absurd. </P>
    
    <P>Also on the same page, Mayes and Cann dredge up the completely false
      interpretation of the words &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;cutting
      out little lines&quot; and &quot;snow&quot; as references to cocaine. The
      same interpretation was foisted on Kate by a bullying male Irish
      journalist for Hot Press in 1985, and Kate categorically denied that the
      imagery was ever intended to represent such a thing. She acknowledged that
      the image of the opium poppies in the song was a drug-related symbol, but
      pointed out that it referred to the motif of sleep, not drug-taking in a
      literal sense, and that anyway this had nothing to do with cocaine. And
      she explained that the references to snow, ice and the cutting of lines
      were clearly intended to describe the scene in the song, wherein the
      protagonist remembers skating as a little girl. </P>
    
    <P>On page 82 there is an entirely untraced and unidentified quote from
      Kate of her memories of a moment when her own mother allegedly fainted and
      had an out-of-body experience. There have been other similarly
      unidentified &quot;quotes&quot; from Kate, mostly about her childhood,
      which have turned out to be the spurious &quot;memories&quot; of anonymous
      so-called former schoolfriends. IED concedes that it is quite possible
      that this particular quote is authentic, but it could just as easily be
      fabricated. Anyway, it's completely unfamiliar to this fan. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 82: &quot;The end of &lt; The Morning Fog &gt;--and of this
      momentous album--is abrupt and inconsequential, as if cut off.&quot; IED
      doesn't see any reason for such a characterization of the last measures of
      this song. The ending is unemphatic, perhaps, but not really &quot;abrupt&quot;,
      and certainly not &quot;inconsequential&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>On page 84, in describing Kate's performance in the official video for
      Running Up That Hill: &quot;For the first time on screen she is appearing,
      not as the subject of a promotion but as an element in the drama.&quot;
      This is blatantly untrue. The RUTH video is neither more nor less &quot;promotional&quot;
      than any of Kate's earlier videos. From EMI's point of view, of course,
      all of Kate's videos are valuable primarily as promotional tools, and RUTH
      was quite successful--particularly in Europe--as such. From Kate's point
      of view, however, RUTH was just another in a long line of more or less
      modest visual accompaniments to her songs, and her concern with this video
      as with all its predecessors was to make a work of artistic value,
      something which complements and with luck enlarges upon the expressive
      content of the music itself. </P>
    
    <P>The above litany might seem to indicate that IED does not think well of
      A Visual Documentary. That's not true. In fact, he considers most of the
      above errors to be relatively minor ones, and there are after all not
      terribly many of them. The book is for the most part quite accurate; it's
      well organized, according to a carefully detailed chronology; and it's
      filled with interesting and for the most part reliable points. In addition
      the book contains one of the best collections of candid photographs of and
      relating to Kate Bush that one can find anywhere. So long as readers are
      made aware of the above inaccuracies, IED thinks they will be well served
      by A Visual Documentary. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Error in Visual Documentary </P>
    
    <P>Hello all. I recently acquired a copy of Kate Bush: A Visual
      Documentary, and have found an error that is was not listed in IED's known
      errors posting some time back. I thought that those who have the book
      would like to know about it. </P>
    
    <P>On page 67 the authors discuss Suspended In Gaffa. After this discussion
      there is a paragraph (it is the second paragraph from the bottom) in which
      they assert that this track was the only one to feature Dave Gilmour on
      backing vocals. Clearly this is an error, as Gilmour featured on Pull Out
      The Pin. I feel that this is a case of a misplaced paragraph, rather than
      a more serious error on the part of the authors, but I thought you would
      all like to know about it. </P>
