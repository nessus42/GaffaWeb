    <P>Actually, 'Castaway', which opened this year's London Film Festival, was
      directed by NICHOLAS ROEG ( Man Who Fell to Earth, Insignificance, Bad
      Timing etc.) and NOT Ken Russell! However, Russell did direct the film
      'Gothic' which closed the London Film Festival! </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, 'Castaway' does star Ollie Reed (as Gerald Kingsland) and Amanda
      Donohoe (as Lucy Irving). I have only seen clips so I cannot comment on
      the Kate connection but can confirm that the aforementioned Ms Donohoe
      seems to have forgotten to pack a suitcase when she went to the island!
    </P>
    
    <P>Gothic stars Gabriel Byrne (Defence of the Realm) as Byron, Julian Sands
      (Room with a View) as Shelley and Natasha Richardson (daughter of Vanessa
      Redgrave) as Mary Shelley - in addition to some baboons (sounds like a
      fairly typical Russell movie)! The music is by Thomas Dolby. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Castaway </P>
    
    <P>I saw 'Castaway' at the weekend and can confirm IED's information about
      Kate's contribution. She sings the song 'Be kind to my mistakes' over the
      opening credits to the film - so don't be late if you go to see it. The
      title refers to the last words Gerald Kingsland says to Lucy Irvine in the
      film. Owing to the fact that people were still groping towards their
      seats, rustling sweet papers etc. I was unable to pick up much of the
      lyrical content of the song. However, on this one cursory hearing the
      rhythm and vocal style of the song reminded me of 'Experiment IV'
      suggesting Kate was maybe working on both pieces around the same time.
      Still, what I heard I liked. </P>
    
    <P>The film itself is probably the least interesting of Roeg's work. While
      it is always pretty to look at - both the island and Ms Donahoe are
      extremely photogenic - the film lacks the sense of mystery usually present
      in Roeg's movies. Perhaps this is inevitable given that the story is so
      familiar by now. There are a few touches of Roeg magic but the
      psychological drama never develops enough to make you actually care about
      the characters. While the film just manages to avoid becoming boring it
      rarely rises above being a slightly superior drama/documentary. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Be Kind to My Mistakes </P>
    
    <P>Having spent the better part of a week listening to &quot;Be Kind to My
      Mistakes&quot; now, IED would like to make some alterations to his
      original judgment. There is a hell of a lot going on in this track. </P>
    
    <P>The most confusing and fascinating thing about it, to this listener, is
      its structure and melody. On close inspection, it seems that this song,
      which originally struck IED as being very simple and filled with repeats,
      is actually made up of at least eleven separate sections, which are
      themselves made up of no fewer than twenty smaller units. Furthermore, the
      sections are not all of regular length (i.e., four or eight bars each),
      but run into each other prematurely, so to speak, especially as the track 
      progresses. Roughly analyzed, it proceeds something like this: </P>
    
    <P> I. Introduction
      <BR> a. four bars, rhythm only;
      <BR> b. four bars, chorus added;
      <BR> c. four bars, rhythm only;
      <BR> d. four bars, different, crescendo chorus; </P>
    
    <P> II. Refrain motif (&quot;It is this which brings us together&quot;),
      four bars 2x; </P>
    
    <P> III. First verse (&quot;It's all right, darling...&quot;)
      <BR> a. 9-bar first section (four-bar figure stated once, repeated with
      an extra bar);
      <BR> b. 4-bar second section (&quot;You don't know me...&quot;);
      <BR> c. 4-bar third section (&quot;It is this that...&quot;); </P>
    
    <P> IV. Refrain repeat, 8 bars (&quot;It is this that...&quot; 2x); </P>
    
    <P> V. Second &quot;verse&quot; (chord progression changed from III. so as
      to accomodate simultaneous superimposition of the refrain (IV.)
      <BR> &quot;I don't know what you are...&quot;, 8 bars; </P>
    
    <P> VI. Vocal bridge (&quot;In your life, in my life, there are secrets...&quot;),
      12 bars; </P>
    
    <P> VII. Instrumental bridge (rhythm guitar replaced by minimal &quot;solo&quot;
      guitar fills), 12 bars; </P>
    
    <P>VIII. Restatement of II.a. (&quot;It's all right...&quot;), with slight
      changes, figure stated three times (total of 10 bars); </P>
    
    <P> IX. Vocal &quot;climax&quot; (&quot;Please...&quot; with background &quot;Ooh-ay-ooh&quot;)
      stated four times (3 bars, 3 bars, 3 bars, 2 bars); </P>
    
    <P> X. Extended vocal coda (&quot;Be kind...be kind...&quot;) with new
      unresolved chord progression, 4x4 bars; </P>
    
    <P> XI. Fade-out (&quot;lum....lum...lum...&quot;), 6 to 8 bars (ending
      obscured by LP producer's ill-advised retention of film soundtrack's
      super-imposed fade-in of Stanley Meyers's music over Kate's extremely
      unusual fade-out). </P>
    
    <P>Finally, IED's earlier suspicion that Kate sang a note off-key (though
      in a mellifluous way) has been dispelled by the realization that the same
      note is repeated very deliberately twice more in the same section (VI.).
      It is definitely a part of the intended melody. </P>

      <BR> From: ganzer%trout@nosc.mil (Mark T. Ganzer)
      <BR> Subject: Be Kind to My Mistakes </P>
    
    <P>For something that was written fairly quickly, &quot;Be Kind to My
      Mistakes&quot; is GREAT! It has elements of structure quite similar to X4
      but with the energy of &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. In fact the structure is
      so similar to X4 that I would have to speculate that they were both
      written at approximately the same time. The tempo (140 beats/min) is the
      same, the rhythm patterns are not the same but similar in effect, and the
      use of single bar guitar &quot;loops&quot; is the same. But BKtMM has a
      much stronger base rhythm, and adds single bar bass &quot;loops&quot; ( a
      beautiful effect by Del on the fretless bass). There is definitly a lot of
      music there. IED gave a good breakdown of the song, but I have some
      additional comments: </P>
    
    <P> a) The 16 bar intro builds the layers of the music, starting with a
      basic percussion, bass, and keyboard rhythm in the first 4 bars, then
      adding background chorus in the next 4 bars. The 3rd 4 bar segment adds
      the guitar, and the 4th segment combines them all. </P>
    
    <P> b) In the vocal climax, when the 4 bar pattern is cut to 3 bars, to
      heighten the climax, the basic 2-4-and rhythm is changed twice to a strong
      3-and-4 pattern twice and then to a 2-and and-4-and pattern once two bars
      later. A very nice effect to heighten the climax. </P>
    
    <P> c) During the extended vocal coda, layers of the music are being lifted
      as the chord progression breaks down. </P>
    
    <P> d) During the fade-out, it almost sounds as if the the rhythm of the
      right and left channels looses synch (this is very apparent with
      headphones). It almost sounds as if everything is coming apart, yet when
      listening to each individual channel, the rhythm stays together to the
      end! </P>

      <BR> It is this that brings us together (It is this that brings us
      together)
      <BR> (It is this that brings us together) </P>
    
    <P>I don't know what you are lookin' for in me
      <BR> I don't know what I want, but my heart is needy </P>
    
    <P>In [my or your eyes], in your mind
      <BR> We'll find all we're meant to find
      <BR> In your life, in my life
      <BR> There are secrets too dark to let out,
      <BR> To let go out, to get over </P>
    
    <P>That's all right, baby
      <BR> Oh, that's all right by me
      <BR> Cause, it's all right now </P>
    
    <P>Just let me say pleee-ease, pleee-ease,
      <BR> pleee-ease, pleee-ease </P>
    
    <P>Be kind, be kind to my mistakes
      <BR> Be kind, be kind to me </P>
    
    <P>The phrase in the brackets [] is very run together and impossible to
      separate even at greatly reduced playback speeds. Probably Kate's way of
      allowing multiple interpretations of the song by filling in the blank
      yourself. Still, this song was much easier to transcribe than &quot;Not
      This Time&quot;. </P>

      that sounds like: &quot;Am I yours, and you're mine/We'll find all we're

      young woman answers, and the two strangers do go off and spend a long time
      together alone on the island. Oliver Reed is the man, Amanda Donahue
      (Donahoe?) the woman. It's directed by Nicholas Roeg, one of Kate's

    <P> &quot;Castaway&quot; is out, and IED gives it thumbs up. Kate's song is
      edited in three places and is faded out early so that it can be fit into
      the title sequence, but at least it's there. </P>
    
    <P>IED doesn't remember where he got the info from (someone in L-Hs, he
      thinks), but anyway his previous notice that &quot;Be kind to my mistakes&quot;
      is the last remark made by Lucy, the heroine in the movie, is wrong. It's
      the second to the last line that the MAN, Oliver Reed's character, says to
      her, anticipating the future publication of her memoirs about the year she
      had just completed alone with him on a desert island. Which of course
      changes the whole meaning of Kate's song sufficiently to warrant renewed
      study. </P>
    
    <P>Not for the first time has Kate chosen to write from or for the man's

      see life from the other side of the chromosomes, so to speak. Other songs
      which represent the same kind of fascination with (and, it should be
      added, sympathy for) male gender roles and male psychology in general,
      although possibly told from a neutral or female point of view, include &quot;The

    <P>I think I grabbed the copy of the lyrics for this from the archives (I

      was in doubt about, and is indeed mistaken on. Transcriber's line went
      something like &quot;In my eyes, or your mind&quot; (I don't have it in
      front of me). Correct line is &quot;Am I yours, are you mine?&quot;
      (continues &quot;we'll find all we're meant to find&quot;). </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: Be Kind To My Mistakes </P>
    
    <P>Once again Drukman is late and wrong. IED pointed out these differences
      over a week ago. To be specific, there are three abridgements of the
      recording (in addition to the changes to the mix itself). The first is in
      the introduction: the Castaway soundtrack-album version (as opposed to the
      version heard in the film itself--that version was also radically
      abridged) begins with eight bars of instrumental introduction, which
      precede the point where the new mix begins. </P>
    
    <P>Then, after the first verse, and the return of the choral backing phrase
      &quot;It is this...&quot;, another eight bars have been removed.</P>
    
    <P>Finally, after the central refrain the original version contains a full
      sixteen measures of instrumental interlude, and all of these have been
      removed in the new mix. </P>
    
    <P>In total, slightly over a minute of music has been deleted. These
      changes, however, you will all see, do not remove any of the song itself;
      rather, they have the effect of streamlining the recording and increasing
      the forward momentum of the narrative. Kate probably did this edit after
      she shortened the original mix for the opening-credits sequence of the
      film itself, deciding that the song actually benefited from the cuts.
      There are virtues to both versions, and the cuts are no reason for the
      kind of knee-jerk complaining we have seen from Drukman. </P>
    
    <P>Contrary to Drukman's claim, the fadeout of the new version is actually
      longer than that one hears on the Castaway LP. The discrepancy in the coda
      of the song which Drukman (again) so carelessly listened to consists of
      changes to the final &quot;lum-lum-lum&quot; (or whatever) notes which
      Kate sings at that point. In the original mix (in addition to the other
      changes in the balance and timbre of the various instrumental and backup
      vocal tracks) this lead-vocal motif receives an interesting echo treatment
      that floats above the instrumental fadeout. </P>
    
    <P>In the new version, Kate's vocal is left nearly untreated, and both the
      timbre of the vocal and the rhythmic/harmonic line of the fadeout are
      changed thereby. On the other hand, in the new version one can hear a new
      intricacy in the rhythm tracks toward the end, which were rendered
      virtually inaudible in both the film mix and the soundtrack album mix.

      <BR> Subject: The answer to the Be Kind To My Mistakes question!? </P>
    
    <P> I talked to Andrew Marvick today and he says he had an answer to the
      question, which he had originally heard from someone else. The question I
      had posed was what did Kate mean by &quot;this&quot; in the line: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It is this that brings us together.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>in the song Be Kind To My Mistakes. Andrew's theory is that at the
      begining and at the end of the song the background vocals say &quot;love&quot;,
      which is what the line refers to. Also, near the end of the song, it seems
      that maybe they spell out L-O-L-O-, which could be them &quot;spelling out&quot;
      love. </P>

    <P>[Note: Not clearly reflected in this section is the fact that the
      version of &quot;Be Kind To My Mistakes&quot; on the USA CDEP Aspects Of
      The Sensual World and in the This Woman's Work Box Set is severly edited,
      and is *NOT* the same version as on the Castaway soundtrack. Any Kate fan
      who happens across a Castaway soundtrack in any form (LP or cassette) is
      highly urged to pick it up, no matter what kind of shape it's in. It's the
      only way you'll be able to hear this glorious song in its entirety. VM]
