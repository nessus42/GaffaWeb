<P>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 85 19:34:12 EST <BR> From: hsut@purdue-ecn.ARPA (Bill
Hsu) <BR> Subject: And Dream Of Sheep + Hello Earth
</P>
<P>SOME UNOBSERVANT OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE 
</P>
<P>OF TWO KATE BUSH SONGS 
</P>
<P>A long time ago, I foolishly suggested that it would be fun to do some
thematic  analyses of Kate Bush songs. Somebody (jer?) suggested as candidates
And Dream of  Sheep and Hello Earth, since most people thought they shared
musical material but  were unable to say exactly where. Well, here's what I
dredged up. The comments  are mostly on musical themes and motifs. 
</P>
<P>So are the two songs similar? Well, yes and no. The similarities are more
subtle  than the direct quoting of musical phrases. Generally, I'd say Kate Bush
used a  surprising economy of means in these two songs to achieve very varied
effects. The  two songs are in the same key (C# minor, occasionally moving into
E major) and are  similar in harmony also. 
</P>
<P>And Dream of Sheep is mainly composed of five main phrases: (there are 
different ways to break them up, but this is how I did it) 
</P>
<P>(1) The open fifths of &quot;Little light shining...guide them to me&quot;.
The first passage  goes E E (5th) B, B (5th) F# etc. The first chord is a C#
minor 7th (C# E G# B) and  contributes to the tense, mysterious quality of the
opening. 
</P>
<P>(2) &quot;My face is... (repeated)&quot;. This is a relatively calm phrase,
consisting mostly of  repeated E's. 
</P>
<P>(3) &quot;If they find me...for a buoy&quot;. Another calm phrase,
alternating mostly  between B and G#. 
</P>
<P>(4) &quot;Let me be weak...of sheep&quot;. Quiet descending figures, ending
in E major. 
</P>
<P>The first break in the song has the female voice saying &quot;Come here,
(name)&quot;. (1)  is then repeated and extended with variations (&quot;I'll
wake up...a seeking craft&quot;. Call  this (1a).) Then we have (2), (3), (3)
again, but truncated (&quot;I'll tune into...&quot; and &quot;I  can't be left
to...&quot;). A repeat of (4) leads to the first new material for awhile. 
</P>
<P>(5) &quot;Ooh their breath...&quot; Open 6th's. A short phrase is repeated
as a kind of  coda. 
</P>
<P>The opening of Hello Earth is very similar to that of ADOS. The first phrase
 &quot;Hello Earth Hello Earth&quot; is over the same chord as ADOS (C# minor
7th) tho the  theme is slightly changed. Hello Earth goes G# G# B, C# C# F#,
while ADOS goes  E E B, B B F#. I'd like to associate the chord and the thematic
material with some  kind of &quot;contemplation&quot; motif. It opens the two
songs on Ninth Wave which are  about the narrator contemplating her surroundings
rather than hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>Hello Earth is much looser in construction than ADOS. Division of themes are
 not as clearcut as ADOS, so roughly here are the artificial divisions: 
</P>
<P>(1) &quot;Hello Earth ... peek-a-boo little earth&quot;. Notice the &quot;blot
you out out...&quot; motif  (C# E G# B) which returns often in the song. 
</P>
<P>Part of (1) is repeated; &quot;With just my heart...asleep at the seat&quot;
has the same  thematic material as &quot;With just one hand...little earth&quot;.

</P>
<P>(2) &quot;I get out of... travelling fast&quot;. Open fifths again. 
</P>
<P>(3) &quot;Look at it go (twice)&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The first break in Hello Earth is again achieved with an non-Kate voice, the
 chorus that will return at the end of the song. Compare the &quot;Come here...&quot;
passage  in ADOS. 
</P>
<P>(1) is repeated with variations for &quot;Hello Earth, Hello Earth, watching
 storms...the wind out to sea&quot;. Then there is a passage constructed of
variations on  C# D# E B (&quot;All you...etc&quot;). I see this as a
combination of the open 5th motif of the  opening of ADOS and the &quot;blot you
out out&quot; phrase (C# E G# B). 
</P>
<P>(2) with all its rhythmic rigor and open fifths is repeated for &quot;Go to
sleep...head  of the tempest&quot;. A short connecting phrase (&quot;Murderer...&quot;)
and then a repetition of  (3) for &quot;Why did I go...&quot;. 
</P>
<P>So there are definitely similarities. The upward leap of a fifth is an
important  motif, along with the C# minor 7th chord as both harmony and melodic
line (in  arpeggiated form). Both songs are in the same key, and the harmony is
rather  similar. While the songs were not terribly complex, the way Kate Bush
uses a  limited amount of material to achieve her many different effects is
interesting.

</P>
<P>Without his D-5 in the computer room to confirm, IED can only assume that
you  are referring to the &quot;shipping report&quot; in &quot;And Dream of
Sheep&quot;. No-one has  deciphered all of that message, but an Irish (or
Scottish?) fan suggested that part of  it was a list of coastal areas and
islands along the shipping lanes between Ireland and  Scotland (see
Break-Through issue 10 or 11, IED believes). The message may say  something
like: &quot;Attention all ships, especially sea navigators (?)....Bell Rock... 
Tyree...&quot; etc. (This is not supposed to be an accurate transcription, just
an idea of  what to listen for.)

bst <BR> Subject: Re: secret message in &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; 
</P>
<P>The message does appear to be some kind of shipping report. I can make out
the  following: 
</P>
<P> Attention shipping information in sea areas .... Bell Rock, Tiree, <BR>
Cromaty, gale east .... .... , Malin, Sellafield .... .... 
</P>
<P>Now the thing is, they are not all sea areas. Cromaty and Malin are but the
rest  are all coastal stations or light vessels. The BBC issues weather reports
for the sea  areas and coastal stations but keeps them quite separate. Also they
are clearly  referenced with the date and time of day. In addition there is a
forecast for the areas  they mention. In the 'And Dream of Sheep' piece the only
meteorological term I  can pick out is the word gale. Now without any reference
to the force or future  direction this information is useless. There may
possibly be some meteorological  term preceding 'Bell Rock' but it is unclear to
my ears. 
</P>
<P>Neither are all the mentioned names from the same area of the coast. Bell
Rock  is on the east coast as is the Cromaty sea area. The others are on the
west coast of  Scotland or (in the case of Sellafield) England. The Malin sea
area is between  Scotland and Ireland. The lack of meteorological data in the
snippet makes me doubt  that it was an actual broadcast - unless Kate edited it
to just leave the names.

</P>
<P> ...gale easterly (&quot;Come here with me, Luv&quot; obliterates this),
Malin... 
</P>
<P>This sounds like it is a warning of gale easterly winds in the Cromaty area
based  on reports from ships in the area and the Bell Rock and Tiree stations,
and then  continuing on to reports from the Malin and Sellafield areas. Not
having UK marine  navigation maps nor having listened to any weather or marine
broadcasts from over  there, I can't comment on it's validity or whether it is
an actual broadcast or not. It  could possibly be a radio report from a shipping
company to all it's ships at sea. Most  likey this passage was simulated to &quot;sound
like&quot; something someone had heard on  the shortwave (or LW band?) and that
fit with the musical passage.

</P>
<P>I have always wondered what the little light was referring to. I think the
light  before someone dies is more than obvious, which leads me to believe that
it's not  that light. Kate tends to be a little bit more obscure. I had thought
maybe it was the  light from a farrie, you know like tinkerbell, taking kate
into a different dimension.  I also considered it to be Dr. Bush, using a pen
light, looking into Kate's eyes to see  if she is conscious. I've also
considered to be the moon, a flare, a lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>I've been thinking about this for the past five years (when I purchased my
first  Kate album) and am completely dumbfounded. Just a couple of thoughts.

<P>From: asteg@k12.ucs.umass.edu (Albert Steg (Winsor School)) <BR> Date: Thu,
28 Apr 1994 16:12:38 GMT <BR> Subject: Re: little light
</P>
<P>Last week in a posting about 'The Ninth Wave' I offered a summary of a the  &quot;stuck
in the water&quot; reading of the suite of songs as Kate had explained it in
various  interviews. Following the situation of a person somehow stranded in the
ocean  overnight, waiting for the dawn, the &quot;little light&quot; is the
battery-operated pen-light  attached to life-jackets to help rescuers find the
survivors. (On the back cover  photograph Kate is wearing that sort of
life-jacket.) So the line &quot;Little light guide  them to me&quot; is very
literal! &quot;White horses&quot; are the foam caps on moving waves, so  she
wants to keep moving in the water so that a plane might notice her. I think the 
image of the tiny light illuminating her face in the water is one of the
loveliest on  the record. 
</P>
<P>Of course, listeners may recognize whatever sorts of symbolic ideas appeal
to  them in the songs --but as with poetry in general, we lose a lot if we don't
grasp  the literal level of meaning first. Most good poems do involve a speaker
in a  particular settting and circumstance,which we need to see in order to get
into  &quot;deeper&quot; meanings. Getting help with the &quot;situations&quot;
in Kate's songs is, for me, one  of the best reasons for having newsgroups like
this. 
</P>
<P>One of the marvelous things about &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; is that
although there are  plenty of details that point to the person's predicament,
no-one that I know was  able to make out this situation (person stuck in the
water) without some help,  usually after getting to know the side really well.
Listening to it with the new  picture in mind is almost like getting a new Kate
Bush record!

</P>
<P>&gt; During one of the ocurrences of these &quot;pings&quot;, I can
definately hear words in  the background that sound like guys on a submarine,
and I can fairly clearly make  out the word &quot;sonar&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The vocals Chris is talking about start at about 1:31 into Under Ice in the
left  channel. I agree that the word &quot;sonar&quot; is easily
distinguishable. After much playing  with it, I've determined that it's easiest
to hear the words by dropping the low  bands on the eq. (and the right channel,
of course), but I still can't figure out what  else he is saying. 
</P>
<P>And I'd like to (I think this is the end) ask Mr. Andrew &quot;IED&quot;
Marvick what  exactly he meant by &quot;Salve Sancta Kate&quot;.

<P>I do hear a name called in the middle of 'Under Ice' and this one is most 
DEFINITELY meant as a name -- the intonation is unmistakeable. A man's voice 
calls it after she sings &quot;only me skating fast&quot; and it sounds vaguely

Subject: The Semi-Compleate Lyrics to Waking The Witch 
</P>
<P>&gt; From Dave Fetrow: 
</P>
<P>&gt; On &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; my recording (which was in the tape
machine at work  while reading this) it is definitely: &quot;Bless me father,
Bless me father for I have  sinned --- UH&quot;. However it also sounds a bit
spliced up, so maybe that wasn't the  original. 
</P>
<P>I meant the part right after that. Here's that section a little more
acurrately, as I  hear it: 
</P>
<P>PRIEST: What child? What Child? <BR> KATE: Bless me father, bless me
father, for I have sinned -- UH! 
</P>
<P>Simultaneously: <BR> KATE: Help me. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to
me, come, baby -- UH!<BR>  KATE: Red, red roses. 
</P>
<P>Simultaneously: <BR> KATE: Help me, baby. Talk too!<BR>  KATE: Red, red
roses <BR> JUDGE: I question your innocence. 
</P>
<P>Here's all the lyrics for the whole song as best as I can make them out. If
anyone  has any different ideas about what's being said, please tell me: 
</P>
<P>VOICES: Wake up. <BR> A good morning m'am. This is your early morning call.<BR>
 (Trivia note: the above line was said by Paddy talking through a phone.) <BR>
You must wake up. <BR> Wake up. <BR> Wake up, man.  Wake up, child. Pay
attention. <BR> Come on, wake up, my love. <BR> Wake up, love. <BR> They
should make the night, but see your little light's a lie. 
</P>
<P>[Simultaneously:] <BR> MAN: Sunday at nine and you're sleeping in bed?
<BR> Get up! <BR> KATE: Your ma needs a shower. Get out of bed. <BR> CHORUS:
Little light.<BR>  MAN: Can you not see that little light up there? <BR> KATE:
Where? <BR> MAN: There! <BR> KATE: Where? <BR> Over here.<BR>  You still in
bed? <BR> Wake up sleepy head. <BR> The heirs of the water are trying to get
out. <BR> We are water in the holy land of water.<BR>  Don't you know you've
kept we waiting! <BR> Look who's here to see you! 
</P>
<P>KATE: Wake, wake up. Wake up. Wake up, baby. Wake up. Wake up.  Wake, wake
up dear. 
</P>
<P>JUDGE: You won't burn. <BR> KATE: Red, red roses. <BR> JUDGE: You won't
bleed. <BR> KATE: Pinks and posies. <BR> JUDGE: Confess to me girl. <BR>
KATE: Red, red roses go down. <BR> KATE: [Indecipherable] <BR> JUDGE: Poor...
<BR> KATE: Red, red roses.<BR>  JUDGE: ... blackbird. <BR> KATE: Pinks and
posies. <BR> JUDGE: Wings in the water. <BR> KATE: Red, red roses. <BR> BOTH:
Go down. <BR> KATE: Pinks and posies.<BR>  KATE: [Indecipherable.] <BR>
PRIEST: What child? What Child? <BR> KATE: Bless me father, bless me father,
for I have sinned -- UH! 
</P>
<P>Simultaneously: <BR> KATE: Help me. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to
me, come, baby -- UH! <BR> KATE: Red, red roses. 
</P>
<P>Simultaneously: <BR> KATE: Help me, baby. Talk too! <BR> KATE: Red, red
roses. <BR> JUDGE: I question your innocence. <BR> KATE: This blackbird --
there's a stone around my leg.<BR>  JUDGE: Hah! Damn you woman! UH! Hah! <BR>
KATE: This blackbird -- there's a stone around my leg. <BR> JUDGE: What say
you, good people? <BR> GOOD PEOPLE: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! <BR> KATE: This
blackbird. <BR> JUDGE: I am responsible for your actions. <BR> KATE:

</P>
<P>Only two corrections to be made, off hand, to the transcription of the
dialogue in  &quot;Waking the Witch&quot;: The Priest asks, &quot;What is it,
child?&quot; I think, not &quot;What child,  what child?&quot; Also, in the &quot;wake-up&quot;-call
section, I thought the male voice which  screams simultaneously with the female
chorus of &quot;Your ma needs a shower. Get out  of bed!&quot; was not saying &quot;Sunday
at nine and you're sleeping in bed. Get up!&quot; Rather,  I hear: &quot;Stop
that lying and sleeping in bed. Get up!&quot;I may be wrong about the latter 
line, however. 
</P>
<P>Finally, I would like to relay the news that the promotional film for &quot;The
Big  Sky&quot; is listed as being available for licensed telecast in the May 8
(?) issue of  Billboard. Since it is extremely unlikely that &quot;The Big Sky&quot;
will be released as a  single domestically, the film will in all probability be
ignored by most video  programmers, MTV included, unless we do something about
it. Assuming everyone  here wants to see and/or record it, I urge another MTV
dial-a-thon, with the aim of  getting at least one token cable-cast of &quot;The
Big Sky&quot;. Could someone suggest a date  and time? Thanks.

</P>
<P>I think John Lorch is probably right about the harmonizer/Fairlight issue. 
There's no audible sign of the harmonizer in the vocals of &quot;Waking The
Witch&quot;, as  far as I can tell. The inquisitor's voice is distorted,
obviously, but not in the way a  harmonizer distorts. 
</P>
<P>Even with spoken rather than sung vocal sounds the harmonizer produces a
very  distinct doubling or tripling of the sound at regular intervals of pitch.
In fact, I'm  not sure a harmonizer of that kind was used anywhere on Hounds of
Love. A good  example of the sound a harmonizer makes can be heard in Gabriel's 
&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; during the bridge where the word &quot;sledge&quot; is
repeated by itself.

Subject: To harmonize or not to harmonize... 
</P>
<P>&gt; From: Andrew Marvick<BR>  &gt; I think John Lorch is probably right
about the harmonizer/Fairlight issue.  There's no audible sign of the harmonizer
in the vocals of &quot;Waking The Witch&quot;, as  far as I can tell. The
inquisitor's voice is distorted, obviously, but not in the way a  harmonizer
distorts. 
</P>
<P>A digital harmonizer can be used as a pitch shifter. This is what was done.
This is  from the mouth of Del Palmer, so it's likely to be correct. I asked him
if the judge  was done by Kate singing through a pitch-shifter, and he said
yeah. He said that they  had tried doing the voice two different ways (1) using
a harmonizer to shift the pitch  down an octave (2) playing a tape at slower
speed. He said that if he recalled  correctly, what was put on the album was the
vocals digitally pitch-shifted with a  harmonizer.

<P>&quot;Confess to me, girl!&quot;

</P>
<P>Sorry, this &quot;come&quot; business in &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; just
doesn't hold water with  IED, who is no prude, but simply can't see any clear
basis for the interpretation. As  IED sees the song, the character is asking for
help from her confessor BECAUSE  she has been accused of being a witch; the main
purpose for her confession is to  seek the protection of the Church, NOT to
admit that she is guilty. Her hope of  salvation is a metaphor for her hope for
protection --and, of course, both are forlorn. 
</P>
<P>But Doug's interpretation introduces a completely irrelevant, even
conflicting  scene, wherein the character not only confesses real sins (in the
Church's eyes,  mind you, not in IED's), but RE-ENACTS them in the confessional!
Give IED a  break, Doug!

<BR> Subject: Waking the Witch lyrics 
</P>
<P>Maybe I'm a little late on this topic, but after all this debate about what
Kate says  in &quot;Waking the Witch,&quot; I decided I would listen for myself.
Well, I don't think Kate  said &quot;Listen to me come, baby.&quot; Last night,
I put on my cd of Hounds of Love, put on  my headphones, and put the A-B repeat
function on my cd player to good use. I  listened to those few phrases over and
over, for about twenty-five times. I tried  really hard to hear what others have
been hearing, but all I could hear was this: 
</P>
<P>Listen to me <BR> Listen to me <BR> Tell them, baby <BR> Uh, help me ....

</P>
<P>This actually make sense if you think about it -- she'd on trial, after all.

</P>
<P>Doug's party was fun. (It sounds like I left too early, though.) It's pretty
 interesting to go to a party when you don't know anyone there, but everyone has
 something in common. Maybe we can get Kate to come to the next one. We could
all  chip in to pay for her airfare. Then we could have her perform some of her
songs,  and we wouldn't need to watch her videos.

91 11:37:33 PST <BR> Subject: funky voice on The Ninth Wave 
</P>
<P>The &quot;jiggling&quot; voice effect (where it comes in and out very
rapidly) is achieved  through the use of a device known as a &quot;noise gate.&quot;
What it does is pass a sound  through based on certain criteria, such as the
volume level of the source. This is  good for electric guitars that are going
through amps, and might be humming or  buzzing. The noise gate will shut off the
annoying hum until something loud enough  (like a real intentionally hit guitar
note) comes through. Very useful. What Kate has  is a version of the gate that
can trigger the sound based on ANOTHER source. The  Boss Microrack
Compressor/Gate does this. 
</P>
<P>How it works is: you stick some kind of noise source into the trigger input
(Kate  probably used a drum machine) and you stick the sound you want to go on
and off  quickly into the input line. Now, whenever the sound at the trigger
input gets loud  enough, it turns on the sound coming from the input line. This
sounds kind of  complicated, but it's really quite easy. You just program your
drum machine to go  click click click very rapidly, and stick it into the
trigger. Now, when you sing  through your mic, your voice only gets heard when
the drum machine makes a  sound. Bingo! Instant on/off voice effects. Very
useful and very dramatic. 
</P>
<P>I hope this is abundantly clear. Let me know if questions still haunt you.

<P>Hey guys, 
</P>
<P>Could anyone say exactly what Her Kateness is saying at the end of 'Waking
the  Witch' - &quot;this blackbird - has a stone around it?&quot; - Sounds like
that but I don't  think so (but it certainly would fit the context of the song -&quot;help
this blackbird -  someone help this blackbird&quot; . I have gotten down the
lines of the priest - &quot;What is  it my child - you are a witch -- woman, I
question your innocence! -- I damn you  woman! -- What say you good people
(guilty - guilty - guilty!).....  
</P>
<P>I really love this song - it seems to speak to the repression of female
spirituality -  the repression of the witch in all of us. Specifically - the
Catholic Church and it's  fear and repression of it.... but that subject is too
deep to get into over the  Internet...

<P>&quot;Jig Of Life&quot; is my favorite song on HOL. For at least a week of
pondering over  the lyrics, though, I had absolutely no idea what they were
about, and then suddenly  the meaning of the lyrics sung by Kate became
incredibly obvious. Then the KBC  newsletter came out, and Kate's explanation of
the song matches with mine  *exactly*. Nobody else I have talked to has gotten
the meaning of &quot;Jig Of Life&quot; even  close to right, so I am starting to
feel very arrogant and conceited. Gee, I just must  be the world's greatest KB
lyric analyzer. 
</P>
<P>Prove me wrong! Cut me down to size. What do you think &quot;Jig Of Life&quot;
means?  (The part sung by Kate, that is -- the part narrated by John Carter is
another  story....) (P.S. It's no fair if you've just read the meaning out of
the KBC  newsletter.)

<P>&gt; Why do you say that the old lady in the mirror is her mother? Why not
herself?  KB doesn't say the old lady is in her mirror -- she says the old lady
comes to her  and says &quot;I'll be sitting in your mirror&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Well, because Kate Bush (despite what someone recently said, reading from an
 old biography) is the same age as me, and that is the same experience I have 
sometimes. The face in the mirror is Kate Bush (or the narrator); but she looks 
there and sees that this face is very much like the face of her mother when she
was  born: that is what the line &quot;Now is the place where the crossroads
meet&quot; means, I  think. But this causes the identity of the two generations
to be somewhat mixed and  confused, and the similarities and differences become
apparent. I think &quot;My part of  your life&quot; is the part having to do
with the continuation of life across generations.  Thus the person speaking in
the song sees that she is the same age as her mother  was, and so she has come
around to the beginning of a sort of short cycle again, but  now it is her turn,
and &quot;This moment in time&quot; belongs not to her for her own ends,  but to
all three generations at once.

<P>Yeah, well yeah. I got the lyrics from the second issue of *Under the Ivy*.
I asked  John Carder Bush, who wrote the narrated lyrics, if they were official,
and he said  &quot;Yes&quot;. Perhaps &quot;now&quot; should be capitalized,
however. If you think about it, these  lyrics make perfect sense. The song has a
lot to do with Time, and I think the  meaning of this line is &quot;For the

</P>
<P>Vickie here. Re the &quot;John poem&quot; differences... 
</P>
<P>If I might be so bold, I'd say both versions are slightly wrong. IED's is
the closest  to being right. 
</P>
<P>&gt; the differences being &quot;Run on the ocean&quot; in the first and &quot;One
when the ocean&quot;  in the second, 
</P>
<P>Both are wrong, but IED is more right. (yes, I'll explain) 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;curl of a wave&quot; vs. &quot;curl of the wave&quot;, <BR>
--IED's &quot;the&quot; is correct... 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;and the holy land of water&quot; vs. &quot;in the holy land of
water&quot;, <BR> --IED's &quot;in&quot; is correct... 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;unfurls&quot; vs. &quot;unfurled&quot; ...<BR>  --IED &quot;unfurled&quot;
is correct... 
</P>
<P>These are the things they both have wrong: 
</P>
<P>Anon&gt; Time in her eyes is spawning past light <BR> IED&gt; Time in her
eyes is spawning past light, 
</P>
<P>'light' should be &quot;life&quot; 
</P>
<P>Anon&gt; Run on the ocean and the woman unfurls <BR> IED&gt; One when the
ocean and the woman unfurled, 
</P>
<P>'when' should be: One &quot;with&quot; the ocean and the woman unfurled, 
</P>
<P>How do I know? 
</P>
<P>Well, before HoL came out I got a call from our friend John Reimers, who had
 interviewed Kate and went on to become very good friends with John Carder 
(herafter known as &quot;Jay&quot;) They would talk for hours and hours about
all kinds of  subjects, everything under the sun, except Kate. Very rarely did
they discuss her.  However, Jay had told John that he had a poem featured on
KBV. John was very  interested in Jay's writing and even had some manuscripts.
John asked for the  &quot;lyrics&quot; of the poem and Jay told him. John
transcribed them, and the next time we  talked he asked me if I wanted to hear
it. Knowing that it would be on the Kate  album, I transcribed the words myself.

</P>
<P>This is what I wrote down: 
</P>
<P>Can't you see where memories are kept bright? <BR> Tripping on the water
like a laughing girl <BR> Time in her eyes is spawning past life <BR> One with
the ocean and the woman unfurled 
</P>
<P>Holding all the love that waits for you here <BR> Catch us now for I am
your future <BR> A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land 
</P>
<P>Come over here to where When lingers <BR> Waiting in this empty world <BR>
Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools <BR> For Now does ride in on the
curl of the wave <BR> And you will dance me in the sunlit pools 
</P>
<P>We are of the going water and the gone <BR> We are of water in the holy
land of water <BR> And all that's to come runs in <BR> With the thrust on the
strand 
</P>
<P>Now, there is one difference between my version and IEDs that I tend to
think is  correct on IEDs. 
</P>
<P>Vickie&gt; And you will dance me in the sunlit pools 
</P>
<P>IED&gt; And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools 
</P>
<P>The &quot;with&quot; was not in my original version and I never hear it
being said, but the  was Jay's voice weirds out at that point makes me think
there is something being  said there, probably a &quot;with&quot; because it
makes most sense. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Time in her eyes is spawning past life&quot; makes much more sense
than &quot;light&quot;  because, although light is a subject in other songs on
the side, this particular song, Jig  of *Life*, is concerned with past, present
and future life. 
</P>
<P>&quot;One with the ocean and the woman unfurled&quot; makes sense because
she's just  spent the night on the ocean, she became a part of it's being. She's
also looked  inside herself and found wonders and terrors she never knew existed
within. &quot;the  woman unfurled&quot; 
</P>
<P>This is interesting to me because it tends to make an argument for the fact
that  the woman dies. If she's &quot;one&quot; with the ocean, after her mind
has gone through  such amazing turmoil, then she could have died just when she
was a more &quot;whole&quot;  person. It's hard to explain, I never can seem to
find the right words to describe  what I'm thinking here, but I've always felt
the woman died. Hints in other songs  helped, but this line in particular leads
me to think that, and to be very sad about it,  but accept it. 
</P>
<P>We know very little about the character, who she was and what she was like, 
before the shipwreck, so it wouldn't help us to know her after she'd been  &quot;rescued&quot;,
we wouldn't know if she'd changed. Common sense would tell us how  an experience
like that would change a person, but we just don't know. In my tiny  mind,
there's no reason for Kate to &quot;save&quot; the character, because the 9thW,
besides  being a rousing sea tale, is about learning to appreciate the things
you have, family,  friends, loved ones. It's a morality tale. If the character
lives, it's just a nice story. If  the character dies, it's a lesson to the
readers (listeners) to do what? I don't know.  Live their lives to the fullest,
say &quot;I love you&quot; more often, never travel by boat. :-) 
</P>
<P>Hmm, just some disjointed thoughts. 
</P>
<P>What a wonderful piece The Ninth Wave is! I do wish Kate and Terry Gilliam 
had gotten together and gone ahead with the film. Then again, nothing on film is
 ever as vivid as a listener's own imagination, so maybe it's best.

<P>The actual quote is &quot;We are of water and of the holy land of water, and

</P>
<P>Which is a word play on a poem by W.B. Yeats which begins &quot;We are of
Ireland  and of the Holy Land of Ireland, and Time runs on She cried&quot;,
which is in turn a  poetic use of an ancient prayer which over the years has
been incorporated into folk  songs and suchlike, which is where Yeats found it.

</P>
<P>The oldest version I've seen is a prayer to Brigid, the goddess of poetry
who was  christianized as &quot;St. Brigid&quot;, and dates from the late 1300s.
If I can find it in my desk  I'll post it -- so many little bits of paper with
stuff like that on them floating around  I can't promise, but I may be able to
track it down somewhere else.

around and shortly thereafter  while a bat is flying.

<P>&quot;Deep. Deep. Somewhere in the darkness, give her your light.&quot;: I
disagree with  the last part of this translation. I hear &quot;gibt es ein Licht&quot;,
which means &quot;there is a  light&quot;. &quot;Gibt es&quot; literally means &quot;it
gives&quot;, but it's an idiom which translates &quot;there exists&quot; or &quot;there

<P>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 85 19:34:12 EST <BR> From: hsut@purdue-ecn.ARPA (Bill
Hsu) <BR> Subject: And Dream Of Sheep + Hello Earth
</P>
<P>SOME UNOBSERVANT OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE <BR> OF TWO KATE BUSH
SONGS 
</P>
<P>A long time ago, I foolishly suggested that it would be fun to do some
thematic  analyses of Kate Bush songs. Somebody (jer?) suggested as candidates
And Dream of  Sheep and Hello Earth, since most people thought they shared
musical material but  were unable to say exactly where. Well, here's what I
dredged up. The comments  are mostly on musical themes and motifs. 
</P>
<P>So are the two songs similar? Well, yes and no. The similarities are more
subtle  than the direct quoting of musical phrases. Generally, I'd say Kate Bush
used a  surprising economy of means in these two songs to achieve very varied
effects. The  two songs are in the same key (C# minor, occasionally moving into
E major) and are  similar in harmony also. 
</P>
<P>And Dream of Sheep is mainly composed of five main phrases: (there are 
different ways to break them up, but this is how I did it) 
</P>
<P>(1) The open fifths of &quot;Little light shining...guide them to me&quot;.
The first passage  goes E E (5th) B, B (5th) F# etc. The first chord is a C#
minor 7th (C# E G# B) and  contributes to the tense, mysterious quality of the
opening. 
</P>
<P>(2) &quot;My face is... (repeated)&quot;. This is a relatively calm phrase,
consisting mostly of  repeated E's. 
</P>
<P>(3) &quot;If they find me...for a buoy&quot;. Another calm phrase,
alternating mostly  between B and G#. 
</P>
<P>(4) &quot;Let me be weak...of sheep&quot;. Quiet descending figures, ending
in E major. 
</P>
<P>The first break in the song has the female voice saying &quot;Come here,
(name)&quot;. (1)  is then repeated and extended with variations (&quot;I'll
wake up...a seeking craft&quot;. Call  this (1a).) Then we have (2), (3), (3)
again, but truncated (&quot;I'll tune into...&quot; and &quot;I  can't be left
to...&quot;). A repeat of (4) leads to the first new material for awhile. 
</P>
<P>(5) &quot;Ooh their breath...&quot; Open 6th's. A short phrase is repeated
as a kind of  coda. 
</P>
<P>The opening of Hello Earth is very similar to that of ADOS. The first phrase
 &quot;Hello Earth Hello Earth&quot; is over the same chord as ADOS (C# minor
7th) tho the  theme is slightly changed. Hello Earth goes G# G# B, C# C# F#,
while ADOS goes  E E B, B B F#. I'd like to associate the chord and the thematic
material with some  kind of &quot;contemplation&quot; motif. It opens the two
songs on Ninth Wave which are  about the narrator contemplating her surroundings
rather than hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>Hello Earth is much looser in construction than ADOS. Division of themes are
 not as clearcut as ADOS, so roughly here are the artificial divisions: 
</P>
<P>(1) &quot;Hello Earth ... peek-a-boo little earth&quot;. Notice the &quot;blot
you out out...&quot; motif  (C# E G# B) which returns often in the song. 
</P>
<P>Part of (1) is repeated; &quot;With just my heart...asleep at the seat&quot;
has the same  thematic material as &quot;With just one hand...little earth&quot;.

</P>
<P>(2) &quot;I get out of... travelling fast&quot;. Open fifths again. 
</P>
<P>(3) &quot;Look at it go (twice)&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The first break in Hello Earth is again achieved with an non-Kate voice, the
 chorus that will return at the end of the song. Compare the &quot;Come here...&quot;
passage  in ADOS. 
</P>
<P>(1) is repeated with variations for &quot;Hello Earth, Hello Earth, watching
 storms...the wind out to sea&quot;. Then there is a passage constructed of
variations on  C# D# E B (&quot;All you...etc&quot;). I see this as a
combination of the open 5th motif of the  opening of ADOS and the &quot;blot you
out out&quot; phrase (C# E G# B). 
</P>
<P>(2) with all its rhythmic rigor and open fifths is repeated for &quot;Go to
sleep...head  of the tempest&quot;. A short connecting phrase (&quot;Murderer...&quot;)
and then a repetition of  (3) for &quot;Why did I go...&quot;. 
</P>
<P>So there are definitely similarities. The upward leap of a fifth is an
important  motif, along with the C# minor 7th chord as both harmony and melodic
line (in  arpeggiated form). Both songs are in the same key, and the harmony is
rather  similar. While the songs were not terribly complex, the way Kate Bush
uses a  limited amount of material to achieve her many different effects is
interesting.

<P>A few minutes ago, I was surprised to hear the soft but unmistakable sounds
of  the choral section of &quot;Hello Earth&quot; emanating from the living
room. &quot;That's strange,&quot;  I thought -- as far as I knew, I was the sole
Kate Bush fan in my house. Checking it  out further, I quickly saw that it was
coming from the TV set, to the scene of some  gunman stalking through a house
gunning for somebody or another. They played the  choral section up to the
voiceover at the end (the one that's in what sounds like  German -- what's it
mean, anyway?). 
</P>
<P>Somehow, the music didn't seem all that appropriate.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.ARPA <BR> Subject: greek chorus 
</P>
<P>Speaking of Kate, IED just got out of the Nuart after seeing Herzog's &quot;Nosferatu&quot;
 again. This time he was armed with a walkman and recorded the Czech (or 
Russian) men's choral passage from the film which Kate used in The Ninth Wave. 
The &quot;folk music&quot;, as it is called in the opening credits, is performed
by a group  called &quot;Zinzcaro&quot;, if the name is remembered correctly.
(The damn film isn't out on  video in this country, apparently, so IED can only
go by memory about the spelling.)  NOT by the Richard Hickox Singers. 
</P>
<P>This is especially significant in light of the extraordinary similarity
between the  two performances of the piece. On careful listening, however, it is
clear that,  although extremely similar, the two performances are definitely
different. The point  where the difference is most clearly audible is in the
forte repeat of the theme: in  Kate's version the singing is a bit stronger, and
the bass singer holds his note  steadily between two of the chorus's syllables.
This is not the case in the film  version. Also, Kate has treated the sound of
the choir electronically in some way --  or so it seems to IED -- whereas the
film choir, which sings unaccompanied (Kate's  choir is supported by a fermata
note by a string section), is recorded in a more  prosaic way. 
</P>
<P>All of this is particularly interesting because the same thing seems to be
the case  with the excerpt from &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot; which can be
heard at the beginning of  &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. IED has been assured that
this passage is not the original, but a  careful re-creation. Yet it is so
similar that without such assurance it would be  difficult to believe. 
</P>
<P>If anyone is in contact with a German folk-music fan, perhaps he/she might
ask  about &quot;Zinzcaro&quot;? Meanwhile IED plans to try to track down
Richard Hickox. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, the lead actor (not Kinski, but the younger man who plays
Jonathan  Harker) bears an astonishing resemblance to the actor whom Kate hired
for the  romantic lead in her &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; film. If it weren't for
the thinning hair of  the actor in &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, IED would swear they
were one and the same man.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.ARPA <BR> Subject: NosferaKTu 
</P>
<P>Small world, eh, Fu-Sheng? Well, perhaps you're right that IED's enthusiasm
for  KT borders on the lunatical in comparison with that of other L-Hs; he will
try to  keep that in mind in future. 
</P>
<P>Since you ask, here is what IED knows about the Nosferatu connection: 
</P>
<P>In between the verses of &quot;Hello Earth&quot;, Kate interstitched an
uncanny duplication  of the men's choral passage from the surreal 
</P>
<P>&quot;drink-and-be-merry-for-tomorrow-we-may-die&quot; scene from the end of
Werner  Herzog's &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, although altering the sound somewhat,
and adding other  instrumental tracks, either acoustic strings or a Fairlight
imitation. 
</P>
<P>In the liner notes to Hounds of Love Kate &quot;thanks&quot; Werner Herzog,
not  specifying what for. Then, in Tony Myatt's Capital Radio interview, which
was  conducted for the Romford Convention last October or November, Kate said
that she  had got the men's choral section of &quot;Hello Earth&quot; &quot;from&quot;
Herzog's &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. She first identified the origin of this music as
&quot;Czech or Russian&quot;, then corrected herself  by stating flatly that it
was &quot;Czech&quot;, adding that the music had sounded &quot;truly holy&quot; 
to her. (I don't remember the words exactly, but I have them on audio tape 
somewhere, and they are now in print somewhere in a recent &quot;Homeground&quot;,
which  has been printing a transcription of the interview over the past two
issues.) 
</P>
<P>At the beginning of the movie credit is given to Popol Vuh for the main
score  (IED foolishly paid $10.00 plus for the soundtrack LP in Europe last
November,  naively assuming that all the music from the film would be included).
Below Popol  Vuh's credit, two additional musical credits were listed, one for a
passage from some  Wagner opera or other (didn't have time to read it) and the
third for &quot;folk music&quot;  by some group (?) known as &quot;Zinzcaro&quot;.
This is almost certainly the credit for the  bit of choral music in the
penultimate scene which Kate used in &quot;Hello Earth&quot;. 
</P>
<P>However, Kate's version is sung by a British choral group known as the &quot;Richard
 Hickox Singers&quot;. In neither case are the words intelligible to IED, since
he knows  neither Czech nor Russian. He would be very interested to know what
the words  mean, or even if the same words are sung in both versions, even
though it is  admittedly highly unlikely that the lyrics' content bears any
relation to Kate's theme  in The Ninth Wave, or even that she ever bothered to
find out what the words  meant. It was clearly the sound that interested her,
not the meaning of the words. 
</P>
<P>This has nothing to do with the line spoken in German from the same part of 
The Ninth Wave: &quot;Tiefer, tiefer, ergendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein licht.&quot;
If you  notice, that line, spoken by Gabi Zangerl, is accompanied by the sounds
of a  submarine's sonar signal. It is IED's theory that this is meant to evoke
images of  U-boat activity during WWII, and possibly to create the feeling of
claustrophobia  that must have existed within the confined spaces of a
submarine, which is a big  part of the movie &quot;Das Boot&quot;. Kate has
several times referred to old war movies as a  primary inspiration for The Ninth
Wave.

<P>&gt; It has always my impression that the submarine sonar sounds indicate
that Kate  is rescued by a submarine. After all, we have the voice telling us
that &quot;somewhere in  the depth, there is a light&quot;, then we hear
submarine sounds, and then Kate is safe on  land again. 
</P>
<P>Thanks, Doug. Great point which IED applauds, is excited by, and feels dumb
for  not having thought of on his own.

discovery: 
</P>
<P>HE HAS IDENTIFIED THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE MEN'S CHORAL  PASSAGE FROM &quot;HELLO
EARTH&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Let him take this opportunity to retract and apologize for his earlier vague
 reference to some Czech folk group named Zinzcaro in relation to the passage in
 question. This was quite false, and frankly IED is ashamed to say that he can't
for  the life of him explain how he came up with this false reference. He
thought he had  read it in the credits of Nosferatu, but in this it seems he was
completely mistaken.  IED will have the original score and the text (WHICH IS
NOT IN CZECH OR  RUSSIAN AT ALL), together with an English translation, within
one month. Until  then, let him confine himself to the simple statement that the
passage, as Kate  herself has said, is indeed &quot;HOLY&quot;.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: greek chorus
</P>
<P>Andrew Marvick's penultimate attempt to learn the origins of Kate's 
re-recording of the choral music from Nosferatu has produced an inconclusive 
result. (Those L-Hs with good memories and a respectable amount of fanaKTicism 
in their blood will recall IED's mid-October claim that he would know the truth 
about this bit of music within one month, and so that they may remove themselves
 from their tenterhooks, he has decided to explain the situation.) 
</P>
<P>The movie itself gives no clear information about the passage. IED therefore
 tracked down the addresses of Messrs. Michael Berkeley and Richard Hickox, 
respectively the orchestral arranger and chorus master on Kate's &quot;Hello
Earth&quot;  track. I asked them for whatever particulars they could give
concerning the music,  hoping that one or the other would know what the lyrics
of the choral passage  meant, and any other details about the recording process.

</P>
<P>Yesterday I received the following letter from Michael Berkeley, accompanied
by  a photo-copy of the four-part score that Kate and he used for the recording.

</P>
<P>Dear Mr. Marvick, 
</P>
<P>Thank you for your letter of October 10th. I'm very glad that you enjoy
Kate's  work since I too have always thought it highly individual. 
</P>
<P>You're right in thinking that a lot of care went into recording the chorus
on  Hello Earth and Kate was as exacting in her very precise requirements as any
great  conductor I have known (and I've known a few). Every nuance and dynamic
had to  be just right. 
</P>
<P>We began with an original chorus by me in the style of the Nosferatu music
but it  soon became clear that Kate was wedded to the Nosferatu sound almost
note for  note so, after exhaustive attempts to ascertain that the music was not
in copyright, I  notated the music and then adapted it so that it would fit
harmonically. 
</P>
<P>Like you, I've been unable to pin down exactly where the music originates
from  but I came to the conclusion that it was a chant probably of Russian or
greek  Orthodox ancestry and almost certainly sung by monks or priests. 
</P>
<P>I'm sorry not to be able to be more precise and if you ever find out more 
yourself I will be fascinated to hear about it. Meanwhile, if I can find my copy
of the  chorus as I wrote it, I will include it for you or send it later. 
</P>
<P>Yours sincerely, <BR> Michael Berkeley

<P> &gt; Werner Herzog movie, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. I doubt Kate picked it for
the words. IED  knows more about this. -- |&gt;oug ] 
</P>
<P>Maybe, but it's still nothing. After considerable research in quest of the
meaning  of the &quot;words&quot; in the Nosferatu chorus, and even the making
of inquiries in letters to  the arranger and the conductor, respectively, of the
track, IED has come to the  conclusion that it's highly unlikely that Kate ever
found out what the words of the  original chorus actually are saying, or even
that she ever got more than an  approximation of the original phonetics. No one
has yet traced the original recording,  and the credits in the movie itself are
very vague. They apparently attribute the  recording (but with no identification
of the music itself) to a &quot;group&quot; called  Zinzkarol, which IED (with
extreme hesitancy) suggests might translate more or less  as &quot;Gypsy Chorale&quot;.
Beyond that he was unable to track the scent. It's interesting  that Kate thanks
both Herzog and Florian Fricke in the HoL liner-notes, indicating  that she made
careful inquiries into the origin of the music. It turns out, however,  that
Popol Vuh, though the official composers of the film's soundtrack, did not 
compose or record the particular bit of music in question.

<BR> Subject: Hello Earth story. 
</P>
<P>I've been meaning to post something about Hello Earth for a while, but I
haven't  been sure if I can really express it. I love the song, but sometimes...
well, I suppose I  should say that it scares me silly. It's the imagery that
comes from this part that  does it: 
</P>
<P>(pardon inaccuracies -- I'm operating from memory here) 
</P>
<P>Can't do anything <BR> Just watch them swing with the wind out to sea <BR>
All you sailors [...get out of the water] <BR> All you cruisers <BR> All you
fishermen <BR> head for home <BR> ... 
</P>
<P>I get this image of Earth as seen from a distance, probably from high orbit.
 Looking down, you see a horrific, dark storm shooting out to sea, toward a
sailboat,  on which the sailors are ignorant of the impending horror-show that a
nasty storm at  sea can be. The reason this occasionally conjures up real fear
is that I've done a  some open water passages on sailboats, and know first-hand
the potential for feeling  helpless and alone out there when a dark wall appears
on the horizon and grows  quickly, consuming the entire sky in an angry black
froth. I've been scared shitless  out there, but at the same time it's weirdly
exhilarating. Whenever some sort of  nasty weather starts to come, I can't help
playing over and over again in my mind,  &quot;All you sailors/all you
cruisers...&quot; etc. 
</P>
<P>The worst time I couldn't stop running the lines through my head was about
14  months ago, when my father was sailing to the Virgin Islands and got into a
nasty  storm (50 knot winds, 40 foot seas). A simultaneous set of events led to
what is called  a &quot;goosewing jibe&quot;, which is a generally a bad thing.
What happens is this: the boat  is at the bottom of a trough between waves (in
this case, about 40-footers, which are  big and scary), and the mast sticks up
above the top of the waves (on Mariah, the  mast is about 60 feet tall),
catching wind above the waves that isn't down in the  trough. As the boat goes
up the side of the next wave, the sail fills more and more. 
</P>
<P>Now, if the sail is off to one side, say, the port (left) side, and the wind
starts to  fill the sail *from* the port side, beginning at the top of the sail,
you don't really  notice this happening unless you're staring at the top of the
mast. What happens is  that the sail continues to fill, and at a certain point,
fills more from the port side  than the starboard, and as it continues to fill,
violently whips to the other side of the  boat. There is what is essentially a
big stick on the bottom of the sail, called a boom,  which during a jibe (a jibe
-- or for the Brits out there, a gybe --is that violent  movement of the sail
from one side to the other) becomes a big baseball bat being  swung at least as
fast as the windspeed. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, as the 50 knot winds swung this big bat, my father was standing up
and  caught the end of it right in the face. Miraculously, he wasn't killed, and
because he  was wearing his harness, he wasn't thrown overboard. But his head
was bashed  pretty badly, and needed to be pulled from the boat, as they were
about 350 miles  off shore and couldn't just duck in to the nearest hospital.
The problem was that the  weather prevented any boat-to-ship transfer, and the
coast guard tried several times  to get him off with a helicopter and a rescue
sling, but the waves were still too  bouncy, and it wasn't possible. 36 hours
after the accident, Air Force air/sea rescue  was finally able to get him off
the boat by dropping frogmen from a helicopter, who  patched him up some and put
him in a horseshoe sling which was dragged behing  the boat to a distance at
which it was safe for the helicopter to come down and pick  up him and the
frogmen. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, during that awful 36 hours, the only information my mother, brother,
 and I had was that he'd been struck by the boom during a jibe in a storm, and
that  the coast guard and air force were trying to get him off the boat, but
couldn't. And  among the swirling vortex of things rushing through my head were
the images and  lines from Hello Earth. And of course now I can't help
associating the song with  this story, and with ugly storms I've seen for
myself. 
</P>
<P>So that's my story about why Hello Earth scares me sometimes. 
</P>
<P>Oh, in case anyone's interested by now, Dad's injuries (multiple skull
fractures,  lacerations to the eye, etc) actually healed pretty quickly, and
he's fine. In fact, he  was back on the boat about two months later. If any of
you out there are students  and have loved ones who sail, ask them not to get
smashed in the face by a boom  while you're in the middle of finals. It's kind
of distracting.

Album&quot; series: 
</P>
<P>***** begin transcript ***** 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hello Earth&quot; was a very difficult track to write as well, because
in some ways it  was too big for me.  I ended up with this song that had two
huge great holes in the  choruses, where the drums stopped and everything
stopped, and people would say to  me: &quot;What's going to happen in these
choruses?&quot; and I hadn't got a clue! 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Hello Earth&quot; is played as far as the first &quot;hole&quot;,
then continues under the  following.] 
</P>
<P>We had the whole song, it was all there, but for these huge great holes in
the  choruses, and I knew I wanted to put something there. I'd had this idea to
put a  vocal piece in there that was like this traditional tune I'd heard used
in the film  &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. And, really, everything I came up with, it
was rubbish really compared  to what this piece was saying, and so we did some
research to find out if it was  possible to use it. And it was, so that's what
we did. We re-recorded the piece and I  kind of made up words that sounded like
what I could hear was happening on the  original. And suddenly there were these
beautiful voices in these choruses that had  just been like two black holes. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Hello Earth&quot; has reached the next chorus and is faded up again.
It plays to the  end of the track.] 
</P>
<P>In some ways I thought of it as a lullaby for the Earth. And it was the idea
of  turning the whole thing upside down and looking at it from completely above,
like  you would if you were lying in water at night and you were looking up at
the sky all  the time. I wonder if you wouldn't get the sense that, as the stars
were reflected in  the water, a sense that you could be looking up at water
that's reflecting the stars  from the sky that you're in. And the idea of them
looking down at the Earth and  seeing these storms forming over America and
moving around the globe. And they  have this huge, fantastically overseeing,
view of everything. Everything is in total  perspective and way, way down there
somewhere there's this little dot in the ocean  that is them. 
</P>
<P>[The programme moves on to &quot;The Morning Fog&quot;]

gallaher@MOLLYBLOOM.msfc.nasa.gov (Mike Gallaher) <BR> Subject: Ninth Wave 
</P>
<P>I saw the 1979 Werner Herzog film Nosferatu recently and was surprised to
hear  one scene accompanied by the same male choir piece that Kate inserted into
&quot;Hello  Earth.&quot; I had assumed, since the piece wasn't credited on her
album, that the  section had been composed by whoever it was that was listed as
arranger (or  conductor or something like that) on the album. But it is
obviously a preexisting  composition. I didn't catch the title of the
composition on the credits; I thought  maybe someone out there could find a
videotape of Nosferatu and get it. Since it is a  prominent part of one of
Kate's albums, it ought to be documented along with the  rest of the KTrivia we
wallow in, right? 
</P>
<P>Another thing: I downloaded the complete lyrics listing, and I noticed that
in the  transcription of the &quot;conversational&quot; intro to Waking the
Witch, the transcriber  apparently does not hear what I hear, namely two
instances in which the name of  the &quot;narrator&quot; of The 9th Wave is (to
me) clearly given. The name is so perfect for  the character that I cannot
believe that I'm imagining it. Being new to the group, I  just wondered if the
character's name has already been discussed, and if not, why  isn't it
documented somewhere?

Subject: Georgian Source for &quot;Hello Earth&quot; (male chorus section) 
</P>
<P>Recently I &quot;accidently&quot; found out via AOL's KB Folder that some
info. I have on a  source for the male-chorus interlude in &quot;Hello Earth&quot;
in The Ninth Wave was not  generally known... I had no idea that even Kate
doesn't know where this piece  (that she picked up from Werner Herzog's &quot;Nosferatu&quot;)
came from. 
</P>
<P>2-3 years ago, my brother James was buying a lot of Russian orthodox
liturgical  music, thereby discovering the music of Georgia (Caucasia) along the
way... he  picked up a pretty obscure Japanese recording of traditional Georgian
music (called,  &quot;The Marvels of Polyphony in Sakartvelo&quot;, CD Ethnic
Sound Series #17, Victor, Japan  1987), and discovered upon playing the third
cut that it was what must have been the  source for this chant-like piece. On
the Japanese CD it was called &quot;Tshintsharo&quot; (the  liner notes were all
in Japanese, so we couldn't learn anything more about this  particular piece or
type of music...Andy Marvick replied in an AOL msg. that the  trailing credits
in &quot;Nosferatu&quot; do mention something called &quot;Zinzgaro&quot;...)
Back then  when James' played the piece for me, I recognized the chord
progression first, then  started to hear the melody, moving in the same
directions, at a slightly different  meter--still very recognizable as the &quot;Hello
Earth&quot; chorus. It is a very beautiful,  haunting piece. 
</P>
<P>Just last Sunday, however, I was able to find out a little more about &quot;Tshintsharo&quot;
 because I discovered at Tower Records, a newer, domestic release of the exact
same  collection. The label, JVC, did not fully translate the liner notes, but
about  &quot;Tshintsharo&quot; it says this much: &quot;This song performed
without any trace of vibrato  has a text including the line &quot;May the well
flow forth.&quot; Appropriate, (thinks Karen  N.), for Kate's Ninth Wave!! 
</P>
<P>I will write to the label to see if there is any way to get a full
translation for all  the notes; here is a bit of what is there--
</P>
<P>&quot;The mountainous nation of Sakartvelo is located in the Caucasus
mountains  between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Sakartvelo is in fact the
former name  for the area now known as the Soviet Republic of Georgia.
Sakartvelo has a  distinctive musical culture which fuses Turkish and other
Asian elements with  features from the music of Greece... Men and women seldom
sing together. Choral  music includes quiet pieces in the manner of Masses,
lively pieces featuring  exchanges between groups within the chorus... another
important feature... is the  complete absence of vibrato.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I'm sending a tape to The Kate Bush Club in Welling, Kent. Here is the CD
info.  for the domestic release:

(male chorus section) 
</P>
<P>The Female Chorus Group of National Music School of Telavi is the chorus
which  sings this cut on this CD, though most of the recordings I've heard of
this (usually  on truly obscure Georgian vinyl albums) are done by male
choruses. Another JVC  CD is Ethnic Sound Series No. 29, The Marvelous Polyphony
of Martve, which  features the same piece done (track 17) by the boy's chorus
called Martve, directed  by the Georgian choral director Anzor Erkomaishvili,
who also directs the Rustavi  Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>The song is actually a traditional lyrical song from Kakheti-Kartli, the 
easternmost region of the (former Soviet) Republic of Georgia, the area around 
Tbilisi, the capital. The song is actually best transliterated as tsintsqaro .
The ts  sounds are glottalized underneath the ts, and teh q is like a k sound,
except made as  far back in your throat as possible, and then a little further
back. (It's a sound that  Georgians like to hear foreigner attempt, and
sometimes literally choke on.) All  vowels tend toward median (neither long nor
short). 
</P>
<P>The version that Kate uses is actually a pretty good transcription of the
the  traditional tune. The harmonies are also traditional--one of the unusual 
distinguishing features of Georgian music is that it is almost ALWAYS in
harmony,  usually three-part harmony in the Kakheti region, where tsintsqaro is
from. I first  became aware of it when the Kate Bush album was used as
background music for an  episode of Miami Vice involving Soveit defectors and
spies. I didn't actually see the  episode, but my friend had taped it on his VCR
to time shift it, and my friend Frank  is one of a handful of people in America
(besides myself) that instantly recognized it  as a Georgian tune. In fact,
tracking down Kate Bush's use of it is how I got into  Kate Bush myself. (I've
long been into Georgian music!) 
</P>
<P>Tsintsqaro can be translated as At the Spring or By the Source or At the
Well .  It's a boy meets girl love song; he catches a glimpse of her at the
spring when she  comes to fetch water. 
</P>
<P>The choral parts of Hello Earth are therefore actually a traditional,
public-domain  folk-song! 
</P>
<P>A transliteration of the Georgian words I use to sing it (originally from a
1936  transcription of the song): 
</P>
