</P>
<P>In the latest issue of Billboard, one of the columns reports that an &quot;Elton
 John/Bernie Taupin 20 year Tribute Album&quot; is in the works which will
consist of a  bunch of big-name UK artists doing covers of their songs. The
first cover they  mentioned was a cover of &quot;Rocket Man&quot; by Kate to be
included on the album.

<P>from the latest (32nd) issue of &quot;Homeground&quot;: 
</P>
<P>The tribute album to honor the songwriting duo of Elton John and Bernie
Taupin  (whom IED met the other day, incidentally, and found to be a very nice
chap) has  been scrapped. The record labels couldn't get together on royalties,
apparently. This  means that Kate's proposed cover version of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
will not see the light of  day, and quite possibly was never even recorded.

<P>In more good KT news: A project which was originally announced in the trade 
papers more than a year ago, and subsequently said to have been scrapped, has
now  been re-activated (info again courtesy of Neil). The project in question is
a  comilation album of songs written by the songwriting team of Elton John and
Bernie  Taupin, as covered in new recordings by a variety of artists. The
occasion was  originally to have been the twentieth anniversary of the
John-Taupin partnership,  though that now may be an obsolete excuse for the
album. 
</P>
<P>In any event, when the project was first announced, Kate Bush was slated to 
record a cover version of Rocket Man for the album, and that now appears to be
on  again.

 called &quot;Two Rooms&quot; (I think - I was half asleep at the time 8^) and
*does* have  KaTe on it. There's also a single from it being released, but it's
Oleta Adams (sp?)  singing &quot;Don't let the sun go down on me&quot;. (which

<P>This has been one of my favorite songs for at least 10 years...and there are
very  few songs that I was into as a 12 year old that still count as favorites.
I think one of  the reasons I've always liked it so much is the way it
captures--intentionally or  not--the feel of many of Ray Bradbury's stories
concerning the 'rocketman' who  did his job as if he were driving a truck or
working an assembly line...&quot;It's just a  job I do, five days a week.&quot;
It was incredibly exciting to learn that KaTe would cover  it for the Elton John

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Billboard article on &quot;Two Rooms&quot; 
</P>
<P>The latest Billboard (Sept. 28) has a long article on the Elton John
tribute, &quot;Two  Rooms.&quot; I'll just mention the parts that are relevant
for this newsgroup. 
</P>
<P>It says, &quot;Drawing on the album's varied artists and tracks, Polydor
plans a  multi-format blitz, including the likely promotion of. .. &quot;Rocket
Man&quot; by Kate Bush  to alternative programmers, . . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Five years in the making, . . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>The video is a completely separate project from the audio release, so some
artists  (such as Kate) won't appear on both. &quot;The video is a companion
piece, not a  mirror-image,&quot; says Joe Shults, president of PolyGram Video
USA. 
</P>
<P>The article also says, &quot;Marketing of the superstar project may also
include a  network television special and a pay-per-view concert starring some
of the album's  participants before the end of the year. Both events are under
negotiation.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;As producer of the album, [Steven] Brown concedes that coordinating a
project  on this scale with such top-name participants was 'a nightmare. You're
trying to  deal with 16 acts, 16 managements, and 16 record companies. You're
trying to  assimilate all their ideas and get all the clearances you need.'&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;' We're just beginning to let some of the tracks out to our promotion
people,'  says [John] Barbis [senior VP of promotion for PolyGram]. 'What's
great about this  is everybody knows these songs and every artist gave their own
interpretation.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>The article also has the final list of tracks, in their final order. &quot;Rocket
Man&quot; will  be the second track.

-0700 <BR> Subject: Two Rooms review in Q 
</P>
<P>Don't know if this will make it with gaffa seeming to be dead again. 
</P>
<P>There is a review of Two Rooms in the Nov. issue of Q. Here are the relevant
 quotes. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Named after the songwriting habits of Elton John and Bernie Taupin,
who have  yet to write a song in the same room, Two Rooms finds the tribute
genre going  solidly mainstream with the kind of guest list usually reserved for
charity records  inspired by global crises. 
</P>
<P>... John and Taupin's songs have alwasy borne a close relation with the kind
of  melodic storyline style of musicals. As a result everyone from Sinead
O'Connor to  Bruce Hornsby sound as if they were playing themselves in a rock
opera scripted by  John and Taupin. Given the pair's predilection for rock
pastiches and ballards  trembling on the edge of outright sentimentality, Two
Rooms enables most of the  contributors to ham it up in a way they wouldn't dare
on their own songs. 
</P>
<P>... Kate Bush manages to combine her spacier tendencies with her old pop 
sensibility for a cod-reggae version of Rocket Man... 
</P>
<P>Ultimately though, Two Rooms is an excellent singalong that is also rather 
depressingly predictable in what it reveals about the current pop hierarchy&quot;

<P>Date: Tue, 15 Oct 1991 01:39:38 -0700 <BR> From: Steve Fagg &lt;S.L.Fagg@bnr.co.uk&gt;
<BR> Subject: New KaTe! 
</P>
<P>&quot;From the age of 11, Elton John was my biggest hero. I loved his music,
had all his  albums, and I hoped one day I'd play the piano like him (I still
do). 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I was asked to be involved in this project and was given the
choice of a  track it was like being asked 'Would you like to fulfill a dream?
Would you like to  be a Rocket Man?' ... yes, I would.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Thus writes KaTe in the booklet accompanying the album &quot;Two Rooms - 
celebrating the songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin&quot; released today,
Monday, 14th  October, 1991 (in the UK) on Mercury (845 749-2 (CD), -4 (MC), -1
(LP)). KaTe's  version of &quot;Rocket Man&quot; is the second of the sixteen
tracks and is credited thus: 
</P>
<P>Produced by: Kate Bush <BR> Engineered by: Del Palmer <BR> Charlie Morgan:
Drums <BR> Del Plamer: Bass <BR> Alan Murphy: Guitars <BR> Kate Bush:
Keyboards &amp; Vocals <BR> Danny Spillane: Uillean Pipes <BR> Alistair
Anderson: Concertina <BR> (p)1990 Novercia Limited, performed by Kate Bush
courtesy of Sony Music  Entertainment and EMI Records. 
</P>
<P>The accompanying photo of KaTe is the black and white John Carder Bush shot 
showing KaTe resting her chin in the palms of her hands which was used on the 
cover of the &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; single. 
</P>
<P>The song starts off with a slow, quiet, introduction sung by KaTe over what 
sounds like a pipe organ (Fairlight sampled?) as far as &quot;On such a timeless
flight&quot;.  And, yes, KaTe does sing &quot;*she* packed my bag&quot; and &quot;I
miss my *wife*&quot; taking on  the viewpoint of the &quot;Rocket *Man*&quot;
rather than doing a Tiffany. Then the song  launches into a reggae rhythm for
the chorus. This rhythm is maintained for the rest  of the song, though after
the second chorus the Uillean pipes come in (rather  incongruously) over the top
and remain until the end of the track, which is just  under five minutes long. 
</P>
<P>Some of the backing vocals sound very much as though KaTe has re-used a tape
 of backing vocals from &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (the song), and altogether &quot;Rocket
Man&quot; is  a rather uncomfortable mixture as though the constituent parts
hadn't been allowed  enough time to marinate and form a satisfying whole.
Throughout KaTe sings with  conviction, without a trace of a send-up, so why the
cod reggae feel? This does not  seem to me to be a deliberately over-the-top
romp like &quot;Ken&quot;, KaTe seems to be  taking the lyrics very seriously,
but the instrumental parts seem to be on a different  wavelength alogether. On
the basis of the first dozen or so listenings I'd have to say  that this really
doesn't work for me, sorry KaTe! 
</P>
<P>Since KaTe appears to have retained control (via Novercia) of the recording,
I  wouldn't be surprised to see &quot;Rocket Man&quot; turning up on the
backside of a single  from the next album sometime. Unless you're a completist I
couldn't in all  conscience recommend that people rush out and buy this (full
price) album just to  get &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, even though that's exactly
what I did. The rest of the tracks are  extremely uneven in quality and I'd have
to say that, at least where the songs with  which I'm familiar are concerned,
the tribute versions can't hold a candle to the  originals. Talking of candles,
Sinead's quote (in its entirety) reads: &quot;I can't believe  no-one did
'Candle in the Wind'&quot; (she did &quot;Sacrifice&quot;). 
</P>
<P>Trivia point (1): all the tracks are (p)1991 apart from KaTe's &quot;Rocket
Man&quot; and  Phil Collins' &quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot; which are both
(p)1990. 
</P>
<P>Trivia point (2): Dr. John Bush (presumably KaTe's father) is listed at the
back  of the booklet under the &quot;With Special Thanks to:&quot; heading, his
is the only name I  recognised.

</P>
<P>The new KB track is quite interesting, it'll take quite a bit of getting
used to  though hearing Rocket Man with irish instruments on. Kate's track in my
opinion is  the 2nd best track. I have to say that the best track is Sinead
O'Connor's version of  Sacrifice which is stunning! After her slaughter of Don't
Give Up I was pleasantly  surprised.

-0700 <BR> Subject: More on Rocket Man 
</P>
<P>I have had a few more listens to Rocket Man and still find it very hard to 
describe. It is very much TSW style Kate rather than any new direction or a step
 back. On first listening to it it seems very simple. A closer inspection on
headphones  reveals that as usual with Kate there are a hosts of things going on
in the  background - multitracked instruments, backing vocals. strange
unidentifiable (by  me) twangin noises etc. 
</P>
<P>Kate sings the lyrics unchanged i.e. from the man's point of view. She
manages  to get great feeling in her voice especially an amazing tremor on the
word &quot;long&quot;  during the &quot;I think it's going to be a long, long
time&quot; phrase. There are many  changes in tempo during the song - even
within a single line of the lyrics e.g. moving  up tempo with backing vocals
rising to a crescendo then almost stopping dead (like  the fuse burning out),
followed by a few gentle guitar notes. The uillean pipes  feature most strongly
towards the end of the song, but are used in other places as  well which gives a
strange feel to the song during the bits where there is almost a  reggae beat.
The song begins slowly sounding like a lament (similar in some ways to  This
Women's Work) though it builds up speed a litle which is when the (only) 
slightly reggae feel comes into the song. It never becomes upbeat in feel for
more  than a few bars though and the overall impression is of sadness - this
comes out  much more with Kate's voice than it did with John's. 
</P>
<P>Interestingly, all the tracks bar Kate's and Phil Collins are dated 1991
while  their's are 1990. So they must have been the first to be approached or at
least to have  accepted (we know Kate recorded the track some time ago). I have
only listened to  a few of the other tracks and I find them of variable quality.
I doubt whether I  would have bought the album if Kate had not been featured.

<P>Overall I was amused and liked the song--the reggae ness of it comes off
pretty  well to me, but then I'm not a huge reggae fan either. But at the
beginning I can  remember thinking, geez, I thought the bad sounds on &quot;Ken&quot;
were supposed to be  parodic....is this going to be a trend?

<P>How well? That might be worth it, but I bought Stay Awake for her

<P>Oh, the things I go through for KaTe. 
</P>
<P>I've been waiting, not very patiently, to hear Rocketman for ever, or at
least 3  weeks, whichever is longer--I'm not sure at this point. 
</P>
<P>I random-chanced a time to shower this morning, and random-chanced true the 
boolean &quot;yes, I will listen to my sister's radio while I'm in the shower&quot;
(she keeps a  radio in the bathroom but I almost never listen to it). 
</P>
<P>In the middle of my shower, my hair full o' goop, I hear the DJ say &quot;Kate
Bush.&quot;  At which point I shut off the water and opened the shower curtain
and listened to  KaTe. It was *cold*. But I finally got to hear Rocketman. 
</P>
<P>Impession 1: this would be a *great* song for flying a kite ballet. 
</P>
<P>Impression 2: the beginning is great. the end is great. parts of the middle
are  great. 
</P>
<P>I dunno...not all of the harmonies work quite right for me. I don't mind the
cod  reggae, though I don't think it fits very well with the the somberness of
the  opening portion (or the lyrics). I absolutely love the uillean pipe (did
Davey Spilane  play for KaTe again?) and I think it blends beautifully. In fact,
that final portion,  after she says &quot;I think it's gonna be a long long time&quot;
is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>Impression 3: is it just me or is that real prevalent snare sound really
nasty? I  remember some people talking about stuff sounding incredibly
compressed, and I  wondered if what I was hearing was the result of
compression--I don't know  enough about it to be able to recognize it as such.
That snare sounded like a fairly  old computerized sound. 
</P>
<P>Overall, I thought it was quite good and I really hope Chris wasn't joking
when  he said that it would be released as a single with &quot;Candle in the
Wind.&quot;

<P>This past week's issue of Billboard (Nov. 9) lists:

<P>&quot;Rocket Man&quot; debuts at No. 24 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. 
</P>
<P>Two Rooms debuts at No. 28 on the Top Albums chart. (It's No. 5 and No. 2 at

</P>
<P>Bush's high-pitched, chirping performance is a bit off-putting at first, but
her  gentle, heartfelt treatment of this Elton John classic does update it for
alternative  radio formats. Reggae-vibed beats and folky, stringed
instrumentation definitely add  a new twist to an old favorite.

<P>That's all it says.

<P>Just a word on &quot;Rocket Man&quot;. The point, musically speaking, as
this fan sees it, is  not that it has a &quot;reggae&quot; beat, but that it is
the first recording ever made which  merges reggae with Irish folk music and
Elton John (not to mention Kate Bush,  which is the clincher, of course). It's
another flawless masterpiece, whether you all  can find it in your hearts to
acknowledge that or not. The truth is, it's the sum of its  ingredients and
much, much more. Feel it.

</P>
<P>...on the DLT show on Radio 1 yesterday (Sunday). DLT (sorry, Dave Lee
Travis)  first played the Rocket Man promo CD, and then an acetate of Candle in
the Wind.  He mentioned it would be out on 7&quot; and CD-single on the 25th. 
</P>
<P>So what's it like? Very much like the original. KaTe sings it in much the
same  style as Elton did, but makes it sound even more beautiful. She uses her
voice quite  emotively, without overdoing it. The instrumental backing is fairly
subdued - I  couldn't hear any Uillean pipes, but there may have been one or two
of Pad's exotic  stringed creations in there somewhere. And there's some
Enya-like &quot;block&quot; backing  vocals that fade up towards the end.

<P>I got a card from the KBC (actually probably from Mercury Records, but with
a  KBC address label) today advertising Rocket Man. It says it's being released
in the  following formats:

</P>
<P>o 12&quot;

<P>It seems to be being released on Mercury Records, not EMI, which is
something  of a novelty for KaTe. 
</P>
<P>I've also managed to get my hands on a US Rocket Man promo CD (from 
Lightspeed Mail Order in London, for a mere L15.99 8^). It's Polydor CDP589, AAD
 (blechh!) and white with red lettering and &quot;Two Rooms&quot; logo. Not a

IED0DXM%MVS.OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: thE Meaning of kt's
reggAe 
</P>
<P>Richard Caldwell, Love-Hounds's staunch defender of the PMRC, has expressed 
the opinion that Kate's &quot;reggae&quot; version of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
fails to convey a sense of  sadness and loneliness. IED couldn't disagree more.
But which sense of sadness and  loneliness do we refer to here: the piercing,
shocking, thrilling sense of a real  emotion felt as though for the first time?
Or the dull, safe sense of a  half-remembered emotion dimly reflected in an
all-too-familiar tradition? 
</P>
<P>IED has two points to make about &quot;Rocket Man&quot;. First, &quot;sadness&quot;
and &quot;loneliness&quot;  need not be--and in fact seldom effectively are, at
least not in rock music--expressed  in a minor key and at a slower pace. Kate
herself once said about &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;  that she had taken care to
conceal the tragic subject matter of the song within the  lilting waltz
atmosphere of its musical setting, so as to draw people into a more  receptive
state of mind when they eventually noticed what the song was about. Kate  wants
to evoke fresh, real emotions in her listeners, and to do that she must and does
 place traditional themes in unusual, sometimes incongruous settings. 
</P>
<P>Wouldn't some people agree that part of the power of Elton John's original 
version of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, back in the early '70s, lay in its mixture of
a wistful  electric/electronic accompaniment with what was otherwise a
remarkably inviting  and catchy rock ballad? 
</P>
<P>Besides, does it make sense to be disappointed because Kate didn't choose to
 approach Elton John's song by the most obvious musical path? Should she have
done  what Hall &amp; Oates (on &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot;), Oleta Adams
(on &quot;Don't Let the  Sun Go Down on Me&quot;), The Who (on &quot;Saturday
Night's Alright for Fighting&quot;) and  The Beach Boys (on &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;)
did: taken a Philly soul song, a gospel rock  mini-epic, a fast rocker and a
nostalgic '50s pastiche, respectively, and turned them  into overblown,
unintentional parodies of--a Philly soul song, a gospel rock  mini-epic, a fast
rocker and a nostalgic '50s pastiche? 
</P>
<P>What is the use in conforming to the well-defined limitations of tired,
empty  genres? Is this what Love-Hounds came together to celebrate? 
</P>
<P>Shouldn't we rather be rejoicing that when Kate listened to &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
she  did not any longer hear only a '70s-era Elton John rock ballad-- not just
another  quaint nugget from our past to be reproduced in bright, antiseptic but
utterly  unimaginative '90s colors? 
</P>
<P>Shouldn't we rather be counting our lucky stars that there is still a Kate
Bush out  there who listened to Elton John's &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and heard
instead Jamaican, Irish  and Kazakh dance music (albeit dance music that stops
and starts fitfully,  confounding its own principles, as in the Kate Bush of The
Dreaming and before),  embellished with entirely new, multiple countermelodies,
extended phrases, and  even several basic changes to the main-vocal's
melody-line? Are there any real Kate  Bush fans who can be unhappy with that? 
</P>
<P>The other point IED wanted to make was about Kate and outer-space. Kate's  &quot;Hello
Earth&quot; is admittedly a slow, overtly &quot;sad&quot; song that follows
traditions of the  ballad quite closely in some respects. In the context of &quot;The
Ninth Wave&quot; it sounds  like an inseparable part of the &quot;inner
necessity&quot; of the recording as a whole, and it  works. 
</P>
<P>But in the early 1970s--when Kate saw Elton John as her &quot;hero&quot;,
and was creating  within the original context of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
itself--she wrote another song about the  loneliness of an astronaut stranded in
space. Fans (for want of official knowledge)  sometimes refer to that song as &quot;Keeping
Me Waiting&quot;. Strangely--and  effectively--the desperation felt by the
character in that song is expressed through  one of Kate's most lightly
charming, even playful, vocals. &quot;The air,&quot; as the character  explains,
&quot;is getting thin&quot;, and he/she is becoming light-headed. It's a tragic
song  about the delirium preceding a person's cold and miserable death on an
isolated,  forgotten moon. But in parts, it sounds more like a jolly, skipping
little song for  children. 
</P>
<P>Given our previous knowledge of Kate's own early song about space, it makes 
perfect sense that her interpretation--her incarnation--of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;--should
be  communicated within a lightly dancing musical context. We hear Kate's rocket
man,  lonelier than he could ever tell us through any hackneyed lament or dirge,
withdraw  instead little by little into his own weird, private, illusory and
alien plane--&quot;high as a  kite.&quot;

<P>In today's San Francisco Chronicle (Nov. 24) Joel Selvin, the pop music

</P>
<P>&quot;More of a tribute than intended. Every big-name artist trotted out on
this all-star  extravaganza fails to improve on the original versions. Elton
John never sounded so  good.&quot;. 
</P>
<P>.. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The only originality brought to the ambitious project comes from Kate
Bush,  who gives a vaguely reggae-ized treatment to 'Rocket Man' and refuses to
change  the lyrics' gender; and Sinead O'Connor, who puts her trademark
emotionalism to  good work on the relatively obscure 'Sacrifice.'

</P>
<P>Well, surprisingly enough, I found it today. The cover is a photo of KaTe
almost  identical to the one on the This Woman's Work single, except she's
smiling a bit  more. There's also a purple bit at the top and bottom. The
CD-single comes in a sort  of gatefold Ecopak thingy with the same shot of KaTe
inside the gatefold. The  catalog(ue) number is Mercury TRICD2 in the UK or 866
311-2 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>BTW, Candle in the Wind is (P) 1991 Novercia Ltd, which might imply it was a
 last minute job just as a B-side for Rocket Man and not something she did at
the  same time.

03:40:37 -0800 <BR> Subject: Rocket Man/Candle in the Wind 
</P>
<P>I've been asked by IED among others to say more about this... 
</P>
<P>After looking more closely at the cover, two things have become apparent:
The  graphic designer who did the cover doesn't know what Uillean pipes are
(they've  spelt it &quot;Villean&quot;!) and both &quot;Rocket Man and &quot;Candle
in the Wind&quot; are on the cover,  so I s'pose that makes it a double-A-side. 
</P>
<P>Now that I've heard CitW on CD, I can describe it a bit better. The 
instrumentals sound as if they've all been done on the Fairlight -there are
vague  swirly droney Fairlighty sounds in the background (which swirl around the
sound  picture rather disconcertingly if you happen to be wearing headphones at
the time  8^) and the melody is carried by something vaguely piano-like. 
</P>
<P>Interestingly, there are no musician credits on the back for CitW, which
probably  means either KaTe did it all herself, or maybe it hadn't even been
recorded when  they did the cover artwork.... 
</P>
<P>The vocals are amazing and beautiful - IMHO a definite improvement on the 
original, although it is a while since I last heard that.... 
</P>
<P>The BV bit at the very end reminds me a lot of the ending of the album mix
of  Enya's &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; (or maybe nearer to the single mix) but
maybe thats just  me... 
</P>
<P>The instrumental version of CitW is also on the CD-single and 12&quot;.
Strangely,  some main vocals have been left in towards the end. 
</P>
<P>The posterbag the 7&quot; is in has the same monochrome photo of KaTe as the
cover  on it, and seems to get a bit battered by the time it gets into the
record shop, as  posterbags tend to do...

03:02:33 -0800 <BR> Subject: Rocket Man Video 
</P>
<P>Ok folks. 
</P>
<P>The big news is that Rocket Man has entered the Gallup charts at no 13! This
is  absolutely amazing to my mind. This means it should at least peak in the top
ten. I  don't think she's done that well in the singles chart since RUTH. I knew
the British  public wasn't completely ignorant! 
</P>
<P>As I write this there is no sign of anyone else posting a description of the
Rocket  Man video, so here goes, with apologies if somebody else gets there
first. 
</P>
<P>It was shown on the ITV Chart Show on Saturday 30/11 (that's 11/30 if you're
 stateside) here in the UK. 
</P>
<P>The first thing I should say is that it is entirely in Black and White. Does
this  mean she thinks she's getting old and her wrinkles won't show up (a la
Madonna)?  Or is there another reason? 
</P>
<P>Quick storyboard: 
</P>
<P>Opens with Kate playing the keyboard, facing the camera. (She doesn't look
old!) 
</P>
<P>The next scene is reminiscent of Don't Give Up, with Alistair Anderson
cuddling  Kate whilst playing the concertina, although this time they're both
facing the  camera. The backdrop is a moon. 
</P>
<P>The video is sad in places, like in the band scenes where Alan Murphy is 
conspicuous by his abscence. For anyone who doesn't know, he has passed away 
since the song was recorded. An acoustic guitar sits on a chair where he might
have  stood. At one point it is shown by itself and a candle burns beside it. I
thought this  was a very nice touch and when I finally understood its
significance, after the 3rd or  4th time of watching, I felt very moved. I can't
decide if it is also a reference to the  B side. Comments? Kate strums (what I
think is) a toy guitar (I'll be embarrassed if  it turns out to be a genuine
instrument) while bopping around enthusiastically. She's  wearing a dark
skirt-suit. 
</P>
<P>The rest of the band are all there, including a despondent looking Davey
Spillane.  They cut the video off before the Uillean pipes kick in so throughout
the video he  just sits with his pipes across his knee while everyone else jams.
In fact he looks  thoroughly fed up as the video goes on. 
</P>
<P>Kate in a space helmet with a starry background and a waxing moon for a few 
lines. 
</P>
<P>Kate then appears in a trouser-suit, conducting to the sea and sky. The sea
is  actually a piece of billowing cloth and she makes stars explode and the moon
rise and  stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>Vickie will be interested to hear that Kate has not cut her hair. In fact it
is much  longer than ever before. She's facing away for the whole of this scene
and she could  almost sit on it. I have to say that Audrey went green, purple,
red and pink all in the  short space of time this scene lasted. Jealous? Nah! 
</P>
<P>Some more band shots and I don't think I've mentioned the two female backing
 singers yet. 
</P>
<P>As I said, it cuts off before the Uillean pipes kick in, so I don't know
what  happens after that. I presume we get to see how Uillean pipes are played
at last.

<BR> Subject: CitW 
</P>
<P>IED won't belabor the point here, because these days he is able to see that 
listeners will either like a Kate Bush song or they won't, and that IED's
comments  won't change anything. But he simply must say that the one comment
posted so far  about Kate's cover of &quot;CitW&quot;--Donna's--was just plain
wrong. KT's &quot;CitW&quot; may be  a lot of things but one thing it definitely
is not is &quot;too much like Elton John's original  version&quot;! 
</P>
<P>As with her &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, Kate has begun by completely
disassembling the  original song, reducing it to its melodic and harmonic
essentials. In fact, this process  has been taken further in &quot;CitW&quot;
than in &quot;RM&quot;. For godssake she even changed the  basic melody in
several places! Not to speak of the accompaniment, which is glaringly  devoid of
any of of Elton John's stylistic trademarks. The fact is that Kate Bush's  &quot;Candle
in the Wind&quot; is about as unlike Elton John's--any of Elton John's--versions
 as it's possible to imagine! It's also indescribably brilliant. 
</P>
<P>By the way, both Q Magazine and National Public Radio have reviewed the Two 
Rooms album ( Q in only one sentence), and both said essentially that the whole 
album was full of unimaginative cover versions with the exception of Kate's &quot;Rocket
 Man&quot;. IED is pleased and surprised to see his own judgment for once
seconded by  the professionals.

</P>
<P>The Rocket Man video was shown (for the first time, as far as I know) on the
 ITV Chart Show on Saturday - or at least the first half of it was. 
</P>
<P>It was directed by Julian Doyle (I think), who also did the film &quot;Brazil&quot;,
and the  effects were done by a guy who worked on the Star Wars films (not that
there were  a lot of special f/x that I could see...). 
</P>
<P>The whole thing is shot in black &amp; white. It starts with KaTe singing at
a  keyboard, which is gradually tilting from side-to-side. It then cuts to KaTe
standing  next to a guy playing the concertina with his arms around her, with a
big moon (or  sun, or something) behind them. They are also slowly tilting. The
next shot is a close  up of KaTe in a space helmet against a starry background.

</P>
<P>During the chorus we see KaTe and the band (Del, a drummer (possibly
Charlie),  the concertinist, two backing singers and a piper (presumably Liam)
sitting with his  pipes looking bored (presumably we see him playing in the
laster part of the video  that wasn't shown)). There is a lot of dark billowing
parachute-fabric-type stuff in  the background. KaTe is wearing a dark jacket
and skirt, and is strumming a  minature guitar-type thing (there's probably a
name for this...), which struck me as  slightly bizarre at the time...8^). 
</P>
<P>The next scene (I think, this is all from memory) is of KaTe (from behind) 
pretending to be a conductor in front of a starscape and more billowy parachute 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>That's just about all there was - it was only played up to the end of the
second  chorus. 
</P>
<P>You'll be glad to hear she's still looking very good indeed -certainly
better than  she did the VH-1 interview, IMHO. Her hair looked longer than waist
length - I  don't remember seeing it as long as this before...

Subject: Rocket Man Video 
</P>
<P>The video for Rocket Man was featured on ITV's &quot;The Chart Show&quot; on
Saturday  morning. Here is my (non-artistic) description of it. I am sure
someone like Scott or  Andy will post a better account, but here goes. 
</P>
<P>It is an black and white and features Kate and the musicians who recorded
the  song (except for late Alan Murphy). The directory of photography was Julian
Doyle  (worked on Brazil) and special effects were by Richard Conway (worked on
Star  Wars). 
</P>
<P>I'll describe the scenes and indicate which lines of the song they
correspond to. 
</P>
<P>The video starts with close up of Kate at the keyboard as the camera rocks
from  side to side. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I miss the earth ...&quot; - shot changes to Kate with arms crossed
and Alistair  Anderson playing the concertina with his arms around Kate, both in
front of a  backdrop of the moon. Camera still doing rocking motion. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And I think ..&quot; - shot changes to Kate &quot;strumming&quot; a
ukulele (closet George  Formby fan?) in front of the band (Del, Charlie Morgan,
Alistair Anderson and  Davey Spillane [N.B. since I don't actually know what
they look like I am assuming  these last three] - there is no substitute
guitarist). 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no, no ...&quot; - Kate &quot;waddles&quot; back and forth (sorry
there is no better word to  describe the way she moves! Nearest equivalent is
Jack Lemmon in Some Like It  Hot!) in front of the band. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Rocket man burning ...&quot; - Facial shots of Kate and two black
backing singers.  Wind machine blows their hair back. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Mars aint ...&quot; - Shot of Kate in space helmet against background
of stars 
</P>
<P>&quot;And all this science...&quot; - Kate with back to the camera
conducting on a surface  of black waves (the effect that is made by blowing air
under velvet material or  similar) to a background of shooting stars, starbursts
etc. as the moon rises up. 
</P>

</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no, no ...&quot; - Kate does her waddle. 
</P>
<P>&quot;And I think it's ...&quot; Individual shots of the band members shot
against waving  curtains. There is a shot of a guitar resting on a chair and a
candle burning - clearly  in memory of Alan Murphy. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Rocket man burning ...&quot; Close up of Kate and singers again with
wind blowing  hair back. 
</P>
<P>The video was cut here (this show usually cuts the end of) so I don't know
how  the fade out is handled. 
</P>
<P>All in all fairly simple and the overall effect for me was rather humourous
- what  with the George Formby impression and the funny walk - I hope that was
Kate's  intention.

<BR> Subject: more on reviews 
</P>
<P>The New York Times today briefly reviewed Two Rooms, saying that nearly 
everything on the album was a pale imitation of Elton John's original versions,
with  the exception of Sting's &quot;Come Down in Time&quot;, which, the paper
said, had some  energy; Kate Bush's &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, a &quot;pop-reggae&quot;
version that was worth hearing;  and Sinead O'Connor's version of &quot;Sacrifice&quot;
(deemed the album's standout). 
</P>
<P>The Los Angeles Times's Robert Hilburn reviewed the album even more briefly,
 and had virtually nothing good to say about it. Even Kate was lumped in with
the  &quot;imitators&quot; who made Elton's originals seem all the stronger,
though Hilburn's list  didn't really seem to be criticizing Kate in any explicit
way. He concluded by  recommending the accompanying Polygram
video-cassette/-disk release, which  features much more of Elton John and Bernie
Taupin themselves than of the  album's cover artists. 
</P>
<P>IED awaits with bated breath word from any of Love-Hounds's British-based 
KorrespondenTs who may by now have seen Kate's new video for &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
on  TV...

<P>&gt; The big point. My copy has *massive* noise during the instrumental
version of  CitW. A really big burst of static goes from 0:58 to 1:00 or so,
another two I noticed  of shorter duration. Is this my copy, or is Del really
*that* bad an engineer? If you  don't 
</P>
<P>Yep, my CD-single has a burst of static on the left channel round about 0:56
- 1:00. 
</P>
<P>Maybe this lends weight to my theory that CitW was knocked together in a day
 or so, after they decided to release RM as a single? Not that it sounds like a
rushed  job musically (although maybe it could have been a little bit more
innovative in that  department)...

</P>
<P>I am not IED0DXM@MVS.OAC.UCLA.EDU. I didn't say: 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED noticed that Drukman listened to &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
(though--alas,  unsurprisingly--with insufficient care) at |&gt;oug /\lan's
invitation. 
</P>
<P>It wasn't *quite* like that. Our entourage (including Blast From The Past 
Love-Hound Par Excellence Joe Turner) arrived at |&gt;oug's apartment, whereupon
I  immediately *requested* that he play it for me. A number of the entourage 
(including Joe) were crestfallen - &quot;you're not going to like it.&quot; &quot;Oh,
I'm so SICK of  that song...&quot; But a combination of |&gt;oug's mighty stare
and my persistent whine  prevailed and we were treated to the track. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Since |&gt;oug has expressed a very positive opinion of the single (at
least of the  a-side), IED wonders whether there was any substantive argument
between  Drukman and |&gt;oug about the recording's merits. 
</P>
<P>Here's what the conversation went like, more or less: 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;That's IT?&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;Whaddya mean THAT'S IT?&quot; 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;It sounds like someone pushed the `reggae' button on their casio
home synth  toy!&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;It's GREAT!&quot; 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;No it isn't!&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;Yes it is!&quot; 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;Why is it great?&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;Why ISN'T it great?&quot; (Those who have spent time with |&gt;oug
know that this is  Classic Doug Alan Argument Technique. I usually get suckered
by it.) 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;Well, it's so... I dunno... unremarkable.&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;What did you expect?&quot; 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;From KATE? I expected something unbelievably mind-blowingly
orgasmic! This  is just... well... bland!&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;Oh, you just didn't listen to it properly.&quot; 
</P>
<P>J: &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 
</P>
<P>D: &quot;If you listened to it properly, you'd know how great it is.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(At this point, Bob and Joe chimed in with &quot;oh come on, it's really
ordinary,  admit it you silly doug person&quot; remarks, but Doug was quite
adamant. He said  something like, &quot;You people are pathetic - you've lost
the ability to appreciate Kate.&quot;  We retorted, &quot;if she'd do something
worth appreciating, we'd be first in line to  appreciate it.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>I have to admit that, excellent though Doug's sound system is, I was being 
distracted by people waving CDs in my face, not to mention the emotional rush of
 hanging out with the Mutant Music Lover crew again, preparing for the cut and 
thrust of stimulating intellectual discussion of New Music (&quot;This thing
SUCKS.&quot; &quot;No  it DOESN'T.&quot; &quot;Yes it DOES.&quot; &quot;You're a
TWERP.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>In all fairness, I *do* need to listen to the track a few more times before
arriving  at a concrete decision about it, and I fully intend to pick up the
RM/CitW single  within the next few days, but that was my initial impression:
distinctly  underwhelming.
