</P>
<P>As for Kate these days, the album I have been listening the most (almost 
exclusively) is (gasp!) Lionheart. The more I think about Lionheart, the better
it gets.  I literally find myself consumed by some of its songs, singing them
spontaneously in  public. In particular, there is a pattern in chord progression
and change that I have  noted in a majority of the songs on that album, that is
just all-consuming...  absolutely Kate at her peak of brilliance. I can't for
the life of me figure how *she*  figured out how to put those sequences
together. Absolutely miraculous. This for me  is where Kate's divinity surfaces
*without a shadow of doubt*. It is there for the  asking... one need only
discover to be sure.

</P>
<P>However, sound-quality-wise, my very favorite album is the English LP of 
Lionheart. None of Kate's albums have sounded as warm, yet crisply lush. I'm not
 into audiophile lingo, so I don't know if that type of thing has a name. Our 
audiophile friend, who was mainly into classical (BIG-time!) also thought that 
Lionheart (English LP) had the best sound of any pop album he'd ever heard.

</P>
<P>Wow
</P>
<P>I've always seen this as a song about show business generally, and Kate's
short  experience of it in 1978. It assembles a collection of images - the old
(and definitely  gay) shakesperian ham, the starlet who has to sleep her way to
her first role, the  struggling band being shafted by a crooked manager, the
agent. These represent the  more sordid side of the entertainment world. Opposed
to that is the chorus which  represents the sheer magic of perfrorming. That
rush of energy and the sense of  union with the audience.......and the vaseline?
Clearly a double meaning. Kate  always has tried to double, if not triple pack
her images. 
</P>
<P>In an interview at the time of *Lionheart* (no doubt Ron Hill can give us
chapter  and verse) upon being asked about *Wow* Kate explained it related to
her  experiences of showbusiness, and added &quot;there are an awful lot of of
homosexuals in  showbusiness - but that's just an observation not a criticism.&quot;
Kate has of course  worked with a number of people who coincidently happen to be
gay. As you all  know she has suffered the death of people close to her through
aids. Here's a quote  from Kate I've just dug up from an interview on a Montreal
radio station in  November 1978: 
</P>
<P>&quot;*Wow* is really...about the business that we're in...the fact that you
do get the  people that try to rip you off, and you do get bad scenes, and you
do get disillusioned  and it's not all good; but when it's good it's just...WOW!
It's just phenomenal.  Again it's that feeling of purpose...when you're doing
the thing you know you're  here for. There's no other feeling!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Is there any Kate news I hear you all asking. The short answer is no (&quot;and
I can't  comment on why there's no news!&quot;)

<P>Andrew Marvick asked about the reference to ravens in &quot;Oh, England&quot;:

</P>
<P>I too wondered about the reference in Lionheart to ravens. I had a chance to
visit  the Tower of London several years ago and behold there are ravens
everywhere.  They actually keep a small collection of the somewhat ill tempered
birds there. The  myth is that the Tower will crumble if ravens no longer grace
the gounds. As the  Tower goes so goes England. I stood on the small green lost
in rapture (perhaps  suspended in gaffa), watching the birds, playing the song
through my mind. The  locals must have thought me quite daft.

<P>In fact the ravens at the Tower have had their wings clipped so they cannot
fly  away! Perhaps that explains their bad temper! I think you are right about
the myth -  though I always get confused with this and the apes on Gibralter.

18:11:08 GMT &gt;Now for the puzzler: <BR> Subject: Lionheart handwritten
</P>
<P>&gt; Why is the title of &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot; hand-lettered
on the cover of my  Lionheart CD, when all the other titles are typeset? I tried
grep'ing for this in the  archives and the Garden, but all I got was the
haystack. 
</P>
<P>As for the &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot; logo, on my Woman's Work CD
set, the  &quot;Lionheart&quot; CD also prints the lyrics, and the lyrics are
also uniquely handwritten  compared to the typesetting to the rest. Kate
considered the song very important to  her. (I wish I was home so I could refer
to quotes she may have made on The Visual  Documentary book about her. (Printed
right after the release of &quot;The Whole Story&quot;  and available at any
Tower record store that sells books). Written in the tradition of  the World War
I poems, (very famous in Brit Lit to this day) she sings from the  point of view
from a soldier just shot in the war and in love with his country. Kate is 
probably also indirectly singing the love for her country, anthemlike. So it's a
 personal choice on her part. Not bad since until &quot;The Dreaming,&quot; Kate
did not have  complete control over her art.

<P>I've always thought that Kashka was a female name, but some people have told

irrelevant to the  song, though, unless Kashka is definitely a male name. 
</P>
<P>I spent about three hours a couple weeks back in the library looking for 
references to the name Kashka. I searched through everything from books on 
ancient Mesopotamia to Russian poetry. The only reference to the name Kashka I 
could find is the name of a river in Russia, the Kashka-Darya river. The wife of
 Hamurabi was Kausha (but that's not Kashka...). Kaska is a whole race of
people. 
</P>
<P>Other interesting tidbits: &quot;Katherine&quot; means &quot;clean, pure&quot;
and &quot;Alan&quot; means  &quot;uncertain&quot;.

<P>But &quot;another man&quot; can have lots of different meanings. Kashka
could be male.  Kashka could be female and married. Kashka could be living in
sin with *yet*  another man. Kashka could be living in sin with several men. 
</P>
<P>I always thought of the the song as being about nosey people in a small town
 being more concerned about what's going on in other people's houses than in 
making the most of their own lives. While on the other hand, Kashka and her
(his?)  lover know how to be happy. 
</P>
<P>For this meaning, Kashka could be either male or female, it doesn't really
matter.  But if Kashka is *definitely* male, then that is such a strong image
that it shifts the  meaning of the song to be about homosexuality (and a lot of
people tell me that it  is), but I don't see homosexuality as playing an
important part in the song.

<P>Oh, I think it does touch on homosexuality. But that's not the point of the
song -  the point is, as you say, about the nosy people who spend so much time
poking into  others' businesses that they miss out on happiness.

</P>
<P>A long time ago I too wondered whether or not &quot;Kashka from Baghdad&quot;
is about  two male lovers or a more traditional affair. I thought that the name
&quot;Kashka&quot; is a  female name, so my predilection was in favor of a
heterosexual affair. I don't know  why I thought the name Kashka is a female
name -- it just sounded female to me. In  any case, I went to the library and
searched high and low for any reference to the  name Kashka in any book and
could not find a single one. Later, I asked John  Carder Bush in person whether
Kashka is male or female, and he said that Kashka is  male. There you have it.

<P>Who is the &quot;Cripen&quot;(Crippen?) referred to in Coffee Homeground? 
</P>
<P>Well, while I can't give an answer with certainty, sitting here at my
terminal I  discover a card catalog listing for a book entitled The Trial of
Hawley Harvey  Crippen, from the series &quot;Notable British trials&quot;,
along with the note &quot;Dr. Crippen  was tried in 1910, for the murder of his
wife, Cora Crippen.&quot; Must have been some  fantastic trial, as the book is
over 200 pages long, with even a few pictures. Perhaps  he poisoned her!

<P>Indeed he did, and supposedly several others, though i think the evidence is
much  weaker. but his name at the time was synonymous with mass murder by poison

</P>
<P>Also on &quot;Lionheart&quot; in the song &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; some
german words  appear: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Schnitzel, wunderbar&quot; (&quot;Schnitzel, wonderfull&quot;) 
</P>
<P>and, as I believe, in a broad german sounding accent: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Steak, oh&quot; (spoken somewhat like &quot;Shdeag, ohh&quot;). 
</P>
<P>My dictionary says &quot;Schnitzel&quot; is &quot;veal cutlet&quot;. &quot;Schnitzel&quot;
is in germany almost  synonymous with &quot;Wiener Schnitzel&quot;
(bread-crumbed). The most germans like  Schnitzel very much, and especialy
children. But why theese words in the song have  been put into german, I have no
hunch. Does anybody know something about how  well kate speaks german ?

<P>Bertolt Brecht wrote the words for &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; (1928-- Mac
the Knife,  etc?) and other plays, especially with Kurt Weill. Extremely
hardhitting German  political musical cabaret, in *seedy*, realistic settings.
Hal Willner's &quot;Lost in the  Stars&quot; tribute compilation (to Weill) has
fascinating liner notes, along with a  phenomenal range of songs and settings.
(Made me want to read a bio of Weill--  he was a heroic guy!)

<P>Hi, 
</P>
<P>this question is aimed at the other german readers of this newsgroup, but 
probably the english love-hounds know the answer as well: 
</P>
<P>i still can't figure out what the background voice is saying at the end of
Coffee  Homeground. The FAQ says: 
</P>
<P>This song features two lines (one repeated again) in German, but it's not as
 prominent as in Hello Earth. The lines read &quot;Es schmeckt wunderbar&quot;
(it tastes  wonderful) and &quot;Noch ein Glass mein Liebchen/Liebling&quot;
(another glass, my  darling). 
</P>
<P>but that's what i hear (Lionheart CD, EMI UK): 
</P>
<P>2:49 Noch ein Glass, mein Liebchen 
</P>
<P>3:02 Es schmeckt wunderbar 
</P>
<P>3:09 [???? (4 syllables)] 
</P>
<P>The last line isn't a repetition of one of the lines above. At first i
thought she says  &quot;Entschuldigung&quot;, but listening again (over
headphones), i realized that it's probably  something else. Does anybody know
what?

Not &quot;know&quot;, but as far as I can figure out, she says:  
</P>
<PRE>
&quot;Es schmeckts wunderbar&quot; (1st time) 

	|------ this is wrong and doesn't belong there, nevertheless it's clearly audible. 

&quot;Es schmeckt wunderbar&quot; (2nd time) 
         +++---- this is almost inaudible 
</PRE>
<P>Obviously the two phrases aren't the same recording repeated, but
nevertheless I  think it's the same sentence. Remember that Kate doesn't speak
German and as  such won't pronounce this perfectly - neither the first nor the
second time. 
</P>
<P>All this is obviously only my very own opinion.

</P>
<P>Hello again, 
</P>
<P>Thanks to all of you who answered my question, which turned out to be quite 
difficult, but your suggestions have been a great help. I played the track also
to my  colleagues in office. They suggested &quot;dann sterb' ich wohl&quot;
(i'll die then). Btw: the  previous line was identified as 'Mir schmeckts
wunderbar'. Now we have a lot of  words to choose from: 
</P>
<P>und steh ich noch <BR> ich stell licht nun <BR> dann sterb -ig wohl <BR>
dein  nur 
</P>
<P>It's hard construct a sentence that makes sense with this words. Sorry Uli,
i still  don't think it's &quot;Es schmeckt wunder(bar)&quot; again. 
</P>
<P>Yesterday i listened for almost half an hour to a 6-second-loop of the line
in  question, but that didn't help. And played backwards it makes no sense
either. 
</P>
<P>So i summarized what i know about the song: 
</P>
<P>The main voice is sung by a person who thinks that he/she is being poisoned.

</P>
<P>I suppose the background voice is the suspect: she offers the potential
victim a  drink, points out how good it tastes and ... a toast would be
appropriate here. 
</P>
<P>It's obviously not &quot;Prost&quot; (cheers), but &quot;(Auf) dein Wohl&quot;
(Your health) is closer.  So i think it could be &quot;Dein stetig Wohl&quot; or
&quot;Dein staendig Wohl&quot; (Your steady  health). This would fit in the
context and it roughly matches the vocals. There's just  one problem: I've never
heard that line here in Germany. Is &quot;Your steady health!&quot; a  common
toast in English? 
</P>
<P>(Perhaps that line isn't German at all. Anybody tried French ? :-)

<P>(Yes, I am at the university today! Science must go on! So, let's fill up

</P>
<P>yesterday I checked Coffee Homeground on my Tour-bootlegs. On the 
Manchester tape you didn't get anything, on the Amsterdam tape, she definitely 
sings something different (!), but there's also no chance to get it and on the
Bristol  tape, she sings it 'relatively' clear and to me this sounds like: &quot;Dann
staerk dich  doch/noch.&quot; (brace yourself..) 
</P>
<P>But I am not sure (you can't, with these noisy tapes!). 
</P>
<P>&quot;Dann staerk dich doch&quot; makes sense in the context and I will use
it until  someone comes up with a better one (with proof!). 
</P>
<P>It's not on Live in Paris. Are there any others?
