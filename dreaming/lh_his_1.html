<P>Welcome to mail.katebush. 
</P>
<P>Your current moderator is ihnp4!gargoyle!sphinx!r032 (SamR). 
</P>
<P>I don't really want to moderate this group, partially because I am not a
Kate  Bush fanatic, but also because there is a rather severe limit on my
computing/cpu  time (UofC likes to charge for computer use, and although I get
some free time in  exchange for work, this free time is limited). 
</P>
<P>If you said you liked KB in your letter to me, you got put on this list, so
you may  wish to send me a letter requesting your removal. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately (or fortunately) I will be on vacation from Aug 28 to Sept
14th, so  unless someone takes over moderation, the group will be effectively
dead during that  period. Sorry to create the group right before my vacation,
but it does give someone  incentive to take over moderation :-). 
</P>
<P>People Currently on the list: (so you know who your fellow fanatics are) 
</P>
<P>ihnp4!gargoyle!sphinx!r032 - Me. <BR> ihnp4!ihlpg!jeand - AMBAR <BR>

ihnp4!sdscvax!sdcc13!valerie - Val Polichar <BR>
ihnp4!alberta!sask!zaphod!pault - Paul Tildsley 
</P>
<P>Well, I'm not much of a Kate Bush fan, but I thought I'd start the group off
with  some possible topics of discussion: 
</P>
<P>1) Does anyone think she'll tour the US in support of the new single/album? 
</P>
<P>Has anyone heard any tour news at all? 
</P>
<P>2) Anyone want to talk about some neat rare stuff they have (live tapes or 
whatever) ? 
</P>
<P>3) What do people think of the new song (has she sold out or whatever)? 
</P>
<P>4) Will she do well on the US charts (ha ha ha ha ha ha). 
</P>
<P>I will occasionally attempt to sumarize interesting points to the net.

<P>This &quot;issue&quot; contains

<P>AMBAR is willing to be moderator after he returns to school, but he didn't
send  me his address, but he will be moderator as of the beginning/middle of
September.

</P>
<P>The Following is a letter from Valerie, she is now moderator until AMBAR

</P>
<P>First of all - 
</P>
<P>I would be willing to moderate the Kate Bush group until September 20th,
when  school starts again, but someone would need to continue after that... So
if you want  me to, lemme know. 
</P>
<P>Now - to answer the discussion questions -
</P>
<P>I really like the new song. I think the heavy rhythm is appealing, and quite
 different from her work before. The interesting thing is that radio stations
are  actually playing this one. Maybe it'll be a hit (?)... which would surprise
me, but it is  looking more and more possible, at least out here in S.D. where I
hear the new song  about twice every three days so far... 
</P>
<P>If I send somebody a blank cassette would they tape Kate's live album for
me?

</P>
<P>That's all for today. Stand by for the thousands of lines from Doug Alan
that will  undoubtably be arriving in the near future. 
</P>
<P>Don't forget, Valerie is now the moderator (and for that I thank her), so
send  stuff to her at ihnp4!sdcsvax!sdcc13!valerie. AMBAR will take her place in
a few  weeks, and (hopefully) he'll send her a message when he is ready to take
over and  she'll let everyone know.

<P>I'm not sure the mailing list was set up correctly when I sent these
following  messages, so I'm going to send them again. You may want to drop me a
note telling  me that you got this so that I will know if everything is working
(also tell me if you  had already received these): 
</P>

list 
</P>
<P>Okay, okay! I'll do it. All this bouncing around of moderation is making me
dizzy!  But who needs a moderator? I've set up an unmoderated mailing list at
mit-eddie  called &quot;love-hounds&quot;. Any requests to be put on or taken
off the list should be sent to  me or to &quot;love-hounds-request&quot;.
Mit-eddie is on the ArpaNet and talks to genrad,  harvard, and ihnp4 among
others. 
</P>
<P>&gt; From Valerie <BR> &gt; I really like the new song. I think the heavy
rhythm is appealing, and quite  different from her work before. 
</P>
<P>I like &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; a lot too. But I'm somewhat
disappointed -- it's  definitely a move towards being more commercial, which I'm
not so wild about. It's  the first song of hers I've ever heard with a catchy
melody, or with any type of real  &quot;hook&quot; in it. Also, it's simpler
than anything on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and I'm really fond  of the rich
layered complexity of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. The lyrics for &quot;Running Up
That  Hill&quot; I find stunningly good though. 
</P>
<P>The B-side, &quot;Under The Ivy&quot;, is very simple, but I think it's
really great! It's  very very sad, and powerfully emotional musically and
lyrically. The lyrics are  perfect. The whole song is just about as good as
anything Kate's ever done. My only  complaint is that it is so short. 
</P>
<P>&gt; The interesting thing is that radio stations are actually playing this
one. Maybe  it'll be a hit (?)... which would surprise me, but it is looking
more and more  possible, at least out here in S.D. where I hear the new song
about twice every three  days so far... 
</P>
<P>They are playing RUTH in Boston on WFNX every now and then. I was driving 
in my car last Sunday, and they played it. I nearly crashed! I'd NEVER before
heard  a Kate Bush song on the radio when I hadn't requested one or played one
myself (I  do a radio show for WMBR, MIT's radio station once or twice a month).

</P>
<P>We can always hope it will become a hit, but I'm really not wild about the
idea of  Kate becoming as big as Michael Jackson or anything (though she once
was in  England). There are many Kate Bush fans who want nothing more for her to
be the  number one popular musician in the world. I think that this will never
happen, and  certainly couldn't without Kate making more artistic sacrifices,
which I couldn't  bear to think about. 
</P>
<P>&gt; If I send somebody a blank cassette would they tape Kate's live album
for me? 
</P>
<P>Sure, I'll do it. It's not actually an album, but rather a 4 song E.P. You
can often  find this as a 7 inch for $2 or $3, but the Jappanese import 12 inch
I have I'm sure  sounds a lot nicer. Do you have Kate's non album singles and
B-sides? There are a  whole bunch, and they're all great of course. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;

<P>From nessus Sat Aug 17 00:02:31 1985 <BR> Subject: Reply to discussion
topics <BR>
</P>
<P>&gt; From: ihnp4!gargoyle!sphinx!r032 (SamR - Sam Rebelsky) <BR> &gt; 1)
Does anyone think she'll tour the US in support of the new single/album?  Has
anyone heard any tour news at all? 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush hasn't done a concert even in England since 1979. The only concert
 tour she ever did was for &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; and &quot;Lionheart&quot;
and it was the most  elaborate production possibly imaginable. It took months of
preparation and then  toured around England and Europe. Basically, it took up a
year, and at Kate's  current rate of making albums once ever two or three years,
it seems unlikely that  she can afford the time for another concert tour. 
</P>
<P>Even if she did, it seems unlikely that she would bring it to the United
States. It  would probably be too expensive. The last one invloved more than 40
people, and all  sorts of sets, etc. Also Kate doesn't fly in airplanes
(something about an ear problem  that occurs during the pressure changes that
occur in airplanes). She was going to  come to the U.S. in 83, I think, via the
QE2, in promotion of the Mini-LP to do TV  shows and record signing things, but
the QE2 was broken or in the Fauklins or  something (when was the Fauklins
fiasco?). 
</P>
<P>&gt; Anyone want to talk about some neat rare stuff they have (live tapes or
 whatever) ? 
</P>
<P>Well I have all the non-album singles and B-sides. I have a bootleg concert 
record, a tape of the concert she did where Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley were 
guests, several hours of interviews on audio tape, the concert video tape (and a
 bootleg record of this soundtrack), the &quot;Singles File&quot; video tape,
and 4 or 5 hours of  other Kate Bush video stuff (that is all badly converted by
camera from PAL to  NTSC) including her Xmas special (I also have a bootleg
record of the sound track  to this), a Dutch special of videos for six songs on
&quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, interviews, etc.  I also have all seven issues of
Break-Through, the most recent issue of Homeground,  the most recent issue of
the Kate Bush Club newsletter, and a pile of xeroxes of  many articles that I
got from Hugh Maher. 
</P>
<P>&gt; 3) What do people think of the new song (has she sold out or whatever)?

</P>
<P>I think it's much more a matter of taking what the vile British critics said
too  seriously than selling out. Besides, it isn't really selling out if you
still produce  something that good. I might change my mind, though, if the whole
album is as  commercial as &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. I seriously doubt
that it is, though. 
</P>
<P>&gt; 4) Will she do well on the US charts (ha ha ha ha ha ha). 
</P>
<P>Probably not, but anything's possible. The U.S. music press (unlike the
British  music press) seems to adore Kate Bush -- at least since &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;, that is. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I only could <BR> Be running up that hill <BR> With no problems&quot;

Subject: Dialathon 
</P>
<P>&gt; A proposal for fans of alternative music : Why not use the power of the
 combined readers of Love-Hounds to change the programming of MTV, and put in a 
good word for Kate at the same time? Every Monday-Friday, from 11am-12noon,  MTV
has a dial-in request line, the top 10 vote-getters from which, they play at
6:00  that evening. If everyone who reads this file were to call in on some
agreed-upon  date, and request the &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; video, I bet we
could get it played. At the very  least, it might make Kate's name show more
prominently in their request sheets,  which might lead to slightly improved
rotation. Any opinions? 
</P>
<P>       -Peter Lee 
</P>
<P>Okay, sounds like a good conspiracy to me! Tell us the number. Pick a day.
Tell us  the day. Remind us as the day approaches. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Now when they ring, I get my machine to let them in&quot; 
</P>
<P>Doug 
</P>
<P>P.S. There was a local video channel somewhere that never played Kate Bush,
and  a bunch of people got together, and sent the station a pizza with &quot;Kate
Bush&quot; spelled  out in pepperoni every day until they started playing Kate
Bush vidoes. Now the  station loves her and they play her videos a lot. 
</P>
<P>It just goes to show you, that if you start playing good music, you stop
getting free  pizza.

correctly, she  did &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; and &quot;The Man with the
Child in His Eyes.&quot; A couple of  local Katefans looked at me like I was
crazy when I told them this. Said she never  stepped foot in America at that
point. So: Who is right, Me or them? and if I am,  where can I get a copy of
that segment?

Subject: KBC NEWsletter 
</P>
<P> The latest Kate Bush Club Newsletter finally arrived on IED's doorstep
today,  the last day of 1987. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P> And the other nice little bit in this new KBCN : 
</P>
<P>LOVE-HOUNDS IS MENTIONED! 
</P>
<P>The entry reads, in full: 
</P>
<P>&quot;We were interested to hear from an Australian fan, Bradley Whitehead,
who  described himself as a rabid Kate Bush fanatic! He had heard about the Club
via an  Electronic Mail Network on his work computer -- it is a newsgroup called
&quot;The  Love Hounds Digest&quot;. Has anyone else heard of this?&quot; 
</P>
<P>So get your pens and paper out, folks, and write Lisa a nice little letter,
telling  her &quot;YES, YOU SILLY TWIT! LOVE-HOUNDS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO 
YEARS NOW, AND YOU'VE ONLY BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT A COUPLE OF  DOZEN TIMES ALREADY!&quot;

</P>
<P>That's all for now, folks. Have a Kately New Year! 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Thanks to Bradley W. of Aussieland for finding the magic words.

Subject: New Homeground is out 
</P>
<P> The 30th issue of Homeground (The International Kate Bush Fanzine) arrived 
today, and it included a nice plug for Love-Hounds. Here is the entry: 
</P>
<P>North American Fans In Overdrive! 
</P>
<P>Since we mentioned Watching Storms and The Lionhearts Society in HG no. 29, 
two other fanzines have made an appearance (well, almost, anyway). Still
Breathing,  edited by Robyn Somerville as a successor to the late great
Breakthrough, is most  definitely out (thanks for the copy, Robyn!), and the
details are in our usual fanzine  list. After the Party, edited by Alan Balliot
(of Intergalactic Garage fame) we have  not yet seen, and cannot yet let you
have further details of. 
</P>
<P>At the same time we must also mention Love Hounds, the international
computer  discussion group. Those of you who speak computer will probably be
able to  decipher the following hieroglyphics (&lt;Love-Hounds@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt;).
Having seen  wads of the stuff Love-Hounds produces, we recommend it to those
able to join in.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Open letter of complaint 
</P>
<P>Dear Pseudo-Moderator |&gt;oug /\lan: 
</P>
<P>IED is writing to complain about the consistently unfair editorial advantage
that  you take in arguing on current and ongoing Love-Hounds issues. He would
greatly  appreciate it if you could have the decency to post IED's original
postings without  first chopping them up with intrusive repartee of your own. 
</P>
<P>All Love-Hounds except you have no choice but to write in their own
autonomous  postings. This results in a completely fair exchange of ideas. You,
however, seem to  feel that it is your prerogative as moderator to re-edit IED's
postings (and those of  any other Love-Hound you wish) before the original
posting ever appears in  Love-Hounds. As the editor you unquestionably possess
the power to do this, but  that power is just as unquestionably an unfair one,
and one which you take excessive  advantage of in your arguments with IED. 
</P>
<P>It is understandably annoying to IED to find that a posting (such as his
recent  lengthy consideration of Suspended ) which IED spent several hours
working on  appears in Love-Hounds butchered by you into little info-bits
punctuated by your  own comments. PLEASE HAVE THE COURTESY TO LET IED HAVE HIS
SAY  BEFORE MAKING YOUR RESPONSE. 
</P>
<P>If you agree to do this, and to make your future responses to IED's (and
others')  postings in your own separate postings, IED will in turn make a
greater effort to  shorten the length of his own admittedly wordy postings. But
please don't use the  length of a Love-Hound's posting as an excuse for taking
unfair editorial license.  IED used to think of this forum as a bastion of free
speech, and he would like to feel  that this will become true again.

00:14:16 EST <BR> Subject: This is a test of the new Love-Hounds System 
</P>
<P>Hi all you poor deprived and depraved Love-Hounds. Sorry about the two month
 lapse in Love-Hounds transmissions. The computer (a machine named  &quot;xx.lcs.mit.edu&quot;)
that the Love-Hounds mailing list lived on was decommissioned in  January, and
since then there have been no Love-Hounds transmissions until now.  Delays have
been caused by hardware problems, software problems, and a serious  lack of free
time (caused by me moving to a new abode, my girlfriend departing to  Scotland,
and other miscellanea). 
</P>
<P>The mailing list now lives on my personal workstation &quot;gaffa.mit.edu&quot;,
and we  shall see how it works. This approach has some problems. For example, if
Gaffa  crashes and I am not there, no one else will probably notice that it is
down and  reboot it. Another problem is that I have software testing to do on
occasion on Gaffa,  so sometimes I may have to take the Love-Hounds mailing list
out of commission for  a few days in order to do the work. In a few weeks I will
definitely have to do some  mailer testing. Until then we shall see if this mess
of bailing wire and chewing gum  works....

<P>Hi there. Your humble pseudo-moderator has returned from the beautiful 
Highlands of Scotland to see that Love-Hounds has sunk to a new low. What do I 
find upon returning, but a hundred messages posted to the entire mailing list
saying  &quot;I want one too!&quot;. Haven't any of you read the netiquette
guide? Or at least have  some common sense? Do you think thousands of people
want to read &quot;I want one  too&quot;? Don't you realize that the cost to

<P>Date: Thu, 20 Jul 89 02:36 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Flowers 
</P>
<P> Well, IED went ahead and ordered the flowers, taking the extreme liberty of
 using everyone's &quot;extra&quot; 50 cents from their
now-probably-aborted-or-at-least  -temporarily-suspended-tape-project money,
plus another ten bucks of his own  money. IED believes the flowers worked out
pretty well, considering. 
</P>
<P>After shopping around at more than half a dozen florists' shops here in
L.A., IED  found a florists' international directory, and sure enough--there's a
florist's in  Welling that takes American Express orders by phone! The most
logical solution all  along. Anyway, the other great thing about doing it on
IED's own, by phone, is that  it costs much less money. The total cost was 12.50
Pounds per dozen, with no  surcharges--so IED went ahead and blew the entire
$78.00 from the tape project  &quot;surplus&quot;, plus an additional $10 (and
the $6 phone-call) on four dozen white roses.  The florist's in Welling (very
nice English-sounding lady--it was neat!) couldn't  guarantee ivy, but they said
the white roses were no problem, and they'd intertwine  them with some kind of
green leafy stuff if no ivy were obtainable. Also, they  couldn't deliver on the
30th (Sunday), so it'll go out on Saturday, the 29th. IED  figured these minor
glitches were a small price to pay to be able to get four times as  many roses
as expected. 
</P>
<P>Let IED take this opportunity to thank Neil and several others in the UK for
their  advice and/or generous offers to help with this project. 
</P>
<P>Also, IED has made up a very snazzy-looking laser-printed birthday card from
all  the people who contributed, and has mailed it off to the florist's shop,
with any luck  to arrive by the 29th. (If not, she took down IED's briefer
card-inscriptions over the  phone, but chances are the real card will make it in
time.) 
</P>
<P>IED hopes he hasn't disappointed or offended anyone by taking this liberty. 
Meanwhile he consoles himself by observing that nothing could be a more fitting
gift  to Kate than flowers, in light of the title of her new album-- The Sensual
World.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Vickie's radio program
</P>
<P> Glad to hear from Norvald Stol in Norway. Thanks for the note. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, Vickie Mapes, a longtime Kansas City Kate fan, has been the DJ
of a  weekly 2-hour local radio program called Suspended in Gaffa for over a
year now.  The program's only format limitation is that all the music she plays
is either  composed or performed (or both) by women. Aside from that one
characteristic she  is the most eclectic programmer in the U.S. (Oh, IED forgot
one other  peculiarity--she always plays one recording of Kate's in every
show...) 
</P>
<P>Well, beginning last Sunday (that's right, it was on Katemas!) Vickie began
a  six-hour-long (three-week) special series all about the life and magic of
Kate Bush.  Any- and everyone within range of the Kansas City, Missouri
radio-waves should be  sure to tune in for the second and third shows. It is
well worth it. IED has heard the  first program (on tape) and Vickie did an
extremely good job. Next Sunday she  covers the Never For Ever and The Dreaming
periods. 
</P>
<P>Uh, only thing is, IED doesn't remember the call letters of the station.
Still,  you've all got till Sunday to figure out where it is on the dial...

<P>I just learned of your existence, and now that our friend has returned from
her  protracted occultation I am extra eager to be added to the mailing list. 
</P>
<P>I would eagerly see any compilations of back-material you may have on line. 
</P>
<P>Many thanks!

</P>
<P>Starting on April 1st, I am changing jobs. I will be working at the Media
Lab here  at MIT. Unfortunately, I cannot bring my computer GAFFA.MIT.EDU with
me. I  will eventually acquire a computer there, I am sure, but unless someone
volunteers  to run Love-Hounds, the mailing list and rec.music.gaffa newsgroup
may be down  for an unknown period of time. 
</P>
<P>In order to run Love-Hounds, you should have a Unix machine which you can
use  to run the mailing list, you should know how to make a digest, and you
should know  how to feed mail directly into &quot;/usr/lib/sendmail&quot;. Any
volunteers?

</P>
<P>It seems that there have been a couple of people on here asking -- no,
pleading  -- to be taken off the mailing list. That's all well and good but the
proper thing to  do is note &quot;because I've got access to the newsgroup now.&quot;
Failing to do so will  cause us to wonder if you're leaving Love-Hounds entirely
which will in turn cause  doubts about your mental stability. Everybody knows
that no one who's mental  stability is in question should be permitted to take
such a drastic step as dropping  Love-Hounds.
