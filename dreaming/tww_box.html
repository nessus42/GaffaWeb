IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: KT NEWS STOP PRESS 
</P>
<P>Late news comes from EMI in the UK that EMI are considering the release of 
some of Kate Bush's &quot;oldies&quot; singles on CD. International Compact Disk
Exchange,  better known as ICE, reports in its latest issue that a spokesman for
EMI said the  company was exploring the possibility of entering the CD-3 arena
through the  release of oldies singles by EMI artists, including Kate Bush and
David Bowie. The  company had not set dates yet for such releases, however, and
they had not yet  decided whether the CD-3 format (3&quot; CD single) was the
right way to go, because  they were concerned by reports from consumers of CD-3
adaptors jamming in some  players. Presumably, however, once EMI decide what
format to adopt, one or more  of Kate's early singles will be among the first
CD-singles they release.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: KT NEWS 
</P>
<P>Nothing momentous, although IED supposes that depends on one's point of 
view/degree of sanity. The following tidbits come from the latest (32nd) issue
of  &quot;Homeground&quot;. 
</P>
<P>According to &quot;HG&quot;, EMI are now actively seeking advice from fans
regarding the  possibility of releasing KATE'S B-SIDES ON CD! &quot;HG&quot;'s
report says, &quot;EMI have  asked 'HG' to ask its readers to write to them
stating which package they prefer  and indeed with any other ideas for this
release.&quot; The hypothetical packages they  refer to are: a.) a boxed set of
CD singles, &quot;which would naturally include the now  unobtainable B-sides&quot;;
and b.) a compilation CD containing the non-album tracks  only. &quot;HG&quot;
suggest that the &quot;best&quot; way to express your opinions is to send them
to  &quot;HG&quot; which will forward them to EMI themselves. IED wonders
whether a direct  letter to EMI wouldn't be just as or more effective. Anyway,
it's nice to hear that  the company went to the trouble to contact &quot;HG&quot;
and ask for advice. 
</P>
<P>As for which package is preferable, the boxed set idea, while attractive for
artistic  reasons (keeping all the cover art, preserving the integrity of each
single, etc.),  sounds terribly impractical from a consumer's point of view,
since a box of singles  would certainly cost far more than one or two
compilation CDs, and since it would  inevitably repeat many tracks already
available on CD, and finally since it would be a  terribly wasteful way of using
up CD space. 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, a compilation CD is a more problematic project for
someone  (other than Kate) to undertake: IED has calculated that some tracks
would  necessarily have to be omitted from such a collection, assuming it were
to occupy  only one CD, and especially if one didn't want to omit the various 
instrumental-mixes, single-mixes, video-mixes and extended re-mixes. 
</P>
<P>One thing's for sure, and that is that no matter what EMI decide to do,
they'll  fail to satisfy the diehard fans. The catalogue of CD-unreleased Kate
material  consists of more than 80 &quot;tracks&quot; now, if one includes the
various live performances.  Even if the complete &quot;official&quot; b-sides
were included, what of the unreleased  &quot;Maybe&quot;? or Maurice Jarre's &quot;The
Magician&quot;? or &quot;Be Kind to My Mistakes&quot;? or  &quot;Brazil&quot;?
And the list goes on and on...No, the only thing to do is prepare for 
disappointment. But that doesn't mean Love-Hounds shouldn't take the time to 
write EMI and let them know of our concern.

<P>IED will probably beat me to this, but I just got the latest issue of
Homeground -  in it they talk about some upcoming plans, and I just had to tell
somebody.. 
</P>
<P>EMI WANT YOUR VIEWS ON THE CD SINGLES/B-SIDES ALBUM. 
</P>
<P>EMI are actively considering how to present Kate's singles and non-album
tracks  on CD. Two alternative packages are being considered. The first is a
boxed set of CD  Singles, which would naturally include the now unobtainable
B-sides, and the second  is a compilation CD containing the non-album tracks
only. EMI have asked  Homeground to ask its readers to write to them stating
which package they prefer,  and indeed with any other ideas for this release. We
suggest the easiest thing is for  you all to send your comments to us and we'll
pass them on en masse to the right  person. 
</P>
<P>Personally, I think that having one CD of the B-sides would be easier to
listen to,  but I would MUCH rather have the boxed set of all the singles in my
hands..

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Update on EMI b-sides
compilation 
</P>
<P> Well, there's good news and bad news. IED has received an expectedly brief 
reply to a typically lengthy letter which he had written to EMI in London a
couple of  weeks ago, concerning the organization of a b-sides compilation disk.
Here is the  text of the reply: 
</P>
<P>  18 November 1988 
</P>
<P>Dear Andrew, 
</P>
<P>Thank you for your interesting and well researched letter regarding Kate
Bush. 
</P>
<P>We have no immediate plans of rushing out a compilation similar to the one
you  are suggesting as we are expecting some new product from Kate in the near
future. 
</P>
<P>I will however keep your letter close to hand because we will, I hope, put
out this  type of retrospective in the future. 
</P>
<P>Once again, many thanks for your well considered input. 
</P>
<P> Kind regards, <BR> Steve Davis <BR>
</P>
<P> Product Manager <BR>  EMI Records (UK) <BR>  20 Manchester Square <BR> 
London W1A 1ES <BR>  Telephone 01-486-4488 
</P>
<P> More or less a typical form letter, but the wording leaves open the
possibility that  some of the singles might still be considered for re-release
in CD-single form. Also,  of course, one wonders whether EMI actually believe
that Kate's new album is  nearly ready for release, or whether that's just a
line they're feeding the public.  Surely they couldn't be naive enough to think
she's nearly finished the album?

<P>Peter had more news from the Bush family. There will almost certainly be a
Box  Set released at Christmastime consisting of all Kate's albums to date, and
will  include a double (or possibly triple) album of B-sides and rarities! This
is the project  EMI has been working on for a couple (few?) years now and it
looks like it's really  going to happen. Of course, we all know about the &quot;yes,
it'll be ready&quot; syndrome  where Kate is concerned so don't come back at me
with e-mail letter bombs if it  doesn't actually happen. I'm just telling you
that the Bush family and Peter were all  very confident that it was set to roll.
Cool and really cool!!!

</P>
<P>Now for the Box Set... 
</P>
<P>It will be called &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; and will be released in
early November.  The logo will be some sort of combination of the KT symbol and
the female symbol.  Don't ask me...that's just what Peter said. It should be
priced at around 70 British  pounds so we should all start saving our pennies.
It's almost certain that CBS in  America aren't going to have anything to do
with the thing so we'll all have to pay  import prices (I'd buy import even if
CBS did release it. CBS-phew!) and there  probably will be a limited number
coming over to America. 
</P>
<P>Bad sad news--the track listing that Homeground printed IS in fact the
official  list. Poor Andy &amp; Derek, all that work for nothing! The Set is
supposed to have a  very nice booklet with lots &amp; lots of photos and most
likely a biography. Peter hasn't  actually seen a copy of the Set so he couldn't
give any firm information about  graphics etc. That's all the info I have about
that.

</P>
<P>Between Vickie's postings and various other comments, most of the content of
 the article in ICE has been divulged, so it's not worth posting verbatum. 
</P>
<P>Here's the high points: 
</P>
<P>Kate has been very much involved in assembling the set. TWW will have 29
cuts  (as previously discussed). The 8 discs are housed in a compact box
(whatever that is),  complete with a 26-page book of rare photos. TWW will
retail for 80 pounds =~  $150. It's not limited edition, and should remain in
EMI's catalog for some time. 
</P>
<P>The EMI source quoted is Steve Davis: &quot;She was very enthusiastic about
it. It's  very much her collection. She came up with what songs were included
and how it  should look, right down to the visuals and all the typefaces. I
think that's what  makes the fans happy, if they can see the artist's
finger-prints all over it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;If anything's left out, it's either because it doesn't exist or there
were licensing  problems.&quot;

<P>29 Kate Bush Rarities Part of New Import Set 
</P>
<P>British EMI plans for late October for *This Woman's Work*, an eight-CD Kate
 Bush box set containing two disc's worth of B-sides and other assorted non-LP 
tracks. Always the prolific artist, Bush has produced a large number of non-LP 
tracks since the debut of of her first &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; single in
1978, and this set  aspires to gather them all under one digital roof. The other
six CDs consist of Bush's  studio albums: *The Kick Inside*, *Lionheart*, *The
Dreaming*, *Never For Ever*,  *The Hounds of Love* and *The Sensual World*.
Unfortunately for American fans,  there are no plans for a stateside release of
*This Woman's Work*, because Bush's  recordings are divided between two rival
labels, EMI and CBS. 
</P>
<P>Bush herself had quite a hand in assembling the set. &quot;She was very
enthusiastic  about it,&quot; EMI's Steve Davis told ICE via telephone from
London. &quot;It's very much  her collection. She came up with what songs were
included and how it should look,  right down to the visuals and the typefaces. I
think that's what makes fans happy, if  they can see the artist's fingerprints
all over it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The 29 rarities found on *This Woman's Work* consist of &quot;The Empty
Bullring,&quot;  &quot;Ran Tan Waltz,&quot; &quot;Passing Through Air,&quot; &quot;December
Will Be Magic Again,&quot; &quot;Warm  And Soothing,&quot; &quot;Lord Of The
Reedy River,&quot; &quot;Ne Tien Fuis Pas,&quot; &quot;Un Baisier  D'Enfant&quot;
(French single), &quot;Under The Ivy,&quot; &quot;Burning Bridge,&quot; &quot;My
Lagan Love,&quot;  &quot;Handsome Cabin Boy,&quot; &quot;Be Kind To My Mistakes,&quot;
&quot;One Last Look Around The  house Before We Go,&quot; &quot;Not This Time,&quot;
&quot;Walk Straight Down The Middle,&quot; &quot;Ken,&quot;  &quot;I'm Still
Waiting,&quot; &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (new vocal from *The Whole Story*),
 &quot;Experiment IV&quot; (12&quot; mix), &quot;Experiment IV&quot; (single
version), &quot;Running Up That  Hill&quot; (12&quot; mix), &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;
(alternative mix), &quot;Cludbusting&quot; (Organon mix),  &quot;The Big Sky&quot;
(meteorological mix) and four songs from the *Onstage* EP: &quot;Them  Heavy
People,&quot; &quot;Don't Push Your Foot,&quot; &quot;L'Amour Looks Something
Like You&quot; and  &quot;James And The Cold Gun.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;If anything's left out, it's either because it doesn't exist anymore
or there were  licensing problems,&quot; Davis says. The eight discs are housed
in a compact box,  complete with a 26-page book of rare photos. Now the bad
news: There are no plans  to make the bonus CDs available individually, and
*This Woman's Work* will sell  for around 80 British pounds--or $150--at the
retail level. But it's not a limited  edition set, and should remain in EMI's
catalog for some time to come.

<P>From: spt1@ukc.ac.uk (Stephen Thomas) <BR> Date: 23 Oct 90 13:30:25 GMT
<BR> Subject: The Boxed Set 
</P>
<P>Well, according to the KBC newsletter, the release date for the Boxed Set
was  22nd October, which as I write was yesterday. Accordingly, today (I was
busy  yesterday) I went down to the shop I had ordered it from (on CD) to see if
it had  arrived. It had. Oh boy. 
</P>
<P>I had expected another UK Love-Hound to have posted something by now, but as
 gaffa is a bit wobbly at the moment, I shall tell you about it anyway. Here is
what I  found. 
</P>
<P>The box is matte black. On the lid are the words &quot;KATE BUSH&quot;
inscribed in  pseudo-gold-leaf, and a label bearing the words &quot;This Woman's
Work -Anthology  1978-1990&quot;. Opening the box reveals a booklet, also called
&quot;This Woman's Work&quot;,  with the female/KT symbol combination we had
been told about. This booklet turns  out *not* to be a biography, as some people
had thought, but rather a short  introduction from Kate (at the beginning), 26
photographs (most of them rather  good), and at the end some credits to the
photographers. Also at the end is the  dedication to Gary Hurst and Alan Murphy.

</P>
<P>Also to be found in the box (apart from the albums themselves) was a set of 
twelve adhesive stickers. Each sticker is the Fm/KT symbol against a plain 
background (sometimes with a border) in various combinations of colours - black,
 gold, red and violet. One sticker for each year, I suppose. Suggestions as to
what I  could use them for are welcome. Maybe I could get them signed at the
Convention. 
</P>
<P>Now, the albums. &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; through to &quot;The Sensual
World&quot; are present  (&quot;The Whole Story&quot; is not present, of
course). There is absolutely nothing special  about these - standard CD cases,
the lyric booklets are the same as usual (well, the  same as the UK albums,
anyway) - there is absolutely nothing to tell them apart  from the albums
available singly.

<P>OK, the bit you have been waiting for - the B-sides and rarities volumes.
These  come on two CDs. The booklets are black with the Fm/KT symbol in red, and
there  are no lyrics. Also, all told, there are only 29 tracks, not the 34
listed in Homeground.  The missing tracks are 
</P>
<P> The Confrontation <BR> The Man With The Child In His Eyes (single mix)
<BR> Dreamtime <BR> Running Up That Hill (instrumental) <BR> The Sensual
World (instrumental) 
</P>
<P>I am slightly disappointed, I suppose, but never mind. I haven't listened to
all the  stuff on the rarities albums, but I suspect I will be well satisfied
with what I have. 
</P>
<P>And that is it. This is what you pay you money for. I must admit that the 
photographs are rather nice. One that caught my eye was a full colour version of
the  cover of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. 
</P>
<P>When other people get their copies, I will be interested to find out what
they  think of it. 
</P>
<P>Keep yourselves well, 
</P>

<P>Date: Sat, 3 Nov 90 02:02 EST <BR> From: PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu
<BR> Subject: HERESY 
</P>
<P> Today I took a drastic step. I went down to the Record Stop in Lake 
Ronkonkoma, who had the box set for the best price that I've seen, $159, and
told  them not to hold one for me. 
</P>
<P>Record Stop is where I forked over $99.95 for the Japanese import video &quot;The
 Single File,&quot; $125 for the original 7&quot; vinyl SF box set (without the
box, but otherwise  complete and virgin), and roughly $120 per album since HOL,
by the time I would  lay in the import singles in 7&quot; and 12&quot; and the
album itself in vinyl and CD. I don't  even want to get started on the imported
songbooks, copies of Kerton and Vermorel,  original editions of Reich's A BOOK
OF DREAMS, and so on. I've been the sort of  fan who has prowled through
libraries to photocopy old reviews, xeroxed  BILLBOARD charts and blurbs from
MELODY MAKER, and subcribed to and  archived this digest. At the party I put on
when TSW was released, a friend  contemplating the 6'X 4' sand-through-hands
poster on my wall said, &quot;I guess you  must be a fan.&quot; &quot;Having one
of these posters doesn't make me a fan,&quot; I answered.  &quot;It's having
TWO.&quot; Just as I have two copies of Jay Bush's CATHY, one that I keep 
unopened in the original mailer. 
</P>
<P>I don't say No! to this new box release because I've ever stinted on my
devotion  to Kate Bush, but because this seems to be a marketing scam unworthy
of her  participation. To me it seems the latest in a culminating series of bad
signs. I'm  gonna be volunteer lightning rod here and utter lots of heresy,
bring down flame  and fire upon my head. But I'm only trying to formulate the
disquiet that I've  heard from many of us in recent months. The love-hounds who
will be seeing her in  London later this month may have opportunity to help get
her back in touch with  her audience and her commitment to her work. 
</P>
<P>* Bad sign: how long it took to get working on TSW. Forget how long we had
to  wait; the questions have to do with how long it took her to get back to her
work,  and whether she really went back to it with full commitment. The is where
the Del  Palmer question Richard Caldwell raised comes in, but it isn't Del in
particular. I'll  come back to this. 
</P>
<P>* Bad sign: for the FIRST TIME in the History of the World, a Kate Bush
album  was accompanied by only THREE videos. It has always been four. 
</P>
<P>* Bad sign: in those videos, Kate spends so much time showing the bottom of
her  chin to the camera it gives you a crick in the neck to watch her. Or she
drapes  herself in upholstery fabric. It isn't vanity, otherwise she wouldn't
include the  interview, which shows us clearly that she isn't a 19 year old
nymph any longer. It's  professional indecision: she doesn't seem to know what
to do with herself. For me,  the redeeming moments come when she's doing what
somebody called the funky  chicken with the band, in &quot;Love and Anger.&quot;
There at least she is a little  unselfconscious, looks like she is having a good
time. 
</P>
<P>* Bad sign (recent evidence perhaps--it can be hoped!--to the contrary): her
 unwillingness to perform live. She seems to think she has to top the Tour of
Life. I  can't tell whether this is timidity, nostalgia, or arrogance. Here she
is with this great  songbook, in a position to put together a killer band, with
world's thirstiest audience  awaiting her! Vickie put her finger on it. She
should either take ten years off and  have a baby, and then see whether she
wants a professional career any more, or she  should get herself into touring
shape and bop around in front of a band for a while. 
</P>
<P>The crassness of the current box release has been well brought out these
past  weeks. Only fans are going to put out $150-200 for a kb collector's
item--but we are  the very ones who likely have the six albums already amd
maybe, like me, all the  relevant singles. I'd buy it in a minute if there were
two songs I hadn't heard. Even  one. A true historical record like Andrew
Marvick outlined would deserve support.  But the only *rational* market for this
release is to be gifts from fans to neophytes.  To me, that feels like I am
being shaken down. It's not a katelike feeling. Have  commercial interests
gotten bigger than her talent? 
</P>
<P>One of the reasons I've loved kb is the sheer craft of her search for and 
achievement of professional power. She had total artistic control over her own 
product before she was 21; it took the Rolling Stones nearly 10 years to get
that far.  She made the commercial aspects of pop music part of a new
'performance art'.  Remember that a Kate Bush album release has never been the
album alone, it has  been a whole Manifestation Event: the first single comes
out in England, then here;  then the album; then Kate's over here, her mug on
MTV; the videos start to arrive,  the 7&quot; and 12&quot; import singles; long
reviews and interviews appear. One could always  feel her presence, her darsan,
behind it all. This was her work: to be impressario of  her own appearance.
Vermorel correctly remarks the hostility of photographers to  her policy of
wanting final review rights over their work before she will grant a  photo
opportunity; anybody ever wonder why kb is never featured in Vogue, 
Mademoiselle, etc.? When she was in New York in November, 1985, BILLBOARD 
reported it in a regular news item, mentioning that she was not only writer, 
arranger, performer, and producer of her music, but was also now her own 
manager. Great, I thought. Kate's peaking. 
</P>
<P>Five years later, I am worried. It has helped me to understand all this to
have  John Carder Bush's CATHY set. Jay is 14 years older than Cathy as they
conspire  together, he to be a photographer, she to be a presence. One can
simply see in these  photographs the birth of what beguiles us in the Kate Bush
they were inventing,  with Paddy as the band: Kate's precocity has always been
met with a total, loving  acceptance, first from her brothers and parents, later
from us as recruits. She  projects this expectation when she performs--which is
why cynical souls are driven  off screaming. The fact that she is also good
makes her cosmic. Every so often  someone professes that Kate Bush is God. A
colleague announced one time in  seminar that that's what I think. I said he was
wrong; she is God's sister. 
</P>
<P>Well sister Kate is older now, and it's less and less appropriate for her to
be  working inside an image she came to with her brothers and Del. The Kate Bush
they  saw in her, and she performed for us forever--in &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;
and the  Hammersmith video from the Tour of Life--had room for three more
albums, but it  ended with &quot;Hounds of Love.&quot; Dead and drowned, that
Kate will forever live again  to tell her mother, tell her father, tell her
brothers how much she loves them. But  she's been milking it since then, first
with &quot;The Whole Story,&quot; which was useful  and deserves its success,
but now in TSW and its uncertain promise. Even those  who like TSW, me among
them, don't claim that it is an artistic breakout. And in  that context, the new
box set release feels like the Heavy Hand. 
</P>
<P>This woman's work: is it over?

<P>Here's where I start to disagree with your conclusions. I don't believe that
there  was ever a plan of this sort. Now that you mention it I wouldn't be
surprised if  Kate's early experience as &quot;the observed&quot; in Jay's
photography helped her to  develop the lack of inhibition that she displays in
her early performances but I don't  think there's any real evidence that Kate's
image was a Bush family conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Well sister Kate is older now, and it's less and less appropriate for
her to be  working inside an image she came to with her brothers and Del. The

drowned, that Kate will forever live again  to tell her mother, tell her father,
tell her brothers how much she loves them. 
</P>
<P>It seems to me that the image of Kate that you're talking about didn't drown
at  the end of The Ninth Wave, it was blown up in a bank robbery, killed with a 
grenade, lost on a secret mission, drown in a straight-jacket and finally thrown
out of  the house in The Dreaming. 
</P>
<P>There seem to be different forces at work here. First of all, at some point
Kate  seems to have discovered all those inhibitions and insecurities about her
work and  herself that she escaped so easily early in her career. At the same
time she moved in  the direction of more and more dense music. 
</P>
<P>At some point after Hounds of Love it seems as though the density of Kate's 
work reached critical mass. At some point while trying to realize her vision of
the  music that was to become The Sensual World I have to wonder if maybe it
didn't  become more of a labor than a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>None of this means that Kate is finished, she just needs a slightly
different  direction. The recent HMV/Q interview gives reason to hope that the
boxed set has  provided her with the perspective to find that direction.

Wed, 21 Nov 90 15:20:44 GMT <BR> Subject: Review Box Set
</P>
<P>What follows is the review of the box set by Glynn Brown in Select Magazine:
 Any factual errors have been left in ie The Kick Inside ('77) 
</P>
<P> SENSES WORKING OVERTIME 
</P>
<P>With this oceanic outpouring, which constitutes Kate Bush's every artistic 
thought and feeling for the best part of eleven years, the woman is effectively
pinned  for inspection. 'This Woman's Work' consists of nine LPs(or eight
cassettes, or  eight CDs), including extra, previously non-album material. It's
interesting to  speculate on whose idea this torrential retrospective-theres
also a full-colour booklet  with rare photographs-was. Because an undeniably
lucrative part of the Bush  business is her mystery. For many admirers, the
essence of Bush is that, with little  known about her personal life, she can be
interpreted as you wish. It's obvious  she's clever, funny, philosophical,
sentimental and sensual, but what else?The idea is  that by delving into
obscurities and B-sides, fans might just gain the clue to Kate's  within. 
</P>
<P>It is a formidable assembley. First the six sumptuous albums, from 'The Kick
 Inside'('77) to 'The Sensual World'('89), showing the development of a
precociou s  talent that EMI were wise enough not to force or harry, allowing
Bush to blossom  slowly. There follows a riot of of rarer stuff, nothing
particularly unobtainable, but  items which may have been hard to track down. 
</P>
<P>Occasionally-'Passing Through Air', B-side of 'Army Dreamers', or 'Warm  And
Sooth ing', flip of 'December Will Be Magic Again'-the tracks are thin and 
whimsical, but on the whole it's remarkable how consistently worthwhile, 
risk-taking and energetic this music is. Even the fillers-the 'Organon Mix' of 
'Cloudbusting', the 'Meteorological Mix' of 'Big Sky'-round out the feel, while 
rarer tracks, like the French single 'Un Baiser D'Enfant', the magnificently
lush  'Ken' from the Comic Strip film GLC and the onstage EPs, illuminate
further  depths to the Bush persona But the real jewels are the unexpected
treasures that  glitter in the grass. Adole scent, helplessly sexual, 'Lord Of
The Reedy River' has  Kate languorously in love with a swan. There's nothing to
the melody and the  backing is a symphony of dripping water and the aching creak
of rowlocks as the  singer, a Lady of Shalott adrift on the lake, pursues her
vain love;yet this sparse  suggestion is the essence of it all. 
</P>
<P>Wild, temperamental, endearingly aware of and in love with her own media 
image, a true child-woman in her blend of emotional maturity and sparky
naivety.. .  Reassuringly, we still know as much-and as little-about Kate Bush
as we ever did. 
</P>
<P>Rating: 4 out of a possible 5

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: reviews of the box set 
</P>
<P>Selected quotes from some reviews of the box set (all favorable, by the
way): 
</P>
<P>From the same issue of Q : 
</P>
<P>&quot;'Be kind to my mistakes' she says in the accompanying 26-page book of
colour  portraits, 'because I'm not'. There really isn't any need.&quot; 
</P>
<P>From the Nov. 10 issue of New Musical Express : 
</P>
<P>&quot;She arrived with one of the most extraordinary debut singles ever.. .&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;But several things distinguish her from her male counterparts; her
vast reservoir  of talent for one, and the strangeness and magic of her best
work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;If you don't know Kate Bush, immerse yourself in this terrific set. If
you do  here's your chance to replace all those scratched and tear-stained
mementoes at a  stroke.&quot; 
</P>
<P>From the Oct. 27 issue of Melody Maker : 
</P>
<P>&quot;Anybody who has been concerned and involved with pop in its purest
sense over  the last 15 years will have favourite Bushy moments. . .&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Then there's the preposterously good records.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So Kate free-falls through 'The Kick Inside'. 'Lionheart', 'Never For
Ever',  'The Dreaming', 'Hounds Of Love', and 'The Sensual World', while the
listener  crawls along these womb-like air-ducts with a mixture of fascination,
awe, suspense,  trauma and profound irritation. That's more than we expect from
pop music and  it's more than we deserve. Nice, fantastic, amazing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Here's a real strange line: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The elegiac 'Night Of The Swallow' appears to be a comment on the
sense of  humour in the female genitals. Nice one Kate!&quot; In fact, this guy
seems to have very  strange ideas about several of Kate's songs.

(Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago) <BR> Subject: Kate and EMI 
</P>
<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P>Those who are concerned can rest easy that someone close to Kate is aware
that  not everyone is happy with the Box Set, though I'm afraid I may have made
a bit of  an ass of myself in the process. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>This brought about the question of who controlled the box set, Kate or EMI.
She  said EMI, and I pointed out that EMI said the final decision had been
Kate's. She  didn't reply to that and I said that Andy and Derek had put
together a very good set  that had been rejected. (I later found out that
Homeground had put together a set as  well, and EMI had gone as far as making up
test cassettes of their arrangement) 
</P>
<P>I believe I may have gotten a little frantic in telling her that the Box Set
was a  &quot;God-Damn rip-off&quot;. Well, it was a very emotional day. 
</P>
<P>I'm in the process of writing a nice little note of apology, as was
suggested by  David Cross. Our feelings are not stopping us from buying two box
sets, though. The  Club newsletter was an enormous rip-off for American fans for
a number of years  (one year passed without a single newsletter). In self
defense I should point out that  Kate's family and friends do a pretty good job
of insulating her from the outside  world, and it's quite possible that she is
not aware that anyone feels this way. 
</P>
<P> Two theories about why the box set exists: 
</P>
<P>1: Kate wanted a nice box to take out to the back yard and bury to put a
period  on this part of her career. 
</P>
<P>2: Kate wanted something nice to give as Christmas presents. (we understand
that  Kate bought 50 LP and 50 CD sets.)

the  Roy Harper duet with Peter Gabriel was not included on the boxset was just

<P>A big THANK YOU to all who sent me info about the CD box prices. It has been
 quite illuminating. It looks like Canada, Germany, New Zealand and Australia
(if you  can find it) are the cheapest places for the set. Unfortunately I only
have one data  point for all but Canada out of these, so sampling error may give
the impression it is  overly cheap there. 
</P>
<P>Below the results is a draft letter I propose to send to Mr. Steve Davis,
Product  Manager at EMI London. I am sure all of you will not agree with what I
have said. If  you have any suggestions to make, please email me. The letter
will not be mailed  until after New Year as I will be away for a week from
Thursday and I have too  much to do before then. It will also give some of you
time to respond.

September 4th. I realise now that it was far too late for further input into the
 project. Unfortunately, we did not hear about the release until it was clearly
too late.  The purpose of this letter is to bring to your attention the
reception of the Kate  Bush Box Set by fans around the world and certain aspects
of its marketing. 
</P>
<P>First, I believe all fans are pleased that her b-sides have been
consolidated and  are available on compact disc, vinyl and cassette as a
legitimate release. The set has  been hard to get in some parts of the world
including some areas of the USA and in  Australia where there are apparently
strict quotas for its distribution. Hopefully all  those that want the set will
be able to get it. 
</P>
<P>Apart from availability, there are other complaints that some of us have
about the  set. One that has surfaced is the disparate prices the CD sets are
being sold for  around the world. I instigated a survey on the Love-hounds
computer network  newsgroup to get prices which were being asked by stores
across the globe. The  responses reveal that the set is far cheaper in certain
countries than in others. More  specifically, it seems that in the UK and USA
(Kate's larger markets I would  assume) one can find some of the highest prices
in the world. Below are the  summarized results of my survey. All prices include
local sales taxes which are  between 6 and 20%. The results of the full survay
from which this was derived are  appended to this letter. 
</P>
<P>Country	cost in US $ <BR> Australia	$138 <BR> Canada	$73-$113 <BR>
Finland	$252 <BR> France	$129-$276 <BR> Germany	$135 <BR> Netherlands	$193
<BR> New Zealand	$89 <BR> Norway	$170-$204 <BR> Sweden	$205 <BR>
UK	$184-$190 <BR> USA	$165-$238 
</P>
<P>What is most perturbing is that the exact same sets (EMI UK produced) are 
being sold for so little in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and Australia, yet, for
so  much in the UK and other European countries where shipping costs will be
much  less. I believe the sets in Canada are being distributed through your
Canadian  subsidiary. Why are they being sold so cheaply there? UK, other
European  customers, and some in the USA in particular are clearly being gouged.
The price in  the UK is uniformly set at between #94.99 and #97.99 so fans have
little choice as to  what they pay. In France the range of prices is
preposterous. 
</P>
<P>A similar situation exists in the USA. The cost to US dealers is
approximately $125  (#64) meaning profit margins for the sellers are sometimes
close to 100%. I realise  this is largely a function of the market place. I
personally believe that the music  industry has been exploiting CD customers in
the UK with higher than necessary  prices : the Kate Bush Boxed Set continues
this practice. I have seen UK  manufactured discs sell for under $12 in the USA
at full retail price whereas in the  UK they sell for #12. The difference is
clearly not related to production or shipping  costs. The only justification for
such prices is because it is what the market will bare.  I personally believe
consumers deserve more respect. 
</P>
<P>Another gripe is the fact that many of the discs in the set can be purchased
 separately at mid-price (#8) in the UK yet the set sells for approximately #12
per  disc. Normally, boxed sets sell for less than what separately purchased
discs cost so  as to act as an incentive to purchase a multiple-disc set. This
did not occur for &quot;This  Woman's Work&quot;. It is felt the extra costs for
the new discs do not justify this price  hike. Can you explain why this is
possibly the most expensive set, on a per disc basis,  to have ever been
released? 
</P>
<P>	 In paying such a premium for the set most found the disc booklets fell far
short  of what they should have been. There were no lyrics for the new to CD
songs and no  source information. The photographs have been commended but for CD
purchasers  the small size was disappointing in comparison to the LP pictures
which are  apparently quite stunning. CD purchasers again feel short changed. CD
box sets are  often released in LP sized boxes with full-size booklets. As a
result it is felt an  opportunity was missed. And despite Kate having a large
say in the project, as she  usually does with her work, I believe EMI had the
ultimate control of the packaging.  Needless to say most fans are unimpressed
with the minimal effort put into the  booklets. 
</P>
<P>As Andy and I stated in our letter of September 4th there were concerns from
 fans who already owned all of Kate's albums on CD, with many having specially 
purchased the UK discs. The duplicate purchase of these discs was a sickening 
prospect. We advised that to make the album discs in the set special, i.e. with
bonus  tracks or special edition booklets, would ease some of the concerns.
Unfortunately  EMI's minimum effort approach has left many fans upset. Instead
of making the  fans happy, EMI has embittered them. It is felt that EMI are to
be blamed for a  complete lack of consideration for her most loyal followers:
the majority of whom  already had all her albums on CD. 
</P>
<P>Lastly there have been rumours about a separate release in the USA of the 
b-sides discs (source: Tower Records magazine). Some who cannot afford the full 
boxed sets are hopeful. Others who purchased the boxed sets, including many who 
already had all her albums on CD, are quite angry about this. If this was
planned  before the release of the boxed set many fans will be simply outraged.
Could you  confirm that EMI have no plans to issue a separate 2 disc release of
the b-sides discs  in the USA or UK? 
</P>
<P>In the future it would be worthwhile for EMI to somehow get the opinions of 
potential customers before releasing large boxed sets. I understand that the
staff at  Homeground (the UK's only official Kate Bush Fanzine) were shut out of
the project  completely. This would have been the most obvious place to have
obtained some fan  and consumer input. 
</P>
<P>To conclude I will summarise by saying that the &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;
CD set  has had a mixed response from the fans. From a musical standpoint it is
wonderful  despite some b-sides being omitted. However, most fans are not
completely happy  with it. There have been many frustrations: the difficulty of
obtaining the sets in  some areas; the variability in price; the minimal
packaging and information  contained, the complete duplication and redundant
purchase of the album CDs; the  perceived lack of respect for the loyal fans,
and, the often excessively high cost. I  realise that EMI are not a charity but
a little more respect for the wishes of the fans  - the chief buyers - would go
a long way. Fortunately for EMI, Kate's fans are a loyal  bunch, but with the &quot;This
Woman's Work&quot; CD set you have all but destroyed any  respect fans may have
had for EMI. 
</P>
<P>I and many other fans look forward to your response to my questions. 
</P>
<P>Sincerely yours <BR> Derek Langsford

<BR> Subject: Homeground 40 
</P>
<P>The new Homeground, no. 40, popped through my door this morning. It contains
 some interesting stuff. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>They also cover the mixed reception given to the boxed set, printing some of
the  good reviews and some of the fan's grumblings. They attempt to set the
record  straight by giving the history of the set. It seems that originally EMI,
at  Homeground's request, had wanted to collect all the B-sides and rarities
(only) onto  one volume, although they were unsure of the format. This project
was shelved  when TSW was released, but revived to cover the interregnum between
TSW and  KBVII, projected for third quarter '91. 
</P>
<P>Kate had a different idea though. She saw here career as entering a totally
new  phase, and wanted to round off her previous work more completely. Hence the
 complete boxed set. 
</P>
<P>Homeground do reckon that the pricing is somewhat iffy, however. The fact
that  it is being sold, by retailers, as 8 full price albums, when 4 of these
albums are  available at mid-price (in the UK, at least) cannot be justified.
Apparently, EMI's  response to this is &quot;It's a fair cop&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The set is *not* a limited edition, and there were some 30000 units in the
first  run, with more if demand is high enough.

(Derek Langsford) <BR> Subject: Letter to EMI: second draft 
</P>
<P>Fellow Love-hounds, 
</P>
<P>After having several comments (most in support) I have made a few changes to
 the letter which I propose to send to Steve Davis at EMI. Thank you all who
sent me  comments The major change comes at the end - I had an idea. 
</P>
<P>In Homeground, EMI admitted it was a &quot;fair cop&quot; about the high
prices for mostly  mid-price album discs. Well, I wondered how they could make
it up to us CD set  purchasers. What if they sent us a copy of the LP photo
booklet free of charge in  return for proof of purchase or the stickers which
came with the set. The stickers  could be returned or a new set included with
the booklet. The cost to EMI would be  a few pounds each - an appropriate amount
methinks as compensation for being  overcharged. 
</P>
<P>I would really like your comments on this proposal. I do not expect them to
take  me up on it. But, there's no harm in trying. 
</P>
<P>&quot; One way to offset these criticisms and redeem EMI in our eyes would
be to  make the LP booklet available to purchasers of the CD boxed set at no
charge. The  stickers that came with the set (or a receipt) could be sent as
proof of purchase and  returned with the booklet or a new set included. 
</P>
<P>I and many other fans look forward to your response.&quot;

Subject: Japanese boxed set: The Whole Story 
</P>
<P>Hi Lionhearts, 
</P>
<P>I finally got the Japanese boxed set this afternoon from fellow Katefan and
fairly  fair dealer Tom Richards at C-Side Records (P.O.Box 8456 Clearwater,FL.
34618  USA-get on his extensive KTlist), and all I can say is: 
</P>
<P>BOYCOTT THE ENGLISH BOX! PAY THE EXTRA COST FOR THE  JAPANESE BOX-IT IS
CERTAINLY WORTH IT! 
</P>
<P>John Relph asked: &gt;..is there a difference..? 
</P>
<P>Oh, my Kate, is there ever! For openers, the &quot;rarities&quot; disk
booklets CONTAIN  ALL THE LYRICS TO THE SONGS ON THE DISKS! You read that right!
Well,  how could you miss it since it was in all caps? :-) Not counting the
insides of the  front and back covers, the booklet for Vol. 1 is contains 16
pages; Vol. 2 has 12. I can't  compare these to the UK box since I have not
purchased it (although I did get the  album boxed set in England during Kon week
(sigh..). I have seen Ed's set, but I  don't remember how the rarities booklets
looked. 
</P>
<P>Before getting into the individual releases, I'll try to describe EMI
Japan's  presentation, which in a nutshell, makes the UK box pale in comparison.
Yes, you've  got the strip on top of the lid as Japanese releases do, but one
thing I found  interesting is another strip pasted on the lower part of the box.
It has the UPC strip,  but among the Kanji is the number 16000, which also
appears on the top strip. But in  parentheses after it (on my box) is the number
15,534. This makes me wonder if at  least the initial boxing was limited to
16,000 for the Japanese boxed set. If anyone  else buys this, please post the
number on your box to Love-Hounds. 
</P>
<P>Each CD in the box is a white plastic base compared to the typical black
jewel  boxes on other CDs. On the upper left hand corner of the back of each CD
are the  words KATE BUSH BOX 1 (through 7). As previously reported here and
elsewhere,  the The Kick Inside and Never For Ever CDs have different covers
than the UK box.  TKI is the &quot;pink top&quot; picture, and NFE has an
interesting cover-it is a blowup of  part of the cover art which appears on
other releases. If you look at your cover, it is  the area approximately from
the whale's snout going right, including the white bird,  the swan, and some of
those weird-looking characters riding or hanging around  them. You don't see the
drawing of Kate with her dress blowing up at all in the  blowup, nor the title
of the album below Kate's feet. But when you open the first  page of the
booklet, you see the normal cover! REally cool. 
</P>
<P>Oh, another thing about all the CDs-each one shares the same design. What I 
mean is that each of the CDs themselves is black, with kind of a goldish colour 
lettering, somewhat similiar to the colour of the The Sensual World CD, though
not  as nice a gold, IMHO. The CDs are manufactured by TOSHIBA-EMI LTD., and the
 matrix numbers run from TOCP-6460 through TOCP-6467. I had read some 
allegations that EMI UK was using their box to rid excess KTstock, and I
wouldn't  doubt it, but it appears that EMI JAP hasn't done this. 
</P>
<P>The Japanese box contains two booklets (no sticers, alas. Wonder why? Maybe 
they thought it was a teensy bit dumb, but that's only one man's opinion ;-).
One  booklet has the nice small pictures; I suspect it is no different from the
UK booklet,  but I'd like to put them side-by-side for a clarity comparison. The
other booklet  looks special. It has the design that the sticker on the lid has,
with the border. It has  28 pages, and is presented in a 2-column format, all in
Kanji. The title of the  document is: 
</P>
<P>THIS WOMAN'S WORK 1958-1990 
</P>
<P>----The Biographical Notes Of Kate Bush----
</P>
<P>It starts out with 1958, and appears to be a chronological biography of
Kate.  Entries are dated for reference, and a bibliography at the end includes
18 sources,  including NME 1978-1990, Homeground #22-#39, The Amazing Pudding
#39, the  Vermorel, Cann, and Mayes books, even the bootleg discography Hot
Wacks XIV  1990?! The compilation is credited to one Hideyo Itoh (copyright
September 1990). 
</P>
<P>Now on to the albums. Pardon me if I wander or digress-I'm using a straight
line  editor and can't go back all that easily. I'll describe them, plus compare
them to the  CDs of the same albums that I already own: 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside : Booklet is 16 pages. Times of the songs are listed on page
1,  unlike the UK C with only the titles listed. After this is a 4-page article
presumably  about Kate, dated Feb. 1978. Then the lyrics in English and
Japanese. The back cover  of the booklet has the drawing of the kite. Song
titles on the back include a type on  &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; The spelled
it &quot;Wethering Heights.&quot; (hee hee). I can't  compare it to my UK CD,
since it is currently out on loan (yes, I'm hooking yet  another one). On the
spine is written THE KICK INSIDE/KATE BUSH - unlike the  UK CD which I remember
says only KICK INSIDE. 
</P>
<P>Lionheart : Yes, the wonderful Lionheart, a beautiful album. Times of songs
listed  on page 1. Then, another article, this one is 3 pages long, with no date
listed. The  lyrics are next, both in English and Japanese. I don't have my UK
Lionheart to  compare. It too is on loan to the same guy. Has he got a treat in
store when he feasts  his ears on the fantastic, horribly maligned and
misunderstood incredible effort  which is the historic Lionheart album. Kate
only said some lies about it being less  than perfeKT because she was influenced
by stupid reviewers and people who are  easily influenced by what they read. 
</P>
<P>Never For Ever : Booklet is 16 pages. Lyrics are first presented in English.
Note  that the page that has the lyrics to &quot;Violin&quot; and &quot;The
Infant Kiss&quot; is the page which  is used as the back picture for the UK CD,
with Kate flying around. Neat. After this  is a 2-page article dated Dec. 1986.
Then the lyrics in Japanese. I just noticed  something. On page four of the UK
CD booklet is the same blow-up picture that is  used as the cover for the
Japanese boxed set CD! Only not nearly as sharp. The UK  CD booklet has 10
pages. 
</P>
<P>The Dreaming : Compared to my EMI AMERICA (hoot-snicker) CD, which has  10
pages, the EMI JAPAN booklet has 20. The clarity of the pictures makes me want 
to throw the American booklet away (just kidding-but i think I would if it
wasn't a  Kate CD). Page one: times listed of course, not on the American CD (of
course). The  only thing the American CD has that the Japanese CD doesn't is the
blowup of the  cover picture on page 6 (just Kate's face with the key in the
mouth is all you see).  That's interesting. I'd bet that this was simply an
oversight. After the lyrics in the  Japanese booklet is another 4-page article.
After the article is a discography of  Kate's singles, EP, and albums up to The
Whole Story, with dates of release. The  article is dated Dec. 1986. 
</P>
<P>Hounds Of Love : I'm comparing the Japanese boxed set CD, the EMI AMERICA 
CD (hoot-holler-snicker), and the UK CD, which was printed in Holland and which 
has a CD inside which was made in Japan. Oh yeah-it was purchased in 
Germany-maybe that's why it was printed in Holland, I don't know. Anyway, the 
EMI AMERICA booklet is 7 pages long and simply a fright to behold. So I'll put
it  away, for what it's worth. UK CD booklet has 10 pages, and the Japanese
booklet is  20 pages long. After the English lyrics is a 4-page article which
looks like an  interview, but not with Kate (but I could be wrong, of course).
After that you get a  BLACK AND WHITE copy of the picture that is included in
the LP record release  of HOL, with Kate and the hounds, but Kate has her eyes
closed. In the LP album,  the picture is in colour. Neither the American nor UK
CDs have this picture, in  colour or black and white. So that's something extra.

</P>
<P>The Sensual World : Interesting stuff here. I'm comparing it to a UK CD made
in  Austria which was also purchased in Germany. The UK CD booklet has but 5
pages;  the Japanese booklet has 16 (actually 17, since I'm counting the inside
back covers  this time). The layout is quite different, for instance: Page 1 of
the Japanese booklet  has song times, the other doesn't even list the titles,
much less the times. The layout  of the Japanese booklet is better. One thing
that surprised me was in the lyrics to  &quot;WSDTM.&quot; In the UK booklet,
you can plainly make out the fuzzy, lightening-bolt  line and curved line which
follow the note symbols, all in quotes, in the last three  lines of the song. In
both the American booklet (which I don't own, but have seen),  AND the Japanese
booklet, these characters are not visible. 
</P>
<P>Ha ha, I know some of you must be thinking &quot;Jesus, why go to such
detail in  describing the differences?&quot; Well, it's terribly interesting to
me, obviously. And of  course it is related to Kate, so it's terribly important.
Anyway, onward. After the  English lyrics (in the Japanese booklet I talking
about again) come the credits. The  layout is the same except for one thing: At
the very end where Kate says Thank You!  KATE BUSH (London 1989) in the UK CD
booklet, the exclamation point DOES  NOT APPEAR after the word You in the
Japanese booklet! Now THAT is  interesting! :-) Does the exclamation point
appear in the American CD booklet,  anyone? Knowing Kate as I do, I'd guess that
she used the exclamation point in the  original submitted draft. 
</P>
<P>After this remarkable omission are not one, but TWO articles! One is 1 page
long  written by one Mayumi Chiwaki on 30th Aug.'89. At the end of this article
in  English in ALL CAPS are the words: TAKE A DEEP BREATH! Boy, can't wait to 
get that one translated. The second article is 3 pages lg. It was written by one
 Michinari Yamada on Sep 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>She really IS!

<BR> Subject: from Little Light 
</P>
<P> The following appears in Little Light, Summer 1991, published by The

<P>REVIEWS 
</P>
<P>THE JAPANESE BOXED SET: THIS WOMAN'S WORK 
</P>
<P>The Japanese release of this boxed set is very similar to the British
release. I will  merely note the major differences: 
</P>
<P> 1) There are two booklets in this set- the booklet included in the British
release  (though stapled in a slightly different order), and a second, thicker
booklet that  includes what is apparently a timeline. 
</P>
<P>2) The Kick Inside features the Japanese (pink top) cover. 
</P>
<P>3) Never For Ever's cover is a blowup of the American and British cover; but
the  regular cover, complete with titles, is featured as page 3. 
</P>
<P>4) All the discs are painted black, but feature an identical musical
product. 
</P>
<P>5) Jewel-case end cards are in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>6) The Hounds Of Love front cover is tinted very red, and the liner notes
feature  an additional photo not included in the British edition. 
</P>
<P>7) This Woman's Work I and II feature lyrics in both English and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>8) Each of the six albums have extensive notes in the liner, in Japanese. I 
recommend it, but not to the exclusion of the British edition or vice-versa.

<P>I got the Box Set Biographical Notes from David Koehler. (Thanks David!)
When  I first looked at it, I thought it was identical to the &quot;Chronology&quot;
from Kate Bush  Complete. However, a quick comparison reveals that while many
entries are almost  exactly the same, each work contains info that the other one
doesn't. So I guess I  *DO* have to translate the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>Before I saw it, I was hoping it won't be written in long complicated
proses. Was  I relieved to see that it's in point form! However, the
transliteration of English  proper names into Japanese is really giving me a
hard time. Luckily a lot of the info  is already in KB Complete. Otherwise, I'd
never have known that  &quot;BAKKUSUREEHEESU&quot; is Bexleyheath! 
</P>
<P>I'm going on vacation for 3 weeks staring Jan 27 (back to Hong Kong for
Chinese  New Year; Kung Hay Fat Choy!*) I'll do the bulk of the translation
then. Meanwhile,  here are the first few entries to whet your appetite. 
</P>
<P>The [?] marks mean I'm unsure about those re-transliterations.

Subject: TWW H E L P ! Conclusion Pt 1 
</P>
<P>Thanks to everyone -- 8 of you, in fact(!) -- who responded to my 8/21 query
 about TWW box sets: 
</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;What are the primary differences between the UK, Japanese, and
Canadian  TWW Box sets? I've found the Canadian for $119, which seems like a
good deal. But  if I'm losing out in packaging or (especially) in terms of sound
quality, it's not  worth saving a few bucks.&gt;&gt; 
</P>
<P>I can now offer something back... 
</P>
<P>I recently A/B'd The Man With The Child In His Eyes and Wuthering Heights 
(2 tracks chosen for differences in style i.e. ballad and a mid-tempo one, but
also for  the familiarity of the material) taken from the following sources, on
mid-level  audiophile equipment: 
</P>
<P>-- Japanese TKI CD (recent) 
</P>
<P>-- UK/W German TKI CD (issued ~1984)
</P>
<P>-- UK The Whole Story CD (&quot;Man&quot; only, since &quot;Heights&quot;
has different vocals)  (~1987) 
</P>
<P>-- Japanese TKI LP (early '80s) 
</P>
<P>Results... 
</P>
<P>Surprisingly, the LP was a disappointment. Usually, Japanese pressings on
vinyl  are outstanding, but when A/B'd to any of the CDs, this one was lacking
(despite  the drop-dead gorgeous jacket &lt;g&gt;). I listened carefully to some
LPs I've always used  as reference standards afterward to make sure there wasn't
something wrong with  my record playing system. But there wasn't! 
</P>
<P>The UK TKI CD was good. Fairly clean, good definition, acceptable
soundstage,  but with a noticable digital sheen i.e. lack of depth and mild
harshness all over the  place. The UK TWS (from a few years later) was smoother
and seemed a bit quieter  as well, but was generally in TKI's league. Both were
relatively weak on the low  end. 
</P>
<P>The Japanese TKI was a revelation. Dead quiet, crystal clear, with a solid
bottom.  Kate's vocals also sounded more &quot;there&quot; on this disc. It was
simply fun to listen to,  for the beauty of the sound as well as the quality of
the music. 
</P>
<P>Qualifiers: 1) As it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to figure out,
I'm  somewhat obsessive (i.e. something of a lunatic) about audiophile sound
quality --  others may not be; and 2) My hearing may be a bit better than some
-- it was tested  a couple of years ago and it's nearly in the hypersensitive
range. IOW, most people  probably would be quite happy with the UK discs. The
only time I directly compared  a US KateCD to its UK equivalent was several
years ago, auditioning both editions of  TWS. Needless to say, the UK won hands
down. It wasn't even close. 
</P>
<P>But for me, the decision's made. The Japanese TWW it is. I've found it for
$148  new. 
</P>
<P>Thanks again for all your help. Hope my experiment (however modest if not 
borderline insane &lt;g&gt;) serves to inform any future TWW buyers who may be
lurking  out there. 
</P>
<P>-- David Reff :)
