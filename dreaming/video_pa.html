    <P>There is going to be another Kate Bush Convention in England this year.
      It will be on November 9th, and this one is going to be much more informal
      than the previous ones. A video dance club is being rented, and for six
      hours all the screens are going to be showing all sorts of Kate Bush
      related video. Kate's band and family will be there and people will be
      encouraged to just wander around and talk to everyone else. Kate will
      almost definitely be there, and this time, the folks at *Homeground* hope
      to convince Kate to come at the beginning and just mingle with everyone
      for the six hours. Tickets will be sold by mail in the next issue of
      *Homeground* and through the Kate Bush Club. </P>
    
    <P>I'm not sure if I can picture Kate just mingling with 400 rabid fans...
      But people tend to be much politer in England... </P>

    <P>Kate did show up for the KB video party in London, after all. She stayed
      for an hour an a half or so, talking to people and signing stuff. There
      are no con T-shirts left over; someone swiped the remaining shirts. </P>
