      <BR> Subject: Warning -- outrageous, possibly offensive song title! </P>
    
    <P>I hope nobody flames me for this -- I'm only the messenger! </P>
    
    <P>The cover story of the February issue of CD Review is &quot;The Joy of
      Sex in Music.&quot; Here's one paragraph: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;[A particular song] is silly enough to fool parents and get on the
      radio. But sneak a listen to [list of songs] and you'll hear just how far
      sexual boundaries are being pushed.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>One of the songs in that list is -- ready world? -- </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kate's Bush&quot; by Marc Anthony Thompson. </P>
    
    <P>Well, I had to find out what this was all about, just for the record. So
      I found a copy of his album at Tower. The album is called Watts and Paris.
      I expected the song to be hardcore punk, but it isn't at all! The melody
      is that of an ordinary light rock song, with jazz touches. The lyrics are
      very erotic, but only somewhat sexually explicit. There's no mention of
      Kate at all. Actually, a lot of the lyrics are very strange. This is by no
      means a great song, but it's not the horrible thing I was expecting. </P>
    
    <P>Here are the lyrics. You have been warned above. </P>
    
    <P>I once new a virgin that I met at the airport
      <BR> She was dirty, I was seventeen
      <BR> Her feet were bare, her lips were chapped
      <BR> I don't remember why
      <BR> She had the biggest dad I'd ever seen
      <BR> Beyond the dreams of avarice
      <BR> The body finds a home
      <BR> I kiss her and I lick her
      <BR> And I put it in the wrong hole
      <BR> A million apparitions shake a finger in the breeze
      <BR> The house is made of money
      <BR> I once knew a junkie who would drop for a dollar
      <BR> She had the sweetest ass I've ever seen
      <BR> If you've got a nickel I've got one
      <BR> And we can call her
      <BR> You can wake her up, she never dreams
      <BR> Beyond the dreams of avarice
      <BR> The body finds a home
      <BR> I kick it and I lick it
      <BR> And I put it in the wrong hole
      <BR> Beyond the dreams of avarice
      <BR> I whisper it alone
      <BR> I kiss her and I lick her
      <BR> And I put it in the wrong hole
      <BR> The house is made of money </P>
    
    <P>Sorry about that, folks! </P>

    <P>A friend recently lent me a CD with a track on it called &quot;Kate&quot;.
      It is explained in the (all-too-brief) liner notes as &quot;variations on

      but was unable to place the theme by Kate. Nice music, though. </P>
    
    <P>The CD is by Sonny Shirrock. It was released in 1990 (I think). I can't
      remember the title of the album, but if anybody really wants to know, I

    <P>The theme is from &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Listen to the chord

      theme is used at the end of &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot;
      slightly...um...faster? fuller? Different, in any event. This is the theme
      that is adopted in &quot;Kate&quot; and is quite clear near the end of the
      track. </P>

    </P>
    
    <P>Actually, the man's name is Sonny Sharrock, and the album is Highlife.
      I've only found the CD for sale once, and it was quite expensive. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Anybody else heard this track? Did you recognize the Kate theme?
    </P>
    
    <P>A surprising number have heard this track now, thanks to woj, who
      included it on the &quot;Happy Gift Project,&quot; a compilation tape that
      the Ecto mailing list made as a holiday present for Happy Rhodes. Also
      included on that compilation (immediately following &quot;Kate&quot;) is
      an a capella version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by a vocal group.
      The &quot;theme&quot; is quite clear in that version as well, due to the
      fact that near the end of the song, it is picked up by the majority of the
      singers. Cool stuff. </P>

    <P>The UK TV special I mentioned a few weeks ago is to be shown on ITV on
      Wednesday at 20:00 to 22:00 (In the STV and Grampian regions anyway). It's
      called &quot;The Last Show on Earth&quot;, it's about endangered species,
      and it features &quot;music by Michael Kamen, Elton John, Kate Bush, Seal,
      Beverley Craven, Julian Lennon and Peter Gabriel&quot; and &quot;interviews
      with Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley&quot; (quotes from today's Daily
      Express). CK's Pop Forum (where I read about this first) describes the
      music as &quot;commissioned&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Sounds good.... </P>

      <BR> Subject: The Last Show On Earth (again) </P>
    
    <P>If anybody's wondering what KaTe's involvement was, they used the
      beginning of &quot;Hello Earth&quot; during the title sequence (shots of
      Earth from space and speeded-up aerial views of mountains and lakes
      zooming past), and the the end of the same track later in the program.
      Since the musical director for the show was Michael Kamen, this was only
      to be expected 8^). </P>
    
    <P>Btw, I've read it's to be shown in 130 different countries, so
      presumably the USA will be one of them! It's also a very disturbing
      account of what's happening to the environment. Recommmended. </P>

      <BR> Subject: A Song About KaTe </P>
    
    <P>On the album &quot;Nothing Is Written&quot; (Avalon Records, GHCD 3
      [1991]) by the UK neo-progressive band Galahad, there is a song entitled &quot;Evaporation&quot;
      which I have long suspected is about KaTe. I finally got a chance to speak
      to Stu Nicholson, Galahad's lead singer and lyricist, yesterday and he was
      happy to confirm this. </P>
    
    <P>Here is the lyric in question: </P>
    
    <P>Evaporation </P>
    
    <P>by S. Nicholson </P>
    
    <P>The last time that I saw you was on stage in a video
      <BR> Alive and high kicking at Hammersmith O... so good
      <BR> So good </P>
    
    <P>I can close my eyes and picture movement so serene
      <BR> Beauty in full motion a true whimsical princess...
      <BR> Oh yes.. </P>
    
    <P>So good, so sensual
      <BR> So good, so sensual, sensual, sensual... </P>
    
    <P>Evaporation, evaporation, where did you go to?
      <BR> Where did you go?
      <BR> Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
      <BR> So much </P>
    
    <P>Although a decade has passed I still think of you
      <BR> It only seems like yesterday </P>
    
    <P>I know you are no child but I can feel your innocence
      <BR> When I visualise, in my mind, in my head, ooh yes!
      <BR> I doubt if you'll ever know me
      <BR> But it would warm so much if you did, oh if you did </P>
    
    <P>You take all my breath away and send my pulse racing
      <BR> Into overdrive, you do... without fail </P>
    
    <P>So good, so sensual
      <BR> So good, so sensual, sensual... </P>
    
    <P>Evaporation, evaporation, where did you go to?
      <BR> Where did you go?
      <BR> Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
      <BR> So much </P>
    
    <P>Not so much as a whisper you further the enigma
      <BR> Although it seems like yesterday </P>
    
    <P>If only I could talk to you
      <BR> If only I could meet you
      <BR> If only we could harmonise together
      <BR> If only I could sing with you
      <BR> If only I could breathe you
      <BR> Maybe we could harmonise together! </P>
    
    <P>Evaporation, evaporation, where did you go to?
      <BR> Where did you go?
      <BR> Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
      <BR> So much
      <BR> Evaporation, evaporation, it's good to see you back again
      <BR> in the fold
      <BR> Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
      <BR> So much </P>
    
    <P>Don't stay away too long
      <BR> Don't evaporate
      <BR> Don't evaporate... </P>
    
    <P>Before rabid philocanines rush out to try to obtain a copy of this, a
      couple of words of warning: </P>
    
    <P>1. The CD is only domestically available in the UK and Japan </P>
    
    <P>2. The music is not at all KaTian - it is much like early Genesis or
      Marillion </P>

    <P>Our friend Mike sent us this. It was in a LA zine called &quot;The
      Altered Mind #11&quot; (it's old...June 1992, so perhaps it's been
      mentioned before. I don't remember.) </P>

    <P>(A Collection of Kate Bush covers) </P>
    
    <P>BCO has the nerve to send us another despite the poor review we gave the
      last one, and I am very happy to have this much more impressive tape.
      Though BCO know how to be extremely alienating and inaccessible, this tape
      is neither. All the pieces have some form of speech on them, which helps
      add a human dimension to the post-music which often sounds machine
      generated. Generally, BCO manipulate the music and vocals of Ms. Bush's
      songs, sometimes adding their own music and other sounds. For some of the
      remakes, BCO have supplied a male vocalist who speaks Ms. Bush's
      once-soprano offerings in a low monotone or silly falsetto. On &quot;Oh,
      England, My Concrete Block,&quot; perhaps the most involving piece, BCO
      take Kate Bush interview excerpts and feeds them through a few of their
      machines. The result is a female voice speaking nonsense and accompanied
      by about six echoes. Finally, in the last seconds, BCO preserve an entire
      coherent phrase and allow it to sum up the song. No one is saying this is
      music, but it certainly has merit as an art form somewhere between spoken
      word and white noise. For anyone interested in audio experimentation, BCO
      is a name to remember. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kat Elwynn Devlin: Kate interpreter in NYC area </P>
    
    <P>[I visited NYC last fall and my sister, a music reviewer for a local
      cabaret monthly, took me to see a performance artist named Kat Elwynn
      Devlin. I posted a review of the show on AOL at the time, but have read
      nary a mention of Devlin since subscribing to Lovehounds for the past
      couple of months. In the event Devlin's been overlooked here, following is
      a copy of my original review] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kat Elwynn Devlin Sings The Songs Of Kate Bush&quot; is just that
      -- Devlin is an actress and club singer and rabid Bush fan whose
      repertoire consists solely of Kate material. I caught her, in a sparsely
      attended mini-concert (i.e. 15 or so people in a lounge that holds 4 times
      that number) during her current engagement Monday nights at Eighty-Eights
      in Greenwich Village. </P>
    
    <P>Devlin started with a somewhat nervous and overly understated reading of
      Running Up The Hill, sans any beat whatsoever, which segued into an
      equally tentative Moments of Pleasure. But with Wuthering Heights, she
      found her groove -- her pianist, Ross Patterson, contributed synthesized
      drums, harpsichord, and bass, and the duo managed to bring off a
      performance which was actually superior to Bush's somewhat fatigued
      Hammersmith Odeon rendition. </P>
    
    <P>Man With The Child In His Eyes was fine but not much different than what
      Kate does, but Devlin breathed new life into Moving and Symphony In Blue
      -- both were better than Kate's originals, with Kat giving each a
      heartfelt, passionate -- and CLEAR -- delivery. In fact, throughout the
      show, Devlin's faultless elocution allowed me to catch many lyrics for the
      very first time. </P>
    
    <P>Other highlights included dramatically performed and imaginatively lit
      versions of Under Ice and Infant Kiss, and enjoyable comedy like There
      Goes A Tenner, Coffee Home Ground, and Babooshka -- all of which probably
      benefited to some extent by Devlin's decision to not fly too solo and
      instead utilize the directorial skills of Drusilla Davis. For her finale,
      Devlin saved the best for last -- a searing, chilling rendition of This
      Woman's Work, which managed to dampen eye sockets as effectively as the
      Sensual World original. </P>
    
    <P>Devlin is more of a KB interpreter than an imitator. She appears more
      comfortable with drama and humor than with sensuality. Feel It, in
      particular, seemed somewhat forced. Her act doesn't include Bush's
      patented Hammersmith pyrotechnics -- mostly, she's at the mike stand,
      sometimes on the piano (shades of SNL!), and sings her heart out. </P>
    
    <P>If you're a KB fan, and getting to NYC on one of the next 3 Mondays is
      doable, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not checking out this
      show. Whether Devlin has the uniqueness and authority to make it big-time
      might be a valid question, but her ability to deliver the goods in the
      meantime to a Kate-starved nation is, IMHO, beyond question. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate in the Toronto Star </P>
    
    <P>In this morning's paper, there is an excellent poem by a Montreal poet,
      Jan Conn. The poem, Love As A Moving Object, uses Kate's song,'O To Be In
      Love', as its base. </P>
    
    <P>Love As A Moving Object </P>
    
    <P>Listening to Kate Bush on the slow
      <BR> early morning drive to work
      <BR> past the huge oaks and bright pink houses on 6th. street,
      <BR> past a disgruntled man in black leather
      <BR> pushing his dysfunctional Harley along the sidewalk,
      <BR> it's going to be at least 90 degrees in the shade,
      <BR> and Kate is singing in her passionate, articulate way
      <BR> about being in love
      <BR> and never getting out of it... </P>
    
    <P>We all know what that means
      <BR> It means to be stalled, trapped,
      <BR> stuck-because love is a moving object,
      <BR> like a duck to a duck hunter
      <BR> who wakes up at 3 a.m. and dresses
      <BR> in prickly long underwear and hip waders
      <BR> shivers in the pre-dawn light, the clouds
      <BR> racing, scattered and eerie overhead,
      <BR> who gets cramps in his legs, who needs
      <BR> desparately to sneeze, who strains to see
      <BR> that fine line dividing water from air,
      <BR> but listens acutely for their telltale calls, </P>
    
    <P>keeps concentrating out there,
      <BR> focused on the weather, the duck's weather,
      <BR> he is like a man
      <BR> who is very attendant to women,
      <BR> who gives the illusion of intimacy,
      <BR> the way the duck hunter takes such good care
      <BR> of his beautiful hand-painted decoys
      <BR> and guns,
      <BR> the way he savours every sweet mouthful
      <BR> of roast duck, later, after he has carried
      <BR> the handfuls of warm dead bodies
      <BR> by the necks and flung them
      <BR> into the back of his pick-up truck
      <BR> and called it a day. </P>

    <P>Peter Buffet, the &quot;Margaritaville&quot; song guy, has done a
      recent, new cover version of James Taylor's old, familiar &quot;Mexico&quot;
      song. It's all over the airwaves, overplayed on soft rock stations in many
      cities. </P>
    
    <P>In the last part of the song, the singer goes into this sort of goofy
      stream-of-conciousness verbage that seems to completely be off the top of
      his head as the chorus sings &quot;Ooooo-oohhh, Mexico!&quot; over and
      over in the background. I don't have it all memorized but most if it goes
      something like this: &quot;Oh yes, we got Mr. Nordstrom in the galley! We
      have the wind on our backs... Sailing into the land of the Mayans...&quot;
      etc. etc.... </P>
    
    <P>The Kate mention is near the very end of the song. It goes like this: &quot;...gay
      men in blue jeans - no, no, that's not politically correct, that's KATE
      BUSH in blue jeans!!!&quot; </P>
    
    <P>I taped it and listened to it several times - it's Her name there all
      right!!! </P>
    
    <P>I am surprised I have not heard about it yet on the net - but then
      again, you guys probably caught it already; and it's all old news to you,
      which would be just my @#$%! luck. :) </P>
    
    <P>-E. </P>

    <P>Where is the magick child, in sleepland Splendid,
      <BR> here faint hope or blithe spirit's rarely found
      <BR> in seas never ventured after mortal day's ended,
      <BR> nor lost in stranger waters where bliss is bound
      <BR> through misty evening tide of unrequited dreams
      <BR> inhaled 'tween cherub lips in so gentle slumber,
      <BR> while midnight winds mingle with moonlight beams
      <BR> to kiss and caress her perfect sense of wonder;
      <BR> she wanders hereafter in legend-haunted groves
      <BR> comforted by laughter and a gift of sacred sight,
      <BR> dances with faeries whose secret names she knows
      <BR> until holy Darkness wakes to put away the night.
      <BR> Now she lies sweetly napping in a bed that's true,
      <BR> upon the open casement, face damp with morning dew. </P>
