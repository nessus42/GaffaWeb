<p>A Fine Love-Hounds Production 
to the best of our knowledge
  as of April the 15th 1996
      compiled/edited 
     by Wieland Willker
</p>

<p>[first transcribed by Andrew B. Marvick (IED), later on improved and corrected 
by various love-hounds (e.g. Bryan Dongray, Emmy May Lombaerts, Violet... ).] 
We should all try to use the Phoenix broadcast titles, because they seem to be 
correct. At least no inconsistencies have been found. IED's titles are given in 
brackets. 
Everybody is invited and encouraged to listen carefully again to the difficult 
passages. Some are almost inaudible. Present your ideas to Love-Hounds! I have 
numbered the lines to make the discussion easier. 
I have added some annotations e.g. differences between the demos and the album 
versions and different suggestions for the uncertain lines. 
What follows are the lyrics in succession as they appear on the Phoenix broadcast 
tape. 
</p>
<h2>ENJOY THE MUSIC! 
</h2>


<h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</h2>
<p>&quot;Hell, IED's been listening to the 1976 demos practically every day for three months 
or more now, and he still doesn't really have anything concrete to say about 
them--only that they are an unassailable, incontrovertible proof that God is living 
among us.&quot;

<h2>The Kick Inside - Brother (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	I've pulled down my lace and the chintz. 
2	Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius? 
3	I'll send your love to Zeus. 
4	Oh, by the time you read this, 
5	I'll be well in touch. 
</p>
<p>6	I'm giving it all in a moment for you. 
7	I'm giving it all in a moment or two. 
8	I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it. 
9	The kicking here inside 
10	Makes me leave you behind. 
11	No more under the quilt 
12	To keep you warm. 
13	Your sister I was born. Lose me. 
14	You must lose me like an arrow, 
15	Shot into the killer storm. 
</p>
<p>16	You and me on the bobbing knee--
17	Welling eyes from identifying with Lizzy Wan's story. 
18	I will come home again, but not until 
19	The sun and the moon meet on yon hill. 
</p>
<p>20	I'm giving it all in a moment for you. 
21	I'm giving it all in a moment or two. 
22	I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it, giving it, giving it! 
23	The kicking here inside 
24	Makes me leave you behind. 
25	No more under the quilt 
26	To keep you warm. 
27	Your sister I was born. Lose me. 
28	You must lose me like an arrow, 
29	Shot into the killer storm. 
</p>
<p>30	I've pulled down my lace and the chintz. 
31	Oh, do you know? You have the face of a genius. 
32	I'll send your love to Zeus. 
33	Oh, by the time you read this...
</p>

<h2>Differences to the album version: 
</h2>
<p>- the lines 6/7 and 20/21 are interchanged. 
- line 8 has an additional fourth &quot;giving it&quot; in the album version. 
- line 13 and 27: the &quot;Lose me&quot;'s are missing in the album version. 
- line 17: album version: &quot; Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read!&quot; 
- line 22 has four &quot;giving it&quot; in the album version. The last two in the demo version 
are sung in a much higher voice.

<h2>Hammer Horror (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	Who stands in the belltower, 
2	Now you're gone. 
3	And who knows all the sights 
4	Of Notre Dame? 
</p>
<p>5	You knew the girls and the times, 
6	You knew the rides and the rhymes. 
7	Now they're trying to push me into your name. 
</p>
<p>8	Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
9	Won't leave it alone. 
10	The first time in my life, 
11	The first break of my life, 
12	I'm letting go. 
13	Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
14	Won't leave it alone. 
15	Oh no, 
16	It's not the right thing to do! 
</p>
<p>17	Who calls me from the other side 
18	Of the street? 
19	And who taps me on the shoulder? 
20	I turn around, but you're gone. 
</p>
<p>21	You know my mind and my heart. 
22	So you should know I wouldn't take your part. 
23	All I want to do is forget 
24	You, friend. 
</p>
<p>25	Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
26	Won't leave it alone. 
27	The first time in my life, 
28	The first break of my life, 
29	I'm letting go. 
30	Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
31	Won't leave it alone. 
32	Oh no, 
33	It's not the right thing to do! 
</p>

<p>Differences to the album version: 
Many differences. I just add the album version: 
</p>
<h2>Hammer Horror (album version)
</h2>
<p>You stood in the belltower, 
But now you're gone. 
So who knows all the sights 
Of Notre Dame? 
</p>
<p>They've got the stars for the gallant hearts. 
I'm the replacement for your part. 
But all I want to do is forget 
You, friend. 
</p>
<p>Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
Won't leave me alone. 
The first time in my life, 
I leave the lights on 
To ease my soul. 
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
Won't leave it alone. 
I don't know, 
Is this the right thing to do? 
</p>
<p>Rehearsing in your things, 
I feel guilty. 
And retracing all the scenes, 
Of your big hit, 
</p>
<p>Oh, God, you needed the leading role. 
It wasn't me who made you go, though. 
Now all I want to do is forget 
You, friend. 
</p>
<p>Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
Won't leave me alone. 
The first time in my life, 
I leave the lights on 
To ease my soul. 
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
Won't leave it alone. 
I don't know, 
Is this the right thing to do? 
</p>
<p>Who calls me from the other side 
Of the street? 
And who taps me on the shoulder? 
I turn around, but you're gone. 
</p>
<p>I've got a hunch that you're following, 
To get your own back on me. 
So all I want to do is forget 
You, friend. 
</p>
<p>Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
Won't leave me alone. 
The first time in my life, 
I leave the lights on 
To ease my soul. 
</p>
<p>Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror, 
Won't leave it alone. 
I don't know, 
Is this the right thing to do?

<h2>It Hurts Me (Feeling Like a Waltz)
</h2>
<h2>(Note: the wrong title &quot;A Rose Growing Old&quot; comes from a mishearing of &quot;Waltz&quot;.) 
</h2>
<p>1	Slipping past the chimney-pots, 
2	Down among the ashes, away from old times--
3	Why must I self-indulge in memories? 
4	I should be celebrating to a moving melody, 
</p>
<p>5	But it hurts me, it hurts me, 
6	Honey, honey, it hurts me. 
7	And I'm feeling like a waltz, 
8	Growing old, - old, old, old, old. 
</p>
<p>9	I was fiery but you put me out. 
10	I was always one for loving and leaving. 
11	I like to think I was immune to romance. 
12	I should be laughing at some good old comedy. 
</p>
<p>13	Oh, but it hurts me, it hurts me. 
14	Honey, honey, it hurts me. 
15	And I'm feeling like a waltz -
</p>
<p>16	If you laughed at me, I'd laugh too. 
17	Waltz, don't you know that I'd be really breakin-ing. 
</p>
<p>18	L'amour--marche avec un etranger. 
19	I shouldn't care, you're not my darling anymore, 
</p>
<p>20	But it hurts me, it hurts me, 
21	Honey, honey, honey, honey. 
22	And I'm feeling like a waltz, 
23	Growing old, old, old, old, old.

<h2>Stranded At The Moonbase (Keeping Me Waiting)
</h2>
<p>1	A long way up in light-years, 
2	Just a pinpoint in space, 
3	In a century of planetary storms, 
4	Stranded at the moonbase, 
</p>
<p>5	The air is getting low. 
6	The air is getting low. 
</p>
<p>7	Looking out at the roof-window, 
8	I've seen many strange things, 
9	From shooting stars to Stars 'n' Stripes--
10	Thought I'd caught a glimpse of golden wings. 
</p>
<p>11	The air is getting low, 
12	The air is getting low, 
13	The air is getting low, 
14	The air is getting low. 
</p>
<p>15	I got the vision of a big white dove. 
16	I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above. 
17	I'm wond'ring why the big white dove 
18	Is keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting, 
19	Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting, 
20	Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting. 
</p>
<p>21	Looking way down below me, 
22	The worlds are all awhirl-whirly. 
23	Won't you come along beside? 
24	This place waits for company. 
</p>
<p>25	The air is getting low. 
26	The air is getting low. 
</p>
<p>27	I leave my limbs behind me. 
28	As I'm being lifted 
29	Out into the--into the 
30	Spiritual boom-boom abyss. 
</p>
<p>31	The air is getting low. 
32	The air is getting low. 
33	The air is getting low. 
34	The air is getting low. 
</p>
<p>35	I got the vision of a big white dove. 
36	I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above. 
37	I'm wond'ring why the big white dove 
38	Is keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting, 
39	Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting, 
40	Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting.

<h2>Kashka from Baghdad (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	Kashka from Baghdad 
2	Lives in sin, they say, 
3	With another man, 
4	But no one knows who. 
</p>
<p>5	Dark lights at night. 
6	No one thinks there's life inside at all, 
7	That there's life inside at all. 
</p>
<p>8	Except for the ladies who clean the house, 
9	Except for the men who put the garbage out. 
</p>
<p>10	At night 
11	They're seen 
12	Laughing, 
13	Dancing. 
14	They know 
15	The way 
16	To be 
17	Happy. 
</p>
<p>18	Never go for walks. 
19	Maybe it's because 
20	The moon's not bright enough. 
21	Light in love, you see. 
</p>
<p>22	I watch their shadows, 
23	Tall and slim, 
24	In the window opposite. 
25	I long to be with them. 
</p>
<p>26	What would I do if I were seen? 
27	What would I do if they knew my feelings? 
</p>
<p>28	At night 
29	They're seen 
30	Laughing, 
31	Loving. 
32	They know 
33	The way 
34	To be 
35	Happy.

<p>	Old friends never call there. 
	Some wonder if life's 
	Inside at all--
	If there's life inside at all. 
</p>
<p>	But we know the lady who rents the room. 
	She catches them calling a la lune.

<h2>Surrender Into The Roses (Carmilla)
</h2>
<p>(Note: the name &quot;Carmilla&quot; comes possibly from the vampire story of the same name 
by Sheridan Le Fanu.) 
</p>
<p>1	Last night you were on my balcony. 
2	You needn't try, know the whole story. 
3	Before it's too late I must get away, 
4	But both of us know you must stay. 
</p>
<p>5	Oh, come on, Carmilla, 
6	Surrender into the roses. 
7	Go back home under the posies. 
8	Surrender into the roses, 
9	Carmilla, Carmilla, Carmilla. 
</p>
<p>10	Tying, dying, flowers around the room. 
11	It keeps me safe, but oh! the sickly perfume. 
12	Well, it makes me long for the good times, 
13	When you were really alive. 
</p>
<p>14	Oh, come on, Carmilla, 
15	Surrender into the roses. 
16	Go back home under the posies.

<h2>Oh To Be in Love (demo version) 
</h2>
<p>1	As the light hits you, 
2	As you shift along the floor, 
3	I find it hard to place my face. 
4	How did I come to be here, anyway? 
5	It's terribly vague, what's been before. 
</p>
<p>6	I could have been anyone. 
7	You could have been anyone's dream. 
8	Why did you have to choose our moment? 
9	Why did you have to make me feel that? 
10	Why did you make it so unreal? 
</p>
<p>11	Oh! To be in love, 
12	And never get out again. 
13	Oh! To be in love, 
14	And never get out again. 
15	Oh! To be in love, 
16	Never get out again. 
</p>
<p>17	All the colours look brighter now. 
18	Everything they say seems to sound new. 
19	Slipping into tomorrow too quick, 
20	Yesterday always too good to forget. 
21	Stop the swing of the pendulum and let us through! 
</p>
<p>22	Oh! To be in love, 
23	And never get out again.

<h2>Rinfy The Gypsy (Playing Canasta in Cold Rooms)
</h2>
<p>(Note: The spelling of &quot;Rinfy&quot; is confirmed by the DJ, who spells it during the 
Phoenix broadcast. The wrong title &quot;In My Lovers Room&quot; comes from a mishearing 
of &quot;oooh&quot; for &quot;room&quot;.) 
</p>
<p>1	I fell in love with Rinfy the gypsy. 
2	He said when I grew up he'd marry me, 
3	Carry me away on his steed. 
</p>
<p>4	&quot;Don't worry, my baby! 
5	Don't die, my funny little darling! 
6	I'm going away for a little while, 
7	And shouldn't be gone for very long.&quot; 
</p>
<p>8	Ooh, then I really fell for Geoffrey, our gardener. 
9	He said he'd marry me, too. 
10	Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool.

<p>11	&quot;Don't worry, my honey!

22	I comforted him, uh-huh. 
</p>
<p>23	&quot;Don't worry, my dear, 
24	Don't cry, you weird little stranger.  [ca. 2'29]

<p>The following songs are probably not from the Phoenix demos tape. 
Organic Acid belongs to the Piano Demos: 
</p>

<h2>Organic Acid
</h2>
<p>IED: 
This song is radically different from the others in that collection, however, in that it 
includes a rather long poem by Kate's brother John Carder Bush, who recites a 
stanza or two between each verse and chorus of Kate's song. (Kate's piano 
continues between verses as a support to John's recitation.) 
IED cannot see any really clear connection between Kate's song and John's poem: 
the former seems to be a kind of lullabye to a troubled lover, and is filled with 
imagery of the sea. (One possibility, therefore, is that this is the song known as 
Atlantis, which IED has not heard but which is listed among the songs on the 
near-mythical album, The Early Years.) John's poem, however, is a far more 
detailed and explicit descriptive poem which details the progress and violent end of a 
vaguely perverted love affair. It is possible that the speaker in Kate's song is 
addressing a character in John's poem, or possibly the narrator of John's poem, 
himself; but neither of these interpretations seems likely to IED. (On the other hand, 
the reference to the beach at the climax of John's poem does provide for the 
possibility that the two are interconnected.) 
It seems more probable that Kate simply invited John to recite one of his poems 
during the performance of her song. She must have felt that the two works 
complemented each other in some intangible way; and IED, for one, agrees with her.

<h2>Organic Acid
</h2>
<p>Poetry by John Carder Bush 
Music and Lyrics by Kate Bush 
</p>
<p>John:
1	&quot;He got her drunk very quickly. 
2	Holding hands, they found the broom-cupboard, 
3	Where he had control as far as the fall, 
4	When his hand covered wet hair. 
5	She took over among furniture wax, 
6	Dust, the cloying yellow of polishing-cloth. 
7	When he was sick, she comforted him.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Kate:
8	Oh, hush, my friend, and sleep, 
9	And cuddle to the wind. 
10	And sleep on through the waves 
11	That may wet your lover's dream. 
</p>
<p>12	We have been far through this night long hours. 
13	We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh... 
</p>
<p>John:
14	&quot;He couldn't do it properly; 
15	The disco, the office, the pub, 
16	Had left out those details of delight. 
17	Satisfied, he would collapse out, 
18	Puzzled at why she still squirmed, 
19	Held onto him, tears curling into her mouth. 
20	This was something their stories always omitted: 
21	That her joy would seem like pain, 
22	When he focused after his release.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Kate:
23	Do sand and shells and stones 
24	Peep in through your night? 
25	But you should not be hurt 
26	For all will pass with time. 
</p>
<p>27	We have been far through this night long hours. 
28	We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh... 
</p>
<p>John:
29	&quot;In the third week of the relationship 
30	She was tripping on organic acid, 
31	Would stop to pick up a rained-out leaf, 
32	Would give it tenderly into his hand--
33	Full of dead things before they reached the car. 
34	When they drove she sat with mouth open 
35	As though photographed on the impact of a stomach punch, 
36	Her right fist gripping the skin of his left leg. 
37	Hooking the steering-wheel closer to his heart, 
38	He feared her, and slapped out sideways into her face. 
39	She entered the cut with her tongue, 
40	Gurgling gratitude for the strange taste.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Kate:
41	Do you fear the dark? 
42	Then hush, and realise 
43	That though the angels never come, 
44	Prayers can soothe your mind. 
</p>
<p>45	We have been far through this night long hour. 
46	We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh... 
</p>
<p>John:
47	&quot;There was no premonition of the wet Hog's back. 
48	The sportscar slumped, snout into a beech, 
49	Their corpses giving the vehicle arms, 
50	Petrol and blood at last dripping together. 
51	But quick flashes of a planned lunch: 
52	Cold red beef, white cloth by a cherrywood fire, 
53	Game pie, and for him two pints of colder beer, 
54	The winter air tucking under their eyelids 
55	As they spun on the gravel at Clandon; 
56	Their hands steaming from quick moisture, 
57	The aromatic finger drawn up to his nostril--
58	Dazed after mutual masturbation, 
59	They zigzagged into a conservative end.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Kate:
60	Oh hush, my friend, and sleep...

<p>Before the Fall
IED has managed to find a copy of John Carder Bush's original poem, &quot;Before the 
Fall&quot;. This poem formed the basis for John's spoken text on the early Kate Bush 
recording which bootleggers and we have mistakenly taken to calling Organic Acid. 
That is, of course, not the actual title. And although we still don't know what Kate's 
original song was called (after all, it was almost certainly not written for JCB's 
poem, but was simply combined with it later during performances), &quot;Before the Fall&quot; 
now seems a more legitimate (though admittedly less fun) title than Organic Acid. 
Here is the poem exactly as it was originally written (it includes many lines that 
were omitted from the recorded version, and lacks a word here and there as well): 
</p>

<h2>Before the Fall
</h2>
<p>He got her drunk very quickly: 
holding hands they found the broom cupboard 
where he had control as far as the fall, 
the rasping descent of her tights. 
When his hand covered wet hairs 
she took over among furniture wax, dust, 
the cloying yellow of polishing cloth. 
When he was sick 
she comforted him. 
</p>
<p>He couldn't do it properly: the club, 
the office had left out details of delight. 
Satisfied, he would collapse out, 
puzzled at why she still squirmed, 
held on to him, tears curling into her mouth. 
This was something stories always omitted: 
that her joy would seem like pain 
when he focused after release. 
</p>
<p>In the third week of the relationship 
she was tripping on organic acid, 
would stop, pick up a rained out leaf, 
would give it into his hand, 
full of dead things before they reached the car. 
When they drove she sat with mouth open 
as though photographed on the impact 
of a stomach punch, her right hand gripping 
the skin of his leg: he feared her, 
slapped out sideways into her face. 
She touched the cut with her tongue, 
gurgling gratitude for the strange taste. 
</p>
<p>He stood looking through uncleaned windows, 
concentrated on the yellow of his car below. 
On the uncarpeted floor, with practice, 
she closed her eyes and drew on the cigarette. 
Twill jacket and polo-neck made him sweat, 
his nape skin red from a hair cut. 
</p>
<p>Between two smokers she smiled up at him; 
as the weed approached he apologised 
suddenly wanting familiar territories: 
beer, to put his hand up her skirt. 
At the bottom of the limbed stairs 
he booted the cat, a drop kick in their twenty-five 
as he imagined her sylph laugh 
gathering chuckles around the room. 
</p>
<p>There was no premonition of the wet Hog's Back, 
sports car slumped snout into a beach, 
their corpses giving the vehicle arms, 
petrol and blood at last dripping together 
but quick flashes of a planned lunch, 
cold red beef and a cherry wood fire, 
game pie and for him two pints of colder beer, 
the winter air tucking under their eye lids, 
spinning on the gravel at Clandon: 
the hand steaming from quick moisture, 
the aromatic finger drawn back into his nose. 
Dazed after mutual masturbation 
they slewed into a conservative end.

<p>1	Moving stranger,

4	Touch me, hold me. 
5	How my open arms ache! 
6	Try to fall for me. 
</p>
<p>7	How I'm moved. 
8	How you move me

11	Please don't let me go. 
12	You crushed the lily in my soul, soul, soul. 
</p>
<p>13	Moving liquid--
14	Yes, you are just as water. 
15	You flow around all that comes in your way. 
16	Don't think it over, 
17	It always takes you over, 
18	And sets your spirit dancing. 
</p>
<p>19	How I'm moved. 
20	How you move me 
21	With your beauty's potency.

<h2>Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	Emma's come down. 
2	She's stopped the light 
3	Shining out of her eyes. 
</p>
<p>4	Emma's been run out on. 
5	She's breaking down 
6	In so many places, 
7	Stuck in low gears 
8	Because of her fears 
</p>
<p>9	Of the skidding wheels, 
10	(The skid of her wheels she feels.) 
11	Skidding wheels, 
12	(The skid of her wheels she feels.) 
13	Skidding wheels. 
14	(Wheel-skidding feeling.) 
</p>
<p>15	Her heart is there, 
16	But they've greased the road. 
17	Her heart is there, 
18	But she's no control. 
</p>
<p>19	Come on, you've got to use your flow. 
20	You know what it's like, and you know you want to go. 
21	Don't drive too slowly. 
22	Don't put your blues where your shoes should be. 
23	Don't put your foot on the heartbrake. 
</p>
<p>24	She's losing that inner flame. 
25	It was burning bright, 
26	But she's losing the fight fast. 
</p>
<p>27	She's only herself to blame. 
28	Remember yourself, 
29	And remember Georgie. 
30	But she's so O.D.'d on weeping  [O.D. = overdosed]
31	And she can hardly see 
</p>
<p>32	She's dropping beads. 
33	(Red, red glass is bleeding.) 
34	Dropping beads. 
35	(Red, red glass is bleeding.) 
36	Dropping beads. 
37	(Red, red on the parquet.) 
</p>
<p>38	Her heart is out there, 
39	But they've greased the road. 
40	Her heart is out there, 
41	But she's no control. 
</p>
<p>42	Oh, come on, you've got to use your flow. 
43	You know what it's like, and you know you want to go. 
44	Don't drive too slowly. 
45	Don't put your blues where your shoes should be. 
46	Don't put your foot on the heartbrake. 
</p>
<p>47	Oh, come on, you've got to use your flow. 
48	You know what it's like, and you know you want to go. 
49	Don't drive too slowly. 
50	Don't put your blues where your shoes should be. 
51	Don't put your foot on the heartbrake.

<h2>Kite (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o. 
2	My feet are heavy and I'm rooted in my wellios. 
3	And I want to get away and go 
4	From all these mirror windows. 
</p>
<p>5	I look at eye level, it isn't good enough. 
6	And then I find it out when I take a good look up. 
7	There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball 
8	Calling me: 
</p>
<p>9	&quot;Come up and be a kite, 
10	And fly a diamond night
11	A diamond kite, a diamond kite. 
12	Ooh, what a diamond! 
</p>
<p>13	&quot;A diamond kite 
14	On a diamond flight. 
15	Over the lights, under the moon. 
16	Over the lights, under the moon. 
17	Over the moon, over the moon!&quot; 
</p>
<p>18	I feel a rush along my body, like a bullet. 
19	I'm 2-D after a push-and-pull feeling. 
20	And I want to get back to safe home: 
21	Cause I love that dome. 
</p>
<p>22	I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind. 
23	Well, I'm not sure if I want to be up here, at all. 
24	And I'd like to be back on the ground, 
25	But I don't know how to get down--down--down! 
</p>
<p>26	&quot;Come up and be a kite, 
27	And fly a diamond night
28	A diamond kite, a diamond kite. 
29	Ooh, what a diamond! 
</p>
<p>30	&quot;A diamond kite 
31	On a diamond flight. 
32	Over the lights, oooh, under the moon. 
33	Over the lights, oooh, under the moon. 
34	Over the moon, over the moon!&quot;

<h2>L'Amour Looks Something Like You (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	You came out of the night, 
2	Wearing a mask in white colour. 
3	My eyes were shining 
4	On the wine, and your aura. 
5	All in order, we move into the boudoir, 
6	But too soon the morning has resumed. 
</p>
<p>7	I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon. 
8	You look like an angel, 
9	Sleeping it off at a station. 
10	Were you only passing through? 
</p>
<p>11	I'm dying for you just to touch me, 
12	And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me. 
13	L'amour looks something like you. 
</p>
<p>14	The thought of you sends me shivery. 
15	I'm dressed in a lace, sailing down a black reverie. 
16	My heart is thrown 
17	To the pebbles and the boatmen. 
18	All the time I find I'm living in that evening, 
19	With that feeling of sticky love inside. 
</p>
<p>20	I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon. 
21	You look like an angel,

<h2>Strange Phenomena (demo version)
</h2>
<p>1	Soon it will be the phase of the moon 
2	When people tune in. 
3	Every girl knows about the punctual blues, 
4	But who's to know the power behind our moves? 
</p>
<p>5	A day of coincidence with the radio, 
6	And a word that won't go away. 
7	We know what they're all going to say. 
8	&quot;G&quot; arrives--&quot;Funny, had a feeling he was on his way!&quot; 
</p>
<p>9	We raise our hats to the strange phenomena. 
10	Soul-birds of a feather flock together. 
11	We raise our hats to the hand a-moulding us. 
12	Sure 'nuff, he has the answer, 
13	He has the answer 
14	He has the answer,...
15	&quot;Oooohooo hoooo...
16	Oooohooo hoooo... 
17	Oooohooo hoooo...&quot; 
</p>
<p>18	You pick up a paper. You read a name. 
19	You go out. It turns up again and again. 
20	You bump into a friend you haven't seen for a long time, 
21	Then into another you only thought about last night. 
</p>
<p>22	You hear your sister calling for you, 
23	But you don't know where from. 
24	You know there's something wrong, 
25	But you don't want to believe in a premonition. 
</p>
<p>26	We raise our hats to the strange phenomena.

<h2>Scares Me Silly
</h2>
<p>1	Here in the studio, 
2	As they're turning down the lights, 
3	I lick my lips to start the first line--
4	How can this girl be me? 
5	&quot;Oh, little thing, are you looking lost?&quot;
6	The vertigo, the need to lose. 
</p>
<p>7	Ooh, ooh... 
8	They try to trip me up and tapes begin to spin.  [ca. 0'35]
9	I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in. 
10	I try to put it all in, do it for you. 
11	Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.

15	Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.

<p>16	Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  [ca 1'05]
17	Like a Romeo. 
18	Scares me silly, but it gets me going, 
19	Like a Romeo. 
20	Scares me silly, but it gets me going. 
</p>
<p>21	Swimming amid the cans,  [ca. 1'39]
22	I wonder can I goad myself into another take, 
23	And keep the mood? 
24	It's like a film - such balance.  [ca. 1'48]
25	I close my eyes to the cello solo, and ache. 
26	The music will never let me blow away - you-oo
</p>
<p>27	You know the feeling when you're on the right track.  [ca. 2'02]
28	You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back. 
29	It's recording you, they're so sensitive. 
30	Oozing without me, spilling over with secrets. 
</p>
<p>31	You know the feeling when you're on the right track. [ca. 2'16]
