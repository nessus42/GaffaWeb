    <P>Random trivia: Kate likes punk and the Sex Pistols (see &quot;Blow Away&quot;).
      She said very recently (within the last month) that the worst day of her
      life was when Killing Joke (a punk group) broke up. (I think she was
      exagerating a little....) Killing Joke was her favorite band of 1984, and
      her favorite song was &quot;Eighties&quot; by Killing Joke. Someone from
      Killing Joke plays guitar on &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Killing Joke </P>
    
    <P>Hmmm... Killing Joke was a really excellent band. However, &quot;Eighties&quot;
      was written when they needed some cash... very flashy video, and not
      enough power to catch me... also, it was done AFTER their bassist left and
      went to iceland to start a two basist, no guitarist band -- they turned
      out really well, but, alas, broke up shortly thereafter... </P>
    
    <P>I saw Killing Joke at an outdoor concert in Toronto about 3 summers ago,
      and they blew me away... someone had a sound pressure meter and the band
      was clocked at 140+ db! The acoustics at that concert were also, by the
      way, far and away the best I've ever heard. It was billed as a &quot;Police
      Picnic&quot; with the terrible threesome headlining, but featured some
      TERRIFIC opening bands... Nash the Slash, Oingo Boingo, Iggy Pop, The
      Go-Go's (before anyone knew who they were) and the SPECIALS &lt;-- only
      other band (besides the Police, of course) that was allowed an encore...
      One of the greatest performances of my life! They were astounding! I was
      so strung out after they finished that I slept through most of the Police.
      Ho hum. </P>

    <P>I really like &quot;Eighties&quot;! It's definitely not my favorite song
      of '84, though, and I haven't seen the video. It's pretty strange that
      it's Kate's favorite. She has a very diverse set of tastes in music: from
      Captain Beefheart to Stevie Wonder (&quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; was
      inspired by a Stevie Wonder concert) to Irish jigs to punk to sea chantees
      to John Lennon to voodoo chants to Steely Dan to David Bowie to The
      Eagles. I wouldn't have expected Killing Joke to be at the top of the
      list, though... </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate Bush and the working class </P>
    
    <P>.... </P>
    
    <P>I recently talked via telephone to a record collector who specializes in
      (among others) Kate Bush. Every now and then, he goes to England to search
      through record stores. He said that in all the time he's been doing this,
      he's never met a Kate Bush fan working in a record store. He said that
      sometimes people even get quite antagonistic when he mentions Kate Bush.
    </P>
    
    <P>He feels that this has something to do with the more stratified class
      structure that exists in England. Someone who works in a record store is
      probably of the working class, and Kate Bush was born into a rich landed
      family. This and the fact that she was basically *handed* a record
      contract when she was sixteen with the help of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour
      and that she was immediately incredibly successful (her first single went
      to number one and stayed there for four weeks) without having to struggle
      at all, cause many to see her as someone who has never had to work a day
      in her life. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, in reality, she works very hard. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho&quot; </P>

      a painting style that died out as Raphael came to prominence and claimed
      to emulate that style. They were quite fond of this one, stunning, model

    <P>One of my British pen pals sent me some KB articles from the magazines &quot;Smash
      Hits&quot; and &quot;Record Mirror.&quot; Here are some KB facts that were
      new to me... </P>
    
    <P>* Kate collects earrings. </P>
    
    <P>* Kate has received several proposals of marriage from fans, but she
      always writes kind, but firm, letters back. (Does KB in fact have an SO -
      sig-nificant other? Anyone heard anything about her love life? Just
      curious.) </P>
    
    <P>* One fan offered to skin himself and roll in salt in exchange for a
      gift from her. </P>
    
    <P>* Kate can't write songs unless she's done all the dirty dishes in the
      sink and cleaned up her house - she likes doing her own housework! </P>
    
    <P>* Kate has been offered roles in a couple of vampire films. </P>
    
    <P>* She's a chocolate addict - see, KB and I have something in common!
    </P>
    
    <P>* One wall of her dance room is covered in mirrors, the other features a
      huge, gruesome painting of a baby doll, its head cracked open,
      half-submerged in a pool of water. </P>
    
    <P>* &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; is Kate's favorite of her videos. </P>
    
    <P>* Kate doesn't listen to contemporary music - she didn't know who
      Madonna was until Live Aid. </P>
    
    <P>-Sue </P>

      <BR> Subject: Bath water </P>
    
    <P>&gt; * One fan offered to skin himself and roll in salt in exchange for
      a gift from her. </P>
    
    <P>This is from a letter to Record Mirror in 1978 that said </P>
    
    <P>You, yes you, reading this letter, buy Kate Bush's single. God she's
      ace. I'd crawl a million miles backwards over broken glass to gargle with
      her bathwater. I'd peel off my skin and jump in a bag of salt for a pair
      of her panties. Print a quadruple poster of her in the nude please. </P>
    
    <P>This was at the time when the original huge KB publicity poster was
      posted all over London and on busses, etc. This is *quite* some poster --
      it is *not* a safe poster to see.... the photographer who took this, sure
      understood how to manipulate men's minds.... </P>
    
    <P>&gt; * Kate doesn't listen to contemporary music - she didn't know who
      Madonna was until Live Aid. </P>
    
    <P>Kate refuses to insult anyone. Whenever anyone asks her &quot;What do
      you think of Foo?&quot; she always says &quot;I think Foo's great!&quot; I
      bet she knew perfectly well who Madonna is (she says she watches lots of
      videos, so how could she not?), but just couldn't bring herself to say
      something good about her. </P>
    
    <P>[Roy Harper] </P>
    
    <P>His records are *very* difficult to find! You might be able to find his
      latest album &quot;Whatever Happened To Jugula?&quot; though, because it
      is being carried in lots of record stores because Jimmy Page's name is in
      big writing on the cover. It is also his best album. Other great albums
      include &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; (1980) and &quot;Come Out Fighting
      Ghengis Smith&quot; (1967). Kate does a duet with Roy on &quot;The Unknown
      Soldier&quot; and in the runoff groove is scratched &quot;To Kate with
      love Roy&quot;. Roy does a very interesting and original brand of
      folk-rock, and his songs range from extremely tender love songs, to
      intense erotica, to craziness, to vicious and powerful attacks on the
      things he does not like. </P>

    <P>Well, I dunno about little green men, but yeah, she believes in all the
      mystical stuff that one loved to believe in as a little kid, but
      unfortunately didn't anymore upon growing up, cynical, and realistic:
      UFO's, ghosts, reincarnation, astrology, the Loch Ness Monster, ESP,
      precognition, orgone accumulators, synchronicity, ... the works. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; And astral projection? Somebody (Oh DOUUUUUGGGGG????) wanna

    <P>Yeah, astral projection. Listen to &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;
      and &quot;Hello Earth&quot;. She's admited to believing in most of these
      things at some point or another, but doesn't seemed to be particularly
      obsessed with any of them. For example, she says that astrology has been
      used for such a long time that there must be something to it. But only &quot;real&quot;
      astrology -- not the &quot;rubbish&quot; that's in the newspapers. She
      however, says that she doesn't follow astrology. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate and the Beatles </P>
    
    <P>To Neil Calton: </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, Kate said in a recent interview that she hadn't really
      become too aware of the Beatles' music until a few years ago. Of course
      this doesn't preclude the possibility that Hounds of Love was influenced
      by Sgt. Pepper, but it's unlikely that the link between the Beatles'
      records and Kate's earlier creations is very close. </P>
    
    <P> [I don't know how much Kate was affected by The Beatles prior to *The
      Dreaming*, but I KNOW she was very strongly influenced by John Lennon. I
      have a radio show that was done inbetween *Never for Ever* and *The
      Dreaming* where Kate is sort of the guest DJ. In this show she says that
      Lennon's &quot;Number Nine Dream&quot; is her favourite song of all time
      and that she just loves the stuff he did with backwards vocals. </P>
    
    <P>Kate was also very affected by the murder of Lennon. Shortly after his
      murder, she became very depressed. She installed a camera security system
      in her flat in London with a remote mechanism for opening the door and has
      an aversion to city living ever since. There are several allusions to the
      effect that Lennon's murder had on her in the lyrics on *The Dreaming*. &quot;Now
      when they ring, I get my machine to let them in,&quot; and &quot;My door
      was never locked/ Until one day a trigger come --cocking,&quot; for
      example. -- |&gt;oug ] </P>

    <P>According to the latest (or at least a quite recent) issue of the
      College Media Journal, Kate has lost her American record deal! Apparently,
      in the merger of EMI with Manhattan records (this is from memory), several
      groups were dropped from the EMI roster, including the divine Ms. Bush.

    <P>I talked to a contact at Capitol Records today to find out more about
      EMI-America allegedly dropping Kate Bush. According to Capitol, that is
      not the case. It is true, however, that Kate's US record contract is up in
      the air at the moment. As some of you may know, EMI-America (a subsidiary
      of Capitol) has merged with Manhattan Records and is now called
      EMI-Manhattan. From now on, they are supposedly going to concentrate on
      the east coast scene. In the mean time, while all this was going on,
      Kate's contract with EMI-America expired and in the shuffle both
      EMI-America and Kate were apparently too busy to notice. Capitol wants
      Kate back, but she hasn't decided yet what she wants to do. According to
      Capitol, she says she isn't necessarily going to renew her contract with
      Capitol. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate's speaking voice </P>
    
    <P>Hearing these very recent interviews after a long spell of listening to
      some of the earlier interviews, it occurs to IED again that Kate has
      become an even more articulate and eloquent speaker than she was a decade
      ago. She has also radically reduced both the expressive range of her
      speaking voice and the &quot;South London&quot; accent which she used to
      assume in interview situations. For years it has seemed to IED that the
      now-forsaken &quot;popular&quot; accent which Kate used to sport during
      her public appearances was affected rather than ingrained, because no
      other members of Kate's family spoke with such an accent, and because its
      intensity seemed to vary depending upon the social and topical context in
      which she was speaking. Her present accent, which more closely
      approximates &quot;U&quot; diction, and which she has used with a new
      consistency over the past three years or so, is very likely another more
      or less calculated element in her promotional campaign for the post-
      Dreaming work, since it reinforces the seriousness and sobriety of thought
      and feeling which Kate has tried to communicate in her tone and choice of
      words since 1985, in a clear effort to correct her undeserved image as a
      naive and overly effusive flower-child. </P>

    <P>While in England a few months ago, I FINALLY made a pilgrimage to
      Welling-East Wickham (home of Our Lady of Song, or at least her parents).
      Not wishing to be an obnoxious geek fan, a clicked off a few shots of East
      Wickham Farm, then walked around Fanny-on-the-Hill, Plumstead Cemetary,
      and Bostall Woods. </P>
    
    <P>When I got off the train at Welling, a woman and a girl also got off. By
      their relative ages, I assumed the girl was the woman's granddaughter.
      Maybe it was my state-of-mind, but the woman looked like Hannah Bush,
      Kate's mum. I've only seen a couple of pictures of her, but this looked
      like her. But I couldn't place the girl. </P>
    
    <P>So here's the question: Are Jay or Paddy married? </P>

      <BR> Subject: Welling </P>
    
    <P> The surrounding community is not particularly charming. Welling is at
      first sight a decidedly ordinary suburb. The Wimpy's is small and
      makeshift Formica. A laundromat, a sleepy post office. The Welling
      Woolworth's stocks one or two of her albums, but the display in the window
      advertises Rick Astley. </P>
    
    <P>Moving past that modest centre of town, you pass under the railroad
      bridge on your way toward Mecca (Tibet or Jedda). There, in the shadow of
      the bridge, crookedly stands an aging phonebooth: fire-engine red, the
      refuge of a large, slow old spider. On the right begins a long train of
      identikit houses, on the left the occasional secreterial supply shop and
      tea-house. </P>
    
    <P>Finally you come upon The Intersection: Wickham Street looms on the
      left. Now that's more like it: the hum of mopeds and milk-lorries fades
      right away, and you're left alone in the shadowy stillness of East Wickham
      Farm. No other structures share this block, so far as you can see. Lining
      the length of the street is a plain wooden fence which just manages to
      contain a dense overgrowth of trees and ivy. Seen with difficulty through
      this is the peak of a Tudor roof: you have arrived. </P>
    
    <P>The quiet is complete once you pull the gate shut behind you; in front
      now, at the end of a short tunnel of pathway hewn out of the riot of
      autumny vines, you see a surprisingly small cottage. The windows are small
      and mullioned, the door and its bell sweetly atilt. This is an old
      structure, so certified by the Ministry of Historical Buildings. </P>
    
    <P>Mr. John Carder Bush is there to greet you with a quiet, chocolaty voice
      and a zen calm that seem fully part of the house. With a politeness as
      though to confirm the sanctity of Idea he draws you into the tiny suite of
      front rooms. Before you climbs a darkly gleaming staircase, to the right
      some sort of parlor, but you can't see more for your host has led you to
      the left, where The Spinet holds silently forth over
      electric-heater-filled hearth and doilied couches. One pleasantly
      threadworn Isfahan carpet keeps company with an unthreatening lionskin at
      your feet. And on the low mantle you can see some family snapshots: a
      couple of grandchildren, mom and dad, God Incarnate at age 12 or so...

      1979, when Kate went to Switzerland to film (tape) two lip-synchs for a
      pair of projected Abba TV specials (the Abba Easter Special and the Winter
      Snowtime Special) for UK TV. For the first, she did a performance of Wow,
      which was later aired on the Easter special. For the second, she did a
      performance of Wuthering Heights barefoot in the Alpine snow. A photo was
      printed in a U.K. music paper showing Kate on location. Unfortunately that
      performance was never aired, but was replaced at the last moment by a
      lip-synch of December Will Be Magic Again. </P>
    
    <P>There is no record of any actual contact between Kate and the members of
      Abba, however. She simply appeared, solo, on their shows. </P>

    <P>&gt; And a bonus for Love-Hounds (amazingly missed by pv04+) is that
      there is a nice sized picture of Kate Bush. I think he missed it because
      it is in... the classical music section. She's clutching a fab British
      classical violinist named Kennedy (the actual subject of the article).
    </P>
    
    <P>IED doesn't know about pv04+, but IED didn't miss it. Phil Verdieck,
      incidentally, already reported on the Peter Gabriel piece in Q a while
      ago, and IED owes his ownership of that issue (with its photo of Kate and
      N. Kennedy) to another early report by a Love-Hound whose name IED regrets
      escapes him at present. Many thanks. Also, Kate is not &quot;clutching&quot;
      Kennedy in the photo. Rather, she is being clutched by Kennedy, and (as
      usual) heroically maintaining her composure. It's a nice photo, though a
      bit blurry. </P>
    
    <P>An inquiry was made about the photo's date: it is from Kate's last
      appearance at the BPI's, in 1987. No reason to assume otherwise, since
      Kate is dressed exactly as she was for the '87 BPIs and had already worked
      with Kennedy by that time, on both the X4 recording and the Wogan Show
      lip-synch for it. </P>

    <P> Kate herself actually was introduced to the Windham Hill label back in
      1983 (long before there was even a genre known as New Age music) when two
      well-known Kate fans (not on this computer group) from the midwest sent
      her what was then the entire W.H. catalogue. She liked it very much, and
      mentioned Windham Hill in a couple of interviews, calling it &quot;very
      beautiful music&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Of course that was not only before the rise of &quot;New Age music&quot;.
      At that time both the genre and the label were still quite new and much
      less well-known and defined than now. They were also far less overtly
      commercial than they often are now. There were very few artists and albums
      in the W.H. catalogue back then, so it actually meant something when Kate
      said she liked the whole label. Now, of course, there is a much wider
      variety of styles and an extensive Windham Hill catalogue, so it's far
      less likely that Kate's present view of the label is the same as it
      originally was. </P>
    
    <P>It is possible that the choice of placing the photo of Kate with Bonnie
      and Clyde (from the front cover of HoL ) in the center of the album's
      cover, on a plain white field, was influenced by the affection she had at
      that time for the first wave of Windham Hill albums, which she had seen
      for the first time all at once. </P>

      <BR> Subject: her cats </P>
    
    <P>Twice in the past the question of Kate's diet-policies in relation to
      her cats has been raised (by our Pseudo-Moderator :&gt;oug). It was
      contended that Kate's willingness to feed fish to her cats might
      constitute a hypocritical act, since it apparently flew in the face of her
      avowed vegetarian convictions. The first time IED promptly disagreed, both
      because Kate's own diet shouldn't be confused with her cats' diet; and
      because cats, unlike humans, are not ominvorous animals, but are by nature
      carnivores. This response apparently made little impression on :&gt;oug,
      since he recently raised the issue again, and implied the same criticism
      of Kate which he had made the first time. </P>
    
    <P>The question was raised in the Science Times section of the New York
      Times a couple of weeks ago. Here is the excerpt in its entirety: </P>
    
    <P> Q.: Could a healthy vegetarian diet be devised for cats? </P>
    
    <P>A.: &quot;Definitely not,&quot; said Prof. James Morris of the
      Department of Physiological Science at the School of Veterinary Medicine
      of the University of California at Davis. </P>
    
    <P>A vegetable-based diet could be devised, he said, but only if some
      chemical reagents and animal fats were added to it. That is because cats
      cannot synthesize some of the essential fatty acids found in animal fat.
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;For example, plants have virtually none of an amino acid called
      taurine,&quot; he said. &quot;Taurine deficiency results in blindness and
      loss of hearing, dilated cardiomyopathy, grave retardation in kittens and
      the birth of kittens with developmental abnormalities.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Let's hope that puts an end once and for all to the aspursions which :&gt;oug
      has cast on Kate's policy regarding Pye and Co.'s diet of &quot;fishy-wishy&quot;.

    <P>Mark Anderson asks whether it is true that Kate &quot;believes in&quot;
      astral projection, and quotes :&gt;oug's reply of months ago: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Yeah, astral projection. Listen to &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;
      and &quot;Hello Earth&quot;. She's admited to believing in most of these
      things at some point or another, but doesn't seemed to be particularly
      obsessed with any of them. </P>
    
    <P> :&gt;oug's reply above is false and misleading. Kate Bush has never
      actually said that she &quot;believed&quot; in any supernatural phenomena
      outright. Even in the early interviews, when she was far more vocal and
      innocent in her enthusiasm for the paranormal (and everything else) than
      she is these days, she did not say &quot;Yes, I believe in super-natural
      phenomena.&quot; And although she did come close to saying as much in some
      of the very early interviews (ca. 1978-79), she certainly doesn't say any
      such thing these days. In fact, she goes out of her way to answer, in most
      situations, that she finds the idea of these phenomena very interesting (&quot;fascinating&quot;
      is her usual word). Her position has always been that supernatural
      phenomena might exist, and that her mind remains completely open to the
      possibility. She does not, however, say that she &quot;believes&quot; that
      such phenomena actually exist. Note a typical example above, in the quote
      IED includes above about sensory deprivation (&quot;the whole thing of
      sensory deprivation...And I just found the whole idea fascinating.&quot;)
    </P>
    
    <P>Also, remember the line from her own song of 1978, Them Heavy People,
      which she has described as a kind of personal anthem: &quot;Don't need no
      crystal ball/No need for a magic wand/We humans got it all/We perform the
      miracles.&quot; </P>

    <P>Well, Nolan, you've got it almost right. Kate's father is English
      through and through (or at least a ways back--for a thorough and rather
      boring recap of both parents' ancestry see Vermorel's scummy book The
      Secret History of Kate Bush ). </P>
    
    <P>Kate's mother Hannah, however, is indeed 100% Irish. She grew up in
      Ireland, and was in fact a skilled dancer of Irish folk-dance, so Kate has
      told us. The musical influence from Ireland is due in part, therefore, to
      Hannah's background, but perhaps more directly it stems from the deep
      interest in Irish folk music which Kate's brothers Paddy and John Carder
      Bush had when they were in their teens and Kate still a little girl.
      (Paddy has, of course, gone on to become a scholar and maker of ancient
      musical instruments, including many Celtic instruments which are rare or
      even extinct today.) </P>
    
    <P>Both brothers belonged to folk-influenced groups for a time during the
      late '60s-early '70s, and Kate has spoken often of night in her youth,
      spent round the hearth of their sitting room at East Wickham Farm when her
      brothers, uncles and aunts would play and sing Irish music till late at
      night. Kate considers those experiences to have been among the most
      important formative influences on her art. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Lindsay Kemp </P>
    
    <P>Just recently I rented the video of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (British
      c1973) and was surprised to see Lindsay Kemp's name in the opening
      credits. The story is about a police detective who visits an island
      community off the English coast after getting a complaint that a girl may
      have been sacrificed to the local gods. The island has gone pagan under
      the leadership of the local gentry, and the movie presents a fairly
      sympathetic picture of a culture where sexuality is openly reverenced.
    </P>
    
    <P>Kemp plays the local innkeeper, whose daughter (Britt Ecklund) is a kind
      of 'temple prostitute' who initiates young men into sexual experience.
      Kemp does no dancing, but does join in a bawdy song about his daughter.
    </P>
    
    <P>But later in the film, at the Mayday festival, he is supposed to take
      the role of the Fool .... </P>
    
    <P>Which put me in mind of a certain song about a homosexual actor who they
      give a part to, but he has to play the fool... (I have no idea if Kemp is
      gay, but I've read that his great theatrical success was in drag-- I
      forget the name of the play...) </P>
    
    <P>(And I don't find any other listing for him in the actors index of my
      video guide...) </P>

    <P>Jorn Barger's observations about The Wicker Man are much appreciated by
      IED. It does sound like a likely source for the subject matter of Kate's
      song Wow. IED recalls how years went by before someone asked Kate whether
      the line &quot;Put out the light/Then put out the light&quot; in Blow Away
      wasn't a reference to Othello, where upon she admitted happily that, sure
      enough, it was. How many such &quot;hidden&quot; subjects, highly specific
      but never volunteered by Kate, still wait to be unearthed by fans? </P>
    
    <P>As for :&gt;oug's allusion to a &quot;rumor&quot; that Kate &quot;had a
      crush&quot; on Lindsay Kemp, IED wonders where our Pseudo-Moderator comes
      up with this kind of irrelevant and frivolous crap? It's the first IED has

    <P>It hardly seems to me that discussing the possible subject matter of &quot;Moving&quot;
      is either frivolous or irrelevant. I don't know where the rumour re
      Lindsay Kemp comes from, but I would guess it merely comes from the fact
      that Kate *has* said that &quot;Moving&quot; was inspired by Lindsay Kemp,
      and the song appears to be a love song of sorts. If you know that Lindsay
      Kemp is gay and a dance/mime artist, the song makes a lot of sense if read
      as a love letter to him. The dear reader can make up his or her own mind

      (hosted by that virtually unintelligibly frenchman, Antione de Caunes)
      last night. The programme ran a feature on music from Ireland and its
      major influence on popular music today, and so naturally included a few
      comments from Herself. She mentioned the fact that her mother was Irish,
      and the huge influence Irish music had on her, especially when she was
      growing up. She also spoke of her association with Irish musicians. </P>
    
    <P>The weird thing was that they also showed a clip from &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;

      Kate Bush, appearing at the Rose of Lee in Lewisham, in 1977.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>All you fanatics (and you know who you are) simply *have to* get this
      picture. I've never seen any others of her with the KT Bush Band. In fact,
      I've never seen any others of her in this period at all! Kate's standing
      with the mike in front of her face, mouth open. She looks about 15. She's
      standing in front of a drum with the band's name on it. You can also see
      the drummer and a guitar or bass player (I can never tell the instruments
      apart by sight), who could conceivably by Del Palmer. In the hand not
      holding the microphone, Kate appears to be holding something else, but I'm
      not sure what. </P>

    <P>PADDY: I split the atom on my way home from rugger. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I'll split your lip in a minute you boring old fart. (Kate grabs
      for her mother's loom and stuns Paddy with it.) </P>

    <P>Chris here, </P>
    
    <P>A bit from Andy's transcription of the Q &amp; A session... </P>
    
    <P> &quot;This is a Mary Poppins bag, isn't it? Goes up onto the stage and
      gets out a giraffe...&quot; </P>
    
    <P> ...reminded me of the wonderful (but unfortunately short-lived) fanzine
      &quot;For The Love of Kate&quot;. It was produced by Gillian Garr and
      friends of Seattle, and we have four issues.</P>
    
    <P>As they didn't have any actual information about Kate or her activities,
      they just made it all up. The result is some of the funniest, and in some
      ways truest, stuff ever written about Kate. Here is the bit I was reminded
      of ... </P>
    
    <P> The Poppins Connection </P>
    
    <P> It's a fact that Kate was born, and grew up, living the life of a
      fairly normal child. But even at a tender age, she was reaching out,
      learning to grow. Check her early performance as &quot;Jane&quot; in the
      film 'Mary Poppins'. Such play acting was not just a job to her. Kate went
      on to adopt Mary Poppins as her mentor, and threw herself into Poppins'
      way of life. </P>
    
    <P>Mary Poppins was a dedicated lady, who took her job very seriously.
      Suffering no nonsense from anybody, many thought her strict and hard.
      However, she delt with herself in an equally firm manner, setting higher
      standards for herself than she ever expected from anyone else. As a
      result, she did become &quot;practically perfect in every way.&quot;
      Besides learning how to succeed in a tough, competitive world, Poppins
      also developed several skills that served her well; singing, flying, and
      telekinesis. Following this example, Kate also developed these skills.
    </P>
    
    <P> ...sure it's absolute nonsense but what the hell! It goes on to
      describe that every one of Kate songs is autobiographical. I'd type more
      in, but text alone cannot do it justice; a typical page might have 2 or 3
      small pictures with strange captions like a photo of &quot;Divine&quot;
      with the caption &quot;'The Dreaming' captured many new fans for Kate&quot;
      or a photo of Paul McCartney with the caption &quot;I had my picture taken
      with Kate Bush once, and since then I've had several hit records!&quot;

    <P>Just for the record - the two people who Kate spoke on behalf of in the
      Prisoners of Conscience spot last Thursday on BBC 2 were both South
      Koreans imprisoned by their government for supposedly collaborating with
      the North. Kate described their work, the reasons why they had been
      imprisoned and their current condition (as far as it was known). </P>
    
    <P>They were Hong Song-Dam a woodcut artist and Chang Ui-gyun a poet. Both
      had been jailed under feeble contexts and tortured. I have no information
      as to whether Kate chose these people herself from a list offered by
      Amnesty International or whether she offered her services for whoever they
      wanted to select. </P>

    <P>Kate spoke directly to camera during both programmes which as I said
      earlier were each only 5 minutes in duration. Kate was seated and seen in
      either head and shoulder shots or from the waist up. Kate spoke for the
      entire programme and there were intercuts of photos of the two men and
      their families and, in the case of the artist, photos of some of his work.
    </P>
    
    <P>Kate spoke in a very formal, pronounced style; almost certainly from an
      autocue. The script gave quite detailed accounts of the two men, their
      work, and their treatment by the state. I would say it was highly unlikely
      that Kate wrote it. The programmes did not have any credits at the end to
      indicate who had been involved in their making (someone within Amnesty
      International almost certainly). There was no music during the programmes
      but each one (there were 2 such programmes each day for a fortnight) began
      and ended with a piece of music which sounded like a Peter Gabriel tune
      (perhaps some other UK Lovehound knows what this was?) </P>

      <BR> Subject: KT </P>
    
    <P> Chris Ridd also asked: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; About a week or so ago, someone posted the (intriguing) suggestion
      that Kate borrowed the 'KT' symbol from the Knights Templars. </P>
    
    <P> Kate has claimed that she and one of her brothers &quot;found the
      symbol on the wall of an old house&quot; and she just liked it and
      appropriated it for her own use. </P>
    
    <P>This may or may not be true. Kate sometimes makes things up if she
      dosn't want to bother to explain a complex situation. In mortals this
      behavior is called &quot;lying&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Kate has mentioned that her reading preferences tend to non-fiction. We
      don't know if she has read any of the books you mention, but it is
      possible. We also don't know if the history of the Knights is taught in
      British convent schools. Probably not, and if not the illicit nature of a
      secret order that pushed the Church around before finally being
      slaughtered at the order of a Pope might be quite intriguing to a bright,
      imaginative person going through an adolescent &quot;crisis of faith&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>Jorn Barger lent me a book called &quot;The Holy Blood and The Holy
      Grail&quot; that you might want to check out. </P>
    
    <P>We don't even know why &quot;KT&quot; as in &quot;The KT Bush Band&quot;.
      &quot;KT&quot; would be &quot;Katey&quot; rather than &quot;Kate&quot; and
      she has never been known as &quot;Katey&quot;. Before her birth
      certificate appeared in a book, supporting her claim of not having a
      middle name I was certain that it had to be &quot;Teresa&quot; I know its
      a silly supposition but Catholic girls named Catherine have the middle
      name Teresa as often as Catholic boys named Francis have the middle name
      Xavier.</P>

      <BR> Subject: Night Flight interview </P>
    
    <P>I'm putting together a file of exceptionally stupid questions Kate has
      been asked. Another in the .sig below. </P>
    
    <P>We were sitting in the control room when this interview was being
      filmed. We were biting our lips to keep from shouting out corrections and
      gritting our teeth as the best explanation of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; was
      ruined by an incompetent sound-man who had duct-taped (gaffa, if you
      insist) Kate's big floppy bow-tie to her jacket rather than moving the
      mike to the other side. An additional funny bit of the interview was
      pointed out to us by Kris and Peter when we showed this piece to them.
      Here is the bit... </P>
    
    <P>Stupid Interviewer from Night Flight (SI) </P>
    
    <P>Our Heroine (KT) </P>
    
    <P> SI: There's another song &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; called &quot;Big
      Sky&quot; (sp) I think, where you used a couple of back-up singers... </P>
    
    <P>KT: uhm... </P>
    
    <P>SI: ...do you use back-up singers on this album?.. </P>
    
    <P>KT: ..no, I don't think, on that track, no. </P>
    
    <P>SI: let me see........I think so.... </P>
    
    <P>KT: Do I? Oh? Who? </P>
    
    <P>SI: Well who..who..who were the back-up singers on this album? </P>
    
    <P>KT: On that particular pratt...pratt (embarrassed chuckle) uh, track I
      don't there were any singers at all other than my brother Paddy doing one
      verse, and myself doing backing vocals... </P>
    
    <P> ... Kris and Peter and their friends hooted rather loudly at that, and
      explained that the term &quot;pratt&quot; was roughly equivilent to &quot;dipshit&quot;
      and how irritated Kate obviously had to have been to make a slip like
      that. </P>

      <BR> Subject: &quot;Prats&quot; 'n'stuff </P>
    
    <P>Oddly enough, the slang expression &quot;prat&quot; came up in
      conversation at Homeground central after the Con last November... We were
      watching an unedited tape of Kate's interview in NYC when HoL was just out
      (Chris &amp; Vickie were in the studio at the time, but I don't think they
      were responsible for getting the tape out). The woman interviewer was just
      astoundingly ill-informed and unimaginative, and we could watch Kate's
      patience growing thin as the hour (or more) ran on. At one point she
      misspoke, saying &quot;prat&quot; for I-forget-what, and the Brits in the
      room burst out laughing, explaining that &quot;prat&quot; is the female
      equivalent of calling someone a dick... </P>

    <P> There are undoubtedly some live recordings of Kate and the KT Bush
      Band's pub performances--in the possession of the Bush family, alas! IED
      has never heard even a hint that any such recordings have started making
      the underground rounds. But then, there was no real hope of getting any
      circa-'73 home demo recordings before 1988, either... </P>

    <P>&gt; I am not suggesting that KaTe would be sponsered by anyone, in
      fact, a banner over the stage at a KaTe concert would be pretty weird
      looking; nor do I think that KaTe is the type of artist that would &quot;go
      corporate&quot; anyway. But, I am curious to see what y'all think about
      this topic. </P>
    
    <P>The joke at Homeground when this question came up was, Cadbury
      chocolates... </P>

    <P>In Kent, actually. As a child she lived near Welling in a place called
      East Wickham Farm. She now lives closer to London near a place called
      Black Heath, or something like that. Peter Fitzgerald-Morris of Homeground
      drove a bunch of us to within a few hundred feet of her house once. </P>
