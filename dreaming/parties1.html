</P>
<P>Anyway, back to this party - we want the DEtails. Who started the Orgy? When
 did the police arrive? Who was the lady crumpled up on the toilet with needle
in  her arm? Were you able to scrape up Tim's droppings? Where's Doug's bong?
and  his Kate pubic hairs? Did anyone figure out how to remove the leather mask
from  Shelli's face? And did she tell why she changed the spelling of her name?
What's  with this &quot;i&quot; stuff, anyway, Shel? 
</P>
<P>By the WAY: While you decadent popstar groupies were potying, I was 
conducting IMPORTANT scientific tests with my Kate Bush Big Sky 12&quot; and
some  cool hardcore records. Well, I don't know if this means anything but I was
able to  fling the KT 12&quot; about 120 feet but the hardcore slabs wouldn't go
no further than  93 feet. Therefore, based on my scientific tests, Kate wins and
is cooler than  hardcore.

<P>Message(s) received and point taken, Fu-Sheng. Attention, all Western-based 
Love-Hounds: 
</P>
<P>As a point of honour, efforts must be made by the better half of the pack to
 match Nessus's recent demonstration of Bush Bashing. 
</P>
<P>Therefore, IED would like to give a little party for So-Cal Love-Hounds at
his  house in West Los Angeles, but first he would really like to know how many
L-Hs  such an occasion might attract. Doug, could you let him know if there are
three of us  or thirty out here? Greatly appreciated. 
</P>
<P>IED has a nice venue, but one drawback: since this sort of affair usually
centers  around a video screen, IED would like to set the date of the party
sometime after  August 29, by which time he will have a house to himself, and
will probably have  been able to procure a 20XBR. As for the party itself, video
will be the word of the  day. IED is equipped with Beta Hi-fi (and 8mm), but not
with VHS, so if anyone out  here can provide one for the evening, the atmosphere
will be much improved. Also,  who might want to help with the refreshments? And
of course, we'll have  show-and-tell time for collectors.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: KulTrivia 
</P>
<P>IED wants to emend his statement that the establishment of &quot;serious
Kate fan&quot;  status be a prerequisite for attending the West Coast premiere
of Love-Hounds' live  act. This was intolerant. Anyone prepared to watch
poor-quality bootleg videotape of  a British pop star for many hours, surrounded
by eccentric enthusiasts who study  her every living action, is welcome, whether
similarly disposed or not. 
</P>
<P>Concerning the party, the tentative date is Sunday, August 30th. This is
because  Saturday is the first opportunity IED will have to prepare the venue's
house for an  onslaught of fanatics, and September is perilously close to some
people's school  plans. If by chance the first weekend in September is NOT
inconvenient, however,  please let this be known. 
</P>
<P>By the way, anyone with what he thinks is obscure KT video or other
lionhearted  ephemera -- please bring it along. There are two items from which
the evening in  question could benefit: a VHS VCR (although one will be rented
if none is  volunteered for the evening), and a Laser video-disc player (stereo,
if such a  distinction is applicable in that medium), on which latter instrument
might be played  the two video discs (already in the host's possession), for the
sake of newcomers to  the KulT. 
</P>
<P>Is Allen (sp?) Watson III out there somewhere? IED, for one, read with 
fascination his exquisitely polished essay on chord progressions in Kate's music
(in  BT 10), from which much was learned, and much more curiosity aroused. 
</P>
<P>Speaking of polished and thought-provoking essays, thanks from IED to
Gregory  for his wise and convincing appeals for toleration. And he's right to
push for further  analysis of Christian (and other religious) referents in KT:
much is there, doubtless  not all of it conscious.

</P>
<P>hello love-hounds, on this monday afternoon of july 31st. 
</P>
<P>i'm feeling all sad and nostalgic now that katemas is past (and what a good 
one--thanks lovehounds, youknowwhoyouare). like when i was a kid, and felt 
depressed the day after christmas. sigh. (apologies to jon drukman for
expressing  these softer emotions, but this is usenet, not art. :-) ) 
</P>
<P>first of all, manymanythanks to everyone who attended the west-coast katemas
&amp;  contributed your own, unique brand of kate-fanism. and ofcourse i must
extend  special thanks to ied for making the journey, and bringing his amazing,
unbelievable,  incredible, collection of kate &quot;junk&quot;. you outdid
yourself, andy. it was as if a  clothesline laden with freshly washed clothes
fell onto the ground in a giant pile,  only to be instantly attacked by a litter
of puppies eagerly snatching brightly colored  bits of cloth, and happily
scattering them about the yard. and the nationwide  phonecalls, and synchronized
singing of &quot;happy birthday&quot; with the north-west  KonTigenT! and
talking to |&gt;oug on a real telephone, and getting the real story on the 
origin of his foofy &quot;|&gt;&quot;. (btw |&gt;oug, you musn't work so
hard--your presense is sorely  missed.) sigh. what a soujourn. 
</P>
<P>and for those of you who haven't had the pleasure of meeting ied's alter
ego,  andrew marvick, here's the scoop: he's really a very gentle, friendly,
generous, and  extremely amiable fellow. it's true, folks. sort of like the
ghandi of kate-dom--his  only aim is to serve: 
</P>
<P>you wanna' wear some of his kate buttons? 
</P>
<P>- certainly! 
</P>
<P>you want to put up all his posters? 
</P>
<P>- but of course! 
</P>
<P>they fall down repeatedly? 
</P>
<P>- no problem, really. 
</P>
<P>you want another interview tape before the next video? 
</P>
<P>- sounds good. 
</P>
<P>you want to see the vegetarian cookery interview in kate's backyard  again? 
</P>
<P>- oh yes, it's so cool! 
</P>
<P>he even READ US SHORT STORIES, WRITTEN BY KATE!!!!! need i say  more?? 
</P>
<P>so see you all next year, if not before (at the pre-concert gathering in
west l.a.).

<P>Date: Tue, 1 Aug 89 09:26:42 PDT <BR> From: ide!lofdahl@Sun.COM (Corey
Lofdahl) <BR> Subject: Katemas-California 89 
</P>
<P>I am full in the flush of Kate-ness after a truly enjoyable Katemas party.
Being a  Californian, I'd like to share the experience with Love-Hounds
everywhere: 
</P>
<P>&quot;KATEMAS-CALIFORNIA 89&quot; 
</P>
<P>First off, I must confess I felt a certain hesitation to attend the party.
I've been a  Love Hound for a while, but I was a little concerned about meeting
the people.  What if I didn't know enough about KT? What if I wasn't
sufficiently devotional?  What if these people were really weird? And my friends
and family certainly  weren't any help. &quot;What are you doing this weekend?&quot;,
they would inquisitively ask.  &quot;Going to celebrate Katemas in Santa Cruz
with people I've never met&quot;, I would  innocently answer. And then they'd
give me this look. 
</P>
<P>You know the look, like when you come into close contact with something 
incomprehensible and disturbing, like a Tim Moroney posting 8-]. I felt
compelled to  add &quot;Katemas is Kate Bush's birthday, she'll be 31&quot;. &quot;Is
she going to be there?&quot;  they'd ask, still giving me that look. I'd get my
own look, &quot;Do you know who Kate  Bush is?&quot; and receive, That Look.
Then I'd naively try to explain, I would try to  articulate, indeed, I would try
to convey the feeling that she's more than a singer,  more than a musician, more
than a writer. She explores subjects I've never  considered. She expands my
understanding of the human condition, of emotion, of  life itself. She, she ...

</P>
<P>&quot;Is she hot?&quot;, they would ask, interrupting. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hotter than Martha Quinn.&quot; &quot;Wow&quot; 
</P>
<P>But what can you do with these people? As Kurt Vonnugut said, &quot;Like so
many  Americans, they were trying to create a life that made sense from things
they found  in gift shops&quot;. From Max Headroom to Sylvester Stalone, from
Jackie Collins to  Harold Robbins, from Debbie Gibson to Tiffany, these people
have experienced  everything that American mass media has to offer. They've been
there and back. So  alone and vaguely discouraged, I set out across the
magnificently beautiful, yet  treacherously rugged Santa Cruz mountains to find
the meaning of Katemas. 45  minutes later, I was about to celebrate Katemas for
the first time, and change my  life. 
</P>
<P>The party was in a nice apartment complex in north Santa Cruz. In the
parking  lot I ran into Dan, who saw the ravens, who exhibited his Love
Hound-ness by  looking very lost. So together we trekked off to search for the
meaning of Katemas.  After several minutes of classic wondering around, we heard
the siren song of KT.  Upon entering Tracy's apartment, I felt instantly
comfortable. They had all the  traditional Katemas decorations up: KT posters
hung everywhere (and I mean  everywhere), Katemas compact disks, singles, books,
and clothing on the floor, and  Katemas carols (TWS) on the traditional Katemas
laser disk. Just as Kate knows that  details are important, Tracy does too. In
the bathroom there were KT posters for  looking, KT articles for reading, and a
cassette recorder with obsKuriTies I for  listening, so that even during those
few moments, her guests wouldn't have to miss a  single minute of Katemas
celebration. 
</P>
<P>Upon entering this veritable Katextravaganza, introductions were made, but I
 confess to being transfixed by the laser-disk images of Kate. After this
momentary  lapse of reason, I fell into conversation with the other Love-Hounds
who were  exploring Andrew's travelling Kate show on the floor like ... kids on
Katemas  morning. It's incredible, but Tom actually went to school with and
lived across the  hall from this girl that I knew briefly while living in New
York. Isn't that  incredible? Naturally and instantaneously we were like,
practically brothers, like.  Just about this time Larry arrived with his &quot;KTISGOD&quot;
California license plate.  VERY impressive, but Andrew had to hold IED back. It
was touch and go, but he  handled it and is now probably stronger because of it.

</P>
<P>To help get his mind off the whole license plate thing, Andrew put some KT 
interviews on the traditional Katemas Betamax. The shock was truly, well ... 
shocking. Where do these interviewers come from? Each and every one of these 
interviewers had serious, serious dain bramage, and it's easy to understand why
KT  might have a serious aversion to the good ole USofA. She was put on a TV
special  with Dr. Hook and the Travelling Drug Cabinet, and had to be
interviewed by all  seven of these drugstore cowboys. It was like a British
person's worst nightmare. I  can't remember exactly how the interview
progressed, but I can make something  up. 
</P>
<P>&quot;OOOOOO WEEEEEE, ain't Kate a cute one Billy-Bob&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'll say, she's a keeper Bobby-Jim&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That sure was a pretty song, where are you from anyway&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Eng..&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;OOOWWWW! Sum'n poked me! Let's change places Jonny-Joe&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sure-Nuf Joe-Billy&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oohh,Ungh. Much better now, Boy that smarts!&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's about all the time we have to chat, introduce the next song
Jimmy-Dave&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;The next song is duh ... duh ... Delicious&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate-Bob's pretty delicious too [canned laughter]&quot; 
</P>
<P>Then there was the Night-Flight interview, which you might suspect would be 
intelligent and well thought out, but you'd be wrong. The lady asking the
questions  had a tough time completing sentences and would ask things like: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Instruments. The Fairlight? Started with the Dreaming?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Music. What kind listen to you do? Music.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;So you're English?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Where's Kent?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Penetrating questions all. And after each answer she would, &quot;HHHmmmm&quot;,
like  a psychologist. But the highlight was when she asked Kate if she used
backup singers  for HoL, and Kate answered &quot;no&quot;. The interviewer
didn't believe her. She actually  went back, checked her notes, and then said, &quot;Oh
yes you did. It says so here&quot;.  Wouldn't Kate know? She was there after
all. It's HER album! Do You KNOW  WHO KATE IS! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!!! Kate was
cool though. 
</P>
<P>And then we read the People Magazine review of HoL, a true classic. It
should be  posted in it's entirety, but the caption underneath Kate's picture
was, &quot;Album not as  cheerful as picture&quot;. &quot;And the editors lost
their collective bladder control over the  new Jetts album, everyone agreed it
was real peppy ...&quot; 
</P>
<P>About this time the calls started arriving. The spirit of Katemas so swept
up  Love-Hounds from all across the country that in a joyous manifestation of
the Katian  spirit, inter-state communication simply had to be achieved. The
east-coasters called,  Andrew talked, and we all screamed &quot;HI!&quot; as
loud as we could. But the real  party-aminals are up in Seattle. These guys are
true maniacs, in every sense of the  word. They had 26 people at their party,
and everyone of them wanted to talk to  Andrew. Andrew got tired, and people
just started spontaneously talking to other  people. Hell, it was their bill.
The call culminated with everyone putting on their  traditional Katemas party
hats, singing Happy Birthday to Kate  *SIMULTANEOUSLY* in both Santa Cruz and
Seattle, and then blowing out the  traditional Katemas candles. It was a
beautiful experience. 
</P>
<P>Time to crank up the video-disk again, with Andrew treating us to his KT
video  insights which I found highly entertaining, especially, &quot;The Big Sky&quot;.
I'm not simply  interested in this particular video; I don't even particularly
want this video; I  outright need this video. Under Andrew's careful tutelage, I
even gained a new  appreciation for &quot;Experiment IV&quot; which until that
point had left me kind of cold. I  should mention at this point, that though
Andrew had more reasonable and rational  Kate knowledge, Tom, who I mentioned
previously, was a veritable fountain of  Katian ideas throughout the day. Though
currently studying Computer Science, an  activity that has destroyed many great
minds, given the proper training Tom could  easily reach the top echelons of
Kate-Bushology. We should all wish him well. 
</P>
<P>By now it was getting rather late, and we took a memorial picture to 
commemorate the event. It will soon be digitized, put in easy to retrieve bitmap
 format for almost effortless retrieval, and stored at the Night-Flight home
office in  New York City, which is in New York. Just call and ask for the dumb
interviewer  and simply say &quot;I want the Love-Hounds Katemas-California 89
bitmap&quot;, and she will  reply, &quot;Where's California? What's a
Love-Hound? What's Katemas? What's a  bitmap? When's lunch? HHmmmm ...&quot;. 
</P>
<P>At this point it was late and time to leave. My last memory is of a room
full of  faithful Kate celebrants (the kateful?), watching the Hammersmith
video. What did  I learn? Andrew has a lot of Kate stuff, and is a nice guy; I
don't know about IED. If  Andrew ever gives a Kate class, I want to take it.
It's also possible to spend 8+ hours  engrossed in KT and not get overwhelmed
because she's so talented, varied, and  interesting. She's also hotter than
Martha Quinn and Stevie Nicks put together.  Andrew and Tom opened entire new
vistas of symbolism for me. And finally, it's  possible to meet 15 new people
and have a great time because KT fans just happen  to be fabulous. Merry
Katemas. 
</P>
<P>I'd like to thank Tracy for hosting and feeding us, 
</P>
<P>Larry for bringing the KTISGOD license plate, 
</P>
<P>Dave for bringing the KT laser discs and setup, 
</P>
<P>Andrew for bringing amazing amounts of Kate paraphernalia, 
</P>
<P>Tom for his insightful and exuberant analyses, 
</P>
<P>and everybody else for being there.

<BR> Subject: Katemas party report 
</P>
<P>The northwest Katemas party was a whole lot of fun. To my knowledge it was 
the largest Katemas party in North America. We had about 26 people, at the Kate 
House near the Western Washington University campus in Bellingham (near the 
Canadian border). The guests were mostly WWU Kate Bush Club members, and  there
were three of us from Microsoft and someone else from Seattle. We didn't  have
any well known guests like Andrew Marvick, who went to Tracy Roberts's  Santa
Cruz (California) party, or Doug Alan, who went to the east coast party. We  did
however have a woman who dressed up as Kate in the ``Them Heavy People''  video,
and she had a wonderful costume. 
</P>
<P>The party started around 3 p.m., though the only ones there that early were
the  permanant residents of the Kate House, and the three of us from Microsoft.
The  barbeque fire didn't start well, even though someone tried to use gasoline
to light it.  Since most of us wanted an unleaded dinner, and some of us dumped
the first batch  of coals while someone went to buy less toxic starter fluid.
Even though Kate is a  vegetarian, we didn't try to do a vegetarian barbeque. We
also had no smokers  (Kate's vice), which was nice. Of course, we had Kate music
playing loudly and  constantly. 
</P>
<P>After the meal, the videos were started. We saw Kate Bush Live at the 
Hammersmith Odeon, The Whole Story, and a number of more rare videos. Of  course
there was also a lot of ordinary pleasant party conversation, and special Kate 
party conversation. Another item of interest was a copy of the latest
Homeground,  that my girlfriend Kari Haug bought for me when she was in London.

</P>
<P>Another thing we did was to phone the other two known Katemas parties. First
 we called the Santa Cruz party, and passed the phone around between people who 
wanted to say hellos to each other. We also sang Happy Birthday to Kate, 
surprisingly well synchronized, considering most people couldn't hear the
singers at  the other party. We also called Doug Alan, since the phone idea came
up after the  east coast party had ended. 
</P>
<P>Those of us from Seattle had to hit the road to return, so I don't know what
 happened after we left. We had a nice return trip. Toward the end of the
evening,  the topic of another Kate party next year came up. It was very
popular, so we will  very likely do something similar again.

</P>
<P>Well, here's The Whole Story, as it were: 
</P>
<P>I sat up for absolutely HOURS on Friday night slaving over a hot tape deck 
putting together an incredible collage of percussion and Kate samples. I got
together  with Joe on Saturday, and we brought the tape to Larry DeLuca, who
helped us add  some synth chords to flesh it out. Then I showed up REAL early at
Joe's place on  Sunday, and we hooked up about 600 digital sound effect boxes in
line with Joe's  guitar, a microphone into which I would sing, and my bass. We
rehearsed this a  whole bunch (at least twice I think) and then sat down to
watch tons of great Kate  vids courtesy of IED (thanks Andrew, we owe you!!).
So, what's the capper? Hardly  anyone shows up to this shindig!! Last year (and
the year before) we had a great  turnout, but where was everybody this year, eh?

</P>
<P>So anyways, the long and the short is, the vital audience participation
ingredient is  sorely missing, but if you really really want it, I can send you

regular RutH loop, plus me  singing the lyrics through a vocoder which pushes my
voice up into the chipmunk  range, and a couple of gratuitous samples on top.

</P>
<P>Special message to Corey Lofdahl: IED (that's right, even IED) hasn't
laughed so  much in some time. Ultra-good letter, and spot on about everything.
IED shared all  the same feelings at the party, but could never have expressed
them as well as you  did. IED strongly urges you to allow him to print out your
letter and send it to Peter  at Homeground immediately. Even if they don't
publish it, they're sure to get a lot  of pleasure from it. (Thanks for all your
kind words re this &quot;Marvick&quot; character, too,  though that's not why
IED liked your piece.) 
</P>
<P>Also, thanks to Steve S. for his summary of the Washington party, which IED 
would like to send along to Peter as well. OK?

</P>
<P>The purpose of this message is just to thank Joe Turner for being a gracious
host  for The Fourth Annual Boston Love-Hounds Katemas Party. The turnout was
much  smaller this year than in previous years -- only eight die-hard fans
attended, but  everyone (or at least me) had a great time nonetheless. We
watched some rare Kate  Bush videos that just arrived in the mail. No one knows
where they came from, or  what the legal status of them is, but we asked no
questions. Of particular interest  were the unedited Night Flight interview (by
a bunch of real bozos, about an hour of  Canadian TV interviews, and &quot;Experiment
IV&quot; as performed on the Wogan show.  Also, thanks to Jon Drukman, we lost
ourselves in the visual psychedelia of the  Severed Heads. 
</P>
<P>Then Jon Drukman and Joe Turner performed a stunning rendition of &quot;Running
 Up That Hill&quot; as it might have been performed by The Residents. Larry
DeLuca did  a moving performance of &quot;Under The Ivy&quot; alone at the
piano. 
</P>
<P>We then all went out (minus Larry, who had to leave) to The Hard Rock Cafe
to  celebrate Katemas with a bit of food. On return, we temporarily joined the 
California celebration via the miracle of modern telecomunication systems.
Later, at  home, I also temporarily joined the Washington celebration. 
</P>
<P>All in all, at the three simulataneous Katemas celebrations, we must have
had the  best Katemas show of support yet. 
</P>
<P>July will be magic again,

technology 
</P>
<P>With the advent of digital sampling technology, all this stuff is now a
piece of  cake, and you can buy cheap boxes to do it. I have a cartridge for my
computer  which when coupled with appropriate software can transform the pitch
of any  incoming signal. If you put a digeridu into it playing only one note
(since that's all  they can play) and then played a melody on a MIDI keyboard,
it would 'play' the  melody with a digeridu sound. 
</P>
<P>I used this effect for the live version of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;
which was done  at the Katemas party in July. I used it as basically a digital
version of the Chipmunks  vocal effect. It has the advantage that you can sing
in your normal voice at normal  speed and you still come out sounding like a
weasel on helium, whereas the  Chipmunks stuff was all done by speeding up the
tape and involved speaking...  really... slowly... so that the pacing came out
right when the tape was played back  fast. 
</P>
<P>All clear?

<BR> Subject: Kate Bash In Vermont 
</P>
<P>*** THE SENSUAL BASH IN VERMONT *** 
</P>
<P>Sunday mornings do not agree with me. The bloodstains on my toothbrush take 
on a particularly sinister aspect, and breakfast always tastes like cardboard.
Plus, the  house looks like a bomb has fallen on it. Yes, we Sunderland-ites
party hard.  Anyway, I was contemplating crawling back into bed and calling
Julian with some  bogus story of my car having been carted off by a load of
savage pygmies or  something, but I decided that a KT party might be just the
thing to shake those  Sunday cobwebs away. So, I loaded up the Drukmobile,
popped in a Skinny Puppy  cassette and started out on a hell of a trip. 
</P>
<P>Eventually, I arrived, and found Julian and Jenn Turney playing Scrabble and
 cursing Joe Turner and |&gt;oug Alan for not even having left yet. While Julian
debated  the relative merits of playing &quot;XAZYJQUAT&quot; on a triple word
score and Jenn  debated the relative merits of hitting Julian over the head with
a log, I pondered the  cover of The Sensual World, revealed in all it's vinyl 12&quot;
glory (thanks to Jenn  Turney for bringing the actual album, since Julian only
had the CD.) I thought I had  found the KT symbol, but Julian remained
unconvinced. |&gt;oug, on the other hand,  announced that I was completely and
utterly right. Personally, I'm still skeptical, but  |&gt;oug's enthusiasm can
be overwhelming sometimes. But I anticipate myself. 
</P>
<P>Andrew Marvick phoned, but since |&gt;oug and Joe were still on the road, we
told  him to phone back later. 
</P>
<P>Eventually, those miscreants from Boston arrived, and we berated them
soundly  for being bogey bums. Introductions were given, I pointed out the &quot;KT&quot;
logo to |&gt;oug  who sung praises to the heavens, and then |&gt;oug and I
settled down to our usual  party behavior: arguing about &quot;Deeper
Understanding.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Reason prevailed of course, and we left for a place called &quot;Molly's&quot;
to have  brunch, but such was the tardiness of the other two that we arrived at
3:10 PM,  rather later than when brunch was served. Not to worry: the lunch was
delicious  nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>Arriving back at Julian's flat, Julian and Jenn prepared high tea for us:
hot  mulled cider and real seedcake! Let me tell you all that I now understand
all the  &quot;sensual&quot; implications of seedcake. Anybody who wants to &quot;take
a kiss of it&quot; back  from my mouth, or would like me to do same to them,
please send applications to  this email address. Make sure you have a loaf handy
for your next big date, guys.  This is great stuff! 
</P>
<P>While devouring these mouth watering scrummies, Andrew Marvick called again 
and we all had a go chatting with him. A plea: folks, give the poor guy a break
and  let him have a chance to contemplate the magic of &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
in peace for  a day or two! He would never tell you all to &quot;bug off&quot;
because he's such a swell guy,  but we're all being horribly unfair to him
(although I'm sure he's loving every  minute of it.) 
</P>
<P>The rest of the afternoon was spent discussing Kate, Michael Nyman, Tom 
Philips, the latest issue of Homeground, the secret messages in Watching You 
Without Me, acid house, and tea. By the way |&gt;oug, how did you like the
lapsang  souchong? We wanted to get out Julian's telescope and spend a November
Night,  looking up into the sky (the big sky?) but the clouds were out in force,
and a  cloudbuster was nowhere to be had! 
</P>
<P>After a cup of tea, the march of time began to catch up with us, and most of
us  had a long drive to look forward to (particularly poor Jenn!), so we made
our  farewells. 
</P>
<P>The Drukmobile purred like a kitten all the way home and once I was firmly 
installed in my lair, I contemplated the Tom Philips pages Julian had bestowed
on  me (Thanks!) and tried to locate a decent seedcake recipe in our cookbooks.
Then I  passed out. A great day, to be sure!

the  &quot;original&quot; James Joyce lyrics to the song &quot;The Sensual World&quot;

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: MisK. 
</P>
<P> First, IED would like to thank everyone who attended his Katemas Eve's Eve 
Bush Bash last Saturday, and for making it what seemed, to IED, at least, a
rollicking  success. In all, between 32 and 34 people were present. More
tellingly, of those, about  twenty-five remained in attendance for a good five
or six hours--most of them  without so much as letting an eye or ear stray from
the TV sets. Those with whom  IED was able to chat for an odd moment here and
there throughout the course of  the evening proved to be very charming and
interesting conversationalists, and IED,  for one, had a very fun time. In all,
it lasted from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. 
</P>
<P>IED would especially like to thank Ed Suranyi, who helped IED out in many
little  ways during the course of the evening. Also thanks to Larry Hernandez
(L-H),  whose presence reminded IED that, indeed, she really is. 
</P>
<P>Also a big thank you to Tracy for her morale-boosting presence--and to all 
others who traveled from great distances just to meet up with other Kate Bush
fans.  A splendid time was had, IED hopes, by all. 
</P>
<P>IED understands why Jon Drukman couldn't make it (too bad, it would have 
been fun for IED and Drukman to meet in the flesh at last), but Dave Hsu, what 
happened to you? And what about Gabriella Carlson, who had all the big plans for
a  KT-fan group trip to Disneyland the next day? Ah, well, IED was too pooped to
go  anywhere Sunday anyway... 
</P>
<P>IED will keep everyone's addresses, and next summer perhaps the Southern and
 Northern Californians can link up with the Washingtonian KonTingent, to
organize  the first West Coast Kate Bush Convention...? 
</P>
<P>Speaking of Washington--what happened to you guys? IED called both the 
telephone numbers given in your posting, but no-one answered either phone, and 
there was no answering machine to take our message. We had thirty people 
crammed into a hot little room ready to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in
unison with you  Washingtonians, all to no avail. And Vickie tells IED she had
the same disappointing  experience when she tried to call you people from her
Chicago party. What gives? 
</P>
<P>IED enjoyed meeting a great number of Kate Bush fans, and feels that he made
a  few new friends. In particular a very interesting, all too short chat with
British  Love-Hound Derek Langsford will be remembered with pleasure. Thanks to 
everyone for coming, and he hopes you all got enough noodles and brownies...

<BR> Subject: KateMas Talk... from Linkoping, Sweden 
</P>
<P>KateMas Eve and KateMas Day meetings in Linkoping, Sweden 
</P>
<P>Since we first listened to Kate Bush's music we knew it was special. Yes, we
 discovered her together in 1984. But it took us some time to realize she was
good all  the way. When people ask us why we're so &quot;fanatical&quot; about
Kate, we usually reply:  she is the only --- the only --- artist both of us love
from the beginning to the end;  alpha and omega. We both listen to Prince, but
he has created awful pieces as well  as good ones. Andreas sometimes listens to
Depeche Mode, which Carina doesn't  like too much. Sometimes Carina finds
Sisters of Mercy enjoyable, while Andreas  seldom do. Kate Bush is the only one
we both love everything by, all the time, and  together! 
</P>
<P>But, we digress. 
</P>
<P>It was not until late 1987 we understood there was a thingy called Kate
fandom.  We already knew science fiction fandom, but this was new to us. Since
then we have  slowly assimilated all the KTlore available, and this year we felt
ready to host a  KateMas, which at the same time would be our first one. 
</P>
<P>Our first action was to place the date in the local sf club's calender. By
doing this  in the early spring we both got some attandees, and managed to
convert a few  non-KTists. We also posted an invitation to the net (but, no one
from outside  Linkoping came... strange!). To those who asked we told them we'd
start  somewhere between 1800 and 1900 on the 29th, so they all came then. All
in all we  were seven fans, apart from ourselves there was Tommy Persson,
Lennart Staflin,  Lars Johansson, Per Westling, and Roger Klein (who
unfortunately had to go earlier,  since he at the moment is an army dreamer). 
</P>
<P>Carina worked all afternoon to create a special Katie Kake. Of course it was
in  the form of the KT symbol we all love. Apart from being wonderful to look at
(we  have it captured in black-and-white for the future to see), it tasted
wonderful!  Meanwhile we listened to Katie on CD and vinyl, watched her
appearance on  Saturday Night Live, and discussed. Andreas told everyone about
the wonderful  news about Kate Bush Con and about the CD Box. Lennart said he
perhaps needed  to get a CD player in time for Christmas, then... All the time
Katie watched us. You  see, we had on the day before bought a frame for the
beautiful b/w photo you get as  a member of the Kate Bush Club, and we placed it
so that she could see all the  participants and what we did. We did not, though,
try to feed the glass encased face  of Ms. Bush with birThday Kake... 
</P>
<P>The festivities ended somewhere around 2300, and the attendees walked home. 
But we didn't end the activities there! No, when the time seemed ripe, we picked
 up a copy of C'n'V's KateMas invitation, checked out their telephone number,
and  phoned them! Lo and behold! A feminine voice answered, and Andreas asked
her if  there were a KateMas party going on over there. It was... we had the
right number!  Ms. Mapes got Chris to the phone, and he told us we just caught
them watching the  famous Infant Kiss video! Lucky you NTSC people... Then we
spoke a little, as  coherent you can via a trans-Atlantic cable (isn't there a
strange cutting sensation  when calling the other side? Or is it just the
Swedish telephone monopoly...). After  wishing each other a happy KateMas, we
closed the connexion. For this time. We  went to bed, on KateMas Day, happy in
spirit and soul! 
</P>
<P>In our invitation we wrote that we would celebrate the 30th, too. That is
the real  birThday, right? But, there was a minimum of interest from the
participants on the  20th to come on the 30th as well. Even when we told them
there would be bubbly  wine. Anyway, we didn't let them put us in a bad mood on
such a day! During the  day we went to another of the Swedish monopolies:
Systembolaget (where you get  bubbly wine, and other alchoholic stuff), where we
found a nice bottle white bubbly  wine called Cordoniu. Later that evening we
gave Kate a toast, and swept the  contents of the bottle. 
</P>
<P>Our first KateMas has passed, and we hope we'll attend or host many more! 
</P>
<P>This electronic edition of the report doesn't include photos from the event.
The  pictures are of the Kake and of the attending KTians. If you're very keen
on seeing  the shots, please drop up a line, and we'll see what we can manage
(KTMas photos  at the Gaffa archives???).

<BR> Subject: A Love-Hound at Wuthering Hike 
</P>
<P>&quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; 
</P>
<P>We didn't really need to dream of sheep; they were very much in evidence at 
Top Withins, where I and other Katefans joined the Homeground team for 
Wuthering Hike III (The Revenge), on Saturday 29th October. 
</P>
<P>For those of you who may be confused, Top Withins is the place that is
commonly  held to be the house that Emily Bronte used to model Wuthering
Heights, the  Earnshaw family home in the book of the same name. Sadly, it is a
ruin now, with  just parts of the external walls intact. Still, every few years
the Homeground team  arrange a get-together of fans, to meet there. This was the
third time they had done  it. I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet
other fans, so I decided to go. It  would also be a chance to visit Haworth
itself, and see the Bronte Parsonage  Museum And other sites. My mum, who is not
a Katefan as such (although she could  hold her own in a conversation) but is a
Bronte fan, wanted to come along too. This  was useful, as she could navigate
for me ... 
</P>
<P>We set off and two and a half hours later, with only minor mishaps, we
arrived in  Haworth. After a bit of hunting, we found a place to park the car,
near the footpath  to Top Withins, and started the two mile walk across the
moors. The weather was  ... traditional is the best word, I suppose. It was
rather cold, but not too bad, and the  rain held off (mostly). The walk was
fairly easy. We didn't see too many people  around, and I was beginning to get a
little worried until I saw a rather untidy KT  symbol scratched on the path. I
knew then I was on the right track. 
</P>
<P>Eventually, we arrived at Top Withins itself, after about 40 minutes of
walking.  There were quite a few people there, but I did not know any of them
personally. Of  course, Peter and Krys Morris were there, and I knew them by
sight, and was glad  to meet them properly. Sharon and Debbie were there too, I
think, but Dave could  not make it because he was frantically organising the
Convention. Apparently, the  others are leaving him to it, because he is a very
good organiser. 
</P>
<P>Krys and Peter tried to get a card in Haworth to send to Kate, which
everyone  could sign. Unfortunately, there weren't any good cards, so they just
had a piece of  paper. This would then be put inside a good card, when they
found one. Of course,  people wrote well-wishing messages. One person wrote &quot;A
few minutes ago, a  sheep put its head on my shoulder&quot;. I was fairly
unimaginative, I'm afraid. I simply  wrote, &quot;My hands are frozen, so I
can't say much. Lots of Love, Stephen&quot;. I saw quite  a few similar
messages. 
</P>
<P>Of course, there was lots of talk about the Convention. Peter said that she
will be  there, of course, but doesn't know what she is going to do. In fact, he
said that even  Kate herself doesn't know what she will be doing, and probably
won't until she  arrives on the stage. Be prepared for anything! 
</P>
<P>Anyway, I wanted to look around Haworth before I closed, so I had to go
early. I  asked Peter if he wanted me to pass anything on to Love-Hounds. He
said to say  &quot;Hi!&quot; to everyone, and could anyone who is going to the
Convention please send their  ticket money as soon as possible - they are on a
very tight schedule. 
</P>
<P>So I said goodbye to Peter and Krys and everyone else, and started back for 
Haworth. We looked around the Parsonage Museum (fascinating!) and browsed 
around the town itself. Then, tired but very satisfied with the day, we went
home.

</P>
<P>Well, I was not disappointed that I went to the convention today. It was
quite  small, it was reported that attendence was 60 people. BUT they were all
KaTe fans!!!  I was told the 1st convention in Winnipeg only drew 100 people. 
</P>
<P>Now I want to know where the rest of the Love Hounds were today that they 
were not in attendence? Seriously I wasn't expecting anyone from a great
distance  to be there, but one person was in from Minnesota. Another drove up
from  Columbus, OH (Hi Richard!). Hey Ryan what's your excuse for not being
there, you  flew all the way to London for the last one and you couldn't drive
accross town for  this one? 
</P>
<P>The event was sponsored by The American Association of Them Heavy People 
(an unofficial KaTe fan club (their statement) for the US) and by CD Connection
of  Northeast Ohio. The proprietor (Scott Sheppard) and his friend Cappy both
share  the honor of having been to all the previous KaTe conventions: Winnipeg,
London  '85 and London '90. I even spotted my picture in his convention photos.
I passed my  collection of photos from the convention for people to see,
including the group  photos of the Love Hounds. A few of them have net access
and have downloaded all  of our postings and have passed them around. Andrew if
I heard Cappy correctly he  knows you. Cappy brought his collection of KaTe
memorabilia for everyone to look  at. Scott had for sale a huge assortment of
albums and posters. Throughout the day  videos were shown almost continously.

</P>
<P>The Kon closed with the reading of personal greetings from Peter Gabriel,
David  Gilmour and Kate. Evidently, numerous unanswered registered letters to
the Kate  Bush Club finally resulted in a phone call from Kate herself. Do any
of you  Cleveland Love-Hounds happen to have the text of the message available?

</P>
<P>It was great meeting Phil, Scott, Cappy, Jeff and all the other folks up
there. We  hope to do it again sometime. Maybe in Columbus! :-)

<P>The latest from our incommunicado love-hound in Chicago, Vickie, is that she
 and Chris suspect that Kate's message at the Ohio con was a dub of her message
at  the Canadian BreakThrough con several years back.

<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P>In re: The &quot;Kate Message&quot; played at the convention. Did it sound
any thing like  this? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hello. This is Kate Bush.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Firstly, I think I should say that I am really honoured indeed that
this event is  taking place here to-night. I believe that some of you have come
a long way, too, and  that means a lot to me. I hope that none of you will feel
that you journey's been  wasted.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm talking to you from my studio and we've just started recording the
next  album. It's due to be released in the autumn and I'll be working
throughout the  summer to get it finished. It's almost to talk about music
before it's been recorded  properly, but I could say that this album is
different again from the last one. Perhaps  it's more positive, but that's for
all of you to say really when you hear it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Several of the musicians featured on the last album will be playing on
this one  and we're recording out in the country so we'll have a good atmosphere
- relaxed.  When we know the actual release date I'll obviously let you know.&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;And thank-you, again. Good-bye.&quot; 
</P>
<P> This message was sent by Kate to the 1984 Canadian Bush-Con. I edited out
the  references to Dale Sommerville. I'd hope that they didn't play this
message, trying  to give the impression that Kate sent it to them. I fear that
this may be the case. A  couple of undisputable facts about Kate: 
</P>
<P>She doesn't respond to people trying to commercialize her. 
</P>
<P>She doesn't usually respond when she is working on an album. 
</P>
<P>As I said, I hope I'm wrong. 
</P>

</P>
<P>&gt; Finally, perhaps IED should be slower to anger when hearing about fans 
bothering Kate for endorsements. ...
</P>
<P>This may be a misunderstanding caused by my own poor recollection and 
reporting of what I was told at the convention. It was, after all, a busy day.
Hopefully  I've got it right now. 
</P>
<P>In fact nobody at AATHP called about the convention greeting, their request
was  sent in writing to The Kate Bush Club. 
</P>
<P>They sent several letters with no response from The KBC. Before long
responses  started arriving from other artists. Not wanting Kate to look bad
they tried making  contact through a friend at Columbia. This friend made the
contact with Novercia  and thus the message was delivered (on paper, not on tape
as some have seemed to  assume).

Williams) <BR> Subject: Misc. 
</P>
<P>Chris here, bits and pieces.... 
</P>
<P>Andrew B Marvick asked: 
</P>
<P>&gt; Btw, was Chris Williams ever able to figure out whether the message
which  was said to have come from Kate for the AATHP convention was indeed
derived  from the Winnipeg Con's taped message? 
</P>
<P>Well to perfectly frank, no one who attended this &quot;con&quot; and heard
or saw the  message has replied to my posting of the Winnipeg message by either
post or  e-mail. I fear, based on the silence, that my supposition was correct,
and that Kate  never replied to these people. I will be very happy if I am
wrong, as we remember  meeting Scott Shepard in Winnipeg and purchasing many
rare and wonderful things  from him. It pains me to ascribe ill motives to him
and Cappy. I will gladly retract  any of my statements as soon as I see a xerox
of Kate's statement. I haven't seen  anything that was indisputably from Kate
that wasn't on her &quot;Kate Bush&quot; stationary  in her own inimitable
handwriting.
