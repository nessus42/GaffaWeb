GMT <BR> Subject: Re: KATE'S NEW ALBUM (Spoilers, long) 
</P>
<P>OK, now I have heard it, and will comment below. If you wish the album to 
remain a mystery, please stop reading this message. 
</P>
<P>This album improves with repeated listenings, due to (1) I know this is all
there  is, so I better like it; (2) I can understand more of the words; or (3)
the novelty has  worn off and now I can listen to the record instead of the
newness. With this said, I  can describe it generally as not as good as HoL,
sort of like &quot;Experiment IV: The  Album.&quot; Many of the songs sound as
if they were offered by &quot;singer-songwriter&quot;  Kate, not &quot;musical
artist&quot; Kate. There are 3 good reasons to buy it, however: (1) Kate,  (2)
Trio Bulgarka, and (3) Mick Karn. 
</P>
<P>Legend: 
</P>
<P>***** - Great by any standard 
</P>
<P>**** - A pretty good Kate song 
</P>
<P>*** - Straightforward, for Kate 
</P>
<P>** - Must be by someone 
</P>
<P>* - other than Kate :-) 
</P>
<P>Side 1: 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World - Dominant Irish instruments, but playing an eastern sort
of  scale. Lyrics are hard to make out at first, but after more listening...
well...whew!  ***** 
</P>
<P>Love And Anger - The rhythm reminds me of &quot;Big Sky&quot;, percussion
oriented.  &quot;Yeah!&quot; ***1/2 
</P>
<P>The Fog - Strings borrowed from ExIV, pipes, seagulls, acoustically oriented
 ballad, turns out quite nice, actually. ***** 
</P>
<P>Reaching Out - Moves from a piano ballad to a pretty mainstream sounding
piece.  Commercial. Add 1/2* if you recognize and appreciate the Bulgarian
influence on  her vocal at the very end of the song. *** 
</P>
<P>Heads We're Dancing - Strongly rhythmic, odd, has the amazing Mick Karn on 
bass (no liner notes, but it HAS to be him!). Kate has been taking singing
lessons  from Tiny Tim :-). Add 1/2* if you like Mick Karn. ***1/2 
</P>
<P>Side 2: 
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding - Mick on bass, Trio Bulgarka here. Theme
(superficially):  computer. **** (If you think this is too high, remember I love
the hell out of Mick  Karn's bass playing and Bulgarian choir vocals. If you
think it's too low, give me a  few days. :-) 
</P>
<P>Between A Man &amp; A Woman - Hard to describe, not very memorable. ***1/2 
</P>
<P>Never Be Mine - Pipes, Del on bass, Trio Bulgarka, interesting theme. **** 
</P>
<P>Rocket's Tail - Trio Bulgarka with a vengeance! If you like Bulgarian
choirs, this  one's for you. First half is a capella, then suddenly becomes Pink
Floyd (not in a bad  way. Mick on bass. ***** 
</P>
<P>This Woman's Work - Identical to soundtrack, except for lack of background 
voices just before she starts the verse. You've heard it. ***** 
</P>
<P>Walk Straight Down The Middle - Not sure if this is an extra B-side, since
the  previous song would have been a good album closer. Odd, noises, strange,
not  incredibly appealing. ***1/2 
</P>
<P>Anyway, there it is, in brief. Obviously this based on just a few times of
listening  to it. Any of the songs I seemed to like less could therefore have a
leeway of 1/2*  quite easily. Also, this is all a matter of taste anyway. Since
I don't have lyrics, I  can't report about the actual song content. One way to
describe it: you remember  how you felt when you got HoL home and sat down and
played it all the way  through? Well, this isn't like that; you will be able to
speak afterwards (and perhaps  during). Oh, yes, all numbers above are relative
to Kate (not the general public,  otherwise they'd all be *****). Enjoy.

</P>
<P>IED has just finished speaking with Vickie, of Kansas City. She is the dj of
the  KC, MO radio programme called &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; (Saturday
nights, 10-12 p.m.),  and next week she will give several tracks from Kate's new
album their U.S.  (world?) premieres, so all Love-Hounds in the KC, MO area are
advised to tune in  Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>But that's not the warning! The warning comes from Vickie, who has been 
listening to the new album all afternoon. She alerts all Love-Hounds that one
song  on the album, called Deeper Understanding, is about USING THE COMPUTER
!!!! 
</P>
<P>Apparently you can even hear her booting up! So everyone watch out! Kate is 
probably listening in!!! HI, KATE! WE'RE ON TO YOU NOW!!! 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick 
</P>
<P>Other descriptions of the new album: the track that was heard very briefly
and  in a rough version on the Rhythms of the World programme last March in the
UK is  the song called Rocket's Tail, and it is described as extremely &quot;weird&quot;,
and &quot;hard for  even the most diehard Kate fans to adjust to.&quot; IED
doesn't quite know what was  meant by that. In all, three of the tracks feature
the Trio Bulgarka on backing  vocals.

<P>From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt; <BR> Subject: Some thoughts
on a sensual world <BR> Date: Thu, 12 Oct 89 16:13:55 EDT 
</P>
<P>I've had *The Sensual World* LP for a little while now and I figure that
I've  digested it enough to be able to say a few words about it. I'll also might
say a few  word about my interpretation of some of the songs. (When I use the
word &quot;Kate&quot; in  describing the plot of a song, let it be understood
that I refer to the protaganist of  the songm not the real-life Kate, since each
particular song may or may not be  autobiographical.) 
</P>
<P>I think the new album is wonderful (of course!). However, I'd still burn all
of my  albums (including all of Kate's other albums), rather than lose *The
Dreaming*.  This album is included. I also don't like it quite as much as
*Hounds of Love*. It has  some incredible material on it, but unlike *Hounds of
Love* it has a couple of tunes I  don't really care for. Also, there is nothing
on *The Sensual World* that hits me  over the head with a two-by-four, the way
that &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; or &quot;Jig of Life&quot;  does on &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I have a friend, Laura, who LOVED *The Dreaming*. She didn't like *Hounds of
 Love* as much, but she LOVES the new album. She says that her favorite song on 
*Hounds* is &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; (my least favorite song on the
album), and  that most of the new album reminds her of this song. It doesn't
sound that way to  me, though, or I probably wouldn't like the new album too
much. 
</P>
<P>The songs.... 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World -- when I first heard this song, it sounded a bit too
etherial  for my tastes, though I did really appreciate the Indian-sounding
music being played  on Irish instruments. After a while, this songs really
starts getting under your skin,  however, and sets in deep roots. We all know
what it is about by now, so I won't say  anymore about it. 
</P>
<P>Love and Anger -- I don't like this song too much. It's okay, but Kate can
do  much better. The rhythm sounds like it was ripped off from &quot;The Big Sky&quot;
and the  music doesn't strike me particularly. I don't hear many risks in this
song. The  background vocals are nice and Kate does some nice things with her
voice. I haven't  spent too much time contemplating the meaning of this song
because the music  doesn't drag me in. Jon's musings on the song seem apt to me.

</P>
<P>The Fog -- An incredible song. Songs like these are why I worship Kate Bush
and  this one song is worth an least ten albums by almost anyone else. The most
sensual  and moody song ever written. It's deep and dark. Get the idea? The
lyrics are  clearly about being scared of love -- a common theme of Kate's, but
not one that can  be said too much about. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This love of yours was big enough to be frightened of. <BR> It's deep
and dark like the water was, <BR> the day I learned to swim.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Does this give us any insight into &quot;I'll be two steps on the water&quot;?

</P>
<P>Reaching Out -- I can't stand this song. To me, it sounds cliched and
overdone. It  sounds to me like a bad Barbara Streisand movie soundtrack song.
IED says I am  pathetic for thinking so, but the majority of the people I have
talked to think this  song sucks. Laura, who if you will remember, LOVES the
album, says that this song  is &quot;pathetic&quot;. My girlfriend made me turn
off the tape deck when this song came on.  Joe Turner says it sounds like a bad
Journey song --even more so than &quot;Not This  Time&quot;. Larry Deluca said
that it was indeed cliched, but that it works incredibly well  anyway. The
lyrics are okay. They are about how we strive to extend beyond  ourselves by
wanting to explore the universe and other people. 
</P>
<P>Heads We're Dancing -- This song is pretty darned good. But for Kate it's 
nothing special. Those who have been following the discussion know that it's
about  some evil bastard who flips a coin. If it comes up heads, he dances with
the woman.  The matter of what happens if it comes up tails is still in the air.
Some people  believe the bad dude is Hitler. [Errata: now that we have the
official lyrics and  Kate's statements about the song, we know the dude *is*
Hitler.] 
</P>
<P>Side two. Here's where the album gets unrelentingly awesome. 
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding -- A beautiful and sad song. This is the first song
where  Kate's exquisite weaving of Bulgarian folk music with her own appears.
The song  seems to be about someone who is lonely and sad. They acquire some
sort of  marvelous computer program that is intelligent and becomes a good
friend. At the  end, we hear a voice that says &quot;I hate to leave you&quot;.
I think that this indicates that  the program has decided that Kate no longer
needs the program as a crutch and can  stand on her own feet now, and so the
program must leave. Another possibility is  that Kate has grown up and has
decided she no longer needs the program as a  crutch. Jon Drunkbrain says that
it indicates that Kate has been forcibly separated  from the computer by her
evil, nonunderstanding family. I disagree. Kate is not this  morbid. 
</P>
<P>The story of this song reminds me of &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; or &quot;Peter
Pan&quot;,  where a magical being helps children who have sad childhoods, but
must eventually  watch them grow up and leave them. 
</P>
<P>Between a Man and a Woman -- Even better than the previous song. One of the 
very few songs where Kate is really mad at someone in particular and lets it
show.  Yes, indeed, a very unusual and powerful song for Kate. She's beautiful
when she's  angry! The story is fairly clear. Someone is screwing up Kate's love
life by taking  sides and offering unwanted advice. This song is Kate telling
that person off. &quot;Let the  pendulum swing between a man and a woman.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Never Be Mine -- Incredible. Even better than the previous song. More
haunting  stuff with Trio Bulgarka -- another very sad song. Before I read the
official lyrics to  this song, I thought that Kate was having a vision of
herself in an alternate world,  living a different life, and wishing it was
really hers. After seeing the official lyrics,  it seems more like Kate has had
a romantic affair with someone who leads a much  different life than hers. The
idea is still very similar. As she thinks of him, she longs  for life she could
have led with him -- a different life. But she knows that this life is  not the
one for which she is fated and she knows that she can't run off with this  man.

</P>
<P>Rocket's Tail -- Quite bizarre and delicious! The wildest combination of
rock and  Bulgarian folk music possible. It starts off a capella with Trio
Bulgarka doing a  traditional sounding Bulgarian piece, but Kate impossibly is
adding a fourth, more  Western melody line. Just amazing. Then David Gilmour and
the band come in and  it turns into a completely out-in-space Bulgarian Pink
Floyd on X song! 
</P>
<P>I got most of the idea of this without the official lyrics. Kate meets
someone who  wants to be a rocket, but she thinks the dude is crazy. Eventually
she sees the light  and enjoys being a rocket too. One part of the song confuses
me though: 
</P>
<P>I put on my pointed hat <BR> And my black and silver suit, <BR> And I
check my gunpowder pack <BR> And I strap the stick on my back. <BR> And,
dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge--<BR>  Nobody seems to see me. <BR>
Then, with the fuse in my hand, <BR> And now shooting into the night <BR> And
still as a rocket, <BR> I land in the river. 
</P>
<P>Who is saying this? Is this Kate or the guy Kate thought was crazy.
Plotwise, it  seems to make most sense if this is the crazy dude. Because then
in the next section,  Kate joins in on the fun and says &quot;Was it me said you
were crazy?&quot; But why is it in  the first person as if Kate is saying these
words? I think it is this way because it  sounds more dramatic that way. I'm
also confused about the line &quot;And still as a  rocket, I land in the river&quot;.
This doesn't sound too healthy. Did the dude buy the big  one trying to have too
much fun? 
</P>
<P>Alternatively, the section spoken section could be Kate speaking. She
survives the  plunge into the river and liked the experience so much that she
goes gonzo in the  next section. 
</P>
<P>This Woman's Work -- The song we already know and love from *She's Having  a
Baby*. Sung by anyone else, this song would be sappy and sentimental. Done by 
Kate is in great. How she does it, I do not know. If you've seen the movie then
you  know what the song is about. The song is rather strange in the sense that
Kate is  singing from a man's point of view again. The words are his thoughts of
what a  schmuck he has been to his wife as he waits outside the operating room
where  something is going wrong with the delivery of their baby. He is worried
that she  might die and wishes he could tell her all all the things he never
said to her and  wishes they could do all the things they never did together. 
</P>
<P>Notice the nice pun, &quot;I know you've got a little life in you yet&quot;.
Most obviously,  this is the man hoping that his wife will live. But the &quot;little
life in you&quot; also refers to  the baby that lives within his wife. 
</P>
<P>Walk Straight Down the Middle -- Another great song by Kate. Not incredibly 
bizarre or anything, but this one really strikes home. Slightly Gabrielesque.
Why this  is a B-side/bonus track I cannot fathom. It is orders of magnitude
better than  &quot;Reaching Out&quot; or &quot;Love and Anger&quot;. It seems to
be about some of the problems  with relationships (surprise, surprise). When you
are involved with someone, there  is often a lot of fear that you are coming on
too strong and scaring the other person  away. Or that you are playing it too
cool and that the other person is losing interest  in you. A lot of the time it
feels like both of these at the same time. You want to find  the right middle
ground, but you don't know where it is. The mind games that you  play on each
other, causes both of you to become stressed out and think that things  aren't
working. Soon you've confused each other so much that you don't know  what you
want anymore. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He thought he was gonna die, <BR> But he didn't.&quot;

<P>Date: Tue, 17 Oct 89 21:04:37 -0500 <BR> From: Michael Mendelson &lt;mendel@cs.uiuc.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: So happy to be alive... 
</P>
<P>As I sit in my office on the first bitter day of autumn, The Sensual World
begins  again for what is about the sixth or seventh time since this afternoon
when it left the  store and became a part of me. I couldn't imagine this album
being released in any  other season on any other day... this was just perfect. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is the softest, silkiest, smoothest and most intensely
personal  of Kate's work yet. At the same time, Kate seems to have mellowed a
bit -- there's  no Big Sky; no Babooshka; no Wow; not even a Pulling Out the
Pin. Instead, the  music seems easier to appreciate more quickly... that
impenetrable wall erected in  The Dreaming and fortified by such Ninth Wave
songs as Waking the Witch and Jig  of Life has all but crumbled and been
replaced by a new peace -- a pre-song  GIGGLE! Kate is &quot;all grown up now&quot;
and it shows. There are no backwards vocals,  no indecipherable sounds, and on
the surface this album seems alot simpler than  previous ones. Deceptively so.
Broken lyrics are replaced by rich string  arrangements, and strange, melifluous
instruments. 
</P>
<P>For me, and for Kate, this album represents a couple of firsts: 
</P>
<P>1) For the first time, I feel I have &quot;caught up&quot; to Kate. This is
the first album I  have been conscious of on the very day of its release. So
happy to be alive. 
</P>
<P>2) Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is the first time any
non-Kate  females have sung *at all* on any Kate track. How perfectly
appropriate that it be 3  sixty-some year old Bulgarian women. If any females
could have persevered enough  to attain a Kately enough level to be allowed to
sing on her album, I guess they could. 
</P>
<P>I, too, disagree with the choice of Love and Anger as an American single. I 
suspect The Sensual World would have done fine, but in my opinion, Deeper 
Understanding would make a wonderful single. Everything about this song is 
fantastic. As with the album as a whole, this effort is trance-inducing,
hypnotic.  There lies through the chord of the album an irresistable
subconscious appeal. 
</P>
<P>The only (minor) complaint I have is with Heads We're Dancing, which,
despite  having the best title of any song on the album, would be better off not
referring to  Hitler. Kate says in NME that she'll be angry if anyone is
offended by this song, but  this unfortunately reflects Kate's lack of full
understanding of the profundity of the  Holocaust and said genocidists crucial
role therein. Hitler's crimes against society are  so heinous, that even a
cautious reference tends to trivialize these acts. I, and many  to whom I am
close, feel strongly that allusion to Hitler in any light (e.g. his human  side,
attractiveness in the midst of &quot;devil,&quot; etc.), however fleeting and
cautious, must  simply be avoided no matter the temptation. 
</P>
<P>Aside from this small blemish, Kate has once again out-done herself. That
she can  be so consistently excellent time after time is indeed beyond mortal
limit. Whatever  her secret, I hope she can continue and live long. The Sensual
World was most worth  the wait, and any future Kate effort will be again, even
if it's five years the next  time. 
</P>
<P>Sensually Yours, 
</P>

<P>Date: Wed, 18 Oct 89 08:32:37 EST <BR> From:
JONES%RPIECS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: A review of the World 
</P>
<P>Hi there fellow Love-Hounds--
</P>
<P>Like the rest of you who weren't fortunate enough to get your hands on a
promo  copy of The Sensual World, I hit the local Record Town yesterday and
snagged it.  The girl behind the counter commented that she had just finished
putting all the  CD's out a few hours before...and I think I took the last copy
from the bin. 
</P>
<P>Anyway! Just thought I'd throw in my two cents' worth about Kate's latest. 
</P>
<P>The first time through the album, there were things that instantly caught my
 attention: 
</P>
<P>Love and Anger 
</P>
<P>The absolutely GLORIOUS laugh between Love and Anger and The Fog 
</P>
<P>The POWER of the vocals in Reaching Out 
</P>
<P>The funky little rhythms at the beginning of Heads We're Dancing 
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding 
</P>
<P> To perfectly honest, I just about cringed the first time I listened to
Rocket's Tail.  There was just something about it that I hated. But never fear,
you Hounds out  there. I used to hate Marillion's Misplaced Childhood and
Gabriel #3 at one point  too. For that matter, I used to have doubts about 3/4
of the stuff on The Dreaming.  I'm sure that with a few more listens, it will
start to grow on me. :) 
</P>
<P>So far (after 2 listens), my favorites are LAA, Reaching Out, Deeper 
Understanding. I loved This Woman's Work then and still love it now (I get 
goosebumps about the size of dimes). This album is pretty different from Hounds,
 but that certainly doesn't make it WORSE. I think Kate is defintely growing up,
and  her use of the Bulgarian Trio and a more 'ethnic' sound reflects that. 
</P>
<P>Ah, but the sound of that laugh still haunts me...I guess somewhere, the
child in  Kate still lurks. 
</P>
<P>Happy listening to all!! 
</P>
<P>All the best, 
</P>
<P>Deb Wentorf 
</P>
<P>P.S. Someone commented earlier on the &quot;lameness&quot; of the front
picture. I really  disagree. The lack of color forces you to search elsewhere in
the photo. You can't  look away from those eyes, but if you do, you see and can
almost imagine the velvety  feel of those rose petals, can see the creamy slice
of bare shoulder. It's a very  seductive picture; what could better convey the
idea of sensuality/sexuality?

<BR> Subject: Negativity and Melody Maker 
</P>
<P>I'm very interested in this question of whether the songs on &quot;The
Sensual  World&quot; are resolved positively or negatively. On the one hand, we
have IED saying  that they are not optimistic. On the other hand, we have KT
saying that they ARE  optimistic. Who do we believe? Well, strangely, I agree
with IED. And |&gt;oug seems to  agree with KT. Although, the ending of &quot;Deeper
Understanding&quot; is less morbid than  I would like. The way I see it is that
our heroine has been deprived of her emotional  crutch and she now can't
function properly in the real world, so she sits in a room,  dribbling on
herself and mumbling &quot;I hate to leave you.&quot;

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review of the album in the Nov. 5 L.A. Times 
</P>
<P>There's a review of the album in tomorrow's (Nov. 4) Los Angeles Times. 
Actually, it's an expanded version of the short review that was in last week's
Pop  Music Special, which I posted. 
</P>
<P>A Grown-Up Kate Bush Veers Closer to Earth 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World.&quot; Columbia 
</P>
<P>**** 
</P>
<P>Goddess or gooney bird? Even some of this English progressive popstress' 
loyalties sometimes have to wonder. Though on 1985's &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
Bush  stripped away many of the quirks of youthful exuberance that had marred
her  unique approach, some will always find her attention-getting vocals
precious and her  quasi-comic outlook and naked emotionalism off-putting. But
this, her first album  since &quot;Hounds,&quot; is even more mature and
accomplished. As Bush herself sings in  &quot;The Fog,&quot; &quot;You see, I'm
all grown up now.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The glorious Trio Bulgarka sings on three songs, further expanding Bush's 
already thoroughly developed world vision -- perhaps only Peter Gabriel melds so
 many cultural elements with such seemless flair. But it's the *how*, not the
*what*,  that distinguishes her accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>Listen to the mournful Balkan wail that punctuates &quot;Deeper
Understanding's&quot;  look at loneliness in the computer age. No Post-Modern
irony or juxtaposition here;  rather, the combination transforms the song into a
wide-eyed-wonderful essay on  the human condition, with all the sensuality
promised in the album title. It's enough  to make you go, well, gooney. - Steve
Hochman

Male vs. Female in The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>The first time I heard the album, I found parts of it almost too painful to
listen  to, at least lyrically, as I was in the throes of defining a
relationship to a woman who  I felt very strongly about, and it wasn't easy
going. Many of the songs of TSW tend  to emphasise a chasm between male and
female, or rather male and female  approaches to relationships. This theme is
fairly explicit in ``Never Be Mine'' and  ``Reaching Out.'' Kate found my
bullseye for me. 
</P>
<P>TSW is a less twitchy and restless album, more resigned to certain mysteries
of  love; I think that, for a lot of men, we'd rather think that we know it all
and that  we can act on our emotions the way we ``should,'' in some rational
manner when  in fact sometimes we can't draw those conclusions, we can't make
certain emotional  situations conform to a models appropriate for the observed
world. Maybe that's the  flip side of the dichotomy of which the sensual world
is one half. Anyway, perhaps  male listeners aren't so keen on accepting how
intractable (from a rational/analytic  view) the whole love mess can be. They
know it, but they don't want to be told  about it, even by a talented goddess
figure. 
</P>
<P>In contrast, ``Rocket's Tail'' and ``Deeper Understanding'' are more like
the  old Kate, although the male adolescent (and I'm not using those words in a 
perjorative way, mind you) and female tendencies are more integrated than on The
 Dreaming. None of Kate's work is so thin that important components of her being
 aren't going to show through.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: &quot;error&quot; in Kate's
mature work? 
</P>
<P> Now, as for the complaint that IED is not being a &quot;true Kate scholar&quot;
because he  does not accept the possibility of &quot;error&quot; in Kate's
mature work--you raise two very  interesting questions, namely: what exactly
constitutes &quot;true&quot; Kate Bushological  scholarship? and what, exactly,
is the definition of the phrase &quot;error in Kate Bush's  work&quot;? 
</P>
<P>In IED's opinion, Kate Bush's art--or, to be more accurate, all of the art
which  Kate has made herself, entirely under her own control (this qualification
would  exempt, for example, the first three official albums in some respects
from IED's  standard, but would not, by the same definition, exempt the 22 early
demos, the last  three studio albums or most of the recent videos)--is what he
considers &quot;perfect&quot;.  That is IED's thesis, and has been the
foundation of all his Kate Bushological  arguments since December of 1977. By
that IED means that all aspects of Kate's own  artistic expression contain seeds
of what IED considers supernatural perfection. 
</P>
<P>Now, some people have been complaining that Kate Bush's new album is &quot;a
 disappointment&quot; to them--that it doesn't compare favorably to her previous
albums,  in particular The Dreaming and Hounds of Love --that it is &quot;flawed&quot;.
IED is not one  of those people. 
</P>
<P>To him, The Sensual World is without &quot;flaws&quot;. It is, like The
Dreaming and like  Hounds of Love, what he considers to be a &quot;perfect&quot;
work of art. Let him qualify  that statement immediately: by &quot;perfect&quot;,
he does not mean that it is impossible to  point to a sign of technical
liability, or of unexpected style, or of &quot;inelegant&quot; melodic  or
harmonic lyricism, or of self-conscious expression, or of lyrical awkwardness.
On  the contrary, it is rather easy to do this--and the alacrity with which some
listeners  point to one or another such apparent blemish does not surprise IED.
It is the  Mysterious nature of Kate Bush's art to provoke strong reactions in
listeners, and as  a result there are bound to be a great many people whose
reactions will be hostile.  These people are often moved to criticize the work
which has so provoked them,  and their cynicism leads them to view many of the
problematic aspects of Kate's  work as &quot;faults&quot;. 
</P>
<P>It is IED's view that Kate's art succeeds most resoundingly when it is at &quot;fault&quot;.
 For it is at its moments of &quot;weakness&quot; that its critics' emotions are
reached. And  there is nothing that upsets and confuses Kate's critics more than
the  consciousness--however dim--that her art has bypassed their intellects and 
penetrated their emotions. In other words, Kate's work is never more &quot;perfect&quot;
in  its power to evoke an emotional response than in its moments of most
dramatic  imperfection. In this respect more than in any other, The Sensual
World is gloriously  &quot;imperfect&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Let's take Reaching Out as an example. Some of Kate's most cynical and  &quot;knowledgeable&quot;
critics have singled this recording out as one of Kate's weakest, as  one of her
most fundamentally &quot;flawed&quot;. It is easy for anyone familiar with
popular  music to understand why these people criticize Reaching Out in this
way: the song  follows, with what is, for a mature Kate Bush song, unusual
directness, a melodic  pattern which the critics' &quot;trained&quot; minds
associate with a large, vaguely recognized  and stylistically suspect genre of
popular song. Epithets like &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; and  &quot;MOR&quot;
are bandied about by these high-minded judges, who search through the  recording
in vain for the &quot;stylistically correct&quot; (to coin a phrase) trademarks
that will  qualify it for inclusion among the earlier recordings already
generally accepted as  suitably antithetical to the genre associated with &quot;Barbra
Streisand&quot; and &quot;MOR&quot;. 
</P>
<P>What these critics fail to realize is that their search itself is a crucial
error. They  will probably never understand this simple fact, and fortunately,
it is of no  importance whether they do or not. But let there be no doubt that
they are in error.  For Reaching Out is typical of Kate Bush's work in that it
shows her connection  with the timeless Mystery of Art and Nature. 
</P>
<P>Now, IED could argue--and very effectively, too, in his opinion--for days on
end  with people in this group over the intrinsic but tangible strengths of
Reaching Out  which demonstrate it to be a great work of art. For example, he
could point out that,  in this song, Kate, as she very nearly always does,
borrows from and synthesizes  several disparate classical and traditional genres
to create something entirely new  and at the same time peculiarly &quot;familiar&quot;
(because already mastered to a technical  degree normally
attained--emptily--only by derivative imitators of others' innovative  new
styles). 
</P>
<P>IED would stress the term &quot;classical&quot;, above all, in the case of
Reaching Out (were  he disposed to argue with these critics) because the chord
progression and the  ascending choral refrain--which the song's gainsayers,
limited by their myopic tastes  and standards, and crippled by what is
apparently a sore paucity of knowledge of the  history of western music out of
which our popular genres have evolved, pigeonhole  as &quot;MOR&quot;--are in
fact far more closely linked with nineteenth-century European art  song
(especially that subgenre represented by Brahms's settings of German  folksongs
and Wolf's Italian Songbook) which re-set the national styles of the  itinerant
musical tradition in the language of late Romantic classical form and  melodic,
thematic and lyrical patterns. IED would also point to Reaching Out's 
systematic redefinition of those forms and patterns in the terms of Kate's own 
deeply personal sonic vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>IED could also (if he wanted to argue on this mundane, sub-Mystery level)
point  out to the song's critics how, in Reaching Out, Kate takes two virtually
unrelated but  equally familiar forms of song--the ballad and the anthem (the
former represented  by the verses in bars 9-16 and 41-48, the latter by the
choruses in bars 25-40 and  57-72)--and merges them; and how, furthermore, she
does so in a successful,  seemingly natural way despite the breadth of the
expressive chasm which normally  separates these two forms--a gap which is
broadened still further by Kate's highly  personal exploitation of the
balladlike verses. He could point out that Kate achieves  this by inserting
between these sections a brand of transitional passage or &quot;bridge&quot; 
which is, as Del Palmer puts it with justified pride and directness, a Bush &quot;invention&quot;
 which he and she call the &quot;PCR&quot;, or &quot;pre-choral refrain&quot;
(in Reaching Out this  section, very subtly altered in its second appearance,
can be heard in bars 17-24 and  49-56). 
</P>
<P>This eight-bar section is deceptively simple, for it must--and
does--accomplish  multiple tasks. The popular-song genre's &quot;bridge&quot;,
which in recent years has  degenerated into little more than a purposeless
formal dinosaur, serves, when  professionally contrived, to relieve the ear and
to regulate the song's harmonic  passage from verse to chorus and/or from chorus
back to verse. Kate's &quot;PCR&quot; does  these two things, of course, and
also determines the &quot;pace&quot; of the song's musical and  harmonic
progress. But--quite unlike the common popular song's &quot;bridge&quot;, Kate's
 PCR, never more economically presented than in Reaching Out, determines not
only  the technical transition from verse to chorus--not only the &quot;shift of
gears&quot;, so to  speak, from the descending melodic phrases which
characterize the verse to the  huge ascending phrases which are the stamp of the
choruses. 
</P>
<P>In a song which so uncompromisingly seeks to link passages as disparate as
the  verses' introvert, balladlike confidences with the choruses' desperate but 
celebratory and abandoned declarations, Reaching Out 's PCR also acts as a kind
of  expressive switching-station. Kate's masterful handling of this delicate
compositional  job works so well that her critics fail to recognize its
significance entirely, and they,  in their unthinking quest for overt deviation
from either the ballad or the anthem,  completely ignore one truly important
achievement which Reaching Out --like all of  Kate's work--embodies: namely, a
profound, but by its very nature covert,  integration of formerly disparate
genres. 
</P>
<P>IED could, therefore, argue quite well (if he wished to, or felt the need)
that the  critics of Kate's &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;conventional&quot;
works, have overlooked a basic  quality of all her art: its constructive rather
than iconoclastic originality. This form of  original, unexpected amalgamation,
realized by Kate with such supreme mastery and  variety, is unfortunately just
the kind of innovation which Kate's inevitably  self-absorbed, style-conscious
critics are incapable of perceiving or appreciating. 
</P>
<P>But, for all the incidental pleasure or intellectual stimulation this sort
of  earthbound argument about Kate's tangible superiority may give IED, he
cannot  help but feel that it is essentially a waste of time. And have no doubt:
IED does not  delude himself into thinking that the rest of you (with one or two
exceptions,  perhaps) share his larger and (to him) infinitely more rewarding
and enlightening  convictions about Kate's art. Nevertheless, it is his
conviction that Kate's muse is a  Vessel of the Mystery. And such being the
case, IED has no choice but to behave in  accordance with the implications which
that conviction carries. 
</P>
<P>Now, within the limits set by IED's thesis, he gets much pleasure from
argument  and discussion. He welcomes any idea about Kate's work which might
increase his  understanding of the Mystery. For example, IED began this posting
by thanking  Sakari with complete sincerity for the description of the new TWW
video, because  in that posting IED found something which he considers to be a
quite important new  insight into the Mystery: namely, the fact that, for the
third video in a row, Kate has  inserted the symbolic image of the shower of
gold. 
</P>
<P>This is a clue which, in IED's opinion, should--if the world were a perfect 
place--have convinced everyone who reads Love-Hounds that IED's thesis is
correct  : that, indeed, Kate Bush's work contains a thread of the eternal, of
the supernatural  perfection which, for want of a better word in this benighted
age, people generally  call God. 
</P>
<P>Another clarification: IED doesn't mean to say that we should all &quot;idolize&quot;
Kate  Bush herself because of this Godly quality in her work. Not at all. IED
confesses that  it is sometimes difficult for him to distinguish between the
Vessel and the Wine,  between the Instrument and the Voice. But in most
circumstances he--like most of  you--sees with relative clarity that Kate Bush
is just a very talented, even brilliant,  but essentially earthbound human
being. 
</P>
<P>This does not in any way diminish IED's conviction--nay, his Knowledge--that
 Kate Bush's work-- all of her work--is infused with the Thread of the Mystery.

</P>
<P>So, accuse IED of being less than a &quot;true scholar&quot; of Kate's work
if you will,  Larry; in more than one sense of the phrase you are no doubt
correct. But in the one  sense which really matters, IED takes comfort in the
knowledge that he, at least, is  on the right TracK.

Subject: reaching out; perfection 
</P>
<P>I wish to congratulate IED on his excellent analysis of the song Reaching
Out. He  has obviously put a significant amount of thought into understanding
the song, and,  through it, Kate's intentions. And all of this insight into just
one song! 
</P>
<P>One quibble: since he concentrated primarily on the structure of the song
and the  mood it creates, he had few words for the orchestration, which is also,
to coin a  phrase, perfect. Of course, Kate did not have complete control over
the orchestration,  except insofar as she elected to work with Michael Nyman,
who did the string  arrangements. 
</P>
<P>Also, although IED has gone to some trouble to explain what he means when he
 says &quot;Kate's work is perfect&quot; we are still a little vague about the
definition of the  word &quot;perfect&quot;; in other words what does it mean to
say &quot;Kate's work is perfect &quot;?  Allow me to explain what I mean by the
word, and IED can second my definition or  forward an alternate. 
</P>
<P>A work is said to be perfect if no small alteration will improve it. In a
strict  mathematical setting, this is the notion of a local maximum in calculus.
There may  exist other maximal points, but they must necessarily be far removed
from the one  under consideration. 
</P>
<P>Perfection is of course only defined modulo a listener. 
</P>
<P>This definition is clear, has a sound theoretical base, and is workable. It
arose in a  discussion over Thanksgiving weekend of Stanley Kubrick's film &quot;A
Clockwork  Orange&quot;, which has been described as &quot;one of the few
perfect films ever made&quot;,  which we took to mean that no scene could be
added, deleted, or reworked in such a  way as to improve the film. (In this
case, I don't even think meddling with the  soundtrack would do any good. It
really is locally optimized.) 
</P>
<P>What makes the definition workable is that we can further define a work to
be  perfect to the tolerance of our own perceptions if we cannot conceive a way
to  improve it. I am implicitly doing this in my judgement of &quot;A Clockwork
Orange&quot;. 
</P>
<P>So, if anyone wants to deny that one of Kate's songs is perfect under my 
definition, and to submit proof, they will have to explain just how it can be
improved.  In the case of Reaching Out, for example, you could suggest
eliminating the  &quot;pre-choral refrain&quot;, subduing the strings somewhat,
or changing a few words. You  cannot suggest taking the record and flinging it
against a brick wall; this is not a  small change. (Conceivably, you could argue
that deleting a single song is a small  change to the album and might improve
it.) 
</P>
<P>There are precious few songs which everyone will agree are perfect. There
are  plenty of songs which anyone can be convinced are not. Pick a song by Bon
Jovi. You  can even convince people who like the song that it can be made
better. 
</P>
<P>I think that Kate may have produced some imperfect songs in the past seven 
years. I just can't think what they might be. I certainly defy anyone to suggest
 improvements in, say, &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot;, &quot;Get Out of my
House&quot;, or &quot;The Ninth  Wave&quot;. 
</P>
<P>You can set your own standards of success in how well you have established
the  imperfection of a given song. If your goal is to convince IED, you are
probably setting  the bar a little high. You might pick some other subset of
love-hounds and try  convincing them. 
</P>
<P>(By the way, you can suggest restoring the original words to The Sensual
World,  but remember that the far-from-perfect decision to remove them was not
made by  Kate!)

</P>
<P>I finally got The Sensual World! I like the album (of course), but I do
understand  now what people have said about the quality of the engineering/mix.
Having listened  to it about a dozen times now, I think I'm ready to say, &quot;It
wasn't Del's fault.&quot; You  see, I think the actual recording of the tracks
was fine. The problem, to my ears is  the mixing balance of the background
tracks -- they sometimes overwhelm Kate's  voice and are generally too
obtrusive. Checking the credits, I notice that it wasn't  Del who did the mixing
on most of the album, it was Kevin Killen. Del only mixed  one song, Walk
Straight Down the Middle. 
</P>
<P>It is too soon for me to choose favorites other than the title track. The
album  doesn't grab me quite as immediately as some of hers have. Then again, it
took me a  long while to decide The Dreaming was the most fantastic album I'd
ever heard. I  do have this intuition, not based on any analysis, that one of
the things that bothers  me is that the album is in some strange way less
mystical, less spiritual than her  other work. Anybody know what I'm talking
about better than I do? 
</P>
<P>And, I must admit, my enjoyment of the album has been lessened by talk that
it  shows some deterioration of her voice. I keep listening to tracks over and
over  thinking &quot;Is she straining there?&quot; &quot;Is that tremolo
intentional or due to a lack of  control?&quot; &quot;Is the breathy delivery a
coverup for raspiness?&quot; I will feel greatly  relieved if her next album
(WHEN WILL IT BE?!) calms some of my fears and  shows her voice to be intact and
still the most amazing thing since God created  sound. I'm hoping that this
album simply wasn't a very good showcase for her  voice, that she was using a
certain style here that I'm just not meshing with yet, just  as it took some
people a while to get used to what she was doing on The Dreaming  compared with
the high, ethereal vocals of her early albums. 
</P>
<P>I think the next album can't help but be helped by just &quot;turning down
the  volume on all that electronic background crap and letting me hear KATE!&quot;
