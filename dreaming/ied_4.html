<BR> Subject: Quiz 
</P>
<P> P.S.:

<P>praKTice Quiz KuesTion No. 1--Difficult.) 
</P>
<P>A panther stalked through the jungle. Who or what was the panther? 
</P>
<P>praKTice Quiz KuesTion No. 2--Intermediate.) 
</P>
<P>What was Kate's source for the rhythm in Jig of Life ? 
</P>
<P>praKTice Quiz KuesTion No. 3--Difficult.) 
</P>
<P>How long did the fall of Jericho take--be as precise as possible. 
</P>
<P>[some days later:] 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Answers to three sample test questions: 
</P>
<P>1.) In 1982 Kate, in an article written for the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, 
described how she instructed her musicians to play their parts--generally not
with  traditional musical terms, but via visual imagery. In the case of Eberhard
Weber's  bass part for Pull Out the Pin, for example, Kate saw &quot;a panther,
stalking through  the jungle.&quot; She used a similar image later, when
describing work on the Hounds of  Love sessions. IED assumes that the bassline,
if associable with a specific character in  the song, represents the Viet Cong
guerrilla fighter, not the clumsy, disheartened  U.S. G.I. 
</P>
<P>2.) The rhythm track on Jig of Life was suggested to Kate by her brother
Paddy,  who heard something like it in a recording he himself had made of what
he  identified as a Greek (or Northern Italian) &quot;fire dance&quot;. 
</P>
<P>3.) The &quot;fall of Jericho&quot; was a bit of a trick question. The name
Jericho should  immediately suggest the video of Experiment IV to all Kate Bush
fans, since that  film features a Dr. Jerry Coe in a lead role. When Dr. Coe
arrives at the secret  laboratories at the beginning of the video the time on
the clock reads twelve o'clock  noon. Toward the end of the disastrous fourth
experiment, the time can be made out  on a wristwatch--about 5:30 p.m. So, the
answer to the question is &quot;about five and a  half or six hours.&quot;

<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P> Regarding these &quot;where is our beloved IED, and who is this Andrew
Marvick  person&quot; questions; IED is an &quot;Artificial Arrogance&quot; (AA)
program. It was accidently  created when the complete works of Wilhelm Reich
were loaded into a Kate Bush  data-base. This program seized control of the
computer that Andrew was using at  school. It intercepted all of Andrew's
innocent mail and re-wrote it in a bizarre  style, black-mailing Andrew by
threatening to erase his transcript. Andrew's move  to New York was an attempt
to escape the control of this creature. It has been  threatening to transfer
itself across the net. A crack team of researchers has been  assembled to combat
it, including Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dr.  Suess and The Amazing
Kreskin.

<BR> Subject: Mailbox 
</P>
<P>Now, then. IED would like to say that he has really been enjoying reading
the  variety of stories Love-Hounds have been posting recently about how they
first got  into Kate. Since we all know the wonderful feeling of the initiKation
riTes, these are  the kind of stories we can all appreciate. 
</P>
<P>For anyone's interest, IED's epiphany was swift and certain--no gradual 
awakening for him. The place was Florence, Italy, the time November, 1977. IED
was  then just plain old Andrew Marvick, a junior on his year abroad posing as a
callow  art student, with nothing but a cheap AM-FM radio to fulfill his musical
needs. It  was a dark and stormy night, about 2 a.m., and the radio station was
Radio  Luxemburg--one of the two stations that picked up on &quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; months  before its official release (the other was Capital Radio).
It was nearly two months  before IED learned the name of the artist, and more
than half a year before he  could obtain a copy of The Kick Inside, but even
through the static and the tinny  mono speaker of the pocket radio that night
IED knew that he had heard The Voice  of Angels. Now, thirteen and a half years
later, he can still hear them... 
</P>
<P>Favorite album: Either The Dreaming or The Ninth Wave (which can be seen as
a  short album in its own right)--when all is said and done, probably The
Dreaming  (please, no gloating from |&gt;oug). 
</P>
<P>Favorite song: A tie between Under the Ivy and Ne T'Enfuis pas. 
</P>
<P>Least favorite album: A dubious category, but if forced, IED would say Never
For  Ever --which shows you how silly the category is. 
</P>
<P>Favorite video: A three-way tie. Ran Tan Waltz, from the Kate (&quot;Christmas&quot;)
 special; Army Dreamers --the &quot;Mrs. Mopp&quot; version from the German
programme  &quot;RockPop&quot;; and Experiment IV --the lip-synch version from
Wogan. As wonderful  as the studio-made promotional videos are, IED still
prefers a select few of the  TV-studio lip-synchs from years past.

</P>
<P>IED here, after returning from a trip to Europe and England. While in the 
London area he was very fortunate to meet up with our much admired and 
appreciated friends of Homeground Towers, Dave Cross, Peter Fitzgerald-Morris
and  Krystyna Fitzgerald. They were splendid hosts to this philocanine from
beginning to  end, and IED never had such good egg, ham and chips... 
</P>
<P>IED did spend a couple of hours in and around Welling and Abbey Wood, and 
was surprised to find a British Rail poster up in the local railway station
using Kate  Bush's name (in a sense) to promote family rail discounts. Very
charming. 
</P>
<P>IED is about to log off now to go pick up Two Rooms, which he just spotted
in a  nearby record shop. N.B.: the &quot;lazerdisk&quot; (sic) of Two Rooms is
also supposed to be  available domestically as this is being written--though
whether Kate appears on it or  not is a mystery to IED. Meanwhile IED hopes some
of you will be keeping a sharp  eye out for Prince's next video(s), esp. airings
which identify the director(s), just in  case the credit he gives to Kate in the
notes of his new CD is explained by her  involvement in one or more Prince video
projects.

<P>I recall contacting the postmaster at CS.UCLA.EDU at the time the wiscvm 
BITNET gateway was disappearing looking for a path to continue exchanging e-mail
 with Andy , and they commented that this machine was an IBM mainframe &quot;over
in  the business department&quot; and that they didn't have any connections to
it (eventually,  they did, and his postings then came from
ied0dxm@oac.ucla.edu). Actually, I don't  think that this was even his own

who taught at UCLA.

<BR> Subject: tIEDbit 
</P>
<P>All Doug's facts are correct, and in an earlier post that I can't now find, 
someone else had also recalled that IEDODXM was at UCLA. The problem is, in the 
phrase &quot;his old username,&quot; who is the antecedent of the pronoun &quot;his&quot;?
The thread  concerns *IED*. Doug is only reporting what Andrew Marvick would
tell you: 
</P>
<P>First, the little matter of &quot;IED&quot;. There is no single correct
answer, though your  suggestion is an excellent one. I have had several
suggestions from Love-Hounds over  the years. Among the best, I think, are: &quot;In
Excelsis Dea&quot; (is that the correct case-  ending for &quot;goddess&quot;,
by the way?); Identity of Editor Deleted; and I Encourage  Devotion. The &quot;truth&quot;
is actually much less interesting: the letters were three among  the thousands
that UCLA computer account users were randomly assigned upon  gaining access to
the mainframe. I much prefer the fans' alternative explanations. 
</P>
<P>'My suggestion' had been this: 
</P>
<P>May I share with you my assumption about the identity of IED? Just to see
those  letters put me in mind of the medieval scholastic QED. QED = quod erat 
demonstrandum, &quot;which was to have been demonstrated,&quot; the somewhat 
self-congratulatory way in which scholastic argumentation would conclude itself.
If  that's the model, then IED would be &quot;id est demonstratum&quot; or &quot;&lt;thus&gt;
it has been  demonstrated!,&quot; an even MORE assertive claim about what has
been presented. This  may not be right, but is entirely in character for IED,
who makes sure that  everybody knows the exact and correct truth of any matter.

</P>
<P>Andy Marvick's opinion of what IED means is of course well-informed, but as 
Evan Welch so correctly stated, &quot;Previous attempts to guess the meaning
behind The  Symbols have proved fruitless, with IED refusing to be goaded into
either  confirming or denying theories presented by numerous intrepid
philocanines.&quot; 
</P>
<P>IED still has never said. But it is IED's view, we all know, that Kate Bush
is God.  She is his creator, therefore. (If there had been no Kate Bush, there
would be no  IED. I.E.D.) In the cosmos of any competent creator, nothing is
meaningless. So the  quest continues. Probably IED doesn't know the secret
himself. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In excelsis deo,&quot; from which &quot;In Excelsis Dea&quot; derives &lt;case
is correct if  recognized as dative&gt;, comes from the first line of the Gloria
in the Latin Mass:  &quot;Gloria in excelsis deo,&quot; &quot;glory to God in
the highest&quot;. The problem with 'in excelsis  dea', taken as a stand-alone
phrase, is that it makes the word 'dea', goddess,  appear to be nominative. That
would translate more like &quot;Goddess in the highest  &lt;degree&gt;&quot;
than like &quot;Goddess in heaven.&quot; Perhaps that's why Andy includes it
first in  his list of favorites. 
</P>
<P>But that's just Andy's view, not IED's.

<P>Just to get this straight right out of the starting gate, Happy is a *HUGE*
Kate  Bush fan. Quite apart from whether or not Kate fans should support Happy
because  of it, or would like Happy because of it, it's a fact that Happy would
be the first to  tell you. There's no deluding anyone. Happy was 16 when she
became a Kate fan.  Happy learned to *sing* by singing along with Kate's records
(and Wendy Carlos  and Queen) and that's one reason why Happy's high voice
sometimes sounds similar  to Kate's high voice. Happy would never deny that. She
even wrote a song as a  homage to Kate, and Peter Gabriel, and her other musical
influences (&quot;Feed the  Fire&quot; on _Warpaint_). Beyond Happy's love for
Kate's voice and Kate's music, she  deeply respects Kate's *control* of her
music, that Kate didn't want anyone to tell  her what to do, or how to manage
her career. Kate is a very strong role model for  Happy in many ways, but Happy
doesn't want to *be* Kate, or be compared to such  an extent that people will
lose sight of Happy's own, unique music. 
</P>
<P>I know IED isn't interested in Happy (I've tried :-)) but I don't want IED
(or  anyone else) to think that Happy doesn't know that she owes an IMMENSE debt
to  the example of Kate Bush. She'll be the first to say so. (Well, she'd say it
if asked  anyway. Saying it out of context would be a bit weird.)

<P>Someone (was it Marcel Rijs) has counted IED among an &quot;in-crowd&quot;

several  philocanines is nearly inevitable when association with a discussion
group lasts (as  IED's with Love-Hounds has lasted) some eight years. Veteran
members of this  group will remember well (too well, no doubt) that there was a
time when IED felt  his phosphorous persona to be very much under attack, in the
Jornian sense. He did  not consider himself to be a member of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;
for a very long time. In any  event whatever status might obtain in said crowd
is entirely illusory. After all, what  fortune is it if one gain the world of
Kate Bush fans, but lose one's Internet access  (as, alas! IED is about to do
again)?

 paranormal. Do with this fact what you will, but be aware that the existence of
the  paranormal has now been positively confirmed by She Who Really Is, and that
 therefore all further speculation and argument about its existence will be 
superfluous.

<P>P.S.: IED blushes at being so kindly flattered by Dr. FitzGerald-Morris, the
Dean  of the Universitatis Homegroundis, in his invaluable continuing biography
of Kate  Bush, &quot;Five Years Ago&quot;. It is not, IED assures his patient
readers, because of PDFM's  generous comments about IED that he now hastens to
applaud and recommend  Homeground's 52nd issue to all Kate Bush fans, for this
excellent document is  unquestionably a testament to the care, skill and

<P>IED is touched, really touched, by the outpouring of philocanine support 
precipitated by Mr/Ms Runagate's (an apt name, if ever there was one!) uncouth 
remarks. To all those who took it upon themselves to defend his honor, IED
conveys  his heartfelt thanks, and herewith repays you with one of his most
annoyingly fussy  postings yet. As for this runagate, well. . . shall we say

<P>The question was posed whether there will ever be a second edition of The

daunts his less dediKated flesh-and-blood counterpart. Let it be said that the

Subject: Excessive rabidity vs. excessive rapidity? 
</P>
<P> DSearch (David Reff?) writes: <BR> &gt; But I do admit it's beyond me why
those in the latter camp insist in coming  down so hard on those of us who are
merely fans and not fanatics. 
</P>
<P>A legitimate complaint, one IED, as one who still tends to come down on
people  like a ton of bricks, however gentle he tries to be, feels a
responsibility to answer. 
</P>
<P>First, he agrees that there's no excuse for ad hominem responses to postings
 openly critical of Kate Bush's work; not for the first time IED apologizes for
any  remarks which may have given the appearance of uncalled-for vituperation.
As  much as he would like it not to be so, he is and probably always will be a
zealot. 
</P>
<P>He would like to think, though, that the main reason for his sometimes 
uncharitable defense of Kate Bush's work in the face of &quot;critical&quot;
Love-Hounds  postings is that these are, more often than not, too-hasty
expressions of the writers'  fleeting personal preferences. 
</P>
<P>If one wants to say, for example, that &quot;Experiment IV [is] a bit
pretentious,&quot; or  that &quot;Lionheart isn't quite as strong [as TKI],&quot;
one has a perfect right to do so, of  course; but what value can the skeptical
reader attach to such judgements in the  total absence of substantive,
substantiating argument? 
</P>
<P>Have our customs of public discourse really declined to such an extent that
any  writer's pronouncement about any subject at all must be received with
perfect  equanimity (and the implication of agreement), no matter how flippant
or flimsy  that pronouncement might be? In our sometimes excessively democratic
society we  have all learned (some of us, admittedly, with reluctance) that
everyone has an equal  right to a voice in the public information-stream; but
that doesn't mean that we  should ( caveo IED's introduction of the
unfashionably moralism-pregnant mode) all  spill our ids out into that already
roiling current armed with a false confidence that  whatever we say must be of
value simply because we have said it.  
</P>
<P>Anyway, as long as IED (along with others who share at least some of his
views) is  here to respond, those who are rash enough glibly to criticize Kate
Bush's work will  continue to find their views challenged, with the request
(whether humbly or  arrogantly made) that REASONS be supplied to substantiate
the criticism.   
</P>
<P>That said, however, David asks some wonderful questions, to wit: 
</P>
<P>&gt; [1.] What if Kate decides to market vials of her sweat under the guise
of artistic  expression? 
</P>
<P>[2.] Can Kate still do no wrong? 
</P>
<P>[3.] What if she decides she's not just a singer-songwriter and film
director,  she's also a painter? 
</P>
<P>[4.] They'll be great paintings just because they're hers? 
</P>
<P>[5.] And if she moves on to write books, 
</P>
<P>[6.] design buildings, 
</P>
<P>[7.] build cities....??? 
</P>
<P> 1. Could the geneticists out there tell IED whether sweat contains DNA? If
so, he  for one would gladly pay a good price for a phial of Kate's sweat --in
the event that  cloning should some day become an affordable service. Imagine a
world filled with  millions of Kate Bushes -- one might reasonably expect at
least one album  every...five years! 
</P>
<P>2. Wrong? As far as IED is aware, Kate has still done no &quot;wrong&quot;,
unless it be to  herself (smoking, arguably, for example). But artistic error?
If so, they are so minor  as not to be worth identifying. Anyway, an artistic
misfire by an artist of Kate  Bush's caliber would certainly be as interesting
and even artistically nourishing as  the finest work we could ever hope to
receive from any other living artist. 
</P>
<P>3. About a year ago Kate Bush sold (for charity) a pair of framed images of
her  own making. From their descriptions (and a not-very-helpful photo), they
sounded  like perfectly serviceable &quot;conceptual&quot; artworks. More
importantly, they added  insight into Kate Bush's lifelong thematic vocabulary,
and in that respect any visual  art by her would have value, both to art and to
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>4. No, they won't necessarily be &quot;great&quot; paintings, just because
they're hers  (however one defines that modifier). But again, even Kate Bush's
relatively smaller  artistic achievements (could any of her works ever somehow
be accurately identified  as such) would have great value to the enthusiast of
her art, because as the product  of her mind, they would expand our appreciation
of and insight into the rest of her  production. 
</P>
<P>5. Do you seriously propose that a booklength text by Kate Bush could be
without  value? And if you concede that such a thing would certainly have at
least some  value, by what criteria would you measure that value against that of
another work of  literature? And, whether you were able to do that or not,
wouldn't whatever the  book offered be bound to add to our store of knowledge
about her art, and therefore  have great value no matter what the judgement of
its critics regarding its literary  merit? 
</P>
<P>6. Apparently Kate Bush has been doing just this thing (designing buildings)
 recently (or at least keeping a close eye on the renovation of a listed
building in the  Reading area)! If you were invited to the housewarming, would
you really turn it  down? 
</P>
<P>7. Ooh! A city by Kate Bush! It's a fabulous concept! It sounds like an
absolutely  terrific thing -- what would lead you to think such a project might
not be  worthwhile? Surely not quibbling objections about a lack of training in
urban  planning, engineering, architecture, etc. -- surely Kate Bush could
afford technical  advisors. 
</P>
<P>IED thanks you for your wonderfully intriguing questions and comments,
David,  and means no disrespect -- honest.

<P>Although I appreciate IED's humility of recent years (while simultaneously 
missing the fiesty IED of years long past), I cannot in good conscience allow
this  statement to go unchallenged. Although, the statement was no doubt true at
the time  the statement was supposed to be posted, it is, alas, no longer true.

</P>
<P>At the time of the dispute in question, long years of dedikateon had caused
my  brain grow to the size of a planet, filled with incredible quantities of
knowledge and  wisdom about Kate Bush. In recent years, too much mindless C++
programming and  snuggling with my wife and neglect of the only topic worthy of
serious consideration  has caused my brain to shrink back down to merely human
proportions. I must  admit that the converse of IED's statement is now certainly
true: At this point in  time, IED knows more about Kate Bush than I do or likely
ever will again.
