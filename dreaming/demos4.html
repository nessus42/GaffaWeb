      <BR> Subject: (diffs) FAQ: Cathy Demos </P>
    
    <P>4.4. Basic Discography/Videography </P>
    
    <P> The Cathy Demos (23 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan).
      Twelve of these are demos of songs that later appeared on albums. They are
      available on various bootlegs. (Anybody have an early 80's album called
      THE EARLY YEARS?). </P>
    
    <P> Tracks (compiled from various boots - none contains all. The names are
      not officially known, so there are some songs with more than one name.
      Some names are from a radio broadcast in Arizona [KLN], the matching was
      done by [AR]): </P>
    
    <P>The Kick Inside (Brother) [note subtitle], </P>
    
    <P>Hammer Horror, </P>
    
    <P>It Hurts Me (A Rose Growing Old, Feeling Like A Waltz), </P>
    
    <P> Keep(ing) Me Waiting (Stranded at the Moonbase), </P>
    
    <P>Davy (While Davy Dozed), </P>
    
    <P>Disbelieving Angel, </P>
    
    <P>Moving, </P>
    
    <P>Kashka From Baghdad, </P>
    
    <P>Surrender Into the Roses (Coming Up, Carmilla), </P>
    
    <P>Oh To Be In Love, </P>
    
    <P>Rinfi the Gypsy (Playing Canasta (in cold rooms)), </P>
    
    <P>On Fire Inside a Snowball (Snow, Hot in the Ice), </P>
    
    <P>Dali (Ferry Me Over), </P>
    
    <P>Where are the Lionhearts (Lionhearts, On the Rocks) </P>
    
    <P> [NOT Oh England My Lionheart], </P>
    
    <P>Violin, </P>
    
    <P>The Craft Of Love, </P>
    
    <P>The Gay Farewell (Queen Eddie), </P>
    
    <P>Something Like a Song (In My Garden), </P>
    
    <P>Frightened Eyes, </P>
    
    <P>Never The Less (You'll Do), </P>
    
    <P>Come Closer To Me Babe (Goodnight Baby), </P>
    
    <P>So Soft, </P>
    
    <P>Rare Flower (I Don't See Why I Shouldn't (Pick the Rare Flower), </P>
    
    <P>Organic Acid </P>
    
    <P>The Studio Demos (7 songs, 1977?, often listed along with The Cathy
      Demos) Most of the times these share the space on CDs, LPs, singles or
      tapes with The Cathy Demos, the biggest distinction is that the studio
      demos were done together with the KT Bush Band instead of Kate alone at
      her piano. (Babooshka differs in style and might have been recorded at
      Dave Gilmor's studio, some comments on various bootlegs about the second
      version suggest this) Tracks (same comments about the names as above):
      Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake, Kite, L'Amour Looks Something Like
      You, Strange Phenomena, Scares Me Silly (Really Gets Me Going), Babooshka
      (2 versions), </P>
    
    <P>[Andy (IED) suggested to split the entry for The Cathy Demos in The
      Cathy Demos and The Studio Demos. Where does Turkish Delight belong to? Is
      it a Studio Demo or a Cathy Demo?] </P>

      <BR> Subject: Songs word gaps </P>
    
    <P>Hello again, </P>
    
    <P>I've been listening and reading the words of my recently got Home Demos
      CD (thanks again Robb), and have noticed some gaps in the wordsheet from I
      mentioned yesterday. </P>
    
    <P>Here are my thoughts on what (possibly) the gaps should be. </P>
    
    <P>The * means the changed lines. </P>
    
    <P>Davy </P>
    
    <P> ... </P>
    
    <P> Your face seemed radiant,
      <BR> * The walls too steamy,
      <BR> * With a crack emerged,
      <BR> As I held you
      <BR> Oo-ooh...
      <BR> * While na-na na-na-na na-na-na Davy dozed.
      <BR> I closed my eyes
      <BR> * And now the time is close for us to go.
      <BR> Hold me, oh hold me. ... </P>
    
    <P>NB This chorus is repeated again </P>
    
    <P>Ferry Me Over </P>
    
    <P>High.
      <BR> * Can't see you.
      <BR> * You've seen your darling
      <BR> Alone and higher still
      <BR> ... </P>
    
    <P>On the Rocks (Lionhearts) </P>
    
    <P>...
      <BR> Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,
      <BR> A burning sword.
      <BR> I'd like to cry. I look into her eyes.
      <BR> * I see she's sitting on days and night.
      <BR> &quot;Ooh,&quot; she says,
      <BR> ... </P>
    
    <P>Pick the Rare Flower (Don't See Why I Shouldn't) </P>
    
    <P> ...
      <BR> It's quite an occasion.
      <BR> It's driving me crazy.
      <BR> * I'm not allowed to touch on lust.
      <BR> I've gotta get a hold of myself.
      <BR> ...
      <BR> It's calling me.
      <BR> * Would I ever see him whisper.
      <BR> * A magical opera enchanting me.
      <BR> I've gotta get a hold of myself, </P>
    
    <P>Something Like a Song (In My Garden) </P>
    
    <P> ...
      <BR> I see him when I turn the lights down low,
      <BR> In my garden, wading through the pond.
      <BR> Resting sooooo.
      <BR> &quot;Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo...&quot;
      <BR> ... </P>
    
    <P>OK, some of these were guesses and of course can be way out, I've also
      not listened to the whole CD while comparing the words with what is shown
      in the wordsheet I have (which may also be out of date). </P>
    
    <P>I hope this helps out and others benefit from my observations, it might
      help since I was brought up in the same part of England as Kate (about
      20-30 miles away), although I often think she has more of an Essex accent
      really (no insults intended), not Kent. Hmm, the accent is close, maybe
      her parents were from Essex, or had some London in them. I don't mind
      really, I quite like accent variations, they really fancinate me. </P>

    <P>Bryan Dongray sez: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; On the &quot;Home Demos&quot; CD, the last track &quot;Really Gets
      Me Going&quot; (#29) </P>
    
    <P>&gt; What's the alternative title(s)? </P>
    
    <P>this track is sometimes referred to as &quot;scares me silly,&quot; but
      all of the bootlegs where it appears title it &quot;really gets me going&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>this track is not one of the cathy demos. it is one of six demos that
      were recorded prior to the recording of the kick inside with a full band
      in a real studio. </P>
    
    <P>i don't think the words for this song are anywhere in the archives,
      though IED makes reference to them in the garden. </P>

    <P>Here's my latest interpretation - I decided to bring a little technology
      to bear on the problem and sampled the track using my PC's SoundBlaster 16
      card so I could play back sections repeatedly and slow it down to
      half-speed for the tricky bits. I'm not at all sure about the last two
      lines of the second bridge, though. </P>

    <P>It would perhaps help to have some context. (Nude Ad Guy, please correct
      me on any details.) </P>
    
    <P>The tapes NudeAdGuy is referring to were aired in Phoenix were probably
      original demo tapes. Kate sent demo tapes out to a number of record
      companies when she was looking for a place to sign on. Someone who worked
      at one of these record companies took the tapes with him/her when they
      changed jobs. </P>
    
    <P>At some point the tapes were aired on a radio station in Phoenix. The DJ
      read the names of the songs from the original label, which we may strongly
      conjecture and even hope are the names Kate to gave these songs. </P>
    
    <P>This whole piece of information was discussed at some length earlier
      this year, if anyone would like to review previous conversations about
      this. </P>
    
    <P>The list of the names from the demo tape were posted. Several of them
      are rather different from both the names on the bootleg 7&quot; (these are
      not official remember) and also different from names the Love Hounds have
      come to call some of these songs spontaneously. </P>
    
    <P>IED kindly made a sort of matrix of all known names of these songs,
      which should also be archived in the postings of that stretch of time.

    <P>Hey, folks, simmer down. Yeah, Nude could have been a little sweeter
      about this issue, but his point is really not debatable: Kate definitely
      sings &quot;On fire inside a snowball.&quot; And the titles on the Cathy
      Demos EPs are not the least bit authoritative -- notice, for example, the
      incorrect &quot;Rose Growing Old&quot; instead of the correct &quot;Waltz&quot;.
      The Pheonix titles, on the other hand, appear to be legitimate, though

      <BR> Subject: re &quot;Snowbound...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>FYI--I had a tape of this radio braodcast at least a year before the &quot;Cathy&quot;
      Demos started appearing in illicit record stores in my area. I, too,
      bought that demo on colored vinyl to see if the quality was any better
      than the low-power radio broadcast that I had. (It is.) </P>
    
    <P>So, yes, I do have an inside lead--the DJ was a guy named John Dixon,
      who goes by Johnny D on the air and he's a big Kate fan and former
      employee of Capitol Records, which is where he got the tape. </P>
    
    <P>Incidentally, I saw him at a local record convention recently where he
      showed me EMI acetates of &quot;Man with the Child&quot; and another song,
      I think &quot;Kite.&quot; They weren't for sale, by the way. He just likes
      to pull them out so Kate fans like us can drool on them. (He has no idea
      what he would ask for them even if he was going to sell them!) </P>
    
    <P>For the record, here's the songs on the tape I have, with the titles as
      listed on the tape box, as read by the DJ: </P>
    
    <P>The Kick Inside,
      <BR> Hammer Horror,
      <BR> It Hurts Me,
      <BR> Stranded at the Moonbase,
      <BR> Kashka from Baghdad,
      <BR> Surrender into the Roses,
      <BR> Oh To Be In Love,
      <BR> Rinfi the Gypsy,
      <BR> On Fire Inside a Snowball,
      <BR> Dali,
      <BR> Where Are the Lionhearts,
      <BR> Violin,
      <BR> The Craft of Love,
      <BR> The Gay Farewell,
      <BR> Something Like a Song,
      <BR> Frightened Eyes,
      <BR> Disbelieving Angel,
      <BR> Nevertheless, You'll Do,
      <BR> Come Closer to Me Babe,
      <BR> So Soft,
      <BR> Rare Flower,
      <BR> While Davy Dozed. </P>

      under what alternate titles? </P>

    <P>OK, I'll skip on the ones that have never changed their name, here's

    <P>The only left from the Home Demo CD (excluding TKI outtakes) is </P>
    
    <P>Ferry Me Over </P>
    
    <P>and the only one listed on the Phoenix broadcast is: </P>
    
    <P>Dali </P>

    <P>You've seen your &quot;Dali&quot; I've seen it as &quot;Darling&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Alone and higher still </P>
    
    <P>Hmmm! Could be that the DJ said &quot;Darling&quot; but they might sound
      much the same over the radio. </P>
    
    <P>I think I'm going to change my home made CD insert for my Home Demos CD
      to have the Phoenix broadcast titles, I guess they're closer to what Kate

      <BR> Subject: Demos </P>
    
    <P>Bryan Dongwray's cross-indexing of the Cathy Demos titles is very
      helpful. IED has some amendments to offer: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Surrender Into the Roses Camilla&quot; -- Important change: </P>
    
    <P>IED's suggested title should read &quot;Carmilla&quot;. The song
      explores the Victorian vampire story of the same title, written by
      Sheridan LeFanu; hence IED's suggested title. Carmilla, not Camilla. Of
      course, this may not be the actual title of Kate Bush's song. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Gay Farewell Eddie the Queen&quot; -- The correct title of
      this one is pretty well confirmed as &quot;The Gay Farewell&quot;; IED's
      title, &quot;Eddie the Queen&quot;, is not likely. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Something Like a Song In My Garden&quot; -- The correct title of
      this one is pretty well confirmed as &quot;Something Like a Song&quot;,
      not &quot;In My Garden&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Ferry Me Over&quot; and &quot;Dali&quot; -- These suggested titles
      are indeed for the same song. IED was told by someone long ago that the
      song was suggested by Salvador Dali imagery; he has never had any
      confirmation of this claim, however. He has absolutely no idea what this
      song may actually be about; he only knows that it is a masterpiece. </P>
    
    <P>As Bryan suggests, the Phoenix titles seem to be more authentic, for the
      most part, with the above possible exceptions noted. It's too bad that we
      can't really confirm any of the demos' titles. </P>

    <P>Reading from the box, he also says, &quot;Kashka from Baldad,&quot;

    <P>Especially considering the low quality of most of the Kate boots, and
      how few original Kate pieces there are to bootleg. Most of the boots are:
    </P>
    
    <P> * Dubs of the Hammersmith Open videotape. </P>
    
    <P> * Dubs of the Christmas special. </P>

    <P> * Various collections of the &quot;Cathy Demos.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> * Recordings of her few live performances since the tour. </P>
    
    <P> A boxed collection of all these could fit on four or five CDs. This
      would give EMI something to sell during the long, bleak sales winter
      between Kate albums. It would also completely destroy the Kate bootleg
      market. </P>
    
    <P>... </P>
    
    <P> No, this is, and always has been, about *control*. Kate's control of
      her music. I have no objection to *positive* control. It's the *negative*
      control that it irritating. This the famous Bush family passive-aggressive
      way of dealing with things. </P>
    
    <P> Releasing the &quot;Cathy Demos&quot; would do no harm to Kate's
      career. No one would mistake it for a new release. The only person who
      doesn't want them out there is Kate...because she doesn't think they are &quot;good
      enough.&quot; Fine. She is welcome to think that. We have the right to
      disagree. But could *somebody* try to convince her that her fans are
      intelligent enough to understand the work of a mature artist, and to also
      want to see the &quot;garden&quot; that that art grew from? </P>
    
    <P> She could put a big red warning sticker on the package &quot;Warning!:
      Kate is of the opinion that these songs are of not 'up to snuff!'&quot;

    <P>&gt;Yet another lost opportunity. . . perhaps someone needs a marketing
      manager . </P>
    
    <P> She needs a manager. Period. Not a producer, no, she handles the
      musical part wonderfully. She needs a business manager to offer an
      objective opinion from outside her family and friends. To handle the
      details of putting a tour together (according to sources, she *has* tried
      to assemble a US tour.) To look after Sony and try to get some effective
      marketing in the US (they couldn't get 50 people to see a free showing of
      The Line, The Cross and The Curve in *Chicago*?!? Hell, Vickie and I got

      <BR> Subject: KT Piano Demos on CD </P>
    
    <P>Let me recall. We have 22 home demos, 6 studio demos, the two
      Babooshka's and Organic Acid. Right? </P>
    
    <P>Organic Acid is not available on CD. </P>
    
    <P>What I have, and how they sound: </P>
    
    <P>- - Cathy's Home Demos, Blue Moon, 29 songs (Moving is missing) </P>
    
    <P>- - Practice makes Perfect, Piano Demos No.1, France, 26 songs </P>
    
    <P> (Goodnight Baby, 2 Babooshka's and Moving are missing) </P>
    
    <P>- - If you could see me fly, 18 songs | </P>
    
    <P> Passing through Air, 13 songs, |both Chapter One </P>
    
    <P> These sound all very similar and are recorded from record. </P>
    
    <P>- - Alone at my piano, Ukinel Records, NY 1988, 22 songs </P>
    
    <P> (CD-version of the cassette &quot;Fiddle&quot;?) </P>
    
    <P>This CD sounds different. You can't hear any of the typical record
      noise. It seems to me that this might be either a direct copy from a
      demotape, or from a tape dubbed from a demotape? IED? What exactly is &quot;fiddle&quot;?
    </P>
    
    <P>The first airing of the original 22 demo tape in the US was in 1982 (!)
      by DJ John Dixon who had worked for EMI at the time of KaTe's signing (see
      Breakthrough 4/84), but it took more than 6 years for their release. </P>
    
    <P>I like this one much more, because it sounds so fresh, direct. You can
      also hear the turning off/on of the tape recorder and KaTe walking there
      and back to the piano, you can hear the planks creak. It's as if you are
      in the room with KaTe. I love it. And you can hear the sparrows chirping
      at the end of Hammer Horror! This bootlegger has my respect. </P>
    
    <P>The others above are all for the garbage can, IMHO (from the sound
      quality point of view). Unfortunately you need them too, because they have
      additional material. The two Chapter One CD's have all. Sorry, I don't

      <BR> Subject: of Koffee and Tapes </P>
    
    <P>Just as many thanks to Wieland for his thorough run-down of the several
      CD editions of the &quot;Cathy Demos&quot;. Very very useful information!
    </P>
    
    <P> Wieland writes: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; - - Alone at my piano, Ukinel Records, NY 1988, 22 songs </P>
    
    <P>(CD-version of the cassette &quot;Fiddle&quot;?) </P>
    
    <P>&gt; This CD sounds different. You can't hear any of the typical record
      noise. It seems to me that this might be either a direct copy from a
      demotape, or from a tape dubbed from a demotape? IED? What exactly is &quot;fiddle&quot;?
    </P>
    
    <P> By &quot;record noise&quot;, IED assumes you're referring to vinyl
      surface noise, not tape hiss, of which this CD has a great deal. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Fiddle&quot; is the title of an early (1988?) cassette-only
      bootleg of 22 of the demos, which IED picked up at a record swapmeet. From
      your description both &quot;Fiddle&quot; and &quot;Alone At My Piano&quot;
      appear to stem from the same source (perhaps the Phoenix FM broadcast).
    </P>
    
    <P>BUT: although these versions are not from vinyl, and although they do
      not cut out between tracks (with the exception that Wieland listed
      yesterday), they DO seem to be several generations from the &quot;master&quot;
      (whatever that may have been). Like &quot;Alone At My Piano&quot;, &quot;Fiddle&quot;
      suffers from terrible tape hiss, which gets louder in between songs
      (indicating the use of an auto-record-level dub at some point during the
      course of the recording's ancestry). </P>
    
    <P>As far as IED is aware, all of the other current CD editions so
      comprehensively listed by Wieland appear to derive from the bootleg LPs, &quot;Cathy's
      Album&quot; and &quot;Cathy's Album Too&quot; (there was at least one
      other title for one or both of these, too). And THEY in turn derive from
      the five vinyl &quot;originals&quot;, called the &quot;Cathy's Demos&quot;
      EPs -- which explains the large amount of vinyl surface noise on these
      various CD editions: two generations (at least) of vinyl can be heard.
    </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, the LPs retained neither the sound quality of the EP set
      (which was noticeably superior even to early versions of the &quot;continuous&quot;
      dub, such as &quot;Fiddle&quot;), NOR the little bits of quiet ambient
      noises between tracks. </P>
    
    <P>The problem is two-fold, therefore: first, all of the CDs except &quot;Alone
      At My Piano&quot; are missing most of the between-song bits; and second,
      NONE of the CDs (INCLUDING &quot;Alone At My Piano&quot;) has as good a
      source as it would have had, had any of them originated from the EPs
      themselves. </P>
    
    <P>The problem is even more frustrating, however, because only the first of
      the five &quot;Cathy's Demos&quot; EPs is &quot;continuous&quot; (i.e.,
      retains the between-song sounds), yet it is clear from that single record
      that the continuous sounds in all of the OTHER &quot;continuous&quot;
      editions (&quot;Fiddle&quot;, &quot;Alone At My Piano&quot;, perhaps
      others) are grossly distorted by subsequent use of an auto-record-level
      meter, which artificially exaggerates the volume and timbre of low-level
      sounds (like the originally very quiet clicks of Kate's tape-recorder,
      which in all the later &quot;continuous&quot; dubs sound like giant
      trip-hammers). </P>
    
    <P>All of this is simply to point out the serious need for an authorized
      EMI release of the demos -- WITH official lyrics and commentary by Kate
      Bush about each song, please! </P>

      <BR> Subject: of ponds and pipers </P>
    
    <P>Wieland's excellent challenge to us to revive our never-adequate
      discussion of the brilliant and perfect early &quot;Cathy&quot;
      masterpieces led IED to begin a new listening, which has resulted in a
      small discovery! This is IED's revised reading of the lyrics of the song &quot;Something
      Like a Song&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>He is now relatively confident about these words, which, as readers will
      see, finally bring all parts of the song's lyrics into a logical
      narrative/thematic whole -- one closely related to that of Donovan's &quot;Lord
      of the Reedy River&quot;, which IED dares to suggest might have been the
      inspiration for Kate Bush's great early work. (Notice the use of the
      unresolved repetition of the opening verse as a kind of coda for the song,
      which Kate would have heard in the Donovan recording[s], and which is a
      device she has used several times since, as for example in &quot;The Kick
      Inside&quot; and &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;.) </P>
    
    <P>(As he has done in the past, IED sets the lyrics of &quot;Something Like
      a Song&quot; in verse/chorus order -- which, as so often in Kate Bush's
      songs, is here a novel variant on the usual pop-song formula -- but with
      the addition of prose punctuation, which he believes is appropriate for
      the sake of narrative clarity.) </P>
    
    <P>Something Like a Song </P>
    
    <P>There's something that sounds like a song

      <BR> Rest and sing, &quot;Lover, oohoo...

    <P>That is not possible. Noise is, per definition, totally random. There is
      no way to take away noise without taking away other things as well. One
      popular way to take away noise is to take away treble, because white noise
      mainly consists of treble. But the wanted treble sounds goes away in the

      There is no way to take away noise without taking away other things as
      well. </P>
    
    <P>This is of course, technically true; however, it is possible to be a lot
      more selective about filtering out noise frequencies than simply cutting
      off the top end (i.e. turning the treble down). The Windows shareware
      utility COOL EDIT has a function which will do an FFT analysis of noise in
      a content-free part of the signal (i.e. the gap between songs), and will
      then filter the whole signal to remove all or part of the noise
      frequencies. </P>
    
    <P>I have experimented with this on &quot;Disbelieving Angel&quot;, with a
      small amount of success; the tape I have does not include much of the
      in-between song gaps, however, and I'm sure a better job could be done.
      There are two factors - getting a good sample of the signal-less noise,
      and then the judgement of how much of the noise to remove traded off
      against inevitable loss of parts of the true signal. </P>
    
    <P>As an aside, you can use this technique to analyse say, the frequency
      spectrum of the piano part, and then remove that from the track -fun, but
      ultimately not very useful! It is also very slow on my machine, taking
      over 1 hour real time for 1 minute of recorded signal. </P>

    <P>I thought this was a good time to re-advertise the names as read by the
      DJ of the Phoenix demo tape broadcast apparently off a &quot;real&quot;
      cassette (I believe). So skipping all the obvious later production
      released ones and ones where the title matches, we have: </P>
    
    <P>Phoenix broadcast.. Bootleg Demos.. Often referred to as
      <BR> It Hurts Me.. A Rose Growing Old.. Feeling Like a Waltz
      <BR> Stranded at the Moonbase.. Keeping Me Waiting.. Keeping Me Waiting
      <BR> Surrender into the Roses.. Coming Up.. Camilla
      <BR> Rinfi the Gypsy.. Playing Canasta in Cold Rooms
      <BR> On Fire Inside a Snowball.. Snow.. Hot in the Ice
      <BR> Where Are the Lionhearts.. Lionhearts.. On the Rocks
      <BR> The Gay Farewell.. Eddie the Queen.. Eddie the Queen
      <BR> Something Like a Song.. In My Garden.. Something Like a Song
      <BR> Come Closer to Me Babe.. Goodnight Baby.. Who is Sylvia?
      <BR> So Soft.. You're Soft.. You're Soft
      <BR> Rare Flower.. Don't See Why I Shouldn't Pick the Rare Flower
      <BR> While Davy Dozed.. Davy.. Davy
      <BR> Dali.. ?.. ?
      <BR> ? Ferry me over.. Ferry me over
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>It seems that the words of &quot;Ferry me over&quot; has: </P>
    
    <P>High,
      <BR> Can't see you.
      <BR> You've seen your &quot;Dali&quot; (or is that &quot;Darling&quot;)
      <BR> Alone and higher still </P>
    
    <P>of course the DJ may have said &quot;Darling&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>I personally use the Phoenix broadcast name, since he was reading from
      the cassette box, perhaps Kates own hand writing! </P>
    
    <P>Hope the above helps you write your own CD insert sheet. I have my own
      for my &quot;Home Demos&quot; CD, I also included some images from the
      Cathy book, besides the lyrics, matching appropriate images with songs,
      where I could. Unfortunately, 8 sheets of paper folded over becomes fairly
      thick and only just squeezes in the CD slot. I also have yet to find a
      stapler that can reach the 4 inches to staple nicely the spine. It's all
      only black and white too. Quite nice though according to my friend. </P>
    
    <P>I agree with your liking &quot;Something Like a Song&quot;, it IS up
      there in my mind with &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;, &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;,
      &quot;Infant Kiss&quot;, and &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. &quot;While Davy
      Dozed&quot; is similarly excellent.</P>
    
    <P>I've also amused about the &quot;tiny fish&quot; too! I guess this
      relates to another good phrase &quot;every girl knows about punctual blues&quot;,
      I've always assumed this to be &quot;non-punctual&quot; worries, but
      perhaps it is just referring to PMS, which seems more reasonable. </P>
    
    <P>I also love how she says &quot;Give me one second to succumb&quot; in &quot;Rare
      Flower&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>I prefer &quot;Lizzy Wan's story&quot; to &quot;that old mythology&quot;.
      Neither really to me particularly in the beat to that line, but in
      thinking what could have gone there, I have no idea what would have
      fitted. </P>
    
    <P>On my CD in the 2nd Babooska (with the beat machine), what does she say
      in the last verse? I have: </P>
    
    <P>And when he laid eyes on her,
      <BR> He got the feeling that he knew her well.
      <BR> Uncanny how she
      <BR> Can take him back onto a piece of mars.
      <BR> And saying things that make him want to laugh.
      <BR> Just like his wife before she freezed on him,
      <BR> Just like his wife when she was beautiful. </P>
    
    <P>the problem line is the Mars line! It doesn't seem to make sense or fit
      in, anyone have better ears that me? </P>

    <P>Hi! </P>
    
    <P>Ok, I've done some analyses of some songs and their recording quality.
    </P>
    
    <P>Conclusion: </P>
    
    <P>DOES ANYONE HAVE THE FIRST THREE 7&quot; CATHY DEMOS FOR SALE? </P>
    
    <P>(reasonable [i.e. affordable] prices only please!) </P>
    
    <P>If anyone's making a reasonable offer, I'd give a CD recording of the
      singles back in return as well - I've access to a CD writer... </P>
    
    <P>Here's what I found out: </P>
    
    <P>I listened to Kashka, Coming Up, and Goodnight Baby. The first and the
      last one also on vinyl, namely Cathy's Album (both) and Cathy Demos Volume
      Four (Goodnight Baby only). Conclusion: </P>
    
    <P>- - Cathy Demos Volume Four: </P>
    
    <P>This recording is - compared to all others - really good. As close to
      studio quality as you can get in a living room with amateur equipment in
      the 70s. That is, there's almost no tape hiss, almost no surface noise,
      equal recording level with no automatic adjustment, almost no distortion.
      Very nice. There's one click on the *left* channel after the first couple
      of seconds of Goodnight Baby. There's more clicks and pops, but generally
      they're not too disturbing, *and* they're on all other recordings as well.
    </P>
    
    <P>- - Cathy's Album: </P>
    
    <P>Already a lot worse, and the click on Goodnight Baby is on *both*
      channels. This record also has the screech - screech - screech... on the
      beginning of Kashka. </P>
    
    <P>- - If You Could See Me Fly, Cathy's Home Demos, Home Demos, Practice
      Makes Perfect (Piano Demos No. 1): </P>
    
    <P>These four inferior CDs (Practice... doesn't contain Goodnight Baby, but
      does contain Kashka) all are copies of the Cathy's Album series, for: the
      click at the beginning of Goodnight Baby is on *both* channels, and the
      screech... is there as well. </P>
    
    <P>- - Alone At My Piano: </P>
    
    <P>The click is on the *left* channel, the screech is not there. So it's
      not a copy of Cathy's Album. On the other hand, the sound is far worse
      than on Cathy Demos Volume Four. Especially the high frequencies seem to
      be missing quite a lot. </P>
    
    <P>- - Shrubberies: </P>
    
    <P>The click is on the *right* channel. Strange but true. This therefore is
      also not a copy of Cathy's Album. The sound quality seems to be better
      than the sound quality of Alone At My Piano, but that's basically because
      there's much more high frequencies. Unfortunately higher frequencies also
      bring in more tape hiss. </P>
    
    <P>To summarise this with also giving some numerical estimations: </P>
    
    <P>Let's say a modern studio recording on CD is 100 points and static noise
      is 0 points. Then I'd put the four CD copies of Cathy's Album (and Cathy's
      Album Too) at about 40. These albums themselves would be at 43-45. Alone..
      would be at 50, Shrubberies at 55 (for the first 22 tracks, the rest is

    <P>A side remark: Cathy Demos Volume Four's version of Goodnight Baby is
      even still *MUCH* *MUCH* *MUCH* better than any of the others after I've
      recorded it on far too low level (~ -6 db) on a good analog tape deck with
      Dolby C) and by playing it (what a sacrilege!) on a good but old and
      not-cared-for turntable. &quot;Good&quot; in both cases means just &quot;good&quot;,
      definitely not &quot;very good&quot;. </P>

    <P>Cathy's Album + Cathy's Album Too are also available as Cathy Complete
      in a 2 LP set. I've not seen this anywhere, but have seen it listed.

    <P>Too Much Bush For You: This LP was also only listed somewhere, the only
      thing I know that it's supposed to exist in 133 copies and is US made.

    <P>IED has studied Uli's excellent evaluation and agrees completely
      (insofar as his own limited knowledge allows) with Uli's judgement of the
      various editions' relative sound quality -- the difference between the &quot;original&quot;
      7-inch EPs and all other editions is indeed very noticeable, which makes
      the abrupt cut-outs between songs on all but the first EP even harder to
      bear. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Sensual Woman&quot; -- IED believes this was simply the
      alternate title used for some pressings of the &quot;Cathy's Album/Cathy's
      Album Too&quot; LPs. There is no discernible (to IED's ears) difference in
      sound quality between these different pressings. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Fiddle&quot; -- Audio-cassette only as far as IED is aware, and
      NOT very good sound quality. IED once received a relatively better
      audio-cassette dub from an unnamed source from Australia which was better
      than &quot;Fiddle&quot;'s sound, but still nowhere near the quality of the
      EPs'. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Original Masters of Cathy Demos? </P>
    
    <P>To follow on Uli's very thoughtful discussion of the varying quality of
      the various versions of the Cathy demos: </P>
    
    <P>I would be willing to bet that at least SOME of these versions are the
      best that you are going to get. Speaking as someone of the same age group
      as Kate, who was dickering around with various home recording techniques
      (although no one is ever going to clamour for the release of my demos!),
      the technology and quality that was available then was light years worse
      (and more expensive) than what is available today. </P>
    
    <P>These demos (I 've heard the vinyl 2-record set) sound very much to me
      like the quality of what a lot of people, without access to professional
      (expensive) recording studios, would make as submissions to record cos.
      for possible signings. So...it could be that what EMI has, or what they
      received from Kate originally, is exactly what you hear on the Cathy
      demos. I don't know much about transferring tape to CDs and remastering,
      but I honestly wonder how much of this could be &quot;cleaned up&quot; if
      the original version is such low quality. </P>
    
    <P>I seem to recall, however, that David Gilmour paid for Kate to make a &quot;professional&quot;
      tape, and some of that ended up on The Kick Inside. Are there any songs
      from that that haven't been released? </P>
    
    <P>Cheers, Fiona </P>

    <P>IED: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; By &quot;record noise&quot;, IED assumes you're referring to vinyl
      surface noise, not tape hiss, of which this CD has a great deal. </P>
    
    <P>Yes, that's correct. I for one can't stand it listening to a CD
      crackling like a record! Then I prefer tape hiss. This also reminds me
      more of the original demo tape. </P>
    
    <P>We are so lucky that we can listen to these treasures, aren't we? I have
      always a feeling of &quot;this girl knows it all&quot;. But maybe this is
      typical for girls in this age? </P>
    
    <P>&gt; an auto-record-level dub </P>
    
    <P>&gt; ... which artificially exaggerates the volume and timbre of
      low-level sounds (like the originally very quiet clicks of Kate's
      tape-recorder, which in all the later &quot;continuous&quot; dubs sound
      like giant trip-hammers). </P>
    
    <P>Oooh, I see, I was always wondering about this strange distortion. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; All of this is simply to point out the serious need for an
      authorized EMI release of the demos -- WITH official lyrics and commentary
      by Kate Bush about each song, please! </P>
    
    <P>Dreams Are! </P>
    
    <P>I think we will never see an official release. This is one of the very
      few things, I can't understand of KaTe. Why she's so completely against a
      release. I really would like to talk to her about it, persuade her to do
      it. I know I have the arguments on my side, but nothing else! Oh yes, all
      lovehounds will stand behind me as one man! </P>
    
    <P>But maybe there's a chance to track down one of the original tapes, find
      Mr. John Dixon? Money should be no consideration! But I would suppose, he
      is not very cooperative. What can we do? Just read Uli's idea... A
      lovehounds -CD! </P>
    
    <P>Sounds very good! Go on with that, Uli! Anyone in Germany with the EP's?
      But remember, all this is VERY illegal! Better discuss most of it in
      private! </P>
    
    <P>Now to: </P>
    
    <P>Something Like a Song (aka In My Garden) </P>
    
    <P>[IED:] </P>
    
    <P>&gt; In my garden, wading through the pond, </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Rest and sing, &quot;Lover, oohoo... </P>
    
    <P>I think, this is correct. </P>
    
    <P>[IED:] </P>
    
    <P>&gt; ...finally bring all parts of the song's lyrics into a logical
      narrative/thematic whole... </P>
    
    <P>The only question for me is: Who sings &quot;Lover...&quot;? Is it him?
      What's his problem? Maybe the song should be called &quot;Melancholy&quot;?
      Explain. </P>
    
    <P>Re Noise-subtraction: </P>
    
    <P>[Anders Hultman:] &quot;That is not possible. Noise is, per definition,
      totally random. There is no way to take away noise without taking away
      other things as well.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>[Craig Heath:] &quot;This is of course, technically true; however, it is
      possible to be a lot more selective about filtering out noise frequencies
      than simply cutting off the top end (i.e. turning the treble down).&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>I know this technique from my own research on NMR spectra. You can
      subtract mean noise, which makes signals visible, which were hidden under
      the noise before. </P>
    
    <P>It is clear that techniques like this have some effect on the sound
      itself, but it seems to work quite good. Remember the new Beatles song! I
      have also heard stories about a company who processes exactly those demo
      tapes we are speaking about. It's done before presenting them to a larger
      audience. It's done either by the record company or the band. It works
      like: </P>
    
    <P>Noisy tape </P>
    
    <P>| </P>
    
    <P>V </P>
    
    <P>heavy computers + very much money ($ 5.000 I've been told) </P>
    
    <P>(As Craig already pointed out, it took large amounts of computing time.)
    </P>
    
    <P>| </P>
    
    <P>V </P>
    
    <P>Noisefree tape. </P>
    
    <P>|&gt;oug: Any NASA/NSA/FBI connections? I think we can raise the money,
      but at first we need the original tape! </P>
    
    <P>AND A GIANT CAMPAIGN BROKE FREE </P>
    
    <P>***** WHERE IS THE TAPE ? **** </P>
    
    <P>Bring it in the news. Inform your lokal newspaper... </P>
    
    <P>And when you know, where it is: Steal it. Or commit massmurder (this for
      |&gt;oug only). </P>
    
    <P>Bryan Dongray: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; It seems that the words of &quot;Ferry me over&quot; has: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; High, </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Can't see you. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; You've seen your &quot;Dali&quot; (or is that &quot;Darling&quot;)
    </P>
    
    <P>actually it sounds to me like &quot;you've seen you-en-aaleeee..&quot;
      But I'm sure it's Dali. The last word in the song is definately &quot;Dali&quot;
      and not &quot;darling&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Especially I like these A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oooh's (Ferry Me Over) and the
      Ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, ooh...'s (Something Like A Song) </P>

    <P>IED totally disagrees with you about this one, Jon. Not only does he see
      nothing &quot;embarrassing&quot; about those lines from The Craft of Life
      and In the Warm Room ), he actually considers those lines to be among
      Kate's most remarkable and powerful. Such explicit yet simultaneously
      sensitive references to sex are extremely uncommon in vocal music of any
      era, and they're even more uncommon in the work of female popular
      musicians. Though they may be excruciatingly direct, they are not the
      least bit trite. These lines may &quot;embarrass&quot; you, but IED thinks
      they're totally wonderful. Perhaps your dedication to the exigencies of
      the scientific process is what makes these images (which are obviously
      poetic and not subject to standards of &quot;biological&quot;
      correctness!) so unpalatable to you, Jon. If so, it's too bad. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Re: Copies of original Cathy demos? </P>
    
    <P>Fiona says the Cathy demos might never sound any better, but the issue
      is whether a good copy can be made from the best available source (the
      five &quot;Cathy's Demos&quot; seven-inch EPs), rather than the noticeably
      worse-sounding sources that were used for all the currently available CD
      editions. Certainly, though, Fiona, your point is well taken -- these
      recordings will never sound exactly &quot;professional&quot;, though the
      performances are peerless. Many fans, however, have not heard the sound of
      the EPs, and would be surprised to hear how good they sound compared to
      all the other editions. </P>
    
    <P>As for the &quot;professional&quot; demo arranged for by Dave Gilmour:
      this is tricky, because there were two &quot;sessions&quot; connected with
      Gilmour. The first resulted in several home recordings featuring a live
      band of some of Gilmour's friends, of which the track &quot;Passing
      Through Air&quot; is one. The second resulted in three more elaborately
      arranged and carefully recorded tracks, of which the LP cuts &quot;Saxophone
      Song&quot; and &quot;The Man With the Child In His Eyes&quot; are two. The
      third track from that session was a version of the song &quot;Maybe&quot;
      (or &quot;Humming&quot;), of which part of an *earlier* recording was
      played once on the BBC Radio programme &quot;Personal Call&quot; in 1978
      or '79. The later, more polished version of that song has never been
      released. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, this is the way IED has interpreted the bits and pieces of vague
      information he has picked up over the years regarding the demos. </P>
