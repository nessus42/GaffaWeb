</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It's always been clear to us that &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; is about
someone who's been  in a terrible accident at sea and is trying to survive in
the water. But these words  had always troubled me -- these are the words of
someone who had a choice when  making the journey. Usually this isn't the case.
We travel because we must, for the  most part. 
</P>
<P>Several years after hearing &quot;The Ninth Wave,&quot; I started sailing
again. I learned to  sail when I was 16, in a Cal 20 in Monterey Bay. I was a
natural. Whenever they  wanted to get the boat from point A to point B in the
Bay, the instructors would give  me the helm and the rest of the group would
catch rays on the foredeck. I  remember some screaming beats around Soquel point
with great fondness. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, I didn't sail much again until I was 30. A good friend of
mine  married a woman who owned a Catalina 27. I became her partner in the boat,
and  later I bought it outright (they had a child, and the boat was no longer in
the game  plan). Now I sail about twice a week during the summer, and about once
every two  weeks during the winter. 
</P>
<P>Naturally, I wanted to become a better sailor, so I started reading sailing
books.  One very good book that I read is called 
</P>
<P><I><STRONG>'Fastnet: Force 10'
</STRONG><BR>by John Rousmaniere.</I> 
</P>
<P>It's about a particularly disasterous ocean sailing race. It then occurred
to me  that the words of the protagonist in &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; are those
of a racing sailor.  This is the introduction to 'Fastnet: Force 10' : 
</P>
<P>This is a sea story, and it is true. It is the story of how fifteen people
died, not in  wartime, or on a hunt for whales, or in a typhoon in the South
China Sea, but during  a yacht race only seventy miles off the coast of England.
What began as a six  hundred-mile sail in fine weather around a lighthouse off
the Irish coast became,  for twenty-seven hundred men and women in 303 yachts, a
terrifying ordeal as one  of the most vicious summer gales in the twentieth
century swept east from the  American Great Plains to trap the Fastnet race
fleet in the shallow water of the  Western Approaches to Britain. 
</P>
<P>The worst disaster in the one-hundred year history of ocean yacht racing,
the 1979  Fastnet race is a startling reminder of man's vulnerability before the
elements. As  the official inquiry into the calamity concluded, &quot;the sea
showed that it can be a  deadly enemy and those who go to sea for pleasure must
do so in the full knowledge  that they may encounter dangers of the highest
order.&quot; From 10:00 PM on August 13  until 6:00 PM on August 14, those
dangers were a shrieking wind that blew at force  10 velocity (forty-eight to
fifty-five knots) and up to hurricane strength, and, more  dangerous, a true
maelstrom of a seaway. Steep waves as high as fifty feet formed  towering
breakers that collapsed on boats and sailors like surf on a beach, hurling 
twenty thousand pounds of water at twenty or thirty knots onto hulls that, on 
average, were only thirty-eight feet long and weighed about fifteen thousand 
pounds. More than one-third of the boats were knocked over until their masts 
paralleled the water. One-fourth were capsized entirely, many rolling over
through a  circle. Even the larger boats -- anoung them former prime minister
Edward Heath's  Morning Cloud and Ted Turner's Tenacious -- were battered. Many
boats were  damaged and some crews were badly injured. 
</P>
<P>Worse yet, six men were lost overboard and swept away when their safety 
harnesses broke. Nine others drowned or died of hypothermia in the cold water
and  air, either on board yachts or near life rafts that had capsized. In all,
twenty-four  crews abandonded their yachts, five of which sank. One hundred and
thirty-six men  and women were saved from sinking yachts, life rafts and the
water itself by heroic  helicopter crews, commercial and naval seamen, and
fellow yachtsmen, and seventy  yachtsmen were towed or escorted to safety by
lifeboats. 
</P>
<P>What follows is the story of the case and the storm, told in the accounts of
over  seventy yachts and rescue vessels. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This is the disintegrating power of a great wind: it isolates one from
one's kind,&quot;  Joseph Conrad wrote in Typhoon . Besides affection for the
outdoors and  competitiveness, one of the reasons why people undergo the rigors
of racing boats  out of sight of land in the opportunity that the sport offers
for companionship. The  Fastnet gale, however, showed how isolated and helpless
we all can be. Human  contact was difficult and and communication was impossible
in the shrieking wind  and and pounding seas. Even the security of the cabins
was false, as galley stoves, tins  of food, sails, and bodies flew from side to
side below with every lurch and roll.  While offshore racing had always been
respected as a challenge, and, at worst, a risk,  few people caught in the gale
would have previously thought the sport to be actually  dangerous. The
realization that they, their shipmates, and their competitors were in  danger
dawned on the most unlucky sailors during the gale, and on many of the 
survivors after the storm passed and the fight for survival ended. 
</P>
<P>Acknowledging vulnerability has not driven this sailor from the sea. I had
seen  gales before the Fastnet race -- but none as bad -- and probably will see
gales again  -- I hope, none worse. Yet like many people at the turn of the
decade, I feel  considerably more aware of the limitations of both myself and of
the increasingly  complex technology that surrounds my sport and my life. Like
many activities in late  twentieth-century life, yachting apparantly has
benefited from professionalism,  specialization and rationality. In the year of
famine in Southeast Asia, a revolution in  Iran, and a frightening accident at a
nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, the  calamity in the Western Approaches
seems to be yet another indication and our  positivic faith in technology may be
groundless. We appear to have been led by  transitory successes into the heresy
that we can completely manipulate our lives and  our environments -- a modern
version of the medieval doctrine of justification by  works. 
</P>
<P>Hunger, religious fervor, and nuclear energy may eventually be channeled or 
controlled, but only with the deepest respect for their latent powers. More
certainly,  wind and water will again be used for emotionally satisfying ends,
but only by  people who acknowledge that catastrophe is always possible.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">  'Fastnet: Force 10' 
</P>
<P>This book was written in 1980, and the Fastnet disaster was front page news
in  England at the time: 
</P>
<P>The events that occurred in the Western Approaches on August 13, 14, 15 and
16  received immense international attention, and the accounts published at the
time in  many newspapers and magazines were important sources... 
</P>
<P>London -- Daily Express , Daily Mail , Daily Mirror , Daily Star , Daily
Telegraph ,  Guardian , Lloyd's List , Observer , Sunday Telegraph ... 
</P>
<P>I don't find it coincidental that &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was released in
1985. This is  enough time to have written &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; and the
rest of the album and then  record and release it. Kate certainly would have
known about the Fastnet gale, and  it's possible she actually read 'Fastnet:
Force 10' . 
</P>
<P>Most of the clues are in &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; and &quot;Hello
Earth.&quot; Compare these  passages: 
</P>

<P> Yet with 600 feet of line dragging over the stern, Grimalkin was barely in 
control. She surfed wildly down the faces of waves like an elevator cut loose
from its  cable, and threatened to pitchpole, or somersault over her bow... 
</P>
<P>Ward... frantically looked to port and starboard for a flat spot to aim
for... but all  around was broiling white foam and ahead was a black wall -- the
back of the next  wave rising out of the narrow trough.

</P>
<P>The &quot;white horses&quot; were the breaking Fastnet seas that destroyed
five racing  yachts and caused twenty-four crews to abandon their boats. 
</P>
<P>The storm that hit the Fastnet fleet was known to the meterologists. They
had  tracked it from the American Midwest all the way across the Atlantic. It
was just  much stronger than they anticipated, and took a turn to the south that
they didn't  expect:

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(&quot;Hello Earth&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Compare that with John Rousmaniere's description: 
</P>
<P>The storm was born [on August 9] in the northern Great Plains of the United 
States, where hot air over baking wheat fields frequently tangles with cold
Canadian  air to produce tornadoes and violent thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>On Friday [August 10]... seventy-eight boats boats competeting in the J/24 
sailboat class were swept by unpredictable, violent gusts from the south-west
and  north-west. The boats finished the race under a black sky and made it
safely into  the protected harbor of Newport just before the Coast Guard issued
an alert  warning for all sailors to seek shelter. 
</P>
<P>Moving east at speeds as high as fifty knots, the swirling air was over Nova
Scotia  at about the time the Fastnet race started on Saturday [August 11], and
was in the  open Atlantic a day later. 
</P>
<P>In the predawn hours of Monday, August 13, the dangerous little depression 
changed course and headed northeast... British forecasters realized at about
noon on  Monday that Low Y [the Fastnet gale], swinging around Low X, would
sweep across  southern Ireland and the Western Approaches that night. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">('Fastnet: Force 10' ) 
</P>
<P>And I'll leave you with a description of force 10 conditions: 
</P>
<P>Force 10: Wind speed, forty-eight to fifty-five knots. Very high waves with
long  overhanging crests. The resulting foam in great patches is blown in dense
white  streaks along the direction of the wind. On the whole, the surface of the
sea takes a  white appearance. The tumbling of the sea becomes heavy and
shocklike. Visibility  affected.

<P>  Many thanks to Henry Burdett Messenger@cup.portal.com for posting one of
the  cleverest pieces of Love-hounds detective work in years. 
</P>
<P>  I can supply some collaboration. Kate has stated that she doesn't read
much  fiction, that her tastes tend to run to non-fiction. I am a bit out on a
limb, but it  really *seems* like the sort of thing that Kate *would* read,
based on the sort of  supposition that a friend might make about what sort of
book to buy for a birthday  present. (I'm *not* claiming that I'm one of Kate's
friends, I'm just offering an  opinion based on reading a whole *bunch* of
interviews.) 
</P>
<P> And Kate does tend to let things bubble around in her subconcious for quite
 some time before writing about them. It was years *after* seeing the TV version
of  Wuthering Heights that she wrote the song. Same thing with the space between
 seeing The Innocents and writing The Infant Kiss, reading A Book Of Dreams and 
writing Cloudbusting , and other less well established inspirations. Suffice to
say, a  gap of five years between experience and response is not uncommon for
Kate. 
</P>
<P>  I got chills re-reading Kate's words in this new light. I'd say you have
it exactly. 
</P>
<P>  This is one of the best pieces of Love-hounds detective work since Jorn 
Barger's discovery of the original lyrics to The Sensual World . 
</P>
<P>  Congratulations.

<P>I'll second that: nice work! If this incident was truly Kate's inspiration
for The  Ninth Wave--and it seems hard to believe that it wasn't--this only
confirms Kate's  genius for turning the tragic into the beautiful.
