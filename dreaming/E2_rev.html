</p>



<p>Hi-Fi &amp; Record Review 
</p>

<p>December 1985 issue 
</p>



<p>&lt;The following article was written by Sue Hudson, an editor for the British 
magazine Hi-Fi &amp; Record Review. It appeared in their December 1985 issue. Ms. 
Hudson's article may not be accurate in every detail, but it's one of the most 
heartfelt brief statements about Kate to have appeared in a mainstream British 
publication to date. IED felt it would be a nice introduction to the world of Kate 
Bush.&gt; 
</p>



<p>Back Door: Sue Hudson explores the unique poetry of Kate Bush 
</p>



<p> We've been holding our breath for a long time. Three years of playing the old 
songs and wondering &quot;whatever next?&quot; Would it be even weirder than The 
Dreaming ? Would it leave more admirers by the wayside, shaking their heads? 
</p>

<p>The real fans will happily go along for the ride, even if she isn't going the pretty 
way. For Kate journeys into new and exciting territories. She is an original in a music 
world dominated by cover versions, regressive movements and identikit superstars. 
The direct opposite of the archetypal rock star: compulsively introvert in a world of 
screaming extraverts, middle-class and deeply English amid England's all-pervasive 
working class American ethos, boldly feminine in rock's macho climate. Her 
melodic genius and articulate lyrics make the rest seem moronically simplistic. Her 
instrumentation is far removed from the traditional guitar/drum-kit set-up and 
predictable synthesiser riffs. Instead, she brews a heady mixture of musique 
concrete, multi-tracked chorus and acoustic instruments from the digeridu to the 
balalaika; all skillfully appropriated to produce precisely calculated effects. Her lyrics 
are also multi-diverser. After a thousand songs on the theme of 
boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl or Thatcher's Britain, exposure to her music comes as 
an imaginative release as we go giddily flying into the limitless possibilities of the 
poetic viewpoint. Here is talk of whales, of Peter Pan, kites, Houdini, mysticism... 
</p>

<p>Acquaintances have observed, &quot;She lives in a world of her own.&quot; But it's a world 
that lives within all of us, and her songs shine light into neglected areas of our 
minds. Using imagery nostalgically familiar to fellow Englanders, her subjects come 
tripping from library shelves, television and cinema screens and musty books of fairy 
tales, the stuff that dreams are made of. She spins tunes that haunt, twist and turn 
the mind, triggering long forgotten moods. Listening intently to her albums is an 
experience akin to having a lucid and feverish dream. Jungian symbols of youth, 
innocence, spiritual escape and the dark, feminine realm abound. Ghosts haunt the 
black vinyl grooves. Uncanny intimations disturb the sensitive. The spirit of Peter 
Pan hovers over her work, sometimes overtly, as in &quot;In Search of Peter Pan,&quot; but also 
covertly, as a yearning for the human closeness and heightened awareness of youth. 
The plangeant beauty of Irish and English folksong lies at the heart of the music, 
working its ancient magic. Magic, too, is the rich Celtic blood that Kate shares with 
so many poets and spell-weavers. 
</p>

<p>But it's not all brooding intensity. There are jokes, too: some Ealingesque -- 
movie-obsessed bank robbers break into The Dreaming, there's a Brechtian romp 
through Arsenic and Old Lace country in &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;, and those &quot;Darling, 
you were wonderful!&quot; theatrics from &quot;Wow&quot;. Teasing seduction has produced some 
adorable songs, a poet's sensuality perfuming the lyrics. Images of silk and lace, 
flickering candlelight, white rosebushes in a storm, dusty ivy, plaiting hair by the 
fire, ravish the mind's eye. 
</p>

<p>But don't imagine that her music is &quot;wet.&quot; When multi-layered sonic collage, 
Kate's own spectacular vocal tricks and chant-like Oriental rhythms combine at the 
ends of the more fey tracks, the effect can be as power-packed as the heaviest metal. 
The use of Eastern borrowings in odd harmonies and interlocking, unfamiliar 
rhythms opens up and strengthens the Romanticism. The lyrics, too, have Oriental 
influences, in the shape of Gurdjieff -- a Sufic guru whose strange terminology and 
mystic psychology are a recurring motif. While it must baffle most listeners, it does 
lend a suitably mysterious distancing to her deeply personal songs, sharpening an 
image that threatens to become too sweet. It's a mischievous paradox that, while 
rock at its ultra-macho best is exhilarating and energising, just at the moment when 
it is most strident and loud, it leaves you needing something more. Then along comes 
a shy doctor's daughter from Welling who out-screams the best, out-powers the 
noisiest and tops it with the satisfying impact of musical and psychological depth. It's 
almost Wagnerian. 
</p>

<p>In a sense, the music is retrospective, since it uses the English/ Irish folk idiom 
that went, via country-and-western, to make up rock and roll. The blues/gospel 
element of Kate's &quot;rock&quot; music is very minor. The rhythms are more often Oriental 
or old-European than African -- waltzes, jigs and ragas. So, to the European and the 
Eastern ear, Kate's music has a sweet familiarity, especially for the British, who 
learn their folksongs in school and still sing hymns and carols in the traditional 
settings. 
</p>

<p>Her talent was precocious. The &quot;Saxaphone Song&quot; and &quot;The Man With a Child in 
his Eyes&quot; were recorded as demo tapes when Kate was still at school. The first 
album, The Kick Inside (1978), cased tremendous media interest and is still the 
public's favourite. Her voice, criticised at the time, was small and childlike, the 
range erratic, if impressive. Since then it has improved enormously, deepening and 
gaining power and flexibility, until now it is a great asset, individual and capable of 
both subtle and stunning effects. The fleshing out of the basic material has also 
improved with experience, the moods becoming more atmospherically defined, with 
more sophisticated instrumentations and extrapolation of themes. 
</p>

<p>The second album, Lionheart, was made at the height of her popularity and is 
almost extravert in tone, with a strong dash of theatricality. Its hit-that-never-was, 
&quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, has fun with the ghosts and ghouls that lurk in the dark corners 
of her more sombre songs. &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; is optimistic and self-affirming. The 
title track is a beautiful lullaby for a sleeping nation. 
</p>

<p>Never For Ever came next and starts in happy mood, with a summer night of a 
cha-cha-cha tribute to a new-found hero, Delius. The philosophic &quot;All We Ever 
Look For&quot; creates a remarkable and rare mood of reassurance and upbeat 
resignation, a Bush specialty. We end Side One with a hippy tour of Egypt, but Side 
Two plunges straight into gloom with a violent Western. The dark continues with 
the shiveringly ghostly &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;, based on Henry James's 
</p>

<p>The Turn of the Screw, and the bittersweet &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, with its ingenious 
use of waltz time. The end comes in the horrifying &quot;Breathing&quot;, a vision of the 
nuclear holocaust through the eyes of an unborn child. 
</p>

<p>On to The Dreaming, a strange, alien album full of mysticism and obscuranti. Its 
impact owes much to sheer production quality. Kate has gradually taken over this 
aspect of her records since Lionheart, and each LP is technically more impressive. 
Her voice here is forward and strong and, in &quot;Leave It Open&quot;, deliberately distorted 
to create a surreal effect. &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; is a shattering trip into madness, 
with a stunning culmination which finds Kate braying like a mule amid a chorus of 
Indian drum talk. 
</p>

<p>The new album, Hounds of Love breaks new ground for Kate with the &quot;B&quot; side. 
This is a story -- The Ninth Wave -- told in a series of songs, like a Pink Floyd 
concept album. Free from the necessity of setting a fresh context for each track, the 
lyrics are more spare, more integral to the music, and her talent blossoms. The 
strong storyline, with its claustrophobic, mystic theme, has possibilities beyond a 
mere side, as do many of Kate's ideas. Such a fertile imagination is quite capable of 
keeping our interest in one situation for an hour, or longer. Her musicianship is now 
skilled and inventive enough to sustain more instrumental episodes and linking 
themes. And as mistress of mood, she has the right combination of talents to stretch 
out beyond the limiting confines of pop into more &quot;operatic&quot; form. 
</p>

<p>Casual listeners will miss the depth of the music. You must sit down with the lyric 
sheet and find out what's going on. All the vocal acrobatics and weird sounds click 
into place when you know what ideas, stories and situations they are expressing. In 
most rock and pop, the music and words may be linked, but are basically separate. 
Kate creates, more and more, a fusion between the two -- the sounds directly 
expressing the subject. this is a throwback to Wagner's music-drama, with its 
leitmotifs, turning music into an idea. The Beatles revived the technique, and bands 
of the hippy era like Pink Floyd carried the banner. But only since the development 
of electronics, which put virtually the whole world of sound at the fingertips of the 
&quot;player&quot; of a Fairlight, has there been such flexibility to allow individuality and 
encourage creativity. Kate is fast becoming a master in the use of this sonic montage, 
perhaps because the ideas she is using are far more complex, have more 
&quot;resonances&quot;, than those of her contemporaries. 
</p>

<p>But Kate will never be an academic artist, drily applying intellectual music theory 
to the delight of a handful of peers, forging into new areas for the sake of 
&quot;progress&quot;. Her style is personal, individual, impressionistic. Like Delius, her music 
will always flow from poetic necessity, breaking from the confines of tradition 
because expression demands it. I just hope that she will have the confidence to 
follow her instincts and not be discouraged by the music press, who in the main are 
baffled and annoyed by her uniqueness. Unable to pigeon-hole her music, they turn 
instead to ridicule and condescension to fill the pages. Which is a disservice to the 
British public, who to their undying credit, have made Kate Bush such a popular 
success.

<p>The Story of A Musical Misfit: Kate Bush 
</p>



<p> Pat Thomas goes walkabout in the Kate Bush 
</p>



<p> In the days when the Boomtown Rats actually had something to contribute to 
popular music and Bobby Geldof's aspirations were to feed his own basic desires 
rather than the world, a strange sort of foil to the new wave movement emerged in 
the shape of a doctor's doctor from Plumstead in Kent. 
</p>

<p>She was Kate Bush, and in the late 'seventies she and Bob used to sweep the 
boards at the then prestigious Melody Maker Readers' Poll awards. They stood 
together like chalk and cheese, but Geldof, not usually known for heaping praise on 
other performers, thought Kate was ace. 
</p>

<p>Kate, whose first single, Wuthering Heights, took her to number one in 1978, 
couldn't have been more flattered by the chief Rat's praise, especially since she 
thought the Boomtown Rats were, well, amazing. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't think they'd be into me. With really beautiful punk groups like that, 
and the Stranglers, too, I wonder if they think I'm...not so much square, but 
whether they think maybe I'm oblong.&quot; 
</p>

<p>At the time it seemed like a typically Kate Bush thing to say. But actually, it's 
quite a perceptive statement. In the context of the new wave, Kate Bush was rather 
oblong, a sort of flower floating on a sea of muck. 
</p>

<p>She was born July 30, 1958, and by the time she was sixteen she had pocketed a 
3,000-Pound advance and an EMI recording contract. Mindful of her age, and since 
they probably had no idea what to do with her anyway, EMI kept her &quot;under 
wraps&quot;, studying dance, music and mime, and writing songs, for just over two years. 
</p>

<p>The advance, plus an inheritance left to her by an aunt, made sure that from the 
moment she left school, with ten &quot;O-levels&quot;, she would never have to cope with the 
same worries that most sixteen-year-olds have about finding a job. Also, by the time 
her first LP came out, her parents had set her and her two brothers up in a 
three-story house (one floor each) in Lewisham--so her independence was assured 
from an early age. 
</p>

<p>Although music was an option, it wasn't really first choice. She really wanted to 
be either a psychiatrist or a social worker. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I never thought of music seriously as a career, because it's so difficult to make 
it. It's all a matter of timing, contracts and talent--and luck. I deliberately tried to 
have a career-orientated ambition, something I could hold onto.&quot; 
</p>

<p>But as luck would have it, she was so bad at physics, chemistry and maths that 
music won almost by default. &lt;This statement conveys a false causality. Kate's choice 
of a career in music was already well underway by the time she returned to school 
briefly to take her &quot;mock A-levels&quot;.&gt; So she began writing songs in her bedroom, 
never daring to let anyone hear the results. &lt;Kate had in fact been writing songs 
since the age of eleven. There was in fact no connection between Kate's discovery of 
her vocation as an artist and her performance in the sciences.&gt; Eventually, though, a 
family friend, Ricky Hopper, heard her tapes and tried to flog them to the record 
industry. The industry, true to form, was not impressed. 
</p>

<p>Ricky decided to get in touch with his old pal from Cambridge, Dave &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; 
Gilmour. Gilmour gave Kate some studio time to do proper demo tapes, introduced 
her to a producer--Andrew Powell--and eventually persuaded his record 
company--EMI--to give her a contract. Without wishing to sound too glib, from 
there on in it was plain sailing. 
</p>

<p>Kate comes from a musical family who enjoyed a passion for traditional English 
and Irish music. Indeed, to this day, Kate's brother Paddy plays in her band. In the 
early days, though, she sang in his band, the K. T. Bush Band. &lt;Although Brian Bath 
and Vic King were evidently friends of Paddy's and had been playing with him for a 
time before Kate joined in, it's safe to assume that the band's name did not 
pre-date Kate's involvement.&gt; As Pete Silverton at Sounds wrote: 
</p>

<p>&quot;She talked about that period as though it were a part of a fondly remembered 
but long lost childhood. Her affection for it, for once, obscuring the hesitancy and 
inarticulacy &lt;sic&gt; of her speech.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The band, such as it was, did the rounds of South East London pubs for only five 
months in the Spring of '77, singing songs by the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and 
Free. The mind boggles at what, say, Satisfaction must've sounded like with Kate's 
tonsils wrapped around it, but she insists that it was &quot;a good experience&quot;. So she 
didn't exactly pay her dues, but neither was she the novice that early press reports 
made her out to be. 
</p>

<p>Her first LP, The Kick Inside, and her second, Lionheart, were released at 
opposite ends of 1979. &lt;Sic--the year was 1978.&gt; The Kick Inside contained Wuthering 
Heights and the superb The Man With the Child in His Eyes (written by Kate when 
she was a mere fourteen), and was a brave musical debut. Few listeners could 
understand how such a young girl could write such sensual and perceptive songs. 
Men wanted to get into her knickers &lt;God how the IED hates the kind of 
sleaze-bags who still make statements like this!&gt; and women wanted to scratch her 
eyes out &lt;And like this, too!&gt; Nevertheless, enough of the U.K. bought the LP to put 
it at number three on the charts. 
</p>

<p>Kate's whooping, soaring vocals, described by NME as capable of &quot;aging the 
nation's glassblowers&quot;, became an immediate target. She refuted suggestions that it 
was a deliberate and cultivated hook. Her story was that it stemmed from her days 
in the school choir. In those days she couldn't hit the high notes, so she practiced 
hard until her voice could span an impressive four octaves. &lt;This figure, for some 
reason quite commonly cited, is quite inaccurate. Virtually no human voice is capable 
of &quot;spanning&quot; four full octaves. Kate' recorded vocal range extends slightly beyond 
three full octaves.&gt; &quot;Honest,&quot; she would smile, &quot;I just opened my mouth and out it 
came.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Undoubtedly her most eloquent champion back then was Harry Doherty of 
Melody Maker. On the release of Lionheart he wrote: 
</p>

<p>&quot;Kate Bush scares me for a combination of reasons. The first is the diplomatic 
pleasantness and awesome logic she displays in interviews. But that is only one 
dimension--she is in fact a 'nice' person. It is when that initial impact is paired with 
the multifarious intensity of her music that I start to quiver. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The contrast is eerie and frightening. In the studio, living out her imaginative 
fantasies, Kate Bush is stricken by a rush of surrealism, and suddenly a range of 
weird personalities are displayed.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Which pretty much sums up what Kate Bush's music was, and has continued to 
be, right up to her current LP, Hounds of Love. It also brings up that old chestnut of 
her &quot;niceness&quot;. Most of her early interviewers were either trying to find the chink 
in her armour of niceness or were full of ridiculous praise for how well adjusted she 
was. It's particularly damning to the music press that most of these articles were 
headed Bush Whacked. So much for creative journalism. &lt;This from a man who 
ascribes to &quot;men&quot; a communal passion to &quot;get into her knickers&quot;!&gt; 
</p>

<p>Kate, however, was difficult to provoke, and breezed through the task of meeting 
the press with impressive ease. Everybody from Vogue to The Vegetarian was 
interested in her off-beat views on sex, drugs and bean curd. Kate's niceness was, 
in fact, a deliberate attempt to hold onto sanity in a world where praise and success 
were being heaped onto her faster than most personalities could cope with. She 
jibed at Tim Lott from Record Mirror, in a rare moment of sarcasm and after 
considerable provocation, &quot;Actually I mug old ladies. Would you like me to smash a 
window or something?&quot; 
</p>

<p>Of course, she didn't break the window. She was never into drugs, either--her 
only real addictions being nicotine and chocolate. In the same article Lott said, &quot;She 
has experimented with drugs--marijuana and something she never managed to 
identify.&quot; He wrote it as an indictment of her naivete, but it really only served to 
reinforce how incredibly average a teenager she was. &lt;Average? Nowadays, Kate's 
moderation is not at all typical of teenagers.&gt; 
</p>

<p>Spring 1979 saw the next major event in the explosive days of her early career. For 
months Kate had been locked away in a North London theatre preparing for her 
U.K. concert debut. It was one of the most highly publicised secrets of the time. She 
was being wired up with a special headset-microphone so that she could perform 
her interpretive dance sequences without hindrance. 
</p>

<p>The second single from Lionheart at the time was Wow --the story of and &quot;aging 
gay actor and a starlet who slept her way into a dream role&quot;, according to The Sun. 
She sang it on TV for the first time on (and the papers made a real &quot;Shock! Horror!&gt; 
out of this one) Good Friday--and on the BBC, to boot! The occasion was an all-star 
Abba TV special, The Daily Express reckoned she would jam the switchboards by 
flinging her body into wanton, erotic gestures&quot;. The Daily Mail wrote: &quot;She walks 
like Joan Collins. She looks like Joan Collins. For a moment you think she is Joan 
Collins.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The Abba show was a taste of what her live show was to be. Kate was given 
enough money to let her fertile imagination run wild, and it did, in an onstage orgy 
of fantasy, theatre, mime, dance, magic, and, oh yes--music. &lt;Actually, Kate used a 
large part of her own fortune to finance the tour. She lost many thousands of 
Pounds on the venture.&gt; She was so busy preparing the extravaganza that she had to 
decline the coveted invitation to sing the theme from the Bond film Moonraker. 
&lt;Again, this is misleading. Kate probably could have found time to record John 
Barry's song if she had wanted to, but she has said that she did not feel it was quite 
the appropriate song for her to sing. She said afterwards that the song was &quot;lovely&quot;, 
and praised Shirley Bassey's performance.&gt; 
</p>

<p>Things were still coming pretty easy to Kate Bush. The tour was, overall, well 
received, although Charles Shear Murray of NME .bf ital did proffer the opinion that 
it was &quot;one of the most condescending gigs in history&quot;, and &quot;crammed with lame 
attempts to widen the audience's artistic horizons.&quot;. &lt;Something from which Mr. 
Murray would clearly have benefited.&gt; 
</p>

<p>&quot;Just tell me one thing,&quot; asked Kate of the review, &quot;was he actually at the 
Palladium that night?&quot; 
</p>

<p>Charles assured her that he spent a week there that night. &lt;This is a distortion. 
Murray allegedly said something like that to his colleague Danny Baker at NME, and 
Baker in turn told Kate.&gt; And so it went. 
</p>

<p>Despite this, her international reputation continued to grow. The only problem on 
the horizon seemed to be where she was going to find the time to write material for 
her third LP. EMI, worried about keeping the momentum going, released an EP-- 
Kate Bush On Stage --which, for a show whose entire success hinged on a stunning 
visual impact &lt;Well, obviously not its entire success!&gt;, seemed a bit silly. The later 
release of the video made eminently more sense. 
</p>

<p>From the release of her third LP, Never For Ever (1980), the Kate Bush story 
becomes a real problem. The big noise amidst which she was unleashed onto an 
unsuspecting public had died down. She toured. She kept her head and persevered 
in reading the teachings of the philosopher Gurdjieff, and in her belief in the 
supernatural. 
</p>

<p>&lt; All three of the preceeding statements are misleading. Kate had toured, once 
only, in the spring of 1979. She did not continue to tour; in fact, she has not 
concertised since then, except as a guest performer at other artists' shows. She did 
not &quot;persevere in reading the teachings of the philosopher Gurdjieff.&quot; All indications 
are that whatever benefit Kate gleaned from the writings of Gurdjieff had been 
acknowledged and assimilated long before Never For Ever was recorded. There is no 
indication that Gurdjieff's ideas have had a particularly important or dominating 
influence on Kate's life or work, at any time in her life--except insofar as those 
ideas harmonised with her own. Finally, Kate has never said never 
</p>

<p>that she &quot;believes&quot; in the supernatural. She has always tried to make it clear that 
she simply maintains an open mind on such subjects as supernatural phenomena, as 
on all subjects about which human beings have no conclusive data.&gt; 
</p>

<p>She kept on having hit records. She kept making money in the pop world, even 
though to the pop world she was a bit of an outcast. 
</p>

<p>Never For Ever gave her her first number one LP in September 1980, and 
delivered three hit singles: Breathing, Babooshka and Army Dreamers. The Eastern 
Evening News (Who? -- Ed.) &lt;original to text&gt; described the album as &quot;faultless&quot;. 
Melody Maker gave it a grudging thumbs up. NME, bless them, proclaimed it 
&quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;the very opposite of what we need&quot;. Annabel, ever on top of things, 
stuck its neck out and claimed Kate Bush was &quot;going to be B-I-G.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Soon after, the &quot;Kate Bush Silly Season&quot; began in the press. Oh Boy gave her the 
&quot;Nastiest Barnet Award&quot;. &quot;Seems Angela Rippon's sick of hearing her hair 
compared to a lump of stale meringue,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Instead we've presented the 
award to Kate Bush...And 'bush' is the word, all right. Sometimes she looks like an 
old mattress with springs sticking out! We'll bet if her hairdresser dug deep enough, 
he'd probably find her school beret under all that lot!&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate took a break from music, but made a brief appearance in the BBC series 
Looking Good, Feeling Fit. &quot;Slinky, hip-swiveling singer Kate Bush can be seen 
tonight as audiences have never seen her: tired, perspiring and completely 
disheveled,&quot; wrote The Daily Mirror's television editor--who was obviously into that 
sort of thing. Her single, December Will Be Magic Again, just scraped into the Top 
30. There was a six-month silence, then a single, Sat In Your Lap. Then a year's 
silence broken by the occasional press report and a Record Mirror interview with 
John Shearlaw. 
</p>

<p>In it, she spoke about the tiredness and depression that followed her only tour, 
the Tour of Life, in 1979. She recalled that Never For Ever was &quot;the first album I 
would actually hand over to someone with a smile&quot;; and the long period of 
non-creativity that followed its release. She talked about &quot;recharging&quot; her creative 
batteries and about the next LP. &quot;I want it to be experimental and quite 
cinematic--if that doesn't sound too arrogant.&quot; There it was, that niceness creeping 
up again. 
</p>

<p>Her fourth LP, The Dreaming, appeared months later than scheduled, in 
September '82. It was her first attempt at producing herself, and once again the 
reviews were mixed. Peter Gabriel was a contributor &lt;This is untrue.&gt; whose 
influence on the whole tone of the LP was considerable. 
</p>

<p>&lt;This judgement has been made often. It is untrue that Gabriel &quot;contributed&quot; to 
the album. He took no part in its recording, and is not credited with any direct input 
on the album's liner-notes. Some of the sounds and techniques created for Gabriel's 
third solo album--on which Kate sang some supporting vocals--did indeed influence 
some of the sounds on The Dreaming. This is partly due, however, to the two 
albums' heavy use of the Fairlight CMI, a sophisticated sampling synthesiser; partly 
due to the innovative sounds which the drummer Phil Collins and the engineer 
Hugh Padgham devised for the rhythms on the Gabriel album; and partly due to the 
experiments which Gabriel and other adventurous musicians were making at that 
time with the technique of composing to the accompaniment of synthetic rhythms, 
rather than or in conjunction with other musical instruments. But The Dreaming 
was every bit as innovative an album as the Gabriel LP--in some ways considerably 
more so.&gt; 
</p>

<p>Of the disk's three singles-- Sat In Your Lap, the title track and There Goes a 
Tenner --only the first one was a hit. 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush is a musical misfit who would do better to turn her talents to the 
cinema or the theatre. &lt;&quot;Do better&quot;?!&gt; She is a bedroom musician who got lucky. 
&lt;&quot;Bedroom musician&quot;?! What does that make pop-music critics?&gt; A delicate creature 
who rationalises the creative process more than is probably good for her. In an 
interview with Harry Doherty she said of the process of recording her first album: 
&quot;It's very frustrating to see something that you have been keeping transient for 
years just suddenly become solid. It's a little disconcerting...but exciting.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush still sells lots of records, but now it seems more like hard work 
promoting and explaining her increasingly difficult-to-grasp concepts. With each 
release, her albums become less of an entertainment and more of an adventure. 
&lt;Adventure is not entertaining?&gt; Certainly Hounds of Love (see reviews section) 
finds her diving deeper into that netherworld of fantasy for which she is so well 
known. &lt;Fantasy? Hounds of Love is as firmly rooted in reality as any album of its 
time. The question is, how narrowly can &quot;reality&quot; be defined?&gt;

From: Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen &lt;larsi@ifi.uio.no&gt; <br>
Subject: &quot;Kate Bush and her women&quot; in Vagant by Johann Grip 
</p>



<p>This article was recently published in the Norwegian magazine &quot;Vagant&quot;. 
&quot;Vagant&quot; is an arty magazine with, I would guess, a very small circulation. I am 
Norwegian, the article was written in Swedish and I have translated it to English. 
The translation is problaby pretty horrible, but I think it is might be readable. I 
think it's an interesting article. 
</p>



<p>&quot;this house is full of M-M-MADNESS&quot; 
</p>

<p>An article about Kate Bush and her women 
</p>

<p>by Johann Grip 
</p>



<p>To begin with a (rhetorical?) question: In our culture, is there a specifically 
female literary tradition that differs from a typically male, patriarchal tradition? 
</p>

<p>If there is, then what does it look like, and what would this have to do with Kate 
Bush? 
</p>

<p>According to the authors of the book &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot; (Sandra M. 
Gilbert and Susan Gaber, New Haven/London 1979) the first question has to be 
answered affirmative. Starting from the 19. century authors Jane Austen, Charlotte 
Bronte and the later Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath, they can 
trace a distinctly feminine literary tradition with &quot;pictures of entrapment and escape, 
fantasies of mad &quot;twins&quot; that play the roles of anti-social surrogates for an unselfish 
I, metaphors for physical pain in frozen landscapes and a furious inner - these 
patterns are recurring throughout this tradition, together with manic descriptions of 
illnesses as anorexia, agoraphobia and claustrophobia&quot; (s.xi). 
</p>

<p>And why should just female authors be haunted by these metaphors and 
fantasies? According to the same book: &quot;Confined in an overwhelmingly 
male-dominated social architecture, these literary women were trapped in the 
literary constructions that Gertrude Stein called 'patriarchal poetry'&quot; (s.xi). 
</p>

<p>A literary woman in the 19. century doesn't only live in a house owned and built 
by men, &quot;she was also hindered and enclosed by the Palaces of Art and Houses of 
Fiction that male writers authored.&quot; 
</p>

<p>With these women the serious and difficult attempts to redefine the womans 
place in art, fiction and society started. 
</p>

<p>Something this specifically female literary tradition had to do was to examine the 
ruling metophors that has described an excluding, wholly male process of creation, 
in which the women has been tied up in either angelic or monstrous shapes. One is 
tempted to cite a few lines by Norman O. Brown as an example of this picture of 
women: &quot;Poetry, this sexual act. Sexuality is poetry. The women is our creation or 
Pygmalions statue. The women is poetry; (Petraca's) Laura is in fact poetry.&quot; (The 
Madw., p 13). 
</p>

<p>Using this feminist theory, I will take a walk through Kate Bush's landscapes and 
try to show how such an investigation of traditional (patriarchal) metaphors and 
attempts to break free of them is staged in a excellent fashion. 
</p>

<p>The journey starts on the first record Kate Bush produced on her own, &quot;The 
Dreaming&quot; (-82), on the last track of the album, &quot;Get Out of My House.&quot; 
</p>



<p> THE HOUSE OF FICTION 
</p>

<p>In &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; the listener/reader finds &quot;pictures of imprisonment 
and escape.&quot; Here we meet the Woman's ambigous attempt to lock herself in her 
own house and at the same time trying to lock the Man, the male, outside. The Man 
is drawn to, and controls, the outside world. 
</p>

<p>&quot;When you let the door was (slamming) <br> 
You paused in the doorway  <br> 
As though a thought stole you away  <br> 
I watch the world pull you away&quot; 
</p>

<p>The Woman has acquired this metaphorical house and key. She is full of 
&quot;anxiety&quot; over this crime to the patriarchal tradition. She locks the door. However, 
she has to pay dearly for this victory. She has stepped into her own trap. She has her 
own house, but she has lost the world: 
</p>

<p>&quot;I'm barred and bolted.. and I  <br> 
Won't letcha in&quot; 
</p>

<p>Has the woman in &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; really conquered her own woolfian 
house, from which she can develop her distinctly feminine universe? No, the scenario 
is a bit more complicated than that: 
</p>

<p>&quot;This house is as old as I am  <br> 
This house knows all I have done&quot;  <br> 
This house, that becomes a picture of the woman herself, is  <br> 
&quot;(This house is) full of m-m-m-my mess  <br> 
This house is full of m-m-mistakes  <br> 
This house is full of m-m-madness&quot; 
</p>

<p>It is a house that still is &quot;built&quot; by men, and as architects they have defined the 
house's/the Woman's shape and being. Against this monstrous binding the Woman 
has to oppose by dressing up in the masculine metaphor of aggression: 
</p>

<p>&quot;This house is full of, full of, full of, full of fight&quot; 
</p>

<p>A fight both inside the Womans house and with the Man from the outside, who 
acts as the seductive Devil's Advocate of the tradition, and who tries to force his way 
in into her fictive house with promises and threats: 
</p>

<p>&quot;Woman let me in  <br> 
Let me bring in the momories  <br> 
Woman let me in  <br> 
Let me bring in the Devil dreams&quot;  <br> 
The attemps to acquire the Womans fictitious house seems to fail:  <br> 
&quot;I will not let you in  <br> 
Don't you bring back the reveries  <br> 
I turn into a bird  <br> 
Carry further that the word is heard&quot; 
</p>

<p>But don't be fooled. The Womans attempt to escape as a bird is just going to 
bring her out into a world controlled by men. And this romantic metaphor, the bird, 
does not have sufficient force. It's song does not have the force to resist the Man. 
The Temptor suggests this when he in the shape of air tries to bind the bird/the 
Woman with a (cold) kiss, the binding touch of love: 
</p>

<p>&quot;I turn into the wind  <br> 
I blow you a cold kiss  <br> 
Stronger than the song's hit&quot; 
</p>

<p>Yet the Woman resists in an ironic manner. She decides to enter a strange 
compromise: 
</p>

<p>&quot;I will not let you in  <br> 
I face toward the wind  <br> 
I change into the mule  <br> 
'Hee-haw'  <br> 
'Hee-haw'&quot; 
</p>

<p>Into a mule. Both the Man and the Woman has in fact been transformed into this 
mixture of different elements. This would suggest that no-one has won, that none of 
them has managed to kill the other, because &quot;As we will show, the images of 
'angel' and 'monster' have been so everpresent in the male litterature that these 
images have also penetrated women's writing to such a degree that women definitly 
have 'murdered' one or the other figure&quot; (p. 17). 
</p>



<p> &quot;IS THERE SO MUCH HATE FOR THE ONES WE LOVE&quot; 
</p>

<p>&quot;What concerns all the nonsense that Henry and Harry were talking about, the 
necessetiy of &quot;I am God&quot; to be able to create (I assume they mean &quot;I am God, I am 
not a woman&quot;) - this &quot;I am God&quot;, that mokes the creation to an act of loneliness and 
pride, this picture of God that creates heaven, earth and sea, this is the picture that 
has confused women.&quot; (Madw., Anais Nin, p. 3). 
</p>

<p>In &quot;Running up that Hill/Deal with God,&quot; the first song on Kate Bush's latest 
record &quot;Hounds of Love/The Ninth Wave&quot; (-85), we meet a scenario not unlike the 
one proposed by Anais Nin. We here meet the Woman who would, very much, like 
to arrange a swap with God or somebody in a similar position: 
</p>

<p>&quot;And if I only could  <br> 
I'd make a deal with God  <br> 
And I'd get him to swap our places&quot; 
</p>

<p>A swap like that would make the woman able to control the outer world, from 
which she locked herself in in &quot;Get Out of My House.&quot; And she would no longer run 
away from something, escape, she would run with aim, with direction. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Be running up that road  <br> 
Be running up that hill  <br> 
Be running up that building&quot; 
</p>

<p>This song, that I will refrain from exploring in greater depth due to the length of 
this article, describes a Woman, &quot;free&quot; from &quot;anxiety&quot;. 
</p>

<p>In the next song, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; we meet this Woman's direct opposite, the 
mirror image, let us call her an innocent Snow White. The opening line of the song 
is not written on the lyric sheet. It says &quot;Symmetry! It's coming,&quot; and I think it 
suggests an attempt to &quot;repair&quot; the previous song's - in the patriarch's eyes - 
dangerous wishes. 
</p>

<p>Here we meet Snow White, as we have chosen to call her, as an innocent child, 
filled with fear as to what the outer world (dominated by men) has to offer: 
</p>

<p>&quot;When I was a child  <br> 
Running in the night  <br> 
Afraid of what might be  <br> 
Hiding in the dark  <br> 
Hiding in the street&quot; 
</p>

<p>Then the text returns to the present where we meet the Woman, confused by 
what Anais Nin called &quot;this image of God as lone creator of heaven, earth and sea, 
this is the picture that has confused the woman.&quot; 
</p>

<p>&quot;I've always been a coward  <br> 
And I don't know what's good for me&quot; 
</p>

<p>This Woman is chased by the Hounds of Love, a repressive love that strives to 
keep her down by pointing out that her will is not independant. By doing this the 
woman, in my eyes, is transformed into a &quot;Monkey of the Working Class,&quot; or, I 
should say, into a different kind of bird than we are going to meet later - not into 
&quot;this Blackbird&quot; - but into a parrot. The Woman, who, in &quot;Running up that Hill&quot;, 
wanted to swap places, puts herself back into &quot;her proper place&quot;. By making the 
Woman confused, the Hounds of Love make her repent; she'll feel better if she 
remains in her prescribed role: 
</p>

<p>&quot;I've always been a coward  <br> 
And never knows what's good for me  <br> 
Here I go - Don't let me go - Hold me down...&quot; 
</p>

<p>And continues: 
</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know what I really need  <br> 
Do you know what I really need  <br> 
I need love, love, love, love...&quot; 
</p>

<p>In these two songs the listener/reader has been presented with both (Song 1) a 
kind of theme for development or dramatization of the Woman who must acquire 
the male (and phallic) pen in order to not (Song 2) continue to be a hunted victim, a 
Snow White fleeing through shadows, forests and streets. Or put in another way: 
&quot;Patriarchal texts have traditionally suggested that every angelic, unselfish Snow 
White must be hunted, if not haunted, by an evil and selfish stepmother; for every 
glowing portrait of humble women trapped in family life, there exists an equally 
important negative picture that encorporates the blasphemous devilishness that 
William Blake called 'The female will'&quot; (p. 28). 
</p>

<p>But as the quote indicates, every Snow White has to have an opposite, a negative 
mirror image. We get a glimpse of her in the fourth song, &quot;Mother Stands for 
Comfort.&quot; We meet the child that has - in her own opinion - done somehing that is 
illegal. The Mother knows this, but keeps silent: 
</p>

<p>&quot;She knows that I've been doing something wrong  <br> 
But she won't say anything&quot;  <br> 
...  <br> 
&quot;Mother stands for comfort  <br> 
Mother will hide the murderer&quot; 
</p>

<p>This fits the child well as the mother lets the child live out its monstrous 
aggressiveness (the child as murderer), the opposite of the harmless Snow White. 
Still, the child is bothered by this situation, because the aggressiveness has come to 
her from the outside, it has not been created by herself. 
</p>

<p>&quot;It breaks the cage, fear escapes and take possesion  <br> 
Just like a crowd rioting inside&quot;  <br> 
&quot;It&quot; makes her do things:  <br> 
&quot;Make me do this, make me do that, make me do this  <br> 
Make me do that&quot; 
</p>

<p>Is she the hunted or is she the hunter? In the mothers eyes she is hunted, not a 
hunter, and here we might see a thematic conflict. The mother, the very sign of 
&quot;comfort&quot;, chooses to see her daughter as an innocent victim, an unselfish Snow 
White. The child sees herself as someone who has taken on the image of a very 
young stepmother and acted out a symbolic murder. The murder can be interpreted 
both as a murder of Snow White and as an acquisition of the male pen. 
</p>

<p>Is this an elegant dramatization, from the Woman who wants to &quot;make a deal 
with God&quot;, to a fully developed &quot;son&quot;, a Woman who must accept and enter the male 
world on these terms, by becoming a man? With the last song of &quot;The Hounds of 
Love&quot;, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, with it's music filled with victory, one is tempted to answer 
&quot;yes&quot;. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is directed towards a father figure, Daddy, as opposed to the last 
songs Mother/Mum-figure. The father represents something ambigous the same 
way the mother does. Kate Bush here uses an image of rain for Daddy: 
</p>

<p>&quot;You're making rain  <br> 
and you're just in reach  <br> 
when you and sleep escapes me&quot; 
</p>

<p>She has used this image in &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; from &quot;The Dreaming&quot;: 
</p>

<p>&quot;This house is as old as I am  <br> 
This house knows all I have done  <br> 
They come with all their weather hanging  <br> 
around them&quot; 
</p>

<p>This rainmaker as equated with a luminous yo-yo. What made the yo-yo unique 
- the fact that if was luminous - was also what made it dangerous. Therefore it had 
to be buried, hid away, let us call it &quot;repressed&quot;. 
</p>

<p>&quot;You're like my yo-yo  <br> 
that glowed in the dark  <br> 
what made it special  <br> 
made it dangerous  <br> 
so I bury it and forget&quot; 
</p>

<p>The rainmaker has this luminous ability, he is a sort of god on earth with creative 
superiority. This makes him dangerous. Why? 
</p>

<p>&quot;Everytime it rains  <br> 
you're here in my head  <br> 
Like the sun coming out&quot; 
</p>

<p>This makes the cycle of nature, which God created - this image of male creativity 
- defined, every time, as a male act. And it is this luminous symbol of manhood that 
has to be buried if the Female is not to remain a dominated culture. Or it has to be 
sublimated, posessed and become a natural part of her. It seems as if this is what 
happens - or what is at stake - in &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; described as the Womans change 
into the Rainmakers son. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Oooh, I just know that something good is going to happen  <br> 
And I don't know when  <br> 
But just saying it could even make it happen&quot; 
</p>

<p>The song ends with this symbolic transformation: &quot;Oh, God, Daddy - I won't 
forget 
</p>

<p>Your son's coming out&quot; 
</p>

<p>In the second part of this record, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, which is an allusion to 
Tennyson's &quot;The Coming of Arthur&quot;, we meet a somewhat different thematization 
of this situation than we have encountered earlier. However, here it is not the 
acquisition or the destruction of this &quot;I am God&quot; as symbol of creativity that is 
focused on. Instead we meet the exploration of female motives that one could call 
The Mirror Motive, The Painful Discovery that The Other Woman, The Monster or 
The Mad Woman in the Attic, in fact is the Woman herself. 
</p>

<p>Let me start with he closing lines of the first song, &quot;And dream of Sheep,&quot; where 
the journey starts when &quot;They&quot; say that they are going to bring the Woman (that has 
acquired the light in &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;) home: 
</p>

<p>&quot;And they say they take me home.  <br> 
Like poppies, heavy with seed.  <br> 
They take me deeper and deeper.&quot; 
</p>

<p>This &quot;home&quot; soon reveals itself as a gallery of images of women that the Woman 
has earlier been bound to. In &quot;Under Ice&quot; we are presented with the Mirror Image 
and the Other Woman. The woman above the ice is skating and enjoys the speed and 
the control. The the picture is soon changed: 
</p>

<p>&quot;In the ice, splitting, splitting sounds  <br> 
Silver heels, spitting, spitting snow&quot; 
</p>

<p>Something is moving, trapped under the ice. One is tempted to equate the ice to a 
mirror. There is something that's trying to break free, but it doesn't seem to 
manage it. In one - frozen - moment the skater painfully realizes that this 
dangerous something that is trying to get out, is herself, trapped behind this scarred 
ice-mirror. 
</p>

<p>In &quot;Waking the Witch,&quot; a song with Faustian shape, with the witchtrial as theme 
- throwing the witch into the water to see if she floats - we meet a scene where the 
witch is going to confess her sins to a Priestly figure. &quot;Under&quot; this scene we can also 
hear another voice, the trapped bird we almost met in &quot;Get Out of My House,&quot; but 
that changed into a mule. One of the reasons is explained here. The bird, now a 
&quot;Blackbird&quot;, is described as tied, trapped. 
</p>

<p>&quot;(Help this blackbird, there's a stone round my leg)&quot; 
</p>

<p>Neither this metaphor or the witch-metaphor fits this Woman who wants to see 
her &quot;real&quot; mirror image. Both the witch and the blackbird is in the domain of the 
water which is the domain of the patriarchy. Something that is expressed in the line 
&quot;I am responsible for your actions,&quot; which is said by the Priest, a hellish figure in 
&quot;Waking the Witch.&quot; 
</p>

<p>One could carry on, dig deeper in. And I will, but I will only sketch it out, as I 
have already written too much. In &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; we meet the 
Invisible Woman in &quot;her fathers house,&quot; where she is reduced to nothingness, where 
she comes and goes like a ghost. The invisibility does, however, give her one 
advantage. She can objectify Him, explore Him and at least have her invisibility and 
freedom of motion to herself. 
</p>

<p>&quot;You didn't hear me come in  <br> 
	 You won't hear me leaving&quot; 
</p>

<p>One should say more. But that will have to do, even though we haven't been 
introduced to the old woman, the Fortune Teller in &quot;Jig of Life&quot; or the Woman in 
&quot;Hello Earth&quot; that has replaced God and is controlling the world for a while, or the 
Woman in &quot;The Morning Fog&quot; who is reborn, but really just &quot;repairs&quot; everything she 
has done when she conquered &quot;the light,&quot; how she becomes a nice girl again and fills 
the role as an all-loving mother: 
</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell my mother  <br> 
I'll tell my father  <br> 
I'll tell my loved one  <br> 
I'll tell my brothers  <br> 
How much I love them&quot; 
</p>

<p>You'll have to look yourselves. What is left is simply a classical summation of 
what is caught in the article's mirrorframe: &quot;And when self-concieving women from 
Anne Finch to Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson stepped out of the glass coffin of 
male-authorized text, when they burst out of the queen's mirror, the old dance of 
death turned into a dance of triumph, a dance of authority.&quot; 
</p>





<p>Well, could anybody out there understand my English? I won't make any 
comments on the article, as this is much too long already. Just one thing: The 
opening line to &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; should probably be &quot;It's in the trees! It's coming!&quot; 
Well, that's it.
