      <BR> Subject: Faith Brown &quot;Three Little Fishes&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&gt; On 1 March 80, Faith Brown, a British comedian with her own
      television show and infamous for doing Kate Bush parodies (along with
      Pamela Stevenson, who is now on SNL), did a parody of Kate Bush doing an
      interview and then she did a parody of Kate doing a cover of &quot;Three
      Little Fishes&quot;. I've never heard of this song before. Why is it
      appropriate for a parody of Kate Bush? </P>
    
    <P>Well, someone who didn't like Kate Bush's diction, or her tendency
      sometimes to sing/talk like a very young girl (e.g., &quot;All my words
      fade; What am I gonna say? Mustn't give the game away,&quot; etc.), would
      find it an appropriate song, because the entire &quot;Three Little Fishes&quot;
      song was in a sort of lispy &quot;baby talk&quot;; again I only remember
      the last line, which went </P>

    <P>Fu-Sheng said I should post this, so don't blame me. This song is from a
      British TV show called &quot;Not The Six O'Clock News&quot;. It was sung
      by Pamela Stevenson, now of ex-Saturday Night Live fame. (She's the one
      that had the tits that moved around. Cleary she is into tits....). The
      lyrics included are only as accurate as my ears. If anyone thinks they
      know how &quot;aresh aresh tomp pare hairdo&quot; should really read, or
      knows what a &quot;Cop Boutique&quot; is, please let me know: </P>

    <P>A while back I seem to recall someone asking why &quot;Up your's, ugly&quot;
      was engraved in the center of one of Kate's singles [TWW-picture disk].
      Well, it seems it's a Young Ones reference (as I discovered this weekend
      during a massive YO-fest). At one point in &quot;Sick&quot; Vyvyan's mum
      shows up and gives him a bottle of vodka. He eagerly unwraps it and
      discovers it's all been drunk, and she says something to the effect of &quot;Ha,
      got you! Up your's ugly!&quot; and leaves. This was a particular
      disappointment to Vyv, as he had earlier wasted his last bottle trying to
      blow up Ric and Neil. </P>
    
    <P>Man, I had forgotten just how funny this thing is. We all barely made it
      past the &quot;tell tale garden Gnome&quot; bit. </P>

    <P>this is more or less a transcription of the live bit in which the Young

      trying to get a snog off Kate Bush? </P>

    <P>&gt;Just a short comment about the Kate Bush bit on the Young Ones: Of
      the rather large number of YO episodes I've seen, I've been unlucky enough
      to miss the one dealing with KT. It sounds like a gem... :) -- Deb Wentorf
    </P>
    
    <P>Well, that's because it's not really from The Young Ones. It's from the
      British version of Comic Relief, c. 1986. Immediately after the
      conversational bit that was quoted, the announcer says something like, &quot;Well
      in that case, Kate Bush:&quot; Cheers ring out in the audience as the
      curtain rises, and Kate is seen behind a piano. She sings &quot;Breathing&quot;.
      Truly beautiful. </P>

    <P>Because I am the coolest person in the world, I get to find out about
      all sorts of neat things. Thanks to the second coolest person in the
      world, who, by an amazing coincidence, works in the office next to mine, I
      now have in my sweaty little hands a copy of Neil's Heavy Concept Album.
      (That's Neil the hippy dude from the Young Ones, for those of you who are
      slow on the uptake.) </P>
    
    <P>Take it away, Neil: </P>
    
    <P>...and another sixties type number on the album is a song called HURDY
      GURDY MAN which I wrote one night in my sleep no you didn't yes I did, you
      didn't write HURDY GURDY MAN, Donovan did, oh yeah? who are you then? I'm
      Donovan, you're not Donovan, you look much too straight to be Donovan, yes
      I am, I'm Donovan, oh yeah if you're Donovan I'm Meatloaf, well if you're
      Meatloaf I'm Kate Bush, oh come on you don't look anything like Kate Bush,
      well nor does Donovan... well anyway HURDY GURDY MAN is like about
      universal peace and understanding and harmony and really important shit
      like that... </P>

    <P>Date: Fri, 12 May 1995 21:24:35 GMT
      <BR> From: James Hogan &lt;James@absfabs.demon.co.uk&gt;
      <BR> Subject: Leotard Revealed </P>
    
    <P>Peter Brewis, the writer of &quot;England My Leotard&quot; or &quot;EML&quot;
      :), contacted me and I lost no time in getting the essential information
      on the Kate credit mystery. Here are his answers to my questions. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; - If you have the lyrics in computer format can you e-mail them to
      me ? </P>
    
    <P>Done. I had them in my head. </P>
    
    <P>(I have not received them yet but will post as soon as I get them). </P>
    
    <P>&gt; - Why does the Album cover entry say (Kate Bush)/ Kate Bush Music
      Ltd. </P>
    
    <P>You guessed right: there were copyright problems. When Kate Bush's
      publishers EMI got wind of the song being put out on an album I was
      summoned to a meeting with their lawyers who said I'd ripped off Them
      Heavy People. I said, 'The tune's different, the harmony's different, the
      bass line's different and the words are different. It's a different song'.
      They said, 'But your song wouldn't have been written if Them Heavy People
      hadn't existed'. Yep - true enough. 'And that makes it a breach of
      copyright', they said. So there you are: in this country you can't send up
      any song that's still in copyright. Not The Nine O'Clock News was
      extremely popular at the time, so the album stood to sell squillions. They
      agreed to let the song go on the album as long as they (and Kate Bush) got
      my share of the money. And they insisted on that wording: 'by Kate Bush.
      Lyrical pastiche by Peter Brewis'. Sounds really Edwardian doesn't it?
      Lyrical pastiche. 'And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, for your amusement I
      should like to perform a lyrical pastiche'. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Was Kate involved in any way in the production ? If not did you
      discuss the item with Kate and what was her reaction etc. </P>
    
    <P>No, she wasn't and we didn't. I heard, soon after the show was first
      broadcast, that she was a bit angry about it. Then a year or so later I
      asked a friend of mine who'd been working with her if she'd ever mentioned
      the song. 'Yeah - we were talking about it. She thought it was funny'.
    </P>
    
    <P>&gt; - What is the story behind the record. </P>
    
    <P>You mean the song? Well, I wrote it, made a demo tape of me singing it
      to give to Pamela Stevenson for her to learn it, booked four or five
      musicians, a couple of backing singers and a studio. The bass-player was
      having an off-day and I got a bit impatient, but we got the backing track
      recorded in a couple of hours. The musicians went home. Pamela Stevenson
      arrived and listened to the backing track a couple of times before we
      started recording it. On the first take she sang the first line, 'I was
      into yin and yang and hatha yoga' and said, 'can I hear that back?' I
      said, 'You've only done one line!' </P>
    
    <P>So bit by little tiny bit we got it recorded. She said she thought the
      line 'my carrot quiches were better than the bought ones' would be better
      if it was 'cauliflower quiches'. Never defensive about my finely-honed,
      expertly-crafted lyrics I agreed to change it. (Well - I argued with her
      for half an hour about it THEN I agreed). For the rest of the session,
      whenever we got to that line, the engineer and I would sing, 'My
      cauliflower quiches were better than the carrot ones'. </P>
