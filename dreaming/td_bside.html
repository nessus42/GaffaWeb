<P>On the subject of Kate's cover of Donovan's &quot;Lord of the Reedy River&quot;...

</P>
<P>&gt; Of course, Kate herself recorded this song, and put it out as the
b-side of the  single Sat In Your Lap in 1981. A rumour persists that Donovan
actually contributed a  bit of backing vocal on Kate's track, though this has
not been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>This is not a rumour! I know I've seen an interview with Kate where she said
 that she couldn't decide between doing a Captain Beefheart cover or a Donovan 
cover, but that the issue was decided when she got a chance to get Donovan to
come  into the studio with her to help out on the song.

<P>Lord of the Reedy River
</P>
<P>From the Garden:&quot;...a rumour persists that Donovan himself contributed
backing  vocals to the recording. ...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yesterday I met a friend, who showed me a magazine called &quot;Donovan's
friends,  No. 1, an official Donovan publication&quot;. It's from around 82/83
and it contains the  following brief Kate interview: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush meets 'the lord of the reedy river' 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Among many others, but in my opinion none have matched Kate Bush for her 
stunning version of 'The Lord of the Reedy River'. Kate gave the song a new
angle  and her interpretation was very highly imaginative. Not a lot of people
are aware of  the fact that Donovan himself sings the harmony vocals on her
version, so with the  help and co-operation from Lisa of the Kate Bush Fan Club,
I asked Kate how it all  came about. As this is the only cover version she has
ever put on vinyl. &quot;I had  recorded 'Sat in your Lap' and at the time I
never had anything to go on the B-side  and I can remember at the time seeing
Donovan on the TV. I hadn't seen him on  the telly for nearly eight years, and
there he was on quite a few programmes, it  seemed everywhere I looked there was
Donovan, it was a very strange feeling,  something seemed to point me in his
direction, then I started to play 'HMS  Donovan' which is my all time favourite
album. It was then I decided to record  'The Lord of the Reedy River' because
it's such a beautiful song. So I phoned  Donovan up and asked him for his
permission to record the song, and he was so nice  about it all, that I asked
him if he would like to do some harmony vocals and he said  'Yes', and of
course, he did.&quot; 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>- thank you Kate for all your help, all the best for the future.
Unfortunately, this  amazing version of 'Lord of the Reedy River' can only be
found on the B side of  'Sat in your Lap'. ...&quot; 
</P>
<P>(unsigned) 
</P>
<P>end credits in the magazine: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Our special thanks to all my friends in music, for all their help,
encouragement  and good vibes, in the making of this magazine. They are ... Kate
Bush, Lisa ...(here  I left out several names) and my Lady of the Stars Linda.&quot;
Donovan. 
</P>
<P>I don't know if this is a new information for everyone, but maybe for you?

</P>
<P>Hello friends, 
</P>
<P>a while ago I posted an interview quote from a Donovan mag. where Kate
reveals  that Donovan is indeed singing backing vocals on 'Lord of the Reedy
River'. 
</P>
<P>Recently I found another interview quote: 
</P>
<P>Kate: ...so far we have finished one single and the B-side, which is really
great - a  Donovan song. I've always wanted to do one of his songs, because I've
admired  his music and his voice for years. I decided to do this song and
through a  coincidence it started happening. Someone asked me what I was doing
for the  B-side while we were watching a Crystal Gayle show on TV. I was telling
them I  was going to do this Donovan song and all of a sudden Crystal Gayle
said, '...and  now my very special guest is Donovan' and you know we hadn't seen
him on  TV for years and years. It was really like it was right. 
</P>
<P>Sally: Fate. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yes, and he came into the studio and did some backing vocals which is
really  great because I've always wanted to work with him. 
</P>
<P>(Sally James' almost legendary pop interviews, Eel Pie 1981) 
</P>
<P>I think, this is interesting. 
</P>
<P>Best wishes 
</P>
<P>Wieland 
</P>
<P>PS: In the same Sally James interview: 
</P>
<P>Sally: But you started writing when you were eleven. Where did the ideas for
 writing come from? It's quite unusual for people of that age to actually write 
songs. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yes. I think a lot of it might have been to do with the things inside
me and  realizing how much pleasure music had given to other people I'd seen.
Maybe it  was because I had to play alone a lot. 
</P>
<P>Sally: Were you quite a solitary child then? 
</P>
<P>Kate: I had no friends of my own age until I went to school and those
friends lived  quite a way from me. And my brothers, who were a bit older than
me, were out  doing other things. 
</P>
<P>Sally: So you had to amuse yourself? 
</P>
<P>Kate: I spent a lot of time by myself. 
</P>
<P>PPS: Re the God-issue 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate speaks with the voice of the Oneness, because she's just a little
closer to  God than the rest of us.&quot;  (John C. Bush)

<P>Date: Thu, 8 Dec 88 08:09:21 PST <BR> From: Douglas Weiman &lt;WEIMAN@SRI-NIC.ARPA&gt;
<BR> Subject: Ne T'Enfuis Pas 
</P>
<P>I want to explain my recent statement that I thought &quot;Ne T'Enfuis Pas&quot;
was  Kate's (actually *anybody's*) best work. I still think this is true - it is
the most  *complete* song I have ever heard. 
</P>
<P>The production sounds deceptively simple, but if attention is paid, all
sorts of  things are happening musically in the background and foreground. The
stark  percussion, the &quot;shaker sound&quot;, the pathos of the slowly
undulating melody, and the  &quot;stop on a dime&quot; ending fit together to
form a perfect musical line. 
</P>
<P>Lyrically, it is equally fantastic. For those who haven't seen the
translation, here it  is: 
</P>
<P>I am coming like a cat <BR> through the night so black, <BR> You are
waiting <BR> and I fall <BR> into your white wings, la la la, <BR> And I sink
<BR> and I fly <BR> like a feather 
</P>
<P>If the big eyes of my God <BR> were not watching me <BR> I would steal you
away 
</P>
<P>Don't fly away -<BR> You have wings, <BR> the power to leave me <BR> You
fell from the sky <BR> like an angel, la la la, <BR> And I am afraid <BR>
that the sky will take you back 
</P>
<P> If the big eyes of my God <BR> were not watching me <BR> I would steal
you away 
</P>
<P>I am coming like a cat <BR> through the night so black, <BR> I beg you
<BR> I beg you <BR> Don't fly away 
</P>
<P>These are the most mysterious lyrics Kate has ever written. There are very
few  clues as to who is singing, and who they are singing to. Is the &quot;narrator&quot;
a male or  female? Kate has taken the male perspective in other songs (Ran Tan
Waltz,  Hammer Horror, etc.). There is some kind of forbidden love relationship
in the  works, but unlike &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;, it is not clearly
defined. The narrator is feeling  confusion towards the subject - how can
somebody be sinking and flying at the same  time? Also, it seems that a great
part of the forbiddeness of the relationship is  self-imposed by the narrator.
The image of the &quot;desired&quot; being taken back to the  sky can refer to
death or just abandonment. The narrator also seems to have some  fear of the
desired, who has the &quot;power to leave me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The narrator is portrayed in images of darkness -- the cat, the night so
black;  while the desired is shown to be light -- white wings, an angel. An age
or perhaps  class gap between the two people is implied. The &quot;big eyes of
my God&quot; reflect not  only a societal wrong in the relationship, but also a
more inner turmoil within the  narrator. The lyrics only *seem* simple on first
glance, but I think there are almost  endless possibilities regarding the
interpretation of this piece, hence the fascination.  Also, the vowel strings of
the French language allow Kate's emotion to show the  struggle, the emotion, and
the desperation of the song. The hodge-podge of sounds  of the English language
would not have been nearly as effective had the song been  done in English. 
</P>
<P>I stand by my statement - this is the best song Kate has ever done. I never
hear it  where I don't have to stop what I am doing and wait for the song and
the spell to be  completely cast before I can continue whatever I was doing. I
would welcome  people's ideas as to their interpretation of the song.

</P>
<P>&gt; I would welcome people's ideas as to their interpretation of the song. 
</P>
<P>I agree basically with what you're saying. I thought there was some sort of 
undesirability element in there based on the dark/light imagery, but you've
pretty  well nailed that end of the song down. I have nothing more to add other
than to say  that the first 50 or so times I heard it I had no clue as to the
lyrics (other than &quot;je  t'en prie, ne t'enfuis pas&quot;) and I thought it
was the most moving, beautiful song  Kate had ever recorded. At this point, it's
neck and neck between this one and  &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;... If only
it were out on CD, it would probably be the  winner...

<P>Date: Fri, 09 Dec 88 10:58 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Ne T'enfuis pas 
</P>
<P>IED read with great interest Doug Weiman's persuasive article about Ne 
T'enfuis pas. IED actually used to feel pretty much the same way Doug does now. 
He was convinced that that recording was one of the most perfect and complex 
pieces of music ever made --certainly in pop-music history. When, after the 
eighty-millionth listening (and already into his third or fourth copy of the
single), he  then discovered the vocal (Fairlight) melody in the introduction
--before the main  vocal begins, and so low in the mix that it had slipped by
his attention for  weeks--with its attendant harmony in fifths, he became
convinced of the essential  accuracy of his judgement. Musically, Ne T'enfuis
pas is an absolute jewel. 
</P>
<P>As for the lyrics, IED sees the truth in what Doug says about them. Kate 
composed the song initially in French, using what little she felt confident of
on her  own, and then going to French friends for help in bringing the rest of
the &quot;story&quot;  into idiomatic French. The result is--IED is happy to
say--excellent, from a linguistic  point of view. As to the multivalence of the
lyrics' meaning, IED does not disagree  with Doug. 
</P>
<P>Kate has never discussed the process of recording this track, as far as IED
is  aware. We know that she usually spends only a few days on b-sides--in
several cases  we know she actually recorded the b-side in one or two takes. But
she has never  talked about the specific recording of Ne T'enfuis pas or Lord of
the Reedy River  (which IED believes is just as important in terms of sound and
arrangement). It  seems impossible that she could have done these recordings in
only a day or two, but  who knows? 
</P>
<P>As to whether Ne T'enfuis pas is the greatest song, however, well...Let's
just say  that since The Ninth Wave was released, IED has found it difficult to
attach number  values to specific recordings. But it's definitely up there.
