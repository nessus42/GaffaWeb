IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: Interview revisited 
</P>
<P>[This is IED's very first message!!]
</P>
<P>Hi, Kate fans. A. Marvick responding to unexpectedly voluminous verbiage
from  parts East and elsewhere. Knowing nothing about inter-computer
communication as  yet, I may frequently commit gaffes of user etiquette. Please
bear with me.  Concerning Douglas Allen's interview (New York, 11/20/85) with
Kate Bush, I was  very happy to find that among the questions he posed were two
which I consider to  be of incalculable importance, to wit: 
</P>
<P>1) What did the new &quot;backward track&quot; (from &quot;Watching You
Without Me&quot;) entail  in the way of technical difficulties?; and 2) What
does she feed her cats?  Unfortunately for Mr. Allen, suitable follow-up time
either was not available, or was  cleverly and deliberately evaded by Kate
herself. No doubt the inadequacy of Kate's  replies to these two equally crucial
questions was intentional. 
</P>
<P>In the first case, the excerpt from &quot;Watching Me Without You&quot; was
designed, I  think it is clear, with the primary aim of intriguing the serious
(and at least mildly  obsessive) listener, and of encouraging him or her to
spend untold periods of time  puzzling over both its precise sonic make-up and
its root meaning, which latter I am  convinced is of considerable depth. The
solution of this passage is more important  than I can say, and I am certain all
readers are in total agreement on this point. It is  therefore not excessive
optimism on my part to expect that all readers will  henceforth make it a habit
to study this passage with a critical and analytical ear at  least once each day
until such time as an unassailable solution has been reached,  shared with the
international Kate Bushological community, and, after suitable  discussion among
students of the subject, ratified by the majority and approved -- if  possible,
through official channels -- by Kate herself. In future days, should interest 
prove sufficient, further details and theories in connection with the new  &quot;backwards&quot;
passage will emanate from this source. 
</P>
<P>In the second case, Kate's charming but too-brief reply indicates, I submit,
a  reluctance to consider, at least within the context of an interview for fans,
the  ultimate implications of her commitment to strict vegetarianism, and the
attendant  ethical dilemma which arises in the face of her equal devotion to the
rights and  dignity of all animals -- the instinctual carnivorous bent of the
domestic cat being,  arguably, one of that noble and elegant animal's rights by
nature. My sincere thanks  to everyone for their patience and consideration.
Responses, obviously, are  encouraged. Until they are received, may we all
continue in our venture INTO THE  GARDEN... 
</P>
<P>[Editorial note: I met Mr. Marvick in Romford, England, at the Kate Bush
Club  Convention at the end of last year, so it seems likely that there is now
another  Katefan almost as fanatical as I on the list. And if Hugh Maher
(another American  who was at the KBC Convention) ever figures out how to send
mail from the  University of Sussex, then there will be yet another. --Doug]

<P>Date: Fri, 02 May 86 14:01 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: KT ramblings 
</P>
<P>Mainly to Doug in re KT video trade: I haven't heard from you about my 
explanation of my KT video collection. I think it's possible I forgot to send it
to you  after writing it. This computer stuff is really messing me up. If
interested in  complete list, let me know. An edited version of the message
follows this one, just in  case. 
</P>
<P>Old message follows: 
</P>
<P>Dear Doug, 
</P>
<P>I appreciate your interest in getting a copy of the video I just had
transferred. I  have been collecting Kate video for the past three years now (it
took me four years  before I discovered other people even had any Kate video).
Regarding the digital  transfer I referred to, the word, which conjures up
images of crystal clear pictures,  is highly misleading in this case. I long ago
gave up any hope of collecting good copies  of Kate video, since every copy I've
ever been able to get hold of has been at least  third generation. 
</P>
<P>In this case, although I was told the transfer was done digitally, two
things lead  me to disbelieve this myself. First, the price ($48.00 for about 40
minutes) was  suspiciously low for digital service; and second, the picture is
not at all sharp and  seems compressed in a way similar to (although not as
severe as in) Cinimascope  film when projected from a normal 35mm projector. On
the other hand, previous  optical transfers of mine have a flicker which this
copy does not have, so who  knows? 
</P>
<P>On top of this, the original signal was not top quality at all. Now out of
these 40  minutes Kate herself only appears in about ten (unless you want to
count the official  videos which I'm sure you already have in a better version,
especially if you got a  copy of the Night Flight interview show on Kate, in
which &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and  &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; appeared in their
entirety, or the &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot; broadcast  just mentioned in
Love-Hounds Digest.) These ten or so minutes consist of a  lip-synch of RUTH
from TOTP which is extremely similar to that done on the  Wogan show, which, as
you know, was shown many times on MTV last October; and  a brief (about 3 or 4
minute) interview with Kate on Whistle Test. 
</P>
<P>The remaining time is filled up with chart listings from (I assume) TOTP and
 The Sky Channel -- these include nothing really new or of great interest to
serious  Kate fans. Now, I would be willing to make a transfer of this, or of a
larger  collection of rare Kate video edited by me (excising official videos
where they  appear, etc.) providing you were willing to send me blank tape and
money for  postage. But it's more complicated than that, I'm afraid, because all
my video is on  Beta, and I do not own a VHS machine. I could make a transfer of
a tape to VHS  for you, but it would mean more money for the rental of the VHS
machine. 
</P>
<P>The main reason I mentioned the video was in order to find out whether you
or  anyone else in Love-Hounds had equally rare Kate video to trade. Making some
 minor profit in dollars out of this doesn't interest me. I have been trying to
get a  copy of Kate's appearance on Saturday Superstore and her performance of &quot;Army
 Dreamers&quot; on Australian TV, among other things, for more than a year, but
have  met with no success as of yet. Above all, I am interested in acquiring a
copy of the  famous &quot;Dutch videos&quot; which were done, I think, in 1978
or so. There were at least 8  done, and I know that a copy exists somewhere in
North America (Dale Somerville  must have a copy, for example), but thus far I
have not even seen an excerpt from  them. If you are still interested, please
let me know what Kate video you have in  your collection, and I'll copy out a
list of my stuff, too. 
</P>
<P>As for the Vermorel book, of course I've got it! I've had Kate on the brain
since  March 1978, when I first heard &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; on Italian
radio. No item of  Kate-related ephemera with which I've come in contact since
then has gone  without my making a stab at acquiring it. But at this point, the
printed word,  especially in the form of now-out-of-date press releases,
interests me least, since I  too have so many xeroxes and ratty old clippings
from NMEs and Liverpool  newspapers, etc., that I don't know how to keep
anything in order anymore. The  rarest printed thing I have-- or at any rate the
most precious to me -- is a yellowed  and dog-eared copy of Harry Dougherty's
June 1978 piece on Kate from MM or  NME or Sounds (forget offhand), which was
the first Kate-related item I ever  bought (aside from records). There are now
very few Kate Bush artifacts which I  still covet. 
</P>
<P>One thing the convention taught me is that one can NEVER have a &quot;complete&quot;
 collection -- you saw how many dozens and dozens of badges there were there,
for  example. So, unless you have a copy of the tour programme to spare (ha ha),
or  extra Canadian mini-albums in colors other than green, or unneeded copies of
the  &quot;leather jacket&quot; or &quot;kimono&quot; posters, I'm afraid I
wouldn't be able to do much  trading of merchandise, especially since I've never
collected duplicates of anything  Kate-related except for records. 
</P>
<P>Thanks for the old Kate writings, which I have now read avidly. I have
translated  a recent French interview (actually the only one she gave, as far as
I know) which  must have been given directly following her return from North
America in late  November, and just preceding her appearance at the Romford
convention. I mean to  transfer it to Love-Hounds as soon as time permits. As
usual the interviewer is a  moron, but also as usual, this doesn't prevent Kate
from making it a good interview  (witness that lame-brain Tony Myatt in the
convention interview). Incidentally,  Homeground #22, being a glossy production
now, has been picked up by the  inter-continental magazine distributors here,
and a pile of them showed up in the  import stores. I've been told that there
has been a recent issue of Break-Through  published, but I've not been notified
by Dale about it. Have you any information? 
</P>
<P>As far as I can tell, Doug, you and I are the only hard-core fans of Kate 
contributing to Love-Hounds. I mean, Butthole Surfers and Foetus On Your Breath?
I  have nothing against these bands, not being familiar with their music, but
why so  little feedback on Kate Bush?

</P>
<P>As usual, all verbiage from this correspondent concerns KT and KT only. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>Partly out of a feeling of empathy for such a means of justifying one's
obsessions,  I have chosen to adopt Reich's pedantic forms and ponderous style
in dealing with  the work of Kate Bush, since this kind of obsessive interest in
another person's life  and work is better disguised, I think, when couched in
the dry-as-dust language of  the Orgonotic scholar.

</P>
<P>Just depleted life's savings on the top-of-the-line Sony 8mm table-top VCR.
Now  recording record collection (1700 plus and a real pain in the neck at this
point) onto  cute little 8mm video-cassettes -- used as an audio-recorder, this
model can fit 24  hours of music onto ONE cassette; amazing quality, too, and
virtually no machine or  tape noise; nearly like a CD. The thought of putting
every audio shred of Kate Bush  on one cassette (including every bit of
interview and every cover version) was too  hard to resist. Hoping to make up
the capital loss by selling record collection (save  for KT) when it's all
transferred. 
</P>
<P>In the process of re-recording her complete works I was able to hear the 
EARLINESS of her first LPs much more clearly (having been so caught up in 
Hounds of Love and The Dreaming for so many months now). Even Never For Ever  is
absurdly YOUNG-sounding Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>There is absolutely no question that, to date, The Dreaming and Hounds of
Love  constitute, collectively, the greatest achievement in 20th century Western
music.

<P>While on vacation in the Dairyland (Wisconsin, to be precise), IED met two 
people who noticed his KT t-shirt (the new U.S. one with the rainbow-colored
print  of the HoL cover). One felt she should fill him in on the details of
Kate's career.  &quot;She was discovered by Peter Gabriel, you know.&quot; The
other had this to tell him:  &quot;Woh, dude. Kate Bush, right? Woh. I don't
like her album {this presumably a  reference to Kate Bush's FIFTH album}. It's
all about a girlfriend of hers who died  of a heroin overdose. Rully
self-indulgent. Hey, but she does a rull sweet job on  &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;,
though. Woh, dude, rad, etc., etc., etc....&quot;

<P>&gt; From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.ARPA <BR> &gt; IED agrees that
there is no intrinsic merit in Big Country, only ancillary interest  stemming

immaterial. It is enough that they have worked with the greatest living human

<P>Kate Bush the &quot;greatest living human being&quot;??? That's ridiculous.

HIDEOUSLY boring.  I am not a Kate fanatic; hers is one of MANY musics, but I
read love-hounds for  everything NOT about her. She has been done to death. I'll

 Debussy and Ravel, trying to absorb their respective complete works for piano
solo);  and listened extensively to two of Ivo Pogorelich's recent CDs (his live
Warsaw  Chopin recital and the Ravel Gaspard de la nuit/Prokoviev 6th Sonata

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.ARPA <BR> Subject: Another KT-shirt design; and:
enKA-TExt 
</P>
<P>[re japanese music]
</P>
<P>Yes, John, IED has all of Hosono, Sakamoto, Takahashi, even Kenji Omura,
Akira  Mitake, Plastics and Melon, Tachibana, Urban Dance and Shi-Shonen (prod.
Hosono),  Akiko Yano, Sandii, etc. Not that he thinks all of this stuff is good
-- he dislikes early  Hosono and Takahashi's Sadistic Mika Band stuff, that
pre-YMO L.A./Little Feat  stuff is awful, or at least very dull. To IED's ears,
BGM was the first really  significant Japanese pop LP. Technodelic even finer.
Naughty Boys was a  retrogression in terms of attitude, though not
production-wise. Neuromantic was  exceptional, but Takahashi's style hasn't
fundamentally changed since then, only  gotten more and more enka-ish (i.e.
schlocky) -- although his sound is always  first-rate. As for Sakamoto, he's too
inconsistent as a solo musician for this taste;  Esperanto was excellent, as was
B-2 Unit, but Left-Handed Dream and The  Arrangement, as well as Picture Book
Music (Illustrated Musical Encyclopedia) and  the latest (Miraiho Yaru, or
Futurista) all show deplorable American-cum-Akiko  Yano influence. (Yano
herself, reputedly the &quot;Japanese Kate Bush, is, IED thinks,  tiresome,
silly and MOR, &quot;Rose Garden&quot; excepted.) 
</P>
<P>Hosono is great from Philharmony on, although SFX and The Making of 
Non-Standard Music are admittedly very light. His ambient LPs -- El Nokto in 
Galaxia, Co-Incidental Music, Mercuric Dance, Paradise View, The Endless Talking
 -- are very well done, but there's enough of it now to last a lifetime. As for 
Shi-Shonen and Urban Dance, well, they're not great artistic successes.
Interiors are  a bit better, but not very expert. P-Model and Friction are
execrable, and Phew! is  respectable but dull. Both of Miharu Koshi's LPs are of
the highest quality, and IED  has a weakness for the Susan's two
Takahashi-produced LPs: Do You Believe in  Mazik? and The Girl Can't Help It. 
</P>
<P>IED's personal favorite from Japan is Ippu-Do's Night Mirage, which is
exquisite  in its details, and gloriously effete and aestheticist. Tsuchiya's
Rice Music was very  respectable, though not as potent as Night Mirage, but his
latest (?), Tokyo Ballet, is  too main-stream rock for this listener, despite
one or two very refined tracks. 
</P>
<P>Equally fine, though only tangentially related, of course, is late Japan,
and its  members' various solo releases. The best of these are Sylvian's
Brilliant Trees and  Jansen/Barbieri's regrettably brief Worlds in a Small Room
(Japanese-only import).  Steve Jansen has reportedly released an album with
Yukihiro Takahashi in Japan,  and IED has heard that a 12&quot; single from it
has even been seen briefly in Tower,  although his searches have always proved
futile. It is called &quot;Stay Close&quot;. And of  course Sylvian has released
his next single, from the forthcoming double-LP (hope  that doesn't mean cuts
will be deleted from the CD): Gone to Earth. 
</P>
<P>Does John Lorch collect CDs of any of the above? IED suspects that Night
Mirage,  Live and Zen, Rice Music, Tokyo Ballet, Tutu, Parallelisme,
Neuromantic, B-2 Unit  and Immigrants are all out on CD in Japan, but for some
confounded reason no-one  in the U.S. is making any effort to import them. Does
John or anyone else out there  know anything about this issue? Even more
important, does anyone know if there  has been anything new from Susan or from
Miharu Koshi since, respectively, The  Girl Can't Help It and Parallelisme? The
Japanese are so prolific that it seems  unlikely there hasn't been a lot of
stuff from them in the past two years. The  problem in L.A. is that The Other
Side Records, which specialized in Japanese  imports, folded with the advent of
CDs, which have ruined the audiophile end of the  Japanese import business.

<P>IED recommends Treasure without hesitation as the first Cocteau Twins LP to 
buy. It is the first real flowering of the Cocteau Twins' sound, every track on
it has  real beauty, and the production is spectacular. Although it doesn't
sound like The  Dreaming, Treasure is comparable in that it is the Cocteau
Twins' breakthrough  album (albeit a breakthrough commensurate with the group's
insignificant status in  relation to that of KATE BUSH). The three subsequent
EPs (Aikea Guinea, Tiny  Dynamine and Echoes in a Shallow Bay) and the follow-up
album Victorialand are  all very close to Treasure in style and sound, but
increasingly lack (in IED's opinion,  of course) the substance and depth that
distinguishes Treasure. The records  preceeding Treasure (Head Over Heels,
Sunburst and Snowblind, etc.) are good, but  are more akin to Never For Ever
(only in the sense that they show signs of major  advances without really
standing as landmark works on their own). 
</P>
<P>Of course, the single most clearly Kate-influenced track of all by Cocteau
Twins  is the cover version of R. Harper's &quot;Another Day&quot;, sung by
Elizabeth Fraser. It's on  This Mortal Coil's only LP, a kind of collaborative
record featuring members of  various 4AD groups. No matter what anyone says
about Fraser's decision to sing this  song, there can be absolutely no doubt
that she saw the Kate Christmas special and  heard Kate's version of the song
with Peter Gabriel.

</P>
<P>It's easiest to answer all of the responses by responding to the best of the
 responses, so the following is in reference to Doug's posting. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Now, Andy, don't you think it a little silly to ask for &quot;concrete
evidence&quot; on  issues such as artistic quality? 
</P>
<P>A big question. As an art historian, I have to deal with this riddle all the
time.  Perhaps the term &quot;evidence&quot; was misused here. I intended to
invite just what you  did give, i.e. a system for forming personal preferences.
Perhaps there is no absolute  means of judging quality in art, but even if not,
this is no justification for simply  saying, &quot;I like it better, therefore
it is better&quot;. Whether they be invincible to  refutation or not, reasons
for such a judgment ought to be presented -- as you have  done. 
</P>
<P>... [HoL better than TD debate]...
</P>
<P>Please, then, allow me to identify myself as an exception to your
generality, since  I do consider myself to have been enlightened by her music,
yet do not prefer The  Dreaming. I am interested first and foremost in the MUSIC
of Kate Bush; second, in  the ancillary means of artistic expression which she
uses to amplify that music; and  third, in the great mystery which I see in the
fact that a living human being is  actually responsible for this art. In
self-defense, I'd like to testify that the first two  weeks of my obsession for
Kate Bush were based entirely on the sound of  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; on
Italian radio -- I had no idea what she herself looked like,  nor anything else
about her --not even that her name was Kate Bush or that she  spoke English!
During that period, the only thing that mattered to me in life was the  art in
that recording.

</P>
<P>Let IED apologize again to Blore (and to any others who may have felt the
ugly  sting of Andrew's temper, which tends to rise at intervals in response to
the  goadings of more dispassionate admirers of Kate). The ad hominem remarks
were  uncalled for, this cannot be denied. Henceforth let IED confine himself as
well as he  is able to the matters at hand. 
</P>
<P>&gt; The term &quot;over-produced,&quot; to me, indicates a piece of music
which has had too  much production done to it. 
</P>
<P>Words fail IED in the face of such a powerful argument! 
</P>
<P>&gt; In other words, something that would have sounded better with less
production. 
</P>
<P>Blore, don't you see how empty these comments are? &quot;Production&quot; is
a  GENERAL term -- there's production and there's production, it's not a
SPECIFIC  THING! You seem to be visualizing &quot;production&quot; as some kind
of sandwich spread:  an &quot;over-produced&quot; record is like a hotdog with
too much mustard! The point is,  production is about as vague a term as any in
modern music, and The Dreaming  offers perfect proof that a HEAVILY produced
record need not be an  OVER-produced record. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Take a listen to &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot;--one of the best cuts
on the album. No  balalaikas, no pan-flute, no digerido, in short (and to avoid
any further misspellings  of words not found in &quot;spell&quot;) a nice little
un-embellished song. 
</P>
<P>Blore, it's YOU who should take a listen to &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot;!
Really  LISTEN to it! &quot;A nice little un-embellished song&quot; -- it is
NONE OF THESE  THINGS. It's not &quot;nice&quot;, it's not &quot;little&quot;,
it's certainly not &quot;un-embellished&quot; -- hell,  it's not even strictly
speaking a &quot;song&quot;! 
</P>
<P>... 
</P>
<P>Then Doug writes: 
</P>
<P>&gt; Parts of Hounds of Love I also don't find as interesting musically. HoL
has more  harmony and less counterpoint than *The Dreaming*. Counterpoint is
better than  harmony. Baroque music and Stravinsky are better than Classical
music for this  reason. 
</P>
<P>This is all a big joke, right, Doug? You're not serious, are you? Because if
you're  serious, well...you'd just have to be joking. Of all the ridiculous
ideas in the world!  Counterpoint is &quot;BETTER&quot; than harmony!?!
Stravinsky &quot;BETTER&quot; than -- than  &quot;Classical music&quot;?! -- Do
you mean the WHOLE corpus of Western music from  Haydn through Rachmaninov,
including Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schubert,  Schumann, Brahms, Wagner,
Bruckner, Mahler, Debussy, etc., etc. -- !? Simply  because the former explored
one aspect of musical construction in a new way, and  the latter was more often
harmonically based? This has got to be the silliest idea  ever posted in
Love-Hounds, Doug. 
</P>
<P>(Anyway, if you're so sold on the contrapuntal in music, why isn't your

</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>At a more subjective and psychological analytical level. The EMAIL behavior
of  IED as exemplified by most of his recent behavior (nonwithstanding his
annoying (in  my opinion) third person presentations) suggests that he has gone
beyond that hazy  line which separates the connotative meanings of the words
'fan' and 'fanatic'. If  there was a Kate Bush religious cult, I'm sure that IED
would behave in similar  devotion as do the Scientologist followers of L. Ron
Hubbard. In fact, in order to  displace his apparent fellings of
selfworthlesness, I would suggest that IED find a  religious cult, with whom he
can affiliate, so that these longings for meaning can be  expressed in true cult
fashion. Although Kate Bush's music is arguably asthetic  appealing to most of
us that read this list, I doubt that many of us have a cult like  attitude
toward her work. Even Doug, her strongest non-brainwashed advocate, 
occasionally can find subtle problems or things he doesn't like about her work
(Of  course, much of Doug's behavior can be attributed to his over zealous
sexual  attraction to Kate, i.e., a matter to be settled with gonads, not
brain). 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>So, IED, as per a long winded discussion here last year about the critical
value of  using explicatives as adjectives or adverbs lacking any
'super-critical' clout, so too  your over zealous, pompus and fanatical comments
are probably erased daily by  people who still are in control of their own
choice behavior. We all know that you  are a Kate fanatic. Personally, I'm tired
of hearing about it. Maybe, you would do  better writing your EMAIL to
net.religion or somplace you might find others like  yourself (If there is no
cultlike talk in net.religion, I appologize for suggesting IED  write to your

<P>Thanks again, Doug. As those who are interested will understand from the
above  statement, IED's Bushological style is the result of his fascination with
-- and  imprisonment within -- the legacy of Western scholarship; a corpus of
work which,  arguably, finds its most compelling, frightening and disturbing
expression in the late  publications of the Orgonon Press. In his last years
Wilhelm Reich published, in  faultlessly learned and footnoted fashion, some of
the most shockingly psychotic, yet  disquietingly beautiful theoretical papers
that IED has ever found. It is unlikely that  anyone could, after reading them,
hear &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; in quite the same way again.  (N.B.: For hardcore
Kate fans only.)

== G*D 
</P>
<P>After fasting for 7 days and abstaining from sex, drugs, alcohol, and
industrial  music for the same period, I have finally come to the conclusion
that IED is G*d.  Either that, or he's pretty close. 
</P>
<P>How did I come to this conclusion, you understandably befuddled heathen
masses  may ask? Well, with my own eyes I have witnessed two feats of IED which
I thought  were impossible, and which will probably never be duplicated. By
definition, these  are &quot;miracles&quot;. 
</P>
<P>You see, IED has succeeded in pissing off two of the most calm, reasonable
and  tolerant people on the net. I never thought anyone could incite rossi or
gtaylor to say  anything that even approaches displeasure, but IED, in the space
of a few months,  has performed both impossible feats. 
</P>
<P>I now see the wisdom of IED, and accept his writings as &quot;the one true
way&quot;. At  least until I recover from temporary insanity, chemical
imbalance, constant migraine,  etc. 
</P>
<P>The 7 Commandments of IED, as far as I could infer from his holy writings: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I am the messenger of Kate thy G*d, 
</P>
<P>1) Thou shalt have no strange Gods before Kate. 
</P>
<P>2) Thou shalt not abuse the works of Kate, nor blaspheme against Kate by
claiming  that *anything* comes close to the works of Kate in perfeKTion. Kate
*is*  perfeKTion, Kate defines musical complexity and quality. 
</P>
<P>3) Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath day (Kate's birthday). 
</P>
<P>4) Thou shalt not kill, nor commit verbal abuse, except when involved in
verbal  tirades against enemies of Kate. 
</P>
<P>5) Thou shalt not commit adultery by claiming allegiance to any other than
Kate in  love-hounds. 
</P>
<P>6) The two greatest visual artists working in America these days are David
Lynch  and Terry Gilliam. It is blasphemy to claim that Jim Jarmusch, Woody
Allen,  Francis Ford Coppola, or anybody else even comes close. 
</P>
<P>7) Dune is a great movie, despite its snail-like pace, excessive self-
indulgence,  relatively shoddy look for all the money spent on it, ridiculous
design for stillsuits,  inappropriate overuse of voiceovers, and
pseudo-mystical/religious/philosophical  ending.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The above are, of course, religious *facts*, and anyone (me included) who
try to  argue them will burn in hell.

Message from A. Marvick re IED 
</P>
<P>Hi, folks, this is Andrew Marvick speaking. You haven't heard from me in 
Love-Hounds before, although my name is probably familiar to you. I'm writing to
 you myself because I'm a little worried about IED. (He's the guy I post
messages  for -- although, having very little interest in pop stars myself, I
rarely pay any  attention to what I write for him.) 
</P>
<P>It seems that this morning IED disappeared. I mean, he simply DISAPPEARED. 
Here's how it happened. I was awakened this morning by the sound of IED's car 
door slamming outside the house. I looked out the window in time to see his car 
driving off towards Pasadena (of all places!), and as he sped down the road I
thought  I could hear him screaming something about &quot;Poo-bah's&quot; and &quot;no
time to waste!&quot; I  didn't know what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>You know, most of the time IED just sits around in the back yard with an old
 Sony D-5 and some headphones --he's not in the habit of driving to Pasadena, I
can  tell you! Aside from sitting listening to a couple of Kate Bush albums over
and over  (pretty weird stuff if you ask me), all he ever does is dictate alot
of obsessive,  histrionic messages to me every day. Anyway, I thought no more of
it, but about one  this afternoon he returned home, carrying something in a
brown paper bag, and  slammed the door to his ROOM behind him. (IED NEVER goes
into his ROOM!) 
</P>
<P>I called through the door to him, asking if there was anything wrong, and he
gave  a pretty strange answer. I don't know what to make of it, but maybe you
Kate Bush  fans will understand what he was talking about. As near as I could
make it out, what  he said was this: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've been out in the Garden for sixteen months, and now I've come back
into  the House!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Anyway, the gist of the matter is that when I opened the door and went in to
ask  him what the devil he was talking about, he was gone -- there was NOBODY IN
 THE ROOM. Well, I mean to say, the twins (who are back in L.A. for a few weeks,
 on holiday from their home in the Kentish veldt) and I were more than a little
put  out at this sort of behaviour, even from a weird old get like IED. So I ask
you, what  are we to make of it? 
</P>

awful big, and there are no lights. <BR> No lights? Oh, you're right, no
electricity. 
</P>
<P> Well, o.k., we'll look for the fuse-box. <BR> Where is it? <BR> It's
usually in the basement. <BR> The basement? It's dark down there. <BR> Yeah,
but you've gotta risk something to gain something. <BR> O.K., let's hit the
stairs. HEY! It smells funny down here! <BR> What do you mean, 'funny'? <BR>
Well, kind of EARTHY... <BR> It's an earthen floor! There's ANIMALS down here. 
</P>
<P>Quick, forget the damn lights, <BR> Let's get out of here! <BR> Up, up!
Go! keep climbing, quick! <BR> Whew, what a relief! Fresh air, the fresh, dark
night air. <BR> Hey! We've gone all the way up to the roof! 
</P>
<P> Relax! 
</P>
<P>How do I relax? There's still no light, no moon... 
</P>
<P>Ssh! I hear something! 
</P>
<P> It's just music, squirming around the foundations of The House. <BR> Yeah,
and someone's down there, too, <BR> making alot of racket. I'm very worried!
<BR> Why? Nothing to worry about, love. 
</P>
<P> Worry rattles around in my head. I'm going <BR> downstairs again. <BR> Do
what you like, <BR> but you're being silly. <BR> Something may come <BR>
after you <BR> up there! 
</P>
<P>Come on, come downstairs NOW! 
</P>
<P>Down, down, down, and we're in the front parlor. <BR> Crepe covers the
windows. <BR> This is worse than death, 
</P>
<P> this is death with consciousness, <BR> death with pain, <BR> The pain
that brings the will to live and relive, <BR> To run for dark hills in the
open. 
</P>
<P> This is the sound of death, nevertheless; <BR> the cool, airy song of
death; <BR> the sweet, <BR> urgent sound <BR> of remorse. 
</P>
<P>Remorse carries me into life again. <BR> I'm still in the front parlor, but
the crepe has gone. <BR> I have hired strange agents <BR> To help relive.
<BR> Their vulgar interference is horrible, but what choice have I? <BR> We
must enter The House, or leave it, <BR> together or not at all. 
</P>
<P>And still it doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>SHUT THAT DOOR AGAIN, QUICK! <BR> SHUT IT! SLAM IT! LOCK IT! 
</P>
<P> Protect me from the wind, <BR> the dark wind hanging heavily overhead as
it flies, <BR> entreating me to give it a room. <BR> The House is love, The
House is complete. 
</P>
<P> The House is loved, The House is holy. 
</P>
<P>THAT'S IT! I AM THE HOUSE! 
</P>
<P>NOW YOU'VE GOT IT! THE HOUSE IS ME! 
</P>
<P>HERE IT IS! 	(My goal lies here,)<BR> THERE! 	(The dead of night calls)<BR>
WHO'S THAT? 	(For his goal is the same,)
</P>
<P> THIS IS THE END! 	(But he is not yet formed, as I.) <BR> THAT'S IT!
	(Protect me! Protect me!) <BR> HERE I WILL REMAIN! 	(Protect me from the cold
night wind of evil.) 
</P>
<P>COME TO ME! 	(Magician, help me now!) <BR> FACE ME! 	(Let me turn and
flee!) 
</P>
<P>FACE ME, DEAR! FACE THE BLACK, FROZEN BREATH OF LIFE!

Irregulars 
</P>
<P>&quot;Watson?&quot; &quot;Yes, Holmes?&quot; &quot;I'm afraid you're an
incorrigible bungler!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Dave's comments re WSI are re-assuring, but no, the new idea is not related
to  the now-stagnant Kovers projecT (your hypothesis #3). Thanks for your
concern,  Dave, but IED was not hurt or upset by your earlier remarks, not at
all. The delay in  answering is due to the fact that, on re-reading the
following explanation of the  WSI, it seemed to IED that he had failed to bring
across the essential uniqueness of  the hypothetical group -- it may still sound
a bit like Love-Hounds, something it has  very little in common with. This is
because the primary distinction of WSI is  philosophical, and IED is rotten in
philosophy. The main ideator of the WSI, by the  way, is not IED, but a
non-Love-Hound KT fan from Missouri. IED just thought it  was worth sharing with
the group, whether it inspires any reciprocal verbiage from  the pack or not. 
</P>
<P>  Announcing the formation of 
</P>
<P>T H E - W I C K H A M - S T R E E T - I R R E G U L A R S 
</P>
<P>The group discussions of the Wickham Street Irregulars differ from those of 
other Kate Bush fora in two crucial respects. First, they stem exclusively from
the  music and ideas suggested by Kate herself, and as such, they do not revolve
around  the daily trivia which surround Kate and her career. Second, they stem
from the  unanimous realization that there is no &quot;true&quot; interpretation
of the art of Kate Bush,  and that therefore mutual benefits and enlightenment
may be gained as much from  subjective, creative interpretations as from
objective, analytical ones. 
</P>
<P>Above all, the aim of the WSI texts is not necessarily to understand more
about  how Kate herself works and interprets her music, but to examine and
celebrate the  members' personal re-actions to it. 
</P>
<P>For example, the topics of the WSI may range from as tangible a subject as
the  pursuit of Wilhelm Reich by the FDA during the 1950s; to the personal
associations  of one contributor's childhood memories of sky-gazing -- even
though those  associations may bear, in the end, only the most tenuous links
with &quot;The Big Sky&quot;; to  a rambling narrative about the effects of
alpha-interferon on lunar cheese cultures,  conceived during an
angel-dust-listening to &quot;Houdini&quot;. 
</P>
<P>So long as the inspiration for or source of a contribution is genuinely 
Kate-related, its eligibility and appropriateness for the WSI, as well as its
essential  &quot;correctness&quot; -- its acceptance as an unassailable part of
the canon, doctrine and  outlook of the WSI -- will never be questioned. This
would mean, for example, that  if, say, Doug Alan's interpretation of &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; (chosen here because it is  well known to Love-Hounds), linking
many of its lyrics with the theme of Kate's  relationship with her fans, were
submitted to the WSI, it would not be -- could not  be -- refuted. Instead, it
would be absorbed into the communal WSI view of the  work of Kate, just as
though it had been proved to be a fact. In the long run,  interpretations as
personal as Doug's, treated as objective truth because of the  premium placed on
the subjective within the WSI, would begin to combine with and  enrich each
other, creating an increasingly elaborate super- (or sub-) structure of  WSI
doctrine, in much the same way that a role-playing game is slowly improved by 
the convolution of its various players' shared and mutually respected
imaginations. 
</P>
<P>The main medium of the WSI is paper, and early contributions have come from 
outside the computer world; but any Love-Hound who wishes to offer something to 
the WSI for inclusion in the WSIQ may simply post to Love-Hounds with a note 
requesting its inclusion in the WSIQ. 
</P>
<P>The postings and publications of the Wickham Street Irregulars constitute a 
mouthpiece for the thoughts, feelings and creative impulses of a particular
breed of  Kate fan: one who seeks an outlet for the expression of his or her
ideas, whether  their relevance to Kate's art is initially clear to others or
not; and one who is hopeful  of gaining insight and inspiration not only from
Kate's own work, but also from new  ideas for which Kate's art may be only the
catalyst. Above all, the WSI encourages  open discussion of its members' ideas,
in the belief that through the sharing of our  diverse imaginations and areas of
expertise, we may discover new things about  Kate's work -- and about ourselves.

</P>
<P>The proposed group was conceived under the influence of two entities: the
Baker  Street Irregular Quarterly, after which the WSIQ is modeled; and the
philosophical  implications which arise out of the discussion section of the
Meteorological mix of  &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. 
</P>

Irregulars, you are encouraged to enquire of Andrew Marvick (IED0DXM).

<P> Lisa of the Kate Bush Club has sent IED a note saying that she found a
recent  letter from him to be interesting enough to pass on to Kate personally.
That letter  had a careful description of Love-Hounds in it, so we can all rest
assured that by this  time Kate knows quite a bit about us! (What her opinion of
us is IED can't tell you,  but in case you are worrying about it, no, IED did
not use the third person to  describe himself, so Kate probably doesn't yet
think that Love-Hounds are total  idiots!)

again; and misK. mailbag items 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED, if you keep sending me such fulsome compliments, I may ask you to
bear  my children. You turn my head. 
</P>
<P>But isn't it some kind of sin to sleep with one's own auntie, Lizoo?
Actually,  though, the idea turns IED on. He's ALL YOURS, Lizooshka, Lizooshka, 
Lizooshka-ya-ya! 
</P>
<P> &gt; IED, I'm curious about this quiz for the WSI. Can I get more info? 
</P>
<P>IED would like to oblige, but there's not much to add. No further clues for
the  quiz itself, that wouldn't be fair. The WSI is the Wickham Street
Irregulars, a  group which to date can count two members among its ranks. It is
therefore  officially no longer imaginary-- just inactive. The organisation's
new by-laws were  recently published in Love-Hounds. The original purpose of the
WSI was to  encourage the submission of imaginative works of prose which offer
novel  interpretations of Kate's art without dependence upon factual or textual
support. In  other words, through its proposed irregular quarterly the WSI would
foster the  creation and communication of a new and ever-expanding world of
Kate-inspired  but not Kate-dependent culture. It was intended to offer thereby
an alternative to all  current fanzines/books/computer fora, which thus far have
tended inevitably to  concern themselves with the factual, literal truth
surrounding Kate (a kind of truth  which IED feels has a definite place and
time, and does not mean to criticize here).  In order to assure the seriousness
of the members, however, it was thought  necessary to require applicants to pass
an entrance exam, one which demands a  considerable knowledge of the factual
side of Kate's work and life. This is  completely inconsistent with the avowed
goals of the WSI--which makes sense, in a  WSI sort of way. 
</P>
<P>Actually, however, anyone who takes the trouble to inquire or to take the
exam,  no matter what their score, will be welcome to join the WSI...especially
you, Lizoo,  darling! 
</P>
<P>Also, all the above high aspirations about a WSIQ have been indefinitely
shelved  in favour of the new order of business as set forth in the by-laws:
namely, getting  together and drinking a lot; and in the event that no meeting
is possible, just getting  drunk on our own. 
</P>
<P>[Plenty of time for KT?]
</P>
<P>Finally, getting time off from work is everybody's personal problem. Forget
the  career, friend, this is KATE BUSH we're talking about.
