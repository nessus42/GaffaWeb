(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: EMI stupid? naaaah, surely not! 
</P>
<P> Chris here, 
</P>
<P>Kenneth G Descoteaux asked about EMI (regarding EMI's screw-up of the 
gender of the protaganist of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;): 
</P>
<P>&gt; Now how did they screw up the release like that? 
</P>
<P> For EMI this is a minor &quot;gaffe.&quot; Those of us who survived the &quot;EMI-America&quot;
 years have seen far worse. In our &quot;hallway full'o'Kate&quot; is a pair of
those  reproductions of album covers used for record store promotion called &quot;flats.&quot;
The  back of the flat for Never For Ever has this; 
</P>
<P> KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P> features: 
</P>
<P> &quot;NEVER FOR EVER&quot; 
</P>
<P>Remember that song? How moving is was? What ever happened to it? Now this 
screw-up wasn't due to the album not being released yet - this was in 1984, a
quick  look at an English copy could have caught the mistake, or a phone call to
any fan or  record store that carried imports. This was fairly typical of things
at that time. Not to  be too hard on EMI-America but they have never given any
impression they ever  really understood her, or ever even tried.

<P>Date: Tue, 15 Dec 92 12:08:18 +0100 <BR> From: Ulrich Grepel &lt;uli@intellektik.informatik.th-darmstadt.de&gt;
<BR> Subject: Bravo July 1981
</P>
<P>Hi all, and especially Ron, our interview/review etc. collector: 
</P>
<P>A friend of mine has found an old article about Kate in an old issue of the 
German teenie magazine 'Bravo'. I cannot say in which issue of that ugly rag the
 article was in, but there is a crossword puzzle on the backside of the pages
that has a  deadline of August 3rd, 1981, so this thing probably is from July
'81. They perfectly  show that they have absolutely no idea about Kate. At least
they seem to like her...  But can YOU tell after reading the article what to
expect from her music? I surely  can't. I will give both, the German original &amp;
my English translation that surely has  a lot of errors due to being a non
native speaker of English. My comments in []s.  BTW, in addition to the photos &amp;
the article there is a 2 page poster of KT in the  green leotard with the pink
belt around Kate's waist. It's the same pic that we all  can find on the Lioness
at Heart box. 
</P>
<P>[the following is - of course - reprinted without kind or whatever
permission] 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>She presents her songs in matching costumes: <BR> In her songs she gets
down to hot themes 
</P>
<P>[There are a lot of captions and a lot of pictures. I'll describe the
picture, followed  by the corresponding captions] 
</P>
<P>[Kate in the James And The Cold Gun costume, holding the rifle]: In &quot;Army
 Dreamers&quot; Kate curses in combat uniform and with a rifle against nuclear
war.  [how do you mix up three songs in one sentence?] 
</P>
<P>[Kate in a pink re-colored trouser-dress, exactly the one of the September
'80  'rock pop'-performance of Babooshka, holding a huge double bass]: Kate 
thought up this gag for her stage performance: At &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;
[??!] she  climbs out of a huge double bass 
</P>
<P>[Kate waving goodbye at the end of the Hammersmith performance of Wuthering 
Heights]: With deathly pale makeup [wasn't that an effect of the lightshow?], a 
skirt wrapped around the slender waist, Kate pleads for her lover to follow her 
into the beyond in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. [Wasn't that the other way
round? Of  course Cathy wanted to join Heathcliff, but on the living side of the
final  frontier?] 
</P>
<P>[Kate in the dress that was used in the Wow performance at the Hammersmith 
Odeon]: In a playful, smoked [what's that?] suit, she presents herself
completely  tender with &quot;A Man with the Child in his Eyes&quot; [should I
say anything?] 
</P>
<P>[Kate in the Mrs. Mopp costume]: For her &quot;Rock-pop&quot; performance
Kate recently  [almost a year ago!] showed up in a cleaner-look [at least they
seem to look at  their pictures and at least they know WHEN they were used, but
what song was  presented as Mrs. Mopp?] 
</P>
<P>[Kate in the famous Babooshka video costume]: As seductive &quot;Babooshka&quot;
and with  unjustified suspicions Kate drives her husband to his death 
</P>
<P>[Now they manage a matching pair of picture and song, but have they just
begun  thinking about &quot;The Wedding List&quot; before finishing their
sentence?] 
</P>
<P>The slip is super-tight, the thin, striped and flowing shirt shows more than
it  conceals. The naked legs stick in studded boots [where are the rivets? I
can't find  'em on the boots]. But the pugnacious amazon doesn't only look
dangerous: With  unjustified displays of jealousy she hunts her innocent husband
into the grave, just  for having a good cry afterwards as a black-dressed widow
and to rail against her  fate. [I think I just stop with my comments. Just for
the ones who don't know woof  yet: this is &quot;all mixed up&quot; (BTW: &quot;all
mixed up&quot; is a TV show on the British TV  station &quot;Superchannel&quot;
where I have seen a lot of interesting videos!)] 
</P>
<P>Disguised that way as &quot;Babooshka&quot;, Kate exhausts all of her acting
and dancing  repertoire. On her new [this is an '81 article! Oh, I wanted to
shut up...] album  &quot;Never for ever&quot; [their lower case Ever - aahh! not
again!] the 22 year old English  lady gets down on politically hot themes. In &quot;Army
Dreamers&quot; she warns about  nuclear weapons and a threatening war, she
mistrusts the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; from  England [That's &quot;Eiserne Lady&quot;
in German. How do the Brits call their long running  female prime minister?] as
well as the President of America. [No, I won't say  anything more...] 
</P>
<P>Privately Kate - born on July 30, 1958 in Kent - also doesn't trust too many
 people. She likes to take everything in her own hands. The trained dancer and 
discovery of Pink-Floyd-guitarist David Gilmour played the piano perfectly at
the  age of six [now they even mix her up with Tori, and that in 1981!], writes
her own  songs since the age of 12. Today Kate thinks of her stage effects all
alone and has her  nine headed band completely under control. The delicate Kate
spares no efforts to  arrange her show as perfect as possible. 
</P>
<P>To be fit as a dancer, she takes courses from the English choreographer
Anthony  von [they even use the German form 'von' of the Dutch 'van'!] Laast.
Only her  two older brothers are allowed to botch into her business once in a
while. Brother  Paddy [going to the cloister now?] plays in her band and
sometimes has something to  say in musical terms. Brother Carder, called Jay, on
whom Kate is especially  attached, manages all her publicity and business
affairs. He also keeps off all  photographers and takes all [all? most!] of the
photos of his sister for album covers  and press releases by himself. 
</P>
<P>If Kate has griefs, she flees to her parents Hannah and John Bush, who are
still  running a country doctor's practice. In north London Kate shares a house
with her  two brothers and two cats. [Hi Pyewacket, Zoodle, Rocket...] 
</P>
<P>Though having this familiar security Kate doesn't know at the moment how she
 should continue. Film and TV offerings start to pile up, but she can't decide
if she  should work out another stage show, record her next LP or begin a career
in dance  and acting [was the last one ever an option??]. But one thing is sure:
everything that  Kate gets down to is, as the title of her LP says, &quot;Never
for Ever&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Margit Rietti 
</P>
<P>[now for the German original]: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>Sie stellt ihre Lieder in passender Verkleidung dar <BR> In ihren Songs
packt sie heisse Themen an 
</P>
<P>[James and the Cold Gun Bild]: In &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; wettert Kate im
Kampfanzug  und mit Gewehr gegen den Atomkrieg 
</P>
<P>[Rock Pop's Babooshka-Bild (pink umgefaerbtes, rotes Kleid und Bass]: Diesen
Gag  dachte sich Kate fuer ihre Buehnenshow aus: Bei &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;
steigt sie aus  einem riesigen Bass 
</P>
<P>[Kate beim Abschiedswinken in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; vom
Hammersmith-Video]:  Leichenblass geschminkt, einen Rock um die schmale Taille
gewickelt, fleht Kate  in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; ihren Geliebten an, ihr
ins Jenseits zu folgen 
</P>
<P>[Kate im &quot;Wow&quot;-Kleid]: Im verspielten gesmokten Anzug praesentiert
sie sich ganz  zaertlich bei &quot;A Man with the Child in his Eyes&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Kate im Putzfrauen-Kleid]: Zu ihrem &quot;Rock-pop&quot;-Auftritt erschien
Kate vor  kurzem im Putzfrauen-Look 
</P>
<P>[Kate im &quot;Babooshka&quot;-Video-Kostuem (Schwert und Pfauenfedern)]:
Als  verfuehrerische &quot;Babooshka&quot; treibt Kate mit unberechtigten
Verdaechtigungen  ihren Mann in den Tod 
</P>
<P>Der Slip ist superknapp, das duenne gestreifte Flatterhemd zeigt mehr als es
 verdeckt. Die nackten Beine stecken in nietenbesetzten Stiefeln. Doch die
streitbare  Amazone sieht nicht nur gefaehrlich aus: Mit unbegruendeten
Eifersuchts-Szenen  verfolgt sie ihren unschuldigen Ehemann bis ins Grab, um
sich anschliessend als  schwarzverkleidete Witwe auszuweinen und mit ihrem
Schicksal zu hadern. 
</P>
<P>So verkleidet als &quot;Babooshka&quot;, schoepft Kate Bush ihr
schauspielerisches und  taenzerisches Repertoire voll aus. Auf ihrer neuen LP &quot;Never
for ever&quot; (Nicht fuer  immer) packt die 22jaehrige Englaenderin auch
politische heisse Themen an. In  &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; warnt sie vor
Nuklear-Waffen und einem drohenden Krieg,  misstraut der &quot;Eisernen Lady&quot;
von England ebenso wie dem amerikanischen  Praesidenten. 
</P>
<P>Auch privat vertraut Kate - am 30. Juli 1958 in der Grafschaft Kent geboren
-  kaum jemandem. Am liebsten nimmt sie alles selbst in die Hand. Die
ausgebildete  Taenzerin und Entdeckung von Pink-Floyd-Gitarrist David Gilmour
spielte schon  mit sechs perfekt Klavier, schreibt seit ihrem 12. Lebensjahr
eigene Songs. Heute  denkt sich Kate auch ihre Buehneneffekte und Kostueme
allein aus und hat ihre  neunkoepfige Band fest im Griff. 
</P>
<P>Die zierliche Kate scheut keine Muehe, ihre Show so perfekt wie moeglich zu 
gestalten. Um auch taenzerisch in Form zu sein, nimmt sie Unterricht bei dem 
englischen Choreographen Anthony von Laast. Nur ihre zwei aelteren Brueder 
duerfen Kate ab und zu inds Geschaeft reinpfuschen. Bruder Paddy spielt in ihrer
 Band mit und hat auch musikalisch ein Woertchen mitzureden. Bruder Carder, 
genannt Jay, an dem Kate besonders haengt, betreut ihre gesamte[n] Publicity und
 Geschaeftsangelegenheiten. Er haelt ihr auch alle Fotografen vom Leib und
schiesst  saemtliche Fotos fuer Platten-Cover und Pressematerial von seiner
Schwester selbst. 
</P>
<P>Wenn Kate Kummer hat, fluechtet sie sich zu ihren Eltern Hannah und John 
Bush, die nach wie vor in Kent eine Landarztpraxis betreiben. In Nordlondon
teilt  Kate ein Haus mit ihren beiden Bruedern und zwei Katzen. 
</P>
<P>Trotz dieser familiaeren Geborgenheit weiss Kate im Moment nicht, wie es bei
 ihr weitergehen soll. Film und TV-Angebote beginnen sich zu haeufen, doch sie 
kann sich nicht entscheiden, ob sie wieder eine neue Buehnenshow ausarbeiten, 
die naechste LP aufnehmen oder eine Schauspiel- und Tanzkarriere einschlagen
soll.  Doch eins ist sicher: Alles, was Kate anpackt ist, wie der Titel ihrer LP
schon sagt  &quot;Nicht fuer immer&quot;.

<BR> Subject: Babooshka grammar 
</P>
<P>I was listening to the Whole Story today and in the song Babooshka, I
thought I  heard Kate say 
</P>
<P>&quot;She couldn't have made a worst move...&quot; 
</P>
<P>which is grammatically incorrect (it should be worsE). So I checked the
lyrics I  have from the lyrics server, and (although I know there are some
mistakes in there)  they said &quot;worse.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I listened to the song again and indeed Kate utters a very pronounced worsT.
Has  anyone else noticed this? Is Kate intentionally erring? Or am I missing
something  subtle in the lyrics? I suppose the sentence could mean that &quot;She
was incapable of  making a WORST move,&quot; but from the context, this does not
appear to be the  intended meaning.

<P>Until I got the lyrics with Never For Ever, I thought Kate was singing  &quot;choice&quot;--albeit
with a rather strange pronunciation. Actually it sounds like &quot;chove&quot; 
to me, suggesting Jon's theory might have some merit. Though I thought Kate was 
too much a perfectionist to let that slip by.

22:42:55 EDT <BR> Subject: Grandmother
</P>
<P>&gt; From: peter@xal (Peter Freeman) <BR> &gt; And yes, it does mean
grandmother, and I also believe that it refers to the type  of scarf that we
stereotypically associate with older Russian women. This opens the  song back up
for interpretation...it would seem to me that she is incognito because  she is
wearing a BA-boosh-ka. 
</P>
<P>If I remember correctly, Kate has said that she was just trying to think of
an  exotic sounding name and that &quot;Babooshka&quot; came to mind. (She has
said the same  thing about &quot;Kashka&quot;.) She has never, to my knowledge,
ever mentioned that its  Russian meaning as &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;scarf
worn on the head&quot; has anything to do  with the song. I doubt that the
Babooshka is used to indicate that the woman dresses  incognito by hiding
herself in a babooshka because this does not agree with the  story of the song
which seems to indicate that she dresses exoticly and sexily.  However, who
knows with Kate -- you could be right. 
</P>
<P>&gt; [\:on :/runkbrain:] <BR> &gt; You know what I find interesting is that
it sounds a hell of a lot like Kate starts  to say &quot;choice&quot; and then

</P>
<P>This is what it sounds like to me too... but I doubt that it's a mistake.
There  must be some deep meaning in it -- known only to Kate. Maybe if you play
it  backwards it says &quot;I buried Paul&quot;.... Then again, Kate spelled
Orgonon wrong by  mistake....

<P>&gt; As far as I can recall from my English lessons at school, worse
compares two  things (&quot;This is the worse of the two&quot;) and worst

Kate is implying several (ie. three or more)  options of which the one she took
was the &quot;worst&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, I don't think it works that way, Ant. WORST is the
superlative  form, whereas WORSE can be used as a superlative, or as a
*comparative*. You are  correct when you say that (as superlatives) WORSE is of
two things, and WORST is  of greater than two things. But what Kate seems to be
using in Babooshka is the  comparative. 
</P>
<P>The case is more clear if we pretend she's saying a BETTER move. Using 
analogies, GOOD:BAD = BETTER:WORSE = BEST:WORST. 
</P>
<P>&quot;She couldn't have made a BEST move...&quot; 
</P>
<P>is clearly ungrammatical (in the sense Kate seems to want here), whereas 
</P>
<P>&quot;She couldn't have made a BETTER move...&quot;

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Babooshka 
</P>
<P>&gt; Kate in all her infinite wisdom, gave the song that title. As I
understand,  Babooshka means &quot;grandmother&quot;. Any ideas??? 
</P>
<P>IED seems to remember (but from what source he cannot say) that Kate once 
said the name was inspired from some old children's story she had read long
before.  This is not confirmed, however, and in fact IED is not at all certain
that he ever  actually read this anywhere. It could have been a dream. (See, as
many of you will  not be surprised to learn, IED tends to have Kate Bushological
dream experiences at  any and all times of the day and night. It's very
distressing sometimes.) 
</P>
<P>[re Grammar:]
</P>
<P> Apropos Kate's use of odd grammatical misconstructions, IED would like to 
point out that these anomalies are quite clearly deliberate artistic decisions
on her  part. In her interviews Kate's use of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;
are invariably correctly placed.  Her grammar is extremely good. Lines like &quot;You
and me knew life itself is  breathing&quot; (from Breathing ) and &quot;Him and
I in the room&quot; (from Houdini ) could  therefore only have been devised for
artistic reasons. One thing they definitely do is  identify the narrative
context as informal, casual, conversational, rather than  self-consciously
poetic or otherwise literary. And this is crucial to the  communication of
Kate's aesthetic, which, in terms of lyrics, at least, is in IED's  opinion
generally more narrative and anecdotal than poetic. (Of course this creates a 
certain poetic atmosphere itself, but that's not what IED means.) It would be a
lot  different (and far more painful to IED) if Kate were to use &quot;For you
and I&quot;--a form  of bad grammar which stems from unworthy pretence rather
than healthy  casualness.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Grammar 
</P>
<P>Just a note on Babooshka 's grammar: IED has studied two early versions of
this  song, and there can be no doubt that in those early versions Kate wrote
and sang  &quot;worse move&quot;. No &quot;T&quot; sound at all. Therefore her
inclusion of the &quot;T&quot; sound in the  final version was either a.) a very
peculiar but deliberate change on her part which  was made apparently purely for
the sake of the sound ; or b.) a little slip of the  tongue which she decided
was not worth scrapping the whole take to fix. Judging  from the strength of the
&quot;T&quot; sound the former explanation seems likeliest. She just  stuck a &quot;T&quot;
sound on there. Now there is another possible explanation, and that is  that
perhaps she meant to keep the grammar correct (&quot;worse&quot;), so left the &quot;correct&quot;
 grammar on the lyrics-sheet, but at the same time wanted to introduce still
another  twist of meaning to the phrase, so in the vocal, added the &quot;T&quot;.
Whatever the reason,  there is no possibility that Kate didn't know the correct
grammatical  construction--she not only wrote it out for the lyrics, she also
sang it correctly in two  early versions of the song. 
</P>
<P>And if some of you are now extremely curious about where IED got access to
two  early versions of Babooshka, he'll just say that they were broadcast once
on UK  radio by Kate herself, and the tapes are floating around for traders to
find. Good  luck. (No, no obsKuriTies 3 is planned--all those projeKTs are a
thing of the past.)

</P>
<P>I just saw on TV a commercial for Certs where there is a Russian dude up in 
Siberia, or something, and he's really far from the camera. He pops a Certs in
his  mouth and suddenly zips up so that we have an ultra-closeup of his face and
he says  something like, &quot;Come to me, my little babooshka&quot;. Thus, it
seems that &quot;babooshka&quot;  is used as a term of affection in Russian, in
addition to its meanings as  &quot;grandmother&quot; and &quot;scarf worn on the
head&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Perhaps this word is used similar to the way that French men call their
women  their &quot;little cabbages&quot;. Cabbage has never seen very romantic
to me, but to a  different culture, anything goes....

Subject: Origin of the Babooshka title 
</P>
<P>Since certain Love-hounds were pondering the origin of the &quot;Babooshka&quot;
title, I  thought this excerpt from an EMI 1980 interview, &quot;Kate Discusses
Never For Ever&quot;,  would be of interest. This is reprinted from Vol. 1,
Issue 2 of Breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>If hasn't been posted before and if there's sufficient interest I'll type in
the rest  of the interview and post it to L-Hs. The interview is of historical
interest and  contains some nice insights into details of the album. She talks
about working with  Peter Gabriel among other things. Also interesting is the
discussion on long period of  time that they seem to think it took for Kate to
produce the album--funny,  considering the interval between HoL and TSW. 
</P>
<P>Int: One track which has achieved success as a single is &quot;Babooshka&quot;
which is the  lead track on this album and when I first saw that you had done a
song on that title I  imagined it was a Russian grandmother. Where had you heard
the term? 
</P>
<P>Kate: Well, it was very strange, because as I was writing this song the name
just  came and I couldn't think where I'd got it from and I presumed it was from
a  Russian fairy tale--it sounded like the name of a princess or something and
it was so  perfect for the music, it had all the right syllables and the right
feel, so I kept it in.  Many strange coincidences happened after that--where I'd
turn on the television  and there would be Donald Swann singing about Babushka.
So I realized that there  was actually someone called this and I managed to find
in the Radio Times a little  precis of a program that was on called Babushka. It
was an opera that someone had  written and Babushka was apparently the lady that
the three Kings went to see  because the star stopped over her house. They
presumed that the Lord was in there,  and when he wasn't they went on their way.
She wanted to go with them to find  Jesus and they wouldn't let her come so she
spent the rest of her life looking for  him. I don't really know where it came
from but it worked. 
</P>
<P>Int: It's a very lovely story and one could write another song about that I
suppose. 
</P>
<P>Kate: Yes, maybe. 
</P>
<P>Int: But the one you've written about is another tale of romance, successful
and  failed and a very touching one about a man who is tiring a bit of his wife
but when  she dresses up in what we might call new clothes he falls for her all
over again. Now  someone might say that this is a very novel way of looking at
love. Do you think of  yourself as a writer of love songs? 
</P>
<P>Kate: I don't know. I suppose I would say that I have written some love
songs but  I wouldn't term that as one. Really I'm very annoyed at the way that
the woman is  behaving in this song because it is so stupid and in fact she's
just ruining the whole  situation which was very lovely--and it's only because
of what's going on in her  brain that she does these things so--suspicion,
paranoia all these naughty energies  again and it's really quite sad I think.

<P>It seemed obvious to me the first time I ever heard Babooshka. I had always 
thought of the word babooshka as a Russian endearment. I also thought that the
idea  that the word is a Russian endearment could be nothing but a Western myth.
I've  never had a chance to ask a Russian, though..

<P>&quot;Babooshka&quot; is, in fact, a term of endearment to a child,
particularly a baby. It is  related to the quasi-yiddish &quot;Bubulah&quot;.
But probably, &quot;AHHHHhhyahhhh, baby baby  baby ya ya&quot; just didn't have

<P>Love-Hounds:

<P>Hate to beat this subject to death but I showed my last trenchant insight to
my  Russian friend and she corrected some of my comments. First, Babooshka is
indeed  a term of endearment, but it is a term of endearment for one's
grandmother. So  everyone is sort of right on that one. Secondly, as for scarfs
on the head,  *MARRIED* Russian women wear these, but only the old ones actually
do.  Therefore, while Babooshkas tend to actually wear these scarfs, &quot;Babooshka&quot;
does  not mean scarf worn on the head.

<P>Well, I asked my Russian coworker about the word &quot;babushka&quot; and
she said that  in Russian, the word means &quot;grandmother&quot; and nothing
more. She says that it never  is used to mean either &quot;scarf worn on the
head&quot; or as a term of endearment. She  also said that she has heard it
often used both these ways by Americans. (In fact, if  you look in an English
dictionary, the definition of &quot;babushka&quot; is &quot;a usually 
triangularly folded kerchief for the head&quot;.) 
</P>
<P>In any case, there is still the possibility that Kate used the name &quot;Babooshka&quot;
 because she once heard it used as a term of endearment by an ignorant 
English-speaker and it stuck in her head.

<P>Another discussion question. What does everyone think happens at the end of 
Babooshka? 
</P>
<P>Kate leaves the ending open to question. 
</P>
<P>Her lines at the beginning of the song &quot;She couldn't have made a worse

this. 
</P>
<P>But that isn't clear at the end.

<P>Our last view is of the man giving himself to what he thinks is a mistress, &quot;I'm

is that  everything he finds attractive in the mistress is what reminds him of
his wife. Of  course, the wife doesn't know that. 
</P>
<P>I think the breaking glass noises are important, but they can be interpreted
in a  couple different ways. 
</P>
<P>The Russion flavor of the title and the fact the the breacking noises usualy
occur  in pairs makes me think of two lovers toasting each other and throwing
their glasses  in the fire. 
</P>
<P>But the foreboding intro to the song makes me think the breaking glass might
 symbolize violence, or broken lives or broken hearts, a broken relationship.

<P>Anybody else have any thoughts on this?

Of  course, the wife doesn't know that. I think the breaking glass noises are

</P>
<P>I have always thought of it as that they -- the couple -- &quot;break the
mirrors&quot;; that  they see their real selves without disguises. I have
borrowed this interpretation from  a backannouncement made after the song was
played on Swedish national radio once  in about 1986. The radio presenter said
someting along the lines of &quot;it is never too  late to break the mirrors, it
is never too late for love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>This interpretation is somewhat vauge and fuzzy, but is supported by the
video;  she lifts her veil, the mirrors break, and they all se everything

<BR> Subject: Delius - His Own Words 
</P>
<P>The following on Frederick Delius (1862-1934) is published in Harold C. 
Schonberg's &quot;The Lives of the Great Composers,&quot; Revised edition, 1981.
I feel it is  relevant material here. 
</P>
<P>Delius's music owed nothing to anybody. Like Debussy, he completely broke
away  from established form, and there is a free, improvisatory quality about
his music that  sounds as if it had resulted from experimenting with voluptuous,
exotically chromatic  chords at the piano. It is a rhapsodic kind of music, in
free forms, and is altogether  free of Classicism. The harmonies can be
overwhelmingly rich and even dissonant at  times, but they were unlike the
harmonies of any other composer. &quot;I don't believe  in learning harmony or
counterpoint,&quot; Delius said. &quot;Learning kills instinct. Never  believe
the saying that one has to hear music many times to understand it. It is utter 
nonsense, the last refuge of the incompetent....For me, music is very simple. It
is the  expression of a poetical and emotional nature.&quot; To Delius, a &quot;sense
of flow&quot; was the  only thing that mattered. Music had flow or it didn't. If
it had, it was good music. If  it didn't, it was bad. In 1920 he reacted
violently to the advanced music of his day, in  a long article he wrote for &quot;The
Sackbut&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is room in the world for all kinds of music to suit all tastes,
and there is  no reason why the devotees of Dada should not enjoy the musically
imbecile  productions of their own little circle as much as the patrons of
musical comedy enjoy  'their' particular fare. But when I see the prophets of
the latest clique doing their  utmost to pervert the taste of the public and to
implant a false set of values in the  rising generation of music lovers by
sneering at the great masters of the past, in the  hope of attracting greater
attention to the 'petits maitres' of the present-then I say  it is time to speak
openly and protest.... 
</P>
<P>This is an age of anarchy in art; there is no authority, no standard, no
sense of  proportion. Anybody can do anything and call it 'art' in the certain
expectation of  making a crowd of idiots stand and stare at him in gaping
astonishment and  admiration.... 
</P>
<P>Music does not exist for the purpose of emphasizing or exaggerating
something  which happens outside its own sphere. Musical expression only begins,
to be  significant where words and actions reach their uttermost limit of
expression. Music  should be concerned with the emotions, not with external
events. To make music  imitate some other thing is as futile as to try and make
it say 'Good morning' or  'It's a fine day.' It is only that which cannot be
expressed otherwise that is worth  expressing in music.&quot;

<P>Can anyone help with the following? It's for a friend who doesn't have net

</P>
<P>&quot;On the subject of deciphering lyrics, I've noticed a couple of &quot;background
 whispers&quot; in the song BLOW AWAY. The first one is arround the 1:36 mark
(CD) in  between &quot;Buddy Holly ... Sandy Denny&quot;--goes something like &quot;go
sleep/seek&quot;. It is  very low in the mix and it has to be turned up rather
loud to pick it up. The second  is at the 2:38-39 point--over the 1st &quot;Viscious&quot;
and is maybe &quot;aah don't drop&quot; (?)  Once again it isn't easy to pick
up.&quot; 
</P>
<P>These seem to me to be introductory bits leading into the chorus. Can anyone

<P>The August issue of Q magazine includes the following in its Q&amp;A column:

</P>
<P>Q: Patrick Humphries writes in his book about Fairport Convention, Meet On 
The Ledge, that Sandy Denny was commemorated in a song by Kate Bush, Paul 
Metsers and Dave Cousins after her tragic death. What is the name of the song

</P>
<P>Here's part of the answer: 
</P>
<P>A: A small misunderstanding here. Patrick Humphries did not mean to imply in
 Meet On The Ledge -- which will be republished next year --that these three 
artists had collaborated on a tribute song. In fact, Kate Bush has never written
a song  with anybody, but on her 1980 album Never For Ever the chorus of the
song Blow  Away lists a selection of dead pop stars thus: &quot;Hello Minnie,
Moony, Vicious, Vicious,  Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny.&quot; (Minnie is the soul
singer Minnie Riperton of  five-octave range and Lovin'You hit single fame who
died of cancer in 1979, while  Moony is The Who's drummer Keith Moon who
accidentally overdosed in 1978, the  same year as Sandy Denny suffered her fatal
fall).

</P>
<P>Hello there Andy--
</P>
<P> I saw your question in Love-Hounds and decided to finally contribute my two
 cents' worth to Love-Hounds. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, Kate's &quot;The Wedding List&quot; (as far as I can tell) is about
a young woman  whose husband is shot down immediately after they are married...
(if you happen to  see the video, the guy is shot down just as Kate and her &quot;groom&quot;
are going to kiss).  To get revenge, Kate picks up a rifle and stalks the
killer, and right after she shoots  HIM, she kills herself (in the video, she
hangs herself). 
</P>
<P>The words you refer to are these: 
</P>
<P> And after she shot the guy <BR> She committed suicide <BR> Later when
they analyzed <BR> They found a little one inside <BR> Must have been Rudy's
child <BR> An eye for an eye 
</P>
<P> So, not only did Kate kill herself, but she also destroyed the unborn child
that  was to have been hers and Rudy's. 
</P>
<P>Of course, I'm sure my interpretation will fall victim to IED's and others' 
criticisms, but that's what happens as far as I can tell. BTW, this &quot;video&quot;
I referred  to is from Kate's 1980 (?) Christmas special. 
</P>
<P>Hope this helps you somewhat. 
</P>
<P> All the best,

<P>Deb Wentorf: far from attacking your summary of The Wedding List, IED
greatly  admired it. Absolutely correct, so far as IED knows. 
</P>
<P>Perhaps it's worth adding that the story behind the song is based, in part,
at least,  on Francois Truffaut's film La Mariee etait en noir (The Bride Wore
Black), which  is something of a tribute to Hitchcock by the French director. It
stars Jeanne  Moreau, and in it there is one scene which Kate copies almost
frame-for-frame in  her video for The Wedding List: 
</P>
<P>the part where the bridegroom (Anthony Van Laast) is shot, and falls on his
back  on the stairs, and the bride (Moreau/Kate) drops down by his side.
However, in  Kate's story the setting is changed from present-day to the Old
West.

</P>
<P>First, there was Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. I actually read this
in one  of my high school English classes; it is not terribly exciting. In fact,
our entire class  teased the teacher about sexual repression for the rest of the
year because of it,  since it was the theme he thought was most prominent in the
book. 
</P>
<P>Then there was a film adaptation called The Innocents, which I have not
seen.  However, I did see Chris William's video for &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;
composed of clips  from the movie; it was really quite appropriate. I believe
the movie is what inspired  Kate to do the song. 
</P>
<P>Both the book and the movie are about a governess sent to take care of a
young  boy and girl; the children appear to be possessed by the ghosts of people
who used  to work on the estate where they live. In particular I recall that the
boy is supposed  to be possessed by the spirit of a former gardener, and
therefore does some  suggestive things around the governess. It is not entirely
clear whether the governess  is insane and imagines all this (hence the sexual
repression theme) or whether  something supernatural is happening.

</P>
<P>&gt; I've been researching Victorian sexuality lately for a class, and I
have been  wondering about this song. Does anybody know Kate's story behind it?
I'm struck  by a thematic similarity to Henry James' &quot;Turn of the Screw,&quot;
where the governess  has a very erotically charged relationship with her young
male ward (even  comparing their feelings to those of newlyweds in the final
scene). Knowing Kate's  proclivity for writing songs related to books, I
wondered if there was any  connection. 
</P>
<P> Hi Angela, 
</P>
<P>I may be the wrong person to interpret this (being male with no offspring),
but  I'll hazard it out anyway...I think that it's a very powerful song. 
</P>
<P> The setting appears evident: Kate is a young woman (most likely adolescent)
 baby-sitting (or something equivalent--perhaps simply tucking a relatives child
into  bed at a family gathering-- it has been my observation that maturing women
 experiment with mothering experiences through close observation/assistance with
 new additions to a family such as cousins, nieces and nephews, or close family 
friends...usually not siblings or children of people with whom they are not
familiar.  But I digress.) laying a child down to sleep for the night. 
</P>
<P>I say goodnight - night. <BR> I tuck him in tight. <BR> But things are not
right -<BR>  What is this? an infant kiss, 
</P>
<P>As the young Kate tucks the boy into bed, he is undergoing a familiar
ritual...one  Kate is not familiar with. How many small children are tucked into
bed without  recieving a kiss from their parent? Not many, I'd wager. Since
babies primary  behavioral resource is imitation, they begin to kiss back as the
skills develop (until  bedtime becomes undesirable, anyway :-) ) to do so. This
boy catches Kate unawares  and kisses Kate goodnight. Tenderer moments are hard
to find. 
</P>
<P>That sends my body tingling. <BR> I've never fallen for, <BR> A little boy
before, <BR> No control 
</P>
<P>This suprise has stirred the inherient maternal instincts in Kate...a
biological  urge which is very new to her, both physically and intellectually.
The most  significant part is NEW...this little boy has opened doors Kate didn't
even know she  had. Life suprises us like that sometimes...I think adolescent
women may handle  such suprises better than adolescent men, but I'm straying
from the realm of my  dime store philosiphy. 
</P>
<P>Just a kid and just at school, <BR> Back home they'd call me dirty, <BR>
His little hand is on my heart, <BR> He's got me where it hurts me. 
</P>
<P>Kate is a developmental age where she is aware of her sexuality, but it's a
dirty  thing, not much discussed and even less frequently in a positive light. I
am uncertain  whether Kate is still bending over the boy, or if she has picked
him back up  again...in either case his hand is clearly on her breast. Since he
is old enough to  present her with a kiss, he could be puller her blouse as she
bends over so he can  kiss her, or she could be cradling him in her arms. She
knows her classmates would  think of this as 'dirty' (in a non-malicious sense),
be she feels something much  stronger, and definately not dirty. 
</P>
<P>Knock, knock, who's there in this baby? <BR> You know how to work me. 
</P>
<P>The recognition of a maternal capability is directly related to the
realization that  this baby will turn into a person , just like Kate. Though
difficult to comprehend, the  understanding of this is almost immedately
present. 
</P>
<P>And all my barriers are going, <BR> It's starting to show, <BR> Let go,
let go. 
</P>
<P>This isn't about sexual barriers, this is about maternal ones. Stronger for
women  I think because after all, they can get pregnant. Kate can make one of
these things;  she posses an ability innate with her femininity to creaste
another human being. No  small thing, that. 
</P>
<P>I cannot sit and let, <BR> Something happen I'll regret, <BR> Ooh, he
scares me, <BR> There's a man behind those eyes, <BR> I catch him when I'm
bending 
</P>
<P>Mothers are more aware and more protective of their son's sexuality, just as
most  fathers are more aware and more protective of their daughter's sexuality.
This  infant boy will become more than a person; he will become a man. I am less
certain  of whether this is biological or learned (or is Kate being dirty?
Frankly, I don't  think so). Perhaps some feminine folk can answer this question
for me. The bending  reference may be Kate bending down to kiss him goodnight,
I'm not sure. 
</P>
<P>Ooh, how he frightens me, <BR> When they whisper privately, <BR>
Windy-waily, blows me, <BR> Words of caress on their lips, <BR> That speak of
adult love. <BR> I want to smack but I hold back, <BR> I only want to touch.
<BR> But I must stay and find a way to stop this before it gets too much. 
</P>
<P> Kate isn't comfortable with the concept of herself in a motherhood role...
of  course this is the very subject which the mothers, and perhaps fathers,
discuss either  while she is not present or whisper to one another while they
feel she is more  focused on the child than them. She wants to strike out, to
remove from their minds  the idea that she is a sexual creature, capable of such
an act because she feels some  sort of shame. Remember, they'd only call her
dirty. 
</P>
<P>I think the focus of the song is more maternal than sexual, though the two 
awarenesses awaken about the same time. The song reflects Kate's psycological
and  cultural conflict with such powerful internal stirrings. 
</P>
<P>There's my two cents. It's all my opinion, and flames on what a sexist pig I
am  can be sent via e-mail or to /dev/null. That's my youth and paranoia
speaking  there, I think :-).

<P>&gt; I guess so. but I don't buy this Post Office jazz. why would our little
army boy  be coming home from a daring assignment with the Post Office in a body
bag? 
</P>
<P>BFPO isn't generally used as the name of an organisation (though it might
mean  that too), it's the form of a postal address: 
</P>
<P>Private A. Squaddy, <BR> 152nd Regmt. Royal Highland Spud Bashers, <BR> B
F P O 666 
</P>
<P>plus presumably some other stuff. Ie, it's like a postal/zip code for
getting mail to  people in the services whose physical address might be variable
or even secret. So,  `coming home from BFPO' means coming home from some forces
unit.

<P>This is the official narration in KB's &quot;Breathing&quot; as printed in
the KBC  newsletter. I believe that the narration was composed by John Carder
Bush. 
</P>
<P>&quot;In point of fact it is possible to tell the difference between a small
nuclear  explosion and a large one by a very simple method. The calling card of
a nuclear  bomb is the blinding flash that is far more dazzling than any light
on earth  --brighter even than the sun itself -- and it is by the duration of
this flash that we  are able to determine the size of the weapon. After the
flash a fireball can be seen  to rise, sucking up under it the debris, dust and
living things around the area of the  explosion and as this ascends it soon
becomes recognizable as the familiar Mushroom  Cloud. As a demonstration of the
flash duration test lets try and count the number of  seconds for the flash
emitted by a very small bomb: ... Then a more substantial  medium sized bomb:
... And finally one of our very powerful high yield bombs.&quot;

<P>I'm surprised that with all this grammar talk, nobody has picked up on 
something which deeply disturbs me, a line in &quot;Breathing&quot; that, were I
perhaps a bit  more anal retentive, would truly screw up the entire song:

<P>&quot;You and me knew life itself is breathing&quot; 
</P>
<P>ARRRRRRGGGG! &quot;Me knew&quot;? How could Kate, intelligent,
introspective,  cer-tainly grammatically correct Kate make such a horrid faux
pas? Does anybody  else have any stink with this? The only excuse that I could
possibly find to explain  the blatant deviation of the Queen's English is that
Kate wanted to sing the song  from -- you guessed it -- a child's point of view.
But I myself wouldn't buy that  cop-out for a nickel.

<P>Kate seems to care little for &quot;perfect&quot; grammar and often deviates
from the  Queen's English. If you want perfect grammar, listen to Princess Di
sing -- not  Kate! 
</P>
<P>Besides, if Kate sang &quot;You and I knew life itself is breathing&quot;,
I'd REALLY gag!  First of all, no one really talks that way unless they have a
pole stuck up their ass.  Second of all, I really don't care to be reminded of
inane pendantic high school  English teachers who teach English as it was
PRESCRIBED by a bunch of conceited  scholars a couple of hundred years ago,
rather than the English language as it had  naturally evolved over thousands of
years. These scholars messed around with the  language to suit their own whims
and had their bastardized version officialized  mainly for political reasons to
suppress the lower classes, who would not speak their  new &quot;pristine&quot;
version of the language as the upper classes would learn to. Now,  don't you
feel guilty!

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Breathing 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED (if you're still reading this), could you describe again the
backing vocals of  the last part of &quot;Breathing&quot;? 
</P>
<P>There are some really neat things about the end section of Breathing. First,
the  way the chorus asks questions and the lead vocalist makes statements
recalls the  interaction of chorus and actors in Greek theatre. 
</P>
<P>Of more direct relevance to the song itself, though, is the double-entendre
of the  word &quot;without&quot;. Right up until the last line, the chorus seems
to be asking the simple  question, &quot;What are we going to do without?&quot;
In this case, the word &quot;without&quot; would  seem to be meant as a synonym
for &quot;outside&quot;--as the opposite of &quot;within&quot;. The  meaning of
the question seems to be, therefore, &quot;What are we going to do when we  are
born? When we leave the womb and must face the outside world?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Only in the crashing, climactic last line of the song does it become clear
that this  question is really incomplete--that the entire question is: &quot;What
are we going to do  without breathing ?&quot; And you could also say that both
of these questions by the  chorus are answered by the chorus's final words: &quot;We
are all going to die without  breathing.&quot; (Try reading it this way, as an
answer to the first question, &quot;What are we  going to do without?&quot;: &quot;We
are all going to die without, breathing .&quot;) 
</P>
<P>The really wonderful thing about this play on words is the way it dovetails
with  what the foetus itself (Kate's lead vocal) is saying: &quot;Please let me
breathe! Life is  breathing.&quot; Only with that last note and that last word
do the chorus and the  foetus-heroine conjoin. Both the statement &quot;We are
all going to die without  breathing&quot; and the statement &quot; Life is
breathing&quot; finish up with the common word,  yet they are saying the same
thing from opposite perspectives. Almost in reflection  of that dichotomy, the
last word, &quot;breathing&quot;, is heard backwards (as though the  breath is
finally sucked in--or out?--for the last time), to give the listener a very 
direct sonic impression of &quot;life/without/breathing&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Now IED doesn't argue that all of these things were planned in a completely 
cool-headed, calculating way by Kate when she wrote the song. But I do think
that  they are real, and that a lot of this kind of complex double-meaning comes
about  more or less through artistic instinct. Whatever the degree of
premeditation, IED  thinks it's an absolutely brilliant artistic concept, and
one which Kate has realized  with typical perfection: 
</P>
<P>&quot;What are we going to do without?&quot; <BR> Ooh please! <BR> &quot;What
are we going to do without?&quot; <BR> Let me breathe! <BR> &quot;What are we
going to do without?&quot; <BR> Ooh, Quick! <BR> &quot;We are all going to die
without!&quot; <BR> Breathe in deep! <BR> &quot;What are we going to die
without?&quot; <BR> Leave me something to breathe! <BR> &quot;We are all going
to die without!&quot; <BR> Oh, leave me something to breathe! <BR> &quot;What
are we going to do without?&quot; <BR> Oh, God, please leave us something to
breathe!&quot; <BR> &quot;We are all going to die without <BR> Oh, life
is--Breathing.

<BR> Subject: Arcane KB video influence 
</P>
<P> I think I've unearthed a direct influence on Kate Bush's breakthrough video
 for &quot;Breathing.&quot; The sequence in which Kate falls back out of the
'womb' finally to  appear in our world before the altar to the sun looks very
much to me like it is  based on a transitional scene in the first episode of the
second season of Rock  Follies, &quot;Rock Follies of '77,&quot; called &quot;The
Band Who Wouldn't Die.&quot; Anybody  remember this? 
</P>
<P>Orientation: Howard Schuman and Andy Mackay's &quot;Rock Follies&quot;
played Thames  TV in England in 1976 and 1977. Each year consisted of a set of
six hour-long shows.  The first year comes to a kind of completion that suggests
to me that a second year  was not a sure thing. It fact it was only the first
year's six shows that played in the  United States in 1977-78, mostly as a
pledge drive special on a number of PBS stations.  I have tape of both seasons,
from the 1987-88 late-night broadcast of the series on  WNET ch. 13 in New York;
I don't know whether other PBS stations ran it that year  or not. I also don't
know whether it was ever rebroadcast in other countries, or is  still in any
kind of circulation in the UK. In many ways it is a classic show--casting, 
music, writing--but it was particularly ahead of its time in its use of video
technique  to move out of realistic narrative time into the strange time-worlds
of the songs. Five  years ahead of MTV, it remains an original and seminal
vision of an integration of  video technique with music. I am very confident
that if Kate was watching it, she  enjoyed it hugely and took inspiration from
it. 
</P>
<P>When the series came back for a second year, its fictitious band the &quot;Little
 Ladies,&quot; Dee (Devonia Rose, Julie Covington), Q (Nancy Quinelle de
Longchamp,  Rula Lenska), and Ann (Charlotte Cornwell), were an actual hit pop
act and had an  album out (Island Records ILPS 9362-B), of songs from the first
season (not the same  performances as on the show, however, and without the
title tune, &quot;Little Ladies&quot;).  The first episode of that comeback
year, &quot;The Band Who Wouldn't Die,&quot; culminates  in a scene in the
office of a brassy manager named Kitty Schriver, who offers to buy  the Little
Ladies as an act, manage them and produce records for them. As the Little 
Ladies leave her office, the show makes one of its patented segues into a song,
the  title song for the episode. What happens visually is that the three women
step out of  the door to Kitty's office into a darkness into which they fall,
downwards, in slow  motion, slowly rolling down a barely visible black inflated
huge plastic pillow. The  effect is exactly the same as what Kate does in &quot;Breathing&quot;
in her slow-motion  twisting fall into time and destiny. It looks to me like
technically both sequences  were done the same way, with a large inflated dark
plastic pillow. 
</P>
<P>Anybody out there in a position to comment? Do the Little Ladies still have
fans?

<P>Not really, I just wanted to thank you for this post. It certainly sounds
possible.  Chris vaguely remembers reading somewhere (perhaps in an old issue of
 Homeground??) that Kate and Julie Covington are friends too. Perhaps. Whatever,
 Julie certainly liked the song TKI enough to record it and treated it very 
respectfully. She has a beautiful voice.
