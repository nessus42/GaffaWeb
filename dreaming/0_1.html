<p>Hello friends, 

</p>



<p>

In Aug. 1995 I worked myself through the jungle of 1993/1994

lovehounds-mail to find  some Deeper Understanding ('?'). </p>



<p>Wow, and I finished everything in 3 weeks. The result is something I

called: Moments - A Red Shoes Collection, and it contains everything I 

found interesting for me concerning &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. Initially 

I did this for my own purpose, only. It is not THE collection, but A collection. </p>



<p>I separated the mail in different categories. Mainly: a) TRS, b) anything

else  interesting, c) trash. The last item was the biggest one :-). I

deleted more than 3/4 of everything. But the rest is really timeless and

worth to be collected. 

</p>



<p>How I did it: </p>



<p>

First I selected the interesting content and deleted the unneccesary parts

(longish  headers, Hello Graham!) and signatures (Hello Graham! Your

address is not very  thrilling!). I left &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Subject&quot;. I

also deleted sometimes substantial parts of the mail, if they were not

interesting (to me), repetitions or personal things. I changed sometimes

the subject entry, to fit better to the actual subject. I also corrected

some obvious spelling errors etc. I made a very few comments by myself, 

they come in [ ] with my short WIE in case of doubt. 

</p>



<p>Quotes were a little problem, because the &quot;&gt;&quot; signs are useless after

making up the pages for grouped style. So, quotes are now started with a

&quot;&gt;&quot;, but not in front of  every line, only at the beginning of each

paragraph. The quote is separated from the following statement, by a blank

line. 

</p>



<p>I ordered the mails in different categories: 

</p>





<p>

<a href="1_0.html">1.0. History </a><br>

<a href="2_0.html">2.0. The Music</a><br>

<a href="3_0.html">3.0. The Film </a><br>

<a href="4_0.html">4.0. Words</a><br>

<a href="5_0.html">5.0. Miscellaneous </a><br>

</p>









<p>Edited for printing it's ca. 400 pages (hui!). 

</p>



<p>Maybe not everything is complete, it just reflects my own preferences. For

example, I am not so much interested in your 'best of' things and ratings,

like: &quot;Eat  the Music&quot;: C-, or &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;: B+ etc. I have my own

list in my head and  that's enough. 

</p>



<p>I also deleted: 

</p>



<p>- most of the Lily/Angel stuff, 'cause it gave no new inside into the

  subject, as  Chris pointed out unsuccessfully in the very beginning. 

</p>



<p>- Sex and the 'Symbol' stuff: mainly abstruse theories. 

</p>



<p>If I skipped something, that should be definitely included, please tell

me!  Especially, if there are more interviews, please mail them to me or to

the group! 

</p>



<p>It's my sincere hope, that this imperfect medley helps somehow to a new, 

completely revised edition of The Garden. I think, it's a heavy burden on

IED's shoulder. This is my little contribution. 

</p>



<p>Thank you all, for doing the work. IED and Andrew Marvick for the Garden 

and their prolonged efforts to keep you on the kateian track, Ron Hill for

his  Cloudbusting (both invaluable compilations!), Uli for his continuous

distribution of  information and all the people who hacked in the lyrics,

reviews and interviews. Thank you! 

</p>



<p>Other things/people that attracted my special attention: 

</p>



<p>- IED: Still mysterious, but definetly no human being. &quot;Some groups have a 

moderator. We have an Enforcer. IED enforces the KaTe orthodoxy. Whenever

he's away from the group (say, because Andrew Marvick is pursuing

something trivial like a Ph.D.), the group begins to drift, become unruly,

and has less KaTe content.&quot; (Andy Gough) 

</p>



<p>- Andrew Marvick = apostle Peter, head of the fundamentalist church of Kate 

Bush. KaTe is God (Amen!). It's unbelievable to me how he managed it to

work on  his doctoral thesis and do *on the side* all his investigations.

Or was that IED? 

</p>



<p>- stev0: &quot;The Line, the Cross, the Curve and Her Lover&quot; Master of the Joke! 

Some of his contributions are absolute masterpieces. &quot;If Lovehounds is a

game, I win!&quot; You really should go professional! Give us another one! 

</p>



<p>I always jump nervously on my seat, if one of the above mentioned names

apears in &quot;From&quot;. 

</p>



<p>- Uli: distributor and editor of the holy FAQ. He also worked on THE 

discography: Out now! It comes on 12 CD's with a 1054 pages booklet. 

</p>



<p>- Jon-&quot;Eat the Music&quot; *still* sucks!&quot;-Drukman: a strong fighter, with a

warm heart. But caution when you say something that provokes contradiction.

Jump behind the lines when he rises. He and stev0 always carry guns (and

heavy-duty gaffa-tape) and come in full metal jackets. 

</p>



<p>- Homeground-Peter: Good for short urgent HG-Towers-information, but 

generally more a taker. That's a great pity, because I think, he has so

much to give! Maybe we should ask him more!!! Ooh, he has compiled a 15

pages videolist!

</p>



<p>- Vickie: Who discovered, that you have to break your earphones to get a 

complete inside into &quot;The Dreaming&quot;! (phase cancelation) 

</p>



<p>and:

</p>



<p>-Brian J Dillard: &quot;I dropped my walkman last night and now it plays

backwards! so I should have all sorts of wonderful new insights to share

with all of you very very soon . . &quot; 

</p>



<p>- Chris: something like the answer-man of the group. With stoical coolness

he answers all the questions, that come up every month or so. 

</p>



<p>- Karen Newcombe: Always at her place. IED says: &quot;She's, in his opinion,

the best thing that's happened to Kate Bush fandom in AGES.&quot; 

</p>



<p>- Scott Telford: provider of the TRS-discography and many other front-line

 reports. 

</p>



<p>- Prof. Manchester, who educates us with his well-founded statements. 

</p>



<p>- Doug: the fabulous LH founder, |&gt;oug /\lan said: &quot;John Carder Bush told

me all sorts of things that Kate would do her best to avoid talking

about.&quot; - Can you please enlighten us!!! 

</p>



<p>And: 

</p>



<p>

- 334 subscribers 13.5.94 <br>

- only once in these two years someone (in this music oriented group)

referred to specified notes/keys: Jonathan Forward: &quot;When was the inferior

D,D,up an octave &amp; F replaced by the much better D,C,F,D,Bflat,F?&quot; (conc.

DWBMA) <br>

- also only once someone posted a GIF! 

</p>



<p>- we also have a Super-Dave! <br>

- a Jorn &quot;All-I-wanted-was-a-Pepsi&quot; Barger <br>

- a Marcel &quot;De Efteling is in Kaatsheuvel, not Amsterdam. Not even &quot;near&quot; 

Amsterdam&quot; Rijs 

</p>



<p>- Charlie Baum: the guy with the strangest story: his friend saw a Miami

Vice  episode with the &quot;Hello Earth&quot; piece in it. He instantly recognized

it as a georgian  tune and taped it. Then he played it to Charles (also a

georgian music expert), who  tracked it down to KaTe and got hooked. So BTW

he brought this georgian subject  to our all attention. 

</p>



<p>- and: David Eugene Vinson: &quot;Can anybody out there confirm my existence?

Uli  doesn't believe in me, but I  could swear that I have been around

since the end of  October. Have there been any confirmed sightings of me

during that time? I want to  live!!!!&quot; 

</p>



<p>So, that was 2 years lovehounds in 3 weeks. Okay, here it is. Do with it what you want! 

</p>



<p>Once again: if you want something to be included, tell me with good reasons

and send it to me or the group. 

</p>



<p>I hope, you'll enjoy reading! Don't drive too slowly! 

</p>

entirely mad!
