    <P>(for me anyway) </P>
    
    <P>I broke my headphones and it's been wonderful! :) I got the cord caught
      under the chair and something went very weird. The lead vocals of whatever
      I'm listening to almost completely disappear, and so everything is
      practically an instrumental, except that some of the way background and
      hidden sounds, and some vocal overdubs are right *there*. At first I
      cursed the chair and the cord (and myself, for not watching what I was
      doing) but then I heard some vocals and instruments that I'd never heard
      before! I was listening to _Building The Colossus_ (Happy's new album, for
      you gaffians) and suddenly heard Happy singing things, and playing guitar
      lines that I'd never heard, and I've listened to this album at least 50
      times. </P>
    
    <P>That got me to go get The Dreaming and Hounds of Love, and I have been
      having a *GREAT* time!! Listening like this, to albums that I know so very
      well, is amazing. I'm hearing voices, and instruments and sound effects
      that I never knew existed. I can't even express how fantastic this is!!
    </P>
    
    <P>The Dreaming is *already* full of voices and sound effects, and
      listening to it normally, I still hear new things every time I listen to
      it, which is one reason it's my all-time favorite album of all-time, by
      anybody. Yet, tonight, each song revealed *dozens* of new things! Details
      just *poured* forth....especially in songs like TD and Get Out Of My House
      (I mean, footsteps, and locks clicking and separate doors slamming and
      grunts and screams and all kinds of things). </P>
    
    <P>This really confirms my understanding of why Kate considers TD to be her
      favorite album. She put so many details in there that no one could ever
      possibly hear everything. People who like it will never get tired of it.
      It also confirms my (long-held anyway) conviction that if I had to live
      with only one album, TD would be it. </P>
    
    <P>While I was overwhelmed with details while listening to TD, there are
      less details on Hounds. It's still cool to hear most of the songs as &quot;instrumentals&quot;
      with occasional voices popping out (especially on &quot;Waking The Witch&quot;)
      but it's just not as full of suprises as TD. The one song that did
      suprised me with hidden interesting things was &quot;Mother Stands For
      Comfort&quot; strangely enough. The piano lines and broken glass are
      prominent, and a lot more is done with those two things than you would
      imagine. &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; (which is my second favorite thing
      after the whole of TD) didn't yield the bounty that I expected. I know
      there are lots of things there, but I didn't really hear anything that I
      hadn't already heard. Maybe it's the way it was recorded, I don't know.
    </P>
    
    <P>So, I said it was trivial (definitely more trivial than someone
      mentioning Kate Bush on Oprah Winfrey a few weeks ago, which I kept
      forgetting to post about...a guest told someone to &quot;listen to 'Don't
      Give Up' by Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush&quot; to help ease emotional
      pain...which was cool) but I'm having fun. I think I'll check out Never
      For Ever next :-). </P>
    
    <P>Vickie (who has to decide between getting new headphones and keeping
      these so I can hear all the details again, or letting Chris fix 'em) </P>

    <P>I just decided...I have to keep them. I put on &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;
      and that whole beginning section is just the Trio Bulgarka. I love the
      song anyway, and I love Kate's part, but when her part is taken out you
      can concentrate on what the Trio are doing, and it's wonderful! It sounds
      completely different, and, except for that distinctive opening bit (the
      first 10-15 seconds), if someone played this for me I'd never recognize it
      as coming from RT. Very very very strange! That's reason enough to keep
      them :) </P>

    <P>It sounds like you've pulled your ground connection loose from the jack
      but with the ground connections to the left and right phones still
      connected to each other. The result is basically the same configuration as
      is used for simple matrix surround sound systems. It would take a
      scientist to explain it (but I'll give it a shot anyway :)). </P>
    
    <P>What you're hearing is the difference between the left and right
      channels. Sounds that are in phase and perfectly balanced between the left
      and right channels will pretty much dissappear, lead vocals are usually a
      perfect example. The more a sound is on one side or the other the more
      audible it will be. Even more audible will be sounds that are out of phase
      across the left and right channels. Putting in something out of phase is
      usually done to add depth to a sound, although it's sometimes completely
      accidental. </P>
    
    <P>If you have a simple matrix surround system on your stereo you can
      achieve the same affect by turning on matrix surround and turning off the
      front speakers. You won't get the &quot;in your head&quot; affect with
      speakers, of course. </P>

    <P>vickie has just discovered the magic of phase cancellation, a technique
      suggested on the back of brian eno's landmark &quot;ambient 4: on land&quot;
      album as a way of increasing the &quot;spaciousness&quot; of a recording
      without any magic encoding processes. </P>
    
    <P>basically, you take the common information from a stereo recording and
      throw it away, leaving the stuff &quot;on the edges&quot;. usually in pop
      music the stuff in the center is the lead vocals and bass content. so,
      bingo, instant kate instrumentals. </P>
    
    <P>that's also how those &quot;vocal remover&quot; boxes work. i bet if
      vickie got one of those and listened to kate through it, it would sound
      the same as her &quot;broken headphones&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>here endeth the lesson. </P>

    <P>What you have here, folks, is an accidental hookup that connects the
      left and right channels together out of phase so that the center drops
      out. Kate and the drum kit are usually in the center, so they go away,
      leaving just the stuff that's on the sides. </P>
    
    <P>Surround sound, BTW, just takes the &quot;sides-only&quot; signal,
      delays it a bit (equivalent to 10 or 20 feet of distance), and sends it to
      the back speakers. Anyone who has a surround sound setup (AKA &quot;home
      theater&quot;) can hear what Vickie is talking about by turning down the
      main channels and just listening to the surround speakers. </P>
    
    <P>The &quot;broken&quot; headphones may be putting a heavy load on the
      headphone amp in your CD player or receiver. Listening to the surrounds
      (if you have 'em) is probably safer. </P>
    
    <P>There's an electronic gizmo on the market that lets you turn down the
      center and boost the sides. I can't remember what it's called. When I find
      the ad for it, I'll post to r.m.g. </P>
    
    <P>Keep letting the weirdness in! </P>

    <P> Thanks to Richard and Jon for the explainations. We have a main system
      amp with a simple Dolby surround decoder, and have ocasionally listened to
      music through it with the front amp off. But the serendiptious experience
      of her broken headphones had much more impact. </P>
    
    <P> We have a rear amp output, and I could make a sound sample if anyone is
      interested. (Apologies to those who downloaded the broken MPEG audio file.
      I'm currently looking for a better WAV to MPEG encoder.) </P>
    
    <P> Oddly enough, the main brand of vocal remover boxes is known as the &quot;Thompson
      Vocal Eliminator.&quot; It's odd, because Thompson was Vickie's maiden
      name (she was married to a man named Mapes and never bothered to change it
      back.) </P>

    <P>I suspect all that has happened is the earth wire (that's ground for you
      US guys :-) ), has broken so the two speakers in the headphones are series
      connected across the output amps. As you point out, any in-phase sounds
      will be cancelled out thus leaving only the bits that normally appear
      off-centre. When I was a lad (long, long time ago), this was a standard
      practice for getting cheapo quadrophonic (merely connect another set of
      speakers *across* the amps.) It should *not* cause any harm to the amps.
    </P>
    
    <P>Of course, I could be wrong and your CD player might be about to embed
      itself in your ceiling. :-) </P>

    <P>If what Vickie's headphones have done is amplify out-of-phase sounds,
      then you can also get the same results even without a full-blown,
      surround-sound system. What you do is hook up a speaker to the positive
      terminals of boththe left and right channels (no ground connection). Then
      you'll get the difference in the two channels out the one speaker. Having
      the effect in headphones may make it easier to concentrate on what you're
      hearing, though. </P>

    <P>I still consider it pretty amazing that an accidental tug on the 'phones
      cord would have resulted in this effect. Not only must the ground
      connections be broken, but the two ground connections to the two earpieces
      must be shorted..... oh dear, I've just realised that it is quite likely,
      since most 'phones will have a single common ground wire, and therefore
      will already have the two grounds connected together, and so..... my
      apologies, I shouldn't have doubted you (even after the Rocket Man video
      episode :-) </P>
