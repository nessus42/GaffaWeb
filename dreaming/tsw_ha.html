<P>&gt; The absolutely GLORIOUS laugh between Love and Anger and The Fog 
</P>
<P>Having the CD finally answered the question that's been bugging me ever
since  hearing the album: namely, does the laugh belong to the end of &quot;Love
and Anger&quot; or  the beginning of &quot;The Fog&quot;? The answer is, it's
the beginning of &quot;The Fog.&quot; And  what a fantastic song that is. It
broods and brews and bubbles and brims with  ominous intensity.

<P>Not so fast! The laugh is at the beginning of &quot;The Fog&quot; on the US

Anger&quot; on the British CD!  (I'd like to hear what the situation is in other

<P>Yes, but the presence or absence of the laugh on the U.S. Columbia Records

about it:  the laugh, attached as it is to Love and Anger in the original, Kate
Bush-supervised  British edition of the CD, must surely, therefore, be accepted
as authoritative.

<P>I have the cassette tape version and the laugh is at the end of &quot;Love
And Anger&quot;  on it. Although the gap between the two cuts is very short, the
laugh is before the  gap, so I would say it is at the end of L&amp;A and not at

<P>I also got my KBC newsletter a couple of days ago. For additional
information on  the laugh, take a look of the picture of Kate with the tapes of
the finished album  (not including the CD bonus track). On the tape, &quot;Love
And Anger&quot; is 4:43 and &quot;The  Fog&quot; is 5:01. On my US CD, L&amp;A
is 4:39 and &quot;The Fog&quot; is 5:10. There is a bit of silence  at the end
of &quot;The Fog&quot; as well, but the laugh runs 3 to 4 seconds with some echo
 running into the first notes of &quot;The Fog&quot;. Add those three seconds to
&quot;Love An  Anger&quot; and you get 4:43. Of course, the other times on the
CD don't quite match up  exactly to Kate's tape. Especially &quot;This Woman's
Work&quot; which my CD player shows  as 3:40, but when playing it back, it ends
at 3:34 with some negative time before  &quot;Walk Straight Down The Middle&quot;.

<P>Date: Sun, 12 Nov 89 21:59:23 -0600 <BR> From: Michael Mendelson &lt;mendel@cs.uiuc.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: a survey? 
</P>
<P>Obviously, the laugh is on the wrong album entirely! I suggest it is the
result of a  long, often fruitless fight between Kate and the record companies.
For years, Kate  has wanted to insert a laugh between tracks, and for years the
record execs have  nayed the proposition. 
</P>
<P>Originally, the laugh was to go between Strange Phenomena and Kite on TKI. 
When this plan was nixed, Kate decided to place the laugh after Peter Pan on 
Lionheart. And after that on NFE at the very end of the album. Again, to no
avail,  but this time the execs met Kate half way and let her add a little extra
bass at the  end of Breathing instead. 
</P>
<P>Despite the first three rejections, Kate endeavoured once more to include
the  laugh on TD just after Suspended in Gaffa. The execs dismissed this demand
as  unreasonably antagonistic towards the general public who would have a hard
enough  time figuring out just what Gaffa was (not to mention the &quot;WLTWI&quot;
at the  culmination of the very next track) without the added intimidation of a
mocking  laugh. 
</P>
<P>So it was HoL where Kate was first able to sneak in the laugh, cleverly
mixed  *backwards* into the secret message in WYWM, the forward contents of
which  were discovered by fans only recently. Luckily, the record execs never
discovered  this laugh, although its effect is all but lost in the mix. But Kate
was still unsatisfied,  since she knew most people would probably never know the
laugh was even there. 
</P>
<P>TWS was the next candidate for the laugh, but since it had never charted as
a  single, the execs refused. Kate even volunteered to redo the laugh as a &quot;new
vocal&quot;  cut, but alas, no go. 
</P>
<P>Finally, Kate had had enough. &quot;Look,&quot; she said, &quot;no more
albums unless I get a  full, uncut, forward, undistorted laugh on the next one.&quot;
British execs gave in, but  Kate had to change labels in America to have her
demand met. 
</P>
<P>But still, it wasn't easy... a full year of bickering about where the laugh
should go  on the new album ensued and caused unprecedented delays in release.
And now we  see the fruits of Kate's effort: the laugh, in full, is indeed a
part of TSW. But in  attaching the laugh to different songs on the two pressings
of the CD, and omitting it  entirely from the single and the video, it looks
like in the final analysis the bigwigs  still had the last laugh. :-)

it. The long pause is easily attributed (by anyone  whoses spent much time in

<P>Well, it seemed obvious to me that the laugh was a separate event, unrelated
to  any song on the album, that occurred spontaneously. The song &quot;Get It&quot;
on Paul  McCartney's &quot;Tug Of War&quot; features Carl Perkins, and at the
end of the song, he  gives a nice long laugh, apparently enjoying the duet with
Paul. The story goes,  though, that it was spliced onto the end of the song, and
was in fact Carl's response  to a particularly dirty joke Paul told him. 
</P>
<P>Perhaps something similar happened with Kate. Maybe, for whatever reason,
she  laughed, it was recorded, and she decided to put it on the album for the
hell of it.  Maybe (gasp) she was just having fun!

<P>I forget who mentioned it first, but I think it is entirely possible that
the Laugh  belongs all to itself. When I first listened to &quot;Never for Ever&quot;
(before looking closely  at the cover) I thought that &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;
had an a capella intro. Later I realized  that it was a short piece with a title
all its own (Night Scented Stock). Maybe she's  done the same thing here, only
with a laugh instead of a short piece of singing. The  laugh, of course,
wouldn't warrant a title or track number of its own.

<P>I assume you all remember my survey about whether the laugh belonged to &quot;The
 Fog&quot; or &quot;Love And Anger,&quot; right? Well, I got a bunch of answers,
and here's the  verdict. 
</P>
<P>Of the six respondents, five thought it went with &quot;The Fog&quot; with
the odd man out  thinking it belonged to neither song and was just a piece of
audio flotsam thrown in  for no apparent reason by Kate. Most of the respondents
said that the laugh sounded  &quot;right&quot; with &quot;The Fog.&quot; Some
claimed that if it were part of LAA, then it would  detract from the finality of
the &quot;Yeah!&quot; The most succinct observation was provided,  as usual, by
our Humble Pseudo-Moderator |&gt;oug who said: 
</P>
<P>&gt; It's obvious to anyone who isn't an inane idiot that it belongs at the
beginning  of &quot;The Fog&quot;. Geez.

<P>When I interviewed Kate, she said that JC had this novel idea about using a
laugh  track as the beginning and end of two different songs. The laugh appears
as the end  of &quot;Love and Anger&quot; and the beginning of &quot;The Fog&quot;.
It was recorded backwards  and inserted into the tape machine sideways, using a
mike in an arcane string-wood  instrument from the Middle East made popular in
Werner Herzog/Hammer  ventures. If CBS wasn't run by brain-dead idiots, it would
have been released  properly, as in the UK, where the laugh alternates with each
play as to which track  it belongs.

<P>Does anyone have a copy of the record? If so, in which set of grooves does
the  laugh fall, those for Love and Anger or those for The Fog, or is it
indeterminate?  You can find this out by watching the needle as the record
plays. I'd check it myself  but I don't have a copy of the record.

<P>It occurs to me that the position on the record is far more significant than

</P>
<P>Got my 7&quot; (w/ gatefold sleeve) and 12&quot; versions of the UK &quot;Love
and Anger&quot;  today. I was under the mistaken impression that &quot;Ken&quot;
wasn't on the 12&quot; or I  wouldn't have bought the 7&quot;, but I'm sure glad
I did! 
</P>
<P>I was listening to the B-side, thinking, &quot;Gee, this isn't as good as
some of her  other stuff - and that Del Palmer has a ways to go as a mixing
engineer&quot;, and then I  noticed a subtle difference in the wording of the &quot;Love
and Anger&quot; credit on the 7&quot;  and the 12&quot;. And then I looked, and,
sure enough, there were exactly four more  seconds of music on the 12&quot; (odd
amount to add for a remix, I thought, and then, I  said, &quot;Wait a minute...&quot;).

</P>
<P>I didn't want to skip to the end, so I listened to the whole thing -and
then, after  that &quot;Yeah!&quot;. &quot;&lt;pause&gt;...&lt;LAUGH!!!!!&gt;&quot;

</P>
<P>It was so excellent I nearly creamed my jeans. 
</P>
<P>And it's not on the 7&quot;!!!! (Which ends with the &quot;Yeah!&quot;). 
</P>
<P>Now, they credit the 7&quot; as having the mix that appears on The Sensual
World, and  the 12&quot; as &quot;...original version available on ... The
Sensual World &quot;, so, in some sense,  that would seem to indicate that the
original intent was that the laugh belongs either  A) with &quot;The Fog&quot;,
or B) just as a bit of banding between songs, but ...

<P>You gotta hand it to her for exploiting the collective weenieness extant!!!

<P>Now the presence of the laugh on the Love and Anger 12&quot; clearly proves
it has  absolutely nothing to do with The Fog. Whatever the labels say about
mixing (I do  not have then yet to check the wording or whether anything else in
the mix is  different) the laugh has been placed with Love and Anger. Therefore
you (and many  others) were wrong. So why not admit it - you know you will feel

<P>The Laugh is just another addition to the very long list of things Kate adds
to her  music to enable people to interpret whatever-it-is in different ways. If
Jon feels that  the laugh is a perfect intro to TF because of its girlish
childhood memory sound  (sorry jsd, I can't remember what you said exactly or
even if it was you who said it)  then fine, it belongs at the beginning of TF.
If you or I think that it's the perfect  ending to L&amp;A because, well, what
other kind of reaction could there be to that  &quot;Yeah!&quot;, well, then, it
belongs at the end of L&amp;A. This is the perfect example of a no  right or

think  one can really pay much attention to CD programming, what with Kate's
admirable  tendency to link songs together without any silence separating them.
I occasionally  like to shuffle &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, which is a horrible
thing to do because you lose the  continuity between The Dreaming and Night of
the Swallow. Similar things occur  when shuffling &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;,
which is also dumb because the entire Ninth Wave  sequence simply *must* be
heard in order. My personal theory (and one which  makes good sense, if I do say
so myself) is that there's a space of silence between  the &quot;yeah&quot; and
the laugh, whereas there's a negligible space between the laugh and  the intro
to &quot;The Fog&quot;. It would seem easier for the programmers to separate
where  there is enough space; the idea that maybe Kate intended the laugh to be
&quot;packaged&quot;  with &quot;Love and Anger&quot; was probably much less
important, particularly if you listen  to the album in order.

<P>Just another long-time lurker offering a different point of view: 
</P>
<P>I have no objective data supporting either theory, but I've always
rationalized the  laugh-Fog connection by assuming that the playfulness in the
laugh was intended to  convey a sense of childhood nostalgia, which is not
incompatible with the theme in  The Fog. Somewhat weak, I know, but not
unreasonable.

<P>I bought the 12&quot; copy of Love and Anger from Gaslight Records some time
ago,  and the laugh is included at the end of that song.

<P>Stuart Castergine sez: 
</P>
<P>&gt; A couple nights ago, I stepped backwards one track to the beginning of
The Fog  and the laugh was included! 
</P>
<P>the laugh is not included on the &quot;love and anger&quot; promo cd single.
nor is it on the  official single either, as i recall. not that this means
any-thing, as vickie correctly  pointed out. 
</P>
<P>i've always felt that it belonged with &quot;the fog&quot; since it's a
nervous laugh...which  syncs up better with someone learning to let go ala the
protagonist of &quot;the fog.&quot;

<P>Well, I tend to think that settles that, myself. (maybe because it supports
my  opinion) 
</P>
<P>I just can't put the laugh and &quot;The Fog&quot; together. 
</P>
<P>But have we considered another little possibility? 
</P>
<P>Perhaps the laugh is intended on its own? As *between* the two songs, or
even as  a link between them? Perhaps tomorrow I shall have time to compare the
lyrics and  themes--it could definitely be intended to tie the two songs
together in some way.

</P>
<P>I just assumed the laugh belongs to The Fog ('...a little nervous
laughter...'), and  never even considered it might belong to 'Love and Anger'.
It is *not* included in  the video to 'Love and Anger', which I assume Kate had
a little more control over  than where the break comes in the CD or which single
includes what. 
</P>
<P>So, imnsho, it belongs with The Fog, and nowhere else. (Why *would* you
laugh  after Love and Anger, could someone please explain?)

The Laugh 
</P>
<P>Hi! 
</P>
<P>Wow, now I'm feeling old... you're recycling arguments from my first days as
a  Love-Hound, back when TSW first came out. It's interesting to see how the 
arguments haven't changed. And some of the answers haven't changed, either. 
</P>
<P>The laugh belongs neither to L&amp;A or &quot;The Fog&quot;. It has no place
in either, and I  believe it appears on that one single format as a mistake.
Different CD players track  it differently (z.B. my CD player at home tracks it
as ending L&amp;A, while the ones at  the radio station track it as starting off
&quot;The Fog&quot;. If it belonged to either one, it  would be with one or the
other. 
</P>
<P>I think Kate stuck it in there as an amusing bridge between the two songs,
and  somehow when the CDs were made the instruction to put it in a track of its
own got  lost. That's it, end of story. 
</P>
<P>(Pardon me, I'm feeling rather Drukman-esque this afternoon. ;) 
</P>
<P>Of course, the real reason behind the ambiguity is that Kate decided to
really  give us computer fools something to chew on... but I wasn't supposed to
tell you  that.

<P>To add to the confusion, I compared my US and UK CD versions of The Sensual 
World. The results? 
</P>
<P>On the UK CD, the laugh is at the end of track 2, &quot;Love and Anger&quot;.

</P>
<P>On the US CD, the laugh is at the beginning of track 3, &quot;The Fog&quot;.

</P>
<P>I guess you can associate it with whatever you want.
