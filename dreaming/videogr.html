Subject: Kate Bush -- The Collection 
</p>



<p>Hello once again fellow Love-Hounds--
</p>

<p>I've finally compiled a listing of the videos which appear on my KT tape. I 
apologize for keeping you all in suspense like this, but I had to go back and 
physically watch the tape again because the actual playing order differs greatly from 
the order which is listed on the back of the video jacket. So here goes, and please 
bear with me. I've tried to be as detailed as possible, but I frankly have no idea as to 
what dates many of these clips were shown. Enjoy. 
</p>



<p>Kate Bush -- The Collection 
</p>



<p>1) &quot;The Wedding List&quot; As far as I can tell, this was shot during the Secret 
Policeman's Ball, circa 1980-81. Among the other musicians on stage are Pete 
Townsend on guitar, wearing a gray Nehru jacket and trousers, looking much as I 
envision him from his &quot;All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes&quot; days. Phil Collins is 
on drums, dressed much as he used to be in Genesis' Abacab days, wearing khakis 
and a Hawaiian shirt. As for Kate, she is wearing a ballerina-style gown, with a tight 
gold satin bodice with thin spaghetti straps, and a tea-length tomato-colored netting 
skirt. She has knee-high black boots on her feet. One humorous (if embarassing for 
Kate) item is the fact that by the end of the number, BOTH of the gown's straps 
have broken, and Kate finishes the song clutching the bodice of her gown so she 
doesn't fall out! :) 
</p>

<p>2a) &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; This is the 1978 (?) SNL performance 
Kate did while Eric Idle was the show's host. In this video, Kate is wearing her 
gold-lame' jumpsuit again, singing while perched on top of a piano. As for the 
&quot;shooting-up&quot; gesture she makes, I didn't really think it all that explicit (I didn't 
even catch it the first time I watched the video). Anyway, another point of interest is 
the fact that the piano is being played by Paul Schaeffer of David Letterman fame. 
</p>

<p>2b) &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; Again, from SNL. In this version of the song, Kate is 
sporting a tan trenchcoat and a dark brown fedora, along with knee-high tan boots. 
Personally, I find this particular performance a bit hampered by the fact that Kate 
has to hold a microphone, which really limits the amount of hand gestures she can 
make while dancing. Thank goodness for those headset type mikes they have now... 
:) 
</p>

<p>3) &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; I have no idea where or when this video was taken. The 
setting appears to be in some sort of dance club, because there are people all over a 
dance floor, gyrating and drinking as Kate performs. For this particular version of 
the song, Kate is dressed &quot;unusually&quot; in a black tux with tails, a white tux shirt, and 
black high heels. Her face is heavily made-up and her hair is brushed back from 
her face rather severely (and I have to confess that I don't like that look on her at 
all). At any rate, Kate gets a good reception of the song at the end of the 
performance. On a bad note, the quality of this clip is particularly bad. 
</p>

<p>4) &quot;Babooshka&quot; This lip-synch version of the song appears to have been 
performed on some sort of talk-show (Christmas?) program. In this clip, Kate is 
performing in front of a large curtained backdrop which changes with various 
wintry scenes (people skating, sleigh-riding, etc). She is wearing a black sparkly 
cape which she keeps drawn around her during the song's verses, but which she 
flings open during the chorus to reveal a knee-length, long-sleeved black sparkly 
dress and spike heels. The left side of the dress is slit almost up to her waist. 
Towards the end of the song, Kate raises her arms to hold the cape, bat-like, out to 
the sides, and she is silhouetted against the backdrop. The song ends, and, as the 
audience applauds, a gentleman dressed as a sailor or naval officer runs in from the 
left, sweeps Kate up into his arms, and runs offstage to general laughter. 
</p>

<p>5) &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; This lip-synched version features Kate performing on a 
large, open stage area, wearing a light blue/grey jump suit and dancing on three 
large white steps; her hair is engagingly mussed. A series of brightly colored 
buildings appear in the backdrop. I can only guess that this was a Top of the Pops 
type performance, but I have no idea of the date. Again, this clip is of pretty poor 
quality. 
</p>

<p>6) &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot; Here's the one everyone's been clamoring 
about! This charming little number features Kate in a large fan-back wicker chair 
with red cushions, wearing a long-sleeved red jumpsuit. She is barefoot. A Christmas 
tree and a table covered with Christmas presents appears to the left. As Kate sings, 
she kind of lolls around in the chair and sprinkles &quot;snowflakes&quot; around. It's 
cute....and sexy at the same time. 
</p>

<p>7) &quot;Babooshka&quot; Here's another mystery show that Kate appeared on! It's hosted 
by 7 country-style singers! Anyway, in this particular version of the song, Kate is 
standing, her right side turned to face the audience. Her face is heavily made-up and 
her hair is pulled back severely from her face. She is wearing a high-necked, 
long-sleeved jumpsuit. She remains standing with her right side facing outward 
during each set of lyrics, but during the chorus she turns to face the camera fully, 
and we see that Kate is painted half-and-half! The &quot;wild side&quot; of Kate has a great 
flying mane of glitzy hair, a face covered with gold and black lightning bolts, and is 
wearing a gold and silver metallic jumpsuit with a large gold choker at the throat. 
It's quite weird to see Kate done up this way, but it's definitely effective! Talk about 
'two sides' to every personality! :) Which, of course, in this instance is exactly what 
Kate had in mind. After her Babooshka performance, Kate joins the 7 hosts and sits 
chatting with them; the majority of the conversation dwells on Kate's costume and 
her &quot;dual&quot; personality. One of the hosts then introduces the video for... 
</p>

<p>8) &quot;Delius&quot; This is by far one of the lovliest things I've ever seen Kate do. The 
background of the video is very lush and green, and is slightly &quot;hazy&quot;, making it 
look like a very hot, humid summer's day. Up above Kate and to the left, is &quot;Old 
Man Summer&quot;, sitting up in a wheelchair with a rug over his knees. He's sporting a 
smoking jacket and a bright yellow sun mask. Meanwhile, below him, Kate seems to 
glide and float around the stage in a confectioner's dream of a gown, all spun in 
white gauze and feathers and lace. Kate holds two slim 'wands' which are concealed 
inside the sleeves/gloves of the gown, and she uses these to flutter and flap her 
&quot;wings&quot;. The effect, overall and in a word, is heavenly. I like the video better each 
time I watch it. 
</p>

<p>9) &quot;Babooshka&quot; -- last few seconds of the &quot;official&quot; video before going into 
Razzmatazz. In this children's talk show, Kate is sitting with the show's hostess in a 
circle of several dozen lucky schoolchildren. Kate is wearing a red tank top and 
floral skirt, with high-heeled sandals on her feet. The children ask questions of Kate 
as to how it is to make videos, etc., and short clips from &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; and &quot;The 
Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; are shown. After some more discussion, Kate 
eventually reaches into her bag of goodies and produces some of the props used in 
the &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; video: the dance cap, the jester's cap, the bull horns, and her 
own ballerina gown. Once she has all the various hats perched on some of the kids' 
heads, the entire &quot;official&quot; video for &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; is shown. 
</p>

<p>10) Rock Awards 1979 -- Kate's first appearance is to come out on stage to 
announce the winner of the Best Male Performer for 1979, Gary Numan, who is 
interviewed briefly from Pittsburgh. When Kate comes out to announce the winner, 
she is wearing a light-blue, fringed top over tight-fitting dark blue or black pants, 
and heels. She chats with the host a bit, and then announces Numan. 
</p>

<p>Later in this segment, Kate is announced as the winner of the Best Female 
Performer for 1979, and the &quot;purple dress&quot; version of &quot;Wow&quot; is then shown. 
</p>

<p>11) &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; -- this is what I like to refer to as the &quot;light bulb&quot; 
version of this song, in which the bulb slowly swings back and forth above Kate at 
the song's opening. Kate is wearing a straw fedora hat, with a figure-flattering 
black T-shirt, a magenta satin skirt, and heels. The only thing I don't like about this 
version is that they cut out the little chair-smashing scene which ensues between 
Kate and the two male dancers. 
</p>

<p>12) Cooking show -- I mentioned this once before in Love-Hounds, but for those 
of you who missed it, this clip features Kate discussing the virtues of vegetarianism 
with the show's hostess. Kate is wearing a red blouse with a mandarin-style collar, 
with black and white leaf patterns covering the blouse. Among some of the dishes 
she's prepared: brown rice; Waldorf Salad; a summer salad with watercress, lettuce, 
bean sprouts and oranges; sauteed mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, and carrots; fresh 
fruit salad with yogurt/honey dressing, and roasted sunflower seeds. 
</p>

<p>13) Russell Hart TV talk show -- discussion with host and with Eric Fenby 
regarding the Delius video. Here Kate is wearing a high-necked, long-sleeved grey 
spangled blouse, a below-the-knee blue sequined skirt, and heels. 
</p>

<p>14) Abbreviated version of &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; video 
</p>

<p>15) First two minutes of &quot;official&quot; &quot;Breathing&quot; video 
</p>

<p>16) Another unidentified talk show -- here Kate is simply discussing her 
background/history with the show's host. She is looking really stunning here (so 
what else is new, I know...this is just my personal opinion) in (again) a high-necked, 
long-sleeved black sequined dress, with black mid-shin tie-up boots on. 
</p>

<p>17) Entire &quot;The Dreaming&quot; video 
</p>

<p>18) Old Grey Whistle Test talk show -- Kate chatting with two hosts. She is 
wearing an off-white peasant blouse with much colorful embroidery, a blue satin 
mini-skirt, what appear to be hot pink tights, and white boots. Unfortunately, the 
camera is either too far away from Kate or is too focused on her face for me to 
really tell what she's wearing below the waist. :) 
</p>

<p>19) &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; -- this appears to be something performed as a 
lip-synch for Top of the Pops or something. Kate does this one with 2 male dancers, 
and is wearing black leather pants, a white T-shirt with red suspenders, black gloves 
(with the fingers cut out), and black ankle boots. There is a fairly good-sized crowd 
of people standing around, as if on a dance floor. 
</p>

<p>20) Music Box -- since this is really only a trivia/ contest question concerning 
Kate, Kate is never really shown. The show's hosts do make a plug for Hounds of 
Love, and then ask the trivia question &quot;Who wrote Wuthering Heights?&quot; :) 
</p>

<p>21) Interview with Kate taken from Dutch talk show (both the host and Kate are 
speaking English; Dutch subtitles appear below). Kate is wearing a dark jacket over 
a white blouse, with large spangly earrings! But beware! Those of you who don't 
like how Kate looks with jowls, don't watch this last bit! ;) 
</p>

<p>---
</p>

<p>WHEW! Well, now that my poor fingers are numb from all this typing, I guess 
it's time to send this off to Love-Hounds so the rest of you can enjoy reading all this! 
</p>

<p>Enjoy.... 
</p>

<p>All the best, <br>

<p>A few remarks on your remarks... 
</p>

<p>&gt; 11) &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; -- this is what I like to refer to as the &quot;light bulb&quot; 
version of this song, in which the bulb slowly swings back and forth above Kate at

version is that they cut out the little chair-smashing scene which ensues between 
Kate and the two male dancers. 
</p>



<p>This is the video found on The Single File. It seems like the song was redone, or 
at least remixed for this video since it has a much more 'live' sound. Maybe it was 
recorded live with the performance but that's hard to believe since the audio is so 
clean and I don't recall seeing any mikes. 
</p>

<p>The chair smashing scene is just one more example of... &quot;KTean Violence&quot; I 
guess I'll call it, which I fully intend to do an essay on someday. Basically it consists 
of a sort of poetic or stylized violence. &quot;People getting their heads blown off very 
beautifully in slow motion,&quot; is how Kate once described what I'm talking about. 
</p>



<p>&gt; 12) Cooking show -- I mentioned this once before in Love-Hounds, but for those 
of you who missed it, this clip features Kate discussing the virtues of vegetarianism 
with the show's hostess. 
</p>



<p>Kate, I've seen what you've been eating. Stop by anytime. We'll throw some 
steaks on the grill and talk about this vegetarian thing. (Just a joke, you wacky 
vegetarians. You can eat what you like but I'm omnivorous! :-) ). 
</p>

<p>Very interesting, thanks Deb. I plan on watching the tape that I have sometime 
this week so if I can I'll post a list of what's on it.

<p> &lt;This, one of the best of all Kate's video interviews (in IED's op.), is from a 
programme called The Desmond Morris Show. The interviewer, D. M., is better 
known as a zoologist who has written some very good books about dog and cat 
behaviour. He also has some smart things to say about modern popular music.&gt;

</p>



<p> &lt;Actually, if you look carefully at the background, you can see part of the show's 
title sign on a back wall: Razzmatazz. And contrary to what someone else had to say 
about this clip recently in this group, this lip-synch routine for TGAT is absolutely 
brilliant, genius work. Anyone who thinks otherwise is advised to watch it several 
more times through.&gt;

</p>



<p>Deb Wentorf recently posted a (very) descriptive list of the clips on the video 
tape Kate Bush: The Collection. While the majority of the clips were not familiar, 
the first clip was known to me. This performance of The Wedding List comes from 
the Prince's Trust Concert (21 July 1982). If memory serves, Kate only performed 
Running Up That Hill and Let It Be at the Secret Policeman's Third Ball. 
</p>

<p>By the way, anyone lucky enough to have seen Kate's performance of The 
Wedding List (available on the U.S. video release of the Prince's Trust Concert) 
knows that Kate has nerves of steel. When her straps snapped, Kate didn't even 
flinch. Just the slightest hint of a smile and she carried on with the song without 
missing a beat. Robert Cole

<p>IED: 
</p>

<p>&gt; This, one of the best of all Kate's video interviews (in IED's op.), is from a 
programme called The Desmond Morris Show. The interviewer, D. M., is better 
known as a zoologist who has written some very good books about dog and cat 
behaviour. He also has some smart things to say about modern popular music.&gt; 
</p>



<p>IED! Shame on you! You should know better. The TV program in question is 
called &quot;Friday Night Saturday Morning&quot; and Dr. Morris (who wrote the books 
Manwatching and The Naked Ape ) was just a guest host that night. This show 
alternated different guest hosts. He asked Kate Bush to be a guest on the show 
because he was a big fan of her's. Kate catches his zoology background in a 
particularly interesting way. He says something like (paraphrasing here) &quot;I find 
watching you is hypnotic, almost like a cobra&quot;. And Kate replies &quot;Well, 
Ssssssssssssssss is the obvious answer isn't it?&quot; 
</p>

<p>Yeah, it's one of the best interviews around. It's fun too because it's obvious that 
Desmond Morris really likes Kate, but he keeps telling her how odd she is. It's very 
cute. At this time, she was in the middle of recording The Dreaming, and she says 
something like &quot;I know the music so well, I know it forwards, I know it backwards 
sometimes&quot;. A cool little reference to the end of &quot;Leave It Open&quot; eh? 
</p>



<p>&gt; After her Babooshka performance, Kate joins the 7 hosts and sits chatting with 
them; the majority of the conversation dwells on Kate's costume and her &quot;dual&quot; 
personality. One of the hosts then introduces the video for... 
</p>



<p>Watch this closely, they talk &amp; talk and Kate never gets to say one word! I 
wonder if these dorks (actually, I used to be a fan of these guys) ever in the future 
realized that they had the most intelligent musician they would ever be privileged to 
meet sitting there between them and they didn't let her say a word. I can see it now 
&quot;Oh my God, what did we do? What a wasted opportunity, shall we commit suicide 
now or what?&quot; It's a dream I have. :-) 
</p>



<p>&gt; 10) Rock Awards 1979 
</p>



<p>What's funny about this one is that Gary Numan is somewhere else when he 
&quot;accepts&quot; his award. His thanks are being beamed in via sattelite and he seems very 
weird and out of it. 
</p>

<p>When Kate accepts her award, the first thing she says is &quot;I'm glad I'm not on 
sattelite because it looks like it *really* freaks you out&quot;! 
</p>

<p>She's so neat! 
</p>

<p>Btw, the BBC edited that version of &quot;Wow&quot;. If you look closely, during the part 
where she pats her behind for the line &quot;He's too busy hitting the Vaseline&quot;, they 
don't actually show her patting her arse. I forget exactly what they did, fade it or 
something, but the censors evidently didn't want their precious viewership to see a 
pop star making obvious references to homosexuality in prime time. My goodness, 
what prudes. 
</p>



<p>&gt; 18) Old Grey Whistle Test talk show -- Kate chatting with two hosts. She is 
wearing an off-white peasant blouse with much colorful embroidery, a blue satin 
mini-skirt, what appear to be hot pink tights, and white boots. Unfortunately, the 
camera is either too far away from Kate or is too focused on her face for me to 
really tell what she's wearing below the waist. :) 
</p>



<p>This one's a classic. Those two guys are officially known as &quot;The Twit Twins&quot; 
(OK, &quot;officially&quot; to Chris &amp; I). These jerks have no idea what Kate is about or what 
she's trying to do and are totally oblivious to the fact that a bona-fide genius is 
sitting there with them. They do a wonderful job of insulting the intelligence of 
Kate, her fans, the viewers and every living breathing thing within 20,000,000 miles 
of the studio they're sitting in. The sweet thing is, Kate knows it! Yet she's so sweet, 
smiling, biding her time to get her quiet little jabs in, which of course fly right over 
the heads of these two nincompoops. 
</p>

<p>For instance, one of them asks &quot;what is a digeridu?&quot; and Kate says, very softly to 
herself, &quot;what is a digeridu?&quot; meaning that these two guys are total stupidos and 
doesn't everyone know what a digeridu is? She wouldn't have done that with 
anyone else. I think she's more than happy to explain about her weirder 
instruments and she knew that the general public would probably be unaware of the 
existance of the digeridu, she just had had it with these two mental dwarves and it 
was her quiet way of telling them what idiots they were. Of course, they didn't catch 
it, just went right on saying things like &quot;this song has something to do with Australia, 
is that right?&quot; and insulting Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards and telling everyone they 
should run out and buy Tom Tom Club's &quot;Genius Of Love&quot; when they should have 
been telling everyone to run out and buy The Dreaming. Morons, par excellence. 
</p>

<p>Who said there wasn't such a thing a male bimbos? Anyone who has this video 
can attest otherwise.

Subject: The Other Video 
</p>



<p>After reviewing my videotape of miscellaneous TV appearances I've compiled 
the following list of it's contents, numbers in brackets denote the timer count at the 
beginning of the segment. The dates are taken from &quot;Kate Bush Complete&quot;. 
</p>



<p>1) [0:00] Kate's December 1978 appearance on SNL ( #2 on Deb's video). 
</p>

<p>This includes the introduction, The Man with the Child in His Eyes, Them Heavy 
People and the closing. About the &quot;shooting up&quot; gesture, wellll ok, I'll agree that 
it looks that way but I suspect that it really has little bearing on the intent of the 
lyrics. 
</p>

<p>2) [0:08] A portion of the official Army Dreamers video. 
</p>

<p>3) [0:10] December Will Be Magic Again from the December, 1979 BBC &quot;Winter 
Snowtime Special&quot; ( #6 on Deb's video). 
</p>

<p>4) [0:13] An unidentified British TV show discussing Kate's dance training. 
</p>

<p>This shows Kate rehearsing the Sat in Your Lap routine with her dance partners. 
This may be the BBC &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Fit&quot; appearance from August 1981. 
The unseen interviewer remarks on her &quot;rubber trousers&quot; (actually nylon 
warmup pants) and the interview confirms the shocking fact that she does 
indeed &quot;get spots.&quot; Kate notes that she doesn't dance to keep fit, keeping fit is 
just a result of her love for dance. 
</p>

<p>5) [0:17] The appearance on the &quot;Razzamataz&quot; children's show, July 1981 ( #9 on 
Deb's video ). 
</p>

<p>This is the appearance where Kate discusses the making of the Sat In Your Lap 
video. 
</p>

<p>6) [0:27] The Russel Harty show appearance, November, 1980 ( #8/#13 on Deb's 
video.) My version starts with an introduction at the beginning of the show in 
which Harty, wearing boxing gloves and headgear, requires Kate to promise not 
to harm him in any way, listing a variety of means which oddly enough include 
&quot;touch,&quot; and &quot;kiss&quot;. Kate does so sheepishly while hiding a wooden mallet behind 
her back. I guess you have to be a regular viewer to get the joke... 
</p>

<p>It then cuts to the Delius video &lt;sigh&gt; continuing on into the interview with Kate and 
Eric Fenby. 
</p>

<p>7) [0:32] The &quot;Friday Night Saturday Morning&quot; show, hosted by Dr. Desmond Morris, 
November 1981 (evidently #16 on Deb's video). 
</p>

<p>This is indeed and excellent interview. To clarify the remark that Vickie noted: &quot;I 
always find watching you sing - because you do more than listen to you, you 
watch very much as well when you're performing - I always find I feel like a 
mouse confronted with a cobra because there's something hypnotic about it, it's 
very strange. Can you explain it? It's some sort of curious lilt you get into your 
voice which is almost like a incantation. Where did it come from?&quot; &quot;Well, 
Ssssssssssssssss is the obvious one isn't it?&quot; says Kate. 
</p>

<p>Dr. Morris asks her how she sees her art developing and Kate tells him that it would 
definitely develop on stage. &gt;sigh&lt; 
</p>

<p>8) [0:40] &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; talk show appearance, August 1982 (#18 on 
Debs video). This features the first airing of The Dreaming video. Vickie 
accurately characterized the two hosts as &quot;The Twit Twins&quot;. 
</p>

<p>9) [0:48] The There Goes A Tenner performance from &quot;Razzamataz&quot;, September 
1982 (#19 on Deb's video). 
</p>

<p>I had noted before that I don't think that this performance was up to Kate's usual 
standards, IED counters by calling it &quot;absolutely brilliant, genius work&quot; and 
suggests that I watch it several more times through. Well, I have. To me there's 
no question that this performance is sub-par. Kate's concept and choreography 
are up to her usual standards but the performance just doesn't work well, as 
though they needed maybe another hour or two of rehearsal before the shoot. 
Preferably not in a box car :-). Add to that some terrible camera work and those 
cheesey special affects and I doubt that you have something that Kate would be 
happy with. 
</p>

<p>10) [0:51] The &quot;Delia Smith's Cookery Course&quot; appearance (for which I can't locate 
a date). (#12 on Deb's video). 
</p>

<p>Kate notes that a mixture of nuts and sunflower seeds roasted in soy sauce normally 
used to garnish salads can be eaten alone although &quot;It makes you feel a bit like a 
parrot.&quot; 
</p>

<p>11) [0:56] The &quot;Kate&quot; BBC special, December 1979. 
</p>

<p>This is simply great. I'll try to summarize. 
</p>

<p>It opens with a performance of Violin very much like the tour routine. Kate wears a 
spiffy black outfit something like the one pictured on the back of Never For Ever. 
</p>

<p>Next is Symphony in Blue with Kate at the piano. &quot;Good for the blood circulation.&quot; 
This is followed by the standard Them Heavy People routine pretty much as seen 
in the video, complete with zippered blouse and slit skirt. 
</p>

<p>Peter Gabriel does a song by himself at a keyboard of some sort prior to an 
interesting routine for Ran Tan Waltz. Kate is dressed as a man with her hair 
hidden in a hat and fake beard. There are two other people in the routine, both 
men, one dressed as a woman and the other as a baby. The routine is vigorous 
enough that by the it's end Kate has lost both her hat and her beard. 
</p>

<p>Kate does December Will Be Magic Again, once again performing on the piano. 
</p>

<p>The routine that follows for Wedding List seems to have been done live with some 
taped footage edited in. The setting is in the old west and once again Kate 
presents us with her own special brand of poetic violence. 
</p>

<p>The duet of Another Day with Peter Gabriel is performed at a small table with Kate 
and Peter playing the couple from the song. Images of the couple appearing on 
the wall behind them. 
</p>

<p>Kate does a lip-sync of Egypt dressed in middle eastern style garb and dancing in 
front of scenes of Egypt. One interesting feature of Kate's outfit is a black band 
that stretches across her face, covering her nose. At first I thought this was 
supposed to be some sort of strange veil-like thing that wouldn't cover her 
mouth but it's more likely intended to hide her nose, presenting a sphinx-like 
visage. 
</p>

<p>Next comes The Man with the Child in His Eyes. Kate is again at the piano. A small 
image of her performing her standard choreography for the song is superimposed 
to appear to be sitting on the piano. 
</p>

<p>The show closes with Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake, performed pretty 
much the same as in the tour. 
</p>

<p>12) [1:40] Part of &quot;Kate Bush in Concert&quot;, a German show that includes clips from 
tour and an interview done in April 1980. 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is only fifteen minutes out of a forty-five minute show. It does 
include a clips Strange Phenomena and Room for the Life from the Tour. 
</p>

<p>13) [1:55] The Don't Give Up video with Kate and Peter Gabriel. 
</p>

<p>Woj answered: <br>
&gt;&gt;dunno if anyone saw them live, but you can see at least one on video. one of the 
selections on the video bootleg, &quot;the collection,&quot; is a pub performance of &quot;them

</p>

<p>*1 This one isn't in any of the usual collection sources. It's definitely *not* from the 
pre-Kick period. And it's definitely not a &quot;pub&quot; preformance. I'd say it's 
&quot;Saturday Night At The Mill.&quot; 
</p>

<p>*2 &amp; *3 Excellent quality versions of these exist, but only in B&amp;W, due to the 
difficulty in translating SECAM to PAL or NTSC. A good quality SECAM copy is 
at the *top* of our want list. This would be a wonderful addition to the next tape 
tree.

Subject: Xmas special video 
</p>



<p>I just thought I'd share this with my fellow KaTe-fanatics out there. There's a 
guy who advertises &quot;rare&quot; videos and such in Goldmine magazine. He's got 3 tapes 
of Kate stuff: 
</p>

<p>1) The Single File and the 1980 BBC Xmas Special (95 mins) <br>
2) Various interviews 1983-1990 (110 mins) <br>
3) German TV documentary, Dutch videos, and SNL performances (70 mins) <br>
</p>


<p>I got the Xmas special video, and the quality is incredible. Looks like maybe a 1st 
or 2nd generation dub. No greenish flicker, no washed-out color, or any of that bad 
PAL conversion stuff. It's got a few minor glitches every once in a while, but other 
than that it's beautiful. Sound quality isn't bad, either. And having The Single File 
on the same tape doesn't hurt either. The tapes are $25 each, but well worth it if 
they're all as good as this one. If anyone is interested, e-mail me and I'll give you 
the address.

<p>As it is a bootleg set of videos, especially in the case of _The Single File_ (a 
commercial release) feel totally free to make copies of this guys tapes. The more 
copies you make, the better. 
</p>

<p>We will be doing a new tape tree, with the repaired Christmas special on it. The 
copy that we have is a 3/4&quot; digital conversion from a 1/2&quot; PAL original. We also have 
the German documentary, a 2nd generation SNL, and a pretty good copy (the best 
that I've seen in circulation) of the Dutch videos. I'm very interested if this copy of 
the Dutch videos are better than the one on the last tape tree. 
</p>

<p>All of the PAL stuff in our collection is digitally converted. If everyone can wait 
until the next tape tree, you can have this stuff for the cost of a tape and postage.

<p>Marcel also states that the German TV program, &quot;Kate Bush in Concert&quot;, had no 
Dutch counterpart. In fact, there were two editions of that program, one for the 
Dutch market -- it is dubbed differently than the German original. IED (like Chris 
and Vickie) has seen both. 
</p>

<p>Also, Marcel may inadvertantly be misleading some Love-Hounds when he refers 
to &quot;hundreds&quot; of full-length live shows given by Kate. In fact, the number was much 
smaller than that, and some of them weren't even full-length (she caught a cold or 
the 'flu during the tour's move from England to the Continent, and some shows 
were shortened). In any event, only one video-recording has ever been confirmed, 
and Chris reported accurately that the unreleased portions of that recording are 
very likely to remain so.

Subject: Die Efteling Tapes etc.
</p>



<p>Hi everyone, 
</p>

<p>I am starting the new year very good by reading &quot;The Garden&quot;. IED did a great 
job compiling the lot, and I recommend everyone to get this electronic publication 
asap if it's not already in your possession. 
</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are a few points of interest that I want to bring to everyones 
attention. 
</p>



<p>&gt; 10. Die Efteling Tapes: Six videos (some refer to seven, but I only know of six), 
taped in the Efteling Gardens (a gothic theme-park), Amsterdam, April 1978. 
</p>



<p>As I have stated in the past, De Efteling can be found not in Amsterdam, but in 
Kaatsheuvel, in the south of Holland. (Last year it has been proclaimed the best 
amusement park in the world btw.) 
</p>



<p>&gt; 11. Wuthering Heights: lip-synch, on an April, 1978 edition of German TV 
programme Top Pop. Note: Ruud says this is a Dutch programme. Peter says it is 
German. 
</p>



<p>Toppop was a Dutch programme, which ran, either from 1970 or 1975, until the 
late 1980s. I presume this recording is from this programme. I have never heard 
from a German Toppop. Maybe Uli knows. I have to assume this is a Dutch 
performance until proven otherwise. 
</p>



<p>&gt; 13. Voor de Vuist Weg, Kate's appearance on the Dutch TV show, April 1978. I 
do not know what this appearance consists of. Peter mentions it in his chronology, 
but I have never seen the clip.) 
</p>



<p>&quot;Voor de vuist weg&quot; was a talk-show by the world-famous (well, in Holland 
anyway) Willem Duys. Kate appeared in this show to perform &quot;Wuthering heights&quot;, 
probably lip-synching. At the end of her appearance she received a rose from 
Willem. Regrettably, I don't have a recording of this appearance. 
</p>



<p>&gt; 100. Music Box: Kate is interviewed at some length, at the London Palladium. 
Shown on U.K. (Sky) TV, ca. 1985-86. I have never seen this interview. 
</p>



<p>Dunno if this has been talked about on the list already in the past, but I have this 
special, be it slightly edited (I cut out the Cloudbusting video 'cos I had recorded it 
several times before then - what a shame.) One can place it at the end of 1985, and 
the programme lasted for some 60 minutes. If it is still unknown by most of you, I 
can transcribe the lot. But I'm wondering if this is really such an unknown 
programme...?

</p>



<p>Peter Manchester wrote up all the events, and I think I can add some stuff: 
</p>

<p>&gt; This was followed by a 40 minute compilation of rare (some not so rare) videos: 
a lip-synch of HoL with Paddy and the band, at the end of which the male 
accompanist from Kate's video entered and the two of them danced as in the video; 
</p>



<p>BPI Awards 
</p>



<p>&gt; the &quot;Rocket Man&quot; b&amp;w video; &quot;Delius&quot;; 
</p>



<p>Delius was originally broadcast in the Dr. Hook show where Kate showed the 
'alternate' Babooshka video (two sided makeup version), where Kate was 
interviewed and didn't say a word, and where the Delius video was introduced as 
&quot;The (ever) delicious Kate Bush&quot;. The same video later was also included in the 
Russel Harty Show where Kate was interviewed together with Julian Lloyd Webber 
and Eric (In B!) Fenby. 
</p>



<p>&gt; what looked like an early study for &quot;Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake&quot; 
for the Tour; 
</p>



<p>That was from the Leo Sayer show. 
</p>



<p>&gt; a &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; very much like the Hammersmith show, except with Kate 
lip-synching the vocal; 
</p>



<p>That's from the Australian programme 'Countdown'. 
</p>



<p>&gt; a fascinating live &quot;Room for the Life&quot; from the camera that was following Kate 
at the Hammersmith show, using what looked like the big stage `egg' familiar from 
&quot;Them Heavy People,&quot; except seen from the other side, where it was lined with red 
satin, with Kate reclining in it as though in bed; 
</p>



<p>At first I thought that was the performance that can be seen in the German &quot;In 
Concert&quot; documentary, but the ending was different and Chris ensured me that this 
really was part of the most rare AND most interesting Kate video availlable. It's 
from 'the rest of the best'... 
</p>



<p>&gt; an unfamiliar &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; lip-synched with the whole band on a 
metal-framed stage; 
</p>



<p>That was the Top Of The Pops appearance of RUTH.

<p>Speaking of the Lovehounds Collection, I think there's an error in the listings, 
the section claimed to be Hounds of Love on Top of the Pops, is in fact HoL being

space. That may have been the &quot;official&quot; answer, but many supposedly lost films have 
wound up in private hands. For instance, our copy of the videos came from a copy 
that was dubbed from the copy owned by a former president of EMI-America. The

<p>&gt;Question: where did this stuff come from?? especially the early 80s when there 
were few home VCRs so it's unlikely that the material was taped from a broadcast. 
</p>



<p>Some of us did have VCRs though. My first Kate taping was shortly after SNL. I 
didn't have it for SNL or the repeat, but I taped the videos for The Man With The 
Child In His Eyes and Wuthering Heights off of Don Kirshner's Rock Concert . 
That was (I think) 1980. It was a top-loading VHS machine with a rotary tuner. 
Other people had Betamax machines before that, so yeah, a lot of this stuff was 
recorded at the time. 
</p>



<p>&gt;Supplemental: why does (or did) she go on Wogan so much, and not a more 
music-oriented program? 
</p>



<p> She liked him, and it was one of her Mom's favorite shows. Kate made a special 
point of appearing on his show between albums. She knew that her Mom would be 
watching, and he made a special point of asking Hannah to &quot;get well soon.&quot; Sadly, 
she didn't.

<p>My friend, I don't &quot;claim&quot; anything. Kate appeared four times on TOTP when 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was at no.1. She appeared at least once before. The &quot;red slacks&quot; 
performance was her first ever appearance BEFORE the single was no.1. I saw it!

</p>



<p>IED must apologize to Marcel. He received from Peter FitzGerald-Morris via 
e-mail more or less the same useful information that Marcel offered above, and 
Peter's information was confirmed by Uli Grepel, also via e-mail. Unfortunately IED 
did not think to update the issue in rec.music.gaffa. As this is important Kate 
Bushological history, however, a more thorough review of the facts as they are 
currently understood by this fan is, he ventures to say, not entirely out of place here. 
</p>



<p>The obvious explanation of the problem Marcel has so deftly put before the 
philocanine community is that IED's entries in The Garden for TotP performances 
of WH are, indeed, *wrong*. (There are, alas! many other such inaccuracies in that 
nevertheless worthy text.) Not just two TotP appearances were made by Kate Bush 
in early 1978 -- there were at least four, and it seems probable that there were five! 
</p>

<p>Peter's description of a red-trousers version is certainly accurate, although as far 
as IED knows there is no available video-recording of this first appearance. As 
Marcel correctly supposes, this version dates from before the single had reached No. 
1 on the charts. 
</p>

<p>There are probably four more TotP appearances (in addition to airings of the 
official video). Of these, IED has seen two, one of which (possibly appearance No. 4) 
shows Kate standing in a long, more or less plain black dress. The other (perhaps 
appearance No. 2, only part of which is known to IED) has Kate in a white 
dressing-gown, and looks a good deal like the official (post-Rockflix) video. This is 
the version of which an excerpt was later shown on the 1978 Ask Aspel appearance. 
</p>

<p>Of the two remaining TotP appearances, IED hopes and believes that one or both 
of these were among the two versions that were recently aired in a re-run of TotP 
(referred to by Marcel above). One (perhaps TotP appearance No. 3?) features Kate 
seated at the piano while singing the song. IED has no definite information about the 
fifth appearance, if, as seems likely, it occurred. 
</p>

<p>IED would greatly appreciate from Marcel a detailed description of the two TotP 
versions which were recently shown again on TV in Europe. 
</p>



<p>There are also television performances of Wuthering Heights from Top Pop, 
Magpie, Scene '78 and Pop-Rock (aka Bio's Bahnhof); and of course there are four 
&quot;official&quot; versions on video: one is the outdoor film featuring Kate in a red dress (the 
Rockflix production), another is the Keef-produced studio promo, the third is the 
Wuthering Heights segment of the Efteling collection, and the fourth is the live 
finale of the Hammersmith Odeon film. Also, a clip of a performance of the song 
from either the April 28 Hamburg concert or the May 8 Mannheim concert was 
included in the German special, &quot;Kate Bush in Concert&quot;. Still another live clip of this 
song from the 13/14 May 1979 (Hammersmith) concerts may have been shown in June 
1979 in a Dutch television film called Countdown Special, although as this programme 
has still not been seen or heard by IED, he cannot say whether the song was 
included. And, finally, as far as IED knows, Kate may have performed the song 
during her (as yet untraced) appearances on Voor de Vuist Weg and the 1978 San 
Remo music festival (televised in Italy). Btw, what does Voor de Vuist Weg mean? 
</p>



<p>Thus, in total, certainly thirteen, probably at least fourteen, and possibly as many 
as sixteen different performances of Wuthering Heights have been committed to 
video-tape.

<p>The recording I sent to Chris for the next tape tree project was grabbed off UK 
Gold. I did briefly try to work out what algorithm they were using for the reruns 
but gave up in frustration (it certainly wasn't chronological). 
</p>

<p>I can say the following things about the recording Chris now has with absolute 
certainty: 
</p>

<p>1. Kate wasn't at Number 1. 
</p>

<p>2. Kate wasn't wearing red slacks. 
</p>

<p>It may well be that Kate only appeared *live* on TotP twice (as stated in The 
Garden) despite being at Number 1 for 4 weeks because it was quite common for 
them to *rebroadcast* performances from previous shows.

<p>The passage in &quot;Kate Bush complete&quot; and &quot;The garden&quot; should read: 
</p>



<p>&quot;[April 1978] <br>
[...] Kate makes a 25 minute television special at De Efteling in Kaatsheuvel, a 
fairy theme park. She also performs on the VOOR DE VUIST WEG TV 
programme.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Just so you know. 
</p>



<p>Which brings me to the following subject: 
</p>

<p>Kate's performance on &quot;Voor de vuist weg&quot;, her first Dutch TV appearance by 
the way (&quot;De Efteling&quot; was screened later) is very rare, it seems. I am wondering if 
there is anyone at all on this list who has a video copy of this appearance. (If so, 
e-mail me :-) 
</p>

<p>That is why I contacted the broadcasting company, the Dutch AVRO, to ask if I 
could obtain a video from this programme. The Dutch TV keeps archives of their 
programmes, although in the 1970's a lot of these programmes have been erased due 
to whatever (I don't know). They are really frustrated to have erased several 
Jacksons appearances in Dutch TV programmes... I just hope they didn't erase Kate 
as well... 
</p>

<p>Anyway, I will receive an answer from the AVRO in due time. I'll keep you 
informed! 
</p>

<p>(Of course my obtaining of a copy from the AVRO won't allow me to make 
copies from that video as you understand it's prohibited... Oh well, we'll see what 
happens next year in the 1995 Love-Hounds Collection... ;-)

Subject: Top of the Pops 
</p>



<p>Regarding the Top of the Pops videos: 
</p>

<p>Well, as we now have descriptions of at least four distinct &quot;TotP&quot; performances of 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, we know that IED's earlier tally of only two is incorrect. This 
means either that one of the five &quot;TotP&quot; appearances that IED has reason to think 
exist was simply a rebroadcast of one of the earlier ones, or that there were actually 
SIX appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, in addition to screenings of the video! 
</p>

<p>IED notes that Peter FitzGerald-Morris's reports do not explicitly discount the 
possibility that there might have been more than one performance by Kate of &quot;WH&quot; 
on &quot;TotP&quot; BEFORE the single had reached No. 1 on the charts, but six does sound a 
little excessive, doesn't it? What is the source of Geoff's certainty that the 
appearance he refers to above did not correspond to a No. 1 week? 
</p>

<p>As IED now has it, the sequence of appearances may have gone something like 
this: 
</p>



<p>WH1: <br>
January/February (?), 1978 &quot;Rockflix&quot; video (UK) <br>
Original video for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, made by Rockflix, showing Kate in a red 
dress, performing outdoors; sometimes called the &quot;moors&quot; or &quot;field&quot; video. 
</p>



<p>WH2: <br>
February ?, 1978 &quot;Scene '78&quot; (West Germany) <br>
A lip-synch. ? of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH3: <br>
February ?, 1978 &quot;Top Pop&quot; (Netherlands) <br>
A lip-synch. ? of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH4: <br>
February 9, 1978 &quot;Pop-Rock&quot; WDR-TV (West Germany) <br>
From &quot;Bio's Bahnhof&quot;; features a live performance of&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH5: <br>
February 16, 1978 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (UK, BBC1) <br>
The first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance. Black top, red slacks and black stilettos; a 
rerecorded lip-synch. ? (no. 1 of at least 5) &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (not yet at No. 1). 
</p>



<p>WH6: <br>
March ?, 1978 &quot;Magpie&quot; (UK, Thames TV) <br>
A rerecorded and filmed version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH7: <br>
March (?), 1978 &quot;Keef&quot; video for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (UK) <br>
The official video, finished around this time (?), and aired on UK TV numerous 
times (?). 
</p>



<p>WH8: <br>
March 9, 1978 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (UK, BBC1) <br>
A rerecorded lip-synch. ? (no. 2 of 5) of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;: a &quot;white 
nightgown&quot; version, of which an excerpt is later shown on &quot;Ask Aspel&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH9: <br>
March 16, 1978 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (UK, BBC1) <br>
A rerecorded lip-synch. ? (no. 3 of 5) of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, probably the one 
w/Kate sitting at the piano: it's not the first, and Uli has said it seems &quot;earlier&quot; than 
WH10. 
</p>



<p>WH10: <br>
March 23, 1978 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (UK, BBC1) <br>
A rerecorded (no. 4 of 5) version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, probably the &quot;long 
black dress version&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH11: <br>
March 30, 1978 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (UK, BBC1) <br>
A rerecorded lip-synch. ? (No. 5 of 5) of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH12: <br>
April ?, 1978 &quot;Voor de Vuist Weg&quot; (Netherlands) <br>
One Dutch viewer reports that &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was performed. 
</p>



<p>WH13: <br>
May ?, 1978 &quot;Kate Bush&quot; (Netherlands) <br>
A special film from De Eftelung theme park, including a performance of 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH14: <br>
April 28 or May 8, 1979 &quot;Kate Bush in Concert&quot; (Germany) <br>
A Tour of Life documentary with live material from Hamburg 28 April 1979 and 
Mannheim 8 May 1979, including footage of a performance of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>WH 15: <br>
May 13, 1979 &quot;Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon&quot; (UK) <br>
The performance from which the film &quot;Live at Hammersmith Odeon&quot; was made, 
including footage of a performance of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>



<p>In addition, a sixth Top of the Pops performance may (if the recent report proves 
accurate) have been aired, one which would have dated from before the single 
reached No. 1, or in other words before March 9, 1978. 
</p>

<p>Kate might have performed the song again on a special Dutch edition of the series 
&quot;Countdown&quot;; and ditto the San Remo Music Festival. 
</p>



<p>All this would mean a possible total of eighteen different performances of 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; exists, or existed at one time. 
</p>

<p>IED would appreciate any further help anyone might be able to offer, as the 
subject, though exceedingly dull to all but IED and his ilk, has yet to be absolutely 
bled to death.

<p>PAL = Phase Alternate Line. 
</p>

<p>&quot;A composite color standard similar to NTSC [National Television System 
Committee], except that the V-axis subcarrier reference signal inverts in phase at 
the horizontal line rate (ie., phase alternation at the line rate of the R-Y component 
of the chrominance signal). Most applications are in the 625/50/2:1 systems [common 
in Europe etc.]&quot; 
</p>

<p>PAL is a way of carrying the coloUr in a video signal. It was developed after 
NTSC and provides better results. NTSC has the nickname &quot;Never Tice the Same 
Colour&quot; because it can suffer from HUE changes. With PAL the hue remains the 
same although the saturation of the colour (it's deepness) might change a bit. 
</p>

<p>PAL/NTSC is only to do with colour. Unfortunately there are many other 
technical problems that mean video tapes from the States can't easily be viewed by 
people over here. This is why we need standards converters or multi-standard VCRs 
and TVs -isn't life a bitch ?

Subject: Total Tape Integration -- KommenTs 
</p>



<p>Now that the new Love-Hounds video collection is starting to become available to 
people, IED thought some of you might want to know a little about its contents. 
</p>



<p>1. Top of the Pops, February 1978: &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (lip-synch at the piano). 
</p>

<p>Now you know why IED was asking all those boring follow-up questions about 
the various &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; performances from the old Top of the Pops 
programme on UK TV from 1978. The first clip on the new tape is the TotP &quot;piano 
version&quot;, which, as far as IED is aware, has not been available in the U.S. before. 
</p>



<p> 2. Fruitopia ad No. 1a: &quot;Summer Solstice&quot;. 
</p>

<p>This tape's original raison-d'etre was the collection of all of Kate Bush's 
Fruitopia spots in one place, in order to make the music available to any Kate Bush 
fan who wanted it. This is one of the first spots to be broadcast in the U.S. -- a 
longer, widescreen version of the same spot was the first seen in theaters (it is 
included toward the end of this tape). The tape gathers a total of ten different Kate 
Bush Fruitopia &quot;scores&quot;: &quot;Summer Solstice&quot;, &quot;Nice&quot;, &quot;Fighting Fruit&quot;, &quot;Soul&quot;, 
&quot;Thirsty&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Person&quot;, &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Where Were You?&quot;, and &quot;Some People&quot;, as 
well as the Japanese &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; and the sixty-second version, called &quot;What 
If?&quot;). Of these, only &quot;Some People&quot; is a &quot;new&quot; ad -- that is, not among the initial 
batch of Fruitopia spots. It promotes the newer, lighter-tasting line of drinks, 
including the Iced Teas. Although other &quot;new&quot; spots have aired for these new 
flavors, this is the only one that features new Kate Bush music -- all of the others 
just recycle older scores with new graphics. 
</p>

<p>Six of the ten Fruitopia spots in this collection come from a promotional tape that 
Karen Newcombe snagged for us. The balance were taken off U.S. TV. 
</p>



<p> 3. The Seventh Annual Tokyo Song Festival, June 1978: &quot;Moving&quot; (live 
performance). 
</p>

<p>4. Sound in 'S' (Japan), June 1978: &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;, &quot;The Long and 
Winding Road&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Rolling the Ball&quot; [sic) (live performances). 
</p>

<p>5. Fruitopia ad No. 1b (&quot;Summer Solstice&quot;, Japan). 
</p>

<p>These Japanese clips are among the most entertaining of all Kate Bush artifacts. 
We have Sozo Yamamoto to thank for the much improved picture quality of the 
present copies, as well as for the wonderful 15-second Japanese edition of the 
Fruitopia &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; spot. 
</p>



<p> 6. Parodies, 1978-1979. 
</p>

<p>The first of these is an interview with Kate Bush in which she watches and 
comments on Faith Brown's parody of the Rockflix &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; video; this 
is followed by Brown's parody of &quot;Wow&quot; (to which is appended a relevant clip from 
&quot;Musical Chairs&quot;, a BBC film about Keith MacMillan's videos), Brown's &quot;interview&quot; 
with &quot;Kate Bush&quot; and her performance of the old pop standard, &quot;Three Little 
Fishes&quot;; and finally, Pamela Stephenson's &quot;Oh, England, My Leotard&quot;, a parody from 
&quot;Not the Nine O'Clock News&quot;, 1979. 
</p>



<p> 8. Fantastico (Italy) : &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, 1985. 
</p>

<p>This lip-synch is the only Kate Bush performance of this song of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; 
other than the original. 
</p>



<p>10. Don't Give Up, 1986. 
</p>

<p>This is a montage of the two official Peter Gabriel videos, merging the live 
audio-track from the only performance Kate Bush has given of &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; to 
date (London, 1987) with parts of the two official Peter Gabriel videos of the song. 
</p>



<p>12. This Is Your Life (Nigel Kennedy), 1990. 
</p>

<p>This is a brief clip showing Kate Bush's guest spot on an episode of the 
long-running British version of this old TV show. In this episode the &quot;victim&quot; was 
Nigel Kennedy, and Kate appears very briefly. 
</p>



<p>14. The Wogan Show: &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, 1990 (lip-synch.). 
</p>

<p>15. &quot;Rocket Man&quot; ad (UK TV). 
</p>



<p>16. The Last Show on Earth (titles), 1992. 
</p>

<p>This is just the title sequence of a U.S. documentary that was aired on Public 
Television in 1992, using a large part of Kate's &quot;Hello Earth&quot; as the soundtrack. 
</p>



<p>18. The London Film Festival. 
</p>

<p>This is the first bit of unofficial, fan-generated video of Kate Bush that IED has 
ever encountered. It shows Kate introducing the premiere of &quot;The Line, The Cross, 
and the Curve&quot; at the British Film Festival, 1994. 
</p>



<p>20. MTV: &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, the alternate, or &quot;MTV&quot; version, 1994. 
</p>



<p>22. Top of the Pops: &quot;And So Is Love&quot;, 1994 (lip-synch). 
</p>

<p>One of the best latter-years performances, in IED's opinion -- given that these 
are collectively characterized by a relative lack of commitment and choreographic 
prep-work by Kate Bush, this one at least is expressively static and spare. 
</p>



<p>24. Kate Bush, with Larry Adler: &quot;The Man I Love&quot; (video for &quot;The Glory of 
Gershwin&quot;, 1994). 
</p>



<p>26. &quot;RockPop&quot; (Netherlands): &quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; (&quot;Mrs Mop&quot;), 
1980 (lip-synchs.). 
</p>

<p>The &quot;Mrs Mop&quot; (Mopp?) performance is included here (out of chronological 
order) mainly because it's one of IED's favorites. We're fortunate to have this 
improved copy from Love-Hound Marcel Rijs. 
</p>



<p>27. The Seiko commercial (1978). 
</p>

<p>Apart from the Fruitopia spots and the various TV ads for Kate Bush's own 
releases, this is the only advertisement she has done to date. It aired on Japanese 
TV, and as far as IED is aware, this crummy copy is the best one available so far. 
</p>



<p>29. &quot;May I ask you what you're doing?&quot;: a short film by John Light. 
</p>



<p>This compilation was the result of a collaboration by IED (Andrew Marvick), 
John Light and Karen Newcombe, but we couldn't have done it without the help of 
a lot of other generous and talented folks, most of whom are credited at the end of 
the tape. 
</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy it!! 
</p>

<p>It is with sorrow that I announce that Rand Worrell, who did some very nice 
animation for us for Total Tape Integration, died of AIDS on Tuesday, October 17th. 
</p>

<p>Our tape was his last animation project. Rand was one of the top animators 
working on the Mac platform, and he pioneered complex and exacting animations of 
organic life forms. 
</p>

<p>He has worked on several movies and his work is featured by both Electric Image 
Animation Systems and FormZ 3-D modeling systems as examples of the best that 
can be done with their systems. He was recently featured in Computer Graphics 
World, and has been published in computer magazines frequently. At the time he 
first became ill he was entertaining offers from BOTH Disney and Industrial Light 
and Magic -- not a small accomplishment! 
</p>

<p>During his last months of illness he got much enjoyment from seeing TLTCTC 
(moments of pleasure was his favourite) and the finished Total Tape Integration 
project. 
</p>

<p>Rand and I have been close for 20 years, and my life will be very different 
without him. 
</p>

<p>Thanks to those Love Hounds who have been so supportive. I have really 
appreciated your affection. 
</p>
