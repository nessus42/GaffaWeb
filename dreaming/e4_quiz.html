      <BR> Subject: *** DIE-HARD Kate Bush Fan Quiz ANSWERS *** </P>
    
    <P>1.) In 1982 Kate, in an article written for the Kate Bush Club
      Newsletter, described how she instructed her musicians to play their
      parts--generally not with traditional musical terms, but via visual
      imagery. In the case of Eberhard Weber's bass part for Pull Out the Pin,
      for example, Kate saw &quot;a panther, stalking through the jungle.&quot;
      She used a similar image later, when describing work on the Hounds of Love
      sessions. IED assumes that the bassline, if associable with a specific
      character in the song, represents the Viet Cong guerrilla fighter, not the
      clumsy, disheartened U.S. G.I. </P>
    
    <P>2.) The rhythm track on Jig of Life was suggested to Kate by her brother
      Paddy, who heard something like it in a recording he himself had made of
      what he identified as a Greek (or Northern Italian) &quot;fire dance&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>3.) The &quot;fall of Jericho&quot; was a bit of a trick question. The
      name Jericho should immediately suggest the video of Experiment IV to all
      Kate Bush fans, since that film features a Dr. Jerry Coe in a lead role.
      When Dr. Coe arrives at the secret laboratories at the beginning of the
      video the time on the clock reads twelve o'clock noon. Toward the end of
      the disastrous fourth experiment, the time can be made out on a
      wristwatch--about 5:30 p.m. So, the answer to the question is &quot;about
      five and a half or six hours. </P>
    
    <P>4) (birdsong in Deeper Understanding and And Dream of Sheep..., Ne
      T'enfuis pas ; Night of the Swallow ; Kite ; Harry the Dragonfly; Kate's
      dove earrings; Kate as bat (back of Never For Ever ); Kate as swan (
      Delius video); references to &quot;rolling over on the great big cloud&quot;
      and to Superman, the Wright brothers, and astronauts in The Big Sky (song
      and video); space travel in Hello Earth and Keeping Me Waiting ;
      rocket-flight in Rocket's Tail and Rocket Man ; etc.) </P>
    
    <P>5) Something Like a Song, Need Your Loving, Davey, You Were the Star,
      Gay Farewell, Cussi Cussi, Atlantis, Sunsi, Disbelieving Angel, Go Now
      While You Can. </P>
    
    <P>6) Apparently, Kate herself. This was the name given for the Editor of
      the first few issues of The Kate Bush Club Newsletter as well as the
      author of Leaving My Tracks, which was Kate's aborted autobiography. </P>
    
    <P>7) False. Although there a quotes from Kate saying that her second and
      third album weren't released in the US until the Eighties, that isn't
      quite true. Some copies of the album were released in 1979, and there is a
      picture of one in the Illustrated Collector's Guide to Kate Bush. </P>
    
    <P>8) It's in The Stone Book, one of Kate's favorite childhood books. </P>
    
    <P>9) Blow Away, Carmilla, Disbelieving Angel, Experiment IV, Get Out Of My
      House, Hammer Horror, Hello Earth, Houdini, Running Up That Hill,
      Suspended In Gaffa, Under Ice, Waking The Witch, Watching You Without Me.
    </P>
    
    <P>10) Wine, coffee, bitter almonds, and tea in Coffee Homeground. Seedcake
      in The Sensual World. Cheap wine in Frightened Eyes. Captain's biscuit in
      The Handsome Cabin Boy (there was a line with &quot;tot of rum&quot; that
      wasn't included in Kate's version). Marshmellows in In The Warm Room.
      Cornfields in Never Be Mine. Cold red beef, Game pie and colder beer in
      Organic Acid. Drink in Ran Tan Waltz. Hot butter in You're Soft. </P>
