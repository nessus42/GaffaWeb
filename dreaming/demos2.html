      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: Demo news </P>
    
    <P>In the May '89 issue of the Dutch Kate Bush fanzine Kate, co-editor (and
      longtime penpal of IED's) Theo Haast writes about the 22 demos. As far as
      IED could make out (the fanzine's text is in Dutch), Theo recently visited
      the U.S., and while there he obtained a copy of the 22 demos on a
      cassette. Apparently his copy was from an earlier generation, or at least
      a different source, because his version came with a listing of titles.
      Some of his titles are definitely wrong, but others are so apt that they
      suggest the possibility that some of the titles were Kate's original ones.
      No way to know for sure. </P>
    
    <P>But the bigger news is that Theo's tape contained, in addition to the 22
      demos (identified as dating from 1976, quite plausibly), an additional 6
      demos &quot;from 1977&quot;. Of these, however, only one is a song that
      fans have never heard before. Note: IED does not have these six demos, and
      it may be quite some time (if ever) before he finds a copy. Anyway, here
      are the titles, as Theo lists them: </P>
    
    <P> The first 22 songs: </P>
    
    <P> The Kick Inside </P>
    
    <P>Hammer Horror </P>
    
    <P>Kashka From Baghdad </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: The origin </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Back to the obsKuriTies topic, just HOW do people get their hands
      on these rare demos? Steal them from record company archives? From Kate?
      Obviously, Kate doesn't give them to people! Have these bootleggers had
      them for 14 years? Anyone know anything about this? Well, that's enough
      for today. </P>
    
    <P>A good question. IED doesn't know any details (probably no-one but the
      bootleggers themselves do), but he was told by an apparently knowledgeable
      source that the tapes originated from someone in the Manchester Square,
      London offices of EMI--someone &quot;high up&quot; in the corporate
      hierarchy. Who knows? The six demos from 1977 which IED mentioned
      yesterday (but which he has never heard himself, and cannot offer to
      Love-Hounds) would seem to support the idea of a leak at EMI itself, since
      presumably those tapes were made after Kate had definitely signed to EMI.
      This is also probably true of the 22 demos that are now becoming generally
      available, although it is still possible that those recordings were made
      prior to Kate's signing, and therefore might be among some of the tapes
      which Kate submitted to other labels. </P>
    
    <P>IED thinks it very unlikely that whoever got these tapes to the
      bootleggers had had them for fourteen years (or whatever). Remember, these
      are not the same as the &quot;Early Years&quot; demos, which have been
      known about (though never heard) for at least four years now. Those
      recordings may have been in bootleggers' hands for years, but the 22 demos
      in the Cathy Demos collection had never been heard of by fans prior to the
      appearance of the Volume One EP two months ago. It goes without saying
      that all these demos came out against Kate's wishes--very much so. IED has
      heard that she's very upset about this leak. He just hopes Kate can
      forgive L-Hs for their non-profit distribution project... </P>

      <BR> &gt;Has it ever occurred to Monsieur Marvick that perhaps the reason
      some
      <BR>&gt;of us do not rush to buy his illegal bootlegs is out of respect
      for Ms. Bush
      <BR>&gt; and a consequent reluctance to steal from her? Were she
      consulted about
      <BR>&gt; the project, I am quite sure her feelings would be anything but
      positive.

      <BR> &gt;...Then again, maybe I just have a more forgiving ear
      <BR> &gt;after the FANTASTIC songs from the Demo sessions....
      <BR> &gt; Thank you SO much for bringing this music to light IED! &lt;
      <BR> &gt;-- Pete Hartman ......noao &lt;!bradley!bucc2!pwh&gt;</P>
    
    <P> The two attitudes reprinted above--as different from each other as two
      attitudes could be--demonstrate the complexity of the ethical dilemma
      which these demos create. IED does not in the least deny the power of Tim
      Maroney's argument. On the contrary, IED feels its righteousness only too
      strongly, even as he continues on the tenebrous moral path to which he
      committed himself two weeks ago. He hopes that Mr. Maroney, and any others
      on this group who may share Mr. Maroney's indignation, will take the time
      to consider the delicacy of this problem before condemning either IED
      himself or the many Love-Hounds who have decided to join him (albeit as
      recipients rather than as co-distributors) in the current project.</P>
    
    <P> IED obtained a cassette containing a collection of previously unknown
      and certainly unreleased early songs written and recorded by Kate Bush. He
      was given a chance to listen to a bit of this music before buying, and
      though aware of the transgression which his act constituted, he could not
      resist buying the music from the unscrupulous merchant who had offered it.</P>
    
    <P> Now, owning these recordings, IED's feeling of guilt at having obtained
      them in the first place--bad enough by itself--was compounded by a new
      feeling of guilt at enjoying the music _in_exclusivity_. Granted that it
      was not &quot;right&quot; for him to own and listen to the songs at all,
      was it not less right still for him to listen to them, to enjoy them, to
      be enraptured by them--and not to _share_ them with other fans as
      appreciative of and devoted to Kate's work as himself?</P>
    
    <P> A difficult question to answer. For although in depriving other fans of
      these recordings he might possibly (and this is only a possibility, by
      _no_ means a certainty) be seen by Kate to be worsening, rather than in
      some measure expiating, his original crime, he would also be acting in a
      mean and petty way by refusing to allow other fans to hear his tape.
      Furthermore, by failing to make the music available to other sincerely
      interested lovers of Kate's work, he would also be condoning--even
      conspiring in--the activities of the merchant from whom he had obtained
      his original copy (at an outrageously inflated price, need it be said).
      For what else but conspiracy could be called the decision to keep to
      himself his copy of the music, knowing full well that by doing so he would
      be helping profiteers to swell their purses from the illegal sale of the
      same recordings? Having done the first foul deed (buying the merchant's
      copy of the tape), would it not have been fouler still _not_ to have found
      a way of sharing the music in the least expensive way, making certain to
      exclude all profit motives from the operation?</P>
    
    <P> IED doesn't know how many readers of this group share Mr. Maroney's
      sentiments--that IED should be prosecuted for this crime-- but perhaps
      there are a substantial number of you. To you IED sincerely apologizes.
      Naturally, he also asks your indulgence, and will take it as a personal
      kindness (perhaps one which he does not deserve) if you will not report
      him to the authorities.</P>
    
    <P> He would like to add that although Mr. Maroney may be quite certain
      that Kate herself would certainly condemn IED's activities, IED is not,
      himself, so convinced. True, Kate is very upset that these recordings have
      become available to the public at large--that much is known for a fact.
      But Kate is also realistic enough to know that now that these recordings
      are available commercially (though illegally), there will be no stopping
      the zealous fan from obtaining them. Consequently there is no reason to
      assume that she will view IED's entirely altruistic distribution &quot;scheme&quot;
      with a particularly hostile eye. It is even possible that she will forgive
      IED for his actions, understanding the complex of emotions which has
      motivated him.</P>
    
    <P>One other comment regarding Mr. Maroney's remarks. The hypothetical
      types whom Mr. Maroney describes--those whose &quot;respect&quot; for Kate
      is so great that it prevents them from listening to seventeen works of
      almost certain genius--are no doubt to be admired for their astounding
      moral rectitude and their boundless respect for the rights of the artist.
      Yet they are also, IED thinks, a little to be pitied. For it is impossible
      for this fan, having been put so completely in the thrall of Kate's art,
      to believe that the hypothetical types whom Mr. Maroney describes can ever
      truly have fallen under the final, most elusive and ultimately inescapable
      and irresistible spell of her magic. No. In IED's opinion, anyone who has
      ever fully, finally lived amid the limitless heights, depths and expanses
      of Kate's artistic realm, could not _possibly_ resist the opportunity to
      look upon seventeen more of that realm's miraculous vistas. Those who
      could resist such a temptation would deserve our admiration for their
      virtue--but they would also provoke our pity for the ignorance to which
      their self-abnegation would subject them.</P>
    
    <P>In any event, IED sent a letter to Kate ten days ago confessing his
      crimes, and explaining in detail every facet of the whole sordid story.
      The matter of IED's exoneration, pardon or condemnation, therefore, is in
      Kate's hands. Please let it remain there, and IED will not complain. </P>

      <BR> Date: 17 Jun 89 20:50:54 GMT
      <BR> Subject: Tape in Hand </P>
    
    <P>Now, about the tape. It's as good (or better) than IED described. Some
      of the songs are truly wonderful. Some are even better than that! And for
      those concerned about sound quality -- even though my tape is a copy of a
      copy of who-knows-what generation the sound is completely acceptable.
      Better than just acceptable. As good as some other Kate boots (vinyl,
      tapes) I've heard. </P>
    
    <P>If you're a Love-Hound, YOU WANT THIS TAPE! </P>
    
    <P>Finally, a question for IED about the tape. At the end of Hammer Horror,
      in the runout of the last word and piano note, I very distinctly hear a
      couple of seconds of birds chirping in the background, as if outside a
      window during the recording. After I mentioned this to the guy who found
      the tape, he heard it, too. You may need to listen on headphones or at max
      volume in a quiet room, but there's something there. This has nothing to
      do with the music, of course, but if true it does say say something
      (charming) about the recording session. </P>
    
    <P>One thing that this tape does is make me wish Kate would record such an
      album today. That is, just her voice, her songs, and a piano. Not in
      *place* of her annual [:-)] album release, but in addition. Something for
      herself and her devotees. </P>

      <BR> Subject: K opyright infringemen T </P>
    
    <P>I've been quiet of late, but I had to jump into this whole issue of
      bootlegged recordings. </P>
    
    <P>I have been known to make musical recordings of various degrees of
      interest. If and when I ever become a major recording artist or just
      generic superstar, and people decide that my work is so interesting that
      they have to hear all of it, even the stuff I decided was crap and threw
      in the trash can, then more power to them. The bottom line is exposure. I
      am raving egomaniac and I want the whole world to hear what I've been
      doing with my time. That's my personal view. Kate's view is a bit
      different, and I suppose we must respect her wishes, but then again, why
      are copyright laws good and necessary things? Anarchy now! I don't mind if
      people make tapes of my albums and give them to friends. I want them to
      hear the music. Hopefully they'll like it enough to buy the album, but if
      they don't then at least they heard it. Of course, this doesn't apply to
      bootlegs, so we have to take a different approach. </P>
    
    <P>It's a very tangled issue, sadly. I've been reading &quot;The Beatles
      Recording Sessions&quot; and it's a great comprehensive indepth treatment
      of every piece of tape they ever made at Abbey Road, but it pales into
      total insignificance when you actually plunk your illegally obtained copy
      of the first take of &quot;Norweigian Wood&quot; into the player and hear
      it. </P>
    
    <P>IED: I support you wholeheartedly. Bootlegging is bad because these
      people are making money at the expense of the artist. Your motives are
      pure, and if the world is too stupid to recognize it, then you can at
      least suffer the penalties with a heart free of burden, yes? I would be
      terribly interested in seeing a copy of the letter you sent Kate. If it is
      stored on computer, could you mail a copy to me, or love-hounds at large
      if you think there's interest. Thanks. </P>
    
    <P>When are we starting the &quot;help defray IED's legal expense&quot;
      fund? We could probably start with what's left of the &quot;fly IED to the
      East Coast for Katemas&quot; fund from two years ago. (What was it, Joe?
      $.37, a coat button, and some lint?) </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: MisK., MisK., and more MisK. (very longwinded screed re
      ethics, etc.) </P>
    
    <P>Jeez. What a mess. </P>
    
    <P>There certainly seems to be a variety of opinions in this group. </P>
    
    <P>... </P>
    
    <P> The truth is not really known here, Mark. IED was assured by a friend
      who spoke with John Carder Bush on the phone that they had heard about the
      release of the first Cathy Demos (Volume One) EP, and that Kate was &quot;very
      upset&quot; about it. That's the source of IED's information, and the
      extent of it. It's fourth-hand, but IED has no reason for doubting its
      accuracy. </P>
    
    <P>Since that time (here are some particulars re IED's letter) IED has
      written to Kate (through her brother) in two separate letters, letting
      them know about the 22-song tape, the plans to make copies for zero profit
      for those readers of Love-Hounds who expressed interest, and as much hard
      information as IED has been able to dig up about the real bootleggers
      behind the tape. In the case of the EP IED's info is unfortunately still
      very vague, but in the case of the cassette IED was able to be of
      considerable help with specific names and addresses. </P>
    
    <P>So you see, it's not quite as simple as one might suppose. IED's project
      was described, and they can probably see that this is a limited project
      without any profit involved--essentially the distribution of a &quot;few&quot;
      copies for &quot;friends&quot;, not a business venture. In addition, IED
      has given them what leads he could about the identity of the real
      bootleggers. The upshot of all this is that there is no predicting what
      the Bush family's reaction will be. Tim Maroney's dire predictions may
      prove accurate, but there is by no means any guarantee of that. </P>
    
    <P>IED also confessed some of his sins regarding the Cathy Demos EP in a
      letter to the Welsh fanzine Cariad Kate, which they have now published in
      its entirety in their latest issue. So not only does Kate know from me,
      she and the world can read about it in print, too. (The tape project is
      not mentioned in that article, however.) </P>
    
    <P>He should point out, too, that IED is rather a latecomer when it comes
      to advertising these demos. Besides Bart Firsden's ad in Goldmine (still
      there in the latest issue), from which one can get a list of items
      including the 22-demo tape (at a disgusting mark-up), there have been a
      long song-by-song listing and description in the Dutch fanzine Kate, and
      another notice in Cariad Kate (both unrelated to IED's) which also lists
      all the titles. Besides which the Cathy Demos EP series is definitely
      continuing, according to one source. There are four more seven-inch EPs
      scheduled, each with four tracks from the 22-song collection. All of these
      sources of bootleg commerce are known to Kate and her family (a friend of
      IED's bought at considerable expense and sent to Kate a copy of The Cathy
      Demos Volume One EP about a month ago, so she has definitely seen it by
      now). So if legal action is to be taken, there are certainly other targets
      out there. </P>
    
    <P>Yet this is not at all to say that Kate hasn't every right to prosecute
      IED for copying the recordings, should she ever decide to do so, even
      though no profit were sought. The only question that seems to remain a
      legitimate source for debate concerns the ethical/moral ramifications. And
      those are plenty serious enough on their own without introducing the legal
      issues. </P>
    
    <P>IED can share your dismay at having to consider this unpleasant issue,
      but as a fellow true disciple he can see no alternative. We all must think
      about Kate's feelings in this matter, and they are weighing very heavily
      upon IED these days. And well they should. She made this music. It's hers.
      Just because we find it incredibly beautiful and moving music doesn't make
      it OK that we've all heard it. In an ideal world Kate should have total
      control over which bits of her limitless fund of sublime imagination
      should be doled out to us. That power shouldn't be transferred to her
      fans. IED can see that fact; there is no sound moral argument to make
      against it. (Jon Drukman's &quot;Anarchy now!&quot; opinions IED finds
      totally unacceptable.) IED can only point out again that </P>
    
    <P>1.) he is an addiKT, powerless to resist the magnet of Kate's demo
      material when it is placed within his grasp; </P>
    
    <P>2.) he would feel equally rotten if he had to refuse the requests of
      other fans who only want the chance to hear what IED has heard; and </P>
    
    <P>3.) he would feel rottener still if, by refusing to share his copy with
      other fans, he forced them to seek copies through sleaze-ball bootleggers.
      Those three motivations for IED's actions are not held up as a defense of
      his proposed project, only as an explanation, and possible mitigating
      factors. All this has served to freeze the project in its tracks for the
      time being. Once again: no action has been taken yet. </P>

    <P>|&gt;oug is very pissed at IED! If IED really thinks that he can go to
      Kate Bush and say &quot;Mind if I distribute these illegal bootleg
      recording of yours that you don't want anyone to hear and were very
      disturbed to find out that they had leaked?&quot; he lives in a very
      different world (and nonexistant one -- sorry, Virginia, there is no Santa
      Claus) than I do. Kate will obviously be *forced* by copyright law to tell
      IED to cease and desist, while if IED had kept his big writing-hand shut,
      Kate could have known all about it and quietly looked away as she usually
      does, and in a court of law plausibly feign ignorance if anyone ever
      challenged her on her copyright. But now that IED and admitted all in
      hard, cold black and white, she no longer has this option. </P>
    
    <P>It's a good thing for IED that (as far as |&gt;oug knows) no one has
      ever been convicted of violating copyright if there was no intent to
      profit. Unfortunately for |&gt;oug, people have had their computers seized
      for conspiracy to violate copyright (even when no charges were ever
      brought). In any case, even if IED doesn't get thrown in jail, the
      consequences will be much worse for IED because |&gt;oug is going to go to
      LA and strangle a Cathy Demo tape out of him if he doesn't receive one in
      the mail soon. (|&gt;oug is sure that IED will forgive |&gt;oug, for he is
      a fellow addiKT and can't help himself, but IED will be dead nonetheless.)
      |&gt;oug will have to make sure all the FBI agents have left before doing
      this, however. </P>
    
    <P>If IED was sufferring all along from this torturous moral quandry, |&gt;oug
      fails to see why IED did not just let |&gt;oug do all the dirty work, as
      he already volunteered to in the past. Since |&gt;oug has no compunction
      on this issue, there would have been no problem. But nooooooooo..... IED
      has to go and screw it up again! </P>
    
    <P>|&gt;oug's only hope at the moment is that he can get Love-Hounds set up
      with with non-profit, educational status. Then we can copy copyrighted
      material all we want -- especially if it is not commercially available.
      Yeah, that's the ticket.... </P>

    <P>Second, the not-so-good: In the same issue, Peter apparently
      specifically warns against anyone making copies of the so-called Cathy
      Demos -- even if they are only being made for friends. Peter stresses that
      to do so is very illegal. Presumably this notice was published at the
      request of the Bush family. And it sounds to IED as though they have
      Love-Hounds in mind. </P>
    
    <P>What this means is that IED is now more doubtful than ever about
      carrying out our plan. He must warn everyone that he is now leaning
      against the idea of making copies for anyone. This is not a firm decision,
      but he does hope that you will understand the delay--IED wants to wait at
      least until he has received his subscription copy of Homeground from
      Peter, just in case it is accompanied by a letter (which would be a reply
      to IED's own letter to him, in which IED discussed his acquisition of the
      demos). Please, people, bear with IED for just a little while longer--he
      doesn't like keeping anyone waiting, especially under these circumstances,
      and knowing how much some of you are counting on your little packages. He
      promises to make a final and irrevocable decision within one week (i.e. by
      July 23). </P>
    
    <P>He should add that if he decides not to go through with the tape deal,
      but to return everyone's orders, he will not hold it against anyone if
      they should decide to curse IED, disparage his parents, and generally heap
      vitriol on his name. If such should happen, he would accept the rebukes in
      silent humility. There is no real doubt that he has made a total ass of
      himself in this non-starter of a project, despite the fact that he never
      intended to do anything but good for everyone in this group. Again, he
      offers his apologies. </P>
    
    <P>In the meantime, please don't go spreading the word about this whole
      tape fiasco outside Love-Hounds. The last thing IED wants now is for the
      wrong people to hear about it, or to start getting orders from people
      oustide the Love-Hounds community. </P>

    <P>Neil sent along the actual announcement printed in the latest issue of
      Homeground, which pretty much acts as a Bush family mouth-piece when
      called upon to do so. </P>
    
    <P>HOMEGROUND feels that it should be said, in view of possible legal
      actions pending, that these tapes are highly illegal, and that copying and
      distribution, even amongst friends and not for gain is still illegal. Kate
      herself is highly upset about these releases. </P>
    
    <P>IED agrees with Neil that this notice is meant more to try to discourage
      people from making the tapes, and not as a promise that actual legal
      action will be taken. Such action would probably be counter-productive
      from EMI's and Kate's point of view, though of course one never knows for
      sure. However, IED is taking the notice very seriously, and at this point
      he must say the tape deal looks doubtful. Final decision still pending,

    <P>No. He refers to other thankyou notes, many of which refer to some other

    <P>Vickie passes on another bit of interesting information. Seems there's a
      record dealer in Kansas City (connected with the Penny Lane chain of
      record stores) who insists that &quot;a collection of Kate's early demos&quot;
      will be coming out on bootleg CD very soon. This project, it should be
      stressed here, is in no way connected with any proposed Love-Hounds plans
      regarding the tape, but seems to have sprung up entirely independently.
      Anyway, IED'll believe a CD when he sees one. </P>
    
    <P>However, far more solid (though again, completely unrelated to
      Love-Hounds' recent hypothetical notions) is news from a local Hollywood
      importer that Volume 2 of The Cathy Demos --Volume One was a red-vinyl
      seven-inch EP which contained four tracks from the 22 demos--will finally
      be out, &quot;any day now.&quot; This was based on new and reliable
      information, he told IED. Meanwhile, he added that Volume One was
      completely finished with. That record is now officially out of production.

      <BR> Subject: Cathy Demos Vol. 2 </P>
    
    <P> First, here is the big bootleg news: after more than three months
      Volume Two of The Cathy Demos has finally appeared in import shops in the
      Hollywood area; naturally, IED has obtained a copy. </P>
    
    <P>The new record is packaged and designed in the same style as the first
      volume: it consists of a seven-inch EP, packed in a plain white
      inner-sleeve, which in turn is contained in a white outer-sleeve of
      lightweight cardpaper. On the front of the outer sleeve is a
      black-and-white reproduction of one of the photographs taken by John
      Carder Bush of Kate when she was about eight or nine years old. It is a
      candid shot showing her sitting cross-legged with hands resting on the top
      of a cane in front of her chin, and with a four-pack of fresh milk-bottles
      in her lap. Below the photo on the otherwise blank white cover are the
      words (set, as in the first volume, in a type-style similar to that on
      Hounds of Love ): </P>
    
    <P>&quot;KATE BUSH Cathy Demos Volume Two&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>On the back of the sleeve is a close-up of Kate's hands from the same
      photograph, over which are listed the track-listing: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Side One: </P>
    
    <P>Kashka From Bhagdad &lt;sic&gt; </P>
    
    <P>Camila &lt;sic&gt;, </P>
    
    <P>Oh To Be In Love </P>
    
    <P>Side Two: </P>
    
    <P>In My Lover's Room &lt;sic&gt;, </P>
    
    <P>Snow Bowl &lt;sic&gt; </P>
    
    <P>Below the photo on the back the series number (IED's copy is No. 280 of
      600, for whatever the bootleggers' word is worth on such a subject) and
      the catalogue number: KB002. </P>
    
    <P>The record itself is pressed this time in translucent green vinyl (the
      first EP was pressed in red vinyl), and the labels (this time like the
      first EP's) are black with white pseudo-HoL writing. The catalogue number
      is the same on the record as on the outer sleeve (that was not the case
      for the first EP). The timing of each of the five tracks is given on the
      labels. On the runout groove of side A are the words: &quot;I HAVE BELLIE
      BAD LUCK&quot;, and on side B the words: &quot;YOU WISHED IT ON YOURSELF&quot;.
      IED will not hazard a guess as to the meaning, if any, of these phrases.
    </P>
    
    <P>The most interesting thing about these transfers of the demos, in IED's
      opinion, is that, as with the first EP, the sound appears to have been &quot;cleaned
      up&quot; a bit before pressing. IED doesn't know how this was done (or
      even whether it was deliberate), but not only is the hiss of the original
      tape considerably reduced in the EP version, but the by-now very familiar
      (and much beloved) clicks and page-turning noises which punctuate each
      song on the master tape have been omitted for the transfer to vinyl. </P>
    
    <P>Some may be wondering what songs are those which the bootleggers have so
      strangely identified (see IED's &quot;&lt;sic&gt;s&quot; above). The two
      familiar titles are Kashka From Baghdad (misspelled &quot;Bhagdad&quot; by
      the bootleggers) and Oh To Be In Love. This leaves only one song-- Violin
      --among the five LP-song demos contained in the full collection of 22,
      which has not yet been released on vinyl by bootleggers. The track Camilla
      (misspelled Camila on the EP) has also been identified (by Theo Haast in
      the Dutch Kate Bush fanzine Kate ) as Surrender Into the Roses. In My
      Lover's Room is the song which IED identified as Playing Canasta in Cold
      Rooms (a much better title for identifi-cation purposes because the word &quot;room&quot;
      in the phrase from which the bootleggers derive their title is highly
      suspect. KT could simply be singing &quot;Ooh...&quot;) Finally, Snow Bowl
      is plainly a mistaken reading of the lyrics sung by Kate in the song IED
      has identified as Hot in the Ice or Set in the Snow. Kate is actually
      saying &quot;snowball&quot;, not &quot;snow bowl&quot;. </P>

    <P>Let's talk about ... Kate. After listening to both obsKuriTies I &amp;
      II (thanks Tracy!), I'd like to make a few observations. First off, it's
      just so amazing that she had done so much at such a young age. Being a
      frustrated musician in my youth only increases my awe for what she
      accomplished. One would expect most of her work to be like &quot;Camilla&quot;
      which has a neat little melody and interesting lyrics but lacks something
      overall (IMHO). Being the work of a child, one can definitely recognize
      talent in the song and would expect improvement through continued work.
      Other songs though lack nothing. I love &quot;Maybe (aka Davy)&quot; and &quot;Passing
      through Air&quot;. I can't help but wonder if the version of &quot;Maybe&quot;
      recorded later for &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; will ever released? We can
      only hope. Finally, &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot; is currently
      my favorite song which means I play it time and again. I just hope the
      tape doesn't wear out before Christmas. </P>
    
    <P>Now for another problem, I'm becoming dangerously musically
      uni-dimensional. With Katemas and these two new KT tapes, I find myself
      listening to Kate Bush to the exclusion of other artists. With another
      album due for release soon, the problem can only get worse. I've been
      writing a lot lately, and while writing I'll listen to obsKuriTies I and
      then obsKuriTies II. Then I'll put on TKI to listen for similarities, and
      then HoL just because I like it. Well we've gone this far, maybe we can
      put on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; to liven things up. Then we dig out &quot;Lionheart&quot;
      and then &quot;Never Forever&quot;, and then maybe more obsKuriTies to
      reflect on the beginnings of such a precocious and perceptive talent.
      Corey believes that this can be easily controlled by listening to other
      music, if Corey can only remember what that is. Corey believes there is no
      danger of turning into ... AAAARRGGHH! It's already happening, Corey is
      writing in the third person! </P>

      mind, but IED finds this very difficult to believe. Kate's very first
      experience with David Gilmour was a (probably unrecorded) solo
      performance--an audition--which she did, probably at her home, in 1972 or
      '73, when she was all of fourteen years old. Then, during the summer of
      '73 (when she was either fourteen or fifteen) the team of Bush and Gilmour
      met at his house with a couple of musician friends of David's, and there
      they recorded at least ten, and perhaps more, songs of Kate's. One of
      those recordings was Passing Through Air, in the version we all know.
      Another was a song called Maybe, of which Kate once played a brief excerpt
      during a radio programme. (Peter FitzGerald-Morris has now made it very
      clear that this song, Maybe, was indeed once known as Davey, even though
      it is quite unrelated to the other song we usually refer to as While Davey
      Dozed .) </P>
    
    <P>Still later (sometime in 1975, by which time Kate was sixteen or
      seventeen), Gilmour paid for an elaborate studio session with Kate
      (complete with a full orchestra), during which three songs were produced
      by Gilmour: The Saxophone Song, The Man With the Child in His Eyes, and a
      second version of Maybe. The third song was not Passing Through Air, in
      other words. It's interesting that when Kate played the excerpt of Maybe
      on UK radio, she chose to play the earlier, presumably far less polished,
      recording, rather than the 1975 version. But at the time she was very
      explicit about the difference between the first and the second Gilmour
      sessions. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, it's possible that the various tiny bits of third-hand
      information on which IED bases the preceding story are inaccurate, despite
      their more or less reliable sources. In which case the whole house of
      cards would collapse. </P>

    <P>Speaking of Breakthrough... </P>
    
    <P>Doug, I promise I won't make a habit of posting stuff from Breakthrough
      but I was looking through one of the old issues and came across this
      letter that made me gasp in astonishment. </P>
    
    <P>This is from the April/May **1984** issue of Breakthrough </P>
    
    <P>From: Cortina Bandolero </P>
    
    <P>Dear Dale and cohorts at Breakthrough, </P>
    
    <P>Here in Phoenix there is quite a sizable awareness of Kate. This would
      be an ideal city for EMI to sponser a &quot;Bush Bash&quot;. There are
      import stores here where the import LPs, the Hammersmith-Odeon video and
      the 45 Box Set can be readily found. Also there's a small but loyally
      followed radio station, KSTM, which isn't averse to playing Kate's songs.
      In *1982* when local DJ (name deleted) was at KSTM, he aired an hour of
      Kate's rarities which included some of her very early solo-piano work. He
      had worked for EMI at the time of Kate's initial signing, and aquired the
      tapes then. There were some real surprises for collectors, including an
      altered version of Hammer Horror and another song with a refrain about &quot;playing
      canasta in cold rooms.&quot; Does anyone know anything about this rare
      song? ...Now I'm off to write the KB club! </P>
    
    <P>She was talking about the CATHY DEMOS!!! They were in the US in 1982!!!
      Isn't it horrible that poor Cortina unknowingly was responsible for
      getting this DJ into trouble? (btw, I deleted the name, no need to add to
      the fire) Amazing that it took till 1988 for them to get distributed.
      Anyway, I thought that was interesting. </P>
    
    <P>[I think I don't tell you a secret, that the DJ was John Dixon. --WIE]

    <P>How many such &quot;hidden&quot; subjects, highly specific but never

    <P>Speaking of which, IED now agrees with whoever it was who suggested that
      Kate's song with the lines &quot;Surrender into the roses/ Go back home
      under the posies&quot; was properly entitled not Camilla but Carmilla, in
      reference to Sheridan LeFanu's vampire novella. The lyrics strongly
      suggest imagery from the book. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: The Cathy Demos EP's </P>
    
    <P>There have been at least three volumes of seven-inch records in the
      ongoing series of bootleg Cathy Demos series. The first contains four
      tracks, the second five, and the third has six tracks. That leaves seven
      more tracks still to be put out by this group of bootleggers--the original
      tape which is the source of the &quot;Cathy&quot; material contained a
      total of twenty-two songs, seventeen of which had never been heard in any
      form before. </P>
    
    <P>These EPs were originally released in color-vinyl editions of 600 copies
      each, and they went for between $12 and $25 each. The first volume was in
      red vinyl, the second was in green, and the third was in yellow. The
      covers were uniform in layout (black ink on plain white sleeves), but each
      had a detail from a different John Carder Bush black-and-white
      photo-portrait of Kate as a little girl, badly reproduced (without
      permission) from his book, Cathy. </P>
    
    <P>Now, IED has been told (thanks, Mike Butler), at least the first volume
      of these Cathy Demos EPs has been re-pressed in a new edition on plain
      black vinyl, in larger quantities than the original pressing. IED has not
      seen any of these yet, but their reported existence indicates that the
      original color-vinyl editions will indeed maintain their current inflated
      prices (which now range from anywhere between $15 and $60 per unit). </P>
    
    <P>However, do not despair. Not only are at least 140 current and/or former
      Love-Hounds known to have all these demos in at least some form or other
      (say no more!); but the entire collection of twenty-two demos has now been
      re-released by another bootlegging outfit (this one definitely U.S.-based)
      on a pair of albums; and these have been showing up at record swapmeets
      recently. The sound quality of these is arguably a bit worse than that of
      the EPs, but it is still quite acceptable, and the price of the LPs is
      considerably lower than that of the EPs--which, unlike the LPs, have still
      not formed a complete series, as far as IED is aware. Also, the second LP,
      which Ed Suranyi recently posted a description of, is reported to contain
      more than just the rest of the 22 original &quot;Cathy&quot; demos, making
      the albums an even better value. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, all of these recordings are illegal and unauthorized, and
      their purchase is strongly discouraged... </P>

    <P>Date: Fri, 06 Apr 90 16:41 PDT
      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: re Cathy Demos </P>
    
    <P>IED identified a number of Kate's unreleased early songs by different
      (more likely) titles than do the bootleggers. The confusion arises because
      these unreleased early songs, which fans know only through the various
      bootleg sources of &quot;Cathy&quot; demos, have no official titles. Since
      Kate has never even acknowledged the existence of these specific songs,
      all any of us can do is guess at their real titles. IED (as well as a
      number of other superior Love-Hounds Kate Bushological scholars, of
      course!) can, however, make better guesses than the slime who slap
      together the bootleg product. </P>
    
    <P>N.B.: All twenty-two songs are home demos--just Kate and her piano. It
      is just conceiveable that they date from as early as 1973, but IED thinks
      a more likely date for them is 1976. No fan really knows. </P>
    
    <P>Your list, annotated below, consists of the sixteen titles found on the
      bootleg LP called Cathy's Album. (This LP also turns up by the name of The
      Sensual Woman, but it is the same collection of sixteen tracks, so don't
      be duped into buying both.) </P>
    
    <P>These tracks are sixteen of the total twenty-two early recordings which
      turned up in bootleggers' hands at swapmeets last year (albeit only in
      cassette form) with either The Cathy Demos or Fiddle (after Violin ) as
      their collective title. </P>
    
    <P>The title &quot; The Cathy Demos &quot; stems from a simultaneous
      release of four of the twenty-two songs which came out as a seven-inch
      bootleg EP. (The reference to &quot;Cathy&quot; in turn stems from a
      collection of photos of her as a child--when she still went by the name
      Cathy--by her brother John Carder Bush. Photos from that collection were
      used on the EP and its two successors in the &quot;Cathy Demos&quot;
      series of EPs.) </P>
    
    <P>Now, because the bootlegger who made the Cathy's Album LP was aware of
      the proliferation of the first Cathy's Demos EP, he decided to omit those
      first four titles from the collection on his LP. Those first four songs
      (which make up Volume One of The Cathy Demos EPs) are: </P>
    
    <P>The Infant Kiss </P>
    
    <P>Hammer Horror </P>
    
    <P>Feeling Like a Waltz </P>
    
    <P>Keeping Me Waiting </P>
    
    <P> The first two are early, slightly different versions of the songs we
      know from Kate's first two official LP releases. The second two are
      completely unfamiliar early songs. Already, however, confusion arises,
      because the EP misidentifies the song Feeling Like a Waltz as &quot;A Rose
      Growing Old&quot;. Typical of bootleggers in general, they mis-heard the
      word &quot;Waltz&quot; in the song as &quot;Rose&quot;. The entire phrase
      goes: &quot;And I'm feeling like a waltz, growing old.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The LP that Mark Kirk described, then, begins with the fifth of the
      twenty-two demos, and concludes with the twentieth. The first four (listed
      above) and the last two do not appear on the Cathy's Album LP. </P>
    
    <P>Since then Volumes Two and Three in the Cathy's Demos EP series have
      turned up. Volume Two contains the first five songs on Cathy's Album,
      which Mark listed as follows: </P>
    
    <P>Kashka From Baghdad </P>
    
    <P>* Coming Up </P>
    
    <P>Oh, To Be In Love </P>
    
    <P>Playing Canasta (=Playing Canasta In Cold Rooms) </P>
    
    <P>Snow (=Set In The Snow) </P>
    
    <P>Kashka From Baghdad is a very early version of this song. Some of the
      lyrics are different from the LP version we all know. </P>
    
    <P>The song which is listed as Coming Up on the Cathy's Album LP has
      nothing to do with Paul McCartney! This title is definitely wrong. The
      correct title (thanks to Vickie) is Carmilla, after the title character
      from Sheridan Le Fanu's vampire novella. The idiotic and sloppy
      bootleggers simply mis-heard &quot;Carmilla&quot; as &quot;Coming Up&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>The version of Oh To Be in Love which follows is a hauntingly slow and
      moody early incarnation of the TKI album track. </P>
    
    <P>Playing Canasta ( in Cold Rooms ) is another early song--and arguably
      one of the most perfect jewels in the history of twentieth-century music.
    </P>
    
    <P>The song referred to on the Cathy's Album LP as &quot; Snow &quot; is
      the same song which IED listed as Set in the Snow. (Though IED is not
      entirely sure that those are the words Kate is singing.) Further confusion
      could arise from the fact that the EP (Volume Two) lists this song as &quot;
      Snow Bowl &quot; (a definitely wrong title which resulted from the EP's
      bootlegger hearing &quot;Snowball&quot; as the quite meaningless &quot;Snow
      Bowl&quot;!). </P>
    
    <P>The next six tracks on Cathy's Album correspond with the six tracks on
      The Cathy Demos Volume Three. They are, as Mark copied them from the back
      of the LP: </P>
    
    <P>Ferry Me Over </P>
    
    <P>Lionhearts </P>
    
    <P>Violin </P>
    
    <P>Craft Of Love </P>
    
    <P>* Queen Eddie </P>
    
    <P>* In My Garden </P>
    
    <P> Ferry Me Over (at least that's what everyone hears ) is another great
      early song. The full phrase is &quot;Ferry me over the music, Dali.&quot;
      Anyway, a few fans do hear &quot;Dali&quot;--most notably Theo Haast and
      Rob Assenberg, the editors of the Dutch fanzine Kate. (They offer still a
      third set of alternate titles for the twenty-two demos.) IED used to hear
      &quot;Dali&quot; as &quot;darling&quot;, but Theo's and Rob's suggestion
      makes better sense. The song's lyrics are at least marginally less
      mysterious if the song is read as a tribute to Dali. And we know that
      Kate's favorite painter (at least in earlier days) was Salvador Dali.</P>
    
    <P>Warning: Lionhearts is not the same song as Oh England My Lionheart !
      They have no connection at all. The song which is called Lionhearts on the
      Cathy's Album LP should more properly be called Where Are the Lionhearts?.
      (It's an absolute masterpiece, by the way.) </P>
    
    <P>Violin is another early version of an LP track. The lyrics are slightly
      different than on Never For Ever, and the song has a very different tone
      than in the big-rock-orchestration on the official LP track. </P>
    
    <P>Craft of Love is probably the correct title, not IED's earlier &quot;
      Craft of Life &quot;, though IED thinks Kate may be alternating between
      those two phrases in the choruses. </P>
    
    <P>In My Garden is a good alternate title--though probably a wrong one--for
      Something Like a Song. This is one of Kate's very earliest compositions,
      dating at least as far back as 1973. We know this because the same song
      turns up on the still-unlocated Early Years LP (as Something Like a Song )
      in a version Kate did with David Gilmour at age 15, in 1973 (same time
      Passing Through Air was recorded in the version we know from the Army
      Dreamers b-side). </P>
    
    <P>Queen Eddie is another adequate, though almost certainly wrong, title.
      The real title (assuming the Early Years version is correctly identified,
      which is likely) is Gay Farewell. Both this song and Something Like a
      Song, therefore, were written by 1973 or earlier, but the solo-piano demo
      versions on the Cathy's Album and The Cathy Demos probably date from two
      or three years later. </P>
    
    <P>The remaining five songs on Cathy's Album have not yet come out in EP
      form, though presumably they will shortly appear as all or part of Volume
      Four of The Cathy Demos. On Cathy's Album they are identified as: </P>
    
    <P>Frightened Eyes </P>
    
    <P>Never the Less (=Nevertheless, You'll Do) </P>
    
    <P>* Goodnight Baby </P>
    
    <P>* So Soft </P>
    
    <P>* I Don't See Why I Shouldn't </P>
    
    <P> Frightened Eyes is the same title IED and the Dutch fans give to this
      extremely beautiful, poignant song about the loneliness of life in
      civilized society. </P>
    
    <P>Never the Less (more properly Nevertheless, You'll Do ) is a departure
      for the early Kate: an attempt to write a consciously upbeat, British
      pop-rock song somewhat along the lines of McCartney's Penny Lane. </P>
    
    <P>Goodnight Baby is the same song as Who Is Sylvia?. Amazing song. </P>
    
    <P>So Soft is the same as Soft and You're Soft. A very sophisticated and
      spooky melody with imagery that anticipates In the Warm Room. </P>
    
    <P>Finally, I Don't See Why I Shouldn't is the same as the extremely cool
      rocker Pick the Rare Flower. (The complete phrase from the song is &quot;I
      don't see why I shouldn't pick the rare flower.&quot;) </P>
    
    <P>The last two songs in the collection of twenty-two solo-piano &quot;Cathy&quot;
      demos are missing from Cathy's Album, nor have they turned up as a volume
      of The Cathy Demos EPs, yet. They are so far known only through cassettes,
      usually with the titles Disbelieving Angel and While Davey Dozed (or just
      plain Davey ). The former appears on the still unlocated Early Years LP in
      an earlier (band) version, along with Something Like a Song and Gay
      Farewell (see above). </P>
    
    <P>While Davey Dozed, which is sometimes called just plain Davey, is an
      amazing early song which should not be confused with another early song
      called Maybe. (The reason this is stressed is because Maybe was originally
      called Davey, too, according to Peter.) Maybe is another song which Kate
      recorded at age 14 or 15 with Dave Gilmour at Gilmour's house (during the
      same '73 sessions which produced the Army Dreamers b-side called Passing
      Through Air ). </P>
    
    <P>Fortunately, we do know the song Maybe, through an excerpt of that early
      Gilmour-band demo which Kate played very briefly on the old BBC radio
      programme &quot;Personal Call&quot; back in 1979. This song has never been
      put out as a bootleg product, however, and is available only through trade
      with collectors, as far as IED is aware. The excerpt lasts all of fifty
      seconds, too. </P>
    
    <P>That takes care of the very early demos. In addition to these, there are
      several other &quot;demos&quot;, though they date from a slighly later
      period. In 1976 or 1977, during the early sessions for The Kick Inside
      (IED theorizes), Kate recorded six other tracks. Five of these are simply
      alternate early takes with the studio band of songs which later did appear
      on The Kick Inside and Lionheart. But the sixth is an unreleased
      song--very light and poppy, though its subject is at odds with the
      tone--called Scares Me Silly (as far as one can tell). </P>
    
    <P>Now, IED has not yet seen it, but he has been told that a second bootleg
      LP has emerged since the appearance of Cathy's Album, which contains the
      six demos that were omitted from that first LP; as well as at least some
      of those six band takes--including Scares Me Silly. If you're interested,
      check out your nearest record swapmeet and ask about it. It should be
      turning up soon. Ed Suranyi reported an ad in Goldmine which seemed to be
      a description of this album. </P>
    
    <P>Aside from the twenty-two Cathy demos, the Maybe demo, the six Scares Me
      Silly demos, and Passing Through Air (along with the other Early Years
      tracks), there are only two others of which IED is aware: two early demo
      versions of Babooshka. These two may conceiveably also appear on the
      bootleggers' sequel to Cathy's Album. </P>
