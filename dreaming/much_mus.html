Subject: New Music interview (Toronto)
</P>
<P>Last weekend the TV show New Music (produced here in Toronto by a local 
independent station, CityTV) featured a special interview with KB, done recently
in  England (at her home??). I caught it on VHS tape and a transcription is
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>It's about half an hour long. Only a small portion of the questions revealed
things  that I (or any other Love-Hound) didn't already know, but it has got
clips of many  of her videos including &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; and &quot;Ferry-Aid.&quot;
There are even some b/w  pix of her when she was about 10 or 12.

Chmilar) <BR> Subject: Kate on MuchMusic (Canada)
</P>
<P>On Wednesday, June 13 MuchMusic will be airing a one hour Kate Bush feature.
 MuchMusic (&quot;The Nation's Music Station&quot;) is Canada's equivalent to
MTV, only  MUCH better. The show will be on at 9 P.M. Mountain time. (You can
figure it out  for your time zone). 
</P>
<P>The special will include an interview with Kate, live clips, and &quot;never
before seen  in North America&quot; videos (A bit of Army Dreamers is shown in
the promo). Most  avid Kate fans have probably already seen the live and video
clips. The interview was  conducted recently in England, by Laurie Brown. Most
(or all) of the interview has  already been previewed on the weekly Canadian
music show, The New Music.  Laurie tends to be a reasonably well-informed and
well-researched interviewer, so  she doesn't ask &quot;the usual stuff&quot;.
She asks Kate some questions about her recording  technique, her voice, touring
and stage performance, dance, video, family, sound, and  Kate's new studio.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: &quot;I(ED) caught a
glimpse of a god... (MuchMusic)
</P>
<P>Notes on the new Canadian TV interview with Kate Bush: 
</P>
<P>Lori Brown really did do her homework. She's serious, low-key and
respectful,  and her questions are probing and well constructed. 
</P>
<P>This interview marks the first time one really gets to see and listen to
Kate Bush  HERSELF, without all the careful make-up, photographic touch-ups,
flattering  lighting, etc. She is no longer a beautiful young girl, by any
means; and to IED, at  least, this comes as a wonderful revelation. 
</P>
<P>Instead, Kate emerges as a real, adult human being -- good-looking, to be
sure,  but also definitely a little overweight, her face pale and a bit puffy,
with noticeable  rings under the eyes. She no longer seems to have much relation
to the early (ca.  1978) Kate at all. She herself talks about her old persona
almost as though it were a  distant memory. No longer is there any
chameleon-like assumption of a heavy South  London accent during interviews. Her
tone is very dry and flat, her English seems  much more like her brothers'
(close to BBC), and she no longer seems to be intent  on maintaining a sweet and
polite disposition. Above all, this interview gives a very  strong impression of
Kate's intelligence and mature artistic identity. It's very  refreshing to see
the REAL THING for once. 
</P>
<P>This is the interview that every new fan should see before any other
--perhaps  before seeing any of Kate's videos, even. It should dispel any ideas
that they may  have been getting from the old music or from all the media-hype
that surrounds  Kate, to the effect that she is a frail young &quot;Pre-Raphaelite
beauty,&quot; and will instead  force them to face the truth about Kate Bush the
adult artist. Despite a few such  purple phrases, Lori Brown and her crew have
produced a superlative piece of  video-journalism and the best bit of Kate
interview on tape, by miles. But it could  also be something of a shock to those
fans who were more taken by the image than  by the brilliance of her recent
work. 
</P>
<P>There is one extremely significant passage in the interview itself, which
will  appear in L-Hs at any moment courtesy of Henry Chai's posting of the
second part  of his transcription: Kate says, in explaining the RUTH video, that
it was her  &quot;farewell to dance&quot;, and that it marks the end of her
interest in using dance as the  primary vehicle for the expression of her visual
ideas -- the new dominating interest  being film. Which bodes very well indeed
for her art in the future, but discourages  hopes for a tour (or for her return
to top physical condition) any time soon! 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew 
</P>
<P>&quot;...all shining and bright!&quot;

<H2 ALIGN="center">The MuchMusic interview</H2>
<P>    [The following interview was aired on May 30 on Toronto, Canada's
CityTV, which isn't shy about showing KB videos and doing interviews with her.
The interviewer was Laurie Brown. Excerpts of videos were shown during the
course of the interview; these are identified in brackets. Transcribed by Tippi
Chai (Thanks, Tippi!). Edited by Andrew Marvick.]
</P>
<P>     [Laurie Brown's introduction:]
</P>
<P>     What happens when you have a four-octave-range voice; Pre-Raphaelite
Anglo-Irish looks; incredible ability to compose at keyboards; a career in the
British and North American charts over the last decade which brought 17 hit
singles, since the age of 17; a background in dance; and a working knowledge of
literature and drama? [Kate's vocal range, although very great, does not cover
four octaves. In her recordings her voice covers approximately three full
octaves and between one and three half-steps beyond that.] Well, it seems you
have all the ingredients for a classic British art rocker. You also have Kate
Bush. Kate has never performed live in North America and hasn't in England for
the past 7 years. [Strictly speaking, both these statements are untrue. Kate
performed live on the U.S. television programme Saturday Night Live in December
1978, and has appeared (briefly) on stage in England several times since 1979.]
It seems that she's someone who prefers to view the world behind her own garden
wall. Yet lately she has been seen doing other projects. She sang live at the
Palladium with David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, who produced her first album, and
she also did a track and video with Peter Gabriel, a very compatible music
companion to Kate's own work.
</P>
<P>      [Don't Give Up is shown.]
</P>
<P>     Also Kate apppeared in the video of Let It Be, the Ferry Aid single, a
UK charity record to raise money for the family of the victims of the British
ferry disaster.
</P>
<P>      [Kate's appearance in Let It Be is shown.]
</P>
<P>     All of these renewed activities in England have Kate Bush fans hoping
that this bodes well for some future live performances, especially here in North
America.
</P>
<P>     [The interview begins:]
</P>
<P>    &quot;I think that other people tend to assume I don't like doing live
performances because it's been so long since the tour that we did. But it's
really my other commitments, they are just too involved, and since then the
albums have taken longer and longer progressively. And with videos and promotion
that go immediately after an album, I just haven't felt the time or the space to
really get one together, because it would take a long time to put it together.
But I would like to, very much so, and I have really wanted to since the last
one, but it just hadn't been really the time and I'm hoping that it will feel
right and that the time will come again.&quot;
</P>
<P>     [A section of Wow from the Hammersmith Odeon concert film--not the
montage from The Whole Story-- is shown.]
</P>
<P>     I understand that you've built your own studio and you're working from
that now.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, and the difference that makes is phenomenal. One of the best
decisions I've ever made is to get that studio, because automatically I'm
relaxed, and can put the ideas straight onto tape, which again I just could not
afford to do when working in a commercial studio. It's so expensive; you have to
work out a lot before you go in and there's not time to experiment and change
things as much as you'd like. Or if you do, the pressure of what it's costing I
think actually becomes anti-productive.&quot;
</P>
<P>      I'm interested in how your song writing process works. When you're
trying to communicate with other musicians and tell them exactly what you want,
do you give them a tape on cassette?
</P>
<P>     &quot;It very much depends on the musician. Some people would not want
to come in to the studio without having had a cassette that they could listen to
and work some ideas out from. But normally what happens is the musician comes
in, we play the track, which would have the basics on it. I sort of work
backwards to most people in a lot of ways in that the bass quite often goes on
nearly as one of the last instruments. So the track they would hear would have
the drums, piano, voice, some keyboards, even guitar sometimes. And quite often
now, we have a very good atmosphere going on the tape before the musician comes
in, so although it might be very rough, what's on there is a very strong mood of
what it will be like at the end. It's got all the feelings in there, and it's
just a matter of tarting it up!&quot;
</P>
<P>     Yeah, because you don't want to lose that atmosphere.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Yes, it's very difficult to re-create things like that, and
that's why it's so good for me to be able to write straight on to tape. You
might get some really dodgy things, and quite often you do; but there might be
something that is so spontaneous that you won't be able to do again in the same
way, and it's there on tape.&quot;
</P>
<P>     [Wuthering Heights is shown. Laurie Brown then addresses the camera:]
</P>
<P>     This year Kate released The Whole Story, which is both a home video
album and a compilation record of all her biggest hits, and one new track,
Experiment IV. She also re-recorded the vocals for Wuthering Heights.
</P>
<P>      &quot;I wanted to put a contemporary mark on it. I felt it sounded
like a very little girl singing that to me, and the production was very much a
Seventies production. And although there were some other tracks in there that
you could say the same thing of, they weren't as blatant as that one was. If I
had had the time I probably would have done the same to some of the other
tracks. But there was just no time; there was too much to do with recording and
writing Experiment IV plus doing the video. It was a very intense period to get
that out on the deadline.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Where do you think your main strength lies; in your family or music?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think that's a very difficult question, because my family are
very important to me and have been around since I was born, whereas my music is
something that came much later. But there's such a personal involvement with my
music that's very much inspired by people. But it's a very private thing and
it's very much a release for me. I think I've got a tremendous amount of support
from my family which is very important to me. And I don't know if music supports
you; it's not necessarily a comforting thing, but it's like a very close friend,
I guess.&quot; 
</P>
<P>      [Oh! England, My Lionheart, from Hammersmith film, is shown, intercut
with several photographs of Kate as a child, taken by her brother John Carder
Bush. Laurie Brown then addresses the camera again:]
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush is an artist who discovered videos early on and she made a
lot of them. Some of them you are seeing here for the first time. You can tell
she had plenty of input, because they are just as complex and free spirited as
her music. 
</P>
<P>      [Army Dreamers is shown.]
</P>
<P>     I was reading that the two videos that you're most pleased with, and
the ones you like, are Running Up That Hill and Army Dreamers. What was it that
you didn't feel you liked about the other ones?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I have a couple of favourites since then--&quot;
</P>
<P>     Oh, good!
</P>
<P>     &quot;--but the main problem is that when you write a song, you write
it as a song, and not as something that's visual. So quite often there isn't a
visual story contained in a song, in a way that there should be to actually put
on film. Budgets are a particular problem; it costs a lot of money. And time -
usually it's such a rush job to get it together. But more recently we've been
trying to get them done as much up front as possible, and spend more time,
effort and money on them.&quot;
</P>
<P>     What are you new favorites?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I was quite pleased with Cloudbusting and Experiment IV. And
particularly with Army Dreamers, there was very much a visual story that was
adequate for film, rather than just putting a song together; they very much had
visual information that worked well on film.&quot; 
</P>
<P>     [Experiment IV is shown. Laurie Brown again addresses the camera.]
</P>
<P>     Kate Bush is a real innovator when it comes to creating texture in pop
music. She achieves this through a layering process, taking two or three
completely different types of sound to create a whole new sound, a process that
became a lot easier since the advent of the Fairlight synthesizer, the first
sampling machine. 
</P>
<P>    [The Dreaming is shown.]
</P>
<P>    Is the combination of unlike things a kind of oxymoron, something you
apply to your visual work as well as your music?
</P>
<P>    &quot;They are very similar processes, but they are not...The way you
approach them is completely different. With sound, for me what I'm trying to
create is very much the atmosphere, the mood of what the song is designating. It
does create its own personality in a way. And it is a matter of treating that
personality in a way that it wants to, and quite often you think of things that
would be nice to try on a new track and you put them on and the track just won't
accept it; it just won't work. So there are only certain things that will
happen. But visually, it's not so much a layering process as the jigsaw, you
know, putting it all together. It's not quite the same way of layering things up
that you do in sound.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Sometimes all these different images almost look surreal. I'm thinking
of the roller skaters in the white gowns and the dunce caps. Was that just a
neat combination of things, or does it add up to some point?
</P>
<P>      &quot;I think very much with that one it was the combination. It was a
kind of silly video really, which...We wanted it to be slightly comical and it
was playing with several different images of knowledge, really the lack of
knowledge, i.e. people like dunces and jesters. It was a real romp [?--words
unclear], where there were just loads of people involved, the one you're hearing
in the next minute, they're very much just images put together, to try and make
it fun more than anything.&quot;
</P>
<P>     [Sat In Your Lap is shown. Laurie Brown addresses the camera:]
</P>
<P>     You can find dance everywhere in Kate's earlier work. Like David Bowie,
she studied with choreographer Lindsay Kemp, and has incorporated both
choreographed dance and spontaneous movement in her live and video work.
</P>
<P>    [Excerpts from several videos, including There Goes a Tenner and
Suspended in Gaffa, are shown.]
</P>
<P>     Obviously you are someone who feels that the world of dance and the
world of rock can coexist. But does dance absorb rock better than rock absorbs
dance?
</P>
<P>    &quot;I think there is a very basic logic to that, in that if you dance,
it's very, very unusual to dance without music. Dance is always something that
is done to music, this is what dance is about--you know, the rhythm. Even if
it's just someone tapping out rhythms on a drum. That is, music is sound, and
dance works hand in hand with sound. And I think music can stand on its own, but
in some cases what it makes you want to do is dance!&quot;
</P>
<P>     I think Running Up That Hill is one of the better examples of how dance
can be used well in rock music.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Well, it's very nice that you think that, because very much what
we were trying to achieve was to make it a serious piece of dance, which I
didn't feel I'd done enough of up until that point. I'd played around with
dance, but in a very...sort of theatrical way. And in some ways it was a sort of
saying-goodbye to that dancing side of me, by doing it in a very pure way. It is
a very pure dance video without any theatre or anything attached, because I feel
very much a shift now from dance into film imagery, so they are two very
different things. Not that dance couldn't still be incorporated, but it's not
the same attitude.&quot;
</P>
<P>     [An excerpt from Running Up That Hill is shown. Brown addresses the
camera:]
</P>
<P>     The years between seventeen and twenty-seven are normally considered to
be the most developmental in an artist's life. [This is absolute nonsense.] When
Mozart was seventeen, he was playing to the crowned heads of Europe. When Kate
Bush was seventeen she had her first hit single with Wuthering Heights. I asked
her how spending those 10 years as a successful pop singer influenced her art.
</P>
<P>     &quot;I'm not convinced they are the most influential years, I must
say. I think when you're a kid, they're incredibly influential, I mean so many
writers, and I don't know about singers...But from a creative point of view
you're always drawing back to things way back in your childhood. But a lot of
things have changed for me in that period you were talking about, and I think
it's been incredibly useful for me to be successful during this time, in that
I've been able to work with people and find sources of information that perhaps
I wouldn't have otherwise. Unfortunately, so much of what we do in this business
is based on money. Equipment is so very expensive. So if you are successful, you
stand a chance of having more of this equipment available and that does
definitely affect the way you work.&quot;
</P>
<P>     [A section of Strange Phenomena from the Hammersmith film is shown.]
</P>
<P>     When listening to your album, from the very first to the most recent,
there's a change in your voice and it seems that your voice is lower and a
little more aggressive, as if you're working harder in punching out the lyrics.
</P>
<P>     &quot;Lyrics have always been very important for me, and all people go
through phases of things they try out, and at that period when I made that first
album, I was very much experimenting with a higher vocal range. It was just
something I wanted to try out, and also the production has a tremendous amount
to do with things like that. But my voice has changed a lot, and I think that is
basically what I see as the difference, that as I grow up, my voice has grown up
with me and has become stronger and stronger, and I can do things now with my
voice that were not easy for me to do years ago.&quot;
</P>
<P>     Has your voice lost any of its range?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I can get up there if I need to, but I just prefer working in
this range now. I think a lot of females go through that. If you listen to Joni
Mitchell, her early stuff is very high, and with each album she gets lower and
lower. It's just a progressive thing for people.&quot; 
</P>
<P>     [Cloudbusting is shown.]
</P>
<P>     I've been noticing a theme of science in the last few songs you had
out. Cloudbusting was an experiment that went very well, but Experiment IV was
one that want wrong. But in both cases the scientists were sympathetic
characters, but they were frustrated and manipulated. Is that what you think
about scientists?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I don't think it's always what I think about scientists, but I
think they are fascinating in that so often they're trying to create something
that they consider positive, productive and very much something that would help
mankind, but so often along the way those good intentions end up being used,
particularly by other people, for completely the opposite reasons. Particularly
experiments that end up being used by the military, things like the atom bomb. I
can see that perhaps when the guy was originally playing with that idea, he had
no idea where he'd end up, and that I'm sure that he wouldn't have the evil
intentions in his head initially. He was so caught up, so obsessed with the pure
level of the science that he didn't actually realize how it could be used.&quot;
</P>
<P>      What do you think about scientific experimentation? Are there limits
to the things that people should be working on?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think that's very much part of the fascination, is that people
have to do that, that's what human beings are about--discovering things, and
perhaps the problem is that they're normally always connected by forces that do
not have that same kind of creative curiosity. The consequences, that's the
problem; the consequences are quite often hindsight, rather than on the way.&quot;
</P>
<P>      [An excerpt from Experiment IV is shown.]
</P>
<P>     &quot;I consider music a really positive force, it's something that is
there to help people, to make them happy, to make them think. So many wonderful
things, music therapy...It's a very positive energy and there's something
incredibly beautiful about music. And the thought of people using sound in such
a negative way--and there are definitely sonic experiments that go on, that are
used by the military--it's so obscene. The irony of using something that's so
beautiful, in a way, to actually kill people rather than help them, I find
fascinating.&quot;
</P>
<P>     A lot of your songs and videos are filled with frightening or
disquieting images. Are you an uneasy person?
</P>
<P>     &quot;I think anyone that has any kind of creative outlet is uneasy,
and that's what makes them need to express themselves. I think all human beings
are uneasy on some level. How can you not be when we don't really know what
we're doing here and what we're meant to do with it, it's the continual
questioning going on.&quot;
