<p>Kate Bush Touches The U.S. At Last 
</p>

<p>From Pulse! April 1984 
</p>

<p>by Richard Laermer 
</p>



<p> Kate Bush first touched America's music sensibilities in 1977 with the release of 
her first record, a mysterious, melodic collection called The Kick Inside [the album 
wasn't released until 1978] and an appearance on Saturday Night Live, performing 
strange mime to some of her more viscerally meaningful lyrics. While many viewers 
scoffed at the undefinable movement on the screen, some ran out in curiosity to buy 
the product behind the performance. 
</p>

<p>The Kick Inside feature Bush as writer, singer, and keyboardist, and dissects such 
esoteric subjects as telepathy, sensuality, incest, and the classic film Wuthering 
Heights. In 1977, a year laden with disco, Kate's vinyl presence stood out as new and 
original. But the Bush sound - unusual to be sure - has taken time to catch on in this 
country. While British critics call Kate &quot;too commercial,&quot; because of her frequent 
appearances on family talk shows and other promotional venues, her label, EMI, has 
felt until recently that her records were &quot;too British for American tastes.&quot; So, with 
only one of her four records available here domestically, Bush fans had to search the 
import bins for her product. Her second album, Lionheart, was suddenly released 
without explanation by EMI on January 13 and it entered Billboard's LP and tape 
charts at #202, Kate's first appearance on those charts. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know why they released it,&quot; said Caroline Prutzman of EMI in New 
York. &quot;I think EMI believes in Kate and would like to see her break over here. They 
have all that material, and she does have a following, so it seems like a good idea.&quot; So 
good, in fact, that by the time this Pulse! hits the stores, EMI should have a domestic 
release of Kate's third album, Never For Ever, in the stores. 
</p>

<p>&quot;It's hard to say exactly what they're trying to do.&quot; Prutzman commented, &quot;but 
Kate's video (Kate Bush In Concert) has been playing all over the country, and it's 
been received very well.&quot; That video is also commercially available. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Only two of my records have actually been released in America,&quot; Kate notes 
from her studio in Great Britain. &quot;I was really pleased that there were so many 
people trying to get hold of the albums on import.&quot; 
</p>

<p>This sentiment is from a 25-year old lady who began writing songs at age 11. She 
says, &quot;I didn't think I was going to do it for a profession. It was fun, something I 
really enjoyed. I spent most of my time create scenarios for songs. At 16 I had gotten 
to the point where my songs were presentable. That was after five years of writing 
ballads and slow songs like 'The Man With The Child In His Eyes.'&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate started recording her songs at that young age with the help of close friend 
David Gilmour [actually they weren't and aren't &quot;close friends&quot;], lead singer of Pink 
Floyd. Gilmour was so impressed with his pal's burgeoning talent that when she was 
16 he introduced Kate and her vast collection of music to EMI. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I signed a recording contract at 16. The hardest thing,&quot; Kate admits modestly, 
&quot;was choosing the songs.&quot; Having stockpiled much more than an album's worth of 
songs, she was able to choose from the cream of the crop. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; the first single, was a huge it in several European countries. 
&quot;The story in 'Wuthering Heights' had been bugging me for about a month,&quot; Kate 
recalls, pondering on the lives on Emily Bronte's doomed lovers. &quot;At the time I was 
recording the album, I began to down my thoughts on Cathy and Heathcliff and 
their incredible relationship. I really enjoyed the energy between those two.&quot; 
</p>

<p>And so did single buyers in England, pushing Kate Bush to superstar status her 
first time out. She toured the continent and Japan - where The Kick Inside still 
reigns as a national favorite - and returned six months later to record Lionheart, a 
quickly-produced recording that Kate now things [sic: thinks] harshly about: &quot;I had 
only a week after we got back from Japan to prepare for the album. I was lucky to 
get it together so quickly. But the songs seem to me, now, to be somewhat 
overproduced. I didn't put enough time into them.&quot; She gave more time, and 
thought, to her 1980 release, Never For Ever, her first self-produced effort which, 
surprisingly enough, sported her first released single (&quot;Babooshka&quot;) in the states and 
a big selling cult single in several American cities (the import &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;). 
</p>

<p>The U.S. record buyer, however, ignored Kate until '82 when the rocker LP The 
Dreaming came out stateside in large quantities and suddenly the anonymity of a 
singer from Kent, England was reversed. That albums' hard sound proved to be her 
American kick-off, and due to the newfound saleability of Kate Bush, EMI quickly 
followed The Dreaming with a 1983 EP featuring some of her best material from the 
pervious four releases (called Kate Bush). Available only in the United States and 
Canada, this limited edition, with Kate dramatically poised in brass armor, was 
EMI's intended mode of bringing U.S. attention to Britain's singer elite. 
</p>

<p>Strength was her one motive when commencing work on The Dreaming, she 
says, explaining how for the first time she relied &quot;on the power of the music&quot; rather 
than sultry tunes and serene lyrics prominent in her previous albums. And the 
power in Kate Bush's music was an evolutionary process that is traced in the Kate 
Bush EP, fusing the new Bush force with those beautifics utilized in the earlier 
records. 
</p>

<p>&quot;I was trying, in The Dreaming, to get myself up to the point I knew I was 
capable of,&quot; kate says of the search for power. &quot;the Dreaming was my emotional 
image and I am thankful that I had good people to help with the dynamics.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The last studio effort took almost two years to complete as she needed to work 
with specific technical directors who, unfortunately, weren't always available for 
her. Today she works with only one. &quot;I was looking for a certain imagination in an 
engineer and I ended up going with quite a few and working in many different 
studios,&quot; she notes. &quot;That's not what I would've wanted to do.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The visual imageries that come across in The Dreaming are due, she points out, 
&quot;to the painstaking time we took to get every effect perfect.&quot; &gt;From The Kick Inside 
to the last album, movement has been an evident element in her work. Kate 
mentions how, &quot;Back when I recorded Kick I had just discovered the enjoyment of 
dance and I was so knocked out by that, that writing was a breeze for me.&quot; Dance, 
and the fine art of movement, Kate says, are responsible for the free flow of many of 
her songs. 
</p>

<p>In The Dreaming, she lends a topical theme to many cuts. &quot;Sat In Your Lap,&quot; a 
punk influenced homage to pop Brit culture circa 1982, shows off Kate's feelings on 
knowledge and education: &quot;Knowledge is something sat in your lap/something that 
you never have,&quot; because, in the singer's eyes, &quot;the more you realize, the more you 
need to learn.&quot; But other parts of the record present a more maudlin view of things: 
The crazed &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; was inspired by the horrors in Steven Kings 
The Shining and utilized several overlapping tracks that simulate madness. Kate sings 
about a house that takes over, a house possessed by devilish innards. 
</p>

<p>&quot;When I'm writing a particular song,&quot; she says excitedly, &quot;I can feel a character 
so strongly that perhaps I'm feeling the same.&quot; Well aware that her songs provide 
listeners with some extreme characterizations, she finds it &quot;terribly important ... to 
make the person I am writing about come alive. Unless I can somehow live the 
experience I don't feel that I've achieved what I want to as a writer.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Kate is busy these days putting the pre-studio finishing touches on her fifth 
record. &quot;I've been writing material for my new album - the songs are almost 
complete now,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope to start recording in a couple of months when I've 
finished writing and tightening up the lyrics.&quot; As for the direction the record's 
music will take, she hasn't decided yet. She will venture to the U.S. later this year 
to promote it but not to tour. &quot;It's a shame, but for now I don't see the possibility of 
a tour,&quot; she says with a sigh. &quot;We can't afford to do it the way I'd want to.&quot; The way 
she wants to do it is right. For now she will wait and see the reaction to her newest 
product, and in the meantime hope that her American success continues to grow. 
About America, Kate is glad that video has made it to the forefront of 
entertainment. Having produced a clip for each single to date, on of her problems in 
not catching on here, she is well aware, has been the lack of video venues. These 
days most musically inclined cable channels carry Kate's work, both past and 
present. (According to ABC's 20/20, Kate was one of the ground-breakers in video 
production - years before MTV.) 
</p>

<p>On the twentieth anniversary of the Beatles' invasion, Kate said she only became 
&quot;very interested in the Beatles about four years ago. I'd always liked their singles 
but only really started listening to their albums a little while ago. I think they are a 
great influence on any writer,&quot; she noted, &quot;the quality of their work is something, I 
feel, every composer aspires to.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Specific songs have left their mark on Kate Bush: &quot;So many records have left 
great impressions on me. It is always hard to just call them all to mind so quickly but 
to mention a few - &quot;No. 9 Dream&quot; by John Lennon: &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; by The 
Beatles: &quot;He's My Man&quot; by Billie Holiday: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; by Robert Palmer: 
&quot;Really Good Time&quot; by Roxy Music: &quot;Tropical Hot Dog Night&quot; by Captain Beefheart: 
&quot;Montana&quot; by Frank Zappa: music by Eberhard Weber, and &quot;the Wall&quot; by Pink 
Floyd (and pal David Gilmour).&quot; 
</p>

<p>The first record this lady of music ever purchased was &quot;They're Coming To Take 
Me Away, Ha-Ha&quot; by Napoleon XIV. She was very young. Pondering the subject of 
when she got into music, said that, &quot;I've always been into music. I was a child then 
and I think all children embrace music.&quot; 
</p>

<p>These days Kate finds she's too busy to get involved in pop culture. &quot;Since I've 
been in the business I've had a lot less time to keep up with what's happening,&quot; she 
said regretfully. &quot;I don't feel I have to 'keep up' as such, but I always love to hear 
good music and see new interesting bands.&quot; 
</p>

<p>But most of what she listens to these days is classical. &quot;Very little contemporary - 
mostly old favorite records and Radio 4.&quot; Britain's quiet one on the dial.

Subject: Gossip interview ca. 1985 
</p>



<p>[This interview is def. a plagiarism, not to say simple shit! --WIE]
</p>



<p>I don't know, but I thought that I could look it up, too. Not true. I found a gossip 
story about Kate in a Dutch music magazine. It's not much, so I translated it. I 
wonder if they asked Kate the question, or if they made up the answers. Can 
anybody verify the answers? 
</p>

<p>I got the page from a friend of mine, and didn't ask for the issue number or the 
date. These data or not available, sorry. Anyway, it must have been about five years 
ago. Kate 'says'(?) that she has a steady friend for seven years (Del), maybe that's a 
clue?

<p>Here at last is the article that appeared in the February issue of DISCoveries : 
</p>



<p>The Sensual World of Kate Bush 
</p>

<p>by William R. Creal 
</p>

<p>It was late on a cold, dark night in the winter of '81-'82. I was a tired, 
disenchanted lump, sinking deeper into the oblivion of the couch, mindlessly flipping 
channels on the television, when suddenly I was startled into consciousness. A 
barefoot young woman, with a black cowboy costume clinging seductively to her 
lithe body, was sensuously snaking across a stage. She was armed with a rifle and 
was using it to mow down three male attackers to the accompaniment of swirling 
musical rhythms, punctuated by imaginary gunfire. For the next fifteen minutes and 
through two more equally transcendent songs, I was captivated by her performance. 
Even more, I felt privileged -- madly fortunate. It was as if I had stumbled upon 
some forgotten wonder not of this world. I was intoxicated, transported, bewitched; 
in short, I was introduced to Kate Bush. 
</p>

<p>I later learned I had viewed the final portion of the Live at Hammersmith video. 
That information, while enlightening, did me little good at the time. The video 
seemed unavailable in any store this side of the moon. Still, I made my discovery. 
Soon I was hearing that distinctive, exotic voice on the local progressive radio station. 
Then, the infant MTV began running two stunning videos of this enchantress. I 
couldn't get enough; unfortunately, I quickly learned how literally true that 
statement was. Kate Bush was a &quot;serious artist.&quot; A label which was, and still is to 
some extent, the equivalent of a commercial death sentence as far as many record 
industry magnates are concerned. I could hear her and I could see her, but I 
couldn't bring her home. 
</p>

<p>When at last the fates graciously allowed a progressive record store to open 
nearby, I had three albums to catch up on, and two questions to answer: who was 
Kate Bush, and from where did she come? 
</p>



<p>Them Heavy People 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush was born one midsummer's night on a forsaken English moor to the 
god, Apollo and the muse, Euterpe. Her childhood was spent roaming the 
surrounding hills with her cousin Pan, philosophizing with him and developing her 
inherited musical talents. She explored the mystical world within her, absorbing, 
then discarding reality, determined to create her own more perfect, more sensual 
world. She was part enchantress, part sorceress, casting her spells with deep, radiant 
eyes, goddess-like beauty, and a voice capable of charming the most ferocious of 
beasts. And when at last she ventured forth amongst the mortals, none could resist 
her. 
</p>

<p>There is, of course, an *official* version, which contends that Catherine Bush was 
born to Dr. Robert and Hannah Bush in the county of Kent, England, on July 30, 
1958. Though she had a normal childhood, she was not a normal child. Her family 
recognized this, it seems, from the moment of birth and they respected and 
encouraged her uniqueness, giving her ample freedom to discover and develop her 
abilities. 
</p>

<p>Cathy's early development was greatly influenced by her older brothers: Paddy, a 
telented and versatile musician with a fondness for unusual instruments, and John 
Carder Bush, an accomplished poet and photographer. Their gentle guidance 
introduced Cathy to a panorama of fabulous territory, all of it awaiting her special 
touch. To this day, her brothers remain among her staunchest supporters, Paddy 
contributing musically and John with album and single sleeve photography. 
</p>

<p>To say Cathy Bush was precocious would be an understatement. By fourteen, she 
had composed numerous songs on the family piano, setting her poetry to music. Two 
years later, through the intervention of a friend, she met David Gilmour, of Pink 
Floyd. After early rejections by the music companies, Gilmour helped her sift 
through dozens of songs for a suitable demo tape which was recorded at his home 
studio. The tape was presented to EMI, Pink Floyd's label, and the company was so 
impressed with her abilities they advanced her enough money to take time to refine 
her creations and inevitably -- to grow into the woman, Kate Bush. 
</p>

<p>During this period, she left school, unable to find meaning in the 
creativity-stifling environment of organized education. With Paddy, she formed the 
KT Bush Band. The origainal lineup also included a bass player named Del Palmer, 
who would quickly occupy an irreplaceable spot in both her musical and personal 
life. She took dance and mime lessons, too, learning skills that when eventually 
coupled with her music, would yield a stunningly unique result. 
</p>

<p>In 1978, EMI saw its investment pay off in a big way. 
</p>



<p>Rolling the Ball 
</p>

<p>&quot;Out of the wily, windy moors.. .&quot; 
</p>

<p>With these words, preceded by a tinkling of fairy dust as the spell was cast, Kate 
Bush ensorcelled the unsuspecting music public. Her piercing, ethereal voice wailed 
like a greedy siren: &quot;Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away.&quot; And she did. 
That first, trademark single, Wuthering Heights, fought its way to number one in 
the U.K. and in most of the Western European countries, while the album itself, 
THE KICK INSIDE (released in February 1978), went triple platinum. All this in the 
midst of a musical and cultural revolution as bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash 
attemped to rearrange the world through their savagely chaotic songs. Kate's fragile 
voice and the delicately intimate subject matter of her lyrics crept through the 
carnage and created a niche all its own. 
</p>

<p>Although backed by a massive promotional campaign featuring posters of an 
innocently voluptuous Kate, the record was not an overnight smash. It took time for 
the music press to understand this extraordinary creature, but by the release of the 
second single, The Man with the Child in His Eyes (No. 6 on U.K. charts), she 
conquered both the critics and the public. (Something yet to happen on a large scale 
in the U.S.) 
</p>

<p>From the cry of whales that opens the album, through songs thick with the heat 
of impassioned lovers, to the soothing title tracks and its tale of incest and suicide 
which closes it, THE KICK INSIDE sustains a mystical sensuality, never straying so 
far into reality that the magic is diluted. In her liner notes, Kate requests &quot;all of you 
with open ears, please feel it.&quot; And in the end, the entranced listener is compelled to 
do just that. 
</p>



<p>They Took the Game Right Out of It 
</p>

<p>Her second album, LIONHEART, rushed together in less than two months, was a 
gasp for creative breath. EMI was not about to let the whirlwinds of publicity stop 
spinning -- they wanted another album at once. Thus, in November 1978, less than 
nine months after THE KICK INSIDE appeared, LIONHEART was born, 
prematurely. 
</p>

<p>There was not enough time to do this one right, at least not the way Kate would 
have liked it. While there are several excellent new songs, most are simply reworked 
versions of songs that didn't make the first album. As such, there is both a 
noticeable lack of unity, and an absence of purpose. It is more a 
stream-of-consciousness album, meandering from one idea and musical style to 
another, rather than the purposeful flow of lyrical and instrumental concepts 
normally expected from a Kate Bush concoction. 
</p>

<p>Given that, it is nevertheless interesting. The singles Hammer Horror (No. 44) and 
Wow (No. 14) are worthy successors to her previous hits, and the quasi-title track, 
mourning a dying-going-on-dead British airman, has a graceful, caressing melody 
and Kate's usual *unusual* atmospheric vocals. 
</p>

<p>Other songs deal with a girl's maturing ability to cope with death and life ( 
Symphony in Blue ) and with a young boy's loss of childhood innocence ( In Search 
of Peter Pan ). There are homosexual lovers in Kashka from Baghdad, and a 
food-poisoner serving &quot;hemlock on the rocks&quot; in Coffee Homeground. As on THE 
KICK INSIDE, the music is piano-based, as Kate continued to use that instrument to 
work out her songs. 
</p>

<p>Overall, LIONHEART is a pleasant album, but it clearly did not benefit from the 
exteriorly imposed deadline, and so is not definitive Kate Bush. Still, it paid off for 
EMI, going gold and peaking at No. 6 on the U.K. charts. Meanwhile, Kate's rapid 
ascent into stardom continued. In various polls of January 1979, she was named the 
No. 2 Female Sex Object. (The latter aided, no doubt, by the gorgeous photos on 
LIONHEART .) 
</p>

<p>The next step was the obligatory tour, but this time and for all time to come, she 
did not tolerate any outside interferences or demands. The result was a landmark 
tour that was all Kate Bush, and a lightning journey from mere stardom to superstar 
immortality. 
</p>



<p>Wow Wow Wow 
</p>

<p>The tour of spring 1979 was conceived, written, designed, directed, 
choreographed, produced, and oh, yes, performed by Kate Bush. For upwards of two 
and a half hours per, for twenty-eight shows in six weeks, across the U.K. and 
Europe, it was performed by Kate Bush. Drawing on everything she had learned for 
the past five years, it was the perfect and unprecedented combination of dance, 
theater, and music. It was not a revolutionary set of concerts in the truest sense of 
the word because no one else, apparently including Kate who has never toured 
again, could ever hope to duplicate it. It has, over time, simply become a legendary 
achievement. 
</p>

<p>It was her first opportunity to have total control over a project and she took full 
advantage of it. In each concert, there was a complete costume change virtually 
every other song, a total of about seventeen per show. During the longer breaks, to 
keep the mood alive there were poetry readings by brother John. Each song was 
treated to a set of props unique to itself: a parachute for Oh England, My Lionheart ; 
umbrellas for the dancers in Kite ; human violins for Violin. On other songs, like 
Wow, she showed that with only a headset, she could generate as much excitement 
in one square foot of stage as she could supported by any number of props or 
dancers. 
</p>

<p>The British music press was struck with awe. Reported Melody Maker: &quot;The most 
magnificent spectacle I've ever encountered in the world of rock.&quot; Said the Bristol 
Evening Post : &quot;A major artist by any standards. . .each aspect was perfect in itself. . 
.spectacular entertainment.&quot; And from the Record Mirror : &quot;The best welding of 
rock and theatrical presentation that we're ever likely to see.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The amazing success of the tour showed what Kate could do when she had 
complete creative control, and going back into the studio for the next album, she was 
not about to relinquish it. 
</p>



<p>I'm Coming For You 
</p>

<p>NEVER FOR EVER, released in late 1980, is in many ways her REVOLVER. From 
the cover artwork depicting a myriad of Boschian creatures soaring out from under 
her billowing skirt (directly into her music, one presumes), to the subject matter of 
the songs, it is a major transitional point in Kate's career. 
</p>

<p>Musically, it is influenced by the arrival of the Fairlight, a computer sampling 
device which, when she had mastered it, would give Kate the power to better 
compose her music and translate her emotions into sound. Lyrically, the mystical, 
other-worldly aura of the previous albums was evolving into a philosophical 
introspection as she began to assimilate the realities of the world into her own life's 
experiences. As a result, it is her first album that is as stimulating to the intellect as 
it is to the senses. 
</p>

<p>The initial single, Breathing (No. 16), stunned reviewers with its passionate 
rendering of nuclear Armageddon from the viewpoint of a fetus who only wants to 
&quot;keep breathing.&quot; It is as close as Kate ever gets to a &quot;protest song.&quot; (Though over 
the years she has supported many causes, her spirit seems to be more that of a 
Samaritan than a protester.) 
</p>

<p>Babooshka, the next single to be released, related the weaving of a tangled 
marital web by a wife testing her spouse's fidelity. It made No. 5, thus becoming 
her highest charting single since Wuthering Heights. 
</p>

<p>The final release, Army Dreamers (No. 16), crackles with detached irony as it 
describes the homecoming of a dead soldier, imagining what might have been. 
(Military men don't fair too well with Kate. Yet another one gets it in Pull Out the 
Pin on her next LP, THE DREAMING .) 
</p>

<p>NEVER FOR EVER was also Kate's first attempt at production (she co-produced 
with Jon Kelly) and she had to be encouraged when the album made No. 1 and went 
platinum. 
</p>



<p>The Pull of the Bush 
</p>

<p>Having been introduced to the Fairlight on the last album, by the release of THE 
DREAMING (September 1982) it had become Kate's primary method of working 
out songs. On the album itself, she employs it to great effect on nearly every track. 
Still, although it climbed to No. 3, the album also seemed to climb right over the 
collective heads of the British radio producers and EMI execs. 
</p>

<p>The first single, Sat in Your Lap, was actually released over a year before the 
album came out and did fairly well (No. 11). It also marked a turning point in her 
career as it reflects a struggle for knowledge amidst a barrage of sonic chaos. It was 
a stylistic departure for her, burying once and for all the little wondering girl image 
that had begun to fade on NEVER FOR EVER. 
</p>

<p>The Dreaming, the next single, was even more confusing. Why should Kate Bush 
sing about the Australian aborigines' fight to save their spiritual homeland? And 
why does it have to sound like it *really is* an aboriginal song? It was not promoted 
well and peaked at No. 48. It was Kate at her creative best, which basically means it 
was too confusting for the corporate heads at EMI. 
</p>

<p>The third single, There Goes a Tenner, an unpretentious little tune about a bad 
night in the lives of a band of Keystone robbers, did even worse. It became her first 
single ever to not make it on the charts. A fourth song, Suspended in Gaffa, was a 
smash in Canada and almost all of Europe; however, it was not released as a single in 
Britain. 
</p>

<p>In addition to the great influence of the Fairlight, this album is also significant in 
that it was her first as sole producer. Bit by bit, Kate had taken over nearly every 
aspect of her work. The final step was to build a home studio where she could 
experiment with her songs in complete solitude and without the pressures of 
knowing she was running up the bill in a rented studio. Construction of the studio 
began in mid-1983 and when it was completed, the construction of her fifth album 
commenced. 
</p>



<p>A Big Woof 
</p>

<p>HOUNDS OF LOVE, released in September 1985 and produced by Kate at her 
new in-home studio, is by far her most instrumentally diverse, intellectually, and 
emotionally satisfying album. It is, in fact, two distinct albums, each with its own title, 
cover photo, and side. The first side is essentially a collection of masterful singles, as 
four of the five songs were eventually released as such. The first, Running Up That 
Hill (No. 3), considered by some to be her greatest all-around song, actually received 
fairly consistent airplay on some radio stations in the States. Following that success 
were Cloudbusting (No. 20), based on Peter Reich's A Book of Dreams ; the title 
track (No. 18), featuring a barking Kate; and The Big Sky (No. 37), with its 
thundering drums, and Kate's lightning shrieks. 
</p>

<p>Side two, with a photo of an apparently soaking wet Kate, is a conceptual piece 
titled THE NINTH WAVE. It starts in a dream ( And Dream of Sheep ), ends in fog 
( The Morning Fog ), and between it tows the listener along some of her most 
memorable imagery and complex symbolism. It is basically a Hamlet-like &quot;to be or 
not to be&quot; dilemma, set at sea (a &quot;sea of troubles&quot;?), and experienced by a 
going-down-for-the-third-time Ophelia. The heroine does not necessarily seek 
suicide, simply relief, and during her struggles she is visited by witch hunters ( 
Waking the Witch ), ghosts ( Watching You Without Me ), and future selves ( Jig of 
Life ). It is a challenging set, both to the listener and to Kate herself, who with THE 
NINTH WAVE has forged a kind of Dark Side of the Ocean. 
</p>

<p>The album hit number one, went double platinum, and is without question a 
masterpiece. 
</p>

<p>In 1986, an excellent compilation album, THE WHOLE STORY, was released. 
Besides collecting the obvious hits, it also contains one new single, Experiment IV 
(No. 23), and new vocals to Wuthering Heights. The latter is especially interesting 
since her voice, like herself, had nearly a decade to mature. Significantly missing 
from this version is that sprinkling of fairy dust that began the original; its absence 
serves to bring full circle Kate's personal and professional growth. THE WHOLE 
STORY, with its accompanying video, is a terrific encapsulation of her remarkable 
talents. The album, by the way, went No. 1, and triple platinum. 
</p>



<p>Mmmmh, Yes 
</p>

<p>Molly Bloom steps out of the page tentatively. Her initial sensation, the soothing 
sound of bells -- at first soft and low as if coming from far beyond the hills -- but 
then, as she emerges completely with dormant senses fully awakened, they are 
strong and loud, heralding her arrival. And ours, in THE SENSUAL WORLD. 
</p>

<p>The first and title track on Kate's new album, THE SENSUAL WORLD was 
released this past September and quickly nestled into the U.K. Top 10 [?]. (The 
12-inch version has a double-tracked A-side, with or without the vocals depending 
on where the needle hits.) It captures and transplants the aforementioned Molly 
Bloom and her erotic recollections from the final chapter of James Joyce's complex 
epic, Ulysses, into a three-dimensional *real* world of the senses. 
</p>

<p>The song is awash in Irish music (Uillean pipes, bouzouki, fiddle), while Kate's 
seductive vocals become one with the instruments, now on top, now immersed, as if 
floating gently along on the undulating waves of sound. Lyrically, it is as sinuously 
absorbing as the original, unlike anything else in Kate's catalog. 
</p>

<p>In the Kate Bush musical feast, if THE KICK INSIDE was the tasty appetizer, and 
HOUNDS OF LOVE a hardy main course, then THE SENSUAL WORLD is certainly 
the rich, creamy dessert. Its songs go down smoothly and leave you licking your lips. 
Overall, it is a distinctly feminine album, as Kate wraps her voice lovingly around 
every syllable, coaxing the purest sound out of each letter. The effect of THE 
SENSUAL WORLD is so alluring that when I finished listening to the record for the 
first time, I almost asked it out. 
</p>

<p>The second British single, (released in November, with the 7-inch issued as a 
picture disc, EMPD 119, and the 12-inch with a limited edition poster sleeve, 12EMP 
119) was This Woman's Work, work being synonymous with labor and labor being 
the reason for the song's birth. Previously available only on the movie soundtrack of 
She's Having a Baby, it is an achingly beautiful tune about the regrets of one's life 
when faced with the death of a loved one: &quot;all the things we should've said that 
were never said.&quot; Being released so near Christmas, you have the feeling that if he 
had heard this song, Scrooge would never have needed the three spirits to effect his 
transformation. 
</p>

<p>Kate is assisted on three songs by the Trio Bulgarka, a group of Bulgarian women 
whose stirring voices wordlessly enhance the music, and on a song like Deeper 
Understanding, even elevate it to a higher emotional plateau. 
</p>

<p>Other highlights on the album include: Heads We're Dancing, in which our 
heroine is swept off her feet by a &quot;charming man&quot; who, unknown to her at the time, 
would soon thereafter sweep through Poland; Love and Anger, the first U.S. single 
released by CBS, Kate's new American label, and featuring old pal Dave Gilmour; 
and Rocket's Tail, with both the Trio Bulgarka and vintage Floydian guitar work 
from Gilmour. The latter song is about whatever you would like to think it's about, 
but just remember, it's dedicated to her cat. 
</p>

<p>Upon its release in England, THE SENSUAL WORLD entered the charts at No. 2. 
It remains to be seen, however, what the record will do in the U.S. CBS seems to 
having some trouble handling it. Supposedly, they felt there were no songs that were 
appropriate single material for U.S. radio. Well that's the point, isn't it? Kate's 
songs, thankfully, are not easy to segue into or out of, especially on American Top 40 
radio. CBS' dilemma is the ultimate confirmation of Kate's uniqueness. 
</p>

<p>As could have been expected, the album was written and produced solely by 
Kate, and recorded by Del Palmer. Brother Paddy and Dr. Bush make appearances, 
and the cover photo (Molly in full &quot;bloom,&quot; perhaps?) was taken by brother John. 
Despite any problems there might be in the U.S., the album nevertheless seems 
destined to swell the ranks of the Kate Bush Club (P.O. Box 120, Welling, Kent, U.K. 
DA16 3DS). 
</p>

<p>As far as CBS, well, how about a little deeper understanding, guys? After all, it 
could have been worse: instead of Ulysses, it might have been Finnegans Wake. 
</p>



<p>Bushabilia: The Collectible Kate 
</p>

<p>In the spring of 1988, a poll conducted by the British magazine, Record Collector, 
showed Kate Bush to be the most collectible female artist, and the thirteenth most 
collectible artist overall. Collecting Kate is not only a popular pastime, but an old one 
as well. The first true piece of Bushabilia was a beautiful limited-edition picture disc 
of THE KICK INSIDE, issued in the U.K. in late 1979. (It was later reissued in North 
America.) Of course, virtually any of her early records are now collectors items. 
</p>

<p>Among her singles, the real rarities are the non-U.K./U.S. editions. Many, like 
the Canadian issue of The Man with the Child in His Eyes, have different picture 
sleeves than their American or English counterparts. Other songs were included as 
singles exclusively in selected countries. For instance, there is French release of Ne 
T'en Fui Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant (EMI 5444) and the Canadian version (72917) 
which has Dreamtime as the B-side. Un Baiser D'Enfant (79231) was also released in 
Canada with Suspended in Gaffa as the B-side. Perhaps the rarest of these is Night 
of the Swallow (from THE DREAMING ) recorded in Dublin and featuring several 
popular Irish musicians, and accordingly was released only in Ireland. 
</p>

<p>Two other 7-inch rarities come from the HOUNDS OF LOVE LP. The first is an 
interview picture disc released only in Italy (KBP1). The front has the same picture 
of Kate as the Hounds of Love single, but the reverse is a lovely shot of her in a 
sweeping, low-cut ethnic gown. The second 7-inch rarity is the U.K. release of The 
Big Sky (KBP4) single on picture disc, though not as difficult to find as the Italian 
interview. You will recognize it by the nice photos of that wonderful face on front 
and back. 
</p>

<p>One of the most attractive of all Kate Bush collectibles is The Single File (KBS1), a 
boxed set. Originally released in 1983 in the U.K. and the U.S. (where it was a 
numbered, limited edition), this handsome set contains all of Kate's singles (with 
reproductions of the original picture sleeves) from Wuthering Heights through 
There Goes a Tenner. As a bonus, it throws in the aforementioned French single Ne 
T'en Fui Pas and the Kate Bush Live on Stage EP. And if that's not enough, there's 
even a nice lyric/photo booklet. 
</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, there are similarly interesting items among Kate's 12-inch 
collectibles. For starters, beginning with Running Up That Hill (12KB1), all (five) of 
Kate's singles have also been released in 12-inch format. Each contains remixed 
versions of the single as well as at least one other non-album cut. Some of the 
reworked versions, Alternate Hounds of Love for instance, are as exciting as the 
original. And never overlook the B-sides of any Kate Bush single; some, like Under 
the Ivy (flip side of Running Up That Hill ), are among her most intimate and 
moving songs. 
</p>

<p>As far as LPs are concerned, the earliest collectibles are the three different covers 
of THE KICK INSIDE. The U.K. and most of Europe issued the oriental-styled &quot;kite&quot; 
cover, with Kate gliding across a giant eye, while the Harvest label in the U.S. and 
Canada chose a stunning close-up for their releases. Subsequently, EMI America 
rereleased the U.S. album, this time with the familiar &quot;Kate in a crate&quot; cover photo. 
</p>

<p>In more recent times, HOUNDS OF LOVE was also released in multiple versions, 
although it is the actual vinyl which differs rather than the cover. Besides the usual 
drab black vinyl, you can put the Canadian pink disc on your turntable and watch it 
swirl around or if you like, try the rather hefty-looking gray marbleized U.S. edition. 
</p>

<p>If you still need more, there is the extremely rare Interview with Kate Bush 
(EMI SPRO 282), a Canadian-only promo, again from the HOUNDS OF LOVE era. 
You might also hunt for the ultra-limited-edition HOUNDS OF LOVE promotional 
kit. This wondrous little package contains the album, a biography/discography on 
lavender paper, and three publicity photos, all deliciously wrapped in a gatefold 
sleeve tied together with, yes, a lavender ribbon. Talk about sensuous. 
</p>

<p>Finally, there's my personal favorite among 12-inch records: THE WHOLE 
STORY, Korean-style. This release has only nine tracks instead of the usual twelve 
found on other versions. The three tunes omitted are Army Dreamers, Breathing 
and Experiment IV -- all songs that cast the military in an unfavorable light. 
</p>



<p>Come Across the Bridge 
</p>

<p>The French writer Albert Camus once said of the great Franz Kafka &quot;[his] whole 
art consists in forcing the reader to reread.&quot; While Kate is no Kafka, the statement 
nevertheless applies to her music. Repeated &quot;readings&quot; are absolutely essential to 
fully appreciate the musical intricacies and lyrical depth of her songs. As is evident, 
she spends much time painstakingly crafting each song, infusing it with her rare and 
precise passion. To paraphrase Francis Bacon, Kate's albums are among the few 
which should be &quot;chewed and digested.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The purpose of this feature is to stimulate an interest in Kate Bush. Not just in 
her collectibility, but in her music as well. I have found by personal experience that 
knowing Kate eventually translates into collecting Kate. Alas, her creative output is 
far too intriguing and far too wide in scope to be covered adequately in one story. 
Her ground-breaking videos, which I scarcely mentioned, are the culmination of all 
her abilities and would demand a thorough examination of their own. The same goes 
for her backup work on other artist's records, her songs on movie soundtracks, and 
especially the marvelous non-album tracks found on the B-side of her later singles. 
In addition, as you might expect there is a vast amount of unauthorized Kate Bush 
material, ranging from interview picture discs to live albums of seemingly every 
concert stop on the tour. I leave all of the above for the adventuresome reader to 
pursue and discover. 
</p>

<p>I would like to thank Mike Murchison, Kate Bush collector extraordinaire, for 
allowing me to ramble through his brain and his collection. Also, this could not have 
been written without reference materials, so for further reading, I suggest Kate 
Bush Complete (International Music Publications, 1987); Kate Bush: A Visual 
Documentary, by Cann and Mayes (Omnibus Press, 1988); and any issue of 
Homeground, the official Kate Bush fanzine. Special thanks to EMI. 
</p>

<p>Finally, I am grateful to whomever fixed it so that out of all the eons that have 
gone and all that are yet to come, I could share a few decades with Kate Bush. 
</p>

</p>



<p>March 1990, DISCoveries 
</p>

<p> A KATE BUSH EPILOG 
</p>

<p>Thank you for the elegant treatment of my Kate Bush feature. I am certain it 
could not have been presented any better. The appearance of the layout definitely 
enhanced the subject matter of the article. 
</p>

<p>A couple of things apparently slipped through our mutual final proofing and I 
have attempted to now set the record straight. 
</p>

<p>I have recently come accross two very nice collectibles from The Sensual World, 
Kate's current album. The first is cassette versions of the album, as well as a booklet 
containing the lyrics, a biography, and some terrific photos. The second is a 
Canadian picture CD (C2 93078) of the album, although the picture is actually a 
close-up from the picture sleeve of The Sensual World single. 
</p>

<p>As sometimes can happen, a couple of errors slipped into the works. In the 
Lionheart section, a sentence in the next to last paragraph should have read: &quot;In 
various polls of January 1979, she was named the No. 1 New Artist, the No. 2 Female 
Artist, and the No. 2 Female Sex Object.&quot; Only the latter made it to print. My 
intentions were to most definitely not to portray her great accomplishments of 1978 
as solely the result of her physical appearance. As I hope I made clear, Kate is much 
more than just a pretty face. 
</p>

<p>In the collectibles section, I referred to an Italian interview picture disc. At the 
time I wrote the article I thought it to be an authentic release, as it carries an EMI 
logo and catalog number. I have since learned that it may be in fact an unauthorized 
release. I am honestly not sure which it is. If it is an unauthorized disc, I apologize 
for any confusion. 
</p>

<p>In addition, when discussing the Korean release of The Whole Story I mentioned 
the exclusion of three tracks which appear on the U.K. and U.S. versions. One of 
these, Breathing, was indeed on the album; it was actually The Dreaming which was 
omitted. The Korean Ministry of Culture and Infor-mation (which &quot;approved&quot; the 
album) apparently felt the anti-government sentiments expressed in the song, even 
though directed towards Australia, were dangerous. Why then did Breathing, 
essentially and anti-war song, make it? A glance at the wonderous little Korean lyric 
insert accompanying the album may reveal why. Kate wrote and sang: &quot;We've lost 
our chance, we're the first and last, after the blast/Chips of Plutonium are 
twinkling in every lung.&quot; The lyric sheet reads as follows: &quot;We've lost our charms, 
we're the first and last, oh, oh, off to get lost/Shipshape and toney, oh that twinkling 
in every lung.&quot; (You think something might have been lost in the translation?) 
</p>

<p>Speaking of The Dreaming, the authentic-sounding Australian music was 
achieved in part by having an authentic Australian, Rolf Harris, play his digeridu on 
the track. I mention this because of the recent printing of the lyrics to Tie Me 
Kangaroo Down, Sport in the January issue. The lyrics are basically accurate, 
although I don't believe anyone would win a spelling bee if &quot;digeridu&quot; was on the 
list. Kate's liner notes spell it as above, the letter-writer, Eric Schenider, however, 
prefers &quot;diggerie doo,&quot; while the sheet music of the songs likes &quot;didgeridoo.&quot; Also, 
it's abos [as already pointed out in the Mailbox], not elbows in the lyrics. 
</p>

<p>One final word: I wish to again express my appreciation to DISCoveries for the 
excellent treatment my story on Kate received. Thank you to all concerned.

Subject: Music Collector September 1990 by Mike Day 
</p>



<p>The September 1990 issue of the British magazine Music Collector has an article 
about Kate. The author could have used a better proofreader, but here it is: 
</p>



<p>KATE BUSH -- The High Poetess of Rock 
</p>

<p>By Mike Day 
</p>



<p>I have noticed him seven times or more <br>
But he has not seen me. <br>
He may have seen a girl called by <br>
My name --<br>
But neither he, nor anyone else will <br>
Ever really see me. 
</p>



<p> A shy, quiet, introverted girl called Catherine Bush wrote these lines for her 
school magazine. Years later, they still illustrate the mystery, the enigma and the 
magic which surrounds Kate Bush. 
</p>

<p>After twelve years of recording success, she continues to fly in the face of 
tradition, constantly setting her own standards and making her own rules. Despite 
her highly photogenic looks, this is one pop superstar who'd be insulted to be seen 
as a pin-up. Naive young Catherine has become mature Kate. Deep, committed and 
intense about her work, she's a serious musician who also exudes charisma and sex 
appeal but with Kate Bush the music definitely comes first. Perhaps that's why she 
still appears distant -- even threatening -- to journalists and media people who seek 
to discover the REAL Kate Bush. 
</p>



<p>MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS 
</p>

<p>Born on July 30th 1958 at Bexleyheath Maternity Hospital in South East London to 
wealthy parents who were easy-going, openminded and musical. Her father, a doctor 
by profession, was also a keen pianist who constantly filled the house with music. 
Both brothers played in local folk groups and mother had been an Irish folk dancer. 
This all helped to make their home, East Wickham Farm, a happy and contented 
place. Kate even had her own den in the house where she'd spend hours on her 
own or with a select group of friends. The time was spent writng poetry, painting 
butterflies on the walls, and sitting by an open fire toasting marshmellows. This was 
the private world of Kate Bush; a world often misunderstood by her school-friends, 
who thought a loner. Certainly her school days weren't happy ones. She found it 
hard to relax in the traditional surroundings of St. Joseph's Convent Grammar 
School, which she described as a cruel environment where she learnt to get hurt, but 
also learnt to cope with it. She achieved that largely through writing, pouring out 
her deepest pent-up emotions onto powerful, stark poetry. There was also her 
music. 
</p>

<p>From the age of twelve, Kate had been recoding songs at home on her brother's 
tape recorder, and later, a friend of the family who worked in the music business 
played some of them to Pink Floyd's singer and guitarist Dave Gilmour. He was so 
impressed that he paid for her to make some professional demos, and lost no time 
playing them for EMI's Bob Mercer. The company were impressed enough to sign 
her up, but they didn't launch her recording career immediately because they felt 
she was too immature; instead she gained experience by gigging in South London 
pubs with brother Paddy and future boyfriend Del Palmer. Their band was called 
appropriately enough, the K.T. Bush Band. Around this time, Kate was also given 
mime and dance lessons by the legendary Lindsay Kemp, whose past work included 
the Rocky Horror Picture Show [first I've heard of this --Ed], as well as providing 
an early spark to the imagination of the youthful David Bowie. 
</p>

<p>Those early dance sessions certainly had a lasting effect on Kate, making her very 
aware of music's potential as a visual medium. It's worth noting that without Dave 
Gilmour's perserverance and position of influence, the world might never have 
heard of Kate Bush. On her first album, he is credited with much thanks and love 
for 'rolling the ball' in the beginning, but for the record-buying public, the 
beginning came with one haunting single which possessed the airwaves in February 
1978. 
</p>

<p>Written on the night of a full moon, the eerie and ethereal &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; 
had been inspired by Emily Bronte's classic novel of that title. This was three 
minutes of Pop magic that grabbed the hearts of some listeners -- whilst others 
couldn't believe what they were hearing and couldn't bear to listen to it! 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; certainly was a love or hate it record. .. . the wailing, freakish 
vocals caused some critics to dismiss 19 year old Kate as a one-hit wonder. One music 
reviewer categorised her voice as a cross between Linda Lewis and Macbeth's three 
witches! Even John Peel proclaimed that he couldn't take her seriously. 
</p>



<p>LIONHEART 
</p>

<p>Yet &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was a bold and totally original single which was only 
released because Kate insisted on it. A number of EMI executives had felt that it 
wasn't commercial enought. Ironically, twelve years on, it remains her only No. 1 hit, 
and if not her best song, it's undoubtedly her best-known. Interestingly, battles over 
commercialism and marketing were to become a regular occurrence between Kate 
and her record company, but they were always resolved peacefully, usually with the 
singer getting her way! A typical example came with the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; single. 
EMI wanted the picture cover to carry a snap of her wearing a thin cotton vest, with 
breasts clearly defined. She vetoed this, but EMI used the photos on posters which 
appeared on buses and billboards all over London. Despite the continued efforts to 
be promoted for her music rather than her looks, Kate has always endeavoured to 
use her image imaginatively and creatively in her promotional videos. She turned a 
few heads on her debut Top Of The Pops appearance, with her eye-catching shaggy 
long hair, and multi-coloured outfit. Looking back later, Kate described her first TV 
appearance as bloody awful.. .. millions of viewers disagreed! 
</p>

<p>Both &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and Kate's first album, The Kick Inside, featured a 
kite image designed by Kate, but when the album received a poor response in the 
States, EMI again pushed her image to the fore, by completely revamping the LP 
cover for the American market. The Kick Inside was relaunched with a cover photo 
of Kate looking provocative, wearing knee length red socks and patched jeans. The 
back of the album, however was identical to the British release, with the song lyrics 
and kite motif printed over an angry-looking countryside skyline. The US version of 
The Kick Inside is still available on import. [Note this is a British magazine -- Ed] 
(In later years, Kate and her family gained much more control over her product by 
setting up her own management company which licensed her work to EMI.) 
</p>

<p>Aside from its visual merits, the musical content of The Kick Inside was 
particularly strong and innovative for a debut album. Produced by Andrew Powell, it 
featured early Bush compositions such as &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes,&quot; 
the lyrics of which she'd written on the walls of her room at East Wickham farm, at 
the age of fourteen. Bearing in mind her tender years, the LP's songs were lyrically 
daring, obsessed with weird images, mysterious forces and sensual feelings. 
</p>

<p>The Kick Inside peaked at No. 3 in the British LP charts in April 1978, and her 
follow-up album Lionheart (also a top-tenner) was relatively easy to put together, 
because when it came to material, Kate was spoilt for choice. During the past few 
years she'd written some two hundred songs, and with the confidence gleaned from 
her initial success, she was influencing the production on her records much more. 
Lionheart, released in Autumn 1978, has been described by various critics as a very 
English album -- in fact Kate's often been called a very English artist -- but on this 
album she's anything but a traditional English rose. A Leo by starsign, Kate Bush 
the Lionheart adorns the cover wearing a pantomine lion's skin and sitting on top of 
a case in an attic. The album includes an ironic anthem to her home country, &quot;Oh 
England My Lionheart&quot;, a bizarre theatrical song &quot;Hammer Horror,&quot; (which on its 
single release missed the Top 40 due to limited airplay); and also a bold kick in the 
teeth for the media with &quot;Wow&quot;. Kate has always disliked being interviewed, 
especially about her personaly life, and despite her new-found success, she'd been 
very hurt by some of the negative things which had been written about her. In 
interviews, she developed a habit of over-using superlatives, especially &quot;amazing,&quot; 
and one paper derided her by claiming that if they'd had a good night out, at EMI, 
they'd never say it was amazing -- they'd just say Yes I had a Kate Bush! 
</p>

<p>In &quot;Wow&quot; she poured all the superlatives into the lyrics of one song, and made it 
to the Top 20 -- the best possible way of hitting back at her critics. However, one 
aspect of Kate's work which definitely won critical acclaim was her live 
performances. Reviews for her stage shows at the end of the seventies were 
positively ecstatic. Her first UK tour featured eccentric, unique and stunning sets. 
The stage was filled with a gigantic kite-shaped circular screen, used as a backdrop 
for films and slides, and Kate made no less than seventeen costume changes per 
show! There's no doubt the audience were impressed -- the ambitious visual effects 
and non-stop all-action dance routines combined music, art, theatre and dance in a 
way that left its audience spellbound. Melody Maker 's Mike Davis was sufficiently 
moved to call it the most magnificent spectacle he'd ever encountered in the world 
of Rock! Kate finished that tour totally exhausted after 28 two and a half hour shows 
in Britain and Europe. She was so drained both mentally and physically that she's 
resisted touring ever since. 
</p>



<p>BREATHING 
</p>

<p>Record-wise though, the hits continued unabated. In Autumn '79 the live Kate 
Bush On Stage EP reached the Top Ten, and the uncommercial but brave single 
release &quot;Breathing&quot; reached No. 16 in Spring 1980, even though it tackled the subject 
of nuclear war. The lyrics describe a baby which will die inside its mother's womb, 
due to nuclear contamination; part of the video showed a nuclear explosion which 
the BBC refused to screen on Top Of The Pops. Kate described &quot;Breathing&quot; as her 
little symphony, the most ambitious song she'd ever done, and in later years, 
Greenpeace included it on an anti-nuclear album. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; were other single successes from the 1980 
album Never For Ever, which Kate co-produced. The cover shows a host of 
monster-like creatures falling out of her skirt and the back shows a collection of 
bats -- certainly keeping up the Kate Bush tradition of eccentricity! Dedicated to 
Kate's lighting engineer Bill Duffield, who was killed in an accident on the first 
night of her tour, the album quickly went gold and achieved two landmarks for Kate; 
as well as being her first No. 1 LP, it was also the first ever chart-topping album by a 
British female solo star. 
</p>

<p>A genuine Christmas release, the single &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot; 
sustained her success, but Kate Bush was becoming increasingly restless. Her next 
album would see her strike out in an entirely different direction, but to achieve 
creative fulfilment she came close to committing commercial suicide. She was now 
working in her own home studio [no, not until Hounds of Love -- Ed] and producing 
herself. She'd also been inspired by recording with Peter Gabriel (she sang backing 
vocals on his 1980 hit &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and would later record a duet with 
him). Press rumours abounded that Gabriel and Bush were lovers, but Kate always 
denied the gossip, insisting they were just good friends. [Gabriel denied it also. -- 
Ed] 
</p>

<p>Getting back to Kate's new-found ideas, the intense driving beat of &quot;Sat In Your 
Lap&quot; (No. 11 in Summer '81) was only a foretaste of what was to come. DJs, reviwers, 
and fans weren't quite sure what to make of this new harder sounding Kate Bush. 
The emotions and moods she created were as evocative as ever, but this was raw, 
daring music with a cutting edge, and the ensuing album, The Dreaming, left many 
people baffled. Despite being Kate's most adventurous, ambitious and intelligent 
work to date, initially it was only appreciated by serious music critics and die-hard 
fans. The title track dealt with the plight of the Australian Aboriginals, who'd been 
pushed out of their land by white men. Another track, &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;, detailed 
the ordeal of a Vietcong guerilla preparing to kill a white victim. 
</p>

<p>Kate Bush was proud of this album. She was giving full reign to her imagination 
and creative abilities, whilst stretching her music to new boundaries and new levels 
of advanced production. EMI on the other hand, were dismayed! 
</p>

<p>After the single &quot;The Dreaming&quot; peaked at the dizzy height of No. 48 in the 
chart, they didn't even bother to plug the next release, &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;. 
Consequently it didn't go anywhere and became Kate's first single to miss the 
charts completely. At this time rumours abounded that EMI were about to ditch the 
girl whom they'd greeted with so much enthusiasm a few years earlier. These 
rumours intensified when all her previous singles were released together in one 
collection. Surely there was an air of finality to this, asked the music press? 
</p>

<p>Kate responded typically, by retreating to her private world, the world which had 
inspired her so many times before. With the help of boyfriend Del Palmer, she 
upgraded her small studio in the old barn of her parents' house. It was there that 
she fashioned a quite superb come-back. 
</p>



<p>DEAL WITH GOD 
</p>

<p>In 1985, Kate's new album Hounds Of Love came straight into the album chart at 
No. 1. Combining the depth of production skills exhibited on The Dreaming with a 
hard (but more commercial) edge to most tracks. The first single to be lifted from 
the LP, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, gave Kate her biggest hit since &quot;Wuthering 
Heights&quot;, peaked at No. 3. Even now though, her instincts wer to take a risk. 
Wanting to call the song &quot;Deal With God&quot;, she was persuaded not to by EMI 
executives, who claimed that this would be the kiss of death to the single, denying it 
airplay. For once, Kate relented. 
</p>

<p>The next single from Hounds of Love, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, gave her a vehicle for what 
she later described as her favourite video. Featuring actor Donald Sutherland, it told 
the story of a boy and his father who used a machine to create rain. The authorities 
heard of this, and arrested the father. Directed sympathetically by Kate [wrong -- 
Ed], the &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; video was a masterful production, illustrating sadness and 
depth of emotion through a child's eyes. Kate played the part of the boy in the video. 
She appeared to have short hair but this was an illusion; her hairdresser designed a 
special wig for her to wear. 
</p>

<p>1986 was a good year for Kate with three more chart entries, &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; 
(the LP's title track); &quot;The Big Sky&quot;; and &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, whilst at the end of the 
year, the compilation album The Whole Story topped the LP charts, and has since 
gone one to sell a million copies. Containing the best of her hits and near misses, this 
was a master stroke of marketing by EMI, the kind of album that many people 
bought at Christmas as a gift. The gatefold sleeve opens out to show cover pictures of 
all Kate's singles and albums, a variety of photos taken at different stages of her 
career, and a close-up of Kate looking wistful and demure against a white backdrop. 
The album succeeded in breaking her in the United States, a territory which up to 
then had resisted her talents. [I'd say what broke her here (if she can be called 
broken) was Hounds Of Love, which peaked at No. 30, rather than The Whole 
Story, which peaked in the 70s. It's true that TWS introduced a lot more people to 
her older stuff than had heard it before. -- Ed] It also featured a completely new 
recording of the debut hit, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. 
</p>

<p>Despite the adventurous (not to say weird) subject matter which she writes about 
in many of her songs, Kate Bush herself is a quiet, reserved and remarkably 
well-adjusted woman. By all accounts, her fame hasn't changed her. Indeed, she's 
probably more laid-back about the music business now than at any time during her 
career. The press have made their usual attempts to drag up negative aspects of her 
personality, but they've encountered little joy because Kate appears to have very 
few vices, although she admits to being a heavy smoker and has a passion for 
chocolate. Luckily her hobbies of dancing and running help keep her fit. She also 
loves gardening and is a vegetarian. Other miscellaneous likes include science-fiction 
books (not surprising when you consider the mystical quality of much of her work); 
television and cinema; cats; and folk music. Her favourite recording stars have 
mainstream appeal; The Beatles, David Bowie, Elton John, Steely Dan, and the 
aforementioned Peter Gabriel. Her pet hates include flying and reading books about 
herself! One book she did make an appearance in was Patrick Lichfield's collection 
of the World's Most Beautiful Women. 
</p>

<p>For determined collectors, there are a number of Kate Bush &quot;bootlegs&quot; available, 
although the quality of sound reproduction tends to be weak. The first Kate Bush 
bootleg to be marketed was Wow, a double album of Kate at The Hammersmith 
Odeon, combined with recordings from her first TV special, broadcast in 1979. Other 
notables include Secret Message, a Japanese flexidisc including messges from Kate 
and her brother John; Bush -- The Early Years, a rare and highly collectable German 
recording of her early demos; and What Katie Did For Amnesty International, a live 
recording of Kate and Dave Gilmour at the Amnesty fundraiser, The Secret 
Policeman's Other Ball, 1987. [Actually, it was The Secret Policeman's *Third* Ball. 
-- Ed] Her best-selling videos include Kate Bush -- The Whole Story, The Singles 
File [sic]; and Kate Bush Live At The Hammersmith Odeon, footage of a concert 
recorded in May 1979. There are a variety of fanzines available on Kate and the 
address of her fan club is P.O. Box 120, Welling, Kent, DA16 3DS. 
</p>



<p>THE STORY SO FAR 
</p>

<p>The end of the eighties saw Kate Bush, now in her early thirties, releasing her 
seventh album, The Sensual World. She described it as her most feminine yet, and 
when compared to say, Hounds Of Love, it's certainly a more relaxed but perhaps 
less striking collection. Having said that, the title track (lifted as the first single) 
made the top ten, notable for its infuriating catchy rhythm, based apparently on the 
literary style of James Joyce. A song written for the John Hughes (director of The 
Breakfast Club ) film This Woman's Work [Hold on here! That was the name of 
the *song*! The movie was She's Having A Baby. Maybe the reason the writer got 
this so egregiously wrong is that the movie was never released in Britain! -- Ed], 
unfortunately got swamped in the pre-Christmas market, and ended up as only a 
minor hit. 
</p>

<p>The Sensual World album also sees a new departure for Kate: the use of the 
Bulgarian acapella folk group, Trio Bulgarka but lyrically, the most ambitious track 
has to be &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;. 
</p>

<p>As we enter the nineties, Kate Bush's records appear increasingly out on a limb. 
Although she's always enjoyed a cult following, her current recordings are in 
competition with a youth-dominated world of House, Rap and Hip-Hop sounds. It'll 
be interesting to see if the deep, thoughtful and highly polished music which she 
records can sustain its success as the decade continues. With Kate Bush, you're 
never quite sure what's coming next! Whenever people have written her off in the 
past, she's hit back with her boldest and most adventurous work. With twelve years 
of recording success under her belt, Kate has emerged from the depths of 
middle-class Essex [ESSEX?? Everybody knows she's from Kent! -- Ed] to a unique 
status in terms of critical acclaim and respect within the music industry. Very few 
artists could go as long as her between album releases, only to see their work come 
straight back to the top again and again. She's consistently topped even her own 
high standards, and for that reason alone, you can't help thinking that Kate Bush, 
The Whole Story is incomplete. The best is yet to come!
