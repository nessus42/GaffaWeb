<BR> Subject: Re: Jon Drukman's theories L&amp;A 
</P>
<P>&gt; I disagree, Jon. This could possibly be a &quot;Teen Suicide: Don't Do
It&quot; song.  Consider the lines &quot;What would we do without you?&quot; &quot;You
might not think so now  ... someone will come to help you.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I don't really see much support of that theory. The chorus, which presumably
 contains the &quot;kernel&quot; of the song (as it is repeated a lot) says: &quot;Take
away the love  and the anger, and the little piece of rope (hope) holding us
together...&quot; which says  to me that to &quot;let go of these feelings&quot;
is the end of the relationship, because you  gotta have LOVE and ANGER to have a
vital relationship. Once the strong emotions  are gone (even if they are
negative, such as anger), then you just don't care about  the other person
anymore -- I had a litle chat like this with my last girlfriend. I said,  &quot;Even
if you hate me, I don't care, because it means you have a strong emotion for 
me.&quot; (OK, I'm a bit of a drip, but I was in love, so show some respect, you
clods!) 
</P>
<P>&quot;It cuts so deep that you don't think that you can speak about it.&quot;
This says to me  that we're back in Running Up That Hill land. Communication is
still a problem.  Open up! Even if you have negative feeligs, you must let them
out! (This is a  recurring theme in KT work, so I think I'm justified in
presuming it here.) 
</P>
<P>&quot;We're building a house of the future...&quot; And how can a house be
built on shaky  (not completely open) foundations? &quot;Don't think that you
can't ever change the past  and the future.&quot; Explain how you were feeling
at the time! TALK! 
</P>
<P>I read the &quot;you might not think so now&quot; lines in line with the
comments I have  made above. Don't be fooled by the appallingly happy and
oh-so-catchy music. I  think this song has much in common with RUTH...

</P>
<P>After listening to The Fog six or ten (hundred) times now, something
occurred to  me: Right after daddy says &quot;Just put your feet down child&quot;
the SECOND time, there  are seagulls mixed in. I heard it and immediately
connected it to Watching You  Without Me (where the seagulls occur in the last
30sec or so of the song, just before  KT lunges into the &quot;Talk to me Listen
to me Talk to me&quot; weirdness.) 
</P>
<P>The odd thing, though, is that they sound IDENTICAL, with a higher eq on
about  4khz (on The Fog). Any comments?

to  Kate herself as the protaganist. Usually, she keeps herself separate from
her song  personae, but here she really seems to indicate that it is *her*! Is
this not something  of a rarity among Katia? Other than songs like Them Heavy

as clear a self-reference  (indirect perhaps) as any in Kate lore. Or does

04:41:32 GMT <BR> Subject: re: &quot;The Fog&quot; 
</P>
<P>I have, however, noticed something similar. My favorite &quot;pet-peeve
concerning the  production of TSW&quot; is the high-pitched whine that
accompanies the sample of  Kate's father on &quot;The Fog.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Whenever Mr Bush speaks (and I don't mean the 'kindler and gentler' one), 
there's a very annoying high-pitched tone that begins just before the vox, and
ends  just after. I'm not IED--I can't rationalize a reason why Kate wouldn't
have  filtered this sample in order to add to the overall feeling of the song.
My guess is  that she didn't notice--it's rather high, and at her age, I'm sure
she's started losing  some of her capability to hear high frequencies. (we had
an interesting example of  this in a physics of sound class I took--the prof had
a tone generator with a pot for  the freq. adjustment. He had everybody raise
their hand, then he began to increase  the frequency, asking people to lower
their hands when they could no longer hear  the tone. As I recall, in a room of
300 ~20 yr olds, there was no one who could hear  a tone over something like
17kHz.)

<P>Does anybody have any idea what the background voices are singing in &quot;Reaching
 Out&quot; in the part right before the chorus? To me it sounds like &quot;Jahweh&quot;,
which  would fit in with the theme of the album, I suppose. Is the song about
reaching out  for religious enlightenment? 
</P>
<P>ps. Combine this with the last line of the song, &quot;Reaching out for Mama&quot;,
and we  have an allusion to Jahweh as a feminine entity. No wonder she says the
album is  essentially from a feminine perspective :-).

<BR> Subject: Reaching Out 
</P>
<P>On the consternation over &quot;Reaching Out&quot;: First time I heard this,
I could see we  had to make a choice, whether to go with this song. It helped me
when I saw that  the last name on the first line of the &quot;thank you&quot;
credits was &quot;Melanie.&quot; This is  probably some monstrous fabrication of
my ignorance (Melanie in the KB circle  probably being well known to the
informed), but I was put in mind of Melanie--the  Melanie of &quot;Lay Down, Lay
Down (Candles in the Rain),&quot; from late 60s/early 70s, and  later of &quot;Brand
New Key.&quot; Both hers and Kate's songs are what somebody called  'anthems',
girlhearted to a nearly unbearable degree, but both songs move me to 
affirmation. Rolling Stone gave &quot;Lay Down&quot; the worst, most negative
and hostile  review I had seen in months and months. I couldn't listen to it
myself till much  later, after Melanie had buffered it with the strong album &quot;Stoneground
Words.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Reaching Out&quot; is needed setup for &quot;Heads&quot;. How sweet it
is after &quot;Reaching  Out&quot; to get that kickoff into &quot;Heads&quot;...
but then, ambiguity. We need to bring in  &quot;Experiment IV&quot; here and
Kate's strong awareness of the ambiguous power of pop  music. Of her own music.

(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: Reaching Out
</P>
<P>Vickie here. 
</P>
<P>Reaching Out (IMHO) is one of the most beautiful and moving songs I have
ever  heard. It touches me emotionally, very deeply. It makes me cry. It's a &quot;mama&quot;
song  that is designed to fit with The Fog (a &quot;papa&quot;) song, the way a
puzzle piece fits  perfectly. IMHO, TF without RO is meaningless, and RO without
TF is  meaningless. They're a loving homage to her parents and what would Kate
be like  without Robert and Hannah? IMHO, it also works (as I'm sure it was
designed to)  as a metaphor for being willing to take chances, even though we
might fail at what  we are striving to accomplish. It's seeing the world from a
fearless child's point of  view. A child who loves it's mother will keep
reaching out for her love, even though  the mother may be abusive (I used to
think the entire song was about child abuse),  just as those with an unbreakable
spirit will not give up in the face of adversity. 
</P>
<P>The hesitant child-like tinkling piano notes at the beginning sent chills 
throughout my body the first time I heard it and I just knew it was going to be
a  favorite song. As it progressed and her voice got stronger and more powerful,
I can't  describe the utter astonishment I experienced at the way my body and
mind reacted  to the emotional impact of the song. I was in awe. I was crying at
the end of the song  and rarely do I listen to it now without at least blinking
back a few. 
</P>
<P>My mother died in late 1982, shortly before The Dreaming was released. I
hadn't  felt as emotionally devastated since the first time I heard All The
Love. That was a  painful song to listen to then and my heart still does a small
leap when I listen to it  now. Reaching Out was (is) a hopeful song that (for
me) soothes the pain that I still  feel at my mom's passing.

</P>
<P>Heads We're Dancing is a mystery still. Since Julian has supported my
half-assed  theory that the line is &quot;it's a picture of Hitler&quot; (a
theory I have only confided to Ed  Suranyi), then I guess we must be right.
There seems to be a line where Kate says  &quot;It was 1939 before the music
started&quot; as well. 1939, is of course, the year in which  Adolf invaded
Czechoslovakia. The rest of the song makes no sense to me yet. I  can't
understand what happens if the coin toss comes up tails. Does he annex  Poland
right away or something?

well!sommers@cogsci.berkeley.edu (William Sommers) <BR> Subject: Re: Heads
We're Dancing 
</P>
<P>Without a second's hesitation, I decided to approach this one with a literal
 interpretation: at some point KaTe ran across an anecdote or whatever that
involved  a young woman meeting Herr H., a flip of a coin and a harsh
realization the  following morning. I can confidently say that there is no basis
for said theory. I find  no reference to any such tale in a rather thorough
search of most existing tomes on  the subject. Of course I have never seen the
forged(?) diaries and I doubt She has  either, although I suppose that
possibility does exist. 
</P>
<P>(The only possible lead that remains is a reference to a certain Sigrid von
Lappus,  20, whom Herr H. is supposed to have secretly seen for some months in
1939.  Despite his relationship with Eva Braun, Herr H. is well known to have
consorted  with quite a few young women over the years. Primarily models and
actresses, there  was never any doubt as to his identity at the time. As I say,
the only unchecked  reference to a liason in 1939 appears in The Ciano Diaries,
1939-1943 by (Count)  Galeazzo Ciano (ed. by Hugh Wilson), NYC: Garden Ciy
Publishing Company, 1947.  Ciano was Mussolini's son-in-law and Italy's Foreign
Minister at the time and is  known to have spent a good deal of time with the
German leader. I'm still looking  for this... please let me know if anyone runs
across a copy!) 
</P>
<P>So much for instinct. I can, however, state one thing with confidence: 
</P>
<P>There were tens of thousands of GERMANS who had no idea what Herr H.  looked
like throughout most of WWII. For 1939, multiply that number by at least 10. 
This is not conjecture, this is fact. 
</P>
<P>Fortunately, others have already mentioned most of the reasons for this, and
I  wont rehash them here. Additionally, one needs a familiarity with various
European  cultures and the important roles geography has played in the
development of Europe  as a whole. (No condescension intended at all, folks!) As
difficult as it may be to  believe, there were areas of Germany completely
unaffected (other than material  shortages) in any manner for the entire
duration of the war. 
</P>
<P>Knowing some of your Love-Hound personalities &lt;grin&gt;, I implore you
now not to  waste your time or mine by demanding proof or credentials. I have
studied this, you  haven't. &lt;nyah-nyah...&gt;

<P>IED is not going to swear to anything yet, but he thinks there may be a
SECRET  MESSAGE in Heads We're Dancing. Listen to the first half of the song
especially,  with headphones preferably, mainly during the solo-vocal sections
when Kate is  singing verses and particularly the &quot;PCR&quot;s (Kate's term
for the &quot;pre-choral  refrains&quot;). Then tell IED that you don't hear a
very subtle whispered vocal  underneath. IED hasn't yet had a chance to really
study it, and he realizes that it  could turn out to be nothing but a whispered
echo of the main vocal line--but  perhaps it's something else. Any ideas,
anyone?

<P>KaTe has said in numerous interviews that the song was inspired by a friend
who  was at a dinner party with Oppenheimer (daddy of the Bomb). The friend and 
Oppenheimer had a nice conversation, and later, the friend asked the host who
'that  charming man' was...and was shocked and horrified to find out.

<P>Kate wanted to play with that idea, choosing the one person closest to the
Devil  himself that she could think of--Hitler.

to her  and, holding out a penny, says, &quot;Heads we're dancing.&quot;

<P>&gt; Heads We're Dancing is driving me mad. There seem to be some backing

<P> IED posted about this a few months ago. In IED's opinion this is indeed
some  kind of secret message. IED hears a couple of phrases being whispered,
v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y, during the first and second &quot;pre-choral refrains&quot;,
underneath the lead  vocal(s). The words are definitely there. Whether they are
actually different from  the main lyrics, or just a repetition of the main
lyrics, or (as you suggest, Richard)  just some nonsense syllables, is the big
question. But one thing is sure, and that is  that Kate went to some pains to
hide a whispered vocal of some kind inside the mix  of this track, and IED is

<P>In the trenches at the tail end of World War One a young soldier named 
Schneider (Brandaur) suffers a serious head injury. As he recovers he is
tormented  by visions. The Kaiser will be visiting the hospital and some of the
soldiers are told  that they will not be allowed to stand in review, due to
their injuries. This drives  another soldier over the edge. He grabs a hand
grenade and threatens to blow  everyone up. Schneider talks very softly to the
soldier, and succeeds in making the  soldier hand over the grenade. Afterwards,
the doctor describes this skill as &quot;will  transference&quot; (I suspect the
translation is kind of clunky) and proceeds to test  Schneider and finds that he
now has a variety of paranormal skills. They work on  developing these skills.
Scneider meets an old friend, who convences him to become  a professional stage
&quot;mentalist&quot; and becomes his manager. 
</P>
<P>He adopts the grander name Jan Erich Hanussen. After fairly shakey beginings
 the act comes together. A girl from Hanussen's hometown becomes his assistant, 
falling under his spell. Playing the spas around Austria and Vennia his fame
grows.  Newspapers report tales of his claims. Finally, they are ready for
Berlin, Hanussen  headlining now. Various groups wish to know various things,
mainly who will be the  new Chancellor. Badgered by reporters, Hanussen finally
says &quot;Hitler.&quot; This leads to  being courted by some of the
aristocratic members of the National Socalists.  Hanussen is apolitical but
opportunistic, and gravitates toward this new center of  power. A photographer
named Lena offers to shot a portfolio. Her work consists of  Nazi propaganda of
the &quot;new man&quot;, naked perfect Ayrans in heroic poses. Her shots  of
Hanussen are designed to emphasize his powers of mind, blazing eyes, hands 
thrust foward, looking upward, both hands, one arm, etc. A young Nazi heckels 
Hanussen, who challenges him to come on-stage. Hanussen hypnotizes the man, man 
making him crow like a rooster. Humiliated, the Nazi leaves. 
</P>
<P>He meets up again with his doctor, much older. The doctor is Jewish, and is 
afraid for his life. He urges Hanussen to emigrate to America with him. Finally 
Hanussen begins to see what will result from the Nazi rise to power, and the
effect  that this power is having on himself. He sees a paper, and the front
page photo of  Hitler looks familer. He goes upstairs and gets his portfolio. In
one of the  photographs he is in the exact same pose that Hitler is in the
paper. 
</P>
<P>---
</P>
<P> There is more but this is enough to give you the feel of the film and see
some of  the elements that I think Kate lifted for HWD. Obviously this is not
exactly the  same plot, as The Infant Kiss is from &quot;The Innocents&quot;,
but I feel has closer parallels  than Get Out Of My House has to it's
aknowledged inspiration, &quot;The Shining.&quot; Well,  I urge everyone to see
this film and make up your own minds.

<P>Why I do like &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The intro hooked me right away. It locked me into this driving, devilish
groove  that fit the song perfectly. Then the guitar came in, and I knew I would
love it.  From there, it was just pure pleasure; remember this was my first Kate
album, and  this was one of the most unique songs I had ever heard. 
</P>
<P>I still like this song a lot. The lyrics do express an interesting theme,
that the  outwardly innocuous may blossom (bad metaphor, sorry) into something
monstrous,  that what may appear to be a gentleman on the dance floor could in
fact be a demon  in formal dress. I've heard many people say they dislike HWD; I
have yet to hear  any good reasons from them to dislike it, or any reasons at
all for that matter.

is:  who is talking at the end of the song? |&gt;oug and I have been fighting
about this one. I  say that the narrator has been forcibly ripped away from the
only thing in the world  that ever gave her love and understood where she was
coming from, so she sits alone,  crying softly to herself: &quot;I hate to leave
you.&quot; |&gt;oug thinks that the computer is saying  this.

</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding seems to be about Kate (or whomever) finding (1) 
friendship and (2) knowledge through a computer. There is clear reference to
some  sort of dial-up network. As Ed Suryani pointed out to me, the choir
represents the  responses from the computer, as if it were a bunch of other
people. Others have  speculated that it's the computer itself, but I think it
makes more sense to think of  it as other users on a net. Sounds to me it could
only be about ... Love-Hounds !!!  Wow! Kate has written an obvious tribute to
*us* !!!!!!!!! :^) 
</P>
<P>Rocket's Tail is the FIRST Kate song (from *any* album) to creep under my
skin  and &quot;hook&quot; me. That's not to disparage any of her previous work.
Up 'til now, I've  been mostly impressed by her work in aggregate - the songs
all work together, and  no single one jumps out on its own from the others. But
RT is *awesome*! The  combination of Kate's voice, the Trio B., Dave G.'s
guitar, and the elusive ethnic  sound (Is it Irish with Bulgarian influences or
Bulgarian with Irish influences?) have  an effect I can only describe as &quot;searing&quot;.

<P>Similarly, there are extra words at the end of Never Be Mine (not counting
the  Trio Bulgarka's words, which presumably are in Bulgarian), and Kate (as a
high,  screaming chorus) is also definitely singing specific words in the long
Floydish  second half of Rocket's Tail, too. IED hasn't figured them out yet,
but they're  there--and the important thing is that none of these extra lyrics
is included in the  lyric sheet.

<P>About the &quot;seKreT&quot; message at the end of Deeper Understanding
(and, not  surprisingly, to disagree with !&gt;oug on this point): Kate sings &quot;I
hate to leave you&quot;  several times, but the last time the word &quot;leave&quot;
turns into &quot;lose&quot; at the very end.  !&gt;oug's idea seems wrong to IED
because the &quot;lose you&quot; line begins with exactly the  same &quot;h&quot;
sound (in the &quot;hate&quot;) as the previous lines. The only difference comes
in  the &quot;leave&quot; sound. 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Two more &quot;seKreTs&quot; in Deeper Understanding : Have you
noticed the two  whispered &quot;Hello!&quot;s ? Keep an ear out for them. And
have you heard the &quot;early  birds&quot;--i.e., not the birds at the end of
the song, but their pre-figuration earlier in  the track--?

<P>As best as I can recall, the addition of the protaganist to her computer is

<P>Here's an off-the-wall thought that I had while listening to the ending of  &quot;Deeper
Understanding&quot;: suppose that &quot;I hate to leave you&quot; is spoken by
KT as she  resumes a &quot;normal&quot; life, that doesn't include her computer
friend. Perhaps it's a  romance that has taken her attention away. As I was
contemplating this, &quot;Between a  Man and a Woman&quot; started, and suddenly
I began to imagine that the song is sung to  the computer, now jealously trying
to interfere with the romance that has taken KT  from it. 
</P>
<P>Before y'all tear me apart on this, let me say that I don't think there's
anything  in &quot;Between...&quot; that supports this interpretation; I just
found it an interesting idea.

</P>
<P>Let's see: to me, if Kate was unable to remove herself from her computer and
 her family was forced to do so, it could be a warning about the seductiveness
of  technology. 
</P>
<P>I personally see the song as a conflict between technology and humanity. &quot;When
 the people here grow colder...&quot; =&gt; as technology becomes a larger and
larger part of  human life, we become more and more like it (ie. colder). So in
effect, turning to  her computer is *just as good* as turning to another human
since we are are  becoming just like them in many aspects. 
</P>
<P>This, I think, is the crux of the song: that technology, for all its
greatness and  usefulness, is dangerous. My mother is always complaining about &quot;how
all you  engineers don't know how to think, love and communicate!&quot; While
this is an  exagerration, it parallels what Kate seems to be saying in &quot;Deeper
Understanding&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&gt; It wouldn't really say anything. In the other two interpretations, it
has the nice  meaning that everyone needs an emotionaly crutch every now and
then, but  eventually you have to grow up again and stand on your own two feet.

</P>
<P>The trouble with this, Doug, is that most people who develop a need for an 
emotional crutch and find one usually *don't* know when they no longer need it 
and do not leave of their own accord. That is why I feel that the &quot;I hate
to leave  you...&quot; chorus is actually Kate singing to her computer as her
family takes her away,  or whenever she leaves her terminal. The computer saying
goodbye is not very  viable in my mind...especially if one takes the tech vs.
humanity route, for the  program would not make Kate leave, even if it did know
that Kate no longer needed  it.

<P>Subject: Re: Deeper Understanding 
</P>
<P>One other point: the protagonist is repeatedly referered to as &quot;she&quot;
by everyone.  There is absolutely no evidence for this assumption and is
actually quite unlikely.  The pathological phenomenon described in the song is
almost exclusively in the male  domain. In addition to my own observations I
offer the interesting article in Omni of  about a year ago which covered this
topic. (Not at hand right now.) 
</P>
<P>Finally, I propose the final lines are a lament FROM the computer not for
it.  After all, it does have a &quot;voice console&quot; we are told. The voice
used by Kate is also  different from the rest of the song. Even my Amiga greets
me at bootup with a  perfectly digitized voice of HAL from 2001 proclaiming: &quot;I'm
completely operational  and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.&quot;

<BR> Subject: Between a Computer and Melody Maker 
</P>
<P>At one point in the discussion that Kate had with the Melody Maker, She
says,  &quot;the idea was that the verses were the person and the choruses were
the computer  talking to the person.&quot; I think this pretty much eliminates
any possibility that the  computer &quot;hates to leave&quot; Kate. 
</P>
<P>I posted earlier a little spiel on this song, but it got eaten (it was real
weird, but  somehow it got sent to our sysadmin who *might* have forwarded it to
|&gt;oug -  maybe..). 
</P>
<P>Anyways, I see the song &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; as a conflict
between humanity  and technology. &quot;When the people her grow colder/ I turn
to my computer.&quot; This is  Real Scary because it implies (to me anyways) a
few things: 
</P>
<P>- The advent of technology is having adverse effects on humanity. This is
not  explicitly stated in the song, but I get the feeling that comp- uters, etc.
could very  well be the reason for humanity to grow colder. My mother summed
this up nicely  when she said, &quot;All you students going to technological
schools are taught incredible  things, but you never learn to communicate, to
feel or to love!&quot; Harsh and a bit  stereotypical, but in some cases very
true. 
</P>
<P>- Technology is getting to the point where it could be feasible for it to
replace  humanity, as it did in this song (go read alt.cyberpunk for an update).
I find this  incredibly frightening - how could anything a machine replace the
warmth, love and  being of another human? However, it did happen here...this was
sorta addressed in  last night Star Trek (&quot;Booby Trap&quot;), where Giordi
more or less falls in love with a  holodeck construct that he was using to help
solve an engineering problem. 
</P>
<P>Lastly, how to interpret the &quot;I hate to leave you&quot; lines. As I
might have said  before, I see it as Kate, who is *still* addicted to the
computer, saying to the  computer that she hates to leave it. As I stated, it
can not be the computer since it is  Kate singing those lines, but I don't
believe that she has realized her addiction and  is removing herself, even
though she hates to do so. An addiction or emotional  crutch, in most cases, is
so blinding that one does not see what is happening. I highly  doubt that
someone who has developed an addiction to her personal conputer to the  point
where she &quot;is lonely [and] lost without her little black box&quot; would
realize such. 
</P>
<P>Note: most of this coalesed before I read the Melody Maker interview. After 
reading it, we see that Kate states that computers could provide another source
of  information about ourselves, &quot;because they could come in from outside
all this.&quot; She  goes on to talk about the mechanical nature of Nature and
how a computer might be  able to help us to go &quot;through all that
science..to something very spiritual but very  earthy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I'm not really sure where she is going with this, and in fact, Kate states
that  she's not really sure what she's saying, but I imagine it *might* lead
somewhere  (maybe we should refer *Kate* to alt.cyberpunk!). Anybody care to
take this  farther?

<P>when i first read the lyrics of d.u. as posted here a month ago, i went
running to  my local hounds-pals waving them and saying &quot;see? see? she
understands me!!!&quot;  because i'm fanatic in my belief that computers can
teach us to understand  ourselves... but they laughed and said, &quot;no, she's
making fun of tech-nerds&quot; and i  could only lamely claim &quot;well, i bet
at least it's ambiguous&quot;... 
</P>
<P>so my weekend was made-in-spades when i saw the mm-interview quotes-- kt is 
god and kt is the prophet too! 
</P>
<P>as i read it, and maybe i'm projecting but you'll have to prove it to me,
the  spiritual lesson of computers can arise from their ability to simulate
human  behavior-- like in turkle's &quot;second self&quot;, we are learning to
see ourselves in new  ways because the computer provides a perfectly objective
mirror-- we use computer  terms like &quot;pop my stack&quot; or &quot;hard-wired&quot;
to describe our own behavior (i wish i  had my list with me of more-impressive
examples of this). too, think of wizardry  and its little simulated characters,
or ultima, or balance of power, or chris crawford's  new &quot;trust and
betrayal&quot;... as our ability to create game-characters that act human 
improves, we will be forced to consider who we are and why we feel and act as we
 do... 
</P>
<P>kate says &quot;I think... a lot of the things that we do are very
mechanical...&quot; this  teaching goes back to gurdjieff (anyone know how
serious her involvement was  there? i just saw the gurdjieff bio-pic &quot;mtgs
w/remarkable men&quot; and thought the  dancing at the end was strangely
familiar)... if we want to escape from our  mechanical habit patterns we have to
learn to observe them, and computers offer  new metaphors and are totally free
of selfish dis-tortions... (kate: &quot;I do feel that, in  some ways, computers
could take us into a level of looking at ourselves that we've  never seen
before, because they could come in from outside all this...&quot;) 
</P>
<P>i am lucky enough to be working at an artificial intelligence research
center--  the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern Univ.--where
the very best  thinkers on these subjects are concentrated. The ILS is headed by
Roger Schank  whose breakthrough book is called &quot;Scripts, Plans, Goals and
Understanding&quot;-- he  tries to establish a basic vocabulary of human acts
and use it to teach a computer to  be able to read ordinary english and answer
questions about what it's read. 
</P>
<P>we also have Andrew Ortony who has just published the first &quot;computationally
 tractable&quot; theory of emotions: &quot;The Cognitive Structure of Emotions&quot;.

</P>
<P>That KT is intuitively aware of this totally blows my mind and confirms what
we  all believe (k.b.i.g.)-- it's a point of view that is so new that almost
nothing has been  written on it (i.e. spiritual implications of a.i.) 
</P>
<P>so do i go too far? ...tell me!

soundedit, my guess is they're... clueless? 
</P>
<P>They certainly don't sound like american touchtone beeps (which i would
guess  probably are a global standard). 
</P>
<P>ps- i borrowed a co-worker's cd-walkman last friday and left TD in it (on 
purpose) when i returned it. bingo-- another convert! (he's a musician, they're 
sitting ducks!)

<P>They are not Touch-Tone tones. Touch-Tones, as you may know, consist of a 
distinct pair of pitches (a two-note chord). The sound in the song is a sequence
of  alternating pitches followed by a longer high pitch. The tones themselves
appear to  be sine waves but are not the FM tones used in modem transmission. In
fact, they  seem to be a nice, musical Minor Third apart (can anyone with a
better ear than I  confirm this). 
</P>
<P>Since you can make such a sound in any modern studio in about two minutes of
 synthesizer programming, I suspect that Kate simply created it on the spot.

<P>Between A Man and a Woman -- Yeah! There is another vocal line in there! On 
headphones you can hear it panning back and forth from left to right, during the
 louder parts of the song. Whether or not they are actually words though...
Well,  given her previous tricks, I'd guess there might be a message in there.

<P>Will now mean you and here.&quot;

<P>At first I thought she must have meant to write &quot;you ARE here&quot;,

guess that she means 
</P>
<P>&quot;Will now mean 'you' and 'here'&quot; 
</P>
<P>as in &quot;the burning fields remind me of both you and this place.&quot;

</P>
<P>I think &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; is one of the outstanding songs on &quot;The
Sensual World&quot;  (I think there are about 11 -- and you may think what you
like :-)). 
</P>
<P>This song takes a wonderful idea and expresses it beautifully. For me this
song  conjurs up a lot of imagery...specifically the &quot;setting fire to the
cornfields&quot; verse.  Any ideas on what this might be referring to? To me it
conjures up images of the  American Civil War but perhaps there is a more
obvious reference that I'm not  aware of. Maybe something closer to home (for
Kate anyway).

<P>No, the burning fields in the song refer to the practice of many farmers of 
burning the remains of their fields in the autumn in order to fertilze the soil
and  prepare it for the next year's crop.

<P>I really think Rocket's Tail is about suicide. The opening a-capella bits
feature  lines where Kate talks about dressing up like a rocket, standing on the
edge of a  bridge, and plunging into the night. Sadly, once all the raucous
guitar stuff starts, I  can't understand a word she says, except for the
unbelievably soulful cries of &quot;Take  a little fire!&quot; which is a
terribly ambiguous phrase...

<P>Thanks to Steve Wallis for posting the Radio One interview...or so far at
least the  first part of it. 
</P>
<P>In that interview Kate talks about Rocket's Tail, a truely awesome piece of 
work... 
</P>
<P>It sounds like Kate isn't entirely comfortable talking about this song. I
can only  imagine that this means something to her personally. 
</P>
<P>Could it be about Kate's feelings about her own fame? Once every three years
or  so she launches herself into the public view once again. Fame can be so
wonderful  but at the same time it can be a very lonely thing. 
</P>
<P>At the beginning of the song its almost as though she's telling someone else
 (perhaps one of her collaboraters, Gilmore or Gabriel?) that they must be crazy
to go  on this rocket ride, it may be great for a short time but you can also
end up burnt  out and alone. 
</P>
<P>And then Kate knocks us out with the irony, she's about to take that rocket
ride  again herself. But she tells us in the interview that it's alright now,
she can live life  for the moment and enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>I've just started working on this idea but I think it may be worth
consideration.

well!sommers@cogsci.berkeley.edu (William Sommers) <BR> Subject: Re: Rocket's
Tail 
</P>
<P>Keeping in mind that most of this was developed prior to my reading the NME 
transcription IED posted here, I submit my musings on RT : 
</P>
<P>KaTe wants to write a piece around The Trio Bulgarka, rather than vice
versa.  There is no vision, no sudden inspiration on Her part; She is actively
searching for a  theme. &lt;just bear with the imagery&gt; Late one November
evening, sitting with Her  knees tucked to Her chest, Her chin resting on Her
crossed forearms, Her mind  adrift, She espies Rocket, who is staring upwards
out of a window. With an almost  audible click, things begin to fall in place.
Rocket, a rocket, tail, fire, power,  soar--The Trio Bulgarka are certainly
capable of expressing searing emotional  imagery. 
</P>
<P>The lyrics are as straightforward as anything She has ever written. The
lyrics are  also pretty much irrelevant, and serve only to form images &lt;KT
appears to confirm  this in NME&gt;. What remains unclear is the transition that
is occurring with the line  &quot;I put on my pointed hat&quot;. There is a
departure from reality here, but how far a  depart-ure? Pure fantasy? A dream? 
</P>
<P>Or has the charaKTer been drawn right into Her own vision and is physically 
performing these acts as well, mechanically following her thoughts as it were?
Is  there a momentary return to reality as She, still dressed up in a rocket
outfit, falls  into the river below the bridge? &lt;sigh&gt; That's the problem
with imagery, these  questions will never be answered satisfactorily since She
appears to choose not to  elaborate. 
</P>
<P>In any case, I too was completely blown away by RT. I now thank the Powers
that  (She) be for the decisions I made which resulted in abstaining from any
prior  knowledge of TSW 's contents. In my opinion it was the auditory orgasm up
to  which all previous existing music has been building. I will go so far as to
publicly  opine that RT are two of the &quot;best&quot; compositions that KT has
ever penned, and, in  combination, should mandate FDA precautionary labeling at
minimum. 
</P>
<P>Have you ever been head-over-heels in love? Can't eat for the butterflies,
can't  sleep for the racing heart and can't get a damn thing done for the life
of you  head-over-heels in love? Take a week of that, distill all the emotion
down into 1  minute 29 seconds, and you have the first half of RT. The second
half is sheer  genius--only our KT could paint a powerFloyd-esque frame-work,
solely a  framework, around TTB and Herself, and make it much more than just &quot;work&quot;.

</P>
<P>Umm... I seem to be getting carried away. I like the tune. ;)

<P>Hi, Love-Hounds. 
</P>
<P>Par Fornland asks what Rocket's Tail is all about: the song is a little
story about a  young person who, in a final desperate moment of life (the
details of which have not  been explained), has actually strapped onto his/her
back a rocket and shot  him/herself into the air from Waterloo Bridge into the
river. In the first part of the  song this person recalls a conversation he/she
had had with a friend one Guy Fawkes  night, in which the friend had remarked
upon the beauty of the fireworks (rockets).  The narrator wryly recalls how
he/she had originally thought such an idea  crazy--that the momentary brilliance
of the rockets was a sad waste. The irony is  that in the second half of the
song, the narrator has not only come to share his/her  friend's opinion (that
life is short, and that a moment of brilliant glory is worth  seeking even if it
should be one's last act in life)--he/she has even taken the idea to  its
ultimate expression, i.e., jumping off a bridge in a rocket-suit.

<P>A great moment in the history of art.
