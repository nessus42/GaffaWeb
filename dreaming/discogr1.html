    <P>Kate Bush Rarities </P>
    
    <P>I was asked by Jeff Richardson to compile a list of songs that Kate Bush
      has recorded, but which do not appear on any of her albums. This is nearly
      everything I know about (I think): </P>
    
    <P>Singles and singles B-sides: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Passing Through Air&quot; (1980) -- &quot;Recorded in 1973 on a
      sunny afternoon at Dave's.&quot; On B-side of &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Empty Bullring&quot; (1980) -- B-side to &quot;Breathing&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot; (1980) -- An Xmas song. Only
      released as a single. One of Kate's best songs! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Warm And Soothing&quot; (1980) -- B-side to &quot;December Will Be
      Magic Again&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Ran Tan Waltz&quot; (1980) -- B-side to &quot;Babooshka&quot;.
      Much, much better than &quot;Babooshka&quot;! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Lord of The Reedy River&quot; (1981) -- Cover of the Donovan song.
      B-side to &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Dreamtime&quot; (1982) -- Instrumental version of &quot;The
      Dreaming&quot; -- quite different and wonderful. B-side to &quot;The
      Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Ne T'Enfuis Pas&quot; (1982) -- B-side to &quot;There Goes A
      Tenner&quot;. Also released as a single. Also on the Canadian &quot;Kate
      Bush&quot; EP, but not on the U.S. version. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Un Baiser D'Enfant&quot; (1983) -- B-side to &quot;Ne T'Enfuis Pas&quot;.
      A French version of &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;. Also on the &quot;Kate
      Bush&quot; EP. </P>
    
    <P>All of the songs up to this point can be found in a boxed set of 7 inch
      records called &quot;Kate Bush: The Single File 1978-1983&quot;. It
      contains a pamphlet with pictures and lyrics and thirteen records: The Man
      With the Child In His Eyes, Kate Bush On Stage (EP), Hammer Horror, Ne
      T'Enfuis Pas, Army Dreamers, December Will Be Magic Again, There Goes A
      Tenner, Wow, The Dreaming, Babooshka, Breathing, Wuthering Heights, and
      Sat In Your Lap. It often sells for up to $50, but a record store near
      hear is selling them for $19.99: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Under The Ivy&quot; (1985) -- B-side to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;.
      One of Kate's very best and emotionally powerful songs! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Running Up That Hill (Extended Version)&quot; (1985) -- 12 inch
      single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Running Up That Hill (Instrumental Version)&quot; (1985) -- On
      B-side of &quot;Running Up That Hill (Extended Version)&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Kate Appears On Others' Records </P>
    
    <P>&quot;You (The Game Part II) The two halves in Flight&quot; -- A duet
      sung by Roy Harper and Kate Bush. Written by Roy Harper and David Gilmour.
      Appears on Roy Harper's album &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;. An
      *amazing* song! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;No Self Control&quot; -- On Peter Gabriel's third album. Kate
      sings background vocals. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; -- On Peter Gabriel's third album.
      Kate sings the line &quot;Jeux sans frontieres&quot;, which everyone
      thinks is &quot;She's so funky, yeah&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;FLOWERS&quot; -- On an album called &quot;FIGVRES&quot; by Zaine
      Griff. Kate sings very prominent backing vocals. Very nice song! </P>
    
    <P>Kate also sings background vocals on a song by Leslie Duncan, but I've
      never heard it or seen it anywhere. </P>
    
    <P>Very Rare Stuff </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Another Day&quot; -- Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel do a duet version
      of Roy Harper's wonderful song &quot;Another Day&quot;. This is from
      Kate's BBC Xmas special that was broadcast in 1979 and is not on any
      record (except bootleg). &quot;Another Day&quot; has also recently been
      covered exceedingly well by This Mortal Coil on their album &quot;It'll
      End In Tears&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Egypt&quot; -- A live version of the song from Kate Bush's 1979
      concert tour. This is *totally* different from the version on &quot;Never
      for Ever&quot;. Not on any record (except bootleg). </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Let It Be&quot; -- Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, and Steve Harley
      covered this during one of Kate's concerts in 1979. Not on any record
      (except bootleg). </P>
    
    <P>A song in a movie called &quot;The Magician of Lublin&quot; -- Kate
      sings a song written by Maurice Jarre. It is used as background music in
      the film, and I haven't yet found it in any other form. </P>
    
    <P>Exceedingling Rare </P>
    
    <P>I'd commit mass murder to get any of these. PLEASE tell me if you ever
      find them anywhere! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Maybe&quot; -- In 1975 David Gilmour produced a demo tape for Kate
      Bush to give to EMI to help her get her recording contract. Two of the
      three songs on that demo tape were taken directly from that tape and put
      on &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;: &quot;Saxaphone Song&quot; and &quot;The
      Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;. The third song &quot;Maybe&quot; was
      never released, but I have about 20 seconds of it from a radio show where
      Kate was interviewed and they played a little bit of it. </P>
    
    <P>Kate did another Xmas song and gave it to radio stations to play, but
      she says that she is not aware of any station having ever played it, nor
      was it ever released. </P>
    
    <P>It is said that before Kate met David Gilmour she made a very rough demo
      tape at home containing 50 songs! She sent this off to record companies,
      but it didn't produce any response. I guess it doesn't hurt to have David
      Gilmour on your side.... </P>
    
    <P>All of the tons of demos, experiments, alternate versions, unreleased
      songs, and other stuff that is lying around in Kate's closets that we will
      never get to hear! </P>

    <P>&gt; From: Jim Hofmann &lt;hofmann@AMSAA.ARPA&gt;
      <BR> &gt; A bootleg (?) from the Tawian Fan club. </P>
    
    <P>There are two bootlegs from the Fan Club of Taiwan that I know of. One
      is called &quot;Paris 1979&quot; and has some stuff taken from a recording
      made on a cheap hand-held tape-recorder of one of her 1979 concerts. It
      has an early danceable (!) version of &quot;Egypt&quot; on it, that is so
      different from the version of &quot;Never For Ever&quot; that it's really
      wild to hear. I wish I could get a high fidelity copy of this version of
      the song. </P>
    
    <P>The other Fan Club of Taiwan album is a double album. It is called &quot;Kate
      Bush Live in Europe 79 &amp; 80&quot;. One record is the soundtrack to the
      &quot;Kate Bush Live at the Hammersmith Odeon&quot; video tape, and the
      other album is the soundtrack to the hour long Christmas special called &quot;Kate&quot;
      that she did in 79. The Christmas special, besides having some somewhat
      different versions of some of her early album songs, as well as videos for
      Egypt, Ran Tan Waltz, The Wedding List, etc., also has a duet of Kate Bush
      and Peter Gabriel singing Roy Harper's &quot;Another Day&quot; and a short
      little song for three acappela voices (that people call &quot;The Angel
      Gabriel&quot;) to introduce Peter Gabriel's &quot;Here Comes The Flood&quot;.</P>

    <P>P.S. What really pisses me off is that there was a 12 inch for &quot;Sat
      In Your Lap&quot;, but EMI decided at the last moment not to release it.
      Oooohhhhh! Kate has one. I wonder if she's into trading.... </P>
    
    <P>[some days later Doug posted:]
      <BR> The next thing you know, I'll be off in England camping out on
      Kate's front lawn until she gives me the 12&quot; single for &quot;Sat In
      Your Lap&quot; (which she has like the only copy of). Either that or until
      she gives *me* the key, rather than this Houdini bloke.... And then there
      will be no one left to run this mailing list. </P>

      <BR> Subject: 12&quot; DJ version of HoL </P>
    
    <P>&gt; From: (Scott Peterson)
      <BR> &gt; I have two copies of a 12&quot; version of HoL that has a
      different version of the song on each side. I fail to see the difference
      between them, but one is about 20 seconds longer. </P>
    
    <P>Ah, that's not a real thing. It's a DJ 12&quot; made by EMI-America,
      that is not for general sale. On one side is the album version and on the
      other side is some slight remix EMI-America (not Kate) did. Basically it
      just has the verses rearranged. The real 12&quot; single is only available
      as an import. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;And I'll be two steps on the water&quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;Another Day&quot; --
      <BR> Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel do a duet version of Roy Harper's
      wonderful song &quot;Another Day&quot;. This is from Kate's BBC Xmas
      special that was broadcast in 1979 and is not on any record (except
      bootleg). &quot;Another Day&quot; has also recently been covered

      <BR> Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, and Steve Harley covered this during one

      flexidisk. </P>

    <P>Date: Tue, 03 Feb 87 16:03 PST
      <BR> From: IED0DXM@UCLAMVS
      <BR> Subject: KT &quot;discography&quot; </P>
    
    <P>For those who have requested a re-posting of the &quot;discography&quot;,
      here is an updated edition. Note that this is not, nor was it ever, a real
      discography, but simply a list of every snippet of NON-LP KT music known
      (by IED) to exist. Recordings are listed in ROUGH chronological order.
    </P>
    
    <P>A real discography, including all foreign pressings with their catalogue
      numbers, cannot really be done --how could one ever be really certain he
      had not overlooked one of the early EMI-India pressings, for example? If
      there's one thing IED has learned in his nine years (next month!) of Kate
      Bush fanaticism, it is that no-one can ever hope to have a &quot;complete&quot;
      collection. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Maybe&quot;: one of Kate's earliest recordings with the KT Bush
      Band, made (as far as is known) in the summer of 1973, when Kate had just
      turned fifteen; she played about two verses and one chorus of the tape
      once during a British radio interview. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Passing Through Air&quot;: One of the b-sides to the &quot;Army
      Dreamers&quot; single, it was recorded in 1973, at &quot;Dave (Gilmour)'s
      house&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; (with spoken
      introduction): the only distinction of this original UK single mix is a
      strange spoken introduction in which Kate repeats the words &quot;He's
      here!&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;On Stage&quot;: a four-track EP of live performances from the Tour
      of Life, featuring &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, &quot;Don't Put Your
      Foot on the Heartbrake&quot;,&quot;L'Amour Looks Something Like You&quot;,
      and a long version of &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Live at the Hammersmith Odeon&quot;: the official video release,
      including performances of twelve songs from the Tour of Life. There are a
      few interesting musical changes from the LP versions, notably the long
      instrumental introduction to &quot;Kite&quot; and the early version of &quot;Violin&quot;
      (with non-LP lyrics). </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kate Bush -- On Tour&quot;: a German/Dutch TV documentary
      featuring footage of performances from the Tour of Life that were never
      officially released. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Wow!&quot;: one of the bootleg albums (this one a 2-LP set) put
      out by an American outfit; it includes a transfer onto vinyl of the &quot;Hammersmith&quot;
      video's audio track, and another vinyl transfer of the audio portion of
      Kate's 1979 UK Christmas television special (both of which were
      re-released as part of the recent &quot;Kate Bush Live in Europe '79-'80&quot;
      bootleg 3-LP set.) (Also, nine tracks from &quot;Hammersmith&quot; turned
      up as a third bootleg LP called &quot;A Bird in the Hand&quot;). </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Live in Paris '79&quot;: yet another bootleg by the same New
      Yorkers, this record features part of a live performance apparently done
      in Paris, and includes interesting versions of a few LP tracks. This
      record was also included as the third LP in the recent &quot;Live in
      Europe '79-'80&quot; bootleg set mentioned above. It is falsely identified
      as being a production of the non-existent &quot;Fan Club of Taiwan&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kate Bush&quot;: the only title of a UK bootleg audio-cassette
      which includes virtually the entire two hours of performance from a 1979
      concert in Bristol, England. This tape features chants, readings by John
      Carder Bush, and incidental music, all of which was heard in between
      Kate's songs during the concert. There are two strange ethnic chants; two
      synthesizer introductions to songs; two readings by John -- one known as &quot;Two
      in One Coffin&quot; (preceding &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;), the other a
      passage of unidentified prose (probably by John) about children, which
      precedes &quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot;; and a long jam session by the
      KT Bush Band. Also included is the alternate (live) version of &quot;Egypt&quot;,
      which sounds very different from the LP version. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kate&quot;: This was a forty-eight minute television special which
      aired in England at about the time of the Tour of Life. In addition to a
      couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one or two new vocal performances of
      old songs, several new and unique bits of music appeared on this show.
      They include a brief introduction, a performance of part of Satie's 1st &quot;Gymnopedie&quot;
      (as an introduction to &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;), an early version of &quot;December
      Will Be Magic Again&quot;, a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel (Kate's
      guest on the show), a brief bit of blues piano, and a duet with Peter of
      Roy Harper's song, &quot;Another Day&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Let It Be&quot;: a live performance of the Beatles song, sung by
      Steve Harley, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush during a one-off London benefit
      concert. This appeared in a very limited edition red plastic flexi-disc,
      made officially by the Kate Bush Club for the Japanese branch of the Club;
      in addition to the song, it includes a brief spoken message from John
      Carder Bush and Kate. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kashka From Baghdad&quot;: a live solo performance done on a
      British television show called &quot;Ask Aspel&quot; in early 1979. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Wedding List&quot;: a live performance done during the
      Prince's Trust Concert a few years ago; Kate is backed by Phil Collins on
      drums, Pete Townsend and Midge Ure on guitars and BVs, and Mick Karn on
      bass. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Empty Bullring&quot;: the b-side to the &quot;Breathing&quot;
      single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Ran Tan Waltz&quot;: the b-side to the &quot;Babooshka&quot;
      single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Army Dreamers&quot; (single mix): does not fade out, as it does on
      the LP. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;: the 1981 Christmas single;
      this song was written much earlier, and was performed on European
      television ca. 1979/80 in an arrangement featuring bongos. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Warm and Soothing&quot;: the b-side of the &quot;December Will Be
      Magic Again&quot; single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Sing, Children, Sing&quot;: a benefit single by Leslie Duncan,
      with Kate (virtually indistinguishable) singing in the all-star back-up
      chorus. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;You (The Game, Part II)&quot;: a duet with Roy Harper of his song,
      on his album The Unknown Soldier. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Flowers&quot;: a duet with Zaine Griff of his song, on his 1982 LP
      Figures. This song was a tribute to the dancer/mime/choreographer Lindsay
      Kemp, with whom Kate and Zaine had studied together for a time, ca.
      1975/77. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;No Self-Control&quot; and &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;: two
      tracks from Peter Gabriel's third solo album, on which Kate sings backing
      vocals. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Magician (theme from &quot;The Magician of Lublin&quot;): a
      song from the film &quot;The Magician of Lublin&quot; starring Alan Arkin,
      it featured the music of Maurice Jarre (lyricist unidentified). No
      soundtrack was ever commercially released; consequently, the song is only
      known from the nearly unlistenable film print itself (dialogue blots out
      most of Kate's vocal). </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; (rhythm track only): this track, isolated
      from the complete mix, was heard briefly on a British television
      documentary &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Fit&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; (single mix): distinctly different in sound
      (especially rhythm and relative prominence of lead vocal track) from LP
      version. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Lord of the Reedy River&quot;: the b-side of the &quot;Sat In Your
      Lap&quot; single; original song by Donovan, who sings (unidentifiably)
      BVs. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Dreamtime&quot;: the b-side of the &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
      single; an instrumental version of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, very similar
      to the LP track only without the lead vocals and with a longer, different
      ending. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Ne T'Enfuis Pas&quot;: originally the b-side of the &quot;There
      Goes a Tenner&quot; single, it was later remixed (the rhythm sound
      brightened and the lead vocal moved further up in the mix) for French and
      Canadian release as an a-side. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Un Baiser d'Enfant&quot;: the b-side of the remixed &quot;Ne
      T'Enfuis Pas&quot;, this is a French-language version of the Never For
      Ever track &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Brazil&quot;: a cover of the old popular song, not included in the
      Terry Gilliam film, but promised for inclusion in the forthcoming
      soundtrack LP. </P>
    
    <P>Theme from &quot;Castaway&quot;: a cover of the theme by Stanley Meyers
      from the Ken Russell film starring Oliver Reed. No LP release announced
      yet. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Don't Give Up&quot;: a duet with Peter Gabriel of a song from his
      album So. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Seer&quot;: a track from Big Country's 1986 album of the same
      name, on which Kate sings backing vocals. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The King is Dead&quot;: a track from Go West's forthcoming album,
      on which Kate sings backing vocals. (Due domestically in late February.)
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; (instrumental): identical to the LP
      version, except for the missing lead vocal track; featured on the
      twelve-inch single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; (re-mix): an extended re-mix of the
      original recording, featured on the twelve-inch single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Cloudbusting (The Organon Mix)&quot;: an extended re-mix of the
      original recording, featured on the twelve-inch single. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; (the film soundtrack): an extended version of

      original recording, with a slight remix and a different opening. </P>

    <P>Date: Thu, 05 Feb 87 14:50 PST
      <BR> From: IED0DXM@UCLAMVS
      <BR> Subject: New picture Disc </P>
    
    <P>Along with the new CD of The Dreaming (of which more below), a new Kate
      Bush picture-disc has started showing up in Los Angeles-area import record
      shops. It is a British import, priced from between $7.98 and $10.99. </P>
    
    <P>This record is reasonably well made, as such things go. It is NOT,
      repeat NOT an official EMI release, but an attempt has been made to make
      it APPEAR to be official (a pseudo-HoL type-style and EMI-like catalogue
      number). The two photos are in colour, and are relatively rare shots, one
      from an old publicity session, the other a candid from (IED believes) the
      German TV appearance for &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and &quot;The
      Big Sky&quot;. The record appears to have been made by the same people who
      put out a series of SEVEN-inch interview picture-discs of David Sylvian
      and Siouxsie Sioux about a year ago. Apparently they're getting more
      ambitious, branching out to twelve-inch. </P>
    
    <P>This one contains an interview done with Kate in her studio by a British
      fan who apparently obtained Kate's participation by associating himself
      with an Australian group (probably the Aussie fanzine Dreamtime, who did
      send a couple of writers over to visit the UK KT community early last
      year). Kate obviously had no idea at the time of the interview that the
      tape would be used as yet another exploitive bootleg product. </P>
    
    <P>However, this is definitely not the same as the infamous &quot;D. Cross&quot;
      interview which Homeground exposed as a fraud perpetrated by upstart rival
      Under the Ivy, as this is definitely a real one-on-one interview, whereas
      the other was just a fake using Kate's pre-recorded answers from the
      Canadian HoL interview record and a voice-over of the cue-sheet questions.
      Nevertheless, in the picture-disc's &quot;real&quot; interview, both the
      interviewer and Kate are extremely nervous and ill-at-ease, especially at
      the beginning and end of the interview; and the questions range from the
      utterly banal (things like &quot;What's 'Running Up That Hill' about?&quot;)
      to the completely weird and meaningless (&quot;The cloudbuster that Ken
      Hill made -- What's become of it?&quot; Answer: It's in storage in a
      garage, of course!). </P>
    
    <P>At the very end the interviewer throws in one of the questions Kate
      particularly dislikes getting, namely, &quot;Do you follow current affairs
      and politics, Kate?&quot;. This time it was especially unwelcome because
      Kate thought the interview was finished, and then had to stay and answer
      this last question. She gives her usual non-committal answer, but this
      time it's also clearly intended to stop the conversation -- the closest
      IED has ever heard Kate get to open annoyance. </P>

    <P>For trivia buffs and maniacal Beatles collectors, it may be of some
      interest to learn that an unknown number of packages for the EMI-America
      CDs of The Whole Story ACTUALLY contained the still unreleased CD of A
      Hard Day's Night. Two people discovered what they had after buying The
      Whole Story CD in the San Francisco area. One store was playing the
      Beatles CD when EMI authorities came in and made them give it back. </P>
    
    <P>And get this: one of the people who inadvertantly obtained one of the
      Beatles CDs went back and EXCHANGED it for another KT CD. Even IED isn't
      THAT loyal a fan! (He'd have kept both.) </P>
    
    <P>All of this was in the latest issue of Billboard under the headline: &quot;And
      now, for the Whole Story on the Beatles/Bush switch...&quot; And the
      article ended with speculation that sales of Kate's CD might go up in the
      next two weeks... </P>

    <P>(from Hugh Maher) </P>
    
    <P>Ok, so here's the big news: The latest copy of Billboard has a big story
      on page 24 about a recent Capitol mixup between &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot;
      CD of the Beatles, which they mistakenly packaged in cardboard boxes of &quot;The
      Whole Story&quot;. (I don't know if the CD label itself said &quot;Beatles&quot;
      or &quot;KB&quot;). Anyway, one of these mispackaged discs were returned
      to Tower records in Berkeley (not by me, unfortunately) by a KB fan
      complaining that &quot;the wrong music was on the CD&quot; - god, I
      thought Kate fans were supposed to either like the Beatles or have an IQ
      over 5... </P>
    
    <P>Capitol, of course, came and got the CD back from an equally thick store
      employee who willingly gave it up. Still, there are apparantly many more
      copies floating around, so keep your eyes out! Perhaps this will
      recuscitate the flagging chart life of &quot;The Whole Story&quot;. </P>

    <P>Date: Wed, 11 Feb 87 21:37 PST
      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
      <BR> Subject: another new picture disc </P>
    
    <P>Less than one week after a British-made twelve-inch interview
      piKTure-disk (described in detail by your news-Hound at the time) hit
      L.A.-area record stores, a SECOND one has turned up! That's right, there
      are now TWO twelve-inch piKTure-disks, each with a different interview
      with Kate. The first, which can be quickly identified as the one with a
      blue-ish photo on one side, contained a legitimate interview which was
      only subsequently used in the present illegitimate way. That interview is
      remarkable for its awkwardness and tense atmosphere, although the
      questions are only par for stupidity (i.e., almost everyone asks the same
      dumb questions). By the way, for sticklers, IED would like to correct his
      earlier dating of one of the photos on the first picture-disk -- both
      photos date from 1978. </P>
    
    <P>The newest one, on the other hand, has two reddish photos, the first a
      shot taken during Kate's stay in New York in November 1985 (she is wearing
      the veddy proper white blouse and floppy bow tie in which she made most of
      her public appearances there), the other a still from either German,
      French or Dutch lip-synch performances of &quot;Babooshka&quot;, from back
      in 1980 (this was the solo performance in a red jumpsuit with a bass viol
      as the only prop). The same group of bootleggers made both picture disks,
      and both have prominent catalogue numbers and copyright signs all over, to
      lend them a false air of authenticity (bloody cheek). </P>
    
    <P>This latest record, however, contains the now infamous &quot;fake&quot;
      interview so justly vilified in the 25th issue of Homeground. The
      questions are asked by a guy with a South London accent who begins by
      saying, &quot;Welcome to the studio, Kate,&quot; as though she is there
      with him. In fact, however, it becomes immediately obvious that Kate is
      not there at all, but that the guy is editing in Kate's pre-recorded
      answers with his questions, which are read from a cue-sheet in a manner
      that approximates (rather well) a real conversation. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, the answers are only barely intelligible, coming as they
      appear to have done from a poor through-the-air transfer of Kate's answers
      from the official Canadian EMI interview disk for Hounds of Love. This &quot;interview&quot;
      was originally released in the U.K., L-Hs will remember, as a seven-inch
      record in four different colours of vinyl, and the product was
      slanderously misattributed to poor Dave Cross at Homeground, which is
      probably why they got so mad over there. </P>
    
    <P>Altogether a shameful and sleazy undertaking, but unfortunately that
      won't stop a lot of fans from buying the thing (IED shame-facedly
      included). </P>

    <P>Mr. Marvick, </P>
    
    <P>The new Kate Bush interview picture disk is in no way related to the
      official Canadian EMI interview record. It's a totally different
      interview. I'm not really sure that it's appropriate to call these records
      &quot;bootlegs&quot; as they may be completely legal. For example, I own
      the rights to the interview I did with Kate and could presumably do
      anything I want to with it, including pressing records of it.</P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
      <BR> Subject: picture discs </P>
    
    <P>To answer the query re the piKTure disks: there are two twelve-inch
      bootleg picture-disk interview records in American import record shops
      now. (All of this is a summary of earlier notices from IED.) The first
      features two old colour photos of Kate, ca. 1978, wearing her old white
      dove earrings. The second (apparently the one you saw) has two more recent
      photos: one from the European lip-synch of &quot;Babooshka&quot; (Kate in
      red leotard, bass viol by the throat), the other a close-up from her 1985
      visit to America. Both feature &quot;unofficial&quot; &quot;interviews&quot;
      with Kate. </P>
    
    <P>The one with the old photos is a real interview, i.e. Kate is talking
      with the person interviewing her in a quiet room with good recording
      equipment. The interview is horrible: Kate is nearly as nervous as the
      incompetent interviewer (who sounds like a slightly over-the-edge fan
      himself), and it is a mystery how he managed to get Kate to agree to do
      the interview at all --IED has a theory that she was led to believe the
      guy had come all the way from Australia, and that the interview would be
      published in &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, or some such falsehood. He mentions
      Australia in the course of the interview. Anyway, it's a curiosity, since
      Kate sounds extremely uncomfortable throughout. </P>
    
    <P>The one with the recent photos is even more despicable. The interview is
      fake; that is, a tape of an earlier interview was played, with the
      interviewer (possibly the same twerpus who did the other one) interjecting
      imitations of the original interviewer's questions in between her
      pre-recorded answers. The sound is terrible, but the interview's content
      isn't without interest. This, incidentally, is not the same fake interview
      that appears on the infamous SEVEN-inch bootleg fake interview disk, which
      is the object of Homeground's venom; although the method of synching up
      pre-recorded answers from Kate with newly-posed questions from the &quot;interviewer&quot;
      is the same in both cases. The picture-disks themselves all come from the
      same group of U.K. bootleggers, and they are just two of a very long
      series of interview-disks, including similar product that features Peter
      Gabriel, Siouxsie Sioux, Marillion, Simple Minds, etc., etc. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
      <BR> Subject: re: the top 100 colleKTables </P>
    
    <P>The April '87 issue of Record Collector (the U.K. equivalent to the
      U.S.'s Goldmine) has a cover article on Kate Bush collectable records. The
      article is followed by a list of the &quot;Top 100 Rarities&quot;. Both
      are anonymously written. It will be of interest to all KT collectors, but
      don't take it too seriously (the way IED has), since it is also very
      inaccurate and plagued by silly ommissions. </P>
    
    <P>The article and list now follow. For the sake of clarity, however, IED
      has broken his usual policy and inserted his annotations throughout the
      text, in an attempt to dispel the effects of the article's errors as soon
      as possible. IED's comments are between &lt; &gt; marks. </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush: Top 100 Rarities </P>
    
    <P> A detailed list of Kate Bush's most valuable collector's items from all
      over the world </P>
    
    <P>The list of rare records at the end of this feature are proof of Kate
      Bush's current stature in the world of record collecting. She is
      undoubtedly one of Britain's most popular singer-songwriters, and she has
      achieved consistent success entirely on her own terms -- refusing to be
      drawn into dubious publicity campaigns or lengthy promotional tours. Her
      recent duet with Peter Gabriel on &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; showed that
      her popularity extends beyond the general public into the musical
      community and -- as the early votes in this year's Readers Poll have
      demonstrated -- she pulls her support from right across the board, falling
      into no convenient faction or musical category. </P>
    
    <P>Interest from collectors in all areas of her work has increased
      dramatically over the last eighteen months, and many discs which would not
      have been regarded as collector's items two years ago are now changing
      hands for high prices -- notably the original picture sleeve copies of her
      early U.K. singles. And like all the other most collectable artists, her
      overseas picture sleeves, promos and limited editions are very
      sought-after. </P>
    
    <P>We have attempted to put together a definitive list of the 100 most
      collectable Kate Bush items. In practice, of course, such a list cannot be
      definitive; there is always going to be a South Korean picture sleeve of &quot;Wow!&quot;
      or a Peruvian promo of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; to alter the odds. But
      we believe that our list represents all the collectable items that are in
      general circulation -- which is not to say that they are easy to find!
    </P>
    
    <P>&lt;This claim is just false. There are significant ommissions of KT
      collectables which are as much in &quot;general circulation&quot; -- both
      here and in the U.K. -- as many of the items on the bottom half of the
      list below; and many of these overlooked items fetch considerably higher
      prices than some of those which have been included.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>At the top of our list is one of two interview albums issued by
      EMI-America for North American DJs, to promote Kate's early LPs. &lt;One
      of these was actually made to promote HoL, hardly an &quot;early&quot; LP.&gt;
      &quot;An Interview with Kate Bush&quot; is much scarcer (and more
      interesting) than the album at No. 5 in our list, which exists in greater
      quantities -- presumably because it comes from the States, rather than
      Canada.</P>
    
    <P>As you will see, white label test pressings, white label promos and
      ordinary promos take up a large part of this chart. But there are also
      some much more unusual items. At No. 3, for example, is a white label
      album called &quot;The Early Years&quot;. This apparently consists of demo
      recordings that Kate made before her first release for EMI. A couple of
      years ago, an East German company is believed to have got hold of the
      tapes, and prepared them for release as an album. White label copies were
      pressed up, and apparently went into local circulation. The album was
      immediately withdrawn because of pressure from EMI's East German
      licensees, however, and is obviously now a very sought-after item. We know
      that collectors are willing to pay up to 60 Pounds for copies, but we have
      not been able to trace anyone who has actually seen a copy! If you own
      one, or can give us more details of the contents and the presentation of
      the album, then please let us know. </P>
    
    <P>&lt;There may be a very good reason for the fact that no-one has ever
      seen a copy -- namely, that the record may not really exist. Since no-one
      has yet reported having seen this album, even after two years, it seems
      less likely than ever that it was ever anything more than a fictitious
      rumour. However, if it existed, it would undoubtedly place not at No. 3 on
      the list of most collectable KT items (at a paltry 60 Pounds!), but at No.
      1. </P>
    
    <P>Since the only consistent criterion for the relative placement of the
      items on the list seems to be what some collector has said he would pay
      for them, this writer knows at least three fans who have said they would
      gladly pay $500 or more for a copy of &quot;The Early Years&quot;; and no
      wonder, since this legendary record is supposed to include demos of
      original Kate Bush material that has never been heard in any form -- a
      prize tantamount to the Kate Bush collector's Holy Grail. The Canadian
      interview disc and the U.K. white label test pressing of The Kick Inside
      are ordinary in the extreme, in comparison. So how much credence can the
      Record Collector's price ratings have?&gt; </P>
    
    <P>DISAPPOINTED </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The Single File&quot;, the boxed set of Bush singles issued three
      years ago, is now a collector's item in itself, although at its time of
      release it disappointed many fans, both with its production standards and
      its failure to reproduce the original picture sleeves. That has done
      collectors a favour, however, by making it much easier to tell original
      pic sleeves from the reissues. </P>
    
    <P>On the rarest of the early picture sleeves, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;,
      the EMI logo on the back cover is round, while on the reissue it is
      square. The same applies to originals and reissues of &quot;Wow&quot;.
      With &quot;The Man With the Child&quot;, the differences are more
      difficult to describe; but the reissue has much less clear printing than
      the original, and is obviously a copy of a sleeve, rather than the
      original artwork. There are similar differences on the other reissues; for
      example, the reissues of &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; have square-edged
      paper-folds on the back, rather than the round edges of the originals. In
      some cases, these minor differences can make a variation of several
      hundred percent in the values of originals and reissue copies. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kate Bush On Stage&quot;, the four-track set taken from her first
      and only concert tour, is responsible for several entries in our list of
      rarities. The set originally appeared in demo form as a double-pack in a
      gatefold sleeve, and the first few copies of the standard release followed
      the same format. Most copies exist as a single four-track EP in a gatefold
      sleeve, however, with original copies having a card cover rather than the
      paper used for the reissue. </P>
    
    <P>&lt;This last distinction between original and reissue is true for most
      of the Single File singles, and is a much easier way to tell one from the
      other than the tiny differences in corner-cuts, etc.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>RUMOURS </P>
    
    <P>There are rumours of a British 12&quot; issue of this EP, but no copies
      appear to be in circulation. Overseas, however, there are several very
      collectable variations. The most sought-after is the Japanese 7&quot;
      edition, which comes with a pull-out insert. Close behind is the Canadian
      7&quot; edition, contained in a gatefold sleeve which was itself placed
      within a 12&quot; outer sleeve. Both these versions sell for about 12
      Pounds. Other collectable variations include the Dutch and French 12&quot;
      singles, plus a double-pack version issued in Portugal. In some other
      countries, such as Germany, however, the four-track EP was eventually
      issued in a single sleeve, rather than a gatefold package. </P>
    
    <P>Three flexidiscs are very popular with collectors. Eastern European
      countries have produced many collectable flexis, and in Kate Bush's case
      the rarest is a one-sided Russian disc of &quot;Babooshka&quot; in blue
      vinyl. A similar Belgian flexi given away with a magazine sells for about
      12 Pounds, while the Japanese Fan Club issued a version of &quot;Let It Be&quot;
      unavailable elsewhere; this now sells for about 25 Pounds. </P>
    
    <P>All the prices listed here are for records in Mint condition, and
      reflect recent selling prices of rare Kate Bush material in this country.

    <P>2. The Kick Inside (UK white label test pressing in folder cover with

      <BR> &lt;Note: This interview LP includes cue-sheets.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>6. The Single File (EMI KBS 1; boxed set of singles, numbered limited
      edition).................40 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Note: If it's important that the set be from the numbered
      limited edition, then what is the relative value of the later unnumbered
      edition? This more common version of the boxed set isn't even included
      among the top 100 on the list, even though it is still a highly
      sought-after item -- indicating that the compiler of this list was not
      aware of the existence of a later unnumbered edition.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>7. Wow! (Canadian promo single, yellow vinyl..........40 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>8. Symphony in Blue (Canadian promo single, blue
      vinyl)........................................40 Pounds </P>

      insert).................................35 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>10. The Kick Inside (UK picture disc LP)..............30 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Here again, the compiler apparently is unaware of the difference
      in appearance and price of the original issue of The Kick Inside picture
      disc LP and the later, more common reissue, which doesn't even crack this
      &quot;top 100&quot;, even though it is certainly more sought-after than
      some of the items near the bottom of this list.&gt;</P>
    
    <P>11. Lionheart (UK white label test pressing)..........30 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>12. The Kick Inside (U.S. promo copy with original cover design, EMI SW
      11761)..............30 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>&lt;This is the &quot;glamour&quot; cover, still used by Harvest of
      Canada today for its edition of The Kick Inside; and not to be confused
      with the &quot;country-western&quot; cover, listed at number 48 on this
      list.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>13. The Man With the Child in his Eyes (U.K. white label test

    <P>16. Hounds of Love (U.S. LP on grey marble vinyl).....22 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;This is actually just a greyer marbling of the same pink and
      grey colours used for the cassette and the &quot;Canadian&quot; pink
      marble LP listed at number 27. In fact, there are some U.S. copies with
      marble as pink as the Canadian ones.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>17. Hounds of Love (U.S. white label promo LP with photos and biography,

    <P>23. Sat In Your Lap (Canadian mini-LP, brown vinyl)..20 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;This mini-LP, also listed in different coloured vinyl at numbers
      31 through 34, is not called Sat In Your Lap, but simply Kate Bush.&gt;
    </P>
    
    <P>24. Suspended in Gaffa (U.S. 12&quot; promo single).......18 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>25. Hounds of Love (U.S. marble cassette).............16 Pounds </P>

    <P>35. The Dreaming (U.S. four-track 12&quot; promo EP).......15 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Again, this mini-LP is not called The Dreaming. Since in this
      case, however, it has no title at all, The Dreaming suffices to identify
      it.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>36. Running Up That Hill (Japanese promo single)......15 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>37. Ne T'enfuis pas/Un Baiser d'enfant (Canadian
      single).................................12 Pounds </P>

      Duran's &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;).....12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>39. Them Heavy People (U.S. mono/stereo 12&quot; promo)....12 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;The U.S. mono/stereo 7&quot; promo of The Man With the Child in
      his Eyes is also quite collectable, certainly enough so to have been
      included somewhere in this list.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>40. Moving (Polish 'postcard' single).................12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>41. Strange Phenomena (Polish 'postcard' single)......12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>42. Saxaphone Song (Polish 'postcard' single).........12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>43. Kate Bush On Stage (Canadian 7&quot; gatefold sleeve in outer 12&quot;
      sleeve)..............................12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>44. Kate Bush On Stage (Japanese picture sleeve single with pull-out
      biographical insert).........12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>45. The Man With the Child in his Eyes (Dutch single, with different
      picture sleeve to U.K.)....12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>46. The Man With the child in his Eyes (Belgian single, with different
      picture sleeve to U.K.)....12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>47. Wuthering Heights (Italian single with slightly different picture
      sleeve to U.K.)........12 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Why is this single, whose only remarkable feature is its Italian
      translation of the song's title (Cime tempestose), placed so high up in
      the list, when the German Wuthering Heights single, featuring an article
      about Kate by one Dr. Biolek on the cover, is ommitted? Ditto for the
      Spanish Sat In Your Lap, which features a translation of the title
      (Sentada en tu Ragazo). These are certainly as sought-after as the Italian
      Wuthering Heights.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>48. The Kick Inside (U.S. original LP with different cover to
      U.K............................12 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;See note to no. 12.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>49. Kate Bush (Belgian flexidisc with magazine).......12 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;What is on this flexidisc? Judging from the description in the
      article above, it contains Babooshka. What else, if anything? </P>
    
    <P>50. Kate Bush On Stage (EMI promo double-pack single in gatefold
      sleeve)........................12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>51. Wuthering Heights (U.K. promo single).............12 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>52. The Man With the Child in his Eyes (U.K. promo

    </P>
    
    <P>54. The Kick Inside (Canadian LP with different cover to
      U.K......................................10 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;The &quot;glamour&quot; cover, same as that for no. 12.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>55. Wuthering Heights (Dutch single with slightly different picture
      sleeve to U.K.)........10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>56. Wuthering Heights (Polish single with same picture sleeve as
      U.S.)......................10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>57. The Man With the Child in his Eyes (French single with picture
      sleeve).......................10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>58. The Man With the Child in his Eyes (Japanese single with different
      picture sleeve to U.K.).....10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>59. Wow! (French single with slightly different picture sleeve to
      U.K.).................10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>60. Wow! (Belgian single with slightly different picture sleeve to
      U.K.)...........................10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>61. Kate Bush On Stage (Portuguese double-pack single in gatefold
      sleeve)........................10 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>62. Running Up That Hill (U.S. 12&quot; promo single)......10 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;This is as good a place as any to comment on the frequent
      absurdity of the high prices paid for &quot;promo&quot; items. In many
      cases -- such as this one -- the promo LP is no different from the
      officially marketed LP, except that the promo has been gold-stamped. In
      fact, the promo is sometimes cheaper and less well made than the official
      marketed item; usually its only claim to fame is its relative scarcity --
      a poor justification for its high price.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>63. Hounds of Love (U.S. long/short 12&quot; promo)........10 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Note: this is not an edit of the LP track, nor is the long
      version the same as the &quot;Alternative Hounds&quot; re-mix; rather, it
      is the normal LP mix, backed with the same mix artificially extended
      another 30 seconds by an American engineer.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>64. The Big Sky (U.S. 12&quot; promo of single mix)........10 Pounds
    </P>
    
    <P>65. Experiment IV (U.S. picture sleeve 7&quot; promo)......10 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Note: Both for no. 65 and no. 97, there is, as far as this
      writer knows, no such U.S. 'promo' for the 7&quot; single, as there is for
      the 12&quot;. These are simply the first pressings of the 7&quot;, which
      were issued in picture sleeves. Also, if U.S. 'promo' 7&quot;s of
      Experiment IV and Running Up That Hill (see no. 97) are listed, then why
      aren't their 12&quot; counterparts-- authentic 'promos' these -- listed?&gt;
    </P>
    
    <P>66. Moving (Japanese single with picture insert)......9 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>67. The Man With the Child in his Eyes (U.K. original picture sleeve
      single)...................8 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>68. Hammer Horror (U.K. promo single).................8 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>69. Babooshka (U.K. promo single).....................8 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>70. Wuthering Heights (Belgian single with slightly different picture
      sleeve to U.K.).................8 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>71. Ne T'enfuis pas/Un Baiser d'enfant (French Odeon
      single).....................................8 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;This single did not come out on the Odeon label, but on the
      Pathe-Marconi label.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>72. Interview (green vinyl picture sleeve single).....7 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>73. Interview (yellow vinyl picture sleeve single)....7 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>74. Interview (red vinyl picture sleeve single).......7 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>75. Interview (blue vinyl picture sleeve single)......7 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;These are bootleg seven-inch &quot;fake-interview&quot;
      colour-vinyl disks. Why are they included in the list, when none of the
      other bootleg items, several of which are now quite rare and highly
      sought-after, are ommitted? For example, there are: a bootleg cassette of
      Kate's Bristol concert, complete with incidental music and John Carder
      Bush's readings; the U.S. bootleg albums Wow!, Live in Paris '79, A Bird
      in the Hand, and Live in Europe '79-'80; and two new U.K. twelve-inch
      picture-disk interview records. All of these are certainly as collectable
      as the records listed in positions 80 through 100 on this list.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>76. Wow! (U.K. promo single)..........................7 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>77. Breathing (U.K. promo single).....................7 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>78. Army Dreamers (U.K. promo single).................7 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>79. Running Up That Hill (Spanish promo single in picture
      sleeve)................................7 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Why is this promo alone described as being in a picture sleeve?
      The notation implies that other promos do not have picture-sleeves, which
      is not always the case.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>80. December Will Be Magic (U.K. promo single)........6 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>81. There Goes a Tenner (U.K. promo single)...........6 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>82. Running Up That Hill (U.K. promo single)..........6 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>83. Experiment IV (one-sided white label single)......6 Pounds </P>
    
    <P>84. Wuthering Heights (French picture sleeve single)..6 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Why is this French single listed, and not the far more
      sought-after French Breathing, which features a sleeve different to both
      the U.K. and the German editions?&gt; </P>
    
    <P>85. Hammer Horror (Japanese picture sleeve single)....6 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Why are the Japanese Hammer Horror, Moving (no. 66) and The Man
      With the Child in his Eyes (no. 58) singles listed, but not the equally
      collectable Japanese singles of Babooshka, Running Up That Hill, and
      Symphony in Blue -- the last of which even features a different picture
      sleeve to the U.K. edition?&gt; </P>
    
    <P>86. Hammer Horror (Italian picture sleeve single).....6 Pounds
      <BR> &lt;Again, why not the Spanish edition of Hammer Horror also? Record
      Collector's compiler admits that this list is not truly &quot;definitive&quot;
      because of the existence of so many foreign pressings. But he/she then
      insists that the list &quot;represents all the collectable items that are
      in general circulation,&quot; which is simply false. The list is very
      arbitrary, and includes numerous items which are no more sought after than
      others which have been inexplicably ommitted; no. 86 being a case in
      point.&gt; </P>
    
    <P>88. Kate Bush On Stage (Dutch 12&quot; single in picture
      sleeve)...................................6 Pounds </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
      <BR> Subject: re Record Collector's Article: </P>
    
    <P>IED agrees totally that 100 is excessive; actually so is 10. The only
      truly &quot;rare&quot; Kate Bush collectable record is the (possibly
      non-existent) East German Demos LP called The Early Years. All other KT &quot;rarities&quot;
      are actually just &quot;hard-to-find&quot;, a decidedly inferior status.
      After all, according to the Record Collector's price list, a new collector
      could acquire every item on the entire Top 100 list by making a total
      investment of 1,588 Pounds (approx. $2,223.00): you can't even buy a Yugo
      for that! Furthermore, the collectors who can get you what you want
      (provided you have the money) are pretty well known and reasonably
      reliable. So none of these are Christie's or Sotheby's material. The
      excessive length of the list was the root of almost all of Record
      Collector's mistakes: the compiler had so many spaces to fill up that some
      arbitrary insertions and omissions were inevitable. </P>
    
    <P>On the other hand, there are a lot more than 100 &quot;collectable&quot;
      records that can go for 5 Pounds or so, so the only way to make an
      effective list is either to include every item, no matter how long the
      list, or to make a cut-off at something like 20 Pounds. Even so, such a
      list is next to meaningless, because there will always be some new Kate
      fan with a poor knowledge of the market, some extra cash and a fervor to
      buy, buy, buy. So what items are probably the hardest to find? Again, hard
      to say, since even those items were easy for SOMEONE to find. In other
      words, these lists are not very helpful. So instead, IED will list ten
      items which he feels are probably the most INHERENTLY worthwhile, even at
      inflated prices. That's about the best he can do. Notice that no ordinary
      promotional copies are included, and only one white-label makes the list.
      In general, the premium on such items is artificial, and annoying to this
      fan. </P>
    
    <P>Top 10 ColleKTable Records </P>
    
    <P> 1. The Early Years (East German Demos LP).
      <BR> If it exists at all, then its value is immeasurable. An album of
      Kate's earliest performances -- pre-falsetto-era -- from the period of
      (and possibly including) &quot;Passing Through Air&quot; and &quot;Maybe&quot;.
      Like going back in time to witness the birth of God. </P>
    
    <P> 2. Let It Be (ca. 1981; Kate Bush Club of Japan flexidisc).
      <BR> With brief spoken messages from Kate and John Carder Bush. This is
      quite rare; but more importantly, it is extremely interesting. It gives a
      very strong and atmospheric impression of the ethos of the Bush family,
      plus a recording of Kate's most ingenuous and (arguably) least artistic
      performance. For Kate fans it has to be a remarkable icon. </P>
    
    <P> 3. The Bristol concert bootleg cassette (with a photo of silent film
      star Louise Brooks on the cover.)
      <BR> IED has never heard of anyone else having a copy of this tape, but
      it is almost certainly not rare. In IED's opinion, this unedited two-hour
      bootleg of one of Kate's Tour of Life shows is invaluable. It includes not
      only nearly all of the songs from the concert -- including the alternate
      early version of Egypt -- but most of the incidental music, chants and
      readings, as well. By contrast, all of the U.S.-made bootleg LPs feature
      radically edited excerpts from the live performances. </P>
    
    <P> 4. An Interview with Kate Bush (Canadian promo LP, EMI America SPRO
      282).
      <BR> This is the more recent of the two official interview LPs, and it
      features a few interesting moments. It's also supposed to be very rare.
    </P>
    
    <P> 5. Kate Bush Self-Portrait (U.S. promo LP, EMI America SSA 3024).
      <BR> A very early interview (done in the summer of 1978). Kate is young
      and filled with enthusiasm. It makes a marked contrast from Number 4. </P>
    
    <P> 6. The Kick Inside (UK white-label test pressing in folder cover with
      photos &amp; biography).
      <BR> One of the few white-labels for which the high price may be
      justified. It is very rare, is specially packaged, and supposedly has
      terrific sound. Except that the CD has even better sound; and anyway, if
      the LP gets played, its sound deteriorates and its value goes way down. So
      what's the point? </P>
    
    <P> 7. The Kick Inside Picture-Disk (original edition).
      <BR> Not really any higher quality than the later re-pressing, but its
      authenticity may still be of value to some collectors. </P>
    
    <P> 8. The Single File (original numbered edition).
      <BR> As with number 7, the original run of this item is no better than
      the later unnumbered edition, but its verifiable rarity gives it some
      value. The actual records are cheap re-prints, so collectors of singles
      would do better to concentrate on finding mint copies of the original U.K.
      picture-sleeve singles. </P>
    
    <P> 9. A tie between all of Kate's original U.K. picture-sleeve singles:
      <BR> Wuthering Heights, The Man With the Child in his Eyes, Hammer
      Horror, Wow and the Kate Bush On Stage double-pack. In perfect condition
      these are worth alot of money, and are genuinely valuable artifacts. </P>
    
    <P> 10. A tie between A Symphony in Blue (Canadian blue vinyl), Wow
      (Canadian yellow vinyl), Wuthering Heights (U.S. gold vinyl), Babooshka
      (Russian blue vinyl flexi), and a complete set of the Canadian mini-album
      (in Green, White, brown, red, blue and clear vinyl). </P>
    
    <P>These were all genuinely limited editions, unlike the U.S. marbleized
      Hounds of Love LPs and cassettes, of which a great number were pressed.
      The fact that the marbleized items bring a very high price nowadays
      doesn't mean they're worth it. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Acetates </P>
    
    <P>One class of collectables conspicuously absent from the &quot;top 100&quot;
      rareties list is acetates. These are special disks cut one at a time and
      in *extremely* small quantities (often one or two of a particular
      single/album), usually to find out what a record will sound like before
      going through the great expense+effort of making the actual pressing
      masters, etc. for producing vinyl records. </P>
    
    <P>While I don't know how many acetates of each Kate Bush record have been
      made, or for which *any* are in general circulation (often only the artist
      and the producer will get copies; sometimes only the artist; sometimes the
      record label requests a few), I do know that at least one acetate copy of
      &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; is in a collector's hands. I saw it at a used
      record store in LA a few years ago for $35.00.</P>
    
    <P>Another nice thing about acetates (from the collector's point of view)
      is that they sometimes contain unreleased material. I have acetates of a
      few LP's that differ from their released counterparts, and a lot of
      acetate singles which were never released (often referred to as acetate &quot;demos&quot;).
      Sorry, no Kate stuff (as well as I remember). </P>

      Homeground, &quot;The International Kate Bush Fanzine&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>First, they confirm the existence of several new bootlegs, and although
      they try to make it sound like none of them is worth owning, in fact one
      of the latest, a two-LP set called Under the Ivy Bush, contains some
      absolutely exclusive stuff, namely demo versions of &quot;Babooshka&quot;
      and a couple of other tracks from that era! Interesting, eh? Plus it may
      contain the live &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;.too. </P>
    
    <P>Also, they confirm the existence of a new 7&quot; bootleg single
      containing the Policeman's Third Ball &quot;RUTH&quot; backed with &quot;Let
      It Be&quot; from the same concerts. Worth having. </P>

      <BR> Subject: New Kate bootleg -- a CD! </P>
    
    <P>IED just stumbled across the first-ever KATE BUSH PICTURE-CD. Actually,
      though, it's still a pretty shoddy piece of merchandise, despite its
      uniqueness (so far). It's an interview-disk, a new entry in the continuing
      series of cult-rocker interview CDs that have been showing up in import CD
      shops during the past couple of months. (Earlier entries include Sisters
      of Mercy, Cocteau Twins and Peter Gabriel, plus perhaps five or six
      others.) The covers of all of these CDs are yellow, with a photograph of
      the artist/artists on the front of the &quot;booklet&quot;. No label name
      is given, and it's possible that the company is the same that put out the
      long series of picture-disk vinyl interview LPs under the &quot;BAKTABAK&quot;
      label, but there's no way of really knowing. </P>
    
    <P> [|&gt;oug is not sure that &quot;bootleg&quot; is the most appropriate
      term to use here, as interview albums are probably perfectly legal to
      market. -- |&gt;oug ] </P>
    
    <P> The Kate Bush CD features a candid photo of Kate from her appearance at
      the laser-art press audition of the Hounds of Love LP in the fall of 1985.
      Another photo by the same photographer was used by Verkerke poster company
      as the source for a poster which appeared in Europe shortly afterward.
      Kate is seen wearing a plain off-white silk blouse and the dragon earrings
      which appear on the cover of the Hounds of Love twelve-inch (and
      elsewhere). The same photograph is reproduced on (and somewhat rattily
      inserted in) the label-side surface of the compact disc itself. </P>
    
    <P>As for the audio content, it is comprised of two separate interviews,
      the first of about twenty-three minutes' length, the other of about nine
      minutes. IED cannot say for sure, because he has never heard the &quot;official&quot;
      HoL promotional interview LP, but it seems likely to him that one or the
      other (or possibly both) of the interviews on this CD come from that
      interview. The longer of the two is an undoctored, legitimate conversation
      between Kate and an unidentified Englishman who asks all the usual and
      basic questions, receiving all the usual and basic replies, although Kate
      seems to take more than her usual care in choosing her words. </P>
    
    <P>Oh, one more thing, this by way of a warning to the buyer: on the back
      of the CD's jewel-box notes there is a &quot;guarantee&quot; that none of
      the interview CDs in this yellow series is less than 40 minutes in length.
      In fact, however, the Kate Bush CD is only a little more than 32 minutes
      long. So much for truth in advertising. </P>

      <BR> Subject: &quot;KATE BUSH The Early Years&quot; - Bootleg or no?
      <BR> Date: 08:38:24 PM Wed 11 Jan 1989 GMT </P>
    
    <P>I picked up a copy of the January issue of the UK magazine &quot;Record
      Collector&quot; today, in which &quot;Richard Jackson reviews the rarest
      releases from the first three years of Bush's career, including promos,
      limited editions and obscure overseas picture sleeves and LPs&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>The majority of it will be no surprise to the dedicated KollecTor
      (although I wonder if the prices have really gone up that much since I was
      last in the market some 3-4 months ago), but I was struck by the
      following: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;There has been much confusion in the past over two German Kate
      Bush albums, one from each half of the divided country. One is called
      ``The Early Years'', the other ``Amiga''. Contrary to what we've been told
      in the past, they contain entirely different material. </P>
    
    <P>[description of ``Amiga'' collection (no rare material) omitted] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The West German title is ``The Early Years'' - the most mysterious
      Bush album of all. Some say this is an official release, quickly withdrawn
      under pressure from the Bush/EMI camp; others claim it is a bootleg. Both
      may be true. [I think he means either may be true!] In either case, the
      record contains some of Kate's earliest demo recordings, almost all of
      which are songs unavailable elsewhere. I can confirm that the record does
      exist, as I had a copy in my hands for about five seconds last year - long
      enough to say that it looked like an official release, but not to memorise
      the song titles! If it was an 'official' release, then expect it to change
      hands for very large sums indeed.&quot; [in context, this would appear to
      mean several hundred pounds] </P>
    
    <P>So, eKsperTs (IED, this means you!) (|&gt;oug, where are you?) what's
      the story here? I personally find it very hard to believe that such a
      treasure trove could be hidden in obscurity for so long, especially if it
      was an official West German release, but then again, &quot;Record
      Collector&quot; is not given to perpetrating hoaxes. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, if anyone actually *has* this, it goes without saying that
      I'd give my right [insert your chosen body-part here] for a tape of it.

      <BR> Subject: D E M O S (Craig's posting re Record Collector ) </P>
    
    <P> Many thanks to Craig for his posting on the new RC article. IED
      entertains little hope that his contributions to the research behind
      Jackson's article was acknowledged. (IED sent in a long--as if you
      couldn't have guessed it would be long!--letter of review of RC 's last
      big Kate collectibles article, and it was never published. One of the
      points covered in his letter was the distinction between the two German
      LPs.) </P>
    
    <P> &gt;The majority of it will be no surprise to the dedicated KollecTor
      (although I wonder if the prices have really gone up that much since I was
      last in the market some 3-4 months ago), but... </P>
    
    <P> Not knowing the prices cited in the magazine, IED can't say, but he has
      seen the prices on some Kate items skyrocket beyond all reasonable belief
      during the past year or so. It all depends on who you're buying from, of
      course, but how about $750.00 for the pair of framed, autographed photos
      that went for a total of $60 when originally offered by Kate and EMI at
      the time of HoL 's initial release? Or $125.00 for the Canadian On Stage
      --in less than mint condition? Both these items were sold, too, at a
      Hollywood store. </P>
    
    <P> &gt;recordings, almost all of which are songs unavailable elsewhere. I
      can confirm that the record does exist, as I had a copy in my hands for
      about five seconds last year - long enough to say that it looked like an
      official release, but not to memorise the song titles! </P>
    
    <P> The record does indeed exist. Peter FitzGerald-Morris confirmed this
      fact at the beginning of 1988 in a news flash in HG. He also listed the
      individual song titles (there are ten) in the article. Among them (from
      IED's poor memory) were: Davy (an early version of Maybe ); Cussi Cussi ;
      Atlantis ; and Sunsi. </P>

      <BR> Subject: New KT &quot;bootleg&quot; interview CD </P>
    
    <P> Yet another KT interview CD has come on the market. Unlike most of the
      others released to date, this new CD is an excellent product. It's called
      (wrongly or euphemistically) Kate Bush: The Abbey Road Interview, and it
      is apparently being made in an authentically &quot;limited&quot;
      edition--at any rate, each copy includes a serial number on the front
      cover. </P>
    
    <P>The cover--which is made of card-paper in the style of a five-inch-size
      album cover--is beautifully designed, with pretty silver block lettering
      on a dark blue background. On the front cover it simply says &quot;K A T E
      B U S H&quot; above a reproduction of one of Guido Herera's HoL -era
      publicity close-ups, in full and good-quality colour. The back has the
      title, the serial number (printed in black on a white band) and a
      marvelously printed colour shot of Kate, dating from a series of photos
      for a ca.-1979/80 UK music-weekly interview (quite unrelated to the
      contents of the CD itself, but a wonderful shot nevertheless), showing her
      seated on a bank of black leather couches in a lobby, wearing a bright red
      dress with a butterfly brooch. Lovely. </P>
    
    <P> The interview itself is not from &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. God knows why
      such a title was chosen. At any rate, it probably wouldn't have been a
      good idea to identify the interview correctly, because the actual company
      which owns the rights to it--UK's Capital Radio--almost certainly had
      nothing to do with this product. Anyway, the interview was really
      undertaken by Tony Myatt, a longtime friend of Kate's dating from November
      of 1977 when Tony and Capital decided that Wuthering Heights was such a
      great record, they would play it on their station even though its release
      had been postponed for four months. Their early promotion had a &quot;teaser&quot;
      effect on the British public, and helped make Wuthering Heights the
      success it was. This particular interview was, as far as IED knows,
      recorded by Tony at Capital's own studios, but at the Romford Convention
      in November 1985 it was announced that the interview had been conducted
      expressly for the convention itself. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, the interview is one of Kate's very best, and even though Tony's
      questions are frequently very, very silly, his evident affection and
      respect for Kate have the effect of provoking some very interesting and
      emotional answers. It's also a long interview--the second longest that IED
      has ever heard/read. It lasts forty-seven minutes. Finally, the sound is
      superb--almost like a digital recording. Absolutely no hiss, though there
      is a very low-level intermittent buzz from the in-studio equipment. All in
      all, this CD gets an A from IED, and is recommended to anyone wishing to
      hear Kate talking over a broad range of subjects with the thoughtfulness
      and maturity that has distinguished her public conversation since 1985.
      IED paid a rather steep $20.00 for his copy, but it's almost worth that
      much. </P>

    <P>[Bootlegs:] </P>
    
    <P> The sound is abysmal, you're right, Dan, but there are no bootlegs of
      the 1979 concerts that have good sound. Unless you want to count the new
      CD of the Hammersmith Odeon film's soundtrack (from the laser-disk's
      digital re-master). The best-sounding one that includes all the songs and
      incidental bits and pieces is probably the Manchester concert (a two-LP
      set, though only a little less complete than the DT 3-LP set). But they're
      all miserable. Kate never gave any live Tour of Life performances on radio
      or on TV, although a few months later (Dec. '79) she performed a few songs
      live in-studio on her Xmas special. </P>
    
    <P>Also, there are a few clips from other live Tour of Life shows on three
      different TV programmes: the Tour episode of Nationwide (UK TV); a German
      programme called Kate Bush in Concert (which has some songs from the
      Hamburg and Mannheim concerts); and a Swedish show called Rockdrotting
      (with a few songs from the Stockholm concerts). All are in mono TV sound,
      however. It seems pretty clear at this point that no fan was well enough
      equipped soundwise to get a decent in-audience copy of any of Kate's Tour
      of Life concerts. And so far no soundboard mixes or outtakes from the
      unedited Hammersmith film have surfaced in the bootleg market. (An Italian
      fan offered a tape of the Amsterdam concert once, but IED never heard it,
      and anyway it's doubtful that it's any better than the others.) </P>

      KT interview CD that IED described a month or so ago has now re-surfaced
      on vinyl, as a 12&quot; picture-disk. One side features a 1985 publicity
      shot (often seen) of Kate in pink; the other is a nice twist on the TKI
      official picture-disk. It's a photo of Kate in the green body-suit from
      that disk, getting out of a chromium cylinder, but the shot is not exactly
      the same as the one from the official disk. The program is exactly the
      same Tony Myatt interview (47 minutes long) as heard at the Romford
      convention and on the CD. </P>
