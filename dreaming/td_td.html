</P>
<P>&gt; Another point you brought up is that you would be a Kate Bush fan even
if she  didn't make music. My question is, &quot;would you be a Kate Bush fan if
she didn't  sing?&quot; 
</P>
<P>I don't know what you mean. I'd be a Kate Bush fan if she was just a poet
who  wrote her words down on paper, and there was nothing to listen to at all.
Her poetry  is just that good! It's difficult to imagine what Kate's music would
be like if she  hadn't been born with or developed such a wonderful voice. I'm
sure she would  have found some other nearly as good way of expressing herself
though. 
</P>
<P>Or are you saying &quot;Would I be a Kate Bush fan if she didn't have any
lyrics?&quot;? I  certainly would be! It's the music that caught my attention
first, not the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>&gt; You may not agree, but it seems to me that even though &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; is  complicated, layered, and all that other great stuff, if you
took away the vocals, on  most of the songs you wouldn't be left with very much;
the music does not stand on  its own. 
</P>
<P>I'm not sure what you mean here either. The vocals are part of the music.
You  could replace Kate's vocals with a non-vocal instrument and still get
something  great, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>Have you ever heard the instrumental version of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.
All of the lead  vocals are missing. The digerido is missing. Some of the
background vocals are  missing, but some are left in. It's still amazingly
great. I like it as much as the album  version! 
</P>
<P>Also, there are all sorts of non-vocal instrumentals that are just
stunningly great.  The guitar in &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;! The digerido in &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;! Eberhard  Weber's bass in &quot;Houdini&quot; and the violins!
The Planxty stuff in &quot;Night of the  Swallow&quot;, etc., etc.! 
</P>
<P>&gt; I find it really amazing that she was able to do such an interesting,
complex,  layered album without using very much music, since most people rely on
the music  for those things. 
</P>
<P>What's all the complexity, if it isn't music? I think that there's more
music  crammed into all the layers of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; than on any ten
normal albums!  Sometimes when I listen to &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, I ignore
the vocals, and just listen to  the background stuff. Even then there's too much
to be able to absorb it all. Paying  attention to just one instrument can be
really neat, or the interplay between just two.

Subject: Re: What is a digeridu? 
</P>
<P>It is a humongous woodwind! I always thought it was the whistling sound 
though.... but now that you mention it, maybe it's the sound that continues on
into  &quot;Night of The Swallow&quot;. Is that what you think it is? 
</P>
<P>In any case, it's an aborigine instrument, and is basically just a long tube
of wood  that has been hollowed out by termites. There is a special technique
for playing it,  and it requires blowing through it continuously. In order to
play it you have to learn  how to breath in through your nose while
simultaneously breathing out through  your mouth (how this is done, I know not).

</P>
<P>On &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, the digeridu is played by Rolf Harris, who is a
world expert  on aborigine music. He is also the person who did &quot;Tie Me
Kangeroo Down&quot;, but  he's also done at least some really excellent music.
The song &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was  inspired by a song by Rolf Harris called &quot;Sun
Arise&quot; (which was covered by Alice  Cooper, though I haven't heard his
version). If you ever hear the song, you will  imediately recognize the
similarities.

</P>
<P>The breathing technique used to play the digeridu is known as &quot;circular
 breathing&quot; and is used for other instruments as well, including the
trumpet and the  voice. 
</P>
<P>It is possible (but highly difficult and very controversial), and is
generally taught  only at an advanced stage of musical study.

Subject: What a digeridu sounds like 
</P>
<P>Here's something from net.music: 
</P>
<P>&gt; A digeridu makes a noise like god's own bronx cheer -- a cross between
a  hoopie cushion and Mt. St. Helens. 
</P>
<P>Wow! That's a *PERFECT* description of the sound that continues on into  &quot;Night
Of The Swallow&quot;! Now I am completely enlightened! Before I had thought 
that that sound was made by some sort of heavy machinery (since digging machines
 are mentioned in the song &quot;The Dreaming&quot;). I never knew the
Aborigines were into  industrial music....

</P>
<P>Well, I wish people wouldn't make definitive statements (Jon!) without
knowing  the Whole Story. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; rips off its beat from the
song &quot;Sun Arise&quot; by  Rolf Harris, who is the author of &quot;Tie Me
Kangaroo Down&quot;, by the way. Rolf Harris  even appears on the song &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; playing the digerido. Rolf Harris, in turn,  stole the rhythm
from the Aborigines, who use this rhythm quite extensively. Kate  was quite
aware of the origins of the rhythm when she borrowed it from Rolf  Harris. 
</P>
<P>I haven't been able to find a record containing Rolf Harris performing &quot;Sun
 Arise&quot; but I do own an Alice Cooper record where he covers &quot;Sun Arise&quot;.
(I also  have a very poor recording of Rolf Harris's original version from the
radio -- the  beat is exactly the same as on &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.)

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Rolf Harris
</P>
<P>Stephen Thomas asks, in re his and Jeff's transcription project: <BR> &gt;
What was the name of the Rolf Harris song, and what's its significance? 
</P>
<P>The title of the song is indeed Sun Arise. It was a major novelty hit in
England in  1962, or a little later. It was first heard by Kate on the radio
when she was very little,  but her brother Paddy bought the single at some point
thereafter, and the sound of  Sun Arise became firmly ingrained in Kate's
childhood consciousness. On a  December 31, 1980 BBC radio programme she brought
a copy and played it over the  air. The Dreaming's rhythmic pulse, dijeridu
drone, phras-ing--even its imagery of  shafts of sunlight hitting the Aborigine
lands--all are directly influenced by Rolf  Harris's Sun Arise. 
</P>
<P>In the U.S. Harris scored a minor pop hit with another of his characteristic
 Australian recordings of ca. 1962: Tie Me Kangaroo Down. The reason all the 
interviewers raise their eyebrows at the mention of Harris's name in connection 
with Kate's records is that in more recent years Harris has made a quite
different  reputation for himself as a children's television personality. As
usual, their  despicable smugness is undermined by their ignorance.

</P>
<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P>Fiona McQuarrie on Kate sheet music: 
</P>
<P>&gt; I just bought the sheet music book for The Sensual World at a clearance
sale,  and, boy, am I glad I didn't pay full price for it ($30.00 CDN). The
transcriptions of  the songs consist of the melody line and guitar chords. No
bass, no orchestration, only  the barest of &quot;other stuff&quot; (e.g. the
line that runs under the spoken opening of The  Fog). 
</P>
<P> That describes almost every piece of &quot;pop&quot; sheet music I have
ever seen, &quot;Piano  for the One-Fingered&quot; and guitar chords. I have
only seen one true transcription of a  piece of Kate's music; an &quot;electro-acoustic
transcription&quot; of The Dreaming  commissioned by International Musician and
Recording World magazine to  accompany their interview of Kate. 
</P>
<P>It had every part transcribed as completely as possible, including the
sheep's. If  someone has this, GIFs of the pages would make a fine addition to
the archives.

</P>
<P>&gt; Can anyone identify/translate the aboriginal line at the end of &quot;The
Dreaming&quot;? 
</P>
<P>They are lyrics from an Aboriginal song entitled &quot;Aeroplane, Aeroplane&quot;,
which is  perhaps the earliest Aboriginal song about an aeroplane.
Unfortunately, I do not  know what the lyrics are. My source is John Carder
Bush, who when I asked  remembered the source, but not the exact content of the
lyrics.

<P>Date: Wed, 11 Oct 1995 17:08:41 -0500 <BR> From: cbullard@HiWAAY.net (Len
Bullard) <BR> Subject: The Dreaming 
</P>
<P>[Jonathan] 
</P>
<P>|&gt; &quot;The bush&quot; in this context actually refers to those parts of
Australia not yet  covered with desert, mountains, cement, bitumen, open-cut
mines, log trucks, old  nuclear test sites, beach umbrellas, etc. 
</P>
<P>That would have been my guess given the abo context of The Dreaming. 
However, in the interview (which I saw only once about a decade ago), she said
it  was a game they played. Frewer was kidding her about it in a *salacious*
way. It's  been quite a while and I could be wrong. The memory goes as the
pressed byopia  comes. Sigh... droopy eyes and all. 
</P>
<P>Maybe someone out there has a tape of that interview.  I could never find it
again  and it was an interesting bit because he was pressing harder than I have
seen many  do with Kate and she was giving as good as she got. I bet she is hard
to argue with  and get anywhere.
