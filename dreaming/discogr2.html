    <P>News on the Spirit Of The Forest single which features Kate. All of the
      following info is taken from this weeks NME (which also includes a photo
      of Kate!). It is being released on Virgin this week with all profits being
      donated to the Earth Love Fund. It's a double A side recorded with
      different artists singing on each version of the song. Along with Kate the
      following are also on the record; LL Cool J, Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, Donna
      Summer, The Ramones, Little Steven, The B52's, Ringo Starr, Brother
      Beyond, Sam Brown, Fish, Pink Floyd, XTC, Big Country, Kim Wilde, Chris
      Rea, Was (Not Was), Fleetwood Mac, Thomas Dolby, Brian Wilson, Belinda
      Carlisle, Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell, and Olivia Newton-John. There are
      more than 60 acts on the record. </P>

    <P> Well, the twelve-inch is out in Tower here. The song is a pretty
      ordinary bit of quasi-rappified and tame, funkish r&amp;b, a bit like the
      Sun City all-star track that Little Whatsisface put out a couple of years
      back. There's not really much of a song here, properly speaking--not,
      anyway, in the &quot;Do They Know It's Christmas?&quot; sense of the word.
      Kate's own contribution amounts to one little line, sandwiched in between
      other people's so tightly that it's over as soon as you've identified her
      voice. Perhaps the video mix is different, since someone said she takes
      the lead for &quot;a couple of lines.&quot; Anyway, Kate's stylistic
      imprint is scarcely felt. Naturally, she had nothing whatever to do with
      the music, aside from her own line. To be fair, though, there are some
      really touching samples, of animals in distress and buzz-saws cutting
      through the tropical bird-chatter, etc. </P>
    
    <P>It goes without saying that the cause is admirable. Therefore, this
      review is not intended to imply a rejection of the message. This listener
      only criticizes (and mildly) the quality of the music itself. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: live-concert bootlegs </P>
    
    <P> As for there being too many to collect, that's all relative. IED
      understands that there is a bootleg (either on vinyl or tape) for
      virtually every Grateful Dead concert ever given, and that there are some
      Deadheads who have all of them! In comparison, the number of Kate Bush
      live-concert bootlegs is small indeed. IED knows of only the following:
    </P>
    
    <P>1. Wow: a two-record set containing a poor stereo dub of the H-O film's
      audio-track on one disk, and a mono dub of the TV special Kate on the
      other. This is, so far as IED knows, the earliest KT bootleg; it came out
      in 1982 or early 1983. </P>
    
    <P>2. Live in Paris: a single LP containing excerpts from the Paris
      concert. </P>
    
    <P>3. A Bird in the Hand: a single LP containing excerpts (note: only nine
      of the original 12 tracks) from the H-O film's audio-track, in very poor
      stereo. </P>
    
    <P>4. Live in Europe '79-'80: a re-packaged three-LP set containing the
      same three LPs that were originally released as Wow and Live in Paris.
    </P>
    
    <P>5. Moving: a beautiful re-packaging of Wow. Audio quality equally poor,
      however. </P>
    
    <P>6. Temple of Truth: a single LP of excerpts from an unidentified date
      from the Tour of Life. </P>
    
    <P>7. Under the Ivy Bush: a collection of dubs from TV performances and a
      few excerpts from the Mannheim and Hamburg dates of the Tour of Life. One
      LP. </P>
    
    <P>8. Dreamtime: a two-record set containing a complete record of one of
      the London Palladium dates. Probably has the best audio of any of the
      bootlegs (barring the Hammersmith dubs). Best known, however, for the nude
      photos of a Penthouse model named Kate Simmons on the back cover. Note:
      These are not photos of Kate Bush. </P>
    
    <P>9. Passing Through Air: A 2-LP set containing b-sides and re-mixes, all
      of which are dubbed straight off of the official EMI singles and
      12-inches. It also contains a dub of Let It Be as Kate originally
      performed it with Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel at the Bill Duffield
      concert in 1979. </P>
    
    <P>10. If You Could See Me Fly: a single LP containing excerpts from the
      Bill Duffield benefit concert which Kate organized and gave with guests
      Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel. </P>
    
    <P>11. Live in Manchester: a 2-LP set containing virtually the entire
      Manchester concert, albeit in poor audio quality. </P>
    
    <P>12. What Katie Did...: a 7-inch single containing one of Kate's live
      performances of Let It Be and Running Up That Hill from the 1987 Secret
      Policeman's Third Ball (Amnesty International) concerts. </P>
    
    <P>13. Live 1979-1987: the only live Kate Bush CD to date, containing a
      first-rate transfer from the digitally-remixed Japanese laser-disk of the
      Hammersmith-Odeon film, plus Kate's live solo performance of Breathing
      from the 1987 Comic Relief (UK) shows (dubbed from the UK home video), her
      performance of Running Up That Hill (from the official CD release), and
      the film-soundtrack mix of This Woman's Work. </P>
    
    <P>14. Moving: no relation to no. 5 on this list, this is a seven-inch EP
      containing the audio-track from Kate's live performance of Moving at the
      Seventh Tokyo Song Festival, June 1978, and her partially pre-recorded,
      partially live performance of The Beatles' She's Leaving Home and The Long
      and Winding Road, taken off of Japanese TV, 1978. </P>
    
    <P>15. Live in Amsterdam: the only one of these records which IED has not
      seen himself, though he knows that it exists. A single LP containing most
      of the brief Amsterdam concert (curtailed due to Kate's flu). </P>
    
    <P>-- Andrew Marvick </P>
    
    <P>P.S.: Thanks to all those who wished IED a happy birthday today--you
      cheered him up! </P>

    <P>Thanx for the bootleg review. .. but I do have a nit to pick: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; 8. Dreamtime : a two-record set containing a complete record of one

      photos of a Penthouse model named Kate Simmons on the back cover. Note:
      These are not photos of Kate Bush. </P>
    
    <P>This is a 3 record set (I just went and checked). The sides are fairly
      short though, so there's probably not a whole lot more playing time than
      there would be on a double. Your comment re: the sound quality is
      disheartening and sharpens my resolve not to purchase any more KT bootlegs
      (unless I can find the Hammersmith dubs :-) as the quality on this one I
      found quite unlistenable, even compared to many other rough sounding
      recordings I have. </P>

      <BR> Subject: The Abbey Road Interview </P>
    
    <P>&gt; &quot;The Abbey Road Interview&quot; on the back and had a picture
      of Kate sitting on a chair ostensibly talking to someone. </P>
    
    <P> For the record, this CD (which has by far the best sound of any
      recorded interview with Kate anywhere) in fact has nearly nothing to do
      with Abbey Road studios. The interview was commissioned by Homeground and
      Kate expressly for the 1985 International Kate Bush Convention in Romford,
      England. It was conducted by Tony Myatt, a dj (and friend of Kate's who
      was the first dj ever to play Kate's music-- Wuthering Heights in November
      '78, four months before its actual release) for England's independent
      Capital Radio at Capital's own studios. (HG then sent it to Abbey Road for
      mastering, and Peter theorizes that the Abbey Road logo on the master tape
      is the reason for the bootleggers' mis-identification. And this is a
      bootleg, at least in IED's book, since neither Kate, nor Peter, nor Myatt
      had anything to do with its commercial release.) </P>
    
    <P>The same interview was simultaneously released by the same group in the
      form of a 12-inch picture-disk, which features a photo of Kate in a pink
      sweater with a pinkish background on one side. The LP has been much easier
      to find in the L.A. area than the CD, and IED would say that $7-10 for the
      Abbey Road Interview CD is a very good price. </P>

    <P>The Single File </P>
    
    <P>Firstly, the track listing for the video and the title 'Single' (rather
      than 'Singles' - someone queried this) given by DA are correct. &lt;The
      Single File 1978-1983&gt; boxed set is covered in the vine leaves from &lt;The
      Dreaming&gt; back cover, but in a deep grey-green, with all the lettering
      in gold. </P>

    <P>There was (and probably still is) illicit dealing in the TSF singles
      being re-sold individually as the *original* picture sleeve singles (which
      are scarcer, and therefore fetch higher prices). There *are* differences
      between the originals and the re-issues, but they can usually only be
      identified by looking at the record itself; there are numerous differences
      in the arrangement of the lettering on the label, the wording of copyright
      and publication notices, and the typefaces/sizes used; the best guide is
      that only the originals have the hand-written inscriptions in the centre
      (except &lt;Army dreamers&gt;). </P>
    
    <P>Here is a summary of how to identify the originals : </P>
    
    <P>Wuthering Heights

      <BR> Subject: Beatles songs </P>
    
    <P> Evan Welsh writes:
      <BR> &gt;There are three Beatles covers on &lt;a tape of KT demos&gt; as
      well and I get the impression these are performed by the KT Bush Band in a
      pub. Is this hopelessly off the mark, because her voice sounds a bit too
      mature for that ? </P>
    
    <P> Well, a bit off the mark, anyway. Kate has performed three Beatles
      songs, as far as fans are aware (though she may indeed have performed some
      more during her pub-crawling days). Two were performed on Tokyo
      television's Sound in S, during Kate's visit to Japan in June 1978. They
      are: The Long and Winding Road and She's Leaving Home. You can tell that
      these are not simple live performances, because Kate's voice is overdubbed
      toward the end of She's Leaving Home, and there is a small studio
      orchestra backing her. These two tracks appeared last year as the b-sides
      of a seven-inch bootleg of Kate's live performance of Moving from the
      Seventh Tokyo Song Festival (at which Kate won the Silver). </P>
    
    <P>The third song is Let It Be. Kate has performed this song three times in
      all. The first performance dates from May 12, 1979, and is the finale of
      the so-called Bill Duffield concert, a benefit for a lighting engineer who
      was killed immediately prior to the launch of Kate's only tour. That
      version of Let It Be features Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley on alternate
      verses (both Harley and Gabriel had known Duffield). </P>
    
    <P>The second version we know of Let It Be by Kate is also a live
      performance, but this one has David Gilmour trading verses. It dates from
      the 1987 Amnesty International concert called The Secret Policeman's Third
      Ball. Kate's other song from those concerts was Running Up That Hill,
      which appeared on the official LP and CD, but Let It Be only turned up as
      the b-side of another seven-inch bootleg. </P>
    
    <P>The third Kate Bush performance of Let It Be dates from about the same
      time: she sings two lines from the last verse of the song in the Sun
      -Zeebrucke Ferry Disaster benefit single. </P>
    
    <P>IED hopes this answers your question. </P>

      <BR> IED, though he is pretty much of a KompleTist, himself, cannot in
      good conscience recommend to any Love-Hound the purchase of the old
      Greenpeace compilation, if the purpose is simply to obtain the LP mix of
      Breathing. The difference between the single mix and the LP mix is pretty
      much undetectable, at least to IED, though references to both have
      convinced him that they exist. Anyway, doesn't the Never For Ever CD
      contain the LP mix, and doesn't the CD of The Whole Story contain the
      single mix? So why get the Greenpeace CD? </P>

    <P> The Goldmine collectibles article, 1991 </P>
    
    <P> [The following article, annotated by Andrew Marvick, appeared in the
      August 9, 1991 issue of Goldmine, a periodical geared toward record
      collectors. The article was written by Gillian Gaar, a longtime Kate fan
      (of sorts) who first got the attention of other fans through her
      shortlived comic fanzine, For the Love of Kate. The present article was
      written with the assistance of a well-known dealer in Kate Bush
      merchandise, Tom Richards of C-Side Records. Such credentials would lead
      one to expect a first-rate article, but alas! such is not the case. There
      are a number of factual errors in the piece, and a terrible lack of
      organization. Nevertheless, it is of considerable interest to collectors,
      since it is the most recent assessment of the relative value of Kate
      Bush-related merchandise to have appeared in a mainstream publication
      since 1989.] </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush Collectibles </P>
    
    <P> by Gillian Gaar </P>
    
    <P> Though Britain's Kate Bush has been a highly successful commercial
      artist from the release of her first single, Wuthering Heights, in 1978,
      her track record in the U.S. has been surprisingly minimal in comparison,
      with only her fifth album, Hounds of Love, and the accompanying single
      Running Up That Hill cracking the American Top 40 (both peaking at No.
      30). When Bush finally left EMI-America (she remains on EMI in the U.K.)
      and signed with Columbia Records, there was speculation that perhaps this
      corporate giant would be able to break Bush in the states, where she
      maintains a strong underground following. But these hopes did not come to
      fruition; 1989's The Sensual World just missed the Top 40, peaking at No.
      44 in Billboard, and the single Love and Anger didn't chart at all (though
      it did reach No. 1 in Billboard's &quot;Modern Rock&quot; chart). </P>
    
    <P>Still, it's unlikely that this lack of chart success will make any
      diference to collectors, for Bush's collectibility as an artist has
      remained undiminished by the cool reception her work has received in this
      country, a collectibility that extends to virtually anything with a Bush
      connection, and this article will take a look at a wide range of
      collectibles. It's not unusual for items to change hands at prices in the
      hundreds of dollars, and early items continue to increase in value--even
      Bush's debut single, which hardly qualifies as a &quot;rarity&quot;, being
      a No. 1 gold single in Britain, can command as much as $40.00 in its
      original U.K. picture sleeve. [Actually, the original picture-sleeve issue
      of this U.K. single is in fact very hard to come by, and a copy in mint
      condition could bring a great deal more than $40.00. AM] </P>
    
    <P>In fact, as very few Bush songs can be considered rarities, collectors
      have tended to focus on the variations in the releases, particularly the
      singles, where the variations are limitless, encompassing different song
      pairings, covers, etc. Some of the more interesting and unusual releases
      of this type include the Polish &quot;postcard&quot; singles (Moving,
      Saxophone Song and Strange Phenomena, all from Bush's first album, The
      Kick Inside); the Canadian Wow on yellow vinyl and the promo of Symphony
      in Blue on blue vinyl (from Bush's second album, Lionheart); a British
      promo flexi-disk with excerpts from Never For Ever, Bush's third album;
      the Breathing single (from Never For Ever) with a sleeve featuring Bush in
      a &quot;bat&quot; pose released in France, and Germany reversing the
      colors from the British white-mushroom-against-a-black-sky to black on
      white on its version; and Babooshka (also from Never For Ever), released
      as a blue flexi-disk in Russia (there are allegations that this is a
      pirated disk). </P>
    
    <P>The songs Ne T'En Fui Pas and Un Baiser D'Enfant are rarities of a sort,
      having only been released in France, Canada and the U.S., though the
      original mix of Ne T'en Fui Pas appeared on the flip side of There Goes a
      Tenner in the U.K. In Canada, Ne T'en Fui Pas (also spelled &quot;T'enfuis&quot;
      on some releases) [The latter is the correct French spelling. AM] was
      paired with Dreamtime (an instrumental version of the title track of The
      Dreaming [Kate's fourth LP]) and Un Baiser D'Enfant (a French-language
      version of The Infant Kiss from Never For Ever) had Suspended in Gaffa
      (from The Dreaming) as its flip. Both songs also appeared on the mini-LP,
      Kate Bush, in Canada, and were paired together on a single in France; Un
      Baiser D'Enfant only appeared on the U.S. version of the mini-LP. </P>
    
    <P>Most people in the U.S. were probably introduced to Bush when she
      appeared as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on December 9, 1978,
      singing Them Heavy People and The Man With the Child in His Eyes from The
      Kick Inside. The Kick Inside had originally been released in the U.S. on
      EMI's Harvest label in March 1978 (February 1978 in the U.K.), with a
      cover matching the Canadian release, picturing a wide-eyed Bush clutching
      her head. The album was later re-released on the EMI-America label in July
      1978 with a new cover, featuring Bush lounging in jeans and red knee-high
      socks, with the same shot appearing on the Wuthering Heights single-sleeve
      [actually this shot was not exactly the same as the LP photo. AM],
      released as a single at the same time (it had been released in January in
      Britain). Neither Wuthering Heights nor its follow-up, The Man With the
      Child in His Eyes, performed well in the charts, with The Man With the
      Child... eventually peaking at No. 85. Wuthering Heights was reissued in
      1986 on EMI-America's Silver Spotlight Series label b/w Babooshka. </P>
    
    <P>But though these U.S. singles in their original sleeves can sell for
      upwards of $40, the real rarity from this period is Self Portrait: The
      Kate Bush Radio Special. This seven-inch promo disk had Bush introducing
      and discussing four of The Kick Inside's songs, along with two album
      plugs. [This is actually a twelve-inch LP record, not a seven-inch record,
      and Kate discusses more than just four tracks from the album. It is clear
      that the author has not seen the item herself. AM] Packaged in a sleeve
      which also featured the second U.S. album cover, prices for this record
      start at $200 and can go as high as $500. </P>
    
    <P>The Kick Inside was released in at least six different covers worldwide
      (with variations in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Japan, Argentina and
      Yugoslavia), on gray vinyl in Holland, and on CBS's Portrait label in
      Israel. In 1979 it was also released as a picture disk in the U.K. in a
      limited-edition run (which sources have at anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000).
      This disk was later reissued, with the first run worth $150 and the second
      $90. There are several ways to distinguish the original pressing from the
      second: the cover on the original has a round brown sticker identifying
      the record as a picture disk, and the record itself has a thick black rim
      and the words &quot;Remember Yourself&quot; scratched in the run-out
      groove. The second pressing has an oval sticker on the cover, a thinner
      black rim, no message, and the words &quot;Manufactured in the U.K. by EMI
      Records&quot; stamped in the run-out groove. </P>
    
    <P>The release of The Kick Inside was also backed up by heavy promotion,
      and among the many television appearances Bush made was a series of
      performances shot at the Efteling Gardens near Amsterdam in Denmark
      [sic!], with Bush miming to six of the album's songs. Though not
      commercially available, the show has made the rounds in collectors'
      circles on video. Video collectors have proven to be remarkably adept at
      preserving Bush's appearances on the tube, which frequently had her
      performing alternate versions of songs with &quot;official&quot; video
      releases. Her U.S. TV appearances have been infrequent, though aside from
      Saturday Night Live, she has appeared on Night Flight, MTV and VH-1. [The
      subject of Kate's television appearances and their collectibility is an
      enormous and separate one. The glancing reference here to one or two
      individual video clips is frustrating and confusing. See Andrew Marvick's
      more detailed listing of some 110 different Kate Bush video clips, in the
      computer resource, The Garden. AM] </P>
    
    <P>Another unusual appearance in the wake of The Kick Inside was a
      commercial Bush filmed for Seiko watches in Japan, which also put together
      a special promotional package which featured pictures of Bush limited to
      25 copies. Another sought-after release from Japan is a Japanese fan
      club's seven-inch record released in 1985 on red vinyl [N.B.: this was
      originally a red flexi-disk, not a hard vinyl release. AM], with a live
      version of Bush performing Let It Be and a message from her photographer
      brother John Carder Bush. [The live version is actually from a crude
      in-audience tape and is drastically abridged; in addition to John Carder
      Bush's message, the original also included a brief message from Kate. AM]
      This record has been counterfeited, but can be distinguished from the
      original by its accompanying poster sleeve, which folds out into an
      information sheet on the original and a color poster on the counterfeit
      (which is also on green vinyl). </P>
    
    <P>A boot purporting to be Japanese, though it is not of Japanese origin,
      is also in circulation, with live versions of The Long and Winding Road,
      She's Leaving Home and a charity single version of Let It Be. [This
      information is all mixed up. The single in question does not purport to be
      of Japanese manufacture, but it does indeed contain television soundtracks
      of performances Kate gave in Japan in June 1978. The b-side contained the
      two Beatles covers mentioned above, but the a-side featured Kate's own
      song Moving, as performed by her live during the Seventh Tokyo Song
      Festival. </P>
    
    <P>The reference to the song Let It Be is also inaccurate, in that the
      version of the song in which Kate participated during her appearance on
      Japanese television in 1978 was not the same as the recording of the same
      song which was released in Britain in 1987 to aid the families of the
      victims of the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster. Although Kate did add vocals to
      that recording, neither it nor the Japanese version has ever appeared on a
      record with the other two Beatles covers. AM] </P>
    
    <P>In between the release of Lionheart in November 1978 and Never For Ever
      in September 1980, Bush organized her only concert tour to date, the 1979
      Tour of Life. (The tour booklet has since become another in-demand
      collector's item). Bush's first video, Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith
      Odeon, and the EP, Live On Stage, preserved the live performances; EMI
      Home Video has recently reissued the Hammersmith Odeon video (also
      available on laser-disk in Japan). </P>
    
    <P>The EP exists in a variety of formats, and began life as a promo set of
      two 45s in a gatefold sleeve, with a green sticker over the &quot;33 1/3&quot;
      notation on the cover, and is worth $125. The first commercially available
      copy was a single 33 1/3 disk packaged in the same gatefold sleeve, but
      with one of the pockets glued shut: it's worth $30. The second pressing,
      worth $15, was available in a single sleeve. The promo set was also broken
      up into two singles for jukebox play, worth $30 in plain sleeves, or as a
      pair in a single non-gatefold sleeve, worth $15. The four songs have
      appeared in a variety of formats, including a Portuguese twin-pack, a
      twelve-inch disk in France and Holland, twelve-inch and seven-inch disk in
      Japan and Canada, and a German seven-inch. The song Them Heavy People
      fromthe EP was also released in the U.S. as a promo disk. </P>
    
    <P>The first Bush boots were released in the wake of the tour, though with
      only one tour to her credit, the boot market was initially limited to the
      same set of songs being performed at different venues. Wow, a limited
      edition boot on red vinyl, is said to be the first Bush boot, a double LP
      featuring material from the live show and a '79 Christmas special, with an
      appearance by Peter Gabriel singing Here Comes the Flood and, with Bush,
      Roy Harper's Another Day (this is another show popular in video
      collectors' circles). Other Bush boots draw on material culled from live
      TV appearances, guest shots at charity shows, or non-LP b-sides. There are
      also a large number of interview disks, though many are the same interview
      re-pressed on different-colored vinyl. </P>
    
    <P>The existence--or non-existence--of a record entitled The Early Years
      has generated a great deal of speculation among collectors. The record is
      supposed to be an official German release featuring early demos Bush did
      with Pink Floyd' David Gilmour, who brought Bush to EMI. One story says
      the record was withdrawn after release; another claims the record is a
      bootleg; and a third theory suggests that the record doesn't actually
      exist but is really an East German album entitled Amiga (actually the name
      of the record label), a compilation of songs from Bush's first three LPs.
    </P>
    
    <P>The author of a Bush article in the U.K. magazine Record Collector
      claimed to have seen a copy of The Early Years &quot;for about five
      seconds--long enough to say that it looked like an official release, but
      not to memorize the song titles.&quot; [Gaar should have known that a far
      more authoritative and reliable source, namely Peter FitzGerald-Morris of
      the British fanzine Homeground, has confirmed the existence of the album,
      and has even published the titles of its ten tracks. Peter insists,
      however, that he does not own or have access to any copies of the album
      now. AM] </P>
    
    <P>Whatever the truth is about the record, Bush demo material has
      definitely surfaced on two different sets of releases. The Cathy Demos is
      a set of three EPs, each pressed on a different color vinyl (red, yellow
      and green), limited to 600 copies each, and containing a total of
      twenty-two songs--some of these early versions of tunes later officially
      released, but most of them unreleased songs, a goldmine of material for
      Bush fans. [This is inaccurate in two respects: first, there are five EPs
      in the Cathy Demos collection; and second, they total twenty-three tracks,
      not twenty-two. Apparently Gaar has once again relied only on hearsay, and
      has not actually seen the records herself. AM] </P>
    
    <P>Six additional songs appear on Cathy's Album: Home Demo Recordings, and
      Cathy's Album Too, with speculation that the six new songs are the Early
      Years material, as they feature a backing band (the other 22 songs are
      simply Bush and her piano). [Once again, Gaar is misleading her readers.
      The two albums she refers to, which together comprise only 22 of the 23
      solo-piano demo recordings found on the five EPs, also feature six
      additional recordings featuring Kate with back-up by an electric band.
      Five of these six tracks are songs which later appeared (in more polished
      performances) on Kate's first two studio albums, and none of the six are
      in any way related to the ten tracks found on the (now untraceable) Early
      Years LP. AM] Cathy's Album also had a limited-edition run of twelve
      copies, numbered and titled The Sensual Woman. </P>
    
    <P>[These two albums are probably the work of Tom Richards, a dealer who
      helped Gillian Gaar with the material for this article. The early title is
      simply a sticker on the same album known as Cathy's Album. The fact that
      two of the nine photos accompanying Gaar's article are pictures of these
      two products indicates the influence of Gaar's collaborator Richards. AM]
    </P>
    
    <P>The first Bush books were also issued after the tour, with Paul Kerton's
      Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography, and Fred and Judy Vermorel's Kate
      Bush: Princess of Suburbia both published in 1980. Fred Vermorel produced
      another volume, titled The Secret History of Kate Bush (And the Strange
      Art of Pop), which came out in 1983; all three books are now out of print.
      [The last of these three is still widely available, and there is no sign
      that it is out of print. AM] </P>
    
    <P>Perhaps as a reaction against such biographies (many fans find the
      Vermorels' efforts particularly sleazy), the Kate Bush Club, which began
      in late 1978, has made an effort to present members with an excellent
      product; the newsletters are professionally produced and feature a large
      number of photos of Bush (mainly taken by her brother John) and articles
      from the Bush entourage (including Kate, who profiles her new material at
      length on release). They have also offered exclusive items, such as the
      limited-edition prints issued at the time of Hounds of Love's release in
      1985, limited to 1,000 and autographed by Bush. (This is not correct. The
      prints were available not through the KBC but through mail-order forms
      found only in initial U.K. pressings of the album. AM] (The KBC's address
      is P.O. Box 120, Welling, Kent, DA16 3DS, England.) </P>
    
    <P>When The Dreaming was released in 1982, it was also released in the
      U.S., which hadn't bothered to release Lionheart or Never For Ever after
      the failure of The Kick Inside and its accompanying singles. Some sources
      say that Lionheart was released in the U.S. and then withdrawn; the song
      Wow did appear on a sampler featuring upcoming EMI-America releases, and
      Lionheart and Never For Ever were eventually released in the U.S. in 1984
      in non-gatefold sleeves (the original releases were in gatefolds). Though
      no single from The Dreaming (which reached No. 157 in the Billboard
      charts) was officially released, Suspended in Gaffa was released as a
      twelve-inch promo, and the video was plugged into rotation on MTV. [I have
      never seen such a promo twelve-inch, nor have I ever heard that MTV aired
      Suspended in Gaffa's video at any time. AM] </P>
    
    <P>A promo EP featuring four songs from The Dreaming was also released; a
      Canadian sampler issued at the same time (appropriately titled Kate Bush
      Sampler) featured nine songs spanning Bush's career. EMI-America also
      released a test pressing of The Dreaming, limited to five copies, each
      pressed on a different color of vinyl. </P>
    
    <P>And one of the more notorious boots borrowed Dreamtime for its title: it
      was a tree-LP set of Bush's 1979 show at the London Palladium, with cover
      artwork taken from a European Penthouse spread of a nude model named &quot;Kate&quot;
      who bears a slight resemblance to Bush; the spread had appeared shortly
      after Bush's arrival on the music scene in 1978. </P>
    
    <P>Meanwhile, Sat In Your Lap, There Goes a Tenner and the title track were
      released in Britain as singles of The Dreaming (Sat In Your Lap had been
      issued as early as June 1981); Suspended in Gaffa was released in Europe,
      and Night of the Swallow was released as a single in Ireland, capitalizing
      on the involvement of Irish group Planxty. One of the most sought-after
      Bush singles, a counterfeit copy was produced to satisfy &quot;customer
      demand&quot;, and with the first pressing of the single going for $125,
      it's worth looking at how originals differ from the counterfeit. </P>
    
    <P>The first run comes in a glossy picture sleeve, and there is no &quot;-A&quot;
      in the matrix number on the run-out groove. The second run has a matte
      (non-glossy) finish to its stiff sleeve, and the third run has a thin
      paper sleeve with a white band down the left side edge; both second and
      third runs have &quot;-A&quot; in the matrix number. Counterfeit copies
      have a poor xerox-quality sleeve, with a blackish tint as opposed to the
      original's brown coloring. [It's important to note that the original's
      artwork was printed with a deliberately grainy resolution, so that the
      relatively poorer resolution of the counterfeits may be difficult to
      discern without the benefit of direct a-b comparison. AM] The singles can
      be worth up to $125, $85 and $50 for the first, second and third runs, 
      respectively. </P>
    
    <P>In 1983, the mini-LP, Kate Bush, was released in the U.S. and Canada
      (reaching No. 148 in the U.S. charts), with the Canadian version issued on
      six different colors of vinyl. [Also note that the Canadian version
      contained six tracks, the U.S. version only five. AM] In 1984 a boxed set,
      The Single File, was released, with an accompanying video and laser-disk
      (which actually were released in late '83). The boxed set contained all of
      Bush's British singles, from Wuthering Heights to There Goes a Tenner; the
      live EP; and the Ne T'En Fui Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant single; with a booklet
      containing song lyrics. </P>
    
    <P>Promo editions and the first commercial edition of the set had a limited
      edition number in the booklet, and promo copies were also autographed by
      Bush; the second run was unnumbered, but even it can command as much as
      $100 [actually as much as $250! AM], while the numbered sets can run $200
      [Bleecker Bob's has asked for and received $300 for
      less-than-mint-condition copies of these. AM] and the autographed sets
      $300 [I have never seen one of these for sale, but I estimate that $400 or
      even $500 might conceivably be obtained for a copy in mint condition. AM]
      The set was criticized at the time of its release for the poor quality of
      vinyl used, and to compound the problem sets have been broken down, with
      the singles then passed off as originals. </P>
    
    <P>There are a number of ways to distinguish original singles from The
      Single File releases. Originals have glossy sleeves as opposed to the
      matte finish of the reissues [This is not always the case, as with the
      original semi-matte finish of the original release of The Man With the
      Child in His Eyes, for example. AM], and they are also marked with &quot;G&amp;L&quot;
      on the sleeve. Various messages were scratched in the run-out groove of
      the originals, which are missing on the reissues, except in the cases of
      Breathing and There Goes a Tenner (some sources add Army Dreamers to this
      list). The reissues also use LP mixes of the songs instead of the single
      mixes, especially noticeable in the endings of Babooshka and Army
      Dreamers. </P>
    
    <P>Hounds of Love, released in 1985, received a big marketing push in the
      U.S., which extended to promotional items: there were even 100 Hounds of
      Love football jerseys produced, numbered 1 through 100. A special promo
      pack was available in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, which contained the
      album, bio and photos in a white folder tied with a purple ribbon: the
      U.S. version can be worth $150, the Canadian version--which substituted an
      interview album for the Hounds of Love LP--$300, and the U.K. pack,
      autographed by Bush, also worth $300. </P>
    
    <P>Initial runs of Hounds of Love were available on gray marbled vinyl in
      the U.S. (there was even a &quot;marbled cassette&quot; version) and pink
      vinyl in Canada. [The latter is far rarer than the former, and brings much
      higher prices. AM] Running Up That Hill became the first Bush single
      released in the U.S. since The Man With the Child in His Eyes, and it was
      Bush's first twelve-inch single to boot, with an extended mix of the song
      and an instrumental version on the flip in addition to Under the Ivy, the
      b-side on the seven-inch; the U.S. promo limited itself to the single and
      extended mixes of the song. The twelve-inch Running Up That Hill in the
      U.K. was released in a gatefold sleeve [Incorrect: only the U.K.
      seven-inch pressing came initially in a limited-edition gatefold sleeve.
      AM], and the U.K. cassette version of the Hounds of Love album also
      featured the extended re-mix of the song. </P>
    
    <P>The title track and The Big Sky were also released as seven-inch singles
      in the U.S., with The Burning Bridge and Not This Time on their respective
      b-sides. Hounds of Love was also a twelve-inch promo single, with an
      extended version of the song [this was an unauthorized extension of the
      original LP mix, with no input from Bush herself, and released on in the
      U.S. promo. AM], and The Big Sky was a commercially-available twelve-inch.
      Hounds of Love, The Big Sky and Cloudbusting were all released as seven-
      and twelve-inch singles in the U.K., and The Big Sky was also released as
      a seven-inch picture-disk. A video titled The Hair of the Hound was
      released with videos of all four Hounds of Love singles, and is available
      as a laser-disk as well. The picture from the U.K. sleeve of Hounds of
      Love also adorned a Spanish interview picture-disk, which was later
      withdrawn. </P>
    
    <P>1986 saw the release of The Whole Story (Bush's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;
      compilation), and Cloudbusting was finally released in the U.S. in seven-
      and twelve-inch versions to accompany the album's release, though only the
      twelve-inch contained the extended mix of the song (the U.K. twelve-inch
      featured The Burning Bridge and My Lagan Love), and the seven-inch had The
      Man With the Child in His Eyes on its b-side. There was also a promo-only
      CD released with the single and extended versions of Cloudbusting, plus
      The Man With the Child... and Sat In Your Lap. The new single from the set
      was Experiment IV, released as a seven- and twelve-inch single in the
      U.S., with Wuthering Heights (featuring a new vocal) on the b-side and
      December Will Be Magic on the twelve-inch, matching the U.K. versions.
    </P>
    
    <P>The Whole Story also spawned a video release [of the same name] which
      included the Hair of the Hound videos; Experiment IV; Wuthering Heights
      (original vocal); The Man With the Child in His Eyes; a new version of
      Wow; Breathing; Babooshka; Army Dreamers; Sat In Your Lap; and The
      Dreaming. EMI Publishing also released Kate Bush Complete, one of the
      nicer and most comprehensive music books, with the words and music to all
      of Bush's songs through Experiment IV, along with an extensive chronology,
      discography, videography and many photos. </P>
    
    <P>Though Bush did not release another album until 1989, the intervening
      years had her making a number of one-off appearances at charity events, as
      a backing vocalist, or on soundtracks. She had previously sung the title
      song for the U.K. film The Magician in 1979, and Brazil from Terry
      Gilliam's film of the same name (which didn't make the final cut). [This
      is incorrect: Kate was asked to sing a version of the song to an
      orchestral arrangement by Michael Kamen intended for inclusion on a
      soundtrack LP made after the release of the film. The recording postdated
      the film itself by several months. In any event, it was never released.
      AM] Though she turned down the chance to sing the theme song for the James
      Bond film Moonraker, she did contribute Be Kind to My Mistakes for
      Nicholas Roeg's 1987 film castaway (soundtrack on EMI) and This Woman's
      Work for John Hughes's '88 film She's Having a Baby (soundtrack on IRS).
    </P>
    
    <P>Bush's first appearance on a charity single was on Lesley Duncan's Sing,
      Children, Sing, a benefit single for the U.N. Year of the Child Fund,
      released on CBS. She sang Breathing, and Do Bears Sh... in the Woods?, a
      comic duet with Rowan Atkinson, at a benefit show for the Save the
      Children Fund and Oxfam in '86, with an album, Comic Relief, released on
      the WEA Records label; there was also a video release (U.K. only). </P>
    
    <P>She sang Running Up That Hill at the 1987 Secret Policeman's Third Ball,
      with its soundtrack released on Virgin, along with a video release. The
      booleg What Katie Did for Amnesty International also features material
      from the show, and the boot Passing Through Air [N.B.: the vinyl double-LP
      set, not the newer CD, which latter features Cathy demos. AM] has her
      singing The Wedding List at one of the Prince's Trust charity concerts.
      She also appeared on the 1987 benefit single for the Zeebrugge Ferry
      Disaster Fund, joining an all-star cast singing Let It Be, released on The
      Sun newspaper's own label. [Additional charity performances by Bush which
      have appeared in one form or another include the twelve-inch all-star
      single Spirit of the Forest, to benefit the rain forests of South America;
      and the Bill Duffield benefit concert bootleg. AM] </P>
    
    <P>A number of Bush songs have appeared on various compilations, mostly
      U.K.-only, though The Man With the Child... did appear on the EMI-America
      Spinning Pups compilation, and Breathing also appeared on a Greenpeace
      charity album on A&amp;M. Bush has also provided backing vocals for a
      number of artists, most notably Peter Gabriel, on Games Without Frontiers
      and No Self Control from Peter Gabriel III, released in 1980 on Mercury;
      and dueting with him on Don't Give Up, from 1986's LP, So, released on
      Geffen (this song was also released as a seven- and twelve-inch single,
      and Bush appeared in the video, featured on Gabriel's CV compilation).
      [Actually, that compilation included two different videos for that song,
      in both of which Kate appears. AM] </P>
    
    <P>Other guest appearances include Flowers, on Zaine Griff's LP, Figures,
      released in 1982 on Polydor; Them Heavy People, performed by Ray Shell on
      a 1981 single on EMI; You: The Game, Part II from Roy Harper's LP, The
      Unknown Soldier, released in 1980 on Harvest; The Seer, the title track of
      Big Country's 1986 Phonogram LP; The King is Dead, on Go West's Dancing on
      the Couch LP, released in 1986 on Chrysalis; Sister and Brother, from
      Midge Ure's 1988 LP, Answers to Nothing, also on Chrysalis; and an
      appearance on Roy Harper's latest LP, Once. </P>
    
    <P>With the release of The Sensual World LP in 1989, Bush had moved to
      Columbia in the U.S. After deliberation, Love and Anger was released as
      the LP's sole single in the U.S., on cassette only, with Walk Straight
      Down the Middle, available on the CD and cassette versions of the album.
      Love and Anger was also released as a CD-only promo in the U.S. (as were
      The Sensual World and This Woman's Work). The Sensual World was the
      initial single release in the U.K., followed by This Woman's Work and Love
      and Anger. </P>
    
    <P>All three were also available as twelve-inch singles; The Sensual World
      featured an instrumental version of the song on the flip, and the a-side,
      which had a special &quot;double-groove&quot; playing either the extended
      version or the instrumental version, depending on where the needle came
      down, along with Walk Straight Down the Middle. This Woman's Work was also
      released as a seven-inch picture-disk, with Be Kind To My Mistakes [a
      re-mixed and edited version of the soundtrack song. AM] on the flip, and
      I'm Still Waiting on the twelve-inch. Love and Anger's seven-inch (in a
      gatefold sleeve) had Ken (from the Comic Strip film, GLC) on the b-side,
      with two other GLC numbers--The Confrontation, and One Last Look Around
      the House Before We Go--on the twelve-inch. The singles were also
      available as CD-singles. </P>
    
    <P>A CD promo-pack for the album was released in the U.K. and Canada, with
      CD and cassette versions of the release. The U.S. was given the chance to
      catch up on non-LP b-sides through the release of a CD titled Aspects of
      the Sensual World, which featured the LP and instrumental versions of the
      title track; Be Kind to My Mistakes; I'm Still Waiting; and Ken. The
      Sensual World: The Videos was also released, with videos of The Sensual
      World, Love and Anger and This Woman's Work, interspersed with interview
      footage of Bush discussing the songs, taken from a VH-1 special; the video
      is supposed to be set for release on laser-disk later this year. [The
      laser-disk had been available in the U.S for more than six months when
      Gaar's article went to press! AM] </P>
    
    <P>At the end of 1990, the boxed set called This Woman's Work, an anthology
      of her recordings from 1978 to 1990, was released in the U.K. on CD,
      cassette and vinyl configurations. The set was not released in the States,
      due to the rights for Bush's work being split between EMI-America and
      Columbia. For U.S. Kate fans who have had to rely on import services for
      years to complete their collections, this came as little surprise. </P>
    
    <P>The set contained all of Bush's albums except The Whole Story, and
      included a &quot;rarities&quot; collection, featuring Bush's b-sides and
      assorted other tracks (two CDs in the CD boxed set). The set still remains
      incomplete as far as including every Bush track: the instrumental b-sides
      to The Dreaming and Running Up That Hill [as well as The Sensual World.
      AM] were missing, along with the single versions of Babooshka and Army
      Dreamers from Never For Ever. The set did include the tracks from the Live
      On Stage EP, the Ne T'En Fui Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant single, a booklet of
      color photos and stickers. </P>
    
    <P>Recently, two new Bush books appeared on the market, both from Britain:
      Kerry Juby's The Whole Story and Kevin Cann and Sean Mayes's Kate Bush: A
      Visual Documentary. There are also a number of fanzines, the most
      comprehensive being the semi-official Homeground (P.O. Box 176, Orpington,
      Kent, BR5 3NA, England). There are three operating in the U.S.: Watching
      Storms (167 Central Avenue, East Providence, RI 02914), The Big Sky Forum
      (Scott Marcy, 17 Donna Rd., Chelmsford, MA 01824) and Lone Star Lionhearts
      (c/o Sunset Sam Prods., 13414 Capitol Stn., Austin, TX 78711). [See The
      Garden for listings of several other U.S. publications, as well as more
      than a dozen fanzines worldwide. AM] There is also a Canadian 'zine, Still
      Breathing, an offshoot of the controversial Break-Through (11588 72nd
      Avenue, Delta, British Columbia, V4E 1Z1, Canada). </P>
    
    <P>At the 1990 Kate Bush Convention, sponsored by Homeground and held at
      London't Hammersmith Palais, Bush announced her plan to tour at the end of
      1991, in the wake of her next album's release, also set for this fall.
      Given Bush's past manner of working, even the most devoted Kate fan can't
      help but be skeptical about whether these projected dates will be met, but
      the announcement that Kate is even considering a tour is a piece of news
      that her fans will certainly find welcome. </P>
    
    <P>With such a strong cult following clearly evident in the U.S., and with
      prices on any Bush material continuing to rise, it's clear that Bush has
      solidified her position as one of the most collectible artists today, and
      the purchase of nearly any Bush item is a wise investment for the future.
    </P>
    
    <P>Thanks to Tom Richards for additional information. </P>

      and The Garden.] </P>

      Williams)
      <BR> Subject: Goldmine bits... </P>
    
    <P>&gt; In between the release of Lionheart in November 1978 and Never For
      Ever in September 1980, Bush organized her only concert tour to date, the
      1979 Tour of Life. (The tour booklet has since become another in-demand
      collector's item). </P>
    
    <P>The tour booklet was sold at the '90 convention for something like 5#
      each, but it's not quite the same as the original. I have an original (no,
      I wasn't there :-( I got it from Lisa years ago when the KBC still sold
      merchandise) and it included 3 posters. A tour poster, a Moving poster
      (with scenes from the Die Efteling video) and a &quot;Man With The
      Child...&quot; poster (with scenes also from the DE video). They were
      folded and fit right into the folder along with the booklet. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Some sources say that Lionheart was released in the U.S. and then
      withdrawn; </P>
    
    <P> It was. We have both versions. We also have what we were told are
      original US Lionheart posters. We bought them from Scott Shepherd (sp?) at
      the Winnipeg Bush-Con '84. They are truly beautiful! </P>
    
    <P>The story we heard was that EMI-America decided to release Lionheart,
      and printed up LPs and posters and then when the brass changed their
      minds, most of them were *burned*!!!! Quite a few copies had already been
      circulated though so some were spared. </P>
    
    <P>Vickie (one of Vickie'n'Chris) </P>
    
    <P>* I doubt that Ed's fingers have completely recovered from all the
      typing he did after the release of TSW. Ron Hill will probably never
      recover! Did the three of you compare aching-finger stories at Katemas?

    <P>Date: Sat, 31 Aug 1991 11:13:44 -0700
      <BR> From: ed@wente.llnl.gov (Ed Suranyi)
      <BR> Subject: Letter reply to Goldmine article </P>
    
    <P>The new issue of Goldmine just came out (Sept. 6), and in it there's a
      letter from Steven McDonald about the Kate article that appeared two
      issues ago. He mentions love-hounds. Here it is, with my comments: </P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush Additions </P>
    
    <P>Compliments on Gillian Gaar's nicely done article on Kate Bush --well
      handled, though with one or two missed moments that no doubt have plenty
      of fans writing in with corrections. Even though I'm not the best of Kate
      scholars, I've lived long enough with a Kate fan (and additionally have
      encountered more via the Music RT, where we have a very active Kate Bush
      topic that I began in January 1990). So, here's some loose and assorted
      notes for you.. . </P>
    
    <P>1) Not only was the boxed set incomplete in terms of the two
      instrumentals noted, it also fails to include the single mix of &quot;This
      Woman's Work&quot; and also lacks the last track from the &quot;Love And
      Anger&quot; 12-inch and CD single -- another from the &quot;GLC&quot;
      episode of the Comic Strip, this one titled &quot;Last Look Around The
      House Before We Go.. .&quot; [Actually, if I remember right, this track IS
      in the boxed set. Is my memory playing tricks on me? -- Ed] </P>
    
    <P>2) Kate has appeared as an actress in at least two projects, one of them
      for the Comic Strip. Her music has also been used in Miami Vice (in the &quot;Bushido&quot;
      episode) and other places. [What was the other acting role for Kate? --
      Ed] </P>
    
    <P>3) Peter Gabriel's CV video compilation includes two versions of &quot;Don't
      Give Up,&quot; one featuring an abstract compilation of footage with
      Depression elements, the second a rather warm and sweet version with Kate
      and Peter standing on a turntable in each other's arms, heads resting on
      each other. </P>
    
    <P>4) The 12-inch single for &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; released in the
      U.K. is not a remix, it's a completely different version altogether,
      startlingly so. It was during this period that Kate also took over
      directing her own videos and changed her style completely. </P>
    
    <P>5) The Kerry Juby book is an unauthorized bio, reputedly very inaccurate
      and is widely repudiated by Kate fans and associates both. Most of them
      own a copy, however. </P>
    
    <P>6) The Saturday Night Live performances have been barred from
      circulation. Though the shows they're incorporated into are in wide
      syndication and have been reissued several times on videotape, the footage
      of Kate has not been seen since the rerun, except in bootleg form.
      [Recently, MTV Europe ran the whole show, including the Kate parts. It is
      therefore possible to get a very nice transfer from PAL to NTSC now, far
      better than the zillionth generation copies most of us have had to put up
      with until now. -- Ed] </P>
    
    <P>7) &quot;Do Bears.. .&quot; was not on the Comic Relief album, just the
      videotape. It's a shame, really, as Kate seems to have had a lot of fun
      with the number. Her performance of &quot;The Wedding List&quot; in The
      Prince's Trust Rock Gala is widely available on an MGM/UA videotape and is
      notable for a backing band that includes Pete Townshend, Midge Ure and
      Mick Karn. [Also Phil Collins on drums. This doesn't seem to be as widely
      available now as it once was. -- Ed] It's also notable for the fact that
      Kate broke both of the spaghetti straps on her top and completed the
      number with a huge smile and one arm clamped firmly across her chest.
      [Actually, only one strap, the left one, broke. -- Ed] </P>
    
    <P>8) The boxed set again. Big beware here -- there's a U.K. edition, a
      Canadian version and a Japanese edition. The Canadian is more or less the
      same as the U.K. version, but can be had more cheaply. [As far as I know,
      the Canadian version IS the U.K. version, just imported by the record
      company. The difference between that and the situation in the USA is that
      here the set is imported by individual record stores, if they want it. --
      Ed] The Japanese version eliminates the Kate stickers but includes a
      second booklet that features the lyrics to the songs on the combination
      discs, along with more pictures. [The organization is somewhat different
      than the way he describes, but he's got the gist --Ed.] The mastering is
      reputedly a bit better, but that may be snobbery speaking (the U.K. discs
      for the first three albums, by the way, are vastly better than the
      domestic releases; mastered from the source, it seems, not run from album
      master). The real sore point is the U.K.-only vinyl set, in demand for the
      full-sized artwork and booklet. Aside from the shoddy vinyl and cheap
      cardboard (the vinyl, I gather, is thin and noisy) the LP boxes are often
      incomplete, missing booklets, stickers and albums, sometimes with two or
      three copies of one album and none of the others. The most common note
      about This Woman's Work is the disappointment felt by many fans that the
      set didn't really go far enough. </P>
    
    <P>9) Moonraker -- Actually, she hemmed and hawed and backed out at the
      last second, which resulted in a very rushed title track sung by Shirley
      Bassey. I think I'd rather have had Bassey from the start. </P>
    
    <P>10) Tour of Life boots. Avoid like the plague: consistently wretched
      material, even worse than usual. [It's true that the sound quality, which
      is what I assume he's talking about, is miserable. But it's the only way
      you can hear the original version of &quot;Egypt&quot;, which is very
      different from the final version and, I think, really great. -- Ed.] </P>
    
    <P>11) Tour and album plans. The latest word now is the first single by
      December and a tour that would be a limited set of shows in the U.K. as
      well as on the East and West coasts of the U.S. [Well, we'll see -- Ed.]
    </P>
    
    <P>12) Fanzines and the like. There used to be one called Under The Ivy a
      couple of years ago, but that appears to have expired quietly. The fan
      club magazine is pretty good when it comes out (coinciding with albums or
      other major activity) and Homeground is good, if fannish (unmitigated
      worship gives me hives). </P>
    
    <P>However, there's two other places to look for fan activity, and they
      move a hell of a lot faster than the print medium -- Rec. Music Gaffa
      [aparently the editor of Goldmine didn't know exactly what to do with &quot;rec.music.gaffa&quot;.
      -- Ed.], a newsgroup on USENET (a loose information network connecting
      hundreds of universities and individual computer systems worldwide) that's
      the home of &quot;Lovehounds,&quot; [ditto for &quot;love-hounds&quot; --
      Ed.] a computer-based group within the main Gaffa group [Huh? -- Ed.];
      there's also GEnie (sm), General Electric's Network for Information
      Exchange, and its Music Round Table, wherein you'll find Category 11,
      topic 2 dedicated to Kate (along with numerous files in the librairies,
      including the only known review of the &quot;Aspects&quot; CD5, contrary
      to Homeground 's cmplaint that nobody out there had reviewed it: Online
      Digital Music Review did). [ Goldmine itself did also. -- Ed.] One of our
      participants runs a Bulletin Board System called The Big Sky, another is
      assembling a massive project called &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; essentially
      a compilation of Kate Bush talking about Kate Bush, her life and her work.
      Both USENET and GEnie (sm) are accessed via computer, modem and
      telecommunications software. For info in GEnie call (800) 638-9636 voice.
    </P>
    
    <P>Hope there's something useful in this letter. Me, I'm just a music
      loving sysop (and musician who's proud of the Music RT and how many times
      Goldmine gets mentioned -- as it should, being an excellent magazine.
      Billboard is all well and good, but Goldmine and ICE are regular visitors
      at Chez McDonald (if not at BPS in Topeka). </P>

      <BR> From: ed@wente.llnl.gov (Ed Suranyi)
      <BR> Subject: Another Kate letter in Goldmine </P>
    
    <P>The new issue of Goldmine (Sept. 20) includes *another* letter about the
      Kate article that appeared last month. Here it is: </P>
    
    <P>Kate from Canada (and Elsewhere) </P>
    
    <P>Thanks for the most interesting article covering the recording career of
      Kate Bush. In addition to those facts and recordings listed in the
      article, the following is a nice complement to the article. </P>
    
    <P>Canada has been a great source of collectibles when it comes to Kate
      Bush. The first single released in Canada was the same as in the rest of
      the world, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; on Harvest. The difference from
      the other versions of the song is that this is a 3:33 edit, cutting out a
      major part of the ending instrumental. The next single, &quot;Man With The
      Child,&quot; again had a regular issue in Canada. [It did in the US also.
      In fact, it even got on Billboard's singles chart, peaking in the
      eighties. -- Ed] Later it was reissued (from the Whole Story LP) with a
      unique sleeve. The song this time was backed with &quot;Sat In Your Lap.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>The two colored vinyl 45s released in Canada as mentioned in the article
      have become highly sought-after items. The yellow vinyl &quot;Wow&quot;
      single came in black title sleeve. &quot;Symphony In Blue&quot; also had a
      regular release in addition to the promo copy mentioned. It was also in
      blue vinyl. The seven-inch version of the Live At The Hammersmith EP was
      housed in a 12-inch cardboard sleeve that the EP fit into. The EP had a
      fold-open sleeve like the first editions in the U.K. </P>
    
    <P>The Canadian releases for &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;Ne
      T'enfuis&quot; [sic] were both included with sleeves, the French version
      sleeve being the same as the French single release except that the picture
      on the front was flipped. [I don't understand this. Could this sentence be
      a typo for &quot;..., the Canadian version sleeve being the same...&quot;?
      -- Ed] </P>
    
    <P>In addition to the above-mentioned differences, Canada is home to the
      following: The 12-inch version of &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; has for its
      B-side the songs from the U.K. version of &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; which
      never saw a Canadian release. Hounds of Love, in addition to the pink
      vinyl album, also came in a multi-colored cassette. Both the regular and
      colored version of the cassette had the 12-inch of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
      added. [I may be wrong, but wasn't it the extended version of RUTH? -- Ed]
      The Columbia Record Club version of the cassette is just a straight U.S.
      reissue omitting the extra cut. The final rarity from Canada is the CD
      version of the Sensual World album, which as a picture disc with the
      picture from the &quot;Sensual World&quot; single imprinted on the disc
      itself. </P>
    
    <P>Japan has also had its share of unique picture sleeves for its 45
      releases. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; came in a sleeve identical to the
      Japanese sleeve for the Kick Inside LP. &quot;Symphony In Blue&quot;
      pictures Kate on a dolphin. &quot;Man With The Child&quot; has Kate in a
      mirror pose in a yellowish dress. </P>
    
    <P>Other countries that released unique 45 sleeves not mentioned in the
      article were Poland for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (same as the U.S.
      sleeve for the second version of the LP) and for &quot;Man With The child,&quot;
      Holland for different colors on the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; single,
      Belgium for the &quot;Man With The Child&quot; single, and Italy with a
      different sleeve for &quot;Wow.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Finally, most of the releases of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; had a
      sleeve unique to the country of origin. If not a completely different
      sleeve from the U.K. version then the back was unique to the country of
      origin. This makes each sleeve collectible. </P>

      <BR> From: ed@wente.llnl.gov (Ed Suranyi)
      <BR> Subject: Yet another Goldmine letter </P>
    
    <P>The new issue of Goldmine (Oct. 4) has yet another letter in reply to
      that long Kate article from a while ago. Well, strictly speaking, it's
      actually a reply to a previous reply. Here it is: </P>
    
    <P>Correction to Kate Correction
      <BR> I'd like to offer a correction to Steven McDonald's corrections to
      Gillian Gaar's article on Kate Bush. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Do Bears...&quot; *is* on European copies of the LP Comic Relief
      Utterly Utterly Live! At The Shaftsbury Theatre (WEA Records Ltd. WX 51
      [U.K.], WE 381 [France], just as Gaar says. </P>
    
    <P>I have a copy. Terrific article, by the way.
      <BR> -- Bill Ruhlmann New York, NY </P>
    
    <P>The editor responds:
      <BR> A few people wrote in to say their copy of Comic Relief has the
      song, so if anyone's got a rarity here, it's Steven McDonald -- ed. </P>

    <P>April Record Collector: there's a feature by Nev &amp; Jon of Never for
      Ever about Kate's session work and collaborations (she's even on the front
      cover). Also an ad from C-Side Records for &quot;The Can&quot;, which is a
      bit naughty coz RC expressly forbids ads for bootlegs. Scott Telford </P>
