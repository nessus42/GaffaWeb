<P>Well, the latest issue (#23) of *Homeground*, &quot;the International Kate
Bush  Fanzine&quot; arrived a few days ago and there's some new news: 
</P>
<P>Kate is now working on her next album. She hopes to begin recording very 
shortly and the target date for completion is sometime next Spring (and if you 
believe that one, I have a very nice Orgone Accumulator for sale, real cheap.) 
</P>

<P>You'd be well advised not to expect KBVI earlier than 1989. That's IED's 
opinion, anyway. We should be grateful for the delay, since every month is
testimony  to Kate's continuing perfectionism.

<P>IED has a tiny bit more concrete information to give you all as a guideline
for this  topic, through the courtesy of the new issue (#28) of Homeground, &quot;The
 International Kate Bush Fanzine&quot;. 
</P>
<P>It says that according to people &quot;close&quot; to Kate (i.e., probably
Del or Paddy, with  whom the HG crew are quite chummy now, IED thinks), there
are now seven tracks  in a &quot;nearly complete state&quot;, and &quot;many&quot;
of these seven are &quot;'up-tempo'&quot;. 
</P>
<P>So now, folks -- give your imaginations free reign. IED is waiting to read
your  ideas: What's KBVI going to be like?

<P>From: KNIGHT%MAINE.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU (Michael Knight) <BR> Date: Thu,
31 Dec 87 00:56:46 EST <BR> Subject: New Kate Bush Interview. 
</P>
<P>Here is [an excerpt from] the interview from the new Kate Bush Club 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>Q. How is the new album going? 
</P>
<P>A. Well, as usual it is slow but I keep writing new songs as I feel the urge
and I now  have lots of songs but most of them have pieces missing or sparse
lyrics and  sorting these things out takes a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>Q. How are you approaching this album, is it different from the last one? 
</P>
<P>A. Again I am working straight onto master tape in out home studio, as I get
ideas I  put them onto tape.. sometimes this causes more problems because I'll
like parts  of it and not others but I try to re-do as little as possible.. I
like to try and keep  the performances quick and spontaneous, it's the sorting
out of these  performances afterwards and the rethinking of structure or
arrangements that  take the time. Each musician changes the feel of the track
dramatically and it's  important to keep the track moving in the right direction
and to communicate  what is wanted whic in my case is achieved through images,
humming lines and  letting the musicians do what they feel is right and saying
if I don't like it.. it  seems to have worked so far and I always find musicians
so imspiring. Quite often  they'll put an edge to the track that gives it
greater potential so I sit and rethink  bits again. The tracks continually
change and yet the original &quot;feeling&quot; goesn't  seem to.. I'd like to
think that by putting the initial &quot;muse&quot; onto tape.. we've  captured
it's soul.. so that whatever we put on top of it, it is in essence the same. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>Q. When will the album be finished? 
</P>
<P>A. Umm...... 
</P>
<P>Q. When do you think it will be finished? 
</P>
<P>A. Umm......

<P>Kate is filming videos now. She's also working on the tour, and is deep in 
training. The album's been finished for a couple of months now already. She will
 release the first single in September, and the album will follow in October,
along  with the first video. Kate will not come to the U.S. for a promotional
interview tour  this time. In fact, she'll do less promotion in the UK, too, and
do as much as possible  in a much shorter period of time than for HoL. Since all
the follow-up singles and  videos will already have been done in advance, she
will therefore be able to resume  training and rehearsals for the tour within
three or four months following the  release of the album, say by the beginning
of March. After another two or three  months, perhaps by about June 1, Kate will
announce the dates of the Tour of Life II,  which will begin in October and
continue throughout the world until the first of the  year.

<P>from the latest (32nd) issue of &quot;Homeground&quot;: 
</P>
<P>There is no truth to rumours about a title for KBVI. So far as &quot;HG&quot;
knows (or is  letting on), no title has been chosen yet. Furthermore, &quot;HG&quot;
is maintaining that the  album has not yet been completed, quoting (as usual
without identifying the  obviously inside source) someone as saying that it is &quot;progressing
very positively,&quot;  whatever that means. IED is personally convinced that
this is just a big smokescreen,  that the album was finished quite a while ago,
and that Kate is busy filming videos  and working up a live show. Anyway, the
release is now hoped for sometime in the  spring.

</P>
<P> Well, here's some bad news for Kate Bush fans (or at least for those who
have a  membership in the Kate Bush Club). Yesterday IED received in the mail a
glossy  greeting card from the Club. The cover featured some typically
professional (and  slick and bland) artwork by Debi Bowes, whose multi-media
drawings should be  quite well known to Kate fans who were readers of
Break-Through or who carry a  current subscription to Home-Ground. Apparently
Debi was actually commissioned  by the KBC to design the present card, which was
produced to the highest  commercial standard. 
</P>
<P>The message inside, printed in the HoL italic typeset which Kate fans know
well,  carried only the following message, unsigned: 
</P>
<P>Sorry for the long silence but as you probably realise Kate is still very
busy  working on the album. For this reason there is no news to tell you and no
new  photos available so for the foreseeable future we will only be producing
one bumper  magazine per year -- this will contain lots of colour photos and
interesting articles.  The next issue will be produced to coincide with the
release of the album but there  is no projected  date for this at present.

<P>For all those whose renewal was due from August '88 onwards, please do not 
renew until you receive the next magazine.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Trio bularKa on american
television 
</P>
<P> On another Kate-related note: Trio Bulgarka, the trio of female Bulgarian
folk  singers who are currently on tour in the U.S. with their parent-group, the
Radio  Sofia/Bulgarian National Women's Choir, appeared tonight on the NBC
late-night  show Michelob's Sunday Night. The three women (Yanka Rupkina,
Stoyanka Boneva  and Eva Georgieva) joined the tour directly following their
work in London where  they recorded a solo album by Yanka and collaborated with
Kate Bush on two of  Kate's new tracks, at least one of which will be included
on KBVI (which is now  promised for April). 
</P>
<P>The three women are of different ages. Eva is a strapping white-haired woman
 who sings in the lowest range; Stoyanka, a soloist in her own right in
Bulgaria, sings  the middle parts usually; and Yanka, who is at least a few
years younger than the  others (i.e., about forty to forty-five), sings most of
the &quot;lead&quot; or high parts. Yanka is  also a very beautiful woman. They
performed in their usual full Bularian traditional  dress (complete with
wind-chime-laden headdresses that tinkled on Yanka's head  quite audibly during
their otherwise unaccompanied performance). 
</P>
<P>They sang three songs, including Strati Angelaki, of which Kate recently
said: &quot;If  they sing Strati Angelaki to me I can't take it. I have to leave
the room. It just  makes me cry; and there are very few things musically that
affect me like that.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It was great. And on American TV ! Amazing how the music of a sophisticated 
popular culture like Bulgaria's can go unnoticed for centuries in the West, and
then  with a little clever yuppie marketing, it suddenly becomes chic. But it
really doesn't  make any difference how it came to click here. Just to be able
to see Yanka Rupkina  sing a single song on U.S. TV is compensation enough for
all the hype. Incidentally,  the Trio Bulgarka's latest album (and their first
on their own in the West), called  The Forest is Crying, is out on CD (the
Hannibal label). It is incredibly neat.

<P>Date: Sun, 07 May 89 16:12 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Balkana: a report of a live
concert featuring Yanka Rupkina 
</P>
<P> Last night the Bulgarian musical ensemble called Group Balkana performed in
 Santa Monica, California, and IED was there to experience. Balkana is a small
group  of musicians from Bulgaria, featuring five male instrumentalists and
(ordinarily)  three female vocalists. The three women also perform and record
under the group  name Trio Bulgarka. As Balkana these musicians recorded an
album (which  featured a few additional musicians who were not part of the group
proper)  co-produced by Joe Boyd, and it was through Boyd, L-Hs may recall, that
Kate Bush  was able to make personal contact with Trio B. 
</P>
<P>On this occasion unfortunately Eva Georgieva, the eldest of the three
members of  Trio B., was not present, for what reason IED could not
discover--no-one in the  Balkana outfit apparently speaks a word of English, and
no interpreter was present!  Anyway, the Trio B. became the Duo B. last night,
but the effect was still magical at  times. Balkana's instrumentalists
alternated with the women for about half the  numbers, and worked together for
the other half. And twice Yanka Rupkina, the  soprano (and looker) of the group
came out to sing solo and a cappella. In that  conformation she sang Kalemankou
Denkou, and with Stoyanka Boneeva (the other  half of Duo B.) she sang a
stunning two-part a cappella version of Strati na Angelaki.  Yanka made at least
three costume changes throughout the evening, each traditional  outfit more
spectacular than the last. The fixed but apparently genuine smiles on  both
women's faces never faltered throughout the 90-minute show. 
</P>
<P>Yanka's voice is still in perfect condition, and she was in top technical
form--as  flawless as on the albums, but with several moments of unexpected
free-floating  improvised melismatics that must have been developed since the
date of the songs'  original recording. Stoyanka's voice is a bit weaker, and
much lower, of course, but  she has rock-solid pitch and sang with tremendous
feeling. The instrumentalists  were obviously masters at their peculiar
Bulgarian instruments, and the  drum-player, who performed a few comic dance
antics and generally provided light  relief (albeit without language), looked a
bit like Curly of the Three Stooges. A very  light-hearted group, though their
inability to communicate verbally in such a small  and informal setting
(McCabe's Guitar Shop) necessarily constrained the  gemutlichkeit a bit. Still,
a richly satisfying concert. 
</P>
<P>IED had planned to speak with Yanka and Stoyanka after the concert, and 
actually was allowed upstairs to do so, but it became clear from another visitor
who  preceded him that anything like normal conversation was simply not going to
be  possible. IED was somewhat in awe of Ms. Rupkina anyway. Though grey-haired
and  a bit &quot;long in the tooth&quot;, she remains an extremely attractive
woman; and that  voice...! 
</P>
<P>Anyway, IED has no doubt any longer about roughly what the collaborative
effort  between Trio B. and Kate must have consisted of. Kate said she &quot;wrote
choir parts&quot;  for the women to sing, and Trio B. said they &quot;added
harmonies&quot; to them. It became  apparent to IED, after having heard them,
that Trio B. simply took the parts which  Kate had composed in &quot;choir&quot;
harmonies for them on the Fairlight in advance, and in  the course of singing
the parts, they added the elaborate filigree of  enharmonically-based vocal
melismas to them. The style of Trio B. (as of all the  Balkana musicians) is
quite marvellous, but also quite static and consistent. They do  one and only
one thing, though they do it consummately. 
</P>
<P>There can be little doubt, therefore, that Kate knew exactly what she wanted
and  what she would be able to get from the Trio B. All of the &quot;harmonies&quot;--as
we  Westerners know the term--were created by Kate. But all the enharmonics
--which  the Trio B. might well consider &quot;harmonies&quot;--were then added
by the Bulgarians, as  a matter of course, and according to Kate's plans. None
of this enlightens IED as to  the possible meaning/origin of any
Bulgarian-language lyrics on KBVI, should there  be any, but for now at least
his curiosity is satisfied as regards the KT/Trio B.  musical meld itself. 
</P>
<P>If Balkana is visiting your area any time soon, don't miss them.

<P> Kate finished the album one week ago today. It's in the can. The album will
 definitely be released in September. This is straight from John Carder Bush's 
mouth, this very afternoon. 
</P>
<P>No, IED is not at liberty to explain how he knows this, he just does. He may
be  able to provide more details soon, however. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, L-Hs is the Kate Bush news source, know that? What with this
info  and the complete demo lyrics and tape project, L-Hs has all the fanzines
shot to hell.  We should give some thought to going into a print edition. 
</P>
<P>If the pattern is the same as for earlier albums, then Kate will take a
one-month  vacation around this time, before beginning work on the preparation
for the first  single release. IED doesn't have any concrete information about
anything like that,  however. But this news does not augur well for a tour, at
least as far as IED can tell.  Because she has already said (through Homeground
) that she plans to shoot the  videos for the first three singles before the
album is actually released this time. IED  doesn't know how she's going to be
able to do even that by September, not if it  takes the six weeks of preparation
and shooting and postproduction per video that  Cloudbusting and Hounds of Love
took. But again, it's pointless to speculate. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, everyone who was still wondering--count on it: September it is. In
fact,  plan your vacations around it! With the album out this fall, it's quite
likely that  there'll be an official HG -KBC convention sometime around
November, just like  last time. Wouldn't it be neat for a bunch of us American
fans to go over there  together? 
</P>
<P>Anyway, it's fun to dream about these things.

the bad 
</P>
<P>IED has this information from Love-Hounds's Chief British KorrespondenT,
Neil  Calton, who relays the information straight from the 35th and latest issue
of  Homeground. Part of the information is good, and part is bad. 
</P>
<P>First, the good: We now know the title of the new album! It is: 
</P>
<H1 ALIGN="center">   T h e   S e n s u a l   W o r l d . 
</H1>
<P>Also good: the date which IED announced three weeks ago has been confirmed: 
the album will be released this September, and the first single will be in shops
in  mid-August ! That's only four weeks from now ! 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>To return on the up-note which began this posting, IED feels it is worth 
mentioning that the term &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, which Homeground reports
is to be  the title of Kate Bush's sixth studio album, is also the title of a
series of twenty-four  books by the English writer Rupert Croft-Cooke (born in
1903, still living, to IED's  latest information). If this should turn out to be
a deliberate reference, and not  simply a co-incidence (and the latter is not
likely, given the thoroughness with which  Kate plans things like titles), it
will put a very intriguing new twist on Kate's  ideological and aesthetic path.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: The Sensual United States 
</P>
<P> Well, earlier Love-Hounds reports of a delayed release of Kate's new album
in  the U.S. have been confirmed by IED in L.A., too: The Sensual World has been
given  an October 17th in-store date by the Hollywood publicity office of CBS
Records. No  word on when the single (which will have the same title as the
album) is due in the  U.S.--or even if that will be the single that CBS puts
out. 
</P>
<P>IED must say that Kate's decision to switch to CBS is hard to
understand--the  company has a very poor history when it comes to promoting
challenging artists in  the U.S., and they very rarely do anything beyond the
ordinary in the way of  advertising campaigns. Now the news that they aren't
even going to plan a  simultaneous release with EMI (which retains control over
the album's release  throughout the rest of the world) adds more reason for us
to worry. 
</P>
<P>The fact is, EMI-America did a remarkably good job of promoting Hounds of 
Love, at least compared to the typical rock album. Limited-edition color-vinyl
LPs  and cassettes, a very wide-spread print-ad program, a ton of posters (at
least in this  town), and even some success getting the videos aired. Sure, it
could have been a lot  better, but IED shudders to think what CBS will do (or
not do) to promote The  Sensual World --especially when he considers how
extremely important it is that  this album sell well, if there is to be any
chance of luring Kate into a U.S. tour  within the next eighteen months. 
</P>
<P>Ah, well. There is at least one silver lining--when a new album is delayed 
domestically, it puts more pressure on independent record stores to get in the 
imports to cover the gap. Thus our chances are increased of getting hold of the 
import CD-singles, 12&quot;s and even cassettes before the (inevitably
poor-quality) U.S.  versions start clogging up the works.

<P>Vickie alerted IED to one other extremely neat little synchronicity (or is
it more  than that?) in the New Musical Express article about Kate's work with
Trio  Bulgarka from last December 12. IED simply quotes the relevant paragraph
(italics  added): 
</P>
<P>&quot;Down at the old Bul' and Bush&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush and Yanka Rupkina sit on a bean-bag couch and sing to me,
Bulgarian  style; Rupkina bleating high and joyous above Bush's harmony. 
</P>
<P>Short but sweet, a brief musical meeting of East and West, it's the sort of
sensual  aural treat every philanthropist would wish to share with the World.
Except that the  World would have been pushed to fit in this studio broom
cupboard off Upper  Street, Islington. 
</P>
<P>Make up your own minds--does this mean the first single will be one of the
Trio  B. collaborations? Or could it mean that the album itself had already been
given its  title (what Kate has said always comes last, after the LP is
completed) last  December--which would be a very hopeful sign that the past year
has been spent  working up a concert programme and videos, not the album itself?

</P>
<P>&gt; From: peter@xal (Peter Freeman) <BR> &gt; Second, I wish people would
get their minds out of the gutter about Kate's  decision for her next album
title. &quot;Sensual&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;sexual&quot;; 
actually there are a number of meanings but I think the one she is aiming at
here is  more along the lines of &quot;sensory&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I wish you'd get your mind IN the gutter! Kate has all sorts of SEXUAL --
not  just &quot;sensory&quot; allusions in her music -- some subtle and some not
subtle at all. I  think the fact that Kate has refered to &quot;Night of the
Swallow&quot; as &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot;  should speak for itself on where
Kate thinks your mind should be!

<P>[Should have posted this sooner, but I felt sure someone else would get
there  first...] 
</P>
<P>From the September issue of the British magazine &quot;Q&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World, Kate Bush's first new album in four years will be
released  on October 16. Produced by Bush and Del Palmer, the album features
contributions  from Dave Gilmour, Nigel Kennedy, Eberhard Weber, Davy Spillane,
Alan Stivell and  The Trio Bulgarka.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now who's Alan Stivell? 
</P>
<P>Interesting to note the Dave Gilmour appearance - he's been getting around a
bit  lately as a session artist (surely he can't need the money!:-). Another
recent album  which he features on is Sam Brown's (daughter of &quot;lovable
cockney rock-'n-roller&quot;  Joe Brown) &quot;Stop!&quot;. He plays guitar in
inimitable style on two tracks, although I have  heard that they never actually
met, with DG doing his bit on tape in New York. He  was also on another album
which I bought recently, but I'm not too sure which one  - might have been Judie
Tzuke's &quot;Turning Stones&quot;.

<P>Alan Stivell is a British (?) Celtic Harp player. 
</P>
<P>He has four albumns that I know of: 
</P>
<P>1. The Renaissance of the Celtic Harp. 
</P>
<P>2. Celtic Symphony. 
</P>
<P>3. &amp; 4. I can't quite remember because I don't own either of them. 
</P>
<P>His first two albumns were fairly traditional, but I believe his other two
have a  more &quot;New Age&quot; quality to them. In Britain, his albumns are
distributed by Rounder  Records. In Australia, they MIGHT be distributed by
Larrikin Records. 
</P>
<P>Personally, I do like his albumns. He has a very &quot;soft&quot; style of
harp-playing.

<P>I hope that helped.

Alan  is &quot;Breton&quot; i.e. comes from Britanny (the western part of France
where american  tankers crash and people are still not indemnified 12 years

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: re Sensual World 
</P>
<P>IED would remind Love-Hounds that Kate has already made her understanding 
of the word &quot;sensual&quot; very clear. In an interview conducted by
Christopher Ward  for Canadian TV in November 1985 Kate was very explicit. Ward
asked, &quot;Does your  sexuality ever enter into your work?&quot;. Kate's
answer: &quot;I find that very...confusing.  Because music is sensual. I think
the essence of all art is sensuality, rather than  sexuality. That's what art
is, it's really pure feeling...&quot; So Kate has a very  interesting view about
the distinction between the sexual and the sensual, and this  distinction seems
to be an artistic one. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Now who's Alan Stivell? 
</P>
<P> Alan Stivell is a master of the Irish harp, and a singer of Irish, English
and  (especially) Breton folk music. Kate has been an admirer of Stivell's for
at least nine  years: she played one of his recordings on UK radio when she
guest-dj'd once in  December of 1980. Once again Kate planted a clue to her
future artistic development  years before the fact.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: KT News 
</P>
<P>The single, The Sensual World: UK release date September 18. IED's
information  is not certain on this next point, but it seems that it's just
possible that the title of  the album (though not the single) may really be The
Sensual World in October. This  still seems very hard to believe, and as IED
says, his information is vague in this  particular, but for the record, it is
possible. 
</P>
<P>Kate &quot;really likes&quot; the new album, is very pleased with it, and
--this may be of  some comfort to the more hardcore fans--she says that she's &quot;not
at all sure it will  be popular in America,&quot; but that she did not let
herself worry about that in making  this album. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, she believes that there will be a different first single choice
for the  CBS (U.S.) release than the one chosen for the rest of the world ( The
Sensual  World ). IED gathers that Kate still has little say in what happens to
her product in  the U.S., or else that she is willing to bow to the advice of
the U.S. companies on  such points. Basically, IED understands that although she
would of course be happy  to find that the new album is successful in the U.S.,
she is not particularly interested  one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>Also, Kate has, as of September 1, only shot one video, the one which is to 
accompany the single The Sensual World. Ergo, since the chances are that CBS
will  release a different song as the first single in the U.S., there is still
no video to  accompany that other song. Kate did not seem to be in any great
hurry to get such a  second video done for the U.S. market, either. 
</P>
<P>As for touring--she has no plans to do a tour at this time, but she has not
ruled  out the possibility of planning a tour in a year or so, if the album
should prove  successful in the U.S. Any plans for a tour at this point would be
contingent upon  the album already showing signs of huge popularity, because CBS
would otherwise  not be likely to want to pay for the kind of production she
would require. At any  rate, she has not yet closed her mind to the idea of
touring sometime within the  next year or eighteen months. 
</P>
<P>Finally, the record company has been slating her for a lot of interviews,
possibly  including Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>That is all that IED knows at this time. And if you're wondering how he came
to  learn all this--don't ask.

<P>Kate Bush - &quot;The Sensual World&quot; - Columbia CAT 1838 
</P>
<P>Side 1: The Sensual World, Love And Anger, The Fog, Reaching Out, Heads

<P>Side 2: Deeper Understanding, Between A Man &amp; A Woman, Never Be Mine, 
Rocket's Tail, This Woman's Work, Walk Straight Down The Middle.

</P>
<P>A sticker on the box says &quot;In-Store October 17!&quot; 
</P>
<P>The cover is a black and white photo of Kate with a large flower held to her
 mouth (reminiscent of &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;), with copper-colored
lettering (&quot;The  Sensual World * Kate Bush&quot;).

<P>Hello there fellow Love-Hounds: 
</P>
<P>Well, I was unbelievable close to having Kate's newest in my hot little 
hands...while visiting my local Music Shack in lovely downtown Troy, I enquired
as  to the whereabouts of Kate's latest single. Unfortunately, it has not made
an  appearance. BUT! As luck would have it, one of the store clerks had gotten a
special  promo cassette of the album. For one brief instant it was in my
hands...but I could  only look, and had to return it. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, here's what the cover looks like, for those of you who may be lucky 
enough to find it: 
</P>
<P>The background is black, with &quot;Kate Bush The Sensual World&quot;
written across the  top in bronze lettering. A black-and-white photo of Kate
shows her with an  enormous, full-blown rose in front of her face, covering the
lower part of her nose  and her mouth. Leaving only her huge eyes to peep out at
you enticingly! :) 
</P>
<P>I'm as disappointed as you are that I can't give you a report of what it
SOUNDS  like...guess we'll all have to be patient.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: the double-groove etc. 
</P>
<P>An amazing discovery: there is also (in very limited quantities, how limited
IED  doesn't know, but very limited) a white-label test pressing of the UK 12&quot;
going  around swapmeets throughout the country, and a few copies have even been 
advertised in Goldmine this week. This white-label is extra-special : on the
b-side  are Walk Straight Down the Middle and the instrumental version of TSW.
But on  the a-side, instead of the vocal version of TSW there is simply another
pressing of  the instrumental version again. 
</P>
<P>OR SO ONE WOULD THINK! In fact, the a-side is double-grooved ! The a-side 
plays both the instrumental and the vocal versions of TSW, depending on exactly 
where you set the needle down! 
</P>
<P>Looks like Katey's been up to her old tricks again! 
</P>
<P>Newsfront: The album cover is different from the 12&quot; cover only in a
subtle way.  Instead of showing Kate with dust (or sand) running through her
fingers, she has a  flower in her hand, in front of her mouth (so that the mouth
is not visible).  Otherwise the photo is very much like the 12&quot; cover's
photo--same tinted duo-tone  b-and-w style. No word on the back cover of the
album, or what any interior  artwork there might be, or on the lyric sheet, if
any. According to IED's  information, the U.S. promo-cassettes of the album,
which are already circulating  rather widely here in the States (CBS has sent
out copies to many radio stations, and  they seem to have arrived everywhere at
the same time), do not contain any interior  artwork, nor do they have lyrics.
Let's hope CBS doesn't skimp like that for the  official release. 
</P>
<P>Chances are they won't. IED received a call from a radio person who read a
copy  of the CBS press-kit's article for the new album. And it is very nicely
written, very  feelingful (though it does of course use terms like &quot;AOR ad
repro&quot; and &quot;units sold&quot;),  and only minimally incorrect from a
factual point of view. Also, it details a  significant amount of promotional
material that is being readied by CBS to blitz the  retail outlets with on
D-Day, which is still listed as October 17 (though IED was told  October 9 by a
CBS rep who should know). And yes, there is going to be a U.S.  CD-single! It
may only be a promotional item, and there's no word on what tracks it  will
contain, but it is mentioned in the press-kit article.
