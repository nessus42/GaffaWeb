<P>As Dave's inquisitive nature returns, he asks: 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;, there are two snippets of background
vocals (no, not  backwards messages) under KT's lines `My home, my joy...', the
first being `let  me in'. What does the second one (at 2:09, for you out there
with CD's) say? I  assume it must be Paddy's voice, but none of the rest of his
lines in the song have  quite the same inflection; the voice tremors quite a
bit. Headphones and playing that  loop over and over again at high volume just
aren't enough for my overwhelmed  ears.

</P>
<P>Dave, IED can help you with the line at 2:09 in &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;.
The line  is &quot;It's cold out here!&quot; and it does sound like Paddy doing
one of his Irish-y voices.  Don't credit IED with this solution, he got it from
amazingly serious Kate fan Dawn  Uebel, who wrote in her discovery (along with
many other interesting observations)  to Break-Through a while back.

<P>Exactly where Kate picked this up and just what the precise significance of
this is  to the song, we can merely conjecture. (Or ask IED's KT knowledge bank
:-) ), but  I believe Kate does listen to quite a bit of ethnic material.

</P>
<P>&gt;Whilst playing &quot;The Dreaming&quot; to an Asian friend recently, he
commented that  the section (which sounds like) &quot;Dagga dagim da da, daggim
da da&quot;, is in fact  derived from an Indian dance discipline called the Rhag
(this spelling may be  incorrect). It is a very formal dance in which the
instructor chants and the students  perform the intricate dance to this
chanting. 
</P>
<P>Please tell your friend a) he's very imaginative and b) he's got his raag
and his  taal mixed up. Raag (or raga) is to Indian music as what melodies and
scales are to  Western music, whereas taal (or tala) refers to rhythm cycles.
Before I continue, let  me establish my &quot;authority&quot; in this issue: I
study and perform Kathak, one of the six  classical dances of India. Kathak is
different from the other classical dances such as  Kathakali and Bharat Natchyam
in that besides gestures and story-telling, we also  have &quot;abstract&quot;
compositions that deal only with rhythmic patterns, which allows for  infinite
variations and improvisation. 
</P>
<P>Recitation is used in two ways; first, to keep the beats in the rhythm
cycle, and  second, to recite the composition which we dance. In the first
instance, the syllables  (&quot;bols&quot;) fall always on the beat. In the
second, the bols are used to dictate the  rhythmic patterns that we dance.
Whereas the passage from GOoMH in question is  indeed a rhythm pattern, it is
too short for a composition, and compositions do not  contain a single repeating
pattern. Nor are compositions repeated ad infinitum as in  the song. Further
more, I have never heard bols that sound like that. Now I'm not  saying that it
is not possible that Kate heard some recitation somewhere and  incorporated it
into her music. However, it is unlikely that she would just make up  some rhythm
pattern and throw in some &quot;nonsense&quot; symbols of her own, given the 
other examples that show her to be meticulously true to the original in such
cases.  One such instance is the &quot;funeral chorus&quot; from Nosferatu, 
</P>
<P>Of course, I'm only Chinese and not Indian, and maybe the passage *DID* come
 from some aspects of Indian music that I don't know of. However, unless someone
 with more authority (someone from the Bush family or a guru of Indian music) 
convinces me otherwise, I'll say that the passage has nothing to do with Indian 
music. 
</P>
<P>Lastly (whew!) did I really save the net &quot;hundreds if not thousands of
dollars&quot; by  lumping six posting into one?

<BR> Subject: influences 
</P>
<P> In GOoMH, the pursuer (male) also changes into a mule--just as he has been 
able to adapt to the earlier tactics of the pursued (female). Btw, the pursuer
says, at  the point in question, &quot;Let me in!&quot; Vickie, IED believes
(unless he remembers  incorrectly, which is certainly very possible) that Kate
said GOoMH was &quot;inspired  by&quot;, not actually &quot;based on&quot;,
Stephen King's novel, The Shining. She also said the  movie Alien had had
something to do with the genesis of her recording. But clearly  the most direct
influence was The Twa Magicians, the old folk song--not, as far as  IED can
tell, a musical influence, but definitely a narrative one.

gatech!chinet.chi.il.us!katefans@EDDIE.MIT.EDU (Chris Williams) <BR> Subject: &quot;Get
out of my House&quot; line revealed! 
</P>
<P>Vickie here. We just heard something in &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; that
we'd  never heard before! I know that song (the whole *album*) is packed with
hidden  tidbits, that's why it's my favorite, but this is something *SO* clear
we're shocked  we never understood it before. 
</P>
<P>Chris had the main speakers unhooked while working on them and we wanted to 
listen to music so I put on TD and the sound came out of the back &quot;surround&quot;
 speakers***. 
</P>
<P>The vocals during the refrain (&quot;I am the concierge, chez-moi, honey)
completely  disappeared and we could hear the doors slamming, etc. and the voice
we'd heard  before saying &quot;Let me in&quot;, but during the second refrain
(2:08 minutes into the song),  we *very* clearly heard a male voice saying... 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's cold out here&quot; 
</P>
<P>as Kate started to sing &quot;My home, my joy...&quot;) right before the &quot;Get
out of  my...(Won't letcha in) Get out of my house&quot; 
</P>
<P>We'd (of course) heard that voice but never could understand what he was 
saying. Maybe we were the only ones who never understood it before, if so,
forgive  our excitement. It's as delightful a feeling as the first time we heard
the sheep and  the dogs in the song &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and the first time
we understood &quot;What about  Edward G?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ah, life's little pleasures! I love details and that's why TD would be my
DID,  because it's packed full of 'em. 
</P>
<P>Chris interlude: 
</P>
<P>*** Technical note: We have a Yamaha AVC-50 A/V Pre-amp. This unit has 
Dolby surround circuitry, so with the main speakers disconnected I switched the 
surrund mode to &quot;Dolby stereo surround.&quot; So all we heard was the
contents of the  left channel minus the contents of the right channel; i.e. we
heard the stuff that was  only in the left or right channel but not in both. So
we didn't hear the main vocal,  just the effected &quot;co-main vocal&quot; that
Kate usually uses (you usually hear three  voices at once in the &quot;main
vocal&quot;). In movies this effect is used so the main vocal  track voices are
not in the back speakers, but that gun-shots, etc. are.

</P>
<P>GET OUT OF MY HOUSE ANNOTATED LRYICS
</P>
<P> by Ron Hill, Andrew Marvick (IED), and Doug Alan.
</P>
<P> Compiled and edited by Ron Hill 
</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH YOU'VE OFTEN WRITTEN ROMANTIC SONGS  &quot;BABOOSHKA&quot;, &quot;WUTHERING
HEIGHTS&quot;, &quot;THE WEDDING LIST&quot;  [ROMANTIC??] THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
HAPPY BOY-MEETS-GIRL  -AND-LIVES-HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER AFFAIRS. IS THAT BECAUSE OF
SOME  PRIVATE PERVERSITY?
</P>
<P> KATE: For me that's how real situations are. Whenever I've experienced a 
relationship, or the people around me have, it's always ended up being
incredibly  complicated because that's the way human beings are. Nothing is
simple, it always  ends up being something else or dying and that's what I find
so interesting the drive  behind human beings and the way they get screwed up.
(1982, Melody Maker)
</P>
<P> KATE: The song is called &quot;Get Out of My House,&quot; and it's all
about the human as  a house. The idea is that as more experiences actually get
to you, you start learning  how to defend yourself from them. The human can be
seen as a house where you  start putting up shutters at the windows and locking
the doors not letting in certain  things. I think a lot of people are like this
they don't hear what they don't want to  hear, don't see what they don't want to
see. It is like a house, where the windows  are the eyes and the ears, and you
don't let people in. That's sad because as they  grow older people should open
up more. But they do the opposite because, I suppose,  they do get bruised and
cluttered. Which brings me back to myself; yes, I have had  to decide what I
will let in and what I'll have to exclude. (1982, Company)
</P>
<P> KATE: The Shining is the only book I've read that has frightened me. While 
reading it I swamped[???] around in its snowy imagery and avoided visiting
certain  floors of the big, cold hotel, empty for the winter. As in Alien, the
central characters  are isolated, miles (or light years) away from anyone or
anything, but there is  something in the place with them. They're not sure what,
but it isn't very nice.
</P>
<P> The setting for this song continues the theme the house which is really a
human  being, has been shut up locked and bolted, to stop any outside forces
from entering.  (1982, KBC 12)
</P>
<P> (&quot;Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!&quot;) <BR> When you left, the door was<BR>
 (slamming!) <BR> You paused in the doorway<BR>  (slamming!) <BR> As though a
thought stole you away.<BR>  (slamming!) <BR> I watched the world pull you
away.<BR>  (Lock it!)
</P>
<P> In this first section the only section where the other character is show as
leaving  as apposed to persuing, so this first section could be describing the
actual breakup of  the relationship that caused the character to &quot;lock her
house.&quot;
</P>
<P> KATE: The person has been hurt and has decided to keep everybody out.
(1982,  KBC 12) 
</P>
<P> So I run into the hall,<BR>  (Lock it!) <BR> Into the corridor.<BR> 
(Lock it!) <BR> There's a door in the house<BR>  (slamming). <BR> I hear the
lift descending.<BR>  (slamming!) <BR> I hear it hit the landing,<BR> 
(slamming!) <BR> See the hackles on the cat<BR>  (standing).
</P>
<P> KATE: ...but the thing has got into the house upstairs. It's descending in
the lift,  and now it approaches the door of the room that you're hiding in.
(1982, KBC 12) 
</P>
<P> With my key I<BR>  (lock it). <BR> With my key I<BR>  (lock it up).
<BR> With my key I<BR>  (lock it). <BR> With my key I<BR>  (lock it up).
<BR>
</P>
<P> I am the concierge chez-moi, honey.<BR>  Won't letcha in for love, nor
money.<BR> (&quot;Let me in!&quot;)<BR>  My home, my joy.<BR>  I'm barred and
bolted and I<BR> (Won't let you in).<BR> (Get out of my house!)
</P>
<P> KATE: They plant a &quot;concierge&quot; at the front door to stop any
determined callers  from passing... (1982, KBC 12)
</P>
<P> KATE: The idea with that song is that the house is actually a human being
who's  been hurt and he's just locking all the doors and not letting anyone in.
The person is  so determined not to let anyone in that one of his personalities
is a concierge who  sits in the door, and says &quot;you're not coming in here&quot;
like real mamma. (1982,  Melody Maker)
</P>
<P> Concierge is the French title of a live-in building-attendant or
manager--an  ancient profession in Europe, usually associated with
correspondingly ancient old  women (though men can also be called &quot;concierges&quot;).
&quot;Chez-moi&quot; means &quot;at my  house&quot;, or &quot;at my place.&quot;
So the line in implies that the house's spirit (this is really  that of the
house itself--as Kate once explained--which has developed a kind of  human
consciousness over the years) is fiercely protecting its solitude from the 
invading force (the male personality cooing &quot;Let me in!&quot;): &quot;I'm
the manager in my  own house, honey.&quot;
</P>
<P> Interestingly, Kate describe the &quot;concierge&quot; as &quot;one of his
personalities&quot;. The  &quot;his&quot; may imply that the male/female angle
of the song is not as important to Kate as  the overall theme. Note that the
protagonist is definately described as a woman later  in the song.
</P>
<P> Another interesting thing about the description &quot;one of his
personalities&quot; is that  it implies that the other &quot;voices&quot; Kate
uses in the song may be other &quot;personalities&quot;  of the woman. Kate is
known to have been influenced early on by the philospher  Gurdjieff, who held
each man had numerous &quot;personalities&quot;, and this song may  reflect that
influence.
</P>
<P> KATE: I am absolutely fascinated by the states that people throw and put
on.  And, you know, I think that that is the most fascinating thing there is to
write about  really, the way that people just distort things and the things they
think and the  things they do. And it's really fun for me if I can find an area
of the personality that  is slightly exaggerated or distorted and, if I feel I
can identify with it enough, then  try to cast a person as perfectly as I can in
terms of that particular character trait,  especially if I don't really show
those kinds of things myself. Take anger for  instance: it's really fun to write
from the point of view of someone who's really  angry, like in &quot;Get Out of
My House&quot; on the last album. Because I very rarely show  anger, although
obviously I do sometimes feel it. (1985, Musician)
</P>
<P>No stranger's feet<BR> Will enter me.<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR> I
wash the panes,<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR> I clean the stains away.<BR>
(Get out of my house!)
</P>
<P> &quot;No stranger's feet&quot; on the level of the metaphor for the house,
presumably  means the person other walking into the house. On a more literal
level, a&quot; foot&quot; is a  measurement in poetry, and this could be saying
that &quot;your words will not enter  me&quot;. Others have read &quot;feet&quot;
as meaning &quot;sexual organs&quot;, as in &quot;you will not have  intercourse
with me.&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;Wash the panes&quot; has been read by some to mean crying. 
</P>
<P>This house is as old as I am.<BR>  (Slamming.) <BR> This house knows all I
have done.<BR>  (Slamming.) <BR> They come with their weather hanging 'round
them,<BR>  (Slamming.) <BR> But can't knock my door down!<BR>  (Slamming.) 
</P>
<P> With my key I<BR>  (lock it). <BR> With my key I<BR>  (lock it). 
</P>
<P> This house is full of m-m-my mess.<BR>  (Slamming.) <BR> This house is
full of m-m-mistakes.<BR>  (Slamming.) <BR> This house is full of m-m-madness.<BR>
 (Slamming.) <BR> This house is full of, full of, full of fight!<BR>  (Slam
it.) 
</P>
<P> With my keeper I<BR>  (clean up). <BR> With my keeper I<BR>  (clean it
all up). <BR> With my keeper I<BR>  (clean up). <BR> With my keeper I<BR> 
(clean it all up).
</P>
<P> It's interesting how &quot;key&quot; has now become &quot;keeper&quot;,
perhaps implying that the  energy that had one protected the protagonist, is now
&quot;keeping&quot; her.
</P>
<P> I am the concierge chez-moi, honey.<BR>  Won't letcha in for love, nor
money.<BR> (&quot;It's cold out here!&quot;)
</P>
<P> The voice on &quot;It's cold out here!&quot; sounds like Paddy doing one of
his Irish-y  voices.
</P>
<P> My home, my joy.  I'm barred and bolted and I (Get out of my house!) (Won't
let you in). 
</P>
<P> (Get out of my house!)<BR>  No stranger's feet<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR>
 Will enter me.<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR>  I wash the panes.<BR> (Get
out of my house!)<BR>  I clean the stains.<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR>
(Get out of my house!)<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR> (Get out of my house!)
<BR> Won't enter me.<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR>
(Get out of my house!)<BR> (Get out of my house!) <BR> Yeah! Won't let you in!<BR>
(Get out of my house!)<BR> (Get out of my house!)<BR>  &quot;Let me in!
</P>
<P> KATE: ...and now it approaches the door of the room that you're hiding in. 
(1982, KBC 12)
</P>
<P> &quot;Woman let me in!<BR> Let me bring in the memories!<BR> Woman let me
in!<BR> Let me bring in the Devil Dreams!&quot; 
</P>
<P>KATE: The track kept changing in the studio. This is something that's never 
happened before on an album. That one was maybe half the length it is now. The 
guitarist got this really nice riff going, and I got this idea of two voices a
person in  the house, trying to get away from this thing, but it's still there.
(1982, ZigZag) 
</P>
<P> I will not let you in! <BR> Don't you bring back the reveries. <BR> I
turn into a bird, <BR> Carry further than the word is heard.
</P>
<P> KATE: So in order to get away, they change their form first into a bird
trying to  fly away from it. (1982, ZigZag) 
</P>
<P>&quot;Woman let me in! <BR> I turn into the wind. <BR> I blow you a cold
kiss, <BR> Stronger than the song's hit.&quot;
</P>
<P> KATE: The thing can change as well, so that changes into this wind, and
starts  blowing all icy. (1982, ZigZag)
</P>
<P> Possibly the &quot;song hit&quot; is the bird's &quot;song&quot; so this
line would be saying &quot;my wind  is stronger then your song.&quot;, although
there is no other evidence that the &quot;bird&quot; sings  any song in the
song. 
</P>
<P>I will not let you in. <BR> I face towards the wind. <BR> I change into
the Mule.<BR>  &quot;I change into the Mule.&quot; <BR> Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw-hee-haw-hee-haw-hee-haw...<BR>  &quot;Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!&quot;
</P>
<P> KATE: The idea is to turn around and face it. You've got this image of
something  turning round and going &quot;Aah!&quot; just to try and scare it
away. (1982, ZigZag)
</P>
<P> KATE: You're cornered, there's no way out, so you turn into a bird and fly 
away, but the thing changes shape, too. You change, it changes; you can't
escape, so  you turn around and face it, scare it away.
</P>
<P> &quot;Hee Haw&quot;<BR>  &quot;Hee Haw&quot;<BR>  &quot;Hee Haw&quot;
(1982, KBC 12)
</P>
<P> KATE: I think the mule is that kind of... the stupid confrontation... I
mean,  there's not really that much to read into it. It was the idea of playing
around with  changing shape, and the mule imagery was something I liked
inordinately. The  whole thing of this wild, stupid, mad creature just turning
around and going, you  know, &quot;Eeyore! Eeyore!&quot; [KATE MAKES CONVINCING
EEYORE SOUNDS.] I  don't know if you saw Pinocchio, but there's an incredibly
heavy scene in there,  where one of the little boys turns into a donkey a mule.
And it's very heavy stuff.
</P>
<P> I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SINCE ABOUT SIX, BUT I THINK I REMEMBER  THAT...IT'S A
STRONG IMAGE.
</P>
<P> Well, maybe you should see it again. It's a good film. (1985, Love-Hounds)
</P>
<P> Although Kate has never specifically mentioned the male in the song also
turning  into a mule, there appears to be two seperate &quot;mules&quot; at the
end, which would  indicate that he did so, especially since the second mule has
a male &quot;voice&quot;, credited  to Paul Hardiman. 
</P>
<P>The reason that Kate made the choice of the mule, may be explained by her 
description of it above as a &quot;stupid&quot; animal . Its actions, in other
words, are  &quot;thought-less&quot;: prompted by the crudest form of emotional
stimuli or instincts. Kate  has more than once insisted that music (art) is &quot;pure
emotion&quot;--especially in the  Russell Harty interview. When Harty
patronizingly says &quot;We've been to  Bronte-land...Where will the arrow of
your powerful intellect fall next?&quot; Kate's  immediate and strong reply is: &quot;Well,
I think the answer to that is that art is emotion  . Art is pure emotion...&quot;
Her reply has always seemed to IED to represent an  implied preference for the
value of emotion over the intellect. If so, the choice of the  &quot;stupid&quot;
mule as the guise in which the heroine of GOoMH finally faces her  &quot;problem&quot;
makes excellent sense.
</P>
<P> Also, of course, Kate may have been thinking of the expression &quot;stubborn
as a  mule&quot;, which describes the character she was singing about perfectly.

<P>Dha Dhin Dha Dha Dha/Dha Dha Dha Dhin Dha Dha/Dha Dkin Dha Dha  [Repeats to
fade out] 
</P>
<P>This is credited as &quot;drum talk&quot; to Esmail Sheikh. (Whether or not
the above  transcription is entirely correct is unclear). This is from East
Indian Classical music  and is called bol. The process of studying drumming in
this form of music involves  both learning to speak drumming patterns in bols
and learning to play the patterns.  Whether or not this symbolizes anything that
may have a direct relationship to the  theme of Kate's song is unclear. 
</P>
<P>CONCLUSIONS
</P>
<P> KATE: And that's actually what the whole song is about someone who is 
running away from something they don't want to face, but wherever they go, the 
thing will follow them. Basically, you can't run away from things you've got to 
confront things. And it's using the person as the imagery of a house, where they
 won't let anyone in, they lock all the doors and windows, and put a guard on
the  front door. But I think the essence of the song is about someone trying to
run away  from things they don't like and not being able to escape because you
can't. (1985,  Love-Hounds) 
</P>
<P>The quote from Kate describes the &quot;point&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; of
the song (note how this  seems to lead right into Running Up That Hill, the
first song on the next album). But  does the song have a positive or negative
ending? There are several points of view. 
</P>
<P>1) The &quot;happy&quot; ending. That the man and woman seemed to have found
 something in common in their muleness and sang to each other. The &quot;drum
talk&quot; at  the end could represent some kind of morse-code, meaning that
they have found  another way to communicate now that the primary channels have
broken down.
</P>
<P> However, many people find the whole song, including the ending, to be too 
jarring to be describing something &quot;happy&quot;.
</P>
<P> 2) The &quot;unhappy&quot; ending. In this interpetation, the characters in
this song don't  end up communicating. This would be reflected in the song by
the extented  &quot;mumbling-like&quot; sounds at the end of the song,
representing the total breakdown of  communications between the two.
</P>
<P> This would mean that the ending of the song was intended as a kind of
negative  warning about what could happen when you &quot;lock&quot; yourself up
so tightly. 
</P>
<P>2) The &quot;hopeful&quot; ending. In this interpetation, the ending does
indeed contain the  &quot;some sort of hope in there&quot; that Kate said (of
The Ninth Wave ) she feels should be  part of all works of art. In the above
quote, Kate was says that the theme of the song  was the error people can make
of running away from their problems, and that the  only way to solve problems is
to confront them. She also explains that when the  female character in Get Out
of My House changes into a mule (whether a stubborn  one or a stupid one), she
does finally turn and confront the male character (who has  changed into a mule
as well). This is the quintessential Kate Bush &quot;ending&quot;--sad but 
hopeful, very much like the ending of The Ninth Wave . In both, the protagonist
has  come to a new realization of the &quot;right way&quot; to
proceed/feel/think, and is therefore  able better to resign herself to whatever
fate might befall her, whether that fate be  &quot;happy&quot; or not. And this,
of course, is an essential element of Kate's own avowed  philosophy, described
by her in numerous interviews.
</P>
<P> So we do not learn what actually happens when the two mules confront each 
other in GOoMH ; nor is it important. What is important is that the protagonist
has  finally been able to confront the force which threatens her--she is no
longer  running from it. In a similar way the heroine of The Ninth Wave , in the
final bars  of The Morning Fog , has found reasons for living: whether she will
actually survive  the physical ordeal or not, she has at least gained a new
appreciation of the  important aspects of her life (love of family; and faith in
the human spirit, so to  speak, as represented by her &quot;future self&quot; in
Jig of Life ). It's therefore extremely  important, IED believes, that both The
Dreaming and Hounds of Love , as albums,  conclude with the same basic
situation. In both, the ultimate &quot;fate&quot; of the protagonist  is not
resolved, because that is not the artist's concern. Rather, it is the insight
that  those protagonists gain along the way that matters. 
</P>
<P>OTHER QUOTES
</P>
<P> It should be noted that the above quotes have been re-arranged in such a
way  that there meaning may have been somewhat distorted. In other words, the
quotes  may not actually relate to the lryics they are put next to.
</P>
<P> Following is the remaining quotes relating to the song. 
</P>
<P>I TELL KATE THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN MY EARS FELT LIKE PALE  JELLY AFTER FIRST
EXPOSURE TO THIS ONE ON THE WALKMAN. SHE IS  PLEASED!
</P>
<P> Oh, good! It's meant to be a bit scary. It's just the idea of someone being
in this  place and there's something else there... You don't know what it is.
(1982, ZigZag) 
</P>
<P>* I SUPPOSE IN TERMS OF GENERAL IDEAS, KATE, MAYBE WE COULD  TALK A LITTLE
ABOUT THAT. JUST WHERE YOU PLUCK THESE IDEAS  FROM, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT
OCCURS TO YOU IN EVERY DAY LIFE OR  DO YOU DISCIPLINE YOURSELF TO SIT DOWN AND
THINK ABOUT  THINGS?
</P>
<P> They're very often ideas that come out of other people's creations. Films
and  books are very much big inspirations to me. For instance, there's a track
on this  album that was... really the whole atmosphere was inspired by The
Shining. I read  the book and it was such an incredibly strong atmosphere, very
creepy, very  haunted, and I used it to like set a song using the same
atmosphere, but instead of it  being a hotel it being like a house, which is
also a human being. And just playing  with the feelings that I got when I read
the book and trying to put that same kind  and strangeness into the song. (1982,
Dreaming debut) 
</P>
<P>I FIND THE USE OF STRONG SYMBOLISM AND METAPHOR AND  ALLUSIONS IN YOUR
LYRICS TO BE EXTREMELY INTERESTING. FOR  EXAMPLE, IN &quot;GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,&quot;
THE WOMAN WHO IS SINGING  THE SONG HAS BEEN LEFT BY HER LOVER AND FEELS HURT,
AND  IDENTIFIES HERSELF WITH A HOUSE. THIS IS A BIBLICAL ALLUSION.  WHEN SHE
SAYS &quot;I WASH THE PANES&quot;, IT IS A TRIPLE ENTENDRE,  BECAUSE SHE'S
SAYING SHE'S WASHING THE WINDOWS OF HER BODY,  WHICH ARE THE EYES. THIS MEANS
SHE'S CRYING, AND BY DOING SO,  SHE'S WASHING THE HURT AND PAIN AWAY. THEN SHE
SAYS &quot;NO  STRANGER'S FEET WILL ENTER ME&quot; SAYING THAT SHE WON'T LET 
ANYONE INTO HER HOUSE, WHICH IS SAYING SHE WON'T LET ANYONE  INTO HER BODY,
WHICH IS ALSO REINFORCED BY THE BIBLICAL USE OF  &quot;FEET&quot; AS A EUPHEMISM
FOR &quot;PRIVATE PARTS&quot;. THE LAYERS OF MEANING  HERE, ARE PRETTY
INCREDIBLE.
</P>
<P> THEN A MAN TRIES TO ENTER HER LIFE AGAIN, BUT SHE'S TOO  SCARED, AND SHE
TRIES TO ESCAPE BY FLYING AWAY, BUT HE TURNS  INTO THE WIND. SHE THEN TURNS INTO
A MULE, PERHAPS FOR ITS  STUBBORN ABILITY TO WITHSTAND THE WIND. AND THEN HE
ALSO  TURNS INTO A MULE. NOW IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAVE A GROUND FOR 
COMMUNICATION. BECAUSE MULES ARE NEUTER, AND THEY CAN  COMMUNICATE ON A PLATONIC
LEVEL RATHER THAN A SEXUAL LEVEL.
</P>
<P> NOW A FRIEND OF MINE BELIEVES THAT THIS LAST PART IS A FLAW  IN THE SONG,
BECAUSE MULES ARE NOT REALLY NEUTER AFTER ALL.  THEY ARE ONLY STERILE.
PERSONALLY, I THINK IT ISN'T A FLAW  BECAUSE THE IDEA COMES ACROSS LOUD AND
CLEAR TO ME, AND  SOMEHOW IT SEEMS THAT &quot;I CHANGE INTO THE AMOEBA: OOZE!
OOZE!&quot;  JUST WOULDN'T WORK SO WELL. SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU  THINK
OF THIS INTERPRETATION? AND COULD YOU RESPOND TO MY  FRIEND'S SLIGHT CRITICISM?
</P>
<P> And what was your friend's criticism?
</P>
<P> HE SAID THAT THE ENDING IS A FLAW BECAUSE MULES ARE NOT  REALLY NEUTER,
THEY ARE ONLY STERILE.
</P>
<P> What does he mean?
</P>
<P> WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME AND TO HIM THAT THE END OF THE SONG IS  SORT OF A
POSITIVE NOTE BECAUSE THEY'VE FOUND A GROUNDS FOR  COMMUNICATION. AND SORT OF ON
A PLATONIC LEVEL, BECAUSE MULES  MIGHT BE SEEN AS BEING PLATONIC, BECAUSE...
</P>
<P> Why?
</P>
<P> OH... WELL... MULES ARE STERILE... UH... A DONKEY AND A HORSE...  YOU
KNOW... HAVE A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP, AND THEN THEY HAVE  MULES, AND MULES DON'T
HAVE CHILDREN, BUT THEY REALLY CAN  HAVE SEX. THEY JUST CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN, BUT
A LOT OF PEOPLE  ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE SEX. WHICH ISN'T 
REALLY TRUE.
</P>
<P> Right! Well, um... I think you... It's kind of weird the level of
interpretation  that you are reading into things, because... I mean, a mule in
our country all it  represents is a stupid animal. They are considered stupid
and that's the allusion that  was being used in that case. And it's very much a
play on a traditional song called  The Two Magicians about someone who's trying
to escape someone, and they keep  changing their form in order to escape them.
But the other thing keeps changing its  form. And that's actually what the whole
song is about someone who is running  away from something they don't want to
face, but wherever they go, the thing will  follow them. Basically, you can't
run away from things you've got to confront things.  And it's using the person
as the imagery of a house, where they won't let anyone  in, they lock all the
doors and windows, and put a guard on the front door. But I  think the essence
of the song is about someone trying to run away from things they  don't like and
not being able to escape because you can't.
</P>
<P> BUT IF THE SYMBOL OF MULES IS JUST STUPIDITY, AT THE END, THEN  IT WOULD
SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE ENDING, AND IT JUST  SORT OF SEEMS TO ME, MOST
OF YOUR SONGS...A LOT OF THEM...END ON  UP NOTES. AND IT SORT OF SEEMED LIKE IT
WAS A POSITIVE NOTE AT  THE END.
</P>
<P> Yes, I think the mule is that kind of... the stupid confrontation... I
mean, there's  not really that much to read into it. It was the idea of playing
around with changing  shape, and the mule imagery was something I liked
inordinately. The whole thing of  this wild, stupid, mad creature just turning
around and going, you know, &quot;Eeyore!  Eeyore!&quot; [KATE MAKES CONVINCING
EEYORE SOUNDS.] I don't know if you  saw Pinocchio, but there's an incredibly
heavy scene in there, where one of the little  boys turns into a donkey a mule.
And it's very heavy stuff.
</P>
<P> I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SINCE ABOUT SIX, BUT I THINK I REMEMBER  THAT...IT'S A
STRONG IMAGE.
</P>
<P> Well, maybe you should see it again. It's a good film. (1985, Love-Hounds) 
</P>
<P>* DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE KATE BUSH SONG?
</P>
<P> PADDY: For me. Yes, yes...it's &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;, really, was
my favorite  track. I think if Alfred Hitchcock ever made hit singles [LAUGHTER
FROM  AUDIENCE]... And I love it, I love the energy that it deals with. It's
fantastic. And  Paul Hardiman's vocals on the very beginning of it I think are,
to me, one of the  most fantastic things thats ever been recorded. I used to go
into fits of extascy when  we listened to the multi-track tapes of that and
those opening &quot;Eoyores&quot;... I love  that track. (1985, Kate Bush Con.
Paddy and Jay Interview) 
</P>
<P>THE TWA MAGICIANS
</P>
<P> KATE: &quot;And it's very much a play on a traditional song called The Two 
Magicians about someone who's trying to escape someone, and they keep changing 
their form in order to escape them.&quot;
</P>
<P> The Twa (read Two) Magicians is an old English (and Irish and Scottish and
just  about every country in Europe, too) ballad in which a young maiden is
wooed by a  young man. In the original the girl threatens to change form (in
some versions the  boy does all the hypothesizing), from human to animal or
vegetable. The boy always  responds by promising to takethe form of a compatible
or superior animal or  vegetable.
</P>
<P> Kate merely borrowed the general idea. Her specific images of bird-to-wind,
the  &quot;song's hit,&quot; and the mules are all unprecedented, however, at
least to judge from  the dozen or more versions of the original that IED has
come across recently.  Musically, there's no connection, either, as far as this
listener can tell.
</P>
<P> Following is a transcription of the lyrics to an old Irish version of The
Twa  Magicians. Actually, with all the variants all over Europe, its English and
Irish  versions are not the earliest. The following version is the one that Kate
probably  learned as a child, since it is the work of A. L. &quot;Burt&quot;
Lloyd, one of the fathers of the  English and Irish folkmusic revival of our
century, and a great favourite of Kate's.  IED transcribed as well as he could
from the recording of the song by Martin Carthy  (the album, which also includes
an a cappella rendition of &quot;The Handsome Cabin  Boy&quot;, is called Martin
Carthy with Dave Swarbrick , on Topic, 12 TS 340 -- 1977). 
</P>
<P> The Twa Magicians 
</P>
<P>A lady sits in her own front door <BR> As straight as a willow wand, <BR>
And by there come a lusty smith <BR> With a hammer in his hand, and he said 
</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well may stand you, lady fair <BR> All in your robe of red, <BR> But
come tomorrow at this same time <BR> I'll have you in me bed,&quot; and he said

</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Away, away, you coal-blacksmith, <BR> Would you do me this wrong?
<BR> To think to have me maidenhead <BR> That I have kept so long! 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd rather I was dead and cold <BR> And my body laid in my grave,
<BR> Than a husky, dusky coal-blacksmith <BR> Me maidenhead should have!&quot;

</P>
<P>So the lady she held up her hand, <BR> And she swore upon her soul, <BR>
That she'd not be the blacksmith's love <BR> For all of a box of gold. 
</P>
<P>But the blacksmith he held up his hand <BR> And he swore upon the Mass,
<BR> Saying &quot;I'll have you in me bed, young girl, <BR> For the half of
------------- (unintelligible). 
</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE 
</P>
<P>So the lady she turned into a dove <BR> And she flew up in the air, <BR>
But he became an old cock-pigeon <BR> And they flew pair and pair, crying 
</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So the lady she turned into a hare <BR> And she ran across the plain, <BR>
But he became a greyhound dog <BR> And he ran her down again, crying 
</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So she became a little mare <BR> As dark as the night was black, <BR> But
he became a golden saddle <BR> And he clung on to her back, crying <BR>
</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So she became a hot griddle <BR> And he became a cake, <BR> And every move
that poor girl made <BR> The blacksmith was her make. 
</P>
<P>So she became a full-dress (?) ship <BR> And sailed upon the sea, <BR> But
he became a bold captain <BR> And aboard of her went he, crying 
</P>
<P> Bide, lady, bide,<BR>  There's nowhere you can hide,<BR>  For the lusty
smith will be your love<BR>  And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So the lady she went into the bedroom <BR> And she changed into a bed,
<BR> But he became a green coverlet <BR> And he gained her maidenhead. 
</P>
<P>And watch ye how (?) he held her soul, <BR> And still he bad her bide,
<BR> And the lusty smith became her love <BR> For all her mighty pride.

93 15:06:57 EDT <BR> Subject: Why a mule? (&quot;Get out of my house&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Hey guys - I haven't been keeping up too much lately, but something caught
my  eye that I just HAVE to address... 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Dreaming&quot; (yeah, I know, it's been belabored to death
already) My favorite  song on this CD is &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;, and
lately I've been listening to it  REALLY LOUD (for various reasons). The 'mule'
thing at the end... well, for those  of you who find it hard to understand why
1.) first she turns herself into a bird (so  she can fly away from him and
everything associated with him) 
</P>
<P>&quot;I will not let you in <BR> Don't you bring back the reveries <BR> I
turn into a bird <BR> Carry further than the word is heard&quot; 
</P>
<P>and mostly 2.) she turns herself into a mule... <BR> &quot;I will not let
you in <BR> I face towards the wind <BR> I change into the mule&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why a mule, you ask? 
</P>
<P>What else has she become? Stubborn, and in a sense, an ass. In the end, this
is  what they BOTH become, he-hawing at each other. She expresses this
stubborness  in so many ways throughout the song Locking the house up (which we
know is  really herself), declaring that she will not let him in, slamming the
door..... But deep  down inside she doesn't really seem to want this, she's only
doing it for survival. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This house if full of my mess <BR> This house if full of mistakes
<BR> This house if full of madness <BR> This house if full of, full of, full
of FIGHT!&quot; 
</P>
<P>But her 'concierge states: <BR> &quot;Won't letcha in for love or money&quot;

</P>
<P>She references love here.... implying the feeling that she is really
struggling with  inside of her 'house'. She's convinced herself that she can
'clean it all up', wash it  all away. Her concierge and her keeper (both parts
of herself) are going to protect  her and help clean up her mess. But she's
fooling herself. She loves him and she  wants him back. So continues her
internal struggle with fate. 
</P>
<P>Because her actions contradict her true feelings, she has turned herself
into  nothing more than a stubborn ass. This is the best culmination of this
song and the  underlying message just wouldn't be clear without it! 
</P>
