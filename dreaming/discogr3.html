      <BR> Subject: *** LIVE BOOTLEGS MEGA-ARTICLE ***** </P>
    
    <P>KATE BUSH LIVE BOOTLEGS </P>
    
    <P>by Andrew Marvick (IED), Ronald Hill, Doug Allen, Woj, and Barth
      Richards. </P>
    
    <P>This is a compilation of various messages from Love-Hounds, done by Ron
      Hill who takes responsibilty for any errors that may have occured during
      editing. </P>
    
    <P>There are five main sources for the material on the live bootlegs. </P>
    
    <P> 1) The official Hammersmith Odeon videotape. The best sounding boots
      simply are recorded off of the laser-disk. So far, no audio recordings off
      of the un-edited film have surfaced (the un-edited film has only been seen
      at the 1985 convention). </P>
    
    <P> 2) Fan-recorded tapes from the Bristol, Paris, Manchester, London
      Palladium, and Amsterdam concerts. Note that there is only one known tape
      from each of these concerts, although they have been released in different
      formats. The sound is abysmal, there are no bootlegs of the 1979 concerts
      that have good sound. The best-sounding one that includes all the songs
      and incidental bits and pieces is probably the Manchester concert (a
      two-LP set, though only a little less complete than the Dreamtime 3-LP
      set). But they're all miserable. They feature not only songs, but a chant,
      readings by John Carder Bush, and incidental bits of music, all of which
      were heard while Kate changed costumes in between songs during the
      concert. Specifically, there are: a heartbeat passage preceding &quot;Room
      For the Life&quot;; an ethnic chant performed by the band in unison; two
      synthesizer introductions to songs; three brief readings by John--one
      known as &quot;Two in One Coffin&quot; (preceding &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;),
      the others passages of unidentified prose (perhaps by John); an
      arrangement of Satie's 1st &quot;Gymnopedie&quot;, which is used to frame &quot;Symphony
      in Blue&quot;, and a short jam session by the KT Bush Band. Also of note
      is the live version of &quot;Egypt&quot;, which sounds very different from
      the LP version. </P>
    
    <P>3) Kate. This was a forty-five minute TV special which aired in England
      on December 28, 1979; sometimes called the &quot;Christmas Special&quot;.
      In addition to a couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one or two new
      vocal performances of old songs, several new and unique bits of music
      appeared on this show. They include a brief introduction, an arrangement
      of part of Satie's &quot;First Gymnopedie&quot; (as an introduction to &quot;Symphony
      in Blue&quot;); an early version of &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;;
      a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel (Kate's guest on the show--he
      sings &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot;), sometimes referrred to as &quot;Peter,
      the Angel Gabriel&quot;; a brief bit of blues piano; and a duet with Peter
      of Roy Harper's song, &quot;Another Day&quot;. </P>
    
    <P> 4) There are a few clips from other live Tour of Life shows on three
      different TV programmes: the Tour episode of Nationwide (UK TV); a German
      programme called Kate Bush in Concert (which has some songs from the
      Hamburg and Mannheim concerts); and a Swedish show called Rockdrotting
      (with a few songs from the Stockholm concerts). All are in mono TV sound,
      however. </P>
    
    <P> 5) Bill Duffield concert. A modified Tour of Life show, staged at
      London's Hammersmith Odeon on May 12, 1979 for the benefit of the
      surviving relatives of Bill Duffield, Kate's lighting director for the
      Tour, who had died in an accident at the very beginning of the tour. The
      concert featured Steve Harley, Peter Gabriel. In addition to songs from
      The Tour of Life, this concert featured Let It Be, sung by Steve Harley,
      Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush ;&quot;Them Heavy People&quot; with verses
      sung by Harley and Gabriel; &quot;The Woman With the Child in Her Eyes&quot;
      sung by Harley and Gabriel; Gabriel's &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; sung as
      a duet by Gabriel and Kate; and Harley's &quot;Come Up and See Me&quot;,
      sung by Harley, with Kate and Gabriel on backing vocals. </P>
    
    <P>See Japanese Fan Club EP, If You Could See Me Fly and Passing Through
      Air. </P>
    
    <P>ALBUMS </P>
    
    <P> Japanese Fan Club EP The more common yellow-vinyl edition is not the
      original version of this disk. The actual record, as put out by the
      Japanese fan-club (now apparently defunct and succeeded by a different
      group in Japan), was a simpler affair: a red flex-disk with a white
      sleeve. On the disk where a label ordinarily would go was a KT symbol in
      silver. The disk had John's spoken message first, followed by Kate's brief
      message, followed finally by the excerpt from the live performance of &quot;Let
      It Be&quot; from a fan's in-audience (i.e., pirated) Walkman recording of
      the benefit concert for Bill Duffield. (The other singers on that track
      are Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel.) </P>
    
    <P> Wow : a two-record set containing a poor stereo dub of the Hammersmith
      odeon video's audio track and a mono dub of the BBC tv special kate (one
      on each record). This is probably the first KaTe booTleg, appearing in
      1982 or early 1983 and was put out by New York based bootleggers. </P>
    
    <P> Moving : beautiful re-packaging of Wow. Equally poor audio though. Made
      in the UK. </P>
    
    <P> Live in Paris (1984): single LP containing excerpts of the Paris
      concert. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Kate Bush Live in Europe 79 &amp; 80&quot; is a double album
      credits as being from the non-existant Fan Club of Taiwan. This also
      appeared as a cassette tape. One record is the soundtrack to the&quot;Kate
      Bush Live at the Hammersmith Odeon&quot; video tape, and the other album
      is the soundtrack to the hour long Christmas special called &quot;Kate&quot;
      that she did in 79. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Kate Bush Live in Europe 79 - 80&quot; a re-packaged three-record
      set that consists of: 1.) a true stereo transfer to vinyl of the whole of
      &quot;Live at Hammersmith Odeon&quot;; 2.) a transfer of the television
      sound track from Kate's 1979 Christmas special (the same TV-hum-filled
      audio track heard on the various video copies), which originally appeared
      along with 1.) as the above-mentioned two-record set called &quot;Wow&quot;;
      and 3.) a copy of part of a 1979 Paris concert, which previously appeared
      as the above mentioned Paris LP. All of these records were pressed by the
      same bunch of people, under several label pseudonyms, most often &quot;Rock
      Solid Records&quot; and&quot;International Records&quot; of New York.</P>
    
    <P> A Bird in the Hand (1986) is the worst ripoff of all the KT boots.
      Don't buy it unless you have never heard anything from the Hammersmith
      concert video at all before. All it is is an edited transfer of the Hi-fi
      audio track from the video-cassette of the Live at Hammersmith Odeon film.
      Furthermore, the stereo channel separation is virtually completely lost in
      the boot version, although the pressing (surface noise) is o.k. But this
      particular bootleg doesn't even include the whole 53-minute soundtrack!
      Only about nine songs (perhaps eight are listed, but as IED recalls nine
      are included on the record) are transferred, even though other boots have
      a better stereo transfer of the entire soundtrack on single disks. So
      steer clear! </P>
    
    <P>The cover boasted two fine early photos in blue ink with pink borders.
      Interestingly, this bootleg is marked: &quot;cover produced in U.S.A.,
      1986&quot;; and according to the labels, the record's alias is &quot;Don't
      Let Me Go&quot;. </P>
    
    <P> Under the Ivy Bush. (1988) This one features quite slick packaging,
      although the photos used are obviously from positives. The cover is of the
      Japanese- TKI pink leotard shot (uncropped, of course). The album is a
      hodge-podge, but is quite interesting. It bears the misleading label &quot;previously
      unreleased live German tracks.&quot; This refers to tracks one and two
      which are simply mono tapes of the LP tracks of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;
      and &quot;The Big Sky&quot; as used by Kate for lip-synch performances.
      The only differences between these and the LP tracks are that these are in
      terrible low-fi TV sound, and they include a studio audience cheering at
      the beginning and end of the lip-synch tracks. By the way, these two
      tracks are taken from Kate's appearance on the German TV show &quot;Peter's
      Pop Show&quot;, which was also re-broadcast on a French program, both of
      which aired in the fall of 1985. </P>
    
    <P>Track 3 is another matter altogether. It is a live version of &quot;James
      and the Cold Gun&quot; that has never appeared in any boot or video that
      IED has seen before. It's not from the Hammersmith film, nor is it like
      the &quot;On Stage&quot; version of the Hammersmith version, nor is it
      from the Bristol or the Paris shows. The sound is better than average for
      bootleg live material, and it's a really confident, loose performance.
    </P>
    
    <P>Tracks 4 and 5 are just the Satie &quot;Gymnopedie&quot; and &quot;Symphony
      in Blue&quot; from &quot;Kate&quot;, the 1979 Christmas special. However,
      the audio on these tracks is far superior to that on the earlier bootleg
      transfers of the &quot;Kate&quot; program. </P>
    
    <P>Side Two starts off with &quot;The Man With the Child in His Eyes&quot;
      from the &quot;Kate&quot; program. </P>
    
    <P>Track 2, Side Two is just an excerpt from the German documentary on Kate
      called &quot;Kate Bush in Concert&quot;. You can hear the last words of
      one of Kate's answers to an interviewer's question, which segues into the
      live version of &quot;Violin&quot; from the TV program's filmed excerpts
      of the Mannheim and Hamburg concerts. </P>
    
    <P>Track 3 is just the &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; from the Tour of Life.
      (The specific concert is untraceable, really, because this recording of
      the song was made by Kate in the studio with the KT Bush Band specifically
      for the Tour, so that she wouldn't have to worry about singing for at
      least one song in the show, which left her a bit freer to dance during
      that song. Consequently this track is identical in all the concerts). </P>
    
    <P>Track 4, Side Two begins with some bootlegger's idea of a joke: it's a
      phrase from an interview Kate gave for the German TV film &quot;Kate Bush
      In Concert&quot; (IED believes), which the bootleggers have
      backwards-masked ! The words that Kate utters, when played backwards, are:
      &quot;...will be totally believed by an awful lot of people.&quot; Ha ha.</P>
    
    <P>Track 5 is a pre-tour live version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;,
      taken (probably) from one of the two German TV shows on which Kate
      appeared to perform the song in 1978. The sound, again, is quite good for
      a transfer from TV. </P>
    
    <P>Track 6, the last track on the album, is again a reasonably clear
      transfer from a thin, mono TV original. This one, however, is something
      special: the live version of &quot;Under the Ivy&quot; which Kate
      performed solo, accompanying herself on piano, in Abbey Road Studios for
      the satellite broadcast of a special edition of the U.K. TV program The
      Tube. </P>
    
    <P>That's it. Altogether a pretty queer collection of tracks, but not
      without value or interest. </P>
    
    <P> Live in Bristol (1988): two record set containing the entire Bristol
      concert as well as some bits of John Carter Bush's poetry. Nice package,
      poor audio. </P>
    
    <P> Live in Amsterdam : a single lp containing most of the aborted
      Amsterdam concert which was cut short due to KaTe's flu attack. </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush Live in Manchester, April 10th, 1979. (1988) This album, a
      two-record set from our old familiar NYC-based bootleg outfit, is exactly
      what it claims to be. The record is not as complete a record of the Tour
      programme as the bootleg 2-LP set of the Bristol concert (which is a
      virtually unedited copy of the entire concert), since it only contains
      twenty tracks, and some though not all of the incidental music and
      prose-readings are missing. But it is a different performance, and Kate
      and the band are in unusually fine form. The sound is boomy on the bottom
      and weak on the treble, but it still manages to create a strong atmosphere
      and presence, and the album, overall, is considerably more listenable
      than, say, the Paris concert bootlegs, which have extremely muffled and
      distant sound. &quot;Moving&quot; is extremely beautiful and ethereal in
      this performance. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;What Katie Did at Amnesty International&quot;. (1988) This is a
      seven-inch bootleg. It has a b&amp;w cover design on high-quality
      cardpaper, with red and black lettering in a type-face that is meant to
      imitate the style used by Peter Gabriel for several recent singles. The
      photo, too, is a nearly-abstract b&amp;w shot of a figure moving down a
      street (not Kate), sort of like the blurred shots on some of Gabriel's So
      singles covers. The record itself features the live performance of &quot;Running
      Up That Hill&quot; from the other night (as opposed to the one which is
      included on the official Secret Policeman's Third Ball: The Music LP), but
      of course the sound is very poor in comparison with the Amnesty LP track.
      The real selling-point of this bootleg is its b-side, a crude but quite
      listenable recording of the live version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; which
      Kate gave at the Amnesty concerts. It's not earth-shaking, but it's a huge
      artistic advance on the performance of the same song which Kate gave with
      Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel in 1979. This is a very thoughtful and
      well-thought-out interpretation, and Kate sings all but the second verse
      this time around (IED can't say for sure who the male singer in this
      version is, but supposes it could be a very hoarse Gabriel?). </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush Live at the London Palladium 1979 (1988) is a 3-record set
      from what looks like the same old New Yorkers. On this album they go by a
      name they deserve, &quot;Pharting Pharoah Records&quot;. The album design
      is particularly noxious: on the front cover it features the famous (and
      copyrighted) photograph of Kate with ivy in her hair; and on the back, a
      collage mixing official photographs taken from music magazines (including
      the KBC Newsletter) with shots from the nude photo session of &quot;'lookalike'
      Kate Simmons&quot; which originally appeared in a Autumn 1982 U.K. edition
      of Penthouse Magazine. As IED understands it, the photos and story
      appeared in the UK edition of Penthouse only; and the article was filled
      with teasing insinuations that left the reader in little doubt they were
      supposed to think it was Kate (&quot;young doctor's daughter from Kent&quot;;
      &quot;been composing since she was a child&quot;; etc.)</P>
    
    <P>As for the use of one of those photos on a bootleg LP cover, it doesn't
      surprise IED at all. There's zero evidence that the people who make KT
      boots are fans. That's highly unlikely, in fact. In the first place, any
      real fan would do a much better job of organizing the tracks, listing the
      titles correctly (there are no fewer than eight mistakes on the cover of
      the three-record set), etc. And in the second place, a real fan wouldn't
      even sell a bootleg in the first place! </P>
    
    <P>However, there is no reason that IED can see for doubting the
      authenticity of this album's contents. All 24 songs from the Tour of Life
      concerts are included (spread over three records), as well as virtually
      all of the &quot;incidental&quot; music and poetry/prose readings,
      readings, chants, etc. (The Bristol bootleg, in its recent vinyl
      incarnation, manages to fit roughly the same amount of material into two
      records, but who's counting?) The sound of the Palladium set is no better
      than you'd expect, but the source does sound different from those of any
      of the other albums. As a result, it seems relatively safe to accept that
      this set originated from the London Palladium. </P>
    
    <P> Temple of Truth is to be avoided unless you are so devoted a fan that
      you must have any Kate item no matter what its quality. Temple of Truth is
      simply an excerpt from an unidentified (and unidentifiable) Tour of Life
      concert. The sound of the recording is the worst of any of the several
      live concert bootlegs of Kate's Tour of Life, and it doesn't even contain
      half the programme. Do not buy this album. </P>
    
    <P> If You Could See Me Fly (1988) (NOT to be confused with the CD of the
      same name) is a single lp containing excerpts from the Bill Duffield
      concert from 1979, features Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel (organized to
      benefit Duffy's family following his death early in the tour). Also
      included two early demos of &quot;Babooshka&quot; and Let It Be from the
      Amnesty show. </P>
    
    <P>The quality of the Hammersmith material is marginal. The Amnesty show
      track is better, but not great. The two studio takes of &quot;Babooshka&quot;
      are pretty good, though they crackle as if they had been lifted off
      another vinyl disc. </P>
    
    <P>This is a European pressing and has a black, white, and gold cover with
      a composite photo of a Fred &amp; Ginger like pair dancing on a typewriter
      keyboard. </P>
    
    <P>The tracks and credits are listed as shown below. Recorded live 12 May,
      1979 at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, except where noted. </P>

    <P> Live in Japan (1989) is a seven-inch single featuring (on the a-side)
      Kate's live performance of Moving from the Seventh Tokyo Song Festival,
      which was held at the Budokan on June 18, 1978. On the b-side are Kate's
      performances of abridged versions of two Beatles songs, The Long and
      Winding Road and She's Leaving Home. The latter two songs were taped at
      Tokyo's TBS G Studio on June 23, 1978, for airing on the programme Sound
      in S. All three songs are accompanied by a large orchestral group
      (including full string and wind sections), and for She's Leaving Home Kate
      pre-recorded her own background choruses. </P>
    
    <P>The sound is surprisingly good, and is in stereo (although it may be
      simply a stereo recording of the original mono tracks). There is a good
      deal of &quot;toppiness&quot; to the sound (distortion of the higher
      frequencies), but for the most part the recordings are quite listenable.
    </P>
    
    <P>The cover is of hard, glossy card-stock, with a close-up copy of a 1978
      publicity shot of Kate on the front, and a copy of the close-up of the &quot;radiating
      eye&quot; from the front cover of the official UK single release of The
      Man With the Child in His Eyes on the back. </P>
    
    <P>Kate's performances are extremely professional, with no hint of
      uncertainty about intonation or anything--although at the very end of
      She's Leaving Home Kate finishes a beat later than the arrangement
      evidently indicated, a mistake no doubt prompted by what must have been
      minimal rehearsal time and poor orchestral direction. (Anyway, the error
      does not damage the performance, since the arrangement ends at that
      point.) Kate's voice is at its most spectacularly high-pitched in all
      three performances, and she does manage to add two or three interesting
      little melodic flourishes to the Beatles songs, despite their abbreviated
      length. </P>
    
    <P>All in all, IED agrees completely with Peter FitzGerald-Morris, who
      called this bootleg &quot;a treasure&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>LIVE CDS </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush Live (or Live At Hammersmith 1979 ). (1989) By its physical
      make-up IED strongly suspects that it is a product from the same group who
      have been putting out the now-famous Beatles Back-Track and Off-White CDs.
      The package of this KT CD is a normal jewel-box, with a hard-card cover
      (folded over once), and four colour photographs of Kate on the front. The
      track listings are almost completely accurate and are clearly set out. The
      photo/track- listing card is very sharply printed and glossy. Also on the
      cover is a red official KBC &quot;KT&quot; symbol--though of course this
      is not an official producet. </P>
    
    <P>The CD contains fifteen tracks. The first twelve are simply the same old
      Live at Hammersmith Odeon audio-track, though this time it has been very
      well lifted from the new Japanese edition of the laser-disk, which
      features a digital re-mastering of the original analog tapes. Track
      thirteen is the live performance of Running Up That Hill from the Amnesty
      International Secret Ball : The Music CD. Track fourteen is the live
      performance of Breathing from the Comic Relief: Utterly Utterly Live CD.
      And track fifteen is the track This Woman's Work from the She's Having a
      Baby soundtrack CD. The three extra tracks are re-mixed so that the
      applause from the end of the Hammersmith tape fades into the applause from
      Running Up That Hill, and ditto for Breathing. The only error in the
      track-listing is in the identification of the two live tracks as both
      coming from 1988. Actually both are from at least a year earlier. No big
      deal. The sound of all these tracks is exceptionally good even for a
      legitimate release, and unheard of in the history of Kate Bush bootlegs.
      Nevertheless, its price may be considered very high by many fans,
      especially those who already have these recordings in their original,
      legitimate configuration. </P>
    
    <P>Front cover: four color pix, including a second take from the pose used
      for the US cover of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; and three others most
      likely from those sessions. Inside face: the famous EMI publicity photo
      for that album. Cropped, some (ref. Vermorel p. 62). </P>
    
    <P>Cover Title: Kate Bush Live. Title on disk: Kathy Live from Wuthering
      Heights (Neutral Zone [Korea] NZCD89010), AAD. </P>

    <P>On the cover is the note - 'We apologize for the non excellent quality
      of the recording, which has been realized with sixties amateur equipment'.
    </P>
    
    <P>Comments: Although the above note implies that this is a bootleg the CD
      is listed in German import catalogues under the number (036-092). The
      quality is very good except that in a couple of places a 'surface noise'
      can be heard, as though this is a digital copy of a record. This noise is
      minimal and does not distract from the well edited performance. </P>

      <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald Hill)
      <BR> Subject: *** Compilation Bootleg List **** </P>
    
    <P>COMPILATION BOOTLEGS </P>
    
    <P>by Andrew Marvick (IED), Evan Walsh, and Ron Hill </P>
    
    <P> This is a compilation of various messages from Love-Hounds, done by Ron
      Hill who takes responsibilty for any errors that may have occured during
      editing. </P>
    
    <P>These bootlegs contain compilations of material officially released.
      This makes the material more ethically dubious and illegal then the other
      boots, which normally contain material not available on official releases.
    </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Passing Through Air&quot; (the LP, NOT to be confused with the CD
      of the same name, which is entirely different), is a two-record set and
      includes a lot of Kate's b-sides and re-mixes, plus the video mix of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;,
      and the edit of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; which Kate used for the
      lip-synch performance of the song for the 1986 BPIs -- misidentified in
      the album listing as a &quot;live&quot; version. Also misidentified is the
      &quot;Meteorological Mix&quot; of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; as &quot;The
      Astrological Mix&quot;; a mistake not apparently motivated by bootlegger's
      caution, since all the other tracks are clearly identified as the official
      releases they once were.</P>
    
    <P>There is only one piece of truly valuable new music on this two-record
      set (or new to IED, anyway): the last track on the album is the live
      version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; from about 1980/81, which Kate performed
      with Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel, and which appeared on a Japanese Fan
      Club flexi-disc. However, the present recording is twice the length of the
      &quot;official&quot; version, fading out much nearer to the end of the
      performance. The original source for this performance is the same cheap
      in-audience tape which was used by the KBC for their flexi-disc.</P>
    
    <P>The cover has a close-up of the photo used for the U.S. Hounds of Love
      LP poster (Kate kneeling with a Turkish fez on her head). </P>

      <BR> Under The Ivy
      <BR> The Big Sky (Metorological Mix) ^ [Their spelling] </P>
    
    <P> The only interesting thing is the record it was pressed on top of.
      'Maria Stanmore Sings'. After The Big Sky you can hear the end of the song
      which was previously on that side ('Patrick Moores Dream'). You can hear
      something anyway - I'm just presuming. It's on Pink Frost Records (Maria
      Stanmore Sings, that is). There is no identification of the bootlegger or
      the country of origin. The only inscription on the runout groove is on
      side 1: 'MS 1 A 1J' and a '3' and on side 2: 'MS 1B J' and a '2' but these
      were probably on the original record. </P>
    
    <P>It has a white paper insleeve and a white outersleeve with a quite small
      picture of KaTe at a piano by a window, very probably East Wickham Farm,
      wearing flip-flops and a waistcoat and slacks, looking at the camera. The
      picture is similar to one in (I think) Vermorel's 'Princess ...' book but
      the shot is from a different angle (right angles to her) and not blurred.
      I have never seen it before. </P>
    
    <P>On the outer sleeve the only words are 'Kate Bush', 'Back Sides' and the
      track listing. The sound quality is normal commercial LP quality. </P>
    
    <P> The Can (1991) is a LP compilation of Kate's session work with other
      artists and rare versions of other songs. It comes with a T-shirt (some
      versions), sticker, and bootlet. </P>
    
    <P>Side 1 </P>
    
    <P>December Will Be Magic Again (It's Christmas Version)
      <BR> Be Kind To My Mistakes (Soundtrack Version)
      <BR> Sing Children Sing (Leslie Duncan Single)
      <BR> You (The Game Part II) (Roy Harper)
      <BR> Flowers (Zaine Griff) </P>
    
    <P> Side 2 </P>
    
    <P>Sister And Brother (Midge Ure)

      <BR> Subject: **** COVERS OF KATE BUSH SONGS ***** </P>
    
    <P>COVER VERSIONS OF KATE </P>
    
    <P>from Articles from Homeground, Andrew Marvick (IED), Doug Allen, Andy
      Semple, Robert M. Kelner, Larry DeLuca, Ben Roimola, and Jorn Barger. </P>
    
    <P> This is a compilation and re-editing of various messages (mainly from
      Love-Hounds), done by Ron Hill who takes responsibilty for any errors that
      may have occured during editing. </P>
    
    <P> There have been surprisingly few over the years, considering how well
      known Kate is in Europe. Kate was asked about this a few times: </P>
    
    <P>WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE COVER VERSION OF ONE OF YOUR SONGS? </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Poor Old Flea&quot; by Madame Maria Nanky. (1984, KBC 17) </P>
    
    <P> Wuthering Heights (1978) by Pat Benatar on her Crimes of Passion LP.
    </P>
    
    <P> Pat Benatar: All the covers I do are purely because I love the songs. &quot;Wuthering
      Heights&quot; for example is a beautiful song, really beautiful, and when
      I first heard it I just knew that I had to sing it. I wasn't trying to
      copy Kate's voice, which, by the way I think is brillant. But I wanted to
      put my style onto it...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Soundmaker, January 1983 (reprinted from Homeground #9) </P>
    
    <P>Kate: It was very nicely done. </P>
    
    <P>New Sounds, January, 1984 </P>
    
    <P> The Kick Inside by Julie Covington (of Don't Cry For Me Argentina fame)
      The cover turns the song into a rather conventional kind of American
      folkrock-tinged ballad. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I met Julie Covington through Jay. He is a friend of hers, and
      I've known her for a long time. (1980, KBC 5) </P>
    
    <P> Them Heavy People (1979) by Ray Shell (a dancer/singer from Starlight
      Express musical) has Kate on backing vocals. It was just a single, and IED
      has never heard it. He has also never heard of Ray Shell anywhere before
      or since. </P>
    
    <P> Wuthering Heights by Jah Wobble (supposed to be crap!!). </P>
    
    <P> And there was an abysmal Reggae-inflected Wuthering Heights around
      1981, group unknown by IED, and not recommended. (May be the same as the
      one above). </P>
    
    <P> Runnning Up That Hill---Blue Pearl (involving Youth (Big Sky) from
      Killing Joke and Dave Gilmour on guitar) (&quot;It actually sounds pretty
      good! It has a kind of soul sound, and the singer is, indeed, a black
      woman.&quot;) </P>
    
    <P> Runnning Up That Hill--- Tilt (&quot;Kate Bush, after going through an
      industrial dance trance.&quot;) </P>
    
    <P> The Man with the Child in His Eyes (1991)---Natalie Cole from an
      episode The Arseneo Hall show in 1991, apparently never recorded. The
      audience seemed to love it! When she sat down and Arsineo started talking
      to her he asked her to tell about that song. She said it was from Kate
      Bush. She said she usually doesn't cover songs but every once in a while
      she finds one she really wants to do and that was one of them. She said
      she's never recorded it and this was the first time she's performed it in
      this country (implying that she's done it elsewhere). Then they changed
      the topic. </P>
    
    <P> The Man With the Child in His Eyes (1989) by Hue &amp; Cry (studio
      version is on the b-side of 'Violently' and live version is on the live
      album 'The Bitter Suite',these versions in my [Jorn Barger's] opinion are
      the best covers around. Don't be upset by the gender change.) </P>
    
    <P> Then there are the sampled tracks: </P>
    
    <P> Larry DeLuca, while attempting to get approval to use a sample of Kate
      in one of his songs, discovered in 1990 that Kate approves these things
      personally. </P>
    
    <P> Night Scented Stock, on Loopzone, by a rave outfit called Les Enfants
      du Paradis. This appeared on a Telstar compilation entitled Thin Ice Tape.
    </P>
    
    <P> Cloudbusting, on Something Good Is Going To Happen (1992), by dance act
      Utah Saints. It uses the &quot;something good&quot; line from the song,
      sampled and played back at a high speed (with probably some sort of sound
      distortion). The video uses lots of clips from Kate's video. The group got
      permission from EMI Music Publishing to use the sample. </P>
    
    <P> Then there were the parodies: </P>
    
    <P> Faith Brown did very funny (because painfully accurate, though
      exaggerated) versions of Wuthering Heights and Wow. </P>
    
    <P> Oh England My Leotard (1980), by Pamela Stevenson, now of ex-Saturday
      Night Live fame. (She's the one that had the tits that moved around.
      Cleary she is into tits....). This song is from a British TV show called &quot;Not
      The Six O'Clock News&quot;. The song can be found on a record of excerpts
      from this show. The record is called &quot;Hedgehog Sandwich&quot;. </P>
    
    <P> The song is a pastiche of several Kate-ian chord progressions and
      instrumental cadences which suggest some of the early hits (it was done
      about 1980), and which has some quite witty (though undeservedly cruel)
      lines in it. </P>

      <BR> Subject: *** KT SYMBOL ROUNDUP *** </P>
    
    <P>HIDDEN KATE BUSH SYMBOLS ON ALBUMS </P>
    
    <P>Compiled and edited by Ron Hill
      <BR> by Ron Hill, Andrew Marvick (IED), and Jorn Barger. </P>
    
    <P>All of Kate's albums have a hidden copy of the KT symbol. This is an
      attempt to round-up where it is on the various albums, CDs, and cassettes.
    </P>
    
    <P>KATE: That actual sign is an old Knight Templars sign and 'round the
      countryside you'll find it scattered on the doorways of churches and
      things and it was just very fitting because I used to be in a band called
      the KT Bush Band. Katie, KT. And it's just a theme that we've kept
      running. It's a sorta motto. (1979, Personal Call) </P>
    
    <P> It can also be seen on Army Dreamers (the patch on Kate's arm) and The
      Big Sky (the flag) videos. </P>
    
    <P>CLUES </P>
    
    <P>THE KICK INSIDE: &quot;Japanese style&quot; cover only. If you can't
      find it (it's kinda whatcha might call &quot;a bit obvious&quot;) then see
      an optometrist pronto... </P>
    
    <P>LIONHEART: On the left side of the picture. </P>
    
    <P>NEVER FOR EVER: LPs only. Think &quot;rose&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>THE DREAMING: Think &quot;arm&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>HOUNDS OF LOVE: Back cover. </P>
    
    <P>THE WHOLE STORY: British version only. </P>
    
    <P>THE SENSUAL WORLD: Background. </P>
    
    <P>THIS WOMAN'S WORK EXTRA ALBUMS: Well, da. </P>
    
    <P>ANSWERS </P>
    
    <P> THE KICK INSIDE - In the kite on the original British &quot;Japanese
      style&quot; cover. On the left wing of kite image, black circle symbol
      with white lettering. Not on the American &quot;Kate in a box&quot; cover
      (as far as we know!) </P>
    
    <P>LIONHEART - On the left side of crate on the front cover! </P>
    
    <P>NEVER FOR EVER - Look on the gatefold, if it's a British LP; look on the
      inner sleeve, if it's an American LP. On the right hand side engraved in
      the branch of the rose branch right in the bottom right hand corner (or
      thereabouts) (Don't think this inside picture is shown on the CD, though
      it could be somewhere inside the booklet). </P>
    
    <P>THE DREAMING - Front cover, just below (relative to picture, not
      relative to sleeve) second solid band on left sleeve of KT's jacket. </P>
    
    <P> HOUNDS OF LOVE. Back cover. Upsidedown in the cloth on her right arm,
      near the weeds, partially obscured. </P>
    
    <P>THE WHOLE STORY - Only in the original UK vinyl edition: it's found only
      on the vinyl disk itself... </P>
    
    <P>THE SENSUAL WORLD - You may find it, in more or less accurate form, in a
      variety of spots, including the flower itself, Kate's hair and her
      collar-bone. But there is only one spot where it definitely appears, and
      where with proper lighting and preferably a maginfying glass the telltale
      signs of manual alteration of the image can be detected. Look in the
      background on the front, on the right side--and for the best results, use
      the original UK vinyl-LP cover as your source. It really can't be seen at
      all on the CD booklet, and it's not very clear even on the US LP cover.
    </P>
    
    <P>THIS WOMAN'S WORK EXTRA DISKS - The cover photo is the new Kate Bush
      symbol integrating the astrological symbol for Venus (ie, the biological
      symbol for woman). </P>

    <P>You are apparently on drugs, at least where the CD is concerned. </P>
    
    <P>My original EMI-Manhattan CD had the Kate-in-a-Crate cover, but had the &quot;UK
      back&quot; with the forest, kite, and KT symbol. </P>
    
    <P>My import TKI, included in my box set, has the Japanese-style cover, but
      does not include the original back cover art. There is no KT symbol on my
      UK CD of TKI. </P>

    <P>HIDDEN MESSAGES ON KATE'S SINGLES </P>
    
    <P>by Ron Hill, Jackie Zucconi, Saurav Misra, John M. Relph, and Greg
      O'Rear.
      <BR> Compiled and edited by Ron Hill </P>
    
    <P>Do you know anything about the messages scratched on the smooth circle
      just before the centre of the records? Why are they there? </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Yes, I do know something about these messages because I wrote
      them, and they are messages to go with the record. It's something that has
      been practised by several people. In fact, have a look through your
      albums, you'll probably find quite a few that you didn't even know were
      there. (1980, KBC 5) </P>
    
    <P>The messages are usually only on the originals of the singles, not the
      reprints for the Single File box set. Some of the latter messages may be
      explained by crew members creating the singles putting their own names on
      them. </P>
    
    <P>Wuthering Heights - &quot;Remember The Whales&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>The Man With The Child... - &quot;The child hides in the light&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>Hammer Horror - &quot;We are all playing a hunch&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Wow - &quot;Thank you Emily&quot; [Bronte?] </P>
    
    <P>Breathing --- &quot;We all share the same air&quot; [Both original and
      reprint] </P>
    
    <P>The Empty Bullring --- &quot;Happy anniverary to the P's&quot; [The P's
      could be the Picasso's.] </P>
    
    <P>Army Dreamers --- &quot;Life is to Love&quot; </P>
    
    <P>December Will Be --- &quot;Happy Christmas&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Sat in your Lap --- &quot;Well done J. B. 1st Dan&quot;
      <BR> [KATE: J.B. is a guy called John Barrot who certainly deserves to be
      congratulated 'cause he did something very clever. [Laughs] Very clever,
      you're not going to tell us anything further. No? Nope! (1982, Dreaming
      debut) </P>
    
    <P> Dans usually signify levels of achievement in various martial arts.]
    </P>
    
    <P>Lord of the Reedy --- &quot;Thank you Donovan&quot; [Who wrote the song,
      and is rumoured to have appeared on the single] </P>
    
    <P>The Dreaming --- &quot;for Rolf&quot; [Harris] </P>
    
    <P>There Goes A Tennor - &quot;Rays&quot; [On all copies] </P>
    
    <P>Cloudbusting --- &quot;for Peeps&quot; [Nickname of Peter Reich] </P>
    
    <P>Hounds of Love --- &quot;woof!&quot; and mysteriously &quot;cooperman&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>RUTH --- &quot;Precision SRI&quot; I'm not sure about SRI it's hard to
      see </P>
    
    <P>Under the Ivy --- &quot;Precision SM&quot; which is probably what SRI
      really </P>
    
    <P>This Woman's Work --- &quot;UP yours Ugly&quot; and &quot;Orlake&quot;
      <BR> [One guess is that &quot;Ugly&quot; refers to Vivian, the character
      played by Adrian Edmondson on &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. There was an
      episode where Vivian's mom came to visit him and generally harass him. I
      think it went something like: </P>
    
    <P> Mom: &quot;I brought you a present.&quot; (hands him a bottle of vodka)
    </P>
    
    <P> Viv: &quot;But it's empty!&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Mom: &quot;Haha! Up yours, ugly!&quot; (flips him the two-finger
      salute) </P>
    
    <P> Since there is a direct connection between Kate-&gt;Comic Strip-&gt;Young
      Ones, this is one theory. Another is that Kate had nothing to do with this
      message at all.] </P>
    
    <P>Be Kind to my Mistakes --- &quot;Orlake&quot; </P>

      <BR> Subject: **** KATE'S SESSION WORK PART I ***** </P>
    
    <P>KATE'S SESSION WORK AND UN-RELEASED TRACKS </P>
    
    <P>by Andrew Marvick (IED), Ron Hill, Neil Calton, Jeffrey C. Burka,
      Chris'n'Vickie, Paul Davison, and Scott Telford.
      <BR> Compiled and edited by Ron Hill. </P>
    
    <P>The numbers are from Andrew Marvick's complete listing of Kate's
      recorded tracks. </P>
    
    <P>14/15. Another Day. </P>
    
    <P>Sung by Kate and Peter on Kate's Christmas special. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: In the TV special the song that I sang with Peter Gabriel, &quot;Another
      Day,&quot; was written by Roy Harper - a very beautiful song from his
      album Flat Baroque and Berserk, which you can buy from your record shops
      along with his most recent one, which is brilliant. It's a really good
      song, and it will be on vinyl one day, hopefully soon, but not with this
      album. [Kate has still not released this recording.] (1980, KBC 5) </P>
    
    <P>Approximately one year after taping the &quot;Kate&quot; special, Kate
      and Peter Gabriel returned to the studio to re-record this song. It was
      never released, however, and has never been heard. </P>
    
    <P>Some bootlegs have a track name &quot;The Angel Gabriel&quot;. This is a
      little snippit of a song that Kate wrote to introduce Peter Gabriel when
      he was a guest on her Christmas special &quot;Kate&quot;. Kate, Paddy and
      Glenys Groves (one of the two backup singers on the tour) sang the
      following: </P>
    
    <P>ALL </P>
    
    <P> Through &lt;velvet?&gt; storms,
      <BR> and the rains that fell,
      <BR> here comes the man,
      <BR> with his tale to tell,
      <BR> and some have named him,
      <BR> PADDY (very deep) Pe-ter,
      <BR> ALL The An-gel Ga--bri--el. </P>
    
    <P>Peter then did an incredible solo version of &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot;
      on a Yamaha electric grand piano. </P>
    
    <P>16. Ibizza. </P>
    
    <P> A song co-written by Kate and Gabriel and originally intended as the
      b-side for the single of &quot;Another Day&quot;. They were &quot;not
      satisfied with the results&quot;, however, and the project was shelved.
      Consequently, no-one has ever heard this track. </P>
    
    <P>25. Them Heavy People. </P>
    
    <P>A cover version recorded by EMI artist Ray Shell on February 21, 1981,
      to which Kate contributed backing vocals. </P>
    
    <P>28. Sing, Children, Sing. </P>
    
    <P>A benefit single by Leslie Duncan, with Kate (virtually
      indistinguishable) singing in the all-star back-up chorus, released
      November 30, 1979. </P>
    
    <P>29. You (The Game, Part III). </P>
    
    <P>A duet with Roy Harper of his song, on his album &quot;The Unknown
      Soldier&quot;, recorded in February, 1980. A rumour persists that Kate and
      Harper recorded an entire album's worth of duets during these sessions,
      and that the tapes may someday become available on the black market. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: To work with him [Peter Gabriel] was really fun and a great
      experience - as it was to do some vocals on Roy Harper's new album [The
      Unknown Soldier]. I've been a fan of Roy's music for years, as have all my
      family, and to work with him on his music was very special. (1980, KBC 5)
    </P>
    
    <P>30. Flowers. </P>
    
    <P>A duet with Zaine Griff of his song, on his 1982 LP &quot;Figures&quot;,
      recorded in June, 1982. This song was a tribute to the dancer/mime/
      choreographer Lindsay Kemp, with whom Kate and Zaine had studied together
      for a time in 1976. Kate sang on this one track only. </P>
    
    <P>* Press reports say that you've made a record with Zaine Griff called &quot;Flowers&quot;,
      yet EMI records, your own record company, deny all knowledge. [Kate
      Laughs]. Well... is this true? </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Well I haven't made the record with him, all I did was sing some
      backing vocals on this song that Zaine wrote which is called &quot;Flowers&quot;
      and it's a lovely song. (1982, Unknown BBC interview) </P>
    
    <P>Q: I was told recently that you appeared on Zaine Griff's album Figures.
      Is this true? And what did you do, B.V.S or keyboards? </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Yes, I did. Zaine had written a song for Lindsay Kemp called &quot;Flowers,&quot;
      and he asked me to sing B.V.s. It is a really lovely song. Zaine and I met
      years ago at Lindsay's classes, and as Lindsay was such a powerful
      influence on us both - as he is on anyone who is captured by his strong
      magic - it was a real pleasure to be a part of something dedicated to him.
      (1984, KBC 16) </P>
    
    <P>31. No Self Control and Games Without Frontiers. </P>
    
    <P>Two tracks from Peter Gabriel's third solo album, for which Kate
      recorded backing vocals in January, 1980. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Offstage he's very normal, and that's the kind of thing I believe
      in. </P>
    
    <P>Kate helped out with the backing vocals on his excellent recent album,
      and describes the experience of walking into someone else's work as lovely
      - especially after the pressure of going out under your own name. </P>
    
    <P>I was thrilled to do it, and it's not often that I meet people in the
      same position that I can relate to. It's not like relating to people at
      EMI, as they're on a completely different side of the fence. (1981, RM)
    </P>
    
    <P>KATE: One of the things I've enjoyed this last year was to work with
      other artists on their projects. Isn't Peter Gabriel's single [&quot;Games
      Without Frontiers&quot;] fantastic? I can't wait to hear his new album
      [Peter Gabriel number 3]. Peter is an extremely talented and lovely man,
      and to work with him was really fun and a great experience. (1980, KBC 5)
    </P>
    
    <P>32. The Magician (theme from the film The Magician of Lublin). </P>
    
    <P>A song from the film starring Alan Arkin, it was recorded by Kate in
      February, 1979, and featured music by Maurice Jarre and lyrics by Paul
      Webster. No soundtrack was ever commercially released; consequently, the
      song is only known from the nearly unlistenable film print itself
      (dialogue obscures most of Kate's vocal). </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Maurice Jarre asked me to sing the song, which he had already
      written. The whole thing was a most enjoyable experience. (1984, KBC 17)
    </P>
    
    <P>53. Breathing and Do Bears Sh... in the Woods? </P>
    
    <P>Both live, from the album of the April 4/6, 1986 Comic Relief shows,
      called &quot;Utterly, Utterly Live&quot;. Kate accompanies herself on
      electric piano for &quot;Breathing&quot;, and sings the comic song (not of
      her composing) &quot;Do Bears Sh... in the Woods?&quot; with British comic
      actor Rowan Atkinson. The video version of these concerts features what
      appears to be a different night's performance of the same two songs. (The
      programme was performed a total of three times.) </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I really enjoyed doing the Comic Relief concerts. </P>
    
    <P>Q: I was more than a little shocked that you and Cliff Richard of all
      people... </P>
    
    <P>K: It was fantastic. I'm a big fan of so many of those comedians - they
      are so talented. For me, alternative comedy is the most exciting thing
      coming out of this country at the moment, and to be involved in something
      with them all was really fulfilling. I felt nervous there, too, it's been
      a long time since I've performed live to an audience, but they were so
      warm. Unfortunately the piano pedal jammed on the first night in &quot;Breathing&quot;
      and I sang to the most horrific combination of chords you can imagine, so
      the second and third nights were relatively relaxed after that! </P>
    
    <P>Singing with Rowan was hilarious. He's one of those people who can make
      his face and body language make you laugh without him having to speak.
      Again, I was so pleased that they asked me to take part. I wouldn't have
      missed it for the world. I just wish I'd been brave enough to ask most of
      them for their autographs - &quot;Er, Ben, would you? I say, Rick, I've
      got this nephew... Just sign it, don't bother signing it to him...&quot;
      You know, you're meant to act nonchalant, but I found myself starstruck.
    </P>
    
    <P>Q: I did see gorgeous Ronnie Corbett and the Monty Python chappies -
      wasn't Terry Gilliam there? </P>
    
    <P>Yes, he was...Just so much talent. British comedy is unique and the
      best. (1986, KBC 20) </P>
    
    <P>Q: How did you like singing with Rowan Atkinson? </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Well, I'm sure like most of you if not all of you, I'm a big fan
      of the comedy that's happening in Britain today. I think we've always been
      a leading voice in comedy and music, and it's so good to see young people
      actually charging us again with comedy that's also very educational. And I
      was very honoured to take part in that whole Comic Relief event where
      Rowan Atkinson was performing. And I really believe that comedy has a lot
      to offer the world. It's very important. Sometimes you can say much
      heavier things through comedy than you could ever say seriously. So I was
      knocked out to sing with Rowan and just to be involved in anything that
      they were doing. (1990 Kate Bush Con) </P>
    
    <P>The melody is a typical &quot;boring-70s-love-song-ballad&quot; sort of
      tune, and both KaTe and Rowan sing in an American crooning sort of voice,
      which sounds quite unlike KaTe's usual voice(s). The Curtis in
      Curtis/Atkinson is (I think) Richard Curtis, the co-writer of the
      Blackadder comedies, which explains a lot... </P>
    
    <P>54. Brazil. </P>
    
    <P>A cover of the old popular song, not included in the 1985 Terry Gilliam
      film &quot;Brazil&quot;, but promised for inclusion in the soundtrack
      LP--which, however, will probably never be officially released. A bootleg
      pressing of Kate's recording for the album may become available
      eventually, however. </P>
    
    <P>Q: I hear you sang &quot;Brazil&quot; on the soundtrack to Terry
      Gilliam's film. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Yes, what a beautiful song - and I always thought it was a really
      bad cabaret number, but actually it is very sad and nostalgic. </P>
    
    <P>Michael Kamen did the orchestral arrangements. He worked on The Ninth
      Wave: &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; and &quot;Hello Earth.&quot; He
      is very clever. He did the music for the film, and was putting the
      soundtrack album together with Terry, and they played me this beautiful
      arrangement without a voice. I'm not sure if this piece was in the film or
      not, but I don't sing in the film at all. It has such a 30s/40s feel, and
      Michael asked if I would sing over it - My immediate reactions were fear
      and &quot;Yes&quot;. (1986, KBC 20) </P>
    
    <P>57. Don't Give Up. </P>
    
    <P>A duet with Peter Gabriel of a song from his album &quot;So&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I was so excited that he asked me to sing on that track - It's
      such a lovely, haunting song, and I love his work. But I do get nervous,
      especially when it's something I really like. His music is very strong,
      and he is a great person - I love working with him. (1986, KBC 20) </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I was so thrilled he asked me to sing such a beautiful song but
      then I got very nervous. Recording at my home studio we don't have window
      contact between the studio and the control room, you know. We can't see
      each other, we talk to each other through the mike and headphones, that's
      all. It's quite isolated, the way I work, and I hadn't been to anyone
      else's studio for ages. And then at Real World I was terrified. I messed
      it up and had to come back another day to re-do it. (1989, Q) </P>
    
    <P>Interviewed in Record Mirror, May 10, p. 27, Peter said, &quot;Kate did
      a great job. I'm a great fan of her singing and her voice. I think she
      sang on that track very differently to how she sings on her own records --
      in a very sensitive way. There are similarities in the way we work. She
      works as slowly as I do -- with is reassuring.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Peter Gabriel's first compilation video, appropriately titled CV,
      includes two versions of &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;. Version 1 is the
      well-known video which MTV televised, featuring one unchanging camera
      angle of Kate and Gabriel embracing, and lip-synching the song in front of
      an eclipsing sun. Version 2, however, is a kind of impressionistic montage
      of narrative film which shows scenes of unemployment lines, driver's-seat
      shots of long, winding roads in the rain, and decaying factory-towns. In
      this version both Gabriel and Kate appear only sporadically, lip-synching
      with faces toward the viewer in super-imposed head-shots which fade in and
      out in one or another corner of the screen. The film is in color, but very
      drab and washed out to near-gray, and some of the imagery is slightly &quot;solarized&quot;.
      The VHS Hi-fi sound is extremely good. </P>
    
    <P>58. The Seer. </P>
    
    <P>A track from Big Country's 1986 album of the same name. Kate sings
      backing vocals. Also on &quot;Through a Big Country - Greatest Hits&quot;.
      She is credited with &quot;additional vocals&quot; which is a pretty good
      description, as it's hard to call what she's doing BVs. To get the full
      effect of the KaTeness of the song, try listening to it on headphones. The
      first verse is sung by Stuart Adamson alone, but I believe all the other
      verses are sort of a duet between the two, with Adamson's voice on one
      track, loud, and KaTe singing the same words on the other track, in kind
      of a wonderful whisper. Once you hear it like that a few times it becomes
      quite clear no matter what situation you hear the song in. </P>
    
    <P>KATE: I like the Celtic influences in their music. They were lovely to
      work with - I really enjoyed it. They asked if I'd like to do some backing
      vocals, and I went in for an evening. They were really nice. It was fun. I
      like working with different people. (1986, KBC 20) </P>
    
    <P>In a freebie mag from HMV in 1987, Big Country had this to say </P>
    
    <P>&quot;We'd done the song and one of our mates, a guy called Davy Duncan
      who used to play and sing in a band called The Shaking Pyramids, put down
      Barrad which is a sort of ethnic Scottish-Irish type hand-held drums - and
      it gave it a sort of folky feel, along with the mandolins and the sitars.
      We thought 'this song needs girl vocals on it' and Stuart immediately
      thought 'why don't we get Kate Bush?' We said there's only one way to do
      it and that's phone her management. They said that Kate would do it but
      she'd like to hear a cassette of the song first. So we sent a cassette
      there and she liked the song and she worked out her parts for the song,
      orchestrating them really well. Then she came to the studio and did them,
      it took her about twelve hours to do and it was just great, it was
      fantastic. I think the woman is just a complete genius. She was very shy.
      I think we were quite awestruck as well when she walked in. Tony was like
      'Oh, hello Kate, would you like a cup of coffee, would you like a glass of
      orange juice?', running about saying things like that. I think we were
      quite shy, she was quite shy as well. But she was good fun, she's got a
      good sense of humour as well. She's got a very 'Comic Strip' type of sense
      of humour which we immediately identified with and after that it was a
      great time.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Stuart said he's been a Kate fan for a long time in a 1986 Record
      Mirror: &quot;The Central character of the song &quot;The Seer&quot; is a
      woman, so I though (thought) it would be good to get a woman's vocal point
      of view. I have a lot of Kate Bush albums, and I like her voice. She
      varies it so much. There's a lot of variety and texture in the way she
      sings, and she's always coming up with something different. She's a
      perfectionist; she won't give up until she's absolutely satisfied with
      what she's done. She has a lot of dedication.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>59. The King is Dead. </P>
    
    <P>A track from Go West's 1987 album &quot;Dancing on the Couch&quot;. Kate
      sings backing vocals. She probably agreed to contribute to this track
      because of her friendship with the late guitarist Alan Murphy, who was an
      unofficial member of Go West at the time. </P>
    
    <P>It's amazing to IED that people would go to the trouble of coaxing the
      likes of Kate Bush to work on a recording with them (for surely that takes
      some doing), and then use her so minimally, and so unimaginatively, and so
      anonymously, that they might just as well have got any session singer in
      England to do the job instead! Don't misunderstand, please: Kate is
      recognizable -- to the very careful listener; and both the song and Kate's
      back-up vocals are well crafted and not without merit. It's just that
      there's not much to it, and what little there is makes little use of what
      Kate has to offer. Oh, well, it's no big deal. The rest of the album is
      equally well made -- a bit like Aja-era Steely Dan, but with Don Fagan's
      vocals replaced by a slick singer from the school of Boy George Michael:
      catchy, even attractive, but generally disposible. </P>
    
    <P>60. Let It Be. </P>
    
    <P>7&quot; and 12&quot; single by Ferry Aid for the survivors and families
      of the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster. Kate sang three lines of the song
      during a separate studio session unrelated to the rest of the recording.
    </P>
    
    <P>61. Running Up That Hill and Let It Be (both live). </P>
    
    <P>Songs performed by Kate in concert on behalf of Amnesty International's &quot;The
      Secret Policeman's Third Ball&quot; shows. The second of the two Amnesty
      concert performances of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is included on
      the official soundtrack album, and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (backed with a
      poor-quality recording of the first of the two Amnesty performances of &quot;Running
      Up That Hill&quot;) is available as a bootleg seven-inch single. </P>
    
    <P>64. Sister and Brother. </P>
    
    <P>Duet with Midge Ure of his song, from his album &quot;Answers to Nothing&quot;,
      released in September 1988. </P>
    
    <P>65. Spirit of the Forest. </P>
    
    <P>Kate sings one line in a guest appearance for the &quot;all-star&quot;
      recording of a song (not written by Kate) about the dwindling rain forests
      of South America. This song was recorded for and broadcast during a
      programme about ecological issues called &quot;Our Common Future&quot; in
      1989. As with the Zeebrugge &quot;Let It Be&quot; charity record (see
      entry 60), Kate did not participate in the group chorus sessions, but came
      in at a different time to sing her one line alone. </P>
    
    <P>Once </P>
    
    <P>From Roy Harper's 1990 album. Kate appears for the last part (third) of
      the title track, doing some fairly quiet singing of the chorus of the
      song, then near the end a few seconds of louder &quot;la-la&quot; type
      singing. The music was written entirely by Harper - no input came from
      Kate at all. </P>
    
    <P>The album cover photgraphy was done by John Carder Bush, and that (of
      course) Del Palmer engineered Kate's session in Kent. </P>
    
    <P>(Kate comes in at &quot;the dance of love&quot;) </P>
    
    <P>Earth for all creatures
      <BR> a thought for all (wo)men
      <BR> right for the speechless
      <BR> wrong until then? </P>
    
    <P>Eyes for the laughter
      <BR> thirst for the tongue
      <BR> hands for together
      <BR> ears for the song </P>
    
    <P>the song of love
      <BR> we sing in silence
      <BR> every moment long </P>
    
    <P>once
      <BR> here to be done to as we do
      <BR> with only one chance
      <BR> here for the wonder of under the stars
      <BR> for the one and only
      <BR> once </P>
    
    <P>Joy for the children
      <BR> hope for the chance
      <BR> men for the women
      <BR> now for the dance </P>
    
    <P>the dance of love
      <BR> we dance just once
      <BR> in unique circumstance </P>
    
    <P>once
      <BR> here to be done to as we do
      <BR> with only one chance
      <BR> here for the wonder of under the stars
      <BR> for the one and only once </P>
    
    <P>NO SHOWS (songs Kate turned down) </P>
    
    <P>Moonraker - In May of 1979, Kate was invited to sing the title track for
      this James Bond film. </P>
    
    <P>In a film magazine it said that you turned down the offer of singing the
      title song to the James Bond film Moonraker. Is this so, and if so, why?
    </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Yes, this is true. I thought it was a very lovely song, but I just
      didn't think it was for me. I think Shirley Bassey did it a lot better
      than I would have, anyway. (1980, KBC 5) </P>
    
    <P>Alain Stivell - The original plan, as bruited about by Homeground and
      the KBC, was that Kate had accepted Stivell's offer to produce two tracks
      for Stivell's next album. Then a while later she went to France and said
      (so IED has been told) that she was about to go to work on Stivell's
      album. </P>
    
    <P>IED picked up the album in September of 1991 (during a visit to France),
      after seeing that two of the tracks had been co-written by one John Calder
      &lt;sic&gt; Bush. Alas! Upon closer inspection, IED discovered that Kate
      is mentioned nowhere in the album's credits, nor is her presence in any
      way audible (to this fan) on any of the tracks. Moreover, in the cassette
      version which IED bought, there is no lyric sheet, and since Stivell's
      voice is peculiarly accented and far back in the mix, IED hasn't even been
      able thus far to transcribe John Carder Bush's lyrics. Altogether a huge
      fiasco from a Kate Bush fan's standpoint, though perhaps Stivell fans will
      be satisfied. In any event, there has yet to appear any explanation of the
      mix-up in the press, Kate-ian or otherwise.</P>
    
    <P>Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves - According to Homeground 43, Kate may
      have be approached to sing the title track, which later became a
      world-wide hit, but turned it down. </P>
