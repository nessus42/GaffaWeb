 Carder Bush narration from &quot;Jig of Life&quot; at Larry's party. He's
rushing off to  practise for the big performance now.

<P>Date: Mon, 29 Jul 1991 17:41:51 -0800 <BR> From: ed@wente.llnl.gov (Ed
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: A San Jose Katemas 
</P>
<P>A few weeks ago I became acquainted with Karen Newcombe, who is a huge 
Katefan, but who thought she was the only one in the Bay Area. (Note that this
is  NOT the person I met at that radio station survey I went to a while ago.) I
was  determined to show her that this was not the case. She lives in San
Francisco, but  has no car, so I offered to pick her up at a BART station and
drive her to Larry's  place in San Jose, so she could experience her first
Katemas. 
</P>
<P>I had promised Larry that I would help set up, so I arrived about 10:30 am
with  lots of posters, records, magazines, etc. Andy Marvick (IED) had just
arrived with  his laserdisc player and his own enormous collection of stuff. A
little later Larry  Yaeger arrived with a couple more VCRs -- in the end there
were five hooked up,  as well as the disc player, so we had every combination of
player and recorder. 
</P>
<P>People started showing up in large numbers around 1:00 pm. Nearly everyone, 
upon entering Larry's condo, reacted to the posters that covered nearly all the
wall  space. And we didn't even have room for most of Andy's posters! Another
thing  that drew the attention of people was Larry's KTISGOD license plate, now 
autographed by Kate! She wrote, on both sides of the plate, 'To Larry with love,
 Kate Bush.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Jon Drukman and John Relph showed up with a whole music store: a
synthesiser,  a drum machine, and a mandolin. They called themselves &quot;They
Might Be Midgets.&quot;  We had to wait until Tracy Roberts arrived so she could
be the lead vocalist. The  first thing they did was &quot;Jig of Life&quot;,
with Tracy as Kate, Andy Marvick as Jon  Carder Bush (reading the poem at the
end), Jon on the keyboards and drum  machine, and John on the mandolin, which
sounded great as a substitute for the  Irish strings. It sounded fantastic -- a
lot better than I had expected. At the end they  got a big round of applause. We
wanted them to try something else, so Jon started  playing around on the drum
machine with the rhythm of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;How about that?&quot; someone asked. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Nah,&quot; said Jon. &quot;I can't play the synthesiser and the drum
machine at the same  time.&quot; (In JoL, Jon played the synth during Kate's
vocal, and the drum machine  during the instrumental section.) &quot;But I do
have the drum track for 'Hounds Of  Love' already programmed.&quot; So they did
that song, with a trio of women as the  vocalist, and the whole crowd (which
numbered about 25 then) joining in for the  barks and the chorus. I sure wish we
had a tape recorder going because was an  amazing event -- we were all SO into
the song! 
</P>
<P>We called up the Boston party and tried to get them to listen, but each time
 something went wrong. For JoL the phone was not in a good place, so they
couldn't  here it. For HoL we had the phone right up to the speaker, but for
some reason the  line was dead when the song was over. 
</P>
<P>Jon then played a cassette of some stuff he recorded in years past. For
Katemas  two years ago he made a very bizarre version of RUTH, in which he used
a device  to &quot;push his voice into the Minnie Mouse range,&quot; as someone
put it at the time. He  played Jenn Turney singing &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
with the reconstructed original  Joyce lyrics, and then Jenn singing (very
nicely, I might add) &quot;Under The Ivy.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Andy and I had a lot of door prizes to give away. They included such things
as the  &quot;Love And Anger&quot; US cassette single, Kate Convention programs,
magazines with  Kate interviews, and spare singles that Andy had lying around.
In the end nearly  everyone won something, so Andy felt sorry for the few people
who hadn't. He  scrounged around in his collection and eventually found stuff to
give those people.  What a guy! 
</P>
<P>Peter and Charlie Manchester had to leave in the afternoon, but Peter
promised  that he would be back later that evening to play show-and-tell. 
</P>
<P>Of course, all day we played lots and lots of videos, ranging from the
ridiculous  American interviews on VHS to the sublime music videos on laserdisc.
We debated  what the thing Kate wears on her arm in &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;
is -- we thought it  might have to do with either archery or falconry. We held a
mirror up to the TV  screen in order to read some backward writing in &quot;Cloudbusting.&quot;
(We were  wondering what Wilhelm Reich writes in his notebook. You can't see it
well while  he's writing, but a few seconds later he holds the paper up to the
light and if you  have a good freeze-frame you can see the backward writing
through the paper. We  think it says, &quot;My final paper&quot; or My last
paper.&quot; 
</P>
<P>By stepping very slowly through &quot;The Big Sky&quot; we found the bright
flashes  during the scene when Kate is in a bright circle surrounded by points
of light. These  flashes take up only about one frame, so Andy said, &quot;They
can't serve any purpose  except to be discovered by fans diligent enough to go
through her videos frame by  frame!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Karen Newcombe made a contribution to Kate lore by making a good stab at 
explaining the last part of &quot;There Goes A Tenner.&quot; She thinks the
criminals are  looking back at earlier times when they did simpler crimes.
Remember, Kate has  said that this song is about some crooks on their first
major job. Karen supposes that  they used to be pickpockets. Hence &quot;pockets
floating in the breeze&quot; -- there were  pockets everywhere, so it was an
easy life. &quot;When you would carry me&quot; refers to the  practice of
pickpockets to help each other -- one would distract the mark while the  other
would perform the actual theft. &quot;There goes a tenner&quot; refers to the
small  amounts they'd take in these thefts. What do people think? 
</P>
<P>After dark Peter Manchester came back. He told us this fascinating story of
how  he came to write a letter to Kate back in 86 or so. He had set up his
living room  with piles of electronic gear and cables everywhere in order to
pick up Kate videos  from a channel he couldn't normally get; he called the room
his &quot;Kate Bush  observatory&quot;. Someone asked him at the time, &quot;Is
there anyone else whom you love  as much as you love Kate Bush?&quot; &quot;No,&quot;
said Peter, apparently surprised that anyone  would even bother to ask such a
question. He says he's not quite as far gone  nowadays. &quot;Why don't you
write to her,&quot; suggested the other person. 
</P>
<P>So he did. He told us all about how he decided what to say, how he put in a 
several paragraph hook at the beginning to draw Kate's attention, (&quot;She 
undoubtedly gets dozens of these letters, and I wanted to put something in to
grab  her attention.&quot;), how he got the actual address where Kate was living
at the time (to  me this is REALLY amazing), and how he used Tibetan mysticism
to &quot;channel&quot; the  letter straight to her. 
</P>
<P>Only three weeks later he got an envelope in the mail from England. It felt
stiff,  so Peter thought it might contain an autographed photo. He opened it and
inside was  a card folded in two -- like you can buy at a Hallmark shop. He
opened it and bang!  The inside was covered with Kate's writing! Top to bottom,
no margins! He showed  it to us (this was the show-and-tell he referred to
earlier). Kate thanked him for his  ideas and was generally really nice,
considering Peter had made an egregious error  in his transcription of some of
Kate's lyrics, something he now admits. 
</P>
<P>After that, Katemas started winding down, and around 1:00 am the last of us
left.

</P>
<P>Vickie here. 
</P>
<P>I had a wonderful time Saturday!!! Thanks to everybody who came. I enjoyed 
meeting everybody and I hope you had a good time too. 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Larry on the West Coast and Gregory on the East Coast for calling.
It  was a bit confusing on our end (what with 3 phones off the hook, Chris
frantically  hooking up my microphone to relay the calls from the speakerphone
to the living  room speakers and us getting a call-waiting beep while talking to
Boston--our front  gate is wired to the phone system, plus we were expecting a
phone call from Dave  Cross in England that never came) but still, it was way
fun and we all enjoyed the  calls. Larry, Andy, Ed, Gregory, woj, Jessica,
Doug...it was great to hear your voices. 
</P>
<P>Dave Datta, you left your TSW laser disc here. Jorn, you left Cloudbusting
(big  applause to Ron Hill!!!!) here. 
</P>
<P>GREAT hats Jorn! 
</P>
<P>David Gravender came all the way from Toronto and we enjoyed having him
here.  Ken Brownfield came from Champaign (did you get overwhelmed by all the
stuff I  showed you Sunday? :-) Jerry (? My memory is so bad, I can't remember
your  name. I should have had sign-up sheets) came from Lafayette, IN, Dave
Datta came  from Kenosha, Wis. and brought 2 wonderful friends with him. Thanks
for the Area  tape Dave! Everyone else was from the greater Chicago area. Thanks
for coming!!! 
</P>
<P>Jeff Lueck &amp; Mitch Pravitiner, good to meet you, Jorn and Mike
Mendelson,  always glad to see you two. Patrick, our old friend and a Kansas
City Suspended In  Gaffa listener, it was a treat that you could be here.
Kirstin, thanks for the Katemas  tree, Ivy and delicious chocolate cake! Jorn,
thanks for the Waldorf salad! Jeff,  thanks for the wonderful seedcake (the
first time I've ever had it) and the lasagna.  Ken, thanks for taking Chris to
the airport Sunday. David, say hi! to Kim and the  next time you come, please
bring Jane Siberry and Mary Margaret O'Hara with you  OK? :-) :-) 
</P>
<P>I hope I haven't forgotten any other Love-Hounds. Knowing my memory, I'm 
forgetting somebody. The other people who were here aren't on the net. Maybe we 
can fix that! 
</P>
<P>Till next year... 
</P>
<P>Happy Birthday Kate!

</P>
<P> Hi! Since today is Her birthday, I decided to wear my KaTe &quot;Ninth Wave&quot;
 T-shirt to work, even tho we're not s'posed to wear T's at the office. Anyway,
one  of the fellows in our building who works in another office, who came up to
use our  Xerox, saw my T-shirt and he just about hit the ceiling. &quot;OOH!
Another Kate fan!&quot;  Needless to say, it was nice to discover someone else
so close by who has the same  excellent taste in music as I do... 
</P>
<P>I also listened to nothing but KaTe CD's at work today on my portable
player...  ah, bliss........! 
</P>
<P>All in all, it would been great if our power lines hadn't been hit by
lightning and  I hadn't gotten zapped when the surge came through the line just
as I had BOTH  hands on the terminal... yeah, I know, the surge protector
should've handled it.  Still, I got one heckuva jolt! My arms still hurt! Does
this mean my KaTemas was  truly &quot;electrifying,&quot; ha ha????!!!

<P>Hope everyone had a great day!

</P>
<P> Hello, Love-Hounds! 
</P>
<P>IED wanted to post a big thankyou note to Larry Hernandez for hosting what 
was for IED one of the best Katemas parties ever. IED had a terrific time from
start  to finish (it was more like three than one, Ed!) It was great to see some
of the  veteran Love-Hounds names in the flesh for the first time, and to
discover (as IED  had suspected all along, frankly) that Jon Drukman the man was
not quite as caustic  or prickly in person as in phosphor. A big thankyou to
Peter Manchester (spelling,  Peter?) for sharing some very personal and
absolutely magical (divine?) information  about Kate the KorrespondenT. 
</P>
<P>It was great to get together with old friends Larry, Ed and Tracy again, and
to  see so many other familiar faces, as well. And it was also a pleasure
meeting the  newcomers--Karen Newcombe in particular, whose expliKation de
teKsTe for  &quot;TGaTenner&quot; was a revelation. Thanks are due to Larry
Yaeger (sp.?), too, for his  wizardry and patience. And IED looks forward to
seeing several old Kate interviews  from the keyboard of Ron Hill, now that
tapes of hitherto untranscribed radio shows  have been transferred safely into
his hands. 
</P>
<P>A huge round of applause for Larry, folks. And how 'bout those Kaps?!

<P>From: Dances With Voles &lt;jondr@sco.COM&gt; <BR> Date: Thu, 1 Aug 1991
10:27:29 -0800 <BR> Subject: Katemas in San Jose 
</P>
<P>Well, all I can say for those who didn't make it to the San Jose Katemas
party is:  &quot;sorry.&quot; It was just amazing. Surrounded by posters,
magazines, discs, videos,  postcards, pictures, articles... and a whole bunch of
really neat people that I am  Damned Proud to have frittered away 10 hours of my
life with. Of course, the  salutary reception of They Might Be Midgets (me on
technical jiggery pokery, John  &quot;The Amazing Relphster&quot; Relph on
heavenly mandolin, and Tracy &quot;Love Goddess&quot;  Roberts on vocal
orgasmatronics) was gratifying, and it was really cool to see the rest  of the
crowd barking their throats off on &quot;Hounds Of Love.&quot; I just wish I
wasn't so  occupied trying to read the sheet music while they were all singing -
it looked like  they were having a lot of fun! 
</P>
<P>Naturally, I have to mention that after 5.5 years of philocanine
involvement, I  finally met my eloquent sparring partner, Mr. Andrew Marvick:
the man, the  legend, the god. Somehow I don't think he expected someone as
young as I turned  out to be, but we must all bear in mind that I started my
career as a love-hound  when I was but a tender lad of 18. Anyway, Andy was a
delight, and his performance  as a John Carder Bush stand-in (on &quot;Jig Of
Life&quot;) was First Rate. His willingness to  listen and entertain any point
of view, no matter how clearly insane, was wonderful.  Obviously we have a
classic Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy here between Andrew and IED.  Then again, most
people that know me in real life say the same thing. 
</P>
<P>From the point of view of my Kateological studies, the party was an
unqualified  smash. I finally got to see GLC and Les Dogs (both excellent) and
the infamous  Japanese videos, which are a scream. I am probably going to hang
up my Kate  parodying gloves after having seen what those Japanese folks did to
&quot;Them Heavy  People.&quot; For those not blessed enough to have seen it...
well, words hardly do it  justice, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, imagine
the Lawrence Welk orchestra  playing a jazzed-up supermarket muzak version of
Them Heavy People, with two  outrageously goggle-eyed Japanese ladies (in the
height of late 70's fashion) singing  the words. Halfway through, Kate comes
jogging onto a set, surrounded by a couple  of bone-skinny Japanese guys wearing
long scarves tied around their heads. They  burst into a routine straight out of
Solid Gold, with Kate contorting in some  sub-standard MTV-ready aerobic dance
moves. Unbelievable. It was just  unbelievable. Truly the most amazing piece of
video I've seen in ages. I loved every  second of it, and the incredible
brain-damage they foisted on Them Heavy People  has made me rue the day I ever
decided to put sound to tape in an attempt to &quot;spice  up&quot; some classic
KT songs. Yes folks, those wily Japanese have made even my  Mangled Bloody Remix
of Love and Anger seem totally normal. I'm going to retire  and cut an album of
nothing but waterfall noises accompanied by the shrieks of my  pet cockatiel as
I jab him with a knitting needle. 
</P>
<P>To all who attended, and all KT fans everywhere - happy Katemas!

<P>Date: Thu, 1 Aug 1991 20:43:00 -0800 <BR> From: Peter Byrne Manchester &lt;PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: Katemas in San Jose revisited 
</P>
<P> Arriving back from California late last night, jet-bedraggled if not
strictly  speaking jet-lagged, it was exciting to catch up on a week's worth of
love-hounds  digests, spanning Katemas and including Ed Suranyi's and Andrew
Marvick's  comments about the San Jose party at Larry Hernandez's place. Jon
Drukman's  initial observations came in today, and several short posts from
others who were  there have been arriving, but there remain a few notes I'd like
to sound. 
</P>
<P>Absolutely, thanks to Larry Hernandez for putting not just his apartment but
his  LIFE on the line (you or me ever host a party for 25+, from noon hour till
the wee  ones, in a smallish four room apartment?!?). But thanks too to Ed and
Andy, who  were the core of the Party Engineering team, consulting with Larry
H., drawing on  wise heads like Larry Y. and the apparently limitless Ron Hill,
and eliciting  suggestions from all who had any, so that the day's calendar of
music, video,  interviews, performances, and events was neither a spectacle nor
a ritual, but a  celebration in which everyone could truly feel they shared. 
</P>
<P>The more I think of it, the more admiring I become. What would it be like, I
 wondered, as someone who had never met any of the love-hounds, much less gone 
to London for the convention, to be in a room with Andrew Marvick, Ed Suranyi, 
Ron Hill, Larry Hernandez, Jon Drukman, and all their gear and rarities? I
mention  only those well-known to me from the regularity of their postings. Doug
Alan, Bill  Wisner, Chris 'n' Vickie, Jorn Barger, Neal Caldwell--sure, there
were some senior  people missing or at other parties (and contact was made, as
Ed recounted)--but I  had to think that there was no other place on the face of
the planet that day where  so much enthusiasm for and expertise about Kate Bush
was constellated. &quot;Andy here  probably knows more about Kate than anybody
else in the world,&quot; someone  commented mid-afternoon. &quot;Probably more
than she does,&quot; said Andy--something  that IED would never profess in a
million years with a straight face, proving that he  doesn't always wear one. 
</P>
<P>What would it be like? Sweet and easy, natural and informative, not much 
different for me who knew something about these folk than it was for others who 
didn't. At 48 I was not the oldest, at 23.5 Dances With Voles was not the
youngest. In  fact, I've rarely been in a group with less 'ism': age-ism,
sexism, in-ism, out-ism. It  was Katemas, a hot and memorable day not far from
Stevens Creek and Winchester  in San Jose, within five miles of which my life
had revolved from 1958 through 1973,  but rarely on so sharp a point. 
</P>
<P>At one point that night Ron Hill said &quot;Anybody taking notes?&quot;
Well, no, actually.  No more than anybody thought to gear up to record They
Might Be Midgets that  afternoon. It wasn't like that--none of that
self-consciousness. I figured we would  all just help each other out, and in
that spirit a couple of small corrections to Ed the  Observer's preliminary
report. 
</P>
<P>&gt;Peter and Charlie Manchester had to leave in the afternoon, but Peter
promised  that he would be back later that evening to play show-and-tell. 
</P>
<P>Not quite: I came by that afternoon with my youngest brother Bill from Santa
 Cruz, who turned out already to know the estimable Tracy Roberts who sang lead 
with They Might Be Midgets. Charlie is not Charlie Manchester, but Charlie
Cockey,  proprietor of Fantasy, Etc., a sweet little bookstore at Larkin and
O'Farrell in SF  where Katefans will definitely get special attention. Charlie
IS a brother, though,  even if not child of my mother, both because we go way
back, and because he is the  one who turned me on to Kate in March 1985. I left
the party around 6:30 to drive up  to the City and haul Charlie back down with
me, returning about 9:45. 
</P>
<P>&gt; [About what TMBM would do after &quot;JoL&quot;] &quot;But I do have
the drum track for  'Hounds of Love' already programmed.&quot; So they did that
song, with a trio of women  as the vocalist, and the whole crowd (which numbered
about 25 then) joining in for  the barks and the chorus. ... 
</P>
<P>Actually, this was more amazing still. Jon said that he HAD made a drum
track  tape for HoL, but had accidentally erased it. Everybody was hungry for
the song,  though. So, in what was for me a particularly convincing display of
heads-up  command of his tools and real musicianship, he cobbled up a
serviceable program on  the spot in about 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>Let the record show, by the way, that the craft and splendor of 
Jon-as-Kate-as-Madonna's performance of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was not
lost upon  elements of the crowd. If IED has betimes been the love-hounds'
numinous  curmudgeon (Jorn Barger), Jon Drukman is its slamdancer. He's a
prodigy and a  sweet lad. Believe it. Just don't bank on it. Mr. Drukman can
nail it down solid, and  blow you away if you dance the fool. 
</P>
<P>&gt; ... We held a mirror up to the TV screen in order to read some backward
 writing in &quot;Cloudbusting.&quot; (We were wondering what Wilhelm Reich
writes in his  notebook. You can't see it well while he's writing, but a few
seconds later he holds  the paper up to the light and if you have a good
freeze-frame you can see the  backward writing through the paper. We think it
says, &quot;My final paper&quot; or My last  paper.&quot; By stepping 
</P>
<P>Not quite: the company couldn't decide between &quot;My final paper&quot; or
&quot;My final  proposal.&quot; There may have been some uncertainly as between &quot;final&quot;
and &quot;last,&quot; but I  recall a consensus for &quot;final&quot; and an
open question between &quot;paper&quot; and &quot;proposal.&quot;  (I incline to
the later.) 
</P>
<P> Thanks to Ed for recounting my uncorking that night about writing to Kate
and  getting a reply, and to Andy for his kind words about it. It WAS &quot;absolutely
magical&quot;  for me at the time, and I guess I've hungered ever since to be
able to share that. As  to &quot;divine,&quot; I pass along Charlie's
observation that IED backwards is DEI, &quot;the gods,&quot;  so it's his call. 
</P>
<P>Quite a trip to California, Katemas at the center of it. Thank you all
again--also  from Bill and Charlie, who have no net access, but now know what
they're missing. 
</P>

<BR> Subject: from Little Light 
</P>
<P> The following appears in Little Light, Summer 1991, published by The
American  Association of Them Heavy People, PO Box 221, Cuyahoga Falls OH
44222-0221. 
</P>
<P>Replies are welcome, as are letters to the editor or other discussion. 
</P>
<P>FAN CONVENTION 
</P>
<P>The first AATHP sponsored Kate Bush Fan Convention was an interesting, 
informative, and enjoyable event, at least according to the people we talked to
there.  While the convention was an unmitigated success among the attendees, and
our  mailbag suffered from accolades, the convention was also a success for
AATHP, and  perhaps a not-so-wise business move for CD Connection, the fiscal
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>The event was loosely scheduled; we allowed everybody to pretty much roam 
around as they pleased. One of the most interesting displays was Cappy Petri's 
collection of Kate stuff. Cappy's collection spanned all periods of Kate's
career, and  his table was very well received. The other main attraction was
Scott Shepard's  vendor table. While most people merely browsed, many were able
to add to their  Kate Bush collections. We also had displays from the National
Geographic Society (on  Aborigines, but we weren't able to use the display to
its full effect) the Houdini  Museum of Appleton, Wisconsin, and a few other
scattered items of interest (such as  the video collection). The Bronte Society
wants to apologize for not making it to the  convention, as they had some thing
come up that morning which prevented their  attendance. 
</P>
<P>One of the highlights of the convention was the auction, called by our very
own  Scott Shepard. He had the interest of everybody with a funny running
dialogue  about the incredible uses you could put the auction items to, if only
somebody would  buy them. At one point everybody was in stitches over his
description of driving  around town with a life-size Kate cardboard cutout in
the front seat, and the effect  that would have on your image. In the spirit of
a fan convention, rather than a  record convention, everything went for
incredibly low prices- in one case an  autographed Dreaming was let go for forty
bucks. Much to our surprise, Marilyn  Gardner, the Sony Music representative
placed bids on several items and won  bidding on the most expensive item on the
block: a Kate stand-up promotional  display from the early EMI days. 
</P>
<P>Also notable was Marilyn's ad lib presentation on the once and future
promotion  of Kate by Sony, in which she clarified many of the actions Sony took
after the  release of The Sensual World and expressed a desire to do an even
more thorough  job on the next album. She took questions from the attendees
before leaving. 
</P>
<P>Earlier in the day Marilyn met for an hour or so with Jeff Medkeff, who was 
interested in doing some lobbying on behalf of Kate's American fans. As a result
of  their meeting, Sony promised to support AATHP and its local chapters in any
way  practical, most visibly by providing decorations and special giveaways for
AATHP  sponsored events. Sony will also be allowing us to put our members on
their mailing  list of people and companies they send promotional mailers to. 
</P>
<P>Video was an unexpected attraction at the convention, inspiring the upcoming
 AATHP video party. Everyone was fascinated by the unedited interviews and 
unusual TV performances, as most people hadn't had the opportunity to see them 
before.We went through our tapes (representing, foolishly, an incomplete
collection)  at least twice, and at one point Jeff Medkeff made the mistake of
asking for  requests. Naturally the first five were requests for things we
didn't have. 
</P>
<P>Throughout the day there was all kinds of speculation about what the &quot;Big
 Surprise&quot; listed on the agenda was going to be. Attendees had to wait
until the  closing ceremonies to find out. Messages were sent by several of
Kate's fan clubs  and fanzines, as well as Rolling Stone, Nigel Kennedy, Roy
Harper, the Trio  Bulgarka, David Gilmour, and Peter Gabriel, (or their
management or record  company publicity departments on their behalf) giving
greetings and thanks to the  convention attendees. The message from Gabriel went
over quite well, calling Kate a  &quot;great artist&quot; and garnering a
partial standing ovation from the crowd. A last minute  surprize call from a
publicist provided an unexpected message from Kate: 
</P>
<P> &quot;I'm very pleased this is taking place here today. If some of you came
from a  long distance I hope you have found it worthwhile, and I want to say
thank you to  you all for being here. I'm in the studio starting to record my
seventh album. It is  due to be released later this year, but I cannot talk
about it until it is properly  recorded. I think this is wonderful and I'm very
pleased you let me know about it.  Love Kate Bush.&quot; 
</P>
<P> After closing the convention, several AATHP staffers had dinner with
Richard  and Melissa Caldwell, and Phil Smith and talked about everything Kate
related we  could think of. Jeff Medkeff was unfortunatly suffering from an
acute lack of sleep  by that time, and alas, it showed. 
</P>
<P>The next day featured a special breakfast with Dave Schreck, the 
farthest-traveled at tendee, and the long awaited Paddy Bush Impersonation
Contest,  which was won by default by Jeff (nobody else participated, but that's
not to say  Jeff's performance wasn't good for a laugh. For those unfamiliar,
this involved  impersonating Paddy's performance in Experiment IV.) 
</P>
<P>It was an enjoyable enough day that the staff was inclined to do it again,
so we  have scheduled another convention for August 1 of next year. 
</P>
<P>We'd like to thank everybody who attended for making our day enjoyable and 
one of the real highlights of the year thus far. We look forward to doing it
again!

Convention messages 
</P>
<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P>The Ohio message followed by excerpts of the '84 Bush-Con message: 
</P>
<P>&gt; I'm very pleased this is taking place here today. If some of you came
from a  long distance I hope you have found it worthwhile, and I want to say
thank you to  you all for being here. I'm in the studio starting to record my

about it until it is properly  recorded. I think this is wonderful and I'm very
pleased you let me know about it.  Love Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>} Firstly, I think I should say that I am very honoured indeed that this
event is  taking place here to-night. I believe that some of you have come a
long way, too, and  that means a lot to me. I hope that none of you feel that
you journeys been wasted. 
</P>
<P>  (deleted) 
</P>
<P>I am talking to you from my studio and we've just started recording the next
 album. It's due to be released in the autumn and I'll be working throughout the
 summer to get it finished. It's almost impossible to talk about music before
it's been  recorded properly. 
</P>
<P>  (deleted) 
</P>
<P> Make up your own mind if a recently fired CBS staffer fudged a message, if
the  folks at AATHP/LL fudged a message, or if Kate's creativity has deserted
her to  the extent of saying almost the same thing in two different messages 6
or 7 years  apart. 
</P>
<P>Our friend Patrick pointed out that the Bush-Con message uses subjunctive
tense  in the last sentence, which is Kate's usual speaking style. The
corresponding  sentence in the Ohio message is purely declarative. 
</P>
<P>The known handwritten letters by Kate are written as though she were
speaking.  Simply put, we can hear Kate in our mind's ear saying the latter but
not the former.

<P>From: barger@aristotle.ils.nwu.edu (Jorn Barger) <BR> Date: Fri, 15 Nov
1991 13:58:47 -0800 <BR> Subject: Medkeff Unmasked!!! 
</P>
<P>...or, Ohioans Bite the Dust! 
</P>
<P>[Precis so far: Jeff Medkeff of AATHP/Little Light fame claimed some months 
ago to have an exclusive inside contact at Sony, and special privileges
regarding  advance notice of Kate's plans. He threw a Convention that was only
announced to  us a couple of weeks before it took place, and boasted in print
that he read  congratulatory messages there from everyone from Kate to the Trio
to PG to Dave  G, etc etc etc. Based on a very vague report of the text of
Kate's message, Chris and  Vickie seemed to have gone way too far out on the
limb by publicly expressing  skepticism that the message was real, suggesting it
may have been spliced together  from the Canadian Con's similar tape. Certain
flaming Ohioans leapt to Jeff's  defense, and shillelagh law was all the rage
(as the song says). Jeff produced a  message that corresponded in almost every
detail to the Canadian message. Jeff  broadcast a report that Sony was
threatening Kate with penalties for missing a  promised delivery date. All were
incredulous...] 
</P>
<P>Little Light, Fall 1991 
</P>
<P>&quot;THE FOLLOWING IS AN OPEN LETTER FROM THE COUNCIL OF THE  AMERICAN
ASSOCIATION OF THEM HEAVY PEOPLE TO OUR READERS  AND ALL THOSE INTERESTED: 
</P>
<P>To all concerned, 
</P>
<P>It should be apparent at this time that Jeff Medkeff is no longer Editor of
Little  Light, nor does he hold the position of President of AATHP. On September
16, 1991,  it was brought to our attention that Jeff Medkeff reportedly printed
an interview  with Marilyn Gardner of Sony Music which was fabricated. 
</P>
<P>While this interview only reached a few of our readers, as we did not run
the  interview in our second printing, we still feel that any false impressions
that may  have been caused by the interview should be corrected. The interview
should be, in  no way, [sic] regarded as the actual opinions of Ms. Gardner. Her
opinions are  unknown to the staff of this newsletter. We also invite Ms.
Gardner to respond in  the next issue of Little Light. 
</P>
<P>Because of the interview and other ethical questions, we attempted to remove
Mr.  Medkeff with a vote of &quot;no confidence.&quot; However, because there
are no allowances  for such an act under the bylaws, on September 26, we
respectively tendered our  resignations from the AATHP council as a surrogate
form of casting our &quot;no  confidence&quot; votes. Mr. Medkeff recognized
this as such and offered his resignation,  allowing us to continue with AATHP
functions and the production of Little Light. 
</P>
<P>We have decided to do so and promise our readers the honesty that should be 
expected from any publication. We also apologize to Ms. Gardner and Sony Music
for  any false impression that may have resulted from the allegedly fabricated
interview.  We feel that any violation of AATHP rules, Little Light editorial
policies and in  particular journalistic ethics is intolerable. We hope our
actions on the matter will  justify everyone's respect for our newsletter and
that we never have to question  another staff member's ethics again. 
</P>
<P>Sincerely, William Barwick- President, Jeffrey Tucker, Vice-President,
Jennifer  Heller- Publication Secretary

<P>We just got back from SIGGRAPH and found a message on the answering  machine

</P>
<P>&quot;We saw Dr. Bush on Tuesday. There is no real news unfortunately, the
album is  almost finished but Kate is still actually working on it. She is
recording at the  moment, she's been doing all sorts of things with the album.
As time goes on it  looks more likely that it's not going to be released this
year, I know, bad news, but  there you go. So anyway, that's it really, just
wish you Happy Katemas, whatever  you're doing...&quot;

<P>He's so sweet! The update is not at all suprising, at least, not to fans who
know  it's wise to tack on 2-4 years *past* the &quot;expected&quot; date of

</P>
<P> What I did on my summer vacation 
</P>
<P>by Ron Hill 
</P>
<P>[Transcribed by Ronald Hill] 
</P>
<P> Well, I left on Thursday Morning, July 23. My plan was to not get too much
sleep  the night before and then spend the day doing things here in San Diego
and that way  when my plane took off at 8pm, I'd be tired out and be able to go
to sleep. Well, of  course it didn't work out that way as I had the coolest,
cutest woman sit down next  to me, so I didn't get much sleep at all!! She even
knew who Kate was!! (Her, Val,  Meredith, Jessica, etc - I was swimmin in women
on this trip! :-) ) 
</P>
<P>So I landed in Philadelphia at 6am local time and went to Valley Forge
(cool!) and  then on a trip around the area. I was surprised by how much of the
city looked  really old. Then I took the train to New Brunswick where I met up
with Jessica and  stayed the night alone at Greg's. Next morning, Greg was there
and we mussed with  his computer some, then went over to the nearby computer
center where I used  FTP for the first time, unfortunately the archives weren't
available at the time.  Then it was over to Jessica's for a cool meal. 
</P>
<P>Next day it was off to DC in the morning. The first day I went on a bus trip
 around the city, and saw the national cathedral (definitely recommended!). Then
I  went off to a Jazz club where I got a little drunk! :-) The next day I went
on a  helicopter trip around DC which was really cool. Then I saw the pentagon,
the  Arlington cemetery, and the Iwa Jima (spel?) memorial. Then I went to The 
Library of Congress at around 6. I foolishly expected I would be able to
research the  magazines I needed by the time it closed at 9:30. The problem was
the magazine  functions of the library close around 6! So I did all I could and
then came back the  next morning and basically spent the day there. 
</P>
<P>It was incredibly frustrating cause they had most of the magazines I needed,
but  not the specific issues that I needed, they would have a mag up to say
1977, or would  be missing a specific issue only, or would say they had it and
then didn't. So I got  about 15 or so, which I should start transcribing soon. I
did a special order for some  so hopefully they'll find them in which case I
should have about 6 more. If anyone in  the area would like to volunteer to pick
them up (if they come) then write me at  this address. 
</P>
<P>I had wanted to see the Vietnam Memorial, but didn't finish until an hour
before  my train left, so I had a cab driver take me there and wait for me and
then take me  to the train station. 
</P>
<P>Then it was back to New Brunswick which I stayed at for the next two nights
as I  went into The City (New York). The first day I spent cruising around, and
I went to  The Dakota (where John Lennon lived and died) and Strawberry Fields
(the part of  Central Park dedicated to John). It was there that I saw this
woman playing Bob  Dylan songs. I shouted out &quot;Play Kate Bush&quot;, and
she said &quot;I'd love to, but I don't  think you can do it on piano&quot;.
Then she started fingering her guitar and said  &quot;Wuthering Heights?&quot;.
Then I went to see Les Miseribles. The next day I went on a  tour of New York
and saw all the normal stuff. 
</P>
<P>That night Greg, Jessica, and I drove up to Boston. The next day we stumbled
 around Cambridge and stayed up late making pizza. The next day was the day of 
The Party. In one room was set up CDs of more obscure artists then most people
see  in a lifetime, and in the other was the Kate Stuff. I brought my videos and
those  were played. A whole group of us left to cruise around the Cambridge
record stores.  I finally got to see some actual bootlegs of Kate, as well as
zillions of Neil Young and  Beatles boots. I was also surprised to see the
Collector's book for sale, though it was  20 bucks, which is about 6 bucks over
what you can get it mail order for. Back at the  party I played the forty
seconds of the Rocket Man video and then the Comic Strip  shows Ken (which Kate
did the music for) and GLC (which Kate appeared in). Then  the band played. 
</P>
<P>After the first song, I got freaked out 'cause someone walked up to me and
said  I had a phone call, most unusual as no-one knew I was there! :-) Of
course, it was  Chris Williams from the Chicago party. He told me the news about
his message  from Homeground (Kate's album being delayed till next year) and the
great news  that Peter from Homeground really likes my book Cloudbusting! Then
we went out  for fireworks, which was funny cause as I was lighting one, Val
took a picture which  I though was a cop arriving to arrest me! Then some of the
fireworks started to  come perilously close to hitting some of us! It's not a
party if there is not some  physical danger involved!! :-) Then we had a guy
doing some juggling (cool). After  most people left we saw the tape of the
performance of the band (great). 
</P>
<P>The next day five of us went off to find the Wilhelm Reich museum. It was a
five  hour drive out there, two hours there, and then five hours back! It was an
 interesting place. There is quite a bit more trees then the video, so it's hard
to  imagine Peter tumbling down the hill like in the video. When we turned off
the  road, we started singing &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. I asked him how many
people who went  there knew about Reich or Kate and he said that about half the
people who went  there went cause they knew about Reich and about half just
cause they happened to  be in the area and needed something to do! He said
people coming because of Kate  was a bit of a &quot;rarity&quot;. When Val asked
what Reichian people thought of  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; he said that it was a &quot;just
a curiosity&quot;. He also said that due to all the  fighting among the various
disciples of Reich, they only sold books by (not about  Reich) at the bookstore
there, and that that may be the reason they didn't have A  Book Of Dreams. 
</P>
<P>The guest list went back to 1986, and I looked through the 1986 and 1989
section to  see if I could find Kate's name, but no luck. (Looking through
Deeper  Understanding I've just found a mention in 1987 from someone who went
and said  that the tour guide then had said that he had heard Kate had been
there.) Val  looked through back issues of the Reich newsletter for mentions of
Cloudbusting,  but no luck. The tour guy said there have been a few other
Reichian references in  art, including a &quot;Reichian Physiologist&quot; in (I
think) Magnum P.I. 
</P>
<P>There were a couple of Cloudbusters on display, including the very first one
ever  built. They were basically just a couple of tubes shot pointed into the
air. The tour  guy said there are people in Northern California who are
supposedly using them and  have &quot;attained statistically relevant results&quot;.
There was also an interesting experiment  where they had two glass containers
that were identical except for the fact that the  bottom of one had &quot;Orgone
collection material&quot;. This container was consistently  hotter then the
other, which science supposedly can't explain. Reich supposedly  showed it to (I
think) Einstein and he couldn't explain it, but (supposedly) shied  away cause
Reich was too infamous at the time. 
</P>
<P>On the way home we stopped at an (I think) Ethiopian resterant, which was
fun  cause the guy seemed to have the attitude that &quot;if you don't like our
food, I'll kill  myself!&quot; He was so eager to please!! When Bob didn't like
one dish (not because he  thought it was prepared badly, just because he hadn't
had it before and didn't  happen to like it) I thought the guy was going to die!
On the way home we read  from Cloudbusting and The Garden. 
</P>
<P>The next day Val and I went around Boston on a bus tour. We had lunch at the
 place that inspired &quot;Cheers&quot;, which wasn't as friendly as on TV!
There was a really  drunk and load SportsFan there, who kept talking about
various sports stuff I knew  nothing. I kept saying things like &quot;go team&quot;
and pretending I knew one sport from  the next. Then we headed off for
Middletown, Connecticut (or Bullshit, Nowhere)  where we spent the night at a
friend of Val's and went to a couple of really cheesy  diners. The next morning
Val was kind enough to drive me to the train station. I  arrived in New York in
plenty of time to catch a bus to Newark, so I walked around  Times Square a
little, and then missed the bus I intended and then the next bus got  stuck in
traffic, so I arrive too late to catch my plane! Luckily they put in a really 
small plane to Philadelphia, where I got on the same flight and plane I was
supposed  to connect to in Kansas City! So I didn't loose any time at all!
Unfortunately the  plane was delayed and hour and a half while they worked to
replace (of all things)  the black box! So then I arrived home at 1am and slept
most of the day. 
</P>
<P>Thanks to everyone I met on my trip, especially to Gr&quot;whata guy&quot;eg
for putting  me up, Va&quot;whata gal&quot;l for showing me around, Jes&quot;whata
hair&quot;sica for not physically  hurting me.

Subject: Katemas 
</P>
<P>I had a great time at the Katemas party in Boston. The HT Bush band did a 
terrific job of covering Kate and Happy Rhodes songs, and played: &quot;Ne
T'enfuis Pas&quot;,  &quot;Playing Canasta in Cold Rooms&quot;, &quot;My Lagan
Love&quot;, &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; (the Happy  Rhodes song), and &quot;Running
Up that Hill&quot;. 
</P>
<P>It was also fun to visit Orgonon. The tour guide was pretty neutral in his 
comments about Reich until I mentioned that his ideas reminded me of medieval 
medicine (i.e., that diseases are caused by an inbalance of humours; Reich
believed  that certain (all?) diseases could be cured by an infusion of &quot;Orgonon
Energy&quot;). At  that point he said that Reich &quot;wasn't a very good
scientist, but was a good  observationalist&quot;. I also found out that this
inbalance is supposed to be the way the  Cloudbuster works; it makes rain by
drawing &quot;Orgonon Energy&quot; out of the  atmosphere. Reich also believed
that living matter could arise spontaneously out of  dead matter, and the tour
guide mentioned he &quot;had a hard time with that one&quot; (the  tour guide
was also a high school science teacher). The area around the Reich  museum is
beautiful, with several lakes nearby. A nice place to go camping! 
</P>

<P>From ryptyde!netrun!rhill@nosc.mil Mon Aug 17 06:06:13 1992 <BR> From:
rhill@netrun.cts.com (ronald hill) <BR> Subject: The 1992 San Diego Katemas
Party, Kate-related moviews, addendum 
</P>
<P>Well, the San Diego Katemas 92 party has came and went. It ended up
including  only 3 people, myself, Ray Russell, and a &quot;new&quot; woman,
Susan, who seemed  overwhelmed by all the videos and left with Cloudbusting, The
Cathy Demos, a  video, and other goodies. Ray brought his must-see two foot
model of the  Cloudbuster that he sometimes mounts to the trunk of his car! :-)

</P>
<P>Ray and I stayed up late, as I had rented three movies. The first was the
1971  British TV version of Wuthering Heights. This is the apparently the
version that  Kate walked into the end of as a child, which inspired her to read
the book, which  inspired the song. I say &quot;apparently&quot; because Kate
did mention that the version she  saw had &quot;a hand coming through a window&quot;
and I don't remember that in the film.  It started off a little slow for me, but
by the middle it really got going. I haven't read  the book (hey, I'm gonna get
around to it, okay :-) but I assume this is closer to it  then the older
version, as it had much more &quot;devious&quot; motivations and is very 
different from the original. Overall, it's a must-see. 
</P>
<P>We also watched The Cruel Sea (which was an inspiration for The Ninth Wave
),  during which Ray fell asleep, which shows how exciting it is! Actually it's
the scenes  that focus on the people that are boring, the &quot;water&quot;
scenes are sometimes quite  interesting. There's a sonar sound throughout the
film that's very simular to the  sound in The Ninth Wave. 
</P>
<P>The next day I watched Castway, for which Be Kind To My Mistakes was
written.  It's about a woman who answers an add to stay a year on an empty
island with a  man. It co-stars Amanda Donohue, who just left L.A. Law (she was
the lesbian  character). I had seen the beggining before Amanda joined LA Law
and couldn't sit  through it. It was more interesting this time, though not that
good. At the end the  male character said to the female character, &quot;Be Kind
To My Mistakes&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Oops, here are some parts I forgot from my description of my Boston Katemas 
'92 trip: 
</P>
<P>While I was transfering planes in Kansas city, I met a guy from Bulgaria. I
asked  him if he had heard of the Trio Bulgaria, of course, he had, and he
couldn't believe  that I had! 
</P>
<P>In Cambridge, Val and I saw a van that had a sign that proclaimed.... Wait
for  it!... That Stephen King murdered John Lennon! (Yes, the famous Stephen
King). It  had documentary &quot;evidence&quot; (including photo comparisions)
and on the back it said  &quot;It's no joke, folks&quot;. :-)

Katemas to All!

<P>'Twas the day before Katemas and all the world round, <BR> Our sweet
Katie's fans to great parties were bound. <BR> They carried some food and some
CD's along, <BR> they watched our Kate dancing and some sang along. <BR> But
out on the street there arose such a clatter <BR> that Love Hounds sprang up to
see what was the matter. <BR> There, with a laserdisc under his arm, <BR> was
IED grinning. Pronouncing a charm <BR> he pointed big-skyward and blew Kate a
kiss, <BR> and all the bright stars spelled out &quot;SHE REALLY IS!&quot;
<BR> We heard him exclaim as he set to depart: <BR> &quot;Happy Katemas to all
and to all a bright heart!&quot; <BR>
