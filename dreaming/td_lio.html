<BR> Subject: Backward vocals 
</P>
<P>&gt; On &quot;The Dreaming&quot; there is a two-way message that is sung at
the end of  &quot;Leave It Open&quot;. When you play it forwards it sings &quot;We
let the weirdness in&quot;. And  when you play it backwards it sings &quot;And
they said they would not let me in&quot;! 
</P>
<P>I've tried this several times, and I can't hear the word &quot;not&quot;.
All I can hear is  &quot;They said they would let me in&quot;. As to how they
did it, I'm not an expert in the  field, but I have what I think is a pretty
good guess. It's drowned out by the music  in the part where the music is still
going, but in the part at the very end, I can hear  something in the background,
and although the voice is intelligible, it still sounds  weird. This makes me
think that they've recorded the two messages separately in  normal, forward
voices, then reversed one of them, then combined the two signals  together. I'm
not familiar with the Fairlight, but I wouldn't be surprised if such  things
were not too difficult to do on it. They probably tried different relative
speeds  and offsets until they got something that produced the desired effect.
When we play  the record in one direction or the other, we're actually hearing
both messages at the  same time, one forward and the other backwards. Because we
tend to notice  intelligible speech more than unintelligible speech, we hear
mostly the forward  message. One of the scientists I work with has done some
research in the field of  speech intelligibility, so if I get a chance I'll talk
to him about it and I'll forward his  comments to this mailing list.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: Backwards vocals 
</P>
<P>[Backwards vocals:] 
</P>
<P>Yes, it has been discussed in L-Hs before, but since no-one has come up with
the  solution to the latest problem yet, an excessively boring and long-winded 
re-capitulation doesn't seem out of order, especially since most people just
scroll past  IED's longer entries anyway! 
</P>
<P>There have only been two so-called &quot;backwards tracks&quot; in Kate's
music to date,  as far as anyone knows so far. 
</P>
<P>The first appears in The Dreaming, specifically in the last minute of &quot;Leave
It  Open&quot;. The Kate Bush Club made a competition out of the passage,
offering a prize  to the first member to come up with the correct message that
Kate sings in the  fade-out of the song. Nobody came up with the correct
solution for several issues,  which is to say for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>The first problem was that the vocal track SOUNDED exactly like a 
backwards-masked track, but WASN'T one, strictly speaking. The second problem 
was that there was also an instrumental sound underneath Kate's fade-out chorus 
which WAS being played backwards. 
</P>
<P>In fact, the mystery message was more complicated than a simple 
backwards-masked track, such as the mystery tracks on the Beatles' &quot;Revolution
 #9&quot;, for example. In most (if not all) earlier cases of backwards-masking,
the artist  simply recorded a message (or played some music) normally, then
added that  recording to the mix by playing the tape backwards. The Beatles did
a lot of  backwards-masked music on Revolver, and the difficulty was in coming
up with a  piece of guitar-playing (for example) that actually fit in with the
chord-structure of  the song when it was played back backwards in synch with the
forwards tracks. 
</P>
<P>George Harrison apparently played many slightly different solos on the
Revolver  tracks, until one of them happened to sound good when played backwards
with the  songs. The task wasn't really very difficult for the Beatles, since
part of their  intention was to add a lot of surreality and confusion to the
recording, and a little  imprecision of chords and notes was seen as a plus for
the music, not a mistake. 
</P>
<P>For Kate, however, nothing that haphazard has ever been acceptable --
especially  on an album track. Therefore, for the fade-out of &quot;Leave It
Open&quot;, she first  composed the exact musical (melodic) line that she wanted
people to hear when  they simply played the record straight. Then she set that
phrase to the words, &quot;We  let the weirdness in.&quot; Next, she recorded
that melodic line, and listened to the weird  phonetic sounds that came out when
the passage was played backwards. She then  proceeded to imitate those sounds as
precisely as possible, following not only the  phonetics that the backwards
playback produced, but also the new, inverted melody  that resulted. Once she
had learned this new passage perfectly, she then performed  it as though it were
a normal chorus; synched that version up with the master tape;  and let it play
BACKWARDS with the fade-out. 
</P>
<P>The result was a message that was note for note the same as the musical
passage  she had originally intended, but with sounds altered just enough so
that it  SOUNDED like backwards gibberish, but wasn't. During the year before
someone  (a Dutch fan) finally solved the puzzle, a large number of suggestions
came in with  answers more or less similar to the line, &quot;They said they
were buried here;&quot; that line  obtained by people playing (BACKWARDS) Kate's
weirdly distorted FORWARDS  vocal of &quot;We let the weirdness in.&quot; At the
1985 Kate Bush Convention in England,  Paddy Bush gave a little demonstration of
just how Kate went about making the  track. But he didn't actually say that she
had used the same method on Hounds of  Love...

</P>
<P>Hi, Joe. 
</P>
<P>It's great to hear from someone who's actually listening, for a change! 
</P>
<P>I think you're right that it sounds like forwards words when played
backwards  -- certainly the &quot;We see you here&quot; part is straightforward
backwards recording. But  then, as you say, if it's that simple, then where is
the &quot;Don't&quot;??? I've had very long  phone discussions with a fan in
Missouri about this problem, and he thinks it's got  to be mixed up -- spliced
in the middle or something. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, I greatly appreciate your offer to send me a tape of the track.
Could you  send me your mailing address? I'll get a blank cassette and a SASE
off to you right  away if you would. Thanks very very much. Maybe it'll really
help. Maybe you could  put your &quot;W. Heights&quot; cover on it, too. 
</P>
<P>Could you please explain in more detail what you meant about your having
done  the backwards track from &quot;Leave It Open&quot; yourself and its having
&quot;sounded right&quot;?  Of course, I know these messages of hers are not a
sign of greatness in themselves.  It's just the aesthetic -- the IDEA of the
thing -- that gets me: adding mystery,  depth and secret, hidden riddles to the
music.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: palindrome 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Joe and Jon for their fascinating ideas re interpreting backwards 
tracks/lyrics to KT. This is what the essence of L-Hs is all about! 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED, I had occasion to pick up my handy-dandy four-track and try out
the &quot;We  let the weirdness in&quot; bit.. I tried it by saying &quot;We let
the weirdness in&quot; on one track,  and &quot;And they said they wouldn't let
me in&quot; on another track (backwards). It  sounded correct. Sickeningly easy
to do, too. Kate had a great idea, but let's not go  overboard on congratulating
her on it! 
</P>
<P>-- joe 
</P>
<P>This introduces a highly controversial new variable into what had formerly
been  considered a settled issue. The Kate Bush Club long ago dropped the &quot;Leave
It  Open&quot; message competition, after a fan figured out that it was simply &quot;We
let the  weirdness in&quot;, sung forwards, but with a weird cadence and
pronunciation that made  it SEEM as though it might be a backwards message.
Since then (at least two years  now) nobody has done much to explain how it is
that the message also seems to say  something when it actually IS played
backwards. 
</P>
<P>Joe has said that it must be a palindrome, but of course not in the usual
sense of  the word (i.e. where the letters spell out the same word whether read
from left to  right or from right to left). Instead, this would have to be a
phrase which actually  makes phonetic, grammatical AND thematic sense, whether
heard backwards OR  forwards. Since the chances of one coming up with such a
phrase intentionally or  even unintentionally must be astronomical, IED has
always assumed that the  similarity of the message (in its backwards form) to
phrases like &quot;They said they  were buried here&quot; (or, as Joe has it, &quot;And
they said they wouldn't let me in&quot;) was  only approximate, and was entirely
fortuitous. 
</P>
<P>But, since Joe is pretty certain that his interpretation is correct, what we
need  here are some third opinions. |&gt;oug, you must have an idea about
whether there's a  true backwards message or not in &quot;Leave it Open&quot;,
especially since it is God and the  Universe and everything to you. Can you
help? Anyone else out there care to give it  a try?

</P>
<P>After further consideration and discussion, IED has to reject Phil's (?)
theory  that there is something deliberately being said in the &quot;Leave It
Open&quot; mystery track  when played backwards. It just isn't so. The sounds
are a lot like: &quot;Nthey send they  wuht vewy heee-uhw..&quot; but they are
not precise English words. All you have to do is  imitate the phonetics
yourself, record your voice, and play it backwards, and you'll  hear &quot;We
let the weirdness in.&quot; That's all it is. The new mystery track, however, is
 definitely something much cleverer.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: security system 
</P>
<P>About your interpretation of the lines from &quot;All the Love&quot; and &quot;Leave
it Open&quot;:  Where did you read Kate's comments about having a security
system installed in  her home? IED has never seen that interview, and would like
to catch up. You're  probably right about that particular connection, but in
general IED's feeling is that  it's a mistake to look at Kate's songs as
directly autobiographical. Unless your  interpretation and examples were written
for the WSI? 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew 
</P>
<P>[I don't know if I've ever heard of Kate talking about the security system
at her  ex-flat in London, but I have read an interview that took place there
and the  interviewer talked about the security system. Also Peter Morris of
*Homeground*  told me that Kate had the security system installed because of
John Lennon's  murder. I don't know what his source was. 
</P>
<P>I have heard a radio interview with Kate that took place at the end of 1980
and  she said that she was very glad the year was over because it had been an
awful year  and that she had been very depressed about John Lennon's murder.
Seen in this  light, it isn't too hard to see that the the line, &quot;Now when
they ring, I get my  machine to let them in,&quot; definitely refers to Kate's
own security system, and that the  line, &quot;My door was never locked/ Until
one day a trigger come -- cocking,&quot; almost  certainly is an allusion to the
effect that John Lennon's murder had on Kate.  -- |&gt;oug]

<P>Date: Wed, 19 Apr 89 12:40 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: backwards speech 
</P>
<P> &gt; A while ago, when IED re-posted |&gt;oug's interview with Kate, he
said that the  backwards speech at the end of leave it open is NOT &quot;And
they said they wouldn't  let me in&quot;. Well, what is it!?!? That's what it
sounds like to me as well. 
</P>
<P>This subject is still not completely resolved, but the main point is that
the  &quot;backwards speech&quot; isn't backwards at all. The message is
forwards, and says &quot;We  let the weirdness in&quot;. Therefore your hearing
of the words as they sound when  heard backwards (&quot;And they said they
wouldn't let me in&quot;) is no better or worse  than the version that the
majority of listeners hear: &quot;They said they were buried  here.&quot; Both
versions are simply our own ascription of meaning to the arbitrary  sounds that
the phrase &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot; makes when played backwards.  (Or
are they?? No one really knows this for certain.) 
</P>
<P>Of course, this phrase is obscured still further, in two ways: first, Kate
didn't just  say &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot; and then record it
backwards. Rather, she devised a  melodic line first for the sentence (beginning
with the musical inspiration,  apparently), sang &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;
to that melody, then listened to that bit  backwards, learned the weird sounds
and new, backwards melody that she heard  when playing her original phrase
backwards, and then re -recorded the new, weird  &quot;backwards&quot; music.
Finally, she turned that version around, arriving back where she  had started,
only with all the sounds very strangely altered, and placed that version  into
the forwards mix. Also, she overdubbed the vocal line several times, and added 
some odd effects. 
</P>
<P>The other problem is that there are also some very definite sounds--not the
main  vocal, but other sounds--in the forwards mix which sound backwards. These
sounds  increase the sense of confusion about which way is backwards and which
is  forwards. 
</P>
<P>Is it possible that Kate deliberately, painstakingly devised the sentence &quot;We
let  the weirdness in&quot; because it seemed to say &quot;They said they were
buried here&quot; when  heard backwards? IED thinks that's highly unlikely, but
who knows. The only  &quot;official&quot; explanations have been the
confirmation (by Paddy, who briefly and  amusingly demonstrated the technique at
the 1985 convention) that Kate listened to  the back-wards sounds, learned their
odd sounds, and then recorded them over  again forwards; and Kate's simple
admission that the secret message is simply &quot;We  let the weirdness in&quot;,
and not &quot;They said they were buried here&quot; (and its many  related
forms). This whole business was, as has been said in Love-Hounds before,  the
focus of a very long-running Club competition, during which many suggestions 
for the &quot;They said...&quot; phrase were submitted, and clues about &quot;weirdness&quot;
sprinkled  throughout the articles by Paddy, Del and Kate.

</P>
<P>the actual explanation has been advanced many times. here it is again... 
</P>
<P>the intended text is &quot;we let the weirdness in.&quot; that's what you
hear when the  song plays normally. now, it sounds completely tweaked out
because kate listened to  that line played backwards, and then attempted to sing
the backwards sounds she  heard. of course it is totally impossible for the
human mouth to produce the exact  same sounds, so when you take this
approximation and run THAT backwards, you  get the forwards message &quot;we let
the weirdness in&quot;, only it sounds really odd. 
</P>
<P>try it yourself. listen to &quot;we let the weirdness in&quot; backwards and
sing what  you're hearing into your computer. now play that piece of audio in
reverse. you're  suddenly saying &quot;we let the weirdness in&quot; only it
doesn't sound quite right.
