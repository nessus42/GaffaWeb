<BR> Subject: &quot;Sensual World&quot; video. 
</P>
<P>MTV-Europe showed the video to &quot;Sensual World&quot; on friday 15, and
at least two  more times during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>The video is very simple compared to what we are used to from KaTe, but 
(IMHO) matches the song very well. 
</P>
<P>The main &quot;activity&quot; in the video is KaTe partly walking, partly
dancing through a  forest (while singing, of course). She is the only living
thing in the video (except for  the trees, that is). Her surroundings are
changing along the way. In the beginning its  an &quot;ordinary&quot; forest,
with normal daylight. After a while she's dancing herself into a  sunset
(sunrise?). Further along the way, the background turns into flames and her 
dance is escalating into a kind of witchdance (???). The weather-conditions in
the  forest are not very healthy and changes from summer and good weather to
snow  showers. The light is also changing along the way. 
</P>
<P>All in all a very KateBush-ish kind of video, though simple. 
</P>
<P>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH !!! No bad action to ruin the song! 
</P>
<P>For the song itself: She is whispering through it! Probably the right thing
for  THIS song, but I hope she uses her great voice more on the rest of the
album. 
</P>

</P>
<P>Hello everyone. 
</P>
<P>The video for The Sensual World has made it to Canada. Much Music, a
Canadian  video channel, started playing it on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>Not a bad video. Only got a quick once through of it. I was suprised that it
was as  short as it was. 
</P>
<P>Ok, Discription to follow if I can remember it all. The basic video is as
posted  before. 
</P>
<P>The video starts with a water shot, like looking at or through a lake. Then
it  proceeds to Kate in the forest, and proceeds as described before. 
</P>
<P>Kate is her slim self once again. She is wearing what appears to be a long
flowing  dress. It is made of dark purple velvet like material. I believe it is
an alaboration on  the dress style she wore in the Running Up The Hill video. It
has the look of a dress,  but has the separate legs (like pants). She starts the
video sporting a hat (Think it  was purple). Small Pill box affair. It is
attached by long silky (pale blue) scarves. She  takes the hat off about the
middle of the video. 
</P>
<P>Any way, that's about all I do remember of the video. Like I said, good
video. If  this is any indication what the rest of the album is like, IT WILL BE
A MEGA HIT! 
</P>
<P>That's all for now, Talk later, Danny

<BR> Subject: The Sensual Video! 
</P>
<P>The video for The Sensual World was played this afternoon on &quot;YTV Rocks&quot;,
a  half-hour video station on Canada's YTV! All I can say is it's one beautiful
video.  Has it been seen in the States yet? 
</P>
<P>In it, Kate's wearing a long dark velvet dress and a hat with a veil wrapped
 around her chin and flowing back over her hair. She's dancing down a path
through  the woods. At first, the light is warm and soft, like sunlight
filtering through the  trees overhead. Later it becomes a deep orange from the
large red sun, now setting. 
</P>
<P>Then Kate removes her hat as big flames leap up in the background, just
beyond  the trees. She dances a strange dance with the fire spreading across the
horizon  under the setting sun. Then it becomes night, dark but with stars and a
big bright  full moon. Finally, as the song winds up, it becomes light again, as
at the start of the  song. 
</P>
<P>There's a lot of fluff floating through the air at times--down? With petals 
perhaps? And in the night scene, what seems to be hail rains down on Kate at one
 point, and there's some swirling ... snow? 
</P>
<P>Wonderful.

<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; was wonderful. I was *so* impressed! I could
just see her  climbing off of her page and into the world. Kate, of course,
looked gorgeous-- I  admire a woman who can be sexy covered (as opposed to
*un*-covered). And the  elemental changes. Wow. (This one gets my vote as best
of the lot.)

Mifflin) <BR> Subject: KATE ON US MTV 11/2/89 Love And Anger 
</P>
<P>Hello to all fans of Kate! 
</P>
<P>Well here is my first posting to Love Hounds. I've been a silent reader
since '83  ( and |&gt;oug was extolling the virtues of KT in rec.music.misc).
Now so many others  also carry the torch, too! 
</P>
<P>Last night, on Post Modern MTV, the FIRST video was the new one for &quot;Love
 And Anger&quot;. I just got a tape in the VCR (barely!) in time to get it. 
</P>
<P>It starts off with a swirling of skirts and then to a close up of Kate
kneeling as if  to pray. It reminds me of a cross between RUTH (dance version),
Big Sky, Sat In  Your Lap, and Hounds Of Love videos. I have not figured out why
there are  ballerinas in this video (KT answer to Robert Palmer?! :-), but it
also has David  Gilmour and a band playing behind KT. Paddy is there, John
Giblin (I guess) on  bass, and an unknown male keyboards player. 
</P>
<P>It seems as though the audio was the same mix as the album. I will sync the
two  up tonight to verify this! I was only able to get it in mono (MTV only gets
FM stereo  and my tuner was destroyed at a party last weekend). 
</P>
<P>I will try to post more on this later. Have a nice weekend and may the
grace,  power and the glory that is KATE be with you all now and forever!

6-Nov-89 22:20:17 PST <BR> Subject: &quot;Love and Anger&quot; on MTV's Now
Hear This 11/6/89 
</P>
<P>Just caught the west coast feed of MTV's Now Hear This weekly show that 
previews new videos and records. They usually only show three complete videos 
during the show and this week's show had &quot;Love and Anger&quot; as a &quot;World
Premier  Video&quot; (but of course, it had been spotted over the weekend on MTV
already....). 
</P>
<P>As the person who saw the end of the video mentioned, at the end Kate is 
dancing around in front of the band (which also includes Paddy lip syncing to
the  background vocals and playing whatever instrument he uses on the song. 
</P>
<P>The video starts out a lot different, with Kate in the light from a
spotlight above  her doing a serious lip-sync to the song as dancing girls and
priests turn up and  dance around her. About the time of Gilmour's guitar solo,
Kate starts moving  around a lot more and it turns into a performance video with
a backing band. I'm  sure others will find all sorts of significant things in it
to speculate on. A couple of  other notes on it. 
</P>
<P>The audio track is the same as the LP/CD track as far as I could tell. I did
sync  up my CD to check that out and so I could hear the &quot;Yes&quot; at the
end, which was (as  is usual MTV fashion) cut off to fade to the VJ. Don't know
if the laugh is part of  the video or not. The comments leading in to the video
talked about Dave Gilmour  discovering Kate &quot;at the tender age of 16&quot;
and that he helped to produce her demos  that got her a recording contract No
mention of who the director was or anything  like that.

GMT <BR> Subject: Love &amp; Anger video 
</P>
<P>As I sit, awaiting the arrival of MY KT posters (one for me, one for a
friend, one  for another..), I checked MTV and heard: 
</P>
<P>(Hmm, let me check my stereo/dolby VHS copy...) 
</P>
<P>&quot;But now check out the new one from Kate Bush, who was discovered at
the  tender age of sixteen by Pink Floyd's gitarist David Gilmore who orginized
and  financed her demo tapes that led to her first record deal... She has
produced six  criticly acclaimed albums, of which the latest is &quot;The
Sensual World&quot; was released  late last month, the first video &quot;Love &amp;
Anger&quot; showcases Kate's dramatic  performance style, which of course
incorporates dance, mime, and magic. And on  guitar, her old friend David
Gilmore. Here's Kate Bush with Love and Anger...&quot;  Adam Curry &quot;Now
Hear This!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Drum beats join reflected light and Kate's words bring her into view
kneeling in  a pool of white light. She's dressed in a snug black, sleeveless
gown and our  viewpoint pivots around her from her left, behind her and then
facing her. As she  faces us, and continues rotating, a sparkling rain showers
the pool of light as she  tosses her hair and head to the words &quot;Tell you
what I'm feel'n&quot; As she/we rotate  around to face her - she twists and
begins to stand. The scene dissolves to gold,  bejewled chains being poured from
her hand and the closeups of a staff and sceptar  and we then see that she is
holding. Seven we are treated by the view of a proud  kate, her hair tossed by
the emotion of her words. In the closeups we she her  earings, long black
combinations of beads - that might be more. The women receed  into the darkness
and Kate is left to stand alone in the pool until men wearing tall  red hats
spirial in and surround Kate. 
</P>
<P>After some wonderful closeups of Kate - God she looks good - she is caried
onto  stage by band members and we have the manditory MTV closeups of preforming
 band members and the video closes with Kate throwing sparkles at us with &quot;Yeah!&quot;

</P>
<P>(I vote for the Yeah! as my favorite sound on &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
{I think I'll  make it my system beep!} with her first round of humming as my
second choice.) 
</P>
<P>And I couldn't say it better then &quot;Yeah! That was Kate Bush...&quot;

(Jenn Turney) <BR> Subject: 'Love and Anger' video 
</P>
<P>I was one of those lucky enough to catch the new video on Empty-V last 
Thursday night (well, actually Friday morning by then). Victor O'Rear has given
an  initial description which is a more or less accurate sketch. I'd point out,
however,  that 'staff' and 'sceptar' (sic, should be 'scepter' or 'sceptre')
refer to the same  object. The second object is I believe correctly referred to
as an 'orb' -- a spherical  object surmounted by a cross. KaTe stands still for
most of the time she is holding  these objects, while dancers appear in the
background. Towards the end, she's  relieved of them and joins the band. 
</P>
<P>This is the first of KaTe's videos I've seen and strikes me as rather bland
in  relation to my expectations from descriptions of previous vids. I've already
received  condolences from IED, who thinks the format may have been
dictated/restricted by  CBS (hope I am not misinterpreting him). I'm looking
forward to someday seeing  the rest of the bunch.

<P>Date: Tue, 07 Nov 89 15:51 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: the new video 
</P>
<P>So by now cable-ized Love-Hounds will already be familiar with this 
extraordinary new Kate Bush video. For those who are less elaborately wired up, 
here's a brief description. 
</P>
<P>It begins (the first set of verses) with Kate, on her knees with hands in
lap,  dressed in black culottes and a sleeveless black top, hair loose but set
in great,  dramatic waves, lip-synching while remaining very still. She is lit
by a small spotlight  in an otherwise blank dark studio space, and the camera
revolves slowly around her  from above, making two whole circuits around her.
Throughout this part of the  video and much of the rest of it, a thin,
intermittent shower of gold glitter (a la  Danae and Zeus?) flows over her body
from the darkness above. She then lets a  handful of gold slip from her hand,
and the camera shows it to be filled with jewels  and precious necklaces, etc. 
</P>
<P>Then there are some close-ups of a monarch's sceptre and orb (symbols of 
regal--and, sometimes, imperial--office). Kate then stands up, and the
camera-angle  opens out to show her standing still, orb and sceptre held to her
chest, in front of a  troupe of classically costumed ballerinas, who are
performing a very severe, basic  routine on toe. Then, with the beginning of the
second refrain, the ballerinas split  up, and before tiptoeing offstage, take
Kate's orb and sceptre from her--which act  suddenly shakes her to action
herself. From offstage left, meanwhile, a second  troupe of dancers--this time
traditionally garbed Sufic &quot;whirling&quot; Dervishes--pass by  her. (The
video actually began with an out-of-focus close-up of the Dervishes'  robes
whirling in unison.) 
</P>
<P>Next, amid further showers of gold rain, Kate dances backwards, while facing
the  camera, in a choreographic move much like the backwards dance in The
Sensual  World. And as the song moves into the instrumental/choral section, the
blackness  behind Kate falls away to reveal her band, in everyday dress, playing
together. David  Gilmour is prominent, behind him the bass-player (IED has still
not decided whether  this is Del, moustache and sideburns shaven off, or the
bass-player on the original  track, John Giblin, but he may have an answer for
you soon on this point), and also  included are Paddy Bush (wearing a loose
shortsleeve shirt and porkpie hat), who  plays the extremely arcane and bizarre
extinct (?) instrument known as the valiha;  Stuart Elliott on drums; an
unidentified keyboard player (Kate played all keyboards  on the new album); and
Kate's old dance partners Gary Hurst and Stewart  Avon-Arnold (who, after
carrying Kate in on her back to where the band are  playing, crouch down at
either side). 
</P>
<P>This part of the video is very elaborately edited, with brief shots of each
player's  face intercut with shots of the ballerinas' and Dervishes' dancing
feet and twirling  coattails. As the video nears its end brief and vague shots
of water are seen. Finally,  with the end of the film, Kate hums the last notes,
turns to the camera and flings a  handful of the gold dust into the camera with
the challenge, &quot;Yeah!&quot; 
</P>
<P> All in all, this video, while clearly designed to encourage MTV and other 
American stations to actually air it, is nevertheless a typically symbol-laden
and  exquisitely detailed Kate Bush film. (Its cinematic tenor is stressed by
Kate again  through the use of the broader aspect ratio she used for The Sensual
World .) The  color and lighting are stunning, and Kate herself looks to be in
tiptop shape--older,  certainly, than in her earliest video performances, but
every bit as lean around the  middle! Toward the end, when Kate &quot;rocks out&quot;
in a freeform dance, it comes as the  surprise it always was to realize that
this seemingly innocent, life-loving gamine is  indeed the creator of the
greatest music (and videos) in modern history--it is a  shock once more to be
reminded of the faKT that she is God InKarnaTe.

<P>After scanning through 10 minutes of MTV crud, I finally had enough and 
decided to watch my copy of Love and Anger for the 43rd time. After having 
watched it a few times now, I am definitely &quot;informed&quot; enough to say: &quot;My
God, why  isn't this video No. 1 yet??&quot; 
</P>
<P>Maybe now I'll pull out my other tape of TSW and once again admire the sheer
 genius, ingenuity, and utter perfeKTion of both the song and the video. Maybe
after  that, I'll once again play the fantastic and incomparable Lionheart CD.
Mmh yes, I  agree with people who know what the hell they're talking about: Kate
Bush writes  the best music and makes the best videos in the history of
civilisation.

</P>
<P>&gt; I haven't seen this mentioned yet. Just who is everybody in the band in
the  &quot;Love and Anger&quot; video. 
</P>
<P> IED has identified them already in Love-Hounds, but for the sake of
latecomers  and slackers he will repeat the information. Aside from Gilmour on
electric guitar,  the men in the Love and Anger video are: 
</P>
<P>John Giblin on bass, 
</P>
<P>Stuart Elliott on drums, 
</P>
<P>Paddy Bush on valiha (the odd rectangular instrument, which originates from 
Madagascar), 
</P>
<P>an unidentified (by IED) keyboardist (all keyboards on the track were
originally  played by Kate, and this man is not Kevin McAlea, Kate's usual
keyboard stand-in), 
</P>
<P>and Stewart Avon-Arnold 
</P>
<P>and Gary Hurst as Kate-carriers (they spend the rest of the video crouching
on  the ground on either side of Kate). 
</P>
<P>Stewart and Gary, incidentally, were Kate's dance partners until 1983. They
did  not participate in any of her Hounds of Love TV or film performances, so
their  reappearance, along with Gilmour's and the Dervishes', makes for a kind
of  oldtimers' reunion.

decided that the bass player cannot be Del with a shaven face. He just looks too
 different. It must be John Giblin, about whom Kate has had special words of
praise  recently. Giblin, incidentally, used to be the bass player in the
now-long-defunct  British group Metro; and he played the beautiful bass part on
Kate's Breathing.

(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: Love And Anger 
</P>
<P>This should stir'em up some. Here is our interpretation of the Video for &quot;Love
 And Anger&quot;. Just the video. 
</P>
<P>The parts in {}'s are from Chris. The Parts in []'s are from Vickie. 
</P>
<P>Video starts with a: 
</P>
<P>BLURRY SHOT 
</P>
<P>{Not much meaning here. Just a blurry shot of the skirts of the Sufis.} 
</P>
<P>Next Kate is: 
</P>
<P>IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
<P>{This is it. The record that's going to &quot;break her&quot; in America.
All eyes are upon  her.} 
</P>
<P>In her hands are: 
</P>
<P>JEWELRY 
</P>
<P>{Could it be a rosary? She is on her knees, is she praying? For what?} 
</P>
<P>She is: 
</P>
<P>SHOWERED WITH GOLD 
</P>
<P>{As she will be, metaphoricaly, if she succeeds in America, the last holdout
in the  &quot;civilized&quot; world. We feel this video is the direct result of
a conversation with CBS  record executives.} 
</P>
<P>She drops her: 
</P>
<P>JEWELERY 
</P>
<P>[Possibly &quot;pearls before swine&quot;?] 
</P>
<P>She spins with her: 
</P>
<P>HEAD DOWN, ARMS OUTSTRETCHED 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Here I am, do what you will&quot;] 
</P>
<P>She is handed the: 
</P>
<P>CROWN JEWELS 
</P>
<P>{Not all the crown jewels, just the Orb and Septre, but definitely the
British  Crown Jewels, symbolic of her Britishness.} 
</P>
<P>In come the: 
</P>
<P>BALLET DANCERS 
</P>
<P>{The Ballet Dancers may represent what CBS thinks of her recent videos,
serious  and hoity-toity. They may have told her to &quot;loosen up&quot; and
stop taking herself so  seriously.} 
</P>
<P>And she: 
</P>
<P>STANDS THERE 
</P>
<P>{As everyone knows, in American rock videos, she singer just stands there
while  dancers rush around, trying desperatly to create the illusion that the
singer is  dancing, as in videos by Kim Karnes, Rod Stewart, Elton John and
others. God forbid  that the singer actually try to dance, as in Sting's &quot;We'll
Be Together&quot;. Kate, as we  all know, can dance very well, but she tried
that with &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and  that video was bumped in favor
of a TV show in which she was safely behind a  podium.} 
</P>
<P>Then the ballet dancers: 
</P>
<P>FADE AWAY 
</P>
<P>Then Sufi Dancers or: 
</P>
<P>WHIRLING DEVERISHS 
</P>
<P>{Don't you just love them. I do.} [ditto] 
</P>
<P>The ballet dancers come back and: 
</P>
<P>TAKE THE CROWN JEWELS 
</P>
<P>{Or her Britishness, as CBS may be trying to do.} 
</P>
<P>Causing Kate to: 
</P>
<P>VIBRATE VIOLENTLY 
</P>
<P>[Free &amp; easy, loose, &quot;Americanized&quot;] 
</P>
<P>And start: 
</P>
<P>GOING BACKWARDS 
</P>
<P>{Being told to pander to the American market would no doubt be a [huge] step
 backwards for Kate at this point in her career.} 
</P>
<P>The camera pans left to a: 
</P>
<P>ARCH-TYPICAL &quot;AMERICAN ROCK VIDEO&quot; 
</P>
<P>{Dave Guilmor with a wind machine in his face. This video is exclusivly for
the  American market. Peter Fitzgerald-Morris tells us it hasn't been shown in
England.  Near as we can tell CBS picked this song as the first single and asked
her for &quot;a  video for the American market&quot; and she must have thought &quot;Hmm..
a video for  America? Well I guess we'll just have to make an American video.&quot;
So she made as  American a video as she could.} 
</P>
<P>Our heroine gets: 
</P>
<P>CARRIED IN FEET FIRST 
</P>
<P>{As she well would have to be. This type of video is known the well-known,
and  much dreaded, &quot;Band-in-a-Box&quot;} 
</P>
<P>And starts to: 
</P>
<P>GYRATE WILDLY 
</P>
<P>{Near as I can tell this is something between The Pony and The Frug. I think
 Joey Heatherton invented this one on Hullaballoo.} [no one has commented on the
 &quot;hullaballoo&quot; dance moves she made in in the Dreaming video-same
influences at  work] 
</P>
<P>Surrounded by: 
</P>
<P>CLICHED SHOTS OF BAND MEMBERS 
</P>
<P>{Possible award winner for Most-Cliched Visuals on the MTV Music Video 
Awards (a hotly contested catagory). The worst lighting I've seen in years. Par
lamps  on a straight truss on a chase!! This *cannot* be anything other than a
JOKE, the  lighting equivilent of a guitarist running his/her hand up and down
the neck of  his/her gee-tar (Kate called this action &quot;obviously wanking
away up there&quot;)(see:  Heart or any Heavy Metal). Take it from me, the
lighting is dumber than a box of  rocks. On purpose. Kate's videos are always
well and subtly lit.} 
</P>
<P>Until she: 
</P>
<P>THROWS THE GOLD GLITTER AT THE CAMERA 
</P>
<P>{With a manical grin on her face. Watch it in slow motion.} 
</P>
<P>Thus ends Kate's funniest video. I've broken it down for ease of commenting
by  other Love-Hounds. We've run this past Doctor of Katebusholigy Peter David 
Fitzgerald-Morris of &quot;Homeground&quot; and he found it amusing and very
likely given  Kate's sense of humor. Remember this is Kate we are talking about,
Our Lady of  the Oblique Reference, the one who puts lyrics in her songs that
even her most  ardent fans cannot decipher, the one who hides secret symbols on
her records, the  one who once answered a simple question, &quot;what kind of
makeup do you use?&quot;, with,  &quot;oh, I don't use makeup anymore, I use
latex!&quot;. Comments welcome. 
</P>
<P>  Love, 
</P>
<P> Chris'n'Vickie 
</P>
<P> [or Vickie'n'Chris] 
</P>
<P>[notice how the title can be turned into Love an' Danger? No special
significance,  I just think it's neat]

<P>Wow! I just got my copy last night! &quot;Love and Anger&quot; was pretty
dippy -almost  enough so to make me believe Chris'N'Vickie in their analysis. I,
however, am  tempted to believe it was designed specifically to appeal to the
American market,  without the parody overtones. My favourite section of it was
when she looked at her  feet and spun around sprinkling glitter right before the
rock-out, and the close-ups  of the ballet dancers' feet in the puddle and gold
glitter, and the dervishes, which  were totally cool.

<P>Is this true? WHY would they do that? Next to the simple shots of (tiny)
Kate  sitting on her heels, that brief moment was one of the best in the video
(IMFO, of  course). Why cut out *anything* when going from the broadcast version

<P>Hello again... 
</P>
<P>I just bought the TSW videos, and after watching the tape eight times in 
succession on a borrowed VCR (which has now, unfortunately, been returned), I'm 
convinced that KT is one of the best video artists going. Does she have a thing
for  glitter, or what? Anyway, I have one question: at the end of &quot;Love and
Anger&quot;, about  15 seconds before the end of the song, she says something. I
don't think she says  anything on the album version, but she's definitely moving
her lips in the video. I'm  a good lip-reader, but this one's got me. 
</P>
<P>Anybody out there been able to figure out what she's saying?

times  I've seen the video, to no avail. However, if I'm not mistaken, it does
indeed occur  on the album as well. The point we're talking about is between the

<P>From: Paul.Gillingwater@actrix.gen.nz (Paul Gillingwater) <BR> Date: Thu,
22 Aug 1991 12:03:02 -0700 <BR> Subject: Maqabbaleh (Dervish turning) 
</P>
<P>I was fortunate enough to be invited to a Maqabbaleh ceremony last week, as
one  of the audience. For those who have not seen this before, (and I guess
that's most of  us!) this is a traditional Sufi/Dervish mystical dance which
incorporates a great deal  of spinning around. 
</P>
<P>For those who are interested in Kate Bush, you will find that her video &quot;The
 Sensual World&quot; includes one track that features both ballet and Dervish &quot;turning&quot;.
 (&quot;Love and Anger&quot;?) 
</P>
<P>As was explained to us, the &quot;turners&quot; start off wearing black
robes, which  symbolise the darkness of the grave. They wear a tall hat, similar
to a fez but around  18 inches high, of a brown colour. This is worn slightly
tilted to the right. The hat is  said to symbolise a grave stone. Under their
black robes, they wear white garments,  which are symbolic of a funeral shroud
or winding clothes, including a type of  pleated skirt that is designed to
emphasise the circularity of their turning. As they  spin, the skirt lifts up,
revealing white trousers underneath and small dark shoes.  They remove their
black robes when the dancing starts, and replace them again  when finished,
implying emergence from and return to the grave. 
</P>
<P>The dance is very formal, involving procession and much bowing, especially
to the  &quot;sheik&quot;, who seems to act as a still focus for the turning.
Another &quot;skeik&quot; acts as 2IC,  walking around within the circle created
by the dancers. The arms begin folded up  around the shoulders while passive; as
they start to spin, the arms go out, with the  left hand pointing downwards, and
the right palm up, with thumb sticking out. The  head is turned to point to the
thumb, on which they seem to focus whilst turning. 
</P>
<P>We were told in a short talk beforehand that the Dervish Maqabbaleh
tradition  was started by disciples of Rumi, the 13th century poet and mystic
(1207-1273), who  noted that when in states of divine ecstasy, he would
spontaneously begin to turn.  The dance seems to be in three distinct stages.
There are also references to a type of  spiritual journey, which starts as the
divine essence manifests through the kingdoms  of mineral, vegetable, animal and
finally human, then journeys back to the source in  a mystical progression. The
strong references to death are emphasised by the music  --- a heavy drum beat
reminds us that we are alive right now, and should dance  with joy while we
live! A Turkish traditional flute, the &quot;neh&quot;, winds through with a 
soaring melody. 
</P>
<P>Here is an example of a poem by Rumi. It is taken from an *excellent* book 
called &quot;The Enlightened Heart, An Anthology of Sacred Poetry&quot;, edited
by Stephen  Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>Morning: a polished knifeblade, <BR> the smell of white camphor burning. 
</P>
<P>The sky tears his blue Sufi robe <BR> deliberately in half. 
</P>
<P>Daylight Rumi drags his dark opposite <BR> out of sight. A happy Turk comes
in. 
</P>
<P>A grieving Hindu leaves. 
</P>
<P>The King of the Ethiopians goes. 
</P>
<P>Caesar arrives. 
</P>
<P>No one knows what changes, <BR> changes. 
</P>
<P>One half of the planet is grass.<BR>  The other half grazing. 
</P>
<P>A pearl goes up for auction. No one has enough, <BR> so the pearl buys
itself. 
</P>
<P>We stand beside Noah and David and Rabia<BR>  and Jesus and Mahummed. 
</P>
<P>Quietness again lifts and planes out, <BR> the blood in our heads gliding
in the sky of the brain.

<P>I believe the UK and US tapes are the same; the &quot;fit&quot; comes
immediately after  the dancers grab the orb and sceptre, lasting only a second
or two -- it looks like the  edit is filled in by going &quot;slow-mo&quot; at
this point (if you watch carefully you'll see her  start to wring her hands and
bend forward slowly). My question is still -- why?

<P>The fit occurs right at the point where the dancers take the orb and sceptre
out  of her hands: the minute they're away from her person her entire body
undergoes  this tremor which begins at her fingertips, travels through her arms
to her torso and  then down her body to her toes. (You can see the first instant
of this in the edited  version.) It's really quite spectacular.

<P>The whole thing happens so fast that I think all they had to do was edit in

</P>
<P>Some questions: 
</P>
<P>- Is this the right position in the video? 
</P>
<P>- Has someone recorded an emty-vee USA broadcast of the video? 
</P>
<P>- You, who has recorded it, do you have a VCR with good single stepping 
capabilities? 
</P>
<P>- You, who has answered the last questions with 'yes', can you check the way
the  MTV-USA video is different and tell us your results? 
</P>
<P>- All those 'no changes' above: These would qualify as 'slow-mo', but they
are not  enough to bring in a significant amount of additional frames. Ideas? 
</P>
<P>- While we are discussing single video frames: As we all (should) know, NTSC
uses  30 frames per second, while PAL (and SECAM) only uses 25 frames. While 
watching the single frames of the videos, I could not see any mixture between 
two frames to adjust frequency. I often can see that on other video recordings 
from TV. Can anyone of you NTSC users verify if the single frames in the video 
are clear cut from one another or if they fade into one other?

</P>
<P>This is coming a bit late (we had Uli as a house guest) but I had to correct
a  mistaken impression. Love and Anger is not a slapdash effort, nor did I
intend to  imply that it was. It is a carefully crafted piece of humor.
Rubberband Girl (version  2), on the other hand, *was* a slapdash market piece
made by a an obviously  somewhat annoyed Kate. 
</P>
<P>To avoid any further misunderstanding, here's our original analysis of of
the Love  and Anger video. Apologies to those who may have seen this more than
once.

</P>
<P>Fiona replies: 
</P>
<P>&gt;Re my remarks on the Love and Anger video: I did not say the video did
not  have a storyline. I said that I did not think the images in the video were
put together  with the intent of sending a message to record company executives.

</P>
<P>  I didn't say that it was intended to send a message to the record company 
executives either. I feel that it is about the situation of being told to make a
video for  a song that was not her choice for a single. I wouldn't think that
she would expect  them to &quot;get it.&quot; Haven't you ever made a joke about
someone you disliked (say, the  school bully) with the specific intention that
the object of the joke *not* get it? 
</P>
<P>&gt;I seem to recall Kate saying in an interview that she herself was not
sure what  the song was about. Thus, I would be quite willing to accept that the
video might not  have a storyline, if the creator is not sure that the song
does. However, if I were to  try to explain the video, I would say that the
first part with the dancers, the orb and  sceptre, glitter, etc. are somehow
related to working through or dealing with the  problem the song seems to be
talking about. The band scene may represent the state  where the problem has
been resolved and a celebration of the new, improved person  results. But, of
course, that is my own interpretation. 
</P>
<P>  Then what is the crux of the video? In the original version (not seen on
later  edits) the line of ballet dancers grab the orb and septre from Kate and
she spazzes  out. What was that changing? What are you saying the message of the
video is?  &quot;Don't worry, be happy?&quot; Please, Kate's world view, as far
as we can tell from her  songs, is *much* more complex than that. 
</P>
<P>&gt; As to the significance of the orb and sceptre, I would say they might
represent  the individual's inner strength and self-esteem (a theme that has
certainly occurred  in Ms. B.'s other work, and a theme which would certainly
relate to what seems to  be going on in the song). However, my more overwhelming
inclination is to say that  they look very striking against a dark background. 
</P>
<P>  As do her skin, hair and dress. But they are symbols of a national level,
roughly  equivilent to an American artist wrapping herself in a flag holding a
bald eagle. Far  too loaded, and specifically representative of the monarchy to
simply be intended to  be symbols of personal empowerment. Agreed, they could
well be intended to carry  that message, but I still have some trouble seeing
your view covering the entire  video in a consistant way. 
</P>
<P>&gt;Finally: another video where there is such a dramatic switch between the
first  and second parts? easy. The Big Sky. 
</P>
<P>  But the first part deals with looking at the sky, star-gazing, falconing,
sailing and  the second part could be considered a celebration of those who
voyage in the sky,  astronauts, pilots, balloonists and the simple joy of
flight.

storyline... 
</P>
<P>Hello all: 
</P>
<P>I've been lurking on the list, and posting very occasionally, for a couple
of years  now. My first introduction to Kate's music was actually my stumbling
across the  &quot;L&amp;A&quot; video while channel-surfing on MTV one night
during the incredibly brief  period it was in rotation. I was blown away by the
video, the tune, and the sheer  density of the symbolic language. Became a Kate
fan the same night. 
</P>
<P>I actually wound up writing a semiotic/analysis paper for a musicology
seminar  on the &quot;L&amp;A&quot; video, in which I tried to identify and
articulate all the different  symbolic vocabularies which were being referenced,
and then tried to get at the  &quot;program&quot; or storyline they were used in
service of. 
</P>
<P>I've submitted the paper (three years later) to a performance studies
conference  in NYC in March '95. I'd welcome feedback from those on the list who
are far  greater authorities than I; and/or if anyone is interested in one
person's response to  and analysis of what &quot;L&amp;A&quot; might be &quot;about,&quot;
I'd be happy to email copies of the  text, at such time as it's in more
finalized form. 
</P>
<P>Thanks to all for providing a positive and informative forum; I continueto
learn  things and get new insights from following discussions. 
</P>
<P>In solidarity :-),

<BR> Subject: This Woman's Video 
</P>
<P>The video for This Woman's Work was on MTV this morning. 
</P>
<P>The video opens with Kate playing piano and singing. The rest of the room is
 dark, you can see only Kate and the piano. 
</P>
<P>The camera shows a room - a hospital waiting room - chairs, two windows, 
coffee vending machine, a man (now I know I've seen him before, who is he?) 
sitting down, holding his head in his hands, then pacing around, nervous,
waiting.  It's raining outside. 
</P>
<P>Kate appears - as a ghost - a rain of gold, the camera circles and we are in
a  forest - with Kate and the man - there is a red telephone booth on the
background,  lit inside. It is dark. 
</P>
<P>The camera moves again - we are back in the hospital, a nurse comes in -
it's  Kate - no, blink your eyes and it is someone else - she tells the man
something. Bad  news. 
</P>
<P>It has stopped raining - the camera moves again - a dinner table, Kate
sitting,  laughing - she throws her head back - and back - and she falls
backwards - the  man catches her, carries her to a car - drives frantically in a
rain of gold (she had a  lot of that stuff left over from Love and Anger, huh?)
- into the hospital. Kate is  rushed away. 
</P>
<P>We are back in the waiting room - a nurse comes in, smiling -tells the man 
something. Kate is okay.

(Larry DeLuca @ The Sensual World) <BR> Subject: This Woman's Work 
</P>
<P>&quot;This Woman's Work&quot; was *amazing*. Very nicely done. I just wish
she hadn't  bothered to frame it with the piano bit. I mean, I think we could
all get the fact that  she was singing from his point of view without it, and
while it was an interesting  way to start out the video, and I liked the end
bit, I felt like it diminished the raw  emotional power of it all (I thought she
should have faded out much earlier on Mr. &quot;I  can't remember my line&quot;
- he looked so *odd* just jawing after the nurse came to  talk to him).
Actually, I really didn't like his acting - especially close-up. Though,  with
his campy, overdone style he would have made the *PERFECT* Heathcliff to  play
opposite her 1978 Cathy in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (can you just imagine
the two  of them, making utterly grotesque gestures and horrific facial
expressions, clawing  through the fog at each other in a surreal hide-and-seek
with cartwheels?). 
</P>
<P>All-in-All, I still think &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is her best video, or &quot;Running
Up That  Hill&quot;. But, MMMMMMH, yes! &quot;The Sensual World&quot; will
titillate me for years to  come.

</P>
<P>&quot;This Woman's Work&quot; made me cry. It was a very moving piece of
film. Having  been in a similar situation to that of the couple in the video
last fall, my boyfriend  and I both cried. A video has *never* made me cry-- me,
who sobs every time  Romeo, Juliet, Mozart, and Cathy Earnshaw die. The scene
that depicts the  restaurant and the subsequent drive to the hospital is
intense, especially the way it  runs horizontally from scene to scene. 
</P>
<P>While still bedazzled, I think I'll submit my contribution to the &quot;Kate
Bush as  Icon&quot; discussion. I am most impressed with Kate Bush's music. I
think she's a very  imaginative and talented woman. Completely unrelated to this
is the fact that I think  she's absolutely gorgeous. I have posters of her-- in
fact, one is actually accorded the  role of icon on the North wall of my house.
I think appreciating Catherine Bush as a  beautiful woman does little to enhance
and nothing to detract from appreciating the  musical works of Kate Bush.

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review of the British videocassette in NME 
</P>
<P>The December 1 issue of New Musical Express (with Julee Cruise on the cover)
 has a review of the British videocassette: 
</P>
<P> Hello trees, hello sky! At only 36 minutes, this video offers an interview
with  Kate [the entire VH-1 special], a fairy skip through her work to date, and
three  full-length video clips from last year's 'The Sensual World'. 
</P>
<P>The interview is actually quite interesting; she's not just a squeaky-voiced
airhead  with a lot of funny costumes and a load of old pantheist wank. Despite
claiming that  her songs have &quot;their own little personalities&quot;, Kate
reveals herself to be a dedicated  and unpretentious artist, and provides some
interesting insights into her sensual  work. 
</P>
<P>The clips themselves -- sometimes startling, sometimes too precious -- are
mostly  as we've come to expect. Kate contorts herself in either agony or
ecstacy amid  autumn leaves, while sparkly bits fall from the sky and a troupe
of dancers sway to  the music. All very nice, of course. 
</P>
<P>The most notable clip of the three is 'This Woman's Work' which, while 
steering perilously close to Jim Steinman's bloated territory, is fluid and
visually  striking.

GMT-0:00 <BR> Subject: Review of The Sensual World Video 
</P>
<P>The February issue of Q Magazine has a review of The Sensual World video. 
</P>
<P>Woman's Realm 
</P>
<P>Welcome to the sensual, nay sexual, world of Kate Bush: where oestrogen
meets  testosterone. 
</P>
<P>Endowed with a come-hither title if ever there was one, this slim but
perfectly  formed video brings up to date the Kate Bush
story-in-moving-pictures. It consists  of a fireside chat with an unseen
interviewer about 1989's The Sensual World album  and the three self-directed
videos that accompany the extracted singles, Love and  Anger, This Woman's Work
and the title track, followed by the clips shown in their  entirety. Yours for
#9.99. 
</P>
<P>For all her charm and sincerity, Kate is one of those artists who should
perhaps  leave her work to speak for itself. &quot;I've explored female energies
in myself as a  writer/producer,&quot; she earnestly avows. &quot;Before, I'd
really just done as I'd seen guys  do. In hindsight, a lot of what I was doing
was male-influenced.&quot; An interesting  thought, but it's unsubstantiated by
the evidence of her very first video, 1977's  Wuthering Heights, compared to the
recent Sensual World (co-directed by The  Comic Strip's Peter Richardson). 
</P>
<P>In the first, the 19-year-old Kate in a virgin-white dress, balletically
swirls  through a dry-ice mist. In the second, she wafts through an enchantered
forest in  full medieval fig. The former, we must believe, is esentially
chock-full of  testosterone while the latetr runs on oestrogen, but one defies
even the most  sharp-eyed budgie-sexer to tell the diference. The theme of Love
and Anger lends  itself more readily to distinguishing between the X and Y
chromosomes, and Kate  wittily spends the first half of the clip in familiar, if
you will, female swoon, only to  be borne halfway through by her ballet-dancing
handmaidens to a rough, tough  male world of rugged black amplification through
which a burly David Gilmour  leads other bestubbled rockers in giving it some
welly. 
</P>
<P>A self-confessed apolitical animal (&quot;I think I'm an emotionally-based
person&quot;),  Kate derives most inspiration from conversations, books,
painting and films and in  particular she extols Alfred Hitchcock - &quot;a
tremendous influence when I'm making  a video, the ultimate refereence point.&quot;
With that in mind, one looks afresh at her  clip for This Woman's Work.
Elegantly and economically, she dramatises a woman's  collapse and her other
half's anguish with a dream-like fluidity that indeed denotes  that she's
studied such classics by the master as Spellbound, Notorious and Vertigo  with
more than a little attentiveness. At the same time (and she is seldom given 
credit for her sense of humour), she casts in what you might call the Jimmy
Stewart  or Gregory Peck role no less than Tim McInnerny of Blackadder fame -
who is, of  course, referred to throughout the song as &quot;darling&quot;.
Hitch might have had a chuckle  himself at that. 
</P>

<P>The video gets 4 stars (out of a maximum of 5).
