<P>Here is [an excerpt from] the interview from the new Kate Bush Club 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>Q. Have you been doing other projects besides the album? 
</P>
<P>A. I've been mainly concentrating on the album and catching up on my life a
bit but  I did write a song for a film by an American Director.. John Hughes.
The piece  from the film is extremely moving an I really enjoyed writing to it..
Let's hope  when the film is released (hopefully some time in '88) that you get
to see it.. the  director has a very distinctive style (he directed &quot;Breakfast
Club&quot; ..which I really  like) and I think this, his lates film &quot;She's
Having A Baby&quot; is well worth a watch.

<P>I saw a free sneak preview of the movie without knowing that a Kate Bush
song  was part of the soundtrack. When I heard the song, I thought to myself,
this is one  GOOD song but I couldn't believe it was Kate until it was confirmed
in the credits.  A very beautiful, moving song (this after one listening!)

<P> [Your humble pseudo-moderator also saw a sneak preview of *She's Having a 
Baby*. The movie is pretty good -- though nothing extraordinary, except for
Kate's  song, which is a simple and powerful piano and voice number. When I went
to see  the movie, I was expecting to hear 10 seconds of Kate's new song, and
then have it  faded down under lots of noise, but I was very pleasantly
surprised when the entire  song was played without any dialog or noise mixed in.
The song occurs during an  otherwise silent flashback sequence. -- |&gt;oug ]

<P>Mild &quot;She's Having a Baby&quot; spoiler:

<P>Well, I finally got to see &quot;She's Having a Baby&quot;. I found the plot
entirely  unoriginal. How many times has the &quot;young-boy-finding-himself-married
 -and-looking-forward-to-leading-a-normal-life-in-suburbia&quot; plot been
churned out  by the movie industry extolling the virtues of man-at-work and
wifey-at-home  having the babies. In a typical scene, wifey is having
contractions and yells upstairs  to hubby that it's time to go the hospital, he
runs around frantically packing her  bags, runs out to the car and takes off to
the hospital without her. Come on John,  you can do better than that! 
</P>
<P>The one redeeming quality of the entire debacle was Kate's song, of course. 
Bravo Kate! If IED is right, and Kate only spends nominal time writing movie
songs,  then this song is an example of what a great artist can do with minimal
effort. Just  think what must be upcoming on KBVI! Kate is in superb vocal form
with this. The  some of the lyrics are reminiscent of &quot;All the Love&quot;.
The stupid theater broke the  trailer on the film and I was unable to get the
title of the song, but happily IED  solved that mystery.

Overall  I found the movie somewhat enjoyable and quite funny in spots. But the

the song is  presented (it's during the movie's climax, if you'll pardon the

</P>
<P>This is your hearing of the (extremely hard-to-hear) spoken words in the 
background just before the main vocal begins, right? IED spent ages going over
that  one, too. Before giving up, he came to the tentative conclusion that it
was a line from  the film which Kate re-inserted in her recording. It might be
the line that the nurse  tells the husband immediately preceding the start of
Kate's song. Her words were  something like &quot;You'll have to wait in here.&quot;
IED is too cheap to go see the movie  again to figure this problem out, but will
have another go at it when it comes out on  video in a few months. It's neat to
see that other people have been studying the song  as closely as you have,
though.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: TWW comments from J.
Drukman 
</P>
<P> Second, if you think there's &quot;not much&quot; production to &quot;This
Woman's Work&quot;,  then you need to &quot;focus&quot; on the song a lot more!
It is very wrong to assume that  production is measured by the thickness of the
sound or the number of identifiable  tracks, or by any such similar quantifying
standard. In classical music production, for  example, an engineer and a
producer sometimes spend entire careers trying to get  the sound of their solo
piano recordings &quot;up to snuff.&quot; Production isn't less present  just
because its presence is less noticeable. 
</P>
<P>And among pop production jobs of recent months -- even years -- IED dares 
anyone to come up with one example that matches or even approaches some of the 
subtly masterful touches of production in &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;. Listen
to the  mixing and matching of ambient sounds in the transition between the
introductory  &quot;Ah-ha-oo&quot;s and the line &quot;Pray God you can cope.&quot;
The difficulty of blending those  sounds without damaging the flow or jarringly
shifting the dominant volume level at  that point, while at the same time
including a spoken line in the &quot;background&quot;  which contains a
different but compatible degree of echo, must be incalculably great. 
</P>
<P>And listen to the spaces -- the moments of &quot;empty&quot; air, the use of
silence in the  recording, even at its climaxes. That's the kind of touch that
ninety-nine out of a  hundred producers could not bring off with the natural,
leisurely authority that Kate  achieved in &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;. And
what about the climactic eight bars, near  the end of the track? There may not &quot;seem&quot;
to be elaborate production in the song,  but IED would bet anyone that that
section involved a hell of a lot of painstaking  production work, involving many
more distinct tracks than might be immediately  audible. The transparency and
clarity of that climax, despite the extraordinary  buildup of both volume and
instrumentation, are a stunning feat of production. 
</P>
<P>IED sincerely hopes that you'll take the time to get even more familiar with
the  song -- familiar enough to realize that it's an extremely good piece of
music. 
</P>
<P>Summation: Are you crazy, or deaf, or wut? &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; is
incredibly  fucking great, for chrissake!

 issue: &quot;&lt;John&gt; Hughes really shows his skill for song selection in
She's Having a  Baby. Those who see the film can't help but be dazzled by
Elizabeth McGovern's  childbirth scene, and part of its power is derived from
the accompanying song, A  Woman's Work &lt;sic&gt; by Kate Bush. With a whisper

</P>
<P>[re Drukman:]
</P>
<P>Actually, Drukman, you have as usual failed utterly to realize anything at
all! IED  is not surprised, but the fact is quite plain (as Ed Suranyi has
already noted  eloquently) that the single mix of This Woman's Work is very
audibly different  from the album version! The strings are much more prominent.
Furthermore, the  lead vocal has been given a slightly more &quot;matte&quot;
sound than on the LP. These are  not illusions, they are perfectly apparent to
anyone who has any ear for musical  nuance at all--or to anyone who actually
takes the trouble to listen to music before  passing judgement on it. 
</P>
<P>Said differences to the recording having been made for the single release,
it  would have been &quot;dishonest&quot; of Kate not to have made the plain and
factual  comment that the single mix differs from that on the album. The idea
that Kate is  attempting thereby to increase sales is patently absurd. She has
several times made it  clear that she is extremely sensitive to the changes in
audio that radio broadcast of  her records can produce in them. As a result, she
has made similarly subtle but  nonetheless very real changes to several of her
earlier recordings prior to their  release as singles, and as in all those prior
instances, the changes were the product of  aesthetic decisions. 
</P>
<P>It becomes clear that we cannot realistically expect Drukman to cease his 
postings on the subject of the new album, for he has--despite himself--been 
undeniably affected by its greatness. What saddens IED more, however, is that
hope  must be abandoned, as well, that Drukman will make even the feeblest sort
of effort  to listen and to think before he posts. Drukman's recent screeds on
the subject of  TSW have been even more heavily laden with factual errors than
their predecessors,  despite IED's and others' repeated demonstrations of
Drukman's apalling  propensity for intellectual and musicological carelessness.

</P>
<P>At this point, we have no choice but to leave Drukman in the dark, grim
morass  of slovenly thinking and tawdry subconnoisseurship to which he
stubbornly insists on  consigning himself. Therefore let us pray to Kate for the
departed, once tolerable (if  never actually respected) Soul of Drukman, and let
us all take heart in the  knowledge that he will surely remain ignorant of the
tragedy of his own fall from  grace. May the scales never fall from Drukman's
eyes, lest he recognize his ilk for  the poor, benighted, fickle, cynical,
Philistine, fad-conscious wretches they are.

</P>
<P>&gt; I don't think so. Or, if they are, I can't hear it, and I have (if I
say so myself) a  pretty good ear for these sorts of things. Maybe they're
pushed just the tiniest  amount up, but it certainly doesn't qualify for the &quot;single
mix&quot; appellation that the  EMI cretins have given it. 
</P>
<P>This is astoundingly stupid. IED just made a comparison of all three mixes
of  TWW on CD last night, and sure enough the distinctions were just as Ed and
IED  described them to you, Drukman, and they weren't even subtle differences.
Listen  to the passages around the line &quot;just can't let it show&quot; and
if you have any vestige of  musicality, even you will be able to detect the
differences in the mix. The  differences between the original soundtrack mix and
the TSW LP mix are already  pretty clear. The difference between the bass line
of the TSW LP mix and the new  single mix are equally audible. 
</P>
<P>This being the case, IED points out once more that it would have been
dishonest  of Kate had she not made the note that this mix is not the same as
the LP mix. IED  frankly can't understand why this simple bit of factual
information should irritate  Drukman, unless its true cause is Drukman's
pathetic frustration at his own  lamentable inability to detect the obvious
differences between these mixes. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, if you listen closely, you will all be able to detect where
the bit of  spoken dialogue, heard in the soundtrack mix of the song near the
beginning, has  been excised. There is an odd kind of noise in exactly that spot
on the TSW LP and  single mixes.

<P>Well, I agree with IED - when I first heard the single mix of &quot;This

you by the  balls and pull out your innards in that way that only Kate Bush can
do. 
</P>
<P>Actually, I also thought of The Beatles' complaints that there was never
enough  bass in their records - I think this was a play by Kate Bush to get more
airplay for  her music by generating a sufficiently large sonic vibration in the
bass that it would  cause the needle to jump off the groove, the record to flip
over, and the B-side to  play without DJ intervention. ;-)

the  original, which includes a very brief, and (to IED) still undeciphered line

version appeared on  the soundtrack CD of &quot;She's Having a Baby&quot;, and
the spoken words were part of  the finished Kate Bush track, not (apparently)
added on later; a mix done for The  Sensual World by Kevin Killen, which brought
the sound of the track into line with  the general sonic character of the album
-- but with the spoken words removed; and  a slightly different-sounding mix of
the album mix, released as the CD-single. The  three tracks sound much more like

<P>  The first line, and the rest of the song, was specifically written for the
John  Hughes film She's Having A Baby . It directly relates to the action in the
film.  Hughes lets Kate's song play in full with no additional voices over the
montage of  the of the husband (Kevin Bacon) worried about his wife's (Elizibeth
Perkins)  difficult delivery. The film is worth catching, if only to catch how
well the song fits  into the film. I'd say that (apart from Kate's own film)
this is the best usage of  Kate's music in a film. Be Kind To My Mistakes works
wonderfully in Castaway ,  but it's used in the opening titles, and would have
more impact later. 
</P>
<P>&gt;Does anyone know if Kate's mum first got sick in 1989? Listen to the
song &amp; it  really sounds like she's preparing to say goodbye to someone she
loves who is dying.  Also, it is fascinating to compare it with &quot;Moments of
Pleasure&quot;, where it sounds like  Kate is actually making direct reference
back to Woman's Work &amp; hence  completing the story about mum:(i.e. &quot;Give
me those moments back&quot; - Woman's  Work;&quot;Just let us try to give these
moments back to those we love, to those who will  survive.&quot; - Moments of
Pleasure.) 
</P>
<P>  Interesting point, and one that I had not noticed. We don't know much
about  Hannah Bush's illness, when it started or even what it was. The family
was, and  always has been very protective of each other. We do know that at the
time of the  1990 Convention, Hannah was somewhat frail.

<P>&gt;-- Graham Bardsley 
</P>
<P> It does! But IED doesn't think there's any reference to Biko in the song, 
Graham. IED thinks she's just saying &quot;We go&quot;. Also, the first lines
are (as IED hears  them): &quot;Can't move my arms/Can't move my legs&quot;.
She's pronouncing them very  unclearly, though, and IED admits he may be quite
wrong.

<P> Kate didn't characterize these sounds as bird cries. She only said her
mother  thought they sounded like a peacock's call. Also, Kate did explain their
narrative  relevance--they are cries for help. Also, IED suspects that there is
more to this song  than Kate let on to that &quot;Len Brown&quot; character in
the NME interview. Let's just  wait a bit and get a few more interviews.

<P>&quot;Walk Straight Down the Middle&quot;, a perfectly wonderful song, was
recorded in  only two days, and we have to put up with Kate pissing around for
*four* years to do  an album! I used to always figure that it just took this
long for her to record such  great music. Now it's clear that Kate just doesn't
have a grip on her own ability to  spew out masterpieces without even thinking
about them. Oh, woe is us!

<P>Regarding Walk Straight Down the Middle: remember that this song was not
part  of The Sensual World. It was intended by Kate to be a b-side. Only when
EMI  requested a &quot;bonus&quot; track for the CD did Kate agree to add WSDtM.
You'll notice  that there's an unusually long pause between the end of TWW and
WSDtM (at  least on IED's copy). 
</P>
<P>The song is NOT, however, a &quot;mistake&quot;. It is a supreme
masterpiece, and a  moment of almost holy, redemptive beauty for our generally
shameful and disgusting  century.
