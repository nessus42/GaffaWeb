<P>I. Goal 
</P>
<P>This paper is a performance-centered analysis of a music video for a rock
song  called &quot;Love and Anger&quot; by Kate Bush, from her 1990 CD The
Sensual World, which  accomplishes its expressive goals by referencing and
manipulating a vast array of  symbolic systems. &quot;Love and Anger&quot;
invokes an emotional, intuitive, and spiritual  response to music and dance,
constructed and explicitly informed by &quot;woman's  perspective.&quot; But how
does this work? 
</P>
<P>Biography and History 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was born in 1959 in Kent of a well-to-do musical family: as a
child she  studied violin formally and piano informally. While at Catholic
school, an inheritance  made it possible for her to record demonstrations of
some early songs. At 18, she was  signed to EMI; when released in 1978, her
debut album The Kick Inside yielded the  European hit single &quot;Wuthering
Heights.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bush last toured in 1979, employing elaborate staging and production, and
utilizing  elements of theater, dance, and mime. Since 1982 she has produced her
records  herself in her own studio, her method being heavily dependent upon a
small circle of  collaborators and the special capacities of the Fairlight and
Synclavier Computer  Musical Instruments. The disc The Sensual World was
released early in 1990; &quot;Love  and Anger&quot; was the first U.S. single. 
</P>
<P> Bush described a heightened awareness of gender during this album's
creative  process: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I just felt that I was exploring my female energy more musically... In
the past I  had wanted to emanate the kind of power that I've heard in male
music. And I just  felt maybe somewhere there is this female energy that's
powerful.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[Diliberto, 1990, 76] 
</P>
<P> Bush is asking a question which has been raised by feminist scholars, and I
have  been wondering this as well. In &quot;Love and Anger,&quot; what is the
nature of the &quot;female  energy that's powerful?&quot; Why am I moved by it? 
</P>
<P>Areas of Focus and Vocabulary 
</P>
<P>I have defined certain foci of artistic resources and vocabulary in &quot;Love
and  Anger.&quot; I suggest that their constructed interaction creates an
intentional perceptual  &quot;frame&quot; [At this point you may wish to glance
at the first page of your handout.] 
</P>
<P>1) Dance: 
</P>
<P>Dance and movement are central in this piece; multiple dance vocabularies
are  quoted, and movement conveys important messages. 
</P>
<P>2) Spiritual Systems: 
</P>
<P>Bush does not speak explicitly about specific spiritual or religious
systems, but  &quot;Love and Anger&quot; is shot through with language and
images drawn from  Catholicism, Sufism, Wicca, and the Tarot. 
</P>
<P>3) Eros, Ecstasy and Transcendence: 
</P>
<P>Much of this album speaks of transcending mundane experience: in various
songs,  Molly Bloom leaves the climactic soliloquy in Ulysses and steps out of
the book into  the &quot;Sensual World;&quot; a nameless visionary on Waterloo
bridge straps a rocket to her  back and takes off into the night, and a woman is
so caught up in the ecstasy of  dancing that she wakes next morning to discover
she has been dancing with Adolf  Hitler. In The Sensual World, and in &quot;Love
and Anger,&quot; transcendence is focal, and  mysteriously powerful. 
</P>
<P>4) Depictions of Gender and Power 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love and Anger&quot; specifically invokes and subverts gendered
expectations,  behaviors, musical archetypes, and interpersonal relations. 
</P>
<P>5) Community 
</P>
<P>Bush frames communication in order to elicit particular reactions, and to
depict a  specific vision of community. The combined musical, visual and
gestural materials  exhibit a multi-layered referentiality which Bogatyrev has
termed &quot;plurisignation.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[play AV#1: complete piece] 
</P>
<P> Lewis, Bauman, Turner, and many others have described both religious and 
musical performance as involving the invocation of &quot;ritual space,&quot; in
which ordinary  objects, juxtaposed within a heightened interpretive field, take
on extraordinary  associations. &quot;Love and Anger&quot; creates such a frame:
in it, Kate Bush wants us to  &quot;see and feel&quot; specific symbols'
emotional and aesthetics implications. Her goal is  depiction of a transcendent
psychological experience. 
</P>
<P>[play AV#1: short excerpt] 
</P>
<P>In the opening sequence [See Music Example #1], Mevlevi Sufi kettledrums
play,  and are joined by a Malagasay valiha playing 16th-note modal figures, and
then by  acoustic piano. As the piano strikes its first harmonically-ambiguous
chord, the shot  focuses to a view of Kate, clad in black, kneeling in the
center of a small spotlight  against a black background, and she sings the
opening lines &quot;It lay buried here, it lay  deep inside me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In many symbolic traditions, this opening posture, kneeling with eyes
closed, is  associated with supplication. However, such a posture inside a
circle of light  references very old, powerful and archetypi-cally feminine
symbolic systems. 
</P>
<P>Quoting the modern witch Starhawk: 
</P>
<P>&quot;We define a new space and a new time whenever we cast a circle to
begin a  ritual. The circle exists on the boundaries of ordinary space and time;
it is &quot;between  the worlds&quot; of the seen and the unseen...a space in
which alternate realities meet, in  which the past and future are open to us.
Time is no longer measured out, it  becomes elastic, fluid...The restrictions
and distinctions of our socially defined roles  no longer apply... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Casting the circle is an enacted meditation. Each gesture we make,
each tool we  use, each power we invoke, resonates through layers of meaning to
awaken an  awareness of ourselves... &quot;The casting of the circle is...the
complex &quot;cue&quot; that tells  us to switch awareness into a deeper mode.&quot;
[Starhawk, 57-58] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Baraka&quot;:
</P>
<P>[play V#2] 
</P>
<P>The piece begins and ends with what strikes me as a crucial visual metaphor:

</P>
<P>1) As Bush sings the line &quot;But it would only take a moment to/Tell you
what I'm  feeling,&quot; [See Music Example #3] and the drum set enters, a
shower of golden dust  begins to fall upon her from above. She shakes her head,
the camera continues its  traverse, and she begins to sway from side to side.
The camera completes its second  circle, to frame her full-face, and she begins
to rise, singing &quot;What would I do  without you?&quot; [See Music Example
#2]] 
</P>
<P>[play V#3] 
</P>
<P>2) During the instrumental section before the first chorus, we see her
erect, head  down, whirling in place as the golden dust falls upon her. 
</P>
<P>[play V#3] 
</P>
<P>3) In the second verse, shots of Bush in stylized posture are intercut with 
perspectives on the dervish dancers, and the golden dust begins to fall over the
 entire scene. As she enters the second chorus, shots of the dervishes' faces
are  intercut with shots of the ballerina's feet, the bass guitar begins a
double-timed  figure, and gold begins to fall on the ballerinas as well. 
</P>
<P>[play V#4] 
</P>
<P>4) After the second chorus, the orb and sceptre are snatched away, and, in a
 beautiful, convulsive gesture, Bush begins to dance in reverse away from the
camera,  eyes closed, gold dust falling around her, singing wordlessly. [See
Music Example #4] 
</P>
<P>[play V#5] 
</P>
<P>5) In the final section, as the chorus repeats, a series of quick cuts move
from  Bush, to close portraits of the individual male musicians, gold dust
falling on all the  participants, individually and collectively. 
</P>
<P>[play V#6] 
</P>
<P>6) At the final tacet she turns, her first direct eye-contact shocking us
with its  immediacy, and flings a handful of gold dust directly at us, as the
frame freezes. She  whispers &quot;Yeah!&quot; 
</P>
<P> In Sufism, mystical Islam, the image of a shower of golden dust is
sometimes  associated with a phenomenon called baraka [insert citation from
Idries Shah The  Sufis]: the spark of transcendence which is bestowed upon and
passed between  spiritual aspirants through the touch of God. ?[The experience
comes from outside,  not within; from grace, not reason; but through music,
dance, and prayer, the  aspirant can make herself a willing vessel, and a
conduit for others.]? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love and Anger&quot; begins with Kate's individual experience of
grace, and  culminates with all present, even we the audience, being touched by
baraka. In  essentially unbroken chronology, she moves from a magic circle, to
dervish dance, to  personal transport, to rock &amp; roll stage collaboration
and finally outside the frame.  We are the final beneficiaries of the ecstasy
which can be attained only when the  aspirant accepts intuitive, not rational,
insight. Through ecstatic dance and rock &amp; roll  music, Bush creates the
possibility of transcendence, joy, and human connection. 
</P>
<P>Kate is explicit about her reliance on intuitive creative processes: 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I'm working on my own things...I summon up a kind of confidence
from  somewhere that in a way is quite blind and has faith in the thing turning
out in the  end.&quot; [Gillis, 42] 
</P>
<P>Feminist psychologist Jean Shindoa Bolen describes this type of procedure as
 &quot;creative conception,&quot; and contrasts it with more linear, verbalized,
or rationalist  approaches: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The function of creative insight is... similar to the transcendent
function. In a  creative process, when there is as yet no known solution to a
problem, the  artist-inventor- problem solver has faith that an answer exists,
and stays with the  situation until the solution comes... The person... trusts a
process of incubation, out  of which something new can emerge.&quot; [Bolen,
292] 
</P>
<P>Or, as Kate puts it in &quot;Love and Anger:&quot; &quot;Someone will come
to help you.&quot; She  goes further, disavowing the possibility of putting the
experience into words: &quot;It's so  deep I don't think that I can/Speak about
it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Analogously paradoxical communicative language is evoked in numerous mystic 
traditions: Leonard Lewin refers to a story of the Sufi teacher Nasruddin, who, 
asked to preach a sermon, inquires of the congregation, &quot;Do you know what I
am  going to say?&quot; They reply &quot;No,&quot; and he answers, &quot;Then it
would take too long to  explain.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Gender 
</P>
<P>Gender is a central issue here. Bush alludes to a &quot;female energy&quot;
that is different  from the typically masculine paradigms of rock music, and of
her desire to explore  this energy. &quot;I didn't want to do that on this
album. I wanted to do it as a woman,  not as a woman working around a man's
world.&quot; [Sutherland, 34. Emphasis added] 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love and Anger&quot; manipulates gender associations by evoking an
archetype of  feminine power and experience. In effect, Bush sets up an
alternate paradigm; to the  issue of rock music's powerful, transforming
sexuality she proposes a response  which is not phallic but celebratory, not
dictatorial but joyfully receptive. Dancing,  she brings baraka, transcendent
experience, from the intimate femininity of a  witch's circle to the masculinity
of the rock and roll stage; she is the vessel, the  medium of reconciliation.
Ecker calls this Sanftmut, the &quot;courage to be gentle.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Eros, ecstasy and transcendence 
</P>
<P>[finetune this/connect to baraka] 
</P>
<P>The bass guitar part presents a particularly interesting example of complex 
semiotics; its overall construction forming a sonic parallel to the visual model
of  baraka. 
</P>
<P>The bass guitar enters after the piano [See Music Example #1] playing double
 whole notes. Subsequently it intensifies to a syncopated figure [See Music
Example  #5] which locks with the bass drum part. At the second chorus, as
baraka falls over  the ballerinas, the bass part begins to &quot;double-time&quot;
in 16th notes [See Music  Example #6]. It drops out precipitately at the
tacet/freeze frame. 
</P>
<P>An analogous arching metaphor is often cited in ecstatic literature: that of
the  cresting wave. The aspirant performs exercises of cleansing and
preparation. If all  conditions are right, the wave of transcendence lifts her
above normal experience  with an implacable power beyond her own. Similarly, the
tremendous rhythmic  impetus supplied by the bass part lifts the entire piece,
until the bass tacets and the  wave of experience rolls away, leaving only the
recollection of transformation. 
</P>
<P>Bush employs a complex and multireferential symbolic vocabulary. Time 
constraints preclude a comprehensive exploration, but we may say that in visual,
 sonic, and textual areas symbolism is equivalently dense and consistent. [At
this point  you may wish to glance at the comparisons of selected text from &quot;Love
and Anger&quot;  and the Sufi poet Kahlil Gibran.] 
</P>
<P>Again quoting the Sufi scholar Leonard Lewin: &quot;We are dealing here with
an  extra, if hidden dimension; linear exposition cannot adequately cover the
ground, and  a different process is necessary if the multiple interrelationships
between what  would otherwise be the fragments of a piecemeal approach are to be
developed and  understood.&quot; [Lewin, in Shah, 249] 
</P>
<P>Kates realizes that dense symbolic techniques can activate an intuitive
experiential  response. Such a ritual response results not from clearly grasped
linear associations  but rather from the dynamic tension such symbolic overload
creates. So the  experience of ritual art can actually invoke the experience of
transcendence. 
</P>
<P>Yet intuition is not necessarily, or even most commonly, a solitary
phenomenon: it  has potent capacities for creating communion. Bush described
this album's creative  process as built upon what Belenky calls &quot;Women's
Ways of Knowing:&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think the hardest thing about working with the Trio Bulgarka [a
women's  choral group] was just having enough courage to go ahead and do it...
In terms of  music it was not a problem. We just communicated emotionally and
just kind of  cuddled each other and sang to each other. It was just the most
incredible  experience to...work with women like that-- on a creative level.&quot;
[Sarnoff, 60] 
</P>
<P>In Music of the Common Tongue, Christopher Small has suggested that the 
ultimate goal of music performance in a specific cultural context can consist of
 momentarily bringing the ideal society into being, whether this vision of an
ideal  society is modelled by a symphony orchestra, a chamber group, a rock
band, a  percussion ensemble, or a gamelan. 
</P>
<P>Hence music performance is also ritual performance, and ecstatic procedures,
 chant, music, dance, etc., both construct and reflect ritual perception. In &quot;Love
and  Anger,&quot; Kate Bush models a social interaction which embraces
intuition, intimacy,  shared creative experience, individuality, and a close
connection with the  subconscious. Belenky has described this deeply personal
approach to communication  as &quot;passionate knowing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This piece of music offers an extraordinary spectrum of experiential
possibilities,  revealing different layers of meaning to different listeners.
Most importantly, like the  fables of the Sufi Nasruddin, the ancient traditions
of women's creativity, the  archetypes of Jung, and the metaphorical richness of
Catholicism, Wicca, and the  Tarot, the composition &quot;Love and Anger&quot;
invokes and celebrates a transformation of  human experience.

<P>&gt;&gt; LYRICA. The paper is entitled &quot;'Like a Bell to a Southerly

</P>
<P>&gt;But: 
</P>
<P>&gt;Still unanswered: 
</P>
<P>&gt;WHAT IS THIS SONG ABOUT? 
</P>
<P>&gt;Do you think, she did all the stuff you've discovered intentionally? 
</P>
<P>ok, very brief response (i mean, this reply could be a whole OTHER paper!
:-)) 
</P>
<P>i think that the song is about transcendent experience, referencing the 
psychological and spiritual transformation which can be precipitated by ecstatic
 religion (sufism, wicca, etc), by intuitive creativity (eg in this case &quot;women's
ways of  knowing&quot;), by dance (both sufi and free-form), and by yes, even 
male-energy-oriented rock &amp; roll. i think the genius of the piece (both
video and  music working together) is that it draws connections between all of
these  transcendent media, pulling them together inclusively, showing both the
desirability  and the achievei-ability of the transcendent experience, and
including male/female,  &quot;classical&quot;/&quot;vernacular&quot;, &quot;dance/
music&quot;, &quot;sound/image&quot;, &quot;christian/pagan/muslim&quot; 
dichotomies in an inclusive view of human experience. 
</P>
<P>i think that the performance is a representation of an ecstatic experience,
which  begins quietly with invocation and preparation of the self for
transformation, moves  into a &quot;ritual space&quot; constructed by evocative
dance, movement, images, and  language, moves further into the ecstatic
experience that results, peaks out in  ecstasy, and then &quot;de-crescendos&quot;
musically, sonically, visually, and experientially. 
</P>
<P>finally, i think that the GOAL of the piece is 
</P>
<P>a) to show the threads of psychological, spiritual, and experiential
connection  between these widely contrasted media and symbolic systems; 
</P>
<P>b) to validate a life lived according to experience and intuition, not only
linearity; 
</P>
<P>c) to depict these connections, and the enormous transformative power of
these  experiences, and 
</P>
<P>d) finally, and most radically, i believe that the piece not only is
intended to depict  such an experience, but actually to invoke it in the
listener/ viewer. 
</P>
<P>next time you watch that video, stand up, turn the sound up, let your body
move  if it's impelled to, and feel the reactions in your own body at the
following points: 
</P>
<P>a) when the first course comes in and kate stands up 
</P>
<P>b) when she stretches out her arms, holding the orb and sceptre, the
ballerinas  snatch them away, and she convulses; 
</P>
<P>c) when she comes up into the camera, humming, and dances away with her eyes
 closed; 
</P>
<P>d) when she is carried to the stage, and comes up dancing ecstatically; 
</P>
<P>e) as the camera swings around showing all the men in her band, (and how
loving  these portraits of her collaborators are!); 
</P>
<P>f) when she turns, hurling gold dust into the camera, freezes, and whispers &quot;YEAH!&quot;

</P>
<P>you may find your own physical reactions revealing. i watch this video (and
i'm  no kate authority), and i can FEEL my own physical and psychological
reactions. 
</P>
<P>still one of the most amazing psychological performances i've ever seen.
