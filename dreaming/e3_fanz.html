    <P>&gt; From: Susanne E Trowbridge &lt;ins aset@jhunix&gt; </P>
    
    <P>&gt; BTW, has another issue of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; been published?
    </P>
    
    <P>There hasn't been a new one since issue seven, which was Christmas '84.
      Robyn Somerville says she plans on coming out with some more issues
      sometime. Rumor says that Dale Sommerville has totally removed himself
      from the project. He was disillusioned or something when he met Kate in
      person. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I subscribed for the first three or four issues, and thought the
      pictures were nice and enjoyed the article reprints, but its level of
      KB-worship seemed a bit on the fanatic side, or at least I thought so at
      the time. </P>
    
    <P>Yeah, it can be kind of silly at times. There are only so many silly
      stories one can take about unicorns and Kate or Kate Bush crossword
      puzzles or Kate Bush connectograms. But there's plenty of interesting
      stuff too to make it quite worthwhile. </P>

    <P>&gt; Doug, did the rumour about Dale Sommerville becoming disillusioned
      after meeting KB give any clue as to why? </P>
    
    <P>Well this probably isn't the most appropriate place to discuss such
      things. It is said that Dale can be quite pushy and that the record
      company and Kate's family, etc. didn't appreciate this. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Under The Ivy Fanzine </P>
    
    <P>As far as the &quot;Under the Ivy&quot; fanzine goes, I'm personally
      staying away from it, since it sounds pretty shady. Apparently, it is run
      by Andrew Whiteside, who has been a Kate fan for a long time, but who is
      also practicing to be a rock critic along side with Richard Cook! Several
      years ago, he sent an article in to Homeground, completely slagging off &quot;Never
      for Ever&quot; and most of Kate's other albums in the same sort of Richard
      Cook style. When Peter Morris questioned why he was sending such an overly
      negative review in to Homeground (and asked him to tone it down somewhat),
      Andrew ran off like a bratty kid and started up his own fanzine. I have
      never read an entire article, but someone read me his &quot;review&quot;
      of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; in which he ran down all the songs, saying,
      for instance, that &quot;Running up that Hill&quot; is such a boring song,
      that everyone he knows wants to skip the needle over it and go on to the
      second song! </P>

      <BR> Subject: HG 23 </P>
    
    <P>Got &quot;Homeground&quot; number 23 yesterday. Doug has mentioned the
      big news to L-Hs, with appropriate dubiety about its reliability. IED
      would like to add for the record that this issue is really a major
      improvement over earlier HGs. If it were just the glossy paper I wouldn't
      be (too) impressed (I hope), but the artwork is a definite improvement:
      Debbie's (?) cover is really an exceptional drawing after a photo, and
      Steve's &quot;Cosmic Kate&quot; is much better organized than it used to
      be, and quite funny. Perhaps the competition, as well as the shot in the
      arm they've got from Kate's apparent endorsement, have combined to push
      them to new heights. </P>

      <BR> Subject: new Break-Through </P>
    
    <P>The new Break-Through is out, and includes the UNEDITED post-Hounds of
      Love interview by Peter Swales for Musician magazine, the interview with
      Kate, Del and Paddy together, in what IED considers to be BY FAR the best
      interview ever done. Swales asks absolutely wonderful questions,
      understands many (though not all) of the fine points of Kate's music and
      thoroughly understands the general importance of it. Furthermore, as a
      close and longtime personal friend of the Bush family, he has brought to
      the interview situation an informality and relaxed atmosphere that has
      produced long and extremely frank comments from all parties involved. It
      is INDISPENSIBLE reading. </P>
    
    <P>Also something of a relief: the Christian shit has been confined mainly
      to the first page editorial, perhaps partly in reaction to IED's and Mike
      Weaver's polite but strong suggestions that this be done. Overall, in
      IED's opinion, this edition of Break-Through stands as the best single
      Kate Bush fanzine issue published to date. Of course there's alot of
      scumwad schlock in it, but in all fairness to Robyn, she has published an
      awful lot of thoughtful and edifying KT-related stuff in the past three
      issues, and is to be thanked sincerely for her policy of printing nearly
      everything sent to her without editing or abridgement. This is in marked
      contrast to Homeground, and obviously it is a service completely
      unavailable from the official Oracle of KT, the Kate Bush Newsletter. </P>

      <BR> Subject: KBC NEWsletter </P>
    
    <P>The latest Kate Bush Club Newsletter finally arrived on IED's doorstep
      today, the last day of 1987. It's altogether a rather disappointing little
      booklet, overshadowed by Kate's announcement that Zoodle has died,
      evidently prompting the termination of Kate's years-old Zoo-and-Pye comic
      strip... </P>
    
    <P>Still, there are a couple of very bright spots in this otherwise sad
      issue: several previously unpublished colour photos, among them two
      absolutely breathtaking shots -- one of which is the first-ever colour
      print of a photo from The Ninth Wave, and the other of which, as far as
      IED can tell, is a staggering new front-cover portrait of Kate in very
      unusual makeup and leotard, and looking very much thinned out ... </P>

      <BR> Subject: New Kate Bush Interview. </P>
    
    <P>Here is [an excerpt from] the interview from the new Kate Bush Club
      newsletter. </P>
    
    <P>Q. I know you like animals and I hear you keep cats.. I wondered how
      many you have? </P>
    
    <P>A. I used to have 2 cats.. Zoodle and Pyewackit but I'm afraid that
      Zoodle died earlier this year.. I was very upset but she was eleven and
      had a good life. She was a beautiful cat. Pyewackit is absolutely fine
      although she missed Zoodle at first. A few months ago we adopted a stray,
      feeding her and letting her live in the garage and she had 3 kittens. We
      now have the 3 kittens, they are called Rocket, Sparky and Torchy and
      although Pye didn't like them all at first.. they all get on really well
      now and we find them cuddled up on a chair together when we get in..
      they're such good company for her and they all have such different
      personalities.. it's so entertaining just sitting watching them play..
      it's bringing out the kitten in Pye, I've noticed her springing across the
      floor and leaping onto ledges that are far too small for her.. she does
      things she hasn't tried for years and seems to be enjoying it all. I guess
      we're all young at heart.. but sometimes it takes something to rediscover
      it! </P>

      <BR> Subject: New Homeground (30) is out </P>
    
    <P>The 30th issue of Homeground (The International Kate Bush Fanzine)
      arrived today, and it included a nice plug for Love-Hounds. Here is the
      entry: </P>
    
    <P>Aside from this, the latest issue is more or less typical Homeground
      fare. It includes the latest in Peter's &quot;Five Years Ago&quot; series,
      a few (necessarily) insubstantial &quot;news&quot; updates, quite a few
      works of art by fans -- a lot of these quite good, especially the
      thoroughly professional though perhaps a little too gooey and commercial
      monochrome images of Kate by Debi Bowes -- and several pages of
      yucky-soppy poetry and fiction...plus letters, swaps and personals. Peter
      also announced plans to publish the complete &quot;Five Years Ago&quot;
      entries as a collection (this is basically just a prose version of the
      Kate Bush Complete chronology, with the occasional extra fact thrown in)
      for subscribers only. And IED has it from Andrew Marvick that he was not
      too annoyed to find his article on bootlegs butchered and abridged to
      ribbons, with at least one new factual error and one grammatical error
      thrown in for good measure. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
      <BR> Subject: Yet another KT fanzine is out </P>
    
    <P>Actually the revival of an old KT fanzine which had been reported as
      defunct in Homeground and elsewhere. IED is speaking of Under the Ivy, a
      British-based Kate publication for fans who must have anything to do with
      Kate no matter how exploitive or shoddy. Love-Hounds may remember reports
      of the first five issues of UtI, the last one of which was published over
      nine months ago. Now there is Kate, An Under the Ivy Publication (Issue
      Number 6). </P>
    
    <P>No reason is given for the change of title, but the motivation is clear:
      Under the Ivy was too obscure a title to attract the poor, fledgling Kate
      fan who is this group's prime prey. Also, no date appears anywhere in this
      twenty-odd-page b&amp;w &quot;glossy&quot; magazine, but it was probably
      printed up very recently since IED's arrived via air mail. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately this doesn't mean that there is any up-to-date info in the
      thing. Far from it. The single column of &quot;news&quot; flashes consists
      entirely of minor miscellany culled and regurgitated from other fanzines,
      including Homeground and The Kate Bush Club Newsletter. In fact, the text
      of the entire issue was originally written at least three months ago,
      judging from references to now-long-past events and release-dates. (For
      example, KBVI is confidently expected in early Spring 1988!) </P>
    
    <P>Beyond that, the fanzine contains un-proofread copy, mostly dot-matrixed
      in something like 16 or 20 point type size (fills up the page with a
      minimum of words and effort). An &quot;exclusive&quot; interview with
      Kate, post-The Whole Story, conducted by Harry Doherty, is actually taken
      from Hurricane, and is so poorly transcribed that whole paragraphs and
      sentences seem to have been omitted through sheer haste and incompetence.
      There is a ridiculous comparison of Thomas Dolby to Kate Bush (in which
      Dolby seems to come out &quot;on top&quot;), and a two-page listing of &quot;a
      Kate Bush fan's&quot; (read the publishers of Under the Ivy !) record
      collection for sale -- nothing particularly interesting or rare, with all
      prices absurdly inflated. And a hopelessly incomplete list of Kate's TV
      appearances. </P>
    
    <P>Altogether this is a despicable piece of manipulative
      bootlegger-mentality drivel for Kate fanatics only. So if you see a
      fanzine called Kate in your import shop anytime soon, avoid it. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Lone Star Lionhearts -- new fan club </P>
    
    <P>Well, I sent in a SASE to get information about that new fan club. (I
      posted the classified ad that appeared in Goldmine a few weeks ago.) I
      just got an answer. Here is the form letter I got, in full, for others who
      might be interested: </P>
    
    <P> LONE STAR LIONHEARTS </P>
    
    <P>Austin, Texas 78711 </P>
    
    <P>Dear Kateophiles, Here, There &amp; Everywhere -- </P>
    
    <P>Greetings! Please forgive this form letter, but the response to my
      announcement has been too great to permit an individual response to
      everyone. This is just to let you know that your letter has been received,
      and tha we *will* be letting you know when LONE STAR LIONHEARTS -- The
      Journal Of Kate Bush Kommentary will be accepting subscriptions. Rates
      will probably be in the $16 for four issues range, and I anticipate the
      first issue to be published this fall. (These things take time to
      organize, and little matters such as the need for Ye Editor to hold down
      his demanding day job keep getting in the way.) </P>
    
    <P>You can help the big moment arrive and ensure the viability of LSL by
      submitting your articles, artwork, Kate photos, news clippings, and want
      ads. Please direct all mail to the address above, with an SASE if you need
      a reply. LSL will be an experiment to see if North America can support a
      quality publication for Kate Bush fans and students, and will only be as
      good as its contributors make it. I'd like to see it become both
      informative and entertaining; substantial and mature, yet with a sense of
      humor. In short, very much like Kate's work itself. Are these goals
      mutually contradictory? We'll see. </P>
    
    <P>Until later -- it's in the works.. . it's coming! </P>

      <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward Suranyi)
      <BR> Subject: Editorial from the first issue of Still Breathing </P>
    
    <P>T. R. Somerville just sent me some back issues of Still Breathing
      --that's the Kate fanzine she edits up in Canada. In particular, I got the
      first three issues. </P>
    
    <P>At one time T. R. and her husband Dale edited a wonderful fanzine called
      Breakthrough. It was thick, with glossy paper and color photos. I had
      heard (mainly from IED) the story of how this fanzine ended production,
      but I had never heard T. R. tell this story herself. In the editorial in
      the first issue of Still Breathing (Nov. 87), she does. The story is sad
      yet funny. I thought Love-Hounds who had never heard it might be
      interested. </P>
    
    <P>She writes: </P>
    
    <P>Welcome to the first, and hopefully not the last, issue of STILL
      BREATHING, the continuing saga of friends who love to listen, talk and
      breathe Kate bush. </P>
    
    <P>Once upon a time, in a small town in Manitoba, the now defunct
      BREAKTHROUGH was born. In the same place it died, by my hand for many many
      reasons. Money was not the problem, the major problem of BREAKTHROUGH's
      demise was Dale Somerville. The magazine was supposed to be about Kate
      Bush, however, Dale kept turning away articles and stories because they
      conflicted with his beliefs, so he tried to make it into a magazine about
      *his* beliefs, (as you saw with issues #10 &amp; #11) with Kate Bush on
      the side. [Those last issues of Breakthrough had more pictures of dead
      pets than of Kate! -- Ed] He then decided to abolish Kate Bush altogether
      and just put out a religious magazine, trying to make out that Kate Bush
      and her music was evil and she was controlled by Satan. </P>
    
    <P>Forget that. I ended BREAKTHROUGH right then and there and in no way was
      I going to contend with stuff like that. In fact, I also ended the
      marriage right then and there. Two years of physical, mental and emotional
      abuse was too much for me to stand. I wasn't going to put up with any of
      that bullshit any more. Dale and I are separated and will be getting a
      divorce in March, 1988. </P>
    
    <P>I was very sad that B-T ended as I lost contact with a lot of people and
      I wasn't allowed to look at the mail anyway, as Dale opened it all up and
      threw away any that didn't have money in them, or simply sent them back.
    </P>
    
    <P>So I left Dale and went to Winnipeg to live in a woman's shelter for two
      weeks, then off to an apartment in which I was tormented by Dale
      continuously. </P>
    
    <P>Now I'm back in British Columbia trying to start a new life. My horse
      had a baby colt and all is well at five months of age. After one minor car
      accident and one real bad car accident, I decided enough is enough, I'm
      gonna start a new Kate Bush magazine if it kills me. Just because one has
      no money doesn't mean one can't put out a magazine.. .. </P>
    
    <P>She goes on to describe the new fanzine, and how she's desperate for
      submissions and subscriptions. </P>

    <P>Here's some US news I never saw posted: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The 'International Rock Awards' were broadcast across the country
      on 6th June. Kate was nominated in the 'best rock pianist' category with
      the likes of Elton John and Billy Joel. A short snatch of the video for &quot;This

      to Mr. Joel.&quot; </P>

    <P>Here's another US item I never saw in love-hounds: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The University of Minnesota St. Paul student centre were running
      in April/May a ten week series of video shows under the title Progressive
      Rock on Video. The show devoted to Kate (entitled Kate Bush: An In-depth
      Study ) was on 10/4 [that's April 10 for Americans not used to British
      dates] with free admission running from 7.00 pm until after 10.00. On the
      the programme were all the promotional videos from 1978 to 1986, the Live
      at Hammersmith tape, the 1979 Kate Bush in Concert German TV special, the
      UK BBC special from December 1989 and various TV performances mainly
      1980-1986.&quot; </P>

      <BR> Subject: Tipper list </P>
    
    <P>One more item that came to light in my talk with Peter. He &amp; Krys
      knew the second they looked at the &quot;Tipper list&quot; that it was a
      joke. They were rolling on the floor laughing at the obvious in-jokes.
      They also got Chris' &quot;confession&quot; so they knew he wrote it. They
      printed the list by itself, without comment, just to see how people would
      react. It seems that quite a few people took it seriously and wrote in
      very worried. Peter assures me that he will reveal the truth about the
      list in the next Homeground. I was certain that Peter must have gotten the
      joke and it's nice to know that he did. </P>

      <BR> From: Jeff Tucker &lt;R3JMT%AKRONVM@vm1.cc.UAKRON.EDU&gt;
      <BR> Subject: from Little Light </P>
    
    <P> The following appears in Little Light, Summer 1991, published by The
      American Association of Them Heavy People, PO Box 221, Cuyahoga Falls OH
      44222-0221. Replies are welcome, as are letters to the editor or other
      discussion. </P>
    
    <P>GRINDING ON </P>
    
    <P>The latest issue of Homeground features three items of potential
      interest to Little Light readers who have been keeping up on the
      PMRC/Sinful Music/LL's Humorless controversy. </P>
    
    <P>A full page letter from Len Bullard and Beverly Allen offers what might
      be called a more reasonable approach than either Homeground or Little
      Light have taken in the past, even though the letter has less to do with
      the controversy per se than with broad editorial advice: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The PMRC is not our biggest concern.... Taking time to promote
      Kate is something we do because her work merits it. She is the best, and
      she deserves our best.... Our respect for Kate runs deep because she busts
      her ass to do all the good she can with the talents she has and never once
      jumped at the easy money just because there was a lot of it. Such a spirit
      is rare on this earth. If you are going to represent it, respect it.... We
      don't mean to fuss at you. You work long hours to help a very special
      woman.... But before you kick the colonies too hard, remember that you get
      to enjoy the personal support of that woman.... The Americans aren't
      stupid or cowardly, just tired and neglected.... Maybe if she tours she'll
      remember to send a little light our way....&quot; </P>
    
    <P> A second letter from Gillian Gaar of Seattle reads in part: &quot;I've
      been following the occasional mention you make of censorship in the US
      with interest. I didn't pick up on the PMRC parody, but I don't think the
      issue is very funny....&quot; So we weren't as isolated as some people
      would have had us believe, and Homeground's American readers (including
      us) didn't necessarily know &quot;quite well&quot; what the PMRC's
      policies were. A welcome recognition of other viewpoints. </P>
    
    <P> Third, they do finally talk about the BBCs ban (so to speak) of &quot;Army
      Dreamers&quot;. Some of our newer readers have asked us for a retraction
      of our comments in the last issue. We would remind everybody of John
      Malene's letter to Homeground dated November 12, 1990, in which he
      enclosed a copy of the BBC memo in question in the form it took on that
      date. It took Homeground six months, two issues, and a war and a peace to
      get around to covering the news. We won't retract, but will leave you with
      what is perhaps a more reasonable attitude which Edward Suranyi proposed.
      Perhaps they didn't think there was going to be a war. Or perhaps they
      just lost it (this has seemingly happened in the past). Ok, we're grinning
      a bit </P>

    <P>Jorn writes: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; PS-- C&amp;V expect to meet Erni this weekend, coz he's in town for
      the WorldCon sci-fi convention. We'll be sure to ask for details about
      this Little Light blurb. (Jeff, are you there? Does LL have an editorial
      bias that's not explicitly stated?) </P>
    
    <P>Yes, we met and had a nice time. Erni held an official Special Interest
      Group meeting about Kate. He even had a meeting room reserved for it.
      There were about 10 people there and we discussed various topics. We
      talked a lot about the tour and a lot about Love-Hounds. When the hour was
      up and we had to give up the meeting room to another Special Interest
      Group, a few of us continued the conversation out in a reception area,
      taking over a corner w/ couches &amp; a table. </P>
    
    <P>Erni is a fascinating guy. I could have sat and talked to him for hours.
      His experience is the complete opposite of Dale Sommerville's. Erni used
      to be a fundimentalist Christian who began questioning his beliefs after
      the Jim Bakker scandal. All during the (probably painful) questioning and
      re-evaluating process, Kate's music was there for him, playing like a
      soundtrack to this very important time in his life. He said that he
      believes, from hints that he's picked up, that Little Light is run by
      Born-Again Christians. He said that he asked someone (? I forget who he
      said) at Little Light and they didn't confirm or deny it. Jeff? </P>

      <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald Hill)
      <BR> Subject: New Homeground letter </P>
    
    <P>Got a form letter from Homeground yesterday: </P>
    
    <P>Dear Everyone, </P>
    
    <P>Yes, you guessed it, this is not HOMEGROUND 43, which has been delayed
      for a number of reasons, including the fact that HOMEGROUND TOWERS is
      having its guts ripped out whilst a new central heating system is being
      put in. Also you may have noticed that there is not a great deal of news.
      In fact we need a small respite to catch up on ourselves. We also need a
      bit of time to get back to all those who have written and are still
      awaiting a reply! Issue 43 will follow shortly and will be this year's
      Christmas issue. No-one will loose out, everyone will get all the issues
      they have paid for. </P>
    
    <P>THE NEWS </P>
    
    <P>Prince's new album 'Pearls and Diamonds', released in a rather striking
      3D cover, does in fact contain a thankyou credit to Kate, although she
      does not actually appear on the album. </P>
    
    <P>The Elton John tribute album 'Two Rooms' will be released world-wide on
      14th October. Kate's track (a stunning version of Rocket Man) will be used
      in the USA to help break the album on alternative radio. </P>
    
    <P>British readers will have seen the recent British Rail publicity
      campaign that included a poster will the slogan 'Kate Bush branches out
      for &amp;1' The poster featured a photo of a little girl whose name
      actually is Catherine Bush (if not the one we know and love). We can
      report that Kate was actually approached for permission to 'use' her name
      in this way, and was quite happy. </P>
    
    <P>Karen Childerstone - whom many of you will remember performed admirably
      at the 1990 Convention (and whom, as many of you may know is managed by
      Dave) - will be releasing her version of 'Under The Ivy' as her debut
      single before Christmas. The record, produced by Paul Muggleton and Mike
      Paxman (of Judie Tzuke fame) will be available through Polygram hopefully
      at the end of November. </P>

    <P>Homeground 44 arrived this morning. </P>
    
    <P>Oh, and HG have organised a 10th anniversary party in a club in London
      on May 24. They say it's not a convention, and I wouldn't expect KaTe to
      be there, but just an opportunity to meet KaTefans and boogie on down to
      her music (it sez here). Tickets are L6. </P>

    <P> I just got the latest HOMEGROUND [44], and it's really good, probably
      my favorite since the one that had the pics from the convention. Highly
      recommended. </P>
    
    <P>They also mention a new book: </P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush - The First Twelve Years is another collection of newpaper and
      magazine cutting covering the years from 1978 in two volumes selling for
      about &amp;12-00 [pounds]. Details can be obtained via the fanzine Never
      For Ever. [Who's address they list as 28 Millbrook St, Plasmar 1, Swansea
      SA6 8JY Wales.] </P>
    
    <P>Naturally this caught my attention! Does anyone else have any more
      details? </P>

    <P>Speaking of the KBC, I got a letter from them yesterday. To quote the
      important parts: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;What we would like to do is make the Club more of an information
      service so there will be no membership fee. All you need to do is send one
      SASE (SASE + IRC for overseas) marked SAE 3 and when we know about an
      event or release far enough in advance, we will send you a letter.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Magazines will still be produced... and will be on sale
      exclusively from us.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;You can still send your feedback to Kate via us, in the same way.
      We will still keep everyone's name on the computer in case there is some
      extra special information...or if the record company wish to do a mail
      out...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;New 'members' will still be given a membership number but no
      membership package.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The new magazine is already at the printers but we will probably
      delay posting until after the Xmas rush&quot;. </P>
