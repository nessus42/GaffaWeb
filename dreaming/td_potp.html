Subject: Pull Out The Pin 
</P>
<P>This is what Kate has to say about &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot; from an
interview in  Keyboard (Jul 85): 
</P>
<P>My motivations are not social or political. It's an emotional motivation,
where I'm  so moved by something that I have to write. 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>There was this fantastic TV documentary about a cameraman who was on the 
front lines. He was a brilliant cameraman and he was so well-trained a
technician  that he kept filming things no matter how he was feeling about it at
the time. Some  of the stuff he was shooting was really disturbing. Some of
these Vietnamese guys  would just come in and they were sort of dying in
mid-air. And he'd just keep on  filming. It was strange the sort of irony that
these Vietnamese who were fighting  the Americans were Buddhists and they'd pop
a silver bullet that they wore on a  chain around their necks into their mouth
before they went into battle. So if they  died, they would have Buddha on their
lips. This is the whole irony throughout  history between religion and war. &quot;Breathing&quot;
is about human beings killing  themselves. I think that people smoking is one of
those tiny things that says a lot  about human beings. I mean, I smoke and enjoy
it, but we smoke and we know it's  dangerous. Maybe there's some kind of strange
subconscious desire to damage  ourselves. It would seem so if you looked back
through history, wouldn't it? 
</P>
<P>And from Zig Zag (1982): 
</P>
<P>I saw this incredible documentary by this Australian camerman who went on
the  front line in Vietnam, filming from the Vietnamese point of view, so it was
very  biased against the Americans. He said it really changed him, because until
you live  on the level like that, when it's complete survival, you don't know
what it's about.  He's never been the same since because it's so devastating
people dying all the  time. 
</P>
<P>The way he portrayed the Vietnamese was this really crafted, beautiful race.
The  Americans were these big, fat, pink, smelly things, who the Vietnamese
could smell  coming for miles because of the tobacco and cologne. It was
devastating because you  got the impression that the Vietnamese were so
beautiful and all getting wiped out.  They wore a little silver Buddha on a
chain around their neck and when they went  into action they'd pop it into their
mouth, so that if they died they'd have Buddha  on their lips. I wanted to write
a song that could somehow convey the whole thing,  so we set it in the jungle
and had helicopters, crickets and little Balineses frogs. 
</P>
<P>And from Kate's newsletter: 
</P>
<P>We sat in front of the speakers trying to focus on the picture -- a green
forest,  humid and pulsating with life. We are looking at the Americans from the
 Vietnamese point of view and almost like a camera we start in wide shot. Right
in  the distance you can see the trees moving, smoke and sounds drifting our
way,...  sounds like a radio. Closer in with the camera and you can catch
glimpses of their  pink skin. We can smell them for miles with their sickly
cologne, American tobacco  and their stale sweat. 
</P>
<P>Take the camera even closer and we find a solitary soldier, perhaps the one
I  have singled out. (Sometimes a Vietnamese would track a soldier for days and
follow  him until he eventually took him). This soldier is under a tree, dozing
with a faint  smile and a radio by his side. It's a small transister radio out
of which cries an  electric guitar, I'd swear it was being played by Brian Bath,
but how could it be, way  out here on our stereo screen. 
</P>
<P>I pop the silver buddha that I wear around my neck into my mouth securing my
 lips around his little metal body, I move towards the sleeping man. A
helicopter soars  overhead, he wakes up and as he looks me in the eyes I relate
to him as I would a  helpless stranger. Has he a family and a lady waiting for
him at home, somewhere  beyond the Chinese drums and double bass that stalks
like a wild cat through  bamboo? 
</P>
<P>The moving pictures freeze-frame and fade, someone's stopped the
multi-track,  there's more overdubs to do. 
</P>

<P>Baccy's tobacco, but what's Yankee hash? Army rations, probably? (Americans 
didn't bring hashish *into* Vietnam!)

<P>Yankee hash is referring to marijuana I would think. They might not have
brought it  *into* Vietnam but some of them certainly smoked it.
