Subject: Under The Ivy 
</P>
<P>Here's something I wrote to Hugh Maher a week ago, that contains the lyrics
to  &quot;Under The Ivy&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;: 
</P>
<P>From nessus Thu Aug  8 13:40:50 1985 <BR> Subject: Lyrics and
interpretation of &quot;Under The Ivy&quot; 
</P>
<P>These are the lyrics as I hear them. This is the first of Kate's songs where
I've  ever noticed her lisp while singing. 
</P>
<P>What a song! What lyrics! I can barely take it! I'm typing this in with
tears in  my eyes.... 
</P>
<P>It wouldn't take me long <BR> To tell you how to find it <BR> To tell you
where we'll meet <BR> This little girl inside me <BR> Is retreating to her
favorite place 
</P>
<P>Go into the garden <BR> Go under the ivy <BR> Go under the leaves <BR>
Away from the party <BR> Go right to the rose <BR> Go right to the white rose 
</P>
<P>I sit here in the thunder <BR> The green on the grave <BR> I feel it all
around me <BR> And it's not easy for me <BR> To give away your secret <BR>
It's not safe 
</P>
<P>But go into the garden <BR> Go under the ivy <BR> Under the leaves <BR>
Away from the party <BR> Go right to the rose <BR> Go right to the white rose
<BR> Go under the ivy <BR> Go under the leaves <BR> Go right to the rose
<BR> Go right to the white rose 
</P>
<P>I'll be waiting for you <BR> It wouldn't take me long <BR> To tell you how
to find it   [line corrected.  WIE]
</P>
<P>It seems to me to be about the longing for youthful innocence lost. (Isn't a
white  rose a symbol of virginity?  I'm not sure.) In this sense it seems to be
a follow-up to  &quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot;, which is also one of my very
favorite pre-Dreaming KB  songs. (My favorite pre-Dreaming songs are for your
info &quot;Breathing&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot;, &quot;In  Search of Peter Pan&quot;,
&quot;Moving&quot;, &quot;Saxophone Song&quot;, &quot;L'Amour...&quot;, and  &quot;December...&quot;)
&quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot; is about Kate's desire not to lose her 
youthful innocence, which she still had, I suppose, when she wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Under The Ivy&quot; also seems to be about Kate contemplating suicide.
And maybe  the song is addressed to Death. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It wouldn't take me long <BR>  To tell you how to find it&quot;

<P>From: ihnp4!sdcsvax!sdcc13!valerie (Valerie Polichar) <BR> &gt; The white
rose is usually used as a symbol of death, so I would go with Doug's  death
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>If that's true, it certainly clinches the death/suicide interpretation! The
other line  that really makes me think that is &quot;Away from the party&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I've never heard of a white rose being a symbol for death, but I'm probably
just  ignorant. I would have thought it would be a symbol for purity and
innocence, but  two other people today have confirmed to me that it is a symbol
for death, but they  didn't know why or from where. 
</P>
<P>So whywhofromwhenwherewhetherhitherhereforto is a white rose a symbol for

Subject: symbolics
</P>
<P>A couple weeks ago, I received a 4 page letter via U.S. Mail from Keith
Patrick  DeWeese, a big Kate Bush fan in Florida. He doesn't have a computer
account, but  receives Love-Hounds on paper. He has a bunch of interesting
things to say, so I've  decided to type in some of the letter (Thanks a lot for
the letter Keith!): 
</P>
<P>[Under the Ivy:] 
</P>
<P>&quot;my room-mate and I did some research into the lyrics. Here's what we
found:  the garden is symbolic of the female genitalia; ivy is symbolic of
Dionysus and his  female attendants; according to Hazlitt, &quot;things spoken
'under the rose' (sub rosa)  were part of Venus' sexual mysteries, not to be
revealed to the unitiated.&quot; Sounds  like a secret to me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This is all quite interesting! But I really find it difficult to believe
that Kate  intended any of these things as symbols. She's not *that* scholarly.
I think they're  just a description of what Kate's back yard is like. 
</P>
<P>The rose, on the other had, I definitely think is a symbol, because it
sticks out so  much as being a symbol. 
</P>
<P>&quot;From Barbara Walker's &quot;The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and
Secrets&quot;, the  white rose or lily was a sign of the Virgin Goddess.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Is that only white lilies or all lilies? If the lily is a symbol of
innocence, then the  line &quot;You crush the lily in my soul&quot; in &quot;Moving&quot;
finaly makes sense to me. &quot;Moving&quot;  is about the dancer Lindsay Kemp,
who inspired Kate's strong interest in dance and  movement. Lindsay Kemp is gay,
though, and it appears that &quot;Moving&quot; is a love song  to Lindsay, who
can't return her love in the same way because he is gay. 
</P>
<P>The line &quot;You crush the lily in my soul&quot; could then mean, &quot;You
stir passion in  me&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Later, Christians transferred both of these symbolic flowers to the
Virgin Mary  and called her the Holy Rose. In none of the sources I plowed
through did I find any  connection between the white rose and death. 
</P>
<P>From what I have been able to determine, a white rose can be a symbol for 
several different things: death, virginity, purity, innocence, and friendship.
White  roses are &quot;friendship&quot; roses. They are also, I am told, the
only thornless roses. They  are also used at funerals a lot. 
</P>
<P>In some places, the color white, rather than black, is considered the color
of  death. Kate must be aware of this -- look how strongly the color white plays
in the  Dutch video for the song &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. 
</P>
<P>It seems to me that in &quot;Under the Ivy&quot; the white rose is
simultaneously a symbol  for death, innocence, and friendship. It seems to me
very likely that the song is  about the contemplation of suicide and the song is
addressed to Death, but it could  also be that Kate is just sad about a dear
friend who is dead, whose grave is in her  back yard, and she wants
understanding company. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Everything I read dealt with the virgin while the red rose is the sign
of *life*  and the flow of menstrual blood. alker also mentions The Rose, a
traditional  Mummers' dance/ritual that was performed to celebrate death and
resurrection.  Could this be the party reference?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Actually, I think the party symbolizes life, or perhaps modern day life. &quot;Away
 from the party&quot;. Away from the problems and triviality of modern day life.

</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not going to venture forth with a definite answer as I've been
wrong so  many times before; however, there is a heavy dose of mythos in the
song which is  certainly the key to *something*.&quot; 
</P>
<P>.... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Women have been burnt as witches simply because they were beautiful.&quot;

Subject: A theory that has nothing to do with Gaffa or &quot;...Tenner&quot; 
</P>
<P>Has anyone come up with a literary origin for &quot;Under the Ivy?&quot; I
might have  something here. Being a fan of children's books (it's amazing how a
story can be  entertaining without obscenity or sex in these times), I've been
reading The Secret  Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, on of those classics I
somehow missed as a  child. Anyway, for those who don't know the story, it's
about 2 lonely, ill, fretful  children who find a secret garden and through the
magic of actually finding  something to care for, become healthy and reasonably
nice kids after all. The door to  the garden (a ROSE garden) is hidden UNDER THE
IVY. 
</P>
<P>I'm still working on this idea.

</P>
<P> Please continue, Auntie Lizoo. IED is crazy for Frances Hodgson Burnett,
but  never thought of going back to the text to look for such direct
connections. Great  idea, and a good possibility. There is at least one
reference to another subject, as  well, however.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Re: The Secret Garden
</P>
<P> Also incidentally, at least one newish Love-Hound has asked, &quot;Why
white roses,  and why the ivy?&quot; or words to that effect. The answer is to
be found in a relatively  obscure Kate Bush song, the b-side of the Running Up
That Hill single. The song is  called Under the Ivy, and is (debatably, of
course) one of the greatest pieces of  recorded sound in the history of mankind.
In it Kate sings: &quot;Go into the  garden,/Under the ivy,/Under the leaves./Go
right to the rose./Go right to the  white rose/For me.&quot; (Of course this
could alternatively read &quot;White Rose&quot;, but  that's another story...)
Hence the idea to send Kate white roses and ivy for  Katemas. We may be
relatively certain that Love-Hounds is neither the first nor the  last entity to
send such a token of love and affection to Kate, but it's still a  thoroughly
appropriate and sincere way to show our feelings for her on Katemas, so  why
not?

<P> Judi asked what is Under the Ivy ? It's a simple ballad by Kate, a b-side
from  the The Big Sky single. IED should say &quot;deceptively simple&quot;,
though--it is actually  very subtle, and has a secret subtext. Love-Hounds have
sent Kate white roses on  Katemas (and at the recent convention) for the last
two or three years, in reference  to this song and its &quot;secret&quot;

<P>Hi all, 
</P>
<P>I just got back from an interesting lunch. We were talking about Valentines'
Day  coming up soon and I said that it would be a sad day since it'll be the
first  anniversary of Hanna Bush's death. I told my mate that it'll be a sad day
for KT. He  said that I ought to send her a white rose. I was dumbfounded since
I didn't think  he knew much about KT, especially about a song like 'Under The
Ivy'. You know  what I mean, most of her fans who know her songs well will send
her white roses if  they send any kind of flowers. 
</P>
<P>He then explained that the traditional meaning of a white rose is death.
Sort of  throws a new slant on 'Under the Ivy' doesn't it (or have I just missed
that all  these years).

Subject: The Handsome Cabin Boy 
</P>
<P>Kate's new import twelve-inch single has been available in the U.S. for more
 than a week now, so I trust you have all run out and bought it, so that you
have  every note KB has ever put down on vinyl. But for those errant few who do
not have  it yet or who have not researched it's entire history, I will tell you
about it. 
</P>
<P>The A side contains a totally new version of the song &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;.
It is  *not* a remix, but a totally new version called &quot;Alternate Hounds Of
Love&quot;. It is so  different from the original, you could even say it's a new
song. The drum beat is  similar and it has the cellos chugging away, but the
melody and lyrics are different. It  is better than the original, musically,
though the lyrics are more in the extended  remix vein. The background vocals
border on the silly (even more so than on the  original), but someohow the
sillyness fits perfectly and it sounds great. 
</P>
<P>The B-side contains the album version of &quot;Jig Of Life&quot; and a new
song &quot;The  Handsome Cabin Boy&quot;. &quot;The Handsome Cabin Boy&quot; is
a traditional dirty sea chantey,  and Kate sings it a cappela in her best
Scottish accent. Throughout there is a  haunting chorus of Kates in the
background droning a continuous two notes that are  a fifth apart. This is
really neat not only because it sounds *really* intense, but also  because this
is what bag pipes do. Bag pipes have three pipes. The pitch of one of  the pipes
can be controlled, but the other two pipes always play the same two notes  which
are a fifth apart. 
</P>
<P>I have known for a while that Kate Bush was introduced to music as a kid by 
singing dirty sea chanteys with her brothers, and I find it strange that a dirty
sea  chantey now appears on her record. When I interviewed Kate, one of the
questions I  was going to ask if I had the time was if she would be willing to
sing one of the  dirty sea chanteys she sang as a kid. And now one is on her
record! In any case, I  have heard the song &quot;The Handsome Cabin Boy&quot;
before. In fact, I heard it on a tape  of a radio show done about five years ago
where KB was guest DJ. HCB was one of  the songs she played, and she said it's
an &quot;absolutely classic story&quot;. It was peformed  by A. L. Loyd and
Euwan McCall. I'm told that has also been performed by Gordon  Bok. 
</P>
<P>These are the lyrics as Kate sings them: 
</P>
<P>It's of a pretty female as you may understand <BR> Her mind been bent for
rambling into some foreign land <BR> She dressed herself in sailor's clothes,
or so it does appear <BR> And she hired with a captain to serve him for a year 
</P>
<P>Her cheeks they were like roses and her hair all in a curl <BR> The sailors
often smiled and said he looked just like a girl <BR> But eating all the
captain's biscuit her colour did destroy <BR> And the waist did swell of pretty
Nell, the handsome cabin boy 
</P>
<P>It was in the Bay of Biscay her gallant ship did plow <BR> One night among
the sailors was a fearful floorin' row <BR> They tumbled from their hammocks,
for their sleep it did destroy <BR> And they swarmed about the groanin' of the
handsome cabin boy 
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh doctor, dear. Oh doctor,&quot; the cabin boy did cry <BR> &quot;The
time has come -- I am undone, and I will surely die&quot; <BR> The doctor come
a'runnin' and a'smilin' at their fun --<BR> To think a sailor lad should have a
daughter or a son 
</P>
<P>The sailors when they saw the joke, they all did stand and stare <BR> The
child belonged to none of them, they solemnly did swear <BR> And the captain's
wife she says to him, &quot;My dear I wish you joy <BR> For 'tis either you or
me's betrayed the handsome cabin boy&quot;  [the end] 
</P>
<P>There are two verses to the song which Kate has left out. One is the second 
verse: 
</P>
<P>The captain's wife she being on board, she seem-ed in great joy <BR> To see
her husband had engaged such a handsome cabin boy <BR> And now and then she'd
slip in a kiss, and she would have liked to toy <BR> But it was the captain
found out the secret of the handsome cabin boy <BR> [end of second verse] 
</P>
<P>The other is the last verse: 
</P>
<P>Then each man took his tot of rum, and drunk success to trade <BR> And
likewise to the cabin boy, who was neither man nor maid <BR> Here's hopin' the
wars don't rise again, our sailors to destroy <BR> And here's hoping for a
jolly lot more like the handsome cabin boy <BR> [end of last verse]

<P>lagan also ligan or lagend -- n. Cargo or equipment thrown into the sea but 
attached to a float or buoy so that it can be recovered.

<P>Sounds reasonable to me, though I haven't yet sat down and transcribed and

<P>MY LAGAN LOVE 
</P>
<P>When rainy nights are soft with tears  And Autumn leaves are falling  I hear
his voice on tumbling waves  And no one there to hold me  At evening's fall he
watched me walk  His heart was mine  But my love was young and felt  The world
was not cruel, but kind 
</P>
<P>Where Lagan's light fell on the hour  I saw him far below me  Just as the
morning calmed the storm  With no one there to hold him  My loves have come, my
loves have gone  And nothing's left to warn me  Save for a voice on the
traveling wind  And the glimpse of a face at morning 
</P>
<P>What can one say?

</P>
<P>I checked into this too, but I think the medieval meaning of the word might
be a  little more in line with the song. According to the dictionary I dug up, &quot;lagan&quot;
comes  from the Middle French &quot;lagan&quot; and the Medieval Latin &quot;laganum&quot;
meaning &quot;debris  washed up from the sea&quot;. Perhaps the word &quot;lagan&quot;
exists in modern French with  this same meaning? Kate would've known it then, I
suspect. 
</P>
<P>To me this makes more sense, unless someone really did take her for a
bouy...

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: Not This Time
</P>
<P>In reference to recent inexplicable comments published recently regarding &quot;Not
 This Time&quot;: 
</P>
<P>first of all I must state flatly that this track sounds absolutely nothing
like  &quot;Journey&quot;. Second, it is extremely similar both in terms of
production and song  structure to Kate's other anthem-style Hounds of Love
b-side, &quot;Burning Bridge&quot;. I  assume that these two recordings sound so
much alike because they represent  Kate's quickest and least polished new &quot;demo&quot;
style of recording, done in her new  studio with the core of her band and a very
fast, OTT over-dubbing of her own  voice in the huge final choruses. 
</P>
<P>The recording is nevertheless completely unlike anything heard on commercial
 radio, not only in the strange melodic twists in verse and bridge, but in the 
disquieting hysteria of the final choruses, as well. Doug has reacted
unexpectedly to  new Kate Bush material in the past, as with &quot;RUTH&quot;; I
am surprised that he hasn't  learned that her music often demands a slow
assimilation by the listener over time,  but that such time is invariably well
spent. This is not to say that either &quot;Burning  Bridge&quot; or &quot;Not
This Time&quot; are crucial parts of the KB oeuvre; only that heated and 
irrational references to &quot;Journey&quot; are as unwarranted in one case as
in the other.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: If not this time, then
when will you capitulate? 
</P>
<P>&gt; Well, sure the vocals are distinctly Kate, and add some value to the
song, and  there is elephantotic distortion on the guitar that Journey would
never use, but in  general it has the melodic, rhythmic, and over-produced
characteristic (you know,  the way that lots of instruments all merge to create
a muddled wash that is so  common in Journeyish AOR pop) of American corporate
rock. 
</P>
<P>This is, after all, a matter of opinion, and I am trying to remember that,
but  really! The stylistic similarities between &quot;Burning Bridge&quot; and &quot;Not
This Time&quot; are  clearly audible--far more audible than the similarities
which you claim exist between  &quot;Not This Time&quot; and American corporate
rock (good term). Of course the vocals are  &quot;distinctly Kate&quot;, but
what's more significant is *how* they are distinctly Kate. One  thing many
listeners notice when listening to, say, the final epic (and, by your 
definition, apparently, &quot;over-produced&quot;) choruses of &quot;The Big Sky&quot;
is the abandon,  the deliberate throwing away of technical controls in Kate's
vocals. 
</P>
<P>A similar liberated singing style can be heard in a more understated form in
&quot;The  Morning Fog&quot;. But this kind of singing is much more obvious in &quot;Burning
Bridge&quot;  and &quot;Not This Time&quot;, and it does not, I argue, appear
before the new album. Beyond  that, the whole concept of structuring a song with
the overwhelming emphasis on a  long closing sequence of choruses sung by Kate's
voice many times over-dubbed,  and consisting of &quot;tiddle-ee-ohs&quot; or
some such traditional folk phonetics in the  tradition of &quot;tra-la-la&quot;,
is distinctive of these new Hounds of Love songs. Just think  of the background
vocals in &quot;Alternate Hounds&quot; and you can see immediately how  similar
they are to the chorus in &quot;Not This Time&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, such a concept, and such use of phonetic choruses, are not only
 absent in Boston or Journey or Foreigner or Styx --they are completely
antithetical  to the musical principles (or absence of same) espoused by those
bands. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, if I were obliged to find similarities between the song and the
 music of any of those bands, I *would* single out the guitar --despite the  &quot;elephantotic
distortion&quot;, the introduction of such guitar in the last choruses is a 
staple of commercial American rock. I might also cite Kate's use of the popular 
endearment &quot;baby&quot;; but this word cropped up in &quot;Running Up That
Hill&quot; without  condemning the song as a sellout to &quot;Journey&quot;. As
to rhythm, there I'll agree with  you that its links with mainstream rock are
strong, but not so strong that the closest  musical parallel to &quot;Not This
Time&quot; must be &quot;Journey&quot;. The rhythms of rock have  always been
extremely limited, and the differences between a brilliant, adventurous  rock
rhythm and a dull, unoriginal one can usually be traced to slight changes in 
emphasis of a beat and alterations of tuning, miking and recording techniques. 
</P>
<P>Finally, in response to your contention that &quot;Not This Time&quot;
shares melodic  characteristics with &quot;Journey&quot;, well, I'm baffled.
There are so many beautiful details  of melody, both as written and as
interpreted, which are unique to &quot;Not This Time&quot;,  and which place it
so firmly within Kate's native English musical tradition, that I am  at a loss
to understand how they can all have failed to meet your notice.

<P>I've transcribed the lyrics to &quot;Not This Time&quot;, which is the
B-side to &quot;The Big  Sky&quot; single. You might remember that I have
thought this song pretty yucky. Well, in  transcribing the lyrics, I have had to
listen to it a lot, and I have to say that I have  after all become rather fond
of it. I still think that the arrangement sucks (especially  the guitar), but
the vocals are so emotionally powerful that I can at times overlook  that. Here

<P>IED was greatly enlightened by Doug's transcription of &quot;Not This Time&quot;
when he  originally posted it. However, the one line which IED still hears very
differently  from Doug happens to be the one which you, Mark, signed off with
yesterday. In  fact, IED is relatively certain that the line &quot;I don't know
why I build a mountain&quot; is  wrong. First, the syllable interpreted as &quot;build&quot;
does not start with a 'b' sound but  with a 'g', IED believes. Second, the word
&quot;mountain&quot; sounds more like &quot;my door&quot;  to this listener.
Which leads to IED's hesitant suggestion of &quot;I don't know why I  give him
my door&quot; -- which, of course, makes no sense at all. But &quot;build&quot;
and  &quot;mountain&quot; just aren't there, as far as IED can tell. As for &quot;Delius&quot;,
it's really only  the &quot;Latin&quot; lines that still elude everyone. The
thing is, they may not be Latin at all,  but English. Any ideas?

<P>Could *this* be &quot;insensitive&quot;? If so, the &quot;in-&quot; is very
soft, but that's what I hear.  Looking at the song as a whole, I vote for &quot;insensitive&quot;.
Look at the singer and the  singee. The singee thinks that the singer doesn't
care. The singer admits to caring  to the point of self-exclusion (i.e., caring
too much for the singer and not enough for  herself).

me going, you keep the shit away 
</P>
<P>This is the only line that gives me trouble. I agree that the above line
sounds  right, but something bugs me about it. The singer seems to be at odds
with the  person she's singing to. She's getting such a kick at telling him that
she's standing  up for herself and not giving in. I have trouble with her saying
that he keeps the shit  away. Her attitude seems to be that he is the *cause* of
any shit that might be  bothering her.

<P>On the other hand, she also says &quot;Every time you're near, I feel you,

<P>Kate Bush Complete is the title of a new and long-promised book that has
finally  been published by EMI/IMP Books. It is a collection of &quot;all&quot;
of Kate's songs  published to date. 
</P>
<P>... and it even solves a few &quot;mysteries&quot;. 
</P>
<P>In &quot;Not This Time&quot; both Doug Alan and IED seem to have been wrong
about the  words in the second verse. According to this new book, the lines are:

</P>
<P>I don't know why I give in but I do every time <BR> And here I am wondering
why I did it again <BR> Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh <BR> That's what I say <BR> It
keeps me going and it keeps the ship away 
</P>
<P>I have not yet, however, entirely accepted the above transcription. There
are a  number of errors that can be confirmed in other songs as published in
this book,  which indicate either that Kate was not consulted about every detail
of the lyrics to  be printed or that she didn't inspect every detail too
carefully when she had the  chance. No specific information is given about how
close the Bushes' involvement  was with this project. 
</P>
<P>But looking at this new lyric, IED can't help suspecting that &quot;ship&quot;
is a  euphemism on the part of the editors. There's no reason for using &quot;ship&quot;
in the  context of this song, none at all, that IED can see. On the other hand,
&quot;shit&quot; makes  absolutely perfect sense in the verse, echoing almost
exactly the meaning of the first  phrase in the same line (&quot;It keeps me
going&quot;). So you be the judge. MarK, Doug and  the rest of the Loyal
Lionhearts, IED awaits your opinions with great interest.

<P>&quot;Not this Time&quot; 
</P>
<P>Doug Alan insists I have the last line of the vocal wrong: 
</P>
<P>&gt; It's &quot;C'mon, we all SING&quot; -- not &quot;C'mon, we all sin&quot;!

</P>
<P>Having not been alone in hearing it my way, and being still uncertain based
on  the vocal itself, I am tempted to be stubborn here, but in fact, on
song-structure  grounds, Doug's version IS more plausible and I accept
correction. The line does  effect a transition from the lyric to the choral
finale, and it is quite natural that we  all be enlisted to join in. 
</P>
<P>To me this is Kate singing very directly and personally out of the deep 
ambivalence she feels in relationships. The &quot;baby&quot; addressed seems to
me to be an  individual man, men in general, her audience, heaven and destiny; &quot;not
this time&quot;  means not tonight, not this time in our lives, but maybe also
not this lifetime, not this  world. &quot;To the A, to the O&quot; I take to be
Alpha and Omega (omega is &quot;the O that's  bursting,&quot; descriptive of the
Greek letter), an ancient catholic liturgical image that  she would have met
every year in childhood at a particularly dramatic moment in the  ritual for the
Easter vigil mass, representing this whole creation as made total in  Christ. 
</P>
<P>&quot;What chance do I have to be here? Put an end to every dream.&quot;
Does the &quot;you&quot;  who draws near and lets her forget herself console
her? Or is it the same as &quot;baby,&quot;  so that she is constantly caught
between some 'true' self she would keep to herself  and the self that gets
caught up in relationships? The title line, at any rate, is sung  with a very
affecting complexity of emotion--strong decisiveness mixed with  anguished
regret. 
</P>
<P>This at any rate is the take on the song that made &quot;c'mon, we all sin!&quot;
seem to  make sense to me, as a wise, human resolution that lets her keep on
going. Allow  me to invoke it one last time, before I let go of it as my error.

</P>
<P>Among reasons I persisted in this mis-hearing is that I included it--along
with  this account of the A and the O--in a letter to Kate, to which she
replied, letting it  stand. This is probably simply her courtesy, or that
together with the delight she  takes in enticing people to hear their own things
in her lyrics.

and it keeps the ship away&quot; is really  &quot;...it keeps the shit away&quot;
are silly - if that's what she'd said, really, she would have  published it. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Kate didn't prepare the book, so your argument is pretty tenuous. The
lyric is  obviously &quot;shit&quot; -- not &quot;ship&quot;. First of all, it
sounds like &quot;shit&quot; -- not &quot;ship&quot;. Secondly,  what the hell
would &quot;to keep the ship away&quot; mean? 
</P>
<P>Asked about 'control' in Rolling Stone, Kate says you *have* to be in
control,  &quot;otherwise people will shit you right and left.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate always sounds like herself.

<BR> Subject: NTT 
</P>
<P>Larry Hernandez mentioned--and Ed Suranyi quickly put it right--the version
of  the line from &quot;Not This Time&quot; printed in KBComplete that uses the
word &quot;ship&quot; for  one reason or another. What I found interesting in
Larry's post of actual lyrics for  the B-sides from the JPN BOX was that it
confirms the more general fact, that  those lyrics seem likely to have come from
either KBComplete or from wherever IT  got them. And my question is: anybody
know? 
</P>
<P>To stay with the particular song &quot;Not This Time,&quot; about which
there was some  correspondence that I provoked more than a year ago, the thing
that interests me  about the line as Larry cites it is not at all just the
(totally obvious and in no way  unlikely) actual next-to-last word of the line
but the fact that in other ways it plainly  is not a transcription of the
performed lyric. The whole line is SUNG &quot;To keep me  going and to keep the
shit away,&quot; which is in other ways as well from KBComplete. 
</P>
<P>A question and a project: Q. Are we to presume that KBComplete or JPN BOX 
have consulted, say, the published sheet music? Or are their lyrics too based on
&quot;best  takes&quot; on an admittedly difficult song? Project: in either
case, what lyrics do those of  us who are participating in an edition of the
B-sides lyrics want to use? If (through  some consensus) we should agree that
what Novercia published and what Kate sings  differ, what do we do? If, in fact,
it is down to our ears finally, then the potential for  extent texts to be
mistaken seems to produce a responsibility. 
</P>
<P>Since it is no longer just my own transcription, but benefits from
KBComplete as  well as particular corrections from Doug Alan the other year, and
ALSO because  'ship' aside, I can make no sense of the available lyrics anyway,
which seem to differ  significantly all over the place from what I hear, allow
me to share my *draft*  (please) of the best version I have come up with. To me,
it seems emotionally far  more coherent than the printed version--but it differs
in logically consequential ways  ('sensitive', not 'insensitive'; 'feel you',
not 'fear you'), and I would value  comment.

<BR> Subject: Not This Time 
</P>
<P>Vickie here. I tried to find my original post about NTT but couldn't find
it. As  long as the subject is fairly current, I'd like to jump in again with my
interpretation,  mainly because to me it's a song with a very important social
and emotional  message. 
</P>
<P>IMHO, it's a song about a battered woman who can't seem to break away from 
the husband/lover (?) who's treating her so badly. She finally comes to a
decision  that she must make the break to save herself. 
</P>
<P>As with most Katesongs, we have to fill in our own details on background 
information and situations. The lyrics I hear are slightly different from either
Peter  Manchester's or Kate Bush Complete. 
</P>
<P> Not This Time 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>&gt; Oh with a mind that renders everything (in)sensitive <BR> &gt; What
chance do I have here? 
</P>
<P>If the word is &quot;sensitive&quot; then she's talking about herself. She
is a person who  sees things in a gentle way and the relationship she's in
threatens to make her into a  hard and cynical person. If the word is &quot;insensitive&quot;
(which is what I hear), she's  talking about him, but the meaning is the same.
How can she remain true to her  gentle nature while she's with a man who doesn't
know the meaning of the word  &quot;gentle&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&gt; Put an end, put an end <BR> &gt; Put an end to every dream 
</P>
<P>She might as well forget any dreams she has of a decent and happy life as
long as  she's in this relationship. He's putting an end to all her dreams. 
</P>
<P>&gt; When you're near I fear you <BR> &gt; And I forget myself 
</P>
<P>The word is definitely &quot;fear&quot;..I hear it very clearly. Listen
closely to how she sings  the word. Quavering..the character is scared. She has
to forget all about herself and  become totally subservient when he's around, or
else she'll get beaten. Of course,  she might be abused no matter how she acts.

</P>
<P>&gt; Not this time baby <BR> &gt; Not this time <BR> &gt; Not this time
baby 
</P>
<P>She's trying to get up the courage to leave him for good. Here she's still a
bit  timid and unsure, though the second &quot;baby&quot; has a slight hard edge
to it. Almost cold  and calculating. 
</P>
<P>&gt; I dunno why I give in but I do every time <BR> &gt; And here I am
a'wondering why I did it again 
</P>
<P>She's always given in to his demands, she's always been meek and she's
always  gone back to him. For the first time she's questioning what's wrong with
her that  she can't stand up for her own rights. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh <BR> &gt; Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh <BR> &gt;
Toor-ee-ohhhhh must I say <BR> &gt; To keep me going, to keep the shit away 
</P>
<P>This Irish phrase is sort of a personal mantra. Perhaps it reminds her of
good  times in the past. Probably from before she met this jerk! 
</P>
<P>&gt; I don't know what it is <BR> &gt; Every time you're near <BR> &gt; I
fear you <BR> &gt; And I forget myself <BR> &gt; No, not this time baby <BR> &gt;
Not this time you won't <BR> &gt; Not this time <BR> &gt; Not this time
darling 
</P>
<P>He'll never abuse her again, she's finally made up her mind. She's finally
gotten  up the courage to leave him and start her life anew. The relief in her
voice is  apparent and the shouts of jubilation are almost chilling in their
intensity. 
</P>
<P>&gt; C'mon, we all sing 
</P>
<P>Simple lyrics don't convey all that's going on in the last half of the song.
Her  voice gets stronger and more confident, and there are lots of voices
swirling about.  Actually, sometimes I hear the shouts of jubilation at the end
as screams of insanity  and a possible alternate interpretation is that she
can't stand his beatings and abuse  anymore and kills him in a fit of passionate
self-preservation. The line &quot;Not this time  you won't&quot; supports this.
Who knows? Maybe Kate saw The Burning Bed right  before writing this song. 
</P>
<P>Whatever, it's way too short and I love it.

<BR> Subject: &quot;Not This Time&quot;/over and out 
</P>
<P>It was great to hear from Vickie Sunday (April 28), who has been in some
danger  of dwindling to a legend while she and Chris don't have regular network
access. As  always, her account of her take on &quot;Not This Time&quot; is an
important contribution, and  I appreciate the help. I'm aware that this is not
everybody's favorite song, but I'll  admit to feeling some vindication in
discovering that she has taken it seriously too. 
</P>
<P>It is sound method to test one's version of a lyric against an
interpretation of the  song, and in general I find hers successful. 
</P>
<P>&gt;IMHO, it's a song about a battered woman who can't seem to break away
from  the husband/lover (?) who's treating her so badly. She finally comes to a
decision  that she must make the break to save herself. 
</P>
<P> I feel it's too strong to take the person in the lyric to be a battered
woman (or  even necessarily a woman), but certainly the song addresses a
conflicted love and the  difficulty of extricating oneself from it. I don't
think the &quot;fear you&quot; needs to be  taken as physical fear; for me it is
more evocative if it is about the power of a love  that has become obsessive or
non-reciprocal to be crushing or stifling for oneself. 
</P>
<P>Whatever the interpretation, Vickie's efforts with the song have put us a
position  to decide on the authentic lyrics as sung. I continue to think that
has importance  beyond this particular instance. So: to be done with this one,
first I write the three  versions in circulation, with judgments about their
differences; then I write the  version those judgments suggest. I give them
parallel formats for comparison. In the  few places where the evidence is not
yet clear to my own ears, I adopt a  two-out-of-three prevails rule. 
</P>
<P>[Vickie's version] .......... [KBCOMPLETE's version] .......... [My version,
recent post] 
</P>
<P>NOT THIS TIME ............... NOT THIS TIME ........................ NOT
THIS TIME 
</P>
<P>Oh with a mind that ..... Oh with a mind that ............ Oh with the mind
that 
</P>
<P>renders everything ..... renders everything ............. renders everything

</P>
<P>(in)sensitive ................ insensitive ..........................

</P>
<P>What chance do I have ...	What chance do I have ... What chance do I have to

</P>
<P>here? ........................... here
......................................be here 
</P>
<P> It's &quot;a&quot; mind; 'with a' and 'with the' are very close, but 'a' is
more natural.  It's also &quot;do I have here&quot;; I was misled by the fact
that the here is pronounced  almost as two syllables--hee-ere. As to
sensitive/insensitive, it's up for grabs.  KBCOMPLETE prints sensitive in the
lyrics section, insensitive in the music; Vickie  can't call it, but points out
it works with her interpretation either way. I am going to  stay with my
version, attributing it to the singer, not the other. At most there is a 
continuation of the glottal 'ng' of 'everything', not a new syllable. 
</P>
<P>Put an end, put an end ........ Put an end Put an end ............ Put an
end, put an end 
</P>
<P>Put an end to every dream .. Put an end to every dream .. Put an end to

near I feel 
</P>
<P>you ....................................... you
........................................ you 
</P>
<P>And I forget myself .............. And I forget myself ................ And
I forget myself 
</P>
<P> OK, two to one in favor of 'fear', and I'll go with it. But only because it
is more  clear in the next stanza, and consistency is to be expected. I still
can't stop hearing  'feel' here. 
</P>
<P>Not this time baby ......... But not this time baby ............ Not this

<P>The last reprise of &quot;Not this time&quot; is backup vocals, not lead.

</P>
<P>why I did it again ................. why I did it again ...................

</P>
<P> It isn't &quot;I did it again&quot;; it's &quot;I'm doing it again.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh ............. Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh ............
Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh

<P>Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh ............. Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh ............

<P>To keep me going, to keep ....... It keeps me going and it ........ To keep
me going and to 
</P>
<P>the shit away ............................ keeps the ship away .............
keep the shit away 
</P>
<P>Vickie is right that there is a final &quot;toor-ee-oh,&quot; but then it's &quot;that's
what I say,&quot;  with the 'what I say' thrown by very quickly. Vickie and I
agree against  KBCOMPLETE that it's &quot;TO keep,&quot; etc., but she misses
the &quot;and,&quot; which is very  distinct. 
</P>
<P>I don't know what it is ............. I don't know what it is .............
I don't know what it is 
</P>
<P>Every time you're near ...... But every time you're near ......... Every

<P>I fear you ............................ I fear you

<P>No, not this time baby ......... No not this time baby ................. No,

</P>
<P>Not this time you won't ....... Not this time you won't ............... Not
this time out 
</P>
<P>Not this time ....................... Not this time darling
.................... Not this time 
</P>
<P>Not this time darling ........... Not this time 
</P>
<P> Vickie is alone in being right on this passage. The &quot;darling&quot; is
a stunning growling  howl, easy to miss as a word. 
</P>
<P>C'mon, we all sing .......... C'mon we all sing ............ C'mon, we all
sing 
</P>
<P>(Refrain) ........................... (Refrain) ..........................
(Refrain) 
</P>
<P> Integrating the results, what follows strikes me as presentable for a
definitive  version of the lyrics for this song: 
</P>

Marvick, Ed  Suranyi, Larry DeLuca&gt;

Subject: Lyrics to &quot;Burning Bridge&quot;
</P>
<P>These are the lyrics to Kate's two new songs as heard by the semi-reliable
ears  of Doug Alan: 
</P>
<P>BURNING BRIDGE 
</P>
<P>Oh, come close to me <BR> Come cross the bridge <BR> I need to know what
you have to say to me <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> What have
you got to say to me? <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> Tell me
all about it <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> Tell me please
<BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> Woe, I know <BR> I know what
works for me <BR> So cross the bridge <BR> The burning bridge <BR> With
friends behind us <BR> From the line <BR> It's you and me, baby, against the
world <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> I got to know what you
have to say <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> What have you got to
say? <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> Ooooooh <BR> (We've been
waiting all night long) <BR> I got to get close now <BR> (We've been waiting
all night long) <BR> Tell me all about it <BR> (We've been waiting all night
long) <BR> All night long <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> All
night long <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> It works for me <BR>
It's you and me, baby <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> Against
the world <BR> All night long <BR> It works for me <BR> Let's cross the
bridge <BR> Oh, I know <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> I know I
know <BR> (We've been waiting all night long) <BR> All night long <BR> It's
you and me, baby <BR> I said &quot;works for me&quot; <BR> It's all right
<BR> It's you and me, baby <BR> Against the world! 
</P>
<P>It sure seems like this might have been written for the HoL side of HoL. It
seems  to be about overcoming depression by becoming intimate with someone. In
some  ways the lyrics remind me of Kate's earliest recorded song &quot;Passing
Through Air&quot;  (1973) only more desperate: &quot;Passing through air, you
mix the stars with your arms/  Walking through here, the doom of eternity balms&quot;.
