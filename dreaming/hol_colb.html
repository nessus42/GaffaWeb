</P>
<P>A new KBC Newsletter was received by IED today, and he forthwith relays news
 of the utmost importance to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>First and foremost, Kate has recorded a vocal of the title song to Terry
Gilliam's  film &quot;Brazil&quot;. Although it was not in the film itself, it
does appear on the album. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, any L-H who has not seen &quot;Brazil&quot; is strongly
advised to do so  without delay. When IED saw it (twice in a row) in Paris last
year he was  overwhelmed, and could see its affinity to Kate's work in countless
details.

<P>`Yeah, I went to Comic Relief. The comics weren't too good, but the music
was  pretty satisfactory. Howard Jones was a little limp, but Kate Bush was
amazing!  From what I understand, she did different numbers each of the three

<P>I talked to Peter Morris, the editor of &quot;Homeground: The International
Kate Bush  Fanzine&quot;, on the phone today, and he told me that he saw the
Friday Comic Aid  thing. He said Kate performed one song, &quot;Breathing&quot;,
alone on an electric piano (the  very same kind Peter Gabriel used to do &quot;Here
Comes The Flood&quot; on Kate's '79  Xmas special). At first, she seemed pretty
nervous (this is probably the first time  she's performed live since The
Prince's Trust benefit in '83), but soon became  more confident and did a
wonderful job. Peter Morris was surprised to hear that she  did something
different on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>Joe, did you get any info out of this friend in England what kind of
arrangement  she did with &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;The Big Sky&quot;.

<P>We're sorry we couldn't let you all know the details of Kate's part in the
Comic  Relief shows, but everything happened so fast. In fact Kate performed
BREATHING  live (very live in fact) and also performed a comic duet with Rowan
Atkinson. The  highlights from the shows can be seen on BBC1 on 25th April --
but we don't know  how far Kate will feature in this. A live LP of the shows is

</P>
<P>Thanks, Doug. I hope this gets through. So flustered now I haven't got much 
new to say, but I'll be making up for that soon. Just got my copy of the new 
Newsletter (#18 by my count). Major production values in the past two issues,
but  also an unfortunate absence of interview sections, such as appeared in
earlier issues.  Also missed by me are the contributions of fans, which were
common during the  first two years. Although I follow the discussion on early
vs. late Simple Minds et al.,  I will comment only on matters KT, since that
subject frequently seems in danger of  being omitted altogether from daily
digests. 
</P>
<P>The latest issue of Record Mirror (I think) included a snap of Kate
performing a  duet with some young comedian (a Young One, perhaps? I ask
ignorantly) during the  Comic Relief show. Apparently there will not only be a
BBC edited broadcast of the  show (who knows how much of KT will be included),
but a live LP as well. Kate  performed &quot;a very live&quot; Breathing,
whatever that means.

</P>
<P>KT update: The guy's name is Rowan Atkinson. If that rings a bell with
anyone,  could he/she explain? Kate sang &quot;Breathing&quot; solo,
accompanying herself on the  piano. She indicated that she had no song about
hunger, but felt that the theme of  &quot;Breathing&quot; was related in spirit;
then sang a &quot;very silly&quot; duet with &quot;lots of naughty  words&quot;.
The live Comic Relief album is scheduled for release on Monday (a rush  release
if ever there was one, since the shows date from April 4 or so), and it is my 
understanding that both of Kate's contributions will be included. It is
immensely  re-assuring to know that everyone who reads this agrees upon the
incalculable  importance which this news bears on our lives.

<BR> Date: Tue, 29 Apr 86 00:46:57 mdt <BR> Subject: Who is Rowan Atkinson? 
</P>
<P>&gt; KT update: The guy's name [with whom Kate sang at Comic Relief UK] is 
Rowan Atkinson. If that rings a bell with anyone, could he/she explain? 
</P>
<P>Rowan Atkinson is one of the members of &quot;Not The Nine O'Clock News&quot;,
a  now-defunct (I believe) British satire program which, incidentally, was the 
inspiration for HBO's &quot;Not Necessarily The News&quot;. &quot;NTNO'CN&quot;
is arguably a good  deal better than &quot;Not Necessarily. . .&quot;, which
says a lot. RA was responsible for the  many of the show's satire rock-videos,
including &quot;I Like Trucking&quot;, &quot;Ayatollah,  Don't Come Any Closer&quot;,
and the classic &quot;Nice Video, Shame About The Song&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Atkinson apparently has some background in both mime and music, so it's only
 natural that he and Kate pair up at Comic Relief UK. I would give a good deal
to get  my hands on a tape of that performance, as Kate is my favorite British
musician and  Atkinson is my favorite British comedian. 
</P>
<P>If you want to see more of Atkinson's stuff, &quot;Not&quot; can be found on
many PBS  stations. He also appeared in The Secret Policeman's Other Ball. Any
other &quot;jot&quot;  fans out there?

claims that Kate performed &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;The Big Sky&quot;

Every night she  performed &quot;Breathing&quot; alone at an electric piano, and
sung in the comedy duet. The  Comic Relief show broadcast on TV did not contain
&quot;Breathing&quot;, but it did contain  the duet. The Comic Relief record
does in fact contain both &quot;Breathing&quot; and the  duet.

</P>
<P>To change the subject.... 
</P>
<P>I bought the &quot;Comic Relief Utterly Utterly Rude Video Live&quot; video
a couple of  weeks ago. This (for those who don't know) is a video of the Comic
Relief charity  show KaTe appeared in 1986. It includes KaTe performing &quot;Breathing&quot;
on an electric  piano and also a comedy duet with Rowan Atkinson (of Blackadder
etc.) called &quot;Do  Bears Sha-la-la&quot;. Since I don't think anybody's done
it, I decided to have a go at  transcribing the lyrics. If somebody has, then at
least it improved my touch-typing... 
</P>
<P>The melody is a typical &quot;boring-70s-love-song-ballad&quot; sort of
tune, and both KaTe  and Rowan sing in an American crooning sort of voice, which
sounds quite unlike  KaTe's usual voice(s). The Curtis in Curtis/atkinson is (I
think) Richard Curtis, the  co-writer of the Blackadder comedies, which explains
a lot...

<P>The song is a haunting ballad that will send a shiver up your spine. It is

<P>Interviewed in Record Mirror, May 10, p. 27, Peter Gabriel was asked about 
Kate's work on his album, So. Here is the relevant passage, written by Mike 
Gardner: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't Give Up&quot; -- probably a future single and a duet with Kate
Bush --is a  look at relationships under the stresses and strains of
unemployment. The song  features allusions to the American dustbowl and has
gospel and country influences.  In fact, a country singer {NME alleges Dolly
Parton} was first mooted for the female  vocal until he {Gabriel} again picked
Bush -- a collaborator on &quot;Games Without  Frontiers&quot; and &quot;No Self
Control&quot; on his third album. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate did a great job. I'm a great fan of her singing and her voice. I
think she  sang on that track very differently to how she sings on her own
records -- in a very  sensitive way. There are similarities in the way we work.
She works as slowly as I do  -- with is reassuring.&quot;

<P>I just read two disgusting articles on Peter Gabriel and one on Kate Bush.
The  two articles on Peter Gabriel, one in Blitz and one in Melody Maker, were
both  written by this jerk named Jim Shelley. I realized they were by the same
person by  the inane writing style. In both the articles, he is extremely petty.
He spends most of  the time talking about how pathetic Peter is because when
Peter talks he pauses and  says &quot;er...&quot; a lot. The fact that he thinks
Kate Bush is &quot;our only genius&quot; does not  redeem him. In fact, his
articles seem like parodies of all those awful articles several  years back on
Kate Bush, where they spent all their time attacking her because  she'd say &quot;wow&quot;
and &quot;amazing&quot; all the time.

<P>One day this song came up when I was thinking about a friend of mine. He
went  through the same college as me and was having lots of pressures, doubts, 
frustrations. I don't mean to sound like a hypocrite but when I put myself in
his  position this song suddenly affected me very much; every word I could
identify with;  even the KB parts which I previously thought were too
long/repetitive all rang with  a simple truthfulness.

<P>And these are some reviews of &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;: 
</P>
<P>Melody Maker: The stand-out track is &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;... set
against his sombre  narrative... comes Kate Bush's imploring counterpoint,
begging him to believe in  himself the way his family and friends do. Her
fragile anguished performance gives  the piece almost unbearable emotional
impact... 
</P>
<P>Sounds: &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;, the worst song on the album, is a

in London 
</P>
<P>[from LH-lost+found --|&gt;oug]
</P>
<P>Kate Bush appeared on stage yesterday night (June 28th) during the Peter
Gabriel  concert to perform &quot;Don't give up&quot; with PG. 
</P>
<P>This was the last of four PG concerts at Earls Court in London. Although PG 
played pretty much the same set during these nights, he usually sang KT's parts 
himself. 
</P>
<P>Last night I think the audience was holding their breath when &quot;Don't
Give Up&quot;  started. The first part was sung by PG and when he came to KT
part we heard her  voice before the lights picked her up walking down the steps
to the center of the  stage. The whole stadium FREAKED OUT !! 
</P>
<P>They did the piece together, both seated at the steps of the stairs that
lead up to  the back of the stage. 
</P>
<P>There was some ad-libbing towards the end bit of the song, crowd goes
bananas  again, PG thanks KT and she dissapears backstage. 
</P>
<P>She later appeared at the close of the concert to line up with PG, the
musicians  and Youso N'dour's group. 
</P>
<P>What a surprise !! It was a great concert.

<P>Q. You also appeared at Peter Gabriel's live concert at Earls Court... 
</P>
<P>A. Yes, it was very much a last minute decision.. Peter had asked me and I
wasn't  sure if I was brave enough to perform unrehearsed in front of such a
large  crowd.. it is such a beautiful song to sing but the reception from the
audience was  overwhelming.. I couldn't hear what I was singing.. so if anyone
reading this was  there that night.. sorry if I was a bit out of tune and if you
were one of those  people.. thanks for an incredible experience, I don't think
I'll ever forget that  welcome. It was a fantastic concert and I am again very
honoured to have been  involved in Peter's work.

<P>Two days ago I happened to catch Up Close with Peter Gabriel on KFOG here in
 San Francisco. &quot;Happened&quot; is the right word since I misssed the first
15 minutes or  so. I began taping it because I had to do some other things. He
did mention Kate  Bush, but at that very moment the tape ended and I turned it
over. (ARGH!!!) I  didn't have the radio on at the time; it was just recording.
Perhaps some of you out  there heard the same program. If not, then here is what
I DID catch: 
</P>
<P>Host: &quot;The album [ So ] also features a beautifully stirring vocal from
Kate Bush  on `Don't Give Up'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>PG: &quot;I wasn't sure at first whether to have a man or... [End of tape]

</P>
<P>Chris here, 
</P>
<P>Someone else's post may beat this one but here goes: 
</P>
<P>Peter Gabriel guest-hosted Empty-Vee's 120 Minutes this evening. A string of
 guest hosts have replaced the hated Dave (insert nickname here) Kendall. This 
would be a Good Thing if the host had any input into the selection of the music,
but  sadly the host just introduces the same lame stuff that would be played
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>Returning from a break we were treated to a snippet of Peter's duet with our
 beloved, Don't Give Up . He had this to say about the experience of making this
 video, which consists entirely of one shot of Kate and Peter slowly rotating,
as they  hug and caress one another -
</P>
<P> &quot;Sometimes you really have to suffer when making videos. Kate Bush,
who you  just saw there, is believed to have an album out in late spring - and
if you believe  that you'll believe anything because she's actually one of the
artists who's slower  than I am, and it's reassuring to know that they exist.&quot;

</P>
<P> A few fun facts about this video; it was made by the groundbreaking team of
 Godley and Creme, formerly one half (the smart half) of 10cc. Godley and Creme,
 along with a couple of other directors like Tim Pope, lifted the music video
from the  morass of &quot;band-in-a-box&quot; that was MTV in the early 1980s. G&amp;C
had explored rapid  editing in the video to Rob Junklas' Boy's Town , and had
taken it to the extreme  in the video to Wang Chung's Everybody Have Fun Tonight
, editing on every single  frame. Realizing that they had wrung the art of
editing dry, G&amp;C decided to make  Don't Give Up without any edits at all.
One continuous shot, slowly zooming in and  back, with close-ups handled by
rotating the preformers. The result is moving and  simple, but the record
company, accustomed to rapid-fire editing and wiz-bang  effects were baffled. So
completely lost that they commisioned a *second* video  made from footage that
looks like an out-take from Fleetwood Mac's Gypsy . 
</P>
<P>If you look closely, you can see that, in order to hug Peter properly, Our
Kate is  standing on a *very discreet* box, almost but not quite, covered by her
long skirt.

</P>
<P>Those wishing to understand how Kate could associate herself with Go West, 
here is the most likely reason: Alan Murphy, a highly sought-after guitarist who
has  worked very very often with Kate over the years, is practically a third
member of  Go West, according to the duo. He co-wrote three of the songs on
their new LP. If  Murphy asked Kate to help with the record, Kate might very
well have agreed for  friendship's sake. 
</P>
<P>Kate's track on the LP, &quot;The King Is Dead&quot;, is the stylistic
exception from the  rest of the album's ultra-high-tech pop formula, being a &quot;slower,
jazzier&quot; ballad,  with percussion derived from a jazz-brush-on-snare-like
sound produced originally  by rubbing pants-legs together in a broom-closet.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: The Twa Magicians 
</P>
<P>Heeding a Love-Hounds request, IED has transcribed the lyrics to the old
Irish  folksong The Twa Magicians. Actually, this song has variants all over
Europe, and its  English and Irish versions are not the earliest. The following
version is the one that  Kate probably learned as a child, since it is the work
of A. L. &quot;Burt&quot; Lloyd, one of  the fathers of the English and Irish
folkmusic revival of our century, and a great  favourite of Kate's. IED
transcribed as well as he could from the recording of the  song by Martin Carthy
(the album, which also includes an a cappella rendition of  &quot;The Handsome
Cabin Boy&quot;, is called Martin Carthy with Dave Swarbrick, on Topic,  12 TS
340 --1977). 
</P>
<P>The Twa Magicians 
</P>
<P>A lady sits in her own front door <BR> As straight as a willow wand, <BR>
And by there come a lusty smith <BR> With a hammer in his hand, and he said 
</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well may stand you, lady fair <BR> All in your robe of red, <BR> But
come tomorrow at this same time <BR> I'll have you in me bed,&quot; and he said

</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Away, away, you coal-blacksmith, <BR> Would you do me this wrong?
<BR> To think to have me maidenhead <BR> That I have kept so long! 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd rather I was dead and cold <BR> And my body laid in my grave,
<BR> Than a husky, dusky coal-blacksmith <BR> Me maidenhead should have!&quot;

</P>
<P>So the lady she held up her hand, <BR> And she swore upon her soul, <BR>
That she'd not be the blacksmith's love <BR> For all of a box of gold. 
</P>
<P>But the blacksmith he held up his hand <BR> And he swore upon the Mass,
<BR> Saying &quot;I'll have you in me bed, young girl, <BR> For the half of
that and less. 
</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE 
</P>
<P>So the lady she turned into a dove <BR> And she flew up in the air, <BR>
But he became an old cock-pigeon <BR> And they flew pair and pair, crying 
</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So the lady she turned into a hare <BR> And she ran across the plain, <BR>
But he became a greyhound dog <BR> And he ran her down again, crying 
</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So she became a little mare <BR> As dark as the night was black, <BR> But
he became a golden saddle <BR> And he clung on to her back, crying 
</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So she became a hot griddle <BR> And he became a cake, <BR> And every move
that poor girl made <BR> The blacksmith was her make. 
</P>
<P>So she became a full-dress (?) ship <BR> And sailed upon the sea, <BR> But
he became a bold captain <BR> And aboard of her went he, crying 
</P>
<P>     Bide, lady, bide, <BR>      There's nowhere you can hide, <BR>     
For the lusty smith will be your love <BR>      And he will lay your pride. 
</P>
<P>So the lady she went into the bedroom <BR> And she changed into a bed,
<BR> But he became a green coverlet <BR> And he gained her maidenhead. 
</P>
<P>And watch ye how (?) he held her soul, <BR> And still he bad her bide,
<BR> And the lusty smith became her love <BR> For all her mighty pride.

<P>From: David Durand<BR> Date: ?? [sorry. --WIE]
</P>
<P>The Twa Magicians is Child # 44. It is not Irish but Scots. Child himself
was not  impressed with the ballad, calling it a &quot;base-born cousin of a
pretty ballad known  over all Southern Europe and elsewhere.&quot; Child prefers
the French versions but  mentions other versions ranging from Catalan to
Serbian. Child cites folk tales as the  origin of the ballad. Although he
mentions many such tales, my best estimate is that  the song is derived from one
of the shape-shifting contests in the Arabian Nights and  may very well have
been derived directly from the tale rather than from a  translation of the
French. Child has nothing to say on this point, nor does he try to  date the
ballad. 
</P>
<P>I am inclined to think that the ballad, although not in its current form may
be  fairly old. Much of the magic dropped out of the surviving versions of
ballads in  England and Scotland, and in general the more magic, or magical
connotations the  older the version. The Arabian Nights came to England after
the Crusades, and  there is earlier shape-shifting in the Welsh material
surrounding Talesein. This is all  speculation on my part, based on a lot of
reading in this area. 
</P>
<P>There is an American version of the Twa Magicians. There is not sufficient 
evidence to date it. The song is quite similar. A stanza in the American version
that  does not occur in the Scots version is: 
</P>
<P> She turned into a fly, <BR> A fly all in the air, <BR> And he turned into
a spider bug, <BR> And he fetched her to his lair. 
</P>
<P>The chorus is: <BR> Hello, hello, hello, hello, you coal black smith, <BR>
You've done me no harm. <BR> You never shall have my maidenhead that I have
kept so long, <BR> You fusty, dusty, lusty coal black smith, <BR> Maiden I
shall die. 
</P>
<P>However the chorus is changed after the last stanza to: <BR> Hello, hello,
hello, hello you coal black smith, <BR> You've done me the harm. <BR> You have
taen my maidenhead that I have kept so long, <BR> You fusty, dusty, lusty coal
black smith, <BR> Do it once again.

<P>The new Big Country album (oh no...) just got a rave review by Melody Maker,
 which specifically pointed out &quot;Kate Bush's ATHLETIC warbling&quot; and
it's  celtic/folk influences and overall progression from the earlier albums.
Nyah Nyah  Nyah....

<P>OK, I'm going off 'round Europe for a bit, so you won't have to worry about 
much more KT trivia postings anymore. 
</P>
<P>However, as a parting shot, here's some stuff from the latest Record Mirror:

</P>
<P>(The &quot;Big Country&quot; interview they're on the cover): 
</P>
<P>&quot;....and the title track features a duet with Kate Bush. Stuart says
he's been a  Kate fan for a long time. 
</P>
<P>`The Central character of the song &quot;The Seer&quot; is a woman, so I
though (thought)  it would be good to get a woman's vocal point of view. I have
a lot of Kate Bush  albums, and I like her voice. She varies it so much. There's
a lot of variety and  texture in the way she sings, and she's always coming up
with something different.  She's a perfectionist; she won't give up until she's
absolutely satisfied with what  she's done. She has a lot of dedication.' &quot;

<P>&gt; From IED: <BR> &gt; IED agrees that there is no intrinsic merit in Big
Country, only ancillary interest  stemming entirely from their association with
KT. Whether their music is good or  not is immaterial. It is enough that they
have worked with the greatest living human  being. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush the &quot;greatest living human being&quot;??? That's ridiculous.
Dear  Love-Hounds readers, I implore you, please let us keep things in the
proper  perspective. Kate the &quot;greatest living human being&quot;??? 
</P>
<P>Kate is no mere human being, she is a God! Please try to keep this in mind 
before you speak heresy.

<P>Kate saves,

</P>
<P>I came across the following interview with Big Country in a freebie mag from
 HMV. Their comments on 'The Seer' track from the album of the same name may  be
of interest to collectors of Kate trivia. 
</P>
<P>&quot;We'd done the song and one of our mates, a guy called Davy Duncan who
used  to play and sing in a band called The Shaking Pyramids, put down Barrad
which is a  sort of ethnic Scottish-Irish type hand-held drums - and it gave it
a sort of folky feel,  along with the mandolins and the sitars. We thought 'this
song needs girl vocals on  it' and Stuart immediately thought 'why don't we get
Kate Bush?' We said there's  only one way to do it and that's phone her
management. They said that Kate would  do it but she'd like to hear a cassette
of the song first. So we sent a cassette there  and she liked the song and she
worked out her parts for the song, orchestrating  them really well. Then she
came to the studio and did them, it took her about twelve  hours to do and it
was just great, it was fantastic. 
</P>
<P>I think the woman is just a complete genius. She was very shy. I think we
were  quite awestruck as well when she walked in. Tony was like 'Oh, hello Kate,
would  you like a cup of coffee, would you like a glass of orange juice?',
running about  saying things like that. I think we were quite shy, she was quite
shy as well. But she  was good fun, she's got a good sense of humour as well.
She's got a very 'Comic  Strip' type of sense of humour which we immediately
identified with and after that  it was a great time.&quot;

<P>I've had the misfortune of hearing the Utah Saint's new single (read the
last  Homeground if you're unsure what I'm going on about!) 
</P>
<P>Something Good Is Going To Happen is sad and pathetic, and shows really what
 the current music scene is like. I'm sure Kate wasn't asked by EMI when they
gave  permission to Utah Saints to use the sample from Cloudbusting. Oh well
such is life!!

<P>Well, as all of KaTe's stuff (since On Stage) is (C)opyrighted and (P)
(anybody  know what the P stands for?) by her (or Novercia to be precise), I
don't think it  would be up to EMI to give permission. Actually, the pop column
in my local  newspaper (written by a local radio DJ) a few weeks ago claimed
that KaTe actually  *liked* &quot;Something Good&quot;!. How she (the DJ) would
know that, I really don't  know....

<P>&quot;Something Good&quot; is now up to #6 in the UK Gallup chart. The video
was on the  ITV Chart Show on Saturday. They've stuck bits from the Cloudbusting
vid in  between Utah Saints concerts shots, thus creating a video of even more
incoherence  than your average one 8^). 
</P>
<P>What's worse is that according to the Chart Show &quot;Not only did Kate
allow them  to sample &quot;Cloubusting&quot; there are also rumours of a
collaboration!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh yeah, just like Prince, I'll bet....

</P>
<P>From the showbiz page of our local newspaper: 
</P>
<P>&quot;We hadn't a clue how Kate would react when we sent her a tape of the
track&quot;,  says singer Jezz Willis.&quot;Especially since we'd nicked the
strings and drums of  Cloudbusting as well as the vocals. We didn't want people
to think we were taking  the piss. We wanted it to sound cool rather than
quirky. Kate even agreed to sell us  a 30-second clip of the Cloudbusting video.
The only trouble was that we had to edit  Donald Sutherland out. If we'd kept
him in, it would have cost us an arm and a leg.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh, and they're not from Utah, and they're not saints. Hence the name 8^) 
</P>
<P>They're British, and used to be called &quot;Massive Dance Music Alert&quot;....

</P>
<P>I just saw a very interesting thing on one of the staellite channels over
here. It  was a music video by a band called 'the Utah Saints' with a song
called &quot;Something  Good.' The main hook was a sample from the Godess'
'Cloudbusting' &quot;I just know  that something good is going to happen&quot;
and it was layered with all kinds of bass and  guitars and a funky rythm. It was
wierd to watch, especially since, mixed through  footage of the band playing in
some club, they had some video-samples from  'Cloudbusting:' the rain-machine,
Kate as a nine-year-old boy, etc. 
</P>
<P>This means, according to me, that Kate must have aproved it, she owns the 
copyrights to the original video, doesn't she? 
</P>
<P>Kate meets Funk. Wierd.

<BR> Subject: Kate on Super Channel 
</P>
<P>Hi all, 
</P>
<P>I always knew that SuperChannel is better than MTV, at least in their
musical  taste. I flipped through the channels and saw Kates 'Rocket Man'. If it
weren't the  case that I already have 'RM' from MTV (and as such in stereo), I
would be a little  bit angry because my VCR wasn't ready... but, after the
'Rocket Man' video there  was an interview with one guy of the Utah Saints. They
talked about sampling in  general and especially from Kate and Annie Lennox, two
people who never before  sanctioned using samples from them. Utah Saints always
work like they have worked  with Kate: they do their song and then approach the
artist. The guy said that it  would technically easier to take another Kate song
to get a sample, e.g. 'Wuthering  Heights', but the line 'Something Good...'
would fit best into their song. The guy  also said that Utah Saints were
performing about 50 gigs in the past year or so. I  don't think that I really
have to tell you what video was played next: 'Something  Good'. That's
one-and-a-half Kate Bush videos in a row, like half a 3 from 1... 
</P>
<P>Uli 
</P>
<P>P.S. One of the Editors of 'All Mixed Up', the programme on which the above 
appeared, is called 'Dave Bush', might this be the reason for the Kateacceptance
 you can see on that programme?
