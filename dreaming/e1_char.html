      <BR> Subject: The Secret Policeman's Third Ball </P>
    
    <P>Latest news on Kate: </P>
    
    <P>According to one paper I saw, Kate was scheduled to appear in 'The
      Secret Policeman's Third Ball' at the London Palladium on 28/29th March.
      This is the third of the irregular galas to raise money for Amnesty
      International. If previous events are any guide there will be a film/video
      and album to follow. Other artists mentioned included Peter Gabriel, Lou
      Reed, Jackson Browne, (Sir) Bob Geldof, Mark Knopfler and Joan
      Armatrading. </P>
    
    <P>Kate is one of a whole host of British artists featured on a new version
      of the Beatles' classic 'Let it be'. The record is released under the
      collective title 'Ferry Aid' and all proceeds will go towards a fund for
      the relatives of the victims of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. </P>
    
    <P>The record is distributed by CBS records and is numbered AID1; it was
      recorded at PWL Studios, The Borough, London between March 15-17th. The
      sleeve features a small photo of Kate, along with ones of Paul McCartney,
      Boy George, Mark Knopfler, Mark King, someone who may be Jaki Graham, and
      the lead singer from Curiosity Killed the Cat. Kate gets to sing a couple
      of lines as lead vocalist about two thirds of the way through the song.
      The B-side features a short gospel mix in which it is impossible to
      distinguish any individual vocals. This single is widely tipped to enter
      the charts at number one this week. I expect there will be a video to go
      with it and will post any news as to whether Kate appears in this. </P>

    <P>According to the music press, Kate appeared at the Amnesty gig(s) with a
      band which included Dave Gilmour. She played 'Running up that Hill' and a
      version of 'Let it be'. The latter was not well received by either the guy
      from Malady Mawker or No Music Express. Apparently it was an attempt to
      get the audience to sing along (and probably earn a bit more money for the
      Ferry Aid single) which fell a bit flat (in the reporters' opinion at
      least). </P>

    <P>Date: Sun, 05 Apr 87 20:26 PST
      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
      <BR> Subject: Ferry Aid </P>
    
    <P>KT News: </P>
    
    <P>The Ferry Aid single is in L.A. shops, and herewith is a description
      blessedly devoid of the kind of sentimental drivel that attended the event
      itself; a review that has not been affected by the sanctimonious,
      a-critical thinking that the ferry disaster seems to have inspired in the
      majority of musical critics. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Let It Be&quot; begins with the original McCartney vocal
      superimposed over a typically sleazy 80's pop arrangement. This is
      followed by Boy George's slimy lounge-act vocal; which in turn is
      succeeded by an increasingly chaotic and tasteless assault of British
      pseudo-soulsters (why do British black singers have to assume American
      black idioms, accents, pronunciations and vocal embellishments, all of
      which are a denial of their own vastly different cultural heritage?; what
      is wrong with a British black sounding British?). Then there is a smarmy
      guitar-ridden instrumental bridge and a wildly over-blown chorus. </P>
    
    <P>And then, folks, in the middle of all this JUNK, time blushes, delays:
      and Kate sings two lines. She uses her lowest register, and sings in an
      understated, precise English style that communicates volumes of emotion
      with a minimum of words and sound. It has nothing -- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING --
      to do with the rest of the record. </P>
    
    <P>Her vocal ends, and is succeeded by a predictable unison chorus of
      monumental seaminess that could not be more out of context with Kate's
      contribution than a volley of cannon-shot. The haste and bad taste with
      which this enterprise was undertaken is everywhere apparent except in
      Kate's tiny musical aside. Her distance from the recording as a whole is
      very clearly audible -- right down to the absence, even, of the most
      rudimentary drum-fill to lead the music out of her tiny, poignant
      reliquary back into the diseased, slobbering excess of the climax and
      denouement -- that's how much an afterthought Kate's part was in the foul,
      musically syphilitic mind of Boy George. </P>
    
    <P>Her part could have made eloquent sense of a large part of his
      concoction had it immediately succeeded the embalmed extract from
      McCartney's original. But, obviously, Boy George had already determined
      that that honoured position on the totem pole should go to himself. As a
      result the progression from Beatle to Boy is one from writ to rotten;
      whereas a direct move from McCartney to Kate might have brought into
      beautiful, microcosmic focus the true progression of British music from
      Beatles to Bush. Instead, Kate is thrown into a mire of yUcKy contemporary
      pap that does the rest of the musicians a disservice by emphasizing their
      hopeless inferiority as it does her a dishonour by soiling the sacred
      garment of her music in the diseased puddle of their sonic offal. </P>
    
    <P>Nonetheless, Kate's two little lines in Ferry Aid's &quot;Let It Be&quot;
      are like two glittering, holy eyes shining the light of perfeKTion from
      the center of the entire dirty storm, and more than redeeming the
      otherwise sordid enterprise. Strongly recommended. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Band Aid </P>
    
    <P>The 'Let it be' video was played (it's No. 1) on TOTP last thursday. It
      is very similar to the Band Aid video i.e. studio shots of the artists
      recording their various bits. Kate's brief (c. 12 secs.) appearance shows
      her in close-up in front of a microphone the size of a basketball
      superimposed with a longer distance shot, before changing to just the
      close-up. Unlike most of the other performers she was not wearing 'cans'
      whilst singing. The video ends with a communal sing along featuring as
      motley a crew of pop persons as you could imagine. So far I've been unable
      to spot Kate amongst the aasembled multitude. She probably took one look
      at them and fled in terror! </P>

      <BR> Subject: Talk about sleazy... </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I'm a bit confused by your use of original here IED. Do you really
      mean the vocal track recorded with The Beatles? Certainly, the video shows
      an ageing McCartney at the piano singing the lines. </P>
    
    <P>Thanks for all your comments, Neil, as usual you are very helpful. IED
      had heard in U.S. news reports that Boy George and the producer had begun
      the song with &quot;Paul McCartney's original Beatles vocal recording&quot;
      re-mixed with the new backing track. Obviously, this report was incorrect,
      however. (The video has still not appeared here, unfortunately, although
      it may show up on MTV at any moment.) He does sing it with nearly every
      original inflection unchanged, however. </P>
    
    <P>The Sun's association has always been well understood. The &quot;Chart
      File&quot; columnist for Record Mirror (the best of the British music
      weeklies, because it has by far the best news service, most complete chart
      information and least political/cultural input from its reporters) this
      week pointed out the suspicious-at-best motives behind the Ferry Aid
      project, without naming names. Our Mayfair critic would do well to read
      the column. Incidentally, RM, too, singled out Kate's contribution as one
      of the only worthwhile things to have come out of the project. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Perhaps my hearing is fading but I felt Kate was a little off on
      the very last note. Just short of perfeKTion in my opinion but she looks
      stunning in the video. </P>
    
    <P>IED will have to listen again, but he thinks he knows what you're
      alluding to, and he had believed it was a deliberate touch. Maybe not.

    <P>Watching today's &quot;Our Common Future&quot; benefit telecast, I was
      happily surprised to see a few moments of Kate Bush - not in live
      performance, unfortunately, although they did say that would have surprise
      guests (no, that's too much to hope for...) but rather in a video for a
      new benefit song titled &quot;Spirit of the Forest&quot;. The format of
      the portion of the video they showed is very similar to the &quot;We Are
      the World&quot; video - many stars standing around in a group, with
      headphones, some of them taking solo turns. Kate actually has a couple
      lines to herself, and if I remember correctly was joined by Jon Anderson.
      Other people I spotted include Little Steven, Debbie Harry, and (I think)
      Lena Horne. </P>
    
    <P>Also - does anyone know the story behind this song, i.e. who wrote it,
      who organized it, etc.? Nina Blackwood, who's hosting this thing, was
      pretty sketchy in her information (as usual). </P>

    <P>In the current issue of MOJO magazine from the UK, there is mention of,
      and a little picture of, Kate in their gossip section at the front. She
      was one of the contributors to an art show organized by Brian Eno to raise
      money for Bosnian relief. </P>
    
    <P>Her contribution was a framed piece of black velvet with a blinking red
      light in the middle, entitled something like Missing Person in the Ocean
      Hoping that An Airplane Will Spot Them. The identical companion piece was
      titled something like Airplane Hoping To Spot Missing Person In the Ocean
      (The Ninth Wave, anyone? ;)) </P>
    
    <P>The item didn't say if or for how much the piece sold for, but there was
      a very nice picture of &quot;La Bush&quot; standing next to Brian Eno at
      the opening of the exhibit, both looking healthy and happy. </P>
    
    <P>This issue of MOJO has REM on the cover, if you are looking for it. I

    <P>The same story appears in the latest Q magazine (with Madonna on the

      reveals a few more details. Firstly, their picture shows Kate with Paul
      MacCartney (another contributor). It also has pictures of the two works
      although the red dots are invisible. It reveals that David Bowie thought
      Kate's pieces were the best in the show, but that he didn't buy them. They
      were, however, sold for something over #1000. </P>

    <P>I don't recall seeing this posted already by any gaffans, but in the &quot;Stories&quot;
      section of the December issue of Q magazine (the one with Madonna on the
      cover), there is a photo of Kate with &quot;Mr. Thumbs Aloft&quot;
      himself, Paul McCartney! I was quite pleased to see two of my absolute
      favorite musicians in the world in a snap together--it made my day. (Yes I
      know I'm probably in a minority in my devotion to Macca, but I can't help
      it, I love the guy!) </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, the two were together with a bunch of other music folks for the
      War Child charity auction in London raising funds for Sarajevo. Brian Eno
      asked a number of rockers to contribute a piece of original art for the
      auction. Kate's contribution: two matching pieces, each containing a tiny
      red dot in the middle of a black background. The captions on the pieces
      read: </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Someone Lost At Sea Hoping A Plane Will Find Them&quot; and </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Someone In a Plane Hoping To Find Someone Lost At Sea&quot; </P>
    
    <P>A popular theme with Kate, eh? The article went on to say that David
      Bowie (another of the contributors) declared Kate's pieces his favorite,
      but someone else ended up buying them for around L1,150. </P>

    <P>A couple of odd things. Maybe it's just something about Kate, but in
      both of these photos, Paul has the *dopiest* open-mouthed expression on
      his face! Maybe it's just something that Kate brings out in him. Also,
      Kate in heels is almost a full head shorter than the not-tall-at-all Paul.

    <P>I feel sure someone must have posted this before but if they did I
      missed it so here goes. The Greeting Stars Xmas card set is now on sale in
      HMV stores (certainly in the Oxford one). </P>
    
    <P>As has been mentioned they are being sold in aid of the War child
      charity (with 2 pounds from each pack sold going to War Child). The price
      I paid was 5-99 pounds. There are 12 Xmas cards - one each from The Boo
      Radleys, David Bowie, Kate Bush, Brian Eno, Siobhan Fahey &amp; Dave
      Stewart, Peter Gabriel, Massive Attack, Oasis, Iggy Pop, Pulp, Radiohead,
      and The Stone Roses. </P>
    
    <P>Kate's card features the circular Red Shoes image of a dancer's two
      crossed feet but with ice skating blades on the ballet shoes and the
      supporting foot resting on a snow covered chimney with glacial scenery in
      the background. There is Kate's signature in the lower right hand corner.
      Inside is the single word Peace ( several of the cards also contain this
      inside so it is probably the default message put in if the artist
      specifies nothing else). Each card is about 5 inches square. A reduced
      image of Kate's design appears on the front of the pack - which is not too
      surprising since IMHO most of the designs are fairly awful and I would not
      even send them to my enemies. </P>

      fairly common knowledge throughout the KaTe speaking world. There is a set
      of 12 Christmas cards for sale in aid of the 'War Child' charity, the
