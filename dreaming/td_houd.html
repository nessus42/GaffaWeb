<P> THE HOUDINI  SPIRIT MESSAGE 
</P>
<P> by Teller 
</P>
<P> I 
</P>
<P>Bess opened a tearoom after Houdini died. She needed company. She had been 
married thirty-two years. People knew her only as the widow of her husband. She 
sat with customers, all down-and-out showbiz cronies, and reminisced about the
old  days. 
</P>
<P>Weeping in her tea, she'd show her friend how Harry had inscribed inside her
 ring the words of &quot;Rosabelle,&quot; the song she sang when they first
shared a bill on  Coney Island, where they fell in love: 
</P>
<P>Rosabelle, sweet Rosabelle, <BR> I love you more than I can tell. <BR>
Over me you cast a spell. <BR> I love you my sweet Rosabelle. 
</P>
<P> Her friend would smile and ask her for a loan. The tearoom failed. 
</P>
<P>Bess became an author, wrote a screenplay based on Harry's life. It never
sold.  She tried becoming what she'd lost -- &quot;The Greatest Lady Wizard&quot;
-- failed and  sold her documents and recollections for publication in Houdini,
His Life Story. The  book, made from her notes, included table of the code that
she and Harry used in  vaudeville mind reading. 
</P>
<P>To the press, Houdini was still news, which meant that Bess now answered 
questions for him. &quot;Did Houdini think there was a life beyond the grave?&quot;

</P>
<P>&quot;He hoped there was, but would not let himself believe until he heard
his  mother's voice speak through a spirit medium the word 'forgive' -- that was
her  dying word, you know. He never heard. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He was afraid that if he died before me, crooked mediums would come
and take  advantage of my grief, deceive me with their tricks and make me say
things that  would discredit Harry's work exposing fraud and superstition. So he
made a plan  that whoever died first would try to reach the other in a code, a
system we both  knew so well by heart that even death would not make us forget.
The medium who  brings ten words from Harry will win ten thousand dollars as
reward.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Bess made this statement to the Brooklyn Eagle, March 27, 1927. 
</P>
<P> II 
</P>
<P>In February 1928, the pastor of the First Spiritualist Church of New York,
the  Reverend Arthur Ford, became entranced by his celestial guide. 
</P>
<P>He said Cecilia Weiss, Houdini's mother, was present, saying, &quot;All this
later life  my Harry sought to hear from me a certain word I spoke before I
died, 'forgive' --  that was the word -- his wife Bess knew it, no one else.
Contact her. See if what I  say is true.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They sent the message on to Bess. She was impressed. &quot;This is the first
time,&quot;  Bess wrote in reply, &quot;that any spirit message had appearance
of the truth. Had  Houdini heard that word, it would have changed, I think, the
whole course of his  life. Strange in the message that she called him Harry, not
Ehrich as she called him  all his life. But, of course, she has that heavy
German accent. It really is a trivial  mistake.&quot; 
</P>
<P> III 
</P>
<P>In December 1928, Bess came down with influenza, badly. On New Year's Day 
she tumbled down a flight of stairs and hurt her back. Delirious, she cried &quot;Harry,
 dear, who don't you come back to me from the other side?&quot; She reached her
arms  out, as though grasping him, and said, &quot;I knew you would come back to
me, my  dear!&quot; Then she blackened out. 
</P>
<P>As she lay ill on her couch, two members of Ford's congregation came,
bearing a  message which they said had come one word at a time through Reverend
Ford. It  took, they said, ten seances and several months before the ten-word
message was  complete: &quot;Rosabelle, answer, tell, pray, answer, look, tell,
answer, answer, tell.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They saw a look of shock, asked if the words made sense to her. 
</P>
<P>They did. The two advised her to arrange for Reverend Ford to come and hold
a  seance in her home. 
</P>
<P>Two days later, Bess was lying on the sofa, a bandage on her head, as Arthur
 Ford, sitting blindfolded with a handkerchief, went into a trance. As witnesses
 looked on he spoke the words he'd written in the note, &quot;Rosabelle, answer,
tell,  pray, answer, look, tell, answer, answer, tell,&quot; in a strange voice
which he said was  Houdini's. 
</P>
<P>He asked her whether what he said made sense to her. She said it did. Then
he  went on: &quot;Thank you, sweetheart. Now take off your ring and tell the
witnesses  what 'Rosabelle' means.&quot; Then softly Bess began to sing, 
</P>
<P>Rosabelle, sweet Rosabelle, <BR> I love you more than I can tell. <BR>
Over me you cast a spell. <BR> I love you my sweet Rosabelle. 
</P>
<P> The Houdini voice explained what this song meant to Bess and Harry, then
went  on: The strange words of the message were the cues from the Houdinis'
vaudeville  mind reading. Each word or pair of words stood for a letter of the
alphabet. They  spelled &quot;believe.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Almost gloating now, the voice explained: &quot;Rosabelle, sweet Rosabelle,
BELIEVE!  Spare no time or money to undo the attitude of doubt I had on earth.
Teach the  truth to those who've lost the faith, my sweetheart. Tell the world
there is no  death.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And that is what Bess did. Next day the headline -- &quot;Widow, Ill,
Communes with  Houdini&quot; -- showed up all aorund the world. And on that
January 9, Bess made a  statement to the New York World. She said &quot;I did
not know what words Harry  would use. Of course I knew that is would be in code,
but, when he said 'believe,' I  was surprised.&quot; 
</P>
<P> IV 
</P>
<P>What could have made Bess act the way she did? How could she be surprised to
 hear from Ford things she had told the press in interviews or give to be
published in  a book? What made her thing the word &quot;believe&quot; was more
than something  Reverend Ford had just made up to make a point and publicize
himself? 
</P>
<P>Was she unbalanced? After three decade in Houdini's shadow, was the light
too  much? Her health was always &quot;fragile.&quot; What did &quot;fragile&quot;
mean? They say she loved  champagne. And in the latter years, when &quot;health&quot;
prevented her from working in  the show with Harry, they say she often say
backstage and sipped. 
</P>
<P>There was a darker possibility. When the insurance money started to run low,
 and she had sold Houdini's props, had Ford offered Bess publicity and profits
from a  lecture tour they'd make to &quot;spread the good word&quot; of life
after death? 
</P>
<P>That's what the press though, not suprisingly. Almost overnight the
headlines  changed: &quot;Houdini Message a Big Hoax!&quot; they said.
Investigative journalists obtained  a copy of the letter Ford had sent two days
before the seance, in which he claimed to  have received the &quot;code words&quot;
from his &quot;guide.&quot; This, they said, was evidence that  Bess and Ford
had hatched the plot together. Ford was accused of fraud and brought  to trial
by his own congregation. He was not convicted, but the cloud of doubt  remained.

</P>
<P>Bess never spoke to Reverend Ford again. She disavowed the message: &quot;I
was ill,  both physically and mentally. Such was my eagerness that mediums were
able to  prey upon my mind, make me believe, and say things that would bring my
husband  shame.&quot; 
</P>
<P> V 
</P>
<P>Bess kept a candle burning for ten years in her apartment by a picture of 
Houdini. And each year on Halloween she took that candle to a seance, hopeful. 
</P>
<P>In October 1936, high on the famous Knickerbocker Hotel roof in Hollywood,
she  tried on final time. No handcuffs opened, and no trumpet spoke. No message
wrote  itself upon the slate. No table rose. No tambourine stood up and danced.

</P>
<P>Bess made a little speech: &quot;I do not think that Harry will come back to
me or  anyone. I think the dead don't speak. I now regretfully turn out the
light. This is the  end, Harry,&quot; she said. &quot;Good night!&quot; And she
blew the candle out. 
</P>
<P> This story was from the groovey book, &quot;Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends&quot;
by Penn  Jillette and Teller (the latter actually wrote this particular story).

</P>
<P>Now why did I post this story here? Well, it helped me pick up some points
in  the song &quot;Houdini&quot; that I was unsure of... For example, the
tambourine was a kind  of &quot;sign&quot; during the seance. And this story
explained the &quot;code&quot; mentioned in the  song... Also, this story gave
background information that kinda set the scene for the  song... 
</P>
<P>Hope you enjoyed it, and I'm sorry it's a bit lengthy...

<P>This being one of my favourite KaTe songs, something has always bothered me.
 Who is/was Rosabel? Before you all jump out and say Mrs. Houdini, I know for a 
fact that Mrs. Houdini's name was Bess. (OK, Elizabeth.) 
</P>
<P>BTW, I was talking to my brother about this song, He is not a KaTe fan, but
is an  amateur magician and a member of IBM (international Brotherhood of
Magicians) It  turns out that KaTe's idea that the key for Houdini's stunts is
probably erroneous.  (I am talking about passing the key with a kiss) It was a
theory that was once held,  but has been pretty well refuted by now.

<P>Harry promised that he would try to contact Bess from beyond the grave. The 
code, &quot;...that only you and I know&quot; was the title of their favorite
song, _Rosabel  Believe_. Kate had seen a TV documentary about Houdini that
detailed the  attempts. Bess held many seances with many different mediums
attempting to  contact him. At one point a medium produced the code, but it
turned out that he  had obtained the code in a non-supernatural way. Bess
eventually sadly concluded  that it was impossible to communicate with the dead.
Kate may be of a different  opinion, or chose to ignore the last part for
dramatic reasons.

<P> If you have ever seen the &quot;Die Eftling&quot; video of &quot;Strange

songwriter and musician, is an absolutely  dreadful magician.

</P>
<P>I was recently showing someone the Houdini description that Kate once wrote 
(the story anout Ford, etc.) and the album cover and the song. Just when I
thought I  was thru, she asked about the lyrics, and who Rosabelle is, and I was
stumped. I felt  dumb because I know this we've discussed this whole thing here
before, but for the  life of me I cannot remember. So, if someone could please
post a summary of any  pertinent details, specifically, what point of view the
lyrics are told from (the POV  seems to shift, right?) and who is Rosabelle, I
would be grateful and could end my  friend's confusion. 
</P>
<P>Thanks in advance. -mjm (mike mendelson)

</P>
<P>The phrase 'Rosabelle, believe' was the code phrase that Houdini worked out 
with his wife to send to her from the afterlife. Though Houdini's wife tried a 
myriad of mediums, none had the correct message. Well, apparently one did, but I
 do believe it was shown that that medium and Mrs. Houdini had either planned it
 out before, or she had accidentally informed him of the code phrase.
</P>
<P>Rosabelle, of course, was just his wife's nickname, if I remember correctly.

</P>
<P>Thanks for refreshing my memory as to Rosabel's ID. Does anyone know 
Houdini's wife's *real* name (assuming Rosabel was a term of endearment  unknown
to anyone else)? 
</P>
<P>There are still some lines in this song that are a bit perplexing. So, here
are all  the lyrics (for those, like me, who have not memorized every syllable
of every song  backwards in sanskrit) so you can all help me understand.My notes
are in the left  margin.
</P>
<P> Houdini
</P>
<P> I wait at the table,<BR>  And hold hands with weeping strangers,<BR> 
Wait for you<BR>  To join the group. 
</P>
<P>OK, so Mrs.H. is sitting at a table with some charlatan who claims he can
contact  her dead hubby. 
</P>
<P> The tambourine jingle-jangles.<BR>  The medium roams and rambles.<BR> 
Not taken in,  I break the circle. 
</P>
<P>Alas, he cannot pull the wool over her eyes, so she cuts the seance short...

</P>
<P> I want this man<BR>  To go away now. 
</P>
<P>...and expresses loathing for the guy who's in charge. 
</P>
<P> With a kiss<BR> I'd pass the key<BR> And feel your tongue<BR> Teasing
and receiving.<BR> With your spit<BR> Still on my lip--<BR>  You hit the
water. 
</P>
<P>Here a little reminiscence re: her husband's exploits... the way she would
slip  him the key before he enterred the locked trunk about to be submerged in 
shark-infested ice cold water etc. etc. (&quot;Teasing and receiving&quot;
--ain't that  brilliant?) 
</P>
<P> Him and I in the room<BR>  To prove you are with us too. 
</P>
<P>Now, she's referring to the guy called Ford, I presume, who supposedly 
succeeded in uncovering the correct code Houdini and his wife agreed on before
his  departure: &quot;Rosabel believe.&quot; 
</P>
<P> He's using code that only you and I know.<BR>  This is no trick of his.<BR>
 This is your magic. 
</P>
<P>But it's really Houdini who is pulling the strings. 
</P>
<P> I'd catch the cues,<BR>  Watching you,<BR>  Hoping you'd do something
wrong. 
</P>
<P>This is where I start to lose it. What is she referring to here? The cues of
 Houdini as he is about to perform a trick? Well, why would she hope something
go  wrong? Or has she started to refer to the medium in second person, suddenly,
thus  hoping that *he*'d do something wrong? I'm a little puzzled. Help. 
</P>
<P> Everybody thinks you'll never make it,<BR>  But every time,<BR>  You
escape! 
</P>
<P>Sure, everyone else is the skeptic... but Mrs.H. knows he will succeed... or
does  she? 
</P>
<P> Rosabel believe,<BR>  Not even eternity<BR>  Can hold Houdini! 
</P>
<P>At least a double entendre here: 1) Rosabel (Mrs.H.) believe that H is boss,
or 2)  Ford uttering &quot;Rosabel believe&quot;, the mantra that proves he has
contacted H, whom  no one can hold back. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Rosabel, believe!&quot; 
</P>
<P> Through the glass<BR> I'd watch you breathe.<BR> Bound and drowned,<BR>
And paler than you've ever been. 
</P>
<P> With your life<BR> The only thing in my mind--<BR>  We pull you from the
water! 
</P>
<P>I guess Mrs.H. is apprehensive when Houdini does his stunts, even though she
 knows the trick. 
</P>
<P> Houdini! 
</P>
<P> You<BR>  And I<BR>  And Rosabel believe. 
</P>
<P>A conundrumatic ending. Is 'you' the person listening to the song? Ford? 
Houdini himself? Does Rosabel here refer to Mrs.H., making the &quot;I&quot;
redundant? Or  is Kate the &quot;I&quot;, speaking now as narrator about H or
the listener (you) and Mrs. H.? 
</P>
<P>OK. All help is hereby solicited and accepted. Thanks.

</P>
<P>You see, I always thought that this verse was about the people who came
tosee  Houdini perform his magic, and Mrs. H. was referring to how many ofthem
were  secretly excited by the idea of Houdini screwing up somehow andgetting
hurt. After  all, if you go to see Houdini do his thing, a lot ofthe excitement
is in wondering  whether he can actually pull it off. 
</P>
<P>&gt;I guess Mrs.H. is apprehensive when Houdini does his stunts, even though
she  knows the trick.
</P>
<P>This is basically consistent with the ideas I stated above. Mrs.
Houdinican't help  but be affected by the possibility of a mistake or an
accident. She knows that  PROBABLY everything will be all right, but the small
elementof uncertainty is quite  troublesome to her. 
</P>
<P>&gt;OK. All help is hereby solicited and accepted. Thanks.

<P>Thank YOU. I had often wondered about most of the lyrics in this song, 
whichtended to be pretty mysterious since I didn't know anything about the

</P>
<P>The entire song is from the point of view of Houdini's wife. Rosabelle was,
I  believe Houdini's mother. The name is important, though, because the 'secret 
code' that Houdini shared with his wife so she'd know he was speaking to her 
from 'beyond' was &quot;Rosabelle believe.&quot; Hence it's many repetitions
within the song. 
</P>
<P>Of course, the one line in the song not spoken by Mrs. Houdini is Del's 
telephoned &quot;Rosabelle belive&quot; in the second verse. 
</P>
<P>While the entire song is first-person from Mrs. Houdini, it *does* jump
around  int time. The verses are after Houdini's death and the refrain is during
various  performances. 
</P>
<P>God, this song is so romantic, sad, chilling. It gives me shivvers every
time I hear  it. &lt;sigh&gt;

Mapes) <BR> Subject: Re: Who is Rosabelle? 
</P>
<P>According to a documentary we have, &quot;Rosabel Believe&quot; was a song
that the  Houdinis loved. An excerpt of what I assume is the actual song is
playing at the point  where the voice-over is talking about them setting up the
code. 
</P>
<P>Shall I blaspheme a little? Why not, even God can take some ribbing every
now  and then. The song itself works just fine, lyrically and musically, but
Kate herself  came off looking just a bit silly in interviews after the album
came out, when talking  about that song. In reality, whats-his-name never broke
the code through  supernatural means. Mrs. Houdini thought he did, at first (and
there's the song) but  later found out that he obtained the code through earthly
means. She eventually  stated that there was no way of communicating with the
dearly departed. I don't  know where Kate heard the story that turned into &quot;Houdini&quot;
but she didn't do any  homework on the real story. I cringe when listening to
some of those interviews,  because the way she talks, she actually *believes*
that Mrs H made contact with Mr  H. I hope someone told her, and I hope she

<P>&gt; This is where I start to lose it. What is she referring to here? The
cues of  Houdini as he is about to perform a trick? Well, why would she hope
something go  wrong? Or has she started to refer to the medium in second person,
suddenly, thus  hoping that *he*'d do something wrong? I'm a little puzzled.
Help.

<P>It's &quot;queues.&quot; In British usage, a queue is a line, as in a line

<P>&gt;It's been a while since I actually looked at the lyrics for this song,
butI always  got the impression that the word was &quot;queues&quot;, as in
lines ofpeople. Pardon my  ignorance if this is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>You're right--the printed lyric is &quot;queue&quot;. However, I'd say that
this is a very  good pun, becaues both spellings of the homophone &quot;cue/queue&quot;
(in English, in any  event) make perfect grammatical and contextual sense. 
</P>
<P>&gt; This is basically consistent with the ideas I stated above. Mrs.
Houdini can't help  but be affected by the possibility of a mistake or an
accident.She knows that  PROBABLY everything will be all right, but the small
elementof uncertainty is quite  troublesome to her. 
</P>
<P>As someone's already pointed out, that last verse (&quot;bound and drowned
and paler  than you've ever been&quot;) would, in fact, refer to his actual
death. Apparently one of  his &quot;tricks&quot; was to allow strong,
macho-minded folks to punch him as hard as they  could in the stomach. Not long
before his final performance, he did this, and the  puncher ruptured something
(the other poster said &quot;appendix&quot; and I'll buy that).  This interfered
with his underwater escape and he drowned.

<P>Well, thanks to everyone for their Houdini interpretations. I understand
most of  it now, though you may have noticed some discrepancies among the
various people  who posted their ideas. Note to ARCHIVE-MAN (Ron?? or whoever):
The  transcription I used is from IED's *most-lyrics* post from who-knows-when. 
There, he writes &quot;cues&quot;, not &quot;queues&quot;. Granted queues makes
more sense in context.  I'm not at home, but I wonder what the lyric booklet
gives for this spelling?  Anyways, someone might want to correct the most-lyrics
post in the archives.

It's a line from the  Houdini's favorite song, atleast that's what I've read.
Supposedly that they agreed  to use the name &quot;Rosabelle&quot; as the code
word to contact each other. I also read that  Beatrice Houdini had taken a fall
down a flight of stairs and blacked out BUT she  had mumbled &quot;something&quot;
while she was &quot;unconcious&quot; that her nurse heard. As the  story goes it
was the nurse who told the psychic the code because that's what the  &quot;something&quot;
was that Beatrice mumbled.

<P>The Annotated 'Houdini'
</P>
<P>From the lady herself: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The song is written from Mrs. Houdini's point of view. And what was
rather  beautiful was she used to help him a lot with his tricks and one of the
things that  she would do, before he went off into his tank or to jump into the
sea or whatever it  was, she would pass him a tiny key with a kiss before she
left him and he went off.  And when he was then in the water he would use the
key to unlock the padlocks.  So in many ways by passing that key she was keeping
an eye on his life, making sure  that he be safe, that he would come out again.&quot;

</P>
<P>The following is a collection of what people on the mailing list had to say:

</P>
<P>Who was Rosabelle? and some Houdini details. 
</P>
<P>Rosabelle wasn't Harry Houdini's wife or mother... 
</P>
<P>Mother = Cecilia Weiss 
</P>
<P>Father = Mayer Samuel Weiss 
</P>
<P>(Harry was born Ehrich Weiss)

Harry met her while he and his brother were doing their magic act at Coney
Island.  10 days later, Harry married her, and she joined the magic act (his
brother left) 
</P>
<P>Houdini was 'hit' in the stomach after an afternoon show at the Princess 
Theater in Montreal. The fellow who hit him was a boxing star (college) at
McGill  University. 
</P>
<P>Two days later (and after his last show) doctors operated on Houdini and 
removed a torn appendix... 
</P>
<P>According to a documentary we have, &quot;Rosabelle Believe&quot; was a song
that the  Houdinis loved - a song that Bess had sung at Coney Island when Bess &amp;
Harry  started their magic act together... An excerpt of what I assume is the
actual song is  playing at the point where the voice-over is talking about them
setting up the code.  &quot;Rosabelle, sweet Rosabelle, I love you more than I
could tell.&quot; is a line from that  song. 
</P>
<P>What is 'Rosabelle Believe'? 
</P>
<P>The phrase 'Rosabelle, believe' was the code phrase that Houdini worked out 
with his wife to send to her from the afterlife. Though Houdini's wife tried a 
myriad of mediums, none had the correct message. Well, apparently one did, but I
 do believe it was shown that that medium and Mrs. Houdini had either planned it
 out before, or she had accidentally informed him of the code phrase. 
</P>
<P>Beatrice (Bess) Houdini had taken a fall down a flight of stairs and blacked
out  BUT she had mumbled &quot;something&quot; while she was &quot;unconcious&quot;
that her nurse  heard. As the story goes it was the nurse who told the psychic
the code because  that's what the &quot;something&quot; was that Beatrice
mumbled. 
</P>
<P>About the Song. 
</P>
<P>The entire song is from the point of view of Houdini's wife. Rosabelle was,
I  believe Houdini's mother. The name is important, though, because the 'secret 
code' that Houdini shared with his wife so she'd know he was speaking to her 
from 'beyond' was &quot;Rosabelle believe.&quot; Hence it's many repetitions
within the song. 
</P>
<P>Of course, the one line in the song not spoken by Mrs. Houdini is Del's 
telephoned &quot;Rosabelle belive&quot; in the second verse. 
</P>
<P>While the entire song is first-person from Mrs. Houdini, it *does* jump
around  int time. The verses are after Houdini's death and the refrain is during
various  performances. 
</P>
<P>God, this song is so romantic, sad, chilling. It gives me shivvers every
time I hear  it. &lt;sigh&gt; 
</P>
<P>Shall I blaspheme a little? Why not, even God can take some ribbing every
now  and then. The song itself works just fine, lyrically and musically, but
Kate herself  came off looking just a bit silly in interviews after the album
came out, when talking  about that song. In reality, whats-his-name never broke
the code through  supernatural means. Mrs. Houdini thought he did, at first (and
there's the song) but  later found out that he obtained the code through earthly
means. She eventually  stated that there was no way of communicating with the
dearly departed. I don't  know where Kate heard the story that turned into &quot;Houdini&quot;
but she didn't do any  homework on the real story. I cringe when listening to
some of those interviews,  because the way she talks, she actually *believes*
that Mrs H made contact with Mr  H. I hope someone told her, and I hope she
doesn't still believe that. 
</P>
<P>It doesn't matter, I love her anyway. 
</P>
<P>There are still some lines in this song that are a bit perplexing. So, here
are all  the lyrics (for those, like me, who have not memorized every syllable
of every song  backwards in sanskrit) so you can all help me understand.My notes
are in the left  margin.
</P>
<P> Houdini
</P>
<P> I wait at the table,<BR>  And hold hands with weeping strangers,<BR> 
Wait for you<BR>  To join the group. 
</P>
<P>(OK, so Mrs.H. is sitting at a table with some charlatan who claims he can
contact  her dead hubby.)
</P>
<P> The tambourine jingle-jangles.<BR>  The medium roams and rambles.<BR> 
Not taken in,<BR>  I break the circle. 
</P>
<P>(Alas, he cannot pull the wool over her eyes, so she cuts the seance
short...)
</P>
<P> I want this man<BR>  To go away now. 
</P>
<P>(...and expresses loathing for the guy who's in charge.)
</P>
<P>With a kiss<BR> I'd pass the key<BR> And feel your tongue<BR> Teasing and
receiving.<BR> With your spit<BR> Still on my lip--<BR>  You hit the water. 
</P>
<P>Here a little reminiscence re: her husband's exploits... the way she would
slip  him the key before he enterred the locked trunk about to be submerged in 
shark-infested ice cold water etc. etc. (&quot;Teasing and receiving&quot;
--ain't that  brilliant?) 
</P>
<P> Him and I in the room<BR>  To prove you are with us too. 
</P>
<P>Now, she's referring to the guy called Ford, I presume, who supposedly 
succeeded in uncovering the correct code Houdini and his wife agreed on before
his  departure: &quot;Rosabelle believe.&quot;
</P>
<P> He's using code that only you and I know.<BR>  This is no trick of his.<BR>
 This is your magic. 
</P>
<P>But it's really Houdini who is pulling the strings.
</P>
<P> I'd catch the cues,<BR>  Watching you,<BR>  Hoping you'd do something
wrong. 
</P>
<P>What is she referring to here? The cues of Houdini as he is about to perform
a  trick? Well, why would she hope something go wrong? Or has she started to
refer to  the medium in second person, suddenly, thus hoping that *he*'d do
something  wrong? Or has she started to refer to the medium in second person,
suddenly, thus  hoping that *he*'d do something wrong? 
</P>
<P>- I think the latter. She is *afraid* that Houdini really is contactingher.
(You  might be afraid too if you thought that a ghost was tryingto contact you)
even though  it might have been your husband. 
</P>
<P>- It's &quot;queues.&quot; In British usage, a queue is a line, as in a line
of people.This is a  reference to spectators lined up, secretly hoping something
goeswrong in the trick. 
</P>
<P>- This is basically consistent with the ideas I stated above. Mrs.
Houdinican't help  but be affected by the possibility of a mistake or an
accident.She knows that  PROBABLY everything will be all right, but the small
elementof uncertainty is quite  troublesome to her.
</P>
<P> Everybody thinks you'll never make it,<BR>  But every time,<BR>  You
escape! 
</P>
<P>Sure, everyone else is the skeptic... but Mrs.H. knows he will succeed... or
does  she?
</P>
<P> Rosabelle believe,<BR>  Not even eternity<BR>  Can hold Houdini! 
</P>
<P>At least a double entendre here: 1) Rosabelle (Mrs.H.) believe that H is
boss, or 2)  Ford uttering &quot;Rosabelle believe&quot;, the mantra that proves
he has contacted H, whom  no one can hold back.
</P>
<P>&quot;Rosabelle, believe!&quot;<BR> Through the glass<BR> I'd watch you
breathe.<BR> Bound and drowned,<BR> And paler than you've ever been.<BR> With
your life<BR> The only thing in my mind--<BR>  We pull you from the water! 
</P>
<P>I guess Mrs.H. is apprehensive when Houdini does his stunts, even though she
 knows the trick. 
</P>
<P>The description is how Houdini died. He was punched in the stomach when he 
wasn't ready for it by some idiot shortly before he was to go on stage. It
ruptured  his appendix. He passed out in the tank and drowned.
</P>
<P> Houdini!  You<BR>  And I<BR>  And Rosabelle believe. 
</P>
<P>A conundrumatic ending. Is 'you' the person listening to the song? Ford? 
Houdini himself? Does Rosabelle here refer to Mrs.H., making the &quot;I&quot;
redundant?  Or is Kate the &quot;I&quot;, speaking now as narrator about H or
the listener (you) and Mrs.  H.? Possibly &quot;You and I and the code.&quot; or
maybe the &quot;I&quot; is Kate.

Castergine&quot; &lt;scasterg@cd.columbus.oh.us&gt; <BR> Subject: Houdini 
</P>
<P>Here's something for discussion. Listen closely to Houdini. 
</P>
<P>The official lyrics say &quot;With your spit still on my lips.&quot; 
</P>
<P>But when I listen to it, I always get the impression that she is saying &quot;With
your  spirit still on my lips&quot;. The 'r' sound seems greatly slurred and
rushed, but there. 
</P>
<P>It seems there is a certain poetic beauty to spirit instead of spit. The
word used  for spirit in Greek translations of the Bible was derived from the
word for wind or  breath, and there are passages in the Bible that equate the
spirit with the breath. 
</P>
<P>Since the song is about her searching for his spirit, I think it is neat to
imagine  one of his last breaths as he withdraws from the kiss, and her feeling
it lingering on  her lips and imagining his very spirit there. Then when he dies
(as in the song, not  real life), the body they pull from the water has no
spirit -- no breath -- left. The  last of it she felt was what he left behind
with that last kiss. You can even go further,  since this is Houdini we're
talking about, and say that the great magician tricked  death through the ruse
of leaving his spirit on her lips, not taking it into the water  with him --
with a kiss, she passed the key that would allow him to escape eternity  &quot;Not
even eternity can hold Houdini.&quot; I know that's pushing it, but I like the 
thought. :-) 
</P>
<P>Sigh. But I am probably mishearing it -- all my recent listening has been
done  with an old cassette copy on a cheap tape player. My cd player and
turntable  (remember those?) are in storage while I build a new house. 
</P>
<P>What's everyone else think?
