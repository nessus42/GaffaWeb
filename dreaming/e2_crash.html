    <P>&quot;This song is about a brother and a sister who are in love, and the
      sister becomes pregnant by her brother. And because it is so taboo and
      unheard of, she kills herself in order to preserve her brother's name in
      the family. The actual song is in fact the suicide note. The sister is

    <P>&quot;I saw a programme with a camera man on the front line in Vietnam.
      The Vietnamese were portrayed as being very craftful people who treated
      their fighting as an art. They could literally smell the Americans coming
      through the jungle. Their culture of Coke cans and ice creams actually
      made them smell...Anyway, I learnt that before the Vietnamese went into
      action they popped a little silver Buddha in their mouths. I thought that
      was quite beautiful.&quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;The idea of the song is that of being given a glimpse of &quot;God&quot;
      something that we dearly want but being told that unless we work for it,
      we will never see it again, and even then, we might not be worthy of it.
      Of course, everybody wants the reward without the toil, so people try to
      find a way out of the hard work, still hoping to claim the prize, but such
      is not the case. The choruses are meant to express the feeling of entering
      timelessness as you become ready for the experience, but only when you are
      ready.&quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;The song was originally going to be called &quot;Dreamtime,&quot;
      which is the name the Aborigines gave to a magic time before man was man
      as he is today when man was an animal and could change shape. This magical
      time was also known as the Dreaming to the Aborigines, so I thought it
      would be an ideal title for the song.&quot; </P>

    <P> &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The whole idea of the song was that the choruses were this guy
      flying off. He's a pilot who's been offered a load of money if he doesn't
      ask any questions. He really wants to do it, for the challenge as well,
      but his wife is really against it because she feels he's going to get
      caught. The verses are her saying &quot;Don't do it!&quot; and the
      choruses are him saying &quot;Look, I can do it, I can fly like a swallow&quot;.
      We used the idea of the ceilidh band taking off. &quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;Although we are often surrounded by people and friends, we are all

      emotions away or being too scared to show love can lead to being lonely as
      well.&quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;And the song is written from Mrs. Houdini's point of view. And
      what was rather beautiful was she used to help him a lot with his tricks
      and one of the things that she would do, before he went off into his tank
      or to jump into the sea or whatever it was, she would pass him a tiny key
      with a kiss before she left him and he went off. And when he was then in
      the water he would use the key to unlock the padlocks. So in many ways by
      passing that key she was keeping an eye on his life, making sure that he
      be safe, that he would come out again.&quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;From the age of 11, Elton John was my biggest hero. I loved his
      music, had all his albums and I hoped one day I'd play the piano like him
      (I still do). When I was asked to be involved in this project and was
      given the choice of a track it was like being asked &quot;would you like
      to fulfill a dream? Would you like to be Rocket Man? ...yes, I would.&quot;
