<P>This is not confirmed, however, and in fact IED is not at all certain that
he ever  actually read this anywhere. It could have been a dream. (See, as many
of you will  not be surprised to learn, IED tends to have Kate Bushological
dream experiences at  any and all times of the day and night. It's very
distressing sometimes.)

<P> &gt;...some not subtle at all. I think the fact that Kate has refered to &quot;Night
of the  Swallow&quot; as &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot; should speak for itself on
where Kate thinks your  mind should be! 
</P>
<P>Douglas has made this sickening claim at least once before in this forum,
and once  again IED challenges Doug to provide proof that Kate actually said
this. IED doesn't  believe it. Not that it isn't possible that she might
conceivably say something like  that. It's just that one ought to have absolute
proof that she did say it before one  goes making assumptions about her sexual
humour in any general sense. IED will  gladly apologize for doubting Doug about
this citation if and when Doug offers real  tangible proof (page and line
number) that it is legitimate.

<P>From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt; <BR> Date: Wed, 23 Aug 89
21:13:37 EDT <BR> Subject: You bet your life! 
</P>
<P>&gt; From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu 
</P>
<P>&gt; Look, for the fiftieth time, IED doesn't claim that such
interpretations are  necessarily &quot;wrong&quot;. He doesn't care whether
they're wrong or right. The point is,  if Kate Bush tells us &quot;No, that's
wrong,&quot; then whether it makes sense in and of itself  becomes irrelevant.
IED used the term &quot;invalid&quot; as well, and that may have been a  misuse
of the word. But what he meant was and is clear: IED will entertain any  notion
about Kate's work that anyone wants to share with him, but if Kate Bush  tells
me it's wrong, IED will bloody well take her word for it. 
</P>
<P>Look, for the fiftieth time you have ignored the fact that not everyone
shares  your opinion about what is &quot;relevent&quot; and what isn't. So what
if you think discussion  ends with what Kate says? I don't agree, and you
haven't given a single shred of  argument to make me think that I should agree.
Discussion of what Kate intended  may indeed end with what Kate says, but
discussion of what something &quot;means&quot; may  very well not. Meaning is
not determined solely by what the originator of a  communication intends, but
also by what the receiver of that communication  interprets. If the the intended
meaning is different from the received meaning (and  neither the sender nor the
receiver are making mistakes) there is NO one true  meaning to the communication
-- there is only the &quot;intended meaning&quot; and the  &quot;understood
meaning&quot;. If we were going to insist that there be a &quot;one true meaning&quot;
 (which I don't think is a good idea) to any communication, we would want to 
attribute it to the interpretation that makes the most sense -- not the intended
 meaning. The intended meaning in most cases is most likely to be the one that
makes  the most sense, but this is not always true. 
</P>
<P>Since you seem to like to quote John Carder Bush at me, IED, how about if I
do  the same to you. He seems to think that interpretations unintended by Kate
are fine  and wonderful things. This is what he said to me about it (and you
know it because  I've already told you): 
</P>
<P>&quot;Entendres are, indeed, interesting things. Over the years I have
evolved a sort of  personal understanding of this planet / God / life in terms
of rhyme. If you can see  the Supreme Being as merely a harmonizing force, then
coincidence, synchronicity  are easily explained; as the poet makes his rhymes,
the pattern of life makes its  rhymes. And in double, tripple, or whatever,
entendres, the poet exercises a god-like  technique. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Keeping this in mind, I feel that for someone working in an artistic
medium, and  thence becoming &quot;godlike&quot;, by imitation, there must come
a series of levels of  progress, each level preceded by intense periods of
obsession and worry with the  creation -- late nights, wrong food, ill health,
etc. -- and at each level something  crystallises, and an energy vortex with a
consciousness of its own starts going. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Once it is able to generate its own creative direction, it needs to be
fed and  looked after like any machine, but it can be relied on to offer up an
image, a line, in  which the levels are all there, up and down, and can be
understood depending on the  level of the receiver. Sufi strories, Zen stories,
Greek myths all have this spiralling  mult-interpretation power, as do all the
great written works of religion. You can  keep coming back to them and finding
the next level confirmed as you grow. 
</P>
<P>&quot;So I am sure you are right when you find these meanings in Kate's
music, but  whether it was conscious or unconscious is not important if you
accept that she is a  vehicle for the Great Rhymer. Kate's subject matter for
her lyrics has always been  extraordinary, which I think comes from an ability
to empathise with life forms that  is unusually sensitive.&quot; 
</P>
<P>So the short of it is, Andy, you may not want to talk about meanings of art
not  intended by the author, but who the f*** are you to tell me that I and
others  shouldn't -- especially when I explicitly say that the interpretation I
am discussing  was not intended by the author? 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; ...some not subtle at all. I think the fact that Kate has refered
to &quot;Night of the  Swallow&quot; as &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot; should speak
for itself on where Kate thinks your  mind should be! 
</P>
<P>&gt; Douglas has made this sickening claim at least once before in this
forum, and  once again IED challenges Doug to provide proof that Kate actually
said this. IED  doesn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>Andy, you never challenged me the first time I made this claim. I'll tell
you  what, though. I'll again bet you a round trip plane ticket to London for
the next  time Kate tours that I can produce the magazine and page number within
a month.  Just keep in mind that it was a good idea that you didn't take me up
on this offer  with repect to Gaffer's tape. I don't make up things like this,
Andy, and you do  nothing to increase your credibility by constantly challenging
me on issues like this  and losing. 
</P>
<P>Now, I can't guarantee that the pun wasn't introduced by the interviewer or
by  the editorial staff of the magazine, but I can guarantee that I have an
interview  where, as it appears in print, Kate refers to &quot;Night of the
Swallow&quot; as &quot;Nice to  Swallow&quot;. And it's in a major British
periodical, not some fly-by-night rag. If you  don't wish to place the bet,
however, I have better things to do that wade through  an entire filing cabinet
full of articles on Kate, searching for one line, just because  you don't
believe me. 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; Then again, Kate spelled Orgonon wrong by mistake.... 
</P>
<P>&gt; IED is even more predisposed to mistrust Doug's citation re &quot;Nice
to Swallow&quot;  in light of his false claim immediately above. The fact is
that John Carder Bush was  once asked point blank about this very &quot;mis&quot;-spelling.
IED quotes his eminently  Bushian reply: &quot;It may have been intentional...&quot;
Furthermore, Doug knows this,  since IED has posted the information at least
once before. And it may very well be a  pun. 
</P>
<P>Well, I asked Kate, *HERSELF*, and she said that the misspelling was NOT 
intentional. By your very own reasoning, Mr. Marvick, the discussion is over.
QED,  IED.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: More of the same 
</P>
<P>Finally, regarding this &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot; business. IED expressed
skepticism  about the accuracy of your attribution of these words to Kate, and
he asked you to  substantiate it. IED didn't expect that his request for
substantiation was not to be  had unless he put up collateral ! The statement
which you ascribe to Kate is so  unlike her, is so extraordinarily
uncharacteristic, that IED doesn't feel it to be  unreasonable of him to ask you
to support or withdraw the citation. He doesn't see  why he should have to make
a bet out of it. When IED quotes Kate he nearly always  offers the source
voluntarily, and when he doesn't, he is always ready to search for  the source
on request. And when he can't, he admits that it is only a vague memory  which
he cannot place. He thinks you ought to be willing to make the same  commitment
to your quotations of Kate that IED makes. 
</P>
<P>However, if you can come up with the actual quotation, and it sticks to Kate
 unequivocally and to IED's satisfaction, IED will publicly state that &quot;:&gt;oug
Alan  knows more about Kate than IED does or ever will, so help IED God.&quot;
How's that?  You'd have to admit that would be quite a coup to score over IED.
But airline  tickets? Come on, be reasonable. 
</P>
<P>IED would just like to add that he doesn't think it unreasonable of him to
doubt  your attribution of this phrase to Kate in light of the fact that your
idea of a proper  source for substantiation of Russian-language idioms is a
Certs commercial. 
</P>
<P>IED stands in awe of your ability to remember previously unmentioned 
statements Kate made to you which just happen to contradict the current position
 IED has taken against you, :&gt;oug. However, he will accept your word that
Kate  actually said &quot;No, I just made a mistake and spelled it wrong.&quot;
Of course, she was  saying &quot;No&quot; to just about every suggestion you
made that day...

23:18:27 EDT <BR> Subject: Even more of the same 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, I never have nor do I now believe that received meaning has  &quot;greater
credibility&quot; than the intended one. At the time I interviewed Kate, what I 
believed, for some of the answers Kate gave, was not that my interpretations had
any  more validity than what Kate intended, but rather that Kate *really* did
intend my  interpretations and that she just wouldn't admit it because she was
trying to be  difficult and mysterious. 
</P>
<P>For years, however, I have not believed this peculiar delusion, even though
it *is*  quite evident that at times Kate is purposely difficult. Take, as
example, her avoiding  of the issue when I asked her how she does her
interesting backwards-forwards  vocals. All she would say is that it is a lot of
work, despite me asking several times.  When Kate wants to be difficult,
however, she has a way of expertly avoiding the  issue and never really
answering the question. I truly doubt if she ever just  straight-out lies,
though. 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; Well, I asked Kate, *HERSELF*, and she said that the misspelling
was NOT  intentional. By your very own reasoning, Mr. Marvick, the discussion is

</P>
<P>Mr. Marvick, you are really starting to get on my nerves. I have mentioned
the  above statement in the past in this very forum, and I am sure the archives
will prove  it. It is obvious that your memory is beginning to fail you. And
such a shame at such  a young age. I did not ask Kate about the spelling of &quot;Organon&quot;
*that day*, but  rather I asked her the next day when she appeared at Tower
Records. It was the  only question I asked her as I handed her my Japanese
import of *The Dreaming* to  be autographed, so I remember the question and her
answer quite well: 
</P>
<P>DOUG: You might not remember me... but I interviewed you yesterday. 
</P>
<P>[Boy, I was pathetic back then, wasn't I, eh?] 
</P>
<P>KATE: Of course I remember you. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Can I ask you another question? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Yes. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Is there any particular reason why you spelled &quot;Organon&quot;
differently on  your liner notes than Reich spelled it? 
</P>
<P>Kate smiles in a way that gently says, &quot;Where do you come up with all
these silly  questions?&quot; 
</P>
<P>KATE: It wasn't intentional. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: It wasn't? 
</P>
<P>KATE: No. 
</P>
<P>I hand Kate my record and Kate goes to autograph it... 
</P>
<P>KATE: I'm sorry... I've forgotten your name... 
</P>
<P>DOUG: It's &quot;Doug&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Kate signs the record and hands it back to me. It says &quot;To Doug, Love
Kate Bush&quot;. 
</P>
<P>DOUG: Thank you. 
</P>
<P>I walk away and curse myself for again making myself a fool in front of
Kate. 
</P>
<P>But I spot John Carder Bush and am able to talk to him somewhat
intelligently  about *Brazil* and about how Kate does her two way messages
(which Kate herself  would say nothing about).

17:04:02 EDT <BR> Subject: Nice to Swallow 
</P>
<P>I got inspired last night and pulled down all my boxes of Kate Bush
paraphilnalia  (I hurt my back doing it too!) and searched through all my
magazines, meticulously  searching for the interview where Kate refers to &quot;Night
of the Swallow&quot; as &quot;Nice to  Swallow&quot;. I searched most intensely
where I thought I'd find it, but it was to no  avail. Just as I was about to
give up, I spotted another magazine that was vaguely  similar in size, color,
and shape to the magazine I had expected to find it in, so I  looked in there,
and there it was! 
</P>
<P>So, here is the quote that IED stubbornly refused to believe existed. I hope
that  IED will give me the *HUGE* apology that he promised. It is from *Sounds
Fan  Library No. 9: Lady Killers*. Pat Benetar is on the cover. Inside there is
an interview  with Kate (among lots of other junk), and on page 35, Kate
comments on all of her  albums. These are the comments on *The Dreaming*: 
</P>
<P>Again I'm very fond of this because it's my latest and because it represents
 *total* control, owing to the fact that I produced it by myself. It's the
hardest thing  I've ever done -- it was even harder than touring! The whole
experience was very  worrying, very frightening but at the same time very
rewarding. 
</P>
<P>It took a long time to do but I think there are some very intense songs and
the  ones I like best of all are 'Nice To Swallow', 'Houdini', and 'Get Out'.
All in all, I  was very proud of this record. 
</P>
<P>I am NEVER going to this much trouble again to counter IED's disbelief of my
 perfect knowledge. Twice is enough.

<P>Undoubtedly IED will mention this, but just in case he doesn't, I can't help
but  get the impression that perhaps the person who wrote the above &quot;quote&quot;
in that  magazine misheard Kate. If the person transcribing the interview was
not all that  familiar with Kate's work (which it seems they often are not), and
did not take the  time to check what he thought he heard with the titles on the
album, then the Nice  to Swallow reading might easily have come about. A
Freudian slip, perhaps?  Indicative of what the interviewer might have been
thinking about while  interviewing Kate? Nawwww...

<P>Well, if I remember correctly, the section on Kate's albums had a little
picture of  each album and a full track listing. Also, they didn't get any of
the other song titles  wrong, so I see no reason to assume that this is a
misprint. I can't imagine anyone  hearing &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; as &quot;Nice
to Swallow&quot; -- the people who do these  interviews *do* use tape recorders,
you know, and can check to make sure they  transcribed properly. Furthermore,
Kate has a pecluliar sense of humor, and this  pun is exactly the kind I'd
expect to hear from Kate. I can't for the life of me  understand why anyone
would think Kate wouldn't say this. Are you all so prudish?

no  comment made about it. If the interviewer knew enough to recognize that Kate

</P>
<P>I went back and reread the entire interview where the &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot;
quote  appears. The interviewer is clearly a fan of Kate's. In it he says that
he has always  liked Kate's music a lot, but when *The Dreaming* first came out,
he didn't like it.  After repeated listenings, however, he came to the
conclusion that it was Kate's  most inspired album yet. In light of this, it is
clear that if the &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot;  quote was an error, it was NOT
introduced by the interviewer. This leaves only the  typesetters. It is possible
that the typesetters could make such an error, but it seems  quite unlikely that
they would make an error that turned out to be such a  provocative pun.

message news 
</P>
<P>Jon Drukman, you don't know what the f*ck you're talking about. Doug did 
indeed state--as a fact--that Kate had made that statement about Nice to Swallow
 herself, in jest. When he said that, IED denied that she had said that. It was
then  that Doug qualified his statement with the equivocating remark he
re-posted as  &quot;proof&quot; of his intellectual caution yesterday. IED,
unfortunately, does not keep  records going that far back, so no doubt Doug will
choose to disbelieve me (since  IED has disbelieved Doug many times in the past,
this may well be poetic justice),  but there is no doubt in IED's mind that
Doug's original reference to the &quot;Nice to  Swallow&quot; nonsense was that &quot;Kate
once said&quot; this. 
</P>
<P>It is true that Doug deserves some credit for finding the &quot;quote&quot;.
However, IED  has now followed suit and checked the same source himself. What
did he discover?  Well, mainly that, contrary to Doug's say-so, the magazine in
question is typically  loaded with errors of English! (This should not come as a
surprise to readers of  Doug's own postings.) It is therefore not the least bit
improbable that a similar error  was made by the editors of the magazine in this
case. More likely still is that the  interviewer simply misheard Kate saying &quot;
Night of the Swallow &quot; and wrote it out as  &quot; Nice to Swallow &quot;.
Since the editing on that rag was not very good, and the chances  in any event
of anyone on the editorial staff noticing that a Bush title had been 
misrepresented were slim, it is extremely likely on the face of it that the
words were  simply one of many errors that slipped through. 
</P>
<P>But we have far more than that to support that hypothesis! IED is sick and
tired  of idiotic claims to the effect that such a &quot;joke&quot; is &quot;in
character&quot; with other remarks  Kate Bush has made. IT IS NOT! No one has
ever implied, Doug and Jon, that Kate  is a prude. Obviously, she is not! The
point is not whether she is afraid of using  so-called &quot;censorable language&quot;
or sexual imagery. The point is whether she would  make a crude, vulgar, self
-denigrating joke of her own serious work! And the  answer is, so far as we can
tell from the millions of words on file from her to date,  NO SHE WOULDN'T. She
never has ! 
</P>
<P>Douglas and Jon, however, have already long since shown to this group that
their  own crude and vulgar sense of humour renders them utterly incapable of 
distinguishing a straightforward, descriptive use of language (as in &quot;Because
you can  see my tits&quot;) from a powerfully poetic, imagistic use of language
(as in &quot;The sheets  are soaked by your tiny fish&quot;) from a crude,
gratuitous and utterly uncharacteristic  bathroom joke like &quot;Nice to
Swallow&quot;. Thankfully, most of the rest of Love-Hounds  can see the
differences, so with luck we can go on to another subject now.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: In thE nAme of liTeracy and
WORthy kate bushological stuDieS... 
</P>
<P>One could safely hope, were one dealing with a less pathetically stubborn 
opponent than |&gt;oug, that he would now be willing to concede the extreme
likelihood  that the interviewer in Lady-Killers mistook Kate's words &quot;
Night of the Swallow &quot;  for the absurd and completely uncharacteristic &quot;Nice
to Swallow&quot; just as |&gt;oug  himself mistook Kate's word &quot;audially&quot;
for the glaringly improbable and  uncharacteristic (not to say nonsensical and
far less grammatically sound) word  &quot;ordurely&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The fact is that people do mishear words. Some of them will take the trouble
to  question their hearing when they register what seems to be nonsense.
Others--such  as |&gt;ouglas and his equals, the editors of Lady- Killers --will
not bother. What more  graphic evidence is needed than |&gt;oug's gross
above-cited editorial error--and the  wildly false, scatalogical and altogether
inappropriate conclusions he reaches on its  unsound basis--to prove IED's point
that the ascription of &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot; to Kate  by the Lady-Killers
staff is, to a virtual certainty, a similar mistake by unthinking,  careless
people? But knowing |&gt;oug too well--as we all do--to expect him to admit  his
error graciously, IED will have to present more evidence--and so he shall now. 
</P>
<P>Contrary to |&gt;oug's recent claim that his tawdry source for the false &quot;Nice
to  Swallow&quot; quotation--the magazine Lady-Killers --is relatively free of
mistakes, it is,  in fact, swamped in a veritable sea of them! In fact, even
within the short excerpt  relevant to this discussion no fewer than six
misspelled song-titles can be found, as  well as at least one other misspelled
word! Among the errors are &quot;Don't Push Your  Foot on the Hearbreak&quot;, &quot;james
And The Cold Gun&quot;, &quot;Favourtie tracks&quot;, and  &quot;Symphoney in
Blue&quot;. Mind you, this is within a span of fewer than 500 words, in a 
section specifically devoted to and primarily consisting of a listing of Kate's
songs! 
</P>
<P>Two conclusions must be drawn. The first is that given the amazingly poor 
copy-editing in the magazine (IED has chosen to list only a few errors, and only
 from among those that are found in one isolated passage--literally dozens and 
dozens of other errors, some far more obvious, are strewn throughout the rest of
the  publication's text), it is not the least bit unlikely that an oversight by
the inept and  careless copy-editors allowed the retention of the mistaken
reference to Night of the  Swallow as &quot;Nice to Swallow&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The second conclusion is that |&gt;oug Alan begins to look more and more
like the  worst and most harmful type of illiterate: the type whose status as a
student in a  good school has led him to consider that he is not the illiterate
he is, and who,  buoyed by that false, unmerited self-confidence, feels free to
spout off his mouth on  subjects which might very well do undeserved damage to
the reputations of  worthier people than himself--in this case, Kate Bush. What
he needs is a good  high-school-level English course, so that he can acquire at
least a minimal degree of  language skills (not to mention some much-needed
humility) before he should again  be tempted to tell others how unimportant the
rules are and to cite as legitimate  authorities for bogus Kate Bush quotes (and
as the foundation for more of his  bathroom-oriented theories about Kate's works
and statements) sources as sloppy  and linguistically ignorant as himself.

</P>
<P>Hello there Larry and other fellow Love-Hounds--
</P>
<P> After reading Larry's recent letter to IED, in which IED more or less got 
flamed for flaming others, I'd like to say this: 
</P>
<P>IED, I gotta agree with Larry on this one. I mean, don't get me wrong, you
are  certainly one of the most knowledgable Love-Hounds when it comes to KT (and
I  know you have personally helped me with some needed info), but PLEASE don't 
say that others are ignorant and wrong if they don't happen to share your
opinions.  As much as I love Kate's music, she ISN'T perfect... she's just a
very talented  HUMAN BEING, not a goddess. 
</P>
<P>And I DO find most of the discussions that go on in Love-Hounds to be 
interesting and all that... but I get damn sick and tired of hearing people
quibble  endlessly by saying &quot;No, Kate means this in these lyrics&quot; and
&quot;NO, shes means  THIS...&quot; To tell you the truth, I ain't gonna believe
NOTHIN' about her lyrics one  way or the other until I hear the lady explain
them herself. Only SHE of ANYONE  will be able to explain &quot;what she means
here in these lyrics&quot;, and not any of us. All  we are here to do is love
Kate's music and her beauty and her talent, and not to  judge others. 
</P>
<P>PLEASE try not to take this personally. I just think we should find other,
more  constructive ways of filling the Love-Hounds Digest. 
</P>
<P>I've said m'piece... 
</P>
<P> All the best...to EVERYONE,

<P>Date: Fri, 08 Dec 89 13:58 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Are temperatures finally
descending? Not so fast... 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Julian for his formula. It seems to IED to be an excellent means
to an  end: the end being the development of a capacity in various trigger-happy
 Love-Hounds like Drukman to support their criticisms with examples of how the 
flaws which they claim exist in Kate's work could be fixed. It's an excellent
idea,  Julian. (IED also agrees with you about 2001.) 
</P>
<P>IED didn't, Julian is right in pointing out, succeed in explaining his idea
of  &quot;perfection&quot; in Kate's work, or in art in general. That's because
he doesn't really  know how. What he was trying to get at was that &quot;perfection&quot;
in art may not  actually be definable as a parallel to &quot;perfection&quot; in
other aspects of reality. IED  meant to say that there may indeed be &quot;flaws&quot;
of a technical or even of an expressive  kind in some of Kate's work; but he
questions not only whether their removal or  &quot;correction&quot; would &quot;improve&quot;
the work, but also whether those &quot;flaws&quot; are evidence  of imperfection
at all. Perhaps they--like the evil which religious people cannot  explain, but
which through their faith in God's omniscience they assume must have  a
purpose--are aspects of the Perfect Work which we mere listeners cannot 
understand. 
</P>
<P>This religion analogy is dangerously misleading, however, because IED does
not  --he wants to emphasize again--consider Kate herself to be any kind of
Godlike  figure at all. IED does suspect, however, that there is in Kate's work
--as perhaps in  all parts of our universe--an element of some kind of
indefinable, eternal perfection.  IED doesn't see this aspect of existence in
many things, nor does he experience it  often, but he does believe that it
exists in all of Kate's work. To draw a prosaic  parallel, so (in IED's view)
does it exist in all of Mozart's or Beethoven's  works--their minor, even
awkward early pieces and potboilers included. Wherever  the hand of the
supernatural touches the hand of an artist (or the hand of any  creator or any
object of nature), perhaps there is a spark of perfection which the  &quot;flaws&quot;
obtained through transcription to our mundane plane cannot extinguish. 
</P>
<P>So IED is offering a somewhat different definition of &quot;perfection&quot;
than Julian's,  therefore: cannot perfection in a work of art exist with &quot;flaws&quot;
in its final  presentation? Is not the property of &quot;perfection&quot; in a
work of art real in spite of the  human imperfections which that work will
inevitably acquire in the process of  transcription from the spark to the page?
For does the kernel of a great work of art  lie in its pigments and
brushstrokes, in its DX-7 and Ampex-master? Or does it hide  in some richer,
deeper, more ephemeral and less definable region? 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, one can still request that those who see faults in a work of
art point  to specific properties that they find wanting in it, and to explain
how those might  have been improved upon by the artist. Otherwise, how can the
critics expect to  convince their listener of the acuity of their judgement? 
</P>
<P>IED realizes that he still hasn't defined perfection itself--whether it be
found in  the work's final form or contained in its conception only. Even in the
latter case  Julian's formula may apply, but if so, IED would have no way of
testing it, given his  inexperience with divine phenomena and consequent
inability to analyze them.

<P>Date: Mon, 11 Dec 89 12:51 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: A note from Andy about IED:
please skip if the issue bores you 
</P>
<P> I'm breaking out of my IED mode for a moment to explain something about 
what's been going on here in Love-Hounds. A number (I hope a pretty small 
number) of readers have decided that IED is behaving like a total jerk nowadays,
 and there have even been several calls to boot him out of the group. I want to 
apologize for some of his words, and also to explain a couple things which some 
Love-Hounds readers may not be aware of. 
</P>
<P>First, IED is basically a bastard. He always has been and always will be.
But  neither I (Andy) nor he (IED) has ever denied that. It may be true that IED
didn't  seem particularly unpleasant until recent months, but that's because
there wasn't  much going on to bring out the worst in him. 
</P>
<P>Why the third person? Why the alter-ego? It was originally just a joke (that
was  more than four years ago). Just about the first discussion that went on in
L-Hs after  I joined the group was about Wilhelm Reich. I was a little offended
that several  contributors were trashing Reich's work--and even Kate's
song--because they said  he was just a charlatan, etc. I defended Reich with
such enthusiasm that I found  myself taking on Reich's own pedantic,
heavy-handed style. (Anyone who is  wondering can read some of Reich's late
papers on orgone energy to discover  exactly the style IED tries to imitate.)
The big picture is: Reich was really crazy ; so  is IED! See? IED is crazy?
Nutso. A fruitcake. His character is modeled on my own  (limited) understanding
of Reich's own form of paranoid psychotic delusional  personality. 
</P>
<P>My main argument (as IED) in defense of Reich was that while yes, he was 
certainly bonkers when he wrote about deadly orgone radiation, etc., his
delusions  were, in their own way, beautiful, and their expression had artistic
merit. I also  argued that Reich's premises, while obviously insane, were backed
up by at least an  internal logic which could not be assailed. In other words,
while there might have  been madness in his method, there was method in his
madness, too. I concluded that  this made Reich's work worth looking into and
respecting on its own terms, and not  something to be dismissed out of hand as
pseudo-science. 
</P>
<P>I think it's worth mentioning that, at the time, no one else in the group
had ever  bothered to read any of Reich's late papers, or at least no one ever
acknowledged  having done so. All of the critics of Reich in Love-Hounds
then--as most of the  critics of the new KT album now --based their opinions on
(in my opinion) quick  judgements and unfair comparisons of the work to other
works, instead of on a  consideration of the work's own internal logic and
beauty. (I think Neil Calton's  latest posting makes exactly the same point,
though of course in more reasonable  language than IED has been making it. My
thanks to you, Neil.) 
</P>
<P>From that whole early experience with Love-Hounds, I learned that, partly by
 the nature of the computer-forum and partly because of the background and 
character of the people who led its discussions, IED was probably never going to
be  able to convince anyone of the internal validity of his own personal
viewpoint.  Eventually I also learned that there would probably never be a
reader in this group  who would be able to see Kate's work from quite the same
perspective that IED did,  and that all the verbal arguments in the world would
fail to convince anyone of  IED's viewpoint. (As it happens, I was wrong about
that: there seems to be at least  one Lion-Heart who shares some of IED's
convictions.) 
</P>
<P>This put me more than ever in a position of empathy toward Reich himself. He
 too held a view of the world and nature which virtually no one cared to
understand,  and which is now generally ridiculed for its craziness, rather than
appreciated for its  beauty. 
</P>
<P>I also came to admire in Reich his steadfast attitude, his loyalty to his
ideas, and  his stubborn refusal to be dragged down to the level of the
disbelievers (as he saw  them). At this stage I decided that I should keep IED
around, and give him a place to  live, so to speak, through the agency of this
computer forum. 
</P>
<P>I expected then, as I do now, that IED would not be liked very much. I also 
expected that he would be made fun of, and patronized as overly obsessive and 
closed-minded. And I also could see that IED's zealous belief would probably get
 out of hand at times, and that he could make enemies through his propensity to 
attack--sometimes more fiercely than was called for. 
</P>
<P>I also knew that IED wouldn't see it that way, but that IED would usually
make  a sincere effort to explain his opinions and to give real evidence for his
positions  whenever possible. Should I have silenced him completely because of
his occasional  accesses of vitriol? I didn't think so then, and I still don't
now. 
</P>
<P>Naturally, there were a lot of objections to the very notion of an &quot;IED&quot;
in  Love-Hounds. For a while there was a pretty fierce campaign to force me to
stop  hiding behind the IED facade. Naturally this made IED all the more adamant
about  sticking around--and I can't say I blame him! 
</P>
<P>I think, generally speaking, I've made IED a pretty useful character in this
group  over the last four years. I've put him to work time and again
transcribing interviews  and reporting news whenever he had some, simply for the
benefit of Love-Hounds'  readers. I don't claim any special credit for this
service, because obviously I've  enjoyed giving it--it hasn't been a heavy
responsibility for me, but a sincere  pleasure, and one which many recent
contributors obviously know themselves. It's  nice to belong to a group, and to
help broaden people's knowledge of a commonly  appreciated subject of interest,
and IED likes that experience as much as you all do. 
</P>
<P>In exchange (aside from the more or less recent side-benefit of finding more
and  more new contributors to this group who provide really interesting and
helpful  information for the readers--a renewed thanks to Ed, Neil and Tippi,
for example),  though, I think it's only fair that I be allowed to keep IED
alive and to allow him his  say about Kate, from his own, er...unusual
perspective. 
</P>
<P>Yes, as IED I can be annoying, overbearing and pompous. And yes, IED's 
raison-d'etre (that everything Kate does is absolutely beyond criticism and
perfect)  is over-the-top, even just plain nuts. But I think he has represented
and continues to  communicate a very important and under-represented point of
view in this forum.  And with all the critics of Kate who like to contribute
their opinions to Love-Hounds  nowadays, I can't really believe that IED's lone
voice of angry dissent is too much  for them to bear. 
</P>
<P>So yeah, IED is a pain in the ass. I apologize for him if his opinions have
become a  bit &quot;personal&quot; recently, though the way IED sees it, he was
only replying in kind,  and in response to an unusually high degree of criticism
of Kate--the rebuttal of  which is his be-all and end-all. But unless a majority
of the readers of Love-Hounds  agree that the group should get rid of him, IED
will remain for the time being.  Perhaps you should take a poll or something.
