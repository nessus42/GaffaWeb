<P>Vickie here, 
</P>
<P>I just talked to Peter David Fitzgerald-Morris (professor of Kate Bushology
and  Homeground fellow) and he told me that Kate wrote a song for an episode of
The  Comic Strip. [GLC] 
</P>
<P>Also very, very neat: in a few weeks Kate herself will appear in an episode
of  The Comic Strip called &quot;Les Dogs.&quot; Peter described it as a &quot;Fellini-esque
film about  a self-obsessed man who had a car crash, wandered into a wedding
reception and  falls in love with the bride. As far as we understand, Kate is
actually the bride&quot;!!!!!! 
</P>
<P>So Neil &amp; all you other British lovehounds, be sure to tell us how it
all goes.

<P>From: Stephen Thomas &lt;spt1@ukc.ac.uk&gt; <BR> Date: 8 Mar 90 23:29:33
GMT <BR> Subject: Les Dogs 
</P>
<P>Hello everyone. 
</P>
<P>About 45 minutes ago, as I write, the BBC aired the programme that featured 
Kate in her first ever acting role. As any gaffan who has been reading will
know,  this was called &quot;Les Dogs&quot;, and was part of the latest Comic
Strip series. As everyone  on the other side of the pond is expecting a summary
to be posted, I am doing just  that. I shall post a description as best I can
remember, and then say what I thought  of her. 
</P>
<P>LES DOGS 
</P>
<P>The programme was rather surreal, to say the least - it almost defies
description.  Nevertheless, I shall do my best. Certain parts of my narrative
may be badly  sequenced - I am sure people with better memories will put me
right. I shall be  missing out trivial parts anyway. 
</P>
<P>After some initial opening scenes, we find ourselves on a highway, panning
over  the scene of a crash, between a beat up old blue van (with LES DOGS in red
letters  on the side) and a Jaguar. The driver of the Jag (a chauffer (sp?)) is
dead, but his  boss [Peter Richardson] on the back seat is still alive and whole
and is conducting a  business deal. He finishes it, then tries to attract the
attention of the driver and fails.  He then reaches over, into the drivers
jacket, and removes his wallet. He says  something like &quot;I just need some
money for a taxi - the rest I shall send to your wife  - I shall post it myself.&quot;
He leaves the car, and we see that the highway is totally  empty. He sets off
into the countryside by the highway. 
</P>
<P>The man (whose name is Victor, BTW) is walking through the countryside. In 
order to keep his shoes clean, he has removed them (and his socks) and is
carrying  them while walking barefoot. Eventually he comes to a hotel. Putting
his shoes and  socks back on (over his muddy feet) he walks in to one of the
reception suites, to  find that there is a wedding reception going on. He looks
around. 
</P>
<P>The two families are arranged on two separate tables, facing each other, and
it is  obvious that there is a huge degree of animosity going on. The best man
[Adrian  Edmondson] is, in a wimpish way, reading his speech (which is truly
excruciating).  Eventually Victor's eyes alight upon - you guessed it - Kate
herself. She is the bride,  and her name is Angela Watkins. She is rather
beautiful in a patiently happy sort of  way, dressed in a white wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, while the best man drones on, her new husband starts caressing her
and  kissing her. She accepts this with all signs of happiness. His hands and
face are  covered with some sort of reddish-brown powder (like cinnamon), and he
leaves  stains on her face and dress. 
</P>
<P>The best man realises he is terminally boring and wraps up his speech with a
 toast, which everyone ignores. The animosity between the two families goes up 
several notches as we watch in silence. Finally, the bride's father [Alexei
Sayle]  stands up and says that the groom is a worthless lump of rubbish (using
slightly  stronger words) and he only let his daughter go because it was what
she wanted and  he loved her, but he was thinking of putting a stop to it NOW.
The groom's father  [Tim McKinnery (sp?)] stands up and says that the groom [I
forget the name of the  actor and the character] is the best catch of the county
and that the bride only led  him on until he was forced to marry her in order to
get her to bed. 
</P>
<P>Then the bride's father pulls out a gun and shoots the groom's father in the
arm.  This is a signal for all the guests to push over the tables and all start
shooting at each  other across the tables. In the confusion, but observed by
Victor, the newlyweds  leave by a back door. 
</P>
<P>The scene shifts to a separate room in the hotel, where a buffet meal is
being  prepared for the guests. Victor enters, possibly in search of the bride.
The bride's  mother [Miranda Richardson] asks Victor to do the wedding
photographs, as the  real photographer had to leave. We then seem him outside
with the camera,  arranging the bride and groom for the photo - or rather just
focussing on the bride  and trying to move the groom out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>The scene then changes to the couple in their honeymoon suite in the hotel, 
where they are unwrapping gifts. Someone has given them a truly obnoxious
talking  doll. They both find this highly amusing. 
</P>
<P>We next see Victor wandering around the hotel, again in search of her. He
sees  her going through a door further along the corridor, and starts hurrying
after her,  but never catches up. He almost does when she goes into a lift
[elevator], but it  closes before he can get in it with her. He rushes up the
stairs to be there to meet  her, but when the lift opens, she isn't there -
there is someone else he doesn't  know. 
</P>
<P>A bit later, after a bit more wandering, Victor encounters a small crowd of 
people gathered around someone. It is the bride, who has obviously fainted, just
 outside the honeymoon suite. He claims to be a doctor, picks her up and carries
her  into the suite. 
</P>
<P>There he gently lays her on the bed and goes into the bathroom, where he
takes  of his shoes and socks and washes his feet (still muddy) in the bidet.
Just as he is  finishing, he notices through the open door of the bathroom a
small child in nappies  [diapers] on a tricycle wander past, looking at him
curiously. The child wanders out  of sight. 
</P>
<P>The next thing is that Kate comes into the bathroom, in normal housewife 
clothes, and starts talking to Victor as if he is her lover, whom she is
planning to run  away with - leave her husband and children, because she loves
Victor. Victor is  confused by this. [BTW, this is the first time Kate speaks -
I was wondering if she  was going to say anything at all!] They then start
caressing each other and just as  things start to get really interesting - she
disappears. She was never there. It was all  his imagination. 
</P>
<P>He then notices some strange noises coming from outside the bathroom. He 
leaves and finds that he is in the home of Angela and her husband, with her
father,  at a Christmas party. Victor is welcomed as a family friend without
whom the party  would be incomplete. She says she has something to show Victor,
and leads him  away, but before he follows her, the husband takes Victor aside,
and says something  like he really loves her, and if she left him, it would
destroy him. 
</P>
<P>We then have a scene change. It is late at night and Victor is standing
dressed in a  Santa Claus outfit in the middle of the house's family room.
Everyone else has  obviously gone to bed. He seems to have just awoken, as if he
had been standing  asleep. He looks around and finds the obnoxious doll
mentioned earlier. It  encourages him that she is his for the taking. 
</P>
<P>He goes upstairs and finds her in bed with her husband, asleep. She is lying
on  her side. He goes over and reaches out for her, and she wakes up. Her eyes
open and  a very bright light shines out. He is drawn to these twin beams and is
pulled down  into them ... 
</P>
<P>... and we hear the crashing of metal and glass as the car he was being
driven in  collides with an oncoming vehicle, the van. The whole thing had been
some sort of  before-dying, last-moments dream. 
</P>
<P>OK, that is more or less it. You may be wondering where the title comes
from. It  was the name of a French glam heavy metal band who had been hired to
do the  music for the reception. They had refused to go on whilst the guests
were shooting,  until the lead singer was coerced in a rather painful fashion.
Of course, they were all  killed. 
</P>
<P>KATE 
</P>
<P>So what was she like? I thought she was OK, but she was definitely showing
her  age a bit - although this does not really matter. To my relatively
untrained eye, she  showed signed that this sort of acting was not entirely
natural to her - or perhaps  she was not used to it, would be a better way of
putting it. 
</P>
<P>Although she was one of the lead characters, she was not actually called
upon to  do much - the other characters acted around her. Still, she looked very
good, and  she fitted the part of the bride perfectly. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, I am tired, so I shall sign off and let others give their opinions.
Thank  you for putting up with me. 
</P>

<P>From: nbc%INF.RL.AC.UK@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Date: Fri, 9 Mar 90 13:08:23 BST
<BR> Subject: The Comic Strip Presents 
</P>
<P>Well Kate certainly chose an unusual start to her acting career. The &quot;Les
Dogs&quot;  episode of The Comic Strip Presents was shown last night and to my
mind was one  of their most bizarre and elliptical shows ever. One always
expects the unusual when  the Comic Strip are involved but this episode was more
convoluted than usual. Three  of the Strip's regulars (French, Saunders and
Planer) were totally absent with guest  artists dominating the show (see full
cast list posted earlier), which added to the  sense of strangeness. 
</P>
<P>The plot (sic) is hard to describe in a way that would make much sense on
paper  (cathode) and while Kate was featured from start to end, it was only in
the last 5  minutes or so that she actually spoke. 
</P>
<P>  Synopsis 
</P>
<P>A proclamation on TV by a Leader that cars (later TVs are mentioned) will be
 banned. People runs into the streets and into their cars. On a deserted road a
limo  has crashed with a van carrying a punk group (Les Dogs). The chauffeur of
the limo  is dead, a business man (Victor) in the limo walks away and ends up in
a wedding  reception at a hotel where two sets of motley guests listen in stoney
silence to the  best man's speech. 
</P>
<P>The groom (Jeff), face covered in chocolate, kisses and licks the face of
his bride  (Angela) [Yes it was Kate being thus defiled!] much to the chagrin of
the bride's  father who stands up and besmirches the groom and his family.
Provoked by this the  groom's father launches his own verbal tirade against the
bride and her family. This  is the cue for an all out gun battle to commence
between the male guests on either  side. The women retire to a side room and the
caterers continue to serve drinks  amid the ensuing mayhem. The bride's mother
persuades the French punk group  Les Dogs, booked to provide the music, to play
by grabbing the leader's private  parts and making him an offer he couldn't
refuse! 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile the business man is asked to take the wedding photographs as the 
hired photographer has vanished. His attention grabbed by the beautiful bride,
he  agrees and takes photos of the bride and groom on the lawn. He tries to free
the  bride from the groom's embraces and clean up her face. 
</P>
<P>As the wedding guests are slaughtered one by one the bride and groom open 
their presents which include a series of vulgar speaking dolls which cause the
bride  to laugh [the same laugh that is on L&amp;A - oops sorry]. The two set of
parents sit and  lament the death of their relatives and decide to blame the
caterers for the fracas. 
</P>
<P>The bride is then seen in a side corridor where she suddenly faints. Victor 
follows her and, claiming to be a doctor, carries her into the honeymoon suite.
With  the bride still unconscious he cleans his muddy feet in the bidet.
Suddenly he spots a  young child in the doorway. He is no longer in a hotel room
but in a house. A  woman, Angela, rushes in and they discuss their affair
[finally Kate gets to speak  her first words]. They are about to kiss when
Victor finds himself back in the hotel  with Angela still on the bed. 
</P>
<P>The two families try and enter but Victor disuades them. [my memory goes a
bit  blank here ] Somehow we are back in Angela's house where the husband greets
 his father who has come to spend Xmas. Victor is brought into the room and 
referred to by everyone as Uncle Victor. The father says that this will be their
best  ever Xmas. Angela says something or other. 
</P>
<P>Back in the hotel room again the bride awakes and Victor bends down to kiss 
her. Her eyes become two beams of light - headlights of a car. There is a loud
crash. 
</P>
<P>It was a bit confusing towards the end with all the switches but I think the
above  is roughly correct. It was only in the flash forward (or backwards
depending on how  you look at it) scenes at the end that Kate spoke: before that
she was only required  to smile and react to other people - which she did most
ably. Kate came across very  well on her debut and hopefully it will encourage
her to do more. As the beautiful  Angela she made a nice contrast to the
obnoxious Jeff (Danny Peacock) and the fact  that she was speechless for the
majority of the film added to the sense of  surrealness of the film. In the &quot;domestic&quot;
scenes there was less attempt to make  Kate appear glamourous through the use of
make-up and she looked much as she  does in recent newspaper photos. 
</P>
<P>I am sure there where a lot of meaningful references in the film but on the
first  viewing I was fascinated to see what Kate would do - and whether she
would ever  get to speak! 
</P>
<P>Be seeing you, Neil

<P>Wow, fer sure dude. Having just re-watched the video, all I can say is what
is  going on? 
</P>
<P>The best I can guess is that Victor is fatally injured in the crash at the
start. He is  remembering the last significant events of his life then he, err,
snuffs it. 
</P>
<P>The one big hole with that theory is that he appears not to know Angela. 
</P>
<P>There are more things, but I'll wait for the discussion to start.

<P>&gt; The one big hole with that theory is that he appears not to know
Angela. 
</P>
<P>Erm, no, I don't read it like that. I saw Victor as a powerful but perhaps
rather  lonely man, with a distinctly melancholic disposition. The whole
programme was also  very melancholic, don't you think? Anyway, what he saw in
Angela was his vision of  perfection, the woman he had been searching for all
his life, and in the final  moments before his death, his imagination created
her for him. 
</P>
<P>When he first saw her, she was most definitely the &quot;property&quot; of
another. She  was in a situation (the centrepiece of a wedding) specifically
designed to emphasise  that fact. Nonetheless, he still tried to follow her, to
find out about her, to capture  her. 
</P>
<P>Eventually, of course, he did - or so he thought. When she fainted in the
hallway,  he arrived and took charge from her. From then on, perceived reality
started to  break down. He almost had her in the bathroom, only for her to be
snatched away at  the last moment. At the very end, he did get her, and his life
ended. 
</P>
<P>I look forward to the analysis.

<BR> Subject: Kat in &lt;Les Dogs&gt; 
</P>
<P> 'Les Dogs' ( To One in Paradise ) 
</P>
<P>&quot;All last night I couldn't sleep. I lay awake for hours, wrestling with
the problems  that face us today and all our tomorrows; and in the early hours
of the morning, as  the dawn rose above Westminster, I reached a decision - and
the decision I made  was ... to ban the motor car. No more noise, no more
pollution, no more traffic  wardens, no more waste of resources and finances.
Just the swish of the bicycle tyre,  and the distant sound of the toot, toot,
tooting of the steam-driven public transport.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Thus begins the Comic Strip film &lt;Les Dogs&gt; ( the subtitle is mine -
it's a clue -  well, it's Poe's, actually ), Kate's acting debut, set in an
alternative present Britain,  in which the Green Worker's Party has imposed a
military dictatorship. I'll try not  to reveal too much of the plot, ( somewhat
spoiled for readers of the &lt;Radio Times&gt; (  the BBC's programme guide ) by
the ending being revealed in the programme  summary - and this a week after ITV
revealed the complete plot and ending of &lt;The  Hunt for Red October&gt; in
their main evening news bulletin - what are these people  up to ?! ), as you'll
enjoy it much more through working out for yourself what really  happened in the
past and the present - I expect someone else will be unsubtle  enough to oblige,
anyway. So, herewith, a brief and hopefully tantalising synopsis. 
</P>
<P>The film tells, in a series of flashbacks and intertwined dream sequences,
of the  central character Victor's passion for, and affair with, a beautiful
young bride (  played by Someone We All Know ). Or perhaps I should say 'hints
at', rather than  'tells', as little is as it seems, much is fantasy and
might-have-beens. The first view  of Kate ( Angela ) is sitting at the wedding
reception, seen obliquely through her  veil, as the best man ( Adrian Edmondson
) stumbles through a desperate speech at  which no-one laughs, as the couple's
families, from different social planes, loathe  each other intensely. Victor (
Peter Richardson ) stumbles into the ensuing gun  battle ( &quot;Which side are
you on - the bride's or the groom's?&quot; &quot;I just came in to  find the
toilet.&quot; ) after his car has been involved in an accident. 
</P>
<P>Roped in to take the wedding photographs, Victor becomes infatuated with the
 lovely woman in white seen through the viewfinder, and follows her later when
he  sees her drifting along a hotel corridor in her flowing gown. Losing her, he
finds  her again, unconscious on the floor, surrounded by relatives. Why did she
faint?  Who knows? They don't. He pretends to be a doctor, and carries her off
into the  honeymoon suite ... ( Don't worry, he only takes off one of her shoes.
) The secret  affair goes on for several years, as Angela and her husband Jeff (
Danny Peacock )  now have two children, and 'uncle' Victor is now a close friend
of the reconciled  families. Jeff is desperately in love with Angela; it seems
he may know of the affair. 
</P>
<P>Will she leave him? Jeff might kill himself without her ( &quot;I love her,
Victor. She  means more to me than anything in the world.&quot; ), but she loves
Victor intensely.  They have by now surreptitiously arranged to run off
together. Does it ever happen?  ( I believe the final kiss, as the headlights
glare down, proves otherwise. ) Does only  the talking doll know the real
answers? ( &quot;Why, hello, Santa, you dumb gutless rat.  So howdya like the
future, asshole?&quot; ) 
</P>
<P>This is all really rather good, one of the Comic Strip's best, a sad,
haunting,  magical tale of doomed love. The perhaps trite romantic thread is
woven through a  manic mixture of fantasy and reality which makes for an
engrossing half hour. ( Of  course, if you don't like romances, it may not
appeal. However, if you cried at the  end of &lt;Somewhere in Time&gt;, you'll
love it. ) How much ever happened, how much  was wish fulfillment in the dream
state, and how the relationship was resolved,  you'll have to decide for
yourself. Kate's performance is natural and relaxed; a  gentle introduction into
acting ( Angela doesn't actually speak until halfway  through, and she spends
part of the film unconscious ), and one which I hope she  will follow up with
more complex roles in the future. 
</P>
<P>Usually only hearing her singing, I had almost forgotten what a lovely
speaking  voice she has - soft and melodious - and one which conveys breathless
passion  effortlessly - Victor never had a chance. I hope that Kate's pleased
with the film -  it's just the sort of imaginative drama that we could have
hoped for her to appear in,  and another success for the writer/director Peter
Richardson - but whenever will  those outside the UK have a chance to see it? 
</P>
<P>( 'Les Dogs' are the heavy metal band hired to play at the wedding
reception, by  the way. What I want to know is, what is the relevance of the
GWP? ) 
</P>
<P>&quot;The next thing I'm going to ban is television - no more passive and 
indiscriminate viewing of second-hand tat and trivia. Instead, we're going to
make  our own entertainment - a world of books, of fireside conversations, and
the writing  of very, very long letters. ... Which brings me to the telephone
... and the racing  pigeons.&quot;
