<P>A new KBC Newsletter was received by IED today, and he forthwith relays news
 of the utmost importance to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>The third piece of interesting news is that further mention (albeit still no
 confirmation) of the proposed EMI compilation, &quot;Kate Bush's Greatest Hits&quot;,
or  &quot;The Best of Kate Bush&quot;, has been made in the new Newsletter; and
the possibility  has once more been acknowledged that a new song might be
included in such a  release.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: KT LP 
</P>
<P>Finally got hold of a UK pressing of &quot;The Whole Story&quot;. Very
interesting effect it  has, the selection and sequencing of songs from
throughout Kate's career. IED tried  to imagine the impression an uninitiated
listener would receive from this collection,  and decided he/she would get a
clear idea of Kate's stylistic range, but not a very  good sense of the context
in which the style developed. For one thing, the songs go  from early to late
and back again, the sequence apparently determined by sound  dynamics, so unless
the listener studies the LP notes carefully, he/she is likely to get  a
distorted idea of the sounds that Kate herself designed. 
</P>
<P>But most confusing of all, IED thinks, would be the subject matter of the
songs.  No lyric sheet is included, so (as most L-Hs will be able to appreciate)
a new listener  couldn't really hope to decipher more than two thirds or so of
the lyrics, even after  prolonged listening. And since greatest hits packages
are designed primarily for the  casual music fan, it seems unlikely that this
compilation will do much to edify the  public about the REASONS for the sounds
within Kate's songs. 
</P>
<P>The KT symbol is not hidden within the cover art, but etched into the vinyl.
The  inside of the gatefold sleeve is bordered at the top by four photos: one
from Doug's  favourite photo session (the pink leotard shots), one from the live
&quot;James and the  Cold Gun&quot;, one from the &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;
single cover session (a slightly different  shot than the one which appears on
the 7&quot;), and the last from the 1985 Guido Herrera  (sp.?) sessions. 
</P>
<P>Along the bottom of the inside is a long row of tiny colour photos of &quot;all&quot;
of the  single covers (actually, of course, just all of the UK covers), the LPs,
plus The Single  File, the live EP, and the three videos released to date. The
back cover features a  JCB sunset silhouette photo of Kate as Peter Reich
sitting at the controls of Ken  Hill's cloudbuster. A video is to be made
available to accompany the LP.

</P>
<P>Here are the opinions of a few critics on the new album. 
</P>
<H3>Sounds November 15th 1986 (weekly pop paper). 
</H3>
<P>Kate Bush 'The Whole Story' (EMI Records KBTV1) ***** (Sounds top rating!) 
</P>
<P>Over the last nine years and five albums, Kate Bush, the most beautiful 
woman-child in Kent, has matured into quite the most sensual, expressive and 
creative artist this country can now boast. And this 12 track compilatin of hits
and  near misses more than adequately documents her evolution, from the often
clumsy  and overreaching ambition which marred her early works to the stunning
and  immaculate conception of her more recent 'Hounds of Love' material. 
</P>
<P>Though there were great gaping flaws within the fabric of the perhaps 
over-adventurous Bush albums, up to and including 'The Dreaming', she at least 
had the sense always to release the best and most important cuts as singles. And
 although I would have liked to see both 'December Will Be Magic Again' and the 
gloriously sweeping 'The Big Sky' included here, it's hard to argue against a 
selection which spans from the quite overt sensuality of 'Hounds of Love' to the
 harsh rhythms and intense delivery of 'Sat In Your Lap', and from the
cautionary  tale of 'Army Dreamers' to her best work to date, 'Cloudbusting'. 
</P>
<P>That she felt the need to restructure her greatest commercial success surely
 reveals that Kate Bush is only too well aware of her own ever-improving
abilities.  Though the new 'Wuthering Heights' is the same at base as the
original, her new  vocal soars far above the comparatively pedestrian if novel
squealing of the old. So  much so that to balance the added hunger and bite of
her own performance, the  guitar which counterpoints her at climax has been
pushed forwards most  emphatically in the mix. 
</P>
<P>All we can do now is hope that Kate Bush will continue to grow in the way
that  her past career suggests she might. And give thanks that her new single,
the subtle  yet insistent 'Experiment IV', also featured here, implies that she
will.

</H3>
<P>Somewhere up in the polar wastes of Lapland, we may be sure that Santa's
elfish  underlings are, even as we speak, hefting gigantic boxes of Kate Bush
greatest hits  albums, ready for Xmas despatch. Their labours will not go
unappreciated. 
</P>
<P>Despite Kate's fondness for lyrics that unkinder commentators are apt to 
describe as whimsical hippie tripe, her gift for melody (Army Dreamers, Man With
 The Child In His Eyes) and ingeniously arranged melodramas (Running Up That 
Hill) are enough to rank her as a supreme talent in English pop. What's often 
overlooked, as well, is her readiness to take greater risks than most stars in
her  position - even where the results come rather unstuck (Sat in Your Lap, The
 Dreaming). 
</P>
<P>Latest single Experiment IV, and a new and more powerful version of
Wuthering  Heights, sit along with Wow, Babooshka and so on to render The Whole
Story an  essential collection for anyone who can forgive a line like &quot;I
pine a lot/ I find the lot/  Falls through without you&quot; when it comes in a
gorgeous tune. **** (= excel-lent)

<H3>The Observer (Newspaper) 16/11/86 </H3>
<P>An Intelligent, concise compilation which draws out the con-sistency behind 
Bush's aparent flights of fancy. Nine years of hit-making show her progressive 
spiritual and philosphical dissertations to be rooted both in a strong pop sense
and  music that is extraordinarily fundamental. It includes the obvious
-'Wuthering  Heights', 'Running Up That Hill', 'Babooshka' - and a surprise:
'The Dreaming',  an aural equivalent of Nic Roeg's 'Wal-kabout.'

GMT <BR> Subject: TWS reviews
</P>
<P>Here are a couple more English reviews of 'The Whole Story'. The reviewers 
(those below and in my earlier posting) are remarkably consistent in their
verdicts -  which seem to be that (1) Kate Bush is a major artist, (2) the
record is a good  summary of her career to date, and (3) the early songs now
appear (to them) as  twee or whimsical in comparison to her latest compositions.

</P>
<H3>The Times Saturday Nov. 22nd - Times Newspapers Ltd. 
</H3>
<P>... Kate Bush ... whose album 'The Whole Story' neatly encapsulates her 12
best  single releases, including the current hit &quot;Experiment IV&quot;. 
</P>
<P>When &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; soared with such ease to No. 1 in the
spring of 1978,  many observers either imagined or hoped that the success of the
pouting 19 year-old  girl with the caterwauling vocal style and preposterous
dance routines would be a  short-lived novelty. But despite some of her more
offputting mannerisms - the  babyish gurgling in &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; and
the strident screeching in &quot;Sat in your  Lap&quot; - she has developed as a
writer and performer of some depth. Despite the big  production job, &quot;Wow&quot;
demonstrated a pleasing sense of irony while &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;  and &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; revealed an increasingly sophisticated sense of rhythm, 
melody and narrative awareness. 
</P>
<P>David Sinclair 
</P>
<H3>New Musical Express 22nd Nov. - Holborn Publishing Group. 
</H3>
<P>It was Mark Smith of top pop group (sic) The Fall who, in a typical
broadcast of  dedicated antitrendiness, announced that vegetarianism helped one
leave the trolley  of normality behind. Something to do with vital enzymes only
being available from  the flesh of murdered livestock. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is a vegetarian. And if Mark's MESsy (sic) theory is true, then it
 might account for the large quotient of strangeness coiled inside the songs and
 sounds that make up 'The Whole Story'. 
</P>
<P>Of course, being signed to EMI from the age of 14 and getting career
guidance  from zonked-out ex-Pink Floyd guitarists can't have helped. Listen to
the early  string-sugared meanderings of 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Wow' (the
latter now  sounds like a Spitting Image parody) and hear how despite the MORish
musical  arrangers and the synthetic touch of session musicians, Kate sounds
like she'd been  talking to the same ghosts as Ian Curtis. The marketing
executives still saw her as a  Carole King for the Brothers In Arms, an Elkie
Brooks who'd soon sort herself out. 
</P>
<P>But Kate just got curiouser and curiouser. Rejecting the saccharin sheen of
pet  poodle producers, she took total control, coming up with a whiplashed
meditation on  fame (&quot;Succeed and heaven is hell/Succeed and hell is heaven&quot;)
called 'Sat in Your  Lap'. 'The Whole Story' really stems from there, the early
inclusions being just a  way of making this a Christmas-targetted hits
collection. 
</P>
<P>From this point on, Kate Bush began to build on the fact that she belonged 
nowhere. She smiled at Terry Wogan while shifting buckets full of compact discs
to  the Strait generation. She dispensed with the walking-stick guitar solo and
the  comfortably melodious fretless basses and began using odd combinations of
samples,  sirens, bodhrans and banjos. Listen to last year's 'Hounds of Love'
LP. There are  three tracks from it here. Kate Bush was and is a law unto
herself. 
</P>
<P>And the voice just gets bigger and darker, climbing from the floor to the
ceiling  in the space of a line. 'Wuthering Heights' has a re-recorded vocal
which is almost  evil in its intensity. The single 'Experiment IV' is also
included, proving that Kate is  still missing the vital enzymes which help make
you as sane as Mark Smith. 
</P>
<P>'The Whole Story' is big, black subversive pop, more useful and more
enjoyable  than the constipated jangling of a hundred and one little lads with
big mouths and  even bigger clothes allowances. Such people are not worth a
carrot. Meat or no meat,  Kate Bush is streets ahead.

ANOTHER Whole Story Review 
</P>
<P>Here is yet ANOTHER review of &quot;The Whole Story&quot; this time from 
</P>
<H3>&quot;The Valley Advocate&quot; 
</H3>
<P>- the weekly arts/entertainment paper distributed free around UMass  Amherst
and probably the whole five-college area. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: The Whole Story (EMI-America) (**** 1/2) 
</P>
<P>This most extraordinary British performer has finally risen above cult
status in  America, and here is an excellent introduction to her melodic,
engrossing and often  haunting music. Each of the 12 songs was a substantial hit
in England, where this  kind of innovative, imaginative songwriting and singing
is much more apt to gain  airplay than over here. From a somewhat re-worked &quot;Wuthering
Heights,&quot; her  gorgeous breakout 1977 hit, through three tracks from HOUNDS
OF LOVE  (including &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; the meaty, beaty tune that
finally opened eyes on  this side of the Atlantic), one can trace her startling
musical development. Songs like  &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;
and the apocalyptical &quot;Breathing&quot; are pop  music at the cutting edge,
with a rare sophisication and intelligence. Also included is  the previously
unreleased &quot;Experiment IV&quot; to make this a must-have for the  collector
as well.

<BR> Subject: The Whole Story reviewed in Digital Audio 4/87
</P>
<P>I was just going through my music collection, trying to decide what I want
to put  on a &quot;party&quot; tape (good for listening in Walk-person type
things), when the mailman  came. He brought, among other things, the May issue
of Digital Audio and Compact  Disc Review, despite the fact my subscription
expired in February and I didn't  renew it. I started flipping through the
magazine, and I opened it right to a page  with KT staring out from the cover of
&quot;The Whole Story&quot; - with a review. I thought  I would share this with
my fellow love-hounds. This is copied here without  permission, and written by a
set of initials, BJM - Brian J. Murphy. The cd gets a 10  (out of 10) for
performance, and an 8 for sound quality. 
</P>
<H3>Digital Audio and Compact Disc Review
</H3>
<P> Pop singers don't come any more original than Kate Bush, the highlights of 
whose career appear on this disc. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush has been at the top of British pop charts since 1978 - a tribute
to the  British audience's ability to understand and appreciate the original and
unusual.  Americans are still relatively unaware of her, but Kate Bush is
rapidly gaining a  following here. In its various formats &quot;The Whole Story&quot;
has cracked the top-50  album charts as this review goes to press. It deserves
to do very well. So what IS the  whole story. 
</P>
<P>It's really quite simple: Kate Bush is unlike anything anyone has heard in
pop  before. She is so original she almost defies description. Her songwriting
and her  performances fit into none of the cozy pop music categories which
writers like to  use to describe artists. 
</P>
<P>Who else but Kate Bush could record a song like &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;?
[Does  anyone volunteer to send him a note that Pat Benatar did a version of
it??] This  strong opening track is sung with a kind of hysterical passion at
the upper reaches  of her vocal range for a highly charged performance. Then
there is &quot;Breathing,&quot; a  no-nukes song with an erotic sub-text woven
skillfully through it. Bush's  performance is stunning - and she makes her
point. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; is just as stunning, a
show-stopper worth  repeated listening. The song blends a romantic, erotic
component with a  performance of such breathless innocence that it totally
disarms the listener. Last  year she had her first American hit, &quot;Hounds of
Love,&quot; - have baying hounds ever  sounded more fetching? 
</P>
<P>This compendium also contains &quot;Babooshka,&quot; with it's [their typo,
not mine]  ironic sense of fun, an acid comment on the male ego entitled &quot;Wow,&quot;
and the  unusual &quot;Cloudbursting.&quot; [again, their mistake] On the latter
she caresses every note  with a breathily sweet vocal while, in the background,
what began as a beat played  softly on strings takes on a strident, military
flavor. To begin a song as a ballad and  end it as a march is the sort of
unusual trick you learn to expect when listening to  Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>She is served well by the technical quality of this CD, though some tracks
sound  somewhat compressed - but that's to be expected of a compendium spanning
eight  years of recordings. Despite a rather sharp edge to some selections, the
sound overall  is pleasing and room-filling, as are Ms. Bush's talents.

ed191-bq%violet.Berkeley.EDU@berkeley.edu (Taylor) <BR> Subject: Different
Single Mix of &quot;Sat..&quot; in The Whole Story 
</P>
<P>Actually, that should be &quot;The same old album mix of 'Sat in Your Lap'
on 'The  Whole Story' rather than the different single mix.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As I mentioned at some point earlier, this &quot;singles collection&quot;
album is supposed  to be a collection of the SINGLES original master tapes of
the single mixes. Although  Kate claimed at one point that none of the singles
were mixed again for their single  releases, this is definitely not true (at her
own admission) about the mix of &quot;Sat in  your Lap&quot; - the original
single, which came out in the spring of 1981, had drums that  were virtually
free of echo, which gave them a really elastic, &quot;thop-thop-y&quot; sound. 
She was originally going to leave the song entirely off &quot;The Dreaming,&quot;
but was  convinced by friends (and her fans?) to put it on. So she re-mixed it,
giving the  drums much more echo and moving the voice up in the mix. As a
result, (I think)  the song on the album is totally different sounding than that
on the single. But the  versi on &quot;TWS&quot; is the album version, which is
sort of disapting, since my &quot;SIYL&quot;  single warped like lasagna a
couple of years ago, and I was hoping for a clear version  of it. Oh well.

</P>
<P>I don't know if this was mentioned on love-hounds before, because I'm not on
 this list anymore, but I thought it could be of some interest. 
</P>
<P>Taken from CD-ROM magazine, Vol.1 No 3, October 1994 
</P>
<P>by Paul Nesbitt 
</P>
<P>When a soft-focus Kate Bush and her doppelgaenger rise from an exotic pool
of  liquid passion to begin a high-pitched and hysterical tale of scorched
jealousy based  on the Bronte pot-boiler, you can suddenly recall why Katie was
such an overnight  sensation. Wuthering heights is still an extraordinary song
and Bush's astonishing  warble combined with her Home Counties gothic princess
persona was a heady  audio-visual cocktail. The superly-encoded VideoCD
underlines just how attuned  Bush was to the then embryonic medium of rock
videos, helped in no small part by  her training in modern dance. Indeed, the
simplest videos in which a soft-focus Kate  whirls und wuthers in a lovingly-lit
room are invariably the best to watch. 
</P>
<P>   Less successful are the plot-heavy videos for some of her more leaden
tracks,  such as Cloudbusting and Experiment IV, which feature celebrity chums
like Dawn  French and Hugh Laurie to no great effect. 
</P>
<P>   Overall this is a reasonable testament to one of the most original
artists to  emerge in the late 1970s, and is proof that there is no substitute
for good songwriting.  However, Kate could do with learning a few new modern
dance steps. 
</P>
<P>   One gripe, though. The whole package was woefully short on any background
 information, even omitting to tell you in what year each track was recorded or
the  album from which it was taken. For twenty quid a throw, consumers have
every  right to expect a little more effort on the presentation front.
