    <P>A reliable source of rumour says that Kate has just seen the hottest SF
      thriller of the summer and likes it a lot. Apparently it has inspired her
      to write a new song, which will be released shortly as a special
      between-album single. A working version of the lyrics have gotten out;
      here they are: </P>
    
    <P>CHESTBURSTING </P>
    
    <P>I still dream of Aliens.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>I wake up crying.
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>You're making eggs
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>But you're out of reach
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>When your cacoon encases me </P>
    
    <P>You're like my tapeworm
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>That grew in my bowels
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>What made it special
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Made it dangerous
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>So I flushed it and forget. </P>
    
    <P>Everytime it pains,
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>You're here in my chest
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Like the tapeworm coming out
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Oh, I just know that something gross is going to happen
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>And I don't know when
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>But just thinking it could even make it happen. </P>
    
    <P>Under the reactor
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Wrapped up in this slime
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>You could see them coming
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>They looked too small
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>In their big metal lander
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>To be a threat to the mother Alien </P>
    
    <P>I flushed my tapeworm when it got too big </P>
    
    <P>I can't flush you down the toilet
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Oh God! I can't forget! </P>
    
    <P>Your son's coming out (Ouch!)
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Your son's coming out (Agggh!)
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>Your son's coming out (Aaaghargaglephfftargletoopgaaaaaaggggh!) </P>
    
    <P>-Doug </P>
    
    <P>OOOOH! I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. </P>
    
    <P>I can see the promo video now: Set in an abandoned sewage works,
      initially wearing only white vest and panties KaTe encases herself in a
      yellow, metal caterpillar before shaving her head and tumbling, redolent
      of a reclining Buddha, into a vat of raging custard and broken biscuits.
    </P>
    
    <P>It is a pity that EMI didn't want to release this unusual track, I
      suppose they felt that because it suggested KaTe was an android that it
      might have adversely affected any deals they where negotiating with Seilko
      at the time. </P>
    
    <P>As this doesn't seem to have been released officially anywhere can
      someone tell me where I might be able to get a bootleg? </P>
    
    <P>I am very sorry. I inadvertently typed &quot;was an android&quot; when I
      should have typed &quot;had a tapeworm&quot;. </P>

    <P>&gt; *** THE KATE EQUATION *** </P>
    
    <P>(Note: I did not invent this; I forgot who did [Stev0 --WIE]) </P>
    
    <P>I didn't invent the name, but some of the calculation. Last discussion
      of this sort was started by IED, I think. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Not counting The Kick Inside (since it was her first) or Lionheart
      (generally a good idea, anyway), look: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Never For Ever - 1980 </P>
    
    <P>&gt; The Dreaming - 1982 (two year wait) </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Hounds of Love - 1985 (three year wait) </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Sensual World - 1989 (four year wait) </P>
    
    <P>It's possible to do it better (including TKI and LH, why should they not
      count?): </P>
    
    <P> TKI '78 </P>
    
    <P>0 years: LH '78 </P>
    
    <P> 1 year paused due to Tour of Life '79, thus this year doesn't count
    </P>
    
    <P>1 year: NFE '80 </P>
    
    <P>2 years: TD '82 </P>
    
    <P>3 years: HOL '85 </P>
    
    <P> TWS ('86) doesn't count as a normal album </P>
    
    <P>4 years: TSW '89 </P>
    
    <P>5 years: KT-7 '94 (see?) </P>
    
    <P>6 years: KT-8 '00 (yuck! only one more album in this millenia... :-( )
    </P>
    
    <P>I heard that Prince is going to pause for five years from now on. The
      Prince fan who told me that said that this would be an opportunity to
      complete his collection. Do we all have complete colleKTions? </P>
    
    <P>To fulfill his contract with Warner Prince is going to take some songs
      every year. He doesn't have any problems with that since he has about 500
      songs completely ready to release. There won't be tours, of course. Only
      problem with the stock of 500 songs is that the stuff might be out-of-date
      in some years. Maybe KaTe has the same so that her heirs in some hundred
      years are able to earn money with 'fresh, previously unreleased
      KaTe-stuff'. Let's see: </P>
    
    <P>500 songs are with 12 songs/album + 8 bsides/album about 25 albums plus
      accompanying singles. I'll stop with album KT-31... </P>
    
    <P>7 years: KT-9 2007 </P>
    
    <P>8 years: KT-10 '15 </P>
    
    <P>9 years: KT-11 '24 </P>

    <P>13 years: KT-15 '70 (gee! then I am 102 years old!) </P>
    
    <P>14 years: KT-16 '84 </P>
    
    <P>15 years: KT-17 '99 </P>
    
    <P>16 years: KT-18 2115 </P>
    
    <P>17 years: KT-19 '32 </P>
    
    <P>18 years: KT-20 '50 </P>
    
    <P>19 years: KT-21 '69 (just reached my year 201) </P>
    
    <P>20 years: KT-22 '89 </P>
    
    <P>21 years: KT-23 2210 </P>
    
    <P>22 years: KT-24 '32 </P>
    
    <P>23 years: KT-25 '55 </P>

    <P>26 years: KT-28 '30 </P>
    
    <P>27 years: KT-29 '57 </P>
    
    <P>28 years: KT-30 '85 (KT-30 is just 400 years after KT-5) </P>
    
    <P>29 years: KT-31 2414 (now I am 446 years old...) </P>
    
    <P>Probably KaTe's grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-
      grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-children are born then,
      but these 18 generations statistically would be about 2^18 or 262144
      people (not counting inbreedings etc.). If every one of them just buys 1
      copy of the latest album, it's almost immediately gold. </P>

      <BR> From: steve.b@TQS.COM (Steve Berlin)
      <BR> Subject: The Wizard of Speed and Time </P>
    
    <P>Hi - </P>
    
    <P>While everyone here is arguing whether Prince is an egotistical hack or
      an egotistical hack with a very talented little finger, we're missing an
      important point: The end of the Kate Equation (discussed here a few of
      weeks ago), where K = year of new Kate album, and l(n) = the number of
      years between the last album, then K = l(n)+1. </P>
    
    <P>If the new album is released next year, then the equation still stands.
      If released this year, we have two theories about what could happen: </P>
    
    <P>The Maximized Entropy Theory: </P>
    
    <P>Kate has decided that four years is the ideal length between albums;
      every album will come out every four years (calculating the release dates
      of the next 10 albums, with this theory, is trivial). </P>
    
    <P>The Stephen Hawking Theory: </P>
    
    <P>In &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, Stephen Hawking said the
      Universe will expand to a finite size, then eventually contract to the
      size of the singularity of the original &quot;Big Bang&quot;, hinting it
      would start again ad infinitum. Kate said she admired Stephen Hawking, and
      is maybe using this theory to schedule her next release dates: i.e., the
      next album will be out in 3 years, then 2, THEN A TOUR!!, then a two-year
      delay, then TWO ALBUMS IN ONE YEAR, then ANOTHER TOUR! I'll let those more
      mathematically insane than myself to calculate: A) The release dates of
      the next 25 albums, and B) The years Kate will tour between now and her
      65th birthday. </P>
    
    <P>- Stev0 the wizard </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I only chose Prince to be on my next album because Milli Vanilli
      weren't returning my calls.&quot; - The part edited out of Kate's Aspel
      interview </P>

    <P>Wheee! A flame war that actually takes the &quot;lame&quot; out of &quot;flame&quot;!
      The two KateKops are (finally) at it! For those just tuning in, Chris's
      standard Modus Operandi with his enemy-of-the-week is to pull out his
      resume, showing he is a MUCH BETTER KateFan (tm) than YOU, how He was a
      fan since she was BORN, and personally introduced Kate Bush to David
      Gilmore. </P>
    
    <P>Jorn, on the other hand, is suffering feelings of a past life of his as
      a High Priest of Atlantis. If his pouting doesn't work (and usually it
      doesn't), he'll just give up and throw a bad ASCII graphic at everyone.
    </P>
    
    <P>Seriously, in this case, it seems like Chris is the &quot;Good Guy&quot;.
      Hey, if he doesn't have the equipment, he can't make a copy. What's so
      hard about that to understand? Now, Chris questions why Jorn would want a
      copy of the videotape when he doesn't even have a VCR or TV. Well, as we
      all know, Jorn can just &quot;read the vibes&quot; directly from the tape
      - he doesn't NEED a VCR! (He CAN'T do it with a Laserdisk, though!) </P>
    
    <P>Finally, although I agree with Chris in this one instance, wouldn't it
      be GREAT to see Vickie post to the public, &quot;Chris, you're being an
      idiot, &lt;insert name of enemy-of-the-week&gt; is right.&quot; just once?
      Also, wouldn't it be great if just once, Jon Drukman posted, &quot;&lt;Enemy-of-the-week&gt;,
      you're being an idiot, Chris is right.&quot;? </P>
    
    <P>- Stev0 the ex-badboy of Lovehounds </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Do give up, You don't have friends&quot; - Peter &amp; Kate

      a little secret: you can always assume that anything with my name attached
      to it is going to be sarcastic at best and wildly inflammatory at worst.
      My name in the From: line is all the labelling you should need. </P>
    
    <P>Maybe I'll adopt a rating system styled after the hugely successful MPAA
      one... </P>
    
    <P>G - safe for all katefans. not even one harsh word. </P>
    
    <P>PG - uses sarcasm, possibly irony, and maybe even a little denigration
    </P>
    
    <P>PG13 - basically the same as PG, but might include some frontal nudity
    </P>
    
    <P>R - massive sarcasm &amp; irony, harsh analogies, deprecating language,
      all out insults and 4 out of 7 words that you Can't Say On TV. possibly
      involves comparing someone to a nazi. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate, of course! </P>
    
    <P>There's been some talk on the net recently about Tori Amos. I agree,
      Tori is great, but here is my top ten list of reasons why Kate is better:
    </P>
    
    <P>Top Ten Reasons Why Kate Bush Is Better Than Tori Amos </P>
    
    <P>10) Kate has four different album covers for one album (TKI). </P>
    
    <P>9) Kate is a major babe. </P>
    
    <P>8) Kate has done only one major tour back in 1979 that was so
      outstanding that she's never needed to do another one. </P>
    
    <P>7) Her albums are so good that she only needs to put one out every four

    <P>6) Kate has an English accent. </P>
    
    <P>5) Kate has a certain mystique about her which comes from not seeing or
      hearing anything from her for years at a time (see #7). </P>
    
    <P>4) Only Kate could do a reggae version of Rocket Man and make it sound
      good. </P>
    
    <P>3) She knows David Gilmour. </P>
    
    <P>2) Kate sings moving, beautiful songs (with the exception of &quot;Violin&quot;).
    </P>
    
    <P>1) Moments of Pleasure is Kate's best song so far this decade. I predict
      her new album will be awesome! </P>

      forever bask the eternal love of KaTe and experimental music. But you have
      let the Madonna tempt you. Your soul is on a treacherous path, and if you

    <P>Comparing singers to Kate: I think EVERY singer should be compared to
      Kate. After all, Kate is the ultimate in music, sheer perfection.
      Therefore, a good unit of musical ability can be the &quot;Milikate&quot;.
      Mozart would be, say 950 millikates. Tori Amos is 500 milikates. Madonna
      is 5 milikates. Michael Bolton is -750 milikates. (Perhaps one should
      adopt a &quot;Milibolton&quot; as a unit of mediocrity). </P>

    <P>The first I won't even dignify by taking sides, to whit, those who think
      TRS is the best album since TSW vs. those who have no idea what they are

    <P>The second, however, is the kind of stuff I live for. </P>
    
    <P>For those relatively new here, Jon Drukman's modus operendi is posting
      about once a month or so a hilarious scathing rant against Vickie, who in
      turn replies by acting like the Margaret Dumont of Gaffa. </P>
    
    <P>Now, Vickie posts a very funny post, using my preferred technique of
      scatter-shot take-no-prisoners attitude, aiming many accurate barbs
      against the Drukman Contingent (Hmm, &quot;The Drukman Contingent.&quot;
      Good band name.) Now, our own Drukkie whines, showing he can dish it out
      but can't take it. </P>
    
    <P>Don't worry, Jon, you're STILL several hundred points ahead in the Jon

      for 1994? Is there any chance that she may come to Israel (or anywhere
      near Israel) this year? </P>
    
    <P>Here's Kate's 1994 concert schedule, as requested: </P>
    
    <P>May 8th, 1994 - Kate appears at the convention and just before leaving
      announces that &quot;if everything goes well, we are considering doing
      several dates.&quot; This is greeted by thunderous applause and cheering.
    </P>
    
    <P> Late May - Kate leaves for a well deserved vacation following the
      stress of extensive promotion of _The Red Shoes_. </P>
    
    <P>Early June - Kate notices that her garden has gone a bit to seed during
      her vacation and spends the next month getting everything back into shape.
    </P>
    
    <P>July through August - Kate's brother Jay makes a few discreet phone
      calls to promoters in England, Europe, and North America. Promoters leak
      word of impending concerts to friends in radio and publishing. </P>
    
    <P>September - Concert plans put on hold, as most of the halls are not
      available on such short notice. The earliest possible dates would put the
      concerts in the US and Canada in January. *Nobody* goes to Winnipeg in
      January. Decision is made to pursue spring 1995 tour. </P>
    
    <P>October through January - Kate has been working on a few song ideas in
      her home studio, and becomes convinced that she can complete a new album
      in the next few months. </P>
    
    <P>March 1995 - It becomes painfully obvious that the album will not be
      ready for at least another year. Tour plans are not mentioned again. </P>
    
    <P>September 1999 - Kate new album is finally released. </P>

    <P>For you new folks just joining us, or for those who forgot, I have to
      defend Jorn here. He did indeed write the entire FAQ. He's being modest,
      so I should also remind you that he wrote &quot;Finnigan's Wake&quot;,
      most of the plays most people mistakinly attribute to Shakespeare, the
      entire body of works one &quot;Thomas Pynchon&quot; stole from him, and
      several bits of The New Testament. What a certain devious Mr. Ron Hill did
      was take the FAQ Jorn wrote, re-wrote it ever so slightly, got into a time
      machine, went back in time, and posted it MONTHS before Jorn had a chance
      to, thus making it look like Mr. Hill wrote it. I'm just glad I could
      clear that up, and Uli, you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to
      make the Kate Kommunity a better place to live without consulting Jorn
      (who, after all, wrote the words and music to the entire albums of &quot;The
      Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, but let Kate say she did
      it) first! </P>

    <P>A-Ha! You're assuming she had the same reason each year. No, culled from
      past interviews, here are the reasons she gave for not touring in the
      above years: </P>
    
    <P>1981: Tarot advisor said not to leave bedroom </P>
    
    <P>1982: Spent year dead for tax purposes </P>

    <P>1985: Paddy superglued her to chair as practical joke </P>
    
    <P>1986: Was going to tour until someone explained that yes, she had to let
      the audience in. </P>
    
    <P>1987: Did tour, but not in this dimension </P>
    
    <P>1988: Did tour, but as backup singer for Spinal Tap </P>
    
    <P>1989: Said would only tour &quot;After I solve this goddamn Rubick's
      Cube&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>1990: Developed rock opera based on a deaf, dumb, and blind pinball
      player. Got all depressed when told someone else did that first. </P>
    
    <P>1991: Did tour, but only in living room in front of family. </P>
    
    <P>1992: Spent entire year re-reading old &quot;Flaming Carrot&quot;
      comics. </P>
    
    <P>1993: Vowed to see every film starring Harvey Keitel or Anthony Hopkins
    </P>
    
    <P>1994: When asked if she'll tour, answered, &quot;Oh, I didn't realize
      Hell froze over yet.&quot; </P>

    <P><BR>
       </P>
    
    <P>Lifestyles: </P>
    
    <P>o Kate is a carbon-based life-form. So is Tori. </P>
    
    <P>o Kate is bilaterally symetrical. So is Tori. </P>

      She will follow this with a gala world tour of only small venues so she
      can be close to her fans, and in fact, she plans to visit each Katemas
      party held in her honor this year. How? She's gotten a few tricks from
      Santa Claus and will pop down your chimney with a bag full of CD singles,
      all signed. </P>

    <P>Dear Simon, </P>
    
    <P>calling Kate Bush an extrovert is completely nonsense, sorry. You can't
      deduce this from songtitles. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Kate basically writes about ANYTHING &amp; EVERYTHING!!!! </P>
    
    <P>Yes, but because she CAN do so, not because she's an extrovert! </P>
    
    <P>Would you like to know the truth? </P>
    
    <P>The scientific proven fact is, that Amos makes sure, you know what an
      extraordinary person she is, while Kate is not a person at all, but a more
      advanced life form pretending to be human to spare your feelings. </P>
    
    <P>We haven't figured out so far, what HER real nature is, but it's
      definetely not purely human. I don't know the whole story, but in the late
      70s the FBI was involved in this, it's still top secret, but it resulted
      in Kate's somewhat mysterious seclusion and concealment. </P>
    
    <P>This is all I know about it. I got this information from a doctor in
      England, who was involved in some tomography imaging experiments on Kate's
      body during this investigation. Her astrocytes were completely different
      in shape and metabolism compared to normal human brain cells. She also had
      a very strange kind of microglia. He mentioned several other things, I
      have forgotten. </P>

    <P>&gt;... while Kate is not a person at all, but a more advanced life form
      pretending to be human to spare your feelings. We haven't figured out so
      far, what HER real nature is, but it's definetely not purely human. I
      don't know the whole story... </P>
    
    <P>GAD! That's not supposed to be general knowledge. The Rigellians hunt
      down anyone with that knowledge unless the Princess (uhh, the Queen now),
      forbids it. I got the story from one Sylvester Krupnick, late of Boise,
      now on the run from the Feds and the Kregar, agents of the Sklegnar
      Overlord. After the incident at Oxfordshire, Krupnick spent some time in
      DC hanging out around the Wall and living in the bushes of the park. I met
      him late one night and he told me the whole story about the thwarted
      invasion by the jello beings. Seems Krupnick started the dammed thing when
      he insulted a money droid in Boise. The Sklegnar thought it was an
      important communications device, holy to the humans, because they all got
      the little green papers with the images of their gods on it there. When
      Krupnick told it to &quot;Piss off&quot;, the Sklegnar shipWeb interpreted
      that as &quot;Become warm runny water&quot; which, as you know, to a jello
      being is a pretty rude insult. That started the invasion that the Talosian
      Princess and her exiled followers stopped at Oxfordshire... for now. </P>
    
    <P>SHHH! The bowls have ears. And please don't tell them her true name or
      true form if you know it. Only The Teacher may reveal the history of the
      royal family, and then only if the Princess has taught it this. The return
      to the homeworld depends on the stealth of the family and the Kregar have
      instructions to capture her at any cost. The stiletto heels only work in
      elevators at close range. Spare feelings? If her guardian, the Koton,
      finds out about this (and there is dammed little she doesn't see on the
      Internet), you will vanish! SHHH! </P>

    <P>By the way, Banshee, your puzzlement about that sly posting from &quot;Kate
      Bush@Novercia.uk&quot; is perfectly understandable. IED will admit that
      his frail, phosphorous heart did some skipping, too, for a moment -- then
      turned black as night in contemplation of the entity responsible for the
      fraud... </P>

    <P>P.S.: Just in case that was you, Kate, who chose to put in a temporary
      post with that artificial address. (Even creating a joke in your own vain.
      I can see that. We deserve to be teased once in awhile.) You are my
      favorite artist. You made a difference in my writing. You make me see the
      world anew after I hear your songs, your albums. </P>
    
    <P>Well, why not? I can dream, can't I? My heart did stop and it's pounding
      ever since, regardless. I don't mind the joke because I like to dream. (So
      I thank you, practical joker. And I don't see why some feel they have to &quot;hunt&quot;
      for you, the likely imposter! (It's in the trees/It's coming!):) That may
      make me gullible, but I've been cynical too long. What's wrong with being
      a little gullible, once in awhile?) </P>
    
    <P>&quot;When the sailors saw &quot;the joke&quot; they all did stand and
      stare . . .&quot; </P>
