      <BR> From: Ulrich Grepel &lt;uli@intellektik.informatik.th-darmstadt.de&gt;
      <BR> Subject: FAQ-comments, div. info/questions </P>
    
    <P>Hi all, this is my first post via mail, I hope it arrives... </P>
    
    <P>after re-reading the faq, I found I had to make some additions: </P>
    
    <P>1. Kate's session work is not completely listed: </P>
    
    <P>In 1990 she did BVs on the title track of Roy Harper's album 'Once':
      <BR> Roy Harper - Once
      <BR> Line Records, LICD 9.00892 O, copyright 1990 </P>
    
    <P>Peter Gabriels third album is available in a German version. Just for
      completeness: Kate's original backing vocals are used in the two songs
      'Keine Selbstkontrolle' (No Self Control) and 'Spiel ohne Grenzen' (Games
      Without Frontiers). The CD order number is: virgin xcdscd 4019, its name
      is 'peter gabriel - ein deutsches album'. </P>
    
    <P>Another recording with Peter Gabriel is 'don't give up' which is
      availlable in several versions. The video soundtracks are not the same
      length as the LP version, same for the version used on Peter's 'Shaking
      the Tree' best of. And there is yet another mix availlable on a promo
      version of 'don't give up' that is even shorter. On the promo (CD and
      vinyl 12&quot;) there are two versions: an 'edit' with 5:26 and the LP
      version with 6:30. Unfortunately the only differences I can hear are the
      length of the intro and 'extro' parts. </P>
    
    <P>2. I have a video tape with Rocket Man. </P>
    
    <P>I would love to trade that (and the others I have) for other Kate videos
      I do not have, please email me to get more enlightened. (I will at a point
      in the near future have the ability to do some NTSC&lt;-&gt;PAL
      conversions since a friend of mine is going to spend money for that
      Panasonic machine) </P>
    
    <P>3. Books: </P>
    
    <P>For the curious: There's a German translation of 'An Illustrated
      Biography' by Paul Kerton, published by Bastei Luebbe, but already
      deleted: </P>
    
    <P>Paul Kerton - Kate Bush
      <BR> Die britische Rock-Sensation der 80er Jahre!
      <BR> Mit zahlreichen Farb- und Schwarz-weiss-Fotos und kompletter
      Discographie
      <BR> Bastei Luebbe 60 050, ISBN 3-404-60050-9, published in 1981 </P>
    
    <P>The two lines are: </P>
    
    <P>The British rock sensation of the 80s!
      <BR> With numerous color and black-and-white photos and a complete
      discography
      <BR> It is a paperback edition with 127 pages. </P>
    
    <P>The following items have nothing to do with the FAQ, but they spinned
      around my mind for quite a time, so I put them here: </P>
    
    <P>4. The Magician: </P>
    
    <P>I have the German version of that film. The song is only played once
      with voice parts by Kate, when the magician's former girl friend arrives
      in Warshaw (?) to be with him and his actual girl friend is not pleased by
      the idea that he goes down to her on the street. (Dunno the names at the
      moment.) </P>
    
    <P>Questions: </P>
    
    <P>a) Is the position of the sung song the same in the English version?
    </P>
    
    <P>b) I imagine the following: One gets both versions of the film. One
      digitizes both. One does a FFT on both. One synchronizes the tracks. One
      takes out any frequency that is not on both tracks. One reverts the FFT.
      One has the song with much less talking over it. One is happy. </P>
    
    <P>Does that seem reasonable? </P>
    
    <P>5. Candle In The Wind: </P>
    
    <P>Look for 4 b). Then take CITW and CITW instrumental version. Get rid of
      the synthesizer. Get a better instrumental version. Mix'em up. Be happy
      again. Comments? </P>
    
    <P>6. Back Sides: </P>
    
    <P>In a recent article about Kate Compilation Bootlegs there were some
      comments about the back sides bootleg album. One of IED, Evan Walsh or Ron
      Hill said that he thinks BS is pressed on top of another record from Maria
      Stanmore because of hearing something at the end of TBS and the LP label.
      Haven't you read the titles of the Maria Stanmore songs? They are as
      following: </P>
    
    <P> side a: </P>
    
    <P>1. Last Day Of The Month - replace Day with Month, Month with Year and
      you'll get December, and the song is in fact December will be...
      <BR> 2. Hot And Relax - replace hot with warm, relax with soothing and
      you'll get the actual song, Warm and Soothing.
      <BR> 3. A Dance For All - Waltzes are a kind of dances, and this is the
      Ran Tan Waltz.
      <BR> 4. No Room To Move - isn't this what you get when you have a Full
      House?
      <BR> 5. Nobody But Us Chickens - If a chick is alone at home, this title
      applies. If you misspell the actual title of the song as 'The Empty
      building' (as it is done on the outer sleeve), you'll get a similar
      situation. </P>
    
    <P>side b: </P>
    
    <P>1. A Bridge Too Far - this is Burning Bridge. I do not know what
      'burning' has to do with being too far (away), but... I've got to get
      closer now
      <BR> 2. Maybe Later - that clearly sais 'Not This Time'
      <BR> 3. Could They Be Meaning Me! - Could be connected to a handsome boy
      who is acting like if he is innocent...
      <BR> 4. Don't Catch Me Out - Where is ivy growing - surely not inside
      buildings...
      <BR> 5. Patrick Moores Dream - A Book Of Dreams by Peter Reich is one
      connection that comes to my mind. Who is Patrick Moore? Why does the
      bootlegger do this mistake, since the song is The Big Sky, not
      Cloudbusting? Another connection might be that there's a Henry Moore,
      sculptor, who happens to celebrate his birthday on Katemas. But the actual
      connection would surely be that Kate is dreaming in that song - even if it
      is not literally mentioned in its lyrics. Besides, there is a Stanford
      Moore (1913-1982, Am. biochem.), think about Marias surname... </P>
    
    <P>My comment on the mislabeling with Maria Stanmore is that this is a
      fairly common action by bootleggers when they have to find a record press
      making the bootleg record. They normally shouldn't know what they're
      doing, at least not everyone. So the bootlegger claims that he has the
      copyrights to the recordings, but that doesn't work well with too well
      known artists. So they invent another one, in this case Maria Stanmore.
      The record label of this boot obviously is 'Pink Frost Records', a typical
      name for these labels. The CD is by 'Observation Records', and not
      mislabeled. There is a Prince Bootleg CD that is labeled to be from a
      group called 'Funky Power Research', a more-or-less Princeish name... </P>
    
    <P>The other song audible at the end of TBS might be anything, perhaps a
      song the bootlegger listened to when he made the 'masters'. Some stereos
      are not able to separate inputs completely. I experienced a similar thing
      when I once made a tape for my car and searched, on another tape deck,
      connected to the amplifier, for empty tapes. The not-empty-ones can be
      heard on the tape I recorded for my car. </P>
    
    <P>BTW: The 'noise' at the end of TBS is on the CD version as well. Hence
      it's the same masters or it's a copy of the vinyl edition. You can't press
      a CD on top of another. Can't you? </P>
    
    <P> Another BTW: It would be quite accidentally if the 'original' record by
      Maria has the same length as the BS itself. And, it won't fit exactly into
      the original groove, so some needle-crashing would have to be heard. </P>

      <BR> From: Ulrich Grepel &lt;uli@intellektik.informatik.th-darmstadt.de&gt;
      <BR> Subject: Under the Ivy Bush </P>
    
    <P>Whew! I'm almost blow(n) away! </P>
    
    <P>I got hold of a copy of the 'Under the Ivy Bush' bootleg LP. Amongst
      others it features a live version of 'James and the Cold Gun' that's
      blowing me away. This one is really different, and - as IED says -
      remarkably good for '79 audience bootleg recordings. Anyway, this version
      is incredibly, only recommended for Truefans, because it is quite
      disturbed/ing! Nobody seems able to hold a note. That stands not only for
      Kate's vocals, but for all instruments too. If this is not some pitch
      problem with the recording, it has to be purpose! Alltogether, this piece
      is a heavy experience... </P>
    
    <P>Oh, before I forget: A while ago we discussed the bootleggers' way to
      disguise the contents of a disc by selecting strange track titles that
      only resemble the actual one. We did that on the example of the 'Back
      Sides' vinyl label. The Label of the 'Under the Ivy Bush' LP is similar:
    </P>
    
    <P>Side 1: </P>
    
    <P>Climb every mountain - Running up that Hill
      <BR> Blue Sky - The Big Sky
      <BR> Jimmy get your gun - James and the cold gun
      <BR> Gymnopedies - Satie's first Gymnopedie &amp; Moving </P>
    
    <P>Side 2: </P>
    
    <P>Only have eyes for you - The Man with the Child in his Eyes
      <BR> Fiddler on the roof - Violin
      <BR> Horror at home - Hammer horror
      <BR> High as a bird - Kite
      <BR> High Society - Wuthering Heights
      <BR> Under the Ivy - Under the Ivy </P>
    
    <P>The last one is an exception to the rule, but since it is more unknown
      than the other ones (it is not an album track) and since the whole album
      has that title, it's not adding too much to the risk of producing the
      bootleg. Note also that the album is by the KTB Band, something we all
      know, but something that not everybody connects with Kate Bush. </P>

      <BR> From: woj@remus.rutgers.edu (l.l. cool bean)
      <BR> Subject: butterfly kisses </P>
    
    <P>Here, y'all KaTe KolleKTor sKum, is the track listing on the bootleg cd
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Butterfly Kisses&quot; </P>
    
    <P>1. wuthering heights (this is apparently from some tv program - i can
      think of two possibilities, though i do not know which this is from - i
      had never heard this recording of the song before, however.)
      <BR> 2. the wedding list (prince's trust gala concert, 21 july 1982)
      <BR> 3. the man with the child in his eyes (unidentified tv performance,
      possibly from saturday night live, but i'm not sure.)
      <BR> 4. them heavy people (unidentified tv performance - features backing
      vocals by a woman who does not sound like Kate at all.)
      <BR> 5. under the ivy (the tube - neil said this was not available on
      anything other than video bootlegs, but i believe that is incorrect. if
      i'm not mistaken, this also showed up on the passing through air vinyl
      bootleg, though i'm not sure of this.)
      <BR> 6. breathing (comic relief concert, 4/6 april 1986)
      <BR> 7. do bears ... in the woods (comic relief conerts, 4/6 april 1986 -
      duet with rowan atkinson.)
      <BR> 8. running up that hill (the secret policeman's third ball, 2nd
      night - with david gilmour on guitar)
      <BR> 9. the long and winding road (sound in s, japanese tv, 23 june 1978)
      <BR> 10. she's leaving home (sound in s, japanese tv, 23 june 1978)
      <BR> 11. moving (unidentified tv performance, possible 7th tokyo song
      festival, 18 june 1978 - another new track for my ears.)
      <BR> the rest of the cd is all tracks taken from some unidentified tour
      of life concert: room for the life/strange phenomena/violin/in the warm
      room/kite/wuthering heights. </P>
    
    <P>the packaging is decent: the cover is KaTe done up in the violin getup
      that she wore in the bbc special. inside the jewel booklet (which is more
      a pamph-let, i should say) are three black'n'white shots of KaTe in a
      dancing leo-tard and tights - maybe i'll digitize them sometime. </P>
    
    <P>as i mentioned before, sound quality is fair to good as bootlegs go.
      strong recording levels were used, so that is a good sign. don't expect to
      hear crystalline sounds if you buy this, but it is not muddled beyond
      reconition either. </P>

    <P>INTERVIEW BOOTLEGS
      <BR> by Ron Hill, Andrew Marvick (IED), and Ulrich Grepel.
      <BR> Compiled by Ron Hill
      <BR> </P>
    
    <P>June 6, 1993 </P>
    
    <P>NOTE!!! This list is currently very incomplete, the main problem being
      the compiler does not have access to the early bootleg records (though he
      does have all the interviews on tape), and it's very confusing putting a
      list like this together without having access to the records. Eventually
      I'd like to have a more complete listing, with details as to which
      interviews are on which records, perhaps even the first question and
      answer from each interview. </P>
    
    <P>Interview disks mentioned in the collector's guide but not yet included
      here are: KB7, BUSH7P, BUSH 7, Chat with the Stars, BUSH 7S, and KATE
      BUSH. Interview CDs are Greyhound and Bush 7 CD. If anyone has these, I'd
      appreciate it if you could post the first question and answer from each
      (and whatever other information you see fit), so that we can determine
      what has what. As far as I know, I have all of the interviews, I just
      don't know what is included on each disk. </P>
    
    <P> It should be noted that unlike other Kate Bush bootlegs, interview
      boots are actually legal. There has been some discussion, however, as to
      whether or not that makes them ethical. On the &quot;no&quot; side it can
      be pointed out that Kate makes no money from any bootlegs, and the boots
      are often shoddy and misleading. On the &quot;yes&quot; side, some fail to
      see the fundamental difference between making a profit by selling an
      interview in a magazine and making a profit by selling an interview
      pressed in vinyl. </P>
    
    <P>OFFICIAL PICTURE DISCS </P>
    
    <P>The earliest is a picture disc of The Kick Inside , released first in
      1978, then again (without run-out groove message) in 1981 or 1982. </P>
    
    <P> The second was a seven-inch pic-disc of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; single,
      UK only. </P>
    
    <P>BOOTLEG INTERVIEW DISCS </P>
    
    <P> BAK 2006 - It is a British import, originally priced from between $7.98
      and $10.99. </P>
    
    <P> This record is reasonably well made, as such things go. It is NOT,
      repeat NOT an official EMI release, but an attempt has been made to make
      it APPEAR to be official (a pseudo-HoL type-style and EMI-like catalogue
      number). The two photos are in colour, and are relatively rare shots, both
      from early photo sessions with Kate wearing her old white dove earrings.
      Both were taken in 1978, probably quite early in the year. IED dates them
      that way because of the feathery choker she wears in one photo, a
      decoration which she wore during a 1978 German lip-synch. One of the
      photos is very distinctive: Kate stands against a blue background, and has
      both hands raised, as though displaying her manicure to the camera. </P>
    
    <P> The record appears to have been made by the same people who put out a
      series of SEVEN-inch interview picture-discs of David Sylvian and Siouxsie
      Sioux about a year earlier. </P>
    
    <P> This one contains an interview done with Kate in her studio by a
      British fan who apparently obtained Kate's participation by associating
      himself with an Australian group (probably the Aussie fanzine Dreamtime,
      who did send a couple of writers over to visit the UK KT community the
      year before). Kate obviously had no idea at the time of the interview that
      the tape would be used as yet another exploitive bootleg product. However,
      this is definitely not the same as the infamous &quot;D. Cross&quot;
      interview which Homeground exposed as a fraud perpetrated by upstart rival
      Under the Ivy, as this is definitely a real one-on-one interview, whereas
      the other was just a fake using Kate's pre-recorded answers from the
      Canadian HoL interview record and a voice-over of the cue-sheet questions.
      Nevertheless, in the picture-disc's &quot;real&quot; interview, both the
      interviewer and Kate are extremely nervous and ill-at-ease, especially at
      the beginning and end of the interview; and the questions range from the
      utterly banal (things like &quot;What's 'Running Up That Hill' about?&quot;)
      to the completely weird and meaningless (&quot;The cloudbuster that Ken
      Hill made -- What's become of it?&quot; Answer: It's in storage in a
      garage, of course!). At the very end the interviewer throws in one of the
      questions Kate particularly dislikes getting, namely, &quot;Do you follow
      current affairs and politics, Kate?&quot;. This time it was especially
      unwelcome because Kate thought the interview was finished, and then had to
      stay and answer this last question. She gives her usual non-committal
      answer, but this time it's also clearly intended to stop the conversation
      -- the closest IED has ever heard Kate get to open annoyance. </P>
    
    <P> The interview begins: </P>
    
    <P> I: When you launched the album, you had a laser show at the London
      planeterium (giggle) </P>
    
    <P> K: Yes. (laughing) Were you there? </P>
    
    <P> KB1011 - This one has two reddish photos, the first a shot taken during
      Kate's stay in New York in November 1985 (she is wearing the veddy proper
      white blouse and floppy bow tie in which she made most of her public
      appearances there), the other a still from either German, French or Dutch
      lip-synch performances of &quot;Babooshka&quot;, from back in 1980 (this
      was the solo performance in a red jumpsuit with a bass viol as the only
      prop). The same group of bootleggers made this and the previous picture
      disks, and both have prominent catalogue numbers and copyright signs all
      over, to lend them a false air of authenticity (bloody cheek). </P>
    
    <P>KATE BUSH II - This one features two more of the 1978 feather-choker
      photos, and is called &quot;Kate Bush II&quot;. The other of the
      legitimate interviews (found on the latest BAK disc) has absolutely
      abominable sound. Let IED qualify that: the sound is all right, but the
      interview took place in a room full of loudly chatting people (a pub,
      perhaps, or at a party?), and as a result it's sometimes very difficult to
      hear all of Kate's answers. In this record's favour is the quality of the
      discussion itself -- really first-rate. The interviewer is either English
      or Scottish, IED thinks, and he manages to do what very few Kate
      interviewers succeed in doing, namely to turn an unnatural &quot;interview&quot;
      session into a very comfortable, mutually respectful chat of some thirty
      minutes' length. The conversation, which dates from just prior to the
      release of the &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot; single, touches on a great
      many topics, and Kate makes many very interesting comments about subjects
      no-one has ever brought up with her before. </P>
    
    <P> Note this interview is also included on the CD CBAK 4011, but
      apparently it is cut short (see that entry). </P>
    
    <P>This interview begins: </P>
    
    <P> How do you get on with the situation of only bringing out an album sort
      of every two years and... </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Well, it was difficult 'cause.. like the last album, when that
      was finished, it was just a matter of doing the promotion and then I free
      again to do another album. </P>
    
    <P>the &quot;CBAK 4011&quot; version APPARENTLY ends at: </P>
    
    <P> I think 'Oh yeah, that sound that Pad had, that'd be great in there.'&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Wheras this ends at: </P>
    
    <P> I mean there's no doubt that when people change their names, they
      actually do change.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush Interview, 1986 - A picture-disk 7&quot; interview single The
      record contains the &quot;official&quot; promotional interview for HoL ,
      conducted in 1986, according to the little sticker-label that is attached
      to the clear plastic sleeve of the record. (This label is the only
      identifying mark on the product; it gives a catalogue number but no label
      name. It is set in violet HoL -style italic type, and simply says &quot;Kate
      Bush Interview, 1986&quot;.) </P>
    
    <P>The interview is the &quot;canned&quot; promotional interview for Hounds
      of Love, the questions were dubbed in later. (see The Conversation Series
      CD entry) The quality of the pressing is okay. The quality of the
      picture-disk itself is quite high. Both photos are from about 1985/6, and
      although the record is clearly &quot;unauthorized&quot;, its production
      values are certainly as good as those of the official 7&quot; picture-disk
      of &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Abbey Road&quot; - A 12&quot; picture-disk. One side features a
      1985 publicity shot (often seen) of Kate in pink; the other is a nice
      twist on the TKI official picture-disk. It's a photo of Kate in the green
      body-suit from that disk, getting out of a chromium cylinder, but the shot
      is not exactly the same as the one from the official disk. The program is
      exactly the same Tony Myatt interview (47 minutes long) as heard at the
      Romford convention and on the CD (see the CD entry for more information).
    </P>
    
    <P>Words about Music WAM05 - Limiteded (500) comes in a cardboard box with
      colour photo on front, two halftone photos inside. Two interviews, both
      late 1985, approx 15mins each. I think they're both fairly well-known -
      most of what she says sounds familiar. She doesn't sound particularly
      cheeful on the first one (neither does the interviewer) but the second is
      a bit better. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Stand Up &amp; Talk!&quot; (1992) It's a 33rmp LP single picture
      disk. The picture is taken from the &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; video
      and gives the LP a weird shape. You also get a plinth (or stand) with the
      following instructions - </P>
    
    <P> - A plinth is included to enable Kate to stand up. To fit simply fit
      the flat area of this disc into the slit on the plinth. Put on a shelf &amp;
      drool.&quot; - </P>
    
    <P> I assume it's from a series of interview LP's since it's numbered &quot;Standup
      2&quot;. I'm also informed that it's a limited edition and I own No. 859
      of 1500. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Just Saying It (Could Even Make it Happen)&quot; (1992) Its front
      cover shows a nice photo of Kate at the '87 BPI's (IED refers to the
      ceremony at which Kate was dragooned into handing Peter Gabriel an award),
      wearing a high-collared black evening dress, with her hair pinned up. On
      the back is a color photo from Kate's appearance at the Laserium in 1985
      for the premiere of the &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; LP (where she was
      accompanied by Del Palmer for the first time in a social context). The
      vinyl in the copy that IED saw was a peculiar sort of
      purplish-Pepto-Bismolish opaque color. The same interview on this album
      comprises part one of the &quot;Words About Music&quot; interview CD. The
      interview was apparently conducted circa 1985. </P>
    
    <P>INTERVIEW CDS </P>
    
    <P>Conversation Disc Series ABCD 012 - The first-ever KATE BUSH PICTURE-CD.
    </P>
    
    <P>Actually, though, it's still a pretty shoddy piece of merchandise. It's
      an interview-disk, a new entry in the continuing series of cult-rocker
      interview CDs that had been showing up in import CD shops during the past
      couple of months before this CD. (Earlier entries include Sisters of
      Mercy, Cocteau Twins and Peter Gabriel, plus perhaps five or six others.)
      The covers of all of these CDs are yellow, with a photograph of the
      artist/artists on the front of the &quot;booklet&quot;. No label name is
      given, and it's possible that the company is the same that put out the
      long series of picture-disk vinyl interview LPs under the &quot;BAKTABAK&quot;
      label, but there's no way of really knowing. </P>
    
    <P>The Kate Bush CD features a candid photo of Kate from her appearance at
      the laser-art press audition of the Hounds of Love LP in the fall of 1985.
      Another photo by the same photographer was used by Verkerke poster company
      as the source for a poster which appeared in Europe shortly afterward.
      Kate is seen wearing a plain off-white silk blouse and the dragon earrings
      which appear on the cover of the Hounds of Love twelve-inch (and
      elsewhere). The same photograph is reproduced on (and somewhat rattily
      inserted in) the label-side surface of the compact disc itself. </P>
    
    <P>As for the audio content, it is comprised of two separate interviews,
      the first of about twenty-three minutes' length, the other of about nine
      minutes The first of the two from the French TV show Profile 6 and is an
      undoctored, legitimate conversation between Kate and an unidentified
      Englishman who asks all the usual and basic questions, receiving all the
      usual and basic replies, although Kate seems to take more than her usual
      care in choosing her words. The second interview is the &quot;canned&quot;
      promotional interview for Hounds of Love, the questions were dubbed in
      later. </P>
    
    <P>Oh, one more thing, this by way of a warning to the buyer: on the back
      of the CD's jewel-box notes there is a &quot;guarantee&quot; that none of
      the interview CDs in this yellow series is less than 40 minutes in length.
      In fact, however, the Kate Bush CD is only a little more than 32 minutes
      long. So much for truth in advertising. </P>
    
    <P> The first interview begins: </P>
    
    <P>Int: Many congratulations on the success of the album hounds of love and
      of course the singles which have also been very successful. How are you
      coping with the success this time around - are you finding it alot easier
      than the &quot;wuthering heights&quot; days? </P>
    
    <P>Kt: Yes and no, I mean it's easier cos it's something i've experienced
      before, </P>
    
    <P> The second interview begins: </P>
    
    <P>Int: Where do you get the ideas for the imagery in your music and
      videos? </P>
    
    <P>Kt: I think most of my imagery comes from films. but, initially, it all
      comes from people. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Kate Bush Interview, 1986&quot; - A 3&quot; compact disk, in a 5&quot;
      &quot;economy&quot; jewel-box (same size as but thinner than a normal
      jewel-box) with adaptor and plain white-paper cover inside that says
      simply &quot;Kate Bush Interview 1986&quot;, printed (as was the sticker
      on the cover of the picture-disk) in violet &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;-style
      script. The product bears no label name, but says &quot;Made in UK&quot;
      and has a catalogue number &quot;KB3CD&quot;. The interview on the disk is
      identical to the picture-disk's, but the inside of the cover-card in the
      CD box has a short, illiterate and anonymously authored blurb about Kate
      and the interview.</P>
    
    <P>This same 3&quot; compact disk is also reported to have become available
      in &quot;gold&quot;, i.e. with a gold tint to the CD. </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush: The Abbey Road Interview - Unlike most of the others
      released to date, this CD is an excellent product. It is apparently being
      made in an authentically &quot;limited&quot; edition--at any rate, each
      copy includes a serial number on the front cover. </P>
    
    <P>The cover--which is made of card-paper in the style of a five-inch-size
      album cover--is beautifully designed, with pretty silver block lettering
      on a dark blue background. On the front cover it simply says &quot;K A T E
      B U S H&quot; above a reproduction of one of Guido Herera's HoL -era
      publicity close-ups, in full and good-quality colour. The back has the
      title, the serial number (printed in black on a white band) and a
      marvelously printed colour shot of Kate, dating from a series of photos
      for a ca.-1979/80 UK music-weekly interview (quite unrelated to the
      contents of the CD itself, but a wonderful shot nevertheless), showing her
      seated on a bank of black leather couches in a lobby, wearing a bright red
      dress with a butterfly brooch. Lovely. </P>
    
    <P>The interview itself is not from &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. God knows why
      such a title was chosen. At any rate, it probably wouldn't have been a
      good idea to identify the interview correctly, because the actual company
      which owns the rights to it--UK's Capital Radio-- almost certainly had
      nothing to do with this product. Anyway, the interview was really
      undertaken by Tony Myatt, a longtime friend of Kate's dating from November
      of 1977 when Tony and Capital decided that Wuthering Heights was such a
      great record, they would play it on their station even though its release
      had been postponed for four months. Their early promotion had a &quot;teaser&quot;
      effect on the British public, and helped make Wuthering Heights the
      success it was. </P>
    
    <P> This particular interview was, as far as IED knows, recorded by Tony at
      Capital's own studios, but at the Romford Convention in November 1985 it
      was announced that the interview had been conducted expressly for the
      convention itself. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, the interview is one of Kate's very best, and even though Tony's
      questions are frequently very, very silly, his evident affection and
      respect for Kate have the effect of provoking some very interesting and
      emotional answers. It's also a long interview--the second longest that IED
      has ever heard/read. It lasts forty-seven minutes. Finally, the sound is
      superb--almost like a digital recording. Absolutely no hiss, though there
      is a very low-level intermittent buzz from the in-studio equipment. All in
      all, this CD gets an A from IED, and is recommended to anyone wishing to
      hear Kate talking over a broad range of subjects with the thoughtfulness
      and maturity that has distinguished her public conversation since 1985.
    </P>
    
    <P> The interview begins: </P>
    
    <P> Let's talk about The Hounds of Love [sic] first of all, ok? A wonderful
      title for an album, but where does it actually come from?&quot;The title
      comes from one of the songs, which is entitled Hounds of Love, and this
      album for me is like two quite separate pieces of work: </P>
    
    <P>CBAK 4011 - A picture-disk CD on the Baktabak label. This contains two
      interviews, the first from '82 (about 20 minutes long) and the second from
      '85. The first interview is the same as the one on &quot;Kate Bush II&quot;
      record, but this CD MAY only contain about half of the interview [NOTE:
      I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE ABOUT THIS, I only know that the transcription I
      have this CD is only half as long as the recording I have from the album].
      The second interview is the same as the BAK 2006 interview. </P>
    
    <P>'Words About Music' (1992) - It's order number is 'WAM 05'. My
      xerox-source sais that there are two interviews on it: 1. the same one as
      on the picture LP 'Tell Tales / KB1011A / 1987', but with some more
      questions (?), 2. The &quot;canned&quot; promotional interview for Hounds
      of Love, the questions were dubbed in later. (see the Conversation Disk
      Series CD entry). </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Kate Bush Interview&quot; is made in England under the &quot;Discussion
      Records&quot; lable. It's got a CD number as well but I recon it's a silly
      play on words and that's all. It's numbered &quot;NEVER 4 CD&quot;. The
      box it comes in says that it's a limited edition (I got #360) and also
      comes with some nice pictures inside. The actual CD cover is a beautiful
      KT picture. </P>
    
    <P>So, to the interview, ... it's a direct tapeing (about 45 mins long) in
      some very public place since there is a LOT of background noise. It's
      seems to me that it was taped just before the release of NFE since that's
      what most of the discussion's about. </P>
    
    <P>NOTE ON KATE'S VOICE </P>
    
    <P> Hearing recent interviews after a long spell of listening to some of
      the earlier interviews, it occurs to IED again that Kate has become an
      even more articulate and eloquent speaker than she was a decade ago. She
      has also radically reduced both the expressive range of her speaking voice
      and the &quot;South London&quot; accent which she used to assume in
      interview situations. For years it has seemed to IED that the now-forsaken
      &quot;popular&quot; accent which Kate used to sport during her public
      appearances was affected rather than ingrained, because no other members
      of Kate's family spoke with such an accent, and because its intensity
      seemed to vary depending upon the social and topical context in which she
      was speaking. Her present accent, which more closely approximates &quot;U&quot;
      diction, and which she has used with a new consistency over the past three
      years or so, is very likely another more or less calculated element in her
      promotional campaign for the post- Dreaming work, since it reinforces the
      seriousness and sobriety of thought and feeling which Kate has tried to
      communicate in her tone and choice of words since 1985, in a clear effort
      to correct her undeserved image as a naive and overly effusive
      flower-child.</P>

      <BR> Subject: This Woman's Live Work </P>
    
    <P>Btw, IED glimpsed Riuichi Sakamoto there yesterday. Yes, IED actually
      can recognize and identify musicians who have no connection with Kate
      Bush. However, because of his irrelevance to Kate's work, IED saw no point
      in engaging him in conversation. </P>
    
    <P>Also by the way, there are several gross errors of track identification
      on the new limited-edition import CD, &quot;This Woman's Live Work&quot;.
      For one thing, the first track on the CD is not from Saturday Night Live
      -- Kate didn't perform &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; on that show. On the
      other hand, IED doesn't recognize this live version of the song from any
      of the video performances which he has seen -- could this be an audio
      recording of the long-lost first-ever Kate Bush Top-of-the-Pops
      appearance? The penultimate track on the CD, Kate's live performance, with
      Peter Gabriel, of &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;, at Earl's Court, excuses the
      (high) price of the produKT. </P>

    <P>Marcel asks about the bootleg product(s) entitled &quot;If You Could See
      Me Fly&quot;: there are indeed two entirely unrelated recordings which go
      by that title. The first is a vinyl album containing excerpts from the
      Bill Duffield charity concert; the second is one of the two CDs that
      contain, between them, most of the so-called &quot;Cathy demos&quot; which
      (according to Love-Hounds' much-valued late intelligence) Kate doesn't
      much like to see on the market! This disk's companion CD is called &quot;Passing
      Through Air&quot;, which is confusing enough, too, since that was not only
      the title of Kate's own legitimately released b-side (from the Army
      Dreamers single), but also of a ca.-1985 bootleg multi-LP vinyl album
      which contained brazenly illegal transfers of most of Kate's b-sides to
      date, but no &quot;Cathy demos&quot;. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Re: The Single File version differences </P>
    
    <P>Just to clarify the question, here's the original (2nd) message again:
    </P>
    
    <P>Date: Fri, 5 Aug 1994 23:29:17 +0200
      <BR> From: endwar@phys.psu.edu (Andrew Russ)
      <BR> Subject: The Single File remixes/remasters (repost) </P>
    
    <P>I'm reposting this because i got no response to my (admittedly arcane)
      questions before. If i don't get any answers this time i'm forwarding the
      questions to Homeground for the next KaTe Convention trivia quiz. :-) </P>
    
    <P>I recently had the joy of getting The Single File (copy no. 2795) for an
      embarrasingly low price. Several singles were apparently remastered, and I
      was able to notice at least two audible changes on a casual listen: </P>
    
    <P> The Single File version of &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; fades while the
      original 7&quot; does not fade. I think the original single mix is thus
      about ten seconds longer, and the line &quot;Mommy's Dying&quot; that KaTe
      says at the end is cut off the Single File version. Also, the inscription
      &quot;Life Is To Love&quot; was not scratched into the Single File master.
      The matrix numbers are:</P>
    
    <P> original: EMI 5106 A 1
      <BR> Single File: EMI 5106 A-3-1-1-2
      <BR> The matrix numbers of the B-sides are identical. </P>
    
    <P> There was other musical difference i was able to find: my German copy
      of &quot;Babooshka&quot; has about 10 seconds more of the breaking glass
      effects at the end of the song than does my Single File version. </P>
    
    <P>Otherwise, i've noticed some of the wind-off groove inscriptions have
      been removed, and again the matrix numbers of those sides are changed (at
      least for the two that i can check against regular EMI issues: </P>
    
    <P>Breathing: </P>
    
    <P> A-side matrix numbers and inscription identical.
      <BR> B-sides differ:
      <BR> original: EMI 5058 B-3
      <BR> inscription: &quot;Happy Aniversary to the P's&quot;
      <BR> Single File: EMI 5058 B-4 </P>
    
    <P>The Dreaming: both sides have different matrix numbers: </P>
    
    <P> original:
      <BR> A side: TOWNHOUSE EMI 5296 A-1U-1-1-2
      <BR> A side inscription: &quot;For Rolf&quot;
      <BR> B side: TOWNHOUSE EMI 5296 B-1U-1-3-15
      <BR> Single File
      <BR> A side: EMI 5296-A-3-1-1-1
      <BR> B side: EMI 5296-B-3-1-1-1 </P>
    
    <P>I didn't detect any musical differences in either of these singles. </P>
    
    <P>The remastered sides of &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; and &quot;The Dreaming&quot;
      and &quot;Babooshka&quot; all have the matrix numbers in the same style of
      lettering, whereas the original matrix numbers (c.f. side two of &quot;Army
      Dreamers&quot; and both sides of &quot;Breathing&quot;) are in a smaller
      lettering (Thus i suspect the different matrix numbers for the second
      sides of my two copies of &quot;Breathing&quot; originate from the
      original single release rather than with the Single File). </P>
    
    <P>I would like to ask a few questions, though: </P>
    
    <P>1. How many copies of the limited edition of the Single File were
      issued? The four digit number would seem to indicate less than 10000. </P>
    
    <P>2. The signature on the inside cover of the booklet (with the
      inscription &quot;I hope you enjoy this collection&quot;) looks like a
      printed facsimile. Is it? </P>
    
    <P>3. Anybody have any idea if a copy of the Breathing single that is
      missing a side 1 label (the one with the many KaTes danging around the
      spindle hole) is any kind of rarity? My copy of this oddity has no picture
      sleeve. </P>
    
    <P>4. Anybody else noticed these (or other) musical differences between
      Single File versions of songs and original single mixes? I would expect
      that many of the songs were slightly remixed for the singles, so there
      might be slight variations from the album versions (and not so slight, as
      in the intro to &quot;The Man With the Child In His Eyes&quot;). </P>
    
    <P>5. Is my guess about the differences in lettering indicating remastered
      sides correct? Some expert may know. </P>
    
    <P>-------------8&lt;--------------- </P>
    
    <P>Now I put up a question in the air: has anyone verified if all given
      singles of the same kind are acoustically the same? Maybe changes like
      those two indicated in the above message also happened during repressings?
    </P>

      <BR> Subject: The Singles File...remixed versions? </P>
    
    <P>Well...I did some investigation to see if indeed the singles found in
      the boxed set (The Single File) differ from the original releases of those
      singles. Here's what I found so far: </P>
    
    <P> 1. &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; and &quot;Sat
      In Your Lap&quot; are identical musically. However, different plates have
      been used to press those singles (they probably all have different plates,
      this IS delt with in the Collector's Guide...) </P>
    
    <P> 2. Babooshka (The Single File) is DEFINITELY shorter by about 10
      seconds. I verified this against my UK and Japanese releases. </P>
    
    <P> 3. I was unable to check out Army Dreamers because it seems that both
      of my copies did in fact come from the boxed set. :-( So I still don't
      have an original release of Army Dreamers. Bummer! </P>
    
    <P>i still have to check Breathing, On Stage, Wuthering Heights and
      December... </P>
    
    <P>I won't be able to check &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;,
      &quot;Wow&quot;, &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; and &quot;Ne T'Enfuis Pas&quot;
      because I don't have seperate singles for them....yet!. I can check them
      with other sources though. i DO know that &quot;The Man...&quot; is
      probably the video version (&quot;He's here...he's here...&quot;)</P>
    
    <P>I will keep you posted... </P>
    
    <P>Can someone at least check out the 45s that I can't? Thank You </P>
    
    <P>Another thing we must keep in mind is: Are there differences between the
      original numbered release of the Single File and the subsequent unnumbered
      release? </P>

    <P>Hi! </P>
    
    <P>I did a little bit of research and came up with the following file which
      - in newer versions if I get more input - will be available from me on
      request, at least until I finally get my ISDN connection to the 'real
      internet' (soon now) and my new harddisk (also soon now). </P>
    
    <P>A smaller version (only highest position in each country) is now part of
      the FAQ (coming next week again). </P>
    
    <P>This is a very incomplete list of chart positions for Kate's singles,
      albums and video tapes. If you have further entries or corrections, feel
      free to speak up! </P>

    <P>Hallo friends, </P>
    
    <P>inspired by the reading in KBC No. 5 (5. april 1980): </P>
    
    <P>Interviewer: &quot;. . . Do you know anything about the messages
      scratched on the smooth circle just before the centre of the records?&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Kate: . . . I wrote them and they are messages to go with the record.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>I took all my records and inspected them carefully: </P>
    
    <P>Here are my results: </P>
    
    <P>Singles: </P>
    
    <P>- December will be magic again: &quot;Happy Christmas&quot;
      <BR> - The Dreaming: &quot;For Rolf&quot;
      <BR> - TWW, Picturedisk: &quot;Up yours ugly&quot;
      <BR> - The Red Shoes: A: &quot;One for the Arcters&quot;
      <BR> B: &quot;Buzzzz&quot;
      <BR> Rubberband Girl: &quot; . AMONT&quot;
      <BR> (very thin, maybe one more letter in front, any idea?) </P>
    
    <P>Maxis: </P>
    
    <P>- Moments of Pleasure: &quot;Alive and kicking&quot;
      <BR> - Rubberband Girl: &quot;Whack it on&quot; </P>
    
    <P>LPs </P>
    
    <P>- The Red Shoes: &quot;For H&quot; </P>
    
    <P>These engravings are sometimes difficult to identify. You should use a
      good lamp. There are also several single letters, sometimes appears
      -ORLAKE- and -TOWNHOUSE-. It seems to me that these messages only appear
      on UK records. However, most of my records are from Germany or Europe. So
      I think there can be many more messages. I would like to collect them.
    </P>
    
    <P>Best wishes </P>

    <P>Hello lovehounds; </P>
    
    <P>Someone recently asked about the &quot;secret messages&quot; that are
      etched near the runout groove of UK released vinyl. </P>
    
    <P>I went through my collection (one by one) and with the help of the
      Illustrated Collector's Guide To Kate Bush, here's what I found: </P>

    <P>I also checked interview picture disc and most had &quot;orlake&quot;.Perhaps
      Orlake is the name of the company that manufactures picture discs?? </P>
    
    <P>I also found &quot;Precision SM&quot;on the 7&quot; US release of Hounds
      Of Love.I don't think this has anything to do with Kate. what's this &quot;townhouse&quot;

    <P>The Townhouse and Orlake inscriptions are from the facilities where the
      vinyl was cut -- no special meaning. Kate's messages look much more like
      they were scratched in with a pin, sometimes so lightly they don't press
      very well. </P>

    <P>Townhouse is (was?) one of the best mastering studios in the world, i.e.
      the place where the dies that make the stampers that make the LPs are
      produced (sorry, I might have the terminology a bit skewed, but you know
      what I mean). </P>
    
    <P>Presumably 'Penthouse' is a pun on this (related to the infamous

    <P>&gt; what's this &quot;townhouse&quot; all about? </P>
    
    <P>Isn't Townhouse the vinyl manufacturing plant, or the company who's
      actually cutting the masters? That's my impression anyway. </P>

      <BR> Subject: There Goes a Tenner 7&quot; (runout groove msg.) </P>
    
    <P>Hello Love-hounds; </P>
    
    <P>Someone recently asked about the meaning of the message in the runout
      groove of side-A of There Goes a Tenner 7&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;RAYS&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>This is my guess: I think &quot;RAYS&quot; stands for Ray Staff. Ray
      Staff is credited on the picture sleeve for cutting the record. It says: &quot;cut
      by Ray Staff&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Does anybody out there have other explanations? </P>
    
    <P>peace ron </P>
