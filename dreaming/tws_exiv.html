<H3>From &quot;Melody Maker&quot; of October 25th : 
</H3>
<P>KATE BUSH bounces back into action this week with a new single for EMI and 
the promise of a compilation LP and video next month. The single is callled  &quot;Experiment
IV&quot; and is apparently about Kate's nightmare vision of a future where 
music usually a force for good, is harnessed by scientists as a weapon of
destruction. 
</P>
<P>The single comes in seven and 12 inch versions backed by a remixed version
of  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to which Kate has added a newly recorded
vocal. 
</P>
<P>Wheee! New Kate! Now let's just hope it doesn't get blocked from US release
by  some nasty record company...

<P>Kate's new single is called &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, and will be included
on her new  compilation LP &quot;The Whole Story&quot;. The LP is scheduled to
be released on  November 11 or 12 in England, and reportedly will include &quot;hits
and bits&quot;, whatever  that means. 
</P>
<P>Speaking out of total ignorance, of course, IED seems to remember very

</P>
<P>After considerable time wasted with the UC library computers, IED has given
up  searching for possible sources for Kate's latest subject, the use of sound
as a  weapon. If there was a real &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, she'll have to give
us more of a clue  than the name. The Experiment that IED was associating with
the Nazis was  &quot;Experiment E&quot;, altogether different. Somehow it seems
unlikely that MM is  accurately identifying the source as a futuristic idea of
Kate's. IED still thinks the  source is probably some movie or TV show in which
the Experiment was carried  out. Anybody got an idea? 
</P>
<P>The Whole Story will be a gatefold LP, with a black and white photo of Kate
on  the front cover, and color photos on the inside. The singles NOT included
are:  Hammer Horror, December Will Be Magic Again, There Goes a Tenner,
Suspended  in Gaffa (not a UK release to begin with), and the Big Sky (too
recently released,  IED supposes). All other UK single a-sides are included. No
clue what NME had in  mind when referring to &quot;hits and bits&quot;.

</P>
<P>Having read this, I slowly lowered the needle onto my new 12&quot;. What I
heard was  beyond description. GO OUT AND GET EXPERIMENT IV! Andy just may have 
been right with this one. It is absolutely incredible. I only had time to listen
to it a  couple of times last night and this morning, but I found myself humming
the damn  thing (in my head, anyway) all day long, today. The 12&quot; also
comes with a new vocal  of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and, I guess since
it's so close to &quot;The Season&quot; already,  &quot;December Will Be Magic
Again&quot;, which Kate first put out in 1980 on a 7&quot;. In other  words, you
get three *great* songs! 
</P>
<P>I don't know how many versions of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; I now have
(counting  bootlegs), but I know I could never get sick of it. And for those of
you who have  never heard &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;, it's really
a *very* pretty song.  Speaking of pretty, John Carder's photography is getting
better and better too. I  don't know if it's the unlimited studio time, or what,
but &quot;Experiment IV&quot; is one  smooth song. Kate has continued to amaze
me.

Subject: X4 reviews
</P>
<P>For those who haven't yet heard X4 (I just managed to get a copy a couple
days  ago -- these new import bans are horrible!), it is quite a nice song. It's
not as Andy  maintains the greatest natural phenomenon in the history of the
universe, because  that's &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I read a couple of reviews for &quot;Experiment IV&quot;. The review in the
NME said that  even when Kate Bush fails, she still manages to give the
impression that she's better  than just a pop star and that this song sounds
like Kate Bush has joined Bananarama.  The review in Sounds said that Kate Bush
manages to say in one song what a typical  science fiction writer would take a
trilogy to say. If the reviewer is talking about the  Piers Anthonies of the
world, this is not too surprising, since Kate spends as much  time on one song
as Piers Anthony spends on a trilogy. 
</P>
<P>I'm not so sure about this Bananara bit (Hey, I like &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;
as much as  the next guy, but...). What I think the reviewer means is that the
melody in  &quot;Experiment IV&quot; is very catchy. For me, this is by far
Kate's catchiest melody. The  song is very highly textured, however, though, so
it doesn't come across to me as  being exceedingly commercial. There are also
some extremely neat sounds in the  song. 
</P>
<P>The 12-inch single version is better than the normal version. It sort of
sounds like  Kate meets Klaus Schulze and Windam Hill (and Bananarama?). There
is a nice and  moody violin on the 12-inch that isn't on the normal mix. 
</P>
<P>I'm told that the video is really intense. Part of it involves Kate turning
into a  demon. Apparently the BBC won't allow part of it to be broadcast though.
They say  it isn't suitable for children. (Dicks!)

recorded it and  put it in to our machines&quot;

<P>From: Neil Calton &lt;nbc@vd.rl.ac.uk&gt; <BR> Date: Tue, 23 Dec 86
09:56:14 GMT <BR> Subject: Exp. IV, the film 
</P>
<P>Well, friday afternoon I type in a message saying I had not seen the
'Experiment  IV' film, then I go home switch on the TV and what do I see but
'Experiment IV'  on 'The Tube' - there must be a higher force after all! 
</P>
<P>Anyway, the video was directed by Kate herself and features two well-known 
character actors Peter Vaughan and Richard Vernon, plus two of the new wave of 
British comedians: Dawn French (from the Comic Strip) and Hugh Laurie (Saturday 
Live). 
</P>
<P>Assuming its not been shown in the US yet, the scenario is as follows:
(obvious  *** SPOILER *** for those who wish to be surprised by their first
viewing). 
</P>
<P>An old man (Vernon) enters a small shop called 'Music for Pleasure' which
leads  into a secret research lab. where he is met by a white-coated scientist
(French) and  taken to a small room filled with sound equipment controlled by
another scientist  (Laurie). They then go to see a military officer (Vernon) who
shows them a file  marked 'For the attention of Prof. Jerry Coe' and asks for 'a
sound that can kill'. 
</P>
<P>The Prof. is visibly upset but proceeds to record various sounds which are
then  played back to a man strapped up in a chair with electrodes all over him.
The sounds  cause a ghostly apparition of a girl with long blonde hair (Kate) to
be generated, who  floats around the guy before transmogrifying into a
nightmarish ghoul-like spectre.  At this, the Prof. attempts to switch off the
machine but the creature breaks out  causing everyone to drop down dead (through
fear, insanity ?). The military man is  then seen being brought tea by a
uniformed woman (Kate) who also transmutes into  the creature - with the
resulting demise of said officer. The film closes with the  scene around the
music shop being cordoned off and 'prohibited' signs being  errected by a
military man in a van. As the van drives off it stops to pick up a girl 
hitch-hiking (Kate) who turns to camera, winks and puts her finger to her mouth
-  still frame closes. 
</P>
<P>I enjoyed the film immensely and having taped it have viewed it several
times.  The special effects are good but not over-done and the 'creature' is a
truly  gruesome thing. The film conveys the insidious way in which innocent
research can  be corrupted by malicious government/military officials and the
fact that we may be  tampering with things we cannot control. The songs message
comes across well in  the video and the overall effect is quite disturbing. Yet
the final shot leaves just a hint  that Kate is also paying an acknowledgement
to such films as 'Invasion of the Body  Snatchers'. In addition, Kate seems to
be suggesting that she/the creature will only  be wreaking havoc on those who
create evil and not on the innocent i.e. us - her  audience, since she is taking
us into her confidence with the wink and the shush  gesture. 
</P>
<P>The fact that the Prof. is called Jerry Coe would seem an obvious pun on
Jericho  - whose walls came tumbling down at the sound of trumpets (if I have
got my  biblical facts right) - or does anyone know of a real Jerry Coe?

</P>
<P>Thanks once again, Neil. You're providing an invaluable service to Kate fans
in  the Western hemisphere. This film sounds like the best one Kate has done so
far. 
</P>
<P>In the latest issue of Homeground, one of the fans who played a dead body in
the  &quot;X4&quot; film made reference to two or three sources for the subject
of the song and the  film. (He didn't say where he'd heard of these sources, but
pretty clearly he'd  learned of them from Kate during the filming.) One was a
nightmare Kate herself  had had. Another was a true story of a French scientist
working with sonics who  created a huge steam whistle, which actually did kill
several people, including  himself. Then there was either a movie or a
television show which involved the same  idea, and the name Professor Jericho
was used in that. IED will go home and check  the article to get these facts
straighter for a future posting, but this may help to clear  up your question
about the name. Of course, your association of Jericho with the  trumpet and the
tumbling walls is completely correct, Neil. 
</P>
<P>Also, the writer claims, experiments in sonic weaponry are being conducted
even  as we speak by both superpowers...

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: X4, sources
</P>
<P>Just to update those interested about the sources for &quot;Experiment IV&quot;,
here is  the relevant passage from Homeground No. 25, written by Peter
Fitzgerald-Morris: 
</P>
<P>&quot;'Experiment IV' originated in a story that Kate heard about a
scientist in  France who built a giant steam powered whistle to assess the
effects of the sound.  The effect was simple -- it killed him and a number of
people in the surrounding  area. That area had to be cordoned off and the public
kept out until the device  powering the whistle ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>The next happening was a nightmare, where scientists engaged in benign 
research into the effects of sound had their work perverted by the military, who
 wanted a sound that would kill. 
</P>
<P>This concept is, however, no fantasy. The 'sound cannon' has been chased by 
defense establishments across the world. A European version of the idea was
indeed  known as the 'Jericho Trumpet', after the Old Testament prophet's
exploits with  the walls of the celebrated city. There is current research both
in the US and in the  USSR on sonic waves and disturbance patterns to destroy
property and kill people.&quot;

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: X4, the film
</P>
<P>&quot;'Experiment IV'-- The Movie&quot; appeared last night on the USA's
still  omnipotent cable video channel for the first time. It was, however,
apparently edited,  although most of the film had been left intact. Several
interesting facts about &quot;X4&quot;. 
</P>
<P>First, the body which has elsewhere been referred to as &quot;steaming&quot;,
and which  has been described as appearing somewhere near the end of the
original version --  thus precipitating considerable argument within the
interior ranks of the British  television industry -- is nowhere to be seen in
the American corporation's  reproduction. This would appear to indicate, Watson,
that some editing -- probably  unauthorized by the artist herself -- was
undertaken prior to the screening of the  film in America; and certainly the
synchronization of the music with the imagery at  the conclusion of the altered
film creates a singular effect -- one scarcely warranted  under the present
circumstances, given the implication of the song's subject and  theme. 
</P>
<P>Second, Watson -- and here, unless I is very much mistaken, you will
recognize  the agency of a new and particularly fearsome and pestilential evil
-- Kate has  changed the music (much as she did in &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;) in
order to meet the  exigencies of her filmic vision! On this occasion, Watson,
she has introduced into the  midst of the song an instrumental episode which
prominently features the very same  VIOLIN passage around which much of the
TWELVE-INCH mix revolves. And yet,  though it's I who say(s) it, so subtly has
Kate altered this passage -- so slyly and  cunningly has she merged this snippet
of transcendent violinistry with the rhythmic  basis of the original single mix
-- that it constitutes, in sum, no mere augmentation,  but, in truth, a positive
and laudible improvement over the song in its first stage of  genesis. 
</P>
<P>Also, the very end of the film, wherein Kate's character boards the van and 
smiles conspiratorially at the camera, was omitted by MTV.

<P>Date: Sat, 14 Feb 87 13:15 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: the violin passage
</P>
<P>One remarkable thing about the violin solo (quite apart from the mere rarity
of a  real violin -- as opposed to typically foolish hick fiddling) is that the
music is NOT  &quot;weepy&quot; at all; the root of the melody is modal, not
tonal, and completely unrelated  to usual formulae; in this sense (as said
before) it is similar to &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;  by Vaughn-Williams,
which also derives much of its melodic and harmonic content  from ancient native
(usually Celtic) sources. Another exceptional thing about this  violin line is
the fact that Kate has incorporated it seamlessly into the SEVEN-inch  version
-- and, especially, into the video re-mix -- despite its apparently unrelated 
mood. The mystery therefore arises whether the violin passage was conceived
first,  or built up after the rest of the track had already taken shape. NO-ONE
else in pop  music has been able to turn one recording in such radically
different expressive  directions AT THE SAME TIME. There are at least five
unprecedented touches of  production in &quot;X4&quot;. How many innovations are
required before you deem something  &quot;dynamic&quot;, anyway?

Experiment IV Message 
</P>
<P>To Andrew Marvick: 
</P>
<P>After an hour of messing around with cassette snippets of the &quot;secret&quot;
message in  Experiment IV, from both the 7&quot; and 12&quot; versions, I have
not only thoroughly messed  up my mind, but reached some conclusions. It sounds
as if someone (or some  electronic device) is twiddling the signal between left
and right channels. I'm not  quite sure what you mean by the &quot;sss&quot;
sounds, unless you are referring to the  background noises, which I was not
concentrating on. 
</P>
<P>The message could very well be &quot;I bet my mum's gonna give me a little
toy&quot; -  what I mean by that is, it may or may not be, but I have no better
ideas, and since I  have your interpretation in mind, it colors my judgement
when I listen to the track.  You're probably right, although I noticed on the 12&quot;
version, the word &quot;toy&quot; sounds  more like &quot;tie&quot; and tends to
speed up and vanish into the mix a lot faster than it does  on the 7&quot;
version.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: mystery track 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Joe and Jon for their fascinating ideas re interpreting backwards 
tracks/lyrics to KT. This is what the essence of L-Hs is all about! 
</P>
<P>Jon Drukman 
</P>
<P>Well, first of all, the &quot;X4&quot; message is apparently only forwards
(not that you said  otherwise). Kate seems to have treated the spoken section in
just about the same  way she treated the &quot;scatter-voice&quot; (IED's term,
for want of a better one) from  &quot;Waking the Witch&quot;: i.e., she shifted
it very rapidly from left to right channels.  However, it doesn't sound as
though that's all that she did with it. First, there's a  lot of echo on the
voice in both sections; second, the voice doesn't really &quot;travel&quot; 
from left to right and back, but &quot;jumps&quot; there, using a cut-out of
some kind. And  third, there seem to be other noises, especially in the &quot;X4&quot;
passage: IED suggested  that they sounded like 's' sounds, but that doesn't make
sense. 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, even when listened to in mono, there is still some noise to be
heard  in addition to the spoken line and the instrumental music. As for the
slight  difference you noticed in the twelve-inch's mix of the message, IED
noticed exactly  the same distortion of the last word, and assumed it had to do
with the mix only, or  the way it was taken out of one mix and spliced, so to
speak, into the other; but since  he really isn't certain that the message is
what he said it was anyway, he remains  open to suggestions. The whole tone of
the twelve-inch mix of the message seems  different, doesn't it?

<P>Just spent the last hour listening to the hidden track in X4 at various

</P>
<P>Regarding Experiment IV: 
</P>
<P>I listened to it for another hour and I couldn't hear anything about a &quot;symphony&quot;
 or anything about a &quot;little toy&quot; in the section between &quot;It
could sing you to sleep&quot; and  &quot;But that dream is your enemy&quot;.
Bearing IED's suggestion in mind it is possible to  hear &quot;I bet my mum's...&quot;
but I wasn't completely convinced. 
</P>
<P>On the 12&quot; mix it sounds like she's saying: 
</P>
<P>&quot;... experiment ... prove it to me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Then it sounds like John Carder Bush saying something like: 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's time for&quot; or perhaps &quot;... five&quot; then 
</P>
<P>&quot;experiment four, experiment four, experiment four, experiment four, 
experiment four.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Then there is the part with the broken up voice (this comes after &quot;But
that  dream is your enemy&quot;) where Kate is singing a high pitched &quot;eee
eee eee eee&quot; on  one side of the headphones (sounds sort of like the sound
track of &quot;Psycho&quot; during  the famous shower scene). There is also a
broken up voice in the center and on the  other side which seems to be mixed
with another voice. I can't tell what either voice  is saying but it sounds like
one of them finishes with the word &quot;like&quot; at the end of  each of the
two measures that this sequence spans. Anybody have any ideas?

<P>After the diversion caused by BKtmM, I am back to trying to figure out the 
hidden message in X4 (if anyone still gives a shit about that). I have become
quite  convinced that this phrase and the &quot;Five, Experiment 4, Experiment 4&quot;
heard later in  the 12&quot; version are meant to be comments being made by
people running the  experiment. However, my previous interpretation &quot;I get
blasts from too many  instruments&quot; appears to have been blown out of the
water when I greatly reduced  the playback speed (dropping the vocal app. 2
octaves) and started hearing 12  syllables (vs. 10 I previously heard). The
phrase &quot;...too many instruments&quot; still  sounds clear though. I think
I'll give this up until it becomes a puzzle in the Kate  Bush Club newsletter
and start working on &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;...

listening to that  damn X4 message. As an engineer that spends considerable time
in laboratory  testing, this message and the subsequent passage &quot;Five,
Experiment 4&quot; sound like the  types of things that might be said during the
running of the test. And I can't help  but feel that this passage, and the WYWM

<P>Bill Mayhew writes: 
</P>
<P>&gt; While this isn't exactly electronic, the Germans in WW II experimented
with a  battlefield device which burned propane in a quarter wave stub. The
energy  released by the combustion process generated a lethal shockwave that
vibrated the  enemy to pieces. The weapon was not terribly useful due to its
poor directionality. 
</P>
<P>Bell Labs and Western Electric conducted extensive research in the military 
applications of sound during the latter 1930's and during WW II. Some of this 
research is still classified. 
</P>
<P>One project which became rather public was called &quot;Project Whistle&quot;.
This work  was begun in the late 1930's, and one of its efforts was to
investigate the acoustics of  sirens and develop devices which were more
efficient. At the time, sirens were only 1  to 2 percent efficient with respect
to acoustic energy versus total energy input. 
</P>
<P>While one compelling reason to develop powerful sirens was use as an air
raid  warning device, the other classified reason was for their use as a
potential weapon.  By 1941 a truly mamouth siren was constructed and mounted on
a flatbed truck. It  used a turbine air compressor powered by a 100 hp gasoline
engine, along with  another 20 hp engine to operate the rotor in the siren. This
&quot;siren&quot; developed a  frequency of 440 Hz which was - believe it or not
- virtually a square wave. 
</P>
<P>Tests and acoustic measurements were &quot;quietly&quot; conducted at a
remote area in  New Jersey, until a public test was ready. In early 1942 the
siren was parked on the  Manhattan Bridge in NYC and tested. The siren was so
loud that it produced  something like 90 dB at TWO MILES. Now that's LOUD! 90 dB
is at the begining  threshhold of ear damage for prolonged exposure. 
</P>
<P>This siren was later mass-produced (on a small scale, though), and was
called the  &quot;Chrysler-Bell Victory Siren&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Out of curiosity, do any Bell Labs people out in Netland know if any of
these  sirens still exist?

<P>Greetings again, all. And special thanks to Tracy and Andrew for making the 
Santa Cruz bash such a success. 
</P>
<P>At long last I've started acquiring copies of the official videos on
laserdisc for  careful perusal. Those discs at the party, Corey, were Andrew's,
not mine, and our  gratitude should be rightfully be his. 
</P>
<P>At any rate, I present installment #1 of Dave's Excessively Trivial

<P>If you hadn't noticed, we never see the interior of the shop from the

not the location. 
</P>
<P>Not only is the shopkeeper counting out his fresh copies of Kate's newest
single,  but a copy is already stuck to an interior pillar of the shop at the
left. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Coe enters the shop at exactly 12 noon, according to the wall clock
above the  real entrance. 
</P>
<P>As we noted before, the officer has a folder labeled &quot;The Whole Story&quot;
before  him, and another labeled &quot;Experiment V&quot; facing Dr. Coe. 
</P>
<P>The microphones at the foot of the bed in the delivery room are not
connected to  anything yet. 
</P>
<P>Where do the flying papers come from when the device shatters the control 
booth window? 
</P>
<P>Dr. Coe must be left-handed; his watch is visible as he reaches for the main
 switch. It appears to read 5:20, which would be consistent with the
Venetian-blind  shadows throughout the rest of the video.

</P>
<P>OK, enough of that. Let IED bore his readers on some other Kate Bushological
 topics now. 
</P>
<P> First, let IED commend and thank Dave Hsu for taking the time to study the 
recent videos again and alert IED to a number of remarkable details of which he 
had been unaware. 
</P>
<P>Dave, you suggest that the interior Music For Pleasure shop scenes seem to
have  been done in a separate, interior, set. Perhaps so, but IED reminds
Love-Hounds that  the Newsletter reported that the shop was so realistic that
several passersby &quot;walked  into the shop&quot;, thinking it was a real
music shop. So whatever was there must have  been pretty thorough. 
</P>
<P>Dave notes the presence of yet another X4 single-sleeve in the shop. Have
all  Love-Hounds noticed, as well, the dijeridu on the right-hand wall? Or the
strumento  da porco? The balalaika and two mandolins? The trombone? Kate's own
Celtic harp  and her Babooshka bass viol? 
</P>
<P>Dave, IED must conclude that the papers which fly through the cracked window
 in the Sonic Experiments room can only originate--from the monster's mouth! 
There's no other possible source, unless...unless... unless Kate made 
a...a...continuity error? Naaahhh... 
</P>
<P>Thanks again for your observations, Dave. Fascinating stuff.

</P>
<P>I think I may have deciphered the backing vocal in Experiment IV just before
 the line &quot;But that dream is your enemy&quot; after listening to the
five-second clip only  about fifty times (I lost count after 34). 
</P>
<P>I believe the words are &quot;I must thank you for listening to my tune.&quot;

</P>
<P>There are so many overdubs with varying shifts and volumes that it's hard to
tell  right where the main line begins and what is a pre-echo. 
</P>
<P>There are still a couple points I'm not quite clear on: 
</P>
<P>1. There seems to be two sylables of the same volume before the first word
in the  above sentence. These could be 
</P>
<P>A) Two real sylables in the same track that add meaning to the sentence. If
this  is the case they may be, &quot;I feel,&quot; yielding, &quot;I feel I must
thank you...&quot; 
</P>
<P>B) Two 'warm-up' pre-repetitions of, &quot;I&quot;, yileding, &quot;I I I
must...&quot; 
</P>
<P>C) The beginnings of two tracks of the same sentence but with a negative
time  shift. 
</P>
<P>2. The word, &quot;tune&quot; doesn't quite sound right. There seems to be a
ch sound  between the t and the u, 'tchune'. Maybe this isn't even the the right
word. 
</P>
<P>I found that having the 1K, 2K and 4K channels on the equalizer full-blast
and all  the rest all the way off gives the best voice-to-instrumentation ratio.

</P>
<P>I'm going to give it a couple more runs tonight before I go to bed, but I
just had  to post these preliminary findings.

<P>Ryan McGuire comes up with a very intriguing theory about the secret message

<P>IED hears:

<P>Several of these syllables correspond closely with each other, though of
course the  meaning is entirely different. What we need is more people to have a
go at  deciphering the message. Any of you interested? It can be heard in X4,

08:01:25 GMT <BR> Subject: Another shot at X4 mystery message 
</P>
<P>In a couple of recent submissions, Ryan McGuire and IED discuss their 
interpretations of a line of mystery text buried within Experiment IV. 
</P>
<P>Ryan hears:  I think I must thank you for listening to my tune, 
</P>
<P>While IED hears:  I bet my mum's gonna buy me a little toy instrument. 
</P>
<P>And I hear some variation on: 
</P>
<P>I've got my/mine muzzle(d) and they came in tune(d) to destruct/destroy. 
</P>
<P>Actually, I hear everything up to the word &quot;tune&quot; pretty clearly,
at least on the  CD copy, where it's easy to play tiny fragments over and over
again very rapidly.  It's less clear on vinyl, and even less clear on the vinyl
extended version. (In that  version, the line is still present, but easier to
miss because the preceding cue line &quot;It  could sing you to sleep&quot; is
missing.) The vocal IS buried beneath multiple instrument  tracks, but seems to
be a single continuous vocal -- not chopped up, back-masked,  pieced together or
shifted about in any tricky manner. The difficulty comes from  the phrasing
(slightly odd) and mainly from the overlying instruments. For example,  Ryan
mentioned: 
</P>
<P>&gt;2. The word, &quot;tune&quot; doesn't quite sound right. There seems to
be a ch sound  between the t and the u, 'tchune'. Maybe this isn't even the the
right word. 
</P>
<P>I don't want to put words in Ryan's ears, but what I *think* he's hearing
over  the word &quot;tune&quot; is part of the rhythm track. There's a constant &quot;tch-tch-tch-tch&quot;
 throughout. That's the same reason I'm not sure about the d on the end of  &quot;tune(d)&quot;.

</P>
<P>The last word is more of a guess. What I hear best is &quot;destruct&quot;,
pronounced  &quot;dee-struct&quot;. That's less grammatically correct than &quot;destroy&quot;
might be, but not if  the sentence is read as if &quot;DESTRUCT&quot; were a
setting, not as part of the incorrect  infinitive &quot;to destruct&quot;.
Really, it could be another word entirely. 
</P>
<P>To complicate things further, I think there's another buried line later in
the  song, and it's sounds impossible to make out. 
</P>
<P>Next opinion?...

<P>ied called for more input on the seKreT message in experiment iv. so, after 
listening to the excerpt in question for about fifty times on my poor cassette
deck (i  haven't decided that it is worth it to shell out the $$$ for only one
new song on cd),  i must say that my ears hear something more akin to what ied
hears, rather than  ryan mcguire's sentence. 
</P>
<P>for a while, i felt that i was hearing something more like: 
</P>
<P>i bet my mug's gonna give me an implement 
</P>
<P>with the word implement looped an extra time at the end of the sentence, but
 about twenty listens later with the low-end frequencies boosted, i could
discern the  word separation into what *could* be the phrase that ied purports
to hear (&quot;...a little  toy instrument&quot;). i'm still not sure exactly
what i'm hearing at that point, but i will  concede that his phrase is quite
possible. i'll also admit that ied's makes a bit more  sense then what i
originally heard, but one must remember that KaTe has probably  masked the words
so that phonetic sounds gets muffled - what i wrote is the  *sounds* that i
hear, rather then the words they might map to.

<P> Well...in an interview Kate confessed that she had fallen behind the
software  revisions of the Fairlight, and that she wasn't computer-oriented
enough to dive in  learn all the new features. In the same interview she
mentioned that the complexity  of &quot;Page R&quot; (the Fairlight drum
program) was one of the principle reasons that Del  did most of the rhythm
programming for the albums. 
</P>
<P>What I'd like to know is...has any U.K. Love-Hound figured out what machine 
Kate had on her desk in the &quot;Wogan&quot; Exp. IV ? The display looked a bit
odd; one  column of text scrolling up the right-hand side. It definitely wasn't
a Fairlight  display. 
</P>

<P> Kate: 
</P>
<P>I don't really know why people think my songs are strange. Perhaps because I
 bath in goats milk!! It's not something you should really ask me. My Mum could 
probably help you more. It's probably something to do with my childhood.

<P>&gt; 5) That mysterious Madame Maria Nanky, whose cover version of &quot;Poor
Old  Flea&quot; Kate favors, gets a thank-you in the HoL acknowledgements. 
</P>
<P> Pretty Good Authority (PGA) tells us that Madame Maria Nanky, Enrico
Baratta,  Reverand Normal and others are fictional characters invented quite a
while ago by  Kate and her brother Paddy. Sharp-eyed viewers might be able to
spot Mr. Baratta  in the Experiment IV video as the silhouette visible through
the window of the  Major's (?) office as Kate/Monster brings in the tea.

<P>&gt; Yes, I noticed the different ending to RutH when I saw TLTCTC at the 
Edinburgh UCI last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Also, I think the Experiment IV video was also slightly different
around the  point where the &quot;sound siren&quot; turns into the &quot;sound
demon&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Now that you mention it, I remember doing a double-take at that point, but I
 couldn't think then, or now, what exactly was different about it. We had
thought  about going again on Monday, the last night it played, but we got
caught up in  something else. Mark Semich went Monday, and said that there were
only 4 people  in the audience that showing. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Although all the promo videos (but not TLTCTC) were film transfers of
video,  they looked much better than on VHS tape - first time I noticed the
Experiment IV  singles on the counter inside the Music for Pleasure shop! 
</P>
<P>We were looking forward to seeing the videos (well, especially Cloudbusting)
on  film, but we're not complaining. I'd seen the singles in X4 before, but it's
true that  they were especially visible on the big screen. We also noticed PDFM
walking down  the hall for the first time. Yikes! How could we have missed
that?? There's so much  to said about seeing certain things in the theater if a
person has the chance. I'm  glad we had the chance.

<P>I hope there is answer to this, the QUINTESSENTIAL Kate Bush question - in 
Experiment IV the lyric says &quot;so they told us that they wanted a noise that
would  kill someone form a distance, so ............. ??? 
</P>
<P>I listened to the song ten thousand times and still cant figure it out.
HELP! 
</P>
<P>PS. I remember hearing an eight minute or so version of the same song buy
never  found it in record stores . IDEAS?

<P>Hmmm, off the top of my head I remember it going &quot;... they told us all
they  wanted was a sound the could kill someone from a distance, so they go
ahead and  the meters are over in the red ...&quot; As for meaning, well I don't
know how many  people out there know that the British government played around
back in the 50's  and 60's with many different and horrible methods ending
somebodies life. 
</P>
<P>One of the ideas toyed with was the use of sound weapons. The concept, if I 
remember right, was to use an ultra-sonic sound wave that would work at the 
frequency of water molecules. A dreadful, non-discriminating weapon and an 
extreamly painful death. Kate changed the idea from a ultra-sonic sound to just
a  sound. What kind of sound can kill? She uses a mix of terrible sounds (&quot;the
painful  cries of mothers to the the terrifying scream&quot;) all mixed to
gather into a &quot;killing  sound&quot;.

<P>Kath asks about the tall young man in the X4 video. Yes, Kath, the actor in 
question is indeed Hugh Laurie, the fellow who plays (wonderfully) Bertram 
Wilberforce Wooster alongside Stephen Fry's Jeeves. The two have been a comedy 
duo for years in England, and each has done quite a lot on his own, as well.
(Also  notice comedienne Dawn French in the X4 video, as well as several
distinguished UK  philocanines!)

<P>Dead bodies supplied by the fine folks at Homeground. Editor Peter 
Fitzgerald-Morris can be seen in the film (tall man with a full dark beard and 
glasses.) Proof that you can't pay people to lie in cold mud all day long. But
rabid  Kate fans *will* lie in cold mud all day long for a chance to meet Kate.
For free.

<P>It's a pun. Biblically speaking, the walls of the city Jericho were
