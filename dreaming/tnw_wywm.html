      <BR> Subject: Strange messages, Backward vocals </P>
    
    <P>You know what's *really* neat?!?! (Old time net.music readers will
      already know this...) On &quot;The Dreaming&quot; there is a two-way
      message that is sung at the end of &quot;Leave It Open&quot;. When you
      play it forwards it sings &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;. And when
      you play it backwards it sings &quot;And they said they would not let me
      in&quot;! Not only does it say something both forwards and backwards, but
      the backwards meaning is the negation of the forward meaning! I wish I
      knew how John Barrett and Kate did this! </P>
    
    <P>Now on &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, it sounds to me that there are all
      sorts of backwards vocals. (Kate once said that her favorite song is John
      Lennon's &quot;Number Nine Dream&quot; and that she loves all the backward
      vocals in it.) There are backward vocals in &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;
      and in &quot;Waking The Witch&quot;. Unfortunately, these backward vocals
      still sound backward to me when I play them backward! Does anyone else
      have any idea what they are saying? Or is Kate just pulling a practical
      joke on us? On &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, she put in singing that sounds
      forwards no matter which way you play it. And on &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
      she put in singing that sounds backwards no matter which way you play it?
    </P>
    
    <P>There is another two way message on HOL, though. In &quot;Watching You
      Without Me&quot;, right after the part that sounds backwards, there is
      singing that sounds like &quot;really see&quot; repeated several times.
      But when you play this backwards, it *still* sounds like &quot;really see&quot;!

      <BR> From: harvard!topaz!jerpc.PE.UUCP
      <BR> Subject: backwards vocals </P>
    
    <P>The following is the reply to a whole day's digest which Doug sent me
      because of some problems with Harvard's mailer... please forgive the
      lengthiness of it. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; The vocals on &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; sounded to me
      like they might be forward vocals sung in some foreign language and
      processed a little to sound backward. That would explain why they still
      sound backward when played backwards. ... </P>
    
    <P>&gt; There are some forward vocals on &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;
      and/or &quot;Waking The Witch&quot; that sound like they are combined with
      a square-wave or something, and they are somewhat intelligible, so she has
      definitely processed forward vocals to make them sound weird elsewhere on
      the album. </P>
    
    <P>I think both of these effects are produced just by amplitude-modulating
      the vocals. On an analog synthesizer like mine, you would do this by
      running the vocals through a voltage-controlled amplifier and applying an
      appropriate signal to the control voltage input: a square wave to produce
      the chopped vocals, and an envelope generator (triggered on the original
      vocal envelope) set to produce a slow attack and abrupt release to make
      the &quot;backwards vocals&quot; effect. People usually recognize
      backwards vocals because they have a slow attack (amplitude wise) with an
      abrupt decay, which is backwards from normal. The same is true of string
      instruments, which is how Steve Howe produces all the strange guitar
      effects (e.g., the organ-like chords accompanying the words &quot;Will
      continue&quot;) in the song &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;. It sounds likely she
      would do this sort of thing, since she apparently also runs some of her
      vocals on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; through a guitar sound processing
      device (a &quot;Flanger&quot; or &quot;Phlanger&quot;, or something like
      that. However, I don't know how those work.). </P>
    
    <P>Of course, with these modern, digital synthesizers like the Fairlight,
      it's probably called the &quot;Page 198, Option 57&quot; or something,
      instead... I've always felt a little disappointed to encounter all these
      people who only know how to work the options on digital synthesizers...
    </P>
    
    <P>I always thought the square-wave sounds were supposed to be an obscure
      reference to drugs, like on the Firesign Theatre albums... (at least
      that's what someone told me once). </P>

      <BR> Subject: backwards vocals </P>
    
    <P>&gt; From: Jeff Richardson </P>
    
    <P>&gt;&gt; [Me:] And when you play it backwards it sings &quot;And they
      said they would not let me in&quot;! </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I've tried this several times, and I can't hear the word &quot;not&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>I made a typo. It sounds like &quot;And they said they wouldn't let me
      in&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; This makes me think that they've recorded the two messages
      separately in normal, forward voices, then reversed one of them, then
      combined the two signals together. </P>
    
    <P>I think so too. But it *definitely* wasn't done by adding the two
      signals together. It's *way* too good for that. My guess is that they did
      some sort of weird interpolation using Fourier transforms and stuff like
      that that I don't understand. I bet the Fairlight allows you to
      interpolate signals like that so that you can mix two sounds together and
      get a new sound that sounds like a cross between the two rather than the
      sum of the two. </P>
    
    <P>I even wrote a letter to Kate several months back asking if that's how
      she did it, but I never got an answer. Oh well. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; The vocals on &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; sounded to me
      like they might be forward vocals sung in some foreign language and
      processed a little to sound backward. That would explain why they still
      sound backward when played backwards. Does anybody else think they might
      be in a foreign language? </P>
    
    <P>I've played this backwards some more and I think I've deciphered some of
      it. Part of it sounds like &quot;He was long... he was long... he was
      longing... &lt;mumble&gt;&lt;mumble&gt;&lt;mumble&gt;&quot;. This makes
      perfect sense with respect to the subject matter of the song. </P>
    
    <P>&gt;&gt; [Me:] There is another two way message on HOL, though. In &quot;Watching
      You Without Me&quot;, right after the part that sounds backwards, there is
      singing that sounds like &quot;really see&quot; repeated several times.
      But when you play this backwards, it *still* sounds like &quot;really see&quot;!
    </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I think that's one of the ones that sounds to me like it's combined
      with a &gt; square-wave. If it's the one I'm thinking of, it sounds like &quot;listen
      to me&quot; &gt; and &quot;talk to me&quot;, but I'll have to check it out
      tonight. </P>
    
    <P>No, it's shortly before that. The chopped up speech is something
      different. There's chopped up speech in both &quot;Watching&quot; and &quot;Waking&quot;.
      In &quot;Watching&quot; it sounds something like &quot;Help me baby, help
      me. Don't do this to me, baby. Listen to me. Talk to me. Wake up, baby,
      wake up.&quot; In &quot;Waking&quot; it sounds something like &quot;Wake
      up, wake up baby. Bless me father, bless me father, for I have sinned. UH!
      Listen to me. Listen to me. Help me, baby. UH! Talk to me.&quot; </P>

      <BR> Subject: SOS </P>
    
    <P>&gt; From: Mark Mallett </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Another thing that I didn't notice is that in the song &quot;Watching
      you Without Me&quot; (which while I listen to it is my favorite, like many
      of the others) at about 2:06 into the song there is a morse code sequence
      in the background which spells out &quot;SOS&quot; three times. </P>
    
    <P>You are right. Thanks for pointing this out! If anyone else notices
      things like this, please post them! </P>
    
    <P>Everyone I talk to thinks that &quot;Watching You&quot; is one of the
      best songs on the album. I dunno why, because it's my least favorite, but
      that's still pretty damned good. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I really don't think that it was recorded very well. It may be that
      I have a bad copy. The level is extremely high-- and it seems to come out
      sounding flat as a result. About 26 seconds into the last song there is a
      very bad sounding stretch. Again, maybe it is just my copy. </P>
    
    <P>I haven't noticed any of this. I don't think the recording is *great*,
      but it's not bad. I don't think the dynamic range could be any more
      --there's already some stuff going on that's so soft I can't hear it
      unless I turn it up so that everything else is painfully loud. </P>
    
    <P>I can understand hiss. It turns out that KB's studio is only 24 tracks,
      so she must have to do a lot of bouncing, and it's not digital either.
    </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, with this album, and with &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, my
      speakers can't deal with the amount of high frequency energy, my
      headphones can't deal with the amount of low frequency energy, and my car
      speakers can't deal with either. These have no problems with most other
      music I listen to.... </P>

      <BR> Subject: New KBC competition </P>
    
    <P>As usual, all verbiage from this correspondent concerns KT and KT only.
    </P>
    
    <P>The latest KBC Newsletter has apparently made it official: there is now
      a competition underway to decipher &quot;what Kate is saying&quot; in &quot;Watching
      You Without Me&quot;, although the announcement does a bad job of
      pinpointing the position of this message within the track. The message
      still makes no more sense backwards than it does forwards, although it is
      clear that something is being said. There are two distinct sections, the
      second being a repeated phrase saying something like &quot;Really see&quot;
      (this is Doug Alan's hearing, not mine: could the words not be &quot;We
      receive,&quot; or even &quot;We recede&quot;?). </P>
    
    <P>I will shortly submit to Love-Hounds a transcription of the first
      section as heard by me, but without any confidence of its accuracy. What
      interest me even more, however, are the two or three seconds immediately
      preceding this &quot;backwards&quot; track, during which time the Morse
      code signal for &quot;S-O-S&quot; can be clearly heard. I have no trouble
      with that message; however, if those moments are listened to again,
      another sound, like that of a high-pitched, wavering short-wave radio
      transmission, also becomes audible. Could this not be another message in
      Morse code, put on a loop and then sped up to nearly inaudible Hz levels?
      Who can clarify for me? </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU
      <BR> Subject: backwards message </P>
    
    <P>The precise location of the &quot;backwards&quot; track in &quot;Watching
      You Without Me&quot; is at bar 64, ending at bar 78 (12 bars); this
      translates as from 2:19 into the track to 2:48 (30 seconds). I think
      Paddy's entertaining demonstration of how a backwards track is done was
      too simplistic. There is more going on here than simply learning the way a
      phrase sounds when played backwards and then singing those sounds,
      recording the vocal normally. </P>
    
    <P>First, there is Kate's tendency to distort the sounds as she records
      them, through God knows how many bizarre devices (the harmonizer being
      only one of many, I am sure). </P>
    
    <P>Second, there are the odd echoes of rhythm that can be heard behind the
      vocal when the record is played normally, which sound very much like truly
      &quot;backwards&quot; tracks. This would not be the case if all the sounds
      had been &quot;learned&quot; and then recorded normally. A similar &quot;backwardsiness&quot;
      can be detected in the &quot;weirdness&quot; passage from &quot;Leave It
      Open&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>This brings up the third and I think most important reason for
      distrusting Paddy's simple explanation, namely, that words do indeed seem
      to come out of the &quot;weirdness&quot; passage when it is played
      backwards. After all, Kate seemed to be playing a joke on fans when it
      turned out the &quot;weirdness&quot; message was a forwards message after
      all. Isn't it likely that she's playing a joke now, as well? The problem
      is, we're ready for her, and she knows it; therefore, I'm convinced, the
      new puzzle is somehow more complicated than the first one. </P>
    
    <P>Heard forwards, these are the phonetics I'm hearing (these are *very*
      tentative): &quot;Zwoh neekh lawv zwoh neekh lawveet&quot; (rest) &quot;eeb
      vee nahd widthawng ee noy&quot; (repeat) </P>
    
    <P>N.B.: The music book wrongly begins this passage at bar 65, one of
      dozens of such errors to be found within the &quot;official&quot;
      transcription. </P>
    
    <P>This passage is then succeeded by what I believe is a separate message,
      the one which consists of the repeated message &quot;Really see,&quot; or &quot;We
      receive,&quot; or &quot;We recede&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Can anyone make sense of any of this? </P>

      <BR> Subject: details </P>
    
    <P>Doug thought L-Hs might appreciate the following bit about The Ninth
      Wave, taken from a letter from IED to Break-Through. It's an
      interpretation of one of the teensy-weensy details in the recording. What
      similar contributions can the L-Hs make in response? </P>
    
    <P>Frank brings up another extremely interesting point about the barely
      audible details in &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;, on which I think I
      can shed some light. At the very beginning, two male voices can be heard
      speaking. After many fruitless listenings, it suddenly hit me what was
      going on. If you count along with the beat from the very first down-beat
      of the recording, voicing only the first beat of each bar (that is,
      voicing ONE {two-three-four} TWO {two-three-four}, etc.) up to eight --
      the length of the rhythmic introduction of the song --you will then have
      the solution. Almost immediately you'll hear one musician ask &quot;What's
      that?&quot; He means, &quot;What bar is that?&quot; Then, at bar four,
      that same musician calls out &quot;four&quot; -- but he calls it out on
      the third, rather than the first beat of that bar. Another musician then
      confirms the beat, on the FIRST beat of bar five. Following this, you can
      hear them counting out the first beats of bars six, seven and eight in
      unison. This was probably recorded quite early on in the rehearsals, and
      probably at the original &quot;demo&quot; stage of recording. However,
      knowing Kate's perfectionism, and the classic character of this exchange,
      it's just possible that it was actually a staged re-recording of an
      incident similar to many that must have occurred during the original demo
      stages of the recording. </P>

    <P>A new KBC Newsletter was received by IED today, and he forthwith relays
      news of the utmost importance to the world at large. </P>
    
    <P>... </P>
    
    <P>Next in importance is Kate's new clue for the solution to the &quot;backwards&quot;
      track in &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;. The passage has been more
      precisely located in the new Newsletter, and it is significant, perhaps,
      that nowhere is the term &quot;backwards&quot; used. Three new clues have
      been given which should make the solution a simple matter: first, the
      message begins with the word &quot;Don't&quot;; second, the message is
      twelve words in length; and third, the message is &quot;repeated&quot;
      three times (by which IED assumes it is meant that the message is uttered
      three times in all, i.e. &quot;repeated&quot; twice). </P>

    <P>[Watching you without me:] </P>
    
    <P>Although this listener has not yet made any sense of it, he has become
      confident that the message IS backwards, and is to be understood only when
      listened to backwards. As Dawn Uebel pointed out in Break-Through number
      10, we were all completely wrong about the passage which directly follows
      the one in question: the words are not &quot;We receive&quot;, nor &quot;We
      recede&quot;, nor even &quot;Really see&quot;. In fact, when heard
      backwards, the words &quot;We see you here&quot; stand out as clear as a
      bell. Unfortunately, in the longer, preceding message, although Kate does
      seem to be saying something backwards, it still makes no sense to IED. For
      one thing, she seems to be repeating the nonsensical words &quot;he
      knocking us&quot;, among other things, and the word &quot;don't&quot; is
      nowhere audible to this listener. </P>
    
    <P>Doug, where are you when you're needed? </P>

    <P>Other KT News: </P>
    
    <P>According to the latest issue of the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, at least
      one fan has successfully deciphered the first six words of the twelve-word
      message in the &quot;backwards&quot; track from &quot;Watching You Without
      Me&quot;. As he is certain that the perceptive party in question is not
      himself, IED looks to the world Love-Hounds community for further clues.
      Please make some effort to figure out the solution, folks. The passage in
      question starts at 2:19 into the track (using a CD), and lasts about
      thirty seconds. It begins right after the Morse code passage, and is
      identifiable as a message sung in octaves, with tambourine and an
      occasional &quot;Yip!&quot; in the background. The first word of the
      twelve-word message is &quot;Don't&quot;. This is still not nearly enough
      to make the solution easy, so please help out -- let's have an argument
      about something truly important in Love-Hounds, for a change! </P>

      <BR> Subject: Backwards vocals </P>
    
    <P>[Backwards vocals:] </P>
    
    <P>Yes, it has been discussed in L-Hs before, but since no-one has come up
      with the solution to the latest problem yet, an excessively boring and
      long-winded re-capitulation doesn't seem out of order, especially since
      most people just scroll past IED's longer entries anyway! </P>
    
    <P>There have only been two so-called &quot;backwards tracks&quot; in
      Kate's music to date, as far as anyone knows so far. </P>
    
    <P>The first appears in The Dreaming, specifically in the last minute of &quot;Leave
      It Open&quot;. [see there] </P>
    
    <P>Well, once all this had been discovered, some fans suspected that Kate
      had been having a little joke at our expense. So, when the Hounds of Love
      album came out, they really didn't know what to expect. Sure enough, there
      was a new mystery passage in The Ninth Wave, specifically starting at
      about 2:19 into the track called &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>There are actually two parts to this track, and that's part of the
      puzzle. First there is a message which, when played normally on a record
      player, sounds sort of like: &quot;Zwoh-nikh-lawn, zwoh-nikh-lawn-eet; ett
      nee-eed nawng width-aw-nee noy.&quot; This two-bar passage is sung, in
      all, three times. Then there follows a second weird phonetic passage,
      which a lot of fans thought sounded like &quot;We receive, we receive;&quot;
      or &quot;We recede&quot;; or &quot;Really see.&quot; Whereas the first
      passage is sung in octaves, with a distinctive tambourine rhythm track and
      someone (or the Fairlight) going &quot;Yup!&quot; periodically in the
      background, this follow-up passage was sparser, and turned out to be
      easier to solve. Apparently, when played backwards, this second passage
      seems to consist of Kate singing &quot;We see you here, we see you here,&quot;
      or something very similar. And that makes perfect sense in the context of
      the song's story. </P>
    
    <P>It wasn't surprising, therefore to find that this passage was not
      included by the Club Newsletter in the &quot;mystery&quot; passage for the
      new competition. So concentration has been put on the &quot;Zwoh-neekh-lawn...&quot;
      section; and so far, one fan has come up with the first six words. Only
      no-one knows which fan is right (presumably not even the fan knows for
      sure), and no-one knows what those six words are yet. The only clues we've
      been given are: that the message is a sentence of twelve words, sung three
      times; and that the first word of the message is &quot;Don't&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>IED, for one, has gotten absolutely nowhere with it, and is certain that
      he will feel like an even bigger fool when he is told the answer than he
      did when the answer to the &quot;Leave It Open&quot; message was revealed.
      But at least he will be able to console himself with the knowledge that,
      loyal Lionheart that he is, he gave it a good try. </P>

    <P>It's great to hear from someone who's actually listening, for a change!
      About the &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; backwards track: the only
      way I've ever been able to listen to it was by making a tape of the record
      being played backwards by hand on a turntable -- terribly unstable

    <P>Having just acquired an inexpensive quad cassette deck this week, I
      immediately put on my copy of HoL backwards to see if I could discover any
      clue to what IED is trying to figure out in the backwards track on &quot;Watching
      you without Me&quot;. One thing I found is that the backing tracks &quot;You
      can't hear me, etc.&quot; are acually saying &quot;You can't hear me&quot;
      backwards in those sections near the end of the song where you can't
      understand what they say (in the section with the &quot;choppy&quot;
      vocals (&quot;Help me baby...&quot;?)). </P>
    
    <P>Only thing I could figure out about the &quot;mystery&quot; track is the
      first few words sound (to me) like &quot;Don't need no symphony being
      there&quot; (phonetically speaking), and the last 4 words really DO sound
      like &quot;knocking us, knocking us&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Oh well. So much for my first posting here. </P>

    <P>This is extremely fascinating, Erik. Thanks for the input. IED must take
      home your suggestions forthwith and test his ears against them. He is
      frankly amazed and delighted that you hear a &quot;Don't&quot; at all,
      since it has persisted in eluding him ever since it was first mentioned in
      the Newsletter. </P>
    
    <P>Not clear what the other passage you refer to is (presumably not the
      part right after the &quot;mystery&quot; track where the line &quot;We see
      you here&quot; is sung backwards several times.) This, too, will be
      investigated. </P>

    <P>Thanks, Erik. IED had been wondering about that line at the end (it's
      said twice) for the past eighteen months, but (JEEZ WHAT A MORON) he never
      thought of listening to it backwards! The actual line is recorded
      forwards, isn't it? That is, it sounds as though Kate learned the
      backwards phonetics and recorded them normally, because it doesn't have
      that weird suction-like sound to it... </P>
    
    <P>IED just sent off a letter of sulking complaint to the Kate Bush Club,
      telling them to cut this nonsense out and just tell us the fucking answer.
      It's getting to be ridiculous. He went through the last three Newsletters
      with a f.-t. c., looking for clues to the solution (for the &quot;Leave It
      Open&quot; mystery track, the relevant Newsletters were peppered with the
      word &quot;weird&quot;), but could discover nothing at all. One person has
      got the first six (of the twelve) words, and a couple of others have
      figured out &quot;the fourth, fifth and sixth&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>After prolonged listening, IED has had to reject the suggestion: &quot;Don't
      need no symphony to be there&quot;, or any variant thereof. It's possible
      to see where you hear that, but the consonants are completely different,
      and the &quot;to be&quot; isn't there at all. </P>
    
    <P>It could just be more complicated than anyone has guessed so far: there
      is definitely a BACKWARDS rhythm track going on at the same time as the
      regular one. It's very soft, but it's there. Now, why is it there? </P>

    <P>Pardon me assaulting you with the obvious, but I wanted to point out
      that while some backward portions turn out quite predictably, the apparent
      effect of reversing the &quot;chopped&quot; part is totally at odds with
      what you would predict by cataloging the phonemes and then listing them in
      reverse order. I think she has made an incredible discovery here. Well, it
      blows me away, anyway. </P>
    
    <P>Apparently she has a way of putting both fwd and bkwd phonemes into the
      same burst in a way that allows each to be ignored when played the
      opposite of its intended direction. Stunning idea. </P>

    <P>Phil, thank you ad infinitum for your transcription, it was really
      phenomenal, and will be much studied by IED. The above quotation is the
      most amazing part of your totally wonderful posting. Let IED get this
      straight: you're saying that the choppy parts (elsewhere referred to by
      IED as the &quot;scatter-voices&quot;) are somehow synched up with a
      backwards track that SAYS SOMETHING ELSE (namely the new, totally
      unfamiliar lines quoted in your posting)? You don't list any similar
      effect with the choppy parts of &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; -- does this
      mean it only happens with the &quot;Watching You&quot; track? </P>
    
    <P>IED is hyper-excited by this idea of yours, and will go home and test
      your allegations forthwith. Unfortunately, he still has no recourse but to
      turn his record backwards by hand on his turntable, as he owns no proper
      tape recording equipment. </P>

    <P>About the backwards track, which Mark K. mentions, Phil's elaborately
      detailed transcription of it is still being examined and compared against
      the original by IED. So far, as far as IED can make out, it does seem to
      be correct. That is, the &quot;choppy&quot;, or &quot;scatter-voice&quot;
      sections of &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; seem to say something like
      what Phil wrote down when played BACKWARDS. How Kate did this IED has no
      idea, but it is AMAZING. Unfortunately, this gets us no closer towards a
      conclusion re the official mystery section of the track. </P>
    
    <P>IED's Missouri friend argues that whatever the solution to the mystery
      track, its solution almost certainly does not require expensive or
      hard-to-obtain equipment. The last mystery track was ridiculously simple,
      in the end. </P>

    <P>Well, I took another listen at just the choppy parts of Wake, and it is
      a lot more difficult to interpret... and therefore my interpretation is
      more likely to include my own imaginings. </P>
    
    <P>For the earlier choppy stuff, just after 'look who's here to see you', I
      seem to hear </P>
    
    <P>&quot;... &lt;talk (to me) talk (to me) listen (to me) listen (to me)
      (you never) talk to me at all&gt;. I don't want you to leave, &lt;but you
      don't listen to me&gt;.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Closely connected to WYWM. </P>
    
    <P>And a bit later, just after the 2nd 'domini' bit, I seem to hear </P>
    
    <P>&quot;A little bit too hot. I'm &lt;ready/with you&gt; &lt;whenever/where-ever&gt;
      you are. </P>
    
    <P>High and white &lt;???&gt;... &lt;stick-you-up(?)&gt; &lt;like a
      table...?...&gt; </P>
    
    <P>Hardly even stand with it, I mean 's without ti(t) &quot; </P>
    
    <P>I don't make much sense of these words, which could be because I
      miss-heard them, or it could be they weren't meant to make sense. But we
      don't have to accept that. For instance, &quot;I'm with you where-ever you
      are, high and white&quot; would make perfect sense (except I'm not sure
      that's what she said), but I don't see the connection to what I seem to
      hear before and after. Oh well. Reminds me of fever dreams. </P>
    
    <P>By the way, the voice and rhythm of &quot;Hardly even stand with it&quot;
      reminds me a lot of the forward (but unclear) &quot;Listen, he takes me by
      the formagistidden&quot; (or whatever that phrase is). </P>
    
    <P>A dubious guess: 'too hot' and 'ready whenever you are' could be terms
      used often in the recording studio... but that doesn't explain the rest.

    <P>Actually, I'm not an electronics genius, but a mechanical engineer in
      which the word &quot;kludge&quot; is part of my job description. All I
      have done so far is drill a hole in the back cover to give me access to
      the speed control potentiometer. On the walkman I'm using (an old Sanyo
      MG7), this provides control over a fairly broad speed range. When
      listening to the X4 track, I also had the turntable speed set as low as
      possible and provided some light finger drag on the edge of the LP to
      further slow it down. Then I used the speed adjustment on the tape player
      to find the &quot;optimum&quot; listening speed. You can also run your
      turntable by hand at a slower speed (ouch!)... </P>
    
    <P>There are actually 10 syllables present (I mis-counted in my previous
      posting). When slowed down, this becomes very apparent as the echo pattern
      becomes clearer. The &quot;I get from too many instruments&quot; is pretty
      clear. The rest requires a little guesswork. There is no way I can fit in
      your phrase &quot;I bet my mum's gonna give me a little toy&quot; . I
      can't fit 12 syllables into the pattern of echos I hear! But then you
      really have to listen to it yourself. Perhaps I can make a tape for you...

    <P>I've been catching up on the last 2 months of L-H's and saw Phillip's
      article, so I went home and listened to WYWM for about 1 hour last night
      with Philips &quot;backward&quot; interpretations in mind. I used a
      backward cassette recorded on a friend's 4-track. </P>
    
    <P>The &quot;...hear me leaving&quot; part is questionable because that
      would be the &quot;You can't hear me leaving&quot; line backward. It just
      doesn't sound like &quot;hear me leaving&quot; unless you stretch your
      imagine or have been listening to lots of Led Zep backward lately. The &quot;...You
      can't hear me&quot; lines are definitely there! Good work, Erik! They seem
      to have been recorded forward and then played backward during the mix down
      (not the other way around as IED suggested). </P>
    
    <P>As for the &quot;chopped&quot; parts: your transcription of them as they
      sound backward seems absolutely correct to me, Philip (except for the
      second &quot;...listen to me...&quot;). Amazing! As you say, Philip, Kate
      has managed to incorporate a dualism into the lines placing two different,
      yet related, messages in the same place. </P>
    
    <P>Backward version continued: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; {SOS is a palindrome}
      <BR> &gt; you wont hear me
      <BR> &gt; {amoung fwd stuff, maybe &quot;I can not&quot;, but I think I'm
      imagining it} </P>
    
    <P>To me it sounds like: </P>
    
    <P>{SOS}
      <BR> {... but I'm not here ...} (forward)
      <BR> You can't hear me... (backward)
      <BR> {but I'm not here ... I'm not here ...} (forward) </P>
    
    <P>Forward: </P>

    <P>I was suprised at how easy it was to happen upon (admittedly) trivial
      sonic palindromes. I was at Lechmere, Land of Consumer Goods, checking out
      the Casio SK-5, which can reverse a sample. I sampled me saying `Hello,'
      and it sounded like `Hello' even backwards, though it didn't have the same
      character of course. </P>
    
    <P>Perhaps the difficulty in finding such things is overrated, since we
      tend to think of language on paper as a string of discrete symbols.
      However, what what is actually 'out there' in spoken language is very
      plastic and flowing. </P>

      <BR> Date: 12 Jul 88 17:56:03 GMT
      <BR> Subject: Hidden Messsages and the Like </P>
    
    <P>After a few minutes with my trusty four-track and a cassette tape of
      Hounds of Love I have the following (don't trust all of it, as I don't
      100%, but I believe the bulk to be substantially correct): </P>
    
    <P>The &quot;backward&quot; section is longer than one might anticipate.
      First, there is the obvious one, which has all of the funny vowel and
      consonant closures one associates with pronouncing such things backwards (&quot;So
      ni kloi, so ni kloi-ii...&quot;). After that is an obligotto which is
      repeated three times and sounds much like &quot;Release Me&quot;). </P>
    
    <P>Working backwards, the second (&quot;Release Me&quot;) is pretty
      clearly: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;We see you here&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Going back to &quot;So ni kloi, so ni kloi-ii...&quot; - it is composed
      of three phrases which are similar, if not identical. Playing backwards,
      the first (the last you hear when you play the album normally) is: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Falling asleep on me in bed - [we're] neither working nor smoking&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Now, one might say that this has little relevance to Watching You
      Without Me, though all sorts of tangents are possible. However, having
      been in similar situations, I have found that after putting in enough
      26-hour days on this sort of a project in a row makes the fatigue toxins
      flow and suddenly your mind takes on a whole new creative bent [sic]. It
      certainly says something about the way one feels after spending the
      umpteenth hour overdubbing a single phrase or hunched over the mixing
      console. (One will recall &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot; -- which is
      really much more a blatant statement of how the end of the song came about
      than directly connected with the rest of Leave it Open (though it is
      possible to interpret it as well that when you &quot;leave it open&quot;
      you &quot;let the weirdness in&quot;). </P>
    
    <P>Alternate ideas welcome -- I'm curious as anyone else (well, maybe not
      quite as curious as some...). </P>

    <P>I don't think the message at the end of WYWM is backwards at all. Joe
      Turner and MarK T. Ganzer and IED had basically convinced me that it was
      FORWARDS, but produced by kate listening to her forwards message played
      backwards and then singing it that way so that when the tape was reversed
      yet again the message she was singing was coming out in the right
      direction, but the vagaries of singing it backwards had added an unearthly
      timbre to it all. Try it yourself with your trusty four track! </P>
    
    <P>Sing &quot;and they said they were buried here...&quot; or whatever you
      think it sounds like and flip the tape - you'll find that you're suddenly
      singing &quot;we let the weirdness in&quot; only because you couldn't
      perfectly replicate the waveforms with your voice, you've got a very weird
      sounding &quot;we let the weirdness in&quot;. I have done this, and it's a
      bitch! Only thing is, I can't quite recall what the consensus was on what
      Kate was supposedly saying. I'll go check out the track again and see what
      I can come up with. Anyone want to take a stab at this? </P>

      <BR> Subject: re: Hidden Messsages and the Like </P>
    
    <P>IED read your ideas with great interest and care, Larry, and he
      certainly agrees with you about the line &quot;We see you here&quot;.
      That's a definite. Heard forwards it's been identified variously as &quot;Really
      see,&quot; &quot;We recede&quot;, etc., but all that becomes irrelevant
      when it's heard backwards and its true meaning pops right out. </P>
    
    <P>The real mystery is the passage directly preceding &quot;We see you here&quot;,
      however, and in regard to that section IED cannot share your confidence in
      a solution. First of all, it must be said right away that your suggestion
      that the phrase goes something like &quot;Falling asleep on me in
      bed--(we're) neither working nor smoking&quot; is incorrect. </P>
    
    <P>Kate has already given several clues to KBC members regarding this &quot;mystery&quot;
      section of &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;. First of all, the message
      is a sentence. Second, it's twelve words long. Third and perhaps most
      important, perhaps, the first word of the message is &quot;Don't&quot;. So
      your theory simply can't be correct, although perhaps part of it is
      accurate. After spending far more time than is good for his health fussing
      over this passage, IED has come up with no firm theories. With the help of
      Love-Hound MarK T. Ganzer he considered the possibility that the words
      might begin with the words: </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Don't ignore, don't ignore me. Let me in...&quot;
      <BR> (&quot;So ni-kloi, so ni-kloi-ee...Et nee nong...&quot;) </P>
    
    <P>As you can see, that solution is based on the very dicey theory that the
      message is actually not a backwards-masked message at all, but is rather
      intended only to sound &quot;backwards&quot; while actually containing a
      forwards message that has been heavily &quot;treated&quot;. But MarK and
      IED can't be said to have any great confidence in this idea -- it remains
      only a pretty theory. </P>
    
    <P>After four issues (over nearly a 3-year period), IED was thoroughly
      disheartened to find that even in the latest issue (no. 22, which arrived
      only after a more-than-ten-month delay), no solution of this puzzle had
      yet been submitted, and no new clues were being offered. With luck someone
      will have come close enough to the real answer by the time the next issue
      is due for Kate to put her fans out of their misery and just plain TELL US
      THE ANSWER. But IED has no real hope... </P>

    <P> Since then, the new &quot;mystery message&quot; competition, involving
      the peculiar bit of music in the middle of Watching You Withou Me, had
      still not been solved by anyone as of the last issue (which came out in
      late 1987). The only clues for that one were: it's a sentence of twelve
      words, beginning with &quot;Don't&quot;, and repeated twice (i.e., heard
      three times in a row). It comes on at 2:19 (if IED recalls correctly),
      directly after the Morse code &quot;SOS&quot; signals are heard. </P>
    
    <P>Now, is this one backwards or forwards? Most of the suggestions for the
      solution in the Newsletter have been versions of the message as it is
      heard when played forwards: (Something like &quot;Zwoh-neekh-lawn,
      zwoh-neekh-lawneet. Ett need...&quot; etc.) Anyone have any ideas? </P>

    <P> About &quot;secret messages&quot; in Watching You Without Me, Mark: IED
      doesn't doubt that you've been listening carefully to the recording: the
      fact that you noticed the very low-level conversation at the very
      beginning of the track proves this. But there are still a few more that
      you apparently haven't caught yet. The most famous one is even the subject
      of a now-very-old Kate Bush Club competition (begun in 1986, and still not
      officially solved by anyone). But there are several other secret messages
      in the recording, as well. Perhaps the best way to show readers where
      these are is to re-post IED's &quot;complete&quot; version of the lyrics.
      Try listening to the song while reading this version. And please be
      under-standing about the still-unsolved gaps--perhaps you have
      suggestions? </P>
    
    <P>-- Andrew Marvick (IED) </P>
    
    <P>Watching You Without Me </P>
    
    <P>Notes on the above lyrics </P>
    
    <P>++--&quot;It's four ...five...six...seven...&quot;: Evidently an
      exchange between two of the instrumental musicians on the track. The first
      speaker (&quot;What's that?) is asking for the beat count, and the second
      is tapping it out for him. This may be authentic studio chat, or an artful
      reconstruction. </P>
    
    <P> [*--&quot;Don't ignore, don't ignore me...&quot;: This &quot;mystery
      message&quot; immediately follows the Morse code &quot;S.O.S.&quot;
      signal. Still undeciphered as of October, 1988, the message is the subject
      of a continuing Kate Bush Club competition. The message is a sentence,
      twelve words long, beginning with the word &quot;Don't&quot;. Backwards,
      it sounds something like: &quot;Zwoh-nikh-noh, zwoh-nikh-noh nee, et-nee
      nong-widz-aw nee noy.&quot; The translation in the lyrics above is only
      the editor's guess. It is not even known for certain whether the message
      is forward- or backward-directional.] </P>
    
    <P> [**--&quot;Listen to me, baby...&quot;, etc.: The words in this
      passage, and in one which follows later in the song are broken
      up--fractured--by some sound-treatment process known only to Kate. Similar
      to passages from Waking the Witch, these lines seem to contain different
      words when played backwards. Respectively, these are: &quot;I was here
      before, you talked to me, you said that you didn't think it was too late
      to help me...&quot;; and &quot;Talk to me, listen to me, talk to me, talk
      to me, baby...&quot; These words apparently were recorded within the
      momentary gaps which break up the forward-directional recording, and like
      a number of other important lines in the song (though possibly not the &quot;competition&quot;
      section), they can only be understood when the recording is played
      backwards. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Secret Message solution </P>
    
    <P>IED apologizes for having forgotten to put everyone out of their misery.
      He supposes that he figured after four years, what's another day or
      two...or three...or four. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, you'll be amazed at how anticlimactic the solution turns out to
      be. On the other hand, IED guesses that's exactly what Kate wanted it to
      be. The official solution is: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Don't ignore, don't ignore me. Let me in, and don't be long.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>This is especially amazing because when you listen to it now you'll
      discover that there is a definite, unignorable extra syllable that Kate
      pronouces before the third &quot;don't&quot;, which is not explained at
      all by the solution. (Other similar odd sybilant sounds, etc., abound.)
    </P>
    
    <P>IED's theory therefore is that indeed there may be a separate back-wards
      track, which it should be possible (now that the official forwards track
      is known) to isolate from the forwards track. Do the Love-Hounds have any
      theories? </P>
    
    <P>And what of the (to IED far more provocative) secret message in
      Experiment IV? Has no-one developed any theories about it? </P>

    <P>From The Kate Bush Club Newsletter: </P>
    
    <P>We have decided to put you out of your misery regarding the &quot;Watching
      You Without Me&quot; competition. Many attempts were getting further and
      further away from the answer; things like &quot;Don't need much, don't
      need money, believe life goes on and on&quot; and &quot;Don't seek far
      don't seek for me, let me learn widowly love.&quot; Others made us think
      some of you were on another planet; &quot;Don't somnie morn somnie
      mornings then mean life goes on and on&quot; and &quot;Don't run on those
      Blarney mats, in own keen-ness slumps keen-ness.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>There were quite a few who thought the word dawn was in there somewhere &quot;Don't
      be sad don't be lonely, let me see the coming dawn&quot; and &quot;Don't
      need more dawn each morning, help me that was long enough.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>In the last few months we've received many suggestions which have the
      first 8 words right:--&quot;Don't ignore don't ignore me let me in&quot;...
      But nobody got the last 4 words right--the suggestions included ,&quot;I'm
      the dawning of&quot;/&quot;on the dawning hour&quot;/&quot;at the dawning
      hour&quot;/&quot;I must only knock&quot;/&quot;I was holding on.&quot; But
      the correct answer is ... </P>

    <P>&gt; DON'T IGNORE ME, LET ME IN AND DON'T BE LONG. </P>
    
    <P>OK, I'm eating my words, and boy am I glad that I flavor them with this
      special marinara sauce I whipped up. However, this answer is totally
      unsatisfactory! Where the KBC claims the last phrase is &quot;and don't be
      long&quot; the music seems to have an extra syllable that just can't be
      accounted for with this ridiculous phrase! In Joe's theory, the wording
      was &quot;I'm alone here now&quot; - the problem is that &quot;alone&quot;
      has the nice unstressed/stressed pattern that the music has, and &quot;and
      don't&quot; doesn't have enough syllables to cover. </P>
    
    <P>The only way I could account for this is if Kate is stuttering and
      saying something like &quot;And d-don't be long.&quot; Besides, Kate has
      been lying her face off lately, maybe this is just another example. </P>
    
    <P>Well, now I don't need to go get breakfast anyway. :) </P>

      <BR> Subject: seKreT message clarifiKation </P>
    
    <P>One Wisner asks: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; er, what was it?, he asked stupidly.. </P>
    
    <P>Not stupid at all. There were several. Several times in WYWM Kate
      mutters a few words in a low spoken voice which, when played backwards on
      your turntable, turn out to be an actual sentence. Also, there is a Morse
      code &quot;SOS&quot; message. Also, there is a section which sounds like &quot;Really
      see&quot; repeated over in a high sung melody, which is actually another
      backwards message: when played backwards that phrase becomes clearly
      audible as &quot;We see you here.&quot; Also, some high-frequency radio
      signals are audible at different points, and these may actually be
      decipherable, though IED has no idea how such a thing might be done. </P>
    
    <P>But the &quot;official&quot; secret message in WYWM is the section where
      you hear Kate singing a melody with &quot;words&quot; that sound a bit
      like&quot; &quot;Zwoh-nikh-lawn, zwoh-nikh-law-nee. E-e-t-nee-awng,
      nawn-width-aw-nee-naw...&quot; repeated several times. This section proved
      to be a very tough nut to crack: it took four issues of the Newsletter
      before Kate took pity on the fans (none of whom was able to guess all
      twelve words of the two-sentence message that, we were told, began with
      the word &quot;Don't&quot;) and allowed the correct answer to be
      published. It was: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Don't ignore, don't ignore me. Let me in and don't be long.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Exactly what sort of weirdness Kate perpetrated to create the message's
      unique sound has never been explained by her or anyone else, but there is
      more or less unanimity among fans now that whatever the method was, the
      solution was decidedly anti-climactic. </P>
    
    <P>See, this is the sort of thing that passes for humour among the Bush
      family-members. For five years they no doubt had regular chuckles over the
      image of Kate's myriad minions poring hour after hour over their
      turntables seeking the answer to a puzzle the solution to which had
      essentially no point... </P>

    <P>And more on the backwards stuff: </P>
    
    <P>After IED posted his full lyrics to &quot;Watching You Without Me,&quot;
      I pulled out the handy-dandy digitizer and tried listening to some of the
      stuff. </P>
    
    <P>I have a lot of trouble making out the backward &quot;You don't hear me.&quot;s
      that appear mid/end verse. They're obviously there and that's what she's
      saying, but it's not as clear as a lot of other backwards-masked stuff
      (largely 'cause it seems to be meant largely as part of the instrumental
      score as opposed to a very blatant secret message that is out in the open
      for anyone to grab (such as Floyd's message on &quot;The Wall&quot;, which
      is only on one track, with no music, so it's easy to manipulate). </P>
    
    <P>What was really fantastic was the repeated &quot;We see you here.&quot;
      that follows the &quot;Don't ignore me...&quot; part. Before IED posted
      his lyrics, I would have sworn that Kate was singing this part forward--I
      wasn't sure about the lyrics (I figgered they were something like &quot;We
      really see.&quot;), but I had no idea this was backwards-masked. When you
      turn it around, you hear some amazing singing. Simply too cool--something
      that sounds 'real' both forward and backward (I never really agreed with
      the stuff about &quot;We let the weirdness in&quot;--sound gibberish to me
      backward.) </P>
    
    <P>I also played around a bit with the chopped-up parts on WYWM. </P>
    
    <P>The first time I digitized the first part, I happened to only do one
      track (I think it was the right track, but I'm not positive). I reversed
      it, then listened for IED's purported backward message--&quot;I was here
      before, you talked to me, you said that you didn't think it was too late
      to help me...&quot;. What I heard, though, was the forward message (&quot;Help
      me baby, help me baby, talk to me...&quot;), though it was a bit choppier.
      It sounded like KaTe had simply &quot;chopped&quot; up the original tape
      and inserted every-other bit backward--where the backwards bits were a
      little shorter than the forward. When I tried digitizing it with both
      tracks, I heard IED's message--and his transcription seems pretty close. I
      haven't yet had the chance to try this part with just the left track;
      perhaps this will shed some light on the matter. </P>

    <P>This verse, the erstwhile &quot;mystery message&quot;, immediately
      follows the Morse code &quot;S.O.S.&quot; signal. The message was long the
      subject of a Kate Bush Club competition. It sounds more like &quot;Zwoh-nikh-noh,
      zwoh-nikh-noh nee, et-nee nong-widz-aw nee noy&quot; than the actual words
      Kate Bush is singing. This is because the phrase was originally spoken,
      then recorded and played backwards; Kate listened to the sound of the
      reversed phonetics and learned to sing them with an inverse of the melody
      she intended for that section; and this in turn was recorded and fed into
      the final recording in backwards form, creating the correct forward words
      with the original, intended melody, but sounding &quot;backwards&quot; and
      very odd. </P>
    
    <P> It should be noted that there *are* several actual backwards lines on
      this recording (see **). </P>
    
    <P>** -- &quot;We see you here.&quot; This is sung and heard backwards.
      There may be more going on here than just this line, however; several
      supplemental readings have been posited over the years. </P>
    
    <P>*** --&quot;Listen to me, baby...&quot;, etc.: The words in this
      passage, and in one which follows later in the song, are fractured by some
      sound-treatment process known only to Kate. Similar to passages from &quot;Waking
      the Witch&quot;, these lines seem to contain *different* words when played
      backwards. Respectively, these are: &quot;I was here before, you talked to
      me, you said that you didn't think it was too late to help me...&quot;;
      and &quot;Talk to me, listen to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby...&quot;
      These latter words apparently were recorded within the momentary gaps
      which break up the forward-directional recording.] </P>

      while recording it to an open track. There is some other processing going
      on here as well which I can't identify - sounds like reverb and some
      midrange boost, but it could be more than that. There are electronic
      methods of achieving this effect but I don't think they would be &quot;fractured&quot;

    <P>I'd just like to point out that the two versions you hear in the song,
      sound as if they could be cut and &quot;magically&quot; put back together,
      they would each be the gaps of the other. Listen the the T in talk in each
      version, or the L in listen. </P>
    
    <P>One way to achieve this is to have two tracks recording, and quickly

    <P>Here it is as a picture: </P>

    <P> \ </P>
    
    <P> \------Recording 2 (on blank) </P>
    
    <P>Listening back to each recorded track individually will give this
      effect, I believe both tracks were used (sequentially) with the rest of
      the instruments. Sounds excellent, I wonder who had the idea to do this?

    <P>In reference to the &quot;backwards&quot; (actually double-backwards,
      thus forwards-again) passage in &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;, John
      Walker (who is too kind!) remarks: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; This had been bothering me as well. I assumed it was another
      language. I would be interested in knowing how this was discovered. </P>
    
    <P>After several issues (and some two years) without a complete solution to
      the content of the message (&quot;Don't ignore, don't ignore me/Let me in
      and don't be long&quot;), the Kate Bush Club at long last put its members
      out of their misery and published the longed-for information. </P>
    
    <P>In re the later, &quot;broken-up&quot; sections of the same song (which
      sound much like the broken-up bits from &quot;Waking the Witch&quot;), IED
      wrote: </P>

    <P>IED too is convinced that there is more to this passage than you
      describe, mainly because when you listen to this section backwards, the
      broken-up bits sound much the same as forwards --except that the words are
      not the same! (Both forwards and backwards messages were included in the
      lyrics as posted the other day by IED.) This remarkable fact led IED to
      suppose that Kate actually synchronized the chopped-up slivers of silence
      in the forward-directional track with the chopped-up slivers of *vocals*
      in a second, similar-but-not-identical *backward*-directional track. It
      was this process to which IED was referring as a &quot;sound-treatment
      known only to Kate&quot;. Certainly it is the only such instance of which
      IED is aware. </P>
    
    <P>Thanks for your interest in this endlessly fascinating subject. The
      depths of &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot; have not yet been plumbed!

    <P>&gt; *** --&quot;Listen to me, baby...&quot;, etc.: The words in this
      passage, and in one which follows later in the song, are fractured by some
      sound-treatment process known only to Kate. Similar to passages from &quot;Waking
      the Witch&quot;, these lines seem to contain *different* words when played
      backwards. Respectively, these are: &quot;I was here before, you talked to
      me, you said that you didn't think it was too late to help me...&quot;;
      and &quot;Talk to me, listen to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby...&quot;
      These latter words apparently were recorded within the momentary gaps
      which break up the forward-directional recording.] </P>
    
    <P>Having listened to the 'chopped' passage backwards I can find no words
      inserted in the gaps backwards. Come to think of it, had there been
      something in the gaps they would not have been gaps! </P>
    
    <P>I read in an article (either in a KBC mag or some interview) that Del
      said the gaps in the sound for the chopping effect were created by spot
      erasing. Spot erasure is where the erase head on the tape machine is
      engaged with the tape in edit mode such that the tape transport does not
      function and the tape can be moved past the heads by hand. It is normally
      used for erasing small faults such as pops and gliches that are too small
      to be erased in real time. </P>
    
    <P>The chopped effect is made more effective by alternating between the
      left and right channels. </P>
    
    <P>This process must have taken a considerable number of hours to execute
      but gives rise to the controlled loss of words such that they are
      inteligable. The use of an audio gate triggered from an oscillator or
      simply flicking the mute switches on the desk would have given
      unpredictable results, given that at the time of mixing Kate only had a
      manual Soundcraft desk. </P>
    
    <P>The subsequent major refit of her studio would have made the effect much
      easier to program on the SSL desk (a G series with Total Recall, I think).
      The mutes could be programmed into the desk and referenced to time code
      from tape to produce the same effect without erasing the recording. </P>
