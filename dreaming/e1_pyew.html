    <P>Kate has a cat named &quot;Pyewackett&quot;. Now a while ago, Bill
      Rosenblatt posted some info on a British folk-rock group with the same
      name. I asked him if he had any idea where the name came from, and he has
      done some research on the matter. It turns out that &quot;Pyewackett&quot;
      means &quot;a witch's familiar&quot;. </P>

    <P>She might have got the idea from the movie BELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE
      (1958), in which Kim Novak plays a witch in New York City who has a cat
      named Pyewackett. (Not a bad movie, stars Novak, James Stewart, Jack
      Lemmon, and Ernie Kovacs.) </P>

      <BR> Subject: Pyewacket </P>
    
    <P>Concerning Pyewacket (one of several spellings --even the KBC has
      spelled it more than one way): </P>
    
    <P>Kate has two cats, as everyone knows, but because of the history behind
      Pye's name, he (?) gets all the attention. (Kate herself always gives them
      equal time in her comic strip.) </P>
    
    <P>The name may indeed mean &quot;witch's familiar&quot; in some early form
      of English. IED believes that Kate probably heard the name in the movie &quot;Bell,
      Book and Candle&quot;, which starred James Stewart and Kim Novak (as the
      witch). In that movie, Novak had a Siamese cat named Pyewacket who acted
      as her familiar, and around whom much of the plot revolved. Pye's role is
      probably the largest ever given to a cat in a play; IED has read newspaper
      reports describing auditions for the role of Pye in at least two different
      regional productions. So KT's Kit-T has notorious namesakes working on the
      boards. </P>
    
    <P>Now, if someone could just track down the origins of the name &quot;ZOODLE&quot;....
    </P>
    
    <P>Incidentally, according to one of Kate's earliest NME (or MM) &quot;interviews&quot;,
      the Bush family used to have a dog named Piggy, as well. Perhaps this is
      the name of the hound who appears in the famous backyard family portrait
      that appears in Vermorel's or Kerton's book. Anyone know? </P>
