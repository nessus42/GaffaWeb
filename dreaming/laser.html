</P>
<P>Hi, folks. 
</P>
<P>IED is in heaven. He just got the new Japanese laser-disk of The Hair of the
 Hound. It's unbelievable. Even though it's only 20 minutes long, it's a
twelve-inch  disk! Usually short programs are put on eight-inch disks and sold
for a lower price.  But being Japanese, the manufacturers of this disk decided
to go for quality in every  respect, and screw the cost (exactly the opposite of
the American policy). The extra  space was used to allow for digital sound (same
sampling rate and Hz. as a CD), as  well as for CAV format commands (for the
video). The latter term means it has  forward and reverse motion at any speed,
plus freeze-frame, a display of which  frame (of the 38,000+ frames) you're on,
etc. And laser slo-mo and freeze-frame are  totally noise-free and rock-steady.
But best of all, the picture is stunning! The  resolution is so high that it's
like seeing the videos for the first time. All kinds of  details come out were
not visible on cable or broadcast television. 
</P>
<P>For example, in Cloudbusting, at the point where the Feds are ransacking
Reich's  lab and rifling through his papers, and you see a one-second flash of a
newspaper  headline about Reich's arrest (The Oregon Times), it is now possible
to read not  only the headlines, but part of the fine-print of the article about
Reich and his son --  all written out in authentic journalese. Plus you can
inspect all the weird specimens  of fish on the lab walls, and take the time to
appreciate Kate's unbelievable attention  to detail: there's a photo-portrait of
the President on the wall, and as it's 1955 (the  year of Reich's arrest) -- NOT
1952, the date of the newspaper, which is found in  Reich's file-cabinet because
it has a story about him and his son and was evidently  preserved by Reich
--Eisenhower -- Big Brother literally looking down on the  doomed protagonists.
(Also interesting is that the photo on the front page of the  newspaper itself
is a snapshot of the REAL Wilhelm Reich.) 
</P>
<P>And in The Big Sky, it's now possible to identify many familiar faces in the
 meteorological crowd, including Dave Cross, Krystina Fitzgerald and Peter
Morris.  And there are some amazing technical touches in the video that only
become clear  in ultra-slo-mo. 
</P>
<P>That's all for now.

Subject: Video Magazine review of TWS vdisc 
</P>
<P>Hi Everyone, 
</P>
<P>I received the latest issue of Video yesterday, and found this review of the
TWS  release. Page 60: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: <BR> The Whole Story <BR> 1985 comp. Digital stereo. 58 min.
CLV 2 sides. $24.95. Pioneer Artists. 
</P>
<P>It's taken five years for this 13-song anthology to make it into Pioneer's
U.S.  catalog. (The Japanese release has long been a choice import, even at
$100.) But the  wait is just about worth it. The images are wonderful-Bush's mix
of sensuality and  surrealism is shown to great advantage, whether she's engaged
in the exquisitely  erotic dancing of &quot;Running up That Hill&quot; or acting
out the moody psychodrama of  &quot;Breathing.&quot; And the color and sharpness
are just about everything one could hope. 
</P>
<P>The only problem is with the sound-the digital tracks are reasonably bright
and  sharp, but fall well short of the vibrancy of EMI Record's British CD of
this same  material. According to Pioneer, the music was mastered from the
video's analog  music tracks, which would put it at least two or three
generations away from an  original studio master. A mild boost in volume-coupled
with a few adjustments on an  equalizer-can make up for this problem, but those
with analog-only players should  be warned that the analog music tracks are so
soft, they're almost unusable. 
</P>
<P>In any case, the disc is a dazzling showcase for Bush and her videos, which
do  comprise an important part of her work. Since she's only undertaken a single
tour  in her entire career, she puts more of herself into these video
appearances than  most of her peers. 
</P>

</P>
<P> Alec, your list is excellent, but not yet completely complete. IED knows
that a  second edition of the Live at Hammersmith Odeon LD was released in Japan
(in  NTSC), and that the rerelease featured (with the notice prominent in the
corner of  the front-cover artwork) &quot;digital sound&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Also, TLTCTC did indeed come out in laser-disk form in the U.S., and judging
 from its quality, was probably transferred from a print, not a PAL copy.

</P>
<P>Thanks to uli@zoodle.robin.de, and BCBliz@aol.com, an expanded and improved 
LaserDisc list..... 
</P>
<P>Live at Hammersmith Odeon: 
</P>
<P>UK: Was released in the early 80s as a LaserVision analogue sound disc.    
The  picture is colourful but not particularly detailed, probably     due to the
original  recording not being too wonderful. The sound     is also reasonable,
but not up to the  standard of the CD release.     The recording has been spread
over both sides of the  disc,     although it would've fitted on one. The cover
is superb, making     full use of  the LP size sleeve by re-formatting and
expanding the     various photos. This disc  has been deleted for some years and
is     thus now quite rare.    	    
</P>
<P>    Cat no info: EMI Music Video, distributed on LV by CBS-FOX Video. <BR> 
                Made in UK - cat no 6135-70

<P>US: No 
</P>
<P>Japan: Has been released, but is now deleted and rare. <BR>        Cat no:
SM035-3419 
</P>
<P>The Single File: 
</P>
<P>UK: Released in the mid 80s as a LaserVision analogue sound disc. A     very
 sharp and clear picture and similarly excellent sound. The     cover is very
nice, with  the 'blue leaf' effect spread all over.     This is the rarest UK
Kate disc, probably  only one batch     (500?) was ever produced. 
</P>
<P>    Cat no info: Picture Music, PMI 90 1430 1. Made in UK

<P>Japan: Released as a CAV disc, and possibly still available. <BR>       
Cat no: SM048-3111 
</P>
<P>The Whole Story: 
</P>
<P>UK: 1st edition: Released in the late 80s as a LaserVision analogue    
sound disc. A  sharp picture, but the sound quality was dreadful     - a
continuous hissing from the  right hand channel. The cover is     also poor,
with the VHS-shaped cover slapped at  a jaunty angle     in the middle of the LP
size sleeve. Now deleted. 
</P>
<P>    Cat no info: Pic Music Intl dist by Lightning Dist. <BR>

</P>
<P>    2nd edition: Released a couple of years after the above as one     of
the first UK  digital sound LD's (then called CD video), as you     would expect
the sound is a  great improvement on the above. The     cover is also improved,
although the front  cover is still VHS-    shaped, the back has no less than
five little colour photos!      The disc itself is a snazzy gold colour, and the
Wuthering     Heights video has the  new vocal. Now deleted.

or L100-1076 (2 diff releases??) 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World: 
</P>
<P>UK: Not released on disc. 
</P>
<P>US: A 20 minute version, released as a 20cm LD. Picture is reasonable,    
given  that it's converted from PAL. The cover is nice, although     it would be
better  without having &quot;THE MUSIC DISC&quot; written all      over it. Now
deleted. 
</P>

<P>Japan: The full 36 minute version, issued as a 30cm disc. <BR>        Cat
no: TOLW 3189 
</P>
<P>The Whole Story 1993: 
</P>
<P>UK: Released in 1993 (stating the obvious?), the picture is excellent    
throughout.  The cover is also very nice, breaking away     from the VHS-look of
its two  predecessors. Unfortunately the sound     is VERY hissy, particularly
in the right  hand channel, which leads     me to believe that it was produced
from the same  master copy as     the original analogue TWS release, and not the
(much improved)      remastered CD Video version. The sound for the three TSW
videos is     excellent  however. Wuthering Heights has the original vocals.    
Still available. 
</P>
<P>    Cat no info: Pic Music Intl, dist by Pioneer LDCE; PLMPB 00871 <BR>

<P>UK: Recently released, superb sound, picture, and cover make it well worth
owning. <BR>     Cat no info: Pic Music Intl, dist by Pioneer LDCE; PLMPA 00901

</P>
<P>         Made in the USA. 
</P>
<P>US: Apparently available, although I have still to see it listed    
anywhere. It  would be interesting to know whether it's a     conversion from
PAL or whether it  has been produced from the     original film. Anyone know the
cat no? 
</P>
<P>Japan: Unknown 
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P>So that's the latest version. No fewer than 14 discs! My collection is only
half  complete.... 
</P>
<P>You may notice a slight difference between the review of TWS:1993 in this 
posting and the one in my previous posting. I have to hang my head in shame and 
admit that when I first posted this list I hadn't watched TWS:1993 properly,
just  looked at a few snippets, and had just assumed that the sound quality
would at least  be on a par with the previous version. How wrong I was..... 
</P>
<P>Interestingly, the hiss runs all the way through side one, but at the start
of side  two it is less noticable (although it seems to have been reduced using
filtering, rather  than obtaining a new master). I would guess that the LD
engineers realised that the  sound was poor while cutting the master disc for
side one, tried to improve things on  side two, but could not justify the
expense of re-cutting side one.

<BR> Subject: kate's LaserDiscs 
</P>
<P>These days I'm getting to be busier and cannot spend enough time to read
news  articles. But some recent messages about Laser Disk releases drove me to
do  summarization on video releases in Japan. 
</P>
<P>Here's a list of Kate's videos released in Japan. The source of the
information is  a CD-ROM based data retrieval system available at a local CD
shop. Entries without  issue date are from other resources such as `the
Illustrated Collector's Guide.' 
</P>
<P>Compared with alec's post, there are slight differences. 
</P>
<P>One thing I can point out is that `The hair of the Hound' is out of print. 
</P>
<P>Different releases surely exist.  These are usually to drop prices. For
example,  Live at Hammersmith Odeon was first priced 16,000 yen and later
reissued 4635 yen. 
</P>
<P>Also, some other discs with Kate's name are included in this list. You can
see  there's Wuthering Heights Rockflix version on LD ! Some disc such as Peter 
Gabriel's Cv are missing, the searching strategy was simply to &quot;Find all
videos with  Kate Bush as Artist Name.&quot;

</P>
<P>I have a copy of this, and the sound is fine. Definitely no hiss audible at
all, apart  from the sound of the master tapes of a few of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>I have listened to the internal DACs of my player and and external DAC box,
all  through my Quad Electrostatic speakers. Never any hiss. 
</P>
<P>I have had a problem with this disc though, I am on my third copy and this,
like  the previous ones is slightly warped ( I have watched it spinning around
with the lid  off my LD player ). The end of side 1 suffers from serious
crosstalk and breaking up  of the sound ( but not hiss ). Side 2 is perfect all
the way through. 
</P>
<P>I have the service manual and am intending to make sure the tracking of my 
laserdisc player is perfect before returning the disc again. However, I suppose
it is  possible that the hiss which you hear is the result of the same problem
on your own  disc producing different symptoms from those which it does on mine.

</P>
<P>The other problem I have is that I am beginning to get sick of hearing
Wuthering  Heights. I thought this could never happen, but my 18 month old
daughter has  decided she likes copying Kate dancing. She says &quot;Keh Boosh&quot;
over and over, pointing  at the laserdisc player or disc. When Wuthering Heights
is playing she does a  remarkably credibly job of copying Kate. 
</P>
<P>Thanks for the details of the other discs, I did not know about the
LaserVision  discs.

it's in CAV  (Constant Angular Velocity) instead of CLV (Constant Linear
