      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
      <BR> Subject: Another new KT book </P>
    
    <P> IED reports the arrival of still another new book about Kate Bush. This
      one, a British hardcover biography by Kerry Juby, is unquestionably the
      best biography to be published so far. IED is still in the midst of
      reading it (it's about 160 pages), but already it easily outstrips in
      accuracy and insight its predecessors, the two &quot;biographies&quot; by
      Fred Vermorel and the one book by Paul Kerton. </P>
    
    <P>Juby's new book is called &quot;Kate Bush: The Whole Story&quot;, and
      cost IED $30.00. It looks like a mainstream hardcover biography, rather
      than a pop music fanbook. Juby is described on the fly-leaf as an
      independent radio producer specializing in interviews. The slipcase is
      white with black lettering, and a b&amp;w shot of Kate on the front and
      back. </P>
    
    <P>The text is as literate as can be expected, which is to say it's a major
      improvement over earlier books. Considerable care is evident in the
      discography at the back of the book, and the large majority of the facts
      in the biography itself--especially after the author gets past Kate's
      youth, which is still sketched in from hearsay by former
      school-chums--appear to IED on first check to be accurate. </P>
    
    <P>The book begins with a preface designed to repudiate the smarmy,
      exploitative and hostile messages inherent in the Vermorel books. The word
      &quot;normal&quot; is used to describe Kate's character and childhood no
      fewer than five times in the first five pages of the book. Excessive (not
      to say unconvincing), perhaps, but understandable given the kind of
      character damage that the earlier books and articles have done to Kate
      over the years--that's a hard stereotype to knock down, and one way to do
      it is to set up an alternative stereotype.</P>
    
    <P>In the acknowledgements Juby lists the KBC, Kate Bush, &quot;Homeground&quot;
      and--most importantly, as it turns out--a number of people who have worked
      with Kate in the past, including Anthony Van Laast, Jon Kelly, Andrew
      Powell (who unwittingly exposes his own artistic weaknesses in his
      explanation of his problems with Kate during the recording of &quot;Lionheart&quot;)
      and Lindsay Kemp. </P>
    
    <P>In addition to all these people's recollections, Juby managed to acquire
      the confidence of Frances Byrne, a school friend of Kate's who shared a
      personal letter she received from KT shortly before &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;
      was recorded. This letter is a fascinating study, even though reading it
      makes IED feel a little like he's rummaging through Kate's garbage cans.
      She comes off as so bright, modest, considerate and creatively literate,
      that IED couldn't resist re-printing it here. Remember, this is Kate Bush,
      age 16/17, writing: </P>
    
    <P>Dear Fran, </P>
    
    <P>Thanks for your letter -- it was really, really nice to hear from you,
      but not a total surprise -- it was strange because you appeared for a
      split second in my dream last night and your letter was at my parents'
      this morning. It's good to hear you're so well and coping with your life
      -- Well Done -- it gets really hard sometimes, dun it? </P>
    
    <P>I gather you hear I've left school? Well, I left during last year's
      summer holidays -- before they all went back for the Autumn Term. I've
      only been back once since, and that was an extremely brief visit, but
      that's how it goes...! I now go to an open dance college in London. It's
      called the Dance Centre, and it's OK. It is expensive and my life is, at
      the moment, revolving around the money that's left over from the lessons,
      but that's enough for me to have fun and buy cigarettes. (I am afraid to
      say that I'm smoking quite a lot but I think I've got it under control?)
    </P>
    
    <P>I haven't heard from you for so long that it's difficult to know where
      to start. I guess you know that I have set myself a definite ambition as a
      career. I want to sing, write songs and mime. I've got a contract actually
      being drawn up by a record company at last, but it has taken 4 years
      (approximately) to get this far -- but I think it is going to get more
      progressive -- I hope so. I'm working quite hard on my voice and on songs
      (and dancing too I suppose) but I seem to spend most of my time waiting
      for it all to happen. Last summer I took mime lessons with Lindsay Kemp.
      He is an amazing person and I met a lot of nice friends through the
      classes. The more people I meet now, the older and stranger they seem to
      get -- it's funny... </P>
    
    <P>I've had my two front teeth straightened at the dentist. The appointment
      was 2 1/2 hours long and he's put temporary crowns in at the moment, but
      they're nice -- it's just that I'm a bit paranoid about the fact that
      they're held in by glue -- I really hope they don't fall out! I also
      failed my driving test in March, but I'll take it again in August. </P>
    
    <P>I've got your phone number. It would be really nice to see you
      again...one night, for old times' sake, huh? I'm in Lewisham now in a very
      beautiful flat, above my brothers -- I'm very free and very happy. Anyway,
      Fran, I'll give you a ring in the next month or two (I say that far away
      because I know how inefficient I am at getting things like that together,
      but this, I will, eventually, honest). </P>
    
    <P> Lots of love </P>
    
    <P>Kate. </P>
    
    <P> PS No, I don't really see people from school much, but I find it so
      strange when I do -- I feel so, so, different, very far away from them.
    </P>
    
    <P>------------ </P>
    
    <P> It's pretty certain that Kate did not have anything to do with this
      book. Nearly all of the quotations of Kate herself come from published
      interviews, and many little inaccuracies pepper the text, most of which
      would probably have been corrected by the Bush family if they had been
      given a chance to edit it before publication. At times, Juby echoes Peter
      FitzGerald-Morris's own writings on Kate so closely that his reliance on
      the series of Homeground columns called &quot;Five Years Ago&quot;
      frequently becomes glaringly obvious. Despite these flaws, the book is so
      loyal to Kate, and at the same time sufficiently informative and accurate,
      that IED would be surprised if the Bush or Homeground camps commented
      negatively about it. </P>
    
    <P>IED should add that the book does also include twelve colour and fifteen
      black-and-white photographs, fully half of which he had never seen before.
      And the quality of the reproductions is pretty high. All in all, despite
      many small errors of fact and typos, despite a frequently over-protective
      tone and despite a slight tendency to pad with redundant commentary and
      description, this book is a winner. IED will have more to say when he has
      finished it, but it's already clear to him that Juby's book can be
      recommended without hesitation to any and all Kate Bush fans. </P>
    
    <P>The book is published by Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Ltd., 1 Tavistock
      Chambers, Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2SG, for anyone who wants to find
      out how to get a copy. Price: 12 Pounds 95 Pence. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
      <BR> Subject: Book review: Kerry Juby, Kate Bush: The Whole Story </P>
    
    <P> To make as clear as possible the extent of his reconsideration of the
      Kerry Juby biography of Kate, IED herewith posts his final, more detailed
      evaluation. </P>
    
    <P> Kate Bush: The Whole Story, </P>
    
    <P>by Kerry Juby with the assistance of Karen Sullivan. </P>
    
    <P>(Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, London, 1988.) </P>
    
    <P> The second of three new books about Kate Bush to emerge in the latter
      half of 1988 is Kerry Juby's Kate Bush: The Whole Story (available from
      Sidgwick Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Ltd., 1 Tavistock Chambers, Bloomsbury
      Way, London WC1A 2SG; price: 12 Pounds 95 Pence), which was written with
      the assistance of Karen Sullivan. (The other books are the anonymously
      written and published Kate Bush With Love, a scapbook comprising
      facsimiles of old magazine cuttings, and Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary,
      which had not been released at the time of this writing.) </P>
    
    <P>IED's initial reaction to Juby's book was naively positive: it is nicely
      bound in hardcover, with a simple and elegant dustjacket that features a
      familiar black-and-white photograph of Kate. It is a legitimate
      publication, which makes a nice change. It must be said at the outset,
      however, that this book is not an &quot;authorised&quot; biography. There
      is, in fact, no evidence that IED could find in the text that Kate had
      even consented to an interview with the authors. Juby does not admit this,
      but tries to indicate that his connection with the Bush family was closer
      than it apparently was: he lists Kate on the acknowledgements page along
      with other sources who actually were consulted firsthand, apparently in a
      deliberate attempt to mislead the reader. Yet as far as IED was able to
      determine, all quotations of Kate herself derive from earlier published or
      recorded interviews--none of which is cited, either in footnotes or a
      bibliography. </P>
    
    <P>Nevertheless, IED was reasonably pleased by the first few chapters of
      this book. At the outset Juby seems to be genuinely interested in &quot;setting
      the record straight&quot;, perhaps in an attempt to offset any negative
      effects which earlier books (mainly the two Vermorel publications) may
      have had on Kate's reputation. This intention was conveyed by Juby's
      insistence--stated and repeated no fewer than five times within the first
      five pages--that Kate's character and background are &quot;normal&quot;,
      whatever that may mean. Although the facts scarcely support such a vague
      and sweeping claim, IED can sympathise with Juby's motives in making it,
      in light of the tone set by the &quot;biographers&quot; who have preceded
      him. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, by page 70 this reader was forced to reassess his
      feelings feelings toward the new book. Shocked by the growing number of
      mistakes in the text, IED began to keep a tally of factual errors. The
      final results were disheartening: 111 errors of fact appear in a text of
      161 pages--a disquieting average of more than two errors for every three
      pages. These range from false statements about the meaning of lyrics (&quot;B.V.s&quot;
      in &quot;Violin&quot; are explained (p. 61) as references to &quot;'Beata
      Virgo', the blessed Virgin&quot;, rather than as a simple term for &quot;backing
      vocals&quot;--a mystery which Kate herself has explained on more than one
      occasion)--to outright falsehoods about Kate&quot;s videos (as, for
      example, when on pp. 31-32 the settings of the Rockflix and Keef videos
      for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, respectively, are confused with each
      other). </P>
    
    <P>Here are just a small additional sampling of the variety of errors you
      can find littering Juby's book: Kate is said to have worked with Roy
      Harper on &quot;a number of albums&quot; (p. 62). As far as IED has ever
      heard, Kate worked on only one track for Roy Harper's Unknown Soldier
      album, and Harper returned the favour by singing on The Dreaming LP. Kate
      is said to read &quot;a great deal&quot; (p. 75), despite her own frequent
      admission that she reads relatively slowly and little. Kate is several
      times said to be &quot;afraid of flying,&quot; despite her own
      explanation--included in the book!--that she is not particularly &quot;afraid&quot;,
      but simply prefers other forms of travel when possible. </P>
    
    <P>Kate's family are described (p. 88) as being &quot;able to control...any
      publications concerning Kate and ensure that her career is recorded with
      complete integrity&quot;--an obviously, tragically untrue remark which can
      only have been made for self-serving reasons. &quot;Warm and Soothing&quot;
      is described (p. 96) as a song that was &quot;never released&quot;! </P>
    
    <P>And at one point Kate's words are actually changed in order so that they
      might fit the mistaken view of the author: On page 126 Juby misquotes Kate
      from the 1985 Tony Myatt interview as saying: &quot;The concept &lt;of &quot;Hello
      Earth&quot;'s choir section&gt; had been in my head for a couple of months
      and I watched this film called called Nos Feratu &lt;sic&gt;, directed by
      Friedrich Murnau and it was beautiful.&quot; Kate's actual words,
      otherwise identical, included no reference to Murnau, mainly because the
      choir in question is heard in Werner Herzog's re-make. </P>
    
    <P>Obviously, Juby failed to learn the truth, and rather than search for an
      explanation, he simply altered Kate's statement. (For the record, here are
      Kate's precise words, as IED transcribed them from a tape recording: &quot;I'd
      already been writing the concept--I suppose it had been in my head for a
      couple of months. And, uh...I watched this film called Nosferatu, directed
      by, um... Herzog. And it's beautiful! And there was this one piece of
      music...&quot;) </P>
    
    <P>There are many signs that Juby relied heavily on information gleaned
      from the annals of Homeground either through Peter's original Five Years
      Ago series, or through their re-presentation in the chronology part of
      K.B. Complete. Unfortunately, even with this authoritative research aid,
      mistakes are made, as for example when, on page 101, Juby claims that Kate
      undertook the Profiles in Rock interview with Doug Pringle in late 1981
      (rather than December 1980, as was the real case)--a mistake which
      originally appeared in K.B. Complete and which was immediately
      acknowledged as an error by HG in its next issue. No such care was taken
      by Juby. In fact, on two or three occasions Peter's very words are
      reproduced from the chronology, as for example on page 41, where Juby
      makes almost verbatim use of Peter's observation about Kate's unexpected
      choice of Kashka From Baghdad for a performance on the children's
      programme Ask Aspel. </P>
    
    <P>And all this is to say nothing of the large number of unnecessary
      redundancies (otherwise known as padding), unwarranted speculation (a.k.a.
      idle gossip) and ill-considered opinion which fill the book out to its
      present marketable bulk. And of course myriad typographical and editorial
      errors riddle the text, including a tendency to misspell sources&quot;s
      names in a variety of ways (Antony/Anthony Van Laast, Dian/Dyane/Diana
      Gray/Grey, Stuart/Simon Elliot, and Terry Gilliam/Guillia are examples).
      In the end, so many old errors are preserved and so many new ones
      introduced in Juby's book, that IED has found it difficult to choose which
      errors to reproduce as most representative of Juby's habits.
      Unfortunately, this pervasive carelessness will likely do more harm to
      Kate's reputation than good--a result which IED admits is probably the
      opposite of what Juby, however casually, intended. </P>
    
    <P>IED remembers Kate's brother John Carder Bush warning the Romford
      Conventioneers that the Vermorels's books would be neither the last nor
      the worst of the unauthorised Kate Bush &quot;biographies&quot;. He
      predicted then that a great many more such books would appear in future
      years. At the time IED was skeptical that the market would bear such a
      rampant industry of eKsploiTation. How naive IED was! For in the three
      years since that meeting we have had a flood of unapproved and outright
      illegal Kate Bush merchandise the likes of which had not been seen even in
      the first years of Kate's popularity. </P>
    
    <P>The last thing the world needed was another addition to the long list of
      misinformational resources on the subject of Kate Bush. Unfortunately,
      Kerry Juby's book is likely to be with us for some time to come. We should
      expect a paperback edition to begin flooding the market within another
      year. Let's just hope that the publishers take a little time to rectify
      some of the more glaring mistakes before they commit to a second pressing.

      disgustingly slothful. It does sound like a worthwhile source-book, though
      IED will not be so naive as he was with the Juby book, judging before he's

      praised that piece of crap in his first posting. </P>

    <P> Finally, IED had no chance to mention it yesterday, but the 34th issue
      of Homeground has arrived, right on schedule as it always does, and more
      professional-looking than ever. It contains a long article by Peter
      detailing the Kate Bush biography that never was and its connection with
      the Kerry Juby business. Since IED was the author of Homeground's pan
      review of the Juby book, it seems that the publishers, Sidgwick and
      Jackson, are holding IED at least partially responsible, and have
      expressly asked him to send them suggestions for improving Juby's text for
      a second edition. The letter from S&amp;J was reproduced in HG. Meanwhile
      Q Magazine, which printed a very brief (but in IED's opinion perfectly
      accurate and fair) review of the Juby book, are now being sued by Juby for
      libel ! Amazing, and needless to say, a little frightening to IED, who
      sees himself in a position of similar vulnerability! </P>

      <BR> Subject: letter from Sidgwick &amp; Jackson </P>
    
    <P>IED just this second received a big package from Sidgwick &amp; Jackson
      (publishers of Kerry Juby's bio of Kate). It contained a letter from Karen
      Hurrell (editor of the book) and two big thick new S &amp; J hardbacks:
      one about Hitler's last weeks, and the other a massive biography of Paul
      McCartney (why they chose these IEDdoesn't know, but he appreciates the
      gesture nonetheless). </P>
    
    <P>The letter was in response to a very, very long letter IED sent to them
      about three weeks ago, which detailed over eighty errors that he objected
      to in Juby's book. Here's Hurrell's reply: </P>
    
    <P>April 24, 1989 </P>
    
    <P>Dear Mr. Marvick, </P>
    
    <P>Thank you for your letter of April 5, 1989 which I received this
      morning. I am most impressed by the detail you have gone into and am
      extremely grateful for your comments and advice. </P>
    
    <P>I can appreciate your points about damage done to Kate's reputation, and
      the very obvious need for an accurate, authoritative book in a crowded
      marketplace of 'defective' Kate Bush books. It certainly was not our
      intention to add to this category, and we will make every effort to take
      into consideration (and production) your suggested changes. The next
      revised edition will probably be in paperback format and I have sent a
      copy of these corrections to the editor at Headline, who will be
      publishing the book in massmarket paperback. This publisher was,
      incidentally, the same one to publish our PETER GABRIEL biography and they
      have an excellent reputation in the publishing world. I am sure they will
      take your comments very seriously. </P>
    
    <P>Again, thank you for your time and obvious hard work. It is greatly
      appreciated. I enclose two books which I hope you enjoy. </P>
    
    <P>I will be in touch to let you know the 'state of play'. </P>
    
    <P>With best wishes, Yours sincerely, </P>

    <P>Editor Sidgwick &amp; Jackson 1 Tavistock Chambers Bloomsbury Way London
    </P>
    
    <P>WC1A 2SG England </P>
    
    <P>Dear Ms. Hurrell: </P>
    
    <P>I am moved to write this letter after reading your own letter to the
      editors of Homeground magazine, which was reproduced in their 34th issue.
      In it you expressed a wish to receive further comments from me concerning
      your recent publication, Kate Bush: The Whole Story, written by Kerry
      Juby. </P>
    
    <P>First let me say that I found your letter sympathetic, and I applaud
      your willingness to improve Mr. Juby's text for future editions. I
      understand your natural reluctance to believe the book to be as bad as it
      was made out to be in my review (and in others'), and the tone of your
      letter was so appealing that I have taken the book down again and given it
      another chance, so to speak. </P>
    
    <P>Before continuing, I would like to request that, whether or not you
      decide to follow any of my suggestions as set forth in this letter, you do
      not mention my name in future printings of Mr. Juby's book. I am relying
      on you and on Sidwick &amp; Jackson to respect my request for privacy in
      this matter. </P>
    
    <P>Although I did acknowledge several of the book's redeeming qualities in
      my review for Homeground, the text of my article was abridged by Peter and
      his staff, and so my views may have appeared more severe than in fact was
      the case. I do feel that the book has some excellent features, not the
      least of which is its fine layout and design. The collection of &quot;candid&quot;
      photographs is also of interest, and there is much to be said for the
      trouble which Mr. Juby took to interview some of the musicians and other
      people who have had the experience of working with Kate in the past. Those
      passages--which are more numerous than I had noticed upon first reading
      the book--are of real value, I think, and I am grateful to Mr. Juby for
      them. I would also like to admit here that my tally of 111 errors was
      harsh. Although the number is technically correct, it includes literally
      every substantive mistake of fact--no matter how small--which Mr. Juby
      makes in the course of his lengthy text; as well as those statements which
      I believe are exaggerations or distortions of fact. Appearing as they do
      without qualification, such distortions constitute errors in my view. </P>
    
    <P>In addition, I encountered a number of peculiarities of punctuation and
      grammar. I will not bother to itemize these here, because I assume that
      you are aware of them already. Perhaps I was a bit punctilious in totting
      up these mistakes, some of which I will not mention in this letter because
      they now seem relatively unimportant to me. Please communicate my regrets
      to Mr. Juby for whatever distress my numeral &quot;111&quot; may have
      caused him! </P>
    
    <P>Apologies and qualifications having been duly made, here are the errors
      which, as a devoted fan and student of the work and career of Kate Bush, I
      feel should be corrected or at least defended by Mr. Juby before his book
      goes to a second printing. </P>
    
    <P> Pages xi-xx, 2: Kate is referred to as &quot;normal&quot; no fewer than
      five times (and several more times throughout the text). Kate has said
      this herself, in referece to her childhood, and no doubt it is true, as
      far as it goes. But the term &quot;normal childhood&quot; is quite vague
      and unhelpful. One use of it would therefore have been more than enough. I
      can appreciate the honorable motivation behind such statements, but it
      might be helpful to Mr. Juby if he remembered that the appeal of Kate Bush
      lies as much in the complexity of her music and persona, as in its
      superficial accessibility. Her background, childhood experiences and
      present character are therefore as interesting for their signs of
      abnormality as for their points of convergence with the norm. </P>
    
    <P>Page 3: Here is another sign of Mr. Juby's unfortunate tendency to
      repeat himself unnecessarily. After Kate is &quot;remembered,&quot; in
      paragraph 1, &quot;as always having a great deal of pocket money,&quot;
      Mr. Juby adds, in Paragraph 2, that &quot;Dr. Bush...[found]...plenty of
      pocket money for his children...&quot; Why rehash such information
      needlessly? </P>
    
    <P>Page 7: &quot;Sharply, iron pierces flesh, and the shake is raised on
      the hill.&quot; The word &quot;shake&quot; should read &quot;shape&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 10, Paragraph 3: &quot;School who becoming&quot; should read &quot;School
      was becoming&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Page 13: &quot;Ricky Hooper&quot; should read &quot;Ricky Hopper&quot;.
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 14: &quot;Kate recorded her first demo at Gilmour's home
      studio...They chose Passing Through Air and Maybe and the new tape was
      circulated...&quot; This is misleading. The &quot;first demo&quot; at
      Gilmour's home included far more than two or three tracks. What I believe
      Mr. Juby may have meant to say was that Saxophone Song and The Man With
      the Child in His Eyes (but not Passing Through Air), as well as a song
      known as Maybe, were chosen from among the songs recorded at Gilmour's
      home, for re-recording under more professional conditions. In other words,
      it should be made clear that there were at least three stages in the &quot;demo&quot;-recording
      process: the first consisting of many recordings of songs (Kate has put
      the number at &quot;about two hundred&quot;) which were made alone at
      home, or with the family's help; the second consisting of a recording of
      perhaps a dozen or fifteen songs made at the home of Mr. Gilmour with a
      small band; and the third consisting of only three songs-- Saxophone Song
      and The Man With the Child in His Eyes and the so-called Maybe-- all of
      which were executed in a professional context and submitted to EMI, with a
      successful result. </P>
    
    <P>Mr. Juby actually says as much in the last paragraph of page 14, but the
      preceding misstatements put the later accurate ones in doubt. I know that
      this is rather dry material for a biography of a popular figure like Kate
      Bush, but it is nonetheless important, especially in view of the fact that
      some of these early demo recordings are now finding their way into
      collectors' hands. </P>
    
    <P>Page 25: Andrew Powell is quoted at length expressing his opinion that
      the extreme speed of the recording process for The Kick Inside &quot;helped
      immensely.&quot; Wouldn't it be appropriate to point out that Kate's own
      view is on record as being quite opposite to Mr. Powell's? </P>
    
    <P>Page 28: Mr. Juby identifies James in James and the Cold Gun as &quot;James
      of the James Gang&quot;. Here's what Kate herself had to say (this is from
      an old issue of the Kate Bush Club Newsletter): </P>
    
    <P> Q.: In James and the Cold Gun did you refer to anyone in particular?
    </P>
    
    <P>A.: I've had lots of letters about this, many from people called James,
      with plenty of suggestions for identities of the &quot;James&quot;, but
      the answer is: nobody. When I wrote the song, James was the right name for
      it. </P>
    
    <P> Page 31: Mr. Juby says that Keef MacMillan directed Kate's &quot;first&quot;
      video for Wuthering Heights. It's quite well known and amply documented
      that Keef's video--the one included in Kate's official video
      compilations--was created after the &quot;field&quot; or &quot;moors&quot;
      video, which was made by a fledgling video company called Rockflix early
      in 1978. Mr. Juby confuses matters even more--and shows that he had not
      actually seen either of these videos--by saying that the early &quot;moors&quot;
      video featured Kate in a white gown in a meadow. In fact Kate wore a red
      dress in that video. </P>
    
    <P>Page 33: Mr. Juby says that &quot;later [U.S. editions of The Kick
      Inside] featured the U.K. design&quot;. This is false. There have been two
      different U.S. cover-designs, but neither one is even remotely like the &quot;official&quot;
      U.K. album design--which, incidentally, is the only one sanctioned by
      Kate. The first of the &quot;U.S.&quot; designs was actually the same as
      the Canadian design (still in circulation there). It features a close-up
      photograph of Kate with her hand against her face. The second U.S. design
      (still in use here) features a shot of Kate crouching, and wearing blue
      jeans and red socks. Both of these designs were decided upon at the
      regional offices, and Kate had no part in their selection. </P>
    
    <P>Page 33: Also on this page, Mr. Juby describes the Efteling film (a film
      of videos Kate made in Holland in 1978) as having seven songs. It has only
      six. </P>
    
    <P>Page 61: Mr. Juby interprets &quot;BVs&quot; in Violin as an
      abbreviation for &quot;Beata Virgo&quot;(!) In fact, Kate has several
      times explained that &quot;BVs&quot; is just short for &quot;backing
      vocals&quot;. The Blessed Virgin never enters into it, as far as I know.
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 62: &quot;Roy Harper was another of EMI's aspiring musicians, less
      successful in the long run than Bush, but a close friend with whom she
      later worked on a number of albums...&quot; This is highly misleading.
      Kate only worked on one album of Harper's: the Unknown Soldier LP; and
      furthermore, her only real contribution was to a single track on that
      album. This is the kind of statement that causes considerable damage,
      because, as I know from experience, many newer fans will now be searching
      for more than one Roy Harper/Kate Bush collaboration, based solely upon
      Mr. Juby's inaccurate report. Collectors are plagued by more than enough
      distortions and false rumours as it is, without being led further afield
      by a supposedly &quot;authoritative&quot; new resource. </P>
    
    <P>Pages 68-69: Mr. Juby twice refers--wrongly--to the governess in The
      Infant Kiss as the mother of the children. There is no familial
      relationship between the children and the woman in either the song or the
      sources for the song (the film The Innocents; and Henry James's novella
      The Turn of the Screw, which served as the basis for the film). For this
      reason Mr. Juby's criticism on page 69 (&quot;It is a distinct
      juxtaposition of unmotherly, unnatural feelings and maternal love that
      Kate is describing, and it doesn't quite fit her description of how she
      sees it&quot;) is unjustified. </P>
    
    <P>Page 73: &quot;[Apart from bicycling...] any exercise that [Kate] gets
      is in the form of the movement that accompanies her music.&quot; Actually,
      Kate has practised kyudo, an East Asian form of archery, for several
      years. She has also been known to roller-skate on occasion. </P>
    
    <P>Page 49: Alan Murphy is quoted as saying that Kate kept &quot;buckets of
      tea...and Kit Kats and things&quot; in the studio. Fine. But it's quite
      unnecessary, not to say suspicious, to use this statement again on page 73
      by claiming that &quot;most musicians [my italics] remember there being
      buckets of tea and bicuits and Kit Kats about during every session.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 61 (writing about Violin): &quot;It is a coy, devilish attempt to
      breathe a little fire into a staid violin, but in many ways it fails
      because of the song's lack of melody.&quot; This statement is so silly and
      demonstrates such colossal ignorance of music that I am sure I needn't
      argue further for its deletion from future editions. </P>
    
    <P>Page 75: &quot;Kate reads a great deal.&quot; Kate does not read a great
      deal! She has explained many times that she seldom reads, because she is a
      slow reader and feels that it takes up too much of her worktime (though
      she has also admitted that her attitude is &quot;silly, really&quot;). I
      believe Mr. Juby was aware of this fact, but for some reason chose to
      ignore it. It would certainly be accurate to say that books have had a
      powerful influence on Kate's work, and that she loves reading. But she has
      not read particularly widely or deeply, and has said as much on several
      occasions. </P>
    
    <P>Page 76: &quot;...she expressed a great deal of interest in the latest
      cult of New Wave artists.&quot; It is misleading to make this statement
      without dating its source, since Kate's enthusiasm for virtually any kind
      of Western popular music has been minimal since about 1981 or so--hardly
      contemporaneous with the &quot;latest cult&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 76 is the statement: &quot;A sixties child by heart, she
      appreciates the Beatles, but finds most inspiration in Billie Holliday
      [sic]...Gene Kelly and Judy Garland.&quot; This sentence is not only
      illogical (Holiday, Kelly and Garland were scarcely typical role models
      for a &quot;sixties child by heart&quot;), but false. To my knowledge her
      only mention of Garland and Kelly were in reference to their inspiring
      influence upon her as a child. By contrast the later work of the Beatles,
      and of John Lennon in particular, have remained a powerful source of
      inspiration for Kate throughout her career. </P>
    
    <P>Page 81: &quot;The eroticism of Kate Bush is undeniable, however...&quot;
      Assuming that Mr. Juby means the eroticism of her work or performance
      style, this statement is fine. But the sentence continues: &quot;...and no
      virgin, even one as imaginative as Kate, could write a song like Feel It,
      or L'Amour Looks Something Like You.&quot; This is not only an extremely
      dubious claim. It also constitutes an embarrassing lapse in taste. Surely
      idle speculation about the date of Kate's loss of virginity is not
      something the author or his readers can benefit from. </P>
    
    <P>Page 82: I'm afraid I found this paragraph particularly offensive. &quot;Kate
      is afraid of flying. She is slightly miffed, however, when the subject is
      brought up, hotly denying that she is afraid, but rather explaining that
      it just isn't her favourite manner in which to travel...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Then, on page 135, Mr. Juby writes: &quot;Overcoming her fear of flying,
      Kate agreed to fly over...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Mr. Juby is assuming, in other words, that the rumours that Kate is &quot;afraid&quot;
      of flying are true, even when he himself is fully aware of Kate's flat
      denials! That's really irresponsible. Especially since we have far more
      than just Kate's say-so on this issue: Kate has made literally dozens of
      flights between England and Europe, England and North America, England and
      Japan, England and Australia, all of which she undertook, one may be sure,
      without complaint. Mr. Juby has no business denying the facts in favour of
      silly, unsupported gossip. It is at about this point in the book that Mr.
      Juby plunges into a low celebration of similarly ridiculous rumours:
      exhuming stories about Kate being pregnant at a Peter Gabriel concert in
      1987; having an affair with Gabriel; and even being a drug addict! As in
      the case I cited above concerning the false rumour about a fear of flying,
      Mr. Juby dwells on these bits of nonsense with a fascination that implies
      they are somehow more true than Kate's denials. And he does this even when
      he himself has already printed those denials in his own book! </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 82: Mr. Juby quotes at length some uncredited hearsay
      attributed to Kate by the writer Fred Vermorel--a far less responsible
      author than Mr. Juby himself, as I'm sure Mr. Juby would agree. The
      context of this dubious citation is the subject of the importance of dream
      states as a source of inspiration for Kate. Yet even Mr. Juby expresses
      doubt about the authenticity of the quotation. His text would have been
      stronger if he had looked for more solid support for his ideas. Sorely
      missing are any of Kate's several statements to the effect that her
      works--and particularly The Ninth Wave-- deal with the character's
      resistance of sleep, and with the conflict between dreams and the
      real-life problems of her songs' characters. Also missing is Kate's
      interesting and relevant opinion (expressed in the course of more than one
      televised interview) that dreams are as much a part of &quot;real life&quot;
      and the &quot;real world&quot; as wakefulness, and that her work should
      not be misinterpreted as less &quot;realistic&quot; or more &quot;escapist&quot;
      because of its exploration of parallel states of consciousness. </P>
    
    <P>Page 83: &quot;She is a truly sweet woman, with a high, consonantless
      mode of speech betraying a cross between a suburban South London accent
      and some sort of contrived innocence.&quot; Mr. Juby's attitude toward his
      subject seems confused in this statement--as in many other parts of his
      text. Kate's &quot;sweetness&quot; wouldn't seem to be supported by her &quot;contrivance&quot;
      of innocence. On the other hand, it is possible that Kate's speech
      patterns, and even perhaps her accent, may have undergone some changes
      over the years, and Mr. Juby might have searched for explanations of those
      possible changes. </P>
    
    <P>Page 88: &quot;The family are able to control to a certain degree any
      publications concerning Kate and ensure that her career is recorded with
      complete integrity.&quot; I don't wish to sound callous, but Mr. Juby's
      text, which was unauthorized and obviously not edited by anyone in the
      Bush family, and which appeared with all the errors enumerated in this
      letter, is a manifest contradiction of his statement above. The
      unfortunate fact is that the family are unable to control the publications
      concerning Kate, and have had only limited success in ensuring that her
      career is recorded with &quot;complete integrity.&quot; Witness not only
      Mr. Juby's unauthorized text, but also Mr. Vermorel's two execrable &quot;books&quot;,
      Paul Kerton's empty biography, and the more recent Kate Bush: A Visual
      Documentary by Mayes and Cann--not one of which was ever &quot;controlled&quot;
      by the Bush family (more's the pity), except insofar as their
      non-participation may be construed as &quot;control&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Also on pages 88-89: Mr. Juby remarks upon the difficulty of obtaining
      interviews with Kate, and in general of breaking the barrier of privacy
      which guards her personal life from the prying eyes of journalists and
      biographers. As a matter of fact, similar observations litter the pages of
      The Whole Story, creating an almost bewildering impression of redundancy
      and sour grapes. </P>
    
    <P>Page 89 includes a fussy account of Kate's corporate earnings over a
      five-year period. Such information is presumably accessible through public
      records. I do wish, though, that Mr. Juby had stopped to consider whether
      this kind of idle consideration of Kate's personal fortune serves any
      useful purpose, and whether his standards of propriety regarding his
      intrusion into the private life of his subject should really be limited
      solely by what is legal. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, too, might weigh the
      importance and dignity of the artist whom Mr. Juby contracted with them to
      write about, against the kind of sleazy sifting through rubbish-bins which
      this sort of documentation resembles. </P>
    
    <P>Page 91: &quot;...Annie Lennox specifically incorporates Kate's style of
      exaggerated vocals into her repertoire.&quot; This statement, which is
      phrased so as to resemble fact, is actually a personal opinion which I for
      one find absurd. Ms. Lennox's vocal stylings are almost completely based
      upon Blues and other American popular vocal traditions. If Mr. Juby has
      found a statement by Ms. Lennox herself attesting to Kate's influence, why
      not include it? The same criticism can be made of Mr. Juby's likening of
      the vocal style of Susan &quot;Sarendon&quot; [sic] in The Rocky Horror
      Picture Show to Kate's. I am unable to detect any hint of a connection
      between the two styles, and I look in vain through Mr. Juby's text for a
      justification of his peculiar analogy. </P>
    
    <P>From the bottom of page 92 through the end of page 94: Mr. Juby does
      nothing except repeat, almost verbatim, statements which he has already
      made. I would have expected Sidgwick &amp; Jackson to have made at least
      some effort to put a rein on Mr. Juby's chronic habit of padding his text.
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 96: &quot;Just prior to this, Kate had recorded Warm and Soothing,
      which was also never released.&quot; In fact, as Mr. Juby would soon have
      learned had he done some basic homework, Warm and Soothing was released,
      as the b-side of Kate's December Will Be Magic Again single, in 1981. </P>
    
    <P>Page 97: &quot;She appeared on two Radio BBC-1 programmes with Paul
      Gambaccini where she played her music...&quot; Kate didn't play any of her
      own music on either of those programmes. She played only other people's
      music--that was the point of the broadcasts. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 97: district [sic] use of the Fairlight.&quot; This
      statement is unfortunately typical of music critics' view of Gabriel's
    </P>
    
    <P>connection with Kate Bush. It implies that Kate's deep and longtime
      fascination with the Fairlight CMI is somehow primarily a function of
      Peter Gabriel's &quot;increasing&quot; influence. Kate has said several
      times that she had envisioned an instrument with the Fairlight's
      capabilities from her earliest years of composition. It is therefore more
      or less co-incidental that she first happened to encounter the instrument
      during the PG3 sessions. The growing role of the Fairlight in her
      composition and performance techniques is therefore basically unrelated to
      her infrequent and rather minimal collaboration with Peter Gabriel. The
      influence of Gabriel's own music on Kate's, though real, has often been
      exaggerated. </P>
    
    <P>Page 101: In a paragraph detailing Kate's activities at the end of 1981,
      Mr. Juby writes: &quot;Finally, after an exhausting interview lasting
      several days for a US production, Profiles in Rock, Kate took a
      well-deserved break...&quot; Several days, perhaps, but not a whole year.
      The Profiles in Rock interview was filmed in December 1980, not 1981. This
      error appears in Peter FitzGerald-Morris's chronology for the book Kate
      Bush Complete, which is how I suppose Mr. Juby came to repeat it. Mr. Juby
      really should have studied the superlative fanzine Homeground, however,
      wherein Peter promptly acknowledged this mistake of dating in a list of
      errata. </P>
    
    <P>Page 102: &quot;Kate left for Jamaica...coming back to work with Zaine
      Griff on her tribute [my italics] to Kemp's Flowers.&quot; Either Mr. Juby
      believes that the song was written by Kate, or he is under the impression
      that Zaine Griff is a woman. The song Flowers was not written by Kate, but
      by Zaine Griff, who is a man. Mr. Juby would have known this had he taken
      the trouble to listen to Mr. Griff's album Figures, on which the song in
      question appears. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 102, Mr. Juby describes Kate as &quot;flushed and giggling&quot;
      on the occasion when her dress-strap broke during the Prince's Trust Gala
      performance in 1981. This may sound quaint, but it is utterly false. In
      fact, the trifling incident is memorable primarily because of the
      extraordinary sangfroid which Kate showed during a small emergency on
      stage. There wasn't a hint of a flush or a giggle. </P>
    
    <P>And again on page 115 Mr. Juby writes: &quot;...she came out from hiding
      flushed and girlishly enthusiastic about her 'man'.&quot; This statement
      is distasteful and--of course--completely untrue. I am surprised that
      Sidgwick &amp; Jackson were willing to go forward with it. In fact Kate
      demonstrated a reserve and dignity on that occasion which contrasted
      markedly from the churlish, leering attitude of the Press. </P>
    
    <P>Page 104 (writing about The Dreaming): &quot;The overuse of percussion
      and synthesized [sic] becomes repetitive to the point of annoyance. She
      put a label on the sleeve requesting that the album be played loud, but
      the result of obeying her wish is a throbbing headache...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Remarks like these unwisely draw attention to Mr. Juby's shallow
      understanding of Kate's work, and indeed, to his pedestrian musical taste
      in general. He peppers his text with this kind of nonsense more and more
      often as the book progresses. </P>
    
    <P>To wit (page 104): &quot;It is an ambitious, even overproduced, album...&quot;;
      and (page 107): &quot;She was just beginning to grasp hold of the tools
      that the studio and various instruments had to offer, and The Dreaming
      displays an overabundance of stimuli; it is an overproduced album with far
      too many external effects marring [my italics] the clean lines that shaped
      Never For Ever.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>When asked (in an issue of the Kate Bush Club Newsletter), &quot;Do you
      mind if the press label the new album 'over-produced', or 'even weirder'&quot;?
      Kate replied: &quot;I don't mind 'even weirder', but I don't like
      'over-produced'. Her point was well taken. Kate's introduction of
      production techniques into all aspects of her music-making process during
      the recording of The Dreaming is a milestone in modern musical history,
      and constitutes a large part of her art as a whole. The casual dismissal
      of The Dreaming as &quot;over-produced&quot; shows a woeful ignorance of
      the nature of the work. Further, Mr. Juby's naive hankering for what he
      calls the &quot;more infantile and commercial Never For Ever&quot; leads
      him to describe the production of The Dreaming-- a pervasive aspect of the
      album of which Kate was by 1982 already a supreme technical master--as &quot;marring
      the clean lines&quot; of her earlier work. With this phrase Mr. Juby
      reveals his sad inability to appreciate not only the progression from
      Never For Ever to The Dreaming, but also the linearity of Kate's aesthetic
      progress beginning with her earliest recordings and continuing steadily
      through The Ninth Wave and Experiment IV. </P>
    
    <P>Pages 104-105: &quot;The lyrics range from utterly confusing to
      obsessively dramatic...&quot; In fact, every word in The Dreaming makes
      eminent sense within the context of the music--providing the listener is
      willing to take a little time to study them. </P>
    
    <P>Page 105: &quot;She claims Get Out of My House and Leave It Open are
      attempts to analyse very complex personal emotions, but [my italics] they
      are harsh and unmusical numbers, replete with slamming doors and bawdy,
      hoarse hollering.&quot; Mr. Juby apparently feels that the sounds which he
      so crudely describes are incompatible with Kate's &quot;claim&quot;. They
      are not, of course. Mr. Juby is simply unwilling or unable to appreciate
      the musical expression of &quot;complex personal emotions&quot; unless
      they are limited to soft, sweet sounds; whereas Kate has a broader and
      more enlightened view of music's potential range of expression. </P>
    
    <P>Similarly, on page 106, Mr. Juby betrays the narrowness of his musical
      taste and understanding by saying: &quot;Perhaps the most typical Kate
      Bush numbers on the album are All the Love and Houdini where she uses her
      voice at its haunting best.&quot; [My italics.] As though the success of
      Kate's expressive efforts could be measured in direct proportion to the
      volume level of her songs! Needless to say, these two songs are no more &quot;typical&quot;
      than any of the others--Mr. Juby simply likes them better. </P>
    
    <P>Page 108: &quot;The Dreaming is of an autobiographical nature...&quot;
      In fact Kate has said (more than once) that virtually none of The Dreaming
      is autobiographical, except insofar as every artist's work can be said to
      reflect aspects of their own consciousness. </P>
    
    <P>On pages 124-127 Mr. Juby repeatedly refers to the protagonist of The
      Ninth Wave as a man. In fact, if he had taken only minimal care in
      listening to the music, he would have realized that the protagonist is a
      woman. And if a study of the work had not set him straight, a simple
      reading of Kate's detailed synopsis of the story, published in an issue of
      the Newsletter, might have helped him. She begins: &quot;It's the trial of
      this girl who's in the water; and all she wants to do is survive and keep
      her head above water.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Page 126: Mr. Juby here deliberately misquotes Kate in order to
      reconcile her statement with his own misconception. He quotes her as
      saying (from the Tony Myatt interview): &quot;The concept [of Hello Earth]
      had been in my head for a couple of months and I watched this film called
      Nos Feratu&quot; [sic] &quot;by Friedrich Murnau...&quot; (Incidentally,
      the title is again misspelled--as &quot;Noseratu&quot;--on page 76.)
      Kate's actual words--unmistakable on the recording--were: &quot;...this
      film called Nosferatu, directed by Herzog...&quot; Kate is referring, of
      course, to Werner Herzog, and his re-make of Murnau's silent film of the
      1920s. Mr. Juby's mistake in this case is serious, because again, Kate's
      fans might well go to some lengths to find the choir music in question in
      the soundtrack to Murnau's film (which doesn't even have any soundtrack!),
      rather than seeing Herzog's movie, which features the relevant music
      prominently in its final scenes. </P>
    
    <P>Page 128: Mr. Juby refers to a &quot;disco beat that runs through most
      of the A-side of the album.&quot; In fact the first and the last tracks of
      the album employ strict military march tattoos as their rhythmic bases;
      the second track uses stark, aggressive, cymbal-less rhythms with a 'cello
      obligato--as far from &quot;disco&quot; as can be imagined; and the fourth
      track's rhythm is slow, irregular and unsettling, in reflection of the
      song's depiction of a psychotic murderer. That leaves only one song on
      Side A, The Big Sky, the rhythm of which follows a very loose, basic rock
      pattern which could be described as &quot;disco&quot; only in the broadest
      possible sense. Perhaps, more than Mr. Juby's laxitude with the facts, it
      is ill-considered remarks about musical style such as this one on page 128
      which have most annoyed his readers, and which have succeeded in
      alienating so many of Kate's fans from his book. Mr. Juby must realize
      that a thorough understanding of the music is paramount in any book which
      attempts to deal with an artist of Kate's calibre and importance. </P>
    
    <P>Pages 129-130: &quot;[ The Big Sky ] is less serious than anything else
      on the album, portraying a whimsical philandering mood in which she simply
      gazes at and appreciates nature and the grandiose spectrum of the sky. It
      probably isn't a bad thing to loosen up on imagery: to allow music to take
      precedence at times over lyric can only emphasize the rounded nature of
      her talents.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>These comments will astonish any serious fan of Kate's music. (Not to
      mention anyone who takes the time to check &quot;philandering&quot; in the
      dictionary--which I advise Mr. Juby to do!) They demonstrate a failure on
      Mr. Juby's part to look beyond the most superficial veneer of Kate's
      work--a failure which undermines many other passages in his book. There
      are many subtle undercurrents in the lyrics of this song which put the lie
      to Mr. Juby's suggestion that their meaning is simple and insubstantial.
      Beyond that, however, the implication that in general Kate would be better
      off &quot;allowing music to take precedence&quot; over lyrics is as
      ignorant as it is patronizing. </P>
    
    <P>Page 130: &quot;The video for Running Up That Hill was considered too
      risque for the States (it featured her dancing apparently too erotically)
      and thus her performance on Wogan was used in its place for promotional
      purposes.&quot; This statement (which incidentally was lifted almost
      verbatim from Peter FitzGerald-Morris's chronology) invariably induces
      surprised laughter from Kate's American fans. Too &quot;erotic&quot; for
      MTV? The idea is completely absurd. </P>
    
    <P>It is far more likely is that MTV did not wish to air a video which did
      not feature lip-synching. They therefore asked EMI to send along an
      alternate clip with lip-synching, and EMI obliged by offering her on-air
      performance from the Wogan programme. It will no doubt disappoint Mr. Juby
      to learn that there is no Page-Three innuendo to be gleaned from this
      trivial incident. </P>
    
    <P>Also on page 130: Mr. Juby twice more refers to passages of &quot;strong
      percussion without cymbals&quot; as clear signs of Peter Gabriel's
      increasing influence. Mr. Juby evidently has never taken the time to make
      a study of the recordings of Captain Beefheart, David Bowie, or even Rolf
      Harris, which contain early examples of percussion similar to the kind he
      describes. Since Kate has often referred to the influence which these
      artists' work have had on her own recording techniques, such percussive
      sounds in and of themselves are by no means necessarily a sign of Mr.
      Gabriel's influence. </P>
    
    <P>I believe Mr. Juby is struck more by the similarity of tuning in the two
      artists' drum-sounds from this period. He should therefore also have
      acknowledged Phil Collins, who provided drumming on Gabriel's third solo
      LP, and Hugh Padgham, an engineer who later worked with Kate. These men
      were certainly as instrumental as Gabriel himself in developing the
      distinctive sound in question--a sound which is in any case not at all
      identical to the drum timbres in Kate's own recordings. </P>
    
    <P>Page 131: &quot;The video [of Running Up That Hill ] features Kate and
      dancer Michael Hervieu, clad in grey, simple leotard...&quot; Actually the
      costumes are notable for their differences from the &quot;simple leotard&quot;
      which Mr. Juby describes. In actuality both Kate and Mr. Hervieu wear
      hakama, the traditional culotte-like garments worn in the practice of
      kyudo. This is a typically Bushian subtextual reference to Kate's interest
      in and respect for aspects of Eastern philosophy. </P>
    
    <P>Also page 131 (in reference to Wilhelm Reich): &quot;...who was sent to
      prison for creating a rain machine.&quot; The &quot;rain machine,&quot;
      the primary alleged function of which was not to bring rain but to control
      a theoretical property of nature known to Reich as orgone, had in fact
      nothing at all to do with the psycho-analyst's arrest and subsequent
      imprisonment. Reich fell afoul of U.S. law for selling boxes, known as
      orgone accumulators, across state lines. In both Kate's song and the book
      which inspired it, the childhood experience of Reich's son is limited by a
      child's understanding of events. This dilemma is a major theme of
      Cloudbusting. Such a limited understanding should not have been shared by
      Kate's own biographer, however. </P>
    
    <P>Page 132: Mr. Juby refers to Terry Gilliam as &quot;Terry Guillia&quot;.
      Also on the subject of name misspellings, Kate's dance instructor for
      Running Up That Hill, Dyane Grey, is identified as Diana; Jon Kelly is
      also called John Kelly; and on page 29 Gurdjieff is spelled Gurdjiff.
      Conifer is referred to as Canifer. Reference is made to both a Stewart
      Arnold and a Stewart Avon-Arnold. On page 43 Leif Garrett's name is
      spelled Lief Garrett. On page 65 Kate's brother John Carder Bush is
      referred to as Jon. (Since there are many Johns and Jons connected with
      Kate's career, it's important to keep them straight.) On page 97 Paul
      Gambaccini's name is spelled Gambicini, and on page 158 Donal Lunny's name
      is spelled Donnal. </P>
    
    <P>I hope you have the text on computer-disk, so that these problems can be
      resolved easily. </P>
    
    <P>Page 133 (in reference to the song Mother Stands for Comfort): &quot;If
      one is to go by her previous autobiographical themes, then perhaps one
      could take this track to mean that her mother (her family) will protect
      her from anything, good or bad, from herself and from anyone who comes to
      get her.&quot; As attractive as such a reading of the song is for Mr.
      Juby's biographical purposes, there is absolutely no indication of any
      kind that an autobiographical message was intended in this song. As a
      matter of fact, there are scarcely more than two or three songs in Kate's
      entire published oeuvre which can definitely be said to have a
      significant, direct link with her own personal experience, so unlike the
      usual confessional singer-songwriter is she. She has often said that she
      does not feel her own life experience merits a place in her lyrics. Mr.
      Juby should take her at her word--especially when considering a song like
      Mother Stands For Comfort, which deals explicitly with the subject of a
      psychopathological murderer! </P>
    
    <P>Page 137: &quot;EMI were furious with Kate...&quot; What is Mr. Juby's
      source for this implausible statement? Certainly neither Kate nor EMI.
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 138: &quot; Under the Ivy sounds more like Kate's pre- Dreaming
      recordings, with simplified lyrics...&quot; If the lyrics are &quot;simplified&quot;,
      again Kate's fans invite Mr. Juby to explain them. Their simple surface
      conceals a mysterious collection of riddles and double meanings which have
      fascinated and confused countless of her fans for nearly four years. </P>
    
    <P>Page 141: &quot;To date, The Whole Story still remains on the
      bestselling albums and the bestselling compact discs lists.&quot; This
      information was already out of date when the book first went to press.
    </P>
    
    <P>Page 142: &quot;...Kate appears very young and quite unpolished in
      Wuthering Heights and The Man With the Child in His Eyes, while the
      extraordinary successful [sic] Cloudbusting illustrates her budding
      dramatic skills.&quot; Mr. Juby is judging Kate's mime-and-dance
      performances of the late 1970s by the standards of a short film in which
      Kate acted alongside Donald Sutherland in a realistic dramatic context. He
      therefore sees Kate's acting in the earlier work as &quot;quite
      unpolished.&quot; If Mr. Juby had taken the time to make a careful study
      of the narrative eloquence of Kate's movements in those earlier
      performances, rather than considering them only by the irrelevant
      standards of film-acting, he would not have made such a criticism. </P>
    
    <P>These are the most glaring errors which I personally have noticed in
      Juby's book. You may be inclined to treat some of them lightly. Given the
      importance of Mr. Juby's subject, that would be a mistake. Before closing,
      I want to say again that I do not consider The Whole Story to be entirely
      meritless. It contains some new and interesting information. But Mr. Juby
      should address all of the points that I have made above before re-printing
      the book. In addition, he should make a real effort to revise the overal
      text such that the contradictory and harmful attitudes which pervade it
      are brought into some kind of reconciliation. If he is able to make these
      changes, I am sure that his book will find some new advocates. </P>
    
    <P>Finally, Ms. Hurrell, I take the liberty of reminding you of my wish
      that my name should not appear in any revised edition of the book. </P>
    
    <P>Thank you for your interest in my comments regarding The Whole Story.
    </P>
    
    <P> Sincerely, </P>
    
    <P> Andrew Marvick </P>

      <BR> From: duane@Sun.COM (Duane Day, I.R. - Applications Development)
      <BR> Subject: IED's letter re: Juby </P>
    
    <P>Thanks to IED for posting his informative comments on Juby's book. There
      is only one small part of the letter to which I object: </P>
    
    <P> &gt;Also on Page 130: Mr. Juby twice more refers to passages of &quot;strong
      percussion without cymbals&quot; as clear signs of Peter Gabriel's
      increasing influence. [...] </P>
    
    <P>I believe Mr. Juby is struck more by the similarity of tuning in the two
      artists' drum-sounds from this period. (He should also have acknowledged
      Phil Collins, the drummer on Gabriel's third solo LP, and Hugh Padgham,
      the engineer, who were certainly as instrumental as Gabriel himself in
      developing the distinctive sound in question.) </P>
    
    <P>Two things: first, Collins was not the only drummer on PGIII. Most of
      the songs featured Jerry Marotta on drums. Collins, I believe, only played
      on the song &quot;Intruder&quot;, which featured the snare drum treated
      with gated reverb (resulting in a very abrupt, &quot;un-natural&quot;
      decay) which has come to be one of every modern producer's bag of tricks.
    </P>
    
    <P>Second, regarding the statement that Collins and Padgham were as
      instrumental as Gabriel in developing the sound in question - this
      contradicts Peter's own comments. For example, take the following quote
      from Armando Gallo's book Peter Gabriel : </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The drum sound on 'Intruder', which you now hear everywhere, was
      originally Hugh Padgham's set-up and he should get credit for that. I took
      Phil Collins' cymbals away and put some tom-toms up because up until that
      time he played a lot of cymbals. I remember the moment when I first heard
      that 'gated reverb'. I stopped the session we were working on and said
      that I wanted to record that sound immediately for 'Intruder'. The others
      were a little taken aback at my enthusiasm but did as I asked. I was
      certain that it was a 'landmark' drum sound. Now I get angry when people
      say I have copied Phil's drum sound.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>According to this statement, Padgham should get the credit for
      developing the sound. By inference, Peter should get the credit for using
      it, specifically on &quot;Intruder&quot;, and also for excluding cymbals
      from this album. It is hard to understand how Collins should share equally
      in the credit for the gated reverb snare, unless one believes that Peter
      was pettily denying him his due - an action that would be completely out
      of character for him. </P>
    
    <P>These minor errors on IED's part do not diminish my appreciation of his
      efforts in setting the record straight. Indeed, this correction is offered
      in exactly the same spirit. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: about Violin </P>
    
    <P> &gt;&gt; Page 61 (writing about Violin ): &quot;It is a coy, devilish
      attempt to breathe a little fire into a staid violin, but in many ways it
      fails because of the song's lack of melody.&quot; This statement is so
      silly and demonstrates such colossal ignorance of music that I am sure I
      needn't argue further for its deletion from future editions. </P>
    
    <P> &gt; Perhaps I'm colossally ignorant of music, too, but I don't see an
      obvious reason to claim that Juby is wrong. (I'm not saying he's right,
      either, but Juby does at least attempt to justify his assertion that the
      song fails in some ways.) Could you elaborate? </P>
    
    <P> Sure. I admit that I went a bit over the top over that excerpt from
      Juby's book, because there were two separate annoying assumptions in it.
      The first (interpreting as well as I could Juby's awkward and vague
      language) was that the violin is somehow by nature &quot;staid&quot;.
      Neither I nor Kate shares Juby's image of the violin as a &quot;staid&quot;
      instrument. In fact, Kate's image of the violin, at least at that time,
      was that it's about as far from being &quot;staid&quot; as any instrument
      can be. I couldn't understand what Juby could have had in mind. I guess
      that he thinks of the violin as only good for slow, sombre classical
      music, and he therefore naively assumes that others think of it that way,
      too. But in Irish and English folk music the fiddle has always taken on a
      potent role, very often serving as a kind of fiery, almost violent and
      even percussive driving force for traditional dances. My main point is
      just that there's nothing inherently &quot;staid&quot; about the
      instrument--it's the music that determines that. </P>
    
    <P>The other thing that annoyed me about the comment was Juby's blithe
      assumption that Violin (the song) has no melody ! Well, that's just
      ridiculous. All this means is that Juby has no ear ! The melody in Violin
      operates on a different basis than the melodies of most popular songs. For
      one thing it's devised around a very unusual (for pop music) augmented
      chord progression (listen to the descending pattern played by the violin
      in the first four measures of the track, for instance) which Juby's ear
      apparently can't grasp. But if it can be hummed, isn't it &quot;melody&quot;?
      IED has no problem singing (in the shower!) the whole song through. How
      could there be no melody if that's possible? The fact is that &quot;melody&quot;
      doesn't have to be sweet and simple in order to qualify as melody. It just
      has to be a sequence of notes which form a coherent pattern, usually
      repeated. Melody is so broad a term, and encompasses such a vast range of
      possible tonal combinations, that to say Violin &quot;doesn't have&quot;
      any is utterly absurd. </P>
    
    <P> &gt;&gt;'over-produced'.&quot; Her point was well taken. Kate's
      introduction of production techniques into all aspects of her music-making
      process during the recording of The Dreaming is a milestone in modern
      musical history, and constitutes a very large part of her art as a whole.
    </P>
    
    <P> &gt; I like *The Dreaming* a lot, but &quot;a milestone in modern
      musical history&quot;? Elaboration on this point would be much appreciated
      also. </P>
    
    <P> All such judgements are based on some degree of subjective perception.
      I personally am convinced that The Dreaming is one of the three or four
      greatest achievements in the history of modern popular music. One could
      then argue that if this is so, it's possible to argue that it's a great
      achievement in the history of music, period. I think that in general the
      musicians whom the public of our own time value highly--Bruce Springsteen,
      for example, who is both immensely popular and (generally speaking)
      critically respected--will eventually be reevaluated by far more stringent
      musical standards, and artists who nowadays may not be appreciated to such
      an extent will some day be recognized as the truly superior figures in the
      field of popular music. </P>
    
    <P>For a while in the nineteenth century the biggest names in music were
      Offenbach and Meyerbeer. Well, as I see the music scene of the last
      twenty-five years, only one or two of the artists who are presently
      considered &quot;great&quot; are likely to retain that reputation a
      hundred years from now--probably The Beatles, possibly Bob Dylan;
      conceivably one or two others. The rest will probably be forgotten
      entirely, except by musical historians. </P>
    
    <P>Conversely, it's not beyond possibility that in fifty years or so Kate
      Bush's work will have been acknowledged as the &quot;milestone&quot; I
      claim it is. The Dreaming isn't just exceptional because of its many
      powerful and sophisticated melodic ingredients; or because of its
      innovative (for pop) amalgamation of modal and tonal harmonies; or the
      perfection of its synthesis of a variety of ethnic musical styles (some of
      which had never even been superficially merged anywhere before); or the
      limitless depth of meaning in its lyrics; or its extremely rare attitude
      toward the very notion of &quot;accessibility&quot; in pop music--an
      attitude which results in an uncommon degree of subtextual musical and
      narrative information, much of which is designed to be overlooked. </P>
    
    <P>The Dreaming is also --and perhaps especially--exceptional because it
      represents an attitude toward the nature of music which had never been
      expressed to such a degree. Only one instrument is heard on The Dreaming
      --production. I'm not putting this very clearly, but I am convinced that
      all the breakthroughs in and innovative attitudes toward studio production
      which The Beatles presented in Revolver, Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery
      Tour were but the springboard for the apotheosis of production which is
      The Dreaming. Because it's not just the sophistication of production
      technique I'm considering (although that, too, is of the highest order).
      More importantly, it's the artist's larger conception of the role of
      production as an indispensible part of music. </P>
    
    <P>With The Dreaming &quot;pop songs&quot; are no longer being &quot;composed&quot;.
      Kate is attempting instead to transcribe the miraculous essence of her
      muse directly onto tape, using every technical means she could find. In
      other words, Kate Bush, for the first time in modern musical history,
      attempted in a very physical, literal sense, to perform an act of musical
      alchemy. Whether she succeeded completely is probably debatable. But her
      effort to accomplish such a feat was more thorough and more systematic
      than any artist's had ever--or has ever since--been. The fact that most
      people haven't come to appreciate this yet does not surprise me, but it
      does sometimes make me angry--as when I trashed Juby's silly remarks
      above. </P>

    <P>IED says: &gt; In other words, Kate Bush, for the first time in modern

    <P>Let me get this straight...you're trying to tell me that you don't
      believe that ANYONE had done this before 1982???!!?!!?!?!? You're kidding
      right? Immediately three names pop into my head. Rick Wakeman. He produced
      ALL of his albums, and did a damn good job on several of them before 1982.
      You don't think Frank Zappa had achieved this state with his music before
      1982? And before 1982, Todd Rundgren had already made several albums on
      which he played ALL of the instruments, produced, mixed, engineered, wrote
      all of the lyrics &amp; music (and I might add that he even did the cover
      art on one or two of them). What else could he do? Go out on the street
      and sell it too? I'm sorry, but you can't get away with this one. I'd like
      to point out that these are just three in a list which I'm sure is quite
      long. As much as I revere her, I can't lie about it, IED...Kate was not
      the FIRST. And I'm fairly sure that I won't be the only one to explain
      this to you. Could IED please clarify his statement? (Does &quot;modern
      musical history&quot; begin in 1981, perhaps :-) </P>

      <BR> Subject: re musical alchemy </P>
    
    <P> We have a misunderstanding here. IED was trying to describe a rather
      abstract concept; he did not say Kate was &quot;the first person to
      record/perform/produce/write all her own work, for chrissake!&quot; Those
      were not IED's words. Admittedly his words were not very clear, however.
      For what it's worth, his contention was that Kate's attitude toward the
      act of making music itself was new and different, in that she was no
      longer trying to &quot;translate&quot; into relatively well-established
      terms the original music she had conceived. Instead she was trying to
      reproduce directly the ideas in her head. IED would argue that although
      others may have been the instigators of the ideas which they subsequently
      recorded/produced themselves (such as the artists you mentioned), they
      were unquestionably constrained by one of two attitudes or conditions
      which Kate Bush, with The Dreaming, was able to free herself from (to at
      least a greater degree): either </P>
    
    <P>1.) the notion that the transcendent musical conceptions originating in
      the mind are unreproduceable and can therefore only be paralleled in more
      conventional and established terms (i.e. through rock or other
      instruments, recorded and possibly &quot;treated&quot; in some way in the
      studio); or </P>
    
    <P>2.) the more common condition--that the artist's musical ideas are
      actually conceived in the conventional language of existing sound. IED
      believes that Kate's The Dreaming introduces a whole new level of alchemic
      musical creation, far beyond--as regards both scope of conception and
      thoroughness of execution--anything which either &quot;Rick Wakeman&quot;
      or &quot;Frank Zappa&quot; or &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; or any of these types
      had ever achieved before. </P>
    
    <P>Now before you get mad again, remember that IED prefaced this opinion
      yesterday with the admission that his is a personal opinion, based upon an
      admittedly obsessive and as a result exclusionary musical outlook. He does
      want it to be understood, however, that he was not contending that Kate
      was the first artist to produce her own music! ALCHEMY! That's what IED is
      talking about--ALCHEMY! </P>

    <P>[re drum-sound in KT/Gabriel:] </P>
    
    <P> Thanks very much to Duane for his corrections on this point. IED is
      definitely no Gabriel expert, and hastens to admit as much. Apropos of
      this drum-sound issue, he should mention two things. First, he got his
      (now obviously false) view of the development of the sound from an
      interview he read a year or so ago with Hugh Padgham. In it Padgham was
      complaining about how common the &quot;gated reverb&quot; drum sound had
      become in recent years, and that people seemed utterly unable or unwilling
      to develop new sounds instead, but just kept using the same old ones over
      and over. As IED recalls (perhaps inaccurately) Padgham seemed to assume
      substantial credit for the development of the sound. </P>
    
    <P>He also described the way the mikes were set up to create it, and he
      made it sound as though they had had the sound in mind before they got it,
      and not that it was a sort of inspired accident (as Gabriel apparently
      described it). Yet they were definitely both talking about the same sound,
      because Padgham also dated its development to the early PGIII sessions. He
      also said Collins was on drums when they came up with it, so Marotta would
      seem less relevant. </P>
    
    <P>The other thing IED wanted to add was that he had actually already had
      some doubts about his wording on this point in his letter to Sidgwick &amp;
      Jackson, and in the final version that he sent out he put it this way
      (still perhaps misleading, but a little less so): </P>
    
    <P>&quot;...the two artists' drum-sounds from this period. He should
      therefore also have acknowledged Phil Collins, who provided drumming on
      Gabriel's third solo LP, and Hugh Padgham, an engineer who later worked
      with Kate. These men were also instrumental in developing the distinctive
      sound in question--a sound which is in any case not at all identical to
      the drum timbres in Kate's own recordings.&quot; </P>
