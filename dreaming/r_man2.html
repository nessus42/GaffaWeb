<BR> Subject: The &quot;Rocket Man&quot; single--some opinions and suppositions

</P>
<P>Dan King is of the opinion that Kate's recording of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
is &quot;danceable&quot;,  &quot;light&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;, and that the
cover photo of Kate is therefore inappropriate because  she looks &quot;old&quot;
and &quot;sad&quot;. This opinion is remarkable to IED because it is in complete
 contrast to his own. 
</P>
<P>In IED's view Kate's version of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, in large part
because of its lilting  (but sporadic) reggae-cum-Celtic folk sections and
Kate's final, wordless minute of  vocals, seemed (at first listen as much as at
the tenth) extraordinarily poignant and  sad--an extremely sophisticated and
eloquent expression of the song's tragic subject. 
</P>
<P>By contrast, in IED's opinion, the photograph of Kate which Mercury Records
put  on the single's cover was a bit too cheerful for the tone of Kate's &quot;Rocket
Man&quot;--let  alone the even more starkly haunting &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;.
Still, even there IED  agrees with Richard Caley that the shots (there are
actually two) are  wonderful--they certainly don't make Kate appear &quot;old&quot;
to this fan. 
</P>
<P>IED suspects that they were given to Mercury by Kate and John Carder Bush 
simply as portrait photographs to be used inside the liner notes of the &quot;Two
Rooms&quot;  album. (The photo session took place more than two years ago, and
the shots are  already very familiar to fans.) Then, when Mercury decided to
release the song as a  single, they opted (perhaps because Kate would or could
not provide further artwork  on short notice?) simply to blow up the only photos
of Kate that they had been given  rights to, and use them as the cover art. 
</P>
<P>Has anyone else noticed that the typographical error (of &quot;Villean&quot;
for &quot;Uillean&quot;  pipes) in the credits for &quot;Rocket Man&quot; has
been corrected--without doubt at Kate's  request--on the outer, poster-sleeve of
the seven-inch single? The error remains on  the single's normal inside sleeve,
which we may assume was printed earlier. Does  this correction after the fact
not suggest that Mercury probably did not invite Kate to  review the cover art
before the design went to the presses; but that they made the  correction after
Kate herself saw it in the first pressings that went on sale last  month? If
this is true, perhaps Mercury did not invite Kate to suggest a cover design, 
either?

1991 02:23:04 -0800 <BR> Subject: Rocket Man Video 
</P>
<P>The clip is in black and white, so it fits the single cover. Actually her
hair is about  the same as well. I don't remember the beginning of the clip
(until the reggae part)  quite well, but I think it was Kate just alone. When
the reggae part started, the  scene is changed to Kate-with-the-band. I
recognized Del Palmer playing the bass,  and I saw another familiar face, but I
don't know all the people Kate worked with.  Maybe someone else knows? 
</P>
<P>After the Chorus, we see Kate alone again in a space helmet at the left side
of  the screen, looking to the right. In that scene they played a bit with
photographs or  something (again I can't remember quite well): the Earth is
shown and moved  around a little to express something. I'm sorry for this vague
description. 
</P>
<P>During the Chorus, the band is shown again, and in the middle of that there
is a  rude change to the next clip. 
</P>
<P>When I saw the first chorus, I found that Kate made too fanatic movements 
which didn't quite fit to the song (my opinion). During the choruses there were 
some nice shots of Kate throwing her hair in the wind (they had some wind in the
 studio!), and turning around with pointing in the air (at the end of the
chorus). 
</P>
<P>Ben.

17:00:37 -0800 <BR> Subject: Re: The &quot;Rocket Man&quot; single--some
opinions and suppositions 
</P>
<P>I got the 12&quot;, which has all three songs. Generally sounds fine to me.
Only one  picture of KaTe--on the front. Face and hands. Smile. Back cover
credits the art to  the Mercury art staff (and photo to John Carder Bush). Also
includes the &quot;Villean  Pipes&quot; misspelling. Back cover also has a very
small picture of the Two Rooms  album cover and the brief statement by KaTe
included in the booklet. (and not the  one by Sinead O'Connor ... :-)) 
</P>
<P>How do i like it? I like it just fine. Sure, you would all typecast KaTe to
sing  &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, and she does, but not in the way you would expect,
which is what i  like about the song. The reggae arrangement is interesting, and
works for me, but  it's not overdone (i.e. no deep space dub mix). 
</P>
<P>&quot;Candle In the Wind&quot; is interesting too because the instruental
backing really  doesn't follow the melody of the song, which is instead carried
by the voice. The  ambient backing vocals are particularly nice to me, but the
keyboard fills (the little  cadences similar to those used in &quot;This Woman's
Work&quot;) are trite--my only  complaint. When i first heard the CD single all
the way through, i was really  surprised at how different the instrumental
version sounded from the vocal, merely  with the subtraction of the vocals. This
instrumental is almost as interesting to me as  &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, because
it also functions well in opposition to its vocal nonidentical  twin. At first i
was reminded of Wire's &quot;It's a Boy&quot;--another song with a vastly 
different instrumental mix (but KaTe doesn't get quite so extreme). For me the 
reaction on first hearing the instrumental version was one of noticing something
that  i hadn't noticed in the vocal version because i was paying attention to
the vocal  track. I like that. 
</P>
<P>Not a major work, but a thoughtful and interesting one. 
</P>
<P>I'll also point out that KaTe didn't change the gender in &quot;Candle in
the Wind&quot;,  either. You might also want to check out Sandy Denny's cover of
&quot;Candle In the  Wind&quot;, from her 1973 album Rendezvous (reissued five
years ago by Hannibal).  Again the voice carries the melody, but the
instumentation is much more standard. 
</P>
<P>Note that the 7&quot; only has the two vocal tracks, th 12&quot; is
generally less expensive  than the CD single (i paid $7.49 versus $9.99), but do
ask to look at your copy of the  12&quot; before leaving the store. The first
store i went to had 4 copies, all of which were  messed up: two had a serious
mark on the instrumental &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; and a  third had some
junk glued in a line across the disc. The third just had some  discoloration,
which i'm told comes from putting hot vinyl into the sleeve without  letting it
cool first. The copy i eventually did get has this discoloration, and sounds 
excellent. I did make a point of getting the 12&quot; since i read here that
KaTe (or maybe  Del or maybe both) are analog freaks. Maybe we can start a
thread of record versus  CD quality for this release (also--email me--has anyone
compared record versus CD  copies of The Sensual World LP that everyone has
complained about?)

</P>
<P>It's really too bad that they didn't put this on the album instead of &quot;Rocket
Man&quot;. 
</P>
<P>It's a much better cover, IMHO. 
</P>
<P>And I would have loved to have seen the video. You-know-who in a platinum
wig,  posing in a skirt over a grate, and then tearfully waving goodbye from her
spaceship,  and maybe even throwing in a &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;-ish
cartwheel or two. 
</P>
<P>When she sang &quot;Like a Candle in the Wind&quot; she could pantomime
lighting a  candle, accidentally blowing it out, and then her tears could become
the rain...

<P>Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1991 16:07:57 -0800 <BR> From: boris@monsoon.Berkeley.EDU
(Boris Chen) <BR> Subject: Re: Candle in the Wind 
</P>
<P>Yes, Kate has released her singles, and lots of love-hound are howling.
Contrary to  the seeming majority opinion, I think that both covers (I got the 7&quot;
beauty) are  excellent. 
</P>
<P>Let me start with Candle in the Wind. There's been complaints about her
voice,  her instumentation, etc. I think that her voice is fine, as fine as it
was in the Sensual  World. She expresses all the emotion and feeling of the
sadness that the song  expresses. The instrumentation is subtle and
undominating, and furthermore  compliments Kate's voice nicely. I don't see the
sin in using synthesizers, only the  abuse of synths, and in this case, the
synths are used rather poignantly in giving the  song and overall ethereal feel.
The background vocals also compliment the main  vocal line well by enhancing the
emotional power and impact of the song -- coming  in when needed and being
absent when it ought. 
</P>
<P>As for Rocket Man, I have to agree with IED in that the song is one of
sadness.  The begining is certainly testimony to this and, though the major key
can be  deceiving, the rest of the song follows the prelude in suit. I think the
&quot;reggae&quot; beat  is an excellent idea in terms of updating this classic,
and it certainly isn't obstrusive.  It is a wonderful addition to the song, and
after hearing it, I wonder how the song  could have done without it. The way she
performs makes the song flow really well.  We get the full effect and the full
range of the climaxes and diminuation that make  the song so interesting, and so
touching. 
</P>
<P>Again, her singing is as good as it has been in recent years (though I
second the  motion that she give up smoking, since her voice is definitely more
raspy than her  younger self). I think that the ethinic instrumentation gave the
song her artistic  stamp while combining well with everything else. 
</P>
<P>About both songs, I have to say that I am glad that she covered them as she
did.  She did it in a conventional style that was not too conventional, and that
kept clear of  the cliche. The covers showed her trademark spark of inginuity,
without going  overboard in trying to be different and creative (she didn't try
geting Bulgarian  singers with helicopter sounds and weird voices in the
background). 
</P>
<P>On a final point, I'd like to say something about the cover. The cover
actually, to  me, strikes me as rather strange. She's not really smiling or
frowning, it has been  described as sad, but I think it is something that is
less easily pigeonholed. Though I  can't say what I think it conveys (it only
strikes me as disturbing, since I can't  figure it out), I think it is decent
cover for the single, though I cant say that it is one  of JC Bush's better
works. The only reason she looks old (as some say) is probably  due to the fact
that in most of her pictures, her skin is so washed out, either by  makeup or
lighting, that you don't often see though dimples on each side of her  mouth, or
the lines around her eyes. If you ever see the picture disk for This  Woman's
Work (I just got that also), you'll see the same picture (or near same)  except
with higher contrast, and thus she looks younger. The poster included with  the
7&quot; has one of her grinning slightly. And I can't help but laugh a little
every time  I see it. I can't explain why. 
</P>
<P>All in all, she did a great job. I think that these songs rank up there with
 Cloudbusting and Experiment IV, and I wait with bated breath for her soon to be
 released album.

<BR> Subject: Kate Radio 1 Interview 
</P>
<P>I've just raced over from listening to an interview with Kate on Radio 1. It
was  mostly talking about &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, of course. I recorded it and
will post a full  transcription later tonight, but for the moment, there are two
pieces of news to  impart to hungry Hounds 
</P>
<P>1) She will be performing Rocket Man on &quot;Wogan&quot; on Monday. 
</P>
<P>2) It appears that the new album will be released, quote, &quot;next year&quot;
(groan!),  perhaps in the middle or later part. She wouldn't be anymore definite
than that. She  wouldn't be drawn on what it would be like, but did say that
it's one of her quickest  (!) since she's only been working on it for the past
year. 
</P>
<P>One last thing. On the &quot;Wogan&quot; performance, there will be an empty
chair with a  guitar laid on it, in remembrance of Alan Murphy. 
</P>
<P>Keep well, Stephen

<BR> Subject: Transcription of Kate Interview 
</P>
<P>This is a transcript of an interview with Kate by BBC Radio 1. It was aired
on  Saturday 14th December, at about 3:50pm. This transcription was done by
Stephen  Thomas. The interview itself is mostly pre-recorded, as shall become
obvious. I  don't know who the interviewer was, as I never listen to Radio 1
unless it's a very  special occasion :). 
</P>
<P>K = Kate, I = Interviewer. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Don't Give Up&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Such a good track, Peter Gabriel, &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;. It was
Jonathan King who said  in one of his columns that that sort of middle verse
that Peter Gabriel sings in  that song he reckoned was one of the finest male
vocal performances of the year,  and it certainly was, and there was some pretty
good singing, too, from Kate Bush  on that, who's been keeping something of a
low profile, but how nice it is to see  Kate Bush back in the charts. She's
number 12 this week with her version of  &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, and we caught
up with her a couple of days [ago] when she was  rehearsing to perform that song
on next Monday's Terry Wogan show. And my  first question to her was how long it
had been since she'd last done a TV  appearance? 
</P>
<P>K: Oh, it must be just over two years. 
</P>
<P>I: Now, we get the feeling that you've, sort of, been hiding away from
things. 
</P>
<P>K: I don't know about hiding away, but I really only like to present myself
when  I'm working on something - it's more my work I like to present to the
world  rather than myself. I mean, I feel that it's really what people are
interested in, is  my music. So it really depends on whether I have any music
out at the time as to  whether I do any television or promotion. 
</P>
<P>I: Now you have a record out that's in the charts at the moment - we'll come
to  that in a sec. But everytime I sort of read magazines like &quot;Q&quot;, or
something, and  they say who's in the studios, it's Kate Bush, still working on
her new album  [Kate laughs softly]. I mean, is it taking longer than you'd
like, or that you  though, or what? 
</P>
<P>K: Albums always take longer than I think, and actually this is one of the
quickest  ones for years. It's not finished, but I've been working on it about a
year, and I  hope to have it finished next year. But on average, I'd say I'm
spending two to  three years on every album, and it's incredibly frustrating. I
don't know why it  takes so long - I wish it didn't, but the tracks seem to
evolve, and although it all  starts very straight-forwardly and simply, and
halfway through the album I never  know if I'm going to be able to finish it,
and it's all got too large on me [I think  - there was a burst of interference
at this point] or it starts to evolve and ends up  as whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>I: So when do you think it'll actually be released? 
</P>
<P>K: Well, next year, I would like it next year. I can't say when, because it
sort of  depends what else we want to do next year, as to whether it be, er ...
it wouldn't  be the early part of next year, but maybe middle to latter part. 
</P>
<P>I: Now, you're on this wonderful tribute album to Elton John and Bernie
Taupin,  and did you have a list of which songs were available to choose from.
How's the  choice work? 
</P>
<P>K: I was really knocked out to be asked to get involved in this project,
because I was  such a big fan of Elton's when I was little - I really loved his
stuff, he was my  biggest hero, really, and when I was just starting to write
songs he was the only  songwriter that I knew of that played the piano and sung,
and wrote songs, so he  was very much my idol. And one of my favourite songs of
his was &quot;Rocket Man&quot;.  Now, if I'd have known then that I would have
been asked to be involved in this  project, I think I would have just died! And
in some ways, I owe it to myself, as  that little girl to give her the
priviledge of doing this as well as myself now. And  they basically said, would
we like to be involved and I could choose which track I  wanted, and because &quot;Rocket
Man&quot; was my favourite I hoped it hadn't gone,  actually - I hoped no-one
else was going to do it. 
</P>
<P>I: And what about the arrangement of it, which is very different to the
original. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, yes I suppose so. I actually haven't heard the original for a very
long time, a  long long time! [laughs] And it was just I wanted to do it
differently; I do think if  you cover records, you should try and make them
different - it's like remaking  movies, you've got to try and give it something
that makes it worth re-releasing.  And the reggae treatment just seemed to
happen, really. I just tried to put the  chords together on the piano, and it
just seemed to want to take off in the  choruses, so we gave it the reggae
treatment. 
</P>
<P>I: And now, all of a sudden, it's a hit single. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, yes, and it's even more extraordinary, because we actually recorded
the  track over two years ago, probably just after my last telly appearance! And
we  were quite astounded when they wanted to release it as a single just
recently.  What's very nice is that the guitarist that played on the track, Alan
Murphy, who  was our guitarist at the time, died not long after the track was
made. So this was  one of the last things that he did with us, and it's
particularly nice for me to feel  that it's not only keeping him alive, but I
know that he would be really thrilled to  know it was doing so well, and it's
nice for all of us that loved Al to know that he  can be a part of this now. 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Rocket Man&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>I: Now, there's been an awful lot of change has gone on in the world - I'm
not  talking about the world of music - over the last couple of years, since
your last  album. Is this changed you [sic] as well? Will this mean the next
Kate Bush  album will be very different from the last one, do you think? 
</P>
<P>K: I think you're absolutely right. I think there's been so much change in
the world  in this two year period. Everyone I know has been changed by it, it's
impossible  not to. If you don't change with it, I don't think you could survive
it. Everyone's  changed, I've definitely changed. I've been very affected by
these last two years;  they've been incredibly intense years for me. Maybe not
on a work level, but a  lot has happened to me. I feel I've learnt a lot. And I
think yes, I think this  album is going to be quite different. Yeah, I do. 
</P>
<P>I: Can you give us any other clues, as to ...? 
</P>
<P>K: It's impossible, I think, to talk about music, especially before it's
completed or  people have heard it, because it's a very personal interpretation.
For me, it's like  a painting. You would never talk about a painting before
you've seen it. It's only  when you see the painting, you then talk about it.
So, I really hope that people  like it, I hope the people that are waiting for
it feel it's worth the wait and I  really hope people out there like it. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, it's going to be lovely to actually see you on the Wogan show on
Monday, so  lot's of luck with that. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, thank you very much. It's really nice to be here and to be back,
and I  would just like to say thank you to everyone who's received this single
so  warmly. It means a lot to me, you know, I didn't think I'd have a single out
for  at least a year because we're still working on the album, so it's a very
nice  surprise, and I've had such nice feedback about all levels to do with
this, so  thank you very much, everyone, and have a great Christmas! 
</P>
<P>[&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is played] 
</P>
<P>[The interview proper stops after that, but makes some comments about
meeting  Kate that are interesting ...] 
</P>
<P>I: Kate Bush, and &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. And Phil Ross, the
producer of this  programme, and I were just in this tiny little dressing room
at TV Centre when  Kate was rehearsing for Monday's Wogan show, and we were
slurping cups of  tea together. We were only there for about ten minutes, and
Thursday was just  this manic day of running around and doing all sorts of
different stuff, but walked  out of the dressing room after spending ten minutes
in the company of Kate Bush  just feeling so good! She's one of those people,
you know, that you meet and she  makes you feel great. Certainly one of the
special people, and I look forward to  next year, whenever the album comes out -
she wouldn't be any more specific  than it'll be next year. And I'm sure she'll
be our guest on the programme to  introduce tracks from the album when it does
come out. And don't miss the  Wogan show on Monday, see Kate Bush singing &quot;Rocket
Man&quot;, and you will see  on set, I believe, an empty chair with just a
guitar placed on it, and that's the  chair that Alan Murphy would have sat in.

album'...I  mean, is it taking longer than you'd like, or than you thought? 
</P>
<P>K: Albums always take longer than I think...and, actually, this is one of
the quickest  ones for years...it's not finished, but I've been working on it
for about a year,  and I hope to have it finished next year, but on average I'd
say that I'm spending  2-3 years on each album, and it's incredibly frustrating.
I don't know why it  takes so long - I wish it didn't - the tracks seem to
evolve, and although it all  starts very straightforwardly, and simply, halfway
through the album I never  know whether I'm going to finish it, and it's all got
too big for me, and then it  starts to evolve and ends up as whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>I: So when do you think it'll actually be released? 
</P>
<P>K: Well...next year, I can't say when because it depends what else we want
to do  next year. It wouldn't be the early part, but maybe the middle to latter
part. 
</P>
<P>I: Now you're on this tribute album to Elton John and Bernie Taupin...did
you have  a list of which songs were available to choose from?... how did the
choice work? 
</P>
<P>K: I was really knocked out to be asked to get involved in this project,
because I was  a big fan of Eltons when I was little, I really loved his
stuff...he was my biggest  hero, really. When I was just starting to write
songs, he was the only songwriter  that I knew of that played the piano, and
sung, and wrote songs, so he was very  much my idol, and one of my favourite
songs was 'Rocket Man'...Now, if I7d  have known then that I'd be asked to be
involved in this project, then I think I  would have just died - in some ways I
owe it to myself as that little girl to give her  the privilege of doing this as
well as for myself now. They basically said, would  we like to be involved and I
could choose which track I wanted, and because  'Rocket Man' was my favourite, I
hoped it hadn't gone actually, I hoped no-one  else was going to do it. 
</P>
<P>I: And what about the arrangement of it, which is very different to the
original? 
</P>
<P>K: Um...well, yes, I suppose so, I actually haven't heard the original for a
very long  time...a long, long time..(laughs)..and I wanted to do it
differently, I do think that  if you cover records you should try and make them
different, it's like remaking  movies..you've got to give it something that
makes it worth rereleasing. The  reggae treatment just seemed to happen really,
I just tried to put the chords  together on the piano and they just seemed to
want to take off in the choruses so  we gave it a sort of reggae treatment. 
</P>
<P>I: And now all of a sudden it's a hit single. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, yes, and it's even more extraordinary because we recorded the track
over  two years ago...probably just after my last telly appearance, and we were
quite  astounded when they wanted to release it as a single just recently. The
guitarist  who played on the track, Alan Murphy, died not long after the track
was made,  so this was one of the last things he did with us, and it's
particularly nice for me  to feel that it's not only keeping him alive, but I
know that he would be really  thrilled to know that it was doing so well, and
it's nice for all of us that loved Al  to know that he can be a part of this
now. 
</P>
<P>(Rocket Man is played.) 
</P>
<P>I: Now, there's been an awful lot of change has gone on in the world - I'm
not  talking about the world of music - over the last couple of years, since
your last  album - has this changed you as well...will this mean that the next
Kate Bush  album will be very different from the last one? 
</P>
<P>K: Um...I think you're absolutely right, there's been so much change in the
world  in this two-year period, everyone I know has been changed by it - it's
impossible  not to, if you don't change with it, I don't think you could survive
it. Everyone's  changed - I've definitely changed, I've been very affected by
these last two  years, they've been an incredibly intense two years for me,
maybe not on a work  level, but - a lot has happened to me, I feel I've learnt a
lot. And yes - I think  this album is going to be quite different. Yeah, I do. 
</P>
<P>I: Can you give us any other clues as to...er.. 
</P>
<P>K: Er..it's always very..it's impossible, I think, to talk about music,
especially before  it's completed or people have heard it, because it's a very
personal interpretation  ; for me it's like a painting - you would never talk
about a painting before  you've seen it, it's only when you see it you talk
about it..er, I really hope that  people like it, I hope the people that are
waiting for it feel it's worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>I: Well, it's going to be lovely to see you on the Wogan show on Monday, so
lots of  luck with it. 
</P>
<P>K: Well, thank you very much, it's really nice to be here and to be back and
I would  just like to say thankyou to everyone who's received the single so
warmly, it  means a lot to me, I didn't think I'd have a single out for at least
a year, because  we're still working on the album, so it's a very nice surprise.
I've had such nice  feedback to do with all levels of this, so thank you very
much everyone, and have  a great Christmas. 
</P>
<P>(Running Up That Hill is played.)

Subject: Re: KATE ON WOGAN? 
</P>
<P>Well, I'd have thought someone else would have posted by now, but... 
</P>
<P>She looked quite good! I thought it was quite a simple performance, and I
think it  was lip-synched. Apart from herself, there was three other people on
state - Del, on  bass, Charlie Morgan (I presume?) on drums, and someone else
(?) playing a  small-accordian. Kate herself was playing what for the sake of
argument shall be  called a Eukalele :-). There was also a chair at the back
with a guitar on it ... Alan  Murphy's symbolic presence. 
</P>
<P>She was wearing a black velvet two-piece suit, the skirt of which came to
just  below the knee. The top was quite low cut - not as low cut as her outfit
in the  Hammer Horror video, but getting that way! As is normal, she *oozed*
femeninity  (sp??) from every pore (some would say sexuality, but I prefer
femeninity :-). 
</P>
<P>The performance itself was grand, if I'm any judge, but I did think that
maybe,  just maybe, she didn't look quite as fresh-faced as she used to. Her
hair, btw, was  ... um ... artistically disarranged. I haven't managed to see
the video yet, so I can't  compare the performance to that. 
</P>
<P>I was watching it with a friend who happens to be more an Elton John than
Kate  Bush fan, and she liked it. She thought the reggae treatment worked quite
well, and  all in all, it was a good cover. 
</P>
<P>Keep well, Stephen

08:00:47 -0800 <BR> Subject: Kate on Wogan 
</P>
<P>The &quot;Rocket Man&quot; set on Wogan was pretty much the same as the band
scenes in  the RM video, except that Davey Spillane and his Uillean pipes
weren't there. I  would have thought that they could have got somebody to stand
in for him - I'm  sure Paddy could have done as convincing a performance on the
pipes as he did with  the cello at the '86 BPI awards....8^) (he could've worn
one of his funny hats too!) 
</P>
<P>Predictably, the set was dark with an unconvincing starry background and
lots of  tinfoil round the edges. The photographic direction was pretty lousy,
given that it  was almost certainly a pre-recorded performance. KaTe didn't seem
quite as  relaxed as I've seen her before, neither did Alistair Anderson (the
concertinist). Del  and Charlie (I think it looked like Charlie) seemed to be
enjoying themselves though  - when the Uillean pipes started, Del looked as if
he was going to break into an Irish  jig! 
</P>
<P>As Stephen describes, Kate was wearing a dark skirt suit (as in the video)
but  this time wearing tights and high heels. She wiggled her way through the
choruses  again, but this time a bit slower, which seemed to match the music
better. She also  seemed to strum her toy guitar/ukelele in time to the music,
something she didn't  quite achieve in the video 8^) 
</P>
<P>They were faded out after about 4 minutes. Can't a 5 minute single get
played in  its entirity *anywhere*?

<P>Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1991 01:30:33 -0800 <BR> From:
stevev@greylady.uoregon.edu (Steve VanDevender) <BR> Subject: Rocket Man 
</P>
<P>I have finally been able to listen to Kate's cover of &quot;Rocket Man&quot;
and study it in  detail. 
</P>
<P>It passes two important tests: I got the tingly feeling the first few times
I listened  to it, and I not only can stand to listen to it over and over again,
but really want to. 
</P>
<P>There has been some argument lately over whether Kate's cover of &quot;Rocket
 Man&quot; communicates the overall feeling of sadness that some people are
saying is  fundamental to the song. I think that these people are missing the
true genius of  Kate's interpretation, whether they say the song successfully
communicates a feeling  of sadness or that its seemingly light-hearted melody is
at odds with the sad tone  they think the lyric requires. In that Kate does
successfully evoke sadness when she  thinks the song requires it, the first
group is right; however, they do not discuss the  ways in which the song
communicates joy, and the opposing threads of joy and  sadness that run through
the song. Kate's interpretation of the song disappoints  those who think it
should be sad throughout, but I consider her interpretation more  balanced and
realistic, as well as artistically more interesting. 
</P>
<P>She packed my bag last night, pre-flight <BR> Zero hour, nine AM  <BR> I'm
gonna be high as a kite by then
</P>
<P> I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife  <BR> It's lonely out in space 
<BR> On such a timeless flight 
</P>
<P>The first two verses of the song are accompanied by somber, sparse music,
and  sung with a corresponding sense of wistfulness. They frame a period prior
to the  Rocket Man's flight, a time when he is apparently feeling anxious, and
anticipating  the unpleasant aspects of his trip. However, note that he says
that he will be &quot;high as  a kite&quot; during the actual launch--a phrase
usually used to indicate a feeling of  intense joy. 
</P>
<P>[Chorus:] 
</P>
<P>And I think it's gonna be a long, long time  <BR> Til touchdown brings me
round again to find  <BR> I'm not the man they think I am at home  <BR> Oh no
no no  <BR> I'm a Rocket Man 
</P>
<P> Rocket Man  <BR> Burning out his fuse  <BR> Up here alone 
</P>
<P>The chorus is introduced with a change of the musical accompaniment--the 
music becomes more upbeat and has the controversial reggae beat. Kate's vocals 
here are also stronger and happier, and they reflect the joy that the Rocket Man
 feels in his job--a joy tinged by his loneliness, which Kate also expresses
deftly. 
</P>
<P>Mars ain't the kind of place to raise the kids  <BR> In fact, it's cold as
hell  <BR> And there's no one there to raise them  <BR> If you did 
</P>
<P> And all this science, I don't understand  <BR> It's just my job five days
a week  <BR> A Rocket Man  <BR> Rocket Man 
</P>
<P>These verses return to a more somber tone, and they reflect the isolation
and  harshness of space, and the times when the Rocket Man feels only the
boredom of  his duty. 
</P>
<P>The final choruses, and the closing vocals of the song, continue to waver
between  joy and sadness, and emphasize the aspect of &quot;a long, long time.&quot;
In particular, the  wordless vocals at the end express this combination of joy
and longing perfectly. 
</P>
<P>To me, Kate's version of &quot;Rocket Man&quot; is not intended to be purely
a song of  sadness--it instead tries to communicate the entire emotional
experience of this  rocket pilot. He is anxious in preparing for a launch,
exhilarated by the launch and  the beauty of space, depressed by the tedium and
isolation of the journey. When in  space, he misses his home and family--and
after touchdown, he misses the grandeur  of spaceflight.

Subject: Rocketman Video hoax = interpretation 
</P>
<P>I posted this some weeks ago and everyone yawned. Chris figures we burned up
 our credibility with the hoaxing-glut. For those who haven't seen the real
video, I  think this plays better in the mind's eye, and offers a view of the
sad/happy  complementarity. (The Marcus Garvey trap was so that someone else
would make  the Neuromancer connection-- a spaceship full o' dreads smoking
ganja...) 
</P>
<P>When C&amp;V got their PAL player hooked up last month, one happy discovery
was  a few extra minutes of footage from the VH-1 special, on the PAL cassette 
(autographed!) I won at the Kon last year. 
</P>
<P>But over the weekend Chris noticed that the PAL case was engineered oddly, 
allowing it to be *flipped*, and on the &quot;B&quot; side was... 
</P>
<P>A ROCKET MAN VIDEO!!! 
</P>
<P>It looks like a rough cut, or maybe just an animated storyboard-- the FX are
 *really* cheap. 
</P>
<P>It opens with a closeup of Kate's sad face in comic Elton-goggles, framed in
a  space helmet, lip-syncing, zooming out to show she's suited up and strapped
inside a  capsule. There are stars outside the window, and many cute little
decorations in the  interior that we'll have to look at single-frame to
identify. (There's definitely a  videoscreen with a Fresnel overlay, though!) 
</P>
<P>When she sings &quot;high as a kite by then&quot; a spaceship floats past
the window, the  name readable as &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot; (???) 
</P>
<P>She's sad again, but they dock, and as she boards their ship, there are Gary
and  Stewart (and the band in the background, as the reggae kicks in) all in 
dreadlock-wigs! And they're partying, and she tries to join in, and dances kind
of  half-heartedly, still looking sad, and silly in those goggles. 
</P>
<P>The 'dreads' are funny and try to cheer her up, and she almost gets into it,
but  then as &quot;burnin out his fuse up here alone&quot; sounds, the ship
vanishes and she's  floating in a vast field of stars (even as cheesy as it
looks, you can feel the awe). 
</P>
<P>But then the dreads come floating up to her in patchwork spacesuits too, 
boogie-ing in the emptiness, and she tries to resist again but gets swept up,
finally  cracks a smile, starts to wriggle like Barbarella (!) or something, and
then there's  the second strum, and they all freeze, looking at her,
expectantly, waiting as she  sings a couple more sad lines, but then she
notices, and grins slyly and starts wiggling  again, and there's a series of
cuts showing different dreads doing silly things in space  as the music fades.
(Watch for Paddy!) 
</P>
<P>So what is this, dreads in space? Is it about &quot;getting high&quot;? And
why Marcus  Garvey??? (Why does this sound so familiar?) 
</P>
<P>Anyway, Chris has the tape down in KC today, dubbing it to NTSC, so confirm 
with your immediate pyramid-superior about sending a blank tape, and you should 
all have a copies RSN.

</P>
<P>To me, &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; was the pinnacle of Elton John. His
greatest  achievement and contribution. His reason for existence. KaTe has taken
the song to a  new height of emotion, and pain, and suffering. Gone are the
flashy dynamics and  percussion, and gone are the stark background vocals. Yet
what remains in its  simplicity was a deep anguish and longing which touched me.
Could she have done  better ? Is it only B-side quality ? I don't know. But I've
open my heart as well as  my ears, and I let KaTe fill me with emotion ...

 wiggled and strummed her way through the choruses with her ukelele(?), but a

PDT <BR> Subject: ELTON JOHN Candle In The Wind/Rocket Man quotes 
</P>
<P>I wrote to the Elton John mailing list and asked if anyone could provide any
 quotes from Elton/Bernie about Rocket Man and Candle in the Wind. A nice fellow
 named Ron McBay sent me these. 
</P>
<P>RE: CANDLE IN THE WIND 
</P>
<P>(From the TWO ROOMS book) - BERNIE: I never get tired of hearing &quot;Candle
 In The Wind.&quot; There are some of our songs that are the perfect mesh of
lyric and  melody and I think &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; is one of them. The
only thing that  bothers me about the song is that as a result people tend to
think that I have a  raging obsession with Marilyn Monroe which was not the
point of the song. The  point of the song was how the media distorts people's
lives. It's a bit like &quot;Daniel,&quot;  people are not left alone, and
that's really what &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; was about.  It's a song about
media abuse. How we abuse the living, how we abuse the dead.  I'm not saying she
wasn't talented, but sometimes it pays to die -- that's what that  song's about.

</P>
<P>(From THE MANY LIVES OF ELTON JOHN book) - ELTON: It was so hard to  record.
The only way I recorded that in the end is that we put the piano on  afterward.
It was the first vocal I'd ever recorded standing up, and after that the  piano,
guitar, drums were put on. It was such a hard song to do because it's not a 
typical piano number and I actually sang the number leaping around the
microphone  and going crazy. 
</P>
<P>(From the ELTON JOHN biography) - BERNIE: I wanted to say that it wasn't 
just a sex thing. That she was someone everybody could fall in love with,
without her  being out of reach. 
</P>
<P>(From same) - ELTON: When I think of Marilyn, I just think of pain. I can't
ever  imagine her being that happy. 
</P>
<P>RE: ROCKET MAN 
</P>
<P>(From the ELTON JOHN biography) - BERNIE: The words just came into my  head:
&quot;She packed my bags last night, pre-flight. Zero-hour is nine am.&quot; I
remember  jumping out of the car and running into my parents' house, shouting, &quot;Please
don't  anyone talk to me until I've written this down.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(From same) - When asked whether they stole &quot;Rocket Man&quot; from
David  Bowie's &quot;Space Oddity,&quot; BERNIE: Oh no. We didn't steal that one
from Bowie. We  stole it from another bloke, called Tom Rapp [leader of the
American cult band,  Pearls Before Swine, who had released an earlier song also
called &quot;Rocket Man.&quot;]

has a  TV performance of Kate doing Candle In the Wind. IED couldn't find the
guys  number. Now, I don't think this is likely, as a matter a fact I find it
extremely  Unlikely that she could do this and not have any of us know about it,
but I though  I'd mention it. Odds are it's probably the &quot;Wogan&quot;
