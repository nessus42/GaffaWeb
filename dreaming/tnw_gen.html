Hsu) <BR> Subject: Ophelia
</P>
<P>Really-from: Bill Hsu 
</P>
<P>Someone (Sue?) brought up a reviewer's comment about Kate Bush &quot;playing
 Ophelia to her own Hamlet&quot;. The remark is not completely inappropriate,
but it  seems a typical line from people who feel that Kate's music is too &quot;artsy&quot;
or  pretentious (of course the same complaint can be made about the reviewer who
 made the original remark :-) ). 
</P>
<P>In Hamlet, Ophelia drowned herself after being ignored by Hamlet and getting
 the news that Hamlet had killed Ophelia's father (by mistake). I guess you
could  make the connection to Kate's songs about unrequited love (All the Love,
etc) and  emotionally abused women (The Kick Inside, Get Out of My House). And
of course  the Ninth Wave was about drowning. The reviewer probably has the
stereotyped  view of Kate Bush being an over-romantic songstress trying to write
art music  rather than the multi-faceted and complex talent she is. 
</P>
<P>Of course I don't mind Kate's occasional pretensions. Heck, it's fun being 
pretentious...! :-)

Subject: a Ninth Wave and Ulysses
</P>
<P>Stop me if someone has said this before, but in James Joyce's Ulysses, in
Chapter  3 (Proteus), the following sentences appear (we are in the mind of
Stephen Dedalus,  who is watching a dog on the beach south of Dublin): 
</P>
<P>`At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs,
seawardpointed ears.  His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of
seamorse. They serpented towards  his feet, curling, unfurling many crests,
every ninth, breakingaa, plashing, from far,  from farther out, waves and
waves.' 
</P>
<P>Don Gifford, in his excellent Notes for Joyce, provides the following gloss:

</P>
<P>` every ninth -- i.e., wave, after the belief that every  ninth wave is
larger than  the other waves of a sequence.' 
</P>
<P>Kate had obviously heard this piece of (Irish?) folklore, but might she also
have  had this particular passage in mind? Does anyone know of any other Joycean
 references in Kate's work? 
</P>
<P>[There is a definite Joycean reference in the lyrics to Kate's song &quot;My
Lagan  Love&quot;. It is based on a story by  James Joyce. Kate didn't write the
lyrics to the song,  however. Her brother John did. Kate says that she got the
title to *The Ninth Wave*  by looking through a quote dictionary for something
appropriate and found the  quoted passage by Tennyson. I don't know whether she
knew of the Joyce's  passage. -- |&gt;oug ]

<P>Date: Tue, 12 Jan 88 01:05 PST <BR> From: IED0DXM@OAC.UCLA.EDU <BR>
Subject: Ophelia
</P>
<P>Though many of you may already have taken notice of the following on your
own,  IED has been so taken with these ideas that he felt he just had to mention
them  anyway. 
</P>
<P>The whole conceit of the heroine drifting in water refers to far more than
just  the explicit, immediate context of The Ninth Wave. In fact, the implicit
references  are so deliberate that they may arguably be more important than the
explicit  subject-matter. Actually, at least three earlier such subjects loom in
the collective  English consciousness. All of them have important positions in
British cultural  history. 
</P>
<P>Of these the best known outside England is the story of Ophelia in Hamlet.
The  allusion to Ophelia's insane self-immersion is plain to see in the photo
for The  Ninth Wave: the flowers. These were explained away almost flippantly by
(if IED  remembers correctly -- Doug, will you confirm or deny, since you were
there too?)  John Carder Bush as being intended to show the chaos and damage on
board the  ship during its sinking (or whatever ultimately forced the heroine
into the ocean).  The idea was supposed to be that commercially cultivated
flowers, perhaps in the  hands of the heroine at the time of the disaster,
perhaps thrown by happenstance  into the water from a dining table flower
arrangement during the commotion and  sinking, have happened to end up floating
in the very same waves in which the  heroine finds herself engulfed. 
</P>
<P>This explanation has always struck IED as suspiciously superficial -- not to
 mention implausible. The image of a beautiful young Englishwoman floating on
her  back in a cold, deathly state, dressed in a white lace nightie and set
adrift amid exotic  and colourful flowers has, since the seventeenth-century
premiere of Hamlet, been  inextricably connected with the fate of Ophelia. 
</P>
<P>In fact, the image of Ophelia in the water is a relatively modern variant on
the  Arthurian images of both Elaine and the Lady of Shalott. These two earlier
legends  feature their heroines floating downstream in open boats (in which they
eventually  are found dead). This image, in fact, was reproduced precisely by
Kate herself in  what was virtually her debut on video, the so-called Eftelink
films, specifically the  last of the six, a setting of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;.
The reader will begin to see the extent  of the convolutions involved; see, in
fact, a multitude of wheels within wheels, and all  of impeccably, classically
English origin. 
</P>
<P>But the images are not only associated with the word, but with English
paintings,  as well, and these are predominantly Victorian. The most famous of
all of these  pictures, and possibly the single greatest image of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement, is  &quot;Ophelia&quot;, by John Everett Millais
(1852). Kate is definitely very familiar with the  painting; her brother
confirmed as much in conversation with IED at East Wickham  Farm in 1985. At the
time this point made littel impression on IED, but since then it  has come to
take on increasing importance in his fevered brain... 
</P>
<P>During that conversation IED and JCB discussed the connection of the &quot;Lakeside&quot;
 images (photographs taken by Jay of his sister sitting and stretching by the
banks of  the river or lake which appears in the Eftelink videos) with
Pre-Raphaelite imagery.  We also talked about the famous post-Pre-Raphaelite
painting (in the Tate Gallery)  of the Lady of Shalott, by John William
Waterhouse. There are at least four other  very familiar paintings of about the
same date which depict episodes from the  legend of the Lady of Shalott, and
which were inspired by a poetic setting of the  legend in...Tennyson's Idylls of
the King. (More wheels ...) IED has been  purposelessly musing on all of this,
mulling over also Kate's own comments about  the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism
on her own artistic vocabulary (see quote No. 1) as  well as the large painting,
called &quot;The Hogsmill Ophelia&quot;, which hangs in her studio  (see quote
No. 2). And the more familiar he becomes with the images and the  references,
the more sense it all makes. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>Quote Number 1: 
</P>
<P>NM: I'm reminded by a painting in the corner here, which is a sort of satire
of a  Pre-Raphaelite painting, that I always have thought that those Victorian
painters, the  Pre-Raphaelites, were an influence to the texture of your song
writing. 
</P>
<P>KB: Yes, yes. I think that particularly in my very early teens I was very
enchanted  by the whole romance of it, yes. They find their way into songs, the
imagery. I think  that's what happens: something attracts you because of its
imagery and you digest it  and it comes up in a song. I think that's how artists
work; they are like magpies,  picking up little bits of gold and storing them
away. 
</P>
<P>Quote No. 2: 
</P>
<P>At one end of the studio is a huge painting of a drowned, cracked doll
floating  face up past a sewer. For some reason this painting, which might be
described as  macabre-kitsch, seems to say a lot about its owner. Kate returns
and sees me  examining it. 
</P>
<P>&quot;That's called 'The Hogsmill Ophelia'. A lot of people find it
disturbing but I  don't. I lived with it for ages. Looked at it every day. That
picture cost me all the  money I had once. Paintings are a great inspiration.
One of my favourites is by  Millais, 'The Huguenot'. It's of a man going off to
the wars being hugged to the  breast of his lover. She's holding him to her by a
scarf around his arm. It's very  beautiful.&quot;

<P>Date: 14 Sep 88 18:48:43 GMT <BR> From: blblbl!henrik@GAFFA.MIT.EDU (Larry
DeLuca) <BR> Subject: survival of the protagonist? 
</P>
<P>&gt; From: |&gt;oug: <BR> &gt; ... then we hear the submarine coming to
rescue Kate ... 
</P>
<P>I'm sorry - I just can't buy that interpretation. I think she's doomed to
die from  the start. As far as my reasons go, let me start with the transition
from Hello Earth  to Morning Fog, and then go over the rest of the piece to
substantiate my viewpoint  further. 
</P>
<P>We do in fact hear the sonar at the end of Hello, Earth, but we hear it in
And  Dream of Sheep as well. Each time it's used, the lyrics indicate that we
are moving  deeper into the death state (or unconsciousness) and away from the
life state. In the  case of Hello, Earth: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Deeper, deeper, somewhere in the depths, there is a light.&quot; 
</P>
<P>During the course of the song, things grow gradually softer. We are lulled
into a  final sleep, like a leaf drifting downward, or some object slowly
sinking into water.  The last thing we hear is a bit of a muffled seagull, and
the line: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Go to sleep Little Earth&quot; 
</P>
<P>and then we fade. Suddenly, the very sharp attack (along with a greatly
increased  volume level) of Morning Fog starts. The words to Morning Fog also
imply that a  metamporphosis has taken place, and a fairly specific one at that:

</P>
<P>I am falling <BR> like a stone <BR> like a storm <BR> being born again
<BR> into the sweet morning fog 
</P>
<P>In this passage the life of the &quot;storm&quot; is over, it has changed
into something else,  and is going to continue on with its existance. It would
seem a rescue would imply a  more gradual recovering of consciousness, and
certainly a return to the previous  state. The storm chaning to fog, however,
also implies the fight against the  environment being given up and succumbing to
becoming part of it. It's a wonderful  image. 
</P>
<P>Second, we mention the light again - implying that the light is an important
 figure in the transition. Certainly, in &quot;the depths&quot; (be they the
depths of the ocean or  the depths of unconsciousness - but I'll get to that in
a minute) there isn't much  light at all - so perhaps the light is the doorway
to another place. 
</P>
<P>The light <BR> Begin to bleed, <BR> Begin to breathe, <BR> Begin to speak

</P>
<P>Images of birth -- while rescue is a possibility, it would make it a much
weaker  statement. The &quot;light&quot; that was identified as the speaker lost
consciousness for the  last time in Hello Earth clearly led somewhere (into The
Morning Fog ). I would  place the exact moment of &quot;death&quot; at the
juncture between the two pieces. 
</P>
<P>Further, the line &quot;I'm falling / And I'd love to hold you now&quot; is
in the  subjunctive -- implying that for some reason she *can't* hold the person
she's  talking to. 
</P>
<P>Now, as far as an overview of the entire piece (mind you, from my own 
perspective). It's a time-compression - a mixture of hallucinations and reality
as the  speaker drifts in and out of consciuosness (the reader is referred to &quot;Occurance
at  Owl Creek Bridge&quot; by Ambrose Bierce for another example of this method
of telling  a story). 
</P>
<P>Starting at the present, with And Dream of Sheep. We encounter the leading 
character treading water, hoping for rescue. It's late, it's cold, she's tired.
Starting  to drift in and out a bit: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Let me be weak, let me sleep, and dream of sheep&quot; 
</P>
<P>The recurring images of shifting alertness like &quot;I'll wake up to any
sound of  engines / every gull a seeking craft&quot; - reassurance that she
won't, in fact, drift too  deep into sleep and drown. The gull here is one of
the first effects we hear, again  implying that attention is more easily shifted
- (anyone who's driven too many hours  on a rainy night can appreciate this one,
I think). 
</P>
<P>&quot;They take me deeper and deeper&quot; 
</P>
<P>As she drifts off into the first hallucination, in the strings we hear the
first rescue  boats in the water. However, the leading character's mind is
remembering the  incident that caused her to end up there in the first place.
(Her seeing herself  precludes this actually happening in the present). 
</P>
<P>At this point, most likely the rescuer voices are real, coming in from far
away as  they do - those little bits of consciousness that creep in even when
you're asleep or  drifting. 
</P>
<P>Next, we have the &quot;Wake up&quot; section. while it is possible that the
leading  character is actually dragged up onto the beach at this point (I still
consider it a  possibility), the theory I currently prefer is that the lines are
the conscious mind  attempting to push through the haze again). The series of &quot;Wake
up&quot;, and &quot;Wake up  love&quot; lines could plausibly have been spoken
and filtered through the unconscious,  but the other lines, like &quot;Pay
Attention&quot;, &quot;See that little light over there&quot;, &quot;Over  here&quot;,
and &quot;Look who's here to see you&quot; that clearly are not taking place in
the  present and are most likely drawn from experiences, knowledge, and lore
that are  the province of the leading character (certainly the &quot;See the
light ...&quot; dialogue is the  temptation to give in and die). In any event,
the broken-up voice that starts Waking  the Witch reminds me very strongly of
the near-drowning experience I had as a  small child -- bobbing up and down in
the water desperately struggling for breath  and trying to scream for help
sounded a lot like that, and is part of what makes  Waking the Witch so chilling
for me. 
</P>
<P>As everyone I am sure will recall, there were a series of &quot;tests&quot;
to determine if  one was, in fact, a witch. It was believed that every witch had
a spot on their body  which proved they were a witch because if it was stabbed
with a needle no blood  would come forth (&quot;You won't bleed&quot;). Another
common test was to submerge the  would-be witch in a well. If the water &quot;accepted&quot;
her (she sank) she was not a  witch. If the water &quot;rejected&quot; her (she
floated) clearly she was a witch since wood  floated -&gt; wood was lighter than
water -&gt; witches floated -&gt; witches were made of  wood (how do you argue
with logic like that). 
</P>
<P>Note that our &quot;witch-hunter&quot; is the same voice that encouraged the
leading  character toward the &quot;light&quot; in the earlier passage of the
song (the last &quot;Over here&quot;).  Now encouraging her further into the &quot;depths&quot;
- &quot;Wings in the water - Go down&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Again, the metaphor of the depths doesn't necessarily imply that she's
literally  sinking, but losing the battle. 
</P>
<P>The helicopter and the &quot;Get out of the waves&quot;, &quot;get out of
the water&quot; imply our  rescue party giving up -- &quot;the waves&quot;
further suggests stormy seas - perhaps there  is a large storm coming and they
have to cut their losses. 
</P>
<P>Watching You Without Me - the lyrics are pretty straightforward -nice use of
the  muffler at the beginning to imply that it's more like voices on the wind -
the  suggestion of presence instead of the actuality of it. The only sounds we
hear are  nautical ones - the morse-code SOS after the second verse of the song,
the rolling  waves, the seagulls. We haven't really left the beach at all, as
our auditory cues tell  us, it's just the mind drifting again. 
</P>
<P>The mind shifts again, and the leading character's mind makes one last bid
for  survival - herself as an old woman confronting her present self. &quot;I
put this moment  here. I put this moment here. I put this moment *over here*&quot;
- the last *over here*  is a voice from earlier on in Waking the Witch - the
voice that attempted to lull her  away before, and is having more success now.
The lines of the poem following imply  further temptation to give in and follow.

</P>
<P>&quot;A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land &quot; 
</P>
<P>The kiss of death... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Waiting for them when the life-spray cools&quot; 
</P>
<P>pretty obvious. 
</P>
<P>Hello Earth - as our leading character drifts further away from life, she
becomes  more passive. The descision point was at the end of Jig of Life. Now we
drift  downward, accepting fate. The cue that there isn't a whole lot of time
passing  between this and Waking the Witch are the second set of rescuer's
commands to  &quot;Get out of the waves, get out of the water&quot;. People are
called home, the search over.  The leading character also doesn't ask for help
any more &quot;All you fishermen / head  for home / Go to sleep little earth&quot;.

</P>
<P>The rest of the analytical trail picks up at the beginning of the article. 
</P>
<P>One alternative interpretation I've considered is that during the &quot;Wake
up&quot;  section and preceding it, the leading character is dragged out of the
water and the  more sensible &quot;wake up&quot;'s come from the rescuers.
However, there is less founding  for this in the rest of the music.

<P>Date: Sat, 24 Sep 88 23:57 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: A visit with two Irish
musicians (Donal Lunny and Liam O'Flynn) 
</P>
<P> IED just returned from the debut West Coast concert by Donal Lunny and Liam
 O'Flynn. The concert was only about seventy-five minutes of actual music, but
the  quality was breathtaking, and above all the musical authenticity was
absolute. They  emphasized reels, jigs and hornpipes, and played only three slow
airs all night, which  to this novice of Irish music was something of a
disappointment. But overall, 'twas a  truly grand evenin'. 
</P>
<P>After attending the concert, and after waiting without result for some time 
afterward outside the musicians' practice room while the audience for the second
 show filed in and began getting impatient, IED decided it was time to be
obnoxious  and just barge in...so he knocked timidly. Donal (who plays bouzouki
and guitar)  said yes, come in, though &quot;we are a bit preoccupied.&quot;
Which didn't exactly put your  Love-Hounds KorrespondenT at ease; but he pressed
on. 
</P>
<P>When they heard the name &quot;Kate Bush&quot; spout from IED's lips,
however, they  relaxed visibly and became quite friendly -- expansive, even. 
</P>
<P>[Question about <A HREF="td_nots.html">Night of the Swallow</A>, see
<A HREF="td_top.html">TD</A>. --WIE]
</P>
<P>Did the process change at all for the work on &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;?
Not really, they  said, though as they described the sessions it became clear
that considerably more  work had gone into the actual playing for &quot;Jig of
Life&quot;, &quot;Hello Earth&quot; and &quot;And  Dream of Sheep&quot;. For &quot;Jig
of Life&quot;, especially, they had played for a very long time,  many many
hours. Donal said that she asked them to &quot;do what we do&quot;. Since these 
two musicians are almost exclusive one-instrument specialists (pipes and
bouzouki),  and since their styles are by now very fully formed and
identifiable, it was  immediately clear what Donal meant by this. 
</P>
<P>The interesting thing, though, he said, was that Kate knew precisely what
notes  she wanted to hear: again, she didn't give them the specific musical
ideas, but it was  clear that she had the ideas of the melodic and harmonic
lines in her head. She let  them play and play, but afterward, she tailored
their work with an exactitude they  had never encountered anywhere before. IED
is not exaggerating this at all. Donal  especially was extremely impressed with
Kate's perfectionism. 
</P>
<P>He said that he remembered one part of their sessions on &quot;The Ninth
Wave&quot;  particularly well. It was for the tiny bit of whistle heard at the
end of &quot;And Dream  of Sheep&quot;. Love-Hounds will know that this passage,
which is devastatingly beautiful  in the final version, consists of only one or
two notes by the whistle. Donal said he  remembered how Kate had that tiny bit
of piping music played for her over and over  again: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I mean it went on and on. She worked all day at it -- for just one
note! It was  great. She'd say 'That's terrific... but now see if you can't just
make that note  bend just a little more...' We ended up working on one note for
more than three  hours!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Liam, who seems by nature to be a little less open and talkative than Donal,
was  nevertheless equally respectful of Kate. They both commented on her total 
command of the studio and her perfect understanding of the musical problems of 
each part. Finally, I asked Liam if he had worked on anything with Kate since  &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot;. The answer was no. This was a bit of a surprise to IED until he 
remembered that Kate has been working with Davy Spillane this time --perhaps she
 wanted to experiment with a newer style of piping for the new record. 
</P>
<P>Alas! IED must end this report on a disheartening note. The last thing IED
asked  Liam was whether he had had any talks with Kate about possible concerts.
He said,  &quot;No, not at all. You know, I don't think Kate has gone on tour in
several years now!&quot;  IED was quick to let him know just how bloody many
years it had been (though not  in those terms). Now this doesn't mean that Kate
hasn't been planning a tour, since  Liam didn't seem to know about Kate's work
with Davy Spillane, either, as far as  IED could tell. But it certainly doesn't
sound very encouraging. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, thus ends the tale of an L.A. Love-Hound's all-too-brief chat with
two  brilliant and kindly musicians from Ireland. IED signs off for now, but his
fingers  remain crossed, and he can still hear that note floating.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: The Ninth Wave, by Eugene
Burdick 
</P>
<P>While rummaging around in the 4-for-a-dollar baskets at a Hollywood used 
bookstore, IED ran across an arresting title: The Ninth Wave, by Eugene Burdick.
 Burdick was co-author of Fail-Safe, for those who want to know. The Ninth Wave 
was published by Dell Books in 1956, and sold over a million copies. It's a
pot-boiler  about government ambition: as the Chicago Trib put it, &quot;A
powerful novel...violent  actions, startling sexual episodes...bold, brash!&quot;

</P>
<P>The symbolic relevance of the title is explained in the first chapter, The
Ninth  Ninth Wave, which concerns a group of California surfers. Here is an
excerpt: 
</P>
<P>&quot;...He sat stubbornly, endlessly waiting for the ninth ninth wave. Some
of the  other boys would get excited, mistake a big hump for the ninth ninth,
but never  Hank. He always knew when it would come; he never took a smaller
wave; he  always waited for the big one. They all believed that every ninth wave
was bigger  than the preceding eight, and every subsequent ninth wave was bigger
than the one  before it, until the biggest wave of all was the ninth ninth. 
</P>
<P>Mike wasn't sure if the system was accurate, but he did know that there was 
always one wave a day that was bigger than the rest. The other waves might be
big  and sometimes they were really huge and you might get excited and think
that one  of them was the ninth ninth. But not Hank. He always knew when to
wait. He  always got the biggest wave of the day.&quot; (Pp. 9-10). 
</P>
<P>IED has sent off a copy to Kate for her amusement.

<P> &gt;&gt; And I still say she dies at the end of &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;.

</P>
<P>&gt; She does not, you cretinous phlegm-eating slug scabbie! 
</P>
<P>Ugh! IED would never go that far, but again he must agree with Doug (on the 
substantive issue of this dispute). Kate's own comments on the subject of The
Ninth  Wave, as well as dozens of details in the lyrics themselves, leave little
doubt that the  heroine survives the night. The most obvious of these, however,
is the basic  metaphor of the final section. The woman returns to the Earth like
the fog--an  image which Kate has explained has a completely positive and
life-affirming  connotation for her. Also, of course, the character's final
determination to express  openly her love for her family and lover makes sense
only if she has survived. For  Kate has said that The Ninth Wave ends &quot;positively&quot;
and &quot;with hope&quot;. There is  therefore no real possibility that the
heroine dies, since her death would make her  final decision to communicate with
her loved ones nothing but an ironic and cynical  commentary on the futility of
life--an attitude which Kate would never assume.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Survival of the heroine
</P>
<P>&gt; Let's face it. I love Kate as much as we all do, but at the end of *The
Ninth  Wave*, Kate's character is dead. She has turned the toes up to the
daisies, given an  obolus to Charon, shuffled off this mortal coil, dead dead
dead dead. 
</P>
<P>This is absurd. What evidence --and IED means evidence that doesn't just as 
easily or more easily support a quite different inter-pretation--is there in The
Ninth  Wave that the heroine actually dies? On the contrary, everything that
happens in the  recording, as well as everything that Kate has ever said about
it, indicate that there is  a good chance that the heroine survives her night in
the water. IED has already  given several concrete examples that show this
(though for some reason he never  received the Digest that included that
posting). 
</P>
<P>IED has said this time and again in the past, but Pete Berger's remarks
above  require another reminder: It doesn't do any good merely to say &quot;Dead
dead dead  dead dead&quot;. You have to present some reasons for your position.
IED concedes  Julian's and Bob's point that it's almost possible to make some
kind of case for the  heroine's death in Hello Earth and subsequent &quot;reincarnation&quot;
in The Morning Fog.  But there are many details in the song--as well as a host
of explanatory comments  by Kate--which greatly strain the plausibility of such
an interpretation. And although  it may be true that Kate hasn't actually
explicitly stated: &quot;The character in The  Ninth Wave doesn't die,&quot;
that in itself is definitely not an argument for her being  dead --certainly not
at any time during the explicit narrative. She never said The Big  Sky wasn't
about the history of the state of Montana. Does that make Montana the  secret &quot;true&quot;
meaning of The Big Sky ? 
</P>
<P> &gt; Mind you, she *IS* happy about it. But in this cruel world that's not
too  uncommon. In fact, one can almost look at her death as her *REWARD* for
going  through life. This is, at any rate, a very Kate-like idea, I think. 
</P>
<P> Why? How is such a notion &quot;Kate-like&quot;? Where did you get the idea
that Kate's  message is somehow an invitation to death? Again, this is absurd. 
</P>
<P>The question you should be asking yourselves is whether the theory that the 
heroine dies is the single most likely explanation of all the facts, or whether,
after all,  there isn't another far more straightforward explanation that
doesn't require any  awkward twists of logic and convolutions of storyline in
order to answer all the  questions. The Ninth Wave is very complicated, IED is
the first to admit that. But  that's why Kate repeatedly took the trouble to
explain what was happening in each  song, and what the general theme of the
suite was. And nowhere in any of her  comments did she ever imply that the
heroine actually dies. 
</P>
<P>Here is one of several descriptions of the story that Kate has given (IED
has  deleted one paragraph that has to do with technical aspects of the
recording). It is  typical of her comments about The Ninth Wave. You will see
how logical and linear  Kate makes the story's narrative out to be, and how she
explains those events in  terms of the living, suffering, hallucinating
character. She also  does--admittedly--remain unspecific about the final fate of
the heroine. But you will  see that what she leaves open at the end concerns the
heroine's fate following her  survival of the night, not at any point during the
narrative. Kate leaves us in no doubt  at all that her protagonist, whatever the
outcome of her dilemma, has not died  before the clock (literally) ticks away
the last second of the recording: 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P> &quot;The song after that is Hello Earth, and this is the point where she's
so weak  that she relives the experience of the storm that took her in the
water, almost from  a view: looking down on the earth up in the heavens,
watching the storm start to  form--the storm that eventually took her and that
has put her in this situation. 
</P>
<P>&quot;This takes us into The Morning Fog. 'Morning fog' is the symbol of
light and  hope. It's the end of the side, and if you ever have any control over
endings they  should always, I feel, have some kind of light in there.&quot;

</P>
<P>As if IED had not already provided enough proof that the heroine of The
Ninth  Wave does not die, here is an excerpt from one of the MTV interviews Kate
gave in  1985, which IED had forgotten about until recently: 
</P>
<P>J.J. Jackson: Now there are those who will say that the songs are about
someone  drowning, but Kate says that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: &quot;I think even though a lot of people say that the side is
about someone  drowning, it's much more about someone who's not drowning, and
how they're  there for the night in the water, being visited by their past,
present and future to  keep them awake, to keep them going through until the
morning, until there, uh,  there's hope.&quot;

</P>
<P>Yes, I know this has been discussed and discussed and discussed, but it's my
first  contribution... 
</P>
<P>Stephen Kurtzman writes re The Ninth Wave: 
</P>
<P>&gt; Yeah, its pretty clear that the person does not survive. Otherwise you
have to  make all sorts of out-of-body experience hypotheses to account for her
being a ghost  watching her loved one in &quot;Watching you Without Me&quot; and
her ability to play  peek-a-boo with the earth in &quot;Hello Earth&quot;. 
</P>
<P>No! No! No! She does NOT die (IMHO)! Before I bought HoL, I had already read
 a bunch of arguments discussing the subject here in Love-Hounds. So when I
finally  bought the album, I thought I would have a lot of trouble deciding
whether or not  she dies at the end of The Ninth Wave. 
</P>
<P>But to my surprise, I found that after only a couple of listenings, I
definitely had  the feeling she survives. Not, perhaps, because of what the
lyrics say (as we have  already seen, the lyrics are ambiguous) but because of
the feelings and emotions the  music evoked. In particular, The Morning Fog
seems to be about, well, the morning  fog. That is, making it through the night.

</P>
<P>Regarding the argument that you have to believe Kate is talking about 
out-of-body experiences unless she means that the heroine dies: personally, I
think  WYwoM describes a hallucinatory experience the heroine is having, in
perhaps an  almost dreamlike state in the water. Ditto Hello Earth. And I'm
pretty sure Kate  herself has given this explanantion before.

</P>
<P>Gee thanks Mark. If only I had actually listened to the album before posting
my  opinions. :) (I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you didn't mean to
imply that  I hadn't actually listened to it.) 
</P>
<P>Why do we assume that since TMF is &quot;cheerful&quot; music that she
couldn't have  died? Why assume that the physical experience of death is a dark,
morbid, scary,  painful thing? I've never actually talked to anyone who's died,
but I've heard about  so-called &quot;near death&quot; experience, where people
are technically dead and then come  back. The majority of these people talk
about being bathed in a bright, hazy light.  Sort of like when the sun is out of
a foggy day (I went to school in California's  Central Valley and we had lots of
days like this). 
</P>
<P>Here are the &quot;hints&quot; I see in this song: 
</P>
<P>1. Is she physically &quot;falling like a stone&quot;? Couldn't have been a
very successful  rescue if she is. How about emotionally &quot;falling like a
stone&quot;? Doesn't really fit with  the rest of the song, does it? What if
she's &quot;falling&quot; through this world into another?  That makes sense to
me. 
</P>
<P>2. Why does she sing &quot;I'd (I would ) love to hold you now.&quot;? Why
not simply &quot;I'll  hold you now.&quot;? Unless she can't BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD!

</P>
<P>3. The couplet &quot;Being born again/Into the sweet morning fog&quot; just
sounds too  much like she's passed on to the next world. I can't think of any
other plausible  interpretation. Oh she could be saying, &quot;Now that I'm out
of the water, I feel so  young again. My, look how foggy it is this morning.
What's that smell? Does  someone have candy?&quot;, but that's just way to
clumsy for me to believe. 
</P>
<P>If you can get past the cliche that &quot;happy music means happy things are
 happening&quot;, then it's not too hard to see that the heroine could have
died. 
</P>
<P>BTW - I agree with Mark Anderson that WYw/oM is a halucination, and not a  &quot;spiritual
visit&quot;. I don't think that defeats my theory though. I have always claimed 
that she dies at the end of &quot;Hello Earth&quot;, at the spoken line (in
German) &quot;Deeper,  deeper, somewhere in the deep there is a light&quot;.
God, it just all fits! Can't you see it!  (I feel like a frustated poet who
can't find the right words.)

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Survival 
</P>
<P>&gt; Yeah, its pretty clear that the person does not survive. Otherwise you
have to  make all sorts of out-of-body experience hypotheses to account for her
being a ghost  watching her loved one in &quot;Watching you Without Me&quot; and
her ability to play  peek-a-boo with the earth in &quot;Hello Earth&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The above statement is ignorant and poorly considered. IED quotes Kate: &quot;Not
 many people consider that cruel side of the sea, and how...ultimate it is. And
also  the whole thing of almost...like--sensory deprivation, where you've been
in the  water a while, you start losing all sense of where you are, who you are,
whether  you're upside down or whatever. And I just found the whole thing
terribly  fascinating. Although The Ninth Wave is about a very physical event,
it's very much  a mental event as well in that you are travelling in your head,
even though your body  is just floating in water.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Frankly, IED can't believe that this nonsense about the heroine &quot;dying&quot;
at the  end of The Ninth Wave is being bandied about yet again. Did no-one learn
anything  from IED's last posting on this subject? It's just not a matter of
debate, folks. There  are lots of things in Kate's work that are ambiguous and
which may never be  resolved, but the fact of the heroine's being alive at the
end of The Ninth Wave is  not one of them. Kate has said so herself! 
</P>
<P>Besides which, the whole suite would make no sense at all if the character
were  dead at the end. First of all, Kate has several times explained that
Watching You  Without Me is based on the idea of sensory deprivation, and the
experience of  leaving one's body (while alive). The song describes an illusion,
a hallucination, that  the heroine experiences while drifting in the water
overnight. This is not debatable.  Kate has said so flatly more than once. 
</P>
<P>Kate has also said that WYWM is the low-point of the suite. She has said
that Jig  of Life introduces the first note of &quot;hope&quot; into The Ninth
Wave, by telling the story  of the heroine's encounter with her own future self.
The old woman is the heroine  scolding the girl in the water, and admonishing
her not to die because she still has to  get married and have children, etc. It
would have been totally antithetical to Kate's  theme and artistic purposes to
have made this song the emotional and ideological  turning-point of the entire
suite (as Kate has more than once said it is), if the  heroine had then gone
ahead and died before the end of the suite. 
</P>
<P>Hello Earth continues the sensory deprivation theme, sending the heroine's 
consciousness into space. When Kate explained the song Blow Away from Never for 
Ever she often talked about stories she had read about people who had survived 
near-death experiences. She associated those descriptions with the idea of
leaving  one's body, and this is a theme which she explores further in The Ninth
Wave. It  does not indicate that the heroine actually dies, however! In fact,
knowing what we  know about Kate's associations with this theme, it implies
exactly the opposite. 
</P>
<P>Finally, The Morning Fog. First, no one here has said that because the music
 sounds &quot;happy&quot; (which it doesn't, in IED's opinion --of all the silly
stereotypical  ways of describing the rich and complex mood of that music, &quot;happy&quot;
has got to be  one the silliest), it must mean the heroine survives. But the
lyrics certainly don't  give any evidence that the heroine does not survive.
Let's look again at the  comments Kevin Gurney made, with his examples from the
text: 
</P>
<P> &gt;1. Is she physically &quot;falling like a stone&quot;? Couldn't have
been a very successful  rescue if she is. How about emotionally &quot;falling
like a stone&quot;? Doesn't really fit with  the rest of the song, does it? What
if she's &quot;falling&quot; through this world into another?  That makes sense
to me. 
</P>
<P> It makes no more sense than the former idea, that she is falling like a
stone back  into her life. The image suggests the fall back to earth, to
gravity, to reality. It's a  very straightforward and appropriate mataphor. 
</P>
<P>Kevin makes the mistake of assuming that anyone here has been arguing that
an  actual &quot;rescue&quot; takes place in The Ninth Wave. IED sees no
evidence that a rescue  has already been effected before the piece ends. His
only claim--and it is an  indisputable one--is that the heroine has not actually
died in the water before the  piece ends. Why does the obviously poetic,
meta-phorical &quot;stone&quot; image not &quot;fit&quot;  with the rest of the
song, or with the idea that she is coming to a new understanding  of the value
of life? Clearly the heroine has gone through a cathartic experience  during the
night, and now that the dawn has come she appreciates her life and her  loved
ones more. This is not a matter of debate. 
</P>
<P>If the character were dead at this point, then her new-found appreciation of
her  loved ones would be without purpose, which is diametrically opposed to the
avowed  &quot;hopeful, upbeat&quot; ending Kate has herself described The
Morning Fog to be. How  anyone could consider that Kate would conclude The Ninth
Wave with such a cruel,  heavily ironic and bitter joke as that--allowing her
heroine to appreciate her loved  ones only when she has died--is beyond IED. It
is just plain wrong, there's no two  ways about it. Obviously the heroine has
gone through the night, learned a great deal  about the value of her life and
her future, and--at least at the time when the piece  ends--is still alive. If
she had died by this time, her newfound appreciation of her  own future as a
wife and mother, and of her friends still on Earth, would be nothing  but a
nasty, downbeat irony--something which is quite impossible in Kate Bush, and 
which she has herself said is not the final message of The Ninth Wave. 
</P>
<P> &gt;2. Why does she sing &quot;I'd (I would ) love to hold you now.&quot;?
Why not simply  &quot;I'll hold you now.&quot;? Unless she can't BECAUSE SHE'S
DEAD! 
</P>
<P> This is ridiculous. She's in the ocean, for chrissake! She's talking about
how  she'd like to be able to hold her loved one at that moment if she could. If
you're  going to make a fuss about the use of the conditional mode in this spot,
and claim it  as &quot;proof&quot; that the character is dead, then how are you
going to explain the very  next lines, all of which are in the simple future
tense? They read: 
</P>
<P> &quot;I'll kiss the ground <BR> I'll tell my mother <BR> I'll tell my
father <BR> I'll tell my loved one <BR> I'll tell my brothers <BR> How much I
love them.&quot; 
</P>
<P> There's just no way of interpreting these lines as anything but a clear and
 unequivocal statement of the heroine's intention to do just those very things
when  she gets out of the water. It is quite beyond debate, therefore, that (at
least at this  point in the story, i.e. the end of the story as far as the
public knows), the heroine is  alive. Also, if you have a CD of Hounds of Love,
you will be able to hear a sound  effect in the very last half-second of The
Ninth Wave : the momentary sound of a  clock ticking. This nearly buried but
very real sound (it is not equipment noise, and  has even cryptically been
affirmed by John Carder Bush) is another clear sign that  the girl's life is
continuing at the end of the piece. 
</P>
<P> &gt;3. The couplet &quot;Being born again/Into the sweet morning fog&quot;
just sounds too  much like she's passed on to the next world. I can't think of
any other plausible  interpretation. Oh she could be saying, &quot;Now that I'm
out of the water, I feel so  young again. My, look how foggy it is this morning.
What's that smell? Does  someone have candy?&quot;, but that's just way to
clumsy for me to believe. 
</P>
<P> Of course there is another &quot;plausible&quot; explanation! You
trivialize the alternative  way of reading this line, but if you think about it,
it's actually the only truly plausible  reading. The clear and undeniable theme
of The Ninth Wave is the cathartic  re-awakening of the heroine's attitude
toward her life. That's what Jig of Life is all  about, that's what Watching You
Without Me is the preface to. There's no question  about this, Kate has said so
herself. Therefore, the heroine's feeling that she's  &quot;being born again
into the sweet morning fog&quot; is a completely consistent, natural way  of
describing her catharsis--the epiphanous experience she has undergone through 
her traumatic night in the water. To say that the simple expression &quot;being
born  again&quot; must mean that she has actually died is to deny not only a
perfectly valid  alternative interpretation of those words in their own right,
but also to deny  everything that has gone before it in The Ninth Wave. 
</P>
<P>IED started off this posting by saying that Kate has herself said that the
heroine  does not die. He posted relevant quotations in Love-Hounds only a few
short months  ago. For this reason he feels compelled to express again the wish
that you folks  would work on improving your memories, or at least that you'd
review the archives  once or twice before spouting off ill-informed, weakly
supported theories without  doing the necessary research. Here are Kate's own
words: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, as part of the concept of the second side, The Ninth Wave, the
last song  had to be very positive, very much the idea of everything bursting
into light so it's  all suddenly reborn, rather than that every-thing dies.&quot;
And, again, Kate's own  words (and this ought to put an end once and for all to
the ridiculous notion of  dying): &quot;A lot of people have said that The Ninth
Wave is about the girl dying, but  it's much more about the girl not dying.&quot;
(Kate's own italics.)

</P>
<P>&gt; --of all the silly stereotypical ways of describing the rich and
complex mood of  that music [&quot;The Morning Fog&quot;], &quot;happy&quot; has
got to be one the silliest. 
</P>
<P>Silliest? Okay, what words would you use to characterize it? Given that it's
of a  spirited tempo, it's in a major key, it begins 'subito forte', the
acoustic guitar is  clear and in the foreground of the recording, and that it
follows a piece which is in a  minor key and fades out, I'd say 'happy' isn't
too far from the mark. But since  you've obviously given careful and studied
thought to the word that best describes  the musical nature of The Morning Fog,
by all means do share your thoughts with  the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>I'm also curious to see what you find so &quot;rich and complex&quot; about
the mood of  this piece. Again, please share your thoughts with the rest of us.

</P>
<P>&gt; Kevin makes the mistake of assuming that anyone here has been arguing
that an  actual &quot;rescue&quot; takes place in The Ninth Wave. IED sees no
evidence that a rescue  has already been effected before the piece ends. 
</P>
<P>I guess I stand guilty as charged. I assumed that those who see a survival
also saw  a rescue. Apparently, Andrew doesn't. But without evidence of a rescue
how can  you claim that she survives? Yes, she may have survived the night, and
she's put her  life in perspective, but you can't really say she survives the
water and goes back to  her family and all the other elements that are necessary
for a truly happy ending.  (Oh there's that word again. So sorry Andrew.) 
</P>
<P>Maybe, just maybe, the &quot;hopeful, upbeat&quot; (Kate's words) ending of
this suite is  that if the heroine should die after the record ends, then she is
able to accept her  death. Maybe not. (I think we already know what Andrew
thinks.) 
</P>
<P>&gt; Why does the obviously poetic, metaphorical &quot;stone&quot; image not
&quot;fit&quot; with the  rest of the song, or with the idea that she is coming
to a new understanding of the  value of life? 
</P>
<P>I can see your point and must admit that it does make sense. Touche'. 
</P>
<P>&gt; If you're going to make a fuss about the use of the conditional mode in
this  spot, and claim it as &quot;proof&quot; that the character is dead, then
how are you going to  explain the very next lines, all of which are in the
simple future tense? They read: 
</P>
<P>[ lines deleted ] 
</P>
<P>There's just no way of interpreting these lines as anything but a clear and 
unequivocal statement of the heroine's intention to do just those very things
when  she gets out of the water. 
</P>
<P>Or she, being dead, will 'tell' her loved ones how much she loves them in
other  ways. The more mystical among us can hope/believe that contact with the
dead is  possible (No, I'm not claiming that Kate believes this, so put the gun
down), and  those of us raised in a Catholic tradition (as I believe Kate was,
having atteded St.  Joseph's Convent Grammar School), can remember being told
that the dead in  heaven pray for us on earth just as we here on earth pray for
their souls. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Also, if you have a CD of Hounds of Love, you will be able to hear a
sound  effect in the very last half-second of The Ninth Wave : the momentary
sound of a  clock ticking. This nearly buried but very real sound (it is not
equipment noise, and  has even cryptically been affirmed by John Carder Bush) is
another clear sign that  the girl's life is continuing at the end of the piece.

</P>
<P>I haven't heard this, but I shall don headphones tonight and hunt for it.
How in  the world does a clicking clock, assuming that's what it is, mean &quot;the
girl's life is  continuing&quot;? Please elaborate on this idea. 
</P>
<P>And now for the summing up.... 
</P>
<P>Many times throughout Andrew's response he used phrases like: 
</P>
<P>&gt; It's just not a matter of debate, folks. 
</P>
<P>Well it's not about debate, Andrew. It's about interpretation! As I see it,
there  are few Absolutes Rights and Wrongs when it comes to artistic
intrepretation. An  artist may certainly say, &quot;Well, that's not what I was
aiming for&quot;, but that doesn't  mean others can't explore other
interpretations of the art. In fact sometimes artists  themselves don't even
know the intrepretation of the art they create. (This is  general comment about
art, and is not meant to suggest that I think Kate doesn't  know what she's
doing). 
</P>
<P>If you have some personal problem with intrepretations of Kate's songs that
in  any fashion contradict what Kate herself has said they might mean, that's
fine. But  it's a far leap from &quot;This is what Kate says&quot; to &quot;This
is what is must mean for all  people, for all time!&quot; 
</P>
<P>I would think Kate must see the oppurtunity that re-intrepretation and 
re-examination provide to keep great works of art alive and breathing. I think
you  really must examine whether you're doing Kate's music a service by
insisting on  rigid, dogmatic dedication to the (mostly ambiguous) remarks Kate
has made about  the deeper meaning of her songs. 
</P>
<P>If some of us find solace in the belief that the heroine faces death at the
end of  the suite (or even after the record ends) with a clear mind and a fuller
 understanding of her love for her family and friends, rather than in a panicked
 flailing of self-doubt and fear, then who are you to say we are Wrong?
Likewise, I  now realize that some of my own comments about the above theory,
while meaning  only to point out what I see as obvious, may have been
interpreted as saying &quot;this is  the way it must be&quot;. This was never my
intent; if Andrew or anyone else think (and  I do believe the majority holds
this view) that the heroine not only survives the  night, but is (or has already
been) rescued by the end of the record, then that's fine  with me and I won't
say (and never had said!): &quot;It's not a matter of debate, folks.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As you've often said, Andrew, you have a particular way of writing about
Kate  and her KrafT for which you feel no need to apologize. I certainly won't
ask for an  apology, but I would ask that you examine your thoughts on the
subject of artistic  criticism and interpretation more closly, away from the
flamage and blither of the  net. If you really, truly,
all-hyperbolic-netwriting-aside, believe that this sort of  discussion is &quot;not
a matter for debate&quot;, then I think you should come out and say so. 
</P>
<P>So now what do I think happens at the of TNW? Well, now I'm more likely to 
subscribe to the point of view that; she doesn't die at the end of Hello Earth;
the  Morning Fog is a celebration not just of life, but of her survival; whether
she is  rescued or not, the heroine has had a truly glorious and soul-enriching
experience  for which she can be nothing but the better; and that she herself,
while unsure of  her immediate future with regards to being rescued, isn't
fearful of dying. 
</P>
<P>Your intrepretations may vary. :)

at end of TNW 
</P>
<P>Remember that Kate Bush has been said to find the more magical side of life 
&quot;fascinating&quot;, and has never (as far as I know) rejected the
possibility of such talents  as empathy, projection, foreknowledge, etc. With
this in mind as possible source  material for the TNW, the interpretation
subject to the least ambiguity -- often the  interpretation intended by the poet
--supports the survival of the heroine. On the  issue of poetry not having a
correct interpretion: The correct interpretations will sit  well with the
*entire* work, illuminating *all* of its components. Such, at least, is  what I
consider to be high poetry.

<P>Quotes from:

</P>
<P>b: Steve Bloch 
</P>
<P>g &gt; 1. Is she physically &quot;falling like a stone&quot;? Couldn't have
been a very successful  rescue if she is. How about emotionally &quot;falling
like a stone&quot;? Doesn't really fit with  the rest of the song, does it? What
if she's &quot;falling&quot; through this world into another?  That makes sense
to me. 
</P>
<P>This [falling] expresses well the subjective descriptions of the spirit
falling back  into the body after an out-of-body experience. Such experiences
are thought to  happen to those attempting escape from especially harrowing
events, perhaps causing  death by abandonment. This fits nicely with her elder
self's entreaty to her to  *remain* in JoL, rather than to simply leave her body
to die. This is also supported  by her visit to her loved in WYWM, but inability
to touch him. 
</P>
<P>The lines: 
</P>
<P> The light <BR> Begin (sic) to bleed, <BR> Begin to breathe, <BR> Begin
to speak 
</P>
<P>sound to me like the rediscovery of what her body feels like, after having
been  away for so long. I believe the keyword here is &quot;falling&quot;, not &quot;stone&quot;,
*unless*  perhaps she returns to her body to find it sinking like a stone, and
the verse is  describing the swim back up to the surface. It would be a nice
double intent, if so. 
</P>
<P>g &gt; 3. The couplet &quot;Being born again/Into the sweet morning fog&quot;
just sounds too  much like she's passed on to the next world. I can't think of
any other plausible  interpretation. 
</P>
<P>Death is often used as a metaphor for change, especially when associated
with  trauma. If an object/person is changed, the old *identity* is then
obsolete, null, or  dead. This metaphor is most clearly seen in the Tarot deck
card &quot;Death&quot; (usually a  skeleton) the tarot card for change. Hence,
this reads for me as a line of rebirth.  Someone said: 
</P>
<P>? &gt; a completely consistent, natural way of describing her catharsis--the
 epiphanous experience she has undergone through her traumatic night in the
water. 
</P>
<P>b &gt; The ocean has been used as a metaphor for rebirth within this life
for  thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>This is a good observation by Bloch. My thoughts on the sea involved a
certain  inevitable, overpowering quality -- certainly an auspicious place for a
person's being  remade. 
</P>
<P>I personally have not yet decided whether or not she is rescued, although I
am  curious about the helicopter, and the line &quot;Get out of the water!&quot;.

</P>
<P>I also wonder about the word &quot;Murderer&quot; in Hello Earth. It this an
accusation of  her as-yet unborn children? Is it this that brings her back?
(Does anyone have all  this song written down?)

<P>Date: Tue, 08 May 90 16:26 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: The Ninth Wave
</P>
<P>The following summation of the narrative in The Ninth Wave is grossly
incorrect: 
</P>
<P>&gt; Here is a quick reply. The story basically is of a person (most likely
a man) who  is somehow thrown off of the ship he was traveling on. He is now in
the water  trying to stay alive. The longer he is in the water, the more tired
he gets. He soon  falls asleep and has a variety of dreams showing his longing
for being rescued and  safe. He returns home and visits his home &quot;after
dying&quot;. Later, he leaves his body  entirely and floats away, to look at the
Earth from orbit. The story ends on a happy  note with the song Morning Fog but
I think this is his last dream, as he dreams of  being safe, he really dies. The
lyrics are opaque enough to really derive many  interpretations. Mine comes from
interviews with Kate as she explains the thing. 
</P>
<P>-- Richard Fox 
</P>
<P> The Ninth Wave certainly affords a variety of interpretations, insofar as
its larger  symbolic and general thematic content is concerned. Its surface
narrative, however,  does not admit of much variety of interpretation. Kate has
herself described the  story in very precise terms. For one thing, she has been
quite explicit about the fact  that the protagonist is a woman, not a man. IED
quotes from Kate's own KBC  Newsletter article about the meaning of The Ninth
Wave (this section begins with  her comments about Waking the Witch): 
</P>
<P> It's the trial of this girl who's in the water; and all she wants to do is
survive  and keep her head above water. 
</P>
<P>The next song is about how she wants to go home. That's really the thing she
 wants most, just to be in the cosy atmosphere of her belongings all around her,
and  the security of those four walls and the firm ground, and being with the
one that  she loves. She finds that she's there in spirit, and there's her loved
one sitting in a  chair by the fire, but she hadn't conceived the idea that she
wouldn't actually be  there in real terms. She's not real. And although she can
see her man, he can't see  her--she can't communicate with him in any way. It's
more of a nightmare than  anything so far, because this is the closest she's
been to any kind of comfort, and yet  it's the furthest away. 
</P>
<P>The next song is Jig of Life. This is about the future self who comes to her
 rescue, basically. She says &quot;Look, I'm the next part of your life and if I
am going to  survive and enjoy the things that I've enjoyed--having my children,
my happy home  and my husband--then you've got to keep it together, you've got
to stay alive, you  musn't drown or I will drown with you.&quot; It's the future
begging her, pleading with  her to let her, the future lady, live. 
</P>
<P>The song after that is Hello Earth, and this is the point where she's so
weak that  she relives the experience of the storm that took her in the water,
almost from a  view: looking down on the earth up in the heavens, watching the
storm start to  form--the storm that eventually took her and that has put her in
this situation. 
</P>
<P>This takes us into The Morning Fog. &quot;Morning Fog&quot; is the symbol of
light and  hope. It's the end of the side, and if you ever have any control over
endings they  should always, I feel, have some kind of light in there. 
</P>
<P> Love-Hounds will see from these words of Kate's not only that the
protagonist  of The Ninth Wave is female (the song Jig of Life can permit no
other condition  anyway, so Kate's confirmation isn't even necessary), but also
that the heroine is  not &quot;dead&quot;! Kate has said in interviews that her
concept for Watching You Without  Me came out of her interest in the idea of
sensory deprivation tanks, and the  experience of feeling separated from one's
body. (It's also very similar in concept to  the earlier song Blow Away .) But
the heroine is not dead in WYWM ; rather, her  consciousness has simply traveled
away from her body--much as it does in Hello  Earth. There is no doubt about
this: read Kate's description of Jig of Life above, and  you will see that the
very premise of that song requires that the heroine still be  living at that
point in the story. And since it is the struggle to remain alive that is the 
dominant dramatic issue in The Ninth Wave, it follows that the heroine must
still be  living as the last song ends--else Kate would not have said that there
was still hope at  the conclusion of the side. 
</P>
<P>IED doesn't know where Mr. Fox got his information, but he definitely didn't
 get it from interviews with Kate Bush herself.

</P>
<P>&gt; Subject: *** Great Hounds of Love interview 2 ***** <BR> &gt; From:
rhill@netlink.cts.com (Ron Hill) 
</P>
<P>&gt; completely alone in all this water. AND THEY'VE GOT A LIFE JACKET  WITH
A LITTLE LIGHT SO THAT IF ANYONE SHOULD BE TRAVELING AT  NIGHT THEY'LL SEE THE
LIGHT AND KNOW THEY'RE THERE. And they're  absolutely terrified, and they're 
</P>
<P>Hey, I think this is some documentation that contradicts the canonical IED 
interpretation of what the &quot;little light&quot; is in the song, &quot;And
Dream of Sheep.&quot; The  canonical interpretation, as I remember it, is that
the &quot;little light&quot; referred to is a  lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>However, in the above, KaTe clearly refers to it as a little flashlight
attached to the  life jacket. I assume it's one of those emergency flashlights
that turn on  automatically when exposed to water. Now that I've heard the
explanation of the  reference, it makes perfect sense to me. 
</P>
<P>I think it also changes the feeling one might vibe from the song. 
</P>
<P>Thinking of a lighthouse, one might imagine the person in the water looking 
towards the horizon and seeing the lighthouse beam scanning around. The person 
would be enveloped in darkness, but would see a light in the distance. That
light  would represent safety and provide hope. 
</P>
<P>Thinking of a little emergency flashlight attached to the lifejacket, one
might  imagine that the person is surrounded by darkness. The flashlight
provides a little  illumination for the person, but everything around her is
darkness. So no hopeful  light to look towards. The only hope is that someone
will see her little light. Also,  the little light provides some comfort from
the darkness. I imagine the scene as  Kate's face illuminated weakly by a small
flashlight below her chin, with total  blackness around her. 
</P>
<P>So, the &quot;lighthouse&quot; interpretation is focused on the horizon and
it's hope and  safety. The &quot;emergency flashlight&quot; interpretation
places the focus on the person, and  the fear and lonliness they are
experiencing. 
</P>
<P>[re The Morning Fog:]
</P>
<P>&gt; K: Well, that's really meant to be the rescue of the whole situation,
where now  suddenly out of all this darkness and weight comes light. You know,
the weightiness  is gone and here's the morning, and it's meant to feel very
positive and bright and  uplifting from the rest of dense, darkness of the
previous track. And although it  doesn't say so, in my mind this was the song
where they were rescued, where they  get pulled out of the water. And it's very
much a song of seeing perspective, of  really, you know, of being so grateful
for everything that you have, that you're never  grateful of in ordinary life
because you just abuse it totally. And it was also meant to  be one of those
kind of &quot;thank you and goodnight&quot; songs. You know, the little finale 
where everyone does a little dance and then the bow and then they leave the
stage.  [laughs] 
</P>
<P>I believe this is another reference that reveals that the person does live
at the  end. 
</P>
