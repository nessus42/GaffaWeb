</P>
<P> &gt;While I noticed that Kate was quite dramatic with her expressions in
several of  the videos, I thought the bug-eyed stance in Sat In Your Lap rather
ridiculous  looking, to say the least. Probably the only bad thing I found in
all of them... 
</P>
<P> Bad? Unless you consider the reason for Kate's blank, empty stare
throughout  Sat In Your Lap. She obviously did that very deliberately--she has
never used quite  that kind of vapid expression in any other performance, just
Sat In Your Lap. Could  it have anything to do with the theme of the song?

<P>Date: Mon, 15 Jan 90 09:06:27 +0100 <BR> From: Andreas Bjorklind &lt;abj@IDA.LiU.SE&gt;
<BR> Subject: MusikDramatik (4/89) article 
</P>
<P>Article from the Swedish &quot;serious&quot; magazine MusikDramatik's
(Musical drama)  fourth issue 1989. It is written by Ola Stensson. The
translation is mine, with help  from Ms. Carina Skytt. 
</P>
<P>Preamble: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Much can be included in the conception of musical drama --eg rock
videos.  Might this be an art form belonging to the future? Ola Stensson have
studied one  rock artist with artistic ambitions -- Kate Bush.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The article: 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is one enormously vital art form that have been ignored in
Swedish arts  pages during the eighties -- the rock video. It is possible that
this means of  expression already has changed our perception, our view of a
dramatic course of  events, our sense of rhythm, and also our view of man. 
</P>
<P>The rock video is nothing new -- it's nearly as old as the form of music
itself.  The interesting thing is that while this music has stepped back after
the reshaping  years of 1966-1971, rock, in it's capacity of visual medium, has
developed and is at the  moment most creative, vital, and often experimental.
The situation today is really  paradoxal. Sometimes it can almost be as if Harry
Kupfer should produce Laurel &amp;  Hardy film. 
</P>
<P>There are exeptions where music, lyrics, and visuals are a synthesis, and
where  we are at the Complete Work of Art. An example of an artist with
ambitions as well  as means of creating something like this is Kate Bush. It's
not a question of  comparing her to Wagner, Alban Berg, Karl-Birger Blomdahl, or
someone else with  their ambition. But, she is an example of what could be done
and what always can be  done. Most of the innovation remains. 
</P>
<P>WUTHERING HEIGHTS  
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is English, and was born in 1958, made a hit in 1978 with &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot;, a song based on Emily Bronte's novel. She has since released six
albums.  The music is sometimes superficially very difficult to access, with
complicated  arrangements and dared shifts in rhythm, especially on the LP &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; form  1982. This dosen't hinder a strong influence from
folk-music, not the least the Irish,  like in &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (1985)
or the Bulgarian as in &quot;The Sensual World&quot; (1989). 
</P>
<P>If you go through Kate Bush's videos from the beginning you find a
development  that pretty well correspond to the one her music has undergone.
Here follow some  examples. 
</P>
<P>In the beginning it was not a matter of illustrating lyrics and music. It
was more a  matter of pure promotion ((emphasized in the original --Andreas)).
If one, as an  example, choses videos from Kate's first album one finds her
videos decorative,  elegant, but dramatically highly stylized. There are
exeptions, though, like &quot;Hammer  Horror&quot; from the second LP &quot;Lionheart&quot;.
The lyrics are about the depression that  always seems to lurk in the singer's
soul, and hinders the I she shows among the  people. Kate performs with an aura
of innocence, she wears brightly coloured  flowers, but she is wearing black
clothes and is constantly followed by another black  clothed figure that
imitates her movements. After a while she throws the flower  decorated hat away
and the black shadow gets more power over her. They enter an  erotic dance,
which ends with the black clothed masqued shape strangling its victim. 
</P>
<P>This is perhaps the first Kate Bush video where the producer's ambitions
were  beyond creating a mere promotion. Kate's ideas are now developing, and the
result  is shown in full by the 1982's &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, where an
enormous amount of work  has been concentrated on her visual language. The
result is very gifted and most  peculiar. Take, for example, &quot;Breathing&quot;.
Kate is here enclosed in a transparent  bubble, which strongly reminds of a
womb. She tries to break out of this bubble, but  succeeds only in moving it.
She imitates the embryo's movements in the amniotic  fluid &quot;I've been out
before. But this time it's much safer in.&quot;. Suddenly the bubble  starts
rotating and rolls without control. It bursts, and a birth takes place in strong
 lights like from an atomic explosion. In the next sequence one sees Kate wade
out of  a river (the water returns as a symbol) together with other survivors --
breathing  ((emphasized in the original --Andreas)) -- and the A-bomb mushroom
shrinks. So,  life is appearently possible, even for the one who manage to break
free from herself. 
</P>
<P>A very sophisticated video, not only technically, is &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;.
The lyric is  philosophical and deal with the impossiblitity about knowledge.
Kate roller-skates, in  a cone-formed idiot hat, together with similiarly
clothed people. In come fools and  heathens in brutal bull masks. The urges and
the joking is reality, we don't have  any other knowledge. Kate is now clad in &quot;the
White Ballet's&quot; attribute, and dances  on the clean parquet, as the
Cultural Human surrounded by reality. 
</P>
<P>STONEHENGE LANDSCAPE 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Dreaming&quot; is one of her most famous videos, and is taking
place in a  dreamt Stonehenge landscape, obviously located on another planet.
Kate falls out of  the sky in a space suit. But everything from her original
civilization seems to have  been forgotten, since she starts working on a rock
with a wedge and looks  watchfully around like a human -- a prehistoric human --
surrounded by a thousand  dangers. A laser beam cuts through the landscape, and
she caresses it with her  hands. Thus she and the &quot;primitive&quot;
aboriginies conjure on the planet a  thunderstorm, which buries them in sand.
But one of the beings, previously mute,  can suddenly speak. So, the human
doesn't change. The primitive can develop, and  the civilized can go back, but a
change is in fact not possible. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot; has a abandoned stable as the scene. &quot;Can't
have it all&quot; is a  maxim in the lyric, which is illustrated by Kate
building a bird out of nothing -- out  of the thin air -- which then flies. In
the end the bird is captured, but it's not a  usual bird, not of flesh and
blood, but consisting of one feather which is caught by  the wind. &quot;I'm
much more of that girl in the mirror between you and me&quot; -- so it's  her
own view of herself that hinders her real contact with other people. In the end 
a mother figure appears in this stable. This mother is real and doesn't
disappear  when Kate hugs her. 
</P>
<P>These songs about no contact and ignorance about the reality, were in some
sense  exchanged by sturdiness in her next album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>The conclusion is: Don't be afraid of the rock culture, and, particularly,
don't be  afraid of the Bush lass. She has much to give us, regardless to which
generation we  belong. And the rock video, as has been said, is a very vital
part of musical drama  which we now must not look down on. Don't content
yourselves with reading about  this: See it and form your own opinion!&quot;

</P>
<P>Sincere thanks to Andreas for transcribing the Musik Dramatik article on 
symbolism in Kate's videos. Some of Ola's observations were very interesting, 
though several were unfortunately flawed by a mis-interpretation of the English 
lyrics of the song. (It isn't &quot;obvious&quot;, for example, that the setting
for the video of  The Dreaming is &quot;another planet&quot;. In fact, that
seems very unlikely. It's far more  likely that the intended setting is
Australia--a weird, horrifying alter-Australia,  perhaps, but still Australia.

JONES%RPIECS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: videos 
</P>
<P>Hello there fellow Love-Hounds--
</P>
<P>The final KT item which I found was a new VIDEO (yes, you heard me right) 
called Kate Bush: The Collection. The cover is black and has a
head-and-shoulders  shot of Kate in her Wuthering Heights white gown. What this
tape consists of is any  and possibly every TV show clip that Kate ever appeared
on, including the old SNL  with Eric Idle introducing her. A lot of the items
are things I've never even heard  of, such as something called the Old Grey
Whistle Test (?), Razzmatazz, etc. There is  even one clip taken from a COOKING
show, where Kate introduces the hostess to  the joys of vegetarian fare as the
two of them chat in Kate's garden. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there are some bits which have less-than-terrific quality,
but  being PAL converted, what do you expect? The content of the video, to me at
least,  more than makes up for the lacking quality. There is one bit where Kate
is sitting  with the show's hostess in front of a lot of school-age children,
where she discusses  the video for Sat In Your Lap, and she proceeds to pull out
a series of props from  the video and put them on the kids' heads: the jester's
cap, the dunce cap, and the  bull horns. She even pulls her ballerina tutu out
of her bag of tricks. It's quite cute  to watch her interacting with the kids. 
</P>
<P>That's all for now. Big woofs.... 
</P>
<P>  All the best, 
</P>

<BR> Subject: Army Dreamers Mrs. Mopp performance on 3sat 
</P>
<P>Hi all Katefans, 
</P>
<P>and, seen Kate on 3SAT? It was not only the Mrs. Mopp performance of Army 
Dreamers, it also was the Babooshka performance of the same date. By the way,
the  programme originally ran on September 13, 1980, just for those who do
day-by-day  biographies of any kind. 
</P>

<P>Phew! That was thrilling. The programme was announced for the time from
14:15  to 14:55. At about 14:35 Kate performed Babooshka. Then off the stage.
Sh.t! Only  Babooshka! No Mrs. Mopp! But then: On 14:53 she came again, this
time as Mrs.  Mopp... Now: Would they cut her off? No, the show actually ran
until after 14:55.  There was even enough time for Rod Stewart to BEGIN his
performance. He was  more or less cut off! Luckily we are the Katefans, not the
Rodfans... 
</P>
<P>Can anyone tell IED (or are you actually reading this?) that he should swap 
entries 45 and 46 in his video list in the GARDEN02 file? You're always trying
to be  the most exact Katemaniac...;-) BTW: There are actually three (not two)
guys  dancing with her. 
</P>
<P>Now I have a question: Might it be the case that the photo of the Mrs. Mopp 
appearance that is printed in the book 'Kate Bush - The Whole Story' by Kerry 
Juby between pages 52 and 53 is from another source? Look at Kate's hair, it is 
looking different! In the RockPop performance it is pulled out of the headscarf,
in  the photo in the book it is not.
