<P>Hello Dreaming readers, 
</P>
<P>Welcome to the web version of Wieland Willker's DREAMING!  I'm very happy
that I had a hand in helping Wieland bring this amazing collection to the
Gaffaweb. He spent months putting it together, and he deserves a big round of
applause!
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center">CLAPCLAPYAYCHEERCLAPCLAP!!!</H2>
<P>I'm in awe of his accomplishments, wrt Dreaming and Moments, and you should
be too!
</P>
<P>This collection is available in the archives in pure text form, but I should
mention that the web version has some fundamental differences. Not in content,
but in format and file names. I had to change quite a few things around so
they'd work better in html, but be assured that the complete contents of the
archives version is represented. I split up many, many files, so they'd load
faster. I also changed file names when they clashed with others, or just didn't
work for some reason. For instance, Wieland  had multiple files just named &quot;b-sides&quot;,
and they were in different directories, so it didn't matter. The Dreaming web
files are all in one biiiig directory, so identical files names were out of the
question.
</P>
<P>In general, whenever I changed a file name, I'd put the original name (the
name that appears in the text archives) in comments at the top of the page. Look
at the Document source for that, if you need it.  I also changed some of the
names on Weiland's Table of Contents page, to flesh out what the page was about.
I also occasionally moved things around. A comparison of the text Contents page
and my html page (toc.htm) will reveal the differences. Nothing major Wieland!

<P>Throughout Dreaming you'll see lines like this:

<P>The first and last long line will always take you to another page, and I
always indicate where it goes. Any long or short lines *within* the page will
always take you up to the top of the page you're on. I used the same system in
Moments and the FAQ.

<P>Techie junk, for those who are interested:<BR> I worked on the html'ization
of Dreaming off and on throughout May, June and July of 1996. I first ran all
Wieland's text files through Webber, to take care of basic html, such as turning
quotes and brackets into their html counterparts, and saved them as html files. 
I then ran everything through Kenn Nesbitt's WebEdit 2.0 Professional Beta 3 for
all the main html. (There were lots of unwanted artifacts from Webber I had to
delete and change. Webber makes every single single line an h2 header...ugh!).
</P>
<P>I used a lot of templates for things like headers and footers. That all was
mainly done in  PFE-Programmer's File Editor.  PFE's recorder also came in handy
when I needed to clean up the headers of posts, of which there are thousands
within Dreaming. A simple macro to add breaks and group lines saved me at
*least* a week's worth of work. I did it all by hand for Moments, so I *know*
the time it saved. Thanks to Chris for cluing me in to PFE.
</P>
<P>The background was originally taken from Kate's single for &quot;Breathing&quot;,
and I manipulated it in both Paint Shop Pro, and Fractal Design Painter. I'm not
an artist, by any stretch of the imagination, so thank goodness for programs
that let people like me get away with not being artists. True artists using
those programs are the real winners when using those programs, and I deeply
admire them.
</P>
<P>No, I didn't get paid or anything for mentioning the programs above. I just
used them, and thought others might be interested in knowing what I used. I'm
certainly not an expert in html, but the programs I used made the whole process
a bit easier.
</P>
<P>It was a long, hard road getting all this html'ized, and I'm glad it can
finally be presented to the world, so Gaffaweb readers can enjoy Wieland's work,
and Love-Hound's words. There are still lots of things that can be added, such
as links and images, so the web version of Dreaming is not &quot;finished&quot;
and will continue to be improved over time. Any broken links or suggestions for
improvement should be sent to me at <A HREF="mailto:vickie@wwa.com">vickie@wwa.com</A>.
</P>
<P>I'd like to heartily thank Bill Wisner for providing space for the Gaffaweb,
and giving us free-reign to do whatever we wanted with it. Thanks Bill! 
</P>
<P>Huge thanks to Andy (IED), Wieland and Uli, because without their hard and
endlessly  wonderful work, Gaffaweb wouldn't be a fraction of what it is. Their
work also gave me lots  to do! And it was always fun! They are WonderFans
deluxe.
</P>
<P>My biggest thanks go to Chris Williams, my partner-in-life-and-love for the
past 15 years. He's the one who got me started on computers, and interested in
the Web. If not for him, his support, his technical expertise, and his toys(!),
I wouldn't even be involved in this project. It's all his fault :-), and I love
him dearly for it!
</P>
<P>Have fun!</P>
