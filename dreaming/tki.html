Subject: TKI Covers 
</P>
<P>&gt; From: Tim Wicinski &lt;wicinski@nrl-css.ARPA&gt; <BR> &gt; How many
covers of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; are there?? 
</P>
<P>Gee. Lots and lots? There are at least five. 
</P>
<P>The Original cover is the &quot;Kite&quot; cover, with Kate flying by the
big eyeball. 
</P>
<P>The U.S. cover is often called the &quot;Red Sox&quot; picture. It's sort of
KB looking like a  country/western singer, which is why, I would suppose, you
called it the &quot;Tammy  Wynette cover&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The Canadian cover is the &quot;Oooh my aching hairdoo&quot; cover and looks
like  something out of Vogue magazine. 
</P>
<P>The Japanese cover is a cropped version of the original KB EMI publicity
poster  that Vermorel was talking about and could be called the &quot;Nipples&quot;
cover, except that  they cropped off half of each nipple. 
</P>
<P>I'm told the Uraguay pressing has yet another cover. And I don't know about 
Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, etc.

</P>
<P>Hi! 
</P>
<P>One question for the photographic master minds of love-hounds: 
</P>
<P>- the UK cover picture of The Kick Inside (the Kate-kite) has been twisted a
 little bit for the cover. If you look close enough you can see that something
was done,  but not neccessarily what and why. Can you tell? 
</P>
<P>Hint: To answer this you probably need a photo from the same session that
has  not been twisted... 
</P>
<P>Since this is really a hard core question I'd offer a price for the first
correct  answer, a sampler CD I have twice. It's called Worldstars For Freedom
and contains  Peter Gabriel &amp; Kate Bush with Don't Give Up. 
</P>
<P>The offer ends on September 15th, then I'll post the answer and think of
another  question.

Grepel) <BR> Subject: Re: UK TKI photo quiz 
</P>
<P>I think I now can reveal the answer to the other question (what was done to
the  TKI cover photo with the Kate-kite?): 
</P>
<P>In the September 1994 issue of Audio (German hifi and music magazine)
there's  an untwisted photo of said session (page 11) where Kate is shown
hanging at a kind  of trapeze in front of the kite. The metal bar where she
hangs goes all over the top  of the kite. The bar was retouched to the black bar
we can see on the TKI cover  (and also the WH single cover). If you look CLOSELY
you can see that Kate's  fingers, were the bar really black, would have to be
about 5 mm thin. That is, the  black bar is too thick. And also thicker than all
other black bars from the kite. 
</P>
<P>By the way, anyone has one of the very early Audio magazines? They said in
the  caption to the photo (which they put there because the 9/94 issue is the
200th of  them) that Kate thanked them for already predicting a great future for
her in 1979  by granting exclusive interviews. Anyone got them? 
</P>
<P>Bye, Uli

<P>MOVING ANNOTATED LYRICS
</P>
<P>HISTORY 
</P>
<P>Moving appeared for the first time on The Kick Inside , Kate's first
release. It  later appeared as the B side to the second single from that album,
The Man With the  Child in His Eyes . 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside.....................................EMC 3223......02/17/78

</P>
<P>The Man With the Child in His Eyes/ Moving...EMI 2806......05/28/78 
</P>
<P>BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>&quot; Moving is a tribute to Lindsay Kemp, the dance and mime performer
whose  highly influential show, Flowers (based on texts of Jean Genet), Kate
attended when  she was 15 or 16. Kemp's use of gesture without sound -- what
Kate calls  &quot;expressive&quot; mime, as opposed to the Marcel
Marceau-tradition's &quot;mime of illusion&quot;  -- made a profound impression
on her, and within another few months she had  begun studying under Kemp. After
Kemp left for Australia Kate went on to work  with several other dance
instructors at the Dance Centre in Covent Garden, but she  has always referred
to Kemp as the first and foremost influence on her use of  movement as an
expressive vehicle in her musical performances.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Andrew Marvick 
</P>
<P>&quot;[Lindsay Kemp] taught me that you can express with your body -- and
when  your body is awake so is your mind. He'd put you into emotional
situations, some of  them very heavy. Like he'd say, 'Right, you're all now
going to become sailors  drowning, and there are waves curling up around you.'
And everyone would just  start screaming.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Kate, March 1978, Interview by Steve Clarke. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He needed a song written to him. He opened up my eyes to the meanings
of  movement. He makes you feel so good. If you've got two left feet it's 'you
dance  like an angel darling.' He fills people up, you're an empty glass and
glug, glug, glug,  he's filled you with champagne.&quot; - Kate Sounds, 1980 
</P>
<P>It has been speculated by some that Kate had a &quot;crush&quot; on Kemp,
though there is  no evidence of this beyond the song's lyrics. In any case, Kemp
has been a  tremendous influence on Kate throughout her career. 
</P>
<P>In the thirteenth issue of the Kate Bush Club newsletter (summer of 1983)
Kate  writes about visiting Kemp while traveling to promote The Dreaming : 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was a very interesting trip -- we went to Rome, and as Lindsay Kemp
was  visiting at the time, we got a chance to see Lindsay, and we had a lovely
evening. He  cooked us a meal, and after we were so full that we could hardly
move, he got out  boxes of his old photos and we fingered each one with magical
memories: shots of  Flowers from The Collegiate Theatre, the first time I saw
Lindsay perform. Lindsay  dressed as Mr.Punch, leaping for joy. I remember the
theatre being full of adults  rather than children, and all of us shouting &quot;Look
behind you!&quot; and &quot;Oh, no, you  don't!&quot; Adults transported to
childhood in a matter of moments -- but that's the  craft of Lindsay's magic.
Fond memories spread across the floor -- the passionate  and dramatic, Lindsay's
shows in photo form. We carefully put them all back in  their boxes, a farewell
dance and a big kiss goodbye.&quot; 
</P>
<P>This is all particularly appropriate since Kate had by this time begun a
shift from  performance-style videos, which clearly bore the mark of Kemp's
inspiration,  towards more film-inspired videos. 
</P>
<P>&quot;My videos are more film-influenced now. When I first started making
videos, I  was so obviously theatrically and dance-influenced. A lot of that was
from Lindsay  Kemp and dance teachers with whom I had been working. Gradually
the more  involved I got in video, the process of making films, the more I've
swung around to  filmmaking. It's a beautiful discipline, dance, and it can be
lovely, but I guess I'm  getting for more into filmmaking now.&quot;

</P>
<P>ANNOTATIONS 
</P>
<P>MOVING 
</P>
<P>Words and Music By Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The sounds heard during the beginning and end of the song are &quot;whale
song&quot;, the  sounds made by whales underwater. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Whales say everything about 'moving'. It's huge and beautiful,
intelligent, soft  inside a tough body. It weighs a ton and yet it's so light it
floats. It's the whole thing  about human communication - 'moving liquid, yet
you are just as water' - what the  chinese say about being the cup the water
moves in to. The whales are pure  movement and pure sound, calling for
something, so lonely and sad...&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;On the ground they're ppff (splodging sound), but in the water they're
 'wahoo!' Which is the way with a lot of dancers.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Kate, Sounds, 1980 
</P>
<P> Moving stranger, does it really matter? <BR> As long as you're not afraid
to feel <BR> Touch me, hold me, how my open arms ache <BR> Try to fall for me 
</P>
<P>It could be that here Kate is asking Kemp to try to &quot;fall&quot; for her
in spite of his  homosexuality. She seems to say that his sexual preference
shouldn't really matter  as long as he's not afraid to have feelings for her.
With this interpretation, the above  lines would read like this &quot;Beautiful
dancer, What difference does my gender  make?/If you can feel my love?/Touch me,
hold me, How I long for you./Try to fall  in love with me too.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Note that there is no evidence for this interpretion, aside from the fact
that Kate  has said the song is for Kemp. 
</P>
<P>(Chorus) <BR> How I'm moved, how you move me <BR> With your beauty's
potency <BR> You give me life, please don't let me go <BR> You crush the lily
in my soul 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's [the song's] a complete evocation of the movement of the dancer,
speaking  with his limbs, sense through sensuality, as sexy as his 'beauty's
potency', the  dancer and the watcher in harmony like lovers.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Kate, Sounds, 1980 
</P>
<P>The lily has long been considered a symbol of purity, innocence or more 
specifically the Virgin Mary (ref. Barbara Walker's The Woman's Encyclopedia of 
Myths and Secrets and Stephen Friar's A Dictionary of Heraldry ). From this we 
can conclude that she is at least saying, &quot;You stir passion in me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Some might take the metaphor further and say that this is her first
experience  with this sort of passion -- the deflowering of her soul, if you
will. The passion  found in songs known to have been written well before Moving
, Passing Through  Air for example, would seem to refute this. 
</P>
<P>Moving liquid, yes, you are just as water <BR> You flow around all that
comes in your way <BR> Don't think it over, it always takes you over <BR> And
sets your spirit dancing 
</P>
<P> Here Kate seems to compare both Kemp's movements and personality with 
water. Not only are his movements fluid but apparently Kemp has a certain grace 
and charm, perhaps a tao-like non-resistance. 
</P>
<P>(Chorus) 
</P>
<P>How I'm moved, how you move me <BR> With your beauty's potency <BR> You
give me life, please don't let me go <BR> You crush the lily in my soul

<P>SAXOPHONE SONG 
</P>
<P>HISTORY 
</P>
<P>Saxophone Song appeared for the first time on The Kick Inside , Kate's first
 release. This is the only official release of this song. The song was recorded
well  before rest of the album and is believed to have also been known as Berlin
in it's  early stages. 
</P>
<P>The Kick Inside.....................EMC 3223......02/17/78 <BR> The Kick
Inside (picture disc).....EMPC 3223......02/17/78 
</P>
<P>BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>&quot; Saxophone Song is one of Kate's earliest compositions. She made the
final  recording, exactly as it was released, in 1975, when she was 16 or 17,
and there were  no later changes. Its subject is pretty self- explanatory,
though perhaps it should be  said for the record that Kate had never been to
Berlin, so far as anyone is aware! She  probably wrote the song about the same
time as The Man With the Child in His  Eyes , which is to say when she was about
14.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Andrew Marvick 
</P>
<P>While the song does seem to be self explanatory, Kate's fans know that her 
songs can often be far more then they seem. In the third issue of the Kate Bush 
Club newsletter (November 1979) a fan asked Kate if Saxophone Song was written 
about David Bowie. Kate replied: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The song isn't about David Bowie. I wrote it about the instrument, not
the  player, at a time when I really loved the sound of the saxophone -- I still
do.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One might find reason to be skeptical that the song is about the instrument
and  not the player since the lyrics repeatedly address the sax player in the
second  person. Kate's remarks in an EMI Records press kit make the intent of
the song  somewhat more clear. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wrote The Saxophone Song [sic] because, for me, the saxophone is a
truly  amazing instrument. Its sound is very exciting -- rich and mellow. It
sounds like a  female.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Kate, EMI Music Talk 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes chord structures make you think of a place... and I love
saxophones  so I wanted to write a song about them. I think of a beautiful sax
like a human  being, a sensuous shining man being taken over by the instrument.
The perfect  setting was this smokey bar in Berlin with nobody listening except
me in a corner,  the streams of light flashing off it to me, pa pa (explosion
noises). 
</P>
<P>In the song she is a 'surly lady in tremor... You'll never know you had all
of  me.' Mike suggested that Freud would have made a meal of this one too, and
this  time, as she's fond of phrasing it, she broke through the barrier. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm very basic,&quot; she said. &quot;I wasn't thinking of it as
phallic when I wrote the  song, but I do now when I see a sax player. I feel as
if everyone understood the real  things I'm saying, it wouldn't be much good, it
wouldn't help me. If it seems  harmless on the surface that's all right. I don't
want to upset people who don't  want to know. There are enough people, thank
God, who have seen it. They're  listening with their hearts. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The sax is a very sexual sound, all vibrating, resonating - like
bowels. Look at  photos of musicians playing any instruments and it could be
interpreted... it's not  always sexual, but mainly. You are cuddling the
instrument, you are seducing each  other. Guitarists are up there so obviously
waking with their guitars, but it's open,  beautiful, it's at a love level.&quot;

</P>
<P>- Kate, Sounds, 1980 
</P>
<P>So there can be little doubt that the saxophone player in Saxophone Song is
just a  character in a story that Kate is telling to express her feelings about
the sound of a  saxophone. While some think that the player's role is simply
that of a musician who  can stir the soul with the sound of his saxophone,
others believe that the protagonist  does have feelings for the player. It may
be that these feelings have been aroused by  the sound of his saxophone. 
</P>
<P>In portraying the rich, mellow, feminine nature of the saxophone Kate
virtually  creates a third character in her story. Some suggest that Kate might
even be creating  a symbolic love triangle between her three characters. 
</P>
<P>All of this may relate to Kate's view of art. &quot;Don't you think Art is a
 tremendous sensual-sexual expression? I feel that energy often...the driving
force is  probably not the right way to put it,&quot; said Kate in a November
1989 interview with Q  magazine. 
</P>
<P>Saxophone Song is also interesting because it shows Kate's remarkable
ability to  create atmosphere with her words, music and vocals even at a very
early stage in her  career. 
</P>
<P>In 1980 Kate wrote a some brief remarks to accompany the sheet-music
published  in the book The Best of Kate Bush . On Saxophone Song she comments, &quot;All
the  people in the club are babbling, but the instrument is talking, and I can
but listen.&quot; 
</P>
<P>ANNOTATIONS 
</P>
<P> SAXOPHONE SONG 
</P>
<P>Words and Music By Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The sounds heard during the beginning of the song are &quot;whale song&quot;,
the sounds  made by whales underwater. These sounds are also heard at the
beginning and end  of the previous track, Moving , and continue into the
introduction of Saxophone  Song. 
</P>
<P>You'll find me in a Berlin bar <BR> In a corner, brooding 
</P>
<P>We note here that Kate's character is brooding. A variety of explanations
have  been suggested for this. It could be that she knows that she can never
really have the  object of her desires because she loves him not for who he is
but for the music that  he creates. Perhaps it is because of the virtual love
triangle that some feel is being  suggested between herself, the player and the
instrument. 
</P>
<P>It may be that the reason is completely unrelated to the song itself but
that it  serves to show that the sound of the saxophone can touch her no matter
what her  mood. 
</P>
<P> You know that I go very quiet <BR> When I am listening to you <BR>
There's something special indeed <BR> In all the places where I've seen you
shine, boy <BR> There's something very real in how I feel, honey 
</P>
<P> Here she seems to tell how the musician and his saxophone make her feel.
She  seems to be saying that these feelings are not just the those of simply
enjoying the  music but that there is something &quot;special&quot; and &quot;very
real&quot; in these feelings. Those  who love Kate's music can certainly
empathize with this with this. 
</P>
<P> (Chorus) <BR> It's in me, it's in me - and you know it's for real<BR> 
Tuning in your saxophone <BR> Daba-daba-doo 
</P>
<P> The candle burning over your shoulder <BR> Is throwing shadows on your
saxophone <BR> A surly lady in tremor 
</P>
<P> Here Kate develops the metaphor of the lady and the saxophone. The
saxophone  is referred to as &quot;A surly lady in tremor&quot;. Some have
suggested that this is  specifically comparing the sound of the saxophone to the
sensual singing voice of  woman. In this case, &quot;in tremor&quot; may be
referring to the tremolo of such a voice. 
</P>
<P>A few have noted that &quot;A surly lady in tremor&quot; suggests a woman in
orgasm and  the sounds that she might make. These might be compared both to a
sensual singing  voice and to the feminine sound of the saxophone. 
</P>
<P>The stars that climb from her bowels <BR> Those stars that make towers on
vowels. 
</P>
<P>Evidently these &quot;stars&quot; are the sounds that the saxophone and the &quot;lady
in  tremor&quot; make. 
</P>
<P> You'll never know that you had all of me <BR> You'll never see the poetry
you stirred in me <BR> Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly <BR>
I've never known or felt, inside myself, so rightly <BR> (Chorus) 
</P>
<P> One might consider these final four verses to be a capsule summary of the
entire  song. They seem to express not only the deep feelings that the player
and his  saxophone have stirred in the listener, but also that the musician and
the instrument  will never know of these feelings, either because they will
never meet or because  the feelings themselves are to deep to describe.

</P>
<P>The chant &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot; (or however you spell this) does
indeed mean  &quot;Hail the jewel in the lotus&quot;. And it is indeed a sexual
reference, and something very  worthy of hailing. Those Indians shure are horny
buggers, ain't they? 
</P>
<P>&quot;G.&quot; is not Gurdjieff. Why would Gurdjieff be coming over to
Kate's pad? &quot;G.&quot; is  most likely David Gilmour.

<BR> Subject: Om Mani Padme Hum 
</P>
<P>Ah! Finally a topic I can contribute about... 
</P>
<P>Although I personally recite &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot; 108 times each
morning as  part of my Buddhist thing, I scarcely remember wondering about its
literal meaning.  &quot;Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus&quot; is probably right,
but hearing it referred to gives you  a chance to muse on more than its
translation... 
</P>
<P>It is the personal mantra, according to the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan
Buddhism, of  Chenresig, the Goddess of Compassion. She/he is also known by the
names  Avaloketisvara towards India and Kuan-Yin towards China. Since the rise
in Tibet of  the Gelugpa sect around the 15th century, and since the Dalai Lama
is recognised as  one of the living incarnations of Chenresig, &quot;Om mani
padme hum&quot; is the national  mantra of Tibet. Travelers there find it on
prayer wheels, prayer flags, and painted  or carved on mountainsides near towns.

</P>
<P>I have our beloved KaTe to thank for hearing its correct pronounciation for
the  very first time...

<P>Who or what is G? Well, as any girl knows :), G is short for &quot;George&quot;
which is a  colloquialism (big word) for &quot;period&quot;. Hence the line &quot;G
arrives, funny had a feeling  he was on his way&quot;, thus making Strange
Phenomena the first song about PMS :) 
</P>
<P>I think this interpretation also makes sense in the light of the rest of the
song,  which talks about the phases of the moon (supposed to influence menstrual
cycles),  the &quot;blues&quot;, and more generally the forces of nature over
which we have no control.

</P>
<P>Re the mysterious &quot;G&quot; in Strange Phenomena: &quot;George&quot; was
the term that was  used in my family (English) and also by a lot of people I
went to school with. When  I heard the song &quot;G&quot; made perfect sense in
the context. I note from another posting  (sorry, I didn't copy it so I don't
know who it was) that Kate Bush in an interview  said that &quot;G&quot; was a &quot;Mr.
G. who we all knew&quot; (or words to that effect). This doesn't  exactly prove
the &quot;George theory&quot;, but on the other hand it doesn't disprove it 
outright either. Hmm.....

</P>
<P>I've been away for two weeks, so I missed all the hoo-ha after my posting
about  Strange Phenomena (and here you thought I was just waiting to see what
you all  came up with :) ) 
</P>
<P>TO be more precise, I would certainly agree that the song is not completely
about  menstruation, but the idea is present in more than the line about &quot;the
punctual  blues&quot;. The moon imagery ties in (since the moon is supposed to
regulate menstrual  cycles, much as it does ocean waves and other natural, uh,
phenomena). On the  whole, I would say the song is about being part of natural
forces that you don't quite  understand but which unite you with the rest of the
world in different ways - and  one of these is participating (involuntarily :) )
in that special monthly event. 
</P>
<P>(The &quot;G&quot; reference I took to be a reference to &quot;George&quot;,
a British term for  &quot;period&quot; (&quot;George has arrived&quot; means
you've got it), but I know that Kate herself  hasn't explained it as such&quot;).

<P>KITE 
</P>
<P>I don't remember what KaTe has said about this, but to me, this song seems
to  be metaphorically referring to drugs. The first verse expresses the desire
to escape  from mundane life, the next describes apparently surreal experiences
(&quot;I got no  limbs and I'm like a feather on the wind&quot; - Ok, so they're
all kite metaphors as  well...but hidden double metaphors are KaTe's speciality,
aren't they? 8^) and the  last suggests regret and inability to revert to normal
life: &quot;And I'd like to be back on  the ground/But I don't know how to get
down&quot; -addiction of course! And there's  the old cliche &quot;high as a
kite&quot; too. 
</P>
<P>Oh, and (tenuous link) speaking of songs of the Tour of Life era, has
anybody else  noticed that in the bit in the Hammersmith video, after Feel It,
where Simon Drake  walks across the stage, he's leafing through a girly
magazine? That must have raised  a few eyebrows of people reading the props

</P>
<P>&gt; From: Jon Drukman 
</P>
<P>&gt; OH yes, One very important KT question for anyone still reading: Is it
really  true (as |&gt;oug claims) that &quot;James And The Cold Gun&quot; live
from the &quot;On Stage&quot; and  &quot;Kate Bush&quot; EPs is the SAME version
in the Hammermsmith Odeon video?? It  doesn't seem like it... 
</P>
<P>I never thought they were, and a little comparative listening proved it to
me. First,  the EP version has a piano intro, where the video doesn't. The drum
flurry  following the opening chords are not the same. Then, the first verse on
the video  starts 4 bars later than in the EP ( try playing the EP soundtrack
over the video to  see this). Also, the inflection in Kate's voice in the
opening word &quot;James..&quot; is much  different, as is her inflection
throughout much of the song. I didn't bother to go  much further to prove the
differences. There are enough differences to conclude  even that one is not a
re-mix of the other, unless a whole new vocal track was  recorded after the
filming and much revision done to the EP mix. 
</P>
<P>I remember seeing |&gt;oug's claim that the EP was recorded at Hammersmith 
Odeon. My EP doesn't say where it was recorded (mine is the Harvest 12&quot;).
My copy  of the Hammersmith tape says that there were two shows done at
Hammersmith,  one of which (13 May 1979) was filmed. There are enough
differences, however, for  me to speculate that the EP was recorded at a much
different point in the tour.

</P>
<P> The Kick Inside (the song) was inspired by an old English/Irish ballad
(there are  more than a dozen versions with origins in many parts of Europe)
called Lizzie Wan  or Lizie Wan or Lucy Wan. The traditional song is about a
sister and her incestuous  love for her brother. It includes (in some versions)
the line &quot;When the sun and the  moon meet on yon hill&quot;. As far as IED
can tell, however, the subject and that specific  line are the only connections
between Kate's song and the original ballad. There are  no musical links that
his ears can identify.

</P>
<P>&gt; In your transcription of the lyrics of The Kick Inside, you give the
lines &quot;Your  sister I was born. Lose me. /You must lose me like an arrow.&quot;
To my ear this is  &quot;loose me like an arrow.&quot; The meaning is very
different. &quot;Lose me&quot; implies  carelessness. &quot;Loose me&quot;
implies purposefulness. If this point has been debated to  death in Love-Hounds
I apologize, I haven't been reading it for very long. 
</P>
<P>&gt;-- Steve Jacquot 
</P>
<P> Thanks for your note of appreciation, Steve. 
</P>
<P>I was extremely intrigued by your suggestion about the line &quot;lose me
like an  arrow&quot; from The Kick Inside. I feel a little stupid that the
parallel with &quot;loose an  arrow&quot; had not occurred to me in all my
eleven years of familiarity with this song.  Of course you're right that Kate
had &quot;loose&quot; in mind! 
</P>
<P>The spelling in all the official editions of the lyrics has always been &quot;lose&quot;.
Two  explanations are possible: first, that she meant &quot;loose&quot; and just
didn't know how to  spell it; second, that she meant to evoke the image of &quot;loosing
an arrow&quot; while  sticking to the storyline, in which the brother must &quot;lose&quot;
her sister. While admitting  the possibility that the former explanation is
correct, I can't help feeling that Kate  was deliberately spelling &quot;lose&quot;
but using it in such a way as to recall &quot;loose&quot;--she  has often used
puns and other plays on words in her lyrics, and this would be just  like her.
But you're certainly right that it looks as though, one way or another, she  did
have the expression &quot;loose an arrow&quot; in mind. Thanks again.

</P>
<P>From: Jorn Barger <BR> &gt; Kick Inside questions: [...] What's this about
Zeus? and &quot;the old mythology  he'd read&quot;? What does the expression &quot;well
in touch&quot; mean? 
</P>
<P>She's saying she'll be &quot;well in touch&quot; with Zeus because she'll be
dead. In  Greek mythology Zeus was the head-honcho of the gods. I doubt that
most dead  souls got to talk to Zeus, but the dying character clearly has some
hopes of grandeur.  Why does she bring up this mythology? Because when she was a
child, she and her  brother would be read mythology while sitting on the bobbing
knee of their father  (or grandfather, or whatever), and she's recalling that
childhood memory -- like  Rosebud. You get the idea.

</P>
<P>2. It is time for you to weep, <BR> Lamenting and a-making your mourn.
<BR> Here's a babe at my right side, <BR> And it is both mine and yourn. 
</P>
<P>3. O what will you do when your father comes home? <BR> Dear son, come tell

over the sea. 
</P>
<P>4. O what will you do with your house and land? <BR> Dear son, come tell to
me. <BR> I'll leave it here, my old, dear mother; <BR> Be kind to my children
three. 
</P>
<P>5. O what will you do with your pretty, little wife? <BR> Dear son, come
tell to me. <BR> She can set her foot in another little ship <BR> And follow
after me. 
</P>
<P>6. Back home, back home will you return? <BR> Dear son, come tell to me.
<BR> When the sun and the moon sets in yon hill, <BR> And I hope that'll never
be.

<P>He took her by the lily-white hand <BR> And he led her into the woods;
<BR> What he did there, I never can declare, <BR> But he spilt Fair Lucy's
blood. 
</P>
<P>&quot;O, what is that upon your frock, <BR> My son, come tell to me.&quot;
