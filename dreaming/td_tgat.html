Goes a  Tenner,&quot; part of the song goes: 
</P>
<P>Both my partners <BR> Act like actors. <BR> You are Bogart; <BR> He is
George Raft. <BR> That leaves Cagney and me.  (What about Edward G?) 
</P>
<P>Who is this &quot;Edward G&quot;? Is he some person portrayed by Cagney?

<BR> Subject: Who'd they use to vote for? 
</P>
<P> Consider the last lines of &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;: 
</P>
<P>&quot;There's a ten-shilling note, <BR> Remember them? <BR> That's when we
used to vote for him.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Now I assume that the ten-shilling note became obsolete when Britain moved
to  decimal currency, hence &quot;remember them&quot;. But who is it that they
used to vote for?  The guy whose picture appears on the ten-shilling note? (not
bloody likely) Some  politician associated with decimalization (oops sorry, &quot;decimalisation&quot;)?
The prime  minister at some time before decimalisation -- possibly when the
criminals were less  disillusioned about the political process? (OK, OK, maybe
that's stretching it) 
</P>
<P>[Believe it or not, |&gt;oug has spent many a sleepless night pondering this
very  question. Unfortunately, even John Carder Bush did not know who &quot;him&quot;
is, when I  asked him about it. Maybe if I ever get to interview Kate again...

<P>I have interpreted Kate's heavy emphasis on the word &quot;him&quot; to mean
&quot;*him* as  opposed to *her*&quot;, but I never checked the timing of the
taping of The Dreaming  against even the grossest of milestones in recent
British political history, e.g., the rise  of Margaret Thatcher. Even so, as far
as I know, her era started long after the  conversion to decimal currency, so if
my interpretation is correct, then so is Kate's  observation.

GMT <BR> Subject: Re: Who'd they use to vote for? 
</P>
<P>Well, here's an approximate timeline (sorry if I get something wrong,
British  politics isn't exactly my specialty): 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>1964	Harold Wilson (Labour) becomes prime minister 
</LI>
<LI>1967	Decimal Currency Act (or some similar name) passed 
</LI>
<LI>1970	Edward Heath (Conservative) becomes prime minister 
</LI>
<LI>1971	Enactment of the Decimal Currency Act 
</LI>
<LI>1974	Wilson becomes prime minister 
</LI>
<LI>1976	Wilson resigns; Jim Callaghan (Labour) becomes prime minister 
</LI>
<LI>1979	Margaret Thatcher (Conservative) becomes prime minister 
</LI>
<LI>1982	Kate Bush releases The Dreaming 	(presumably written over the past
year or two) 
</LI></UL>
<P>My guess is that Kate was referring to Wilson -- he was prime minister when 
the currency act was passed, he led the Labour party for many years (anyone know
 Kate's politics?), and he was prime minister shortly before Thatcher
(supporting  David's theory above). At one time, he (and Labour) were very
popular -- perhaps  Kate is referring to the disillusionment many people had
with Labour in the 70's,  leading to the election of Margaret Thatcher. &quot;That's
when we used to vote for him&quot;  implies that &quot;we&quot; vote for someone
else now.

<P>From: Neil Calton &lt;nbc@vd.rl.ac.uk&gt; <BR> Date: Tue, 16 Jun 87
12:13:48 bst <BR> Subject: That Vote 
</P>
<P>This last line really is driving me crazy. 
</P>
<P>What is it doing in the song? How does it fit in with the rest of the
lyrics? The  suggestions put forward by Andy and David are interesting but I
wonder whether  Kate intended such a precise meaning. Also, I'm not sure that &quot;heavy
emphasis&quot;  adequately describes the way the word `him' is sung - it
certainly is not strong  enough to clearly suggest an antithesis to *she*. 
</P>
<P>The Thatcher versus Wilson interpretation does not fit easily in with the
tone of  the rest of the song: such a subtle piece of political observation just
feels out of place  with the underlying theme. And why should a bunch of
criminals care about who  they voted for; and it is hard to see them now voting
for Mrs T. (though come to  think of it most of her cabinet seem to be a bunch
of crooks). 
</P>
<P>Further, in our General Election (unlike your Presidential Election) we do
not  vote for a prime minister but for a local MP. Only the voters in Finchley
can actually  cast their vote for Maggie. Of course indirectly if we vote Tory
then we help to put  Mrs T. in number 10. At the time TD came out Thatcher
(barely into the third year  of her first term) had not achieved her iron
lady/world stateswoman image. Being  relatively early in her `reign' she was
just another leader who happened to be a  woman (granted a rare example). At
that stage one was more likely to say &quot;vote for  them&quot; meaning the
Tory or Labour party rather than &quot;him&quot; or &quot;her&quot; meaning a 
particular leader. However, Kate had used the word &quot;them&quot; to end the
previous line  and repeating it would have been aesthetically unpleasing. 
</P>
<P>If Kate had written those lyrics this year then I would more readily embrace
the  viewpoint that Thatcher is being obliquely refered to, as she is now a very
powerful  icon in the British political arena. It would still leave me wondering
on the  relationship of the last line to the underlying themes. If like the
references to old  banknotes it is purely a nostalgic remembrance of the past,
is it the robber or Kate  who is expressing this thought? As I've said I cannot
fathom why the gang member  could care greatly about the political past. If that
last line is Kate interjecting her  own memories does that mean she now votes
for Maggie (surely not!) when she  previously voted for Wilson or possibly
Heath? (You'll notice there are a lot of  questions in this piece and very few
answers). 
</P>
<P>Personally, I think the decimalisation issue is a red herring: after all, by
my  reckoning, Kate was 13 when it was introduced and why should any politician 
involved in its introduction have had any impact on her. I cannot remember
anything  noteworthy about D-day as it was called. Perhaps, Kate used to vote
for a local  politician called Bob Note! :-) Oh well, maybe she'll tell us the
real answer one day.  Personally, I'd be content for someone to adequately
explain why that last line is  there at all. It must have some significance.
Help!

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: There goes a Tenner
</P>
<P>IED is afraid he can do nothing to solve this problem, but it seems unlikely
to him  that the reference to &quot;him&quot; is Kate's own personal &quot;aside&quot;,
so to speak. This would  be totally out of keeping with her method of sinking
her spirit into the characters  and story in her song. It's much more likely
that it's a nostalgic remark by the  leader of the burglars. 
</P>
<P>&gt; As I've said, I cannot fathom why the gang member could care greatly
about  the political past. 
</P>
<P>Remember, though, that this is no hardened gang of criminals. IED has always
 understood the song to be about a group of friends who are performing a crime 
without prior experience, stepping into the underworld for the first time. Quite
 possibly, they really ARE &quot;actors&quot;, as the lyrics say. Whatever their
background, it's  apparently unusual enough for burglars to make it seem
possible for one of them to  have untypical memories, etc. It's odd, though: If
her British fans can't understand  the reference, then Kate couldn't have
expected anyone else at all to follow it. She  does this alont, you know?

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: There Goes A Tenner 
</P>
<P>The following are a series of unconnected reflections on Matterse Katte 
Bushologicke which IED originally sent off to individual victims, mainly MarK T.
 Ganzer. This explains the author's peculiar (for him) references to a
non-existent  &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. Please disregard those. 
</P>
<P>Dear MarK. 
</P>
<P>As I'm sure you're aware by now, I'm in the midst of making a new 
transcription of the complete lyrics, emphasizing their narrative side, and I've
finally  gotten almost all the way through. 
</P>
<P>I can't get over how terrific Kate's lyrics are. The biggest eye-opener so
far has  come out of my feeble attempts to re-structure the lines' break-off
points by trying  to keep stricter ties with the musical structure -- something
which none of the  earlier transcribers has ever managed with any consistency.
In doing this, I've been  gaining a new appreciation of the complexities of the
song-structures. 
</P>
<P>There are very few songs -- even including the early ones --which follow a 
conventional verse-chorus pattern. Almost all of the songs include a third, &quot;bridge&quot;
 component, and there isn't a single song that doesn't involve a significant 
re-organization of the verses' original rhythms and melodic lines in later
verses.  This is completely at odds with the tendency in pop music in general,
where  virtually all songs follow a simple verse-chorus pattern (once in a while
adding a  radically shortened and usually instrumental bridge interlude), and
where the  melodic line or the lyric metre is rarely altered by so much as a
note or a syllable. In  Kate's recent songs her shifts and additions are so
significant that the job of figuring  out where one verse ends and another
begins becomes quite difficult. 
</P>
<P>Take &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I've just made what I think is a real breakthrough (for me, anyway)
interpreting  the lyrics of this song. For years I had been confused about what
actually happened  to the burglars after the safe blew up and the narrator found
herself covered in  rubble. The problem was that if the gang had been caught,
then how come in the  end they seemed to be enjoying the money? I now think that
the answer is very  simple, and I wish I'd seen it earlier. 
</P>
<P>The whole song is about WAITING. &quot;We're waiting, we're waiting.&quot;
And it's  about REMEMBERING. &quot;Okay, remember;&quot; &quot;I hope you
remember;&quot; &quot;Remember  them?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Here's my new transcription of the lyrics: 
</P>
<P>There Goes a Tenner 
</P>
<P>FIRST VERSE <BR> Okay, remember. <BR> Okay, remember <BR> That we have
just allowed <BR> Half an hour <BR> To get in, do it, and get out. 
</P>
<P> SECOND VERSE <BR> The sense of adventure <BR> Is changing to danger.
<BR> The signal has been given. <BR> I go in. <BR> The crime begins. 
</P>
<P> BRIDGE <BR> My excitement <BR> Turns into fright. <BR> All my words
fade. <BR> What am I gonna say? <BR> Mustn't give the game away. 
</P>
<P> REFRAIN <BR> We're waiting. <BR> We're waiting. <BR> We're waiting.
<BR>
</P>
<P> THIRD VERSE <BR> We got the job sussed. <BR> This shop's shut for
business. <BR> The lookout has parked the car, <BR> But kept the engine
running. <BR> Three beeps means trouble's coming. 
</P>
<P> FOURTH VERSE <BR> I hope you remember <BR> To treat the gelignite
tenderly for me. <BR> I'm having dreams about things <BR> Not going right.
<BR> Let's leave in plenty of time tonight. 
</P>
<P>SECOND BRIDGE <BR> Both my partners <BR> Act like actors: <BR> You are
Bogart, <BR> He is George Raft. <BR> That leaves Cagney and me. 
</P>
<P>REFRAIN <BR> We're waiting. <BR> We're waiting. <BR> We're waiting. 
</P>
<P>FIFTH VERSE <BR> You blow the safe up. <BR> Then all I know is I wake up,
<BR> Covered in rubble. One of the rabble <BR> Needs mummy. <BR> The
government will never find the money. 
</P>
<P> SIXTH VERSE <BR> I've been here all day, <BR> A star in strange ways.
<BR> Apart from a photograph <BR> They'll get nothing from me, <BR> Not until
they let me see my solicitor. 
</P>
<P> SEVENTH VERSE <BR> Ooh, I remember <BR> That rich, windy weather <BR>
When you would carry me, <BR> Pockets floating <BR> In the breeze. 
</P>
<P> EIGHTH VERSE <BR> Ooh, there goes a tenner. <BR> Hey, look! There's a
fiver. <BR> There's a ten-shilling note. <BR> Remember them? <BR> That's when
we used to vote for him. 
</P>
<P> There are actually ten verses, not eight, but to distinguish between the
regular  verses and the two verses that directly precede the refrains (and which
take a  different melody than the regular verses), I've called those two &quot;bridges&quot;.

</P>
<P>In the first and second verses (as I have split them up) the burglars plan
and wait  for the right moment. In the third and fourth verses they make certain
it's safe, and  enter. In the fifth and sixth verses they blow the safe up,
using too much gelignite,  and the narrator is knocked out by the blast. The
noise attracts the police, and the  narrator wakes up in police custody,
separated from her partners and afraid. But she  learns that somehow the money
(which means at least some of the gang, too) have  not been recovered by the
police, and she will never give them away. They'll never  get anything from her
but her mugshot. 
</P>
<P>Then comes more waiting: I think the seventh verse is the narrator's prison 
term. She's in prison remembering. &quot;Ooh, I remember that rich, windy
weather  when you (one of the gang, probably) would carry me (they were kids, I
suspect),  pockets floating in the breeze.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And finally, in the eighth and final verse, she has served her term and been
 released. She meets up with the old gang and they play with the money in the 
wonderful open air which they've been deprived of for so long while in prison. 
</P>
<P>I know that this part doesn't sound too convincing, but I do think that the
trick  to this story is in distinguishing between the time-frame of the seventh
verse and  that of the last, eighth verse: In the seventh, she's not just
remembering, she's  reminiscing --something she'd do if she were in prison and
had ages and ages of  time on her hands. But in the eighth verse, the reference
to &quot;remembering&quot; is not  about the prisoner's idle memories, but about
her experience after her release. 
</P>
<P>She and the gang are &quot;remembering&quot; the ten-shilling note. The
money is no  longer current, which would make sense if she'd had to serve years
in prison before  finally getting her hands on her share of the swag. In other
words, at the time of the  burglary, the ten-shilling note was in circulation,
and the gangsters were imitating  then- current stars of Warner Brothers
gangster pictures: Cagney, Raft, Bogart, etc.  By the end of the song, these are
all history. I suppose many people will have  realised all this long ago, but
it's new to me. 
</P>
<P>I see that it's still not an airtight reading, but what I like about it is
that it  provides an explanation for the apparent fact that (in the video),
though the gang are  arrested, in the end they are nevertheless shown tearing
through the streets with  the money and laughing, as though they had really
pulled off the heist after all. 
</P>
<P> [|&gt;oug thinks that IED's interpretation of the seventh and eighth verse
are  incorrect. He thinks that it is fairly clear that at the end of the song
Kate is in jail  and that she is reminiscing about better days, when she wasn't
paying the price for  her criminal acts, but rather enjoying her ill-gotten
gains. -- |&gt;oug ] 
</P>
<P>To add more fuel to the theory that the burglary took place in the 
nineteen-thirties, I have just discovered what inspired Kate's use of the
looming  shadow of the Bobby's profile which appears in the video concurrent
with the  spoken line &quot;What's all this, then?&quot; 
</P>
<P>I was re-watching Hitchcock's The Thirty-Nine Steps, which has been showing 
on the Z Channel in L.A. this week. It is such a happy, magical film. Anyway, I
was  duly noting all the images that Kate referred to in the Hounds of Love
video (the  lovers linked by handcuffs, the chase by foot over the moors at
night, the  danger-amid-the-unknowing-crowd-at-a-party scenes, etc.). All of a
sudden, at the  very climax of the film, there was the Bobby's silhouette,
exactly the way it appears  in &quot;Tenner&quot;, except that in Kate's video
the Bobby's hat moves a bit. The derivation  from Hitchcock was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>I've had quite a run of similarly fortuitous, minor but exciting little
discoveries  recently. Finding the lyrics and music to &quot;The Two Magicians&quot;
and The Ballad of  Lucy Wan&quot;; hearing Edna O'Brien on the radio last week
(her Irish accented voice,  which JCB said they had originally wanted for the
reading of the poem in Jig of Life,  was exactly the same nearly-&quot;BBC&quot;-English-accent-with-just-a-trace-of-Irish-
 lilt-to-it that John used in the recording); the discovery of the original &quot;Auntie
 Hetty&quot; in an episode of The Avengers ; and now all this stuff about There
Goes a  Tenner. 
</P>
<P>It's exciting, but it's also a bit worrying, because it implies that there's
a  similarly clear solution to all of the other countless mysteries to Kate's
work, which  we'll probably never know unless someone just happens to stumble on
them in the  same way.

<P>&gt; |&gt;oug thinks that IED's interpretation of the seventh and eighth
verse are  incorrect. He thinks that it is fairly clear that at the end of the
song Kate is in jail  and that she is reminiscing about better days, when she
wasn't paying the price for  her criminal acts, but rather enjoying her
ill-gotten gains. -- |&gt;oug 
</P>
<P> But that's just the problem, |&gt;oug: It's not &quot;fairly clear,&quot;
at all. You're entitled to  your opinion, of course, but how do you account for
the inconsistencies between the  end of the song and the film? At least IED has
found a way to reconcile most of the  details from each, and without stretching
the meaning of the words, either. 
</P>
<P> [There aren't any inconsistencies between the end of the video and the end
of  the song. Both are flashbacks to better times. That's precisely why the
flashback  begins with &quot;Ooh, I remember&quot;, and the video at this point
is in sepia. -- |&gt;oug ] 
</P>
<P> Also, your interpretation assumes that the gang were experienced thieves
who  had successfully robbed before, whereas the implication in both the song
and the  video is that this is a first-time job by a group of amateurs. So what
earlier  &quot;ill-gotten gains&quot; would she be reminiscing about? 
</P>
<P> [ No implication is given whatsoever that this is a first-time job by a
group of  amateurs. All that is said is that the narrator feels nervous, and
that things this night  go tragically wrong. But remember that Kate believes
strongly in premonitions.  Besides, who says that one can't be nervous even if
they have robbed a hundred  banks? -- |&gt;oug ] 
</P>
<P> On the other hand, there's the end of the video, and the very odd
phenomenon  of the gang running down a street, as adults, with smiles on their
faces, amid a rain  of money. This part of the film is in sepia, which might
support your theory that the  scene represents an incident from the gang's
earlier days. 
</P>
<P>Except for the facts that the lyrics themselves 
</P>
<P>1.) describe the same scene in the present tense; 
</P>
<P> [ The flashback begins with &quot;Ooh, I remember&quot; and continues until
the end of  the song. The tense switches to present as the narrator gets more
engrossed in it.  The part that begins &quot;Ooh, there goes a tenner&quot; is
CLEARLY part of the flashback!  First she says &quot;I remeber when you would
carry me and money floated in the  breeze.&quot; Then she becomes more engrossed
in the reverie and switches to the  historical present tense, saying, &quot;Ooh,
look at the money floating by!&quot; How could it  be any clearer??? -- |&gt;oug
] 
</P>
<P>and 
</P>
<P>2.) draw great attention to the anachronism of the obsolete ten-shilling
note. 
</P>
<P>These two facts seem to indicate that the narrator is having a sort of Rip
Van  Winkle-like experience, very like that of a prisoner who has finished her
term and  is talking with friends about their now out-dated loot. If she were
merely imagining  all this, or remembering an earlier incident while still in
prison, such details would  make no sense. 
</P>
<P> [And why doesn't it make sense? It makes perfect sense. Why can't memories 
have detail? You'll have to argue better than this, Andrew! In any case, I don't
think  that Kate is in jail yet by the end of the song. I think she has just
woken up at the  scene of the crime. She wakes up covered in rubble as all the
police surround her.  The explosion has sent money flying all over the place,
and as some bills float by in a  draft (there must now be a hole in the
building), she daydreams back to some time  in the past when her life was
wonderful -- when perhaps they were actually playing  with money they had gotten
from a heist - throwing it in the air and laughing at  their conspicuous
consumption of letting money fly away on the wind. -- |&gt;oug ] 
</P>
<P> IED never wanted to present his interpretation as fact. Clearly the song's 
storyline still holds mysteries. But |&gt;oug, your interpretation is certainly
no less  problematic. 
</P>
<P> [My interpretation isn't problematic in the least. It explains everything
simply,  straightforwardly, and cleanly. -- |&gt;oug ]

<P>&quot;Strangeways&quot; is a prison (in Manchester I think). This is
consistent with the  interpretation of the rest of the verse. In fact, this is
the interpretation I have always  put on that line and assumed Kate did too.

<P>IED adds his name to the list of people thanking Andy Greener for this
terrific  bit of info. Kate does spell the words out &quot;strange ways&quot;,
not &quot;Strangeways&quot;, so she  clearly must have meant the words to bear
two distinct meanings. That's great. Also  great to have another contributing UK

</P>
<P>&gt; Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before, but
Strangeways, Here  We Come - The Smiths recent CD is named after the local
Mental Institution, I  believe in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>Let's clear this up once and for all. I was born and bred in Manchester,
living  there for 21 years, and can definitely tell you that Strangeways is NOT
a mental  institution (where did anyone get that idea from anyway?). It is one
of Her Majesty's  prisons (HMP Strangeways in fact) which was built in the late
19th Century. It is  very overcrowded and conditions are disgusting by most
accounts. It is not a remand  home for youngsters but a run-of-the-mill prison
for male offenders. It happens to  be only a mile out of Manchester (on the
north side - Bury New Road) and is  positioned adjacent to the world(?) famous
Boddington's Brewery. If you've never  had a pint of Boddie's your life hasn't
been worth living! Strangeways is also known  locally by the quaint name of &quot;Strangeways
Motel&quot;. 
</P>
<P>For those who do not know by now, Morrisey (of a little known group called
the  Smiths :-) come's from Manchester, in fact from Whalley Range which is
about 2-3  miles south of the City. I think he would have know that Strangeways
is an ordinary  prison, if not he must have been living under a stone for the
last 20-odd years of his  life. 
</P>
<P>BTW, the local mental institution for the Manchester area is Prestwich
Hospital  (which is nearer Bury actually). Thus any phrase to do with Prestwich
meant that  the poor person was off to the local mental home. 
</P>
<P>I thought that this might clear up the point once and for all.

22:21:23 EDT <BR> Subject: &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; revisited 
</P>
<P>There's a universally held principle that if you have two theories, and all
the  evidence is explained by the two theories, the simpler of the two theories
is to be  prefered. This principle is known as Occam's razor. With regard to &quot;There
Goes A  Tenner&quot;, we have two theories: mine and IED's. Mine is
significantly simpler, and  explains everything. Furthermore, IED's is flawed.
Let's go over them again briefly.  I'm including below the lines that follow
Kate waking up in rubble after the safe  has been blown up. She's apparently
been captured by the police: 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>My theory says that all of the song takes place in the present, except at
the end,  beginning with &quot;Ooh I remember&quot;. Everything after this is a
reverie of better times,  when the burglars lived rich off of their ill-gotten
gains. Sometime in the past, Kate  and her bank-robber lover had pulled off a
successful heist and they celebrated  their success by tossing their money in
the air and watching it float in the breeze.  Kate daydreams about the way
things use to be, while in the present she is probably  being shackled and
photographed by the police. The song ends on the melancholy  and nostalgic note,
&quot;That's when we used to vote for him&quot;. This interpretation is  very
straight-forward, and it makes complete literal sense that what comes after  &quot;Ooh,
I remember&quot; is in the past. 
</P>
<P>IED's theory also says that all of the song is in the present, except the
part  beginning with &quot;Ooh, I remember&quot;. According to IED, everything
inbetween the  lines &quot;Ooh I remember&quot; and &quot;There goes a tenner&quot;
is in the past, long before Kate  became a bank robber, perhaps when Kate was a
child. Then suddenly, beginning  with &quot;There goes a tenner&quot;, without
any indication in the song, we switch to many  years in the future, after Kate
has served her time and has been released from  prison. 
</P>
<P>IED's theory is certainly more complicated. In addition to this, it has
several  flaws. Even if it had no flaws, my theory would be preferable, because
of its  simplicity, but combined with the flawed nature of IED's theory, the
issue should be  clear. These are some of the flaws with IED's theory: 
</P>
<P>(1) There is nothing to indicate the passage of time into the future.
Furthermore,  it seems counterintuitive, considering that it makes perfect sense
that we are still in  the reverie. 
</P>
<P>(2) IED maintains that my theory can't be true because this is Kate's first
bank  robery. However, there is nothing in the song to indicate that this is
Kate's first  bank robbery. Furthermore, the line &quot;Pockets floating in the
breeze&quot; shows that  Kate has been witness to money floating in the wind in
the past. This is true in  either my or IED's theory. Now if IED's theory is
correct, why is there money  floating in the wind when Kate was a child?
Clearly, Kate has burgled in the past. 
</P>
<P>(3) IED maintains that the ending is happy. This would be very
uncharacteristic  of Kate. Kate is not one to tell a story where someone does
something bad and ends  up winning because of it. Kate seems to be a definite
believer in the notion of  Karma. Furthermore, the very ending of the song, &quot;Remember
them? That's when  we used to vote for him?&quot;, is nostalgic. Why would Kate
suddenly get nostalgic if at  the moment, everything is better than ever. She
wouldn't get nostalgic. The only  explanation for this is that the ending is not
all that happy. 
</P>
<P>(4) The video is directly at odds with IED's theory and directly supports my
 theory. The ending of the video, beginning with &quot;Ooh I remember&quot;, is
in sepia. It  stays in sepia until the end of the video. To me, sepia indicates
a flashback. Thus,  everything from &quot;Ooh I remember&quot; until the end of
the song, is a flashback. How  does IED explain why the end of the video is in
sepia? 
</P>
<P>It should be pretty clear by now that IED's theory is untennable.

<P>&gt; [IED:] Your concern is appreciated, Liz. IED doesn't know how |&gt;oug
feels, but  IED harbors no animus toward our Pseudo-Moderator. 
</P>
<P>Well, to be honest, your humble pseudo-moderator harbors animus against the 
entire human race, so don't take it personally. With the exception of only a
handlful  of individuals (like Kate, fer instance), humans are wholy devoid of
redeeming value.  Despite this, humanity is still the most amusing species (in a
sick sort of way) your  humble pseudo-moderator has found so far, with the
exception of the duck-billed  platypus and the Betelgeusean MTV-addicted RF
flatworm, so he supposes he'll let  humanity stay around for a little while
longer before engaging the Orbital Gene  Recycler. 
</P>
<P>&gt; As for |&gt;oug's statement that there's nothing to indicate the
passage of &quot;large  amounts&quot; of time between the verses, IED would like
to know how it is that |&gt;oug  knows the length of time that each of the &quot;We're
waiting&quot; sections are meant to  indicate? 
</P>
<P>Well, for one, there is no &quot;We're waiting&quot; inbetween &quot;My
solicitor&quot; and &quot;Ooh I  remember&quot; or &quot;Pockets floating in the
breeze&quot; and &quot;There goes a tenner&quot;, which are  the only points
where your large amount of time could pass. If the &quot;We're  waiting&quot;'s
were supposed to indicate the passing of large amounts of time, then you  would
expect to find one at the transition point between the two time periods. But 
this just isn't the case. 
</P>
<P>&gt; Would you also maintain, |&gt;oug, that the recurring, highly emphatic
references to  the monotony of waiting cannot have more significance than your
own interpretation  allows? 
</P>
<P>I think that the &quot;We're waiting&quot;'s have critical significance, but
that the  significance is much more straight-forward than you would have it. The
&quot;We're  waiting&quot;'s exist to give a feeling of the horrible sense of
nervousness and  helplessness that must occur during the inevitable periods of
nerve-wracking  waiting that would occur during the process of comitting a
complicated crime such  as a bank robbery.

</P>
<P>&gt; The line I am questioning is &quot;Pockets floating in the breeze.&quot;

</P>
<P>&gt; Ok, let's just think about that for a moment. Anybody here ever watch
cartoons  or old comedies? I didn't think so. Anyway, a person who is trying to
show he has  no cash does what? He *turns out his pockets*. I have always taken
that line to mean  that she was reflecting on a time when she was poor, when
things were simpler,  when there was the time to enjoy each other and the
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>I suppose this is possible, but keep in mind that &quot;pockets&quot; also
has the slang  meaning of paper money. Consider the fact that &quot;Pockets
floating in the breeze&quot;  immediatelly precedes the line &quot;There goes a
tenner&quot;. This definitely pushes the  meaning of &quot;pockets&quot; towards
paper money. Furthermore, in the Razmatazz video of  &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;,
as Kate sings these lines, there is paper money &quot;floating in  the breeze&quot;.
Also, if the meaning of pockets was suppose to be &quot;the things in your 
pants that hold small items&quot;, then one would expect the line to be &quot;Pockets
flapping  in the breeze&quot;. Also, the image of Kate's pockets flapping in the
breeze is a little  strained. Why would her pockets be turned inside out? This
song is not in the  comedy or cartoon genre. It is in the gangster movie genre.

Subject: there goes a tenner one more time 
</P>
<P>Jonathan S. Drukman: 
</P>
<P>&gt; Well, my flatmate says that :&gt;oug is correct in that most of this is
anticipating the  incipient capture. I don't know though... What I find most
puzzling is this verse: 
</P>
<P>&gt; My excitement / turns into fright (present tense - during the job) All
my words  fade / what am I gonna say / mustn't give the game away 
</P>
<P>&gt; Now look at that verse. The first couplet appears to be during the job,
right?  But the last triplet doesn't fit in with that. Why are her words fading
(and what  does it mean anyway)? And if this is still the job, who is she going
to give the game  away to ? My flatmate suggests that Kate's belief in psychic
phenomena means that  she's getting a vibe from the future anticipating her
capture. 
</P>
<P> My idea about the &quot;fading&quot; words is that it's just another aspect
of the lines  &quot;What am I gonna say?/Mustn't give the game away&quot;. As I
see it, the heroine,  imagining herself in custody, is about to confess, but at
the crucial moment her  &quot;words fade&quot;, and she stops talking -- but she
worries about what story she's going  to give instead. Then she comes to a
decision: &quot;They'll get nothing from me/Not  until they let me see/My
solicitor.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now all this is certainly awkward, and it's also made muddier by a line from
 Kate's own poetic &quot;description&quot; of the song, which appeared in an old
Newsletter. In  it Kate writes: 
</P>
<P> &quot;Everybody synchronize watches. Remember there's only half an hour to
do the  job. We've been rehearsing for weeks, so nothing should go wrong. Let's
run  through it one more time: 
</P>
<P> &quot;I go in and distract the guard, <BR> Frank's out the back in the
getaway car, <BR> The sign on the door turns from open to shut, <BR> We keep
them all covered, you blow the safe up, <BR> We grab the cash, make a hasty
retreat, <BR> And tear across London using the backstreets. <BR> Remember, be
careful, give nothing away, <BR> The arm of the Law is as long as they say.&quot;

</P>
<P>You notice in that last couplet: &quot;Give nothing away&quot;? This seems
to be the same  idea (in Kate's mind) as that expressed in the line &quot;They'll
get nothing from me.&quot;  Interestingly, it also seems to imply that the band
of burglars are particularly on  guard about not letting any word of their
activities leak out -- perhaps not even to  others in their circle, rather than
just the police? Remember also that at least in this  (unused) part of the
lyrics the heroine is telling her cohorts what they are going to  do, clearly
before the actual heist has begun. The similarly constructed line from the  song
(&quot;You blow the safe up&quot;) might be the last of these &quot;instructions&quot;,
though I'm  not set on that idea, given the following line (&quot;Then all I
know is I wake up&quot;), which  is obviously a description of the aftermath of
the (imagined?) gelignite explosion  itself. 
</P>
<P>But looking at the verses that Kate printed in her Newsletter description,
it does  seem that the &quot;blow the safe up&quot; line is the same sort of
thing. Could it be that Kate  was trying to create, within the compressed space
of a song's lyrics, the effect of  narrative surprise that is communicated by
the sudden move from the tense list of  &quot;instructions&quot; that the
heroine is giving her gang, to the unexpected result of those  instructions: an
excessively large explosion that stuns the heroine? Still, I think on  balance
that the events beginning either with &quot;You blow the safe up&quot; or with &quot;And
 all I know is I wake up&quot; are probably imagined. The heroine is worried
about what  might happen. This is not to say either that 1) there are not
several time periods in  the song, both real and imaginary (because there
clearly are, as I'll try to show), or  that 2) everything following &quot;Ooh, I
remember&quot; takes place in the same time period,  whether real or imagined. 
</P>
<P>I can only conclude that there are several different time periods in this
song. One  takes place prior to the heist itself, when the band of criminals are
&quot;waiting&quot; around  for the crime to begin (Frank, played by Del in the
video, is actually seen waiting  impatiently in the getaway car). Another
obviously takes place during the crime  itself. A third (and while there is
nothing in the text that requires this scene to be  read as only an anticipation
of the event itself, I do agree that the latter half of the  song is probably
imagined) takes place, as you suggest, in the station-house. 
</P>
<P>Finally, if all these earlier time periods are transpiring in chronological
order (as  they do), at least one and possibly three more time periods --
whether real or  imaginary being quite immaterial -- follow: first, the time
spent by the heroine in  prison; second, her reminiscences, while in prison, of
an apparently once-habitual  activity with her friend(s): being carried (&quot;When
you would carry me&quot;) -- pretty  clearly implying that this is a memory of
childhood, not adulthood, as Doug still  maintains; and third, a point in time
following the heroine's release from prison,  when she is reunited at last with
her friends. 
</P>
<P>If all this is correct, though, I then am faced with the conclusion (which
Doug  reaches and uses, illogically, as a way of ignoring my earlier train of
thought) that  the entire ending of the song is part of that memory. But this
doesn't seem to be  possible (as Doug should be able to see, but doesn't), for
two reasons. First, in the  video the heroine and her accomplices in crime are
obviously racing happily through  the streets with their loot. But we know that
these burglars were not experienced!  Kate herself has said that they'd never
done any serious crimes before, and I quote  from the 1982 Baktabak CD interview
about The Dreaming : 
</P>
<P> &quot;It's about amateur robbers who've only done small things, and this is
now quite  a big robbery that they've been planning for months.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They could hardly, therefore, have had that &quot;rain&quot; of money seen
in the ending of  the video during any period prior to the failed heist. Doug is
therefore definitely  wrong when he insists upon the following: 
</P>
<P>&gt; a reverie of better times, when the burglars lived rich off of their
ill-gotten  gains. Sometime in the past, Kate and her bank-robber lover had
pulled off a  successful heist and they celebrated their success by tossing
their money in the air  and watching it float in the breeze. Kate daydreams
about the way things use to be... 
</P>
<P> Further, the pointed reference to the fact that the currency is obsolete --
not  described as though it were a memory, but rather as though the currency
were  actually being held and appreciated --doesn't synch with the idea that the
entire  ending section of the song's lyrics describes a simple nostalgic &quot;memory&quot;
of an  &quot;earlier successful burglary&quot;, as Doug claims. 
</P>
<P>Now, I don't see how the question of whether this section is imagined or
real in  any way alters the effect of real experience which is produced by the
manner in  which it is told. In other words, whether all that takes place after
the safe-blowing is  real or imagined, that final scene of beholding a rain of
money is still only  explainable when interpreted as a scene (real or imagined)
following the heroine's  release from prison. Doug's idea that all that is a
memory of an earlier heist just  doesn't &quot;sit well&quot; with the few facts
we have. I'd be happy to accept Doug's idea if  it really fit all the facts,
because after all I've never been very comfortable with my  own admittedly
complicated reading of the time-shifts. But the truth is that Doug's  idea that
everything from &quot;Ooh, I remember&quot; on is a recollection of an earlier
bank  heist just doesn't hold water. 
</P>
<P>I'm therefore stuck in a new bind: if the heroine is in prison (or imagines
it)  when she says &quot;Ooh, I remember,&quot; but is no longer remembering
(since there is no  earlier such crime to remember) when she says &quot;Ooh,
there goes a Tenner!&quot; then  the final scene which begins with that line (in
the song) must be describing some  other time period. We know from Kate's own
statement that that other time period  was not from the gang's earlier career,
since these gangsters were essentially  amateurs, not professionals, and since
they had never done any &quot;big jobs&quot; before.  (Doug may attempt to argue
that we don't know whether they might not have had  one success which brought
down a shower of currency, but that was obviously not  what Kate had in mind
when she pointed out that this job is their first &quot;big&quot; one.  There
really can't be any doubt that the rain of money in the end, therefore, comes 
from either an imagined or a real present or future period in the song's story.)

</P>
<P>Furthermore, time in this song has moved -- generally speaking --in a
forward  direction. On the one occasion when it moved backwards instead of
forwards, Kate  indicated that shift explicitly by beginning the section with
the statement &quot;Ooh, I  remember .&quot; But, since the lines from &quot;Ooh,
there goes a Tenner!&quot; on cannot still be  from the character's memories,
the only sensible conclusion to be reached is that  the story has returned to
its original, chronological formula, taking up at the next  and final step in
the story (real or imagined) of these criminals: namely their  reunion following
the heroine's completion of her prison-term. 
</P>
<P>Now I don't like this sudden shift any more than Doug and Ranjit does. But 
Doug's not correct in saying that there's no structural marker in the song
itself to  make clear that such a distinction of time is to be drawn between the
&quot;Ooh, I  remember&quot; section and the &quot;Ooh, there goes a Tenner!&quot;
section. The tense shifts:  from past imperfect to present! If that's not a
structural marker I don't know what  is. 
</P>
<P>Doug does make a good point about the sepia section of the video, which
begins  with the &quot;Ooh, I remember&quot; section, and doesn't switch back to
&quot;present&quot; colour  with the &quot;Ooh, there goes a Tenner!&quot;
section. I certainly don't want to deny this  anomaly. It's there, and I would
love to be able to explain it. That's why I  introduced this topic months back
in Love-Hounds. 
</P>
<P>But think again about those final moments in the song, and remember that you
 just can't ignore the facts that the gang are seen in the video as happy
adults, and  that they could not have made all the money seen floating in the
breeze from an  earlier heist, because Kate has said that they had never had
such a &quot;big&quot; success  prior to the job which went wrong. Therefore,
they must be celebrating their  acquisition of the money from that job. (A third
possibility, that the scene shows the  results of a third, future heist, is
belied by the obsolescence of the currency.) 
</P>
<P>This introduces the last big mystery about the story. If they have got their
hands  on the loot, are we to understand that 1.) they got away after all -- in
which case the  heroine never actually did get caught, but was only imagining
that she might be?  (This is the interpretation that Ranjit has given us.) Or
2.) that all the members who  were caught have served their time, been released,
and come home to meet up with  someone in the gang who had got away with the
money during the confusion and  had kept his partners' shares in safe keeping?
Or 3.) that she is merely imagining  the second development in order to provide
a happy end to her imaginary scenario?  It pretty much has to be one of these
three possibilities, because the idea that all of  the last section is a mere
recollection of an earlier job which went right is just not  correct, as I've
shown. 
</P>
<P>Well, if the first possibility is correct, then the problems I mentioned
earlier,  about how to reconcile the lines about not talking to the police
without a solicitor,  etc., rear their ugly heads once again. Only if all of
those lines about the scene in the  station-house are mere fantasy in the
heroine's eyes, can the theory that they got  away after all hold up. And even
if they got away after all, then why the sepia tinting  in that section? Doug
has said himself that the sepia is an indication of &quot;nostalgia&quot;  and
of sadness at the knowledge of inevitable &quot;karma&quot;, so he cannot accept
the idea  that the criminals have got away with the loot from this big heist
after all. So Doug  must stick with his theory that the final scenes represent a
memory of an earlier  heist which went stunningly, wonderfully right --something
which Kate has said  never happened. 
</P>
<P>Ranjit, however, not having saddled himself with the silly idea that Kate's &quot;belief
 in Karma&quot; must require some kind of retribution for the criminals, may
still ask why  the final scenes cannot represent the present, rather than an
event many years later. 
</P>
<P>Ranjit makes the case (again) for the obvious and most attractive &quot;simple&quot;
reading  of the song's lyrics. I (and virtually all other listeners) had at one
time the same  view of the story that Ranjit described. The problem is that if
all of what follows is  merely imagined, then -- according to what Kate herself
has said -- the huge  gelignite explosion is imagined, as well. Kate has said
(in words that seem to imply  but do not confirm, unfortunately, that the whole
second half is in fact imagined): 
</P>
<P> &quot;And when it &lt;the burglary&gt; actually starts happening they, um,
start freaking  out. They're really scared, so aware of the fact that something
could go wrong, that  they're paranoid ...&quot; &lt;my italics&gt; 
</P>
<P>and again: 
</P>
<P>&quot;...and the second time they're just waiting for the guy to blow the
safe up,  because when he blows it up there's so much that could go wrong.&quot;
&lt;my italics&gt; 
</P>
<P> Now these comments of Kate's don't actually disprove Ranjit's simple
reading,  but they do make it seem unlikely that that's what Kate had in mind. 
</P>
<P>Also remember that in the video, the film slows to slow-mo as Kate mouths
the  words &quot;All my words fade/What am I gonna say?/ Mustn't give the game
away.&quot; If  one makes a case for the latter part being the heroine's
imagination, it's pretty  clear that this is where her imaginings would start,
not after the explosion. This is,  again, no real confirmation that any part of
the story is indeed imagined, but it does  increase the possibility. But it
doesn't help much with a theory about the last scenes  with money floating in
the air being a return to the present, since it indicates that  the huge
explosion didn't take place at all, but was only dreaded by the heroine. 
</P>
<P>As for the &quot;nostalgia&quot; implied by the sepia tinting, I don't want
to deny that. It's  true that the sepia is not fully synchronised with my
theory, as I've already willingly  admitted. But after all, what are these
ex-cons in the final scene doing? They're  celebrating their acquisition of some
very old money. In fact, they are struck by the  obsolescence of the currency
enough to exclaim in nostalgic wonder, &quot;Hey, look!  There's a Fiver!&quot;,
etc. Given this remarkable symbol of the passage of time -- of the  theme of
waiting which is a dominant motif of the song -- is it really so implausible  to
conclude (if only for the time being, and without the benefit of a definitive 
statement from Kate) that the sepia tinting forms an appropriate counterpoint to
the  main thrust of the final section: namely, that years have passed (whether
in fact or  only in her mind seems immaterial, and is not determinable from the
text) and the  heroine is happily, nostalgically enjoying her long-postponed
wealth? I don't see  why such a scene is implausible. 
</P>
<P>I agree with Doug that all this is a house of cards, but facts are facts,
and so far,  my house accounts for a larger number of the details in the song,
video and official  explanations than Doug's does. 
</P>
<P> ----------------------
</P>
<P> Finally, IED will answer as quickly as possible Doug's criticisms of IED's
theory: 
</P>
<P> &gt; (1) There is nothing to indicate the passage of time into the future. 
Furthermore, it seems counterintuitive, considering that it makes perfect sense
that  we are still in the reverie. 
</P>
<P> At this point IED has already made it amply clear that there are
indications that  the final sections of the song reflect a shift in time: first,
the heroine's memory of  habitually having been carried is an image that is very
hard to ascribe to an adult,  but which well describes the play of children; and
second, the video's imagery of  the section immediately succeeding that line
clearly shows the gang as adults,  presenting a dichotomy that can only be
explained by a shift from past to present or  future -- however abrupt. 
</P>
<P>IED might further point out that there is an attendant shift in the tenses
used in  the former as opposed to the latter verse: in the former, which IED
argues is a  recollection of the heroine's childhood, Kate uses the conditional
form of the past  imperfect: &quot;when you would carry me&quot;; whereas in the
next verse, which IED  argues is a series of exclamations made by the heroine in
the company of her fellow  gangmembers in a period some time following her
release from prison, Kate uses  the present tense. If this is not an indication
of a time shift between the two verses,  IED would like to ask what Doug's
requirements for such a shift are. 
</P>
<P>Third, IED doesn't deny the very real possibility that the heroine is &quot;still
in a  reverie&quot; throughout the entire latter half of the song. IED's reading
accomodates  either interpretation in this regard, and can scarcely, therefore,
be called  &quot;counter-intuitive&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Fourth, IED would like to quote Kate once more, again in connection with &quot;There
 Goes a Tenner&quot;, and again from the Baktabak interview. She has just been
talking  about how in the first part of the song the criminals are worried that
something  might go wrong. Kate then says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;It's something that's perhaps not worth the effort because you could
end up in  jail for thirty years.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Now IED doesn't wish to put words into Kate's mouth, so he won't say Kate 
was definitely referring to the events as they occur (or are imagined) in the
song.  But Kate's comment sure makes it a damn sight harder for Doug to argue
that the  heroine of the song didn't have a thirty-year prison term in mind when
she either  lived or imagined the latter half of the song's story. 
</P>
<P> &gt; (2) IED maintains that my theory can't be true because this is Kate's
first  bank robery. However, there is nothing in the song to indicate that this
is Kate's  first bank robbery. 
</P>
<P> First, it's by now clear from IED's re-posting of Kate's own comments about
 this song that the gang in &quot;TGaT&quot; were more or less amateurs who had
not  committed any serious crimes before. The whole point, as Kate clearly sees
the song,  is to show that this crime is the first &quot;big&quot; one the gang
has committed. Beyond that,  however, the gangmembers' silly behaviour in the
early part of the song (acting like  30s gangster-picture actors) had always
seemed to IED to be a way of indicating that  these burglars were inexperienced
and had a romantic, unrealistic view of the crime  of burglary. 
</P>
<P>And in fact, precisely this point is expressed by Kate in the recently
released  Baktabak CD interview. In it she says that she had always been in
disagreement  with the popular notion that committing a crime is romantic and
glamourous, and  that on the contrary, she thought it must be extremely
frightening when one actually  got down to committing it. This, she said, was a
major element in the song &quot;TGaT&quot;. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Furthermore, the line &quot;Pockets floating in the breeze&quot; shows
that Kate has  been witness to money floating in the wind in the past. This is
true in either my or  IED's theory. Now if IED's theory is correct, why is there
money floating in the  wind when Kate was a child? Clearly, Kate has burgled in
the past. 
</P>
<P> Doug makes the obvious error of assuming the validity of his premises
before  they are proved. IED has shown that the description of &quot;pockets
floating in the  breeze&quot; is distinct in time from the image of money
floating in the air (as described  in the stanza immediately following, and as
seen in the video with the adult  gangmembers seeing the currency in the wind).
Furthermore, the image of  &quot;pockets&quot; floating in the breeze makes no
reference to money that IED has ever  been able to see! Rather, it seems much
like the kind of wondering observation that  a child might make as he/she is
being carried around by her friend(s) -- which is  the scene in which the image
of floating pockets appears. The fact that the line is  heard simultaneous with
the scene of the adults running down a street in the video  is perfectly in
keeping with the feeling of &quot;nostalgia&quot; which Doug himself agrees is 
implied by the sepia tinting. There is, therefore, absolutely no contradiction
in IED's  interpretation, but there is a contradiction in Doug's. 
</P>
<P> &gt; (3) IED maintains that the ending is happy. This would be very
uncharacteristic  of Kate. Kate is not one to tell a story where someone does
something bad and ends  up winning because of it. Kate seems to be a definite
believer in the notion of  Karma. Furthermore, the very ending of the song, &quot;Remember
them? That's when  we used to vote for him?&quot;, is nostalgic. Why would Kate
suddenly get nostalgic if at  the moment, everything is better than ever. She
wouldn't get nostalgic. The only  explanation for this is that the ending is not
all that happy. 
</P>
<P> So Kate just doesn't deal with subjects where the fate of a character is
not  somehow part of some great moral, or at least Karmic, plan? Aside from the
fact  that Kate has shown us time and time again that what she has done in the
past is no  indication that she will only do the same thing in the future, it's
possible that Kate  considers that a completed prison term is retribution enough
for the crime, and that  it's not too much to allow her amateur thieves to enjoy
their money after paying  such a high price. Besides, if the scene is imagined,
the point is academic. So this  objection really doesn't have much merit. 
</P>
<P>Doug's assumptions about what &quot;messages&quot; or &quot;morals&quot;
Kate will or will not  allow herself to make in her songs are quite unsuited to
Kate, given the one  consistent characteristic of her art: its essential
unpredictibility. IED has also pointed  out that since (according to IED's
interpretation) the heroine (in fact or in  imagination) has already served her
sentence, it is not unreasonable for her to be  seen in a sympathetic light
enjoying the loot after the fact. That doesn't seem such a  terrible &quot;sin&quot;,
or &quot;breach of Karmic law&quot;, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>Next, IED can see no inconsistency between the remark about &quot;voting for
him&quot;  and the upbeat mood of the conclusion as IED interprets it. The final
remark is an  apparent outgrowth of the heroine's excited observation that the
currency is now  out-of-date. How does this in any way upset IED's
interpretation? It doesn't. 
</P>
<P>Doug's last challenge, that IED explain the sepia in terms of his reading of
the  song, has already been faced. IED admits that the use of sepia for both the
&quot;Ooh, I  remember&quot; section and the &quot;Ooh, there goes a Tenner!&quot;
section is a small (though  not entirely inexplicable) inconsistency. It is the
only one. As for the general  phenomenon of the sepia in the last section, this
fact is perfectly consistent with  IED's reading of the song, as he has already
shown above. 
</P>
<P> &gt; It should be pretty clear by now that IED's theory is untennable. 
</P>
<P> Perhaps it should be, but in fact all that is clear is that IED is even
more fussy  about details than ever, and that it's Doug's fatally &quot;simple&quot;
explanation that needs  some work. IED did appreciate Doug's no doubt
intentionally punny misspelling of  the word &quot;untenable&quot;, though. 
</P>
<P> &gt; Well, I'm sure if you asked Kate about all this symbolism mumbo jumbo,
she'd  say it was all balderdash. I'm sure it's all there, but it may be just
because Kate  tends to use words that are rich with symbolism, or it may be
unconscious, or it may  be as John Carder Bush says, that Kate speaks with the
voice of the Oneness  because she is just a little bit closer to God than the
rest of us, or it may be that Kate  puts all these things into her songs, and
refuses to tell anyone about it, because that  would be giving it away. 
</P>
<P> IED agrees 100% with Doug here -- the symbolism is unquestionably present
in  some songs, and Kate would almost certainly deny it if the interviewer
couldn't  devise some way to present the evidence so cunningly that she couldn't
evade the  subject (an impossible task). IED thinks it must be that she &quot;refuses
to tell anyone  about it, because that would be giving it away.&quot; But one
thing's for certain, and that  is that at least some of her songs have a very
deliberate, very specific symbolic  significance that is so personal that no one
outside the Bush family and immediate  circle of friends could detect its
presence. 
</P>
<P> &gt; I, for example, thought I found all sorts of symbolism in &quot;Under
The Ivy&quot;.  There's ivy. There's a garden. There's a white rose. I ask Kate
about all this  wonderful, deep, rich, lush, layered symbolism, and what does
Kate say? She says  basically, &quot;No, it's just a song about two people
sneaking into the back yard to fuck&quot;.  Well, IED, I think that you have to
face the fact that if you asked her any questions  about your notions of
symbolism, she'd probably say the same thing. 
</P>
<P> Oh, IED thinks you're probably right. He'd never get the truth out of her.
As a  matter of fact, it's this very song that IED knows contains at least one
tiny bit of  confirmed secret symbolism, so Doug is without a doubt on the money
here. The  only thing that isn't certain is whether the manner in which such
questions are  asked, and the atmosphere in which they are asked, might not
affect the frankness  and seriousness of her replies, at least in some degree.
