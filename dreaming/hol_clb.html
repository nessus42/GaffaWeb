Subject: Orgone 
</P>
<P>Well, since it's been a couple of weeks and no one got the 100 point bonus 
question, I'll give it all away. (Henry Chai got the 10 point bonus question!) 
</P>
<P>There's this guy named Peter Reich who wrote a book called &quot;A Book of 
Dreams&quot;. It's about him and his father Wilhelm Reich, who was a famous 
psychiatrist. Wilhelm Reich invented this thing called the Orgone accumulator
which  would accumulate Orgone Energy, which is life energy. If you got into one
of these  Orgone accumulators, it would build up your life energy. Deserts are
caused by  UFOs that come and suck up Orgone Energy from the atmosphere. Wilhelm
Reich  also invented an alternate from of the Orgone accumulator called the
cloudbuster. It  would sap Orgone energy from UFOs and put it back in the
atmosphere. This would  cause it to rain. 
</P>
<P>Now fluorescent lights and glow-in-the-dark yoyos are very very bad for
one's  Orgone Energy, so Wilhelm made Peter bury his yoyo. But every now and
then  Peter would want to play with it anyway, even though he knew it was bad
for him.  So he would dig it up, play with it for a while, and then bury it
again. One day while  Peter was still a little kid, the FDA came along and threw
Wilhelm in jail where he  died a few years later.

<BR> Subject: Orgone &amp; Orgonomy 
</P>
<P>Well, I finally got around to look more closely at &quot;Orgone&quot; and
related stuff. I  started first by locating &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot; by
Peter Reich. When I went to get the  book from one of the campus libraries, (the
Science &amp; Medicine library) I noticed  that there are several other books on
or by Wilheim Reich. Then I looked at the call  number of &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot;,
which was RZ 460.R43, and saw that all the other  books have RZ 460 as the first
part of the call number. According to the Library of  Congress' (LC) book
classification scheme, RZ 460 is used for books on  &quot;Orgonomy&quot;, which
is classified under the heading &quot;Miscellaneous Systems of  Medicine&quot;.
Next I turned to the Dewey Classification System of books. The call  number for
books on Orgonomy is 615.856, and its heading is &quot;Miscellaneous  Therapies:
Controversial and Spurious Therapies -- including Orgonomy; quackery  e,g,
Perkinism&quot;. So now we know where it fits! I have looked into Encylopaedia 
Brittanica but there is no reference to Orgonomy. The Random House Dictionary, 
however, defines orgonomic energy. 
</P>
<P>As I started to go thru &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Wilheim Reich
and Orgonomy&quot;  by an Ola Raknes, the first thing I noticed was that Reich's
home was called  &quot;Orgonon&quot; and not &quot;Organon&quot;. So why did KB
use &quot;Organon&quot;? It seems unlikely that it's a mistake. Also &quot;Organon&quot;
refers to a work by (I think) Aristotle; could there be  a connection somehow? 
</P>
<P>Next thing I found was the amazingly simple principles employed for the 
Cloudbuster and the Orgone Accumulator. The former is nothing but an 
arrangement of telescopic metal tubes. Here I must quote two properties of
orgone,  the &quot;life energry&quot;: 
</P>
<P>1. Organic substances attract and absorb orgone energy 
</P>
<P>2. Metallic substances attract and repel or reflect orgone energy 
</P>
<P>(&quot;attract and repel&quot;? this is the type of stuff you expect from an
&quot;Orgonomist&quot;, of  which said author of the book, Dr. Raknes, is one) 
</P>
<P>So the metal tubes will absorb orgone energy and will send this energy into
the  insides of the tube, which lead to water (for some reason water is a good
absorber of  orgone). When a tube is aimed at a cloud, the orgone energy will be
absorbed and  the cloud will be dissipated (busted). But if the cloudbuster is
pointed at regions  where there is no cloud, clouds nearby would be charged with
orgone and/or  moisture, so when the clouds are overcharged it would rain! 
</P>
<P>As for the orgone acculmulator, it is just a box with an outer layer of
organic  substance, e.g. wood, and a metallic inner layer. The wood will absorb
orgone from  the air, and the metal will in turn abosrb orgone from the wood,
then send it into  the inside of the box. So if you sit inside the box, you'll
be charged with orgone. If  there is another person inside the box with you,
after a while you'll see each other  glow with a bluish shimmer -- sky-blue is
the characteristic color of orgone. (and  that is the very reason that the sky
is blue!) 
</P>
<P>And to correct Doug, radium is NOT a CATALYST of orgone. If orgone is 
irradiated, it will trun into DOR -- 'deadly orgone', which is brownish black in
 color, and needless to say it's bad for you. 
</P>
<P>All of this sounds out of this world, doesn't it? I have some trouble
reading  &quot;Wilheim Reich and Orgonomy&quot; because the author's tone is so
serious, he seems to  be saying &quot;Hey! this is all true! I've seen it
happen. I can't understand why some  people refuse to believe it when it's so
obvious! And the FDA, they said they used  scientific equipment to prove the
non-existence of orgone, yet they refuse to give the  details of the
experiments. They must be making it up!&quot; I found many of the  &quot;experiments&quot;
or &quot;observations&quot; described in the book to be totally unscientific. 
However, I'll try to finish it and I'll keep everyone posted if anything else 
interesting comes up. (that is, everyone who has stayed with me so far :-)

<BR> Subject: More on Peter Reich (LONG) 
</P>
<P>I have sorta finished &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot; by Peter Reich (I rushed
thru it).  Here's what I think is relevant to &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Peter Reich (known as Peeps to his Dad) was close to his parents. When he
was  10, his mother left them because she was a rather independent person and
also  because she got fed up with Wilhem's work. Thus Peter was very close to
his dad  after that. The government people came and took Wilhem away when Peter
was 13  (Wilhem also died in the same year). With regrads to the line &quot;I
can't hide you  from the government&quot;, I quote a passage that describe what
happened when the  government people FDA agents and a US marshal came in &quot;a
shiny black car&quot;. To get  to the Reichs' estate, Orgonon, visitors have to
pass the abandoned laboratory at the  foot of the hill. 
</P>
<P>Wilhem instructed Peter to keep the government people at the lab by asking 
them to wait, and then to call him on the phone, so that Wilhem can be prepared.
 Peter did as he was told, and as he called Wilhem, who was in his study, the 
government people sneaked up the hill: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Daddy! They didn't wait&quot; 
</P>
<P>Tears tangled my words making the reciever wet and shiny. The car disappered
 around around the lab up the hill. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Daddy! They're coming up! OH DADDY OH GOD THEY DIDN'T WAIT. 
</P>
<P>THEY'RE COMING UP DADDY THEY'RE COMING UP!&quot; 
</P>
<P>The screen door slammed before the receiver hit the floor. Grass was already
 whipping my legs as I ran up the hill. [...] 
</P>
<P>Everett Quimbly said if you run with your hands open you could go faster so
my  hands were wide open going back and forth like a train all the way up to the
hill  like a train running. Because if I run fast enough maybe I could beat them
to he top  of the hill and warn Daddy. What did they want? What did they want?
Why did  they always make us unhappy? 
</P>
<P>Actually that time the FDA people just wanted the orgone accumulators 
destroyed. The actual &quot;capturing&quot; of Wilhem was not described. 
</P>
<P>This passage probably gave KB the line &quot;On top of the world / looking
over the  edge&quot;: 
</P>
<P>He was like a man who was standing on top of the world looking over into a
new  world. That is what Daddy was like. He had lifted himself so he was looking
the  horizon to a new world, a free and happy world. He stood there on the edge
of the  universe looking into the future. [...] They pulled the ladder out from
under him  and killed him. 
</P>
<P>The &quot;march&quot; music of the song could have been inspired by the &quot;Corps
of the  Comsic Engineers&quot;, in which Wilheim was the general, Peter was both
lieutenant  and sergeant, and their followers were soldiers and scouts. They
believed they were  soldiers fighting against UFO's. 
</P>
<P>The line &quot;Your son's coming out&quot; does not refer to Peter admitting
his  homosexuality :-). When he was about 26, Peter saw the movie &quot;The Fly&quot;
(you  know, the one about the scientist who did an experiment which caused his
own body  to be mixed up with a fly's so that he has the head and an arm of the
fly's). It had  a most profound effect on him: 
</P>
<P>In the last scene, a benevolent uncle comforts the scientist's widow and
son. He  tells the son that his father had &quot;touched on knowledge of the
future,&quot; and, &quot;Maybe  someday, in many years, the world willl
understand his contribution,&quot; and, &quot;he was  ahead of his time&quot;.
[..] Right there in the movie, people were laughing at how  incredible The Fly
was when sitting right there in the middle of the crowd was  someone who had
been through something like that and it was real. It was just more  believable
in a movie. 
</P>
<P>and: 
</P>
<P>The first thirteen years of my life always seemed most real to me, more real
than  anything that happened afterwards. And now, suddenly, with the infant
soldier  fading away in the bright lights after the movie, I felt afraid that my
life would be  empty and lost. 
</P>
<P>The last thirteen years were lost and unhappy. The infant was frozen inside
me,  unable to live. [..] It took a movie to break my shell, maybe because
movies are so  close to dreams and I love my dreams more than reality. There had
been too much  sadness; not enough laughter. 
</P>
<P>That's all, can't find anything related to trains though. In another book &quot;The
 Man Who Dreamed of Tomorrow&quot; by Mann and Hoffman (with foreword by 
Wilhem's wife), it was mentioned that during his few months in prison Wilhem put
 together a book called &quot;prayers and Poems&quot; for Peter. Haven't found
it in the  library yet; maybe it would contain some more helpful stuff? 
</P>
<P>Sorry for the length (it's almost as long as some of the postings by Doug on
 net.music ;-), but I felt these are relevant to deeper understanding of the
song.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: spelling of Organon 
</P>
<P>Henry Chai preceded me, I note, in deciding that it was &quot;unlikely&quot;
that the  spelling of Organon was unintentional; but at this point I am willing
to admit that  even KT is able to commit errors, albeit of the most trivial
kind. Knowing, however,  of Kate's continued predilection for cigarettes, it is
equally possible that the spelling  is a veiled reference to an obscure document
of 1659, written by the physician Walter  Rumsey, entitled &quot;Organon
salutis: including divers new experiments of tobacco and  coffee: how much they
conduce to preserve humane health&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Chai also noted that he had a hard time reading from the original works
of  Wilhelm Reich, because of the seriousness of his tone. This tone is
precisely what  makes Reich's pathology so fascinating (for as much as we may
admire the beauty of  his ideas and sympathize with the persecution he suffered
at the hands of the U.S.  government, it must be admitted that Reich was, at
least by the late 1940s, quite mad).  If Reich had simply taken to stumbling
through the streets of Manhattan, spouting  harangues to the effect that alien
DOR forces were attacking the Earth in UFOs,  and that the only way to stop them
was to open fire by shooting blue Orgonotic  energy rays into the sky through
the agency of big metal pipes, he would not be  remembered today, except,
perhaps, for his early work in the field of Freudian  psycho-analytic
scholarship. But because he channeled his dementia into the narrow  and highly
disciplined forms of scholarly writing, developing a large body of  Orgonotical
literature and publishing heavily footnoted papers regularly in the  Orgonon
Press, his name lives on, and his work is still sporadically referred to by 
some of the flakier psychologists in business today. 
</P>
<P>Partly out of a feeling of empathy for such a means of justifying one's
obsessions,  I have chosen to adopt Reich's pedantic forms and ponderous style
in dealing with  the work of Kate Bush, since this kind of obsessive interest in
another person's life  and work is better disguised, I think, when couched in
the dry-as-dust language of  the Orgonotic scholar.

<BR> Subject: Orgonon trip 
</P>
<P>Well, I did it. I finally made it up to Orgonon. I took pictures of
cloudbusters and  Wilhelm Reichs big fieldstone home/laboratory. I even sat in
an Orgonon  accumulator. I showed the Cloudbusting video to my tour guide on the
museums  video system. He wants a copy. Said he'd like to try and work it into
the tour  somehow. He also said that Kate had been there to visit, or so he'd
been told. This is  his first summer working there as a tour guide. 
</P>
<P>I sent pictures to IED for inclusion on in Kates birthday card. I wrote a
nice note  on the back of what I felt was the nicest one: a picture of Reichs
tomb, complete  with bust, with a cloudbuster behind it. If I make it down to
the Katemas party at  Joe Turners I'll bring copies so everyone else can see.
IED tells me he will be  sending most of them along to Kate, which doesn't
bother me. I told him he could  keep all of them except for the special one to
Kate.

<BR> Subject: Wilhelm Reich 
</P>
<P>Much of this has been covered already, but I feel this cannot be underscored
too  strongly. 
</P>
<P>Wilhelm Reich was one of the three main post-Freudian psychoanalytic
theorists,  the other two being Adler and Jung. As a result of his pro-sexual
and anti- fascist  theories, Reich was constantly getting expelled from various
countries, which wound  up giving him a predictable messiah complex. This
complex led to his later crackpot  phase of orgonomy. However, to dismiss his
entire corpus as crackpottery is merely  to betray one's ignorance of the
history of psychology. His works on character  armor and the mass psychology of
fascism still deserve as serious scrutiny as the  works of other psychoanalytic
theorists. 
</P>
<P>Wilhelm Reich was killed for scientific heresy, and that is the part of his
story  that Kate Bush deals with in her excellent song &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;.
&quot;You looked too  small in their big black car to be a threat to the men in
power...&quot; In the late 1950's,  Reich was arrested by US government agents
for publishing unauthorized medical  books based on his research into orgonomy.
All his books, including his  psychoanalytic books from earlier in the century
which contained no orgonomic  references, were burned. Reich never left prison;
he died of prison sickness less  than a year later. The episode is a shocking
and disgusting one in the history of the  country, and that the scientific
community did not object to Reich's execution for  heresy is a powerful
discredit to that community. To dismiss or trivialize it on the  grounds that
Reich had become a crank is to endorse the execution of heretics. 
</P>
<P>An excellent and skeptical biography of Reich can be found in the Readers
and  Writers series of &quot;Beginners' Books&quot;, entitled &quot;Reich for
Beginners&quot;. Serious  students should also examine his &quot;Mass Psychology
of Fascism&quot; and &quot;The Function of  the Orgasm&quot;.

<P>Date: Fri, 6 Jan 89 22:17:17 CST <BR> From:
bradley!bucc2!pwh@uiucdcs.cs.uiuc.edu (Pete Hartman) <BR> Subject: W. Reich
</P>
<P>For a while now I've been planning on finding some books about or by Wilhelm
 Reich, out of curiousity about this &quot;orgone energy&quot; stuff mentioned
in this group.  The recent argument pushed me into action, and I thought that
some relevant things  could be made general knowledge....My source is a book
called &quot;Wilhelm Reich&quot;  (simple enough...) by Charles Rycroft. I
originally thought it to be a biography, but it  it more an assessment of
Reich's work. 
</P>
<P>To make a long analysis short, the point of the book is that Reich was
generally a  brilliant man who came to many valid (or nearly valid) insights
about personality and  relationships, and felt it necessary to give these
insights the stamp of a natural  science. His understanding of the scientific
method, however, seems to have been  poor--he did experiments without control
groups etc., and was in the habit of  finding facts to support his theories
rather than finding theories that fit the facts.  Unfortunately, in the latter
instance, he tended to interpret others' work in ways  that helped his theories,
but weren't necessarily valid. 
</P>
<P>The other point the author makes is that many of Reich's theories were
similar  to what artists and poets have been saying for some time about the
nature of life, and  taken in such a way have a definite validity. Had he not
felt it necessary to explain  these thoughts in a &quot;scientific&quot; way, he
wouldn't have been so isolated (although in  such a light such insights were
hardly ground-breaking). 
</P>
<P>As far as his work being &quot;dangerous&quot;, as XYZ/dana seems to insist,
it seems  unlikely to me. That's not even cited as a reason for his arrest: 
</P>
<P>&quot;By the 1950's Reich had persuaded himself that it was possible to
isolate life  energy in the form of vesicles, which he called bions, and to
store it in accumulators  known as orgone boxes. He also believed that it was
possible to cure patients with  cancer and other diseases by placing them inside
these boxes. In 1954 the United  States Food and Drug Administration placed an
injunction against the distribution of  orgone boxes on the ground that the
claims made on their behalf were fraudulent.  Reich refused either to obey the
injunction of to recognize the competence of the  courts to adjudicate on
matters of scientific fact. He was eventually charged with  contempt of court
and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. After imprisonment  he was diagnosed
paranoid and transferred to 'the only penitentiary with  psychiatric treatment
facilities,' where he was, however, declared 'legally sane and  competent.' On
November 3, 1957, he died of heart disease.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On the subject of the orgone boxes (the only part of treatment that could 
potentially be considered dangerous): &quot;Incidentally, orgone boxes--or to
give them  their official name 'orgone-energy accumulators'--were constructed of
alternating  layers of steel wool and rock or glass wool, with celotex
soft-board on the outside.  Apparently they were the shape of a telephone box of
coffin, and I am told that one  did indeed feel a bit strange after being
encased in one, probably on account of their  poor ventilation.&quot; However it
is worth noting that nowhere does it indicate that  Reich's treatment allowed
someone to stay in a poorly ventilated box to the point of  physical or
psychological harm. 
</P>
<P>It is also indicated that quite a bit of his practice was successful in
treating  psychological problems, but this success was probably more due to
Reich's  personality and approach than to his theories. 
</P>
<P>I think that my major outrage in the matter of his arrest is not that a
brilliant  man was trampled by an unfeeling government, although that has some
truth to it,  but that his books were burned. There was no need or excuse for
such an action,  and it just adds to my realization of how little the government
really cares about its  citizens rights. 
</P>
<P>If you want a fairly quick and seemingly fair and realistic analysis of
Reich's  theories, I'd recommend going to your local library and finding this
book. It's only  just over 100 pages, and seemed to me to be balanced between
finding Reich's valid  points and pointing out his obviously off-the-wall
attempt to find physical  explanations for why these points worked in therapy.

This same  lawyer went on to be prosecuting attorney in Reich's later criminal
indictment. If  Reich had had a GOOD lawyer, he could have gotten the whole
original case thrown  out of court as being unconstitutional. (&quot;The
government can't regulate scientific  discoveries, et cetera et cetera&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, this whole topic has gotten so far away from the original posting
about  a song with &quot;Cloudbuster&quot; lyrics that it no longer belongs in
this newsgroup. 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Thank goodness most people think of the cloudbuster as a bunch of
hoo-ha.  Otherwise some real harm could be done to global weather.

</P>
<P>I found a biography of Wilhelm Riech at the library (which I've yet to
read). I  was interested to find pictures of Riech's actual &quot;Cloudbuster&quot;.
The actual device  was much more simple in appearance than the one in the
Cloudbusting video, just a  bunch of rods mounted on a pivoting platform. I
don't think the actual device was  mobile like the one in the video. The &quot;principle&quot;
on which it was based required that  it be &quot;grounded&quot; to a deep well
of some sort. 
</P>
<P>Please note that I'm not faulting the video in any way. I think that
Cloudbusting  is my favorite video of all time. In fact the more fanciful
version of the  &quot;Cloudbuster&quot; might be consider to be how the device
would be perceived through  the eyes of a child.

<P> Peter Reich's book A Book of Dreams has been re-issued in paperback in the 
United States! 
</P>
<P>It's now out in a new edition as an E. P. Dutton-Bellisk oversize paperback
book.  The domestic retail price is $7.95. 
</P>
<P>And get this: Kate is on the cover! 
</P>
<P>It's highly cool! The cover design features a photo by John Carder Bush (one
of  the shots he took at the end of one of the shooting-days, with Kate's figure
at the  cloudbuster, in silhouette against an orange sky). 
</P>
<P>The mystery is that neither Kate nor John Carder Bush is credited in the
book.  The design is credited to some other woman, and there is no I.D. of the
photo itself,  nor of its photographer. Pretty odd. Either Dutton is breaking
copyright laws, or  Kate and John requested anonymity. IED doesn't know which.
Also, there is a new  introduction by Peter Reich, but he too makes no mention
of Kate. 
</P>
<P>But isn't this neat anyway?

<P> The new edition of Peter Reich's A Book of Dreams is published by 
Dutton-Obelisk, not &quot;Bellisk&quot;. (Third-hand info is nearly always
wrong.) Also, there  is a mention of Kate on the back-cover blurb: she is listed
among several pop-culture  figures who have acknowledged the book's inspiring
influence upon them. She is  not identified in the photo, nor is John Carder
Bush credited for his photograph.  The brief new preface by Peter Reich is a
wonderfully concise explanation of his  reasons for remaining vague about his &quot;stand&quot;

<P>Date: Mon, 7 Aug 89 14:31:31 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Wilhelm Reich (long) 
</P>
<P> With all the talk lately about &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and Wilhelm and
Peter Reich, I  thought it would be instructive to see how someone with a
completely different  perspective looks at his work. The following piece is by
Martin Gardner, a well  known mathematician and critic of the paranormal. 
</P>
<P>From &quot;Hermit Scientists&quot; by Martin Gardner (1951) 
</P>
<P>Reprinted in Gardner's Science: Good, Bad and Bogus (1981) 
</P>
<P> Reprinted here without permission 
</P>
<P> Let us turn to a more colorful scientist whose work has recently become a
lively  cult among the more Bohemian intellectuals of New York and elsewhere --
the  psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich. Like Hubbard's dianetics, Reich's &quot;orgone
therapy&quot; has  no connection with religious dogma but is presented simply as
a revolutionary  discovery in biology and psychology. 
</P>
<P>Reich began his curious career in Austria as an orthodox Freudian but later
broke  with the psychoanalysts, founding his own publishing house in Germany in
1931. He  also severed his ties with the Austrian Communist Party, having served
in the same  cell with the writer Arthur Koestler. Five years later, Reich
opened an institute at  Oslo, where he met with furious attack by Scandinavian
biologists who insisted his  knowledge was less than that of an undergraduate.
Expelled from Norway, he came  to New York in 1939 at the invitation of Dr.
Theodore P. Wolfe, an associate professor  of psychiatry at Columbia University,
and lectured for a brief term at New York's  New School for Social Research.
[Later, he maintained] a press in Greenwich  Village, and research laboratories
in Forest Hills, New York, and Organon, Maine. 
</P>
<P>In Reich's best-known work, The Function of the Orgasm, he compares himself 
to Peer Gynt, i.e., the unconventional genius, out of step with society,
misunderstood,  ridiculed. Society has the last laugh, he writes, until the Peer
Gynts are proved right.  In [another] publication, Listen, Little Man, 1949,
Reich likens himself to such  persecuted figures as Jesus and Karl Marx. &quot;Whatever
you have done to me or will  do to me in the future,&quot; he declares, &quot;whether
you glorify me as a genius or put me  in a mental institution, whether you adore
me as your savior or hang me as a spy,  sooner or later necessity will force you
to comprehend that *I have discovered the  laws of the living*.. .&quot; 
</P>
<P>A pamphlet by Dr. Wolfe, published by Reich's Orgone Institute in 1948, is
called  Emotional Plague Versus Orgone Biophysics. The purpose of the booklet is
stated on  the cover: 
</P>
<P>&quot;A vicious campaign of slander and distortion against Wilhelm Reich and
his  work was begun early in 1947. There is no telling where it will lead. This
campaign  has not been confined to magazine and newspaper articles, but an
agency of the  United States Government has been dragged into it.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Chief signs of this &quot;emotional plague&quot; (Reich's term for the
slander campaign)  are two articles by Mildred Brady, one in Harper's (April,
1947), the other in The  New Republic (May 26, 1947). The government agency is
the Food and Drug  Administration, at that time investigating Reich's &quot;orgone
accumulators.&quot; These are  large boxes of wood on the outside and metal
inside. Patients rent them from the  Institute, then sit inside them to build up
their orgone potential by absorbing the  box's abnormally high concentration of
orgone energy (a nonelectromagnetic radiant  energy coming from outer space
which Reich discovered in Norway in 1939). &quot;The  Orgone Accumulator is the
most important single discovery in the history of  medicine, bar none,&quot;
Wolfe writes. 
</P>
<P>The following paragraph from a letter of Reich's published in the pamphlet,
is  revealing: 
</P>
<P>&quot;It is an old story. It is older than the ancient Greeks whom we
consider the  bearers of a flourishing culture.. .. It was no different two
thousand years later.  Giordano Bruno, who fought for scientific knowledge and
against astrological  superstition, was condemned to death by the Inquisition.
It is the same psychic  pestilence which delivered Galileo to the Inquisition,
let Copernicus die in misery,  made Leeuwenhoek a recluse, drove Nietzsche into
insanity, Pasteur and Freud into  exile. It is the indecent, vile attitude of
contemporaries of all times. This has to be  said clearly once and for all. One
cannot give in to such manifestations of the  pestilence.&quot; 
</P>
<P> A word about orgone energy. Reich regards his discovery of it as comparable
to  the Copernican Revolution. A failure to accept it on the part of other
psychiatrists is,  of course, &quot;resistance to a new concept.&quot; In
Character Analysis he interprets Freud's  &quot;Id&quot; as the action of orgone
energy in the body. The energy provides a biological and  physical base for
psychiatry, and to operate with the old Freudian drives is, Reich  asserts, like
trying to drink from a mirror image of a glass of water. In The Function  of the
Orgasm he describes orgone energy as blue in color (it has been  photographed on
Kodachrome film, Wolfe tells us), and adds that it is responsible for  the
Northern Lights, St. Elmo's Fire, lightning, the blue of the sky, electric 
disturbances during sunspot activity, and the blue coloration of sexually
excited frogs.  &quot;Cloud formations and thunder storms,&quot; he writes -- &quot;phenemena
which to date  have remained unexplained -- depend on changes in the
concentration of  atmospheric orgone.&quot; In 1947 Reich measured the energy
with a Geiger counter. 
</P>
<P>It is interesting to note in passing that Reich also attributes the
flickering of stars  to orgone energy. 
</P>
<P>Reich's most astounding discovery is reported in the article &quot;The
Natural  Organization of Protozoa from Orgone Energy Vesicles,&quot; in the
November, 1942, issue  of his International Journal of Sex Economy and Orgone
Research. In this paper,  accompanied by microphotographs, Reich describes his
observations of protozoa  being formed spontaneously from aggregates of bions.
The bion is another Reich  discovery. It is the unit of living matter,
consisting of a membrane surrounding a  liquid and pulsating with orgone energy.
Bions are constantly being formed in nature  by the disintegration of both
organic and inorganic matter. Under his microscope  Reich observed bions
grouping together to form various types of protozoa, and he  has the photographs
to prove it. Cancer cells, incidentally, are protozoa which  develop from tissue
bions. To charges of critics that protozoa get into his cultures  from the air,
or were already on the disintegrating material in the form of dormant  cysts,
Reich simply answers that it isn't so, though he gives no evidence of taking 
adequate precautions against either possibility. 
</P>
<P>Disciples of Reich frequently defend him by saying, &quot;Granted that his
biological  work is highly suspect, you'll have to admit he's made great
contributions to the  field of mental therapy.&quot; This may be true. But it
has somewhat the same plausibility  as a statement like the following: &quot;Granted
that Professor Ludwig von  Hoofenmeister errs in his theory that stars are holes
in an opaque sphere  surrounding the earth, you'll have to admit has has made
magnificent discoveries in  his study of cosmic rays.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The reader may wonder why a competent scientist does not publish a detailed 
refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The answer is that the
informed  scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation by
taking the time  to undertake such a thankless task. For the same reasons,
scarcely a single classic in  the field of modern scientific curiosa has
prompted an adequate reply. 
</P>
<P>[In the book Gardner adds a postscript, written in 1981:] 
</P>
<P>Reich's orgonomy cult *seems* to be waning (I could be wrong!), though most
of  his books are back in print, and his followers are still to be found among
writers,  artists, and show people like Orson Bean. Numerous books about him,
favorable and  otherwise, have been written in recent years. His daughter Eva
Reich, a pediatrician  in Hancock, Maine, is active as a lecturer in orgonomy.
Her father's rain-making  device -- huge tubes that squirt orgone energy into
the clouds -- is in her front  yard. [Any Love-Hounds want to make a
pilgrimmage?] For a while she was using  orgone energy accumulators to treat
infants at a hospital for premature babies in  Harlem; but, after the director
asked her to cease or resign, she chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>Eva is firmly persuaded that human auras are orgone energy. See Lynn 
Franklin's long, sad interview, &quot;Like Father, Like Daughter,&quot; in the
Maine Sunday  Telegram, June 22, 1980. According to Newsweek (December 13,
1976): &quot;For twenty  years, Eva Reich has been hiding microfilms of portions
of Reich's papers in a  mushroom cave in the Catskill Mountains. Unless the
courts intervene, she says, she  may make these secrets available to the world.&quot;

</P>
<P>A silly book has just crossed my desk: The Quest for Wilhelm Reich, by Colin
 Wilson (Doubleday, 1981). Poor Colin. He had great promise as a young writer in
 Britain before he went crackers over the paranormal. Wilson sees Reich as
crazy,  but nevertheless a genius whose discovery of orgone energy puts him in
the  company of Semmelweis, Mendel, and all those other great scientists who
were  unappreciated in their day. No book on Reich is less worth reading. 
</P>
<P>Note from Ed: 
</P>
<P>This in *no way* takes anything away from the greatness of &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
which  is one of my favorites even among Kate's songs. It's just that I always
have to laugh  whenever Kate mentions in an interview that Reich was &quot;very
respected.&quot;  Sometimes her philosophical ideas have to be taken with a
grain of salt, I think.

<P>Date: Fri, 18 Aug 89 02:21 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: M. Gardner on Reich
</P>
<P> First, Martin Gardner's remarks about Reich, while accurate enough,
overlook  the most salient aspect of Reich's work in the context of Kate
Bushology: namely, its  artistic qualities. 
</P>
<P>All readers of this group will know already that Kate Bush looks at the
creativity  of man as functions of man's artistic impulses--she sees art as &quot;pure
emotion&quot;. Yet,  amazingly, the emotional--the poetic --character of Wilhelm
Reich's work is  practically never considered in discussions of Reichian theory!
As a result, the  discussions which ebb and flow in Love-Hounds miss the true
point. So do the  supercilious views of such debunkers of pseudo-science as
Gardner--a man who, for  all his intelligence, scarcely ever manages to maintain
a truly scientific dispassion for  the objects of his criticism. Witness his
quite unnecessarily patronizing and insulting  likeness of Wilhelm Reich's name
with a stereotypically Germanic &quot;quack&quot;  character he calls &quot;Professor
Ludwig van Hoofenmeister&quot;, or his equally  condescending and uncalled for
remarks about Colin Wilson, a writer of  tremendous and unique artistic power. 
</P>
<P>The arguments against Reich which focus on an attack of his &quot;scientific&quot;
theories  are all too easy to make--Reich's &quot;science&quot; is a cheap
target of ridicule. Yet such  ridicule fails to address the fact that Reich's
works continue to draw a substantial  readership throughout the world. And the
ridicule fails in this regard because the  attraction--the beauty--of Reich's
fantastic world of pseudo-science cannot be  understood, nor even recognized,
through an analysis of its feasibility (or lack of  same) as science. It's
beyond dispute that Reich's later work has no truly scientific  validity, and
virtually no-one--Kate Bush included--would try to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>That said, what draws someone like Kate Bush to the subject of Reich? In
Kate's  case the question of Reich's work has never become relevant to her
particular  interests. Since she was initially drawn only to the memoir of
Reich's son Peter, and  not to Wilhelm's theoretical writings, whatever
knowledge of Reichian theory  which she may have taken the trouble to gather is,
de facto, incidental at best to her  true subject of interest. 
</P>
<P>Second, contrary to Ed Suranyi's implication, Kate Bush has never said that
she  believes in a single one of Reich's theories. On the contrary, whenever she
has been  asked about the story of Cloudbusting, her replies have been
conspicuously  noncommittal in their wording. It's important to remember that
Kate almost never  rejects anyone's ideas. (Btw, some of Doug Alan's notions
enjoy the rare distinction  of being counted among that elite group of ideas,
and are--if only for that  reason--worthy of all serious Kate Bushologists'
continued study. See below.) Add to  this fact our knowledge that even before
Hounds of Love came out Kate had become  a personal friend of Peter Reich's, and
it will be easy to understand why she has not  come out and said &quot;Wilhelm
Reich was a nut&quot;--even if she thinks in those terms,  which she probably
does not. 
</P>
<P>IED's theory, based on years of consideration of Kate's opinions and
attitudes, is  that Kate is pre-disposed to retain an open mind about Reich's
work; not only  because it would be disrespectful and unfriendly to criticize or
reject it, but also  because she is always trying to see strange human behaviour
from the perpetrator's  point of view. She does this often very deliberately and
consciously. Also, she has  several times made it clear that she sees no benefit
in cynicism. 
</P>
<P>Ed correctly (and with evident regret) reports that Kate has called Reich a 
&quot;highly respected psycho-analyst&quot;. But in describing Reich that way
Kate is  absolutely correct ! The fact is that until the very end of the 1930s
Wilhelm Reich  was a quite important figure within the legitimate European
psycho-analytic  community. His early training was under Freud himself, and he
even drew  commendation from Freud for his brilliance. His first publications
presented and  explored a series of challenging theories about the effect of
psycho-sexual complexes  on large groups. These papers pointed to a theory about
Marxist communism and  the value of psycho-analysis in socialist societies. Such
loaded issues naturally drew  enemies, and it is these political conflicts which
resulted in Reich's ostracization  from the psycho-analytic mainstream, not his
crackpottery, which only emerged  later. 
</P>
<P>By 1939, however, Reich's psychosis had begun to appear in his work. There 
should never have been any difficulty in recognizing it as psychotic--discussion
of  blue orgone rays, UFOs, rainmakers and emotional plague are not subtle hints
of  mental instability! IED therefore finds it extraordinary that all the fuss
over Reich in  recent Love-Hounds discussions focuses on the non-argument over
the &quot;scientific  validity&quot; (or lack of same) of Reich's ideas. In all
these discussions, it is equally  extraordinary--and very revealing--that no-one
has taken the time to read Reich's  books! Surely with all the insistence on the
importance of the scientific method, the  readers of Love-Hounds can see that no
accurate assessment of the value of Reich's  work can be made merely by reading
the glib and facile reviews of people like  Martin Gardner. 
</P>
<P>Well, IED has read some of Reich's work--two of the last collections of 
papers--and he would like to say that it is amazing stuff. Yes, it's kookoo.
Kate  would surely call it &quot;weird&quot;. Reich's writings constitute some
of the most unsettling,  and at the same time the most hauntingly poetic,
fantastic literature that anyone  could hope to find. The distinction of his
work lies mainly in the scholarly form in  which it is couched: the sheer lunacy
of his notions about orgone and its various  miraculous properties and functions
takes on a kind of bizarre elegance and power  when it is exposed via his
flawless academic language. And although IED has no  direct data to support
this, he cannot but assume that whatever attraction to Reich's  own work Kate
Bush might have (if indeed she has any at all) must stem from the  surreality of
this collision of psychotic delusion with academic form. 
</P>
<P>Kate has also, as Ed mentioned, described the cloudbuster as a machine &quot;that
 could make it rain&quot;. This statement, which she has made three times that
IED knows  (all within a four-day period in November 1985, never before or
since), is however  quite clearly intended to describe the point of view of the
character in the song--i.e.,  Peter Reich, aged 9 or so. It would be completely
inconsistent with every  story-synopsis Kate has ever given--of any of her
songs--for her to explain Cloud-  busting from a point of view which was
detached from that of the songs'  protagonists. Her explanation of Cloudbusting
is not inconsistent in this respect. Kate  stated that the cloudbuster could
make it rain because Peter truly believed that the  cloudbuster could indeed
make it rain. It is the very &quot;weirdness&quot; of Peter's  experience and
point of view which attracts her. But this by no means indicates that  Kate
herself &quot;believes&quot; in the theories and inventions of Wilhelm Reich. On
the  contrary, if she truly accepted Reich's delusory universe as part of the
natural  world, its &quot;weirdness&quot; would be considerably reduced, and she
would probably not  consider it a &quot;fascinating&quot; subject for a song.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject:  spelling of Orgonon
</P>
<P>&gt; Then again, Kate spelled Orgonon wrong by mistake.... 
</P>
<P>IED is even more predisposed to mistrust Doug's citation re &quot;Nice to
Swallow&quot; in  light of his false claim immediately above. The fact is that
John Carder Bush was  once asked point blank about this very &quot;mis&quot;-spelling.
IED quotes his eminently  Bushian reply: &quot;It may have been intentional...&quot;
Furthermore, Doug knows this,  since IED has posted the information at least
once before. And it may very well be a  pun. If so, it's a pretty good one, and
quite appropriate, considering the nature of  Reich's theories about the
therapeutic effects of orgasm on the psyche. A pun much  like &quot;your sun's
coming out,&quot; from the same song. And IED has earlier suggested at  least
two other possible explanations for this spelling, in a Kate Bushological paper 
(&quot;Venturing into the Garden,&quot; in The Garden, Appendix A, Wickham
Street  Irregular Press, Los Angeles, 1985; also posted in L-Hs, now no doubt
somewhere in  the oldest mountains of L-Hs archives). 
</P>
<P>The curious are encouraged to seek out this paper, which discloses a few of 
IED's own modest notions concerning the possible larger meaning of Side One of 
Hounds of Love (a body of work too often slighted as &quot;light-weight&quot; in
comparison  with The Ninth Wave ).

<P>Date: Sat, 11 Nov 89 16:32 EST <BR> From: PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.edu
<BR> Subject: spelling of Orgonon, Kate says...
</P>
<P>I mention this not in my defense, but as background to Ed Suranyi's 
commendable concern with getting the record straight: 
</P>
<P>&gt; p manchester writes: 
</P>
<P>&gt;&gt; called &quot;The Organon Remix.&quot; Kate acknowledged in
correspondence that this  was a spelling error on her part, since Reich's ranch
in Maine was called &quot;Orgonon,&quot;  based on &quot;Orgone&quot; energy,
with an o. 
</P>
<P>&gt; For the record, Kate never said this in &quot;correspondence&quot;, at
least not that IED is  aware of. |&gt;oug claims (OK, informs us with
indisputable authority and  credibility--satisfied, |&gt;oug?) that Kate told
him it was &quot;unintentional&quot;. However,  John Carder Bush, when asked
directly about the spelling, replied, &quot;It could be  intentional.&quot;
Since both |&gt;oug and IED are now agreed that Kate cannot always be  believed,
you can take your pick of the available explanations of this spelling &quot;error&quot;.

</P>
<P>I was reporting from correspondence between me and Kate. The relevant 
paragraph of my letter to her of May 18, 1986 ran like this: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I am a 43 year old professor of philosophy and speculative theology,
which I  believe I can verify by my first remark, which is to complain
pedantically that Peter  Reich follows his father Dr. Reich's practice of
spelling 'Orgonon' as I have just  written it, with an 'o', from 'orgone'
energy, whereas your song title and lyrics for  &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; write
'Organon'. Organon was originally the title given to the five  logical treatises
of Aristotle by his editor of record, Andronicus of Rhodes. It has  thereafter
had some currency among philosophers as a title for a general  methodological
tractate, or an 'instrument of thought' in the sense of a fundamental  logical
mechanism. I would not put it past you to be aware of this fact, at least 
subliminally, and to have perpetrated a deliberate pun. But I rather suspect I
have  caught you in a spelling error. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course maybe you have a whole thing with A and O, Alpha and Omega&quot;:
my  ears hear the lyric in &quot;Not This Time&quot; as 
</P>
<P>To the A, to the O <BR> To the A, to the O <BR> To the O that's bursting
<BR> To keep me going and to keep the shit away. <BR> And certainly you're

</P>
<P> Finally, IED would like to congratulate Mr. Manchester on his success in
pinning  Kate down once and for all about the &quot;Organon&quot; issue--a
subject which has been the  focus of nearly limitless printouts of debate in
Love-Hounds during the past four  years. IED was heartened to see, from the
extract from Kate's letter to you, that the  error was detected by her before
the album was released, and that it was apparently  a typographical error which
came as a surprise to her; which indicates that it was  not made by Kate (or
John), but by the typesetters.

<BR> Subject: Reich vs Gardner 
</P>
<P>Just so's nobody thinks I don't have an opinion on the subject of Reich's 
cloudbusting, my 2 cents says read Peter's book before you go spouting  &quot;fundamentalist
materialist&quot; doctrine of the Martin Gardner/ CSICOP school. I'm  much more
willing to credit Reich's rainmaking ability than his contact with UFOs,  but
Peter witnessed both, and I'm not willing to dismiss his reports so baldly. 
</P>
<P>(BTW, I happened to get a phonecall from Peter just after HoL was released,
just  by chance at the mailorder place I was working. He said he'd spoken to KT
on the  phone, never met her (yet), approved of the video, thought Sutherland's
little  fist-punch was a little corny.) 
</P>
<P>Metaphysically speaking, though, the universe is much more magical than 
materialism imagines, my experience is that reality tends to adjust to your 
expectations in a much more interesting way than just perceptual delusions.

<BR> Subject: Orgonon/Organon 
</P>
<P>[re Peter's letter to KaTe re Orga/onon]
</P>
<P> 'Twas me. Actually, I wrote to her with a number of observations I had
about  the relationship of the video to &quot;A Book of Dreams,&quot; and used
the spelling natter  less as a question than as a 'hook' to catch her interest.
It seems to have worked. 
</P>
<P> The relevant paragraph from my letter to her (May 18, 1986): 
</P>
<P>&gt; I am a 43 year old professor of philosophy and speculative theology,
which I  believe I can verify by my first remark, which is to complain
pedantically that Peter  Reich follows his father Dr. Reich's practice of
spelling 'Orgonon' as I have just  written it, with an 'o', from 'orgone'
energy, whereas your song titles and lyrics  for &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; write
'Organon'. Organon was originally the title given to the  five logical treatises
of Aristotle by his editor of record, Andronicus of Rhodes. It has  thereafter
had some currency among philosophers as a title for a general  methodological
tractate, or an 'instrument of thought' in the sense of a fundamental  logical
mechanism. I would not put it past you to be aware of this fact, at least 
subliminally, and to have perpetrated a deliberate pun. But I rather suspect I
have  caught you in a spelling error. 
</P>
<P>And the relevant paragraph from her reply (not dated and postmark illegible,
but  about three weeks later): 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;I'm afraid the Orgonon mis-spelling IS a mistake and we were
aware of this as  soon as we saw the &quot;copy&quot;. It is very difficult to
correct everything and this one  slipped through my hands but I find it a
wonderful experience when errors of this  kind give birth to such fascinating
theories!&quot; 
</P>
<P> In Greek 'organon' simply means 'tool'. So an 'organ' is a tool (of life),
an  'organism' is a system of tools. In designating the logical treatises of
Aristotle as an  Organon, Andronicus of Rhodes interpreted them as a fundamental
set of 'tools'  for philosophical thinking (which may not have been Aristotle's
view at all). By the  Middle Ages, as medievalist Lionhart observes, this view
of logic as a 'primer'  became official and finally officious, provoking the
Englishman Francis Bacon to  publish a &quot;Novum Organum&quot; (1620)
rejecting medieval philosophy and instigating the  tradition of critical
empiricism that evolved into what today is called 'scientific  method'. Bacon
wrote in Latin, where the form is 'organum', but in English  translation his
work is entitled &quot;New Organon.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Two years ago someone speculated that the revisionist and anti-traditional
aspect  of Bacon's work might underlie the spelling in Kate's lyrics and titles
for CB. I  doubt it. I do still suppose that some sort of subliminal awareness
of the term  'organon' on Kate's part generated the initial misspelling, but
given her Catholic  schooling, it is far more likely to have been Aristotle than
Bacon. 
</P>
<P>It is interesting that the word 'orgasm' does NOT derive from the same root,
but  instead from a different Indo-European root that means 'to swell'. Wilhelm
Reich  may well have wanted on good scholarly grounds to emphasize the
difference by the  innovative spelling 'orgone' for his postulated
hyper-Freudian life-energy. The  name he gave his ranch in Maine, Orgonon, is
based on that eccentric spelling, and  violates the regular linguistic laws of
formation for the particular Greek root, though  once again with the advantage
that it makes clear that he is NOT talking about an  'organon'. 
</P>
<P>To throw in one last twist, it could be that the Reichian spelling of
Orgone/  Orgonon is behind the video's placement of the ranch with the
cloudbusters in  Oregon (instead of Maine). In which case we have a NEW slip/
pun to take up with  Kate.

<P>&gt;&gt; 5. Patrick Moores Dream - A Book Of Dreams by Peter Reich is one

<P>&gt; Patrick Moore is a world-renowned English, popular astronomer.

<P>which is why &quot;the big sky&quot; makes sense. what else would an
