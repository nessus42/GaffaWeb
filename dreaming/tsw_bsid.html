<P>As for the new song, &quot;I'm Still Waiting&quot;, well, it's absolutely
terrific. It's got  quite a good beat -- you could actually dance to it, I
think.

</P>
<P>I disagree completely with your original assessment of &quot;I'm Still
Waiting&quot;,  finding it to be the strongest number among the recent releases
(the new album, the  remixed TWW, Be Kind...). It's also rough around the edges,
but it IS a B-side,  after all. Isn't that what B-sides are often for? To give
the artist a chance to release  something that's either not quite &quot;finished&quot;,
a little risky, or something that just  didn't fit with the rest of an album
release. This particular song sounds to me like  something done around the time
of HOL. 
</P>
<P>Like I said, I think it's the best song Kate's released lately. It kills me
the first  time she sings the low, rolling, hoarse growls of &quot;waitin'&quot;
and &quot;wailin'&quot; in: 
</P>
<P>'Cos I'm still waitin' <BR> Well, baby I'm still wailin' 
</P>
<P>And that grinding, stuttering screech near the end is definitely the Kate we
all  know and love. 
</P>
<P>Your original blast at the song was so far off-base (Wish I'd kept the
posting, but  it's long gone) that I suspect you were just trying to stir up
some action. Sorry I  didn't call you any names or tell you how stupid you are,
but this is the best I can  do. 
</P>

jsd%UMASS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu (Jonathan S. Drukman) <BR> Subject: Ken is the
leader of the GLC!!! 
</P>
<P>Wow. I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it... I'm about to lose control,
and I  THINK I LIKE IT!! 
</P>
<P>The reason for this (and my resorting to this incredibly lame account) is
that I  want to urge you all to run out and get either the Love and Anger CD
single or the  &quot;Aspects of TSW&quot; disc because you have got to hear &quot;Ken.&quot;
Kate has finally gotten  off her &quot;female energy&quot; kick and she's also
got a wicked sense of humor from  somewhere (Safeways? Nah...) 
</P>
<P>I almost barfed up a lung when I heard the opening beat and then those
terrible  Fairlight horns (what an inept arrangement! what a lousy patch!!)...
but those  LYRICS! Kate shrieks, rattles and rolls! She starts off with some
unbelievably dumb  and cliched couplet, but it's all uphill from there. KATE IS
SCREAMING THE  LYRICS TO &quot;RAWHIDE&quot; IN THE BRIDGE! Did you ever think
you'd hear her say  &quot;Who's a funky sex machine?&quot; I sure didn't, but
she does, and it's great. 
</P>
<P>In the immortal words of our humble pseudo-moderator, &quot;'Ken' is
BITCHIN'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>/j/ 
</P>
<P>&quot;Who's the man we all need? KEN! 
</P>
<P>Who's the funky sex machine? KEN!&quot;

</P>
<P>Hello there fellow Love-Hounds--
</P>
<P> Just wanted to let you all know that I attended a local record convention
the  other week and was lucky enough to find a virtual treasure trove of KT
stuff. The  first thing I snagged was Aspects of the Sensual World CD for $7
(reasonable, I  thought). So far, I like &quot;I'm Still Waiting&quot; the best.
The next item I found was a  Love and Anger CD which has the songs &quot;The
Confrontation&quot; and &quot;One Last Look  Around the House Before We Leave&quot;
(or something to that effect), for $7, and the 7&quot;  vinyl version of Love
and Anger which has the nice gatefold with the stills from the  video. This was
ALSO $7.
