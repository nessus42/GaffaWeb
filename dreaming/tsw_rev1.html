<P>KATE'S SENSUAL WORLD 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush releases a new single, The Sensual World, on EMI on September 18. 
Details are also emerging this week about her forthcoming album, also titled The
 Sensual World, which is due for release on October 16. 
</P>
<P>The single, written and produced by Bush, is backed with Walk Straight Down 
the Middle, a non-LP cut which may, however, appear on the album's cassette and 
CD formats. The cassette single is the same as the seven-inch, while the 12-inch
and  CD versions contain an instrumental version of The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>Bush, on vocals and keyboards, is joined by boyfriend Del Palmer on bass,
Charlie  Morgan (drums), Davey Spillane (Uillean pipes), Donal Lunny (bouzouki),
John  Sheahan (fiddle) and Paddy Bush on whips! The accompanying video was
directed  by Kate Bush in tandem with Peter Richardson. 
</P>
<P>Other musicians on the album--her first since Hounds of Love four years 
ago--include Alan Stivell on Celtic harp and backing vocals, Mick Karn, who 
supplies bass on one track, and Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour on guitar on two
tracks--  Love and Anger and Rocket's Tail. Another track, This Woman's Work,
will be  heard on a film soundtrack &lt;sic&gt;, although details on this are so
far not being issued. 
</P>
<P>----------
</P>
<P>Obviously someone goofed up on the last bit (about This Woman's Work ): it 
should have read something like: &quot;Another track, This Woman's Work, has
already  been heard on a film soundtrack (to the movie She's Having a Baby ).&quot;
IED suspects  the details that have not so far been issued on this are in
respect to whether the U.S.  IRS-label soundtrack LP will be released in the UK
or not, or whether This  Woman's Work will only be made available in England on
Kate's own The Sensual  World album. It's pretty much certain, though, that TWW
will be taking up space  on TSW. 
</P>
<P>Mick Karn, erstwhile fretless bass-player for the now-long-defunct band
Japan,  has played with Kate once before--on bass during Kate's live performance
of The  Wedding List at the 1981 Prince's Trust Gala concert. IED is especially
pleased to  learn that these two have collaborated again.

<P>Here's the review of The Sensual World from this weeks Sounds. 
</P>
<P> Kate has often balanced precariously between Home Counties humdrum and 
absolute eroticism. Here she swings to the latter like never before, capturing
the  purity necessary to sex as worship. Talk dirty to us Kate: &quot;Then I
take a kiss of  seedcake/ Go deep sex, go down.&quot; This is sex sucessfully
rendered as the opposite of  prurience. 
</P>
<P>--[&quot;..deep sex&quot; ???? It's actually &quot;...deep south&quot;, they
do hear only, what they  want to hear! --WIE] 
</P>
<P>Abandoning the intellect for the intuition (&quot;Stepping out of the page
into the  sensual world&quot;), but craftily hanging onto the aesthetic
perspective that mankind has  spent so long acquiring, this is a lovely
evocation of the moment. 
</P>
<P>The way it encompasses the opulent production tech, instead of being 
overpowered by it, is crucial, as is the vocalising on the repeated &quot;Uhhmm,
yeah&quot;. A  moment of meta-verbal magic in the tradition of Larry Blackmon's &quot;oww&quot;,
this is  pop at its best. 
</P>
<P>Reviewed by Roy Wilkinson 
</P>
<P>There is also a page and a half advert for the single (also in NME and
probably  the other papers as well) of which one whole page is a photo. 
</P>
<P>Be seeing you.

<P>Somebody earlier posted the review of the single from Sounds , but I haven't
 seen anybody post the review from the Sept. 23 issue of New Musical Express .
So I  will. First of all, it's one of two &quot;Singles of the Week&quot;.
Sounds good already, doesn't  it? Here's the review: 
</P>
<P> You would have to be a very miserable schmuck indeed not to concede that
Kate  Bush has made some exceptional disques. &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;
springs to mind  immediately -- as does her welcome fear of ever being seen in
public once the  album hits the Top Three. Going about this business privately
is something Guns  N'Roses should consider. Maybe then they could fashion
something as charming as  this. 
</P>
<P>There is always a Gestation Period between first hearing her new 45 and 
pronouncing it to be another tablet of genius. But &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
feels good  already -- and if the notion of the artiste slipping a line like, &quot;I
take a kiss of  seedcake right from his mouth&quot; isn't enough to make at
least half her audience  scramble for the Our Price, then what is? 
</P>
<P>A gentle curtain of cathedral bells call the listener in before Kate enters
(and  remains) at a very slight kilter. She's relaxing (in an afterglow, mayhap)
all the way,  while an enchanting forest of oboes, clarinets and strings take at
least half the kudos  for the overall effect. 
</P>
<P>Like it now, love it tomorrow, and adore it in a few weeks. This is Betty
Blue on  vinyl.

<P>1) Various items from the Sept. 23 issue of Record Mirror. 
</P>
<P>A) A short article: 
</P>
<P> WHERE IN THE WORLD 
</P>
<P>Nobody could ever accuse Kate Bush of rushing her career. Instead of rushing
out  album after album, Kate prefers to take a back seat in the fast food pop
race,  laboring away in her picturesque farmhouse in Kent. 
</P>
<P>It's not that Kate's trying to cultivate an image as an eccentric musician
who  locks herself away from the world, it's just that she's a total
perfectionist who will  spend weeks, months, even years getting her ideas just
right. 
</P>
<P>Now though, after a four year gap, Kate will follow up her 1985 album &quot;Hounds
of  Love&quot; with &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, out on October 16. The first
taster from Kate's  new album is the title track, released as a single this
week. Although it's classic  Kate Bush, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is a lot
less angry and mellower than &quot;Hounds of  Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Bulgarian singing group Trio Bulgarka are featured on three of the tracks,
such  as &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;, and other folky influences include uillean
pipes, a bouzouki and  Kate's brother Paddy on whips. That's right, whips! 
</P>
<P>There's bad news, though. Kate has no plans to play live. Her first and last
tour  was in 1979 and it seems that even wild hounds couldn't drag her back on
the road  now. 
</P>
<P>Besides, with all the hours she needs to work on her albums, where would she
 find the time? 
</P>
<P> B) A review of the single: 
</P>
<P>Kate's so clever nowadays she writes *and* produces her records. She's also
got  bloomin' sexy with &quot;Sensual World&quot; in which talk of desire,
touching and Kate's  own breasts is rife. But these aren't merely shock tactics.
&quot;Sensual&quot; is a delicate and  all-consuming song. It even features
Paddy Bush on whips!! Easy now. 
</P>
<P> C) A letter to the editor: 
</P>
<P> WHAT KATY DID 
</P>
<P>Hello! So inspired was I by Gary's Fuzzbox poem ( rm September 9) that I've 
decided to write one of my own (about Kate Bush): 
</P>
<P>Hey folks! She's back you know, <BR> Picking you up when you're feeling low
<BR> She's so cool, she's so ace <BR> No one else could take her place <BR>
She is fab, she is lush <BR> Of course it's none other than Kate Bush <BR> Go
on now, listen to her groovy new track <BR> Boy I missed you -- welcome back!  
</P>
<P> -- Lilly Lionheart, Tycoch, Swansea 
</P>
<P> The editor writes: 
</P>
<P> Do you think you could put this poem on tape and send it to me, Lilly? No,
it's  not that I think it's good or anything, I'd just like to hear you rhyming
&quot;lush&quot; with  &quot;Bush&quot;! 
</P>
<P>It seems that my attempts to stop people sending poems to the Letters page
have  failed. If we must have them then can we have some about either Debbie
Gibson,  Neil Tennant or Simply Red please. 
</P>
<P>There's a small picture of Kate with the caption &quot;KATE: the lush Ms
Bush gives  us a blush&quot;

<P>2) A review of the single from the Sept. 23 issue of Kerrang, a British
heavy metal  (!) magazine: 
</P>
<P>She still hasn't married. I just wanted to let you know that before we
began:  Kate is A Single Woman, apart from that dodgy bassist she shares a flat
with. Hell,  this even comes complete with a pic of her softly caressing a
peach, her fingers  gently kneading the soft fuzz of the skin, and when she
sings, she sings of a deep  sensuality that ensures that I have to wear baggy
trousers when I dance. Beautiful,  warm and ever lasting. I want, I want, I
want.. . 
</P>
<P>I must say I never heard Del Palmer referred to as &quot;that dodgy bassist&quot;
before.

<P>From The Guardian Thursday 12th October, Rock/Pop reviews by 
</P>
<P>Robin Denselow 
</P>
<P>[end of John Cale review] Ambitious, but it's hard to see which market this
will  appeal to. 
</P>
<P>If it weren't for the fact that her single The Sensual World is already in
the Top  Ten, it would be tempting to say the same thing about Kate Bush. The
Warbling One  is back with her first studio album in four years, and it's not so
much a collection of  strong songs (with the notable exception of the
piano-backed final ballard), as a  collection of rhythmic, drifting mood pieces
that ought to be far more interesting  considering the remarkable selection of
musicians involved. 
</P>
<P>There's Davey Spillane with his uillean pipes and whistle, Nigel Kennedy on 
violin, Dave Gilmour on guitar, Michael Nyman conducting the orchestra, and even
 the exhilarating and powerful harmony group the Trio Bulgarka adding backing 
vocals. 
</P>
<P>They must have been utterly baffled by what was going on, especially if Ms
Bush  explained her lyrics to them. They are first heard, chanting eerily on a
song about  loneliness and word processing (&quot;I turn to my computer like a
friend ...&quot;), and later  appear, with the unlikely backing of a spacy
Gilmour guitar theme, on a song about  dressing as a witch and leaping off
Waterloo Bridge holding on to a rocket. 
</P>
<P>The review appeared along side the Adam Sweeting interview with Kate I
posted  yesterday. The top headline was &quot;Our two critics differ over Kate
Bush's album.  She's just pleased it's stopped people asking her about sex.&quot;

<P>The review from Oct. 14 Sounds : 
</P>
<P>BODY HEAT 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; (EMI EMD 1010/CD) ***1/2 
</P>
<P>Isn't the single absolutely withoug equal? Especially the way the &quot;mmh
yes&quot;  punctuation gets progressively more urgent as the song unwinds. There
is really no  doubt about it, when Kate Bush says &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
is &quot;a string expression of  positive female energy&quot; she isn't kidding.
That 45 proves that she's come a long way  from &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
and is now writing approximations of the soundtrack to  Body Heat. Stunning
stuff. 
</P>
<P>That song is the best thing on this, her sixth album. It's probably her best
song to  date, although -- lyrically at least -- it's possibly rivalled by &quot;Rocket's
Tail&quot; and &quot;The  Fog&quot; for classic Bush-like unsettling,
mesmerising undertones. 
</P>
<P>The former, a powerful evocation of what can only be perceived as the
madness  of childhood, has backing vocals by The Trio Bulgarka, one of several
brave  arrangements on the album. She even gets old sponsor Dave Gilmour to chip
in on  guitar. 
</P>
<P>The latter, ostensibly comparing a love affair to the father/daughter
relationship,  is all the odder for having lines of dialogue recited by Kate
Bush's actual father.  Does he know what he's supposed to be talking about? A
weight of Celtic  instrumentation (including violinist Nigel Kennedy at last
getting a chance to play  something decent in the rock sphere) provides one of
her most enthralling musical  tableaux. 
</P>
<P>These are the album's best songs, although nothing on the record is below
par,  not even the awkward punchline of &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;. To
expect a classic after  a four year wait is to underestimate the demons of
experimentation that inspired  Kate Bush to make, for example, the outrageous
monster The Dreaming in 1982  when the world demanded some of those nice piano
ballads. She's still the most  inspired non-conformist in commercial music. 
</P>
<P>What you're required to deal with on The Sensual World is just as she says: &quot;my
 most personal and female album so far.&quot; And, if you've been listening
since &quot;The  Man With The Child In His Eyes,&quot; you'll appreciate that
that makes this one pretty  staggering in scope. I can't wait to see some of
these wild and tormented songs  making it into the charts. 
</P>
<P> -- David Cavanagh 
</P>
<P>The review from Oct. 14 Melody Maker : 
</P>
<P>FULL BLOOM 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World EMI 
</P>
<P>&quot;When Lauren was a small girl, she would stand in the field and call
the cats.  Only by one they would come to her through the grass, across which
lay the ice of  the coming winter; and she could see them in the light of the
moon.. . She herself  wondered why they came. They were wild and heeded no one
else; their thrashing  in the fields did the farmers no good and Lauren's father
hated the howl they  invested in the night, like a thousand bleeding babies in
the grass. But they came for  her and it was certain therefore, because of that,
that she was in some way special.  Perhaps, she was to wonder 20 years later,
they came for the same reason she came  to see them, all crucifixes of shadow
and the army of lights like knives, and she was  beautiful like that too&quot;
-- from &quot;Days Between Stations&quot; by Steve Erickson. 
</P>
<P>Even reading the record company's biography of Kate Bush -- that too is like
 beginning a breathless windswept novel -- &quot;her father is an avid piano
player and  her mother is an Irish woman who takes much joy in music and
dancing. Kate and  her two brothers were raised with an open mind to artistic
experiments.&quot; Signed to  EMI before leaving school, Kate never had to worry
too much about real life. I guess  she never had to put the muse on ice because
a gas bill had to be paid. Quite right.  Let's protect the artists. In 1977 her
first single was &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, her first  album The Kick
Inside, the rest is.. . 
</P>
<P>We should be eternally grateful that Kate was never stiffed by mundane
reality,  by having to get by, was always allowed complete freedom of expression
in a  non-contemporary fashion. Her confidence grows and we benefit from a music
 which is so naturally *outside*, so gracefully *above* the sweatings and
strainings of  those who *strive* to be alternative, so instinctively *other*.
Because Kate Bush's  music emanates from a grander reality, an inner truth, from
the breed of verity  which is being increasingly blitzed out and rendered nearly
extinct by the  advertising age, the decade of computer games and fast
everything which Martin  Amis lampooned so accurately in &quot;Money&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush takes her time, acts like she lives in a leafy vacuum with her
heart,  and every so often sends out a record as a message in a bottle. Like all
her best  achievements, this album marries the physical honesty and self-pride
of Marvin Gaye  to the querying passionate intelligence of, say, Elizabeth
Smart, and gives birth to a  rare mystical and aesthetic precision. 
</P>
<P>Somehow &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is both the most feminine song ever
recorded  *and* ethereally androgynous. At no stage does its account of female
sensitivity and  sexuality *exclude* the man, or sneer at him, as do so many
hamfisted attempts at a  still largely untapped subject. And yet it's as womanly
as womanly gets -- &quot;All the  *powers* of a woman's body.&quot; You can
sense (with every sense) the singer's  awareness of hips, breasts, &quot;sparks&quot;
-- it's both narcissistic and innocent. Innocent  because total, unashamed.
Innuendo doesn't come into it. Everything is as pure and  committed as.. .as a
river. Yes, it's a record which reduces me to impotence in the  face of similes.
It is, I now realize, *pure sex*. It's that romantic. Joyce's Ulysses has  been
lured so far off the page it's downing tools and damning academia. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush seems acutely conscious of the gap between the infinite potential
of  the dream and the finite fancies of reality (reality being for her, as we
have said, the  life of the heart in the home). There's a song later, called &quot;Never
Be Mine&quot;, where  she's making an apparently anti-love statement sound like
love in bloom: &quot;I want you  as the dream, not the reality.. .this is where
I want to be.. .the thrill and the hurting  will never be mine.&quot; It
disturbed me that in our times, even Kate Bush -- our last  Bronte, our last
Mishima -- was backing off from amour fou, but gradually what the  songs here
demonstrate is that she's neither a saucer-eyed dim dewy damsel who's  read too
many amor vincit omnia tomes *or* a sceptical she-puma suffering the first 
blast of doubt. 
</P>
<P>She acknowledges both the successes and failures, the flourishes and damp
squibs  of romantic idealism. &quot;Between A Man And A Woman&quot; seems
indecipherable until  you realise she's addressing a third party. The third
party could as easily be what  Jane Siberry calls &quot;la jalouse&quot; as an
animate entity, but if ever anyone could make  ambivalence strike and stick like
psychosis it's Bush. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love And Anger&quot; (again it's unspecified which she's praising,
which she's  berating -- or is she equating the two?) is musically the closest
approximation to  &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, but &quot;The Fog&quot; is an
unprecedented swirl of strings and harps, which  features her father teaching
her how to &quot;grow up.&quot; Such little-girl-lost tactics would  be trite
from most others but Kate has the Gaelic knack and imaginative energy of  the
born storyteller. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Reaching Out&quot; also seems obsessed with the family, with the child
and the  parent, but drives its puzzles with a joyous chorus. It has an apropos
grandeur that  makes charming aspirants like All About Eve sound like hooligans
on crutches. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot; closes side one. Here the young girl is
seduced by a  shadowy Devil, who could well be Hitler. Mmm. Yes. &quot;It
couldn't be you, it's a  picture of Hitler!&quot; I can't think of anyone else
who could get away with setting such  high-blown and supremely dodgy themes to
pop music. Her chief sleight of hand is  that, despite the orchestrations and
overlays, it *is* pop music. As it cascades out on a  repetition of &quot;he go
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, he go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh.. .&quot;  Kate Bush represents
both philosopher and love object. Gertrude Stein and, oh, Ava  Gardner. It is,
need I tell you, a triumphant combination. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; coaxes us into the sparser second side.
It's one of those  heart-breaking poignant ballads she arranges so skillfully to
avoid corn, and  whispers to avoid pomp. A chilly tale of a lonely someone who
becomes obsessed  with their personal computer &quot;as the people here grow
colder&quot;, it almost lapses into  Peter Gabriel terrain when The Trio
Bulgarka swan in, but our heroine's vocal  range and risktaking keep it on good
terms with the alien inside us all. The  Bulgarians take up more and more of the
stage as the album climaxes. She obviously  wanted to utilise them as an extra
instrument. So she does so. When Kate Bush gets  it right, you get the
impression everything's as effortless for her as making wafting  strides through
Victorian snowstorm forests in loopy videos. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; washes in on a flood of tears, exuding more
mystere than the  average constellation. Its story is a rather confused conceit
about someone standing  on Waterloo Bridge wanting to be a stick on fire, but by
the halfway point you really  wouldn't find it objectionable if she was singing
&quot;Little Bo Peep&quot; or &quot;Blue Is The  Colour&quot;. In this context,
the most cliched guitar solo in rock history comes in and  stabs your lungs,
Bush and the Bulgarians rise to a glorious vocal tussle which right  now sounds
like the greatest East-West artistic collaboration of the century. 
</P>
<P>The coda is &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;. We're told this was written for a
John  Hughes film. Tarkovsky would be more fitting. When Kate and her piano are 
singing with so much heaven in their blood, the state of music in 1989 is not a 
reference point. Her excape within is so determined and unqualified it's
infectious.  And radiant with infections. 
</P>
<P>Once every few years, the burning Bush completes a chapter in her work and
it's  like a visitation from a guardian angel. Like flowers are never really out
of vogue.  Like slow dancing with the lights out and the windows open. The Blue
Nile have a  challenger for the most impossibly beautiful music of the year, but
it's not a contest.  It's not even a year. Kate Bush is Kate Bush, and thank
Christ for that. She appeals  to the feral elemental child in every woman, and
if you think she only appeals to  every man for one reason then frankly, you
know nothing about anything and I  can't help you. The sensual world is a world
without end. Let's get it on.

<P>Review of The Sensual World from The Times, Friday October 13th. 
</P>
<P> A little girl lost in waffle 
</P>
<P>David Sinclair 
</P>
<P>While there has always been something faintly ridiculous about Kate Bush's 
over-mannered vocal style, her best songs have had a tang as sharp as fresh
lemon  on the palate. It is not a quality to be found in the current single, &quot;The
Sensual  World&quot;, a drifting piece of atmospheric waffle. 
</P>
<P>The number is, unfortunately, typical of the album of the same title, a
woefully  studio-bound extravaganza which, in the wake of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;,
it has taken La  Bush no less than four years to complete. She has overplayed
her hand and the  collection is beset by a sluggish undertow resulting from too
many meandering or  overwrought arrangements being applied to melodies of a
generally slight and  nebulous nature. 
</P>
<P>You can sense the cabin fever taking grip as she sings about falling in love
with a  talking computer in &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, or discovering
that a charming  boyfriend is really Adolf Hitler in &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;.
Now in her thirties,  Bush continues to apply the language of an adult to a
romaticised fantasy world-view  that does not seem to have altered significantly
since she was 12. &quot;The Fog&quot; and  &quot;Reaching Out&quot; are both
laden with regression-to-childhood themes delivered in  that irritating
little-girl-lost voice. 
</P>
<P>Two tracks stand out from the pack - &quot;Never be Mine&quot;, a poignant
ballard in the  classic Bush mould, and &quot;Rocket's Tail (For Rocket)&quot; -
a thumping, slow rocker that  begins with the erection of a gorgeous
lattice-work of a cappella harmony vocals  courtesy of the Bulgarian all-woman
troupe, the Trio Bulgarka, before being  battered into a pulp by the muscular
guitar soloing of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. 
</P>
<P>Despite the painstaking attention to detail, a nagging impression that she
has lost  the initiative remains.

<P>NEWSDAY review 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is one of the great enigmas of the rock world. A self-taught
musician  and composer, she rocketed to fame 12 years ago, at 17, on her debut
single  &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Ever since, she's attracted a worldwide
following despite  almost never performing live and taking three years between
albums. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; is Bush's first album since her 1985 hit &quot;Hounds
of Love,&quot;  and it picks up where the earlier record left off (which doesn't
mean it is as good a  record). Her music is still devoted to love and sexuality,
but Bush's writing is more  stridently personal here, as she carries us through
the downbeat imagery of the  title-track--a semi-sequel to &quot;Running Up That
Hill&quot;--and the self-explanatory  &quot;Love and Anger.&quot; Also included
is &quot;This Woman's Work,&quot; a song of male regret  over the separation of
the sexes, sung wrenchingly by Bush in the first person. 
</P>
<P>Bush's lyrics here are even denser and more complex than those on &quot;Hounds
of  Love.&quot; On &quot;Rocket's Tail,&quot; she sings about being &quot;dressed
as a rocket on Waterlook  Bridge,&quot; which should send her fans scrambling by
the millions for the old Vivien  Leigh movie &quot;Waterloo Bridge,&quot; the
way they did for &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; The  album's production is
equally dense, and that is the album's major flaw--despite  being her own
producer, Bush's voice is often buried beneath layers of instruments.  Violin
virtuoso Nigel Kennedy, harpist Alan Stivell and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour  all
guest on the record and their names are impressive, but a cleaner mix would've 
been preferable. 
</P>
<P>Still, &quot;The Sensual World,&quot; like its predecessor, challenges
conventional notions of  sexuality, sex roles, and romance--all of which makes
her success and fandom, as a  kind of anti-Madonna, that much more startling.
--Bruce Eder (NEWSDAY Sunday  10/22/89, Part II, p. 19) 
</P>
<P>Bruce should get himself a new stereo; I think the mix and the whole
production  are utterly radiant. Of course I'm a fan of the ORIGINAL mix of &quot;Ne
T'en Fui Pas&quot;.  The fun is to go swimming into the sound after her.
Omnidirectional speakers are a  big plus.

<BR> Subject: REVIEW: The Sensual World (The Independent), October 1989
</P>
<P>album review, from &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, Friday 20th Oct or
Saturday  21st... (sorry: i was given an incomplete cutting). note the reviewer
gives the wrong  catalogue number, which i think is for the CD single. 
</P>
<P> KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World (EMI EMD 1010) 
</P>
<P>For The Sensual World, Kate reaches once more into her bag of improving 
literature and comes up not with Bronte or Gurdjieff but Joyce, which is a far
more  entertaining prospect -- especially when, as on the hit title track, she
casts herself as  Molly Bloom, yes yes. This is the over-educated girl become
woman in a way that  echoes the hearty Romantic indulgences of her earlier work,
and the result is a  complex, deeply-textured body of songs of diverse styles
but cumulative effect. 
</P>
<P>The effect of Side One is to leave you like a fly drowning in honey, a
pleasurable  surfeit of sweet stimulation which cloys only when &quot;Reaching
Out&quot; verges on the  crassly anthemic. The effect of Side Two is more
emotionally stirring, not least  because of the presence of the voices of the
Trio Bulgarka on three tracks, a musical  leitmotif suggesting an almost
religious abandon. Like her friend and occasional  collaborator Peter Gabriel,
she re-combines widely differing strains of &quot;world&quot; music  to good
effect, be it the matching of Davey Spillane's whistles, Alan Stivell's Celtic 
harp and Nigel Kennedy's violin on &quot;The Fog&quot;, or, more sensuous still,
the blending  of Spillane's uillean pipes, Eberhard Weber's ghostly electric
double bass and the  Trio Bulgarka's ecstatic harmonies on &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;.

</P>
<P>Kate believes this to be her &quot;most personal and female album&quot;, and
though it's  not that far removed from Hounds of Love, there is a luxuriance in
her musical  textures that goes way beyond anything she has done before.
Listening to The  Sensual World is rather like entering a cathedral, which makes
a change from her  earlier records, which often felt like entering a convent.

<P>Date: Wed, 25 Oct 89 12:44:39 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: The Oct. 28 Billboard 
</P>
<P>Well, I managed to get my own copy of the Oct. 28 Billboard, as I said I
would  yesterday. Here are the details: 
</P>
<P>First, as I said, &quot;Love And Anger&quot; entered the Modern Rock Tracks
chart at  number 13. In the place where the label and number go, it says, &quot;Columbia
LP  Track&quot;. This is the strongest evidence yet that, at least at the time
this chart was  made up, there was *no* single available for the public to
purchase. I hope a real  single does come out sometime. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, the song would have debuted even higher if it weren't for the
fact  that KITS, which is a major contributor to this chart, perversely
continues to play  &quot;The Sensual World&quot; instead. The entire staff at
Nob Hill Florists requested it this  morning, and it was played for them. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, back to Billboard. There's a full page ad for the album. It is a
picture of  the album, and on the right side it says: 
</P>
<P> KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>&quot;THE SENSUAL WORLD&quot; 
</P>
<P>A NEW REALM OF SENSATION 
</P>
<P>WRITTEN AND PRODUCED BY KATE <BR> ON COLUMBIA 
</P>
<P>Next, there's a short (like all Billboard reviews) review of the album. It's
listed  under &quot;Picks&quot;, which is a good sign. In fact it's the only
album listed under that  category this week. Here's what they say: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Producer: Kate Bush Columbia 44164 
</P>
<P>Besides her incredible voice, Bush's strongest point has always been her
ability to  acutely sum up female sensuality without ever crossing the line
between erotic and  crass; being tantalizingly coy without being too cute. She
achieves all that on this, her  first new studio album in four years.
Additionally, this is some of the most intriguing,  ethereal music she has
written. She's greatly aided by Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka on  several cuts,
including &quot;Between A Man And A Woman.&quot; Also tops are &quot;This 
Woman's Work,&quot; and &quot;Love And Anger.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yes, I know that the Trio does *not* appear on BAMAAW. But who cares, as
long  as the review is good?

<P>From: rael@cbnews.ATT.COM (c.daniel.vanevic) <BR> Date: 26 Oct 89 01:28:58
GMT <BR> Subject: NPR's Kate Bush's &quot;The Sensual World&quot; Article 
</P>
<P>Love-Hounds, 
</P>
<P>Here's a transcription of an article on &quot;The Sensual World&quot; that
National Public  Radio aired in &quot;All Things Considered&quot; today (10/25).
Since a lot of people are  posting interviews, I figured I should do my part.
Oh, and before I forget, I'm glad  to hear that Northern California Love-Hounds
have made it OK through the  earthquake (at least as far as I now ... I'm 50 or
so articles behind). 
</P>
<P>NPR's article follows ... 
</P>
<P>NPR: Hers is a voice that people either love or they don't. A distinctive,
powerful  silvery sound. The voice of Kate Bush. She's just released her sixth
album. It's  called &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. Here to talk with us about it
is Anthony DeCurtis  (sp?), senior writer at Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>NPR: Now, the title song &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is aptly named. It's
layers upon layers  of sounds which make it sensual. 
</P>
<P>ADC: Exactly. One of the things that Kate Bush does on &quot;The Sensual
World&quot; is she  uses Uillean Pipes and the Bouzouki, which is kind of a
Greek mandolin. Kind of  folk instruments that she weaves into essentially a
song that's based on Molly  Bloom's soliloquy (sp?) at the end of James Joyce's
&quot;Ulysses&quot;. That's very  characteristic on her part. She's kind of a
highly literate romantic with a capital  &quot;R&quot;. Her first record was
called &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. So, in &quot;The Sensual World&quot;  we
get this kind of very layered, highly literary, very internal kind of world of 
womanly emotions and feelings and sensuality. 
</P>
<P>NPR: And that refrain that we get from &quot;Ulysses&quot;: &quot;yes, yes,
yes&quot; 
</P>
<P>&lt; portion of TSW is played &gt; 
</P>
<P>NPR: You mentioned Davey Spillane's Uillean Pipes, Donal Lunny on Bouzouki. 
These are traditional Irish musicians. It's a sort of a fad, I guess now, to use
 international musicians on albums. Like Paul Simon and his African musicians.
On  this one she has a trio of Bulgarian women singers: &quot;The Trio Bulgarka&quot;,
and I  must say that it's a really beautiful combination with her voice on, well
... the  song &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; for example. 
</P>
<P>&lt; portion of RT is played &gt; 
</P>
<P>ADC: It is a bit of a fad to use foreign musicians, musicians from other
countries.  But Kate Bush does it, I think, with a great deal of appropriateness
and it's  something that works very well. And &quot;The Trio Bulgarka&quot;,
again ... you know ...  from Bulgaria, lend a kind of keening quality to &quot;Rocket's
Tail&quot;, which is a song  that is characteristic of what Bush does in that it
seems, in a way, to interweave  almost ... you know ... rocket technology and
witchcraft as this very sort of  modern contemporary feel to it at the same time
as there is this older folkloric  (sp?), almost kind of mystical feel. In
addition to &quot;Trio Bulgarka&quot; we have Dave  Gilmour on guitar. Gilmour
is the guitarist for &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; who discovered Kate  Bush when she
was 16 years old in 1977 and ... you know ... along with some of  these other
more exotic elements, there's a strong electric guitar presence that  Gilmour
provides on &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&lt; Gilmour's RT guitar solo blasts out &gt; 
</P>
<P>NPR: Anthony DeCurtis ... Kate Bush has a big following in England. She's
sort of a  cult figure here. I mean, she does have her fans, but it's not a
large group of  people on this side of the Atlantic. Why do you think that is? 
</P>
<P>ADC: There are a couple of factors, I think, that contribute to that. One is
that ...  there is a very strong Anglo-Irish folk quality to her music that's a
little difficult  to translate here in the US. But I think the main issue is:
Kate Bush doesn't like  to travel. She's afraid of flying and I think that that
limits her audience. A third  factor is: her music doesn't sound like what you
hear on commercial radio and ...  you know ... you just don't hear those &quot;pumping
beats&quot; that characterize most of  what you hear on pop radio and so it's
hard for her to find a place to get heard.  If Madonna say is &quot;the material
girl&quot;, we might think of Kate Bush as &quot;the  ethereal girl&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&lt; &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; starts playing &gt; 
</P>
<P>NPR: Anthony DeCurtis is a senior writer at Rolling Stone. He spoke with us
about  Kate Bush's newest album: &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&lt; NBM continues playing through NPR's ATC closing credits &gt;

</P>
<P>I don't think anyone's posted this review yet, so here it is, from the Oct.
14  Record Mirror. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' EMI 
</P>
<P>Four years in the making, 'The Sensual World' features the lushest material
of  Kate Bush's career. 
</P>
<P>While 'Hounds Of Love' was very often an angry album, 'The Sensual World' 
caresses your face and soothes. But don't think for a minute that Kate is
settling  back into a comfortable niche. Her uncompromising spirit is still
there with even  some hints of subtle menace. 
</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, 'The Sensual World' is a romantic album; with Kate, a woman 
who likes to adopt many roles, playing an earth mother figure throughout much of
 it. She warmly catalogues a whole range of mixed emotions, from child
experiences,  to adult relationships and even the secret desires of one of her
cats! 
</P>
<P>'Love And Anger' is a quite superb piece of soul searching with 'The Fog' 
providing some excellent counterpoints before 'Reaching Out,' gentle but strong
all  at the same time. 
</P>
<P>But cosey and endearing as 'The Sensual Touch' [sic] is, the songs are never
 allowed to become twee, especially the track 'Heads We're Dancing', a ghostly
tale  of love and war. 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' is warm, wholesome and stimulating. The wait for a new 
Kate Bush album has been well worth it.

<P>Date: Thu, 26 Oct 89 21:23:56 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review of the album from the Oct. 21 New Musical Express

</P>
<P>Here's the review of the album from the Oct. 21 New Musical Express. (Yes,
it's  yet another rave.) 
</P>
<P>LET THEM EAT KATE 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World (EMI LP/Cassette/CD) 
</P>
<P>Four years to produce one LP works out at ten minutes per year of 'The
Sensual  World', with an extra three minutes 48 for cassette and CD buyers. This
means that  Kate Bush is either very lazy or very dedicated. 'The Sensual World'
is an album,  luckily, which suggests the later. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush doesn't have the easy options open to other pop loners. Prince has
a  veritable museum of styles to work with. Madonna and Jacko have the solidity
of  dance and a flair for controversy. 
</P>
<P>Bush only really has a voice (or rather, set of voices) and an attitude. Her
capacity  to make different musics has generally scuppered her in the charts --
witness the  way one of her best songs, 'The Dreaming', died at number 48 in the
singles charts  because it was &quot;odd&quot;. 
</P>
<P>And while the other pop loners, geniuses though some of them are, have 
well-defined and self-created personalities which will do a certain amount of 
donkey work for them -- observe particularly how Morrissey has successfully 
coasted along since the Smiths ended just on two or three good songs and a
strong  public image -- Kate Bush has no such automatic pilot. 
</P>
<P>Bush's idiosyncrasies, marketable though they might well be, are not
exploited,  probably because Kate Bush hasn't thought of doing so. She could
have an album out  every year if she presented herself as a reclusive hippy
Madonna, famous for being a  bit odd and with carefully stage-managed rare
appearances. 
</P>
<P>However, the Kate Bush persona isn't an image. Her &quot;reclusiveness&quot;
seems to be  more of a normal desire for privacy than an ace way of creating
speculation, her  &quot;hippiness&quot; merely a set of musical and aesthetic
values (liking Pink Floyd, wearing  long dresses, going for vaguely mystical
ideas, believing in the value of non-Western  musical and social set-ups and
generally being the sort of person who has never  taken all the Arnold
Schwarzenegger films out of the video shop) which she shares  with a fair amount
of non-pop people. So there she is, at home with the Bushes and  loved one Del,
toiling in the studio and very hard work it must be. 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World', it must be said, bears the signs of its labours
lightly. From  its gliding, dreamy title track to the raw sex (I think) of 'The
Rocket's Tail', [sic]  this LP is as easy to listen to as a pop song. 
</P>
<P>The lyrics range across all topics, from a bizarre tune about having an
accidental  bop with Hitler ('Heads We're Dancing') to a woman and her
relationship with  her computer ('Deeper Understanding'), from the title track's
paraphrasing of the  last page of Ulysses (hope it doesn't spoil the ending for
me and everybody else who  only got as far as page 10), to the slightly more
conventional romantic musings of  'Love And Anger'. 
</P>
<P>Along the way, Kate's Dad turns up to say a few words about Kate abeing
grown  up, and Trio Bulgarka do exploding rocket impressions on the by no means 
ambiguous penis talk (I pretty much reckon) of 'The Rocket's Tail'. The general 
impression, as ever with Kate Bush's lyrics, is of somebody with a fairly
unorthodox  worldview, an unusual interest in the story song, and a flair for
inventive personal  examination. 
</P>
<P>The music is -- at one go! -- seemless and incongruously bizarre. We get the
 latest studio technology, natch, and we get Uillean pipes. We get Bush playing
the  most Lionel Ritchie-type piano and we get her singing like she was a rare
visitor to  any known Earth language. 
</P>
<P>And on the peculiar and very funny tribute to the male member (I'm certain 
about this) 'The Rocket's Tail', Trio Bulgarka's voices, which are very *now*,
are  asked to accompany a clonking great '70s progressive rock solo, which is
ver *not  now thanks*. It works, too, in ways which only the mind of Kate Bush
could possibly  explain, and then only to someone she had known for many years.

</P>
<P>The Trio Bulgarka part very much exemplifies Bush's attitude. It bothers her
 not, as it might bother some, that they are revered for their ethnicity and
their  alleged simple Bulgarian country ways. Were she Paul Simon or Peter
Gabriel, she  might feel obliged to include at least one song called 'Simple
Bulgarian Country  Ways', and she would take immense pains to find a cod Eastern
European setting  for their voices. 
</P>
<P>Instead she plugs in the Fender Wankblaster and lets rip. Everything is
grist to  Kate Bush's mill; she is not referring to anything or anyone in the
way that nearly  all modern music, from SAW to Prince, from The Waterboys to
Public Enemy does,  which is to use styles, samples, and riffs like some kind of
musical sponsorship; she's  using all this stuff as ingredients in a total
genius stew. 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' is a strange and remarkable record which has very little
to  do with anything else musical, a fair bit to do with the real world of sex,
love and  introversion, and everything to do with uniqueness. Kate Bush remains
alone, ahead  and a genius. 
</P>
<P>(9 [out of 10, I guess]) -- David Quantick 
</P>
<P>There's a real bizarre drawing of Kate surrounding by strange images that
goes  with this review.

<P>Date: Fri, 27 Oct 89 15:05:45 EDT <BR> From: Jon Drukman &lt;jsd@GAFFA.MIT.EDU&gt;
<BR> Subject: Collegian review: 10/20/89 
</P>
<P>OK, I know you've all been sitting out there saying &quot;what has that
rotten  Drukman been up to all this time?&quot; Well, I managed to get a weekly
newspaper  column here in our student college rag called the &quot;Collegian&quot;
(although referred to  in rapturous tones by the student body as the Garbegian,
or Collusion, or Contusion,  or whatever strikes their collective fancy.) So, I
announced in my first column to  expect a new Kate thing by Thanksgiving time
(this was when I still doubted CBS'  ability to stick to announced dates). On
Friday September 29 they ran my review of  the single, which is not very
interesting, being mainly a hard sell for the neophytes  (a very hard sell
considering there's only one record store that sold the import  single and it
was 10 miles away...). 
</P>
<P>Last Friday (Oct. 20) they ran my full review, with a pic of the album
cover, and  the photo erroneously credited to Virgin Records (a slip which
almost cost my editor  much embarrassment since he was gonna send a copy of the
review to them!! and he  calls himself a Kate fan! What a bozo... but I
digress...) 
</P>
<P>So, here it is. Excuse the basicness of it, but most people at UMass won't 
understand phrases like &quot;the stirring cadences of the chorus mingle eerily
with the  basic weltschmerz of the violin line.&quot; I don't understand that
either, mainly because  it doesn't mean anything. 
</P>
<P>On with the article... 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH GLIDES INTO THE SENSUAL WORLD 
</P>
<P>By JON DRUKMAN 
</P>
<P>Collegian Correspondent 
</P>
<P>Four years after the landmark Hounds of Love album, Kate Bush smiles on us
all  once again and releases The Sensual World. Bush, a musical genius and the 
inspiration for dozens of articles with insipid puns in the title (&quot;Bush
Fires,&quot; &quot;Bush  Ranger,&quot; &quot;The Bush Of Ghosts,&quot; etc. ad
nauseum) is a painstaking artist, and has  released only six albums in her
11-year career. 
</P>
<P>Despite the fact that she's been around all this time, America has been
loathe to  embrace her bizarre brand of music. Maybe it stems from the fact that
she never  follows the commercial trends and makes songs that please her. Maybe
it stems from  the fact that she has a gale force voice which occasionally gets
so rough that your  eardrums feel like they've been run over a cheese grater. 
</P>
<P>More pity for those who ignore her, because if they were to take a look in, 
they'd find music with originality and imagination. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World should find favor in the states because Kate seems to be 
mellowing out a bit. The cheese grater voice is gone, replaced by a silky smooth
one  that caresses your ears lovingly, and then, when you least expect it, gives
your nose a  playful tweak. Featuring an all-star cast, including ex-Japan
bassist Mick Karn, Pink  Floyd supremo Dave Gilmour, and a batch of Bulgarian
vocalists known as Trio  Bulgarka, The Sensual World is at turns seductive,
playful, mournful, preposterous  and celebratory. 
</P>
<P>Four years of waiting can push expectations high for an album. Couple this
with  the fact that Kate Bush has already released the best album ever in the
history of  music (1982's experimental opus The Dreaming) and you can see that
we were all  set to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>While this album isn't as stunning overall as The Dreaming or Hounds Of
Love,  it's still firmly head and shoulders above the rest. 
</P>
<P>Even on a record as polished as one bearing the word &quot;sensual&quot; in
its title should  be, there are standouts. Our current favorite track is &quot;The
Fog.&quot; IT swirls, broods,  glides and swoops like the water that Bush is
singing about. IT's a melancholy song  about growing up, says Kate, and features
her father providing some snippets of  dialogue. You can feel the water and fog
washing out of the speakers at you. 
</P>
<P>There is one dud here, however. &quot;Reaching Out&quot; is a histrionic,
woefully overdone  ballad. Oddly, Bush's most powerful vocal performance on this
album is drowned in  a sea of syrupy strings and bad Bette Midler cliches. Worse
yet, it's right in the  middle of all the good stuff. When it comes on, our hand
is often seen &quot;reaching out&quot;  for the skip button. 
</P>
<P>We could drone on and on forever about the merits of this album. The
brilliant  computer love song &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; or the intense
bombast of &quot;Rocket's  Tail&quot; (which features Gilmour wailing away in a
stunning series of guitar solos) are  reason enough to get this record. 
</P>
<P>While it isn't as ambitious as Kate's previous albums, it is still an
ultimately  satisfying collection. Just one word of warning: the powers that be
decided to  relegate one of the best tracks, &quot;Walk Straight Down The
Middle,&quot; to the status of  cassette and CD-only bonus track. For this
reason, you should avoid the vinyl unless  you also want to pick up the British
single, which features the bonus track as a  B-side. 
</P>
<P>But, regardless of medium, this album is a winner. Step into Kate Bush's
Sensual  World and find out for yourself. 
</P>
<P>Well, I guess I got carried away with the hyperbole there. I really don't
think it's  as good an album as I said it was in the column. I sort of felt like
I had a duty to  praise it in the column though. Maybe we can get her popular
here despite the  material. 
</P>
<P>bye for now.

<P>Date: Sun, 29 Oct 89 14:05:57 -0600 <BR> From: Michael Mendelson &lt;mendel@cs.uiuc.edu&gt;
<BR> Subject: Daily Illini TSW Review 
</P>
<P>Appearing Oct. 27, 1989 in the Directory section of the University of
Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign, was the following review. The DI Ratings system
is a five star  scale, 5=Classic 1=Poor. TSW got 3 stars. Comments in [square
brackets] are mine. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush drips sexuality. 
</P>
<P>Anyone even somewhat familiar with Kate's music has surely experienced her 
incredible sensual presence. In The Sensual World, the sensuality is still
there, but  it's tainted with a heavy dose of sexuality, making for one hell of
an exciting ride. 
</P>
<P>The title track heats things up almost immediately. Bush teases listeners
with her  sultry cooing and provocative lyrics. The intriguing bagpipe sound,
coupled with her  frequent moanings (&quot;mmmhh yesss&quot;), are sure to stir
the kilts of any red-blooded  Scot. 
</P>
<P>At first listen, the second groove, &quot;Love and Anger,&quot; sounds like
a duet: You'd  swear Cyndi Lauper [?!] was singing. But she's not (I checked the
credits); it's just  Kate. [Quite a relief, ay?] This tune is similar to &quot;The
Big Sky&quot; because there is  almost too much going on---lots of humming, &quot;oh
yeah&quot;s and some amazing  background vocals that will leave your head
spinning. 
</P>
<P>Gulls, crashing waves, various whistles and woodwinds make &quot;The Fog&quot;
a relaxing  orchestral listening experience. About love and fear, it sports one
of the best violin  solos ever recorded in pop music. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Hey, heads we dance!&quot; screams Kate in the lead to &quot;Heads
We're Dancing.&quot;  You'd never guess from the title, but the song concerns
Hitler and his seduction of a  young woman. The forlorn maiden unwittingly falls
for his charm, the later laments:  &quot;They say that the Devil is a charming
man/and just like you I bet he can dance.&quot;  The devil and almost anyone
else can surely dance to this tune; the rhythm is  absorbing. 
</P>
<P>The background vocals of many [? Is 3 many?] of the tracks feature The Trio 
Bulgarka, but none use the threesome to their true potential except &quot;Rocket's
Tail  (For Rocket).&quot; A lyrical poem of sorts, Kate sings a cappella until
midsong. Then  drums and guitar kick in, and the Trio's chanting escalates to a
frenzy. Although  the hyperactive chanting almost drowns the last verse's
vocals, the song still works.  [Phew!] 
</P>
<P>&quot;This Woman's Work,&quot; the 10th track, is certainly the best song on
the album.  [Hmmm, never considered this as a candidate for best song because it
had already  been around. Maybe, maybe...] Kate's keyboards sparkle, and Michael
Kamen's  orchestral arrangement is brilliant. Faced with the impending death of
a loved one,  the vocals overflow with emotion as she croons: &quot;I know you
have a little life yet/I  know you have a lot of strength left.&quot; Her
sadness so overwhelms, it may even spark  a tear or two. 
</P>
<P>Not all the songs are wonderful; two are moderate at best. &quot;Reaching
Out&quot;  delivers Freudian mother connotations, and in &quot;Deeper
Understanding,&quot; Kate is in  love with a personal computer. [Really?] Both
are somewhat lame [RO maybe, but I  heartily disagree about DU, which to me is
among the three best songs on the  album] but are spread apart in the album,
having little effect on the overall work. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is a treat to hear. [Yay!] Give the disc a spin and see if
you  agree. Then listen to it again, this time on headphones. WOW! 
</P>
<P>Rich Carlson 
</P>
<P>Overall, a positive review, although a little naive and childish. But that's
par for  the course, or actually, better that par around here. Reporting from
the Feeding  Trough of America, this is Mike Mendelson signing off.

</P>
<P>I have never posted to this group before, because I do not qualify as a real
 love-hound: I like 'The kick inside' a lot, and that's about it. However, I do
follow  the group, mostly because you people are so funny :-) 
</P>
<P>Anyway, with everybody posting magazine reviews and articles about Kate's
new  album, I thought that at least for completeness' sake, it might be
interesting to let  you know what Holland's leading music magazine 'Oor' has to
say about it. 'Oor'  means 'Ear', and qua contents it is like the Dutch Rolling
Stone, and heavily biased  towards the more 'alternative' circuit, which over
here does not really include Kate.  There are two items: the first is Oor's
luke-warm review of 'The Sensual World',  the second is an accusation that I
think might be of interest to all the Love-Hounds.  The translation is mine, and
I apologize for any errors: translating to English turns  out to be even more
difficult than just writing in English. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH - THE SENSUAL WORLD 
</P>
<P>by Bert van de Kamp [A respected Dutch rock journalist] 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush made her debut in 1978 with the single 'Wuthering Heights', after
the  book of the same name by Emily Bronte, and I can remember thinking: this
girl is  brilliant. After that she made five albums, which suffered increasingly
from an  excess of production. No expenses were spared, but that was not always
necessary  for me. Kate composes beautiful melodies, and on top of that writes
highly intriguing  lyrics for them, but she feels she has to manifest herself as
a studio-tigress as well. 
</P>
<P>After her last album 'Hounds of Love' ('85) I wrote: &quot;I would like to
take away  all her toys and listen to her alone with her piano.&quot;. For now
that is not going to be. 
</P>
<P>La Bush has worked four years at 'The Sensual World' and again takes all the
 production-credits herself, so the stereosound is once again chock full of
sounds and  effects, everything wall-to-wall and richly draped. It all sounds
very spectacular, but  where is Kate? The stars of this record are the Trio
Bulgarka en bagpipe-vituoso  Davey Spillane. 
</P>
<P>The title song, also out on single is very beautiful. Kate has dared to put
to music  a part of the soliloquy of Molly Bloom, with which James Joyce ended
his  masterpiece 'Ullyses', and she asked Spillane to create fitting Irish
sounds to go  with it, all with the aforementioned result. 
</P>
<P>But then I hear her singing in 'Deeper Understanding' about how well she 
communicates with her home-computer, and the Trio Bulgarka, which has probably 
never seen a computer, sing beautifully along with it and I think: this is all
wrong.  The artistic unity is missing, this is take-away work, kindergarten
stuff. I'd rather  put on a record of the Bulgarian trio themselves. 
</P>
<P>Textually Kate again turns everything upside-down, too much to mention here.
 Central in any case is the theme of woman-hood. Beside Molly's soliloquy in the
 title-song, we can also mention songs as 'Between a Man and a Woman' and 'This 
Woman's Work'. Again she gives us a few enchanting melodies. 'Never be mine' 
for instance, where Spillane, the Bulgarka's and Kate herself sound *very* good 
together: &quot;Ooh the thrill and the hurting...&quot; 'The Fog' is also great
(orchestra:  Michael Kamen, Celtic harp: Alan Stivell). That makes three direct
hits. Am I  allowed to have my reservations as to the rest? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Life in the ghost of Bush. Ooh, it's a sensual world, baby.&quot; 
</P>
<P>[This appeared in 'Oor' Nr. 20, 7 october 1989] 
</P>
<P>[Now for the second, more interesting piece, which appeared two weeks later
in  'Oor' Nr. 21, 21 october 1989:] 
</P>
<P>BUSH FRAUD ? [In Dutch: 'Bush Bedrog?', a nice alliteration] 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' is the name of the new single by Kate Bush. Although, 
'new'? I have known the melody which her accompanist Davy Spillane plays in this
 song on bagpipes for years. 
</P>
<P>In the fall of 1985 I was going to interview Kate Bush in England. Because
she  then already had shown her love for (Irish) folk music, I had brought a
cassette of  my folk favourites. The interview first was cancelled, but after a
few days La Bush  called me after all at home (collect). The interview was never
published (too thin),  but I did send her the tape afterwards. On that tape was
the from Yugoslavian  Macedonia originating 'Antice, dzanam, Dusice', performed
by the Haagse [i.e.  from The Hague] ensemble Calgija, conducted by
etnomusicologist Wouter Swets.  Originally a song about a poor girl who had to
take care of her younger sister, and  therefore couldn't get a husband; in
Swets' (instrumental) version almost as  beautiful as 'Mother Nature's Song' by
the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>According to the booklet of the LP and CD 'The Sensual World' the title song
 was written by La Bush herself: not true. Was this traditional melody suggested
to  her by the Trio Bulgarka, guests on the album, or did my cassette reach her
home  address in Kent, after all? 
</P>
<P>[by Jan Libbenga] 
</P>
<P>Again my apologies for the clunky tranlations. Oh, and by the way: I *like*
the  Sensual World, whether Kate wrote it or not... 
</P>
<P>Fading back into silent monitorhood,

</P>
<P> The Gavin Report is a trade magazine for the radio industry. Thus, it only 
includes airplay charts, not sales charts. They missed a week because of the 
earthquake (it's published in San Francisco), but the new issue just came out. 
There's lots of Kate in it. 
</P>
<P>First of all, &quot;Love And Anger&quot;, which entered the Album Tracks
chart at #50 in  the last issue, has now moved up to #32. The same song debuts
on the Alternative  Tracks chart at #28. 
</P>
<P>There's a column called &quot;Biofeedback&quot; in which tidbits of
information about hot  artists are printed. It says: 
</P>
<P>&quot;When Kate was sixteen she already had a four octave vocal range. Her
first  demo tape, made while still a teenager, was sponsored by Pink Floyd's
David  Gilmour.&quot; 
</P>
<P>There's a full page ad for the album -- almost identical to the one in
Billboard. 
</P>
<P>Best of all, there's a nice review of the album: 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD -- KATE BUSH (COLUMBIA) 
</P>
<P>The first lady of progressive musical thought returns after her longest
absence.  Kate Bush's Sensual World is divided into three basic ethnic camps.
The first is her  usual extraordinary blend of eccentric electronics; the second
is the Irish sessions cut  in Dublin; the third is the utilization of the Trio
Bulgarka, who record ethnic  Bulgarian folk on Joe Boyd's respected Hannibal
label. Some familiar ground is  rediscovered, i.e. a trip back to childhood in
relation to complex adulthood on &quot;The  Fog.&quot; But new fantasies are
concocted. &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot; is a dreamlike trip  back to 1939
Germany at a party with young Adolf Hitler (where does this woman  get her
inspiration?). 
</P>
<P>Most fascinating is &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot; a techno think piece
on the home  computer being the next logical step after over-the-phone sex. The
collisions  between man and woman are explored on the title track, &quot;Between
A Man And A  Woman&quot; and &quot;This Woman's Work.&quot; Guest cameos include
guitarist David Gilmour,  bassist Eberhard Weber, bassist Mick Karn and members
of the Bush clan on  various levels of creative support. In keeping with her
usual high standards, The  Sensual World is first rate whether it's modern high
tech record making or James  Joycean roots. Plus there's plenty of mystique
between the lines, something sorely  missing from much of the recent releases. 
</P>
<P>Later, this reviewer gives a quite favorable review of Laurie Anderson's new
 album, Strange Angels. At the end of this, he says, &quot;Alongside Kate Bush,
this has  been a phenomenal week for digital women.&quot;

<P>From: hound!gab@att.att.com <BR> Date: Wed, 1 Nov 89 09:08 EST <BR>
Subject: Review New York Times 
</P>
<P>What follows is a review of TSW from &quot;our country's paper of record&quot;
-The  New York Times. It was written by Stephen Holden and appears in the &gt;&gt;Pop
Life&lt;&lt;  column in today's edition. 
</P>
<P>Molly Bloom's Reverie 
</P>
<P>When the English singer and songwriter Kate Bush asked the James Joyce
estate  several months ago for permission to set a portion of Molly Bloom's
erotic reverie  from &quot;Ulysses&quot; to music, she was devastated when the
answer was no. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I had been fascinated at how well the words fit to music,&quot; she
recalled the other  day in a telephone conversation from London. &quot;I found
myself in a situation where I  would either have to shelf the song or rework it
trying to keep the original sense. I  gradually rewrote it, keeping the same
rhythm of the words and the same sounds  but turning it into its own story,
which became the idea of Molly Bloom stepping out  of the song into the beauty
of nature.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The completed piece became the title cut of Miss Bush's sixth album, &quot;The
 Sensual World&quot; (Columbia). The song, she said, uses the chord sequences of
a  traditional Macedonian tune and an arrangement dominated by uilleann pipes,
an  Irish bagpipe, along with a bouzouki and fiddle. The richness of the
language and  exotic instrumental textures that sound Indian-flavored, blend
gorgeously and make  &quot;The Sensual World&quot; one of the year's headiest
records. 
</P>
<P>It was 11 and one-half years ago that Miss Bush, who was then 19, had her
first hit  with &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; a song with lyrics inspired by
Emily Bronte's novel. The  song soared to No. 1 on the English charts. But
America has been slow to warm to a  singer whose high vibratoless voice and
enrapted lyrics suggest a romantic English  schoolgirl romping through the
Jungian landscape of her own dreams. 
</P>
<P>Finally, in 1985, her song &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; became a
middle-size American  hit. The next year, &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; a duet with
Peter Gabriel on his album &quot;So,&quot;  enlarged her audience. With &quot;The
Sensual World,&quot; which this week entered  Billboard's pop-ablum chart at No.
84, Miss Bush's movement in this country may  have arrived. 
</P>
<P>One reason Americans may be resisting Miss Bush is that she has never 
performed here in concert. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've always preferred to make albums, to be a songwriter and to work
in the  studio,&quot; she said. &quot;We did one tour 10 years ago in England
and and in Europe, and I  enjoyed it. But there was no call to go to America at
that point.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Musically, Miss Bush said, she was influenced by Roxy Music, by the Beatles'
 &quot;Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery
Tour&quot; and by  Pink Floyd, whose guitarist Dave Gilmour paid for the tapes
that led to her first  recording contract. 
</P>
<P>But more than other pop musicians or authors, Miss Bush said movies have 
inspired her. Among film makers, she said she most admires Alfred Hitchcock, 
Nicolas Roeg and Terry Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Their work has spoken to me as directly as that of any other kind of
artist,: she  said. &quot;Many of my songs I think of as very filmic.&quot;

<P>TALES OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>by Karen E. Clements 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's sixth studio album, The Sensual World, explores the
psychological  facets of love amongst grand orchestral musical arrangements.
Although not a typical  pop album, The Sensual World contains little of the
avant-garde musical and vocal  experi-mentation that marks her earlier albums.
Could Bush be attempting to appeal  to the mainstream and &quot;sell out?&quot;
[punctuation sic] 
</P>
<P>Fortunately, this solid album contains many songs equal in emotion and 
arrangement to such earlier popular masterpieces as &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
and &quot;Running  Up That Hill.&quot; The album presents two facets of Bush --
the storyteller and the  romantic. 
</P>
<P>As a storyteller, Bush weaves thought-provoking tales amidst theatrical
musical  arrangements. Set in 1939, &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot; tells how a
dashing young man  sweeps a young woman off her feet in a night of dancing. She
opens the morning  paper only to discover the horrible identity of the young
man: &quot;They say that the  Devil is a charming man/and just like you I bet he
can dance.&quot; The quirky, funky  beat builds as one's curiosity mounts and
the identity is finally revealed: Hitler.  [Gee, thanks for relieving the
suspense.] 
</P>
<P>On a slightly lighter note, &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; follows. In
desperation a  lonely woman turns to her computer for companionship. Bush
illustrates the bizarre  paradox that a human, unable to find any understanding,
turns to a computer, which  has been stereotyped as the epitome of
impersonality. Musically the Trio Bulgarka,  female Indian [!] backup singers,
bring an ethereal atmosphere to the song. 
</P>
<P>Thematically, the album showcases Bush's knack for exposing the facets of 
relationships. The title track oozes sensuality. Complimented [sic] by exotic,
erotic  Uillean pipes, her glorious voice caresses every word. Teasing, humorous
lyrics keep  the song right on the edge of being steamy: &quot;I said, mmh,
yes/But not yet, mmh,  yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love and Anger&quot; deals with self-acceptance and coming to terms
with the past.  The rhythm of this uplifting song pulses with drums and bass
while Kate and Paddy  Bush's vocals rise in a crescendo of joy. 
</P>
<P>Bush also delves into the darker side of relationships. &quot;The Fog&quot;
opens with an  eerie Joker-like cackle. Bush compares falling in love with the
frightening  experience of learning to swim: &quot;This love of yours/Was big
enough to be frightened  of/It's deep like the water was/The day I learned to
swim.&quot; [misquote sic] A  recorded male voice interjects with swimming
directions, further augmenting the  song's unsettling quality. And on &quot;Never
Be Mine&quot; Bush expresses the terrible pain  of rejection with haunting
vocals and the bittersweet sounds of Uillean pipes. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World does contain some weak tracks. The rhythm of &quot;Reaching
 Out&quot; drags and pulls the repetitive lyrics with it. &quot;Rocket's Tail
(For Rocket)&quot; tells  an interesting story, but the abrasive electric guitar
and drums prove distracting.  Lastly, Bush's unusually nasal vocals make &quot;Walk
Straight Down the Middle&quot; a little  annoying. 
</P>
<P>While not as conceptual or daring as her earlier albums, The Sensual World 
presents an extremely talented and versatile artist. And as always, her
marvelous  voice ranges from a tentative lilt to resounding growls. For those
new to Bush, this  album introduces her as a wonderful storyteller and vocalist
in traditionally  structured songs. Longtime, more die-hard fans will not be
disappointed, as the  album contains many strong tracks and astute observations.

</P>
<P>Hi Love Hounds, 
</P>
<P>The following review of TSW appeared in the Kitchener-Waterloo Record's 
weekly Entertainment Guide. It is by Neil Randall, who is an English professor
at  the University Of Waterloo. He may also be known to some of you as the
co-author  (with Roger Zelazny) of &quot;A Guide to Castle Amber&quot;. A
picture of Kate with the  caption &quot;Kate Bush continues to dominate her
musical genre&quot; accompanies the  review. 
</P>
<P>Although it's not mentioned in the review, it might interest you to know
that the  first Canadian single from TSW is &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's World a Sensual sensation 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush (Capitol) 
</P>
<P>If any one artist has consistently embodied excellence throughtout the
1980s, that  person is Kate Bush. It's hard to believe that Bush's debut album,
The Kick Inside,  was released a full dozen years ago, and it's even harder to
believe that she's  released only five albums since. Her music has dominated her
particular genre -  whether you call it avant-folk or neo-artiste - so much that
her albums seem to have  appeared in rapid succession. 
</P>
<P>But they haven't. A case in point is the amount of time between The Hounds
of  Love, her last album, and The Sensual World, her brand new one. Hounds of
Love  was released more than three years ago, yet the influence of that
ground-breaking  album makes it seem completely contemporary. Bush's videos have
influenced many  artists, and her lush, dense, utterly absorbing writing and
performing have done at  least as much. Witness, for instance, Jane Siberry. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is everthing its title implies. Yes, it's sensual, and,
yes, it's  about the world. More importantly, though, as Bush insists in the
advance publicity,  The Sensual World is just as distinctively female. 
</P>
<P>Capturing the essence of female-ness has occupied poets and fiction writers 
(particularly women) for a large part of this century, expecially during the
last two  decades. Popular music, however, has remained almost exclusively male.
Women  have shone, certainly, but nearly always within a setting established by
male artists.  Understanding what it means to be female has never been much of a
concern in  rock, because rock is still considered a boy's game. Witness the
Rolling Stones,  idolized because they refuse to leave adolescent malehood
behind. 
</P>
<P>Back to The Sensual World. The title track, Love and Anger, Deeper 
Understanding, This Woman's Work, and Walk Straight Down the Middle combine  to
represent Bush's strong, gripping attempt to come to terms with creating a 
woman's art. The music is beautiful - it ranges from the lilting to the dense
and  powerful - and the lyrics are contagious. This is music by a woman who is
trying to  convey to the world - not just to other women - what it means to be a
woman. 
</P>
<P>In other words, it's nothing short of indispensable.

<P>From: bloch%mandrill@ucsd.edu (Steve Bloch) <BR> Date: 7 Nov 89 07:48:52
GMT <BR> Subject: TSW review UCSD Guardian 
</P>
<P>The following is a review in UCSD's mainstream student newspaper (as opposed
 to the left-wing student newspaper, the right-wing student newspaper, the humor
 student newspaper, the student-activities news-paper, the Jewish student
newspaper,  the Chicano student newspaper, and several different &quot;college&quot;
newspapers), the  UCSD Guardian. Review by Mike Newton: 
</P>
<P> I was seduced. The first song on the new Kate Bush album, The Sensual
World,  sent me reeling as I entered the siren-haunted landscape inhabited by
her sultry  voice, enchanting music and evocative lyrics. 
</P>
<P>As the title suggests, the album is about feelings, mostly dark ones. Unlike
her  last work, The Hounds of Love [sic], a beautiful but somewhat abstract
conceptual  piece, Bush speaks personally and directly to us. Almost every song
on the album  deals with relationships, whether it's between lovers, parents and
children, or people  and technology. 
</P>
<P>Many of the songs have a tone suggesting that Bush is still feeling the
pangs of a  recent break-up: &quot;It lay buried here, it lay deep inside me /
It's so deep I don't  think that I can / Speak about it... Take away the love
and anger / And a little piece  of hope holding us together.&quot; [sic] These
potent emotions made her music all the  more personal and powerful. 
</P>
<P>There are a few noteworthy guest appearances on the album. David Gilmour, 
guitarist for Pink Floyd and the musician credited for having &quot;discovered&quot;
Bush,  brings his searing, soaring electrified strings to two of the songs. Alan
Stivell,  world-renowned heir of the authentic Celtic harp and barding
tradition, lends his  ancient instrument on two songs. [Would you believe he
doesn't mention Trio  Bulgarka?] 
</P>
<P>I can't think of any radio station that accurately represents the style of
music on  this album. It's not dance music, hard rock, New Age or anything
easily classifiable.  It's dominated by Bush's cooing-screaming singing, her
piano and Fairlight  accompaniment, and Stuart Elliot's drums. It shows
occasional Celtic influences, but  is thoroughly modern. 
</P>
<P>Bush has a very unusual and distinctive style. If you don't like her
already, this  album is not likely to make you a convert. If you do already like
her, or have  leanings in the art-rock, Peter Gabriel, Laurie Anderson
direction, you'll probably  want to acquire her latest undertaking. 
</P>
<P>Did I like this album? Mmmm, yes.
