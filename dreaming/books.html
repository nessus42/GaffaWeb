<h2>Subject: Break-Through and Fred Vermorel Bios 
</h2>


<p>&gt; I'd appreciate any thoughts on &quot;Breakthrough&quot; from y'all (this magazine may 
already have been discussed here, along, I'm sure, with the reprehensible Fred 
Vermorel bio, but remember, I've only been here for a few weeks...) 
</p>


<p>There hasn't been much discussion of any of this. I have just mentioned both. 
There are two Fred Vermorel bios, which are very different. There is &quot;Kate Bush: 
Princess of Suburbia&quot; and &quot;The Secret History of Kate Bush&quot;. The first one is a 
parody of a National Enquirer style expose. It's complete with &quot;proof&quot; that Kate 
Bush was trying to control people's minds with Gurdjieffian hypnotism methods and 
ritual dancing and movement. Vermorel seems to like Kate well-enough in this bio 
(though I guess he seems to think she's a somewhat amusing figure or something, 
and he has many nasty things to say about her family and friends), so I have no idea 
why he chose Kate as the subject of a parody on scandal sheets. I can't find 
&quot;Princess of Suburbia&quot; too reprehensible, though most KB fans seem to think it is, 
because it can't possibly be taken seriously -- it's more funny than anything else. 
I'm told that Kate was quite hurt by it, though. 
</p>
<p>After &quot;The Dreaming&quot; came out, Vermorel seemed to totally change his mind 
about Kate. He decided that &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is the greatest work of art ever, and 
wrote &quot;The Secret History of Kate Bush&quot;. This one, instead of being a biography, is a 
hundred page long love-letter to Kate. Which makes it kind of ridiculous. I'm not 
sure where Fred is coming from on this one. Maybe it's not supposed to be taken 
seriously -- maybe it's supposed to be a parody of a hundred page long love-letter to 
Kate.... But he sure seems serious. 
</p>


<h2>This is chapter I: 
</h2>
<p>We recognized her as we always do stars. A face &quot;clicks&quot;, happens, transfigures 
anonymity. As the eye jumps to a pretty face in a croud, the word &quot;sex&quot; on a page. 
So decisively it seems a star is *born*, But not out of labour. Rather as a flying 
saucer crash-landed on earth. Gleaming mysterious and seamless in its crater. 
Surrounded by excited cameramen and fenced off by stern authority. A worldwide 
object of speculation: Gee! Is there anyone -- anything -- inside? And is it friendly? 
</p>
<p>So she burst through the telly in early '78. All wrists and lisp and dimples, all 
sweet and clever, all arms like water flowing over stones, as clean and delicious as a 
scoop of avocado pear. The suburbs breathed again. Fresh air after punk's foul blast. 
And very soon very famous. A hit, a gold, a number one. Introduced to gentry. An 
institution. Snap, crackle and pop. A campaign of champagne. Prizes, encore!, and: 
who the hell does she think she is? &quot;The most photographed woman in Britain.&quot; 
</p>
<h2>Then she disappeared. 
</h2>
<p>And destroyed her talent. For two years worked to wreck her facility and build 
something more interesting in the ruins. As every artist has to. And has taken pop 
production its furthest yet. As frank as Cliff, as crisp as the Floyd, and as potent as 
the Pistols. And her work's now as sharp and inspired as David Hockney's (which it 
resembles). Only more important. For Hockney's art is defunct: fine art painting. 
But hers is the only art which really counts today. Not pop art, but the art of pop. 
</p>
<p>A strange, could be dangerous art. Crazy Kate, pop witch. She exorcises our 
madness. Lives and projects myths she can't always control. Or understand. 
</p>
<p>Also an unusual person with unusual reflexes -- a welcome antidote to most of 
us. How did she come about? I followed the fragile chances and distillation which 
produced her and her art and realized how nearly she never made it -- for which 
we'd be the poorer. And also followed her appearance through her folklore: Kate 
sphinx, Kate harlequin, Kate harlot... A history of our expectations and recognition. 
</p>


<h2>&quot;Fear cautions me, 'Remain a stranger,' 
</h2>
<h2>Yet longing urges, 'Do not wait.' 
</h2>
<h2>Her eyes spell secrecy and danger, 
</h2>
<h2>Yet they are my dark stars of fate.&quot; 
</h2>
<h2>(Heine, &quot;Katherine&quot;) 
</h2>


<h2>This is from page 61: 
</h2>
<p>I remember that first EMI poster which loomed from buses and tube stations to 
katenap my eye in '78. Grave, delicious Kate, plump owl in her tangled nest of 
puzzled hair with nipples blowing tiny kisses through a cotton vest. Kate and I 
joined in instant photolock. Kate Bush, bushy Kate laid out for me by the EMI 
artroom boys with a gourmet's delight like a table for guests. A strawberry tea 
spread, with eyes like doughnuts full of jam, and butter lips and full cream cheeks 
spread with a blunt knife by the vicar's wife... 
</p>
<p>So I turn Kate's glossy pages, crackling and soapy to the touch, paper which 
seems limp and heavy and wet with *realism*, as if her image were oozing and 
perspiring into my fascinated inspection. Where she opens herself ultra-bright and 
ultra-sharp with what seems like almost effusive precision. A kind of alacrity. An 
implacably sunny and heartlessly optimistic photoworld where I can dwell for ever 
and ever with no problem or effort, and no hope of change or decay, over her 
lambent skin and sticky promise of her tropical lips. 
</p>


<p>Kate Bush is our godess Frig. And like the Saxons we both revere *and* fear her. 
Shroud her in the mystery of her power and the power of her mystery. 
</p>
<h2>A fertility goddess for our Nature: the Economy. Mother Commodity. 
</h2>
<p>Kate Bush is the smile on the steel of EMI, the mating call of Thorn Industries, 
British capital on heat, the soft warm voice of mass media, the sweet breath of vinyl, 
the lovely face of bureaucracy, the seductive gaze of power. As every star is. 
</p>
<p>And she also incarnates pure adventure, total freedom: the ad made flesh, 
Fabulously rich, we rumor: an idol in our world-wide superstitious cult of celebrity, 
which is the only religion we all truly believe in now -- even a pope has to be a 
celebrity before we take him seriously. The negative image of ourselves. Of our 
anonymity and powerlessness. Which her images dramatise and expiate. Kate 
Catharsis. 
</p>
<p>No wonder EMI takes such care to show her with the same scrupulous art as 
Moscow depicts Karl Marx and Thorn industry its computers. Through hybrid 
images which hover just between photography and painting -- pictures which exist 
just beyond the camera's conventional vision but retain a ghostly residue of 
authority. The art of airbrush and stencil, soft pencil and rubber. The visual style 
proper to charismatic icons: celebrities are shown with its anonymous clarity, with 
the hard lustre of machinery and apothesis. They appear to *shine*, by virtue of 
apparently effortless and bland tonal transitions, sharp black and white highlights, 
and meticulously separated edges -- detail given with hypnotic brilliance which 
displays people as if they had suddenly loomed, ready-made and perfect, like smooth 
obelisks from a fog into which they might also disappear -- monumental and 
intangible. 
</p>
<p>But I like her so much because she spoils it for them. She has Monroe's flawed 
and flagrant presence. No wet-shine, deep-frozen cover girl. No Beauty. Not Debbie 
Harry's vacuous nonentity -- no blank screen for wet consumer dreams. But a 
woman who besides posing looks like she might menstruate, or sign checks -- or 
punch my nose. A self-contained exuberance which cheerfully stains the most 
pompous male tableau with female energy and wit. 
</p>
<p>And her favorite photolook is the gaze openly returned to a friend. Intimate, but 
not for sale. 
</p>


<h2>He ends the book with: 
</h2>
<h2>Kate Bush: 
</h2>
<h2>&quot;I think everyone is emotional and I think a lot of people are afraid of being so. 
</h2>


<h2>Gee... Could that be used as the theme for an album side? 
</h2>


<p>They feel that it's vulnerable. Myself I feel it's the key to everything and that 
the more you can find out about your emotions the better&quot; 
</p>
<p>Unusually sensuous, unusually generous. She wants to make us happy. Give us 
everything she has all at once. Superbly courageous, on a hire wire over ridicule, 
disdainful of her own safety, always ready to risk her talent and herself. She opens 
her heart with her mouth and throws herself at us with frightened urgency and that 
half anxious curl of her upper lip -- as if fearful of finding nothing on our side. And 
we would be most ungracious if she didn't. If we didn't respond to her warmth and 
vulnerability with some vulnerability ourselves. 
</p>

<h2>Subject: Kate Bush Complete 
</h2>


<p>Kate Bush Complete is the title of a new and long-promised book that has finally 
been published by EMI/IMP Books. It is a collection of &quot;all&quot; of Kate's songs 
published to date. It includes the lyrics to sixty-six of her songs, followed by the 
sheet-music for all sixty-six. There are also about fifty or so smallish 
black-and-white photographs, a few of which have never been published anywhere 
before, although all are from familiar photo sessions. There is also an introduction by 
Peter Fitzgerald-Morris, the chief editor of Homeground -- &quot;The International Kate 
Bush Fanzine&quot;. 
</p>
<p>And it's clear that Kate and her family were consulted at least to some extent on 
the plans for the book. Finally, there are a discography (U.K. releases only), a 
videography and -- most valuable of all, I think, although filled with gaps -- a 
month-by-month chronology of Kate's career. The quality of the paper and printing 
of this eight-by-ten paperback book are excellent, and IED's initial reaction overall 
is quite positive. 
</p>
<p>There are, of course, some errors of fact and one or two unfortunate omissions 
(two songs are missing, &quot;Be Kind to My Mistakes&quot; and the early, unreleased song 
&quot;Maybe&quot;), but to its credit the book is very carefully edited (both French lyrics, for 
example, are letter-perfect -- a real rarity in pop books!), and it even solves a few 
&quot;mysteries&quot;.

<h2> Mike Pritchard, you ask: 
</h2>
<p>&gt; Finally got a copy of &quot;Kate Bush Complete&quot;. Who writes out the scores? I recall 
Kate saying that she rarely writes out her songs, but plays it by ear. So are these the 
product of someone listening to them over and over and over...? 
</p>


<p>Well, no, strictly speaking. As far as IED can tell, they are the product of some 
nameless EMI drone listening to them once and only once, with one one ear, while 
soaking up quarts of cheap ale and watching that week's Watford match on the 
telly. Kate obviously has nothing to do with any of the musical transcriptions of her 
recordings. She can handle notation, and has written out some parts herself for 
session musicians to read from, but it takes her a long time and much trouble, so 
whenever possible, she avoids the process. The guitar part for John Williams in &quot;The 
Morning Fog&quot; is an example of a part that Kate wrote out note for note.

<h2>Subject: The Whole Story 
</h2>


<p> Late reports have surfaced of the release of TWO -- count 'em --new books 
about Kate Bush. Added to the music books published thus far, these constitute the 
eleventh and twelfth Kate Bush-related books to date (not counting The Garden, a 
publication of the possibly imaginary Wickham Street Irregular Press). 
</p>
<p>Even as the Love-Hounds read this, one book, a trade-size paperback 
&quot;scrapbook&quot; made up of clippings and photographs of Kate, has already started to 
turn up in import shops. It has been offered in Los Angeles stores for $20.00 
</p>
<p>Another book, entitled The Whole Story, should show up very soon. This one is 
described as a hardback &quot;official biography&quot; of Kate, and will be priced somewhere 
around $30.00 (!). It is supposed to be a very up-market production. 
</p>
<p>Earlier, Peter FitzGerald-Morris announced plans to publish a re-edited collection 
of his long Homeground series &quot;Five Years Ago&quot; in book form. IED speculates that 
The Whole Story may in fact be that book. The description of the hardcover book as 
an &quot;official biography&quot; might very well fit the Fitzgerald-Morris project, since he has 
already acted as Kate's fact-finder in a more or less official capacity for the Kate 
Bush Complete book. 
</p>
<p>Rest assured that IED will provide Love-Hounds with a thorough description of 
both new books just as soon as he can get his hands on copies. Meanwhile, if anyone 
else out there has any information, please share it!

<h2>Subject: KATE BUSH WITH LOVE 
</h2>


<p>First, an apology for the prolixity of IED's prose in this posting, which is even 
more tiresome than usual. He spent the day in Victorian studies, and some of that 
era's style seems to have rubbed off on him, with unpleasant results. 
</p>


<h2>KT News: 
</h2>
<p>A copy of the first of two new books about Kate Bush has come into IED's 
hands, and it's a surprisingly worthwhile document. Its outward appearance is not 
auspicious of interior value. It's a glossy white paperback book, about 8x12&quot; inches in 
dimension, featuring a black and white HoL -era publicity shot on the front, and the 
title &quot;KATE BUSH WITH LOVE&quot; in large pink letters. On the back cover is a 
distressingly silly love missile to Kate and her fans, which vows the compilers' utter 
devotion to Katedom in emotional but illiterate language, the tone and message of 
which are entirely offset by the writers' reference to &quot; Cloudbursting &quot;. (In IED's 
view, no true Kate Bush fan would ever commit that particular misspelling, but just 
about any money-grubbing bootleg scum would.) 
</p>
<p>The compilers, incidentally -- and the publishers, printers etc. -- are unidentified. 
In fact, there is no catalogue number, no price tag, no date or place of publication, 
no anything that might set a litigiously minded person on the path of the 
perpetrators of this illegal product. For illegal it certainly must be, consisting as it 
does exclusively of photo-reproductions of dozens of interviews, reviews and 
advertisements of/for Kate's work, dating from ca. 1978 to about 1986. In most cases 
the titles of the original publications have been excised from the facsimiles, although 
some of the IDs slipped by. It's obvious from this furtively anonymous presentation 
that no permissions were sought to reproduce any of the clippings included in the 
new book. 
</p>
<p>The layout is relatively professional throughout, although a few of the photos have 
been marred by the superimposition of smaller clippings over their surface. The 
efforts of the editors have not extended beyond the performance of these relatively 
simple organizational tasks -- no commentary of any kind accompanies the clippings. 
This is unfortunate, since by their unedited, unannotated reproduction all the errors 
of fact which appeared in the original articles are preserved now in more permanent 
form, thus greatly increasing the likelihood of confusion among novice Kate 
Bushologists. 
</p>
<p>Despite these faults, however, Kate Bush With Love must be counted a very 
valuable book. In it are included all three of Harry Doherty's important pieces from 
1978, the Ted Mico interview, the second Kris Needs ZigZag interview and more 
than twenty more articles of nearly equal interest and importance. There are of 
course notable omissions, including Peter Swales's indispensible Musician interview 
and the Tony Myatt Capital Radio interview, both from 1985. 
</p>
<p>Still, any fan who is just discovering Kate in the late 1980s will be sure to 
appreciate having a healthy sampling of print interviews from the earlier part of 
Kate's career, now that the originals have become relatively elusive. Considering the 
collection as a whole, and in the context of presently available Kate Bushological 
scholarly materials, IED can recommend this slim but informative volume as a 
worthwhile purchase (approximate U.S. price: $12.00).

</h2>


<h2>from the latest (32nd) issue of &quot;Homeground&quot;: 
</h2>
<p>A new book about Kate (newer than the &quot;scrapbook&quot; called &quot;Kate Bush With 
Love&quot;, which IED reported on in detail earlier), is due in &quot;late autumn&quot; in the UK. 
It's to be called &quot;Kate Bush--A Visual Documentary&quot;, and &quot;HG&quot; say: &quot;Although we 
have not yet seen a copy of the book we do know that the authors have put in much 
time and effort to make it as positive and accurate as possible.&quot; This sounds to IED as 
though it's going to be something of a whitewash, a bit like Peter F-M's own 
chronology. Why should it be made as &quot;positive&quot; as possible? And how can one make 
it &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot; at the same time? The two desires are mutually exclusive. 
To slant the facts in favour of some misconceived notion of the artist's reputation is 
not the way to assure accuracy. (Yeah, yeah, IED's one to talk!) Ah, well, we'll have 
to wait and see what it's like when it arrives. 
</p>
<p>IED doesn't know for sure, but it seems that this book is the same one which he 
earlier reported as being called &quot;Kate Bush--The Whole Story&quot;, a title which was 
given to import record retailers. This confusion will soon be resolved, however. 
</p>
<p>The report in &quot;HG&quot; once again makes vague allusions to some inside source, 
possibly the Bush family themselves; and as usual, the source's anonymity is 
scrupulously maintained. IED is frankly a little annoyed by these veiled references to 
unnamed sources. &quot;HG&quot; continues to insist (on its back page) that it is run 
&quot;completely independently of any official fan organisation,&quot; yet they also continue to 
report news which time and again proves that they are privy to information which 
could only have come from an &quot;official&quot; source, and probably the Bush family itself. 
If the sources are not secret, why are they never identified? If they are, why can't 
they at least admit that they are? And above all, why can't they have the candor to 
admit when they're holding something back about their information and/or 
sources?

<h2>Subject: KATE BUSH: A Visual Documentary 
</h2>


<p>I presume the recent profusion (is two a profusion? it is in this context!) of Kate 
biographies is due to the publishers trying to coincide with the release of KBVI - 
they should have known better! 
</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I was innocently browsing through my local bookshop (looking 
for a T.Rex bio, incidentally - are there any in print?), when I was assaulted by 
&quot;KATE BUSH: A Visual Documentary&quot; by Kevin Cann &amp; Sean Mayes (a couple of 
thoroughly disreputable-looking musos, judging by their pics on the back cover - I 
liked them immediately!). Seeing as it was a paperback, I bought it there and then, 
even though it was 8 pounds 95 (logic? who said anything about logic!). 
</p>
<p>It's large format (9&quot; x 11.5&quot;), about 100 pages, and slightly more text than photos. 
Many of the photos are colour, full page. There are sidebars on every page of text 
with smaller photos and a chronology which roughly relates to the chapter headings. 
</p>
<p>The style is factual and informative, and the author's prejudices don't intrude 
(that could be just because they agree with mine, but I don't detect any obvious 
adulatory bias). It seems to be pretty comprehensive (I don't claim to be an expert, 
IED and |&gt;oug are welcome to that position!) It covers much the same ground as Mr. 
Juby's book that I reviewed a couple of weeks ago, but its comparative shortness is 
due to the lack of the &quot;gossipy&quot; bits and personal opinions that spoiled that particular 
work for me. 
</p>
<p>The photos were almost all new to me - I found some of those of Kate to be 
perhaps unflattering, particularly the cover, but it's growing on me. There are a 
number of pics of relevant people and places (her school, the family, Del, etc.) which 
were interesting. 
</p>
<p>The best bit (by far, for me) is the appendix of various lists - the disc(+)ography 
is the most complete I have yet seen, including notable bootlegs, all the film work, 
books and compilation LPs (also the most up-to-date, including &quot;Sister &amp; Brother&quot; 
with Midge Ure). There's a representative list of fanzines (including an address to 
get info on Jay's limited-edition photo-collection &quot;Cathy&quot;), and finally some amusing 
trivia lists (Kate's favourite artists, likes and dislikes).

<h2>Subject: Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary 
</h2>


<p>IED devoted the day to a careful annotative reading of the newest of KT 
biographies, called Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary. This time, mindful of his 
embarassing lapse in judgement in the Kerry Juby Affair (a lapse which he 
attributes to the dizzying effect that the release of any book about Kate is likely to 
have on his critical faculties), he took his time, read the whole book cover to cover 
(taking punctilious notes the while), and then went out for a calming dinner with 
friends (yes, IED has friends!) before commenting. He will report on the book's 
specific contents in a future posting. For now, however, IED will say that this latest 
book is the best of any unofficial biography to have emerged so far. 
</p>
<p>First, as a visual record, it's a great package. The photos are very well 
reproduced, with good colour and sharp resolution. And there are lots and lots of 
them, from every stage of Kate's adult career. (No photos of Kate as a child are 
included--with the exception of the same old blurry school-photos; but the years 
1978-87 are well covered.) Naturally, the authors had absolutely no personal 
communication of any kind with Kate herself, but then that is nothing new. And 
naturally, as a result, all testimony from &quot;former school-friends&quot;, etc., remains as 
suspect as ever. Still, the text--which has very little padding--has fewer errors of 
fact than any of the others; is less annoying; is both less unfairly critical and less 
sycophantic; and is better written than the others. This is not to say it's perfect. 
</p>
<p>There are errors, and many of them; it is not without its irritating points, foolish 
and ill-founded judgements, and moments of indecorous gushing; and it's not 
Shakespeare. Also, with the exception of one new source (the make-up effects team 
for the Experiment IV video-shoot) the new book contains almost literally no 
hitherto unknown information. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, IED can safely say that (excluding John Carder Bush's Cathy, of 
course, which is on an altogether different level) no book has yet appeared that can 
compete with A Visual Documentary. It's filled with facts, the preponderance of 
which are accurately recounted; and its authors have more than one or two 
interesting and plausible ideas about the meaning of Kate's work. (They also have a 
few silly ones, but that's not so terrible.) All in all, IED gives this book a grade of 
(gulp) A-. Which is damn high by his standard. For what it is--a general record of 
Kate's public life story, without many new insights but with a higher standard of 
factual precision-- Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary is really very good, and IED 
recommends it to all new but loyal fans. And he is very relieved to be able to do this, 
because now he can officially rescind any and all recommendations he may ever have 
made, in a moment of weakness, of any other unofficial Kate Bush biography. 
</p>
<p>With this new option in the bookshops, IED can advise with an easy conscience: 
&quot;DON'T buy the Juby book--save yourselves $10 and get A Visual Documentary .&quot; 
(IED paid about $20 for his copy). 
</p>
<p>Too bad Love-Hounds didn't get a mention at the back, but Robyn's Still 
Breathing and Erni Heramia's ever-improving Watching Storms both did--with the 
addresses spelled correctly and everything.)

an expert &quot;on the fan in history&quot;. He and his wife apparently have some new book 
out on fans (as in pop or film fans). The presenter made some reference to a 
description in the book of one Kate fan who apparently tried to collect Kate's bath 
water from the overflow pipe outside her house! This led on to a discussion of 
Fred's strange behaviour when he was writing his book. This included following 
Kate around and trying to climb up her drainpipe whilst drunk. He claimed that he 
was trying to understand the obsessive behaviour of many fans and just chose Kate 
as a suitable victim (my word). He likened his book to an absurdist novel. I have 
never read his biog. of Kate but it sounded like a load of &lt;expletive deleted&gt;. Neil

<p>&gt; Fred and Judy Vermerol (sp?) were on Radio 4's Midweek programme this 
morning. Fred, who wrote an unofficial &quot;pop biog&quot; on Kate Bush was described as 
an expert &quot;on the fan in history&quot;. 
</p>


<p>Actually Fred wrote two unofficial biogs of Kate. Kate and family sued over the 
first one and it got pulled from the shelves. The first one was written pre-*Never for 
Ever* and was a scandal sheet sort of affair -- containing photos of Kate's (alleged) 
first lover, etc. In this biography, he was highly critical of Kate. The second 
biography (done post-*The Dreaming*) was rather strange in light of the first 
biography. Instead of being critical, instead it seemed like the author was 
masturbating extensively while writing every sentence. It covered the history of the 
Bush clan back through the dawn of time, contained a photo of the very ditch that 
Kate's great grandfather supposedly drowned in while walking home from the pub, 
etc. When it gets to Kate it goes on and and analyzing the symbology of Kate's lips 
and nipples and does an analyses of her work with respect to David Hockney and 
Post Structuralist theory, etc. 
</p>
<p>I could never quite figure out where this bizarre dude was coming from. More 
recently, he said that his biogs of Kate weren't really biogs of Kate at all -- they 
were writing exercises. For the first one, he wanted to try his hand at writing a 
scandal sheet and Kate seemed like as good a subject as any. For the second biog, he 
wanted to write a book from the point of view of a crazed professor obsessed with a 
pop icon, and again he figured Kate was as good a subject as any. In light of this, it 
all makes sense. Vermorel is a weird dude.

<p>Guess who's got a new book out? Fred and Judy Vermorel! Yes, the same folks 
who brought us Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia and The Secret History of Kate 
Bush (and the Strange Art of Pop) have a new book, called Fandemonium. Those of 
you who have read their earlier works can imagine what this one's like. Page after 
page of weird things fans have done. Fortunately, Kate is mentioned only once, very 
briefly. They have a paragraph about the guy who saved bath water from Kate's 
outdoor overflow pipe. 
</p>
<p>In the &quot;About The Authors&quot;, it says that the Vermorels &quot;perpetrated books about 
Kate Bush.. .&quot; I think &quot;perpetrated&quot; is an excellent choice of word.

popping into existence normally in ashtrays, vases and glove compartments. It 
chooses its shape to allay suspicion, and common manifestations are paperclips, the

</h2>


<p>Last week, I asked some questions about the following poem, written by Kate a 
few years ago: 
</p>
<h2>What could be worse than losing someone you love? 
</h2>
<h2>They are both losing each other, 
</h2>
<h2>Both trying to make it easier for each other. 
</h2>
<h2>A mother and daughter with so much courage and love,

</h2>
<h2> -- Kate Bush 
</h2>


<p>It appears on the back of a book below quotes from M. Scott Peck, Jim Henson, 
and two others. The book is Give Me One Wish, by Jacquie Gordon. Yes, the title of 
the book does come from &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot;. Here's the story: 
</p>


<p>Christine Gordon, the daughter of Jacquie, was a typical American girl except 
that she had cystic fibrosis. The book is about Chris's struggle for life, and her 
eventual succumbence to the disease. Chris was an alternative music fan, and 
according to Homeground, her mother said Kate was a great inspiration to Chris, 
keeping her alive longer than she otherwise would have been. 
</p>
<p>Here's the passage in the book in which Kate is mentioned. Chris had long had 
the nickname of &quot;the Lionhearted&quot;, by the way. It's from pp. 313-314, for those 
interested: 
</p>


<p> A little later Chris asked me if I had time to pick up some new tapes for her. 
The new Split Enz, Time and Tide, and the Marshall Crenshaw album. She asked me 
to stay first and listen to a song from her new Kate Bush album, Lionheart. I asked, 
&quot;Is Kate Bush popular? I don't know her at all.&quot; 
</p>
<p>She thought a minute. &quot;She's English. She has a small cult following here, but 
she's better known in England.&quot; 
</p>
<p>I studied the back of the album cover while I listened. All the lyrics were there, 
but Kate Bush had written out the lyrics to this song in her own longhand. I read 
along as I listened to her haunting soprano. 
</p>
<h2>[The lyrics from &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot; appear here.] 
</h2>
<p>My face was still but my mind grabbed at the words and life tore apart inside me. 
Was she telling me at last? I had been waiting for her to speak. She had, but with 
such delicacy, I wasn't sure. 
</p>
<p>&quot;It's a beautiful song. I love the way she sighs the chorus, 'Oh England.' Could 
you play it again?&quot; 
</p>
<h2>&quot;Okay.&quot; 
</h2>
<p>&quot;Chris, do you remember when you were little I used to call you Christine the 
Lionhearted?&quot; 
</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; She sat on the sofa close to me as we listened again. There was no mistake. 
There were those words -- &quot;the war is over.. .my funeral barge, give me one kiss.. 
.give me one wish.. .my shepherd who'll bring me home.. .I don't want to go.&quot; 
</p>
<p>I was numb and wordless. I had no answer, no poetry of my own. Years of pain 
felt no different from this moment of pain. It was all the same. I couldn't imagine 
what she must feel. I was hollow and an empty wind blew through me. 
</p>


<p>The book was published in 1987, I think. Kate was nice enough to write the poem 
that went on its back cover, basically as a blurb for the book!

</h2>


<p>Gather around, folks, and I'll tell you the story of Kate's autobiography that 
never was -- or was it? 
</p>
<p>Back in the early days of her career (around 1980, I think) Kate was asked if 
she'd like to write her autobiography, and she agreed. The book was to be called 
Leaving My Tracks. It soon became obvious that Kate didn't have time to write, so 
by 1984 this project had been shelved indefinitely like so many other Kate projects 
(the Ninth Wave film, for example.) 
</p>
<p>Then, in Homeground 31 (from 1988), the editors said that a mysterious review of 
this book has turned up! They said that the following review appears in the book 
Lives And Works : 
</p>


<h2>Bush, Kate 
</h2>
<h2>Leaving My Tracks /Kate Bush. -- London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1982. 
</h2>
<h2>144 pp., 8p. of plates: ill. (some col.) ports (some col.); 30 cm. 
</h2>
<h2>ISBN 0-283-98698-7 (cased). ISBN 0-283-98799-5 (pbk.) *
</h2>


<h2>[* this book is The Whole Story by Kerry Juby. Compare the ISBN !! --WIE ]
</h2>


<p>In this beautifully illustrated book Kate Bush gives an account of her approach to 
her work, techniques, inspirations and lifestyle. An interesting, unselfconscious 
attempt at autobiography, it does not appear to be written with the aid of a ghost 
writer and is surprisingly fluent. 
</p>


<p>Homeground was flabbergasted, as you can imagine. A copy of this book, if it 
really exists, would be incredibly desirable. But they could apparently not find 
anything more about it than this paragraph. Well, I might be able to get one step 
closer to the truth now. 
</p>
<p>You see, I've actually found a copy of this book in the Livermore Public Library, 
of all places! (Not Leaving My Tracks, but Lives And Works ). 
</p>
<p>To start with, the book is in fact NOT called Lives And Works. That's the name 
of the chapter! If Homeground only saw a photograph of the relevant page, the 
chapter name is at the top, so maybe that's why they thought that that was the title. 
</p>
<p>The book is called Popular Music Since 1955, written by Paul Taylor, and 
published in 1985. Our library has the American edition published by G. K. Hall &amp; 
Co. It was originally published in Britain by: 
</p>
<h2>Mansell Publishing Limited 
</h2>
<h2>6 All Saints Street 
</h2>
<h2>London N1 9RL 
</h2>
<h2>England 
</h2>
<p>So now what somebody in England should do is write to Paul Taylor, care of this 
address. I'd do it myself but it would be much faster and cheaper if somebody there 
would do it, since both the publisher and author are there. If the Homeground 
people read this, they might want to try this. It's my experience that most authors 
contacted in this way will eventually respond. 
</p>
<p>The question that should be asked is: &quot;Did you have some sort of copy of that 
book? If not, what's the story about the review? If yes, WHERE IS IT NOW?&quot;

<p>Don't bother. The book is not in print, nor has it ever been. I'd actually be 
surprised if it ever existed in any form, other than some handwritten pages by Kate, 
but this review of it is interesting. The only two reasonable hypotheses are: (1) Kate 
did finish it to some degree, some demo copies were printed and given to some 
people to mull over, and then Kate and/or the publishing company decided they 
didn't like it and cancelled its publication. (2) The publishing company paid off some 
critics to give it a good review before it ever even existed in expectation of its 
imminent delivery from Kate, who never actually delivered it.

<h2>Subject: Terry Pratchett about KaTe Bush 
</h2>


<p>A couple of months ago somebody wrote about the novel 'Eric' by Terry 
Pratchett (author of the Discword series), where he mentions KaTe Bush albums in a 
footnote (he loves footnotes). 
</p>
<p>According to the story the universe doesn't always start with small and simple 
things, but sometimes with quite complex ones. Old KaTe Bush albums are one of 
them. 
</p>
<p>This weekend I visited a local Science Fiction Convention which hosted Terry 
Pratchett as one of the Guests of Honour (together with Anne McCaffrey, Ian 
Watson &amp; Paul Williams). So I took the chance to ask him about that and see if he is 
a KaTe fan as well. Unfortunately he isn't, but the story behind it is still worth to be 
written down. 
</p>
<p>For one thing he noticed that when he is doing a random selection from his 
record collection KaTe Bush albums seem to have a much higher chance. 
</p>
<p>The other story he told is that when he wants to get a tape to listen in the car he 
looks for one at the patrol station. And from the selection there KaTe Bush and 
Queen tapes (note: he's talking about Britain here) are the only ones where he 
doesn't risk to vomit.

Plumstead, Surrey (didn't think Bexleyheath Maternity Hospital was in Surrey...

<p>The following is an excerpt from a the last KATE BUSH SET SALE list I received

</p>


<p>&quot; There is good news for those of you who seek up to date documentation of all 
of the rarest KaTe goodies. I am working with author Robert Godwin on a book 
about KaTe titled &quot;THE ILLUSTRATED COLLECTOR'S GUIDE TO KATE BUSH&quot;. 
Robert Godwin has authored the LED ZEPPELIN book &quot;THE ILLUSTRATED 
COLLECTORS GUIDE TO LED ZEPPELIN&quot; in which attention to detail is excellent. 
This book will contain over 350 photographs of the rarest KaTe Bush collectables in 
the world and catalog numbers of all known releases both promo and stock LP's, 
CD's, 45's, radio and promo only items, plus video listings, books, sheet music and 
more. This book will certainly be a welcome addition to all KaTe Bush collections, 
and the first edition will be limited. I contributed much of the information contained 
in the book and have made arrangements with Robert to be the main supplier in the 
United States. The book is completed and at the printer now. I will have copies to 
ship on the release date of December 1st, 91. The advanced price of the book is $10.95 
plus $3.00 shipping. I am taking orders now.&quot;

<p>I received a copy of &quot;The Illustrated Collectors Guide to Kate Bush&quot; by Robert 
Goodwin in the post yesterday. I ordered this from the shop Scott Telford mentioned 
(Digest #7.389). I have mixed opinions about it though overall find it quite a nice 
thing to have (though not cheap at #10-00). 
</p>
<p>The most useful things about the book are the photos of the items such as 
different pic sleeves and promo items. Since it is almost impossible to include every 
pressing of a Kate disc the book is of necessity just a snapshot of the Kate Bush 
genre. As it says in the introduction, Tom Richards provide 90% of the rare stuff 
included. Hence, the book reflects the items Tom has obtained and tends to cover 
mostly US, Canadian, Japanese, German, French stuff etc. and there is less from 
more inaccessible countries. 
</p>
<p>I found the layout of the book a bit confusing at first as the text and photos are 
intermixed so that it is not immediately obvious what goes together. However, it does 
cover practically every medium - tapes, vinyl, CD, video, books, magazines etc. It 
includes catalogue numbers for practically everything. There is no attempt to put a 
value on any of the collectible items and only the occasional attempt to indicate the 
rarity of something. There is a small section on fanzines but no mention of 
Lovehounds :-( 
</p>
<p>Despite the reservations I do not regret buying it and it would be useful for 
anyone with the time and money who intends to build up a Kate Bush collection.

<p>The book itself is 8 1/2 x 5 1/2 and 142 pages in length. The cover is a color photo

listings covering albums, CD's, 45's and CD singles, LaserDiscs, Videos, Interview 
discs, promotional records and CD's, bootlegs and bootleg CD's, books, sheet music, 
fanzines, guest appearances and TV appearances. In addition there are something 
like 350 b&amp;w photos. Needless to say this little book covers a lot of ground. Naturally 
there are many things listed within these pages I don't have, interestingly there are 
a few KaTe items in my possession that I have yet to find listed, perhaps closer

<h2>Subject: Kate Bush - the First Twelve Years 
</h2>


<p>I think I mentioned this a few weeks ago. It's a limited-edition (either 200 or 
2000, can't remember which) publication (by the Never Forever fanzine folks) in the 
shape of two A4 photocopied volumes (each about 80 pages, it says - I haven't 
checked) and is basically a scrapbook of UK magazine and newspaper 
articles/interviews/reviews (plus one that looks like Dutch) in roughly chronological 
order, plus the Peter Swales interview and the story of Jamie Amos's Ninth Hound 
painting. Unfortunately, it's not possible to tell which magazine some of the articles 
are from and the photos don't reproduce well, but it's an interesting read. 
</p>
<p>A lot of the reviews of TKI and Lh seem to be fairly negative 
(&quot;nails-on-a-blackboard&quot; voice&quot;, &quot;more like 1968 than 1978&quot; etc.) but by the time HoL 
was released the reviewers were resorting to Anglo-Saxon expletives (eg. &quot;Kate 
Bush is a f**king genius&quot;) to convey their impressions and using words like 
&quot;subversive&quot; and &quot;threatening&quot;, which seem to be complementary if they come from 
music journalists 8^). 
</p>
<p>There's also at least one hilarious account of the HoL launch at the London 
Laserium (&quot;Del Palmer was wearing some of his hair in a plait, but most of it in his 
sideburns&quot;). 
</p>
<p>Probably the best indictment of the British gutter press is an article about Al 
Murphy's funeral. There's a photo of KaTe looking rather distressed, with Del by 
her side. The caption reads &quot;Kate being comforted by her brother Johnny&quot;. 
Aaarrggghhh....

<h2>Subject: Re: Vermorel pics - where are they? 
</h2>


<p>Fred Vermoral isn't a photographer. He (and his wife Judy) wrote a pair of 
books: 
</p>
<h2>  Kate Bush - Princess of Suburbia 
</h2>
<h2>  The Secret History of Kate Bush (&amp; the strange art of pop) 
</h2>


<p>  The first was a typical rock star exploitation book. No input from Kate, her 
family or actual friends. Some of the typical bits are a photo of Al Buckle, claimed to 
be &quot;Kate's first lover&quot; and some stuff about Kate's enjoyment of smokeable herbs. It 
contain's a fair amount of actual facts (confirmed elsewhere) dressed up in purple. 
It puts way too much emphasis on Kate's family's interest in Gurdjieff. Almost all 
the interviews were done with people who *used* to work with Kate. It does have a 
load of interesting photos. It originally sold for 95 pence and has been out of print for 
more than a decade. It was tall magazine size and only 32 pages. The front cover 
features Kate in an amazing gold dress. 
</p>
<p> The second book is much more interesting. Better written and with even better 
pictures. The whole first third is about Kate's ancestors in a small village called 
Pebmarsh, and a lot about her grandfather Joe, a concientious objector. Most of the 
rest is little bits about Kate and huge hunks of Fred Vermoral's obsessive musings 
about Kate. He has said some nasty things about Kate's fans, but frankly *his* 
writing shows an obsession far more excessive than anything I've ever seen in 
love-hounds. That said, he does make some very interesting points about Kate and 
her art. 
</p>
<p> Kate and family hate these two books, and the party line is that we are supposed 
to hate them as well. But with all their flaws, Fred's two books are a more 
interesting read than the Paul Kerton book or the Kerry Juby book. I have only read 
the Juby book once, and the Kerton book twice, but the Vermoral books are 
well-thumbed.

</h2>


<p>By the way Sean Mayes the co-author of the visual documentary book has just 
recently died, there was a small obituary in the latest Q magazine(the one with 
Mozza on the front).
