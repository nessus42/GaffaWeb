      <BR> Subject: An interesting Kate Bush quote </P>
    
    <P>I just found this interesting quote by Kate Bush while digging through
      some clippings. Unfortunately it was translated from English into French
      for publication,, and then back into English by someone else. I Wonder
      what the original quote looked like.... </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I believe in the magic reality of transformation. I believe that
      in myself occurs a continual mutation -- as if from the larva of a nymph,
      from a chrysalis nymph in the process of sublimation. Music, dance, and
      art have these powers as well. I dream and I believe that I am able to
      transmute into a butterfly.&quot; </P>

      <BR> Subject: Madonna </P>
    
    <P>Finally got a digital transfer made of new Kate UK TV appearances, the
      original PAL copy of which was sent to me from Paul Thomas, very nice fan
      I met in Romford. There were only two things I didn't already have in some
      condition or other, namely, the Top of the Pops lip-synch of RUTH, and the
      Whistle Test guest shot. The latter is fascinating, although, of course,
      very brief. The jerk who usually hosts that show was marginally less
      asinine than usual, and actually asked reasonable questions, among them:
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;What do you think of Madonna, Kate?&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Answer (paraphrase from memory): &quot;Well, I don't actually know much
      about Madonna, but I saw her on Live Aid, and she was actually quite good,
      really...&quot; {Lapse into silence and usual polite but enigmatic smile}
    </P>
    
    <P>Question: &quot;But you do things very differently from Madonna, don't
      you; I mean, not selling a sexy image, and all that...?&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Answer: Silence, polite but not-so-enigmatic smile... </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate on Tori Amos </P>
    
    <P>Larry Hernandez wrote:
      <BR> &gt; Even if it was possible, I couldn't imagine Kate stooping to
      the level of mentioning Tori in any context.. Which makes me wonder: Has
      Kate ever deigned to remark on this Tori phenomenon? </P>
    
    <P>In the Tower Records-produced (I believe but could be wrong) magazine
      called 'Pulse,' Kate was interviewed to promote The Red Shoes. She was
      asked about several artists whose work has apparent similarity to hers.
      When she was asked whether she'd heard a Tori Amos song, she answered in
      the affirmative and said, &quot;It was...umm, nice.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Tori on the other hand has been quoted as saying the following: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Yeah, I guess we could do each other's songs.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Sometimes I want to tell her to stop screaming, there's no mouse.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>and finally, </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I think she smokes a bit more weed than I do.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>What Kate meant by &quot;...umm, nice&quot; is up to debate, but these
      quotes are all pretty indicative of Kate and Tori's *differences*, don't
      you think? If there are ill feelings, they're being demurely swept under
      the carpet by one and boisterously beaten out of it by the other. </P>
