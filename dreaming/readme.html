<P ALIGN="center">Hey, that's why I READ <A HREF="news:rec.music.gaffa">rec.music.gaffa</A>!
KaTe fans are much more intelligent  than mere humans, so when they argue, it is
a work of art. I love reading the endless  discussions ...</P>

<P>Hello folks, I'm back from the archives! And, I did it all! </P>
<P>Someone, sometime: &quot;As for the Love-Hounds archives, my ftp just laughs
at me when I try to connect  to anything not within walking distance.&quot; 
</P>
<P>IED, Jan '89: &quot;A couple of problems with that idea. First, IED doesn't
know what the fuck  (pardon his French) an &quot;FTP&quot; is, nor does he
particularly want to find out.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Mmmh. Okay, so, here comes a KT-filtered version. From 50 MB down to  6 MB. 
Very best-of'ed, very enjoyable, I hope. No flames (okay, I left some
artistic/funny  ones), no bitmaps, no multiples of multiples of copies, no
lengthy headers, no sigs,  etc. and ordered by topics! It took me several
months.  I hope you will enjoy reading. 
</P>
<P>If you are interested in what was going on ten years ago on this list, have
a look  at DREAMING. I filtered the archive as I did before for
<A HREF="../moments/index.html">MOMENTS</A> (a Red Shoes collection). I selected
every information on KT and related things (I hope)  and deleted all other &quot;nonsense&quot;.
I did this for fun, I enjoyed reading every bit of it.  And I learned a lot.
Even some new words, that are not in my dictionary (&quot;pratt&quot;,  &quot;having
a wank&quot;...). I hope you will enjoy reading my compilation. In the back  of
my head I did it also with the intention of compiling a material list for a 
SUPER-GARDEN (hi IED). 
</P>
<P>Also I think, we're now in the time of KT becoming 'history'. And it's at
least  in part up to us to save the facts for future investigations. 
</P>
<P>As in <A HREF="../moments/index.html">MOMENTS</A>, quotes start with a &quot;&gt;&quot;
only in front of the first paragraph to  allow grouped style, then followed by a
blank line. I often changed the &quot;Subject&quot; to  fit better to the real
subject. I also deleted whole paragraphs in the mails, which  were not
interesting (to me), leaving in some cases only a &quot;PS&quot;! I also left
out things  that went into the <A HREF="../garden/index.html">GARDEN</A> or
<A HREF="../cloud/index.html">CLOUDBUSTING</A>, like the various discographies, 
some interviews etc. . So, be warned. This is a very subjective, biased
collection. If  you want to see the real truth, you have to do it all over again
on your own. I think,  Ron Hill wanted to do this, too, and announced something
called &quot;Deeper  Understanding&quot;, but it never appeared in public. Maybe
he was tired from CB? Well,  you really did your Kate-job, Ron! (What's a
Kate-job?) Btw, where is Ron? 
</P>
<P>The beginning of this list in 1985 was more like a
rec.dougalanexplains.music than  the list I know from today. But it's completely
okay! Doug is a very, VERY nice guy  (as far as one can deduce this from his
postings) and one with many good ideas. I  enjoyed reading everything. Doug
dominated the list very strongly (he was the only  KateFan at that time on LH)
and so it's not surprising, that many of the now  commonly accepted (?)
explanations of KT songs came out of his brain. 
</P>
<P>The time Doug was away for his KT interview, the rest of the group talked 
most of the time about the THE !!!! the rest of the time they talked about
everything  else except KT !!! 
</P>
<P>BTW, the interview was in fact more Kate Bush interviewing Doug Alan, as far
 as we can deduce this from his transcription. :-) 
</P>
<P>The list more and more &quot;degenerated&quot; to a list with Doug
explaining and  informing about KT, while all others constantly talking about
all thinkable other  subjects. Doug fought for a lost cause...
</P>
<P>But in April 1986 everything changed. A new STAR arose from the dust. </P>
<H2 ALIGN="center">    I  E  D!</H2>
<P>With two giant &quot;Venturing into the Garden&quot; mails he forced the
list back to its  trail. </P>
<P>AND: The flamewar began....</P>
<P>&gt; From: Mark Woodruff <BR> &gt; Subject: shit <BR> &gt; You're full of
it, and this essay reeks of it. <BR> &gt; Take me off the mailing list, Doug, I
can't stand the smell any more. 
</P>
<P>Oh, I really felt sorry for IED in the beginning, killed several times, just
after  entering the arena with absolute appropriate topics. I'm really
interested in IED's  thoughts after these reactions. I think in the beginning he
waited hopefully for some  constructive comments or maybe a real intellectual
discussion? 
</P>
<P>IED: &quot;My sincere thanks to everyone for their patience and
consideration.  Responses, obviously, are encouraged.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Waiting to hear any comments from l-h's nation-wide...&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;... but why so little feedback on Kate Bush? </P>
<P>--------------------<BR> Date:    Wed, 04 Jun 86 16:14 PDT <BR> From:
IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: Oh, forchrissake! 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH...remember?   [complete message! --WIE]<BR> ---------------------</P>
<P>But after that in 1986ff he really went a bit crazy. It was too much, don't
you  think, IED? Your &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;-period? 
</P>
<P>IED illuminates the origin of his style:  &quot;Partly out of a feeling of
empathy for such a means of justifying one's  obsessions, I have chosen to adopt
Reich's pedantic forms and ponderous style in  dealing with the work of Kate
Bush, since this kind of obsessive interest in another  person's life and work
is better disguised, I think, when couched in the dry-as-dust  language of the
Orgonotic scholar.&quot; (May 1986) 
</P>
<P>Sometimes I got the feeling, that you played a psychological experiment with
the  members of the list, did you? 
</P>
<P>In my compilation you may think I overemphasized IED a bit, but that's
because  I really enjoyed reading his mails. I hope, you will, too. Also it's
for historical  reasons! 
</P>
<P>And you have to take into account, that at that time IED and Doug were the
only  two hardcore fans on the list! If one needs a &quot;tour de force&quot;
through 1986ff., simply  download the archive and set your &quot;Search&quot;-pointer
to &quot;IED&quot;.  Thank you IED for your presence. 
</P>
<P>Hey folks, this list and its inherent knowledge benefits soo strongly from
IED and  Doug, that we can't praise their efforts enough! So, I wish both of you
a very, very  Big Sky to the end of your long lives! 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is absolutely no question that, to date, The Dreaming and Hounds
of Love  constitute, collectively, the greatest achievement in 20th century
Western music.&quot;  (IED, June 1986) 
</P>
<P>When reading all this stuff, the question comes to mind, what job did you've
had,  IED, that you could do all of these writings/transcriptions/investigations
etc.? Did  you got one of these rare assistant-whatever jobs at the university?
Sitting there the  whole day long in a bureau, thinking: &quot;What can I do
today?&quot; Or do you need no  sleep? (IED NEVER SLEEPS!) He invested
incredible amounts of time into this KT  business. 
</P>
<P>Once someone said, that this is all to much for him and he has sent one of
IED's  sermons to KT! Now you saw IED REALLY nervous! It seemed to be a joke,
but IED  repeatedly asked about the case, what exactly he has sent, to what
address, if he got  any responses etc. And I think he thought about a letter by
himself? 
</P>
<P>The next interesting person that appeared on the show was Jonathan Drukman. 
He could keep pace with IED intellectually and, musician and producer himself, 
could contribute very valuable technical bits. With constant malice he wrote :&gt;oug
 instead of |&gt;oug, who then always lost his cool.  [&quot; There!  You did it
again!  -- |&gt;oug &quot;] 
</P>
<P>Jon also set IED's head right several times, when he had written nonsense
(this  happened from time to time). - The most rational man on the line. 
</P>
<P>The main problem with IED at that time was, that he spent enormous amounts
of  time in answering everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. Many other people 
simply had not the time to answer in the same way. This resulted in some
irritation  and annoyance. And they took him far too serious (&quot;You are
truly psychotic.&quot;) !!!  IED, you have my admiration for manipulating this
group, really cool, but it's also a  dangerous thing! 
</P>
<P>In April 1989 the Cathy Demos came to the public ear.  And they started a
giant tape tree... Everybody had to send his request to the  mailing list!!!
What a good idea!!! 
</P>
<P>From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt; <BR> &quot;Hi there. Your
humble pseudo-moderator has returned from the beautiful  Highlands of Scotland
to see that Love-Hounds has sunk to a new low. What do I  find upon returning,
but a hundred messages posted to the entire mailing list saying  &quot;I want
one too!&quot;. Haven't any of you read the netiquette guide? Or at least have 
some common sense? Do you think thousands of people want to read &quot;I want
one  too&quot;? Don't you realize that the cost to send out all of those
messages could  probably have paid for every reader of this mailing list to have
several copies of the  tape? Will I ever be able to leave Love-Hounds on
autopilot ever again?&quot; 
</P>
<P>And they discussed to excess the pros and cons of doing such an evil thing
of  copying this bootleg strictly against KT's will; with IED as the head of all
this!!! 
</P>
<P>Then in July 1989 the dawn of The Sensual World. It's abso-blooming-lutely
great  to read along with all this and listen to the album! 
</P>
<P>The most discussed topic was, if the laugh between L&amp;A and The Fog
belongs to  L&amp;A or The Fog or has to be considered as a separate &quot;song&quot;!
 [My personal view on this is, that the laugh belongs to the &quot;Yeah&quot;.
That is, she  knows, we love her for saying these sexy &quot;Yeah's&quot; and
she did it for us (&quot;Yeah&quot;), but  couldn't hold back a big laugh about
it, like: &quot;Have you heard it? I did it again.&quot;  --WIE]
</P>
<P>Also history teaches us, that it was NOT Jorn Barger, who discovered the 
Ulysses-origin of TSW, but Julian West. Jorn only posted the final line by line 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>Something very strange must have hit IED in the beginning of 1990. I don't
know  what it was but he wasn't the same afterwards. There were no posts for
some  month and after that only short ones on special topics. Mmmh. Fatal
Kateian dream  experiences? Or something more mundane? 
</P>
<P>In 1990 several lovehounds experienced the KonvenTion 1990! Very magical and
 moving reviews and a detailed transcription of the interview section by IED. 
</P>
<P>In 1991 Ron Hill split into ten Ron Hill clones and they posted approx. one 
accurately transcribed interview per day! Giant (Kate-)job! <BR> And: In 1991
we finally got Rocket Man and Candle In The Wind! Other than  these, 1991 was
rather boring. <BR> In Jan. 1992 a person with prior knowledge could detect the
first signs of 'Jorn  going mad'. :-(( Great shit! Is he still in his
'warmroom', btw?
</P>
<P>In Febr. 1992 Hannah, KaTe's mum died. Looking back from now, it seems to be
 the biggest break ever in Kate's life. I hope, she has enough angels around.
<BR> The Red Shoes: For H. 
</P>
<P>All in all 1992 was rather boring, too. IED was away... But there was ONE
man,  called Ron Hill... 
</P>
<P>All the TRS-stuff from 1993-1995 went into <A HREF="../moments/index.html">MOMENTS</A>,
my Red Shoes collection.  Everything else is included in this compilation. It
stops at the of 1995. 
</P>
<P>All new stuff will go into a hypothetical KB-8 collection. </P>
<P>What do we learn from all this?

<P>When reading my compilation, don't tell me: &quot;There's too much IED!&quot;
I answer:  Read the archive and find out HOW MUCH I have omitted! And: He worked
like a  berserker, really. I still haven't found out, why he did that. But he
did and for our all  good. Thank's for your example, IED! In your bright light
little Wieland hides in the  corner...
</P>
<P>Okay, that's it. Enjoy! Have a party! </P>

<P> You want my reply? - What was the question?) </P>
