<P>Date: Wed, 8 Nov 89 12:34:16 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review of the album in the Nov. 13 People 
</P>
<P>Yes, People magazine has a review of the album. It's actually coupled with a
 review of The Innocence Mission's first album. Since this magazine is widely 
available in the US, I will paraphrase the review. Anybody who needs a complete 
copy should e-mail me. 
</P>
<P>He (David Hiltbrand) starts out praising her vocal qualities. She is &quot;one
of the  most striking stylists in pop music.. .By turns stern and breathily
fragile in the lower  range, her voice is quite ethereal in its upper reaches.&quot;
He calls the melodies and  harmonies &quot;adventurous and exotic&quot;, as
usual for Bush. He mentions the &quot;sensuous,  snake-charmer allure of the
title track&quot;, and the &quot;mock woodwind, river-fairy  piping&quot; on &quot;Never
Be Mine.&quot; He then says, &quot;The most exciting moments in the Bush  canon
have come when her reserve melts and the passion of the music carries her  away.
That happens here on &quot;Love &amp; Anger&quot; and &quot;Heads We're Dancing,&quot;
but not  often enough. The album is, though, often pretty and thoroughly
characteristic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Then he says that Bush fans may want to check out The Innocence Mission. He 
says that lead singer Karen Peris's voice is &quot;similar to Bush's, if
slightly earthier.&quot;  He concludes by saying, &quot;Though many of the songs
are more traditional in form  than Bush's leaps of fancy, at their best [they
are] creating music every bit as  entrancing as the idiom's past mistress, old
Kate herself. The similarity in sounds is  a serendipitous treat for listeners.&quot;

<P>From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt; <BR> Date: Thu, 09 Nov 89
12:46:24 EST <BR> Subject: Campus Calendar 
</P>
<P>The following is a review of *The Sensual World* from the November *Campus 
Calendar: Boston's Independent Guide to College Activities*. It is a free rag
that is  published in Brookline and littered around college campuses in the
Boston area: 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD Columbia 
</P>
<P>On the surface, Kate Bush's first album in four years is a letdown,
especially in  comparison to 1985 masterstroke *Hounds of Love*. You expect more
from this  British art-rock veteran, especially in the face of all the female
newcomers (Enya,  Sinead O'Connor, the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Frazer) who have
scored with  etherial vocals which echo those of Bush. But a closer listen to
*The Sensual World*  reveals a more personal album, as Bush searches within
herself, as a person, a  woman and an adult. Musically, the album is less
grabbing, but eclectic touches still  exist, including the use of Irish pipes, a
&quot;psychiatrist&quot; dialogue and the Bulgarian  female vocal group The Trio
Bulgarka. Producer Bush keeps the Bulgarian vocalists  low in the mix, except
for &quot;Rockets' [sic] Tail,&quot; where their exotic style distracts  from
her own vocal. 
</P>
<P>That piece erupts into a lurching rhythm a la Pink Floyd -- it is one of two
songs  featuring Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, who financed Bush's first demo
tape in the  mid-'70s. Bush is more in focus on the glorious &quot;Reaching Out&quot;,
about a child's  &quot;push and pull&quot; with its mother, and &quot;This
Woman's Work,&quot; a piano ballad about  missed chances with a mate who has
passed on. It is surely one of Bush's barest,  most emotive songs in many years.

</P>
<P>It doesn't compare to &quot;Under The Ivy&quot;, however. 
</P>
<P>|&gt;oug 
</P>
<P>&quot;A is for Amy who fell down the stairs&quot;

<P>Date: Thu, 9 Nov 89 22:09:05 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review of the album from the Oct. 18 RAW 
</P>
<P>Here's the review of the album from the Oct. 18 RAW (Rock Action Worldwide),
 a British magazine that seems to specialize in heavy metal. Despite their
focus, this  is, once again, a rave review. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' (EMI EMD 1010) 
</P>
<P>A Kate Bush album is unlike anything else. There are no comparative works 
against which it can be judged. It just *is*. Kate Bush has successfully defined
an  area of modern Rock music for herself. She herself becomes the only
reference  point by which her work makes any sense. It's a unique situation. 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' is a 'Russian doll' of a composition, as Ms. Bush
marries  music from East and West. You decipher one level of meaning only to
discover  another, equally as perplexing beneath. But, like a Chinese puzzle,
you know the  solution is in there somewhere if only you can figure it out. 
</P>
<P>Initially I perceived that, as usual, Ms. Bush was giving little away. But
as I  unwrapped each underlying 'doll' I began to see that this album is almost
singularly  confessional. 'The Fog', 'Reaching Out' and 'This Woman's Work'
offer  enticingly veiled portraits of this world. Snapshots from her childhood
come  shrouded in mystery, blurred photographs of her family life enveloped in a
soft,  warm afterglow of remembrance. Both the music and production on this
record are  uniformly excellent. Like a siren, Ms. Bush ensnares her listener. 
</P>
<P>'Heads We're Dancing' -- a bizarre tale, like an answer to the Stones'
'Sypathy  For The Devil' -- and 'Rocket's Tail' find guitars pushed up in the
mix, the latter  featuring Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour as Kate dances on
the edge of Hard  Rock. But it's still the more introverted pieces, 'Deeper
Understanding' -- a love  affair with a computer -- 'Never Be Mine' and the
family snapshots above, which I  find most compelling and intriguing. Like coded
messages I have spent hours  wrapped in their mysteries, unravelling their dark
and beautiful secrets. 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' is an artistic triump and quite possibly Kate Bush's
finest  work ever. ***** [The highest rating]  -- Dave Dickson 
</P>
<P>I think this review comes quite close to explaining what *I* like about Kate
so  much.

<P>Date: Sat, 11 Nov 89 22:05:26 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Oct. 25 Number One 
</P>
<P>First of all, I found a couple more really great reviews of the album. 
</P>
<P>Here's the review from the Oct. 25 Number One (a British teeny-bopper 
magazine which has something about Kylie Minogue on every other page). The first
 sentence of this one is definitely one for the ages. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World (EMI) 
</P>
<P>***** [The highest rating] 
</P>
<P>The trouble with Kate Bush is once you've listened to her music it makes the
 rest of your record collection redundant -- everything else pales into
insignificance  against the fabulously original, mystical, magical music she
makes. And, oh joy, 'The  Sensual World' is yet another magnificent offering
from the elfinlike one, well  worth every minute of the four year wait since
'Hounds Of Love'. The title track  has to be the most sensual, sexual thing ever
written while you'll weep at 'This  Woman's Work' (from the film She's Having A
Baby ). It'll take several listens to  get used to a Kate Bush who's a little
less, um, *complicated* than on superlative  albums like 'The Dreaming', though
even seemingly straightforward songs like the  disco-ish 'Heads We're Dancing'
and the thumping 'Love And Anger' soon draw  you into their mesmerising beats.
Kate's love affair with Irish music shines through  the 10 tracks and she's also
employed the vocal skills of the warbling Bulgarian  songstresses The Trio
Bulgarka to brilliant effect on songs like 'Rocket's Tail'  when they manage to
sound like fireworks! 
</P>
<P>Kate's music is always so *different* and never appears to follow trends
which is  just as well, because as she points out, her albums take so long to
make they'd be  out of date by the time they're released. And who else could
still get away with  lyrics like, in 'Rocket's Tail', &quot;I put on my
cloudiest suit/Size 5 lightning boots  too/Cos I am a rocket&quot;. Ho yes,
Kate's back with a vengeance -- one artist who  makes records worth buying. 
</P>
<P>-- Kate &quot;Bush&quot; Davies 
</P>
<P>-----------------------------
</P>
<P>Next, from the Nov. 2 issue of Hot Press (Irish), we have the following
review: 
</P>
<P>SENSURROUND! 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; (EMI) 
</P>
<P>[Rating:] 10 [out of 12] 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush rests uneasily in the comfortably given world of pop. Unlike Joni 
Mitchell, or Joan Armatrading, or Tracy Chapman, or Maria McKee, she is no 
troubadour. Her music and textures and literacy and theatricality are too dense
and  complex for the current back-to-the-strum movement. 
</P>
<P>She seems ever the troubled, overly-gifted youngster who finds shelter in
her  room, in her gifts, in her imagination, *in the space within*, rather than
running  away and hanging out with the misfits and desperadoes on Pebble Beach.
An  internalised, rather than an externalised, loner -- but a loner
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>There are many things to like and respect about Kate Bush, and this is one
of  them. She is not a part of any mainstream (she isn't even part of the loner 
mainstream!). 
</P>
<P>Clearly she has strength of character to follow her own instincts, her own
values  -- and her own way of working; with a small, close, almost familiar
group of  collaborators, she has maintained a remarkable degree of independence
from the  uglier side of the music business, and a tight control over her own
output. Which is  fine with EMI, I dare say, since Kate Bush is also remarkably
successsful. 
</P>
<P>Another factor which isolates her from the mainstream is the particular 
Englishness of her muse. This album could never be American: the textual focus
of  &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is distinctly European, with Davy Spillane,
the Trio Bulgarka  and Alan Stivell contributing to the eclectic brew. What's
involved however is not  the adoption of strange ethnic instruments and tones
and key changes for the sake of  sounding unusual and exotic. They are there for
atmosphere and perspective. One  might describe it as a cinematic approach. 
</P>
<P>The results are never less than interesting -- and sometimes they are
rivetting.  Most of the song &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; has Kate singing against
the voices of the Trio  Bulgarka, without any other instrumentation; the effect
is like a bright beam of  winter sunlight falling on an old eastern rug, in
which you suddenly see all the detail  and the wild ornamentation come to life.

</P>
<P>She could have used a synth, or a string quartet, but the Bulgarian voices
take the  whole song two or three notches further out. A brilliant sound. 
</P>
<P>Again, as a songwriter, Kate Bush is as independent as in other areas -- her
 music is full of surprising melodic moves. They are not always comfortable, nor
 necessarily pleasing, but they are almost always arresting. Take nothing for
granted  -- you don't know from where she'll come at you next. 
</P>
<P>Nowhere is this more true however than in the subjects she writes about. The
 title track is self-explanatory, but elsewhere we find her exploring (in
considerable  depth), such dark and risky areas as parent-child love, and anger
-- &quot;the pull and  push of it all&quot;, as she puts it. 
</P>
<P>Moreover, these issues are confronted with clarity and honesty. Love and
anger  are the very stuff of songwriting, but who calls them by their name? In &quot;Love
And  Anger&quot; and &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; La Bush explores the illusions
under which we labour  n the search for what we call &quot;happiness&quot;. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Fog&quot;, &quot;Reaching Out&quot; and &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;
delve into parent-child  relations, and how they echo and re-echo through our
lives. Not a comfortable  subject, and these are not comfortable songs. &quot;The
Fog&quot;, in particular, with wistful  whistles by Davy Spillane, touches on
change, on growth and decay, and how we all  inevitably come to moments where we
have to let go -- and how frighteningly alone  we can feel. 
</P>
<P>That one is for papa, but &quot;Reaching Out&quot; is for mama. &quot;See
how man reaches out  instinctively/For what he cannot have.&quot; It has one
bizarre line -- &quot;reaching out for  the hand that smacked.&quot; Yes indeed!

</P>
<P>But the core of this song, as with others, is to do with that longing for
the  unattainable safety of the womb, and the warmth and inviolability
associated with  certain formative experiences. 
</P>
<P>And in &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;: &quot;I should be hoping but I can't
stop thinking/Of  all the things we should've said/That were never said.. . All
the things that you  needed from me/all the things that you wanted for me/all
the things that I  should've given/But I didn't...&quot; 
</P>
<P>But the track to savour most is the title track. Brimming with the dark
scorpio  satisfactions of the senses, it mmm, yesss, mmmms through a successsion
of images  -- &quot;Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth&quot;
-- right inside your  head. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You don't need words,&quot; she sings, &quot;just one kiss, then
another...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm, yesssss. 
</P>

<P>Date: 8 Nov 89 01:34:13 GMT <BR> From: megadude &lt;@JHMAIL.HCF.JHU.EDU:megadude@JHUNIX.BITNET&gt;
<BR> Subject: Review of TSW, from JHU News-Letter 
</P>
<P>Here's another review of KaTe's new album, this time from the pages of the 
November 3rd issue of the &quot;Johns Hopkins News-Letter&quot;. It is followed
by a nice  review of Jane Siberry's Bound By The Beauty, but I'm not going to
type it in  unless someone wants me to (no time, no time!) It's also accompanied
by a picture  of the album cover (probably the LP) sporting the caption &quot;Kate
Bush on the cover of  'The Sensual World'&quot; (descriptive, eh?). 
</P>
<P>On to the review: 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush's Exhilarating &quot;Sensual World&quot; 
</P>
<P>by Mark W. Stewart 
</P>
<P> &quot;Mmh yes/Then I'd take the kiss of seedcake from his 
</P>
<P>mouth/Going deep down South, go down, mmh, yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P> That Kate Bush opens her new album, &quot;The Sensual World,&quot; with
such  provocative declarations signals something of a change in her lyrical
outlook. In the  past, Bush tended to couch the charged eroticism of her work in
metaphors that gave  a sense of distance. Her perchant for fantastical settings,
musical and lyrical, is less  indulged on &quot;The Sensual World&quot;: such
songs as &quot;Love and Anger&quot;, &quot;This Woman's  Work&quot;, and the
title track (quoted above) actually reach a level of realism  characteristic of
a writer like Elvis Costello. 
</P>
<P> At age thirty, after five albums of eccentric pop art, Bush seems anxious
to  abandon the life of the kinky spinster, intent on &quot;stepping out of the
page...where  the water and the earth caress&quot; and discovering &quot;the
powers of a woman's body.&quot;  While the title track combines sexual
liberation with coy come-ons (cleverly  paraphrased from the closing pages of
James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot;), the album's first  single, &quot;Love and
Anger,&quot; considers contradictory human motivations - the danger of  &quot;opening
up&quot; to one's lover and the intense desire to do just that. After seducing a
 man in the previous song, here it's as though Bush is abruptly seized with 
self-doubt. She conveys the resultant tensions via an array of bristling
electric guitar,  trap drum kits, hugely ambient Irish hand drums, and massed
vocal harmonies,  creating a mix more dense and harrowing than anything since
1982's hysteric &quot;The  Dreaming&quot;. 
</P>
<P> It's an exceptionally mature (read: confused) perception, especially in
contrast  with &quot;The God&quot;, which, while equally focused, seems
something of a lyrical step  backward. Featuring some of Bush's most exquisite
orchestral writing (arranged by  Michael Kamen), the song seems more in the
spirit of the childhood themes of her  previous album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;.
Indeed, with its Cinemascope-style production  and oceanic sound effects, &quot;The
Fog&quot; is in essense a very lovely rewrite of that  album's &quot;Hello
Earth.&quot; 
</P>
<P> A more thematically connected song, &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot;
provides one of  the album's true high points. One of the three songs featuring
the magnificently  non-Western harmonies of the Trio Bulgarka -Yanka Rupkhina,
Eva Georgieva, and  Stoyanka Bovena - &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; provides
an apt insight into Bush's  change in attitude. &quot;As the people here grow
colder/I turn to my computer/and  spend my evenings with it/like a friend,&quot;
she sings, depicting a character who seems  almost the opposite of the one who
began the album with such lewd thoughts. 
</P>
<P> Yet one gets the feeling that the &quot;deeper understanding&quot; the
woman seeks won't  be found in the architecture of computer software, but in the
warmth of the physical  - sensual - world. Certainly, it's a leap of logic to
make such assumptions; Bush has  never abided by any of the programmatic notions
common to that 70s' anachronism,  the concept album. But the sense of place,
mood, and continuity that Bush develops  through the album's eleven songs
invites the listener to take part. 
</P>
<P> Among other things, the 80s will be remembered as the decade in which 
electronic instruments - the digital sampler particularly - became primary
sources of  musical development. Classicists have accused electronics of
removing the human  element from the craft of making music. To the contrary, an
impressive amount of  time and thought is required to provide synthesized sounds
with the harmonic  richness, expression, and warmth of more traditional
instruments. 
</P>
<P> So rather than spend her time in such pursuits, Kate Bush developed a sound
 fusing traditional acoustic, rock-and-roll electric, and electronic modes and 
instrumentation. To say that &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is only the latest
refinement of  that sound would be true, but a serious understatement.

<P>Date: Sun, 19 Nov 89 16:45:32 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: From the Nov. 1989 Vinyl Propoganda 
</P>
<P>            [album review by Karen L. Newcombe!] 
</P>
<P>Vinyl Propaganda is the monthly publication of the Western Association of
Rock  Disk Jockeys, and it is published in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>The November 1989 issue has a review of the single (&quot;The Sensual World&quot;),
and  later an independent review of the album. Here's the review of the single:

</P>
<P>Kate Bush &quot;The Sensual World&quot; - EMI (U.K.) 
</P>
<P>I promise you this: there is nothing to dance to, no hard edge stuff for
college  radio, and easy listening stations will be bored to death but mark my
words, this  record will be bought by many. (Pretty bold, huh?) Kate never
ceases to surprise us  and neither does her husband/photographer [sic, sic, sic,
sic, sic!] who continually  manages to find another aspect of her beauty and
capture it for the world to see.  That alone would be enough to own the import
12&quot; but wait, the song inside, so  sweet and spooky, so much emotion, I can
listen to it endlessly, but -- I have a  column to write so, let's get on with
it. 
</P>
<P>-- Ted Cousens 
</P>
<P>I think I'll send a postcard to this guy informing him of his error. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, here's the review of the album: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD Columbia 
</P>
<P>She fairly cackles in your ear, then confides, &quot;You see, I'm all grown
up now.&quot;  Not only has Kate Bush grown up, she has spent three years in her
studio distilling  rocket fuel. Her seventh album, THE SENSUAL WORLD, is going
to grab you by  the hair and drag you away. Kate has brought together some of
the best talent in the  business: David Gilmore [sic], Eberhard Weber, Davy
Spillane, Alan Stivell, and Nigel  Kennedy, as well as the remarkable Trio
Bulgarka (the tree lead vocals on the  phenomenal MYSTERE VOIX DE BULGARES [sic]
albums). THE SENSUAL  WORLD is far and away the best album Kate has produced,
and with a string of  double and triple platinum albums to her credit, [in the
UK, that is] that is saying a  lot. 
</P>
<P>You may have heard the unusual first single, &quot;The Sensual World.&quot;
Kate's warm  and embracing echo of Molly Bloom's primal &quot;Yes, I said yes..
.&quot; gives little warning  of what you are in for. With the second song, &quot;Love
And Anger,&quot; Kate has created a  paen to the mystery of the human condition
that will pick you up and carry you  away. The songs follow with unremitting
power and unity, the most rock of any  album Kate has done (Dave G. has brought
his magic with him) that builds through  the layers of emotion. Kate has become
a consummate artist at unifying her music  with her intended effect -- working
gradually to a point where she introduces the  Trio Bulgarka, first in the
background then sifting the music in beautiful and  strange harmony. 
</P>
<P>The hight point of the album comes near the end the the triumphant outcry of
 &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;, simply one of the most moving, wild rides any rock
musician has  ever produced. It made hair stand up on the back of my neck, and
is such a stunning  mesh of voices, banshee guitar, unnamable and
indistinguishable sounds that I  couldn't even tell you what the lyrics are.
Fortunately, Kate has placed lower key  songs at the end of the album to wind
you down for a return to earth, like &quot;This  Woman's Work&quot;, the typical
Bush piano ballad which was featured in the John  Hughes film &quot;She's Having
A Baby.&quot; Other songs of note include &quot;Heads We're  Dancing,&quot; and
the ballad of the lonely computer addict &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot; 
which also features the Trio Bulgarka. 
</P>
<P>As usual, Kate's lyrics are richly poetic and personal. THE SENSUAL WORLD is
 spacious, full of light, but burdened with darkness, exhibiting a dimension and
power  that show Kate's synthesis of all her past work and her interest in
classical and  ethnic music and the influences of the great rock musicians. You
are going to need  three copies of THE SENSUAL WORLD: one to give to your best
friend, one to  listen to, and one to replace it with when your first wears out.

<P>Date: Mon, 20 Nov 89 00:14:03 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: December issue of Musician magazine 
</P>
<P>First of all, there's a very favorable review of the album in the December
issue  of Musician magazine. Since this magazine is fairly widely available in
the US, I will  only quote a few lines from it: 
</P>
<P>&quot;All it takes is a single listening of The Sensual World to understand
why it's  been four years since Kate Bush released an album; a song cycle as
rich and deep as  this takes a while to mature.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Well, suffice to say that nearly every line of this review says something
good  about the album. If anyone needs to see the entire review, please e-mail
me. 
</P>
<P>Kate's mentioned a couple of other times in this issue as well. There's an
article  about the Innocence Mission, in which the writer says, &quot;Kate Bush
on Valium might  sound like this.. .&quot; 
</P>
<P>Next, from the Oct. 28 issue of Melody Maker : 
</P>
<P>Our Price, which I now know to be a chain of British record stores, has a
full  page ad promoting The Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>There's an interview of Nigel Kennedy, the classical violinist who has
played on  some of Kate's tracks. Here's an excerpt: 
</P>
<P>&quot;EMI Classical's rising star, who won a gold disc and the BPI Classical
Record Of  The Year Award for his Elgar Violin Concerto, and has just gone
straight into the  album chart, at number 43, with his recording of Vivaldi's &quot;Four
Seasons&quot; [this could  never happen in America], has also played on albums
by Talk Talk, Paul McCartney,  Judie Tzuke and has been working with Kate Bush
on the long awaited follow-up to  'The Hounds of Love', 'The Sensual World'.&quot;

</P>
<P>Then, later in the interview: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kennedy makes no secret of his intense admiration for Kate Bush and
the two  have been close friends ever since he worked with her on 'Experiment
IV'. This  time around, he contributed to two tracks on 'The Sensual World'. 
</P>
<P>&quot;'She's just a great musician, so inspired in her attitude to music. I
think she's  one of the greatest composers of the century in my opinion. That's
another type of  music that relates to my way of thinking. You can call it
classical, whatever, it just  takes in influences from all over. The main song I
played on was &quot;The Fog&quot;, where I  played the counter melody to her
vocal. I also did chord banks on another song --  &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;.
We did it in her own 48-track studio. It was all acoustic. I  think it's about
the best studio sound I've ever had -- her boyfriend Del is a great  engineer.'&quot;

</P>
<P>That's it for now, folks.

<BR> Subject: KaTe review from MUSICIAN, SPIN 
</P>
<P>Two new reviews recently came to my attention, the first in SPIN magazine 
(which I refuse to re-post because I may bust a vein if I read it again) which 
basically accuses Kate of being an outmoded &quot;sex kitten&quot; type, which
has no place in  music. Of course he doesn't make any mention of all the other
artists that use sex  much more blatantly (if you can accuse Kate of &quot;using
sex&quot; at all) to sell their  &quot;music&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The other review was quite good, from the latest issue of MUSICIAN magazine:

</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>All it takes is a single listening to of The Sensual World to understand why
it's  been four years since Kate Bush released an album; a song cycle as rich
and deep as  this takes a while to mature. An overnight sensation who became a
star at the age of  19, Bush, now 31, has proven herself an artist whose vision
yields new and  unexpected rewards with each record, and she executes several
stunning turns on  this, her sixth LP. Her original use of rhyme and meter, the
wide frame of  reference she draws from as a composer and her inventive and
fearless approach to  singing fall into perfect sync on nearly every song. 
</P>
<P>Often dismissed as self-consciously precious, Bush counters that criticism
here  with 11 songs of such wisdom and poetry that only the most hardened cynic
would  write them off as conceits. Centering on the eternal struggle between
male and  female, the album kicks off with a title track inspired by James
Joyce's Ulysses. A  celebration of the idea of giving oneself over and embracing
all that life  offers--textures, tastes, experiences--&quot;The Sensual World&quot;
is an extraordinaryily  erotic song, and Bush's breathless vocal style perfectly
complements the theme. Next  up is &quot;Love and Anger,&quot; an anthem of
faith in the notion that, despite the  overwhelming fear that pervades the
planet earth, human beings are capable of  knowing and being known by one
another. &quot;The Fog&quot; explores that theme further  by celebrating the
leap of faith that love demands, while &quot;Reaching Out&quot; looks at  how
we're instinctively drawn to both danger and comfort. Every track on the  album
offers something different to think about, and Bush's point of view on the 
subject at hand is usually as smart as it is sweepingly emotional. 
</P>
<P>An atmospheric, ambitiously produced tapestry of sound, The Sensual World
has  a massive, orchestral quality about it (one number [sic] features backup
vocals by the  Trio Bulgarka--in case you missed it, Bulgarian folk is the hot
ethnic music of the  moment). Despite the alaborate trimmings, Bush's music
remains profoundly  human, earthy and moving. Her songs seem too reside in that
waking dream state  where deeply rooted fears and desires intermingle with the
concrete reality known  as the world; as painted by Bush, that place is the
essence of life itself. -- Kristine  McKenna

<BR> Subject: Kate on VH-1 Dec. 12 
</P>
<P> The other day I received a complimentary copy of some T.V. Guide clone
called  Cable Guide. Inside they had a section of highlights for the month. On
the page for  Variety they had a picture of Kate (sitting on her legs. Black
sleeveless top and blue  jeans. A background pattern of orange &amp; yellow.)
Underneath was the caption  &quot;VH-1 feels the pull of the Bush&quot; and
below it said KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>&quot;You may not know her, but Bush is a musical genius who weaves the
stuff of  myth, sex, and magic into marvelous songs with irresistible beats.
VH-1, 12th. (Dec.)&quot; 
</P>
<P>The guy who wrote that must be a fan. Since &quot;pull of the bush&quot;
isn't a song title  but rather an obscure (although highly dramatic) line and
clever pun, he must be  quite familiar with her work. What's more, you wouldn't
describe her as a musical  genius to people who've never heard of her unless you
really believed it. Maybe the  show will really be good.

</P>
<P>Here's the review of the album from the November 20/20, a slick British arts
 magazine: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: 'The Sensual World' EMI 
</P>
<P>1985's 'The Hounds Of Love' tranformed Kate Bush from mildly charismatic pop
 curio to fully-blown eccentric genius. 'The Sensual World' is more readily 
accessible (no side-long thematic suites in the vein of 'The Ninth Wave'), its
ten  songs mostly working within a conventional format, the faster moments in
the vein  of 'Big Sky' and 'Cloudbusting'. But when the pace slows, the music
becomes  more beautifully indulgent. The opeining title track will already be
familiar, having  entered the charts at number 12 in the first week of release,
and as soon as Kate  sings the opening line 'When I take the kiss of seedcake
right from his mouth' you  know this is going to be the maladjusted, lunatic
adventure of her career. 
</P>
<P>From that dizzy start, the album proceeds from on delirious swoon to
another:  'Never Be Mine' and 'This Woman's Work' echo 'The Man With The Child
In  His Eyes', ricocheting with soulful, Marvin Gaye-ish abandon. 'Reaching Out'
and  'Deeper Understanding' mine the familiar, swirly vein that we've come to
expect,  but Kate never plays to the crowds: 'The Fog' is another matter
entirely, using two  chords to spark up a snowstorm in your head. The Beatles
may have been bigger  than Jesus, but Kate Bush is sexier.

<P>Kate Bush, The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World is the sixth album from Kate Bush. It is her most personal
 and confident release to date. Recorded at Kate's own studio in Kent, England
it  includes many acclaimed guest musicians. Especially interesting is the title
track  which incororates the haunting sound of Davey Spilane's Uilean pipes
alongside  Kate's unique voice. It's been a four year wait since the last Kate
Bush album but  her vocal style is as intriguing as always. She produces quality
-- not quantity and  her fans know it is well worth the wait.

<P>Date: Sun, 3 Dec 89 20:14:37 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Request 
</P>
<P>A review of the album from the December Request, the in-store magazine of 
Musicland and Sam Goody. The review is generally favorable, but it ends on a
sour  note that I must comment upon. 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>SENSUAL WORLD (COLUMBIA) 
</P>
<P>Back when the rest of Britainnia writhed in the throes of punk, a precocious
 16-year-old Kate Bush was harboring images of a mythic Victorian England in
which  arcane literature was savored in the privacy of carefully tended gardens.
Visions of  midnight moors and star-crossed lovers danced in her head as she
recorded her 1978  debut, &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; a breathless single
that promptly went to No. 1 on the  English pop charts. Afraid of flying and
reluctant to tour, she outfitted her charmed  world with a home studio, a
musical sanctuary where her increasingly elaborate  recordings could take shape
without outside interference. 
</P>
<P>Surprisingly, Bush's relative seclusion over the years has coincided with an
 expanding musical vision, much as a cloistered child might explore exotic
worlds  armed only with some musty tomes and an overactive imagination. Albums
like The  Dreaming and Hounds of Love layered rhythms and electronic samples
over epic song  structures, parelleling similar inclinations in the work of her
friend and occasional  collaborator, Peter Gabriel. The Sensual World, Bush's
first album in four years,  tempers those experimental inclinations with the
more straightforward pop  sensibilities of her first three albums. Pink Floyd's
David Gilmour and Bulgaria's  Trio Bulgarka lend helping hands on several cuts,
the most impressive of which is  &quot;Rocket's Tail.&quot; The track starts out
as an a capella number and expands into a  full-blown rocker, as the throaty
quavering Eastern European voices release Bush  from her Victorian inhibitions
into a state of expressionist frenzy. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World also includes the suitably Celtic title cut (inspired, as
it was, by  Joyce's Ulysses ), the exhilarating &quot;Walk Straight Down The
Middle&quot; (on CD and  cassette), and the contemplative &quot;Never Be Mine.&quot;
Together, they showcase Bush's  intricate melodies, imaginative keyboards (a lot
more piano this time around), and  sweet mock-operatic vocal stylings.
Occasionally a cloyingly pretentious cut like &quot;The  Fog&quot; effectively
breaks the spell cast by most of The Sensual World. It's the kind of 
self-indulgence that suggests our heroine may be spending a bit too much time in
 the garden with her precious books. -- Bill Forman 
</P>
<P>The following reviews of &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; all appeared in the
November 25  issues of these magazines. 
</P>
<P>From New Musical Express : 
</P>
<P>The whole story of this song should guarantee sentimental naffness. Is it
possible  through pop to truly represent the emotions of a young man stranded in
the waiting  room while his lover's life is threatened by the birth of their
baby? I think not.  Unless you're Kate Bush. Oh, how I want her to have my
children! 
</P>
<P>  -- Len Brown 
</P>
<P>From Melody Maker : 
</P>
<P>A luscious, spiritually elevating, showstopper/ballad from the artnymph of
the  aureoles, who's surely never done a day's work in her life. How does anyone
get  that much cool air into a voice? Sort of &quot;The Man With The Child In
His Eyes&quot; as  interpreted by Leonara Carrington [who?]. Ecstatic with
wintry tragedy. So  undeniably beauteous that for me to sell it further would be
heresy. Quietly, one  does wish she'd released &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;, but
maybe that's next. Heaven's Kate. 
</P>
<P>  -- Chris Roberts 
</P>
<P>From Sounds : 
</P>
<P>Hardly a commercial sound, although it's already seen daylight on the
soundtrack  for She's Having A Baby. It's a bit profound for a John Hughes flick
-- the line &quot;Oh  darling just make it go away&quot; is a heartbreaker
coming from a young woman  experiencing motherhood for the first time -- and
orchestrated to buggery by the  fussy Michael Kamen. On the B-side, with &quot;thanks
to Nicolas Roeg&quot;, is 'Be Kind To  My Mistakes', a song from Castaway. This
is even less commercial, a sort of jungle  melodrama with hints at tension.
These two sides smack of complete disregard for  the Top 40. Good on her.

<P>Date: Sat, 9 Dec 89 13:24:43 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Dance Music Report 
</P>
<P>Once again I found a wonderful review of the album. This one is in, of all
things,  Dance Music Report, published in New York. It's from the Nov. 19 - Dec.
1 issue.  Here it is: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; (Columbia 44164) 
</P>
<P>Produced by Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>Now I come from England and over there Kate Bush has been huge since her 
first album, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; spawned a number one single called &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot;. She went on to make more albums -- &quot;Lionheart&quot;, &quot;Never
For Ever&quot;, &quot;The  Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; --which
got more individual and experimental as she  went along. Nobody has ever sounded
like Kate -- for easy reference maybe she  could be considered a female Peter
Gabriel. But I'm only saying that cos in the US  she has enjoyed little more
than a large cult. And the reason has to be that this  remarkable artist, who
operates within her own world and time-scale, is quite  possibly *too* unique
and, yes, &quot;far out&quot;, for the safe, predictable world of the  American
radio-dominated robo-punter. But take the time and there is a  treasure-trove of
delights and brilliant music to be found in Kate's finely-crafted  music. 
</P>
<P>And so to &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, more than three years in the making
and as  intriguing, intoxicating, inspiring and individual as anything she's
done before.  Where Kate's first three LPs were finding her feet and made on a
rush of  overnight acclaim, the last three have taken a lot of time and effort
to produce -- by  the time the 80s bow out there will only have been four Kate
Bush albums. [I think  he means that she'll have put out four albums during the
80s, including TWS .] And  that's the way it has to be -- every cut is composed
by Kate with her piano (and  later synth), then sculpted into shape in the
studio using suitable musicians for each  cut. 
</P>
<P>Whereas &quot;Hounds&quot; was half-composed of an ambitious side-long suite
and,  contrastingly, cuts like &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and &quot;Big
Sky&quot;, which made great  singles, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is ten
perfectly-crafted tracks which range from her  gorgeously-textured mid-tempo
stuff like the aptly-named title cut to Kate's  trademark heart-stroking
ballads. Only the title cut, with its &quot;mmh, yes&quot; vocal hook  and the
distinctive tones of the traditional Irish Uillean pipes, seems to be an obvious
 single (and it is). Never does this remarkable lady pander to any trend or
anybody to  take the easy out. Each album is a labour of love, a single entity
with its own  character. The mood on this one is quite subdued, lush,
densely-textured with much  use of ancient instruments (long a specialty of her
brother Paddy, who plays on the  record). 
</P>
<P>The single opens the LP, followed by the gradually-building tension of &quot;Love
And  Anger&quot;, the closest thing to the last album with its mass-chorale and
impassioned  vocal. The first truly breath-taking moments come with &quot;The
Fog&quot;, a misty,  atmospheric floater which seems to deal with growing up and
the love of family. A  predominance on violin and cello (plus orchestra) give
the cut a rich texture like an  aural painting of the last century using 90s
technology. It's completely beautiful --  and Kate's doctor dad makes a cameo! &quot;Reaching
Out&quot; is the kind of at-the-piano  ballad she excells at, which again harks
back to childhood emotion. Great strings.  &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot; takes
a step back to World War 2 with its evocative lyrics  and could be the next
single as Kate establishes a groove which is exotically  percussive and
electronically-boosted at the same time. 
</P>
<P>Side Two kicks off with &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, a quite sinister
tale of  computer infatuation-then-madness. It's the first of three cuts with
the amazing  Trio Bulgarka, three Bulgarian women who contribute soaring,
emotive harmonies  and lift the cuts they're involved to another dimension
altogether. &quot;Between A Man  And A Woman&quot; is a dense, multi-layered
pulse with an atmosphere of magic and  mysticism. &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;
brings back The Trio to sing out their hearts behind a  stomach-clasping ballad
of lost love. 
</P>
<P>The most &quot;normal&quot; cut is &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;, with guitar by
Pink Floyd's Dave  Gilmour (who produced the original demos by a 16-year-old
Kate Bush in the early  70s). Well, not *that* normal. It begins with Kate and
the Trio beseesching half the  words a capella before the band lurches in to let
Mr. Gilmour wail away as he is  wont to do over a Floyd-ish plod. The subject
matter appears to concern a guy intent  on impersonating a rocket by dressing up
in a pointed hat, silver suit with a firework  back-pack -- he lands in the
drink. 
</P>
<P>This stunning set bows out with my favourite cut, &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;,
just  Kate and her piano (backed by a tasteful orchetra) pouring out a
melancholy ode to  lost love and loneliness. It kind of evokes &quot;Don't Give
Up&quot;, the heartbreaking duet  she did with Peter Gabriel in '86. Kate's
fragile strength is at its peak here and I  love it. 
</P>
<P>Obviously there will be singles pulled off this album, maybe even given
dance  remixes, but it's this LP that's Kate's masterpiece and one of the best
things she's  done. -- Kris Needs

<P>Date: Mon, 11 Dec 89 13:00:57 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: From the Modern Rock News 
</P>
<P>Because of all my letters and phone calls to KITS over the course of the
past year,  they put me on their mailing list. Every month I get a four-page
long newsletter  called the Modern Rock News. One page is always an ad, two
pages are news about  the station and short notes about artists, and one page is
always an article about an  artist the station is featuring. Well, I just got
the December issue, and the featured  artist is -- you guessed it -- Kate! 
</P>
<P>I suspect that they simply transcribed a Columbia press release; that's what
it  reads like. But here it is: 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush was born in Bexley, Kent, England, on July 30, 1958. Her father,
an  avid spare time piano player, and mother, an Irish woman who takes much joy
in  music and dancing, raised Kate and her two older brothers with an open mind
to  artistic experiments. 
</P>
<P>Kate began violin lessons (reluctantly) around the age of nine but took a 
passionate interest in the piano. The day after her father showed her the scale
of C,  Kate became a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>As a result of a three-track demo, organized and financed by Pink Floyd's
Dave  Gilmour, Kate was signed to EMI before leaving school. Accepting a modest
advance  from EMI, she was able to concentrate full time on expanding her
catalogue of  songs. Kate also continued her dance studies, which were initially
inspired, and later  taught, by theatrical mime-master Lindsay Kemp. They would
prove invaluable later  on with the dawning age of video. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd wanted to make a record more than anything else,&quot; Kate
remembers. Her  ambition was achieved in mid-1977 with the recording of her
debut album, The Kick  Inside. Her first single &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot;
became a #1 single in the U.K. It was  followed by the album, which rapidly sold
over one million copies in the U.K. alone. 
</P>
<P>The pressure was on to make and release a second album. But when Kate 
realized her recording schedule had to be fitted around promotional demands all 
over the continent, she vowed to exercise much more control over her career in
the  future. Nonetheless, the Lionheart album came out in December '78 and a
decision  to tour was finalized. 
</P>
<P>Thirty odd dates took place in Britain and Europe during the spring of '79.
Every  show was a sellout and the two and a half hours of music, dance, mime and
magic  defied critics' expectations. But the rigors exhausted Kate to such an
extent she's  never been able to seriously contemplate the idea of another tour.

</P>
<P>Then came the five and a half minute single, &quot;Breathing,&quot; which
championed  Green issues back on 1980, and marked a major change in the
expectations of Kate  Bush's many observers. The single entitled &quot;Babooshka&quot;
was followed in September  by a new album, Never for Ever. Here was vinyl
confirmation that Kate had much to  offer for the often bland world of pop. 
</P>
<P>&quot; The Dreaming album was so difficult to make,&quot; says Kate of her
next record.  &quot;Just about everything that could go wrong did during that
period.&quot; With studio  problems and her method of working and the cost
involved, she decided to upgrade  her own demo studio to a professional
recording level. 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, critics were left to ponder the merits of an album that had
yielded  &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; and the title track as singles. In fact,
The Dreaming added  considerably to the Kate Bush fan base between its release
and that of Hounds of  Love exactly three years later. 
</P>
<P>Hounds of Love quickly established itself as Kate's most successful album to
date  both in a commercial and critical sense. It was the first to give her real
chart success  in America, htting the top 30 in 1985 (as did the &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; single). The  album was also the catalyst for several superb
videos, most memorably the one that  accompanied &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; which
starred Kate and Donald Sutherland -- one of  her favorite actors. 
</P>
<P>The Whole Story came next, the million-selling compilation album and video 
released late in 1986. Both formats charted high amongst the best-selling titles
that  year. [In the UK, that is.] Kate's videos, many of which are directed by
her, are  almost as popular as her records. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I know it's taken a long time but each record gets harder to make,&quot;
she says,  explaining the four-year gap between the albums, Hounds of Love and
The Sensual  World. &quot;This is my most personal and female album so far. I
particularly wanted  'The Sensual World' as the first single because I feel it
is a strong expression of  positive female energy.&quot;

<P> Cash Box has finally reviewed the album, in the Dec. 16 issue: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: The Sensual World (Columbia OCT 44164) 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush's influence can be heard in so many new acts that she should be 
receiving royalties. Ethereal vocals, literate, provocative lyrics and an
unforced  sexiness that almost always catches the listener slightly off guard,
so powerful and  potent is that element of her work. All those characteristics
are in full force on  World, Bush's first release in three years and a timely
reminder of one of the  biggest talents, male or female, of this decade. Whereas
she was once awfully  pretentious (appealing, interesting and full of promise,
but pretentious nonetheless),  her talents have ripened so that the gap between
what she hears in her head and  what we, the audience, finally hear are, if not
in perfect sync, then at least on the  same wavelength. No longer do you say, &quot;Well,
I know the effect she's *after*.&quot; The  emotional and social terrains
covered on this album are among the richest and most  ambitious of this year,
and are wholly satisfying. The track &quot;This Woman's Work,&quot;  originally
featured on the soundtrack to She's Having a Baby and now available as a  single
on import, should turn up on several critic's lists as one of the best of the
year,  if not the decade. The same could be said of the album. -- Ernest Hardy

<P>Richard Cook on Kate Bush et al. 
</P>
<P>Sex isn't what it used to be, in popular music as everywhere else. Singers
bill and  coo more explicitly than ever before, but today's pillow-talk is
either the phallic  conceits of rap of the professional lip-smack of a new
generation of disco tarts. It's  as depressing as anything else that has to be
fetched off the top shelf. No wonder  that the return of Kate Bush, often pinned
up as a thinking man's strumpet, has  brought forth a gush of enthusiastic copy
from sensitive music writers. It's  understandable. This is like getting your
hands on a Henry Miller after toiling  through a trunkful of exploitation. 
</P>
<P>Actually the inspiration behind &quot;The Sensual World&quot; (EMI), or at
least the title  song, is James Joyce. The song refurbishes Molly Bloom as a pop
goddess, and with  it's swirl of pipes and synthesisers around the repeated cue
of Bush's 'mmm-yes',  the music takes on some of the giddy excitement which
marks the best of her work.  It's a trick which she has trouble in pulling off.
Most of her songs shudder under  the weight of ingredients. If it weren't for
Bush's fruity soprano, delivering some of  the most exaggerated vowel sounds
this side of Al Jolson, the LPs could be the work  of some refugee from the
rarified climes of art-rock: Jon Anderson, say. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot;, though, aims to concoct yet another
world-music for our  pan-continental palates, as well as imparting a 'feminine
statement' (note to  feminists: this is not what you're thinking). The Bulgarian
singers Trio Bulgarka,  world music's answer to The Beverly Sisters, warble away
on three tracks, while  Kate ululates through lyrics about a woman and her
computer, meeting Adolf Hitler  at a Saturday dance and so on. In spite of all
that, it's a pretty record, melodies  peering through the jumble sale of musics
which seem to turn up on most 'serious'  rock records at present. Bush's
persona, though, grows increasingly like some  scatterbrained Home Counties
postmistress who's had one too many sherries at the  WI function and starts
spouting Blake. Her perennial complaint is of being seen as a  sex kitten with
brains, but it's difficult to sympathise with any conviction. Launching  a
record at the Top Ten which has the singer talking about her breasts and
'feeling  his spark grow in my hand' might be a shot at getting
real-capitol-P-Poetry on to  Radio 1. It's still going to end up as sex therapy
for unrequited fans. 
</P>
<P>I imagine there are, so far, no plans for &quot;The Sensual World&quot; to
be covered by  Linda Ronstadt. It seems bizzare to recall that Ronstadt was once
considered the  raunchiest thing on two white legs in American rock. After a
bunch of dreary  standards with Nelson Riddle arrangements, her return to her
roots on &quot;Cry Like A  Rainstorm - Howl Like The Wind&quot; (ELEKTRA) is
about as sex-charged as a sniff at  a Milk of Magnesia bottle. Ronstadt remains
America's sweetheart so she's lucky  that she doesn't have to get by on the
quality of the music, which is flabby with  orchestras and bad guitarists. It
makes me wonder if she ever looks twice at the song  on the stand: Jimmy Webbs
'I Kept It Hid', once superbly recorded by Glen  Campbell, should end with a
quiet shrug of the shoulders, but Ronstadt gives it the  full emotional
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>Pop-sex is still most successfully handled by gentle, allusive words and
music, and  the best performer in that style is the Canadian songwriter, Jane
Siberry. She is  painfully thin and wears a pointed, Jack Frost face. Her new
record, &quot;Bound By The  Beauty&quot; (REPRISE), is more or less thrilling in
its ingenuity and capriciousness - at  one point, she does a piece called
'Everything Reminds Me Of My Dog' - and it  ends with two songs, 'Miss Punta
Blanca' and 'Are We Dancing Now', which swim  in all the sensual charm and
secrecy which Kate Bush splashes desperately after.  She's also very funny. I'll
give you that name again: Jane Siberry.

<P>Vickie here. This appeared in the Washington Post. Hope no one has posted it

<P> SINGER-SONGWRITERS WITH STUDIO'D GRACE 
</P>
<P>The photographer Diane Arbus, who made a brilliant career of capturing the 
essences of unusual people, had an insight into eccentricity, &quot;If that word
as too  double an edge,&quot; Arbus wrote, &quot;we could use some others: the
anomalies, the  quixotic, the dedicated, who believe in the impossible, who make
their mark on  themselves,
who-if-you-were-going-to-meet-them-for-the-first-time-would-have- 
no-need-of-a-carnation-in-their-buttonhole.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That pretty twisty definition might well suit such contemporary 
singer-songwriter-musicians as Jane Siberry, Kate Bush and the extraordinary 
newcomer Mary Margaret O'Hara, who are foremost among a growing group of  women
wielding the triple threat of studio finesse, a range of concerns far beyond 
the &quot;love song, and a concomitant disregard for conventional commerciality.
Each has  a sound and a poetic voice so personal, you might feel you'd recognize
her on the  street after hearing her records.

</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: 
</P>
<P>'THE SENSUAL WORLD' 
</P>
<P>A teenage prodigy discovered by Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour, British 
thrush Kate Bush moved from the sensual and occasionally brilliant boudoir 
concerns of her 1978 debut &quot;The Kick Inside,&quot; to the ambitious (what
other word for  a pop record that opens with a paraphrase of James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses?&quot;)
 self-produced techno-expertise &quot;The Sensual World&quot; (Columbia). It's
her sixth  album and first since 1985's &quot;Hounds Of Love.&quot; which
introduced her to American  audiences. 
</P>
<P>Though she's gained a reputation for highly theatrical videos and vivid
stage  performances, Bush is a reclusive studio obsessive, and except for her
duet with  Peter Gabriel on his &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; single, she's been all
but invisible for the past  several years as she's tinkered with &quot;The
Sensual World&quot; in her home studio in  London. 
</P>
<P>With its swoony swoops and flourishes, and given her tendency toward acting 
every color and character in her populous songs about erotic instinct, Bush's
voice is  lovely, but arguably an aquired taste. Here she plays against a
musical backdrop more  lushly baroque than ever, an audio world tour crammed
with special effects. Bush  plays assorted Fairlights, DX7s and just plain
pianos here, and her sidemen include  guitarist Gilmour, who places a slowly
uncoiling solo at the center of &quot;Love and  Anger.&quot; An early proponent
of world music (Gabriel's influence rubbing off?), Bush  taps into the Bulgarian
trend and employs the metallic harmonies of the Trio  Bulgarka on three songs,
and visited Dublin to flavor several tracks with Celtic harps  and uilleann
pipes.

<P>The Jan/Feb issue of Option has a review of the album, and it's pretty good:

</P>
<P>KATE BUSH: The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Over the years Bush's voice has matured from a fingernails-on-a-chalkboard 
shrillness to a finely controlled instrument with amazing vibrato, falsetto and 
sustaining capabilities. These eleven new songs (one cassette/CD only) are
perhaps  the most personal of Bush's career. This album is somewhat of a
celebration of  sensuality; omnipotent carnal images mingle with submerged
Freudian suggestions  and Bush's personal revelations. Uniting Celtic
instrumentation with modern  technology (Bush is a studio wizard and a master
with synth-sequencing gadgetry)  and utilizing the likes of Bulgaria's Trio
Bulgarka and uillean pipist Davey Spillane,  she's taken on some heady yet
intimate subject matter. 
</P>
<P>The opener (said to have been inspired by Joyce's Ulysses ) embraces the
erotic  world of flesh, sex, and love with its lusty rhythms and
Celtic-mid-eastern accents.  &quot;The Fog&quot; and &quot;Reaching Out&quot;
explore childhood, adolescence, and separation ripe  with earthy images and
bodily metaphors. &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; is hopelessly romantic in  its
self-realization that the dream of love is often more powerful than the reality.
 The melody lines, hooks, and bittersweet delivery here find Bush at her most 
approachable; the most immediately memorable, soothing song of her career. The 
Sensual World is clearly the work of a matured artist at the top of her form.
