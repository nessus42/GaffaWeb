    <P>Did anyone else wonder about the significance of Terry Wogan's final
      words before introducing the guest following KaTe? </P>
    
    <P>He roughly said (paraphrased from memory!): </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I know someone who'll be particularly pleased to see KaTe and
      that's Hanna. She always watches the show, particularly when KaTe is on.
      Hello Hanna and get well soon!&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Who else could it be but KaTe's mum? Let's hope all is well at East
      Wickham Farm. </P>

    <P>Sadly, Kate's mother Hannah Bush passed away on Valentine's Day. [Febr.
      14th] </P>
    
    <P>The cause of death has not been released to the public. Cards and
      flowers may be sent to East Wickham Farm in Welling, Kent. </P>
    
    <P>A suggestion (not made by the family, but by me) would be to donate a
      little something to your favorite charity, or to Kate's favorite charity,
      The Terrence Higgins Trust in London, in Hannah's name. The family is in
      seclusion and are not giving any interviews. </P>
    
    <P>This information comes directly from Kate's friend Lisa (KBC), via Peter
      and Krys at Homeground. </P>
    
    <P>I hope there won't be a lot of speculation about how much this might
      delay Kate's album and tour. Obviously, they will be delayed, but we must
      respect Kate's grief and mourning period and know that it is more
      important than any material items we might be waiting for. </P>
    
    <P>It's a sad, sad day for all who care about Kate and her family. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Hannah Bush quotes </P>
    
    <P> As usual, I find that Kate says things better then I ever could: </P>
    
    <P>WHAT'S BEEN THE LOWEST POINT IN YOUR LIFE? </P>
    
    <P>In my life! The worst moments are when I've lost people that have meant
      something to me, when people have died. They're definitely the worst
      moments. It's probably just the selfish feelings of why you miss a person.
      You want them to be with you again, you want them more and they're not
      there. [MAKES OK SIGN] Because probably where they've gone, they're really
      having a good time. It you want to look at it, death, in a way, should be
      looked on as the greatest thing that's ever going to happen to you. (1980,
      Profiles In Rock) </P>
    
    <P> DO YOU COME FROM A PARTICULARLY ARTISTIC FAMILY? </P>
    
    <P>Well, my mother's a dancer, she won a lot of prizes cleaning the floor
      with the opposition, and my father's a musician. (1981, RM) </P>
    
    <P> I don't know if it was a dream or not, but I remember somebody looking
      over into my cot going something like &quot;googgy wooogy woogy wooo&quot;.
      I might have been one, maybe two years old. </P>
    
    <P>My father was a doctor and my mother a nurse. Now she works on the phone
      for my father, taking calls. (1982, Flexipop) </P>
    
    <P> PADDY, MAYBE YOU'D GIVE A QUICK SKETCH OF YOUR CAREER AS A MUSICIAN
      PRIOR TO YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH YOUR SISTER. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Well, I suppose it all started off initially because there's
      always been so much music in our family. Our mother comes from a very
      musical family, all her brothers, i.e. our uncles, played on accordians
      and fiddles and stuff. So music was something we were always exposed to as
      young kids and we were always hearing Irish dance music, which has been
      very special to me ever since. (1985, Kate Bush Con) </P>
    
    <P>My mother's Irish and she always had relatives popping around, the vast
      majority of whom were superb musicians. They'd come around and play
      accordions and things. (1989, Pulse) </P>
    
    <P> My mother, to whom I have always been very close also, was a muse. But
      my eye was almost always on what my father was up to. Don't you think
      that, as a child, your aspirations are into the world? </P>
    
    <P>You take the whole domestic situation, including your mother, for
      granted. Little did I know it was mum who was holding it all together.
      (1989, You) </P>
    
    <P>An engineer we were working with picked out the line in &quot; And Dream
      of Sheep &quot; that says &quot;Come here with me now.&quot; I asked him
      why he liked it so much. He said, &quot;I don't know, I just love it. It's
      so moving and comforting.&quot; I don't think he even knew what was being
      said exactly, but the song is about someone going to sleep in the water,
      where they're alone and frightened. And they want to go to sleep, to get
      away from the situation. But at the same time it's dangerous to go to
      sleep in water, you could drown. </P>
    
    <P>When I was little, and I'd had a bad dream, I'd go into my parents'
      bedroom round to my mother's side of the bed. She'd be asleep, and I
      wouldn't want to wake her, so I'd stand there and wait for her to sense my
      presence and wake up. She always did, within minutes; and sometimes I'd
      frighten her - standing there still, in the darkness in my nightdress. I'd
      say, &quot;I've had a bad dream,&quot; and she'd lift bedclothes and say
      something like &quot;Come here with me now.&quot; It's my mother saying
      this line in the track, and I briefed her on the ideas behind it before
      she said it. And I think it's the motherly comfort that this engineer
      picked up on. In fact, he said this was his favourite part of the album.
      (1987, KBC 21) </P>
    
    <P>HANNAH: We always encouraged Kate to write songs, but we never thought,
      we never dreamed, it would all turn out like this. We're very proud of
      her, naturally, but hasn't it all happened very suddenly? The doorbell's
      ringing all the time now from fans who want autographs. I have to collect
      them up and give them to Kate to sign. </P>
    
    <P>I worry about Kate at times, but she's a very stable girl and always
      seems to know what she's doing. She hasn't become affected in the
      slightest. (1978, Bush-Whacked!) </P>
    
    <P>HANNAH BUSH: [inaudible] Oh, in the show. I like her in all of it
      actually, the quality, her performance, and her stamina. </P>
    
    <P>HANNAH: Stamina, yes. I mean her stamina is fantastic. I mean she had to
      go on... We're very proud of that. [Taps Kate on the shoulder] Very
      professional, uh huh, isn't she? (1979, Kate Bush In Concert) </P>

      <BR> Subject: Noting the occasion </P>
    
    <P> Many thanks to Vickie for her gracious and thoughtful effort in passing
      along the sad news of Mrs. Bush's death this month. Most of the time we're
      fans of Kate Bush here, but now we need to be her friends too, meaning
      that we recognize how very distant and incidental we are to her and her
      family at a time like this. Vickie's suggestion about gifts to charities
      the family respects is an excellent one. </P>
    
    <P>I would not be surprised if Ron Hill is already compiling a post from &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;
      containing Kate's remarks about her mother. We know the Bush family are
      very close, and as bystanders can only be grateful that they have that
      strength among themselves at this time. </P>
    
    <P>Hannah Bush appears quite unmistakably in the video for &quot;Suspended
      in Gaffa,&quot; but I believe that she is also in the video for &quot;The
      Big Sky.&quot; This hypothesis was a novelty for the group of us at Larry
      Hernandez's place in San Jose last Katemas, and after running through the
      passage in question frame by frame several times from the laserdisk, Ron
      Hill was still uncertain but Andy Marvick seemed to agree. Having checked
      it again just now, I am as confident as ever. </P>
    
    <P>The moment comes exactly two minutes into the video, when Kate has
      sidestepped forward through the ranks of hero figures, and the camera
      rises higher and dollies back along them. In the middle of the two files
      of heroes stands a short mature woman in an aviator cap, and at the
      instant her face (looking straight into the camera) is centered in the
      frame it is lit by bright light from the left, and it simply looks clear
      as day to me that this is Hannah Bush. </P>
    
    <P>It is so characteristic of Kate Bush that she would find opportunity in
      her work to introduce her family to us, and us to her family. </P>

    <P>I can't help but put a personal note in here, I *don't* want to start a
      flame war, but I have to say this... </P>
    
    <P>I hope those who hate the song &quot;Reaching Out&quot; will listen to
      it with Kate's mom in mind, and will feel a bit kinder toward it. I'm not
      asking you to like it, but just feel some of the mother/daughter
      connection, and try to understand where she's coming from. I've posted
      before about how much I love that song, one of the reasons being that I
      lost my own mother 10 years ago, and the emotions in the song hit me very
      deeply. Knowing, from many different sources, how close Kate and her
      mother were, I can imagine that Kate is absolutely devestated. I feel such
      sorrow and sadness for her. Songs such as RO and All the Love and others
      that involve her mother have become even more special in the last day. I'm
      so glad Kate used her mom in the videos of Suspended in Gaffa and The Big
      Sky, she'll always be preserved on video for those of us who never met
      her. </P>
    
    <P>Thank you Ron, for digging up those quotes. </P>

    <P>Great quotes Ron, thank you. </P>
    
    <P>There was one you missed, but I can't think of where it's from. </P>
    
    <P>Kate told a story about Hannah being ill when kate was a small child.
      Hannah had &quot;died&quot; and was having an out-of-body experience. She
      was up above her body, looking down on herself, when Kate came into the
      room. That &quot;forced&quot; her to re-enter her body and she was alive
      again. Now, even if people don't believe in that sort of thing, obviously
      Hannah and Kate did, or else Kate wouldn't have told the story. I wish I
      could remember where I read it... </P>

      <BR> Subject: Hannah Quotes #2 </P>
    
    <P> Due to an error on my part, and to the index to Cloudbusting not
      *QUITE* being finished, I neglected a few quotes. Thanks to Vickie for
      pointing this out. </P>
    
    <P>When I was little my mother fainted for no apparent reason. My father
      was there and put her on the bed, but he couldn't feel any pulse so he
      started doing artificial respiration and so on to try to revive her.
      Meanwhile, according to my mum, she'd taken off like a balloon and hit the
      ceiling. She was looking down from there at my father pushing her body
      about and she was calling out &quot;Leave me alone, I'm all right!&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>Then I walked in asking &quot;Where's my mum?&quot; and when she saw me
      she dropped down into her body, she says, anyway she did come back to
      life. (????, Secret History) </P>
    
    <P>AND DID THIS BEGIN TO ASSUME ALMOST PATHOLOGICAL PROPORTIONS AND START
      ALARMING THE FAMILY? </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Absolutely! </P>
    
    <P>KATE: Pathological! </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yeah! But no! Because of the heavy Irish tradition in the family,
      I think it was escapism on her part. Our mother is Irish and I think Kate
      maybe felt, you know, that there was a slight obligation to appease the
      Irish spirit. And somewhere out of my mother's imagination came the idea
      that Kate should learn the violin. It seems to be a tradition that the
      violin is forced upon people. I mean, there are few who take it up of
      their own volition! And Kate was certainly one of those who only took it
      up under pressure, she didn't really like it very much. So the piano was a
      kind of way of exploring music in dimensions diametrically opposite to
      what the violin must have represented to her. </P>
    
    <P>Escapism, pure escapism! You know, the command would be, &quot;go and
      practise on that violin, Kate,&quot; but the piano music came out instead!
      I think perhaps we Bushes are a bit like that... So yes, her piano playing
      was in the first place a direct reaction to straight music as we knew it,
      or as she knew it, at the time. The sort of style which she evolved in her
      piano playing and singing were direct opposites of all the kinds of
      straight music which she was being fed right then. Pure escapism, and very
      beautiful! (1985, Musician) </P>
    
    <P>I stay round my parents for a few hours - after all, you can't just go
      round, take all the clothes you want and rush off - drink lots of tea and
      eat chocolate eclairs and sandwiches, the sort of things that mothers like
      to fill you up with. I feel absolutely delightful after that, and I go
      back to start work on my routines for Tuesday. (1980, Flexipop Diary) </P>
    
    <P> The video of &quot; Suspended in Gaffa &quot; was to be done as simply
      and quickly as possible; as always with very little time to complete it
      in, the simpler the better. </P>
    
    <P>I saw it as being the return to simplicity, a light-hearted dance
      routine, no extras, no complicated special effects. [IN FACT, HOWEVER,
      THERE ARE MANY VERY SOPHISTICATED AND SUBTLE TECHNICAL EFFECTS IN THIS
      VIDEO, AND THE PRODUCTION DESIGN IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.] As we were all so
      pleased with the previous sets - put together under the supervision of a
      very clever man, Steve Hopkins - we asked him to build another, this time
      an old barn with large gaps in the walls where we could allow the light to
      streak through. We used a combination of natural and artificial light, and
      everyone was thrilled with the sense of realism that the set achieved.
    </P>
    
    <P>Steve brought in huge branches of trees that were behind the gaps in the
      set, and a dedicated helper called &quot;Podge&quot; sat up on a piece of
      scaffolding for six hours and enthusiastically shook a piece of tree to
      make the light move and dance as if motivated by a furtive wind. The video
      did remain uncomplicated - just a few effects and just one extra: but a
      very special one. There is one section where a child's voice says, &quot;Mother,
      where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes.&quot; And there was only
      one person that could be addressed to - my mother. </P>
    
    <P>When I asked her to appear in the section, contrary to my concern about
      her nerves, she was more than obliging and said, &quot;Yes.&quot; She was
      definitely the star of the day, and waited patiently hour after hour as we
      slowly moved through the bulk of the shooting to eventually reach her
      debut. I was amazed at her grace and stamina: as all of us began to wane
      and wilt, my mother continued to blossom and glow, and her only worries
      were getting back home in time to get dinner and hoping she would not
      succumb to an attack of giggles during the vital moments of being on
      screen. </P>
    
    <P>She needn't have worried, for she is a natural professional, a real star
      and my favourite mum. (You can see us together in action on the back
      page.) (1983, KBC 13) </P>

      <BR> Subject: Re: Hannah Bush quotes </P>
    
    <P>I think the it went along these lines: </P>
    
    <P>Hannah collapsed one day, and found herself at the ceiling looking down
      at Kate's father trying to resuscitate(sp?) her. She called out, &quot;Leave
      me alone, I'm OK&quot; (but nobody heard her, of course). When Kate came
      into the room, she returned to her body. Apparently this incident
      influenced &quot;Watching You Without Me&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>The question that springs to my mind is what did Hannah mean when she
      said she was ok? Did she mean that she knew it was only temporary, and she
      would be back, or did she mean that death wasn't a problem for her? If it
      was the latter, that thought may be of some comfort to Kate and her family
      right now. </P>

      <BR> Date: Wed, 26 Feb 1992 01:35:14 -0800
      <BR> Subject: Thoughts on Hannah </P>
    
    <P> What I've always found most inspiring about Kate has been that she is
      someone with great potential - that was realized. Whereas there are so
      many people out there with all types of potential that never is realized.
      No doubt one of the main reasons, perhaps the single greatest reason
      outside herself, that Kate was able to realize this potential so early and
      so powerfully was the influence and support of her mother. </P>
    
    <P>What is so sad to me about the passing of Kate's mother is that a large
      part of what made Kate what she is, and hence her music what it is, is now
      gone. Of course, the positive side of it is that that will live on, both
      in Kate and her music. And living on, in a positive way, through your
      children and those you know is, ultimately, the best legacy one can leave.
      And the fact that the circle of people that Kate's mother has influenced,
      through her influence on Kate's music, is so large is an indication of how
      special she must have been. </P>
    
    <P>I think that perhaps what Kate's mother gave her that was most important
      (as an artist, and no doubt in other areas of her life) was that image of
      home, of having a stable place to return to, not just in a literal sense,
      but also in giving Kate a stable place inside herself. </P>
    
    <P>In The Ninth Wave, for example, you have the image of her mother and
      others trying to wake her up so she won't drown, then (in Watching You
      Without Me ) of desiring to be home, then (in The Jig of Life ) the image
      of the future self, perhaps an image similar to that of her mother, coming
      to give her hope, and then (in The Morning Fog ) of finally escaping and
      running home to mother and family. </P>
    
    <P>To me, this is one of Kate's main strengths as an artist, she's always
      been brave enough to delve deep into difficult emotions, perhaps because
      of having that solid base to return to, whereas some artists don't have
      the courage to do this and want to stay in &quot;safe&quot; areas, and
      others stay in the &quot;difficult&quot; areas and don't seem to have the
      desire or ability to fight their way out of them. The fact that the
      difficult sides of life are seen from the strength of someone who also can
      see the more positive sides, is one of the more powerful facets of Kate's
      music. And, to a great extent, we have her mother to thank for this. </P>

    <P>I guess since it was my idea, and since I still think that it could
      work, I'm willing to take over. </P>
    
    <P>If you'd like to contribute to the Terrance Higgins Trust in Hannah's
      memory as part of a Love-hounds group effort, please mail your donation to
      the following address by Monday, March 9. </P>
    
    <P>For Hannah c/o Melissa Caldwell 2785 Stavely Court Columbus, Ohio 43232
    </P>
    
    <P>Please make any checks payable to me so that I can combine them all into
      a single check. I plan to mail the donation on Thursday March 12 and will
      include a list of all contributors. Most charities notify the family that
      a contribution was made and also acknowledge the donor. I'll post any
      acknowledgement right away. </P>

    <P>&gt; A couple of questions: What is the Terrence Higgins Trust? Judging
      from Kate's past political stances, it's probably a very good cause; I'm
      just curious... </P>
    
    <P>The Terence Higgins Trust is an AIDS research foundation. </P>
    
    <P>By a strange coincidence, I just got to see the COIL Tainted Love video,
      which is a striking piece about a man dying of AIDS. There is a text frame
      at the end which says that all profits from the song go to the Terence
      Higgins Trust. </P>

    <P>Homeground 44 arrived this morning. As you might expect, there's an
      obituary for Hannah. It seems the Homegrinders knew KaTe's family quite
      well and were especially close to Hannah. </P>

    <P>Hi all, </P>
    
    <P>I just got back from an interesting lunch. We were talking about
      Valentines' Day coming up soon and I said that it would be a sad day since
      it'll be the first anniversary of Hanna Bush's death. I told my mate that
      it'll be a sad day for KT. He said that I ought to send her a white rose.
      I was dumbfounded since I didn't think he knew much about KT, especially
      about a song like 'Under The Ivy'. You know what I mean, most of her fans
      who know her songs well will send her white roses if they send any kind of
      flowers. </P>
    
    <P>He then explained that the traditional meaning of a white rose is death.
      Sort of throws a new slant on 'Under the Ivy' doesn't it (or have I just
      missed that all these years). </P>

      <BR> Subject: Wogan? </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Why does (or did) she go on Wogan so much, and not a more
      music-oriented program? </P>
    
    <P> She liked him, and it was one of her Mom's favorite shows. Kate made a
      special point of appearing on his show between albums. She knew that her
      Mom would be watching, and he made a special point of asking Hannah to &quot;get
      well soon.&quot; Sadly, she didn't. </P>
