</P>
<P>Here's the latest news from today's new issue of RECORD MIRROR (June 21): 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Hair of the Hound&quot; video compilation has just been released
here. It turns  out that Kate directed both &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and &quot;The
Big Sky&quot; on her own. The  inside of the cover has a great photo from the CB
video. The cover artwork is  basically exactly the same design and set-up as the
album, except that the album title  has been replaced with the video title. The
back has a photo from the video for  &quot;Running up that Hill.&quot;

<BR> Subject: MusikDramatik (4/89) article 
</P>
<P>Article from the Swedish &quot;serious&quot; magazine MusikDramatik's
(Musical drama)  fourth issue 1989. It is written by Ola Stensson. The
translation is mine, with help  from Ms. Carina Skytt. 
</P>
<P>Preamble: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Much can be included in the conception of musical drama --eg rock
videos.  Might this be an art form belonging to the future? Ola Stensson have
studied one  rock artist with artistic ambitions -- Kate Bush.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The article: 
</P>
<P>&quot;There is one enormously vital art form that have been ignored in
Swedish arts  pages during the eighties -- the rock video. It is possible that
this means of  expression already has changed our perception, our view of a
dramatic course of  events, our sense of rhythm, and also our view of man. 
</P>
<P>The rock video is nothing new -- it's nearly as old as the form of music
itself.  The interesting thing is that while this music has stepped back after
the reshaping  years of 1966-1971, rock, in it's capacity of visual medium, has
developed and is at the  moment most creative, vital, and often experimental.
The situation today is really  paradoxal. Sometimes it can almost be as if Harry
Kupfer should produce Laurel &amp;  Hardy film. 
</P>
<P>There are exeptions where music, lyrics, and visuals are a synthesis, and
where  we are at the Complete Work of Art. An example of an artist with
ambitions as well  as means of creating something like this is Kate Bush. It's
not a question of  comparing her to Wagner, Alban Berg, Karl-Birger Blomdahl, or
someone else with  their ambition. But, she is an example of what could be done
and what always can be  done. Most of the innovation remains. 
</P>
<P>WUTHERING HEIGHTS 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush is English, and was born in 1958, made a hit in 1978 with &quot;Wuthering
 Heights&quot;, a song based on Emily Bronte's novel. She has since released six
albums.  The music is sometimes superficially very difficult to access, with
complicated  arrangements and dared shifts in rhythm, especially on the LP &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; form  1982. This dosen't hinder a strong influence from
folk-music, not the least the Irish,  like in &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (1985)
or the Bulgarian as in &quot;The Sensual World&quot; (1989). 
</P>
<P>If you go through Kate Bush's videos from the beginning you find a
development  that pretty well correspond to the one her music has undergone.
Here follow some  examples. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>These songs about no contact and ignorance about the reality, were in some
sense  exchanged by sturdiness in her next album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;.
The perhaps most  famous video from this production is about &quot;a deal with
god&quot; and is called &quot;Running  Up That Hill&quot;. Is it possible to
make a deal with God -- a deal implying that the Man  and the Woman in a
relationship change places, change identities? The answer is of  course no, and
is first illustrated by an intense dance between Kate and a man. Then  she
leaves on her own, but wherever she walks she is met by her opposite -- people 
with her beloved's mask. She gets desperate and soon meets people wearing masks 
identical with her own. Humans may change identity, they might even look like
her,  but she herself cannot change with anyone. 
</P>
<P>HOUNDS OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>In the video for the song &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; she works as a guide in
a factory,  where she finds a man who draws her to him. They flee into the
forest, but the  &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; hunts them. They come to a house in
the woods, where a merry  party is going on. Kate chains herself to the man,
they dance out, but it's not a  question of love, the &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
get tired and give up hunting them. She's  afraid of love as a frightful
possibility, and attach herself to a man only to be able to  renounce. 
</P>
<P>A video with a lot more hopeful tone in it is illustrated by &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;,
based  on a novel by Peter Reich which deals with the child and the father --
the father has  built a rain-making machine. Everything is seen through the eyes
of the child. The  father (played by Donald Sutherland) is caught by brutal
police men in civilian  clothes. The child (Kate) sees him being taken away, but
runs to the machine and  makes it start raining. She rejoices -- the machine is
working -- and the peoples  creative power is stronger than the oppression. The
sky opens and the water pours  down over Cornwall. 
</P>
<P>Thus can Kate Bush's world look -- anyhow in the video version, even if she 
sometimes herself expresses a fear that it might seem too narcissistic. It would
carry  to far to deal with all the details around colouration, choreography, and
cutting  rhythm. But the rock video surely opens new perspectives, and also a
multitude of  interpretation possibilities, at least when it's in the hands of
very gifted people. And  we have seen far from the end yet. 
</P>
<P>The conclusion is: Don't be afraid of the rock culture, and, particularly,
don't be  afraid of the Bush lass. She has much to give us, regardless to which
generation we  belong. And the rock video, as has been said, is a very vital
part of musical drama  which we now must not look down on. Don't content
yourselves with reading about  this: See it and form your own opinion!&quot;

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: re the Musik Dramatik article

</P>
<P>Sincere thanks to Andreas for transcribing the Musik Dramatik article on 
symbolism in Kate's videos. Some of Ola's observations were very interesting, 
though several were unfortunately flawed by a mis-interpretation of the English 
lyrics of the song. The setting of the video of Hounds of Love is not a &quot;factory&quot;,
but  some kind of natural science museum, or perhaps a kind of wartime 
interum-museum which combines art collections with industrial exhibits. 
</P>
<P>IED disagrees with Ola's interpretation of the entire Hounds of Love video,
in  fact. No mention is made of the fact that the man is on the run from the law
(and  the attendant symbolism of the handcuffs, which are first placed on the
heroine's  hand, and finally placed on the man's hand by the heroine), or of the
very  deliberate references to Hitchcock (talk about symbolism!). IED's
conclusion is that,  as welcome as Ola's article is, it barely scratches at the
surface of Kate's symbolic  video imagery. For a &quot;serious&quot; article, it
is disappointingly brief, superficial and  haphazard. 
</P>
<P>Having said all this, it would seem only fair that IED should attempt to do
better.  He will try to post a supplement to Ola's article about Kate's video
imagery  sometime in the near future.

<P>The title of Kate's video compilation The Hair of the Hound is a variant of
the  well-known phrase &quot;the hair of the dog that bit him&quot;. This is
defined in Chambers  (1983) as &quot;a smaller dose of what ails one: a

</P>
<P>Believe it or not, during last friday night on the MTV top -20 video
countdown  they showed 1 complete minute of Running up that Hill!!!!!!
Unbelieveable !! It was  when they were running down the english top 10 (right
before the 5th video), and  they showed what looked like the video Kate made and
not the one EMI banned or  whatever those bozos did. It looked really well done,
and it did not look  'provacative' and 'sexually suggesting' as EMI says. For
the short time it was on tv,  it looked good. The Sex Pistols were right about
EMI.....

<P>&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is now on Empty-V as a full video! I
haven't see it yet (I  don't have cable), but a friend of mine has. Empty-V is
*not* showing the actual  promotional video that Kate made up, instead they are
showing (I infer from the  description the friend gave me) a film of Kate's live
performance of the song on the  Terry Wogan show. Paddy Bush is in the video,
and Kate comes out dressed in a  cloak and at the end of the song loads an arrow
into her bow.

<BR> Subject: KB on Canadian music channel 
</P>
<P>The equivalent of MTV in Canada is called MuchMusic and is available only on
 cable. Every day they do a spot light on an artist, and they've done KB at
least twice  already, but since I don't have cable I missed every single show.
Sigh. 
</P>
<P>The other day I was shopping in Eaton's, one of the largest department chain
 stores across Canada. Suddenly I heard familiar but strange sounds (if that is
not a  contradiction in terms!) and I quickly hunt for the source... Aha! it's
coming from  one of the numerous (~15) TV sets they place around the fashion
departments, all of  which are showing MuchMusic. And what could be playing but
&quot;The Dreaming&quot;!  I've only seen this video once before so I just stood
there entranced. After it  finished, I was starting to turn away, but decided to
see what was coming up next.  Hmm, a woman's hand reaching out to a man's
hand.... WHAT??!! IT CAN'T  BE... YES IT IS!! it's RUNNING UP THAT HILL!! I've
only seen bits of it in the  &quot;New Music&quot; interview, and this time I
got to see it from beginning to end. The first  half was mainly `modern ballet'
between Kate and the male dancer, but I like the  latter half better, where Kate
starts to run away and is grabbed by the man, and  especially the ending, where
the crowd wore paper mask of the male dancer's face,  then wore masks of Kate's
face, and finally Kate `sinking' into the sea of people. 
</P>
<P>So, fellow loyal `Lionhearts', be content that the original (?) version of
RUtH has  been shown to the naive public, though they may not recognize ART even
if they  see it!

Subject: Bitter-Sweet Ecstacy: RUTH
</P>
<P>I just saw both videos for &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;! A friend who
gets cable told  me that they were showing RUTH on MTV, so I lent him my VCR to
record MTV  at night, while everyone is sleeping. A couple days later, he called
me back and said  he got it. So I went over to his house and we watched the
video for RUTH that they  are showing on MTV four times. Then we turned off the
TV and I disconnected the  VCR. As soon as I had finished disconnecting the VCR,
I turned on the TV to make  sure the cable connection was hooked up right. 
</P>
<P>When I turned on the TV, I heard the music for RUTH, so I started to wonder 
how the VCR could still be hooked up. But the VCR was unplugged. So then I 
wondered if MTV was showing RUTH again, but when I looked at the channel, it 
was on a different channel. So then I eventually got around to looking at the
TV, but  what I saw on the TV wasn't the video for RUTH. Then finally I realized
that what  I was seeing is the *original* video for RUTH. And then I nearly
fainted, because I  had just disconnected the VCR!!!!! 
</P>
<P>V66, a music video TV station in Massachusetts, showed the original promo
video! 
</P>
<P>In any case, both videos are excellent, though Kate's promo video just
totally  blows away the clip from the Terry Wogan show that MTV is showing. It's
the best  video I've ever seen! Even better than Gariel's &quot;Shock The Monkey&quot;
and &quot;I Don't  Remember&quot;. I don't understand why MTV doesn't show the
promo video, because  from what I saw of it, it isn't overly erotic, as I had
previously thought. Not nearly so  much as the &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; video,
which is extremely erotic. My guess is that  they think it is too &quot;artsy
fartsy&quot; with Kate doing her wonderful dancing. I would  also guess that
when the song becomes a big success in the U.S., MTV will show the  original
video too. There are some promblems with RUTH doing well in the U.S.,  though.
Apparently, EMI-America didn't expect the song to do as well as it is, and  they
didn't press nearly enough copies. Every place is sold out of them, and they 
can't restock until EMI finishes pressing more. 
</P>
<P>The original promo video is just as Henry Chai described it, except that
*all* of it  is equally amazing! The dancing is completely wonderful.... I could
gush for  hours.... 
</P>
<P>The video on MTV is definitely a clip from the Terry Wogan show, where Kate 
performed the song live (though no one is *really* singing or playing their 
instruments) in front of an audience on August 5th. It starts off with a a guy
saying  something like &quot;And here's Kate Bush!&quot; Then there's clapping,
and the guy fades to  a shot of two flags. Then we see military drums, and then
the camera zooms out to  reveal the whole stage. Kate is standing at a podium,
wearing a cloak and an archery  bow. Behind her are a small and strange marching
band standing in a semi-circle.  There are two drummers with miltary drums.
There are two guitarists. There is  Kate's brother, Paddy, with a balalaika, and
there is a guy with a Yamaha KX  keyboard that he's wearing with a shoulder
strap. Behind the marching band are  two guys holding flags. 
</P>
<P>Kate does not dance at all in this performance (it's one of the very few
where  she does not). Instead she stands at the podium and gestures with her
arms and with  her head as if she is a preacher in a church, preaching to a
large congregation, as she  sings about making a deal with God. As the
performance goes on, the podium gets  shorter and shorter until Kate is kneeling
at the podium, and looks like a Bible  thumping Baptist minister kneeling in
front of his congregation. 
</P>
<P>At the end of the song, Kate removes her bow and pulls an arrow from Paddy's
 quiver. She loads the bow, draws, and aims it at the sky (At heaven? At God? At
the  &quot;killer storm&quot;?) 
</P>
<P>I think I'm going to buy a color TV today... Boy, I sure wish I could see
the  original promo video again.....

Subject: RUTH video 
</P>
<P>Here is a description of Kate's original video for RUTH that I posted to 
net.music, but neglected to send to love-hounds: 
</P>
<P>The original promo video is largely a work of modern ballet that Kate 
choreographed and performed with a male dancer. It is completely wonderful. Both
 Kate and the male dancer are dressed exactly the same, in blue-grey shirts and 
strange blue-grey skirts. Parts of the dance seem to symbolize being scared of
love,  which is the theme of the A-side of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. At one
point in the dance,  Kate and the male dancer become symbolically crucified on
each other. There is also  mimed archery. Later, a croud of people all dressed
like Kate and wearing masks of  the male dancer's face separate Kate and the
male dancer. Later Kate struggles  through and tries to climb over the same
croud, but this time they are wearing  masks with *her* face. Eventually, she
seems to drown in the croud of Kate Bush's  -- symbolizing how we are forever
trapped within ourselves. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It breaks the cage, fear escapes and takes possession <BR> Just like
a croud rioting inside&quot;

<P>The &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; film is fraught with NARRATIVE details;
has  everyone else already  realized that? Also, with the inferior copy I had

Has everyone noted the  explicit reference to Dali, as well, in the God's-eye

half?

EDT <BR> Subject: The final word on the censorship of the RuTH video 
</P>
<P>I'm afraid I'm responsible for starting this misguided rumour that the &quot;Running
 Up That Hill&quot; video was too erotic for the U.S. market. I made this
assumption years  ago before the video was released in the U.S. when an
acquaintence of mine, who  had seen the video long before I was able to see it,
told me that it was like the  &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; video (which is far more
shocking in its eroticism than the  &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; video).
This comparison of the RuTH video with the  &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; video,
combined with the knowledge that EMI-America had told  me that there were
problems with &quot;suitability&quot; of the RuTH video, led me to  conclude
that the video was too erotic for the American market. I passed on this  news
and my assumption (though I told him it was only my assumption, and not a 
proven fact) to Peter Morris of Homeground via a phone conversation. He has 
apparently continued to pass on this rumour ever since. 
</P>
<P>The truth of the matter, however, was told by John Carter Bush at the Kate
Bush  convention in November of '85, so Homeground should also be aware of the
accurate  reason for the U.S. consorship of the real video for RuTH. It *is*
true that MTV  refused to play the real video for RuTH. Their refusal to play
the real video lasted  for the period of time that the song was in rotation on
MTV. During this time they  played only the Wogan TV clip. Once the song was
taken out of rotation, they started  playing the real video in altrenation with
the Wogan clip. The reason for their  refusal to play the real video, however,
was not due to any eroticism in the video, but  rather due to the fact that the
video was not lip-synched. 
</P>
<P>MTV has (or at least had, at the time) a policy that &quot;breaking&quot;
artists who have  not yet achieved popular success in the U.S. market, must
appear to sing in their  videos. MTV took this complaint to EMI-America, which
took the complaint to the  Bush family, which decided to send EMI-America a tape
of the Wogan appearance  to placate the philistines in the U.S. MTV, now happy
with a video which fit nicely  into their pigeon-hole for &quot;breaking&quot;
artists, promptly put it into rotation. 
</P>
<P>EMI-America distributed both videos to other TV stations, giving the
stations the  choice of being either philistines or bastions of taste and
culture. A year later, MTV,  in their infinite wisdom and hypocracy, nominated
for best video by a female artist  Kate's real video that they had previously
refused to show. 
</P>
<P>I hope this sets the record straight!

</P>
<P>As IED interprets the video of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, Kate (who
directed the clip  herself) wanted to make a tribute to Hitchcock's British
films of the 1930s,  particularly &quot;The Thirty-nine Steps&quot;. Far from
having no story, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; is  an organized little tale of love
and trust. 
</P>
<P>In the beginning Kate's heroine is a demure and withdrawn loner, visiting a 
museum (of a rather odd sort--perhaps a museum of science and industry?). (By
the  way, keep an eye out for Hitch himself in this early scene.) The hero, who
plays  Robert Donat's character (or a parallel thereof) in &quot;The Thirty-nine
Steps&quot;, comes  in looking for a way to escape the clutches of the law. He
clamps Kate's character to  his wrist with handcuffs and rushes off into the
night with her, with the authorities  hot on their heels. 
</P>
<P>The reference here is to Richard Hannay's ploy of fettering Madeleine
Carroll to  him with a pair of handcuffs, whereupon he takes her off with him
into the night,  on the Scottish hills and dales. They take refuge at a pub (or
dance hall of some  kind) where a conga dance is taking place--a typical
Hitchcock crowd scene. By the  end of this scene Kate's character, who was
initially resentful of the dangerous  stranger, has warmed to the freedom from
solitude and convention that he  represents, and (following the hero's recapture
and momentary second escape from  the police) she herself snaps the handcuffs
back on between them before she leads  them out into the darkness to renew their
flight. 
</P>
<P>The video also recalls (at least in the outdoor scene and the first few
seconds of  the video itself, before the song begins) the introductory reference
to the movie  &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; (aka &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot;).
Also note Paddy's dual role (at  the museum and in the public house), and a
great many other fascinating little  details worth discovering. IED's personal
view is that this video has been badly  underrated, and it's about time it got
the attention it merits.

IED0DXM%MVS.OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: HoL 
</P>
<P>There have been several remarks in Love-Hounds recently to the effect that
Kate  Bush's &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; video is &quot;muddled&quot; and vague.
IED disagrees. The story  that Kate tells in her self-directed video for &quot;Hounds
of Love&quot; is, superficially at  least, simple. Referring to several early
(British-made) movies by Alfred Hitchcock,  as well as to the movie &quot;Night
of the Demon&quot; (aka &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot;), a  British-made horror
film of the '50s starring Dana Andrews, Kate depicts the  romantic adventure of
a demure, spinsterish and scholarly young woman who, while  visiting some sort
of museum in England during the 1930s, is swept off her feet by a  mysterious,
dramatic adventurer who is in the custody of undercover police agents.  The man
clamps one end of his handcuffs over the woman's wrist, escapes the  clutches of
the police and whisks the woman away with him into the wilds at night.  On the
run in the woods she begins to perceive the man's generous inner nature,  and
she accompanies him even after her wrist is freed from the handcuffs. (All of 
this is lifted from Hitchcock's &quot;The Thirty-nine Steps&quot;--look very
carefully at the  first few seconds of the video and you'll even spot Hitch's
trademark cameo  walk-on appearance.) 
</P>
<P>The couple seek anonymity in a public-house crowd, where they dance. The 
woman struggles with the two sides of her nature during this scene: watch her 
expression shift between aloof, passive acquiescence in the dance to sheer joy
in the  moment. When the authorities catch up with them, they begin to take the 
mysterious outlaw with them, but this time it is the woman who snaps the
handcuffs  on the stranger, and off they go into the night together again. 
</P>
<P>The story is told without dialogue in three and a half minutes, yet (in
IED's  opinion) with great clarity and power. All the details that are needed to
follow the  story are there to be found, if you look for them. But as with
virtually all of Kate's  stories (both in the songs' lyrics themselves and in
their video illustrations), the  narrative events are not exaggerated--they can
be missed unless watched for closely.  There are some other wonderful details in
this video, which IED will let viewers  discover for themselves. But remember
that, as is true of most of Kate's works, the  video of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;
tells a second and perhaps larger story than meets the  eye...

</P>
<P>For self-therapeutic reasons I have decided to let everyone know that, in
hopes of  recording &quot;The Big Sky&quot; promo film, I have now watched
nearly 13 hours of MTV. 
</P>
<P>This has been a thoroughly depressing experience even in fast scanning
speed. I  know it sounds naive, but I simply cannot understand how the people
who run that  station can go to sleep at night, knowing what they do, how much
bad taste they are  responsible for. I don't mean to imply that I have any moral
objection like the  senators' wives, or anything like that -- but can someone
explain to me how any  self-respecting teen-ager (I assume the large majority of
their audience are in their  mid-teens) can submit to video after video of these
bands of beefy men with  elaborately coiffed hair and ludicrous electric
guitars, strutting about in striped or  leopard-spotted tights and wiggling in
front of paid models? How many garish  orange-and-blue lighting effects will the
audience take without objection? For how  long will they tolerate the exhibition
of an endless succession of mindless, preening,  narcissistic morons? And how
many viewers have been really deluded into a belief  that lip-synching is
actually a live performance? If none, then why does lip-synching  continue? 
</P>
<P>I assume that Kate continues to do it out of an obligation to satisfy the
demands of  her business, but who in the business could still be convinced of
the efficacy of  lip-synching? It seems to me that whatever advantage gained
from letting the  original recording substitute for a potentially imperfect live
performance of the  music is more than offset by the ridiculous visual effect of
lip-synching itself. Half  the time now the performers don't even go through the
minimal attempt at  deception of holding a microphone. I'm down, L-Hs, I'm
really down. And it's  going to get worse as the days go by, as long as I have
to keep watching that crud.

</P>
<P>I finally picked out Peter Morris in Kate's &quot;Big Sky&quot; film, thanks
to Doug's hint  that he plays a pilot. In fact there are at least three pilots,
all wearing fighter pilot  caps and goggles, and Peter is recognizable for an
instant on the far left, as the  camera pans by the group. 
</P>
<P>Now, the only crucial question is whether one of the pairs of goggles is the
same  as that worn by Kate during her performance of &quot;Lionheart&quot; in
the Hammersmith  video. (You will remember that one of that pair's lenses was
cracked...) Doug has  already noted a reference to the Lionheart LP in the film,
and I see an allusion to  the &quot;Dreaming&quot; film in the falcon sequence
from &quot;The Big Sky&quot;.The astronauts, of  course, can be seen as an echo
of &quot;Hello Earth.&quot; Perhaps there are more references  to be found. 
</P>
<P>Does anyone know of any previous reference in Kate's work to either Superman
 or Napoleon? I assume they are merely references to flight --Napoleon's symbol 
being the eagle -- and thus to the sky.

<P>I think that someone pointed out to Kate that Empty-V seems to have a strong
 dislike for her style of video, and so she sat down and watched nothing but
Empty-V  for a week. And then thought to herself, &quot;Pphah! I can do that
*much* better!&quot; She  then proceeded to make the silliest Empty-V-like video
possible, throwing in every  single Empty-V cliche that ever existed or ever
will exist and lots of other stuff just  for good measure, all the while having

(Simon Booth) <BR> Subject: A most unusual Kate video seen over the
holidays..... 
</P>
<P>Hello everyone- my first posting here! :-) 
</P>
<P>Over the Christmas holiday, a few days before Christmas, I was at a party,
and  someone was giving a sneak preview of what is supposed to be an upcoming
(but as  yet unaired) public access cable TV show. The show is called 'Projekt:
X-Treme'  (yes, that's how it was spelled) 
</P>
<P>One episode shown was a series of music videos, and among them was Big Sky, 
but not the version I remembered from several years ago. For one thing, the
audio  seemed out of synch with the opening sequence of the video, and during
the part  where she's looking up with binoculars, she points them upward, a jet
fighter  appears swooping in low. From that point on, the video was a montage of
aircraft  war footage, mostly Gulf War bombing footage, leading up to a scene of
a B-52  squadron's scramble takeoff, and ending with shots of nuclear missiles
launching, all  synchronized with the song 'Big Sky'. The running time must have
been at least 6  minutes, alot longer than the original. Obviously a parody of
some sort. 
</P>
<P>I know this can't be an official video, but is it a bootleg? I mean, has
anyone else  seen this? One other video on the tape seemed to be a similar
parody: Enya's 'Sail  Away' sychronized with a montage of submarine war footage.

</P>
<P>If it's not a bootleg in circulation, then it's something the producer
himself put  together. I didn't get a chance to ask about it, but if it is
something he made  himself, it would have been relatively easy to do.

</P>
<P>For those that are interested, the Cloudbusting video outside scenes were
shot in  the Vale of the White Horse just outside Swindon, not far from Bristol,
England. I  haven't ascertained this offically but on a visit there several
years ago, there was a  stunning familiarity about the place. Checking the video
when I got home verified  my hunch. 
</P>
<P>For those that get a chance to visit this place it's quite obvious they made
a good  job of hiding Swindon in the background. The hillock on which the
Cloudbuster is  filmed is actually the corner of a raised dyke that surrounded
an old castle (now  gone), or something like that. 
</P>
<P>FYI, the Vale of the White Horse is the place where an ancient (and
humongous)  highly stylised white horse has been etched out of the surface of
the chalk hill and is  visible for miles around. Well worth a visit.

Subject: videos 
</P>
<P>Greetings again, all. And special thanks to Tracy and Andrew for making the 
Santa Cruz bash such a success. 
</P>
<P>At long last I've started acquiring copies of the official videos on
laserdisc for  careful perusal. Those discs at the party, Corey, were Andrew's,
not mine, and our  gratitude should be rightfully be his. 
</P>
<P>At any rate, I present installment #1 of Dave's Excessively Trivial
Observations  On Kate's Video's. 
</P>
<P>Cloudbusting 
</P>
<P>I think it's clear that Peter does see Wilhelm pointing at the hill from
within the  car; he begins gesturing even as Peter runs into the road not 5 feet
after the car  passes, and continues as it disappears around the bend. 
</P>
<P>There is a partial excuse for the rapid jet contrail in one time-lapse
scene, and it  can be found on page 20 of the Obelisk edition &quot;Book of
Dreams&quot;. Peter describes  how the Air Force would fly overhead to indicate
where there were high  concentrations of DOR to be found, and that DOR caused
their exhaust streams to  dissipate rapidly. However, the long, wide, straight
cloud farther to the right looks  like a second, older contrail and it
dissipates only slightly. Perhaps the cloudbuster  has already been applied
there. 
</P>
<P>In a rare lapse of continuity, we see the sun overhead in the path of the 
cloudbuster. Both before and after, we see the sun near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>Note that Kate is actually wearing women's clothing throughout the video;
the  shirts and sweaters all button on the left side. 
</P>
<P>Reich's office contains an unusual assortment of paraphenalia for a
psychoanalyst,  but consistent with his interest in pseudo-biochemistry. The
glassware is typical for  a chemist, but he also has two microscopes and a small
centrifuge on the bench. The  walls sport anatomical diagrams, and he is growing
at least one vine-like plant in a  long glass column (but not
hydroponically...it grows in dirt). 
</P>
<P>There are two old (non-glowing) yo-yo's in the in tray on his desk. 
</P>
<P>Reich picks up a paper from the lower right of his desk, studies it, then
crumples  and discards it. There are only three words on it, barely visible;
viewed with a  mirror I think they say &quot;My Final Paper&quot;. IED -you have
a CAV copy, perhaps you  can read it more clearly. 
</P>
<P>Although the car leaving the farmhouse is clearly right-hand-drive, later we
see  that it sports a license plate the correct size and shape for an American
one.

<P>OK, enough of that. Let IED bore his readers on some other Kate Bushological
 topics now. 
</P>
<P>First, let IED commend and thank Dave Hsu for taking the time to study the 
recent videos again and alert IED to a number of remarkable details of which he 
had been unaware. IED did get out his CAV Hair of the Hound laser-disk and check
 Cloudbusting, and yes, the page that Sutherland crumples up, when inspected via
a  mirror, does indeed have &quot; My Last Paper &quot; written on it: not
simply a title, but a  regretful comment on Reich's part. Interesting to learn
that in this moment Reich is  not thinking about his imminent separation from
Peter (as IED had assumed), but  about the end of his intellectual career. Very
sad. IED now sees the yo-yos, too.  Amazing eyes you have, Dave! 
</P>
<P>IED would like to say to all those who attended Tracy's marvellous party
that  sometime they should see the Cloudbusting CAV laser video on a Sony XBR
monitor  (or one of similar resolution), because not only is the text of the
Oregon newspaper  article much easier to read on such equipment, even the first
two lines of the smaller  type under the first paragraph is legible, as well. 
</P>
<P>Thanks again for your observations, Dave. Fascinating stuff.
