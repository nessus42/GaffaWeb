<BR> Subject: A divine religious experience 
</P>
<P>Hi, 
</P>
<P>Jem here. I've been reading Love-hounds for about a year or so now, never 
really been into KT (certainly no LoveHound), but its always been a good source
of  info on many things, and hell, the people are nice. I've made the odd
contribution,  but nothing KT relaTed. 
</P>
<P>About two weeks ago, something very strange happened. 
</P>
<P>After a year of having no Hi-Fi, I moved all my gear onto the boat where I
live,  and was listening to all sorts of stuff. 
</P>
<P>One evening I put on Fairport Conventions &quot;In Real Time&quot; and
played it really  low. At the end of 'The Hiring Fair' a track which is soooo
mellow, you can't play  anything after it unless its even more mellow, I looked
for something else to put on  that would keep me in the same mood. 
</P>
<P>At the back of the tape drawers I found a tape I'd forgotten I owned... 
</P>
<P>It said..... Kate Bush...Lionheart. 
</P>
<P>Ok, thinks me. Lets see what these LoveHounds have been raving about. 
</P>
<P>Tape in. 
</P>
<P>Close drawer. 
</P>
<P>Play........ 
</P>
<P>(Listening to tape) 
</P>
<P>(OHMYGODWHATTHEHELLISHAPPENINGITISNTSUPPOSEDTOBELIKETHIS!) 
</P>
<P>...........End of tape. 
</P>
<P>I'll leave you to work out what happened while it was playing, I'm sure you
have  all gone through the same, somewhat indescribeable experience. Needless to
say, the  end of the tape finds me sitting perfectly still, in a daze, sweating
slightly (I kid you  not). 
</P>
<P>That was two weeks or so ago. Now, having had no money to buy any more 
albums, my copy of Lionheart has just about had it. I have been listening to it 
CONSTANTLY since I heard it. We are talking 4 or 5 times an evening, playing, 
turning over, playing again, and so on. I managed to find a copy of The Whole
Story  video, brand new, on a market stall for a fiver (borrowed the money
straight away!). 
</P>
<P>My local record shop's going to love me when I get paid!!! 
</P>
<P>One of the nicest things (and the reason for this note) is that It probably
would  never have happened if it were not for me reading this list. I really
picked up on it  because I could recognise bits before I'd even heard it. You
dont read a list like this  for a year and not learn anything. What I'm trying
to say is THANKYOU  LoveHounds for making me actually pick up the tape and
listen. You don't know  how good it makes me feel. 
</P>
<P>Guess I'm too late for the Con. though :-( 
</P>
<P>Cuddles, kisses and general KaTeness, 
</P>
<P> Jem.

<P>THAT IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!! 
</P>
<P>Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! 
</P>
<P>You're right about it being indescribable. I felt that way the first time I
heard  Kate. Pop tape in...press Play...the first few notes of Wuthering Heights
tickle my  brain...Kate starts singing.....and....within 30 seconds I knew I'd
begun a love  affair that would last me the rest of my life! I had no idea it
would CHANGE my life  the way it has. I wouldn't be where I am now, I would
never have met Chris, I  would never have gotten a radio show, I wouldn't &quot;know&quot;
all you wonderful  Love-Hounds, I wouldn't be going to England in just a couple
of  days...on&amp;on&amp;on&amp;on. I have Kate to thank for my entire
life-style. That's the honest  truth.

</P>
<P>Hi there KB fans around the world! I, your humble pseudo-moderator, am
taking  a higher paying job in &quot;Industry&quot; and will be moving out of my
comfy office at MIT  into a ubiquitous cubicle at Hitachi Computer Products in
Waltham, MA.  Unfortunately, I will not be as well-connected to the Internet at
Hitachi, and,  therefore, I will not be able to continue as the pseudo-moderator
of Love-Hounds  and rec.music.gaffa, though I will be able to continue
membership as a normal  subscriber. 
</P>
<P>Fortunately, there is a volunteer, who is willing and eager to take over. He
will  probably be able to provide a much higher level of service than I have
been able to  do for the last year or so, so I hope you will all give a big
round of applause for you  new humble pseudo-moderator, Bill Wisner
(wisner@ims.alaska.edu), who will be  running the mailing list and newsgroup all
the way from sunny, tropical Alaska. 
</P>
<P>I will be tranfering pseudo-moderatorship to him in a few days. If you have
been  sending submissions or mail to &quot;love-hounds@gaffa.mit.edu&quot;,
please do not do so any  longer. &quot;Gaffa.mit.edu&quot; will be going away,
and it has never been the official address.  The offical address for posting has
always been, and will remain 
</P>
<P>&quot;love-hounds@eddie.mit.edu&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The address for requests will remain &quot;love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu&quot;.
It has  been a fun five years, and I hope the mailing list and newsgroup will
continue for  another 500. 
</P>
<P>Your humble almost-ex-pseudo-moderator,

</P>
<P>This is your introductory form letter: 
</P>
<P>You are now on the love-hounds mailing list! Love-hounds is available in two
 forms: you can immediately be forwarded every message sent to love-hounds, or
you  can receive a daily auto-digest. If you would like your status to be
toggled, just tell  me and I will arrange for it. To mail to the mailing list,
send to 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love-Hounds@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&quot; (EDDIE.MIT.EDU 
</P>
<P>is also the uucp site &quot;mit-eddie.UUCP&quot;). Administrivia should go
to 
</P>
<P>&quot;Love-Hounds-Request@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&quot;. 
</P>
<P>If you are interested in wading through Megabytes of cruft, the Love-Hounds 
archives are available on the Internet via FTP. Archives live in the directory 
/pub/love-hounds/archives on hayes.ims.alaska.edu. Some material of interest
(song  lyrics, interviews, etc.) relating to Kate Bush may be found in the
directory  /pub/love-hounds/kh on the same host. 
</P>
<P>Note also that the contents of the mailing list can also be read in the
USENET  newsgroup rec.music.gaffa. If you have access to the newsgroup, you may
want to  read it rather than the list to reduce mail overhead.

(Jorn Barger) <BR> Subject: Monthly post (getting the ball rolling) 
</P>
<P>[This is the very first FAQ! --WIE]
</P>
<P>(This is a first imperfect attempt at collating some facts for a monthly
post. Please  help me fill in the blanks.) 
</P>
<P>Rec.music.gaffa is a 5-year-old newsgroup dedicated to the artistic genius
of Kate  Bush. &quot;Gaffa&quot; comes from her song &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;
(on The Dreaming ), and  (according to Kate) refers to gaffer's tape, or duct
tape, used to keep people from  tripping over electrical cabling. 
</P>
<P>Rec.music.gaffa is run as a moderated group only because submissions to it
are  forwarded to an extensive mailing list of people without net access, who
form an  informal fan club called &quot;Love-Hounds&quot;. You can mail
submissions, without fear of  censorship, to: 
</P>
<P>love-hounds@eddie.mit.edu 
</P>
<P>To subscribe to the mailing list [and here I begin to lie hopelessly,
because this is  what I tried and it hasn't worked] send a message containing
the single word  &quot;SUBSCRIBE&quot; to 
</P>
<P>love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu [what's wrong with this, please?] 
</P>
<P>The big event of 1990 was the Kate Bush Fan Clubs Convention, November 17 at
 London's Hammersmith Palais, celebrating the release (in the UK, Canada and 
Japan) of the &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; boxed set, containing all her albums
in  conventional form, along with two CDs (or three LPs) of B-sides and
alternative  mixes. Of the 1300 convention attendees, some 50 were Love-Hounds,
many from the  US and Australia, meeting face to face for the first time. Kate
spent an hour  answering questions submitted by audience members, and announced
that she hopes  to have a new album finished very quickly, having begun
composing at the piano  again. 
</P>
<P>She also claimed she's planning to &quot;play some dates&quot; at the end of
1991, possibly  including some in the US. (Old Kate-Hounds are protecting
themselves from  disappointment with a wait-and-see attitude, having heard all
this before.) 
</P>
<P>Kate's earliest band was called the KT Bush Band, (KT being readable as
Katey),  and all her albums have had a KT emblem hidden somewhere on the cover.
With  the boxed set she introduced a new version of the symbol, integrating the 
astrological symbol for Venus (ie, the biological symbol for woman). 
</P>
<P>All five years of rec.music.gaffa/love-hounds-digest can be ftp'd from the 
love-hounds archive at hayes.ims.alaska.edu (137.229.30.200) in directory 
</P>
<P>/pub/love-hounds/archives 
</P>
<P>Song lyrics, interviews, etc are in /pub/love-hounds/kh on the same host. 
</P>
<P>GIF files are also available.(???) 
</P>
<P>For those without FTP capabilities, Richard Caldwell has started a BBS that
offers  the GIFs and current r.m.g postings. The Big Sky BBS can be reached 24
hours a day  at 614-864-1198 (1200 or 2400 baud).

Hill) <BR> Subject: Cloudbusting project
</P>
<P>AHEM. I have been working on a project now for some time and have been 
waiting until I get past the &quot;point of no return&quot; to announce it here
and since I  passed that about a month ago and am now almost finished I might as
well announce  it! 
</P>
<P>I am working on an electronic &quot;book&quot; called &quot;Cloudbusting -
Kate Bush In Her  Own Words&quot;. This is a strictly not-for-profit venture
that will be available,  depending on how you get it, either free or for a
slight &quot;copying charge&quot;. It is a  complition of virtually every quote
from Kate arranged by Song, Story, and Subject  order. NO interpectations,
reviews, opinions, etc, will be included. The idea is to let  Kate's words speak
for themselves, and believe me, they really do!! It's quite  startling to see so
much &quot;pure Kate&quot; without all the cruft. 
</P>
<P>The source files for most of Cloudbusting were Andrew Marvick and co.'s The 
Garden, which is Andrew's book of REPRINTS of articles/interviews with Kate  and
several ORIGINAL files, including a complete chronology, ALL the lyrics to ALL 
of Kate's songs, and several other goodies. The files were taken from an obscure
 IBM typesetting program and translated to straight ascii by myself. The
ORIGINAL  files will be included complete (hopefully, if there's room), with the
disk versions of  Cloudbusting. The first version of Cloudbusting will be text
only and will be  posted as seperate messages here in about two/three weeks.
Since I have been  advised by the moderator to only send about 20-25k at a time
this will take more  than a month! (I expect the text files, after editting, to
be at least 600k possibly more  than a meg.). If anybody catches ANY errors let
me know!!!! By the time I get the  whole thing sent I should have the full disk
versions done. These I will be sending to  the Moderator to be posted and also
full versions will appear on The Big Sky BBS  and possibly, GENIE, and other
commercial services. Also I will be sending copies to  the people who run
various fan club/magazines. 
</P>
<P>I will also be making an offer (UT-OH!!) to copy it in IBM 3 1/2 inch or
AMIGA  format for about 5 or 6 bucks to cover the disks, mailing, bumb disks,
overseas, etc. I  don't mind making a zillion copies if I have to, as I think it
is something most people  will want, but I would appreciate it if you know
people who have the same computer  type as you if you could co-ordinate between
yourselves to just get one copy and  make copies for each other. This will save
you money and me time. I will NOT  generally be making PRINTED copies so if you
know non-computer Kate fans,  grank up those printers for a major dump! Also any
help in getting it to other  networks and to any other form would be
appeciated!!! I think it will make a great  &quot;add&quot; for the love-hounds.

Rose Fund 
</P>
<P> Hi, Love-Hounds! 
</P>
<P>Congratulations! Love-Hounds have already contributed enough money to the 
White Rose Fund to afford at least three dozen white roses in ivy to Kate Bush's
 family home on Katemas, 1991. IED would like to thank the following generous 
philocanines in particular: Vishal Markandey, Michael Peskura, Ed Suranyi (hope 
it's not misspelled, Ed!), Laura and Robin Clifford, and (for exceptional
largesse)  Rick Thompson. Thanks to all of you. 
</P>
<P>IED has decided to do two things. First, he would like to send along to the 
florists' in England each of the little notes that the above contributors sent
along  with their contributions, with the instruction that the envelope of notes
be delivered  together with the roses. IED will add to the Fund any such notes
which may  accompany future contributions. The amount of the contribution is not
important,  but remember: the more money contributed, the larger the bouquet
will be.  Wouldn't it be neat if Love-Hounds could send ten dozen roses, along
with a bunch  of personal happy-birthday greetings?

</P>
<P>Well, in the end IED received enough money (counting his own donation) to
pay  for NINE DOZEN long-stemmed white roses (at 11 Pounds 75 Pence per dozen)
with  ivy intertwined. The roses will be delivered on July 30 to Kate's family
home in  Welling together with an envelope containing all the notes which IED
received along  with contributors' donations. The total cost: 105 Pounds 75
Pence, plus about $12.00  in phone fees. Total donations: $200.00. When IED sees
his next Visa bill he'll post  the net balance, and the remaining money (if any)
will be held over till next  Katemastime. 
</P>
<P>IED will call the florists' again to confirm receipt of the envelope of
messages for  Kate, and once more following Katemas to make sure delivery was
made. 
</P>
<P>All that's left is to say a big Thank You to all those who contributed their
 hard-earned cash--from $5.00 to $50.00 apiece--just to help fatten up the 
Love-Hounds bouquet. Thanks, then, to:

IED  has checked back a couple of times with the florists in Welling, who

the flowers were  successfully delivered to East Wickham Farm, and were accepted

Wisner &lt;wisner&gt; <BR> Subject: what's happening with Love-Hounds 
</P>
<P>Due to major lossage at the University of Alaska, Love-Hounds hasn't been 
working for the last few weeks. This problem happned at a singularly bad time,
as I  was in Los Angeles with sporadic network access and thus couldn't fix it.
Things  have stabilized in my personal life a bit (if not in Alaska) and I'm
back again. (and  sorry, incidentally, about missing the San Jose Katemas party.
maybe next year.) 
</P>
<P>Since I've left Alaska, there's nobody left who can properly fix the network
 problems hayes has fallen victim to. For this and other reasons, I've moved the
 mailing list a bit closer to civilization. 
</P>
<P>Love-Hounds' new home is wiretap.Spies.COM. The old addresses at 
EDDIE.MIT.EDU will continue to work (at least, they will after the aliases there
 have been updated). wiretap should be more reliable than hayes. And the
addresses  at hayes.ims.alaska.edu will forward to wiretap, but if you use them
it's at your own  risk. 
</P>
<P>The upshot of this all is that within two or three days Love-Hounds should
not  merely be back to its normal state; it should be better. 
</P>
<P>The Love-Hounds archives will also be moved to wiretap (this should be good 
news for *everybody* with FTP access, since the line to Alaska can be a mite
slow)  but with one notable change: the base pathname will be just /love-hounds
instead of  /pub/love-hounds. Under /love-hounds all pathnames will remain the
same. 
</P>
<P>Sorry about all the problems, and if there are any more please let me know.

that have  transpired since I posted these, players have come and gone. Some of
the players  remain the same. Newcomers may recognize some the allusions.

<P>Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1991 01:01:42 -0800 <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com
(Ronald Hill) <BR> Subject: *** New Kate Bush 'Lectronic Book *** 
</P>
<P>[unfortunately this never appeared. :-(  --WIE]
</P>
<P>Deeper Understanding - A Compilation Of Kate Bush Articles 
</P>
<P> I'd like to announce another electronic book I am a working on. It's called
 Deeper Understanding, and it will essentially be a &quot;best of&quot; the
Love-Hounds and, to  a lesser extent, magazines and fan magazines. The idea is
to collect the accumulated  wisdom (???) of the love-hounds and make it
available in a better form than having  to search through megabtyes of old
messages. For the most part there will be no  other artists, personal attacks,
political discussion, interviews with Kate, or stuff that  repeats info already
in Cloudbusting or The Garden. Material from magazines and  fanzines will also
be included where it is available, but I probably won't be typing  much in, so
unless it already in electronic form, it probably won't be included. 
</P>
<P>The format is simular to Cloudbusting, I'm currently dividing it into the
following  parts: 
</P>
<P>DMusic - Info on Songs/Albums (Reviews, Interpetations, etc.) <BR> DStory -
Info on various events in Kate's/Fan life <BR> DRefer - places where Kate is
mentioned <BR> DSubject - Info on Various Subjects, People, etc. <BR> DHumour
- Kate related humour <BR> DLhounds - Love-Hounds specific subjects 
</P>
<P>I am thinking of all adding a section for &quot;first time&quot; experiences
with Kate. I may  also add the following, if other people are willing to type
the stuff in: 
</P>
<P>KPoetry - Kate inspired poetry (from fanzines) <BR> KStories - Kate
inspired stories (from fanzines) 
</P>
<P>I don't know when I'll be finished with this. I started it while waiting for
news  of various sources of new material for &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and since
I've started back in  on that, I'll be working on &quot;DU&quot; only when I get
bored and need new reading  material. 
</P>
<P>A major problem at this time is that I don't have access to all the past
messages.  I only have access to messages from the time I've been on, basicly to
the beggining  of the year. If anyone would be willing to get me the files from
past years and put  them on IBM 720k disks, I would be more then willing to
remeburse you.. If I'm  not able to get these, it will basicly just be the best
from this year. 
</P>
<P>I've gotten through most of this year and it's about 400k so far. For the
most part  I am simply including the messages as-is, editing only when a message
drifts into  another topic. I suspect it will probably be more then 2 megabytes
when finished,  but I can't be sure, as I've heard in years past Love-Hounds
wasn't always as active  as it is now.

<P>IED liked that one, Ron! Great job--fast work transcribing all that stuff.
IED  suggests that the aim now for The Garden 's next edition should be to
integrate all  the transcriptions of the video interviews directly into the

<P>The Love-Hounds mailing list has moved to the site uunet.UU.NET. This should
 make the mailing list and newsgroup more reliable. uunet also happens to be one
of  the best connected sites in the world. 
</P>
<P>This change should be transparent to readers of rec.music.gaffa. For
Love-Hounds  subscribers, the new submission address is
Love-Hounds@uunet.UU.NET. The new  request address is
Love-Hounds-request@uunet.UU.NET.

<P>The rec.music.gaffa gateway is operational again. It was down because of a 
software problem at UUNET that I didn't have the ability to fix. New software
has  been installed here, and things should be working fine once again. 
</P>
<P>I'm also starting to move the archives to ftp.uu.net. As I do so they will
become  available in the directory /usenet/rec.music.gaffa. Contents of the &quot;kb&quot;
directory  will likely show up first, followed as I get the time by the rest of
the mailing list  archives up to the present.

General 
</P>
<P>Dear Friends, 
</P>
<P>It occurs to me that I have not said some things that I ought to. Firstly
greetings  to Andy Marvick , if he's anywhere that can receive this. 
</P>
<P>Secondly many thanks to whoever it was who sent us the Love-Hounds baseball 
caps, some while ago. They have served us well - particularly mine own bald
patch  this Summer. 
</P>
<P>Greetings to ]&gt;oug. No electronic version of HOMEGROUND planned, I'm
afraid. 
</P>
<P>Special greetings to Ron Hill. Ron - thankyou for sending me (some time ago)
the  first edition of *Cloudbusting*, together with associated pictures. Believe
it or not it  is only within the last few weeks that we have geared up here
computerwise,  sufficiently to read any of these. Our progress in the IT world
since we obtained our  trusty Commodore PC20III has been slow and painful. All I
can say is that we are in  awe of the work that has gone into the project. It is
a work of reference for all in  the Kate-speaking-world for years to come. When
and if we can figure the  technology, I'll try to download the second edition! 
</P>
<P>One of the many messages of welcome that we received mentioned that the 
Love-Hounds may now feel like a class of school-kids after teacher has arrived.
I  hope not. Actually HOMEGROUND has been a passive associate of gaffa since its
 inception. With a few short gaps, I have read or skimmed almost every article
that  has ever been posted. I have followed the news, the flame wars and even
the  sometime brutally frank opinions on HOMEGROUND with varying degrees of 
interest, amusement, and sadness. Of particular interest this year was the
debate  with Kevin Hendrix as the various virtues of the net as opposed to the
printing  press. 
</P>
<P>Our view is quite simple. We consider HOMEGROUND to be a magazine of  record
in the Kate-speaking-world. Therefore I have been pinching news and  information
off gaffa ever since the beloved founder ]&gt;oug set the newsgroup going.  I
have always acknowledged the source. In return I have sought (usually via Vickie
 and Chris) to disseminate important information via gaffa. In the 
Kate-speaking-world I tend to see HOMEGROUND as the London *Times* and  gaffa as
Reuter. We interact to serve Kate's fans the better. 
</P>
<P>As to mine and HOMEGROUND's role in gaffa, I hope it will be take part as
and  when we can. Our primary responsibility is to our subscribers - and though
they are  all to well aware of our tendency to be late, their patience is not
endless. I shouldn't  be here chatting when I should be typing articles. 
</P>
<P>This is the appropriate place to issue apologies for the lateness of issue
45. We  assumed that a compilation issue would be fairly simple to knock out.
Not so, it  actually took more work, care and attention than our usual issues.
It may be some  solace to those who waited with fading patience, that for about
ten days Krys was up  to the early hours of the morning struggling with the
layout. On at least two nights  we retired at gone 4am.

the list. Of course, many  hundreds or thousands more read via the USENET
newsgroup rec.music.gaffa; exact  numbers for same are not available. 
</P>
<P>Not exact numbers, but estimated ones. These can be found in the monthly 
usenet reports by Brian Reid (sp?) (newsgroup news.lists), the estimation is
done by  checking on a sample of a few hundred hosts how many subscribers of
each  newsgroup there are. 'Subscriber' does mean that the person in question
looked  into that newsgroup at least once during the time the samples are
collected. Looking  into the newsgroup is already done by just looking at some
subjects and not even  reading a single article. Another factor of uncertainity
is that noone knows the real  size of the net. Considering all this, we're
estimated with about 48000 readers right  now. Pretty impressive, but remember
that of these maybe 480 are posting at least  once a year. 
</P>
<P>I tried to do a small survey a while ago, posted it several times, and got &lt;80
 answers with answers from 'read once a month' to 'read dayly', and also 'post 
never' to 'post daily'. I should try another run of that survey, it's still
there. 
</P>
<P>&gt; I am reluctant to post a list of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>And with very good reason. Imagine you'd find out that there is a 
'kate@kent.uk' or so on there... and we are all speculating about bootlegs and
so on  ;-). Nope. Some want to stay lurkers and that's ok.

<BR> Subject: ** MOMENTS ** A Red Shoes Collection 
</P>
<P>Dear lovehounds, 
</P>
<P>This year I had a very restful and quiet holliday at the house of my
parents. The  weather was absolutely brilliant and I spent most of my time in
the wonderful  garden. I put up a table outside and installed a computer ('is
this boy completely  mad?'). Then I worked myself through the jungle of
1993/1994 lovehounds-mail to  find some Deeper Understanding ('he is!'). 
</P>
<P>Wow, and I finished everything in 3 weeks. The result is something I called:

</P>
<P><A HREF="../moments/index.html">Moments</A>
</P>
<P>         A Red Shoes Collection 
</P>
<P>and it contains everything I found interesting for me concerning &quot;The
Red  Shoes&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Initially I did this for my own purpose, only. But then I thought, maybe
you're  also interested, because all the stuff in the archive, the invaluable
Garden- and  Cloudbusting- files, ends ca. 1991. So maybe my collection fills a
gap. It is not THE  collection, but A collection. 
</P>
<P>I separated the mail in different categories. Mainly: a) TRS, b) anything
else  interesting, c) trash. The last item was the biggest one :-). I deleted
more than 3/4 of  everything. But the rest is really timeless and worth to be
collected. 
</P>
<P>The editing of the TRS-part is now finished and you can find it in the
archive on  ftp.uu.net in: /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/moments . 
</P>
<P>How I did it: 
</P>
<P>First I selected the interesting content and deleted the unneccesary parts
(longish  headers (Hello Graham!) and signatures (hello Graham! Your address is
not very  thrilling!). I left &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Subject&quot;.
I also deleted sometimes substantial  parts of the mail, if they were not
interesting (to me), repetitions or personal things.  I changed sometimes the
subject entry, to fit better to the actual subject. I also  corrected some
obvious spelling errors etc. I made a very few comments by myself,  they come in
[ ] with my short WIE in case of doubt. 
</P>
<P>Quotes were a little problem, because the &quot;&gt;&quot; signs are useless
after making up  the pages for grouped style. So, quotes are now started with a
&quot;&gt;&quot;, but not in front of  every line, only at the beginning of each
paragraph. The quote is separated from the  following statement, by a blank
line. 
</P>
<P>I ordered the mails in different categories: 
</P>
<P>1. History <BR> 1.1. Pre-History 
</P>
<P>1.2. Aspel <BR> 1.3. Tower <BR> 1.4. Convention '94 <BR> 1.5.
Misc./History 
</P>
<P>2. The Music <BR> 2.1. Lyrics <BR> 2.2. LH comments on songs <BR> 2.3. LH
comments on whole album 
</P>
<P>3. The Film <BR> 3.1. Videos <BR> 3.2. The original Story and Film <BR>
3.3. The Line, The Cross And The Curve 
</P>
<P>4. Words <BR> 4.1. The Interviews <BR> 4.2. Reviews <BR> 4.3. Charts
<BR> 4.4. Discography 
</P>
<P>5. Miscellaneous <BR> 5.1. The Man I Love <BR> 5.2. Sexual Healing <BR>
5.3. Frutopia 
</P>
<P>Everything is ca. 1.1 MB! Edited for printing it's ca. 400 pages (hui!). 
</P>
<P>Maybe not everything is complete, it just reflects my own preferences. For 
example, I am not so much interested in your 'best of' things and ratings, like:
&quot;Eat  the Music&quot;: C-, or &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;: B+ etc. I have
my own list in my head and  that's enough. 
</P>
<P>I also deleted: 
</P>
<P>- most of the Lily/Angel stuff, 'cause it gave no new inside into the
subject, as  Chris pointed out unsuccessfully in the very beginning. 
</P>
<P>- Sex and the 'Symbol' stuff: mainly abstruse theories. 
</P>
<P>If I skipped something, that should be definitely included, please tell me! 
Especially, if there are more interviews, please mail them to me and to the
group! 
</P>
<P>It's my sincere hope, that this imperfect medley helps somehow to a new, 
completely revised edition of The Garden. I think, it's a heavy burden on IED's 
shoulder. This is my little contribution. 
</P>
<P>It was very fascinating to walk through 2 years in 3 weeks. The end of 1993
was  the most interesting part: the release of TRS! We got new interviews (I
strongly  recommend IED's restored version of the Sunday Times interview by
Chrissy Iley)  and this magic day at NY Towers, very moving reviews by Doug,
IED, Deb Wentorf  and Jason Pascucci. Thank you very much! 
</P>
<P>1994 we had the Convention with very interesting reports. There was some 
discussion on the quiz. I think this is a matter of preparation! Were you really
well  prepared? I also noticed, that there was NOT ONE, who was upset about
Kate's  *short* appearance, not One! (In contrast to the unnecessarily enlarged
discussion in  Homeground. Peter!) The only thing lovehounds mentioned: there
was not enough  food! 
</P>
<P>4. Aug. 1994: Robert Lovejoy discovered the Fruitopia article, followed by
extensive  commercial watching. 
</P>
<P>Thank you all, for doing the work. IED and Andrew Marwick for the Garden 
and their prolonged efforts to keep you on the kateian track, Ron Hill for his 
Cloudbusting (both invaluable compilations!), Uli for his continuous
distribution of  information and all the people who hacked in the lyrics,
reviews and interviews.  Thank you! 
</P>
<P>Other things/people that attracted my special attention: 
</P>
<P>- IED: Still mysterious, but definetly no human being. &quot;Some groups
have a  moderator. We have an Enforcer. IED enforces the KaTe orthodoxy.
Whenever he's  away from the group (say, because Andrew Marvick is pursuing
something trivial  like a Ph.D.), the group begins to drift, become unruly, and
has less KaTe content.&quot;  (Andy Gough) 
</P>
<P>- Andrew Marwick = apostle Peter, head of the fundamentalist church of Kate 
Bush. KaTe is God (Amen!). It's unbelievable to me how he managed it to work on 
his doctoral thesis and do *on the side* all his investigations. Or was that
IED? 
</P>
<P>- stev0: &quot;The Line, the Cross, the Curve and Her Lover&quot; Master of
the Joke!  Some of his contributions are absolute masterpieces. &quot;If
Lovehounds is a game, I  win!&quot; You really should go professional! Give us
another one! 
</P>
<P>- Uli: distributor and editor of the holy FAQ. He also worked on THE 
discography: Out now! I comes on 12 CD's with a 1054 pages booklet. 
</P>
<P>- Jon-&quot;Eat the Music&quot; *still* sucks!-Drukman: a strong fighter,
with a warm  heart. But caution when you say something that provokes
contradiction. Jump behind  the lines when he rises. He and stev0 always carry
guns (and heavy-duty gaffa-tape)  and come in full metal jackets. Jon where are
you at the? 
</P>
<P>- Homeground-Peter: Good for short urgent HG-Towers-information, but 
generally more a taker. That's a great pity, because I think, he has so much to
give!  Maybe we should ask him more!!! Ooh, he has compiled a 15 pages
videolist! Haven't  seen it so far (Peeeeteer, helloohooo!). 
</P>
<P>- Vickie: Who discovered, that you have to break your earphones to get a 
complete inside into &quot;The Dreaming&quot;! (phase cancelation) 
</P>
<P>and: 
</P>
<P>-Brian J Dillard: &quot;I dropped my walkman last night and now it plays
backwards!  so I should have all sorts of wonderful new insights to share with
all of you very very  soon . . &quot; 
</P>
<P>- Chris: something like the answer-man of the group. I have found him not
the  least bit authoritarian, but always fair and fairly objective. With stoical
coolness he  answers all the questions, that come up every month or so. 
</P>
<P>- Karen Newcombe: Always at her place. IED says: &quot;She's, in his
opinion, the best  thing that's happened to Kate Bush fandom in AGES.&quot; 
</P>
<P>- Scott Telford: provider of the TRS-discography and many other front-line 
reports. 
</P>
<P>- Prof. Manchester, who educates us with his well-founded statements. 
</P>
<P>- Doug: the fabulous LH founder, |&gt;oug /\lan said: &quot;John Carder Bush
told me all  sorts of things that Kate would do her best to avoid talking about.&quot;
- Can you please  enlighten us!!! 
</P>
<P>And: 
</P>
<P>- for a while KaTe was pregnant! (unfounded rumour. VM)
</P>
<P>- 334 subscribers 13.5.94 
</P>
<P>- only once in these two years someone (in this music oriented group)
referred to  specified notes/keys : Jonathan Forward: &quot;When was the
inferior D,D,up an octave &amp;  F replaced by the much better D,C,F,D,Bflat,F?&quot;
(conc. DWBMA) - also only once  someone posted a GIF! 
</P>
<P>- we also have a Super-Dave! 
</P>
<P>- a Jorn&quot;All-I-wanted-was-a-Pepsi&quot;Barger 
</P>
<P>- a Marcel&quot;De Efteling is in Kaatsheuvel, not Amsterdam. Not even &quot;near&quot;
 Amsterdam&quot;Rijs 
</P>
<P>- Charlie Baum: the guy with the strangest story: his friend saw a Miami
Vice  episode with the &quot;Hello Earth&quot; piece in it. He instantly
recogniced it as a georgian  tune and taped it. Then he played it to Charles
(also a georgian music expert), who  tracked it down to KaTe and got hooked. So
BTW he brought this georgian subject  to our all attention. 
</P>
<P>- and: David Eugene Vinson: &quot;Can anybody out there confirm my
existence? Uli  doesn't believe in me, but I could swear that I have been around
since the end of  October. Have there been any confirmed sightings of me during
that time? I want to  live!!!!&quot; 
</P>
<P>After many &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;: There was this one really
irritating explosion  of madness: The Jorn-Chris/Vickie-Escalation. I had
prepared a long paragraph  about the whole thing, but I deleted it. This is just
a reminder for peace. 
</P>
<P>In general it was always very interesting to see, how people jump on one
train  and not on the other. Some mails have been left completely ignored, while
others  provoked intense monthlong discussions/flaming and all that. I couldn't
figure out  so far what this spice is, you have to include into your mail. I
therefore await eagerly,  on what point of this mail you will jump on! Also
people post long sermons of  stuff/nonsense and state at the end something like:
&quot;Unfortunately, this whole topic  is rather off charter. Let's not discuss
this any more.&quot; 
</P>
<P>To prove the usefulness of this group, just think of the tape-trees, the
T-shirt  project. etc. It's always very easy to bring up new ideas, but to put
them into  practice is a different thing. I also have to point out the great
real knowledge latent  available in this group. There is much blah-blah, but if
there is really need for an  answer, it will be given! 
</P>
<P>So, that was MH impression after 2 years lovehounds in 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>Okay, here it is. Do with it what you want!

</P>
<P>ObKate: I heartily recommend reading Wieland Willker's &quot;Moments&quot;,
a Best of  Lovehounds collection. Someone should go back and do one for the
earlier years, too  (in fact, Wieland did such a great job, I nominate him).
It's Lovehounds with the  flame wars - well, not gone but certainly toned down
(WAY down!), no &quot;What does  Gaffa mean&quot;?, and NO MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION
ADS!

<P>In case you didn't see his posting. (Someone should HTMLize this and put it
on a  Web page. If no one else volunteers, I could...) (I did! VM)

</P>
<P>&quot;If we define &quot;crap&quot; as being &quot;A piece of music so
increadibly wonderful that you  can never listen to any other piece of music
ever again since the other music would  pale by comparison&quot;, then I agree,
it is crap.&quot;
