<BR> Subject: Deciphering Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>This morning while driving to work and listening to &quot;Suspended in
Gaffa,&quot; an  idea occurred to me. I don't know if this would work, but maybe
it would... 
</P>
<P>What if you put the right and left channels of the recording, respectively,
into the  + and - inputs of an op-amp? If you varied the amplitude of the input
signals, it  seems to me that you would be able to cancel out various parts of
the recording, i.e.,  those parts that were of equal amplitude on both inputs. I
*think* you would also be  able to selectively cancel out even sounds that were
biased towards the right or the  left side; because if they appeared in the
other (less-dominant, say left) side at all,  you could make that side of equal
amplitude compared to the right side, cancelling it  out, and signals in the
left side that had formerly been of equal amplitude to the  right side would now
be of greater amplitude, and would thus reappear again  (possibly shifted 180
degrees in phase). 
</P>
<P>Has anybody ever tried this? Will it work? Any other signal processing ideas
that  might reveal what the small voices in the background are?

Suspended In Gaffa 
</P>
<P>Has anyone noticed that &quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot; can be interpreted as
being a song  about a girl scared to lose her virginity? I was out with some
friends last week and  we started discussing it, one of them said that it had to
do with gaining knowledge, I  dismissed that as being too general and said &quot;No,
there's got to be a specific point to  it.&quot; Here's what the debate
produced: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Out in the garden, there's half of a heaven&quot; 
</P>
<P>--The garden: a classic trysting place, symbol of nature and through the sex
act,  nature defiled. 
</P>
<P>&quot;we're only bluffing/we're not ones for busting through walls&quot; 
</P>
<P>--At this point, my friend who didn't see the sex angle immediately said &quot;Oh,
 NOW I see it!&quot; - busting through walls: representative of the tearing of
the hymen,  perhaps? 
</P>
<P>&quot;But they've told us unless we can prove/that we're doing it/ we can't
have it  all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>--The narrator never specifically mentions what &quot;it&quot; is, so being
the suspicious  little weasels we are, we make &quot;it&quot; equal &quot;sex&quot;.

</P>
<P>&quot;He's gonna wangle a way to get out of it&quot; 
</P>
<P>--This line gives me trouble; guys are usually gung-ho about sex, maybe this
one  has second thoughts, maybe he likes the woman too much. 
</P>
<P>&quot;She's an excuse/and a witness who'll talk when he's called&quot; 
</P>
<P>--Seems like she considers it rape, she'll betray the man when a nameless &quot;they&quot;
 catch up with him and put him on trial. 
</P>
<P>&lt;unless we can prove that we're doing it... etc&gt; 
</P>
<P>The chorus is revealing, too. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Suddenly my feet are feet of mud/It all goes slow-mo&quot; 
</P>
<P>--She's scared to do it, she doesn't want to submit, lose her virginity. 
Nervouseness, tension, are all evoked in this one line. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know why I'm crying/am I suspended in Gaffa?&quot; 
</P>
<P>--Well, you know the old cliche, the woman cries after losing her virginity
-  something that can never be reclaimed. If, as has been previously proposed,
the  word &quot;Gaffa&quot; is a corruption of &quot;Gaffe&quot; then she
obviously considers her submission  to be a mistake, and she's caught up in it.

</P>
<P>I'll try to cover the rest of the song at another point. Before I quit, have
you  noticed that of all those background messages, one of the most audible is &quot;I'm
 scared of the changes&quot;? Another argument for my case, I'd say. 
</P>
<P>Any counter or supportive arguments are welcome.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: The whispers
</P>
<P>&gt; Now, does anybody have any ideas as to what all the vocal samples in
the  background of &quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot; are saying? The only one
that's really obvious  to me is &quot;I'm scared of the changes&quot; which fits
in with my previously posted  interpretation of the song. 
</P>
<P>You've concocted a case, and an intriguing one at that. IED happens to think
that  your evidence is entirely circumstantial, and that Kate's own explanation
(admittedly  vague) explains things better, though not in any detail. Lines like
&quot;I'm scared of the  changes&quot; fit in with your interpretation, yes; but
they could fit in with practically any  interpretation imaginable.
Unfortunately, that's true of each specific example you  cite. But he admits
that you've concocted a case. As for specifics, IED has always  understood the
first line of the song to be a reference to Kate's old eight-track  home studio
in the little storage-building behind the main house at East Wickham  Farm (&quot;Out
in the garden there's half of a heaven...&quot;). At some point in her 
childhood that became Kate's private retreat, where she wrote many of her first 
songs on an old decaying spinet piano. She has referred to it a number of other
times  in her music, most explicitly in &quot;Under the Ivy&quot;. 
</P>
<P>There's nothing wrong with your interpretation. The problem is, in order for
a  new and challenging idea such as yours to gain real scholarly credence, it is
 necessary that it be supported by evidence that effectively explains away all
the  previous evidence that threatens your interpretation: you must explain why
Kate  specifies an entirely different interpretation, and why your
interpretation is MORE  plausible than hers or anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>The whispered lines, explained in the video as being questions asked by the 
character to her mother as a small child, are as follows: 
</P>
<P>(After first verse: &quot;I caught a glimpse of a god...All shiny and
bright.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(After second verse: &quot;Will I dream? Maybe...&quot; 
</P>
<P>(After third verse: &quot;Mother (can't remember). I'm scared of the
changes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, these were deciphered before the acquisition of a CD. You've
just  got to listen more obsessively, that's all!

</P>
<P>&gt; From: &quot;ROSSI J.A.&quot; &lt;rossi@nusc&gt; <BR> &gt; Subject:
Gaffa 
</P>
<P>This Kate gun, at least, refrains from dismissing the interp. out of hand:
it IS  interesting. Perhaps, however, it's also about time someone DID dig up
one of Kate's  own explanations of the song: 
</P>
<P>&quot;When I wrote this track the words came at the same time, and this is
one of the  few songs where the lyrics were complete at such an early stage. The
idea of the  song is that of being given a glimpse of &quot;God&quot; --
something that we dearly want --  but being told that unless we work for it, we
will never see it again, and even then,  we might not be worthy of it. Of
course, everybody wants the reward without the  toil, so people try to find a
way out of the hard work, still hoping to claim the prize,  but such is not the
case. The choruses are meant to express the feeling of entering  timelessness as
you become ready for the experience, but only when you are ready.&quot; 
</P>
<P>No doubt something could be made of her choice of language, especially her 
vague reference to &quot;the experience&quot;; but Kate has never been coy about
discussing  sex when it was relevant. So if sex was the true subject of the
song, it's unlikely that  she would have kept it such a secret --and even more
unlikely that she would have  offered a misleading alternate explanation such as
the one above (about work and  laziness and the search for nirvana, so to speak
-- roughly the same subject as &quot;Sat  In Your Lap&quot;). So, while IED for
one doesn't discount your hypothesis completely, it  has a long way to go before
attaining the status of doKTrine.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Suspended in Gaffa
</P>
<P>The following are a series of unconnected reflections on Matterse Katte 
Bushologicke which IED originally sent off to individual victims, mainly MarK T.
 Ganzer. This explains the author's peculiar (for him) references to a
non-existent  &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. Please disregard those. 
</P>
<P>Another idea or two, this time about &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I can't help thinking that all of the odd characters and images referred to
so  obliquely in the song are based on specific sources. The little girl
whispering in  between the verses could be &quot;Kate&quot; herself, as a child,
or at least a little girl very like  Kate talking to her mother after having
seen the &quot;vision&quot; -- or some kind of  experience of the divine. 
</P>
<P>So if the &quot;setting&quot; of the song, or the general orientation, is
more or less  autobiographical (it may please some of the Love-Hounds to hear
IED accepting this  possibility), and, specifically, based on some of Kate's
early childhood experiences,  then what if &quot;half of a heaven&quot; really
is a reference to Kate's own childhood barn  out &quot;in the bottom of our
garden,&quot; the place of the old broken-down organ which  was the home of
countless mice? I've never been entirely sure about this, but I  think that that
same old disused barn was later used as one of Kate's early demo  studios, where
she would have done some of her first musical creations. 
</P>
<P> Now, if that's an autobiographical detail, then what about &quot;And we're
only  bluffing, we're not ones for busting through walls&quot;? Wasn't Kate so
blown away by  Pink Floyd's The Wall that she felt that &quot;it had all been
said,&quot; or something like  that? Wouldn't that have been a perfect example
of &quot;catching a glimpse of God,&quot; (at  least for a musician like Kate,
who loved Pink Floyd so much) only to feel it beyond  her own reach? What do you
think? Too far-fetched? 
</P>
<P> The &quot;they&quot; who have &quot;told us unless we can prove that we're
doing it&quot; could be  Kate's teachers, warning that a true knowledge of God
(or maybe just satisfaction  from a job well done) can't be attained through any
shortcuts, right? So the &quot;he&quot;  and the &quot;she&quot; are people who
have taken shortcuts or escaped their responsibilities  to their art in some way
or other -- everyone has an excuse for failing to realise  their early
ambitions, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>Then couldn't the part about the &quot;plank in me eye&quot; be intended as
a kind of  joke? I mean, here the heroine of our song has been distracted by
this thing in her  eye (an awfully vivid image for what is mainly a reference to
a couple of old sayings),  and her reaction is to &quot;thank you for yanking me
back to the fact that there's  always something to distract&quot;. Now, isn't
that a perfect description of Kate's attitude  in interviews? Here she is in the
song forcing herself, disciplining herself to &quot;see the  positive side,&quot;
see the lesson in what is after all a pretty horrible &quot;distraction&quot;: a
 plank in her eye! 
</P>
<P>If I follow her in the last verses, she's assuring &quot;them&quot; (God?
teachers?) that if  they allow her back into heaven, so to speak, or at least if
they give her a &quot;longer  look&quot; at God, she will not look into those
parts of divine existence that a still-living  person shouldn't see (such as her
future, people's private thoughts, foreknowledge  of life and death, etc.): &quot;Don't
worry, God,&quot; she might be saying, &quot;I won't get too  nosy! I only want
to experience that feeling again, that's all.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Also in the final verses, I've never been clear what or who Kate might be 
referring to when she talks about the &quot;girl in the mirror&quot;. Obviously
she means  herself (or the character in the song herself), but is it also a
reference to some  fictional &quot;girl in a mirror,&quot; such as Alice Through
the Looking-Glass? Help would be  greatly appreciated from you or from anyone
else who might still be reading. 
</P>
<P> [Perhaps &quot;that girl in mirror&quot; could possibly be a literary
allusion, but I doubt it.  It just makes perfect and complete sense without
having any additional overtones.  One's image in the mirror is widely known to
be focus for many people's worries  and self-doubt. As Kraftwerk sings, &quot;Even
the brightest stars, don't like what they  see in the looking glass.&quot; (Or
something like that.) Kate is clearly saying here that  her self-doubt often
gets in the way of her doing the things she wants to do. -- |&gt;oug]

<P>take care.

&lt;AGOUGH%F6ACC1@sc.intel.com&gt; <BR> Subject: Suspended in Gaffa &amp;
religious allusion 
</P>
<P>Reading some of the interpretations of &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;
something jumped  out at me that apparently has been missed by everyone else. 
</P>
<P>Given that &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; is about a desire to see God
(which, by the way,  would be fatal to a human because of our state of
sin--God's image would be turned  into his wrath against us; Moses did see God's
back once, though), then the two  lines: 
</P>
<P>It's a plank in me eye 
</P>
<P>With a camel who's trying to get through it 
</P>
<P>are clearly allusions to the New Testament. First, &quot;It's a plank...&quot;
refers to the  statement Jesus made, &quot;Do not point out the splinter in your
neighbor's eye when  you have a beam in your own.&quot; I.e., don't point out
the petty sins of others when you  have even greater ones. Obviously, the plank
is the beam. The difference may be due  to Bible translations (beam is from the
New American Standard translation--the  King James could be different). That or
Kate liked plank better. 
</P>
<P>The second, &quot;With a camel who's...&quot; also refers to a statement of
Jesus, when He  said, &quot;It's harder for a rich man to get into Heaven that
it is to thread a Camel  through the eye of a needle.&quot; (Not that it's
impossible for a rich man to get in, but  being cutoff from daily need, it is
more difficult). 
</P>
<P>The two lines together, along with the allusions, would indicate that Kate's
 failure to see God is due to her state of sin--sin is what is holding her back.

</P>
<P>Just an idea...,

<P>The following, IED believes, strongly supports his theory that the studio
referred  to in Suspended in Gaffa -- if indeed the &quot;half of a heaven&quot;
in &quot;the garden&quot; is a  reference to any studio at all -- is the
primitive demo studio of Kate's earliest days,  in other words the same
outbuilding that the young Cathy used to escape to as a  child. Certainly this
passage from the Swales interview makes it every bit as likely  that the half of
a heaven is a symbol of her youth as otherwise. 
</P>
<P>Does it sometimes happen, then, that you resurrect songs years later, like
perhaps  any of those hundreds you wrote as a teenager?

</P>
<P>I hate to throw a wrench into the Suspended in Gaffa debate, but as I
remember  my studies of British folklore, some people in the 18th and 19th
centuries believed  that people passed from the world of the living into the
world of the dead via the  path in their garden. Therefore, the way to heaven
(even half-a-one) was by going  &quot;out in the garden.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I think we can all agree that this is not what Kate meant by this reference,
but  since she, herself, claimed the song is about a person encountering the
Divine --  who knows? And I thought it was interesting...

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Suspended in Gaffa 
</P>
<P>As for |&gt;oug's latest volley in the Gaffa Wars, it sounds more and more
as though  his and IED's interpretations are perhaps not so far apart as they
seem. |&gt;oug's  description of the earliest KT songs' having been composed &quot;at
her house&quot; is based  on the same imprecise source information as IED's
description of their locus of  composition as &quot;an early outbuilding on the
Farm's grounds&quot;. The fact is that no one  has ever made it truly clear
exactly which building was the location of which songs'  creation, nor how early
on in her career Kate began making recordings of her work.  It seems very
unlikely, however, that she was not making some form of tape  recording of her
songs almost from the very earliest months of her creativity (i.e.,  from as
early as 1969 or 1970). IED would be rather surprised, in fact, if Kate was not 
routinely tape recording her songs in a building on the Farm grounds from the
age  of twelve or thirteen. 
</P>
<P>Whether they were recorded on tape or not, however, is not the main issue.
IED  has merely been trying, all along, to point out that the song Suspended in
Gaffa may  be another in Kate's long series of songs about (or at least in some
way reflecting)  childhood. There are at least three reasonably solid pieces of
evidence to support  such a theory: first, the words heard in between verses,
which are spoken in a  deliberately childlike voice, and which include the line
&quot;Mummy, where are the  angels? I'm scared of the changes&quot;; second, the
actual presence of Kate's mother in  the video, whom Kate embraces in an obvious
reference to the child's refuge in its  mother's protective embrace; and third
and most importantly, Kate's singling out of  Suspended as a song that contains
the kernels of musical ideas from one of her  earliest &quot;200-odd&quot;
songs. 
</P>
<P>As IED has all along admitted, these points don't constitute &quot;hard
evidence&quot;, but  they are certainly suggestive enough to create a &quot;reasonable
doubt&quot; about |&gt;oug's  dogmatic insistence that &quot;half of a heaven&quot;
must and can only be a reference to the  eight-track studio of Kate's post-&quot;Wuthering
Heights&quot; years. It is still amazing to  IED that |&gt;oug can be so certain
about the accuracy of his interpretations. There just  isn't enough evidence to
be so confident one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>[Again you misquote me, IED. I never, ever said that &quot;half of a heaven&quot;
can &quot;only  be&quot; a reference to Kate's 8-track studio. I only said that
it *is* a reference to Kate's  8-track studio. This interpretation is merely one
meaning among the many it may  have. -- |&gt;oug ]

eh? Gets  worse.... &quot;Half of a heaven&quot; means that the couple in
question cannot commit, as one  of them is married. &quot;we're only bluffing,
we're not ones for busting through walls&quot;  is the discression of their
meetings. They've been very careful, so careful that they  need to prove their
infidelities in order to get the divorce (&quot;unless we can prove that  we're
doing it we can't have it all,&quot;). I believe that at one time in England the
only  way to get a divorce was to have to prove in court that your spouse had
been  unfaithful by producing the actual lover in court, or, at the very least,
some  witnesses (&quot;who'll talk when he's called) to the infidelities. 
</P>
<P>The rest of the song is less clear, but it seems to be focussed on the fears
of this  woman. She loves him, but there will be scandal. Is she doing the right
thing, being  the party of this man's divorce (&quot;he's gonna wangle a way to
get out of it&quot;)? She  isn't even involved at this point, as they have
another woman willing to be held as  the actual lover (&quot;she's an excuse&quot;)
in court. But in the meantime, they are going to  have to be separated until the
whole thing is over, to keep her name out of the mud,  and she is having her
doubts about the whole thing. She vacillates between wanting  it all and bouts
of tears and self-exploration. She's in this thing way over her head,  and hates
herself for doubting the relationship and her reasons behind it. (Forgive  me
for not backing all this up with quotes-- I'm at work and don't have my copy of 
&quot;The Dreaming&quot; just sitting next to me.) 
</P>
<P>Ok, crucify me now. But I feel, somehow, this works on at least one level of
Kate  interpretation. And, if any of you agree with me on this one, I think it
shows that  there is never one single way of interpreting a song (unless it's by
Tiffany!). Kate's  lyrics are too much like poetry to ever be subject to a
single set of rules.

Subject: Suspended in Gaffa 
</P>
<P> I have been watching with interest the conversation regarding the meanings
of  &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;. Despite what has been said before, this is
the interpretation  that I attach to it. Perhaps it has been said before, then
again perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>To me SiG represents a persons struggle to be what they want to be in life.
Thus  the continuous &quot;I want it all&quot;, and &quot;she can't have it all&quot;.
The chorus is about the  feeling that one has when one is trying to make their
way through life, do the best  they can, and everything seems to be against
them. Everything is slow, nothing gets  done or happens fast. It feels like all
creativity and ability are tied up - suspended in  gaffa. How would you feel
trying to do something, suspended from a ceiling by gaffa  tape. Uncomfortable
I'm sure. And gaffa tape is so damn sticky and strong. 
</P>
<P>In some ways the 2nd verse echos &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot;. The whole idea
of seeming  to get somewhere, but in truth being at the start all over again.
Thus the &quot;pull out  the plank and say thank you for yanking me back to the
fact that there's always  something to distract...&quot; Perhaps it's just the
way I feel at the moment, in some sort  of boring limbo, but that's the way the
song comes over to me. 
</P>
<P>[ |&gt;oug agrees with you exactly, and this is always been the meaning he
has  associated with the song. He also thinks that theme of the lyrics is very
similar to  &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;. It's good to see that there is another
sane person out there! --  |&gt;oug ]

</P>
<P> &gt; ...as to offer an interpretation of &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot;
that no one has yet  presented during my brief time on the mailing list? Yes, I
admit it's rather  superficial, and you will all strip the flesh from my bones
for it, but I feel compelled  to say my piece. 
</P>
<P>-- Lizooshka 
</P>
<P> Not IED. He likes your interpretation. It's really brilliant, and it seems
to work  consistently all the way through the song. IED is not yet convinced
that Kate actually  had that story in mind when she wrote it, but he has to
admit that he has no way of  proving it one way or the other. Extremely clever,
Lizooshka. The only problem is in  the many little details in the song which,
while not militating against your  interpretation, don't exactly seem to
re-inforce it, either. In the past, when a Kate  song's narrative source has
been solidly identified, all the pieces seem suddenly to  drop right into place,
so to speak -- Cloudbusting is a perfect example, in which  there isn't a single
sound or word that doesn't deal directly and plainly with A  Book of Dreams, or
Kate's interpretation of it (while naturally allowing for a  number of broader
associations, as well). At least as you have described your  interpretation
here, that &quot;falling into place&quot; doesn't seem to have happened yet. 
</P>
<P>Still, the more he considers it, the more plausible it sounds. IED wonders
if the  song isn't in fact illustrating a specific book (or story or painting,
etc.). &quot;Gaffa&quot;  might just refer to something -- or someplace -- quite
particular, which appears in  some text or other. 
</P>
<P>IED doesn't know whether the song must necessarily be dealing with a
divorce,  per se. Couldn't the story work with other, more straightforward
romantic  situations, as well? But what's really attractive about your idea is
that, looked at in  such a light, the song tells a story. And it was the absence
of narrative that always  made Suspended in Gaffa seem such an anomaly in Kate's
work, and that made it so  resistant to a single, integrated reading. Your way
of looking at it opens up a whole  new range of possibilities.

<P>Fellas, fellas, fellas--this is *not* a boxing ring. I get the feeling that
Doug  (forgive me, I'm using a Mac and can't figure out how you get the first
part of your  foofy &quot;D&quot;) and IED are drawing blood here. That is not
why we are here, kids. 
</P>
<P>Let Auntie Lizooshka share a little story with you. How many of you have
read A  Farewell to Arms ? Ok, you can put your hands down now. Anyone who has
read  this book can see that every time something horrible happens, it is
raining. Now, a  good interpreter would say that rain is a symbol of death or
sorrow or something of  the like. But--when someone asked Hemingway about it,
apparently to get the  straight dope, he replied, &quot;It just meant that it
rained, dammit!!&quot; Now, we can all  learn from this that what the author
says about a work, especially a symbolic one,  cannot be taken at sheer face
value because of the way a work is open to the views  of many minds. OK? So
maybe Gaffa means gaffer's tape. Kate said so, right? Well,  according to a
friend of mine whose knowledge of Auntie Kate would put most of  you to shame,
she *also* said that it meant &quot;an error in discression,&quot; which is a 
meaning she got from the OED. (He says she discusses this on a picture disk
which  has her in a red dress with a bass.) 
</P>
<P>OK? Ok. I feel much better.

</P>
<P>Well, Lizooshka, it's not like I don't trust your friend or anything, but
over the  years I have heard many statements about Kate Bush from many people
who claim  to know enough about Kate Bush to put everyone else to shame. Let's
see if I can  remember a few.... One was that Clare Tory (the female singer who
sings &quot;Great  Gig in the Sky&quot; on *Dark Side of the Moon*) is really
Kate Bush. Now, when *Dark  Side of the Moon* was recorded, Kate Bush was all of
fourteen, and her voice  certainly didn't sound anything like that of Clare
Tory. Another one was that Kate  Bush died in a car accident while delivering
her finished tapes for her new album to  the record company. This one I heard
before *Hounds of Love* came out. Can you  find all the secret messages that
prove that Kate is dead on *Hounds of Love*? It's  clear she's been replaced by
an imposter. Another good one I heard was that the  reason Kate's albums take so
long, and the reason she blimps-out between albums is  because she gets pregnant
and has a child inbetween each album. 
</P>
<P>Now, Lizooshka, I own and have listened to the picture disk, which has a
picture  on it from one of Kate's TV performances of &quot;Babooshka&quot; (in
the red dress, with a  bass), and I can assure you that nowhere on it does she
mention &quot;Gaffa&quot;, &quot;gaffe&quot;, or  anything of the sort. Perhaps
she does on a picture disk that I don't have, but I tend  to doubt it. Why in
the world would Kate mention the OED at all? It's not like  &quot;gaffe&quot; is
an unusual or exotic word. If she had meant &quot;gaffa&quot; to mean the usual 
definition of &quot;gaffe&quot;, she would have just said that. There'd be no
reason to mention  the OED at all.... 
</P>
<P>Q: So, Kate, what's this &quot;Gaffa&quot; stuff? 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well, I was browsing through the OED one day, and I stumbled across
this  neato word, &quot;gaffe&quot;. I bet you've never heard of it, have you?
It means &quot;an error in  discretion&quot;, and I thought that it was such a
neat and exotic sounding word that I just  had to use it one of my songs. I
changed the &quot;e&quot; to an &quot;a&quot; just to confuse people.  That was
clever of me, don't you think? 
</P>
<P>This just doesn't make mush sense, now does it? 
</P>
<P>If your friend can find me a picture disk that *really* does have something
about  &quot;gaffe&quot; on it, I would be more than willing to believe.

</P>
<P>As I remember from working as a roadie, we used gaffa for everything, and
the  word was used both as a substantive and a verb. 'Hey you, gaff this cable
to the  wall'. 
</P>
<P>Now, Kate hears this word from her roadies/technicians all the time and asks
 what it stands for; &quot;Oh, it's just a kind of tape&quot;. She probably
assumed it was a  *brand*, not slang. Thus she capitalized it. 
</P>
<P>To our friends in England; please contact a musician/roadie and ask what
'gaffa'  stands for! 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, Kate capitalizes all kinds of substantives in some
lyrics. Look  at The Dreaming for example; Kanga, Devils, Ore are all
capitalized. &quot;Big Sky&quot; is also  capitalized in The Big Sky. I don't
think that is refered to as a brand...

too.  That's why we like Kate !

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU <BR> Subject: Can we settle this thing?
Probably not. 
</P>
<P> First off IED would like to thank |&gt;oug for altering his format for
rebuttals. In  the long run it benefits the persuasive potential of both his and
IED's arguments,  since each is printed in toto, and has the chance to sway the
readership (if there  actually is any at this point, which is highly doubtful)
in its own way and at its own  pace. 
</P>
<P>Second, meeting his side of the bargain, IED will try to be briefer than
normal,  which means he won't go answering each point of |&gt;oug's. 
</P>
<P>Third, it would seem silly for IED to deny the power of |&gt;oug's most
recent  argument. Obviously &quot;Gaffa&quot; is sometimes used as a term for &quot;gaffer's
tape&quot;. When  IED said that it was possible that it meant something else, he
should have made it  clear that the use of the name &quot;Gaffa&quot; left the
door open for additional,  supplementary interpretations, but not exclusive
alternative interpretations. IED still  has seen nothing from you or anyone else
that would preclude the possibility that  Kate deliberately used the term in a
way that gives it a kind of implied place  function. (As |&gt;oug likes to say
as a defense of his interpretations of Kate's songs  even after they've been
repudiated by Kate herself: &quot;Yeah, but it still makes sense!  &quot;) 
</P>
<P>Fourth, |&gt;oug has still offered no conclusive evidence for his
interpretation of the  line &quot;Out in the garden there's half of a heaven.&quot;
IED is still waiting to see if |&gt;oug  catches on to the other quite different
interpretation of the whole reference to the  &quot;garden&quot; in Kate's
songs, but so far |&gt;oug seems caught up in the &quot;8-track studio&quot; 
interpretation. However, IED is feeling appropriately humble today, what with
his  recent humiliation at |&gt;oug's most recent posting, so he won't come out
and say  8-tracks couldn't possibly figure into it...maybe they do. One thing's
for sure about  that line, though, |&gt;oug--it has another meaning as well, and
a quite specific one. IED  has recently come into a bit of knowledge (about
another related KT song) which  has reminded him once again about the depth,
obscurity and inaccessibility of Kate's  use of some symbolic objects and places
in her lyrics. Since it's not directly relevant  to this subject he won't go
into it here, but it leaves him in no doubt that a lot more  is probably going
on in songs like &quot;Suspended&quot; than either |&gt;oug or IED is aware of. 
</P>
<P>Fifth, IED believes he may be able to track down Kate's comments on the term
 &quot;Gaffa&quot; himself, so there's no need to make a bet on it--he hasn't
found it yet, but  it looks as though |&gt;oug may be right about that, too.
Again, however, Kate's  explanation of that term--as with most of the other
intriguing words in her recent  lyrics--tends only to unravel the outermost
layer of mystery surrounding it, and by  no means exposes the roots to the air.

</P>
<P>Humbled but unvanquished, 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick 
</P>
<P> P.S.: How do you like that? After writing the above, in which IED suggested
that  &quot;Gaffa&quot; -- as capitalized by Kate -- might also be intended to
serve some kind of  place function, I now read in the latest Love-Hounds Digest
a note from Craig Polson  (thank you very much, Craig!) a possible specific
support of just this very point ! So  &quot;Gaffa&quot; is a Japanese term for a
useless, miserable place, eh?? How do you like that,  |&gt;oug??? And don't say
you can't see how Kate would know of such a Japanese  term. We both know the
extent of a certain Bush's involvement in that culture. 
</P>
<P>(Newly gloating, IED signs off for now...)

<P>Well, I'm sure if you asked Kate about all this symbolism mumbo jumbo, she'd
 say it was all balderdash. I'm sure it's all there, but it may be just because
Kate  tends to use words that are rich with symbolism, or it may be unconscious,
or it may  be as John Carder Bush says, that Kate speaks with the voice of the
Oneness  because she is just a little bit closer to God than the rest of us, or
it may be that Kate  puts all these things into her songs, and refuses to tell
anyone about it, because that  would be giving it away. 
</P>
<P>I, for example, thought I found all sorts of symbolism in &quot;Under The
Ivy&quot;.  There's ivy. There's a garden. There's a white rose. I ask Kate
about all this  wonderful, deep, rich, lush, layered symbolism, and what does
Kate say? She says  basically, &quot;No, it's just a song about two people
sneaking into the back yard to fuck&quot;.  Well, IED, I think that you have to
face the fact that if you asked her any questions  about your notions of
symbolism, she'd probably say the same thing. 
</P>
<P>In any case, now I look for the fucking first, and save the deep symbolism
for  later.

</P>
<P>I would like to add something to the GAFFA-files. 'Gaffen' as a german word 
means 'watching, looking', but in a dumb, inactive and non-understanding way, so
 'Suspended in Gaffa' could possibly mean 'being in a state of inactivity where
you  can see, but not act'. Someone who is 'gaff'-ing is a 'Gaffer' (in german),
and the  german ending '-er' is usually pronounced in the same way as '-ea' or
'-a', so  that 'Gaffer' becomes 'Gaffa'. The capital letter is the german way of
indicating a  noun.

</P>
<P>A couple of days ago a friend, also a graduate student, came up to me and
said,  &quot;I've heard about Kate Bush from you sometimes, so I decided to
check her out. I  got The Sensual World through the CBS record club, and I like
it quite a bit. I'd like  to hear more.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;You've come to the right person,&quot; I thought. 
</P>
<P>Tonight I brought all the other albums over to his house, as well as the
videos  The Whole Story and The Sensual World. He seemed to be very interested;
he  asked if he could borrow my albums. If he follows a pattern very familiar to
all of  us, he'll soon be hooked. Once Kate has grabbed you, there's no turning
back. 
</P>
<P>Anyway, after I showed him the videos I wanted to demonstrate the obscurity
of  some of Kate's lyrics. What's the perfect song for that? &quot;Suspended In
Gaffa,&quot; of  course, especially since it's also one of my favorites. So I
played the song while he  looked at the lyrics sheet so he could understand the
words, at least. Then I asked  him, &quot;What do you think it's about?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's about writing your Ph.D. thesis,&quot; he said. &quot;All
those lines about  having your feet stuck in the mud, and going in slo-mo.&quot;

</P>
<P>So I told him what Kate has said in interviews, about how it's analogous to
the  Roman Catholic idea of seeing God, but then never being able to see him
again. &quot;So,  it's sort of about reaching for something that you can never
have.&quot; 
</P>
