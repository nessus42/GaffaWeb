<BR> Subject: Wuthering Heights 
</P>
<P>So no one seems to be excited about the new version of Wuthering Heights.
I'll  admit it, I listen to The Kick Inside as much as I listen to the sacred
Dreaming and  the blessed Hounds of Love. Since Kate's voice has deepened and
matured I have  been wondering if this was a shift down in her vocal range or if
she could still hit  those high &quot;Heathcliff&quot;'s with ease. I was glad
(and amazed) to see (hear) that she  can still do it with ease (except one &quot;Heathcliff&quot;
seems a bit strained). But now she  can sing those low &quot;wuthering&quot;'s
with ease, too. I think this latest version is far  superior vocally to the TKI
version and shows just how amazing and unique Kate is  in the pop (gasp!) music
world. She also showed her satisfaction with her  interpretation of the original
version by not changing the phrasing and inflection.

<P>Ed Simpson writes &quot;no one seems excited about the new Wuthering Heights&quot;
(or  something similar, unfortunately this rotting computer is completely
incapable of  pasting other people's mail into your own) 
</P>
<P>Anyway, I think it's fantastic. What a range! When I bought my X4 single, I 
played side one and said &quot;neat.&quot; then played side two and totally
flipped out.  Definitely a step in the right direction, even if it is a fairly
mild pop song. But boy  can she hit those highs! 
</P>
<P>Oh, and I seem to recall seeing a few other letters in the past saying how 
wonderful the new mix is. Can't paste 'em in, unfortunately.

<P>Date: Mon, 24 Nov 86 15:10 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU <BR> Subject: re No talk about the new
WH version 
</P>
<P>Checking through his L-H files IED was surprised to discover that Ed is
right --  scarcely a word has been contributed to the Digest in reference to the
new  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. This, however, does not, let Ed be assured,
indicate that little is  thought of it. In fact, IED agrees that the new version
is extremely fine and,  although perhaps less poignantly wistful in tone (the
original was a remarkably  effective match of a tragic adolescent love story
with a uniquely  pre-adolescent-seeming vocal style), it shows greater vocal
power and more assured  performance style. And Ed is absolutely correct that it
&quot;shows just how amazing and  unique Kate is&quot;. Bravo, Ed! 
</P>
<P>&gt; She also showed her satisfaction with her interpretation of the
original version  by not changing the phrasing and inflection. 
</P>
<P>Although the basic sound is similar, there are, at the very least, three
significant  changes in phrasing. As for changes in inflection, virtually every
word has been  altered in some degree from its parallel in the original version.
Incorporated are  several new decorative turns in Kate's latest interpretation
that reflect her recent  resurgence of interest in Celtic musical styles. The
best sign that Kate still approves  of the earlier version (in a general sense)
is that she has retained the same  instrumental recording, merely allowing a
more epic sound-area to be introduced in  the re-mixing stage. Ian Bairnson's
beautiful guitar solo is still highlighted and left  essentially intact. 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, those to whom the song's rhythmic intricacies have always been
dear  are urged to listen carefully to the remixed drum track in the last minute
of the new  version. Not only has the coda/fade-out been extended by a full
thirty seconds  (presumably to allow for Kate's new ad lib vocals), but a
three-measure passage  from the original coda, wherein the drummer loses his
count and misses his snare  upbeat, has been corrected through splicing. Seeing
as how virtually no-one has ever  noticed the original mistake, this careful
correction stands as still further proof of  the unparalleled level of Kate's
perfectionism. 
</P>
<P>&gt; I was glad (and amazed) to see (hear) that she can still do it {sing
the high  notes} with ease (except one &quot;Heathcliff&quot; seems a bit
strained). 
</P>
<P>The strained &quot;Heathcliff&quot; is an interpretive touch, and not in any
way indicative of  a decline in vocal range. Kate has many times said that
during the period 1977/1979  she had a &quot;whim&quot; to use her &quot;falsetto&quot;,
or to sing in her &quot;highest  range&quot;. The strain you hear is a result of
her wish to communicate stronger drama to the music. Prior  to the recording of
The Kick Inside Kate sang in her natural, more or less  mezzo-soprano register.
&quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;Passing Through Air&quot; demonstrate well that  her
original vocal range was quite the same as the range she uses in, for example, 
&quot;Experiment IV&quot;. There is no indication that her physical vocal
make-up has  narrowed in any way, only that her taste has changed. 
</P>
<P>Conversely, there are many places in Hounds of Love where she sings notes as
 high as any in The Kick Inside. 
</P>
<P>&gt; But now she can sing those low &quot;wuthering&quot;'s with ease, too. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately this observation implies another slight misconception. Of
course Ed  is right to say that Kate could sing as low as she did in the
original version. In point  of fact, however, in the new version she doesn't .
If you compare the two again,  you'll notice that in the original version the
two syllables 'wu-' and '-ther-' are  sung as a rising fifth, whereas in the new
version both notes are the same -- higher  in pitch than the 'wu-' syllable in
the original. The impression produced by the  new vocal is, however, certainly
that of a deeper vocal range. This is, again, the  result of Kate's interpretive
decisions, but not of lower notes.

wuthering heights, again. 
</P>
<P>Well a big *bleah* to those who think that the new Wuthering Heights dies in
 comparison with the original. I *have* heard the original, albeit not as much
and not  as recently as I have heard the new mix, but I still like the new one
better. The vocal  tone seems purer and *I* happen to like the guitar at the
end. I could pull an IED  and say that they are two separate entities (&quot;apples
and oranges&quot;) and therefore not  comparable, but I don't believe that. And
(just to stir up controversy) it WASTES  Experiment IV, which is not, contrary
to popular belief, the universe, but merely a  small section of Hoboken, NJ.
There are several songs on &quot;The Dreaming&quot; which  blow Experiment IV
into microdust (although the lyrics ARE nice)... And whaKT's  wiKTh all KThis KT
sKTuff anyway??
