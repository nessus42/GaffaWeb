<P>KT Rumour: 
</P>
<P>IED has been told that Kate Bush is an active guest-musician on several
tracks of  Roy Harper's &quot;new&quot; album. Unfortunately IED's source is not
a knowledgeable  Kate fan, nor did he remember the title of the album, but he
says Kate's voice is  unmistakable. He says she sings and plays keyboards on
several tracks, but that only  Paddy Bush is actually credited in the album's
liner-notes. Kate herself is identified  only as --&quot;Jackie Turnip&quot;! 
</P>
<P>IED will, with any luck, be able to hear the CD of this album sometime this 
week, but in the meantime any clarification from Roy Harper afficionados would
be  much appreciated.

</P>
<P>Andy Tucker writes that he had heard some rumours that Kate Bush will appear
 on Midge Ure's forthcoming solo-album. He wants to know if this is true. Well,
I  don't know, but what I know is this: In 1985, when Midge Ure released his
first  solo-album, &quot;THE GIFT&quot;, he said that he would very much like to
work with Kate  Bush on his next solo-album. So, I will not be surprised if
she's on that album.

<P>In other news, Midge Ure's lead-off single to his forthcoming second solo
album  has been released in 7&quot; and 12&quot; vinyl formats. IED has not
determined yet whether  Kate is featured on any of the 12&quot;'s three tracks,
but the album is due at any  moment.

<BR> Subject: Review 
</P>
<P>I have now heard a song called &quot;Sister and Brother&quot;, taken from
Midge Ure's  forthcoming solo-album, due for release on August 29. &quot;Sister
and Brother&quot; is the  song in which Kate Bush appears. I heard it at the
record company a couple of days  ago, and I'm sure that all you Love-Hounds will
be interested in a review, so here  goes: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Sister and Brother&quot;, Midge Ure with Kate Bush, taken from Midge
Ure's  forthcoming solo-album &quot;Answers&quot;: 
</P>
<P>I have only heard it once, but I was immediately impressed. I have a feeling
that  this is the type of song that becomes more and more interesting every time
one  hears it. It is strong, powerful, overwhelming, interesing and exciting. 
</P>
<P>First there's a sequence with only Midge Ure singing. 
</P>
<P>Then there's a sequence with only Kate Bush singing. 
</P>
<P>Then there's a sequence where they sing together. 
</P>
<P>And, there's an instrumental sequence which is quite influenced by Kate
Bush's  style. All in all it is a fantastic song, you should be looking forward
to it!

<BR> Subject: Review: Sister &amp; Brother 
</P>
<P>Went into Our Price this weekend and invested in the new Midge Ure long 
player; primarily because of Sister &amp; Brother, not because I'm a particular
fan of the  chap. 
</P>
<P>It's not too bad, a wee bit too obviously &quot;crafted&quot; in places,
often you can guess  he's sat back and listened to the mix to see what twiddly
noise he can overlay next.  Kate's duet is quite acceptable, hardly another
Waking The Witch, concept very  much in the Don't Give Up mould, lots of good,
powerful KT-screams (dig those  &quot;OH-NO&quot;s). 
</P>
<P>The inner bad credits mention that Kate's vocals were engineered by Del and
I  guess her usual production values show there. 
</P>
<P>Brother: I am equal to / All a man can do / I am your sister 
</P>
<P>Brother: If you need me here / In you doubt and fear / I'll be your sister 
</P>

<P>from the latest (32nd) issue of &quot;Homeground&quot;: 
</P>
<P>There are no plans to release Midge Ure's duet with Kate, &quot;Sister and
Brother&quot;,  as a single. (By the way, the album, &quot;Answers to Nothing&quot;,
bombed royally, if the  first three weeks' UK chart listings are anything to go
by. Same with the lead-off  single.)

(Pravin Kumar) <BR> Subject: KaTe is on Midge Ure's new album 
</P>
<P>Midge was interviewed on WFNX in Boston on Wednesday morning. I detest the 
morning disk jockey on 'FNX (actually I detest 'FNX - I say, move WHFS from DC 
to Boston, but that's another story), but Midge was so interesting that I had to
listen.  The song &quot;Sister and Brother&quot; is pretty damn good. It has
Kate Bush, Robin and Ali  Campell from UB40, the bass player from Level 42 (Mark
&lt;somebody&gt;) and others. I  think Midge also played live during the
interview, but I missed that part. I'm  definitely looking forward to the album.

</P>
<P>Apparently Midge met Kate at a social event and passed on a tape of the song
to  her and told her that he'd like her to participate. She called him back a
couple of  days later and said that she was very moved by the song and that
she'd do it, but he  had to send her all the tapes, and that she'd add her
vocals herself. She then called  Midge back a week later and told him that she
was finished, and (of course) Midge  was blown away. 
</P>
<P>By the way, for all those folks with enquiring minds that want to know,
Midge is  actually the phonetic spelling of Jim backwards. His name is really
Jim Ure.  According to Midge, one of the first bands he played on, already had a
Jim, and since  his name was also Jim, they named him Midge. Ure is a
traditional Scottish name. 
</P>
<P>Disclaimer: I was driving around listening to the interview in my car, and
most of  the text above is from memory.
