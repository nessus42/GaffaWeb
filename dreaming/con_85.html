      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: con 85 and video party </P>
    
    <P>IED has been asked to say a word or two about the &quot;last&quot;
      official KT convention. IED did not attend that one. In 1986, following
      the hugely successful 1985 convention which IED did attend (along with
      your Humble Pseudo-Moderator Doug Alan and about 400 other dediKated
      fans), Homeground organized what they called a &quot;video party&quot; in
      a club in Argyle St. in London. Unfortunately the club was overpacked with
      fans who had somehow learned that Kate herself would be attending, and as
      a result that party turned into something of a fiasco--Kate ended up
      sitting at a tiny table signing an endless stream of album covers, etc.,
      there was near-pandemonium, and few fans had a good time. </P>
    
    <P>IED's experience at the 1985 convention was, in contrast, very positive
      indeed. It occurred in November, at the Dolphin Centre in Romford, a
      suburb of London. There was no over-crowding, as only those who had bought
      tickets in advance showed up; and there was no rushing of Kate or
      excessive album-signing, because everyone had cleverly been led to believe
      that Kate would &quot;probably not attend&quot; the convention. When at
      the very end Kate did turn up onstage, the whole group went wild with
      excitement, rushed en masse to the foot of the stage, and then held their
      breath to hear Kate thank everyone for coming, and to watch her as she was
      presented with a platinum album for HoL. It was a great moment. </P>
    
    <P>Before Kate's appearance, however, lots of other fun things happened:
      there were two rounds of a Kate Bushology Quiz, conducted by Peter
      FitzGerald-Morris, the Dean of Kate Bushology (who wore a cap and gown
      from H.G.U.). Our Pseudo-Moderator actually participated in the first
      round, sitting onstage and answering the questions with his usual deftness
      and aplomb. </P>
    
    <P>There was a slide show, during which a tape of a then-exclusive
      interview with Kate was heard (this was the Capital Radio interview of
      1985, conducted by Tony Myatt and since posted in Love-Hounds). There were
      door-prizes, including one of Kate's gold albums and Del Palmer's Tour of
      Life leather jacket (presented by Del). There was a lot of official KT
      merchandise on sale in a back room, as well as a good deal of unofficial
      KT trading among the crowd. (One person had at least fifty different KT
      badges on his person, many of which were for sale; and Scott Shepard, an
      American fan, had brought a big case full of posters to peddle.) </P>
    
    <P>There was a very interesting (though, unhappily, under-miked) interview
      with Kate's brothers Paddy and John Carder Bush, conducted by--Kate's
      brothers Paddy and John Carder Bush. And best of all, there were Kate's
      entire family and Del Palmer at the back of the main room throughout the
      entire event, ready and willing to chat with any and all fans who were
      interested. It was a really friendly atmosphere. Also, a lot of exclusive
      video clips were shown, including coverage of Kate's trip to Japan and
      outtakes from the Hammersmith Odeon film. </P>
    
    <P>If the next convention is held in a big enough room, and ticket sales
      are carefully limited, and if Homeground don't go spreading assurances
      that Kate herself will attend (a little late for that!), then the occasion
      should prove to be another amazing, magical success, like the '85 con.
      Let's hope at least a few Love-Hounds are able to put in an appearance and
      represent our group, eh? </P>

      <BR> From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald Hill)
      <BR> Subject: 1985 Convention Jay and Pad interview </P>
    
    <P>John and Paddy Bush Interview </P>
    
    <P>From the 1985 Kate Bush Convention </P>
    
    <P>November 30, 1985 </P>
    
    <P>[Transcribed by Ron Hill. Unfortunately the microphones were not too
      loud so much of the interview was inaudible.] </P>
    
    <P>DAVE CROSS: Few people know Kate as well as her immediate family, which
      I'm sure you've realized. So we're going to have two interviewees and two
      interviewers, but only two people on stage. Would you please welcome, to
      interview each other, John and Paddy Bush. [Applause] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Hi everybody! </P>
    
    <P>[Applause] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Hello, everybody can you hear me OK now? </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: [Inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yeah, I am Kate Bush Fan, I have everything she does. [Applause]
      But I'm not on the collecting side - I haven't got any Kate Bush T-Shirts
      or [inaudible]. Purely into the music. Question number 2... </P>
    
    <P>AUDIENCE: Louder. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [Shoats] Question number two!! It says, John in particular, seems
      to have been closely involved musicly - more closely [laugher] involved
      musically with Hounds Of Love then previous albums. Is there any
      particular reason for this? </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: Well, I think it's the new studio, because having the studio at
      home gives a very relaxed feeling to the work. So I mean there are a
      number of other reasons, really the creative ones and there were some gaps
      in there and I cleaned them up a bit. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Right. And in fact this particular album has shown a slight trend
      toward using this vocal voice with music as well as the song's voice and
      [microphone screeches loudly, blasting your transcriber's ears in the
      headphones. The audience laughs. Double thumping sound.] And so quite a
      lot of us were involved in an audio kind of way. We're asked to say
      things, things are put on to message machines - telephone answering
      machines and stuff like this. We're asked to phone people up and say silly
      things like &quot;good morning, dear this is early morning call.&quot; All
      this kind of stuff. So vocally, quite a lot of it's [??? inaudible] and
      Jay in particular and we're very honour to have him on here [???
      Inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: [Inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Do you like it, by the way? [Applause] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: It says question number 3. [??? Have the honour..] </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: How far does the material on Hounds Of Love reflect highly special
      music interests of Kate, such as traditional music and such? Very much I'd
      say... </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yes, definitely. </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: Particulary again the second side [??? inaudible] but certainly
      Celtic music is the biggest thing. You know, it runs all the way though.
      Even though that's not the specific [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yes. [??? inaudible] Yesterday, I was spoken to some two or three
      people there, and we were talking about the Jig Of Life and they were
      saying, to them, The Jig Of Life sounded as though it came from Breton
      [??? spelling] and to them it sounded exactly like Breton music. And I
      think the country influence is very [??? slight]. Would you like to know
      where the idea for The Jig Of Life came from? </P>
    
    <P>[Audience mumbles &quot;Yeah&quot;] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Well that was [??? Baton's fire dance] that came from northern
      Italy. And there's a rhythm that they use, which they play all day long,
      which is the rhythm that goes underneath the Jig Of Life. And the rhythm
      goes [thumps out rhythm] And these people are in a little village in
      northern Greece, they're all Christian people. They start dancing at about
      nine o'clock in the morning to this rhythm and [??? inaudible]. And they
      dance all afternoon and all evening and they're grown up people, not [???
      English] but grown up [??? huts]. And they carry these saintly paintings
      on their [??? backs]. And they sorta cuddle these things, and dance all
      afternoon, right into the evening. And at the very end of the night they
      lay a bonfire out on the ground and all the people in the village dance on
      top of these flames and nobody catches fire, except for visitors. Cause
      actually they have visitors to this village and they get very moved and
      carried away by the music and feel inspired to jump onto the flames. And
      inevitably they burst into flames and instantly combust, much to
      everybodies... [laugher] </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: I think maybe what's the most interesting thing about that second
      side, where there is traditional music, is I think it's the first sort of
      integration of folk music into rock music that I've heard for a while. A
      few people have tried it in the last ten years, but it hasn't had the same
      dynamic as that. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Would you agree? </P>
    
    <P>[Applause. A voice that sounds suspiciously like IED's suggests &quot;Night
      Of The Swallow.&quot;] </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: Next question. Do you want this question? </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: No. </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: Alright sir. [Laughter] To what extent could it be said that
      Kate's music is a collective family effort? Do both of you make your own
      creative contributions, IE Paddy's music on Jig Of Life, John lyrics on
      the same song? I don't... maybe we've answered that a bit. But, yes it is,
      I mean when you talk about things together, there's no really particular
      [??? target for it], but if somebodies just saying, &quot;why don't you
      write a [??? book] about a piece of music,&quot; it gets mentioned, it
      gets listened to, it gets looked at. And that's part of the process which
      adds to writing songs. But something specific, no. No, it's just a general
      sort of garden really of information. And [??? inaudible] if somebody
      finds a particular [??? socket], then [??? inaudible] It hasn't actually
      come from oneself. And it's just keeping your ears open. [??? Inaudible]
      then hopefully it gets recycled into [??? inaudible]. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yeah, that's perfectly true. We all do this. We're often asked to
      contribute, taking from ourselves. You know, &quot;have you got anything
      that may fit this particular idea.&quot; And then, on the other hand we
      can often asked to do specific things like to say very silly words and
      make very silly sounds. [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: The lyrics on Jig Of Life are interesting because originally it was
      going to be Edna O'brien [??? Spelling?]. But she wasn't available. And
      then when I was asked to do it, I thought I was going to have to pretend
      to be Edna O'Brien. [laughter] I wrote a very specific piece of poetry
      which is based mainly on W.B. Yates, for influence, so that it could be
      read with an Irish accent. It ended up though by just being read by a
      sorta Irish accent on a normal voice, although originally it was just
      going to be my voice speeded up, sounding like an Irish woman. [Laugher]
      So all that went into the lyrics coming out in that [??? little] way. The
      lyrics and the poetry. Question six. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: At what stage did we realize that Kate had a very special musical
      talent? That's easy. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Last week. [Laughter] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [inaudible] a couple of days ago, seemed to be talented. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: A very hard one, that. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: From the word go, really. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Yeah, she started playing the piano when she was eleven, I mean
      teaching herself. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Ten. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Ten. [Laughter] And then the songs started to come a little bit
      after that. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Ten and a half. [Lots of Laughter] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: [??? Wishful percussions] more than anything else. I suppose around
      fourteen or fifteen they started to get some body behind them and then it
      looked as though something was going to happen. But it really until she'd
      actually made the first album that it became very clear. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: But we knew all along. [Laughter] Here's a good one. It says do
      we have any special memories of early performances in folk clubs or of the
      KT Bush band - it must have been 1977. And what songs were sung, standards
      or Kate's own? </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Traditional. I mean I don't think... I mean Kate's never preformed
      in folk clubs. She certainly used to sing along with various folk bands
      that we had. Then she was very small so she couldn't have preformed
      anyway. And most of the songs she learned were Victorian sea shanties
      which were pretty dirty songs. [Laughter] So I suppose, in a sense that is
      where it started. [Laugher.] [??? Walking up here] and sing a dirty song.
      She's not worked in any traditional folk [??? styles] it's really just
      what she listened to as a child. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: KT Bush band performances in '77. They were really quite
      interesting. They all took place in a pub in Lewisham. The idea was to
      give Kate a little bit a practice of preforming. She had a contract with
      EMI and it was pretty obvious that the album was going to come out at some
      time. And it was [??? inaudible] be an experience of directly singing to a
      group of people. And so she thought maybe it would be interesting to [???
      impression] </P>
    
    <P> There was this place in Lewisham, it was called The Rose Of Lee, it
      doesn't exist anymore. The first night that we turned up, there were four
      people there. And it really hotted out about ten thirty, another two
      people came in [laughter] - Jay and my father. [More laughter] Really,
      really marvelous. And then the next week it was a bit better, it was
      about... about twelve people there. The songs being sung were, they were
      mainly standards, actually. Tracks Of My Tears, [??? inaudible] But then
      in about three weeks [??? inaudible] the word started getting around and
      the club became more and more and more packed. And I think maybe about the
      fifth or six week [??? inaudible] you couldn't get in. And this was all
      pre-... before the album was released or anybody knew anything about Kate,
      it was just the name of a group. [Laughter] I think about the fifth or six
      performance [??? inaudible] that night... The night she first did James
      And The Cold Gun... </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: Yeah. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: ... in fact, that was really good. I working the lights
      [laughter] and Lisa [??? invented ] fantasicly. We were hoping to get
      these huge blocks of dry ice which we were going to try out in the night.
      They [just said... stringing in the dust bin ???] pore some hot water on
      it and watch what happens. And we did and it was phenomenal! [Laughter]
      Six foot of [thrown ???] ice over here. Kate said [&quot;what are you
      laughing about&quot; ???] [Laughter] Yeah, that was very, very impressive.
      I felt, I felt James And The Cold Gun had a very phenomenal effect on the
      audience and if anything was maybe the truest sort of insight into the way
      it was going to go. And maybe the nearest thing there was to anything like
      the tour before the tour started. </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: Yeah, certainly... particularly that song was the [??? end of it]
      for the performances that came out of the tour. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yeah. Question number eight. Will Kate tour again or will she
      contemplate on other ways of visually presenting her work? </P>
    
    <P>JOHN: She's bound to tour again, obviously. But when, I don't know. I
      think she's faced with the situation now in which she can go three ways
      -she can do another album, she get a tour together, or she can concentrate
      on something more visual, which might be film or, I don't know, maybe an
      extended video. And until promotions for this album are finished, and that
      means making another video for every [next single ???] and maybe another
      video for every single on [the planet ???] she's not going to really know.
      So I suppose until the spring of next year she wouldn't really have any
      idea about what direction she's going to take. But of course yes, there's
      bound to be another tour, but when, who knows? </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yes, and I promise you we are considering this very, very
      seriously. I mean it's not something that we're going to put off for ever
      and ever and ever. There will be another tour, if not next year, the year
      after, and it will be marvelous. I guarantee you, we're going to be better
      than the last one. [Laughter] That will be nothing compared to what we're
      going [to do ???] </P>
    
    <P>How did the sleeve for the Running Up That Hill come to be archery
      themed and the idea of lyrics on Kate's back? The archery... Archery is
      something that we have been interested in for many years. It symbolizes
      the very basic learning processes, archery. You aim an arrow at a target
      and you let it go and it flies towards the target, it misses the middle
      and it moves a little bit to the left and a little bit low, then you know
      that the next arrow you're going to shoot has to be a little bit to the
      right and a bit higher. And [??? inaudible] where you find another
      learning process [??? inaudible] spending all the English summer walking
      up and down the hundred yards between the target and the [??? inaudible].
      And [??? inaudible] a few summers ago Kate was very active, very good
      actually, too. Very good [??? inaudible] skills. Excellent [??? inaudible]
      and it just [??? inaudible]. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: I think there's some levels of archery which now... in terms of a
      simple fact, you can see archery as... with the left hand holding the bow,
      as the future, and the right hand is pulling this way, it's going
      backwards, as the past. And you're the present. You could see it as the
      left hand as the passive thing, the female, and the right hand as the
      male. And it's obviously [??? inaudible]. And there are a lot of esoteric
      levels, but I'm sure they're not very interesting. Perhaps they threatened
      to get into the [??? single fan]. </P>
    
    <P> And the idea of the lyrics written on Kate's back was... we'd been
      working on a series for about the last eighteen months and a photograph...
      because I never found a photograph and a poem written on the page opposite
      -it never seems to work. You look at the poem and you're having to read
      the words and that's more concentrated thing, particularly these days,
      because less of us are used to it. And then you look at the photograph and
      you get a much more immediate reaction. So trying to balance all that's
      going on. And I though the only way to do it was actually to write the
      poem in the photograph. And writing it on the person, that meant you could
      take a portion of the person, you could write your poem. You take a
      photograph too and get a much more complete thing. So I'd done a few of
      those and Kate saw them and liked the idea, so we tried... initially we
      were going to try them for the album cover, but that didn't work out, it
      was much too busy. But it worked well I think for the single back. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [??? Inaudible] Are there any other [??? silly] questions. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: As far as books on Kate Bush, that have been published, they seem
      to be absolute rubbish. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY AND JAY: YEAH! </P>
    
    <P>FAN: They've made Jay out to be some morose figure who hides in dark
      alleys.. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Yeah. [Laughter from audience] </P>
    
    <P>FAN: And your whole family to be eccentric. Do you resent that and could
      Kate Bush put the record straight by writing her own biography? </P>
    
    <P>JAY: I think, yes, initially we resented it and it was a bit of a shock
      and that's the usually process, finding out whether I wanted to do
      anything to stop it, because a lot of it was quite unpleasant and very
      un-[??? flattering] to me. And we decided that we wouldn't because that
      would fuel the fire of the sort of people who were doing it. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [Makes funny voice] Nasty Bushes! Stop us going to press! [????
      inaudible] Us! [Laughter from Audience] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Actually for her to do a book we find it's rather difficult because
      she doesn't get on the [??? planet] that long. And slight attempts were
      made of it but I think actually seeing your life spread out in one big
      long effort is very weird sensation. So, no, they haven't have. Whether
      they will in the future, I don't know. I doubt it somehow. But I'm sure
      they'll be plenty more books as far as the ones we've been talking about
      now. But it's just an unfortunate aspect of the music industry. But, as
      you say, they are rubbish and they're rubbish in so many details, not in
      what they say about us but just in what they call &quot;fact&quot; is all
      wrong. And they don't rely them at all, [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>FAN: Did Fred Vermorel every meet you? </P>
    
    <P>JAY: No, nor Paddy. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: No, not one of us. </P>
    
    <P>[Inaudible and Laughter] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: He wants to know where he could find us. [More laughter] Just for
      our own person protection from him, you know he went through our dust
      bins, too. Some people make a living... [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>ANOTHER FAN: I was just wondering how much communication there is
      between Kate and the Bush camp and EMI America? Maybe specificly
      concerning MTV not showing the original video of Running Up That Hill?
    </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Yes, that's quite interesting. There has now been [??? some] good
      communications because we just came back from America. Where the reaction
      to Kate's music was good, very positive. And Canada too. And I think the
      high point of that was the personal appearance at Tower Records in New
      York, which surprised not only us but the record company and the people
      who run the store. On all levels, because the people went right around the
      block which they hadn't expected. They'd got a lot of police to police it,
      when they didn't need to, everybody was very well behaved. And the
      enthusiasm of the fans and, well you all know this anyway, took them by
      surprise. And I think it also made them see that there's a much bigger
      market and that's all their interested in, is making money. They saw a
      much bigger market potential because there were people from 15 to 50
      queuing. And they'd never been able to isolate a Kate Bush fan and in a
      sense they still couldn't. But you could see with all the signs moving
      round and round [laughter] [??? inaudible]. So I think communications with
      them are much better, yeah. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: As far as Running Up That Hill goes, it's this great technical
      problem. MTV weren't particularly interested in broadcasting videos that
      didn't have synchronized lip movements in them. They liked the idea of
      people singing songs. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: But I've seen lots of other videos on MTV where they have lots of
      parts where they aren't any syncronizations of... </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Yes, but I think... Yeah, I see what you mean but I think that what
      they've done is they decided to typecast her very early on [??? inaudible]
      - It didn't actually work and they're still trying to get out of that
      habit. And when they saw the video, it wasn't at the time in which the
      record had taken off the way it did in the states. So they were probably
      trying to be fairly cautious. And that's why they [??? inaudible] vocal
      track. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: They didn't approach you saying make another video where she's lip
      synching did they? </P>
    
    <P>JAY: No. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Not exactly. [Laughter] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: No. Well if they paid for it, maybe... </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yeah, but there just wasn't the time available. So [???
      inaudible] was it re-instated? </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Well, the original one is being shown now [???? and it's the only
      version that I love]. I think maybe its an educating process. [??? people]
      have to get used to it. </P>
    
    <P>IED: They did actually show the original video in Los Angeles on a
      spanish salsa station. [Laughter] </P>
    
    <P>FAN: And in most of the clubs they showed the original one, too. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Yeah, but that was... the big reaction to that [??? video in] the
      dance clubs really surprised everybody, cause it's certainly the first
      time Kate's had a dance [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [??? inaudible]. Yes. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: Explain the Kick Inside. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Explain The Kick Inside. [Laughter] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: The track The Kick Inside, or the album? </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: The track. </P>
    
    <P>IED: [Mumbles] The meaning of life. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: The track owes its roots to a traditional English-Scottish song
      called Lucy Wan [??? spelling]. And it's an incredibly sad, heart rending
      song about incest and terrible things and blood and death and it's about
      the sadist thing that's every been... </P>
    
    <P>JAY: And it's very long. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Oh, very, very long. And much in the same way that St.
      Claustintine's [??? spelling] fire dance provided the [??? grabbing]
      inspiration for the Jig Of Life, you could easily trace a lot of the
      energies in The Kick Inside directly back to Lucy Wan. And in fact there
      were one or two experiments at the time of recording the album where
      actual sections from Lucy Wan were taken and processed and used in a very
      unusual way, which I'm not going to tell you about because we might try
      and use it in something else. But it wasn't actually kept for the track.
      But if you find the song Lucy Wan, you'll find all the inspiration for it.
      Ah, is that it? </P>
    
    <P>FAN: What's the strange saying on the B-side of The Hounds Of Love Album
      [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yes, it's... In fact it's not Kate it's one of the ladies from
      EMI. [??? inaudible] Her name is [??? inaudible]. And she sang &quot;deeper,
      deeper...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>FAN: &quot;Somewhere in the death there is a light&quot; </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: &quot;Somewhere in the death there is a light.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>FAN: In German. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: In German. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: In German. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Well, it snowed a couple of days ago. It snowed a couple of days
      ago [??? inaudible] and I'm just on my way [??? inaudible] at this moment.
      I'll let you know [??? inaudible] what's going on. They keep melting on
      me. Thank you. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>FAN: [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: [??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: You got to remember that record companies are only there to make
      money and if you saw them as washing machines, manufacturing companies,
      it's like that. And I can't really blame them. If they don't make the
      effort in some direction its something that they don't think is going to
      make them money. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: They tend to promote at the time, when there is something to
      promote.[??? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: And if they see something that they think is going to work [???
      inaudible] and certainly the accessability of the last album, for most
      people, and they did it and it worked. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Did most of you get the album this time without any difficulty?
      [Laughter] Good. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: [???? inaudible] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: Ah, dear! </P>
    
    <P>FAN: [??? burning] </P>
    
    <P>JAY: I think it's just, it's just what it means. If you know what gaffa
      is, and in the music business &quot;gaffa&quot; is a very heavy duty tape.
      It's used everywhere, sticking things down, mending things, makings cases.
      And I think the idea is probably if you're wrapped up in this stuff and
      just [??? stuffed] 'round, your suspended waiting for time. And I think
      the rest of it is saying [??? inaudible] that's the problem. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: One more question. </P>
    
    <P>FAN: [??? Inaudible. Something like do you have a favorite Kate Bush
      song?] </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: For me. Yes, yes. [??? inaudible], singing on the end of it, but
      it's Get Out Of My House, really, was my favorite track. I think if Alfred
      Hitchcock ever made hit singles [Laughter] [??? inaudible] And I love it,
      I love the energy that it deals with. It's fantastic. And Paul Hardiman's
      vocals on the very beginning of it I think are, to me, one of the most
      fantastic things thats ever been recorded. I used to go into fits of
      extascy when we listened to the multi-track tapes of that and those
      opening &quot;Eoyores&quot; and a marvelous [??? inaudible]. I love that
      track. </P>
    
    <P>JAY: I think my favorite one's Houdini [??? inaudible]. But I think the
      emotional whatever it is that getting across on that track is very
      inspired and very dynamic and I still find it very exciting. </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Final question, then? [??? inaudible] arm over there? FAN: On the
      album [??? inaudible] I'd love to hear what you did. It sounds like [???
      inaudible]. Is that right? </P>
    
    <P>PADDY: Yes. [??? inaudible] They're singing a phrase. You take a phrase
      and you record it. Then you play that backwards so it comes [sings
      backwards. Laughter]. Then you learn how to sing that, like you learn how
      to [sings backwards. Lots of laughter and applause] Then when you record
      that... then when you play that back the other way [talks like reversed
      tape] it all comes out in a very strange way. Like you've heard this
      technique used before, and it's something that we all [??? inaudible.
      Laughter] Thank you very much for giving us this opportunity to being [???
      inaudible and applause] </P>
