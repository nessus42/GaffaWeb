      <BR> Subject: Vocal Range </P>
    
    <P>Regarding Bob and Bill's remarks about vocal range: Yes, Kate has,
      technically speaking, a pretty wide range, but only if you include her
      falsetto range as part of her &quot;normal&quot; range. The range of an
      opera singer, by contrast, certainly does not include falsetto notes -- if
      it did, a soprano's range, for example, could extend as much as an octave
      higher than any music that has yet been written for a soprano voice. </P>
    
    <P>Also, Kate's lowest recorded notes were attained by artificial means.
      Probably her two lowest sung passages are on &quot;Houdini&quot; and &quot;Running
      Up That Hill&quot;. (In the latter, her bottom harmony of the &quot;C'mon,
      c'mon baby&quot; section is very low indeed, and is especially audible in
      the twelve-inch mix.) But for &quot;Houdini&quot;, anyway, Kate has
      explained that she recorded parts of the vocals at a higher pitch and at a
      faster speed, and then slowed down the tape during playback. And she's
      also said that she consumed a ton of milk and chocolate before singing the
      low notes, in order to build up the mucus in her throat, thereby
      temporarily enlarging her vocal range. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Vocal ranges </P>
    
    <P>I'm not too sure that i understand all this stuff about vocal ranges.
      When you state that &lt;x&gt; has a range of 8 octaves, are you saying
      that &lt;x&gt; has a range larger than that of a piano? That he can sing
      lower than a piano and higher than a piano? This seems a bit unreasonable
      to me. My max range seems to span about three octaves, going from growl to
      screech (it might be greater than that, but i'm at work and don't want to
      embarass myself too awfully much). My useful range might be about an
      octave, for what it's worth. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, i listened a bit last night to The Whole Story, trying to get an
      idea of Kate Bush's vocal range. As far as i can tell, she seems pretty
      suited to the soprano cleft. The ranges i have marked are from a G3 (the G
      below middle C) on The Dreaming to an A5 flat (the A flat above the A flat
      above middle C) on Wuthering Heights (that's a bit debatable--she scooped
      up to somewhere around there, or maybe a bit past). She gets up to a G5 on
      some other songs (Breathing, Wow, Sat in Your Lap). </P>
    
    <P>The comparisons of Kate's voice to a Stradivarious are interesting. Her
      low seems to be about the same as a violin, although the violin can get
      perhaps an octave higher (actually, it can get quite a bit higher, but
      stops being musical at about that point). </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, her vocal range seems to be a bit more than two octaves. </P>

    <P>I've always been under the impression that a 5 octave range was the
      highest ever achieved. Minnie Ripperton had a 5 octave range. I have read
      or heard (I forget from where, but believed it was a very reliable source
      at the time) that Kate has a 4 octave range, which is considered quite
      incredible. </P>

    <P>Dave Rickel may have a vocal range of two octaves. Kate Bush definitely
      has a much wider range than that. How on earth did you come up with a
      range of only two octaves for Kate? Hell, even I can span three octaves
      and a note or two beyond, and I is DEFINITELY no singer. </P>
    
    <P>As far as I knows, Kate's highest note is heard on &quot;Don't Put Your
      Foot on the Heart Brake&quot;, from Lionheart. The passage in question is
      a background vocal in which she sings &quot;She's losing, she's losing,
      she's losing, she's losing...&quot; As posted earlier, her lowest note may
      be heard on the lowest vocal harmony track of the twelve-inch version of &quot;Running
      Up That Hill&quot;, during the extended &quot;C'mon, c'mon baby&quot;
      passage. The difference between these notes is definitely more than two
      octaves, but the ease and clarity with which Kate sings the high notes on
      &quot;Heart Brake&quot; indicate that she is capable of singing a good
      deal higher, albeit perhaps not so beautifully or with sufficient control.</P>

    <P>With the hope of ending the vocal range issue, the following facts are
      posted: </P>
    
    <P>Kate's lowest recorded vocal note, heard on the twelve-inch mix of &quot;Running
      Up That Hill&quot;, is (in the treble clef) the E-sharp below middle C.
    </P>
    
    <P>Her highest recorded vocal note, heard on the Lionheart track &quot;Don't
      Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake&quot;, is (in the treble clef) the C-sharp
      THREE octaves ABOVE middle C. </P>
    
    <P>Kate's recorded vocal range to date, therefore, is less than two whole
      tones shy of FOUR octaves; and she is obviously capable of reaching beyond
      this range. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
      <BR> Subject: four octave range </P>
    
    <P> &gt; According to many sources, our beloved Kate has a four octave
      range. I believe IED once said she exhibits over four octaves on her first
      four albums, and over three octaves on &quot;Hounds of Love.&quot; I'd be
      very interested in her lowest and highest notes on each of her albums
      (i.e., where does she sing her highest notes, where does she sing her
      lowest notes, what notes are they, and what is the range?). I'm told this
      is getting into esoteric trivia, but... </P>
    
    <P>-- Paul M Carpentier </P>
    
    <P>If IED did in fact claim a &quot;four-octave&quot; range for Kate, let
      him apologize here. Actually, this matter was investigated with some care
      by IED and other Love-Hounds about a year or so ago, and it was found that
      Kate's range extends -- at least in her publicly released recordings --
      about three half-tones shy of three octaves. IED decided (without,
      however, making a systematic search of Kate's entire recorded work) that
      Kate's highest note to date can be heard on the track Don't Push Your Foot
      on the Heart Brake, specifically in the brief preamble to the second set
      of verses which begin with the line &quot;She's losing that inner flame.&quot;
      At that point the words &quot;She's losing, she's losing, she's losing,
      she's losing...&quot; can be heard, and they are sung in extremely high
      two-part harmony by Kate's overdubbed voice. The higher of the two
      overdubs repeatedly hits high C --that's &quot; the &quot; high C of
      operatic soprano fame -- the note which, by the end of the nineteenth
      century, had become a sort of sine qua non for the great divas. Probably
      the most famous example of the magical effect of a high C in opera comes
      at the very end of the first act of La Boheme. Mimi's last note of that
      act is a long, sustained, pianissimo high C. She really hits that note and
      lets it float. </P>
    
    <P>IED isn't really sure that this is the highest Kate goes, however. Other
      possible tracks to check out are The Big Sky, Burning Bridge and Not This
      Time, all of which contain some raw, shrieking choruses which may contain
      some very high notes. (Half a dozen other songs come to mind already as
      this is being written.) </P>
    
    <P>As for Kate's lowest note, IED thinks it might be an E-flat below middle
      C (on the piano), which she might be singing in the extended mix of
      Running Up That Hill, during a long section in the last third of the
      recording when Kate repeatedly sings (again in two-part harmony, though
      this time at the very bottom of her voice) the words &quot;Come on, come
      on, baby/Come on, come on, darling,&quot; etc., with minimal instrumental
      obligato. (This is not just a remixed section from the LP recording, but
      an additional vocal section which appears only in the 12&quot; a-side.)
    </P>
    
    <P>However, after prolonged listening, IED still can't be sure that Kate
      really reaches that note. In the track The Dreaming, though, she
      definitely comes down to at least an E-natural below middle C, toward the
      end of the LP track with the last utterance of the words &quot;in the
      road.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>All of this may sound like an anti-climax, since the term &quot;four-octave
      range&quot; has been bandied about quite a lot in Love-Hounds over the
      months (as well as in the media: Take Laurie Brown's spoken introduction
      to her Canadian TV interview with Kate). In fact, though, from what
      preliminary research IED has done over the past day or two, there is no
      confirmation of anyone having consistently sung a full four octaves. It's
      virtually a fiction in operatic singing. Three octaves, or three octaves
      and a half at the outside, seem to be about the limit of the soprano
      voice. (This includes the castrato soprani of olden times, who were famous
      more for the timbre of their voices, than for any miraculous range.)
      Perhaps the misunderstanding comes from the fact that a full three-octave
      range actually includes four octaves of its lowest tone, even though the
      number of complete octaves could only be three. </P>
    
    <P>IED thinks Jamie Andrews was really getting at the crux of this problem
      in talking about how Kate exploits her instrument. The trick is not in the
      range, but in how that range is used. Obviously, an E-natural below middle
      C doesn't sound particularly &quot;deep&quot; when sung by a male baritone
      voice. In Kate's 12&quot; mix of RUTH, however, it sounds really deep. In
      other words, it's all in the timbre: Kate makes the note sound deep
      because she sings with evident effort, loosening the throat muscles as
      much as possible to meet the challenge of the pitch, and at the same time
      attaining that pitch with authority and consistency. By the same token,
      the solidity with which she hits high C in Don't Push Your Foot, coupled
      with the audible strain to her voice which the effort causes, combine to
      create that indefinable effect of &quot;singing very high&quot; -- even
      though high C for the human voice is no longer even close to the official
      record, and in fact is nearly two full octaves short of the piano's
      highest limit. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
      <BR> Subject: Kate's vocal range (update) </P>
    
    <P> The initial search having stirred his interest, IED decided to
      undertake a more thorough survey of Kate's vocal athletics, and his
      efforts thus far have already necessitated significant emendations to his
      original posting on the subject. </P>
    
    <P>Although he expressed doubt recently about the possibility of anyone
      having a true &quot;four-octave range&quot;, and claimed that anyway
      Kate's own range appeared to extend fewer than three full octaves, IED now
      admits that the second of these assertions was false, and possibly the
      first, as well. In listening to Kate's first three albums and her 1979
      live recordings he discovered two songs in which Kate topped the high C
      which she sang on the track Don't Push Your Foot on the Heart Brake. </P>
    
    <P>In the Tour of Life performances of Violin Kate capped her vocal with a
      huge and wonderfully authoritative leap to the E above high C, when she
      sang the final &quot;Violin!&quot; of the song. Although this
      pyrotechnical feat is noticeably absent from the later studio recording of
      Violin, Kate also reached the high E in an earlier studio recording: James
      and the Cold Gun. </P>
    
    <P>IED has also found that Kate's voice reaches below the low E-flat which
      he had earlier claimed was Kate's lowest sung note (found on the extended
      mix of RUTH ). On the Lionheart track Coffee Homeground Kate in fact sings
      (albeit with some uncertainty and only on a rather minor bass harmony
      backing-vocal) a low D-flat. This can be heard during the brief bridge
      leading out of the first chorus of the song into the second set of verses.
      Kate accompanies the instruments with a series of &quot;la-la-la&quot;s,
      and these extend, in the lower of Kate's two overdubs, to a definite low
      D-flat. </P>
    
    <P>The sum total of all this is that, while he earlier stated that Kate's
      range was two full tones shy of three octaves, he can now announce, after
      only an incomplete search of her recordings, that her voice extends at
      least one-and-a-half tones beyond three full octaves. Even though this
      still leaves Kate's range well short of the legendary four octaves so
      often ascribed to her, IED would not be surprised to discover, in the
      course of his continuing research, that Kate has &quot;pushed the envelope&quot;
      even further. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: four octave range </P>
    
    <P>For the record, Kate does not, nor has she ever, had a true &quot;four-octave
      range&quot;. Perhaps with difficulty she could span three octaves and go
      half way up a fourth--and this is actually about as far as most voices go,
      even the most agile and athletic. The reason for this kind of hyperbole no
      doubt stems from Kate's unusually high &quot;working&quot; vocal range,
      and the fact that she is able to reach a great many of her higher notes
      either with or without relying on her falsetto. </P>
    
    <P>A perfect example of the difference in timbre between Kate's falsetto
      high range and her non-falsetto high range can be heard in the new
      recording, Never Be Mine. Throughout the recording Kate sings the line &quot;This
      is all I need&quot; in her amazingly expressive, full, rich and intimate
      falsetto voice. However, toward the end, in the climactic, intricate final
      choral section, Kate adds another, non -falsetto version of that same
      line, with the same melody (more or less) and in the same high range. It's
      placed pretty far back in the mix, but it's not &quot;secret&quot; or
      anything, so everyone should be able to hear the difference in timbre
      immediately. There are very few singers working today who have extended
      their non falsetto ranges to such a degree, or who have been as systematic
      as Kate in refining the respective shades of expression for both their
      falsetto and non-falsetto ranges. </P>
    
    <P>Also, of course, Kate can reach surprisingly low notes when she needs
      to, although seldom with the same kind of power or control. </P>
    
    <P>Aside from these physical distinctions, there is another equally
      important explanation for Kate's exaggerated reputation in regard to vocal
      range, and this has to do with the music she composes. Kate's melodies,
      unlike those of any other writer of &quot;popular&quot; vocal music today,
      span an enormous range of notes of the scale. Most--nay, all --other
      people writing songs for the popular genres--are, in comparison, able to
      conceive only the most timid kinds of melodic structures, within only the
      most limited scalar ranges. Kate Bush's melodies have--and this was true
      right from the beginning--very often ventured along completely uncharted
      paths--at least within the context of the popular vocal genres. One result
      of the unfamiliarly broad range of notes in Kate's melodies, and the
      consequent use they make of her vocal range, has been, in IED's opinion,
      the frequent reference to a &quot;four-octave&quot; singing range. </P>

    <P>When the subject was first raised, the note that came almost immediately

      screeching counts, I figured I'd better think of something else, such
      as... </P>
    
    <P>The note at the end of Waking the Witch. This is the one note that Kate
      hits and holds at the end of the line in the chorus &quot;.....help this
      blackbird...&quot;, right before the helicopter comes over. I've always
      admired folks that can hit and hold a note like that, and brother, this
      makes my hait stand on end. So there you have it. Until next time.....
