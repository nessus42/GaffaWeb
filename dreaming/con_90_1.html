      <BR> Subject: ******** ! KATE NEWS ! ****** </P>
    
    <P>Vickie here. </P>
    
    <P>Peter Morris (aka Peter David Fitzgerald-Morris/&quot;Mr Homeground&quot;)
      called me today and said that he'd just come back from The Bush home (Dr.
      &amp; Mrs.) and was given the go-ahead to organize another Homeground/KBC
      Convention! The KBC is footing the bill and it should be one great party!
      The best thing of all is that ***Kate will be there***, as she was for the
      last one!!!!!</P>
    
    <P>The date and venue are not set yet, but it will definitely be in October
      and will definitely be held in central London. Peter said they should have
      the date and venue firmed up by next week. I'll post more details as I
      learn of them. Kate will probably not be there very long, at the last one
      she was only there for a few minutes (IED, you can give the folks details
      about that) so no one should go expecting otherwise. There will be videos
      shown that only the Bush family own (at the last one, songs from the
      Hammer-smith, edited from the official videotape, were shown!) and
      goodness knows what else. </P>
    
    <P>Peter wanted me to post this information on the net so people could
      start making tenative plans, if they wanted to go. Also, he is asking for
      ideas &amp; suggestions for the Convention. What would people want to see?
      Do? </P>

      <BR> From: Andrew B Marvick &lt;abm4@cunixd.cc.columbia.edu&gt;
      <BR> Subject: IED returns to the group </P>
    
    <P>IED was delighted to see how healthy Love-Hounds continues to be. The
      news of the boxed set of KT CDs (IED gathers the title is rumored to be &quot;This
      Woman's Work&quot;?) and, perhaps even more exciting, the plans for many
      U.S. fans to travel to England and attend the November 17 International
      Kate Bush Convention together, are certain to be stimulants to KT
      discourse in Love-Hounds for weeks to come. </P>
    
    <P>IED is not certain yet, but he is making every effort to arrange to join
      the other Love-Hounds and Kate fans at large in London on the 17th
      November. He would hate to miss out on such a magical occasion. It would
      be really nice to meet Neil Calton, Love-Hounds's veteran Senior
      KorrespondenT in the UK; as it would be to re-meet Michael Butler, Vickie
      and Chris, Larry &quot;Lionheart&quot; Hernandez, and Ed Suranyi--great
      and sincere Kate fans all! </P>
    
    <P>IED hopes that our Washington State KontingenT will somehow find a way
      to represent themselves at the Convention, and that even our
      much-too-busy-for- most-Kate-Bush-stuff Pseudo-Moderator, Douglas Alan,
      may conspire to stowaway or something in order to make a re-appearance on
      the KT Con Center Stage for a Trivia KonTest re-match. And Derek, what
      about you? Can you make it? </P>
    
    <P>IED will be reading Love-Hounds with enthusiasm for news of other
      pilgrims. Meanwhile, he wishes you all the best. </P>
    
    <P>-- Andrew Marvick </P>
    
    <P> P.S.: Tracy, can you come too? Deb Wentorf, what about you? Tippi Chai,
      if you're still reading this, can you make it? Jon S. Drukman (see, IED is
      in such a good mood he even used your whole name, Jon), Joe Turner, have
      you bought your airline tickets yet? Etc., etc., all those whose names IED
      can't think of right now--hope you can make it! </P>

    <P>Hello, Love-Hounds. </P>
    
    <P>IED will be joining the rest in London for the convention. It's more or
      less final now. He would love to join an American quiz team, should the
      need arise. One thing he won't do is compete as an individual, the way it
      was set up for the '85 convention--too nerve-wracking for this
      philo-canine. </P>

    <P>From: spt1@ukc.ac.uk (Stephen Thomas)
      <BR> Date: 18 Nov 90 14:13:21 GMT
      <BR> Subject: The Convention - A Report </P>
    
    <P>Yesterday, I had one of the most special days of my life, as did some
      1200 other people. I refer, of course, to the KBC/Homeground 1990 Kate
      Bush Convention at Le Palais in London, and I would like to tell you all
      about it. Doubtless, there will be things I shall miss, but other
      Love-Hounds will be able to fill in the gaps. </P>
    
    <P>Myself and a couple of friends, Claire and Liam, drove from Canterbury
      into London, arriving after a fairly uneventful journey at about 10:30.
      Parking the car and finding Le Palais took another 20 minutes or so. At Le
      Palais there was a long queue, all of whom were very obviously other
      Katefans. At about 11:20 we got in. </P>
    
    <P>Le Palais itself is a rather swish nightclub - you could tell this by
      the fact that the place was very dark, with occasional islands of neon
      light. The exception to the gloom was the stage area to the front of the
      dancefloor, which was very brightly lit. This was set up for some live
      music (hopes raised!!!) whilst hanging above and behind the stage was a
      multi-screen bank of TV's, on which were shown videos and stuff. All
      around the stage were large, recent pictures of Kate - the TSW cover
      photo, and the Sand Through The Fingers photo. Kate's music was blaring,
      and I do mean blaring, through the house PA system. I actually did not
      like the volume it was being played at all - it seemed loud enough to make
      my skin hurt! Ho hum. </P>
    
    <P>Whilst people were still arriving, I searched for and managed to find
      the other Love-Hounds. At last, I have met Andrew Marvick, Ed Suryani
      (sp?), Vickie'n'Chris, Meredith Tarr, Niel Calton, Phil Smyth, and others.
      Andrew had brought a bunch of white roses and Phil was going round with a
      card which we could sign. The intent was to give the card and the flowers
      to Kate when she came on stage. Andrew also had these rather natty
      stick-on badges with the KT-fem. symbol (we are going to have to think of
      a better name for that!) and &quot;Love-Hounds&quot; on it. Andrew had
      also gone to the trouble of putting our names on the stickers, one for
      each person on V'n'C's list, I presume. Andrew, that was very nice and I
      thank you for it. I really did not expect that. </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, when everyone was inside, David from Homeground, who was the MC
      for the day, got onto the stage and welcomed everyone to the Convention.
      Also on the stage were Peter and Krys (also from Homeground) and Lisa from
      KBC. David gave us a run-down on what was going to be happening during the
      day. There was going to be live music and performances from fans (ah!),
      the showing of a special video presentation called &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;,
      which was made by Homeground and was a chronological compilation of rare
      and not-so-rare performances, interviews, etc. </P>
    
    <P>There was going to be a raffle, the prize for which was one of Kate's
      suits, with a photograph of Kate wearing the suit, which would be signed
      by Kate to the winner. The proceeds of the raffle, of the entire day in
      fact, would go to the Terrence Higgins Trust, which is Kate's favourite
      charity. There was going to be the quiz, and spot-prizes all through the
      day. Then, towards the end, Kate herself would come on and answer
      questions from the audience! In order to stop that from becoming a farce,
      what we did was write our questions (with our names) on a piece of paper
      throughout the day, and then Kate would select a few to answer before she
      came on. More on this later. </P>
    
    <P>The live performances were very good on the whole, and were very
      professional. The video was shown in three parts and was impressive and
      fascinating. At the end was a video-montage made for &quot;Reaching Out&quot;
      by Homeground which was actually very well done. </P>
    
    <P>There were two surprises. Del Palmer was introduced without warning, and
      he auctioned his stage passes for The Tour Of Life (which went for 90
      pounds, as I recall) and his photo-pass for one of the German
      performances, which went for about 60 pounds, I think. He also spoke a few
      words about Al Murphy and Gary Hurst, saying that they were very difficult
      to replace and they were much missed. For the raffle, Paddy Bush appeared
      to pick the winning ticket. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, none of the Love-Hounds teams won the quiz, but I would
      like to congratulate the winners (whose team name I cannot remember, I'm
      sorry!). Their prize was very special; each of them received an album
      Boxed Set, individually signed to each member. I saw them after they had
      collected their prizes, and they were obviously very moved by meeting
      Kate. </P>
    
    <P>Then, when the video was finished, all the live acts were over, the
      spot-prizes done, David introduced Kate onto the stage with the simple
      words &quot;and here's Kate!&quot; and no other warning at all. A short
      setee was quickly rushed to the front of the stage and Kate appeared from
      backstage and made herself comfortable. She was wearing all-grey tracksuit
      affair and looked really casual - not glamourous or pop-starish, just
      herself. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, people rushed to the front, but David asked people to sit
      down and be sensible about it, and people were. For the following hour or
      so she answered some of the questions people had submitted throughout the
      day. What she did was very nice; she had the pieces of paper with her, but
      she just read out the person's name and they would ask the question
      themselves. David and especially Lisa did a sterling job of running around
      and getting microphones to people. </P>
    
    <P>I cannot remember all of the questions that were asked, and I cannot
      remember the exact words that Kate answered with, but I can remember some
      of them. They ranged from questions about her work, about her home and
      about her attitude towards her fans. </P>
    
    <P>She was very moved by one question. Someone asked, &quot;How do you feel
      knowing that no matter what you do we will all love and support you?&quot;
      Of course, there was a huge spontaneous cheer at this point, before she
      could answer, and I think she was overwhelmed and humbled by this. She
      tried to make light of it -&quot;Don't, missus. You've got me all of
      a-fluster!&quot; - but I think one of the things she said in answer to the
      question was that she didn't feel she deserved such devotion. I think
      opinions may differ on this! </P>
    
    <P>Another question was, &quot;What are you like when you go shopping, or
      don't you?&quot; This caused a large laugh from the fans, and Del, who was
      standing at the back of the stage, was making &quot;It's *me* who does the
      shopping!&quot; gestures, and when the fans had quietened down he was
      heard to say &quot;Tell the truth!&quot;. As it turns out, Kate *hates*
      supermarkets - in her words, &quot;They really freak me out.&quot; She was
      rather comforted to find it wasn't just her, though. Apparently, she has a
      friend who is just like that, who collects a large basket of shopping
      before it gets too much and they run out, leaving it behind! </P>
    
    <P>Another funny anecote came when someone asked if she had played two pubs
      when she was going round with the KT Bush Band. On a certain number she
      used to dance slowly off the stage and through the audience. One time,
      though she was doing this and met a friend, who said &quot;Hello Kate!&quot;,
      and Kate responded with, &quot;Oh, hello!&quot; and they stood nattering
      until Kate realised that she had go back on stage soon, so she danced back
      to the stage! </P>
    
    <P>Two questions were about her acting. She was asked how she had found
      working with the Comic Strip. She responded that she enjoyed it immensely,
      but missed having total control. She was asked to comment on the rumour
      that she had been asked to play Cathy Earnshaw in a remake of Wuthering
      Heights. She said that she had heard it - as a rumour, nothing more - she
      knew as much as we did. She asked us (!) whether we thought it would be a
      good idea and 1200 people shouted &quot;YES!!&quot; very loudly. &quot;Oh!
      Do you really think so?&quot;, she said, taken aback. &quot;YES!!!!&quot;
      came the response. &quot;Oh, I shall seriously consider it then, if I'm
      asked!&quot; </P>
    
    <P>These questions really sum up how Kate was at the Convention. It was not
      a pop-star talking at adoring fans, rather it Kate Bush meeting her
      friends and having a chat with them. Her personality was totally
      unaffected and very endearing. Now when people say &quot;she really is&quot;,
      I know what they mean. </P>
    
    <P>Now, there was one question that when she came to it, she said &quot;I'll
      save this till the end&quot;. Well, the end came and she got that person
      to ask their question. The question was something about her attitude
      towards touring, and she had saved it until the end because she had a
      major announcement to make. </P>
    
    <P>KATE INTENDS TO TOUR AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR!!! </P>
    
    <P>Well, let me qualify that. She said that if things go as planned, she
      will be putting on a few shows towards the end of next year, although they
      would probably be announced in January, but she wanted us to be the first
      to know! That made us all feel very special, of course. Thanks Kate!
      Obviously, there will be more details from &quot;official&quot; sources
      later. </P>
    
    <P>After the questions had all be done, Kate asked for a few minutes
      silence while we considered the memory of Al Murphy and Gary Hurst, to
      whom the day was dedicated. As we were all quiet, she quickly took a piece
      of paper which she had stuffed into the top of one of her socks, and sang!
      It wasn't very long, but she had put some new lyrics to &quot;My Lagan
      Love&quot;, which thanked us for coming and how special we all were to
      her. This was very moving. </P>
    
    <P>Then she said thanks to everyone who had arranged the day - David, Krys,
      Peter, Lisa and everyone else. We thought it would be over then, but it
      wasn't. Steve Davies of EMI presented her with a Platinum Disc for The
      Sensual World, which everyone was very pleased about, not the least being
      Kate. </P>
    
    <P>And that was the day! Kate was, of course, lovely, but I also treasure
      the day because I got chance to meet some of the other Love-Hounds I have
      read so much of. I would like to thank Andrew, Vickie'n'Chris, Meredith,
      Ed, Niel, Phil and anyone else who was there for helping make the day a
      treasured one. </P>
    
    <P>I would like to thank the Homeground team - Peter, Krys, David and
      Sharon - and Lisa of the KBC for putting in so much effort to make the day
      work, and work it did! </P>
    
    <P>I want to thank the people who performed live for us, and all those who
      ran around on the day organising the raffle and selling merchandise. </P>
    
    <P>And of course, I want to thank Paddy, Del and Kate for being there. </P>
    
    <P>Stephen </P>

      <BR> From: Sakari Jalovaara &lt;sja@sirius.hut.fi&gt;
      <BR> Subject: Back from the Convention </P>
    
    <P>I just came from the airport and haven't even unpacked my bags (except
      for opening CD the box set.) I'm sure there will be detailed reports
      later; just a couple of quick notes: </P>
    
    <P>Kate was there for a bit longer than just to say &quot;hi&quot;; she sat
      on a couch on the stage for something like 45 minutes answering questions.
      It was GREAT! She sang too... </P>
    
    <P>She'll tour next year. </P>
    
    <P>She told, as she said earlier in the HMV &quot;Q&quot; magazine
      interview, that she has started writing for the next album. Of course it
      will take quite a lot of time to get from &quot;started writing&quot; to
      the release day. </P>
    
    <P>There was pretty neat stuff for sale: a new T-shirt (dark blue with a
      red fem/KT symbol on the heart), programmes from her first tour, badges,
      posters, old KBC mags, ... And when you bought something you got it in a
      white plastic bag with a big black fem/KT symbol (here's to hoping it
      isn't bio-degradable :-) </P>
    
    <P>There were a few (three?) live performances by Kate fans doing covers of
      Kate songs. Interesting but I think I prefer the originals :-) </P>
    
    <P>There was a video documentary (who put it together? Peter Morris &amp;
      the gang?) It was, something like 1 to 1.5 hours long and contained some
      commercially available videos, live TV performances, bits of TV
      interviews, less easily available videos, etc. It was shown in three parts
      on a big video wall (the wall was of marginal quality.) The tape is not
      available for copying :-( </P>
    
    <P>I don't know how many people were there; someone said 1200, someone
      1500. My ticket number was &gt; 1100 (it's somewhere in the luggage) so
      there should be at least that many tickets sold. </P>
    
    <P>There was also the quiz (the prize was an individually autographed box
      set for every member of the team!) and a raffle (1st prize: a performing
      costume of Kate's!! Everyone who was there: where has she used it?) </P>
    
    <P>Well, the tour isn't quite certain yet. She's definitely planning live
      performances late next year but it's on planning stage and it might not
      end up being a big tour but &quot;just a few shows.&quot; If things go
      smoothly, she'll announce the tour in January. </P>
    
    <P>Pretty nice, huh? </P>

    <P>From: csd@planet.bt.co.uk (Colin Davidson)
      <BR> Date: Sun, 18 Nov 90 16:36:05 GMT
      <BR> Subject: Konvention news!!! </P>
    
    <P>Well, here goes with a quick summary of the Konvention. I'm sure the
      rest of the people there will expand on what I say. Vickie taped the som
      of the interview so I should you'll get a pretty detailed account later.
    </P>
    
    <P>The Konvention was at the Hammersmith Palais, which turned out to be a
      fairly spacious nightclub. There seemed to be no indication outside of the
      club that a Konvention was going on; in fact the whole thing seems to have
      received little advertising. Despite this, there was over 1200 people who
      attended the convention. It took about an hour before things really got
      started and by this time all of the Love-Hounds had congregated in one
      place. IED kindly supplied us all with Love Hound stickers so we could
      identify ourselves. </P>
    
    <P>The Konvention was hosted by the Homeground people (possibly others; I'm
      not sure) and they told us the list of events. Basically it was to be 4
      live bands and 3 sessions of videos, some of which contained rare
      material. The live bands on the whole were quite good. The videos were
      very interesting; although the picture was displayed on one of these
      multiple screen machines, rather than being projected. The videos covered
      her material from her very early days to present and showed part of TV
      footage she has done and much of her life performances. We also had spot
      prizes, a raffle and a quiz. We entered 3 teams in the quiz, one of which
      consisted of the UK love-hounds. Unfortunately, none of the love-hound
      teams one the prize, which is one of the suits she has been known to wear.
      Del Palmer and Paddy Bush also turned up and were greeted
      enthusiastically. </P>
    
    <P>As time got neared to the great interview, many of us love-hounds
      drifted towards the front, by the stage. By the time Kate came on, I and
      many others were in the front row. The roar of the crowd made you feel
      there were more people than there actually were. Questions were done by
      people placing questions in a box earlier on and appraopriate questions
      being selected (by KaTe?). The people who's questions were selected were
      then passed the microphone to ask Kate the question. </P>
    
    <P>Kate looked fairly relaxed, as she sat down on her couch on the stage.
      The crowd were enthusiastic, but well behaved and I think this helped put
      her at ease. I can't remember all of the questions, but it went on for
      about half an hour. The *big* news is that she's started work for a new
      album and that she's hoping to do some live gigs at the end of next year,
      possibly even a tour. This news brought tremendous applause and KaTe
      seemed to really appreciate this. She also said that her fans often helped
      her when she was down and that she was scared of supermarkets. (Big
      grocery stores basically). I'll leave it up to the rest of the love-hounds
      to fill in the details of the interview. </P>
    
    <P>The best thing about it though was when she took a sheet of paper from
      her stocking and sang a goodbye song reading from the paper. Everybody was
      awestruck and it was a really great moment. After that she left, waving
      goodbye as she went. One plucky love-hound then managed to get her
      autograph by having the nerve to walk through to where she had gone. The
      rest of was were really jealous. </P>
    
    <P>The whole thing lasted about 4 hours and was really enjoyable. Some of
      the love-hounds went to Earls Court where many of the love-hounds were
      staying. There we listened to some of the interview and talked and then
      listened to Chris's phone call from KaTe herself, which has been recorded
      a while back. This was quite funny as Chris had been quite naturally taken
      aback by being phoned up by KaTe. He must have said 'that's great' about
      20 times as Kate said how much she liked the video he had made up for the
      Infant Kiss. </P>
    
    <P>We all met up then, and went to an Italian restaurant. I had to leave
      after my meal so I don't know what happened after that. </P>

    <P> From: Pablo Iglesias &lt;pi&gt;
      <BR> Date: Sun, 18 Nov 90 16:15:19 GMT
      <BR> Subject: KonvenTion News </P>
    
    <P>Well folks, I see that no one else has posted yet about the KonvenTion
      so I thought that I'd be the first; am I the only UK lovehound that
      bothers to show up to the office on a sunday? </P>
    
    <P>Anyway the convention got started at around 12:20 in the Hammersmith
      Palais. This is a rather large and pretty cool looking dance place in
      London. ALl in all there were 1208 tickets sold and I can only guess that
      most people showed up. There were three main parts to the KonvenTion. I
      won't try to give a complete account of what happened. ALl in all we had
      the following: </P>
    
    <P>LIVE PERFORMANCES: </P>
    
    <P>No not by kate. The performances were by local artists who had written
      in to KaTe saying that they were performers etc. Most of them were pretty
      good but nothing too special. We must have had about 5 of these groups:
      one 4 piece band; 3 female soloists and one dance group who have an
      interpretation of &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;. These were interspersed
      in the three parts of the konvention. </P>
    
    <P>DOOR GIVEAWAYS; A RAFFLE and AN AUCTION </P>
    
    <P>All tickets were numbered (mine was 1156) and these numbers were used to
      pick winners for small prizes. Typically either an autographed copy of TSW
      album or TSW poster. All the winners had to answer pretty basic KT trivia
      questions (eg. when is KaTemas) and although the questions go harder
      towards the end when the people stumbled the audience shouted out the
      correct answers so that they all got the prizes. </P>
    
    <P>For the raffle they were selling tickets for 1.00 pound. There were 4
      prizes: the main one was of one of KaTe's outfits with an autographed
      picture of Kate wearing the outfit. SOme English guy won this which made
      me curious as to what the heck this guy was going to do with this :-) Two
      of the lesser prizes (videos) were won by LoveHounds! Neil Calton got one
      of them (I forget who got the second) </P>
    
    <P>The auction was conducted by Del Palmer. He brought out two of his
      passes from the Tour of Life. They fetched something like 80 pounds for
      his passes and 60 pounds for another pass. This as well as all the other
      money was to be donated to an Aids research charity. </P>
    
    <P>QUIZ </P>
    
    <P>There was the quiz competition of 20 hard KaTe faKTs. Well, I'm a recent
      convert to Kateness so I found them hard. The winning group of four got
      all 20 questions correctly so I guessed that they weren't that hard. The
      winners eached received a specially autographed copy of the record Box
      Set. </P>
    
    <P>VIDEO </P>
    
    <P>We had a long video history of KaTe's carreer. THis was divided into
      three parts. Again, I can't judge as to how rare the material was. It was
      all very interesting however. </P>
    
    <P>DEL PALMER, PADDY BUSH and ..... KATE!! </P>
    
    <P>Del Palmer came out early an auctioned the passes above; he was also
      around the people signing autographs. Paddy did the raffle drawing but
      otherwise didn't say anything or sign autographs. </P>
    
    <P>Kate came out at 5:00. During the first part of the convention there had
      been a box on the stage where people could leave pieces of papers with
      questions for here to answer. When se came on stage they arranged a couch
      so she could sit and answer the questions. She would read the person's
      name and then the person was given an opportunity to ask the question to
      KaTe directly. These was all very well done. Kate seemed quite willing to
      answer all questions. I wish that I'd have a tape recorder or even a piece
      of paper to remind myself what the questions were. </P>
    
    <P>The one question she left out and didn't answer until the end concerned
      the possibility that she might tour again. Well folks, according to KaTe
      herself she would like to tour towards the end of next year. More
      importantly she said that if things worked out right there would be an
      official announcement in January about it!!!!! No word on where she'd
      tour, but judging from her words and the tone it does sound like there is
      a good possiblity that it will go ahead. </P>
    
    <P>Then KaTe thanked everyone for coming. She asked everyone to have a
      moment of silence for Gary Hurst and Alan Murphy. When she did this she
      took out a piece of paper with some words and she sang a small poem saying
      &quot;thank you&quot; She was then given a platinum record for sales of
      TSW at which point she left the stage.</P>
    
    <P>Anyway, that is my short recollection of what happened at the
      convention. For more details you probably need a real Kate expert which
      I'm not. It was sure nice to see her. She seemed really down to earth; it
      was also nice to meet some love-hounds and to place a name beside the id's
      :-) </P>

    <P>The Convention was great, fantastic, unbelievable .... I will post a
      full personal review in due course but there is some really hot news
      (which I am sure other UK hounds will also be posting but its worth
      repeating). </P>
    
    <P>KATE IS GOING TO TOUR AGAIN NEXT YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </P>
    
    <P>Well - she said almost certainly if a few things work out. There should
      be a firm announcement in January. </P>
    
    <P>She has also started work on the new album - looks like the 90s are
      going to be a great decade. </P>
    
    <P>I am still recovering from the thrill of the Convention - it was great
      to see so many Love-hounds. Just hope all of you who vould not make it
      will be able to see the shows next year. </P>
    
    <P>Be seeing you, Neil </P>

      <BR> Date: Mon, 19 Nov 90 13:59:08 WET
      <BR> Subject: Convention!!!!!!! </P>
    
    <P>What is coming is my report of the convention: </P>
    
    <P> 1990 KB Convention or A Day In The Life Of A Love-Hound!! </P>
    
    <P>It was an absolutely brilliant day,one which I'll never forget!! The
      doors opened at around 11.20, I headed straight for the merchandise desk.
      They were selling blue convention t-shirts with the new symbol, badges,KBC
      back issues, posters, Tour programmes, 1985 convention t-shirts etc!! They
      were also giving out posters and badges free (not bad eh?). Throughout the
      day they showed a compilation (called 'this woman's work') of foreign
      peformances, rare clips etc; this was shown in 3 parts. They showed the
      special Hitchcock 'Hounds Of Love' done for the last convention again,
      plus a video of the 1986 video party. At the end of 'This Womans work'
      they showed a new video set to the song 'Reaching Out', compiling
      different clips from over the years; this was absolutely stunning!! </P>
    
    <P>Over the day various fans appeared doing their own versions of Kate's
      songs,all of them were very impressive (they certainly had guts!!). Del
      Palmer appeared in the afternoon to auction his stage passes and a photo
      card as well. Paddy picked out the raffle tickets, and one of our own
      love-hounds won a signed promo video (well done Neil!) All proceeds from
      the day went to the A.I.D.S charity 'Terence Higgins Trust'. The quiz was
      held in the afternoon (3.30 ish), 20 questions were set.I think it is fair
      to say that most teams got around 18/19 except for the winners who got 20.
      The question that stumped most was 'Who was the director of the
      Cloudbusting Video?', the answer being Julian Doyle. Then Evan Welsh,
      Colin Davidson and myself managed to get to the front of the stage.
      Then................. </P>
    
    <P>Kate appeared to deafening applause. Earlier in the day we had been
      asked to write down questions with our names on paper. Kate then proceeded
      to pick them out of a box,read them out, the person who's question got
      picked,then had the chance to ask Kate themselves. I'll leaver it to
      someone else to remember the individual questions. Tho' one question
      no-one will forget,was one about touring </P>
    
    <P>SHE MIGHT BE TOURING AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR!!!!! </P>
    
    <P>If she does Kate says announcements will be made in January.............
    </P>
    
    <P>LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED!!!!!!!!! </P>
    
    <P>Then Kate asked for some silence for Al Murphy and Gary Hurst, and she
      sang a short new version of 'My Lagan Love' with new lyrics. I was that
      engrossed with her singing, I didn't get chance to copy down the lyrics,
      though basically they were about thanking the fans for their love and
      dediKation. The flowers from Love-Hounds reached Kate, I think she was
      certainly overwhelmed with the love by the fans. Thanks to all the
      organisers, though especially to Kate who made it all happen. I hope I see
      you all at the end of next year again, this time for the TOUR!!!!......I
      CAN't WAIT!!!! </P>
    
    <P>It was very nice to see the following Love-Hounds at the convention
      (apologies if I missed your name on the following list, I couldn't
      remember everybody!): Evan Welsh, Neil Calton, Colin Davidson, Andrew
      Marvick, Vickie &amp; Chris (I'm glad you liked the Q mag), Jorn Barger,
      Chris Ridd, Ed Suranyi (smaller than I had expected!!), Graham Dombkins,
      Meridith Tarr, Larry Hernandez, Stephen 'J' Carter, Jem Carroll, Greg
      Bossert and Rick (thanks for the directions!!!). </P>

      <BR> Date: Mon, 19 Nov 90 15:14:46 BST
      <BR> Subject: Convention experiences </P>
    
    <P>Here are my memories of the Convention. </P>
    
    <P>I arrive about 1130 outside Le Palais and was suprised to see a very
      long queue stretching down the street and had a moment's fear that there
      was some problem inside. However, the queue moved fairly quickly and I was
      inside by about 1150. </P>
    
    <P>Once inside I was pleasantly surprised not to find a typical tatty
      British theatre or concert hall but rather a fairly plush, comfortable
      night club/dance hall type interior with foyer area, bars, seats, dance
      floor and stage. On the stage were several monitors, TSW posters and drum
      kit. Behind the stage was a large multi-screen video monitor (which turned
      out to be a bit of a pain later on). </P>
    
    <P>Moving inside I met up with Justin (who thought I was |&gt;oug - though
      he later changed his mind on our similarity - lucky for |&gt;oug :-) ). We
      both set off in search of other Lovehounds. On my first walk round I
      failed to spot them but considering the number of people there (&gt;1200)
      this was not surprising. Then I bumped into someone with a lapel badge
      with Lovehounds written on it. It was John Barger and he directed me to
      the area where Lovehounds were congregating. There I found Andrew Marvick
      who was generously handing out stick-on labels with people's name, the new
      KT symbol and Lovehounds on them. These proved to be extremely useful
      during the day as a way of spotting the names we have all seen in this
      forum and being able to put faces to them. Phil Smyth was also decorating
      people with pieces of gaffa tape as an extra means of identification. </P>
    
    <P>Thanks to Andy's name badges I was also able to meet Andy Semple,
      Stephen Thomas, Colin Davidson, Ed Suranyi, Chris and Vickie, Evan Walsh,
      Meredith Tarr, Larry Hernandez, Jeff Dalton, and Jem. I was particularly
      pleased to see Jem not only because he was a new convert to KT'ism but
      also because he had agreed to buy my individual Kate CD's (at a very fair
      price - if I do say so myself!). I am sure Jem will have many happy hours
      of listening ahead of him. I then managed to spend most of this money on
      back issues of the KBC magazine and posters. There was an area selling
      merchandise at the front of the hall - and when you bought something you
      got it in a white plastic carrier bag with the new KT symbol. </P>
    
    <P>Having met all these people there was unfortunately few spare moments to
      chat to them as Homeground and KBC had arranged a very full day. Dave from
      Homeground introduced himself, Peter and Krys (and later Sharon) from
      Homeground and Lisa from the KBC. The programme for the day consisted of a
      number of live acts performing versions of some of Kate's songs and
      sometimes their own songs, videos, spot prizes, a quiz, a raffle and an
      auction. We were also told that Kate would appear and would stay around
      for a reasonable time. </P>
    
    <P>The live acts were a rock group; a girl called Kate Usher (almost the
      right name!) who played keyboards and sang; a girl who sang unaccompanied
      two of Kate's songs, a girl who sang to taped backing tracks; and a group
      of 6 dancers (3 male, 3 female) who did a dance routine to &quot;This
      Woman's Work&quot;. Most were very good and much better than I had
      expected. They all got a very good reception from the crowd. </P>
    
    <P>The video presentation was split into three sections and was entitled &quot;This
      Woman's Work&quot;. It had been put together by the Homeground team and
      presented in roughly chronological order videos of Kate's performances, TV
      spots, interviews etc. This was really great though spoilt a bit by the
      multi-screen monitor which broke up the image and meant that the text
      subtitles giving the important dates in Kate's career, chart information
      about her album and single releases etc. was almost impossible to read.
      Nevertheless, it was a mammoth piece of work and was thoroughly enjoyed by
      the whole audience. Unfortunately, it cannot be made available
      commercially. </P>
    
    <P>During the day there were spot prizes - numbers were drawn and people
      whose entry ticket had this number won a prize - which was a signed
      poster, or album usually. Actually, the person had to answer a question
      about Kate before getting the prize but since the audience shouted out the
      answers in most cases this was not too difficult. I don't think any
      Lovehounds were lucky enough to win these. </P>
    
    <P>For the quiz people had to form into teams of four. Somehow I must have
      given the impression that I know quite a lot about Kate because I was
      asked to join both a UK and US Lovehounds team. Despite my protestations
      that I had a terrible memory for facts, Andy and Evan persuaded me to join
      the UK team along with Colin (I think they may have regretted this later!)
      Evan gave me a fright when he said we would have to go on stage to answer
      questions but in the end Peter of Homeground read out 20 questions which
      the team had to answer on paper and hand in for marking. IMHO the
      questions were *hard* though my colleagues managed to get most of them.
    </P>
    
    <P>In the end none of the Lovehounds teams one - it was a team called the
      rebel rockers or something who all seemed to be girls which I thought was
      quite a nice touch. Their prizes were personally signed copies of the LP
      box set. I saw them with these afterwards and they looked great -
      naturally they were thrilled with them. I have an awful feeling that I
      will eat my words about the box set and end up getting the album set as
      well just for the larger booklet! </P>
    
    <P>Del Palmer appeared in the afternoon and helped auction two stage passes
      and a photo pass. The former went for c. #80 and the latter for c. #60.
      All the money from this, the raffle, ticket sales and the sale of
      merchandise was going to the Terrence Higgins Trust (this was a popular
      choice with the audience). Soon after, Paddy Bush came on stage to draw
      the winning numbers in the raffle. First prize was one of Kate's suits she
      has worn for TV appearances plus a photo of Kate that she would sign
      personally. There were also some runners-up prizes and these included two
      preview copies of the new Sensual World video (to be officially released
      this week). </P>
    
    <P>The first number was called and an American voice yelled yea, then the
      second number was called. Oh my God, it is mine! Somehow I make my way to
      the stage, scramble on and in a daze press a ticket into Dave's hand.
      Paddy Bush shakes my hand and hands me a copy of the video. Dave shoves a
      microphone in front of me and I splutter Neil from Oxford. As I turn to
      walk off, Dave announces &quot;And here's Kate&quot;. There is a
      tremendous roar and Kate appears. Only later do I find out that the other
      winner of a video was John Barger. Two Lovehounds win - that's fantastic.
      And I'm on the same stage as Kate -will I make it off without having a
      heart attack. </P>
    
    <P>Kate sits on a sofa in front of stage as a thousand flash bulbs go off.
      When the applause dies down she says how pleased she is to be there and
      how great she thinks her fans are. She then answers questions that had
      been selected from ones people had written down during the day. These
      cover a wide range of topics which I think is best to leave for another
      posting. As has alrady been said - the main points were the news about the
      tour and work on the new album. </P>
    
    <P>While she was answering questions, Kate was presented with some art work
      by a couple of fans, and then Andrew Marvick took up a bunch of white
      roses and a card signed by all the Lovehounds. These were presented to
      Kate by Dave from Homeground with an announcement that they wer from
      Lovehounds. Kate said they were lovely and clearly appreciated the
      gesture. Well done Andrew! Then after asking for some silence for Gary and
      Al, Kate takes a sheet of paper from her sock and sings a short song to us
      all. There is then a surprise for Kate when she is presented with a
      platinum disc for sales of &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. Then all too
      quickly she leaves to another tremendous ovation. </P>
    
    <P>Still a bit shocked I wander over to the Lovehounds area and Vicky asks
      whether my video was signed. I say no, so she tells me to go and get it
      done. John and I go over to the stage and ask one of the helpers. He takes
      them up to Kate and a few minutes later I have in my hands a video signed
      with the words &quot;To Neil with love Kate Bush&quot;. I was only just
      coming down to Earth after the birth of my daughter nine weeks ago and now
      this! I shall probably be in a permanent daze until the tour starts! Vicky
      also got one of her flyers for SIG signed and was also thrilled. </P>
    
    <P>After the show many of the Lovehounds arranged to go out for a meal. As
      I was dependent on some fairly unreliable trains I sadly had to miss out
      on the chance to talk to them all. Though in my numbed state I would
      probably have rambled incoherently (so what's new). At the tube station
      Ryan appeared with a signed copy of the HOL CD booklet. He had wandered
      backstage and met Kate! As you can see some of us Lovehounds had a truely
      incredible day! I really hope that everone will be able to get to see one
      of the shows next year. </P>
    
    <P>To sum up, the Convention really exceeded my expectations. Even without
      the tremendous thrill of winning the signed video it would have been a
      fantastic day. It is something I will always remember. Neil </P>
    
    <P>P.S. SHE REALLY IS. </P>

    <P>At this point there have already been quite a few wonderful accounts in
      Love-Hounds of the convention day, so there is very little for me to add.
      (I particularly loved Neil Calton's and Stephen Thomas's postings about
      the day--they really managed to communicate the sheer magic of the
      occasion. Thanks to all of you for your postings, they were delightful
      reading.) Even so, I just want to repeat, for my own satisfaKTion: </P>
    
    <P>KATE WAS THERE!! KATE SANG TO US!! KATE IS (probably) GOING TO
      CONCERTIZE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR!! </P>
    
    <P>What better news could any Love-Hound hope to be able to post to the
      group than that, I ask you? INCREDIBLE. </P>
    
    <P>It was great to meet so many Love-Hounds, and finally to be able to put
      faces to so many familiar names. It was wonderful to meet up with
      Californian Love-Hound buddies Ed Suranyi and Larry Hernandez again, and
      it was a particular joy to me to see my dear old friend Vickie Mapes after
      five long years of phone calls and e-mail messages. Great to see Chris
      Williams again, too! </P>
    
    <P>Kate said she'd started dancing again, and I thought it showed. By the
      way, I hope, with the help of Vickie, to produce an accurate and
      as-complete-as-possible transKripTion of Kate's chat with the
      KonvenTioneers. As soon as it's ready I'll post it to Love-Hounds. I
      sympathize with all the fans who couldn't manage to attend the event, and
      I hope the transcription will be some KompensaTion. </P>
    
    <P>Personal highlights? There were so many, but they included meeting (all
      too briefly) with Peter Fitzgerald-Morris again after five years; being
      received so warmly by Dave Cross (a fantastic Master of Ceremonies at both
      the conventions I was fortunate enough to attend--well done, Dave!); being
      treated so nicely and with such a spirit of friendship by Lisa of the
      KBC--thankyou, Lisa, for all your help amid so much seeming chaos; talking
      (again far too briefly) with Krystyna Fitzgerald on the phone afterward;
      getting the big bunch of white roses I'd picked out beforehand delivered
      straight into the lap of Kate--that was a real thrill, especially knowing
      that the bouquet contained a large card with the unmistakable imprint of
      LOVE-HOUNDS all over it; seeing Kate walk out on stage; seeing Kate
      genuinely moved by the love in the air; hearing Kate announce, in an
      intimate, almost confiding tone--as though she were telling her closest
      friends--that at long last she thought she would probably give some shows
      at the end of next year; and most of all, being present to witness Kate as
      she almost visibly conquered some personal demons and sang, in that
      special kind of electric silence only a large crowd of people sharing
      completely the same magic moment can make, that unforgettable little
      thankyou song to us all--my emotions got the better of me at that point,
      and tears came to my eyes... </P>
    
    <P>It was a great joy to me to have been there. Here's hoping we can all
      experience similar magic together in about a year! </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I feel it all around me...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>-- Andrew Marvick </P>

      <BR> From: &lt;CARROLLJ%ALCBAN@KRDC.INT.Alcan.CA&gt;
      <BR> Subject: A 'Conventional' reaction </P>
    
    <P>Hiya all, </P>
    
    <P>Everybody seems to be giving their personal reactions to the Con. So I
      guess i might as well :-) </P>
    
    <P>I got to La Palais late (due to British Rail :-(...), and was quite
      surprised to see that it wasn't the dump I remember it to be - I saw The
      Cramps there a few years back. They've certainly brightened the place up a
      bit. </P>
    
    <P>I came in during the first section of the video (that was sooo good. I
      want a copy!) and had a look round. Spotted a name-tag on somebodies arm
      (was it you Evan ?), and found everybody else. Met Cindy, Vickie, Ed (he
      IS shorter than you imagine! :-&gt;), IED and (please insert your name(s)
      here........) etc. Then Neil appears and I buy his CD's (yahoo!! - it WAS
      a fair price Neil!). Bought two T-shirts - they are *really* neat (prize
      possesions!) </P>
    
    <P>There is no point in me describing the events of the day, that's been
      done, and will doubtless be done by people with more accurate descriptions
      than me. </P>
    
    <P>I was quite worried (seriously) that I would be an 'outsider' to the
      Love-hounds, seeing as how I'm the 'new boy', as it were. </P>
    
    <P>I couldn't have been more wrong. </P>
    
    <P>Everybody was warm, friendly, and so happy to be there. Imagine if you
      will, the atmosphere at the best party you've ever been to, squared,
      several times. Thats what it was like. :-) </P>
    
    <P>The most startling thing about the whole convention - I say startling,
      because it really hit me like a ton of bricks - was Kate herself. She
      seemed so fantastically, incredibly, unbelievably - well, *normal*. </P>
    
    <P>You know, you watch these videos, and listen to this incredible music,
      and find that it's not created by some 'super-being' or 'god', but by a
      human being!! I say that &quot;She really ISN'T...&quot;, which is a far
      more wonderfull situation than &quot;She really is..&quot; - although some
      people will no doubt disagree :-&gt;&gt; </P>
    
    <P>I don't know. The last few weeks have been the most unusual and
      uplifting of my life. Its been so strange. From getting the 'head-rush' of
      awakening to Kates music, to attending the convention, and meeting all
      these incredible people - I feel a different person to what I did a month
      ago.... </P>
    
    <P>....and I love it. </P>
    
    <P>Just my thoughts. </P>
    
    <P>Love and thanx. </P>
    
    <P> Jem xx </P>

      <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward Suranyi)
      <BR> Subject: Convention/Trip to Peter's house [LONG, but worth it!] </P>
    
    <P>Hi! I'll try not to repeat too much of what's already been said, as the
      major news has already been posted. </P>
    
    <P>Larry Hernandez, Chris'n'Vickie, and I had arranged to meet at Gatwick
      Airport on Saturday morning, as we were all supposed to arrive within an
      hour of each other. Despite the fact that we were all coming on different
      airlines, and connecting in differnt cities, we managed to meet pretty
      much as we had planned. We went straight to our hotel, where we stopped
      just long enough to meet Jorn Barger and some other people staying with
      him, including Ron from San Diego. (At this point I should mention that I
      have a terrible memory for names. If I say something that someone does
      something without mentioning a name, I've forgotten it, and I apologize.
      If you want to send me e-mail telling me who you are, I'd appreciate it.)
    </P>
    
    <P>We dropped off our stuff and cleaned up a little, then headed over to
      Hammersmith. I was surprised at the length of the line, but with over 1200
      people attending I should have expected it. In line I met Andy Marvick,
      Meredith Tarr, and some others. </P>
    
    <P>Other posts have described the room. We Love-Hounds set up a meeting
      place near a couch, and we all signed the card that Andy got for the
      flowers we planned to give Kate. </P>
    
    <P>In the following, I'll use the legend: </P>
    
    <P>K: Kate </P>
    
    <P>Q: Questioner from the audience </P>
    
    <P>A: Shouts from the audience </P>
    
    <P>WAC: wild applause and cheering. I have to use this one a lot! </P>
    
    <P>At the beginning, the people from Homeground introduced themselves.
      David Cross (I think that's his last name -- I don't remember for sure!)
      said, &quot;There are people all over the world here today. We have lots
      of Americans.&quot; A big cheer went up among the Americans. &quot;I
      thought that would get a reaction from the Americans,&quot; he said. He
      described the program, then said, &quot;And, yes, Kate will be here.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>WAC. </P>
    
    <P>&quot;And she's not going to just say hello and leave. She's going to be
      here for quite awhile, answering questions from the audience. So don't
      worry.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Others have described the video presentation. Nobody yet has said that
      some of the things shown were stuff that I didn't imagine existed:
      especially, &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; from the Hammersmith Odeon
      concert! As you know, this isn't on the officially released video. I was
      awestruck; it was incredible. I'll also just say that in the Rapido
      interview, Kate talks about her fans, and says, &quot;I think they must be
      completely mad, and thank you very much!&quot; This brought some cheers
      from the audience. </P>
    
    <P>I was part of a quiz team consisting of Andy, Meredith, Graham from
      Australia, and me. Unfortunately, we didn't win. Also, it turns out that
      we were all wrong about the stumper question. The next day, Peter
      Fitzgerald-Morris of Homeground told us that the one question that only
      the winner got right was &quot;What was the full name of the Roy Harper
      song that Kate sang backing vocals for.&quot; It turns out that &quot;You
      (The Game, Part II)&quot; is NOT the complete title! I'll tell more about
      my trip to Peter's house in Kent below. </P>
    
    <P>We met Lisa, who runs the K.B.C. Chris asked her if Kate planned to
      perform at all, and she said, &quot;Well, you know, Kate would really love
      to, but the problem is that it would be bootlegged.&quot; As you know, she
      sang a little anyway. </P>
    
    <P>Most of the rest of the program has been discussed by others, so I'll
      just skip to the question and answer section. I will be paraphrasing here,
      and posting only what I remember, but I believe that some people managed
      to get this on tape. I think and hope that they will post the whole thing
      real soon! </P>
    
    <P>David anounced Kate with the words, &quot;And here's Kate!&quot;
      Immediately there was a mad rush to the front. David said, &quot;Sit down!
      Sit down, so everybody can see!&quot; With Kate on stage, nobody wanted to
      disobey, so everyone sat down in short order. I was especially happy,
      since, as one other poster has discovered, I'm pretty short. </P>
    
    <P>K: Hello! How are you? Are you having a good time? </P>
    
    <P>A: Hello! Yes!, etc. </P>
    
    <P>K: I just have a couple of things to say first of all. I want to thank
      you all for coming. I've started writing songs for the next album. </P>
    
    <P>Immensely WAC. </P>
    
    <P>K: Well, that's certainly an encouraging reaction! I've gone back to a
      simpler style, I think. I'm composing mostly on piano nowadays. </P>
    
    <P>---- </P>
    
    <P>K: What a lovely accent. Is it Irish? </P>
    
    <P>Q: No, actually, it's Californian, though some people think it's
      Canadian. </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>Q: How does it feel, knowing that no matter how hard your work seems,
      we'll always love you? </P>
    
    <P>WAC. </P>
    
    <P>K: Well, it's really encouraging. Sometimes, when I'm in the middle of
      an album, I don't think it'll ever be finished, and I get so frustrated.
    </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>[Kate had been asked about her first recording sessions with David
      Gilmour.] </P>
    
    <P>K: One of the songs I recorded then was &quot;Passing Through Air&quot;,
      which I think became a B-side later. </P>
    
    <P>A: &quot;Army Dreamers.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>K: No, I didn't record &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; then. </P>
    
    <P>A: No, we mean it was a B-side for &quot;Army Dreamers.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>K: Was it? Well, you would know! </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>Q: [unfurls a huge flag of Brazil] I'm too emotional. </P>
    
    <P>With prodding from the audience and Kate, he says, </P>
    
    <P>Q: Have you ever been to Brazil? </P>
    
    <P>K: No. I've heard it's really a lovely place, though. </P>
    
    <P>Q: Can I ask you one other thing? </P>
    
    <P>K: Um, Yes. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, I've forgotten what the second question was, although I
      seem to remember that it was kind of neat. If anyone remembers, please
      post. </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>K: I thought I'd be really nervous, answering questions in front of a
      large crowd, but I'm actually quite relaxed now! </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>K: [looking at a question she just took out of the box] Hmm, I think
      I'll save this one till last. </P>
    
    <P>Of course, we know what that last question was now! </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, I seem to have forgotten most of the question and answer
      session. Kate was onstage for between 45 minutes and an hour, so lots of
      other questions were asked. I hope that within a couple of weeks someone
      will post a complete transcript. Failing that, could others post questions
      and answers that I didn't? </P>
    
    <P>--- </P>
    
    <P>I do, of course, remember the LAST question: </P>
    
    <P>K: And here's the last question, that I set aside earlier. [Reads name]
    </P>
    
    <P>Q: Since it's been so long since your last tour, do you have any plans
      at all to tour in the foreseable future? </P>
    
    <P>K: Well, actually, we've discussed this and now plan to have some live
      shows towards the end of next year. </P>
    
    <P>Incredibly WAC, lasting several minutes! </P>
    
    <P>K: A final decision will be made in January. I just wanted you to be the
      first to know. </P>
    
    <P>Andy got a large bunch of roses. As the questioning went on, it appeared
      that he might have been forgotten. So Andy slowly made his way to the side
      of the stage. David saw him, and took the flowers. &quot;These are from
      the Love-Hounds, the American fans,&quot; he said as he gave them to Kate.
      [Yes, I know it's not just Americans, but that's what he said.] &quot;Oh,
      how lovely,&quot; she said. </P>
    
    <P>Others have described how Kate pulled a piece of paper out of her sock,
      and sang My Lagan Love with new lyrics. Peter told us later that she
      hadn't decided whether to sing that until the very end, when she would see
      how she felt. That's why it was hidden until she pulled it out. Peter said
      she left feeling ecstatic -- which is kind of how we felt, too! </P>
    
    <P>Riding the underground back to our hotel, I mentioned that when Kate
      announced the live shows, I really wanted to shout, &quot;Please come to
      America this time!&quot; Someone who I didn't know, who was standing near
      us and who had also just come from the convention, said, &quot;I asked Del
      Palmer about that just now, and he said they definitely are planning to
      come to America, at least the major cities: New York, Los Angeles, San
      Francisco. . .&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Pinch me, I must be dreaming! </P>
    
    <P>About twenty of us went out for dinner to an Italian restaurant.
      Afterwards, we stared to break up. </P>
    
    <P>The next day Chris'n'Vickie had been invited to Peter and Krys
      Fitzgerald-Morris' place in Kent. They were allowed to bring a few
      friends. I was lucky enough to be one. [Thanks, Vickie! If there's only
      one thing that you've done for me that I will never forget, this is it!]
      Others were Larry Hernandez, Jorn Barger, and Ron from San Diego (whose
      last name I've forgotten). Later, Graham from Australia showed up. Ron had
      given Del a t-shirt describing the many attractions of San Diego, hoping
      to convince Kate to go there. </P>
    
    <P>It was about an hour's train ride from Victoria station to Rochester. We
      called Peter up, and he and David Cross showed up in two cars a few
      minutes later, and drove us to his house. </P>
    
    <P>There, we met Krys, and a couple from Liverpool, Paul and Pammy.
      Chris'n'Vickie had brought a small 8mm video deck, which we set up so
      Peter et al could see some of the Japanese videos which hadn't made it to
      them yet. In return, Peter showed us some extremely rare video. </P>
    
    <P>We asked how the question and answer session worked, and David said that
      Kate and Lisa went through all the submitted questions, and chose the ones
      that she would answer. As there were over 90 questions submitted, she
      couldn't possibly have time to answer them all. Anyway, about 30 of them
      were, &quot;Are you going to go on tour?&quot; Someone asked, &quot;Would
      you come over to my house for some tea sometime?&quot; So those questions
      had to be weeded out. He said that Kate definitely wanted to call on the
      guy from Brazil, because she wanted to speak to the person who had come
      such a long way. </P>
    
    <P>David had to leave early in the evening. Later, some people went to
      bring back fish and chips for dinner. (Vickie really wanted to experience
      this English dish.) </P>
    
    <P>We planned to go back by the very last train, so Peter called up British
      Rail and they told him there was a train at 23:54. When the time came,
      Paul and Peter drove us in two cars to the train station. Paul and Pammy
      had to go back to Liverpool, so they left us there. One of us looked at
      the schedule, and said, &quot;Uh, oh&quot;. There was no 23:54 train
      listed on Sunday! We waited there twenty minutes until it was obvious that
      no such train existed. It was decided that we should go back to Peter's
      house to decide what to do. The only problem was, with Paul gone there was
      only one car! For awhile we tried to fit all eight of us in Peter's tiny
      European car. This led to some hilarious contortions (Ron took a picture;
      it should be interesting) until we decided that it was simply impossible.
    </P>
    
    <P>Fortunately, there was a taxi at the train station, so half of us took
      that, and the others went in Peter's car. </P>
    
    <P>Back at Peter's place it was decided that he would drive those of us who
      had to leave the next day all the way back to London; the others would
      spend the night there. As my plane left Monday afternoon, I went back to
      London with Peter. </P>
    
    <P>The drive back was lots of fun, although we almost got lost a couple of
      times. We went right through Lewisham, and Peter said, &quot;I don't think
      the pub that the KT Bush Band played at for the first time is on our
      route, but it's in this town and if we pass it I'll tell you.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Another time he said, &quot;If you look between the buildings on the
      right side of the road, you'll see the area where Kate lives nowadays.
      It's about 200 yards away.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>I guess I've gone on long enough. If I think of anything else to say
      later, I'll post it. I was very happy to meet everybody there --especially
      Graham, Meredith, Neil, Ron, and everybody else whose names have just
      slipped my mind. </P>

    <P>Kate says that it wasn't, that she just made it up while sitting around
      one day, but that others said it sounded like a peacock. Then she said: K:
      Let's see if I can do it right now. </P>
    
    <P>And she did! She made the sound just like in the song! Much applause
