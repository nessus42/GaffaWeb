      <BR> Subject: Kate and British Rail </P>
    
    <P> KATE, the Dutch fanzine, Aug. 91, is of course all Dutch!!! All photos
      taken from the KBC magazine. There is however one interesting bit that I
      found amusing. Apparently British Rail has put out a new poster and has
      used Kate Bush as the subject. The photo is of a small girl in Kate's &quot;Wuthering
      Heights&quot; costume from the 1979 tour and it says the following: </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Kate Bush branches out for (one pound)1. </P>
    
    <P>Before they got their Family Railcard, Mr. and Mrs. Bush and their
      little girl were firmly rooted to their own home town. But now they're
      planning to tour the country, with Katherine and up to three of her
      friends going anywhere they like and back for just (one pound)1 each. The
      Railcard only costs (pounds)20 for a year. Yet it also gives up to 4
      grown-ups at least a quarter off most rail fares as well. For details,
      pick up a leaflet from any main British Rail station or your nearest Rail
      Appointed Travel Agent.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>It's WONDERFUL! I would love to get a copy of the poster. Well, I
      suppose I've gone on for long enough so I'll sign off for now. All the
      Best, </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate placed a half-page ad in Billboard! </P>
    
    <P>This week's Billboard (Oct. 12) has a special advertising supplement
      celebrating the 60th anniversary of Abbey Road Studios. On page AR-3, Kate
      placed a half-page ad! It reads, in full: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;WISHING KEN AND EVERYONE </P>
    
    <P>AT ABBEY ROAD </P>
    
    <P>A VERY HAPPY 60th ANNIVERSARY&quot; </P>
    
    <P>WITH LOVE FROM </P>
    
    <P>KATE BUSH </P>
    
    <P>No record company logos or anything else, so it looks like she really
      did place the ad! </P>
    
    <P>A couple of pages later there's a small picture of Kate with this
      caption: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It was a very magical experience. I felt tremendous vibes in
      there, both positive and negative. You know it's built on ley lines, which
      means there are very powerful forces at work.&quot; </P>

    <P>&gt; Does anyone have any idea what she means by that &quot;ley lines&quot;
      comment? </P>
    
    <P>I do, I do, says the Witch who's a Love-hound. Ley lines might best be
      described as the nervous and circulatory system of the planet. Back when
      peoples were still in tune with the Earth and her cycles, temples and
      sacred sites were built in accordance with ley lines, where they lay
      (ahem) in the Earth. Stonehenge, for example, is placed on ley lines. </P>
    
    <P>None of these temples, et cetera, were placed randomly. Ley lines had a
      large part to do with where they were placed (and to be truthful, a lot to
      do with where some early churches were placed too). As Kate said, very
      powerful forces at work. </P>

    <P>A leyline is a stupid pseudoscientic concept. The idea is that there are
      channels of energy in the earth that cross the planet is straight lines.
      Scientific instruments can't detect them. You have to be a &quot;sensitive&quot;

    <P>Ah, now here's a thread I can sink my teeth into. &quot;Stupid and
      pseudo-scientific&quot; huh? And how many experiments have you done? So
      whose opinion are you parroting? And how many experiments did they do?
    </P>
    
    <P>I despise the &quot;scientifically correct&quot; (SC) approach to what
      classes of event are allowed to be considered in our universe. It's based
      on a miniscule success in analysing objects' physical behavior, and claims
      to be able to generalize from that success to absolute certainty about
      what's possible in psychology and every other realm. </P>
    
    <P>It isn't even good physics, usually, because good physics is wide open
      right now as to what macro-level implications quantum mechanics may have.
    </P>
    
    <P>So keep an open mind, please? </P>

      <BR> Subject: My favourite KaTe-quotes.... </P>
    
    <P>Well, I've finally read through both volumes of &quot;The First Twelve
      Years&quot;, so I thought you might like to see some of the more, erm,
      interesting quotes by KaTe from the interviews reproduced therein.... </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Some lyrics take a long time to come, others just come out like...
      like... diarrhoea.&quot; [Record Mirror, 1978] </P>
    
    <P>[About the Bio's Bahnhof TV show] &quot;For 'Wuthering Heights' we had
      backdrops which helped to set the scene. All those black rolling hills
      with lightning bolts painted in and in the middle of it all this dirty
      great big volcano!&quot; [Record Mirror, 1978] </P>
    
    <P>[About KaTe's sexuality and the TKI cover art with KaTe's legs
      prominently displayed] &quot;The picture is creating a feeling of flying
      and movement. If you're up in the sky you're gonna be free. It would look
      a bit wierd if I had a dirty great black serge coat on.&quot; [1978] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;But even if your work is so important to you, it's not actually
      your life. It's only part of your life, so if your work goes you're still
      a human being. You're still living, you can always get a job in Woolworths
      or something.&quot; [Harry Doherty interview, Melody Maker,1978] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I wonder if really beautiful punk groups [...] I wonder if they
      think I'm...not so much square...ah..square, sort of oblong&quot; [Harry
      Doherty interview, Melody Maker,1978] </P>
    
    <P>[About the Tour of Life plans - at that time very secret] &quot;I *know*
      you want to know. But how can I start? If I tell you one thing it'll give
      everything away. It'll bugger everything up!&quot; [John Shearlaw
      interview, 1978] </P>
    
    <P>[About tabloid newspapers] &quot;Hmmm. Y'see, you do a very straight
      interview with these people without ever mentioning sex, but of course
      that's the only angle they write it from when you read it. That kind of
      freaks me out because the public tend to believe it....&quot; [NME, 1979]
    </P>
    
    <P>[About TV news] &quot;Well whenever I see the news it's always the same
      depressing things. Wars, hostages and people's arms hanging off with all
      the tendons hanging out, y'know. So I tend not to watch it much.&quot;
      [NME, 1979] </P>
    
    <P>[About taking a break in 1980] &quot;It wasn't really as if I was
      missing out on normality, I'd rather hang on to madness than normality
      anyway, so it was more like recharging.&quot; [1980] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;There will always be some who are irritated by me. I seem to
      irritate a lot of people, and in a way that's quite a good thing.&quot;
      [1980] </P>
    
    <P>[About The Dreaming album] &quot;But I think a load of people won't like
      it. They probably won't understand what it's about.&quot; [1982] </P>
    
    <P>[About &quot;All the Love&quot;] &quot;I think All the Love definitely
      says something ...not necessarily the negative side of me but the
      self-pitying side. The way you look at human beings and yourself and think
      we're just a heap of shit. If we weren't so scared of saying what we meant
      it would be so much better.[...] It's just a terrible feeling, the thought
      of people having gone without the right amount of feedback. I think that
      really fucks people up.&quot; [1982] </P>
    
    <P>[Interviewer: &quot;I think [your music] is extremely sophisticated.&quot;]
      &quot;Do you? Sophisiticated. Well, I'd rather you said that than
      turd-like.&quot; [1982]</P>
    
    <P>&quot;I have a lot of vivid dreams, most of which I can't mention.&quot;
      [1985] </P>
    
    <P>[About recording vocals] &quot;... the hardest thing for me is to be
      able to feel relaxed enough to be uninhibited. So sometimes I do get a
      just a little drunk - and other times I like to do them with Del because I
      feel much more relaxed than if there's an outside engineer there...&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>[Interviewer: &quot;Can I assume you're pissed out of your head on 'Big
      Sky', on the new album?&quot;] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Yes, I might be getting drunk on that one - the ad-libs on the
      end, that was where I had to get drunk. And definitely on 'Waking the
      Witch' - I was very drunk doing that.&quot; [Peter Swales interview, 1985]
    </P>
    
    <P>[About the favourable US reviews of The Dreaming] &quot;...it seems
      American reviewers take their writing more seriously as a creative form
      than in this country.&quot; [Peter Swales interview, 1985] </P>
    
    <P>[About albums] &quot;I would never break a promise. But I would like to
      say that the next one should be a lot quicker.&quot; [Peter Swales
      interview, 1985] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;I'm left alone to work on albums. If there was any outside
      pressure I'd completely go under and probably have to be put away in an
      institution somewhere.&quot; [1989] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It's very important to try and learn to love people as much as you
      can but we all get so scared. It's only when people are at a point in
      their lives when they get such shocks that they take it as it really
      should be. The rest of us just seem to piss about!&quot; [1989] </P>
    
    <P>[About Deeper Undertanding] &quot;I dont have a downer on computers at
      all. I think they're really good and very important&quot; [Raw, 1989] </P>
    
    <P>[About Love and Anger] &quot;Really, it was a bugger, that song. And in
      some ways I *still* don't know what I'm wanting to say. But what the
      hell....&quot; [Raw, 1989] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;The fact is that the last time I toured was ten years ago, yet
      people are *still* asking me whether I'm going to tour again. Why on Earth
      haven't they given up? Why are they so patient with me? Why do they even
      care?&quot; [Raw, 1989] </P>
    
    <P>[About being a sex-symbol] &quot;I don't know really. I'm just small and
      ridiculous! How people see me is up to them, it's not my problem.&quot;
      [1989] </P>
    
    <P>&quot;There's some really bad stuff happening in pop music, isn't there?&quot;

    <P>According to next week's Radio Times, as part of the National Music Day
      celebrations, Kate Bush will join the Great Elastic Band on Clapham Common
      (London). This is billed as the gathering of Britain's largest band,
      incorporating famous names and orchestras from the world of jazz, pop and
      classical music, both amateur and professional in a cornucopia of
      common-interest enthusiasts. </P>
    
    <P>BBC 1 has a programme on the event at 12 noon on Sunday 28th June
      (National Music Day). No other details but they do print a small colour
      photo of Kate peering round a tree. Neil </P>

      <BR> Subject: Another Kate disappointment </P>
    
    <P>I am sorry to have to report that Kate did not make an appearance on
      BBC-1 on Sunday as billed in the Radio Times. In fact, there was no
      mention of her at all. The event which was part of the National Music Day
      was something of a flop all round, judging by the number of people who
      turned up (despite the presence of Mick Jagger backstage). </P>
    
    <P>The Great Elastic Band featured no-one more famous than Pat Cash,
      Screaming Lord Sutch and the Irish singer who won the Eurovision Song
      Contest! Along with assorted orchestras, marhing bands and amateur
      musicians they attempted to play &quot;With a Little Help from my Friends&quot;
      - Mick Jagger wisely decided not to join in. Whether Kate ever planned to
      attend or whether the Radio Times cocked it up is open to question. </P>
    
    <P>So added the fact that there was no new Kate music in the TV special &quot;The
      Last Show on Earth&quot; last month, it has been a month of raised and
      dashed hopes in the Kate world. Such is the fate of all bushaholics. </P>
    
    <P>Apologies for raising hopes of a Kate sighting. </P>

    <P>Kate has some unpleasant neighbours.... </P>
    
    <P>We got several general election leaflets delivered yesterday, including
      one from the British National Party (a fascist neo-nazi political party).
      Apparently the BNP HQ is in &quot;Upper Wickham Lane, Welling, Kent&quot;.
      Doesn't sound a million miles away from East Wickham Farm, does it? And
      their PO Box seems to be at the same post office as the KBC's..... </P>

      <BR> Subject: Gered Mankowitz Exhibition </P>
    
    <P>&gt; From: Scott Telford &lt;s.telford@ed.ac.uk&gt; </P>
    
    <P>&gt; PS. Also in RC is an item about an exhibition Gered Mankowitz is
      putting on at the Cromwell &amp; Ward Gallery in London this month. The
      article implies that some of his work with KaTe will be there ... </P>
    
    <P>There is also something in the October issue of Q magazine about this
      exhibition. Below a picture of the leotard shot is the following text:
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;It's a beautiful and very successful image in a very commercial
      world,&quot; says Gered Mankowitz of the controversial 1978 shot which
      introduced Kate Bush to a startled British public and now re-emerges as
      one of the star turns in his exhibition at the Cormweel and Ward gallery,
      dean Street, London, Sept 14-27. &quot;I thought Wuthering Heights was a
      record people would want to hear again because they couldn't believe their
      ears, so I wanted to give them a picture they would want to see again
      because they couldn't believe their eyes. Kate was totally happy with the
      session at the time. I gather later on she came to feel it was a bit
      sexist, but I still think it's an entirely appropriate way to present a
      genuinely beautiful woman. Of course, the way the poster designers cropped
      the picture just below the nipples wasn't accidental and did no harm to
      the impact it made.&quot; </P>

    <P>Dear Friends, </P>
    
    <P>One matter which stirred little interest when we mentioned it in
      HOMEGROUND some time ago was the possible family link between Kate and the
      other Bush (13th cousin to the Queen) that resides currently in the White
      House. No - seriously! In 1988 you see, at the time of George Bush's
      election the usual people over here did the usual geealogical research and
      came up with the following facts: in 1631 Reynold Bush (George's direct
      ancestor) emigrated to the Massachussets colony with a group of fellow
      puritans. </P>
    
    <P>Reynold Bush's family came from the parish of Messing in the English
      county of Essex (where there are records of the family name back to 1391).
      The village of Messing is just 8 miles from the village of Pebmarsh.
      Kate's direct ancestors (documented - at least according to Fred Vermorel
      - and in this connection I think we can trust his research - back to the
      11th century) came from the village of Pebmarsh. Sadly no-one has done any
      research to discover if there is a common ancestor. </P>

    <P>Don't think anybody else has posted this - the Jan 2 edition of The Mail
      on Sunday's &quot;Femail&quot; section had a survey on the highest paid

      1993. It was compiled by a Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, but it doesn't go into
      detail on his sources. </P>
    
    <P>Kate is listed as number 26 with an income of L500k and &quot;overall
      fortune estimated at L5 million&quot; (after Enya, L4 million due to &quot;huge
      earnings in America&quot; - since when was Enya British anyway? 8-), Annie
      Lennox, L3.1 million, Cathy Dennis, L2.1 million and Siobhan Fahey of

    <P>It would be interesting to hear if this is real, if Kate is planning to
      hire Daniel Lanois as a producer/co-producer on her next record. He has
      worked well with Peter Gabriel, and Kate may well benefit from a sensitive
      co-producer. At a minimum, it might help her get a record out a bit
      quicker. But why do people insist on attempting to romanticly link her
      with every single male she has ever had contact with? </P>

    <P>Stephen Golden asks: </P>
    
    <P>&gt;So we all know Kate likes to take her time between albums, and she
      doesn't tour, and she does very little publicity... So what does she do
      with all of her free time? Does she have any hobbies to keep her busy? Is
      she recording her own music for private consumption and experimentation?
    </P>
    
    <P>As near as we can tell, she is quite fond of taking long holidays and
      has several different vacation residences. She doesn't work continuiously
      on her albums, taking long breaks to re-charge. Many of her non-work
      interests have made their way into her work; </P>
    
    <P>Her interest in various religious beliefs on _The Kick Inside_ She had
      just learned to roller-skate at the time of _Sat In Your Lap_ She was into
      archery at the time of _Running Up The Hill_ She is a major film fan,
      going out to the cinema and renting loads of videos, and this inspired
      several songs. She does go to concerts, seeing Stevie Wonder inspired _Sat
      In Your Lap_ </P>
    
    <P>She also enjoys cooking, cleaning (really!) and most importantly
      gardening. One interview made quite a bit of the &quot;herbacious border&quot;
      around her garden (an apparent reference to her rumored enjoyment of
      smokable herbs.) </P>
    
    <P>Basically, she is a person with a life outside her work and the capacity
      to enjoy a light level of activity. She has friends outside of music (one
      KBC newsletter refered to a phone call from a friend at the Hare Krishna
      Temple.) She doesn't *have* to work, she doesn't even have to release
      albums. One estimate had her as the seventh or eighth richest woman in
      England. </P>

    <P>Hi, I hear the Efteling special is included on the Love-Hounds
      collection! Now that's good news - the copy I have isn't all that good.
    </P>
    
    <P>Anyway, some readers on this list may remember the discussion weeks ago
      about the Efteling, and the fact that there would be a gravestone to
      commemorate Kate's appearance on the grounds of this park. Well, I called
      back to them and got the following information: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Although a few people still recall the appearance and recording of
      this special, nothing is known about a commemorative gravestone. We have
      to assume there is none.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>So there you have it. The passage in &quot;Kate Bush complete&quot; and &quot;The
      garden&quot; should read: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;[April 1978] </P>
    
    <P>[...] Kate makes a 25 minute television special at De Efteling in
      Kaatsheuvel, a fairy theme park. She also performs on the VOOR DE VUIST
      WEG TV programme.&quot; </P>

      <BR> Subject: kate's pension </P>
    
    <P>in the new Q magazine (April 95) there is an article called &quot;Ker-Ching&quot;
      that looks at how much rock stars make, etc. Under the sub-heading: &quot;Kate
      Bush's Pension Plan&quot;: </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Pensions are a serios business for pop stars. They get lots of
      money when they're young and not so much probably when they're old, unless
      they've put a lot of their income into pensions. Pensions also happen to
      be a good way of saving tax and preserving wealth for the future at the
      same time. Kate Bush makes huge pension contributions. In 1992, for
      example, she paid herself &amp;130,000 in fees but her total pension
      contributions were &amp;223,000. In 1989 she'd put &amp;476,000 into the
      pension fund.But last year she stopped. She'd probably over-funded it.
      There's only so much you can put into a pension fund. The money she's put
      in will have saved her a third in tax, so rather than pay away that money,
      given the fact that she doesn't need it, she'd say, OK, I'll put it into
      the pension. She could retire at 50, or 45, and by that time she'd have a
      few million pounds in the fund, so that'll do nicely for the rest of her
      life. She wouldn't have to perform again--not that she does anyway, haha!&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>all quotes courtesy of the guy who wrote the book that the article draws
      from. It goes on a bit and lists Kate's pension payments 1985-1992, which
      total close to a million and a half pounds as of 1992. . . . yeesh! i
      think this sheds some light on an earlier thread, months old now, about
      kate vs. tori and record sales and blah blah blah . . . . the old gel is
      doing ok for herself. . . . . not madonna, but who'd want to be?! </P>

    <P>A couple of 'Kate spots' in this month's 'Q' magazine. Details follow.
    </P>
    
    <P>Sir Cliff Richard, Kate Bush, Lisa Stansfield, Sting, Elton John, Pet
      Shop Boys and Seal have signed a leather-bound edition of The Guinness
      Book Of Hit Singles to be auctioned by Sotheby's on September 13 and 14,
      celebrating the publication's 10th edition. Proceeds to The Terrence
      Higgins Trust, Lord's Taverners and Roy Castle Cancer Appeal. </P>
    
    <P>Wait, there's more. </P>
    
    <P>'Q' asked readers to write and tell them about records that changed
      their lives. Kate, of course, got a mention. </P>
    
    <P>DAVID MAYALL Rochdale </P>
    
    <P>Kate Bush The Hounds Of Love </P>
    
    <P>Studying for accountancy exams in the summer of 1990, 25-year-old David
      Mayall was getting himself in a panic. It's the night before the exam, and
      he has avoided all notions of study for much of the year, and so is in the
      midst of a desperate all-night cram. Cole's Notes on Corporation Supertax
      staring him the face, he devises a plan. &quot;I decided I would have a
      blitz for half an hour or so and then completely freak out to some very
      loud music for 10 minutes to help bash it into my brain.&quot; The track
      he chose was Kate Bush's The Hounds Of Love, mainly because &quot;the howl
      in the chorus just seemed to work for me at the time&quot;. Every half an
      hour, he would take to his balcony and let rip. It worked. He passed. It
      changed his life. &quot;Unfortuantly. So I've got a very dull job now.
      Thanks a bunch, Kate.&quot; </P>

      <BR> Subject: Del and Kate </P>
    
    <P>After the alleged breakup was big news on r.m.g, Kate did a signing at
      Tower Records in NYC and Del was there. Some fan (identify yourself if
      you're still here) was standing with Del and talking to him during part of
      the signing, and when Del turned to tell Kate something, he called her &quot;Puddin'.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P>:-) Ok, hardly ironclad evidence, but I've broken up with women before
      and remained friends and associates and I wouldn't go around calling one
      of them Puddin' after the fact.... Not that I called any of 'em Puddin'
      before, but you know what I mean. </P>

    <P>Hi all. </P>
    
    <P>Sorry this is so long after the event, a photocopy of the article only
      recently landed on my doorstep and it took me a while to get around to
      typing it up. This combined with a weeks worth of Kate partys all around
      this land :) </P>
    
    <P>'The Reading Standard' July 20 1995 </P>
    
    <P>POP STAR FINDS HER 3/4m ukp DREAM HOME </P>
    
    <P>Singer Kate Bush has splashed out 750,000 ukp on a secret dream home
      near Reading, it was revealed in the Reading Evening Post. </P>
    
    <P>The star has brought up a 14-bedroom mansion, which has been empty for
      the last 15 years, on the leafy outskirts of the town. </P>
    
    <P>Sources told the Post the 37-year-old performer, who leapt to fame with
      the chart hit Wuthering Heights in 1978, planned to spend another 2m ukp
      on doing up the property. </P>
    
    <P>The house is believed to have previously been owned by an Arab sheik who
      used the property to store his collection of carpets, worth thousands of
      pounds. </P>
    
    <P>Kate has visited the house several times in the last few months, to see
      how builders are getting on with converting the 160-year-old listed
      building. </P>
    
    <P>One source said at one point workmen had slung a 60,000 ukp Persian
      carpet into a builder's skip, thinking it was worthless rubbish. </P>
    
    <P>He said: &quot;The property has been left empty for some time and needs
      a lot of work on it. The building is listed so they are waiting for
      planning permission before they can carry out a lot of the work. It will
      be another six months before anyone can move in.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>He said the house also contained a rare English oak-panelled floor,
      worth more than 20,000 ukp. </P>
    
    <P>The star is not the first pop talent to have lived in the area. </P>
    
    <P>One neighbour confided: &quot;I am not surprised really. I'm not sure
      why but we've had quite a few famous musicians living around here. Lyn
      Paul from the New Seekers used to live next door for several years - her
      parents were very nice and always passed the time of day.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Members of other sixties bands have also been former residents. </P>
    
    <P>Another neighbour said: &quot;It is a lovely house. My family have lived
      here for years and my mother used to work for some of the previous owners.
      We have heard rumours for months but I am not that bothered really -
      although I admit I am a fan of her music I don't think we will be seeing
      much of her.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Reclusive Kate's present home is a farm in North Kent where she lives
      with members of her family. </P>
    
    <P>----- </P>
    
    <P>I hope that this is of some interest to someone. The neighbour who
      admits to being a fan of her music makes it sound like some kind of crime
      to be a fan. Be proud to be a fan and shout it from the roof-tops, well,
      at least wear your r.m.g t-shirt with pride! </P>

      <BR> Subject: Re: New Home for Kate </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Where is Reading? I wonder what a single gal shall do with such a
      large abode? Perhaps, one day she will have a party and invite all of us
      who have loved her music for so long. </P>
    
    <P>I can tell you where Reading is, about 40 miles due west of central
      London. Population about 100,000 (a guess), sort of around the area where
      many computer companies have located in the UK, if a 40 mile area can be
      considered to be close. </P>
    
    <P>Reading is famous for being where Brunell built a railway station out of
      London on its way out west, as a result the railway track is quite
      straight and the trains do a nice 125 miles per hour, in good comfort.
    </P>
    
    <P>Many people who live in Reading, do so they can take the train directly
      to London in a relatively quick time (daily). It has the advantage of
      being relatively close to the countryside too, depending on where you live
      (of course). </P>
    
    <P>Peronsally I cannot see Kate living &quot;in&quot; Reading, it'll
      probably be in one of the many small villages outside of Reading, which
      mostly have the big houses and excellent surrounding countryside. </P>
    
    <P>The quote mentioned her moving away from her family, with a 14 bedroom
      house (of which some will probably become part of her studio/sound rooms -
      my guess), I could imagine that Paddy might live somewhere nearby, to keep
      the flow of new instruments on Kates albums. </P>
    
    <P>I used to live in Camberley (about 14 miles SE of Reading), and with the
      M25 on a good day you can get to North Kent (where I used to live before
      Camberley, and my brother still does) in about an hour or so, it's just 68
      miles. So from Reading maybe 90 minutes to 2 hours (on a bad day), not
      *really* that far away from her family. Maybe I've got used to distances
      here in the USA (where I now live). I guess that is far enough to not have
      them on the doorstep, but not too far to visit for the weekend, and easy
      for birthdays, Christmas, etc. </P>

    <P>This is exactly what we didn't need to hear! (sorry that you were the

    <P> Anyone remember the *last* time Kate moved? The insanely long period of
      building a new studio? Do you think she's going to commute from Berkshire
      to Kent every day to use the tiny old studio behind East Wickham Farm?
    </P>
    
    <P> Let's see...first she has to get the house in order...as it's a
      historic house everything takes twice as long...double that for &quot;kate-time&quot;...then
      she has to build the new studio...then she has to get the new garden in...
      that'll take at least a year... </P>

    <P>Hi all, </P>
    
    <P>The original posting about Kates new house said it to be an existing
      house, a listed building too, which will (depending on the level of
      preservation on it) mean that not much alteration will be allowed, at
      least not exterior-wise. I could imagine a studio will possibly be part of
      the internal changes though, although at the (lack of) speed of building
      approval departments in the UK, we should blame them if Kates next album
      is not on her settling in on the 4 year release schedule (ie Nov 97). </P>

    <P>Hi KaTeFans, </P>
    
    <P>I heard an interesting rumour today. I had to get a NTSC to PAL
      conversion of the latest Lovehounds tape as I am the local tape tree node.
      When I went to the video conversion place to pick up my tape, the guy that
      did the copying, after commenting how interesting the tape was, said that
      he mentioned the tape to a friend, and that friend said he had heard a
      rumour that Kate had gone to school for a few months in Canberra! I know
      that she visited Australia with her parents when she was young, but I
      didnt know she stayed for that long. </P>
    
    <P>Does anyone else know about this??? </P>

    <P>Hello Friends, </P>
    
    <P>HOMEGROUND 56 should be finished in a few days time, and hopefully out
      by mid-October. </P>
    
    <P>Regarding the business about Kate supposedly moving to Reading. I ought
      to say that there is no confirmation of this at all. In fact we at
      HOMEGROUND are rather skeptical. We've seen many media stories about Kate
      get going and acquire great detail, only to turn out to be completely
      without foundation. This may be one of them. I hope we might have some
      information either way fairly shortly, and I'll let you know. </P>
    
    <P>Regarding Colin Lloyd Tucker's new album, &quot;Songs of Life Love and
      Liquid&quot; I can definitely say that Kate is not on the album, and that
      the flyer from Humbug records is inaccurate. Krys spoke to Colin this week
      and he has sent us a copy of the CD. Paddy is on the album! </P>

      <BR> Subject: her personality </P>
    
    <P>&gt; And finnaly Kate is an Extrovert...Kate is a Leo, that meens
      Flamboyant and Showey. Have you Seen live at Hammersmith Oden?? :) </P>
    
    <P>The much-maligned Fred Vermoral books actually have some very
      interesting suppositions about Kate's personality. The general impression
      from his interviews with her old schoolmates and friends is of an
      *introvert*. </P>
    
    <P> Fred was of the opinion that *Kate* Bush is a creation of *Catherine*
      Bush, a painfully shy, quiet person. My own opinion is that Kate's talent
      was/is so great that it practically forced her into the limelight. One of
      the most constant themes in interviews is her belief that &quot;the music
      is the most important thing&quot; that it should speak for it's self. Her
      original intention was to simply be a songwriter, that she had no great
      desire to be a performer. </P>
    
    <P> Believe in astrology grants one an amazingly flexibile interpetive
      technique. If the person does not fit the inane idea that everyone on
      earth can fit into one of a dozen types...well, they just claim that some
      additional data is needed. &quot;Of, of *course*! She has a greebtharb
      rising!&quot; (or some such.) Such nonsense may have had some useful
      purpose in a simple farming society, but it's just silly now. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; You will neaver see Kate with a man who isnt very handsom, and she
      rarely plays things down. </P>
    
    <P> Um...sorry, but you *really* don't know much about Kate. She has been
      with the same guy for many years. Del is a very nice guy with a great
      sense of humor, but...&quot;very handsome&quot;? As a hetrosexual male I'm
      a lousy judge of male attractiveness but I've *never* heard anyone, female
      or male describe Del as a hunk. </P>
    
    <P> As for &quot;playing things down&quot;...you just described an aspect
      of practically every interview with her. She is *very* British. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I think a lot of people loive Kate so much that they want to belive
      her like themselves. </P>
    
    <P> Well, this is a moment of personal clarity. </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I just like who she shows me she is. </P>
    
    <P> Please read as many interviews as possible. She is a far more complex
      person than you apparently see. </P>

      <BR> From: chrisw@miso.wwa.com (Chris Williams)
      <BR> Subject: her names </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I think this is a fascinating topic. The amazing persona seen in
      some of the videos is so different to the Kate we see in interviews. Is
      *Kate* Bush a real person - or is she a creation of *Catherine* ? </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Does anyone actually know what her friends and family call her??
      Has she actually changed her name offically? </P>
    
    <P>She has used three names: Cathy, Catherine and Kate. Her brother John's
      book &quot;Cathy&quot; was the planned first of three books to match the
      changes in her chosen name. Presumably, the &quot;Cathy&quot; photos cover
      the period when she was using that name. She later decided to use the
      complete version &quot;Catherine.&quot; I'm not sure when the transition
      to &quot;Kate&quot; happened. As far as we know, none of the changes have
      been &quot;official,&quot; just a person chosing to use a shorter form of
      their name. </P>
    
    <P> We have heard her brothers John and Paddy refer to her as &quot;Kate.&quot;
      I can't recall her mother or father using her name in the only interview
      either of them participated in. Del is on record calling her &quot;puddin'.&quot;
    </P>
    
    <P> She and Paddy were apparently quite fond of making up silly names for
      play when they were kids. Some of these have popped up. Once, when she was
      asked &quot;what is your favorite cover of one of your songs&quot; in the
      (no longer published) Kate Bush Club Newsletter, she replied: </P>
    
    <P> &quot;Poor Old Flea by Madame Maria Nanky&quot; </P>
    
    <P> I assume that this was one of Kate's play names. </P>
    
    <P> The editor of the KBC Newsletter was a a person named &quot;Nicholas
      Wade.&quot; Mr. Wade's existence has never been comfirmed. Presumably, if
      he exists we might have heard *something* from or about him in all these
      years. </P>
    
    <P> The newsletter also featured stories by one &quot;Enrico Baratta&quot;
      (sp?). We have no idea who Enrico was either, but his profile can be
      spotted in the &quot;Experiment IV&quot; video. </P>
    
    <P> The people who can explain all this ain't talking. </P>

    <P>As I said earlier, I hoped I'd be able to clarify the newspaper story
      about Kate moving to a new house in Reading Berks. </P>
    
    <P>It seems that it is true. At least to the extent that Kate has bought
      the property, and is engaged in the process of having it altered to suit
      her needs, including the addition of another wing to accomodate the
      studio. </P>
    
    <P>But the final date of moving is not fixed, and apparently not yet in
      sight. There's a lot to do! </P>
    
    <P>I said before that we at HOMEGROUND didn't rate this story. Now that we
      find it is true, we're just a little worried at what it means. </P>

    <P>Anyway, one of the things that I thought very odd (and failed to
      photograph) was the presence of round, black charred areas along the path
      leading up to the fence on the back side of the farm. </P>
    
    <P>At first, we dismissed the idea that ordinary fires had been set there,
      knowing instead that they were the remains of Kate-fans that had
      spontaneously burst into flames from the sheer excitement of being so
      close to where Kate had been. </P>
    
    <P>After some reflection however, I'm glad that Kate herself wasn't in
      residence on the day we came to slink around her back gate. </P>
    
    <P>I've come to the conclusion that the aforementioned Kate-fans had been
      dealt a far more sinister fate. </P>
    
    <P>You see, as it turns out, in the shed by the house where the
      Cloudbusting machine is kept, there's also another, more nefarious
      contraption: The FanBusting Machine... </P>
    
    <P>Regards, Lance </P>

      <BR> From: Peter Fitzgerald-Morris &lt;pfm@glass.jecsystems.com&gt;
      <BR> Subject: Kate's Spirituality </P>
    
    <P>Hello All, </P>
    
    <P>Read the recent posts on Kate and Wicca etc. Those interested might care
      to read my ongoing series in HOMEGROUND (Advert!) &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;
      about a load of stuff on similar themes. Basically it takes off from
      Lily's spoken dedication, a quotation from Vedic scripture used virtually
      verbatim in the Charge of the Goddess, the basic document of modern
      paganism. </P>
    
    <P>There are many and various stories about Kate being &quot;initiated into
      Wicca&quot;. I regard most of them with a truckload of salt. It is clear
      Kate has explored many religious, spiritual, and philosophical fields. It
      runs in the family. No doubt her own ideas are an amalgum of things she
      found helpful and useful in these many fields. </P>
    
    <P>The Gurdjieff/Sufi ideas and images in her early work were probably
      inherited from family discussions originated by John Carder Bush, a poet,
      author, and seeker himself. In any person born and brought up in a Roman
      Catholic family some traces of that religion must remain. She had friends
      in the Krishna movement. I have thought to have seen in Kate's work images
      suggested by Golden Dawn type ritual practice, of which &quot;Lily&quot;
      is the most recent and obvious. </P>
    
    <P>At the end of it, Kate's ideas are probably most ideosyncratically her
      own. </P>
    
    <P>Regarding Reading etc, I've just seen Karen's query regarding the type
      of studio to be put in there (that digest arrived late). Allwe know at the
      moment is that it is a sound recording studio. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Rocket's Tail </P>
    
    <P>Here is the text of a letter I have just mailed off to the KBC. I
      thought you might find it amusing: </P>
    
    <P>I have the privilege of working for MIT on a NASA project known as XTE
      (X-ray Timing Explorer). XTE will be an orbiting telescope that will
      search for cosmic X-ray sources, such as black holes, neutron stars, white
      dwarves, and active galactic nuclei. XTE is currently scheduled to be
      launched on a Delta rocket in just a few days (December 10th). Being in a
      position of some responsibility, I have snuck into the flight software ROM
      a line from a song by Ms. Bush! </P>
    
    <P>The &quot;flight software ROM&quot; is a read-only memory chip that is
      an essential component of the telescope and it will be launched into orbit
      along with the rest of the satellite. The text of the secret message that
      is hidden within the ROM is </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Peek-a-boo little Earth&quot; --Kate Bush </P>
    
    <P>Knowing Ms. Bush's penchant for secret messages, I thought she might
      appreciate having a secret message by her launched into space and put into
      orbit around the Earth. This is the least I could do in return for all the
      moments of pleasure her music has given me over the years. </P>
    
    <P>Sincerely, </P>
    
    <P>|&gt;ouglas /\lan </P>

    <P>[re demos:] </P>
    
    <P>Sounds very good! Go on with that, Uli! Anyone in Germany with the EP's?
      But remember, all this is VERY illegal! Better discuss most of it in
      private! </P>
    
    <P>Do not infuriate KaTe! </P>
    
    <P>An angry Kate? This just reminds me of a little article: </P>
    
    <P>- ----------------- </P>
    
    <P>Daily Mirror, Sunday Feb. 17th 1990 Bush Wack </P>
    
    <P>Sultry singer Kate Bush doesn't look in the mood to say cheese as she
      finds herself staring into photographer Robin Kennedy's lens. </P>
    
    <P>A few moments later it was Kate who snapped - with a well aimed boot up
      the cameraman's backside. The pop star had to be restrained by long-time
      boyfriend Del Palmer as she and Kennedy bumped into each other outside a
      London nightspot. Afterwards the cameraman said: &quot;I didn't think that
      anyone so small would be able to kick so hard.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>- ------------------- </P>
    
    <P>Alive and kicking, heh? </P>
    
    <P>The article is accompanied with a heavy shot. A really angry KaTe. Woah!
      She's very furious! Very! Nothing &quot;I'm quite a happy little soul&quot;...
      more an outburst of the lion. Be careful! This was serious anger not fun!
      For all that she looks somewhat BEAUTIFUL! </P>
    
    <P>I'm bewildered... (she must be... mmh) </P>

      <BR> Subject: The unknown KT poem! </P>
    
    <P>In the Cann/Mayes Visual Documentary a poem is mentioned, called </P>
    
    <P>&quot;A Tear and a Raindrop Met&quot; </P>
    
    <P>KT wrote that poem in Form II (1970/71) at St. Joseph's Convent Grammar
      School for the end of year school magazine. The other mentioned poems are
      published in the Paul Kerton Book. </P>
    
    <P>Can someone in Kent investigate in this issue? This means drive to the
      school and look up the poem in the library? Maybe you can find other
      treasures! </P>
    
    <P>Can you think of anything better to spend your time? </P>
