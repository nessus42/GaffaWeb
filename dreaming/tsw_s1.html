<P>Heard this (the song, that is) on Radio One today. (A rare display of taste
on their  part.) Sounds good - strong percussive backbeat, lots of pipes,
whistles and fiddles  backing Kate's vox. The arrangements sound very ethnic -
wanders between  Arab/Jewish melodies on the pipes and whistles with Irish
fiddling coming in later.

The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>I Thought you love-hounds across the pond would be interested in this. Since
you  wont be getting this as the US single and there is probably some interest
in what the  &lt;feel&gt; of the forthcoming album is I have tried to unravel
the lyrics to the two  tracks on the CD single : The Sensual World and Walk
Straight Down The Middle  (the third is just an instrumental version of TSW).
The CD single was released in  Britain on Monday. Theres a couple of places
where the lyric is pretty inaudible.  Anyway here goes: 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm Yes - Then I've taken the kiss of seed cake that foam his mouth <BR>
Going deep south go down <BR> Mmmmm Yes - To the six big wheels and work damn
hard <BR> He's up off of his head and into the flesh 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm Yes - He said I was the flower of the mountain yes 
</P>
<P>But now I've powers ?o'er ernos? body 
</P>
<P>Yes 
</P>
<P>Slippin out of the page into the sensual world <BR> Slippin out... 
</P>
<P>To where the water and the earth caress and down on the peach says <BR>
Mmmmm Yes - do I look for those millionaires <BR> Like a mad ?Coralean? girl
<BR> When I could wear <BR> The sunset 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm Yes - And how we'd wished to live in the sensual world <BR> It don't
need words - just one kiss in another <BR> Steppin out of the page into the
sensual world <BR> Steppin out of the page into the sensual world 
</P>
<P>Then the arrows of desire (remind) the speech <BR> Mmmmm Yes - Then he
whispered would I <BR> Mmmmm Yes - Be safe <BR> Mmmmm Yes - From mountain
flowers 
</P>
<P>And at first with a charm around him <BR> Mmmmm Yes - He loosened it so if
<BR> It slipped - between my breasts <BR> He'd rescue it 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm Yes <BR> And his spark took life in my hand <BR> and mmmmm Yes <BR>
I said, oooh yes <BR> Not yet 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm Yes 
</P>
<P>Mmmmm Yes 
</P>
<P>Yes 
</P>
<P>(As you can see - it's a pretty wierd set of words and without the music
probably  doubly so.)

</P>
<P> Thanks for the lyrics, Graham. I don't think them &quot;wierd&quot; at all.

</P>
<P>The word &quot;seedcake&quot; is definitely a reference to Ulysses by James
Joyce. Lazy  scoffers who want to check this out fast should turn to the last
line of the book and  compare it to Kate's lyric 
</P>
<P>&quot;mmmmm yes, I said oooh yes not yet.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The clearest description of the seedcake episode is in the &quot;Sirens&quot;
chapter (#11) 
</P>
<P>&quot;he said I was the flower of the mountain yes&quot; might be from the
same episode. 
</P>
<P>Is this song about Molly Bloom's desire to be &quot;slippin out of the page&quot;?

</P>
<P>These are not the first Joycean references in Kate's work.

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Getting Into The Sensual
World 
</P>
<P>Finally! IED got hold of the new single today at last, in 12&quot; and CD-5&quot;
formats. (7&quot;  and cassette singles are expected soon, though the latter is
going to be very scarce.)  Incidentally, Los Angeles's Kate maniacs have been
coming out in force to get  copies: The shopkeepers said the new single would
arrive at 6 p.m. this evening, not  before. IED arrived at 6:01, and already all
8 copies of the CD single had been bought  or set aside (for people who had
placed large deposits in advance). IED was 10  seconds from being too late to
get the last CD-single, for another fan was right on  his heels into the shop!
And everyone wanted multiple copies, too! The woman  behind the counter said
something like &quot;Jeez, you Kate Bush fans are really  obsessive!&quot; IED
assured her earnestly that there was a simple reason for that: KATE  BUSH IS
GOD. She wasn't converted, however. 
</P>
<P>The a-side is simply the album cut of TSW : just under 4 minutes. The b-side
has  the instrumental version (exactly the same as the a-side but without the
lead vocal);  and Walk Straight Down the Middle. The CD-single has the exact
same contents as  the 12&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The cover of both is the same: a black-and-white photograph (printed in John
 Carder Bush's lush purplish-brownish-black &quot;duo-tone&quot; colour) of Kate
on the  front, with the title, in spindly sans-serif type along the right side,
reading from top  to bottom: THE SENSUAL WORLD KATE BUSH. The back side is in
plain black  with all writing in gold letters. The production credits are
interesting: all tracks were  produced by Kate Bush. But TSW was &quot;recorded
by&quot; Del Palmer; while WSDTM  was &quot;engineered&quot; by Del Palmer. A
rather mysterious distinction, no? 
</P>
<P>The labels of the 12&quot; are standard EMI black, but the CD-single has a
special  black label-side with the TSW -style gold lettering on it--extremely
cool-looking! 
</P>
<P>The photograph itself is gorgeous. It's just a very simple, straightforward 
half-length portrait shot of Kate in a black, sleeveless dance leotard top, hair
loose  and copious. She faces the camera nearly head-on, but is looking off
slightly to the  right. Her arms are held out in front of her, loosely clasped
together at the wrist.  Behind her is an unseen back-light, and there is a kind
of mist in the blackness  beyond. 
</P>
<P>IED earlier described a very similar shot which was printed in NME's news 
announcement last issue. In that photo, from the same session, everything is
more or  less the same except that Kate is looking directly into the camera, and
in her right  hand is--a peach. 
</P>
<P>In the photograph on the cover of the new single the peach has become--dust,
 slipping through her fingers. (&quot;Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.&quot;)
Typically exKuisiTe,  purely Katian implication and sug-gestion, rather than
direct statement: for if one  had not seen the NME photo, one would not know The
Whole Story behind the  image. 
</P>
<P>IED has had a stab at transcribing the lyrics of The Sensual World, too. By
the  way, this record has got to be the most inaccessible piece of songwriting
Kate has  ever done--yet it's also one of her most immediately memorable and
accessible  records she's ever done. There's never been anything like The
Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>IED does not for the life of him know what the specific subject of the song
is, but  he'd be willing to bet there's some very particular literary source for
it. So many  crucial words are hard to decipher, however, that IED can make no
guess as to what  that source might be--a fairy tale, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>IED has no confidence in his own version of the lyrics. &quot;----&quot;
marks equal total  failure; all the other words are tentative at best. IED has
never had so much  difficulty hearing the words Kate is singing than he has in
this case. It's as though  Kate had been inspired to create one of the most
infectious, stylistically eclectic pop  records, yet had decided to record the
vocal so only she could really hear it ! It's like  she made this record
literally for herself! It's...oh, words just fail IED--he's  &quot;stepping out
off the page, into the sensual world&quot;! 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Graham for starting the ball rolling. IED reproduces Graham's
version  line by line, with IED's below each one. In many cases Graham and IED
hear the  same words, but (as is to be expected with a vocal like this one, sung
in such an  uncompromisingly private way) in many other cases there are
discrepancies--though  again IED is not at all sure which version, if either, is
&quot;correct&quot;.

Subject: TSW and Molly Bloom 
</P>
<P> Greetings from the cutting edge of Kate Bush scholarship! 
</P>
<P>First off, a correction to yesterday's assertion that the best place to look
for the  seedcake passage in Ulysses was chapter 11, the Sirens. I meant the
other chapter in  which Bloom is in a public eating-place: chapter 8, the
Lestrygonians. 
</P>
<P>To make up for this, I can now quote page numbers: 
</P>
<P>Vintage (Random House) ed., 1961: p. 176 
</P>
<P>Penguin Modern Classics ed., 1984: p. 144 
</P>
<P>The passage which is of more direct relevance to The Sensual World is the
final  page-and-a-half or so of the book, Vintage p. 782-3/Penguin p. 642-4. 
</P>
<P>These pages contain the lines: 
</P>
<P>&quot;I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth&quot; (643 line 14) 
</P>
<P>[Kate reverses this in TSW] 
</P>
<P>&quot;flower of the mountain&quot; ( 643 line 16, 644 line 2) 
</P>
<P>&quot;big wheels&quot; (643 line 31) 
</P>
<P>[but I don't understand this reference in either context] 
</P>
<P>&quot;sunsets&quot; (643 line 39) 
</P>
<P>The physical setting of the episode is on a hill to the north of Dublin,
overlooking  the sea, hence possibly 
</P>
<P>&quot;where the water and the earth caress&quot;[TSW line 10]. 
</P>
<P>An edited version off the passage, beginning with the line 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd love to have the whole place swimming in roses&quot; (642 line 42)
has been set to  music (!) for soprano (!) solo and orchestra by Stephen Albert
under the title of  &quot;Flower of the Mountain&quot; (!). I have located the
piano reduction of Albert's score,  which was published in 1986 by Schirmer. It
is orchestrated for 2 flutes (2nd  doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd doubling
English horn), 2 A clarinets, 2 F horns, 2 Bb  trumpets, percussion, piano, harp
and strings. It runs about 16:00. It was first  performed by Lucy Shelton at the
Y in NYC, 17 May 1986. I don't think it has been  recorded. 
</P>
<P>Now. Mystery lines. 
</P>
<P>&quot;going deep south&quot;. The NME(?) review someone posted this morning
gave this  line as &quot;going deep sex&quot;. I think this is odd, and
unlikely. &quot;deep south&quot; and &quot;deep six&quot; are both expressions. &quot;deep
sex&quot; sounds a little direct for line two of a song ! Can we  try to get an
authoritative reading on this one? 
</P>
<P>&quot;he's up off his head&quot;. Could this possibly be &quot;Howth Head&quot;?
That is the physical  location of the episode in Ulysses, a headland north of
Dublin. (see eg 643 line 13) 
</P>
<P>&quot;down on the peach&quot;. Molly uses the word &quot;peach&quot; once,
in the phrase &quot;soft like a  peach&quot; in reference to female sexual
organs (Vintage page 770). Earlier in the day  she has been presented with a
gift of peaches and pears. Can't find a reference to  &quot;down&quot; on
peaches. 
</P>
<P>&quot;?Coralean? girl&quot;. Could it possibly be &quot;Coriolanus&quot; or &quot;Cordelia&quot;?
Both are  mentioned in Ulysses, but beyond that I have no suggestions. 
</P>
<P>&quot;?o'er ernos? body&quot; ??? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; seems to be original to Kate. The word &quot;sensual&quot;
somewhat  surprisingly does not occur in Ulysses, and so a fortiori neither does
&quot;sensual world&quot;.  Does IED have any further reference to Rupert
Croft-Cooke's work The Sensual  World ? I can't find it in the Dartmouth library
either. I have written down a date  of 1903--if that is the date of the work, it
is a natural for earning a reference in  Ulysses which is set in 1904. I rather
think that is Croft-Cooke's birthdate though. 
</P>
<P>Damn I want to hear this song now!

IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Ulysses and The Sensual World

</P>
<P>First, a sincere and warm thankyou to Julian West for the extremely cogent 
information he gave about the connections between Ulysses and The Sensual World.
 IED, who owns the Penguin edition, had searched in vain for &quot;Chapter 11&quot;
yesterday  (the original chapter headings are not included in that edition, it
turns out), so could  find only the relevant soliloquy at the very end. The
specific page references you  gave, therefore, Julian, are most opportune and
much appreciated. 
</P>
<P>It occurs to IED that Kate might be drawing partially, or even possibly in
toto,  from the recent film James Joyce's Women, which starred Fionula Flanagan
as  Molly Bloom, and which included a long soliloquy based on but also of course
much  different from the original in Ulysses. This would be worth checking into.

</P>
<P>&gt; Now. Mystery lines. 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;Going deep south&quot;. The NME(?) review someone posted this
morning gave this  line as &quot;going deep sex&quot;. I think this is odd, and
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>As much as he'd like to, IED cannot oblige. This is one of several lines in
the  song which IED simply cannot hear clearly enough to make sense of. We'll
just have  to wait till the album comes out with the lyric sheet. 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;he's up off his head&quot;. Could this possibly be &quot;Howth
Head&quot;? That is the  physical location of the episode in Ulysses, a headland
north of Dublin. (see eg 643  line 13) 
</P>
<P>Yes! Yes! Yes! That's what she's saying! Great work! 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;down on the peach&quot;. Molly uses the word &quot;peach&quot;
once, in the phrase soft like  a peach&quot; in reference to female sexual
organs (Vintage page 770). Earlier in the day  she has been presented with a
gift of peaches and pears. Can't find a reference to  &quot;down&quot; on
peaches. 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless it makes perfect sense in this context. You must have hit on
the  correct reference (p. 770). 
</P>
<P>&gt; &quot;?Coralean? girl&quot;. Could it possibly be &quot;Coriolanus&quot;
or &quot;Cordelia&quot;? Both are  mentioned in Ulysses, but beyond that I have
no suggestions. 
</P>
<P>As Greg O'Rear noted already, Kate is saying &quot;Like a Machiavellian girl&quot;
here.  Thanks, Greg.

 instead of 'Andalusian' (like Joyce wrote it) in TSW (the song)? Seems to me
out  of place somehow, unless of course she is refering to the manipulative way
the Molly  plays with her suitor's mind...

<P>&gt; Alright you anaylsts of things Kate: why did she use the word
'Machevellian'  instead of 'Andalusian' (like Joyce wrote it) in TSW (the song)?
Seems to me out  of place somehow, unless of course she is refering to the

</P>
<P>Okay, good question! I was a bit puzzled by this word `Machiavellian' since
it is  absent not only from the &quot;Penelope&quot; chapter but from the whole
of Ulysses ! Your  observation that `those Andalusian girls' [ Ulysses ] fits
the rhythm of `a  Machiavellian girl' [ TSW ] is an excellent one. Since Kate is
on record as having  said that she couldn't get the rights to use the text from
Ulysses (although she  obviously alludes to it freely), perhaps this is an
example of a line which was  changed from an earlier, complete version of the
song. If we could get some more  evidence to bear out this hypothesis, it would
shed considerable insight into the  textual composition of TSW . 
</P>
<P>Similar examples anyone? 
</P>
<P>Julian 
</P>
<P>ps. `Andalusian' appears because Molly is remembering incidents from her 
girlhood when she was an `army brat' in Gibraltar. Characteristically, these 
memories blur with those of her courtship with Leopold Bloom on Howth Head.

Subject: Words in The World 
</P>
<P> Just what everyone wanted: more Joycean pedantry about TSW ! 
</P>
<P>Ed Suranyi (?) yesterday made the keen observation that Kate has made the 
appropriate decision of focussing on Molly's ultimate &quot;yes&quot;. More on
that, and on two  other words that may have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P> &quot;yes&quot; represents Molly's great apotheosis at the end of the
chapter, as readers of  Jon Drukman's transcription will have noticed. It is
both the first word of the  chapter [&quot;Yes because he never did a thing like
that before...&quot;] and the last [&quot;...and  yes I said yes I will Yes.&quot;]

</P>
<P>Consequently, it is the last word of the entire book. It probably represents
her  last thought before falling asleep in the early morning hours of June 17. 
</P>
<P>&quot;yes&quot; has a relative frequency of .00375 in &quot;Penelope&quot;
as opposed to .00135 in  Ulysses as a whole. Looked at another way, its 84
occurences in Molly's monologue  represent over 23% of its appearances in the
book. The monologue contains only 8.5%  of the words in Ulysses [my estimate].
The word &quot;yes&quot; is thus clearly linked to Molly. 
</P>
<P> &quot;mmmmm&quot; is the flip side of &quot;yes&quot;. Molly's first word
spoken in Ulysses , and  likely her first thought of the day on June 16, 1904,
is &quot;Mn&quot;. Although it does not  recur (there is a &quot;mm&quot;, but
in her husband Leopold Bloom's thoughts) this word is  strongly associated to
Molly. In its two letters it embodies the ambiguity of yes/no.  Her husband
instantly translates it for us as &quot;No&quot;, but clearly this translation
is  necessary! Molly, in her embodiment of the female principle, transcends
male,  boolean logic. 
</P>
<P>I'll transcribe the exchange: 
</P>
<P>-- You don't want anything for breakfast? 
</P>
<P>A sleepy soft grunt answered: 
</P>
<P>-- Mn. 
</P>
<P>No. She didn't want anything. ... 
</P>
<P>  [chapter 4, middle of second page;    page 46 in Penguin ed.] 
</P>
<P> The third word, easiest to overlook is &quot;he&quot;. &quot;He&quot; is
also overrepresented in  &quot;Penelope&quot;, with a relative frequency of
.0193 as opposed to .0153 in the book as a  whole. Its 433 occurences in &quot;Penelope&quot;
represent 10.7% of its total number of  appearances. 
</P>
<P>But this relatively small difference in frequency drastically underestimates
the  importance of &quot;he&quot; in Penelope. The pronoun appears universally
without  antecedents . Molly frequently uses &quot;he&quot; to refer to
completely different men within  a line or two of one another. Even in her
remembrances of her marriage proposal,  she is filtering in thoughts of an
adulterous liaison earlier in the day, of her first  sexual experiences in
Gibraltar, of a young student whom her husband has just  rescued from adversity,
etc. Considerable familiarity with the text of Ulysses is  required to
differentiate between these elliptical antecedents. 
</P>
<P>&quot;He&quot; appears 4 times in TSW , &quot;his&quot; twice and &quot;him&quot;
once. [My counts, made of course without Kate's transcription of the lyrics.] 
</P>
<P> Conclusion: in focussing on these three easily overlooked words &quot;Yes&quot;
&quot;mn&quot; and  &quot;he&quot;, Kate betrays considerable sophistication in
her handling of the literary source  material. Any surprises?

</P>
<P>&gt;Give me a fucking break. You can't be serious. This is nonsense, no
matter what  the &quot;relative freqency&quot; of &quot;mn&quot; is in Ulysses.
Please go look up &quot;Occam's Razor&quot; in a philosophy book before you go
spouting this bull again. 
</P>
<P>-- Brian 
</P>
<P> Since Brian's foolish, anti-intellectual complaint appeared he (and Julian)
will  have had a chance to read the NME interview which IED posted the other
day. In it  Kate confirms several of Julian's suppositions about her approach to
the Joyce text:  that her source was indeed the text itself (not, as IED had
suggested might be  possible, the film James Joyce's Women ); that her study of
the passage had  obviously been quite extensive (as well as rooted to an initial
experience years in her  past (what better way to be introduced to the Molly
Bloom passage than through a  live reading by Siobhan McKenna, a firstrate
Shakespearean actress?); and, most  importantly, that she had indeed taken very
careful notice of the use of &quot;Yes&quot; in the  original passage. 
</P>
<P>In fact, her decision to use the Joyce text as the subject of her song
stemmed  from her immediate recollection that this word had been a crucial motif
of the Molly  Bloom passage. She also observed both the distinction and the
similarity between her  &quot;Mmh, yes&quot; and the &quot;Yes&quot; in that
soliloquy. 
</P>
<P>IED, for one, never had the slightest doubt but that Julian was correct
about this.  And if he was correct in this respect, why not in all his other,
related suggestions  regarding the text and Kate's adaptation of it? 
</P>
<P>And lest some of you should still doubt that Kate would take that kind of
trouble  with her literary material, remember that she shares her work with her
family,  including her brother John Carder Bush, long before it is released. And
JCB does  most definitely heed the significance of the written word in this way.
He is also very  familiar with Joyce's work. 
</P>
<P>IED thinks it's a little unfair to those many Love-Hounds who haven't had a 
chance to hear it themselves. Speaking for himself, anyway, IED has always found
it  very hard to shrug off other people's judgements about the nature and
quality of  new music when he gets the judgements before he has heard the music.

</P>
<P>He will say this, however: The Sensual World is a great work of art. He
doesn't  see why so many people come to a new Kate Bush album with a
measuring-stick,  comparing it to see how much like The Dreaming or Hounds of
Love it is. It's  different! What would have been the point of making an album
like The Dreaming  again? She already made The Dreaming ! 
</P>
<P>IED has been a Kate Bush aKolyTe long enough to know that it is absurd to 
criticize her new music--let alone to try &quot;ranking&quot; it in relation to
her earlier  albums--before having really lived with it for a while--or even
then. Also, IED's  copy of the album is of amazingly poor audio quality. (The
normal cassette version of  the album which IED obtained the other day--from
which he copied the liner notes  for Love-Hounds recently--is loaded with tiny
but very noticeable dropouts,  excessive tape hiss, a slightly faster than 33
1/3 running speed and a terribly sharp  drop-off of the higher frequencies. IED
strongly advises Love-Hounds to hold out for  the UK vinyl or the CD.) He
therefore hasn't been listening to it much yet. 
</P>
<P>Hell, IED's been listening to the 1976 demos practically every day for three
 months or more now, and he still doesn't really have anything concrete to say
about  them--only that they are an unassailable, incontrovertible proof that God
is living  among us.

Subject: A banner day for Kate scholarship 
</P>
<P>Congratulations to Jorn Barger! 
</P>
<P>Jorn has done a damned sensible thing in tracking the &quot;original&quot;
lyrics to the  World. I had conjectured in love-hounds a week or two ago that
this would be  possible but I hadn't gotten around to trying yet ! How lazy can
I get? I've even  been wasting time on my thesis... 
</P>
<P>What tipped me off (this was back in the days before we were sure about the 
difficulties with Joyce's estate) was the unusual word &quot;Machiavellian&quot;
which is not  Joycean at all but happens to fit the cadence of &quot;Andalusian&quot;.
I figured that similar  substitutions had been made throughout, starting with
the first line, which I had  myself been able to match. I had no idea that the
complete solution would be so  simple though! Only two fragments! 
</P>
<P>Incidentally, everything that Jorn says about the custodians of Joyce's
estate is  strongly stated, but true. It is frustrating! Are you something of a
Joycean scholar,  Jorn? 
</P>
<P>Only one thing that Jorn says is (partially) false, however: that &quot;we
can only hear  [this song] in our minds' ear&quot;. True that we can only hear
Kate singing it in our  minds (and how sweet it is! try it!) But we can
certainly hear someone else singing  it. All I need is a good soprano, a
recording studio, and a copy of the double-tracked  single (the one with no
lyrics, remember). I'll get on it this weekend. 
</P>
<P>Is it worth doing this? Depends on whether you are interested in Kate
primarily  as a singer or a composer. Is it legal ? Probably depends on how
widely it circulates;  I don't know.

<P>Date: Tue, 31 Oct 89 17:44 PST <BR> From:
IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu <BR> Subject: Dutchman's allegations of
Kate Bush &quot;fraud&quot; 
</P>
<P>A recent Love-Hounds posting (IED is greatly indebted to the transcriber, to
 Vickie Mapes--via Larry Hernandez--for calling IED's attention to it, and to 
Michael Butler for reading it over the phone to him), taken from an article
printed  in the Dutch music journal Ur (#21, October 21, 1989), has moved IED to
do a little  research on his own, and he has a few observations to make now. 
</P>
<P>First, what exactly happened between Mr. Libbenga and Kate? Mr. Libbenga 
more or less admits that he never actually had any personal contact with Kate.
In  fact, it seems that whatever telephonic communication he had with her was
too  &quot;thin&quot; to fill even the brief kind of interview-article now
considered adequate  among contemporary-music publications. Nevertheless, we are
told, Mr. Libbenga  &quot;sent Kate&quot; a tape of folk music. It is not clear
to what address this tape was sent,  but there can be no doubt that Kate and her
brothers are recipients of a vast  number of such tapes each year, and we cannot
assume that Kate ever heard Mr.  Libbenga's tape, nor that, if she did hear it,
she was aware from whom the tape had  come. Paddy Bush, we know, has an enormous
collection of tape-recordings of ethnic  music, and presumably Kate's exposure
to these and other collections is casual, even  chaotic, at times. 
</P>
<P>We also have the information that Kate called Mr. Libbenga &quot;collect&quot;.
And why  not? Mr. Libbenga had asked for an interview with Kate Bush,
and--almost certainly  because he had associated himself with a Dutch music
journal--he was granted one.  Perhaps his evident pique at being asked to pay
for the cost of the interview was a  partial cause of the succeeding interview's
suspicious &quot;thinness&quot;? We cannot know. 
</P>
<P>What of the question of &quot;fraud&quot;, then? There can be no question
that the  recording heard on Kate's album is completely different from the
recording named  by Mr. Libbenga. The choice of Uillean pipes, Greek bouzouki
and Irish fiddle as the  instrumentation of the &quot;air&quot; in question is
surely original--particularly if, as Mr.  Libbenga claims, the melody is
Macedonian. (Macedonia is a part of what is now  Yugoslavia.) 
</P>
<P>Whatever similarity does exist between Mr. Libbenga's Dutch tape and Kate's 
The Sensual World must, therefore, be strictly limited to the melody itself. It
would  be unwise to take any stranger's word for it that one melody is &quot;the
same&quot; as  another without hearing the two recordings oneself; in this case
it would be triply  unwise, for we know already that Mr. Libbenga apparently had
some reason for  harboring a grudge against Kate (for calling &quot;collect&quot;,
and for failing to oblige him  with a &quot;thick&quot; enough interview to
further his career), and we also know that Mr.  Libbenga has described his
original tape recording as sounding much like The  Beatles' recording of Mother
Nature's Son --a comparison which, in IED's opinion,  puts in the gravest doubt
Mr. Libbenga's claims about the likeness of his tape to  Kate's recording! 
</P>
<P>Two other points are in order. First, it will be remembered that the author
of the  interview with Kate which was published recently in New Musical Express
twice  referred to Kate's instrumental material from The Sensual World as a &quot;Macedonian
 air&quot;. We need not be in any doubt that this knowledge was not the author's
own, but  was transmitted to him by Kate Bush herself. (There is little
likelihood that a staff  writer for New Musical Express could distinguish a
Macedonian air from a plate of  peas.) Therefore, assuming that the origin of
the melodic material is Macedonian,  Kate has already proven herself perfectly
forthcoming on the issue. 
</P>
<P>The second point is that, however Kate became acquainted with the melody,
its  folk origins place it squarely in the public domain, and therefore any
question of  &quot;fraud&quot; is moot. 
</P>
<P>Despite this fact, it is significant that Kate has always been perfectly
willing to  identify elements of her music which are borrowed from traditional
sources. In fact,  Kate was openly apologetic when, through a label typo by EMI,
credit for the  composition of The Handsome Cabin Boy was given to her (the song
is traditional).  Similarly when My Lagan Love was released Kate was very
explicit about the  traditional origin of the music vs. the John Carder
Bush-originated lyrics she used  for the song. And again when describing the use
of a traditional melody in Hello  Earth Kate was admirably forthright in
ascribing its origins to the soundtrack of  Werner Herzog's film Nosferatu. (She
also thanked Herzog and the film's  soundtrack supervisor Florian Fricke in the
liner notes of Hounds of Love .) And  still another time, Kate went out of her
way to identify a rhythm she used in Jig of  Life as coming from Greek folk
sources. 
</P>
<P>Given this proven honesty on Kate's part in the past, IED can see no reason
for  doubting her when she claims that her recording, The Sensual World, is
substantially  her own work. IED thinks the most likely explanation is that a
minimum of melodic  material was adapted--with at least some changes and
probably considerable  variation and development--by Kate from traditional
Macedonian sources, possibly  but by no means certainly through exposure to Mr.
Libbenga's homemade  compilation of public-domain traditional music; and that,
following its novel and  radical re-instrumentation and arrangement by Kate with
the aid of Irish musicians,  she rightly felt that such a natural absorption of
folk elements in her work did not  jeopardize her status as creator of the final
recording. And despite this, she has  apparently been quite willing to identify
the Macedonian roots of a (no doubt small)  part of her recording's elaborate
counter-melody. 
</P>
<P>All in all, IED can find no justification for Mr. Libbenga's quibble with
Kate;  indeed, IED sees far more evidence to doubt both the legitimacy of Mr.
Libbenga's  musical expertise and the honorability of his motivation for making
these dubious  accusations.

<P>From: leo@duttnph.tudelft.nl (Leo Breebaart) <BR> Subject: Kate Bush vs.
the Dutch Magazine 'Oor' [long] <BR> Date: 19 Dec 89 08:43:11 GMT 
</P>
<P>A month or so ago, I posted a translation of an article in a Dutch music
magazine,  in which Kate Bush was accused of falsely taking writing credit for
the song 'The  Sensual World', and ... oh heck, I'll repeat the translation
further on in this posting.  I didn't get much response from the Love-Hounds,
except - of course - for IED, or  rather Andrew Maverick, who (at my suggestion)
composed a letter, which I  subsequently send to the editors of the magazine. I
had already forgotten about it  when a few days ago I got a reply from the
journalist who wrote the original article. 
</P>
<P>Just for completeness' sake, I thought it might be interesting to let this
group  know the final outcome of this matter. I will now give, in order, my
translation of  the original article, IED's letter, and the translation of the
reply from the original  author (which is addressed to me, because I put a brief
explaining note along with  IED's English letter). All translation errors are,
of course, mine: 
</P>
<P>* JAN LIBBENGA's ORIGINAL ARTICLE IN MUSIC MAGAZINE 'OOR' * 
</P>
<P>BUSH FRAUD ? [In Dutch: 'Bush Bedrog?', a nice alliteration] 
</P>
<P>'The Sensual World' is the name of the new single by Kate Bush. Although, 
'new'? I have known the melody which her accompanist Davy Spillane plays in this
 song on bagpipes for years. 
</P>
<P>In the fall of 1985 I was going to interview Kate Bush in England. Because
she  then already had shown her love for (Irish) folk music, I had brought a
cassette of  my folk favourites. The interview first was cancelled, but after a
few days La Bush  called me after all at home (collect). The interview was never
published (too thin),  but I did send her the tape afterwards. On that tape was
the from Yugoslavian  Macedonia originating 'Antice, dzanam, Dusice', performed
by the Haagse [i.e.  from The Hague] ensemble Calgija, conducted by
etnomusicologist Wouter Swets.  Originally a song about a poor girl who had to
take care of her younger sister, and  therefore couldn't get a husband; in
Swets' (instrumental) version almost as  beautiful as 'Mother Nature's Song' by
the Beatles. According to the booklet of the  LP and CD 'The Sensual World' the
title song was written by La Bush herself: not  true. Was this traditional
melody suggested to her by the Trio Bulgarka, guests on  the album, or did my
cassette reach her home address in Kent, after all? 
</P>
<P>* IED'S REPLY TO THE MAGAZINE * 
</P>
<P>In regard to Mr. Libbenga's accusation that the English recording artist
Kate  Bush was deceitful in failing to identify the traditional source of a part
of her recent  record, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;: I would like to make
several important points. 
</P>
<P>First, Mr. Libbenga seems to have been primarily upset because he had not 
received any personal credit on Ms. Bush's album, even though he himself 
apparently did nothing more than make her aware of a piece of traditional 
Macedonian folk music. 
</P>
<P>Second, Ms. Bush has in fact been more than forthcoming about the
traditional  elements in the record--in a recent interview in England's music
journal &quot;New  Musical Express&quot; she expressly identifies the record's
counter-melody as a  Macedonian folk tune. 
</P>
<P>Third, Ms. Bush's use of this folk music (which is, of course, entirely in
the  public domain) occupies a minimal role in the overall effect of her
recording: only  the most basic melodic cell is retained from the Macedonian
source, and this is  confined to an instrumental countermelody which never
assumes dominance  over--and in fact is drastically altered to accomodate--Ms.
Bush's original vocal  melody-line. And as if these substantive changes to the
music were not themselves  enough to explain the crediting of the recording to
Ms. Bush, she re-arranged the  Yugoslavian motif for a unique combination of
Irish, Greek and electronic  instruments. 
</P>
<P>Finally, I would like to point out that, in an article written by Ms. Bush's
brother  Paddy and published (before Mr. Libbenga's sour-toned, petty article
ever went to  press) in the most recent issue of the &quot;Kate Bush Club
Newsletter&quot;, a special appeal  was made to the &quot;Dutch person&quot; who
had sent Ms. Bush the tape of the original  Macedonian melody to let them know
his identity, so that they could give him credit  for the service he did them.
It seems that Mr. Libbenga never properly identified  himself to the Bush family
in the first place! 
</P>
<P>Taking these facts into account--and considering that Ms. Bush has always
been  scrupulously honest and generous in crediting any and all musicians and
sources for  their help in creating her own indisputibly original and masterful
music--I think Mr.  Libbenga ought to be ashamed of himself for having accused
this supremely  honourable British musician of deceit. He owes Ms. Bush an
apology. 
</P>
<P>-- Andrew Marvick 
</P>
<P>* JAN LIBBENGA'S LETTER TO ME * 
</P>
<P>Dear Leo, 
</P>
<P>Thanks for sending the reactions of Andrew Maverick from Los Angeles. I
should  answer his letter personally, but I get the impression that he has never
read the  article in question himself and that you must have translated it (I am
assuming that  you are corresponding Bush-fans). 
</P>
<P>My article got somewhat of a wry after-taste because an editor put &quot;Fraud?&quot;
 above it, much against my wishes (I only saw it after the issue had been
printed).  Read the article without that heading and it gets a lot more
friendly. 
</P>
<P>Strictly speaking it should have been mentioned on the album that the melody
 originated with the group Calgija. The melody in question is *not* in the
'public  domain' as your acquaintance suggests, but is an instrumental
interpretation of a  vocal (!) piece by Wouter Swets from The Hague. Copyright
exists just as much for  arrangements of folk music. The arrangement has been
used un-altered (I only  noticed this later). This is not necessarily
'negligence' on the part of Kate Bush; the  responsibility belongs in the first
place with her record company EMI. 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, I now know about the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, and there has 
been contact with the management. Accompanying my cassette was a letter (send
via  EMI, as requested by Kate Bush) and they lost it. That I did not receive
'credit' on  the record is not important, if you had read (and translated) my
article well, you  would have seen that I leave it open from whom she got the
melody. It was not out  of spite, but out of pure astonishment that I wrote the
article. In short: I was  pleasantly surprised, and play 'The Sensual World'
with joy. 
</P>
<P>Greetings, 
</P>
<P>Jan Libbenga 
</P>
<P>* SOME FINAL COMMENTS OF MY OWN * 
</P>
<P>- I think this is a *very* reasonable letter. What he says makes perfectly
good  sense to me, and does not ring false. In fact, it was a nice surprise to
actually receive  a reply from 'the man himself', because I was expecting
nothing more than a form  letter. 
</P>
<P>- He only allows himself one sly dig at the end: &quot;If you had read (and
translated)  the article well...&quot;. I can say nothing else than that he is
right, and very smart as  well: IED indeed did *not* see the original
translation. At first he had written a  longer and much more vicious letter,
purely based on a verbal account someone gave  him of the article (we all know
how IED gets when Kate is done an injustice!). I  pointed out some mistakes to
him, and he rewrote the letter accordingly. However,  the part about Jan
Libbenga wanting credit for himself was indeed still wrong, and  it is my
mistake that I did not 1) tell IED this, and let him rewrite again; or 2) send 
him a transcript of the original article, so that he wouldn't have made the
mistake in  the first place. This was completely my responsibility, and Jan
Libbenga correctly  does not fault IED for this. 
</P>
<P>- Afterthought. At first I thought it would be nice to return the courtesy
to Jan,  and write him a personal letter as well, explaining the context in
which all of this  has taken place (i.e. Usenet &amp; rec.music.gaffa). On
second thought, seeing as how the  discussion is actually about the unauthorized
use of copyrighted material, I think it  might be wiser not to tell him that I
translated his article, without any kind of  permission whatsoever, and
distributed it for hundreds if not thousands of people to  see... :-) 
</P>
<P>Once again going back into passive Gaffa Watching Mode, 
</P>

PST <BR> Subject: The Sensual World Anotated Lyrics 
</P>
<P>--- THE SENSUAL WORLD ANNOTATED LYRICS ---
</P>
<P> by Ron Hill, Andrew Marvick (IED), Julian West, Jorn Barger, WOJ, and 
Edward Suranyi. 
</P>
<P>Compiled and edited by Ron Hill. 
</P>
<P>Last Update: October 27, 1992 
</P>
<P>12&quot; AND CD-SINGLE RELEASE 
</P>
<P>The a-side of the single and 12&quot; is simply the album cut of TSW : just
under 4  minutes. The b-side has the instrumental version (exactly the same as
the a-side but  without the lead vocal); and Walk Straight Down the Middle. The
cover of both is  the same: a black-and-white photograph (printed in John Carder
Bush's lush  purplish-brownish-black &quot;duo-tone&quot; colour) of Kate on the
front, with the title, in  spindly sans-serif type along the right side, reading
from top to bottom: THE  SENSUAL WORLD KATE BUSH. The back side is in plain
black with all writing in  gold letters. The production credits are interesting:
all tracks were produced by Kate  Bush. But TSW was &quot;recorded by&quot; Del
Palmer; while WSDTM was &quot;engineered&quot; by  Del Palmer. A rather
mysterious distinction, no? 
</P>
<P>The labels of the 12&quot; are standard EMI black, but the CD-single has a
special  black label-side with the TSW -style gold lettering on it--extremely
cool-looking! 
</P>
<P>The photograph itself is gorgeous. It's just a very simple, straightforward 
half-length portrait shot of Kate in a black, sleeveless dance leotard top, hair
loose  and copious. She faces the camera nearly head-on, but is looking off
slightly to the  right. Her arms are held out in front of her, loosely clasped
together at the wrist.  Behind her is an unseen back-light, and there is a kind
of mist in the blackness  beyond. 
</P>
<P>A very similar shot was printed in NME's news announcement last issue. In
that  photo, from the same session, everything is more or less the same except
that Kate is  looking directly into the camera, and in her right hand is--a
peach. 
</P>
<P>In the photograph on the cover of the new single the peach has become--dust,
 slipping through her fingers. (&quot;Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.&quot;)
Typically exKuisiTe,  purely Katian implication and sug-gestion, rather than
direct statement: for if one  had not seen the NME photo, one would not know The
Whole Story behind the  image.

</P>
<P>COMMENTS FROM FAN 
</P>
<P>This record has got to be the most inaccessible piece of songwriting Kate
has  ever done--yet it's also one of her most immediately memorable and
accessible  records she's ever done. There's never been anything like The
Sensual World. 
</P>
<P>IED has never had so much difficulty hearing the words Kate is singing than
he  has in this case. It's as though Kate had been inspired to create one of the
most  infectious, stylistically eclectic pop records, yet had decided to record
the vocal so  only she could really hear it ! It's like she made this record
literally for herself!  It's...oh, words just fail IED--he's &quot;stepping out
off the page, into the sensual  world&quot;! 
</P>
<P>QUOTE FROM KATE 
</P>
<P>The following is a fairly typical quote from Kate on the song. Other quotes
can be  found in the electronic book Cloudbusting. 
</P>
<P>KATE: Well I think &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is talking specifically
about the context  of that within the song. The song is about someone from a
book who steps out from  this very black and white 2-D world into the real
world. The immediate impressions  was the sensuality of this world - the fact
that you can touch things, that is so  sensual - you know... the colours of
trees, the feel of the grass on the feet, the touch  of this in the hand - the
fact that it is such a sensual world. I think for me that's an  incredibly
important thing about this planet, that we are surrounded by such  sensuality
and yet we tend not to see it like that. But I'm sure for someone who had  never
experienced it before it would be quite a devastating thing. 
</P>
<P>Those church bells on the front - that's a sensual sound to me. 
</P>
<P>I love the sound of church bells. I think they are extraordinary - such a
sound of  celebration. The bells were put there because originally the lyrics of
the song were  taken from the book Ulysses by James Joyce, the words at the end
of the book by  Molly Bloom, but we couldn't get permission to use the words. I
tried for a long  time - probably about a year - and they wouldn't let me use
them, so I had to  create something that sounded like those original word, had
the same rhythm, the  same kind of feel but obviously not being able to use
them. It all kind of turned in to  a pastiche of it and that's why the book
character, Molly Bloom, then steps out into  the real world and becomes one of
us. (1989, Roger Scott) 
</P>
<P>LYRICS 
</P>
<P>As we know from the quotes from Kate, she originally recorded the song using
 lyrics from Jame's Joyce's Ulysses, and then had to re-record it when she
couldn't  get permission to use Joyce's words. Fortunately, the original lyrics
can be identified  with pretty much 100% certainty: they're all from the last
page and a half (Vintage  edition p. 782-3/Penguin p. 642-4) and fall into two
verbatim chunks that match  precisely for rhythm, vowel sounds, and 'yes'es. 
</P>
<P>The chapter that the lyrics comes from (usually called &quot;Penelope&quot;
or &quot;Molly  Bloom's monologue) is about 40 pages long, with no punctuation
at all and only 8  paragraph breaks! (Note that the &quot;original&quot; chapter
headings are not included in any  edition. Joyce edited them out of the final
galleys. This is probably the single most  obfuscatory deliberate act of his
entire life. They are so useful, however, that every  Joyce critic makes free
reference to them.) 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately we can only hear the original lryics in our minds' ear: I
almost  suspect that those multiple instrumental tracks on the EP were Kate's
way of saying  listen-thru-the-code... Of course, this wouldn't stop anyone from
re-recording the  song by singing the original lryics over Kate's instrumental
version! 
</P>
<P>Kate's problems in obtaining permission are not unique. The Joyce estate has
 been outraging scholars for several years now-- Joyce's only living heir, his 
grandson Stephen, feels that despite the desires of scholars, his family still
retains  the right of privacy, and that's his right, surely. He has burnt
letters, objected to the  public sale of a deathmask of his grandfather,
objected to the commercialization of  the museum in the Joyce tower in
sandycove...But what a loss that this song got  caught in the crossfire... 
</P>
<P>In, the following analysis, Kate's lryics are given in UPPER CASE and
Joyce's  are given in normal (for the book!) case. When Kate has used words are
in other  sections of the book, the page numbers are given. Hopefully the read
will get a feel  for the style and some of the mood of the chapter from this
extract. It requires  considerably more effort to appreciate the background and
motivations. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World (restored) 
</P>
<P>(The song starts with the sound of church bells) 
</P>
<P>KATE: I've got a thing about the sound of bells. It's one of those fantastic
sounds:  sound of celebration. The're used to mark points in life - births,
weddings, deaths -  but they give this tremendous feeling of celebration. 
</P>
<P>In the original speech she's talking of the time when he proposed to her,
and I  just had the image of bells, this image of them sitting on the hillside
with the sound  of bells in the distance. In hindsight, I also think it's a
lovely way to start an album: a  feeling of celebration that puts me on a
hillside somewhere on a sunny afternoon and  it's like, mmh... Sounds of
celebration get fewer and fewer. We haven't many left.  And yet people complain
of the sound of bells in cities. (1989, NME) 
</P>
<P>MMMH, YES 
</P>
<P>KATE: In the original piece, it's just &quot;Yes&quot; - a very interesting
way of leading you  in. It pulls you into the piece by the continual acceptance
of all these sensual things:  &quot;Ooh wonderful!&quot; (1989, NME) 
</P>
<P>- FIRST SECTION - 
</P>
<P>THEN I'D TAKEN THE KISS OF SEEDCAKE BACK FROM HIS MOUTH <BR> ...first I
gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth 
</P>
<P>It's interesting how Kate reverses this. 
</P>
<P>The clearest description of the seedcake episode is in chapter 8, the 
Lestrygonians. 
</P>
<P>GOING DEEP SOUTH, GO DOWN, MMH, YES. <BR> and it was leapyear like now yes 
</P>
<P>TOOK SIX BIG WHEELS AND ROLLED OUR BODIES  16 years ago my God 
</P>
<P>&quot;big wheels&quot; is from page 643 line 31. 
</P>
<P>OFF OF HOWTH HEAD AND INTO THE FLESH, MMH, YES,  after that long kiss I near
lost my breath yes 
</P>
<P>&quot;Howth Head&quot; is the physical location of the episode in Ulysses, a
headland north  of Dublin. (see eg 643 line 13) 
</P>
<P>HE SAID I WAS A FLOWER OF THE MOUNTAIN, YES, <BR> he said I was a flower of
the mountain yes 
</P>
<P>&quot;flower of the mountain&quot; also appears on page 644 line 2 
</P>
<P>BUT NOW I'VE POWERS O'ER A WOMAN'S BODY-- YES.<BR>  so we are flowers all a
womans body yes [sic: thus in joyce]... 
</P>
<P>- SECOND SECTION - 
</P>
<P>TO WHERE THE WATER AND THE EARTH CARESS <BR> ...and Gibraltar as a girl
where I 
</P>
<P>The physical setting of the episode is on a hill to the north of Dublin,
overlooking  the sea, hence possibly &quot;where the water and the earth caress&quot;

</P>
<P>AND THE DOWN OF A PEACH SAYS MMH, YES,<BR>  was a flower of the mountain
yes 
</P>
<P>&quot;Down on the peach&quot;. Molly uses the word &quot;peach&quot; once,
in the phrase &quot;soft like  a peach&quot; in reference to female sexual
organs (Vintage page 770). Earlier in the day  she has been presented with a
gift of peaches and pears. Can't find a reference to  &quot;down&quot; on
peaches. 
</P>
<P>It's possible Kate might be using &quot;peach&quot; independently as a
sexual metaphor  (it's a well established metaphor). Molly's &quot;peach&quot;
reference is over 10 pages from  the end of the book, where the bulk of Kate's
source material lies. 
</P>
<P>One of the publicity photos shows Kate holding a peach. 
</P>
<P>DO I LOOK FOR THOSE MILLIONAIRES <BR> when I put the rose in my hair 
</P>
<P>LIKE A MACHIAVELLIAN GIRL WOULD <BR> like the Andalusian girls used 
</P>
<P>`Andalusian' appears because Molly is remembering incidents from her
girlhood  when she was an `army brat' in Gibraltar. Characteristically, these
memories blur  with those of her courtship with Leopold Bloom on Howth Head. 
</P>
<P>The word `Machiavellian' since is absent not only from the &quot;Penelope&quot;
chapter  but from the whole of Ulysses ! 
</P>
<P>Why did she use the word 'Machevellian' instead of 'Andalusian'? Seems to me
 out of place somehow, unless of course she is refering to the manipulative way
the  Molly plays with her suitor's mind... 
</P>
<P>WHEN I COULD WEAR A SUNSET? MMH, YES, <BR> or shall I wear a red yes 
</P>
<P>&quot;sunsets&quot; appears on page 643 line 39. 
</P>
<P>AND HOW WE WISHED TO LIVE IN THE SENSUAL WORLD <BR> and how he kissed me
under the Moorish wall 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; seems to be original to Kate. The word &quot;sensual&quot;
somewhat  surprisingly does not occur in Ulysses, and so a fortiori neither does
&quot;sensual world&quot; 
</P>
<P>YOU DON'T NEED WORDS-- JUST ONE KISS, THEN ANOTHER.<BR>  and I thought well
as well him as another 
</P>
<P>AND THEN THE ARROWS OF DESIRE REWRITE THE SPEECH, MMH, YES <BR> and then I
asked him with my eyes to ask again yes 
</P>
<P>AND THEN HE WHISPERED WOULD I, MMH, YES <BR> and then he asked me would I
yes 
</P>
<P>BE SAFE, MMH, YES, FROM MOUNTAIN FLOWERS? <BR> to say yes my mountain
flower 
</P>
<P>AND AT FIRST WITH THE CHARM AROUND HIM, MMH, YES <BR> and first I put my
arms around him yes 
</P>
<P>AND LOOSENED IT SO IF <BR> and drew him down to me 
</P>
<P>IT SLIPPED BETWEEN MY BREASTS  so he could feel my breasts 
</P>
<P>HE'D RESCUE IT, MMH, YES, <BR> all perfume yes 
</P>
<P>AND HIS SPARK TOOK LIFE IN MY HAND AND, MMH, YES <BR> and his heart was
going like mad and yes 
</P>
<P>I SAID, MMH, YES <BR> I said yes 
</P>
<P>BUT NOT YET, MMH, YES <BR> I will Yes 
</P>
<P>MMH, YES 
</P>
<P>COMPLETE LAST FEW PAGES. 
</P>
<P>. .I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of
heaven  theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves
rushing  then the beautiful country with fields of oats and wheat and all kinds
of things and  all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to
see rivers and lakes  and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours
springing up even out of the  ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for
them saying theres no God I wouldnt  give a snap of my two fingers for all their
learning why dont they go and create  something I often asked him atheists or
what- ever they call themselves go and wash  the cobbles off themselves first
then they go howling for the priest and they dying  and why why because theyre
afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes  I know them well who
was the first person in the universe before there was  anybody that made it all
who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are  they might as well try
to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you  he said the day we
were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey  tweed suit and his
straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him  the bit of
seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago  my God
after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the 
mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he 
said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him
because  I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always
get round  him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he
asked me to say yes  and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and
the sky I was thinking  of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr
Stanhope and Hester and father  and old captain Groves and the sailors playing
all birds fly and I say stoop and  washing up dishes they called it on the pier
and the sentry in front of the governors  house with the thing round his white
helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish  girls laughing in their shawls
and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning  the Greeks and the jews
and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the  ends of Europe and Duke
street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby  Sharons and the poor
donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the  cloaks asleep in the
shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls  and the old
castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white  and
turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and
Ronda  with the old windows of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her
lover to kiss  the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets
and the night we  missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene
with his lamp and O  that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson
sometimes like fire and  the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda
gardens yes and all the queer  little streets and pink and blue and yellow
houses and the rosegardens and the  jessamine and germaniums and cactuses and
Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower  of the mountain yes when I put the
rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used to  or shall I wear a red yes and
how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I  thought well as well him as
another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again  yes and then he asked me
would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put  my arms around him
yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all  perfume yes 
</P>
<P>and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes. 
</P>
<P>OTHER USES OF ULYSSES 
</P>
<P>There is a general Joycean feel to Kate's work, both in its Irishness and in
the  overall level of its detail and the richness and diversity of its
reference. However, the  only certain Joycean reference in Kate's work is the
song &quot;My Lagan Love&quot;. A more  dubious one is Stephen's reference to &quot;every
ninth, breaking, plashing, from far,  from farther out, waves and waves&quot; in
the third chapter (Penguin p.38 line 40). Kate  and Joyce might simply be
independently aware of the same bit of folk wisdom  however. Also, Kate has
specically said she got the title from the quote on the back  of &quot;Hounds of
Love.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Another unlikely influence on Kate's work from Ulysses is &quot;all the
amount of  pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them
always I  wished I was one myself for a change&quot; [Penguin ed. page 638 lines
41-2.], which is  simular to &quot;I'd make a deal with god and get him to swap
our places&quot; [RUTH] 
</P>
<P> An edited version of the Ulysses passage, beginning with the line 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd love to have the whole place swimming in roses&quot; (642 line 42)

</P>
<P>has been set to music (!) for soprano (!) solo and orchestra by Stephen
Albert  under the title of &quot;Flower of the Mountain&quot; (!). I have
located the piano reduction of  Albert's score, which was published in 1986 by
Schirmer. It is orchestrated for 2  flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd
doubling English horn), 2 A clarinets, 2 F  horns, 2 Bb trumpets, percussion,
piano, harp and strings. It runs about 16:00. It was  first performed by Lucy
Shelton at the Y in NYC, 17 May 1986. I don't think it has  been recorded. 
</P>
<P> The recent film James Joyce's Women, which starred Fionula Flanagan as
Molly  Bloom, included a long soliloquy based on but also of course much
different from the  original in Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>The Firesign Theater used that same speech in the end of their album, &quot;How
 Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere At All?&quot;? Of 
course, the effect is slightly *different*... the speaker is that perpetual
flimflam  artist cum used-car salesman, Ralph Spoilsport... I don't know if this
one made it to  CD, but it's definitely worth a listen. 
</P>
<P>Rupert Croft-Cooke has a book entitled The Sensual World, but it's probably
just  a co-incidence.

</P>
<P>I bought a CD at the weekend called &quot;East Wind&quot; by Andy Irvine &amp;
Davy  Spillane, containing Macedonian &amp; Romanian music. Track 6 of said CD, &quot;Antice&quot;,
 contained a melody that sounded very familiar.... it is 90% the same as the
Uillean  pipe melody on &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, which is incidentally
played by .... Davy  Spillane. 
</P>
<P>For info: Antice is a traditional melody, the CD was released in 1992 (3
years after  the release of TSW)

<P>In article &lt;snelson-010594194505@ts6-37.upenn.edu&gt; you write: 
</P>
<P>&gt;Kate Bush's albums are full of things that hint at literary references,
but I  spotted something beyond coincidence. Stepping off the page, indeed. 
</P>
<P>&gt;The first verse of her song &quot;The Sensual World&quot; has the lines:

</P>
<P>&gt;..Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth <BR> &gt;..He
said I was a flower of the mountain, yes <BR> &gt;  But now I've powers over a
woman's body, yes 
</P>
<P>&gt;In the last chapter (&quot;Penelope&quot;) of James Joyce's Ulysses
there's the line: 
</P>
<P>&gt;&quot;yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it
was leapyear like  now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost
my breath yes he said I  was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all
a womans body yes that was  the one true thing he said in his life...&quot; 
</P>
<P>This was all worked out long ago by Jorn Barger, Love-Hounds Flame Master
and  Joyce Scholar. The &quot;recovered lyrics&quot; are in the archives.
Love-Hounds Flame Master  Emeritus Jon Drukman recorded a version of The Sensual
World using Jorn's lyrics  with a female singer (sorry but her name has slipped
my mind) and the  instrumental recording of the song. Good work, and credit
where credit is due. 
</P>
<P> Kate has confirmed that the original (and slightly different musically)
version  was indeed a direct lift, that she sought rights from the Joyce estate
and as refused.  She was them forced to write new lyrics about the same
charactor. She was (for  Kate) quite annoyed. 
</P>
<P>One additional point about the birth of the song - she whispers the word  &quot;re-write&quot;
in &quot;...our arrows of desire rewrite the speech&quot;
