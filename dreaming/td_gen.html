<P>[Doug answers: 
</P>
<P>(1) The song is about the quest for knowledge. One problem is how can you
*know*  anything when one person's truth is another's fiction, and vice versa,
etc. 
</P>
<P>(2) One of the great unknown mysteries of life. 
</P>
<P>(3) Many Viet Cong would wear a little silver Buddha on a chain around their
necks.  When they went into battle, they would put the Buddha in their mouths so
that if  they died, they would die with Bhuddha on their lips. 
</P>
<P>(4) You got the lyrics wrong, but &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; is another
song about the  quest for knowledge, perfection, or whatever. She uses the image
of God as  something that people feel they have to be worthy of before they can
obtain what  they want. Not until she is ready for Him, not until she has worked
hard enough  and is pure, can she have it all. 
</P>
<P>(5) It's actually &quot;We let the Weirdness in&quot;. Kate thinks we should
all be open to new  and strange phenomena. 
</P>
<P>(6) This song is about the plight of the Aborigine in Australia. The white
man  pushes them from their homes and destroys their land to dig for Uranium. 
Devils-in-a-bottle (alcohol) destroy their traditional way of life and also pull
them  from the bush (their traditional home). 
</P>
<P>(7) Your lyrics aren't quite right, but &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; is
a duet (though Kate  sings both voices) between a man and his lover. He wants to
go do some  smuggling to add excitement to his life, but she doesn't want him to
go. &quot;Would  you break even my wings, like a swallow.&quot; &quot;But you're
not a swallow&quot;. 
</P>
<P>(8) Paul? Who's Paul? She's singing to all the people she loves. 
</P>
<P>(9) In the song he does. In real life, Houdini's wife thought he had, but
then later  figured out that it was a hoax. 
</P>
<P>(10) This song is about a woman who has been left by her lover. She starts 
visualizing her body and herself as a haunted house a la *The Shining*. --Doug]

<BR> Subject: TD 
</P>
<P> I'd just like to say that I thought Nancy's friend, Kevin, had a lot of
intelligent  things to say regarding Kate. But Kevin, you have to understand
that many of us here  (perhaps especially Andy) are quite obsessed with her,
and, hence, may tend to go a  bit overboard at times. (Did someone say &quot;overboard&quot;?
&quot;Get out of the water&quot;!) 
</P>
<P>I first heard Kate's music when a friend mailed me a copy of &quot;Never For
Ever&quot;,  and I liked it upon my very first listen, having never even heard
of Kate Bush,  except for my friend's mention of her. It seems, though, that a
lot of her followers  didn't start out even slightly liking her, and I have to
admit that the first time I  heard &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (my second Kate LP),
I had doubts. But I soon came to  realize that it was a masterpiece. Actually,
between the first time I heard TD, and  realizing just how wonderful it was, I
acquired &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, which was  probably the LP that enabled me
to really enter Kate's curious world for the first  time. I heard things in HoL
that I had not heard in any music before, things that  stretched my imagination
wide open, at which time, I returned to TD. I'll tell you  the truth, I was
initially intrigued by TD because of it's splendid album cover. 
</P>
<P>Well, I soon found myself wrapped up in the world of TD, unable to escape
it's  amazingly textured sound. To this day, I have found no music that can
capture me  like TD did. I did finally pick up &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, and &quot;Lionheart&quot;,
and fell in love  with the &quot;little girl&quot; singing on both of those LP's
as well. I was also amazed at how  widely varied Kate's albums were. It was
almost as if they'd been done by different  (but all brilliant) artists, except
for Kate's inescapable, lovely voice. Anyway, I'm  sure you've heard enough
rantings from us foam-mouthed love-hounds, so I'll shut  up now.

<BR> Subject: A &quot;review&quot; of The Dreaming CD, HMV-mag &quot;Beat&quot;

</P>
<P>I got a free magazine from the HMV shop today called &quot;Beat&quot;, and
it contains a  review of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; on CD. I'm certain you'll all
be interested in this but  please note that I don't agree with this review!! 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH The Dreaming (EMI) 
</P>
<P>From 1982, Kate's least commercial album. The Dreaming strained the patience
of  her public with some eccentric attempts to convey the mystic wisdom of
primitive  cultures (the title track), a shrieking panic attack of a single (Sat
In Your Lap) and  an overall lapse from her customarily exquisite sense of
melody. Three years later  came Hounds Of Love, and all was forgiven. 
</P>
<P>The other reviews are generally unfavourable too, which seems strange in a 
magazine produced by a record shop which presumably wants people to buy it's 
products!

<P>Paul.

IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu <BR> Subject: HG 28 theory about proto
Ninth Wave
</P>
<P>IED has a tiny bit more concrete information to give you all as a guideline
for this  topic, through the courtesy of the new issue (#28) of Homeground, &quot;The
 International Kate Bush Fanzine&quot;. 
</P>
<P>...
</P>
<P>There's also an interesting new article by Peter Fitzgerald-Morris arguing
that  there is a mini-suite, so to speak -- a kind of proto- The Ninth Wave --
in The  Dreaming, which is comprised of &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot;, &quot;All
the Love&quot; and  &quot;Houdini&quot;. The link is thematic, not musical. (In
fact Peter almost never seems to  consider the music in his otherwise frequently
fascinating theoretical analyses.) 
</P>
<P>This article is based on a very intriguing (though in IED's opinion
far-fetched)  thesis, to the effect that TD is actually extremely
auto-biographical, and is in fact an  album about a traumatic break-up of a
romantic relationship, which is &quot;mended&quot; in  &quot;Houdini&quot;.
Peter makes the clear implication that Kate had a big break-up with Del  in '80,
and then apparently they made up later. And that consequently Kate used  this
experience as the foundation for the songs on TD. He says this interpretation is
 clear if you &quot;listen with an open heart&quot;! But he may also have some
inside  information which he chooses to keep from us. IED is dubious, frankly.
What do you  folks think?

<P>&gt; Also, regarding the cover of that record--doesn't the key in Kate's
mouth  resemble the pin of a hand grenade? That's been long noted I suppose, but
I've had  the record for years &amp; just thought of it. 
</P>
<P>Yeah, of course. It looks exactly like a grenade pin. And come to think of
it, it also  looks exactly like a little silver bullet, a small silver Buddha,
and a piece of seedcake,  too!

<BR> Subject: The Cover
</P>
<P> Kate was once asked (through the KBC Newsletter) the identity of the man in
 the photo on the cover of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. Her reply was, &quot;Why,
Houdini, of  course.&quot; 
</P>
<P>IED's guess is that the man is Anthony Van Laast, Kate's one-time dance 
instructor and collaborator on the choreography for some of her early videos and
the  Tour of Life.

<P>Run-out-groove &quot;secret&quot; messages [Sat In Your Lap]: 
</P>
<P>The most interesting of the three run-out-groove messages you asked about
(at  least in IED's opinion), Jimmy, is: &quot;Well done J.B. 1st Dan&quot;.
This, IED discovered  (and confirmed later through an an independent source) is
a message to Kate's  brother John Carder Bush, who had attained a &quot;first
dan&quot; in Karate (or possibly  another of the Oriental martial arts) shortly
before the cutting of the record in  question.

<P>[No. It's John Barrett, he is mentioned on the single-cover. Kate revealed

<H2>MELODY MAKER 
</H2>
<H3>September 11th 1982</H3>
<H2>KATE BUSH - THE DREAMING 
</H2>
<P>by Colin Irwin
</P>
<P> Under the premise that the Great British Public instinctively turns its
nose up at  anything that's a little unexpected, or which doesn't meet its
carefully coiffured  preconceptions, then this album will be an overwhelming
flop. 
</P>
<P>The people'll be guided in their dismissive diagnosis, of course, by the
all-wise  radio producers who will flick quickly through it for the new &quot;Man
With The Child  In His Eyes&quot;, fail to find it, assume Kate's gone off her
trolley, and make a grab for  the safety of Haircut One Hundred. 
</P>
<P>Reputedly two years in the making, the first album produced by Kate herself,
no  expense or musical craving spared...the result is mind- boggling. Even by
the  mannered, eccentric standards she's set herself, this is still an odd one;
you may have  thought &quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;The Wedding List&quot; on
NEVER FOR EVER a little weird,  then &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; and &quot;Houdini&quot;
here are positively manic. 
</P>
<P>Always an artist of extremes, Bush has allowed her highly theatrical
imagination  to run riot, indulging all her musical fantasies, following her
rampant instincts, and  layering this album with an astonishing array of shrieks
and shudders. 
</P>
<P>Initially it is bewildering and not a little preposterous, but try to hang
on through  the twisted overkill and the historic fits and there's much reward,
if only in the  sense of danger she constantly courts. 
</P>
<P>Consider the options for a glamourous girl singer with an acute sense of
melody;  consider that she's taken the riskiest, most uncommercial route; and
consider  whether this album should be regarded with patience and admiration,
even when it  occasionally slips right over the top. 
</P>
<P>Two of it's ingredients, &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;The Dreaming&quot;,
have already  been issued as singles and sunk without a trace, which is not only
significant but  tragic. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is the perfect example of the
passion for percussive torrents  that's overtaken her (and the influence of
African music?) yet it's one of her more  restrained vocal performances on the
album where her dynamic singing is one of  the prime features (&quot;Get Out Of
My House&quot; has her roaring and ranting like a caged  lion, &quot;Leave It
Open&quot; has her yelling like a demented mynah bird.) Elsewhere, on  &quot;Houdini&quot;
and &quot;All The Love&quot;, she'll break us in gently, even tenderly, before
the  fuse runs out and we reel in awe and amazement at the sheer power of her
rage. 
</P>
<P>There's only one even vaguely conventional track, the lively &quot;Suspended
In  Gaffa&quot;, though there's something strangely disconcerting even about
that and the  only light track is &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;, which is even
mildly funny as Kate  relates a tale of skullduggery with an exaggerated cockney
swagger. 
</P>
<P>The lyrics, naturally, are another thing altogether. An analyst would surely
come  up with an interesting conclusion for her obsession with lurid drama, so
vivid and  colourful it could be traditional balladry. 
</P>
<P>&quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; is about crime; &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;
is a graphic account of  terrorism and war; &quot;All The Love&quot; and &quot;Houdini&quot;
blaze in one different aspect of  death, the latter in a particularly complex
but clever way. Personally I reckon the girl  watches too many B-movies. 
</P>
<P>The epic track, though, the cornerstone of the album is &quot;Night Of The
Swallow&quot;,  which shows both her growing maturity as a writer and her
arrival as an outstanding  producer. Another complicated song (surprise,
surprise) it moves gracefully through  many changing moods and patterns; it's a
work of both beauty and anguish,  poignancy and eeriness. These twists of mood
are enhanced by the use of sublime  Irish music (Liam O'Flynn and Donal Lunny of
Planxty, Sean Keane of the  Chieftans) interspected with the rugged main action.

</P>
<P>Like most of the other tracks, I'm still not entirely sure what the hell's
going on  or what it's all about, but the puzzle's intriguing enough to entice
you back until  you unravel it. It's the sort of album that makes me want to
kidnap the artist and  demand the explanation and inspiration behind each track.

</P>
<P>If you're out there, Kate, do me a favour and give me a bell, huh?

<P>Yep. A factory-supplied orchestra &quot;sting&quot; lifted from Stravinsky's
&quot;Firebird.&quot; Kate  was the first to use it on a record, but for a while
