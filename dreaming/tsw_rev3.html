(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: Hi-Fi News and Record Review and
New Hi-Fi Sound 
</P>
<P> Hello, Chris here. First a review from &quot;Hi-Fi News and Record Review&quot;
(the  British publication) the Dec. issue. 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World EMI CDP 7930 7 82 
</P>
<P>At a private playback party which Kate Bush held earlier this summer, the 
audience of friends and colleagues was stunned into silence by the end of the
first  tape. Among those present was Nigel Kennedy, who plays on the album, and
the  Trio Bulgarka, there to here what Kate had done with their vocals. Kate
looked  genuinely surprised at the strength of everyones reaction, but she does
have an  uncanny ability to move the soul. &quot;Sensual World&quot; may not
have the obvious singles  and instant appeal of &quot;The Hounds Of Love&quot;
but it washes over you like a great  wave. Some tracks, like &quot;Rocket's Tale&quot;
include some surprisingly heavy guitar from  Dave Gilmour-the man who introduced
her to EMI. Other tracks are haunted by  Davy Spillane's Uillean Pipes. The
mixture of old and new works perfectly. The  songs are less clearly structured
than those on the last album. At times they seem to  meander aimlessly, as with
the eerie title track: but Kate Bush is a remarkable  woman and this is a
remarkable album. [ A : 1* ] 
</P>
<P> ( &quot;A&quot; is for &quot;Very Good&quot; - their best rating - for
recording, &quot;1&quot; is also for &quot;Very  Good&quot; - for performance,
with a star &quot;denotes outstanding quality&quot; ) 
</P>
<P>They also have a nice interview with Nigel Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>--------------------------
</P>
<P> A review from &quot;New Hi-Fi Sound&quot; (also British) Nov. issue: 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush: The Sensual World EMI EMD 1010 
</P>
<P>Although neither a continuous piece, nor obiously conceptual, &quot;The
Sensual  World&quot; takes its lead from the vocal and textural experiments on
side two of Kate  Bush's last album, &quot;The Hounds Of Love&quot;. 
</P>
<P>To this end she has looked to the folk scene, currently and rather
ironically the  best place to find real instrumental innovation these days.
Subsequently employed  have been the services of bouzouki player Donal Lunny (ex
member of the superb  Bothy Band and last heard on Elvis Costello's &quot;Spike&quot;
LP); Uilleann pipe player Davy  Spillane (a prime mover behind Enya's &quot;Watermark&quot;
album); Celtic harp player  Alan Stivell; and her own brother Paddy Bush, who
plays mandolin, whips (!) and a  variety of obscure wind and stringed
instruments. 
</P>
<P>She has also used Trio Bulgarka, a group of female Bulgarian singers whose
shrill,  wavering tones Bush contrives to imitate, often to rather embarrasing
effect, on  parts of the LP. 
</P>
<P>Such a radical lineup of talent is augmented by violinist Nigel Kennedy and 
original Bush mentor, guitarist Dave Gilmour, sounding far sharper than on
recent  Pink Floyd work. With these and arrangers like Michael Nyman, it's
little surprise  that &quot;The Sensual World&quot; boasts some extreme sounds
and ideas. Nor that at times it  fails pretty dramatically. 
</P>
<P>The title track is quite superb. Opening with a peal of church bells and a
great  sweep of multi-layered keyboards, it simply builds and builds over a
relentless,  plodding beat. Bush half-chants a lyric that repeats and re-
iterates unconnected  lines until they develop into a powerful and erotic
Mantra. The debut single from the  album, it repays repeated listenings if only
for wondering at how someone can glue  such an expansive arrangement so securely
simply by moaning 'mmh,yes' at the end  of each line. Draw your own conclusions
from that one. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Fog&quot; is similarly fascinating. Bush compares the shock of
first love to a  childhood swimming lesson, her real-life father intoning the
haunting phrase: 'Just  put your feet down, child, because you're all grown up
now'. 
</P>
<P>The tune develops from Davy Spillane's solo whistles into a middle section
of  quite awesome beauty; Nigel Kennedy's tortuously brilliant fiddle-playing
pierces a  great orchestral swell. 
</P>
<P>The rest of the album, inventive though it may be, never quite matches the
power  of these two tracks. Much of the fault lies with the underlying tone of
naivety and  rural conservatism which seems to pervade the whole recording. &quot;Deeper
 Understanding&quot;, a song about a child's obsession with a home com-puter is
as weak  and shallow as it's theme is hackneyed. And almost for the first time
ever - on a  song entitled &quot;Between A Man And A Woman&quot; - Kate displays
a frighting lack of  nous about love and romance. 'It's so hard for love to stay
together,' she sings,  'with the modern western pressures'- she seems to be
witnessing, rather than  experiencing, that pressure, however. 
</P>
<P>Contrast this song with her classic &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, and
it's easy to  wonder whether Kate - the reclusive country girl, a star since her
early teens - gets  her ideas from life or from some very good books. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Never Be Mine&quot; restores some of the faith in her extraordinary
talant. It's first  verse - an account of walking home through the burning
stubble and seeing her  lover's face 'ghostly in the smoke' - could only be
plucked from real life, and  brilliantly underlines the sense of a love lost in
the very moment that it's won. The  vocal work of the Trio Bulgarka and the
mournful tones of Spillane's Uilleann pipes  combine quite beautifully here. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World&quot; is a highly sophisticated musical tapestry
which will take  dozens of listenings to unravel and appreciate. At this stage,
though, it seems to lack  the edge and sheer musical power of &quot;The Hounds
Of Love&quot;, and depicts an artist,  who for all her will to experiment, has
become just a little too introverted and  self-obsessed.

<P>Date: Sat, 6 Jan 90 21:07:18 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Dirty Linen 
</P>
<P>There's an article about Kate in the Winter issue of Dirty Linen, a magazine
 published in Baltimore. For those worried about copyright infringement, I
should say  that this magazine says, &quot;Excerpts and entire reviews my be
reprinted as long as  credit is given to the author, artist, or photographer and
Dirty Linen magazine.&quot; I  intend to do that. Here's the article: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: In Focus 
</P>
<P>by John Anthony Wilcox 
</P>
<P>&quot;Imagination sets in, 
</P>
<P>then all the voices begin.&quot; 
</P>
<P>-- from &quot;Fullhouse&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush. In the U.K. and Europe the name invokes memories of a seemingly 
endless string of hits. &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Babooshka,&quot; &quot;Sat
in Your Lap,&quot;  &quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot;
the list goes on and on. But in the States,  it's a different story. Here, La
Diva Bush has only obtained a small, albeit devoted,  audience. Her music is
alternately wistful, folky, gutsy, and passionate. Perhaps it's  the inability
for the public to pigeonhole her into one concrete style of music that  has let
stardom elude Bush here. No matter. What Kate Bush the 
singer/songwriter/performer/producer presents has very little to do with stardom
 and quite a bit to do with substance and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>In a conversation I had with Kate Bush a while back, she mentioned that she 
seldom, if ever, wrote in an autobiographical context. She much preferred
creating  characters, and the songs were stories either about them or from their
point of view.  One need look no further than her introduction to the public --
the song  &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; She relates the story of obsessive love
from the viewpoint ot  the deceased Cathy and her beyond-the-grave love for
Heathcliff. Bronte would  surely find no fault in Kate Bush's homage to her
timeless characters. &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot; was a prelude to Bush's
debut album The Kick Inside. The album  showcased a fragile, imaginative young
woman and focused on delicate piano (played  by Kate) and lush arrangements to
counterpoint Bush's willowy multi-octave voice.  Her sophomore album, Lionheart,
was much in the same vein. Perhaps *too* much. 
</P>
<P>Lionheart came across as a somewhat lightweight Xerox of The Kick Inside but
 with less substance. However, for all its faults, the album did contain a few
gems  among the pebbles. &quot;Fullhouse,&quot; &quot;Wow,&quot; and &quot;In
the Warm Room&quot; are very strong  compositions, and &quot;Wow&quot; in
particular is to date the closest Kate has come to writing  about herself. This
album was also backed by a brief but memorable tour that  yielded both the Kate
Bush: Live at the Hammersmith Odeon videocassette and the  live EP On Stage.
This would mark an end to a chapter in Kate's career, as the next  release
brought us a new and different performer. 
</P>
<P>1980 saw the release of Never for Ever. With it, Bush took a more active
hand in  every facet of her music -- from concept to arranging to producing, she
was in on  every step. The album opens with &quot;Babooshka,&quot; a tale of
infidelity, and closes with  &quot;Breathing,&quot; a prayer for our Earth. In
between, Never for Ever offers a cornucopia  of styles, and an impressive array
of guests. Look for contributions from Preston  Heyman to Mike Moran to Roy
Harper (Kate would return the favor by appearing  on Harper's The Unknown
Soldier disc that same year). The album is full of  mandolin, balalaika,
bodhran, and even a strumento de porco, thanks in no small part  to Kate's
brother Paddy, a specialist in ethnic instruments. 
</P>
<P>As big a step as Never for Ever was from Lionheart, 1982's The Dreaming was
a  giant *leap* from Never for Ever. A caustic, dark album full of cynicism and 
shattered dreams, The Dreaming puts aside Bush's inherent romanticism in favor
of  kinetic energy. Bush whoops, snarls, and quivers her way through the
predominently  percussive &quot;Sat in Your Lap,&quot; &quot;Get Out of My
House,&quot; and &quot;Suspended in Gaffa,&quot; to  name a few. But it is the
title cut that shows Kate Bush at her strongest, her most  confident. &quot;The
Dreaming&quot; relates the plight of the Aborigines and is punctuated by 
authentic digeridoo and Bullroarer. Bush handles it all with sensitivity and
respect  for all involved. 
</P>
<P>By that time Kate was in full control of every aspect of her musical
endeavors and  clearly loving it. That buoyancy is reflected in 1985's Hounds of
Love. Side one of  Hounds... showcases Kate Bush, the quirky pop princess in &quot;Running
Up That Hill,&quot;  &quot;The Big Sky,&quot; and the title cut. Bright and
poppish, they are full of color and  sparkle. They are contrasted by &quot;The
Ninth Wave,&quot; a side-long concept piece. Kate  informed me that &quot;The
Ninth Wave&quot; relates a tale of a drowning person who  encounters their past,
present, and future. Cheer up, folks, there's a happy ending.  Folkaholics
should note that members of Planxty turn up on this epic to provide  some
musical wonder to a section entitled &quot;Jig of Life.&quot; Once again,
another chapter  in Kate Bush's story closes, and the 1986 retrospective The
Whole Story is a fine  souvenir, collecting many of her finest moments as well
as a new tune, &quot;Experiment  IV&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Which brings us to 1989. After a lengthy hiatus, Bush came back with The 
Sensual World. It's clearly her most &quot;global&quot; effort to date,
incorporating rhythms  and instrumentation from such diverse sources as the
Middle East and the Balkan  countries. One of the most well-known Bulgarian
groups, The Trio Bulgarka,  provides authentic vocals. Lyrically, Bush is
delving more into relationships and less  into creating stories from whole
cloth. Songs like &quot;Never Be Mine,&quot; &quot;Reaching Out,&quot;  and &quot;Between
a Man and a Woman&quot; are her most direct yet. Curiously, she also  chose to
include an older song, the delicate &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;, which
originally  appeared a few years back on the motion picture soundtrack to She's
Having My  Baby [sic]. Also, in a tip of the hat to her mentor, Pink Floyd's
David Gilmour, who  was responsible for getting Kate her big break, lends some
blazing guitar to the  album. 
</P>
<P>It should be noted that Kate Bush doesn't lie idle between albums. She's
guested  on several other artist's albums, as well as turning up on the odd
soundtrack or two.  Bush has also lent her considerable talents to several
charitable organizations, most  recently to the preservation of the rain
forests. This woman's work is clearly far  from finished!

<P>Date: Wed, 17 Jan 90 15:35:56 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: CD Review 
</P>
<P>As Dave Steiner just posted, there's a review of the album in the Feb. issue
of  CD Review. Not only that, but there's a prominent picture of the album in
the table  of contents. Here's the review: 
</P>
<P>Best CD of the Month 
</P>
<P>Performance: 9 Sound Quality: 9 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush: The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Columbia CK 44164 (AAD) 1989 (89) [I don't know what that last number
means.] 
</P>
<P>Disc time: 45:59 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush doesn't know it yet, but she's not 19 anymore. Preciousness still
wraps  around her like a silk shawl, too fragile to handle, yet so beautiful and
pure that it  demands attention. Fortunately, beneath the affected mantle lies a
woman whose  eyes are wide open to the world around her. You see, Kate Bush is a
poet, an  observer of life, and whatever role she chooses to play is simply an
attempt to convey  her observations. 
</P>
<P>On The Sensual World, as on most of Bush's albums, those observations deal 
mainly with male-female relations. From the eroticism of the breathy &quot;mmmm,
yes&quot;  that accents each verse of the title track (a technique sure to be
despised as much by  critics of her work as it will be worshipped by her loyal
fans), to the unrestrained  outpouring of feelings on &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;
(as cathartic for the listener as it  probably was for the singer), bush ponders
the eternal struggle of intimate human  emotion and the communication of those
emotions between man and woman. 
</P>
<P>As usual, Bush plays all piano and keyboards. Joining her is guitarist and 
perennial fan David Gilmour of Pink Floyd (who &quot;discovered&quot; Bush at
age 16,  organized her first demo, and arranged her signing to EMI), Bulgaria's
Trio  Bulgarka (whose unusual vocal style can be heard on &quot;Deeper
Understanding,&quot;  &quot;Never Be Mine,&quot; and &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;),
Del Palmer (who also engineered the disc, in  addition to supplying bass,
guitar, and percussion), and Davey Spillane on Uillean  pipes (which add a
haunting edge to the title track, inspired by James Joyce's  Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>Bush's mystical, almost minimalist approach to music revolves around the
building  up and releasing of tension, not any preconceived notion of song
design. While her  voice is the material with which she weaves this at times
libidinous tapestry, the  dreamy arrangements and Bush's attention to melody
(however odd their structures  may be) leave no doubt that she is not as
self-indulgent as some think. The Sensual  World also reveals just how much
Bush, who takes producer credits, cares about  sound. Thick with layers of
instrumentation that are orchetral in scope, the  soundstage is never cluttered.

</P>
<P>Bush wants us to understand with this disc that the past and the future are
not  abstract entities over which we have no control. She is singing about
concrete  realities affected by present-day activity. The beauty of living in
the sensual world is  one of emotion, of pure, unadulterated experience with no
values attached to it. --  Edward Murray 
</P>
<P>------------------
</P>
<P>Review of the album from the Jan. 26 issue of Goldmine : 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World Columbia (OC 44164) 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush has always invested her music with enough odd textures and musical
 twists and turns that she not only keeps her music sounding fresh, but
unpredictable  from disc to disc. The Sensual World, Bush's sixth studio LP,
isn't quite as bizarre  as, say, 1982's The Dreaming, but it has its moments.
The ourtright strangest song  here is the whimsical &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; in
which Bush packs herself with gunpowder  and lights a fuse, launching herself
into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>The song begins with the layered vocal harmonies of Bulgaria's Trio
Bulgarka,  then segues into a cacophony of voices set to a rocking beat. The
trio lends its  distinctive melodies voices [sic] to &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot;
about a lonely woman's  love affair with her computer, and the ballad &quot;Never
Be Mine,&quot; where a woman  clings to a fantasy world (&quot;I want you as the
dream, not the reality&quot;) but lives to  regret it (&quot;The thrill and the
hurting/I know that this will never be mine&quot;). 
</P>
<P>Bush doesn't go for typical lyrical themes. She's much too eccentric for
that: in  the percussive stomp &quot;Heads We're Dancing,&quot; Bush takes on
the voice of a woman  at a '39 dance who recognizes her partner of the night
before in the morning's  newspaper (&quot;It couldn't be you/It's a picture of
Hitler&quot;). Further, Bush's ballads  (&quot;The Fog,&quot; &quot;This Woman's
Work&quot;) are more inventive than most other artists'  attemps at balladry,
and though she may keep her fans waiting a long time between  recordings the
results are always well worth it. -- Tierney Smith 
</P>
<P>Interestingly, Gillian G. Gaar, who used to edit For The Love Of Kate, wrote
 several reviews in this issue, but not this one! 
</P>
<P>That's it for now, folks!

<P>Date: Sat, 20 Jan 90 21:39:47 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Cover 
</P>
<P>I found a review in a magazine called Cover, published in New York City.
This is  from the Jan. issue. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World CBS 
</P>
<P>Pick Of The Month: A rich and ephemeral song cycle set in Lawrencian images.
 Stunning in its success, and like other of its kind (namely Van Morrison's
Astral  Weeks and Roxy Music's Avalon ), its rewards are reaped by repeated
intent  listenings and forgetting all you've read about it. -- Paul Paddock 
</P>
<P>Today I came across the premier issue (Vol. 1, No. 1) of a new magazine
called  Exit, which calls itself &quot;The Alternative Magazine.&quot; It's
published in La Jolla,  California (near San Diego for those unfamiliar with
California geography). 
</P>
<P>Anyway, it has a whole page Kate Bush Discography for some reason. No
article  or interview, just a discography. I won't post it since it's not quite
as comprehensive  as the lists IED has posted lately. However, it does include
almost all the official  singles, albums, etc. It also includes the addresses of
the Kate Bush Fan Club and  eight fanzines. 
</P>
<P>Eight pages before this discography, they have a review of the album: 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World CBS 
</P>
<P>After four years of ripening, a new fruit is hanging on Kate Bush's tree of 
talents and inspirations, blending its sounds with the echoes of Hounds of Love.
 Although The Sensual World can hardly become as commercially successful as its 
precedent, it is an album of mature work. The listener will probably have to
listen to  it several times before they can attempt to appreciate its value.
Although carefully  balanced and mixed, the album might sound (sort of) raw, as
far as timbre is  concerned. This is a consequence of Bush's using quite unusual
instruments such as  villain pipes [sic], valiha, bouzouki, fiddle, whistles,
etc., which hug the songs with a  special warmth. 
</P>
<P>Another contribution to the overall sound is made by three Bulgarian
singers, the  Trio Bulgarka, whose melodic lines, although sounding unfamiliar
to the western  ears, create an harmonic effect that ranges from interesting to
hair-raising,  especially in &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; and &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;.
Two other important  contributions to the sound of the album are made by Michael
Kamen, who skillfully  made the orchestra arrangements and Dave Gilmore [sic]
(old buddy of Kate's) who  did not fail to make his presence noticeable by
playing a couple of his strumming  guitar solos. 
</P>
<P>In spite of the many guest musicians, however, The Sensual World is still a
very  personally made album. It is charged with Kate's own emotions and
experiences.  Don't hesitate to respond to her invitation of sharing those
emotions. Grab the  delicious fruit from her tree and take a deep bite. (Mmm..
.yes!) -- Nectarios Tradas

<P>Date: Sat, 27 Jan 90 22:24:28 PST <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Feb. issue of Car Audio 
</P>
<P>Hi folks. I've got some items I hope will be of interest. 
</P>
<P>First, I found a couple more good reviews of the album. This one's from the
Feb.  issue of Car Audio : 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush has been making compelling music for about a decade, and she still
has  only a small, dedicated core of fans. Her appearance on Peter Gabriel's So
album  brought her exposure to a lot more people, but she is not the type of
artist that  makes a record with an eye toward the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>Instead, Bush follows her own muse, and it takes her to some pretty
interesting  places on Sensual World : the dreamy, swirling environs of &quot;The
Fog&quot; and a study of  computer dependency in &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot;
for example. Bush's lyrics and  music are mystical, but not in the forced,
air-headed sense of a cape-twirling Stevie  Nicks. 
</P>
<P>With her somewhat excessive musical backdrops stripped away and her frail
voice  at the forefront of the music, as on &quot;This Woman's Work,&quot; Bush
proves herself a  potent, evocative vocalist and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>-- Doug Newcomb 
</P>
<P>-----------------
</P>
<P>And here's the review from the Feb. Music Technology : 
</P>
<P>KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World Columbia 
</P>
<P>Pick of the Month [Yeah!] 
</P>
<P>After four long years since the release of Hounds Of Love, die-hard Kate
Bush  fans can rejoice in yet another startling display of exceptional creative
talent. In many  ways, this new album is a refinement of the style that she has
been cultivating for  years. Her particular brand of theatrics blended with
mutant Irish folk rhythms  blended with far-out spacey arrangements permeates
every nook and cranny of The  Sensual World to produce a fantastically affecting
brew. 
</P>
<P>As with her past recordings, she once again breaks new ground in
soundscapes.  The beetle's wing of the brew this time around is the inclusion of
the Trio Bulgarka  on four [?] of the tracks, most notably on the tragic
'Rocket's Tail.' The bizarre  vocal timbre and nuance of these Bulgarian folk
singers lend an unearthly quality to  the mood of the album (as if Kate ever
needed help in *that* department!) 
</P>
<P>In many ways, The Sensual World is more akin to her first two albums, The
Kick  Inside and Lionheart. Whereas Hounds Of Love placed major emphasis on 
atmosphere (and she certainly doesn't abandon this altogether -- 'The Fog' is 
perhaps her most richly crafted tone poem to date), this album focuses on
*songs*.  And like her first two albums, The Sensual World is remarkably
listenable. An  excellent example can be found in 'Love and Anger,' with its
infectious rhythm,  propelled by a titillating inaction between the drums and
wildly arpeggiating synths  (*warning*: the video does not do the song
justice!). 
</P>
<P>I could go on raving about this album for pages, but instead I'll simply
insist that  you listen for yourself. 
</P>
<P>-- Dan Rue 
</P>
<P>----------------------
</P>
<P>Lastly, a while ago I posted the cover story on Kate that appeared in the
Dec.  issue of Pulse! magazine. The Feb. issue has just come out (there was no
Jan. issue),  and the following letter appears in it: 
</P>
<P>Bush League 
</P>
<P>Dear Pulse!, 
</P>
<P>Thank you for being among the few to have broken the U.S. silence on the 
subject of Kate Bush and her work. In 1979, I believe I was the only person in 
Connecticut listening to The Kick Inside and I was relieved to move to
California in  1980 and discover two other people who knew who she was. Will
Johnson's article  [December '89] was informative, but I would like to correct
two errors he made. 
</P>
<P>First, &quot;The Man With the Child in His Eyes&quot; was on The Kick
Inside, not  Lionheart, and in fact was recorded in 1977 (along with &quot;Saxophone
Song&quot;) with  David Gilmour producing. 
</P>
<P>Second, in the &quot;Breathing&quot; video, Kate is not inside &quot;large

</P>
<P>Hi folks, I don't remember if anyone posted this but I figgured all of the
fellow  love-hounds would like to know what what is in the &quot;official
press-kit&quot; Here is the  scoop: 
</P>
<P>There is a 2 page press release which I have included. A 8x10 black &amp;
white  glossy of Kate's head. It looks like a shot from the Sensual World single
cover  sessions. The picture is of her looking up and to the left, it shows a
semi-profile  where the right side of her face is almost all washed out white. 
</P>
<P>So, if you want to compare the following with the so-called articles in the 
magazines, read on: 
</P>
<P>Eclectic Music 
</P>
<P>CBS Press Release,  Posted January 1990 
</P>
<P>Eclectic Music is not affiliated with CBS or any other record company, this
press  release is being reprinted here with full permission from CBS and is
being  reprinted with the sole intent of disseminating information. 
</P>
<P>The following text is directly from a CBS Press Release 
</P>
<P> KATE BUSH 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD, the sixth studio album from Kate Bush, features ten  new
compositions by the artist (eleven on compact disc and cassette). The new LP 
was produced by Kate, recorded by Del Palmer, and mixed by Kevin Killen. 
</P>
<P>THE SENSUAL WORLD was recorded mainly by Kate's studio in Kent, although 
sessions also took place in Dublin and at EMI's Abbey Road complex. Kate plays 
piano and keyboards and is augmented by a host of acclaimed musicians. These 
include Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka, whose unusual voices are heard on three songs:
 &quot;Deeper Understanding,&quot; Never Be Mine,&quot; and &quot;Rocket's Tail.&quot;
There is also the  haunting sound of Davey Spillane's Uillean pipes on the
title-tune (and first U.K.  single), &quot;The Sensual Word,&quot; inspired by
the James Joyce masterpiece, Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush was born in Bexley, Kent, England, on July 30, 1958. Her father,
an avid  spare time piano player, and mother, an Irish woman who takes much joy
in music  and dancing, raised Kate and her two older brothers with an open mind
to artistic  experiments. 
</P>
<P>Kate began violin lessons (reluctantly) around the age of nine but took a 
passionate interest in the piano. The day after her father showed her the scale
of C,  Kate became a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>As a result of a three-track demo, organized and financed by Pink Floyd's
Dave  Gilmour, Kate was signed to EMI before leaving school. Accepting a modest
advance  from EMI, she was able to concentrate full time on her dance studies,
which were  initially inspired, and later taught, by theatrical mime-master
Lindsay Kemp. They  would prove invaluable later on with the dawning of the age
of video. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd wanted to make a record more than anything else,&quot; Kate
remembers. Her  ambition was achieved in mid-1977 with the recording of her
debut album, The Kick  Inside. Her first single, &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot;
became a #1 single in the U.K.  (January, 1978). It was followed by the album,
which rapidly sold over one million  copies in the U.K. alone. 
</P>
<P>The pressure was on to make and release a second album. But when Kate 
realized her recording schedule has to be fitted around promotional demands all 
over the continent, she vowed to exercise much more control over her career in
the  future. Nonetheless, the Lionheart album came out in December '78 and a
decision  to tour was finalized. 
</P>
<P>Thirty odd dates took place in Britain and Europe during the spring '79.
Every  show was a sellout and the two and a half hours of music, dance, mime,
and magic  defied critics' expectations. But the rigors exhausted Kate to such
an extent she's  never been able seriously contemplate the idea of another tour.

</P>
<P>The Kate Bush on Stage (Live EP) was released September, 1979. This was the 
first co-production between Kate and John Kelly (who'd engineered the first two 
albums). 
</P>
<P>Then came the five and a half minute single, &quot;Breathing,&quot; which
championed  Green issues back in 1980, and marked a major change in the
expectations of Kate  Bush's many observers. The single entitled &quot;Babooshka&quot;
(June, 1980) was followed in  September by a new album, Never For Ever. Here was
a vinyl confirmation that  Kate had much to offer for the often bland world of
pop. 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Dreaming album was so difficult to make,&quot; says Kate of her
next record  (released September, 1982). &quot;Just about everything that could
go wrong did during  that period.&quot; With studio problems and her method of
working the cost involved, she  decided to upgrade her own demo studio into a
professional recording level. 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, critics were left to ponder the merits of an album that had
yielded  &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; and the title track as singles. In fact,
The Dreaming added  considerably to the Kate Bush fan base between it's release
and that of Hounds of  Love exactly three years later. As with The Dreaming,
Kate produced Hounds of  Love, Del Palmer engineered and, for the first time,
they could boast of an album  recorded in their own studio. 
</P>
<P>Hounds of Love quickly established itself as Kate's most successful album to
date  both in a commercial and critical sense. It was the first to give her real
chart success  in America, hitting the top 30 in 1985 (as did the &quot;Running
Up That Hill&quot; single). The  album was also the catalyst for several superb
videos, most memorably the one that  accompanied &quot;Cloudbusting,&quot; which
starred Kate and Donald Sutherland -- one of  her favorite actors. 
</P>
<P>The Whole Story came next, the million-selling compilation album and video 
released late in 1986. Both formats charted high amongst the best-selling titles
that  year. Kate's videos, many of which are directed by her, are almost as
popular as her  records. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I know it's taken a long time but each record gets harder to make,&quot;
she says,  explaining the four-year gap between the albums, Hounds of Love and
THE  SENSUAL WORLD, the latter released worldwide on October 17, 1989. &quot;This
is my  most personal and female album so far. I particularly wanted &quot;The
Sensual World&quot;  as the first single because I feel it is a strong
expression of positive female energy.&quot;

(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: Audio magazine review 
</P>
<P>Chris here, Here is the review from the February issue of Audio magazine. 
</P>
<P>The Sensual World: 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush Colombia 44164, CD; AAD; 45:59 
</P>
<P>Sound: B, Performance: B 
</P>
<P>Had she not been so stubbornly original from the start of her career, it
would be  tempting to say that Kate Bush is trying to edge toward main-stream
accessibility  with The Sensual World. Compared with earlier albums, there's
less here that  grates on the unprepared ear, and she has delivered some bluesy,
even arguably  funky, vocals. But there's also little evidence that she's traded
her quirkiness for  pop flash. There are no superhooks, no Top 40 bids; even the
cover art is subdued. A  simple black and white headshot in which a flower
obscures Bush's mouth, it  betrays exactly why this album may well distance her
from old fans and new  prospects alike. 
</P>
<P>As producer, Bush presents a collection of sonic experiments whose success
or  failure depends largely on whether or not she has obscured her own singing.
When  she veils her voice, with it's amazing range of pitch and mood, the songs
simply bog  down. On the title track, a tame and uninspiring Bush sounds like
Madonna singing  Peter Gabriel. Worse, she has often pushed her voice so far
back in the mix that it's  lost among thick, airless layers of strings,
woodwinds, Fairlight wizardry, and  zillion-tracked background vocals. Bush's
great angry-cat snarl in &quot;Between a Man  and a Woman&quot; for example, is
ruined whenever it runs into the dense  accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>Without making full use of her voice, the title track and other songs are
simply  layers of overpowering sensuality - baklava without a nip of coffee to
cut the  sweetness. Bush chose analog recording for this project; had she worked
digitally,  there may have been more crispness and separation. 
</P>
<P>The songs with spare arrangements work better, letting Bush's voice and
often  exquisite keyboard work shine through. Talk about a sensual world: Few
singers have  Bush's power to touch the listener this way, to make singing so
luscious and physical  - carnal and sublime in the same breath. Listen
especially to &quot;This Woman's Work,&quot;  where a breathy whisper tickles
the ear like a feather, and &quot;Walk Straight Down the  Middle,&quot; where
the voice is a sinuous and reedy snake. 
</P>
<P>Bush's canniest move was to enlist the Trio Bulgarka, the hot Bulgarian a 
cappalla group with jackhammer vibratos. The Trio is cleverly used to portray
the  voice of a &quot;loving&quot; computer on &quot;Deeper Understanding.&quot;
But it's on &quot;Rocket's Tale&quot;  (where Bush gets down to some
straight-out blues punched into shape by Dave  Gilmour's guitar) that we hear
what this matchup was meant to be: a glorious battle  of the sopranos, where
Bush goes head-on with the Trio, no holds barred.

Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Wilson Library Bulletin 
</P>
<P>I found another excellent review of the album. This one is from the January
issue  of Wilson Library Bulletin. Many of you probably don't realize that this
magazine  consistently gives Kate great reviews. Here's this one: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Kate Bush's soprano is haunting, her lyrics are enchanting, and on her
latest  album, The Sensual World, one of Britain's most tantalizing singers has
made what  she calls &quot;a strong expression of positive female energy.&quot;
Ever since recording her  debut album twelve years ago, Bush has insisted firmly
on creating her own ethereal  kind of music, never being swayed by fads or
trends. Instead, she turns to flowery  language and strange accompaniment to
help bring her lyrics to life. The album's  title song is rife with literary
allusins to James Joyce's Ulysses, accentuated by the  plaintive call of
uilleann pipes. On several tunes, Bush complements her own pure  lead vocals
with the exotic chants of Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka. Bush's albums spin  webs
that are difficult to escape.&quot;

(Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) <BR> Subject: The Absolute Sound 
</P>
<P> Chris here, 
</P>
<P>This is the latest review of &quot;The Sensual World&quot; from the
March/april issue of  The Absolute Sound. I'll warn you beforehand... it's
lousy. 
</P>
<P> Kate Bush: The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>[Kate Bush (prod.); Del Palmer (eng.).] Columbia OC 44164 LP. 
</P>
<P>Let's start with the sound: Magical! No matter how good your system, this
record  will turn it into a glazed donut. Bush's voice sounds sampled and
synthesized. It's  always thin, reedy, sometimes raspy, flat, and simply not
pleasant to listen to. At the  end of one track there's just Bush
laughing-attached to so much garbage you can  hear the sea gulls circling. 
</P>
<P>Instruments are vaguely lateral on a two-dimensional soundstage, awash in
icy,  digital reverb. Drums are soft dull thuds and bass is a deep,
character-less rumble.  There's no space between instruments, no contrast, few
colors. It's like viewing  television with the brightness control turned up.
This is one of those recordings that  forces you to go back to a reference disk
just to make sure nothing's wrong with  your system. 
</P>
<P>Musically, things start off hot. &quot;You don't need words-just one kiss
then another,&quot;  the beautiful Kate sings in &quot;The Sensual World&quot;.
In the end, though, she avoids her  &quot;arrows of desire&quot;, singing and
licking her lips: &quot;I said, mmh, yes, But not yet, mmh,  yes, mmh, yes.&quot;
Tease. 
</P>
<P>From there, I'm aFreud the symbolism becomes a bit obscure for me on too 
many songs, and too obvious on others, though a couple of times, Bush strikes
just  the right balance, advising an outsider to stay out of the age-old battle
&quot;Between a  Man and a Woman&quot; and on the finale, &quot;This Woman's
Work&quot;. Overall, it's just not  worth trying to penetrate the oppressive
gray cloud in which Bush has cast her  music on this record. The Sensual World
is only for adoring fans of this quirky artist. 
</P>
<P> Michael Fremer 
</P>
<P> A few things are worth mentioning. First, he had the mis-fortune to hear
the  CBS Lp release. Anyone who wishes to truly hear Kate's music should run out
and  buy British Lp pressings. The British EMI pressings aren't the quietest,
(the  Japanese are) but they are the most musical. 
</P>
<P>What's so baffling is that TAS did a wonderful feature on Kate in January of
1987  after Hounds of Love. The writer (Ifan Payne) complained about the sound
quality  then, but understood and admired the artistic intent.

<P>Date: Mon, 24 Sep 90 17:20:01 PDT <BR> From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward
Suranyi) <BR> Subject: Review of TSW in the Pittsburgh Press 
</P>
<P>Today I discovered the following review of The Sensual World. It appeared in
the  Nov. 19, 1989 issue of the Pittsburgh Press. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush sends 'Sensual World' into orbit 
</P>
<P>By Peter B. King 
</P>
<P>&quot;The Sensual World,&quot; Kate Bush. Columbia 
</P>
<P>Imagine heat lightning shooting from your speakers, and you get some idea of
the  effect of one listen to the title track of Kate Bush's new album. Like Joe
Jackson's  &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; or Bruce Hornsby's &quot;On the Western
Skyline,&quot; &quot;The Sensual World&quot;  has a rare immediacy. 
</P>
<P>Over Davey Spillane's wailing uillean pipes and a racing high-tech rhythm
track,  Bush trills a lush, shimmering ode to the senses based on James Joyce. 
</P>
<P>If nothing else, you'll have to agree her repeated &quot;Oh yes&quot; --
sung in a breathless  vibrato quicker than a hummingbird's wings -- is the
sexiest pop song utterance in  years. 
</P>
<P>By comparison, the rest of &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is merely
excellent. The songs  are passionate, intelligent and mysterious. 
</P>
<P>The slightly ambiguous subject matter focuses on men and women. Bush has
been  called arty and precious, but the toughness of her sentiments belies those
labels. 
</P>
<P>Musically, Bush has a knack for melodic, funky, organic blends of electronic
gear  with exotic world-music touches such as the bouzouki and Bulgarian folk
singers. 
</P>
<P>Comparisons? Peter Gabriel will put you in the ballpark, I suppose.
(British,  electronics, world music, etc.) 
</P>
<P>In her own style, Bush's singing conveys the depth and utter conviction of,
say,  Joni Mitchell or Chrissie Hynde. 
</P>
<P>Only one song -- &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; -- sounds ordinary. But also
on the  down side, Bush's penchant for packing the sonic gallery gets in the way
a little. The  arrangements are occasionally too busy. 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; is a palpable garden of earthly
delights.

&lt;katrina michael@muwayf.unimelb.edu.au&gt; <BR> Subject: &quot;Beat&quot; 
</P>
<P>Hi all, 
</P>
<P>I thought I'd post a review I happened to come across recently on TSW. It 
appeared in &quot;Beat&quot;, a Melbourne-based music paper. If anyone would
like to read  the full (typed) review, email me and I'll send it to you. 
</P>
<P>Full Bloom - The Sensual World 
</P>
<P>Chris Roberts 
</P>
<P>&quot;When Lauren was a small girl, she would stand in the field and call
the cats. One  by one they would come to her through the grass, across which lay
the ice of the  coming winter; and she could see them in the light of the moon.
She herself  wondered why they came. They were wild and heeded no one else;
their thrashing  in the fields did the farmers no good and Lauren's father hated
the howl they  invested in the night, like a thousand bleeding babies in the
grass. But they came for  her and it was certain therefore, because of that,
that she was in some way special&quot; 
</P>
<P>- from 'Days Between Stations', Steve Erickson. 
</P>
<P>Even reading the record company's biography of Kate Bush - that too is like 
beginning a breathless windswept novel - &quot;her father is an avid piano
player and her  mother is an Irish woman who takes much joy in music and
dancing. Kate and her  two brothers were raised with an open mind to artistic
experiments&quot;. Signed to EMI  before leaving school, Kate never had to worry
too much about real life. Quite right.  We should be eternally grateful that
Kate was never stifled by mundane reality, was  always allowed complete freedom
of expression in a non-contemporary fashion. Her  confidence grows and we
benefit from a music which is so naturally 'outside', so  gracefully 'above' the
sweatings and strainings of those who strive to be alternative,  so
instinctively 'other'. Because Kate Bush's music emanates from a grander 
reality, an inner truth. 
</P>
<P>She takes her time, acts like she lives in a leafy vacuum with her heart,
and every  so often sends out a record as a message in a bottle. Like all her
best achievements,  this album marries the physical honesty and self-pride of
Marvin Gaye to the  querying passionate intelligence of say, Elizabeth Smart,
and gives birth to a rare  mystical precision. 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush seems acutely conscious of the gap between the infinite potential
of  the dream and finite fancies of reality. There's a song later, called &quot;Never
be Mine&quot;,  where she's making an apparently anti-love statement sound like
love in bloom: &quot;I  want you as the dream, not the reality. It disturbed me
that in our times, even Kate  Bush - our last Bronte, our last Mishima - was
backing off from amour, but  gradually what the songs here demonstrate is that
she's neither a saucy-eyed dim  dewy damsel or a sceptical she-puma suffering
the first blasts of doubt. She  acknowledges both the successes and failures of
romantic idealism. The coda is &quot;This  Woman's Work&quot;. We're told this
was written for a John Hughes film. Tarkovsky  would be more fitting. When Kate
and her piano are singing with so much heaven in  their blood, the state of
music in 1989 is not a reference point. Her escape within is  so determined and
unqualified its infectious. And radiant with inflections. 
</P>
<P>Once every few years, the burning Bush completes a chapter in her work and
it's  like a visitation from a guardian angel. Like flowers are never really out
of vogue.  Like slow dancing with the lights out and the windows open. The Blue
Nile have a  challenger for the most impossibly beautiful music of the year, but
it's not a contest.  It's not even a year. Kate Bush is Kate Bush, and thank
Christ for that. She appeals  to the feral elemental child in every woman, and
if you think she only appeals to  every man for one reason then frankly, you
know nothing about anything and I  can't help you. The sensual world is a world
without end - let's get it on.

</P>
<P>Kate Bush, 31 (Foto), englische Pop-Saengerin mit einer Vorliebe fuer
diffizile  Musik, entschuldigte sich vorsorglich fuer moegliche historische
Missverstaendnisse.  Auf ihrer neuesten Platte &quot;The Sensual World&quot;
besingt sie in einem Titel &quot;Heads  we're Dancing&quot; eine im Jahre 1939
mit Adolf Hitler durchtanzte Nacht. Erst durch  ein Zeitungsfoto erfaehrt die
Nachtschwaermerin am anderen Morgen die wahre  Identitaet ihres Charmeurs. Kate
Bush ueber die ahnungslose Taenzerin: &quot;Die Frau  glaubt hernach, sie haette
ihn beeinflussen und den Lauf der Geschichte aendern  koennen, wenn sie ihn
erkannt haette. Doch sie braucht sich nichts vorzuwerfen.  Adolf Hitler hat eine
Menge Leute genarrt, und ich glaube nicht, dass man die  dafuer tadeln kann.&quot;
Zu ihrem Lied inspirierte sie ein Freund, der von einer  Begegnung mit einem
witzigen und belesenen Herrn erzaehlte; erst hinterher habe  er - erschrocken
und wuetend ueber das Zusammentreffen - erfahren, dass er sich  mit J. Robert
Oppenheimer unterhalten hatte - dem Vater der Atombombe. &quot;Der  Teufel&quot;,
singt Kate Bush, &quot;ist ein charmanter Herr.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Kate Bush, 31 (photo), English pop-singer with a fondness for complex music,
 precautiously excused herself vor possible historic misunderstandings. On her
latest  LP &quot;The Sensual World&quot; she celebrates in the song &quot;Heads
we're Dancing&quot; dancing  all night in 1939 with Adolf Hitler. Just through a
newspaper photo she learned the  true identity of her charmer. Kate Bush about
the innocent dancer: &quot;The woman  afterwards believes she might have been
able to influence him and change the  course of history, if she had recogniced
him. But she has nothing to accuse herself.  Adolf Hitler has fooled a lot of
