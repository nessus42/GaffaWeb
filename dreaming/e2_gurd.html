      <BR> From: katefans@world.std.com (Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago)
      <BR> Subject: Kate on Gurdjieff </P>
    
    <P>[re KaTe and Gurdjieff:] </P>
    
    <P>She's indicated in many interviews that she was never really a serious
      student of his. I have one radio interview made the day TD was released.
      Kate took live phone calls and she was asked about Gurdjieff. </P>
    
    <P>She says: &quot;Gurdjieff was an influence in that I read some of his
      books, really no more than that. I found a lot of what he said interesting
      and that's really as far as it goes&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The interviewer asks Kate to elaborate about who G is. </P>
    
    <P>Kate says &quot;Yes, well, Gurdjieff was, um, well he was considered a
      leader of a religious movement I think, but as far as I know he just had a
      lot of ideas about creating a way that would make people stronger and more
      together. And it's just a different way of doing it. And it was also
      trying to go for a more Western way of doing it, but I do know very little
      about it so I really wouldn't like to say very much because it's a subject
      that I feel, if I'm going to speak about, I should know what I'm talking
      about.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The interviewer asks the caller about his interest in G and he says that
      he was curious about Kate's mentioning him in a few of her songs. The
      interviewer says &quot;well,, the influence was minimal by the sound of it&quot;
      and Kate says &quot;yes, yes it was&quot; and laughs. I have this on
      audio, not transcript. To hear Kate actually saying the above is enough
      for me to believe that she did not &quot;follow&quot; Gurdjieff. </P>
    
    <P>Kate wrote &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and it's at least partially
      autobiographical. She loves to learn about lots of different things and
      incorporates bits and pieces of knowledge into her songs. My Kateness,
      just take a good, long and hard look at the cover of NFE. That's what it's
      all about! </P>
    
    <P>By the way, IMHO the &quot;G&quot; in the song &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;
      is David Gilmour, though I admit that I could be wrong. </P>

    <P>Okay, folks... here's the skinny on Kate and Gurdjieff, from a friend of
      a friend who seems to know (and who is not entirely comfortable with our
      prying): </P>
    
    <P>&gt; Kate, they tell me, is less deeply involved with the ideas and I
      even got the impression that she asked her brother to lay off &quot;evangelizing&quot;
      to her (if you've heard &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, it bears this out).
    </P>
    
    <P>I thought THP was an expression of reluctant gratitude...? </P>

    <P>From: Jorn Barger
      <BR> &gt; I thought THP was an expression of reluctant gratitude...? </P>
    
    <P>I think so, but I think it's gratitude for opening her mind up to the
      possibilities, not selling her on any particular philosophy. We went
      through a similar debate around last fall. Vickie objected to the tendency
      of people to assume that Kate is &quot;into&quot; everything she mentions
      in her music, Gurdjieff and Moon Cheese worship were mentioned
      specifically, in caps with exclamation marks. Some folks objected to this
      while I agreed with everything but the Moon Cheese part and provided some
      interview quotes that I felt supported that position. Finally, Vickie
      produced what I feel the to be a fairly definitive quote on Kate's
      feelings about Gurdjieff. </P>

    <P>So if your friend means that she &quot;is less deeply involved with the
      ideas&quot; than her brothers, yes, there's no question about that. If
      your friend has some reason to believe that Kate was actually irritated
      about her brother's &quot;evangelizing&quot; beyond his own impression of
      Them Heavy People I'd be fascinated to hear about it. </P>

      <BR> Subject: New age rag links guru, diva
      <BR> Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1991 19:46:50 -0700 </P>
    
    <P>Gnosis magazine #21, Fall 1991 (not really a rag). Letters column. </P>
    
    <P>NUDGES FROM KATE </P>
    
    <P>To the Editor: </P>
    
    <P>Your otherwise comprehensive Gurdjieff issue neglected to mention one
      valuable source of dissemination of information on Gurdjieff: the music of
      Kate Bush. </P>
    
    <P>Kate was apparently first exposed to the teachings of Gurdjieff through
      her two older brothers, and while she herself is not deeply involved in
      the Work (indeed she has often, in interviews and in her lyrics, admitted
      to her own 'laziness' and resistance to such things), she has sparked an
      interest in many of her fans which has led them to further explore the
      Gurdjieff material. </P>
    
    <P>Some examples of these references in her music include &quot;Them Heavy
      People,&quot; a song about the initial &quot;inconvenience&quot; and
      frequent discomfort of spiritual transformation, from her first album, &quot;The
      Kick Inside&quot;. In it she sings, &quot;They opened doorways that I
      thought were stuck for good/ They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu/ They build
      up my body/ Break me emotion-ally, it's nearly killing me/ But what a
      lovely feeling!&quot; </P>
    
    <P>The song &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot; talks about clairvoyance,
      prescience, and synchronicity: &quot;'G' arrives, funny, had a feeling he
      was on his way.&quot; And a third song on the album, &quot;Kite,&quot;
      begins with the line, &quot;Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o.&quot; In &quot;Fullhouse,&quot;
      from the &quot;Lionheart&quot; album, the refrain is &quot;remember
      yourself.&quot; (Kate also had this phrase stamped into the vinyl on
      British pressings of &quot;The Kick Inside.&quot;) </P>
    
    <P>Granted, these are all brief references that, taken alone, hardly shed
      any light on Gurdjieff or the Fourth Way. But they have served as an
      impetus for quite a few people to explore further on their own. Through
      her music and video images, Kate has also inspired many seekers to
      investigate such curious topics as Sufi dancing, Wilhelm Reich, the
      aboriginal Dreamtime, near-death experiences, the music of Frederick
      Delius, European witch-hunts, the writings of Emily Bronte, Henry James,
      and James Joyce. Any artist who can nudge her listeners into opening their
      hearts and minds, hopefully bettering themselves and their world, deserves
      recognition in GNOSIS. </P>
    
    <P>--Miriam Imblum, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania </P>
    
    <P>[Gurdjieff's central teaching was 'self-remembering'-- the theory that
      to attain spiritual growth you had to learn to notice when your thoughts
      were wandering blindly. One of his books was called &quot;Beelzebub's
      Tales to his Grandson&quot;. In &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;
      (the most popular introduction to G's thought), Ouspensky always refers to
      Gurjieff as &quot;G.&quot; &quot;The Fourth Way&quot; and &quot;the Work&quot;
      are names for the Gurdieff approach.] </P>

    <P>That's interesting--either &quot;Fullhouse&quot; was written before TKI
      was mastered or Kate was mindful of the phrase (and perhaps both, but
      almost certainly the latter.) Mike Weaver's brilliant &quot;Undercurrents&quot;
      essay in Break-Through #11 is the most authoritative writing I've read on
      Gurdjieffian influence in Kate's early lyrics. </P>
