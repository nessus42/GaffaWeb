      <BR> Subject: O-levels </P>
    
    <P>Someone asked what an O-level is; I haven't seen a reply so I'll give
      one -- trust that I know coz I've got a few of them (including music!) and
      a couple'a A-levels as well! </P>
    
    <P>The U of London gives a (yearly?) public exam called the General
      Certificate of Education Exam (GCE), of which there are the ordinary level
      (O) and advanced level (A), on a host of academic subjects including math,
      chemistry, economics, art, french etc etc. The O-level corresponds roughly
      to grades 10-11 in North America, and the A-level grades 12-13. To get
      into university in the UK (or most U's in the world, as a matter of fact)
      you need (at least) 2 A's and 3 O's. (and that's how many I have.) (no no,
      I didn't take it in the UK but in Hong Kong where I'm from) </P>

      <BR> Subject: 10 &quot;O&quot;-levels </P>
    
    <P>In his ridiculously huge article IED comments: </P>
    
    <P>&gt; In fact, Kate earned no fewer than 10 &quot;O&quot;-levels, which
      is an exceptionally good performance. </P>
    
    <P>I think IED's (lack of) knowledge of the British education system may be
      letting him down here. In the British Grammar schools of Kate's
      school-days a significant proportion of pupils would pass 9 or 10 `O'
      levels. It was common to take Maths or English (or both) a year early,
      then the usual 8 `O' levels in the final year (including an &quot;Alternative&quot;
      `O' level in the subject(s) already passed). So Kate may have 2 Maths and
      2 English `O' levels and 6 in other subjects. </P>
    
    <P>Without knowing the grades Kate obtained it is impossible to judge
      whether her results were indeed &quot;exceptional&quot; (IMHO 6 or more A
      grades out of the 10 would merit this description) or just &quot;reasonably
      good&quot; (a lot of C grades - the lowest &quot;pass&quot; grade). </P>
    
    <P>I have no wish to denigrate Kate's academic achievements, but IED's
      comment might lead some readers to believe she is some kind of
      super-genius in other areas beside her truly &quot;exceptional&quot;
      musical talents. I doubt if this is the case. </P>
    
    <P>IED, where did you find out Kate has 10 `O' levels? And do you know her
      grades? If so, please enlighten us further. </P>

    <P>I'm not an expert in the British educational system, either, but I do
      know that Kate left school at the age of 16 to pursue her music career.
      I've been led to believe that this number of O-levels at this age is at
      least a bit unusual, if not an indisputable sign of genius. I don't think
      anyone has maintained that Kate was a genius student --just a very
      competant one, which is also unusual for Rock Stars. </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
      <BR> Subject: O' levels </P>
    
    <P>&gt; I think IED's (lack of) knowledge of the British education system
      may be letting him down here. In the British Grammar schools of Kate's
      school-days a significant proportion of pupils would pass 9 or 10 `O'
      levels. </P>
    
    <P> IED hastens to admit that he is completely ignorant (or was before
      reading your much-appreciated posting, Geoff) about English school exams.
      But let him explain what he meant. First, the information that Kate &quot;received
      10 'O'-levels&quot; comes from Kate herself, on a British TV interview.
      Naturally, she did not volunteer this information, but was more or less
      forced to tell how many by her interviewer, who was pretty nosy. Kate
      would never brag. </P>
    
    <P>Secondly, IED assumed that the number &quot;10&quot; was a sign of &quot;exceptional&quot;
      achievement for two reasons: first, the interviewer (a Brit) went &quot;Ooh!&quot;
      and looked visibly impressed; and second, Peter FitzGerald-Morris of
      Homeground has also said that Kate's &quot;O&quot;-level performance was
      extremely good. </P>
    
    <P>But IED doesn't doubt the accuracy of your report. Perhaps the reason
      for this conflict of information is that Kate left school before ever
      taking her final year. In other words, she took all of her &quot;O&quot;s
      a year before most people would have taken more than two--according to
      your own report as IED understood it. Now, even if her grades on those
      exams weren't particularly high, wouldn't such an early completion of 10 &quot;O&quot;s
      be pretty exceptional? </P>
    
    <P>If not, IED would like to know, so he can emend his statement in the
      chronology. And thanks again for all your info. </P>

      <BR> Subject: Kate's 'O'-level </P>
    
    <P> Since the subject has come up in Love-Hounds, IED has taken the liberty
      of reproducing a recent exchange of letters between Geoff and IED
      concerning Kate's secondary education. Many thanks to both Geoff and Neil
      for their explanations--especially Geoff, for his patience. </P>

    <P>Wow! Amazing! (Translation: Yes, that is exceptional) </P>
    
    <P>--------------- </P>
    
    <P> From: Andrew Marvick </P>
    
    <P>I'm happy to learn that the O-level business wasn't an exaggeration of
      Kate's achievement, though one can look at it either way. After all, she
      did leave school before ever taking her 'A'-levels, which would have been
      a wise thing to do just for general living purposes, no? By the way, she
      returned to school during the summer before the last year (the year she
      skipped) in order to take &quot;mock-'A'-levels&quot;. Unfortunately, no
      one has ever divulged what her scores were in any of these exams (not, of
      course, that it's any of my business!) </P>
    
    <P>-- Andy </P>
    
    <P>--------------- </P>
    
    <P> From: Geoff Clare </P>
    
    <P> This doesn't sound right at all. &quot;Mocks&quot; were taken in
      February/March in preparation for the real exams in June. Also 'A'-levels
      were taken two years after 'O'-levels, whereas &quot;the summer before the
      year she skipped&quot; would be immediately after she took her 'O'-levels.
      There's nothing I can think of that she might have gone back for at that
      time. Is this from an interview with Kate or just a bit of hearsay? </P>
    
    <P>-- Geoff. </P>
    
    <P>------------- </P>
    
    <P>From: Andrew Marvick </P>
    
    <P>Oh, it's not hearsay. As a matter of fact, I just watched the interview
      again last night. It's from the 1980 programme Nationwide (BBC). Kate is
      being interviewed, and explains that she had originally thought of
      becoming a veterinarian or psychiatrist, and so had gone through the
      motions. </P>
    
    <P> &quot;I got some 'O'-levels, and--&quot; </P>
    
    <P>Oh? How many? </P>
    
    <P>&quot;(With evident embarassment)...Ten...&quot; </P>
    
    <P>(With obvious surprise and respect) Ten! Did you take your 'A'-levels?
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Well, I took my 'mock-A's...&quot; </P>
    
    <P> I don't remember where the earliest source is about Kate's leaving
      before the &quot;last&quot; year of secondary school, but I've read it in
      three or four different places. I'm pretty sure it's been admitted to by
      Kate herself in a number of places. It's implied in the letter to Frances
      Byrne that appeared in the new Juby book. She entered the first form in
      1969, and left in 1975, I believe--that would have been the sixth form. Is
      that the last of your school-years, or isn't there a seventh? </P>
    
    <P>Given these bits of information, can you come up with a likely
      chronology for me? I'd really like to understand this better. Thanks for
      your interest, Geoff. </P>
    
    <P>-- Andy </P>
    
    <P>--------------- </P>
    
    <P>From: Geoff Clare </P>
    
    <P>Ah, now the picture is getting much clearer - the dates give it all
      away. First a little background. </P>
    
    <P>Secondary school consists of five years, normally from age 11 to 16. It
      is possible to leave before completing the five years, once the age of 16
      has been reached. 'O'-levels were normally taken at the end of the fifth
      year (one or two might be taken in the fourth as I said before), after
      which the student could continue to &quot;sixth form&quot; to study for
      'A'-levels. The &quot;sixth form&quot; is considered separate from &quot;secondary
      school&quot; (it can equally well be part of the same school or a separate
      &quot;sixth form college&quot;) and actually consists of two years -&quot;lower
      sixth&quot; and &quot;upper sixth&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>(Apologies for the strange mixture of tenses here - this is because
      'O'-levels have now been replaced by the GCSE, so I have to refer to them
      in the past tense, whereas the other information is still true,
      necessitating the present tense). </P>
    
    <P>So now it becomes clear that Kate dropped out of the sixth form, as
      opposed to &quot;before the last year of secondary school&quot; which
      really means before the fifth form. She stayed long enough to take her
      mock 'A'-levels, but left before taking the real ones. </P>
    
    <P>Which brings us back to square one - she probably took one or two
      'O'-levels in the fourth form and the remainder of the 10 in the fifth
      form, just like a large number of people at the same school and similar
      schools all over the country. So I'm afraid my original comment still
      stands: I doubt if Kate's 'O'-level results qualify as &quot;exceptional&quot;.
      Now if we could just find out her grades .... </P>
    
    <P>-- Geoff. </P>
    
    <P>------------------ </P>
    
    <P>From: IED </P>
    
    <P> Thanks for all the clarifying information, Geoff. I'm sure you've hit
      on the explanation. My only reason for not being absolutely convinced is
      the attitude that the British interviewer--as well as Kate's visible sign
      of embarassment, apparently at the high number of 'O's--at the number
      '10'. They both seemed to agree that it was somehow exceptional. Could it
      all have been harder in 1973-4 than it is now? Or were Kate and the
      interviewer simply deceiving themselves into thinking it was more
      impressive than it really was? </P>
    
    <P>I promise this is the last time I'll bother you about this nonsense, but
      it is interesting. I didn't know anything about the sixth vs. fifth forms,
      etc. </P>
    
    <P>-- Andy </P>
    
    <P>-------------- </P>
    
    <P> From: Geoff Clare </P>
    
    <P> It seems to me that our difference of opinion arises purely from the
      use of the word &quot;exceptional&quot;. I'm not saying 10 'O'-levels
      isn't an achievment worthy of the interviewer's evident respect - I just
      think calling it &quot;exceptional&quot; is a bit over the top. </P>
    
    <P>Perhaps some ball-park figures will help illustrate what I mean. For
      something to be called &quot;exceptional&quot; I would say it might occur
      with a frequency no higher than, say, 1 in 1000. Judging from the results
      at my school and the relative numbers of that type of school (&quot;Grammar&quot;)
      to the other types (&quot;Secondary Modern&quot; and &quot;Comprehensive&quot;),
      I would estimate the number of people with 10 'O'-levels lies around the 1
      in 50 mark. If you still want to call that &quot;exceptional&quot; I won't
      argue, but I would only call it &quot;extremely good&quot; or &quot;well
      above average&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Educational standards have certainly changed in this country over the
      last few decades, but they wouldn't have changed much in the short time
      between 1974 and 1980. </P>
    
    <P>-- Geoff </P>

      <BR> Subject: British Education system </P>
    
    <P>A &quot;form&quot; is merely a class or year (i.e. group of children of
      c. the same age) within the school. So it could be form 1, form 2 etc. or
      form A form B etc representing different classes or age groups throughout
      the school. In Kate's case it refers to her Secondary School (sometimes
      known as High Schools) though Primary Schools can be divided into forms as
      well. Some schools, like mine, confused the issue by starting with the 2nd
      form and continuing: 3rd, 4th, Removes, 5th, Lower 6th and Upper 6th
      (pretentious, moi?). </P>
    
    <P>O Levels are Ordinary Level GCE Exams (General Certificate of Education)
      and A Levels are Advanced Level GCE Exams. The former where taken at the
      age of c. 16 and the latter at c. 18 and it was the results of these which
      usually determined whether you could go on to read a subject at
      university. There are probably new variations on this theme these days. 10
      O Levels is good though it really depends on the grades Kate got and what
      the subjects are. You could do O Levels in Art, RI, Cooking, Woodwork etc
      (no offence intended :-) ). </P>

    <P>'O' levels or ordinary levels are exams taken by many schoolchildren at
      the age of 16 (or thereabouts). Asking the half a dozen or so people sat
      around me, the general concensus is that only approximately 20% of
      children succeed in getting any O levels at all. The average 'A level'
      student (i.e. ages 17-18) has to first pass five or more 'O levels'. Three
      (usually) A levels are required for entry to University (aprrox 1% of
      population get to this). By this scale, if Kate does indeed have 10 O
      levels that puts her in the top percent or two based on exam performance.
      She clearly could have gone on to A levels and presumably from there to
      University. Luckily for us she had something else to do :-) (BTW, O levels
      no longer exist, they have been replaced by GCSE's, but I won't go into
      that). </P>

      <BR> Subject: O LEVELS !! </P>
    
    <P>I think I will settle this once and for all: </P>
    
    <P>O-Levels are taken at 16 in State and Public Schools in England. 8 are
      the usual maximum at state schools, and 10 at public schools (ie Kate).
      Therefore if your family has money your more likely to get more. O-Levels
      are graded A to E, grades D and E are regarded as failures. Generally E
      (30-40%), D (40-50%), C (50-65%), B (65-75%), A (75%--&gt;) CSE's are the
      alternate exams , they are graded 1 to 6, where 1 equates to a grade C at
      O-Level, 2 to grade D, 3 to grade E, 4, 5, 6 as ungraded O-Level. For
      interest CSE grade 4 is the national average grade obtained, so Kate is
      well above your Mr/Miss average. </P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately the O-Level was phased out after 1987, my year were the
      last to do O-Levels ( I managed 9 O-Levels myself). </P>
    
    <P>It has now been replaced by the GCSE exam which is a combination of the
      O-Level and the CSE, it is generally regarded as inferior to the former
      exams. At 18 usually A-Levels are taken, you need these to get into
      Polytechnic and University. It is 2 for Poly and 3 for Uni. They usually
      will ask that you have at least 5 subjects covered by both O-Level and
      A-Level. For example 3 O-Levels in French, English, Physics and 2 A-levels
      in Maths and Chemistry ( they usually expect that you passed these at
      O-Level as well) could get you onto a Maths Degree at a Polytechnic, an
      extra A-Level could get you into Uni. Obviously the quality of your grades
      are important, you would need 3 grade A's at A-Level in the right subjects
      to be even considered for Medical school. </P>
    
    <P>I hope this settles any queries about the education system in the UK, by
      the way Scott was right that Scotland does a different exam to the
      O-Level. O-Levels were only done in England and Wales. Andy Semple </P>

      <BR> Subject: Re: Kate's intelligence (measurable) </P>
    
    <P>According to an interview in the &quot;Kate Bush On Tour&quot; show
      (recently posted by Ron, thanks Ron). Kate got 10 O-levels and took her &quot;mock
      A's&quot; before leaving school but never got any regular A-levels. </P>
    
    <P>I assume that &quot;mock A's&quot; are some sort of practice exam taken
      to prepare for the regular A-levels. Whether it could be said that she got
      four of these &quot;mock A's&quot; I don't know. </P>
    
    <P>Considering that she had thought of becoming a vet or a phyciatrist it
      would make sense (from what our international correspondents have told us)
      that she would take a large number of Os and then prepare for her A-levels
      with about four &quot;mock As&quot;. </P>
    
    <P>Strange thought. Another time. Another place. Kate (or is it Cathy) Bush
      sits quietly completing her O-Level exam. Does she have the faintest idea
      that fifteen years later devout fans all over the world will be talking
      about how well she did? </P>
    
    <P>Was Rod Serling standing in the room at the time? </P>

      <BR> From: IED0DXM%MVS.OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
      <BR> Subject: O-levels </P>
    
    <P>By the way, Kate never said any such thing about passing 4 A-Levels, or
      any A-levels at all. She did pass 10 O-levels, and that's all. She also
      took her &quot;mock A-level exams&quot;, for which she returned to school
      for a day, after having dropped out. That's all any of us know. IED was
      under the impression that merely &quot;passing&quot; O-levels doesn't
      really indicate the braininess of the student--that it also matters what
      the individual scores were for each exam. Is that not so? On the other
      hand, passing 10 is unusual enough to indicate superior academic
      potential. </P>
    
    <P>Obviously, IED does not agree that discussion of Kate Bush's school
      history is irrelevant or uninteresting, nor does he think the subject has
      yet been exhausted, since we have not yet arrived at the facts. It's all a
      part of The Whole Story. </P>
    
    <P>-- Andrew Marvick, who wants to be a scholar, but he really can't be
      bothered... </P>
