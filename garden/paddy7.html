<P>[Here is the seventh of Paddy's articles for the KBC Newsletter. It appeared
in issue number twelve (spring/summer 1982).]

<H3>Pad's Dreaming </H3>
<P>Somewhere in a fashionable recording studio I sit in a large sound-proof
overdub booth. I am wearing headphones and am surrounded by big fat microphones
supported by greasy metal dinosaur-type stands, thin long pencil-mikes in
shock-proof mounts suspended in Gaffa. There's a couple of flat, square
pressure-zone mikes stuck on a piece of glass between me and the control-room.
I've just finished whirling a ruler on a piece of string round and round my
head. I have been whirling for over an hour, and have a blister...please save
your sympathy for the following overdub. 
</P>
<P>Through this microphonic garden I can see two or three weirdos. They are sat
in the control-room, and the prettiest is in control. They are wearing silly
hats--there are corks dangling from their brims. I see a finger on the talk-back
button: &quot;Next overdub please.&quot; The tape-op, our equivalent of Spock of
Starship Enterprise, enters the booth and reposts a few microflowers to a new
position. I'm putting on my white gloves and just a couple of items of everday
overdub protective clothing. &quot;You ready yet?&quot; squeaks a voice from a
set of headphones on the floor. There are at least forty-five pairs of cans
heaped in a pile. One of them squeaked, &quot;Are you ready?&quot; I've
forgotten which are mine... 
</P>
<P> Later, the red warning light is turned on. This is an indication that all
systems are go. Spock energises. Noise reduction is go, foldback is go. Our
controller is counting down in multiples of four. Multitrack is go, gulp
thump-thump thump-thump. &quot;Stand by, studio&quot; echoes through the hull of
the entire ship. 
</P>
<P> The headset that was lost and found is now an integral extension of my
cerebral function, cosmically one with the system. The sky forms its lips into a
kiss and blows down a very long tube. I can hear a car. Its brakes are
screeching... I open the cage door and grab the nearest kangaroo by the ruff and
hurtle it some 14 1/2 feet into a slightly dented 200-gallon water cistern...
blang! 
</P>
<P> Suddenly it goes quiet. Then a voice says &quot;Yeah...but could you make
it go more like dang?&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;Er...dang?&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;Yeah, you know, dang, like kangaroo only with a 'd' instead of a 'k'
and forget the 'aroo'.&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;OK...Dang.&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;You could try holding the next one by the tail.&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;OK...Dang?&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;Yeah. Oh, we thought we'd like to change the mikes for this one, so
take your cans off...Don't put them there!&quot; 
</P>
<P> Tube, tyres, 1-2-3-4, dang... I'm awake. I'd dropped off to sleep in the
heat of the studio lights. I'm buried in sand. It's warm and smelly. They've
painted it to make it look good. We're making a video. A voice is saying, &quot;Now
what exactly do you want the camera to see in this shot, Kate?&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;Well..d's going to be a rock, and the rock's going to speak, OK?&quot;

</P>
<P> A voice by my ear says, &quot;We're just going to bury your head, mate, all
right?&quot; 
</P>
<P> Sounds of a shovel. They bury my head. It goes very quiet. I can just about
hear Kate and the director saying things like, &quot;We could start at his feet
and work up towards his head, or...we could pan from this rather pretty little
scene here, or how about...&quot; etc., etc. 
</P>
<P> It's even warmer now. They seem to be having lots of ideas about this
scene. That's nice. 
</P>
<P> &quot;...on the other hand, we could do a cross-fade and just zoom in...&quot;

</P>
<P> Oh, well, today I'm a rock, and a speaking rock at that. I suppose I could
say something like &quot;Excuse me, old chap, but do you realise I'm buried?&quot;
but I'm sure it would spoil the effect. 
</P>
<P> &quot;OK, everybody, we'll go for a take. You asleep, Pad?&quot; 
</P>
<P> Beneath the sands of the Bathurst Islands I lay waiting for the third
orchestral beat that cues this rock to speak at the end of The Dreaming. The
first comes with a dijeridu hoot, the second comes with birds, and on the third
I speak. I'm buried. The cameras roll. The Dreaming begins. 
</P>
<P> I'm a soldier in an English forest. Sunlight mingles with smoke. Shafts as
bright as supertroupers illuminate an army of musicians asleep on a film
set...The next time they would be holding their breath waiting for their cue
beneath a lake. They were supposed to be totally submerged, but they kept
bobbing up and down. Never mind, put them in minotaur costumes with rings
through their noses and they can beat on the ground with sticks...Oh, and can
you make a sound like a mule? You know, &quot;hee-haw&quot;, only deeper... 
</P>
<P> One--There's a hoot. 
</P>
<P> Two--I can hear birds. 
</P>
<P> Three--Two...Three...Four and a half...The rock speaks.  
</P>
