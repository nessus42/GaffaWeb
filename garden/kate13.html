<H3>Tansa's Guitar</H3>
<P>Weston was going on his winter tour and needed some focal point to make the
tour more complete and relevant. He had recently bought a guitar at an auction
in New York. The guitar had been beautifully made in California by a small
company with a reputation among the leading rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
The guitar had a strange history, and was meant to have passed through the hands
of a number of guitar heroes at the end of the sixties and early seventies.
There was no documentation with the instrument to indicate who had owned it over
the years, but the original bill showing that it was bought from Tansa of
California had come with the instrument. 
</P>
<P>Weston hoped that he could use this instrument as an extra dynamic in his
act. For a moment he remembered how the auctioneer had held the guitar by its
neck, looking as though he was acknowledging the roars of a crowd at the end of
a concert, with the handmade gold machine-heads on the instrument suddenly
reflecting the lighting of the auction rooms. Weston had known instinctively as
a professional musician that his excitement at seeing the guitar was nothing to
do with the external appearance of the instrument. It was something deeper,
almost like seeing a beautiful girl in a crowded place and then seeing her eyes
turning to meet his, and not turning away. 
</P>
<P>There was a great deal of carving on the instrument, not unlike the sort of
tooling and decoration that used to be found on muskets. The instrument was
heavy, but Weston liked a heavy guitar, liked to feel its weight pulling down on
his neck and centering in his stomach. With that sort of stability, his hands
could flit around the neck and body of the instrument like white spiders. 
</P>
<P>When the rehearsals for his tour began, Weston realised that the guitar was
no ordinary instrument. At first it wouldn't work at all. He felt clumsy, he
felt as though he'd only been playing guitars for a couple of years, he felt as
though his bones and muscles were reacting to the cold winter air like thick
oil. But after a couple of hours the instrument began to sing, and by the end of
the rehearsal session Weston was feeling good. When he had finished, he handed
the guitar to his roadie. The roadie made it quite clear that although he
thought the instrument very beautiful it was, in his terms, a &quot;weird axe&quot;,
and Weston would be better off leaving it alone. Weston laught this off--if the
guitar had any sinister connections, he was going to blow them to pieces with
his playing. 
</P>
<P>As he was getting ready for the first gig of the tour a message came through
that Tansa of California were phoning from America, saying that Weston owed them
for a guitar he had recently purchased at an auction. This puzzled Weston, as he
had personally handed over the money to the auctioneer, but he had no time for
these sort of problems, with only half an hour to go. As he warmed up in his
dressing room the instrument responded well and Weston felt that the night was
going to go in a positive direction. But when he got out under the lights in
front of the audience and roars of appreciation had quietened down, he began to
feel that same thick, oil-sump movement in his hands. He asked the management to
put up the heating on the stage during the act. But things didn't get very much
better, and by the interval he had changed his guitar and was back on one of his
standard favourite instruments. When the second half ended, he pulled the place
together and during his last number the audience had begun to dance at the back.

</P>
<P>On the second gig, a similar situation occurred. With only a few minutes
left before going on stage a message came through that Tansa wanted to talk to
him about payment for a guitar. And again, when he went on to the stage the same
thing happened: he couldn't make the instrument function properly. 
</P>
<P>It was during one of these moments, when he was on the verge of deciding
whether to try a particularly tricky solo on the instrument, that he noticed a
man sitting in the front row of the audience, clearly lit up by the stage
lighting. This man was looking at him with something more than just the
expression of a fan lost in a dream of appreciation. He was definitely trying to
catch Weston's eye, and it wasn't to indicate to him that liked what he was
doing. 
</P>
<P>Again he had to change over to another guitar for the second half, and again
the gig took off as soon as he'd made the switch. Afterwards in the dressing
room, he was told that there was somebody at the back stage entrance demanding
that he see Weston about payment for the guitar. Weston dismissed it; but as
they were driving away from the gig, and as usual many faces pushed themselves
against the window of the car to look at Weston, staring into the back seat
through the warm glass of the window was the face he'd seen in the front of the
audience. The man was shouting something at him and he appeared angry. Weston
gave instructions to the driver to go faster, and they cleared the crowd without
any mishap. 
</P>
<P>By now the rest of the band were quite familiar with the weird,
unpredictable playing of their front-man and were trying to persuade him to
leave the instrument alone. Weston, however, took it on stage on the third gig,
and after the first hour of the first half, having been unable to make the
instrument sing and soar, he flung it across the stage, where it smashed into a
stack of amplifiers and fell to the ground, with the whole of the back-plate
coming apart and tinkling on the wooden stage floor. He picked up one of his
other guitars, but the anger and frustration that had caused him to sling
Tansa's instrument away from him seemed to have affected his guitar playing, and
the concert was not a success. 
</P>
<P>This gig was in London, and by the time they'd finished and were coming down
backstage, Weston could hear a strange silence through the dressing room
windows, and he knew immediately that the whole of the city was encased in snow.
Depressed and puzzled, he got ready to make a run for the car. As he was doing
this, his guitar-roadie came in with the broken instrument, pointing out that
there was no real damage and that it was nothing he couldn't sort out in a
couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>Weston wanted to get back to his bed and sleep, so he went with the roadie
in the crew van. As they were pulling away from the theatre down a narrow alley,
a man came running out of a shop doorway, and immediately Weston recognised him
as the man who'd been watching him from the audience. The roadie pointed out to
him that it was the same man who'd been hanging around the stage door saying he
was from Tansa and needed payment. 
</P>
<P>As they accelerated away, the man ran faster and faster, and although the
vehicle was quite easily doing in excess of 40 mph on the wet and sludgy road,
the man was still gaining on them. They could hear him shouting that he'd come
for payment, that payment was needed and that until Weston had made the payment
he would never be able to play the guitar in fron of an audience. The people
inside the van were beginning to panic now, as on a straight run up a deserted
and quite Oxford Street they hit 55, almost 60 mph--but the man was still
gaining. 
</P>
<P>The roadie suddenly kicked open the back door of the vehicle and slung the
guitar out into the snow towards the running man. He slammed the door and they
skidded round the corner and were away. The last Weston saw of the guitar was
the man gently picking it up out of the sludge, talking to himself--or to the
instrument. Then a shop window full of Christmas decorations blocked his view.
Weston didn't feel angry, but still he wanted to know what the hell his roadie
meant by throwing his best guitar out of the back of the van. The roadie, who
was quite shaken and upset, took a piece of paper from out of his pocket. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I found this stuck inside the back of the guitar.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It was a bill from Tansa, and written on it were the words: 
</P>
<P>&quot;One handmade custom guitar--material and sundries:  $2000.00.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Special effects for enchanting &amp; capturing the minds of audiences,
our fee:  One soul.&quot;
