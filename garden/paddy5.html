    <H3>Big Noises from Moving Air</H3>
    
    <P>When it's late at night like this, and most people have drifted off to
      sleep at the quiet end of the day, you would find our house an exception.
      Upstairs I can hear Kate at work on her latest masterpiece; from another
      direction tribal drumming throbs consistently; and if one places one's ear
      to the floor one can hear Celtic monks singing to bagpipe
      accompaniment...These night hours are filled with music. My flat is no
      exception. I sit amongst a litter of sound-making gadgets and instruments,
      scratching away at this little article and taking a brief pause to listen
      to what is going on all around me. I've been banging my head on the floor,
      just to add to all the noise, trying to come up with some new sounds for
      this wonderful album that Kate is cooking up for us all. You must have
      liked Sat In Your Lap. When I first heard it in demo form I thought it was
      incredible. I couldn't get it out of my mind for weeks. Everywhere I went
      I could hear it playing inside me almost like a backing-track to everyday
      life; in short, I liked it from the word go. </P>
    
    <P> Now I've been doing some musical experiments based on the ultra-simple
      principle that all sound is just air moving and if you want to make a
      noise just move the air. There are many machines doing exactly this. They
      all excite the air in their own characteristic way, from a football
      whistle to the sound of a jet air-liner as it pushes itself through the
      sky. How does this tie in with Kate's arrangement for the single--all
      those trumpets, backing-vocals and pounding jungle drums? Well, we tried a
      very simple idea that acutally seemed to add something exciting and unique
      to the track. </P>
    
    <P> Preston [Heyman, a drummer on The Dreaming LP] and I stood in the &quot;live&quot;
      room of a famous recording studio somewhere in London with our hands
      wrapped in bandages. We were positioned opposite each other about ten feet
      apart with a pair of microphones right in between us. We each held two
      four-foot bamboo canes like giant drumsticks but instead of hitting a drum
      or a percussion instrument, the idea was just to beat out rhythms in the
      air in time to the song. And sure enough, after an hour or so of
      thrashing, and several blisters later, we got a pretty new sound. It made
      us all want to dance about frantically. In fact, Preston did. But what
      next? There are lots more numbers on this new album and they're all as
      good as Sat In Your Lap! Perhaps there is a place for a dijeridu, an
      Armadillo charanga, perhaps a Polynesian stamping-pit, or an Oceanic bull
      roarer, possibly a singing bowl...or how about some plain old Thracian
      double-aulos? </P>
    
    <P> The world of devices that move air into music is vast and much of the
      territory is uncharted. This is an age where complex and sophisticated
      music technology can stand next to ethnic instruments from the dawn of
      time, when a ruler with a piece of string tied to it can share the same
      analogue co-ordinates as a rock band and computer synthesisers. This
      cultural blend was once called fusion--Kate's new material feels more
      vital, like a transfusion. This album is going to be the best one yet, and
      it won't be long before you hear it for yourselves. </P>
