<P>[Here is Kate's article for the thirteenth issue (summer 1983).] 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>It's been a long time since our last issue, and I must apologise for the
long absence, but due to lack of activities, there has really been very little
to tell you about.
</P>
<P>
Last year, after the album was finished, I decided to promote it as fully as
possible. When you've spent nearly a year making an album, you can't let it go
out into the world without helping it. In fact, the business has certainly
changed in the last couple of years. Everyone has to work much harder, and with
an absence of two years from the public eye, I had to show my face again, to
prove I was still alive. I did lots and lots of press--I haven't done so much
since the first album. It was refreshing to find that the majority of
journalists actually really appreciated and understood the album, but I had to
explain time and time again that the album hadn't taken two years to make! [I
suppose that in 1989, when KBVI is finally released, she will have to explain
time and time again that the album hadn't taken four years to make! ] 
</P>
<P>I also did some TVs in England and Europe, with two dancers: Gary, who you
all know, and Dougie, a dancer I had met years ago when he was working in
Lindsay Kemp's company. 
</P>
<P>We worked in Italy and Germany, and the response was wonderful. It was
interesting that as we worked more and more on the routine, The Dreaming, it
became tighter and tighter, and little bits were added here and there, until it
was so much better than the video that I wished we had had made the video after
the TVs. 
</P>
<P>It was a very interesting trip--we went to Rome, and as Lindsay Kemp was
visiting at the time, we got a chance to see Lindsay, and we had a lovely
evening. He cooked us a meal, and after we were so full that we could hardly
move, he got out boxes of his old photos and we fingered each one with magical
memories: shots of Flowers from The Collegiate Theatre, the first time I saw
Lindsay perform. Lindsay dressed as Mr. Punch, leaping for joy. I remember the
theatre being full of adults rather than children, and all of us shouting &quot;Look
behind you!&quot; and &quot;Oh, no, you don't!&quot; Adults transported to
childhood in a matter of moments--but that's the craft of Lindsay's magic. 
</P>
<P>Fond memories spread across the floor--the passionate and dramatic,
Lindsay's shows in photo form. We carefully put them all back in their boxes, a
farewell dance and a big kiss goodbye. 
</P>
<P>There is a fountain in Rome where you can make a wish and throw a coin--a
very magical place [the Trevi Fountains]: marble horses, pulling themselves from
marble waves, being driven by a marble Neptune. They say the wishes come true.
I've yet to see. And there's a hotel in Rome where we stayed, and on the night
we arrived, there was a diplomatic meeting on a higher floor. The hotel was full
of young soldiers--boys with guns just in case of any trouble. It was a very sad
sight. 
</P>
<P>I had to rehearse my number in my room, and not having a European plug, I
took the old one off and began to stick the bare wires into the plug socket,
which was hidden behind the table. All the lights went out in the room, so I ran
into the hall--no lights. I was half expecting to see soldiers cocking their
rifles, having traced the source of the light failure. I went into my room, and
a few minutes later the lights came back on. Gary and Dougie came up later, and
when I told them they started laughing--apparently the whole hotel had blacked
out, and the soldiers in reception had been a little on edge, to say the least.
So I won't do that again, and I recommend calling reception to see if they'll
help you out if you ever find yourself with two bare wires in a foreign hotel! 
</P>
<P>We travelled to Milan, and then to a place near Venice, where they were
holding the Venice Festival. We performed The Dreaming. The festival is held in
a theatre with an audience of a few hundred, and goes out on TV at the same
time, so it was a live event, but performed to pre-recorded backing tracks. The
Italian audiences are absolutely wonderful, they adore anything to do with art
and applaud quite spontaneously if they like something. Each time they liked a
step in the routine there would be a ripple of applause, and it was quite hard
to keep going without badly needing to smile because it was such a lovely
feeling. 
</P>
<P>The video The Dreaming had been made in between press and radio and the trip
abroad, and we were very lucky to be able to do all the shooting in one day. It
was an extremely ambitious shoot, which included live birds, lasers, flying
wires, people being buried completely under sand, not to mention a beautiful set
which was built of polystyrene rocks, dead spikey trees and a cardboard moon and
sun.
</P>
<P>
As the hours rolled on, we were sure we would have to leave at least one idea
out, but with a crew who were just as eager as us to see the film complete and
as it should be, we worked on into the night--past the rope made of laser light
and the painted men who walked out of trees to a mouth moving in the sand (all
we can see of a man deep under the sand; somehow it looks remarkably like Paddy,
and it's the last shot in our video). 
</P>
<P>Within two months we had done Europe, P.A.s and two other videos. I have
never made so many videos in such a short space of time, but there was too much
to do, so no more time could be spent on them. A video of There Goes a Tenner
was made to promote a single in this country, and a video of Suspended in Gaffa
was made for the single release in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>As we all know, There Goes a Tenner bombed in this country, with no airplay
and a handful of the worst (and funniest) reviews I've read. The video was not
shown at all, but a compilation video called Kate Bush: The Single File is due
out some time soon, so keep your eyes open for an official release date in the
music papers. Perhaps then you could get a chance to see it, along with all the
others. There Goes a Tenner was set in a derelict old room where there was a big
safe. There are five of us in the gang, and you might just recognise two of the
faces belonging to two of my favourite musicians in the band! 
</P>
<P>Although the single in this country did not do well, it is nice to know that
in Europe, Suspended in Gaffa has been quite warmly received. 
</P>
<P>The video of Suspended in Gaffa was to be done as simply and quickly as
possible; as always with very little time to complete it in, the simpler the
better. 
</P>
<P>I saw it as being the return to simplicity, a light-hearted dance routine,
no extras, no complicated special effects. [In fact, however, there are many
very sophisticated and subtle technical effects in this video, and the
production design is very impressive.] As we were all so pleased with the
previous sets--put together under the supervision of a very clever man, Steve
Hopkins--we asked him to build another, this time an old barn with large gaps in
the walls where we could allow the light to streak through. We used a
combination of natural and artificial light, and everyone was thrilled with the
sense of realism that the set achieved. Steve brought in huge branches of trees
that were behind the gaps in the set, and a dedicated helper called &quot;Podge&quot;
sat up on a piece of scaffolding for six hours and enthusiastically shook a
piece of tree to make the light move and dance as if motivated by a furtive
wind. The video did remain uncomplicated--just a few effects and just one extra:
but a very special. one. There is one section where a child's voice says, &quot;Mother,
where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes.&quot; And there was only one
person that could be addressed to--my mother. 
</P>
<P>When I asked her to appear in the section, contrary to my concern about her
nerves, she was more than obliging and said, &quot;Yes.&quot; She was definitely
the star of the day, and waited patiently hour after hour as we slowly moved
through the bulk of the shooting to eventually reach her debut. I was amazed at
her grace and stamina: as all of us began to wane and wilt, my mother continued
to blossom and glow, and her only worries were getting back home in time to get
dinner and hoping she would not succumb to an attack of giggles during the vital
moments of being on screen. 
</P>
<P>She needn't have worried, for she is a natural professional, a real star and
my favourite mum. (You can see us together in action on the back page.) 
</P>
<P>Besides all the promotional activities, because of the decision to release
another single, a 'b-side' had to be written. It is always this way for me: even
if things are carefully planned, things always happen at once--and in a big way.
I've always loved the idea of singing in a foreign language, and I thought this
b-side would be a perfect excuse for doing so. 
</P>
<P>Really the only language I know enough of to be able to work creatively with
is French, so I thought of all the odd words I know, and tried to piece a story
together. It's surprising how inspiring it can be to work from a slightly
different tangent. 
</P>
<P>The tune came straight away, and I filled in all the lines that I had no
proper words for with pseudo-French sounds. Luckily Patrick, who worked on
Lionheart with us in Superbear [Studios, in France] was staying with Paddy to
work on some tracks, so, between him and a friend Vivienne, we worked out the
complete lyrics, and Ne T'enfuis pas was put to tape. 
</P>
<P>Just one more trip abroad, to Paris and Germany to promote Suspended in
Gaffa, and that was nearly the end of the promo, and the year. 
</P>
<P>I had a wonderful Christmas, very quiet--a nice end to a very busy year.
This year has been very positive so far. It doesn't have the same air of doom
that '81 and '82 seemed to hold--I hope it's the same for all of you. 
</P>
<P>I'd like to take this opportunity to say a big thankyou with a hug and a
kiss for all of you who sent the beautiful Christmas presents and cards. I'm
afraid I can't thank you all personally, but they're very much appreciated. It's
incredible that so many of you should think of me when there's always so many
people to think of at Christmas. Also, thank you to all of you for the feedback
on the album. I've had so many letters saying that you really like it. It's
wonderful that you are all so open enough to try to understand it. It means a
lot to me that it's got through to the people that matter. 
</P>
<P>It was also really good to see those of you that made it to the P.A.s again.
Your feedback on the album was so positive--I really needed it then, it had only
just been released and it certainly helped to ease my anxiety a little. 
</P>
<P>Already that seems such a long time ago--last year, all over. I was really
hoping to put a show together this year, but it just seems impossible yet again.
Will it ever happen, I wonder? Yes, but when? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>The problem is that if I don't make an album this year, there will be at
least another two-year gap before another one, and the way that business and
politics are, it would be a negative situation. [We can all be grateful now that
Kate resisted the &quot;business and politics&quot; enough to take two full
years, after writing this letter, to complete Hounds of Love. ] So here I am
writing away, or trying to write--determined to get a new album together. If
only time would slow down a little for me, I could do it all and go away on
holiday! 
</P>
<P>I seem to have hit another quiet period. I intend just to keep on writing
for this first part of the year, so yet again I slip away from the eyeball of
the media to my home. [Actually, Kate was busy moving to a new home outside the
city during this period.] 
</P>
<P>It's almost impossible for us to put an interesting newsletter together
while all my energies are channelled into the creative side of making an album,
and so, if you can bear with us for a while, we will only be issuing a magazine
when we have enough information and pictures to fill it, and will probably not
be able to bring a quarterly issue this year, but hope that our part-colour
issues will make up for this. 
</P>
<P>Thank you for being so patient. 
</P>
<P>Thanks for all the feedback. 
</P>
<P>Thanks for caring. 
</P>
<P>Thanks. 
</P>
<P>Lots of love,<BR>
</P>
<P>Kate xx
