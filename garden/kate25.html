<P>[Here is Kate's latest article for the Newsletter. It appeared in the
twenty-third issue (Fall 1989). It is just a brief note which Kate wrote for
fans in the long-delayed issue which accompanied the release of The Sensual
World. The article was accompanied by an unabridged transcription of the late
Roger Scott's last interview with Kate, which can be found (in a slightly more
accurate edition) in Volume Four of The Garden.]

<H3>Be Kind to My Mistakes</H3>
<P>Well, hello. After such a long wait I just hope you won't be disappointed
with the album. Thank you all for your notes and the kind words you sent during
the making of the album--they all helped a lot. I've tried to sit down and write
about the tracks and found it extremely difficult--I guess I've said it all in
the songs--and for your interest we've printed an interview I did with Roger
Scott. It talks about the songs in a way I could not write down. I think this
interview is the most in-depth I've done, in some ways. Roger is a lovely
person, and he presents questions in such a way that I'm happy to talk about
things that with other people I might not want to touch on. I also feel Roger
did one of the best interviews I've been asked to do--it was around the time of
The Dreaming album. 
</P>
<P>This album is my most personal, and I feel my most female so far. It was
very difficult to write the material, but some of the work on this album has
touched me more deeply--working with the Trio Bulgarka, meeting people in
Bulgaria who let us in to their homes and hearts, our work in Ireland, feeling
the tracks coming together through old friends like Pad, Stuart, Charlie, Al,
Dave Gilmour, and new friends like Nigel Kennedy and Davey Spillane. Many
difficult moments in my head with these songs, but so many warm feelings, and my
memories of all the people involved in this project are of us laughing. A huge
thank you to Del--what a long and intense project it was for us. I couldn't have
done it without him! It means a lot to me--he is my favourite engineer. 
</P>
<P>Because of the intimacy with just Del and myself working so closely, I feel
this is the most direct communication I've had with the music in my head and the
music that comes back from tape. Also many thanks to Kevin Killen, who became a
close member of our small group. Kevin was wonderful to work with. Sometimes it
is hard to bring someone in to such a personal set-up, but Kevin was so
sensitive and enthusiastic and such a good mixing engineer. I really couldn't
have wished for nicer people to work with on all the stages of this album. 
</P>
<P>I can't tell you how relieved I am that this album is finished--there were
times when I think we all wondered...? 
</P>
<P>And I'm so happy to let it go now--thanks again to all of you for your kind
words, birthday presents and patience. 
</P>
<P>I hope you like the album--and a big thanks and best wishes to you all. 
</P>
<P>Lots of love, 
</P>
<P>Kate xxx
