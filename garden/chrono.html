<P>[This chronology is basically a revised and slightly enlarged version of a
chronology by Peter FitzGerald-Morris, the editor of Homeground, the
International Kate Bush Fanzine. Peter's chronology was included in a book of
sixty-six of Kate's songs entitled <CITE>Kate Bush Complete</CITE>. 
</P>
<P> That book is an absolutely essential part of any serious fan's collection. 
It may be more valuable for its chronology than for its transcriptions of the
music. The latter, unfortunately, are not an improvement over earlier
publications, offering only the basic melodies notated in drastically simplified
form and punctuated at intervals by shorthand chord indications. <CITE>Kate
Bush Complete</CITE>, however, also presents an edition of the songs' lyrics,
and it marks an improvement over earlier available printed versions. 
</P>
<P> The book was originally edited by Cecil Bolton and published by EMI Music
Publishing, but it is widely understood that virtually all of the research for
the chronology and the lyrics was undertaken by Peter FitzGerald-Morris. Much of
the information which appeared in Peter's
<CITE>Kate Bush Complete</CITE> chronology had appeared in installments over a
period of five years, in issues 1 through 25 of the fanzine
<CITE>Homeground</CITE>.  In <CITE>Kate Bush Complete</CITE> the chronology
was entitled <CITE>Retracing All the Scenes: An Outline of Kate's Career To
Date</CITE>. The following version, which draws from several sources in addition
to the FitzGerald-Morris chronology, is by

<DD> Catherine Bush born at Bexleyheath Maternity Hospital, South East London. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> 1958-1969
</DT>
<DD> Kate has an ordinary childhood in a loving and supportive family, immersed
in music, art and literature. [This statement, sweet but almost comically
uninformative, is the first of many conservative and protective remarks in
FitzGerald-Morris's chronology, which seems -- quite understandably -- to have
been designed at least partly with an eye to defending Kate against various
kinds of criticism in the past.]

aged six.]

<DL>
<DT> September 1969
</DT>
<DD> Kate starts at St. Joseph's Senior School, Bexley. She is obliged to take
up the violin, as all pupils have to learn an instrument. She plays well, but
does not enjoy it. Also at about this time she begins to set her poems to her
own chord formulations.  By 1971 embryonic versions of songs such as The Man
With the Child in His Eyes and Saxophone Song begin to emerge. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> 1970
</DT>
<DD> Kate's brother Paddy needs someone on piano to accompany his violin
playing. Kate's father shows her the C Major chord and she begins to play. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<P> Kate follows her elder brother John and begins to develop her poetry. Her
piano playing is an outlet for her frustration. She is heavily influenced by an
interest in Greek mythology.

<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="72"> 1972</A>
</DT>
<DD> At the suggestion of Kate's family, Ricky Hopper, a friend with music
business connections, tries to place &quot;demo tapes&quot; of Kate's songs with
a record company, with a publishing deal in mind. At this stage Kate considers
herself more of a writer than a singer. These original tapes have over thirty
songs on each. [An unfortunate wording, since it may mean that there was one
collection of thirty songs which was duplicated, and of which one copy was sent
to each publisher; or that there were actually several different thirty-song
collections.] All the major companies are approached. None accepts. Kate's songs
are described as &quot;morbid&quot;, &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;uncommercial&quot;.

</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> Kate feels that she cannot pursue a career in music and considers the
alternatives: psychiatry or social work. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> Unable to help further, Ricky Hopper makes contact with Dave Gilmour of
Pink Floyd, whom he knew at Cambridge University. Gilmour, who at this time is
spotting for talent that he can assist, is persuaded to listen to the demos and
then to hear Kate perform. He is impressed, and agrees to help. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> 1973
</DT>
<DD> Kate records at Gilmour's home studio. The backing band is comprised of
Gilmour himself on guitar, and Peter Perrier and Pat Martin of Unicorn on drums
and bass, respectively. The songs recorded at this stage include Passing Through
Air (later to surface on the b-side of the 1980 single Army Dreamers) and a song
now known as Maybe. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> [Again, a bit more detail would have been welcome here. There is no
mention of how many songs were recorded during these recording sessions.
Incidentally, an excerpt of this version of the so-called Maybe, which
presumably first appeared on Kate's original demos, was played by Kate during a
radio programme called Personal Call. It should not be confused with the
presumably more professional version of the recording which was made the
following year (see below) but which has never been heard by fans.] 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> The new demos are again circulated to record companies with no result. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> 1974
</DT>
<DD> With no progress in her musical ambitions, Kate seriously considers a
career in psychiatry.

grades, with best results in English, music and Latin.

<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> 1975
</DT>
<DD> Gilmour decides that the only way to interest the record companies in
Kate's talent is to make a short three-song demo to full professional standards.
He puts up the money. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> June 1975
</DT>
<DD> Kate goes into Air Studios in London's West End, with Gilmour as producer,
Andrew Powell as arranger, Geoff Emerick as engineer. The three songs recorded
are Saxophone Song (also known at this stage as Berlin), The Man With the Child
in His Eyes, and a song which fans refer to as Maybe.

Gilmour plays the three-track demo to Bob Mercer, then General Manager of EMI's
pop division. Mercer is impressed and negotiations are opened. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> The deal takes some time to conclude. It is much discussed at meetings
between Kate, her family, Gilmour and EMI. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> 1976
</DT>
<DD> Kate gets a small inheritance, and decides to leave school to concentrate
on preparing herself for a career in music. She buys an old honky-tonk piano for
200 Pounds and begins screeching into existence her unmistakable voice. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> [This statement implies that the twenty-two demo-recordings which are now
circulating among fans date from no earlier than 1976. I do not know what the
basis is for Peter's assumption, however.] 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>

<DT> July 1976
</DT>
<DD>  Kate finally settles a recording deal with EMI. The contract is for four
years, with options at the end of the second and third year. Kate receives a
3,000-Pound advance [and 500 Pounds for publication rights]. EMI are content for
Kate to take time to write songs, sharpen her lyrics, train her voice and
generally have time to &quot;grow up&quot;. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> Kate pursues her dancing, first at the Elephant and Castle, South London.
But after seeing Lindsay Kemp perform in Flowers, she attends his classes at the
Dance Centre in Covent Garden. After Kemp goes to Australia, Kate trains with
Arlene Phillips, choreographer of Hot Gossip. [It is probably at this time that
Kate's association with Gary Hurst and Stewart Avon-Arnold, her longtime dancing
partners, begins.]

<DT><A NAME="77"> 1977</A>
</DT>
<DD> During the first year of the contract Kate makes two further demo tapes.
[Very possibly these include the twenty-two recordings now making the rounds
among fans.] She resists EMI's attempts to &quot;commercialize&quot; her songs.
She pursues her dancing. She moves away from home and into a flat in a house
owned by her father in Lewisham, Southeast London, with her brothers as
neighbours.

<DT> April 1977
</DT>
<DD> Kate's brother Paddy forms a band with his friends Del Palmer, Brian Bath
and Charlie Morgan. Kate is asked to be the vocalist, and the band adopts the
title of the KT Bush Band. Starting at the Rose of Lee public house in Lewisham,
and then in pubs and clubs in and around London and the Home Counties over a
three-month period, the band perform a varying set consisting mostly of
rock-and-roll standards (Honky Tonk Women, Heard It Through the Grapevine, Come
Together, Sweet Soul Music, Satisfaction, etc.), although latterly Kate sings
Saxophone Song and James and the Cold Gun from her own repertoire. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> August 1977
</DT>
<DD> Kate is finally called in to record material for an album. The producer
chosen is Andrew Powell, and the backing band are half of Pilot and half of
Cockney Rebel. Though the songs recorded are all Kate's own material, her role
is confined to vocals, some piano-playing and some simple piano arrangements. It
is decided to use eleven songs from this session and two from the 1975 Gilmour
demo on the album. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> September 1977
</DT>
<DD> EMI want to release James and the Cold Gun as the first single. Kate wants
Wuthering Heights, and she gets her way. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> November 4, 1977
</DT>
<DD> The original release date for Wuthering Heights. At a late stage Kate asks
EMI to change the artwork on the picture-sleeve from the &quot;pink top&quot;
photo to Del Palmer's photo-concept of Kite. She gets her way, and all the
campaign materials are altered. By the time the new campaign material is ready,
Christmas is approaching and EMI are unwilling to launch their new artist into
the pre-Christmas maelstrom. The release date is put back until the new year.
Many demos [i.e., promos] of the single have already been sent out to radio
producers. EMI tries to retrieve them to prevent premature airplay. Eddie Puma,
producer of London commercial station Capital Radio's Late Show, and Tony Myatt,
the presenter, admire the record so much that they decide to play it, and
continue to play it throughout November and December. Other radio stations
follow. Wuthering Heights is an airplay hit two months before release.

<DD> Kate makes her first-ever television appearance in a disused tram depot in
West Germany, for the famous Bio's Bahnhof on WDR-TV. She sings Kite live,
backed effectively by the KT Bush Band, and Wuthering Heights to a backing tape.
The backdrop, which is supposed to represent the Yorkshire moors, includes a
volcano. Following her performance the host, Dr. Alfred Biolek, carries on an
entirely one-sided onstage conversation with Kate--in German.

<DT> March 2, 1978
</DT>
<DD> The Keith (&quot;Keef&quot;) MacMillan-directed video for Wuthering
Heights is shown on Top of the Pops. It is the second video for the song. The
first, made by Rockflix in an [unidentified] outdoor setting, is rejected for
British promotional use, although it is used in other territories. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> March 7, 1978
</DT>
<DD> Wuthering Heights is number 1 on the British singles chart, displacing
Abba. The press turn it into a nationalistic celebration. EMI celebrate with a
champagne reception for Kate, and dinner in Paris. She celebrates by buying a
7,000-Pound Steinway piano. The single celebrates by going silver in the U.K.
(250,000 sales).

Tonight. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> Mickie Most asks Kate to appear in the pilot edition of his new pop-rock
television programme Revolver. She is introduced by Peter Cook and sings Them
Heavy People (which EMI want to release as the follow-up single) live. The
programme is screened on May 20, 1978. [This is not the performance included in
the video compilation The Single File.]

in the Irish ratings, The Late Late Show. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> [The Kick Inside is released in the U.S.A., unchanged except for an
inappropriate U.S.- and Canada-only front-cover design, not authorized by Kate.
This is sometimes known as the &quot;mirror&quot; cover. To this day the cover
continues to be used by Harvest, EMI's distributor for Kate's recordings in
Canada, but it was discontinued in the U.S. in July 1978 when Kate's contract
was transferred to the newly launched EMI-America label.] 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> The album's reception in the U.S. is somewhat quieter than in Europe and
England. [To put it mildly!] Capitol-EMI wait for FM radio-play to determine a
likely single. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> April 4, 1978
</DT>
<DD> Wuthering Heights moves down to number 3. The Kick Inside reaches its
chart peak at number 3.

<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> Kate is off to Europe to promote single and album in the Netherlands, West
Germany (a second time) and France. In The Netherlands, Kate makes a 25-minute
promotional film of six tracks [Peter inexplicably writes &quot;seven&quot;,
though only six tracks were filmed] at De Efteling is in Kaatsheuvel,  a gothic
horror theme-park. Her visit is commemorated by a new gravestone. She performs
on the Voor De Vuist Weg television programme. In Germany Kate appears on the
television programmes Scene '78 and Top Pop, performing Wuthering Heights on
both shows. Other guests on the former programme include Dr. Feelgood and The
Boomtown Rats.

<DD> Kate makes her first promotional trip to the U.S.A. and Canada (although
she gives no performances and makes no U.S. television appearances), and then
takes a short holiday. [This must be the same trip which is mentioned
immediately above, for April. The U.S.-made interview album Self Portrait may
have been cut during this trip.] 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>

London base. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> EMI allow Kate to have her way over the choice of the follow-up single in
the U.K. It is to be The Man With the Child in His Eyes, which Kate had always
wanted to be a single, as she felt it showcased her real songwriting talent. It
is less of a novelty, and more of a standard. Dave Gilmour (executive producer
on the track, which actually dates from the June, 1975 demo-sessions) is also
pleased. In Japan, the U.S. and elsewhere the follow-up later in the year will
be EMI's first choice, Them Heavy People. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>

<DD> Kate goes to Japan to participate in the 7th Tokyo Song Festival.  On June
18 she performs Moving (which is the debut single in Japan) live before an
audience of 11,000 at the Nippon Budokan. The television audience is nearer 35
million. The single is boosted on its way to number 1 in the Japanese chart.
Kate wins the Silver Prize jointly with American group The Emotions [!].

advertisement, and her only endorsement for a commercial product--a spot for
Seiko watches. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> On her return to Britain Kate has under four weeks to get material
together for her second album. She does not like being under such pressure. In
the time available, three new songs are written, and a number of old ones are
revamped. These songs, making up the basic material for Lionheart, are demoed in
a studio designed by Paddy Bush and built out of the royalties from Wuthering
Heights.

<DT> July 1978
</DT>
<DD> Kate is the best selling female albums artist in the U.K. for the first
quarter of 1978. Wuthering Heights has been number 1 in the Netherlands,
Belgium, New Zealand (five weeks), and Australia; and &quot;top-ten&quot; in
Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

[and with a different but equally inappropriate cover, now sometimes referred to
as the &quot;country-western&quot; or &quot;Tammy Wynette&quot; cover.]
Wuthering Heights is finally released as a single in the U.S. There are some
good notices, but Kate is considered by radio programmers to be &quot;too
bizarre&quot; for the American market. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> July 7, 1978
</DT>
<DD> Kate travels to Superbear Studios in Nice, France to record her second
album. She had had good reports of this studio from Dave Gilmour, who recorded
his first solo album there. The recording is a much-needed break for Kate. In
the sunshine and the mountain air she recovers from almost six months of solid
promotion, and pursues her real vocation, making music. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> August, 1978
</DT>
<DD> It takes ten weeks at Superbear to record twelve tracks, of which ten are
used for the new album. [These two unreleased tracks have never been
identified.] Kate has definite aims for this album. She sees her first album as
having affected the senses. Lionheart is to be aimed at the guts. In this she
comes into some conflict with Andrew Powell, who is again acting as producer.
She is allowed more of her own way in the studio, and after applying some
pressure, she is able to bring the KT Bush Band in to play on some of the
tracks. Kate is credited as assistant producer, but Lionheart is the end of the
road for the Bush-Powell partnership. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DT> September 5, 1978
</DT>
<DD> Kate debuts one of the tracks from Lionheart on a U.K. children's
television programme, Ask Aspel. She later explains that she wanted to sing In
the Warm Room, but felt that it was too risque for a children's show. She sings
Kashka From Baghdad, a song about two gay lovers, instead. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<DL>
<DD> As the album takes longer than expected, Kate is recalled to London by EMI
to do some prior promotion. At her own request, Kate is interviewed by a diverse
collection of publications ranging from The Sun, to Vegetarian and Vogue (the
last featuring Kate in photographs by David Bailey).

of 1,000 in a circus tent, and a television audience of two million on the Nine
Network.

<DD> Hammer Horror enters the British singles chart at the unexpectedly low
place of number 73. [Contrary to usual record-company theory, saturation of the
market place with new, rushed product nearly immediately after the success of a
debut album is more often than not a poor business move, and usually does as
much damage as good to the artist's budding popularity. The commercially
mediocre sales of Lionheart should not have surprised anyone.]

an Easter Abba Special, she records a routine for Wow. At the rehearsals the
cameramen and journalists break into spontaneous applause, and the press
coverage verges on the hysterical. For the second programme, a Christmas
programme to be called The Winter Snowtime Special, she records a version of
Wuthering Heights barefoot in the snow of the Swiss Alps. [The latter film was

didn't do any lip-synching and because it wasn't garish enough for their horrid,
smarmy, miserable format. But too erotic for MTV? Hah.]  Instead they use the
Wogan performance. It remains on moderate rotation for two months.

</DT>
<DD> In the U.S., the single Love and Anger has considerable college and
alternative-market success, and its accompanying video is aired often by MTV.
Unfortunately Kate's new U.S. label, Columbia Records, fails to offer more than
nominal support for the album, and as a result its phenomenal commercial
potential--indicated in dozens of alternative rock charts throughout the
nation--is completely wasted, and the album never becomes known to the general
record-buying public. It is unable to crack the top forty, but it does have a
remarkable longevity, remaining in the Billboard Top 200 for a total of six full
months. A golden opportunity has been squandered by Columbia. 
</DD></DL>
<PRE></PRE>
<P> In response to the unusual college interest, in January Kate finally does
make a brief trip to New York in support of the album, but she does not schedule
nearly as many interviews as she had done in 1985, and she makes no personal
appearances. As a result, she is seen only extremely briefly on U.S. national
news, and in five or six ten-second (that's right, ten-second!) interview &quot;sound-bites&quot;
on MTV in January and February. (She also gives a twenty-minute phone-in
interview, in which a large number of radio disc jockeys joined in for a
conference call and ask a large number of too-familiar questions.)
