<P>[The following is a letter which Kate wrote to a former schoolmate, sometime
between April and July 1975, when Kate had all but finalised her contract with
EMI, but before the album had been begun. It first appeared in Kerry Juby's book
Kate Bush: The Whole Story. Edited by Andrew Marvick.]

<P>Dear Fran, 
</P>
<P>Thanks for your letter--it was really, really nice to hear from you, but not
a total surprise--it was strange because you appeared for a split second in my
dream last night and your letter was at my parents' this morning. It's good to
hear you're so well and coping with your life--Well Done--it gets really hard
sometimes, dun it? 
</P>
<P>I gather you hear I've left school? Well, I left during last year's summer
holidays--before they all went back for the autumn term. I've only been back
once since, and that was an extremely brief visit, but that's how it goes...! I
now go to an open dance college in London. It's called the Dance Centre, and
it's OK. It is expensive and my life is, at the moment, revolving around the
money that's left over from the lessons, but that's enough for me to have fun
and buy cigarettes. (I am afraid to say that I'm still smoking quite a lot but I
think I've got it under control?) 
</P>
<P>I haven't heard from you for so long that it's difficult to know where to
start. I guess you know that I have set myself a definite ambition as a career.
I want to sing, write songs and mime. I've got a contract actually being drawn
up by a record company at last, but it has taken four years (approximately) to
get this far--but I think it is going to get more progressive--I hope so. I'm
working quite hard on my voice and on songs (and dancing too I suppose) but I
seem to spend most of my time waiting for it all to happen. Last summer I took
mime lessons with Lindsay Kemp. He is an amazing person and I met a lot of nice
friends through the classes. The more people I meet now, the older and stranger
they seem to get--it's funny... 
</P>
<P>I've had my two front teeth straightened at the dentist. The appointment was
2 1/2 hours long, and he's put temporary crowns in at the moment, but they're
nice--it's just that I'm a bit paranoid about the fact that they're held in by
glue--I really hope they don't fall out! I also failed my driving test in March,
but I'll take it again in August. 
</P>
<P>I've got your phone number. It would be really nice to see you again...one
night, for old times' sake, huh? I'm in Lewisham now in a very beautiful flat,
above my brothers--I'm very free and very happy. Anyway, Fran, I'll give you a
ring in the next month or two (I say that far away because I know how
inefficient I am at getting things like that together, but this, I will,
eventually, honest). 
</P>
<P>Lots of love, 
</P>
<P>Kate 
</P>
<P>P.S.: No, I don't really see people from school much, but I find it so
strange when I do--I feel so, so, different, very far away from them.  
</P>
