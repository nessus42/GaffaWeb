<P>[Here, finally, is the brief interview which is Kate's only contribution to
the 22nd issue of the Newsletter It came out in late December, 1987).] 
</P>

</PRE>
<P>How is the new album going? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, as usual it is slow, but I keep writing new songs, as I feel the
urge. And I now have lots of songs, but most of them have pieces missing or
sparse lyrics, and sorting these things out takes a lot of time.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How are you approaching this album? Is it different from the last one? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Again I am working straight onto master tape in our home studio. As I
get ideas, I put them onto tape. Sometimes this causes more problems, because
I'll like parts of it and not others, but I try to re-do as little as possible.
I like to try and keep the performances quick and spontaneous. It's the sorting
out of these performances afterwards, and the rethinking of structure or
arrangements, that take the time. Each musician changes the feel of the track
dramatically, and it's important to keep the track moving in the right direction
and to communicate what is wanted, which in my case is achieved through images,
humming lines and letting the musicians do what they feel is right and saying if
I don't like it. It seems to have worked, so far, and I always find musicians so
inspiring. Quite often they'll put an edge to the track that gives it greater
potential, so I sit and re-think bits again. The tracks continually change, and
yet the original &quot;feeling&quot; doesn't seem to. I'd like to think that by
putting the initial &quot;muse&quot; onto tape, we've captured its soul, so that
whatever we put on top of it, it is, in essence, the same.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Are you using a lot of synthesizers? If so, which ones, and how? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm using the Fairlight again, and a DX-7; but a lot of the songs have
been written on piano initially, and it does definitely give the songs a
different flavour from those written on Fairlight. A lot of rhythms are arranged
by Del, and we tend to keep bits and replace a lot with real drums, but still
keeping his &quot;feel&quot;. But there are a few tracks which are just
synthesized drums. It's whatever works;  but I am using a lot of real
instruments on this album. I really like working with musicians, they approach
things from a different angle. They have fresh ideas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When will the album be finished? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Umm...&quot; 
</P>
<P>When do you think it will be finished? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Umm...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you been doing other projects besides the album? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've been mainly concentrating on the album and catching up on my life
a bit, but I did write a song for a film by an American Director: John Hughes.
The piece from the film is extremely moving, and I really enjoyed writing to it.
Let's hope when the film is released (hopefully some time in '88) that you get
to see it. The director has a very distinctive style (he directed The Breakfast
Club, which I really like), and I think this, his latest film She's Having a
Baby, is well worth a watch.&quot; 
</P>
<P>You also appeared at Peter Gabriel's live concert at Earls Court. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it was very much a last minute decision. Peter had asked me, and
I wasn't sure if I was brave enough to perform unrehearsed in front of such a
large crowd. It is such a beautiful song to sing, but the reception from the
audience was so overwhelming, I couldn't hear what I was singing. So if anyone
reading this was there that night--sorry if I was a bit out of tune; and if you
were one of those people--thanks for an incredible experience, I don't think
I'll ever forget that welcome. It was a fantastic concert and I am, again, very
honoured to have been involved in Peter's work.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I know you like animals and I hear you keep cats. I wondered how many you
have? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I used to have two cats. Zoodle and Pyewackit, but I'm afraid that
Zoodle died earlier this year. I was very upset, but she was eleven and had a
good life. She was a beautiful cat. Pyewackit is absolutely fine, although she
missed Zoodle at first. A few months ago we adopted a stray, feeding her and
letting her live in the garage, and she had three kittens. We now have the 3
kittens. They are called Rocket, Sparky and Torchy. And although Pye didn't like
them all at first, they all get on really well now, and we find them cuddled up
on a chair together when we get in. They're such good company for her, and they
all have such different personalities. It's so entertaining just sitting
watching them play. It's bringing out the kitten in Pye: I've noticed her
springing across the floor and leaping onto ledges that are far too small for
her. She does things she hasn't tried for years and seems to be enjoying it all.
I guess we're all young at heart, but sometimes it takes something to rediscover
it!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Dear All, 
</P>
<P>Hoping you have a very special Christmas and a great New Year. 
</P>
<P>'Til '88--All the best and lots of love, 
</P>
