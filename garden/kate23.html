<P>[Here is an interview, apparently conducted by Kate, using the name Zwort
Finkle. It appeared in the twenty-first issue (winter 1987).]

<H3>&quot;Cousin Kate&quot; by Zwort Finkle</H3>
<P>Hi, my name's Zwort Finkle, I'm from the U.S. of A. and I'm a distant cousin
of Kate's. We haven't seen each other for years, so I had to fill her in on my
life story. I left college three years ago, and have been following a brilliant
career in journalism, working for such well known magazines as Blurt, Let's Go
Crazy, Let's Go Crazy Again, Son of Blurt and Let's Go Blurt Again. This was my
first visit to London, and I was astounded at how you guys can survive this
climate, how you manage to keep to one side of the road when the roads are so
small, how quaint and cute you all are, and how totally bored and unenthused you
all are with things that would make us little old Americans go &quot;Yee-Hah&quot;.

</P>
<P>Zwort: Tell me, Katie, have you ever thought of living in America? 
</P>
<P>Katie: There are very few places I've been to that I've felt I could live
in--I think too many of my roots are here in England, and so much of my work is
based here, and I seem to spend most of my time working. I've only been to
America a few times, and then only to New York, L.A. and Las Vegas, but maybe if
I visited more parts of America I would find a place that I feel I could live
in. I really enjoyed my visits, especially to New York--there's so much energy
there, so many different and interesting people and a very social sense between
artistic people, that certainly in the music business doesn't exist in this
country. People seem to work in great isolation here, whereas in New York,
people want to get together and talk and enthuse. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Like, er, do you feel there's a lack of enthusiasm here, cous'? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes, I do, and I feel a lot of people, certainly within the music
business, are particularly attracted to America by this. &quot;Artistic&quot;
people like--possibly even need--a lot of feedback, and Americans are wonderful
at making you feel wanted, and are very positive about the launching of new
ideas, new approaches. It's exciting to be among this energy, and in England I
think we're all a bit hard on each other, but this country has a great wealth of
talent and creative ideas, it's just that people have to fight a little to get a
bit of enthusiasm going. But maybe that's not such a bad thing--maybe it creates
more determination in a cause. What do you think, cousin Rodney? 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Actually, it's Zwort. 
</P>
<P>Katie: Sorry? 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Zwort!! 
</P>
<P>Katie: Sorry, what's Zwort? 
</P>
<P>Zwort: My name, of course. 
</P>
<P>Katie: Oh! 
</P>
<P>Zwort: What were you doing in Las Vegas? That's an unusual place to visit! 
</P>
<P>Katie: I was there with a guy from the record company just for a day, and it
was really just an opportunity to see the place while he had business matters to
deal with. It is an extraordinary place. Instead of saying &quot;How you doing?&quot;,
everyone says, &quot;Feeling lucky?&quot; It's like a strange oasis stuck right
in the middle of the desert away from everything. We took a flight in a small
plane over the Grand Canyon, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences
I've ever had. The Canyon is totally enormous, and we were so tiny-- I've never
experienced that kind of vertigo before or since, and with all the air pockets,
we went up and down, up and down. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: I understand you don't do many interviews. 
</P>
<P>Katie: That's right. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Why is that? 
</P>
<P>Katie: I find it very difficult to express myself in interviews. Often
people have so many preconceptions that I spend most of the interview trying to
defend myself from the image that was created by the media eight years ago. That
is understandable to a certain extent--that's when I did most of my interviews,
and I think the image was created by what the press felt the public wanted, how
they interpreted me as I was then, and how I projected myself at that time. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: You mean like saying &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;, and that
you were weak and fragile, etc. 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes, that is part of it. I was very young, idealistic and
enthusiastic about so much then, but I felt they exaggerated these qualities.
And I was--and am even more so now--a private person, and perhaps because I
wouldn't talk about these areas of my life they turned to the &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;
girl, even when I didn't use those words. The few interviews I do, people still
seem to dwell on this old &quot;me&quot;, and I find it disappointing when I
want to talk about my current work. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Do you , like, er, think enthusiasm was an unfashionable thing,
particularly at this time, when punk and street cred were the &quot;hip&quot;
thing? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes, I do. I think it still is, particularly in this country. But I
think clever people hide their unfashionable faces from the public. Perhaps in a
way, I was too open with the press, maybe I should have &quot;performed&quot;
for them, and puked and gobbed at the cameras, but it's not my nature, I was
brought up too well. The interviews I've sat through patiently, sometimes
hanging onto my patience with the skin of my teeth, thinking it's good for my
tolerance and might make me a better person. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: But you do occasionally talk to the press? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes. There are good people to talk to, they're not always talking
about the past, or deliberately trying to make you look like an idiot, and are
genuinely interested in my work. But it's like I said, I find it hard to express
myself in interviews. It depends how I feel--sometimes they're fun, especially
if I know the journalist, and the questions are interesting--they make you think
about areas you might not have even considered before. But sometimes I find
myself saying things just to please them, or just to give a question an answer.
Sometimes I get verbal diarrhoea and just burble complete rubbish, and sometimes
I feel so guarded that I invert, and feel like a trapped animal. Quite often I
go over an interview in my head afterwards and realise I've said something
completely contrary to what I believe, but I put most of it down to being quite
a private person, and being someone who likes to think carefully about how I say
something. Words are very special things, and are so easily misinterpreted-- I
much prefer to write lyrics than do an interview. I feel I'm a songwriter, not a
personality, and I find it difficult to even talk about my songs, sometimes. In
a way, they speak for themselves, and the subjects or inspirations can be so
personal, or just seem ridiculous when spoken about. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Do you think it's important that people know what the songs are
about? 
</P>
<P>Katie: No, I think it can be interesting for people, but their
interpretation is what matters, and I find it fascinating how people do seem to
understand so much about a song that must be totally obscure and is so personal
to me, but maybe they just feel it, they feel the emotions of the song, somehow
grasp the meanings. It's so hard for me to tell because I know what it's about,
but for example, some of the stuff on The Ninth Wave are so obscure lyrically,
and yet people seem to know exactly what I'm trying to say. That's a great
feeling. It stops me worrying about that aspect of songwriting--that someone
somewhere knows exactly what you're trying to put into words. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Do you have favourite lyric-writers, as opposed to &quot;musical&quot;
songwriters? 
</P>
<P>Katie: I'm not sure you can separate the two, because once a word is sung,
it can completely change its feeling to the point where you don't recognise the
word any more--for me that is part of the fascination. But my favourite lyric
just now is The Boy in the Bubble by Paul Simon. The chorus of that is totally
brilliant, particualarly the line, &quot;The way we look to the distant
constellation that is dying in the corner of the sky.&quot; It's poetry, but the
impact is the combination of the words with the music, and the way he sings
it--it's so good. But quite often I mishear lyrics, and prefer my version to the
real words when I find them out. I know a lot of people who have the same
experience, and again we're back to what music means to the listener, or how
they hear it. Music is a very special thing. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Would you say that music is something religious, even holy to you? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Some of the most beautiful music ever was written for God, for a
loved one, in a state of grief, sorrow, suppression--it seems to be an
expression from a person on a higher level...? I'm not sure I understand it at
all, but music seems to come out of people when very little else can. Some of
the great composers wrote beautiful music but, as people, were monsters or
maniacs. People who can't speak properly because of stutters can sing fluently.
I saw a clip from a programme about a man who only had a short-term memory--he
couldn't remember anything: what he'd just said, just done. He lived in a
constant state of panic, buecause he didn't know where he was, or why he was
there. It was terrifying. The only thing he could remember was he wife, and when
he sat at the church organ at his local church he could sing a play complete
pieces of music without any problems. It was like he'd suddenly been set free.
And yet when he was shown a video recording of him doing this, he had no memory
of it whatsoever. Music is a strange and beautiful thing. It means a great deal
to me. I love listening to and making music. I am very lucky to be able to be
involved with music--I hope I always will be. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Do you think music comes from the soul? This is what some people
believe. 
</P>
<P>Katie: I don't know. I just know that music is something special, and also
something very personal for people. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Going back to the obscurity of some of your songs that are personal
to you, and how you feel people pick up on this-- can you give some detailed
examples? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Mmmh, let me think. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: I'll make a cup of coffee and you have a think, cous'. 
</P>
<P>Katie: Rod--er, Zwort? 
</P>
<P>Zwort (from kitchen): Yeah? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Can I have tea? 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Yeah, sure--you English and your tea. It's so quaint! Can we have
scones and I'll have tea too? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Sorry, haven't got any, but there's some fig rolls... 
</P>
<P>(ten minutes later...) 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Okay--teabreak over. 
</P>
<P>Katie: Right, back to your question. I think it works on the basis of: if it
moves you, it could move others. Hitchcock was talking about his films and
saying the best subjects for his films that were frightening were things that
frightened him--like Vertigo. Apparently he was terrified of heights. It seems
logical, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Yeah, sure. Hitchcock was brilliant. 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes, I agree, a genius. An engineer we were working with picked out
the line in And Dream of Sheep that says 'Come here with me now.' I asked him
why he liked it so much. He said, 'I don't know, I just love it. It's so moving
and comforting.' I don't think he even knew what was being said exactly, but the
song is about someone going to sleep in the water, where they're alone and
frightened. And they want to go to sleep, to get away from the situation. But at
the same time it's dangerous to go to sleep in water, you could drown. When I
was little, and I'd had a bad dream, I'd go into my parents' bedroom round to my
mother's side of the bed. She'd be asleep, and I wouldn't want to wake her, so
I'd stand there and waid for her to sense my presence and wake up. She always
did, within minutes; and sometimes I'd frighten her--standing there still, in
the darkness in my nightdress. I'd say, &quot;I've had a bad dream,&quot; and
she'd lift bedclothes and say something like &quot;Come here with me now.&quot;
It's my mother saying this line in the track, and I briefed her on the ideas
behind it before she said it. And I think it's the motherly comfort that this
engineer picked up on. In fact, he said this was his favourite part of the
album. Cloudbusting is, again, lyrically very obscure. I think the idea is easy
to grasp, but the story behind it is very involved, and in a way the video that
accompanies it is equally so, but I've spoken to several people who have felt
very moved by the song or the video or both, and they all say they feel this
really personal relationship between the child and his father, how real it
seems, how sad it is. For me, that is wonderful--the book that originally
inspired the song and video moved me so much! It's so sad, and it's also a true
story, and somehow even if people don't understand the story, they pick up on
the feelings, the emotions--this is a very rewarding experience for me. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Did the writer of the book get to hear the song and see the video? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes. These were worrying moments for me--what if he didn't like it?
If I'd got it wrong? But he said he found them very emotional and that I'd
captured the situation. This was the ultimate reward for me 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Do you stay in contact? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes, we write to each other, and I enjoy the contact very much. Many
people have tried to get this book [ A Book of Dreams, by Peter Reich], many
have read it since and adore it. The trouble is, the book is out of print, and I
think it's such a shame that it's unavailable for those that would love to read
it. It's very difficult to find copies of it, though I understand that some
libraries still carry it. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: How do you feel about The Whole Story? Were you against the release
of a compilation album? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes, I was at first. I was concerned that it would be like a &quot;K-Tel&quot;
record, a cheapo-compo with little thought behind it. It was the record
company's decision, and I didn't mind as long as it was well put together. We
put a lot of work into the packaging, trying to make it look tasteful, and
carefully thought out the the running order. And the response has been
phenomenal--I'm amazed! 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Careful, there's that word! 
</P>
<P>Katie: Surely I can say it once or twice. Everybody else does, and gets away
with it--Zzzwort!! 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Only teasing. How do you feel about the video compilation? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Again, I was worried initially, because of the release of The Single
File and Hair of the Hound, but with the opportunity of getting Experiment IV on
it, and the record company being sure there was a market, I felt it could be a
good idea. We spent a lot of work on Experiment IV, and because of it almost
being an &quot;adult&quot; video, we were sure we'd have trouble getting it
shown on TV. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Did you have trouble getting it shown? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Yes. The video took a long time to make, and with having to write and
record the single with the tightest deadlines I've ever had, the video was
needed before we'd finished it. But we did get a minute clip ready in time to be
shown when the single was charting, but Top of the Pops refused to show it,
saying it was too violent! It's not violent at all, but we expected a response
like this. Pop promos are in a very sensitive area. They're considered &quot;family
viewing&quot;, but there are many sexualy ambiguous videos shown on children's
TV--yet this was considered too extreme. However, The Tube showed it in its
entirety, and it's now showing at the cinema with a feature film, so we've made
a sort of B-film!! That's quite exciting. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: I noticed that instead of the Wow video you've pieced together
footage from the live shows. Why is this? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Two reasons, really. Firstly, I really don't like the promo we did
for Wow. I think it's silly. And also, looking through the videos I noticed a
great absence of &quot;performance&quot; promos, and the tour was an important
part of the story. Also, it makes it a more interesting item for people who have
some of the other videos. That way it's not just Experiment IV that is a new
visual. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: I understand you directed this clip. How did it go, and why did you
direct it? 
</P>
<P>Katie: Directing is a new experiment for me--actually, it was Experiment
III--and with this track I had such strong visual ideas while I was writing the
song that I wanted to give it another go. It's the first time the video and song
have come together. It was very hard work, but a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>We filmed in an old disused hospital, and the conditions were very cold and
damp, but everyone got very involved and we had a great time. 
</P>
<P>The cast included Dawn French, Hugh Laurie, Richard Vernon, Peter Vaughan,
Del, Paddy, Jay, Lisa and many friends. It was wonderful to work with people who
I admire so much, and a very exciting experience. Paddy played the lunatic, and
in every take his sounds were just as impressive as his visuals--I wish I'd put
it onto tape. He literally &quot;threw&quot; himself into the part, and the crew
were so impressed they applauded him--a great accolade! 
</P>
<P>Although this was the most complicated of my directions, it was so much
easier for me because I appeared in it only briefly, so I could concentrate on
being behind the camera, which I really enjoy. And it's so nice to involve the
people I like--not only are they great performers, but they're good to be with.

</P>
<P>There were some wonderful moments, like filming in East London. We had a
field full of &quot;dead bodies&quot; who kept moving about to get more
comfortable, so we had to shout out over a loud-hailer, &quot;Stop
moving--You're supposed to be dead!&quot; And the music shop that we created for
the shot [ Music For Pleasure ] was so realistic that passers-by kept popping in
wanting to buy some of the instruments. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: How do you view the changes audially and visually on The Whole Story
album and video? 
</P>
<P>Katie: I really like the idea of the album being available on video--I've
always wanted to make a form of video album, but I never thought it would be a
compilation! 
</P>
<P>I see two main changes, although I'm very subjective. Audially, the
important step for me was production, which had led on to our own studio. The
process is so much more personal because of this. On the first two albums all my
arrangements were contained within the piano arrangement, which was the
foundation, but which was then handed over to Andrew Powell as producer to
interpret with his string arrangements. And the musicians and I worked in my
backing vocals by playing the tapes over and over and singing along. But being
producer I could put a lot less emphasis on the piano arrangement and interpret
the song through other instruments onto tape, even playing around with the parts
after the musicians had gone, and getting our own studio meant I could build up
the song straight onto tape, keeping bits that worked and building up ideas even
before the musicians came in. 
</P>
<P>Visually, I see a shift from being inspired by dance (Lindsay Kemp being a
big influence), to filmic imagery (being influenced by all the films I love so
much). I find the combination of film and music very exciting, and it's very
rare for people to concentrate on both with equal concern--film-makers don't
want the music to distract, and musicians don't want the visuals to be stronger
than the music. But when it works, it's so powerful! For instance, The Wall,
Singing in the Rain, Amadeus-- there are definitely people moving this way more
and more. It's great. 
</P>
<P>Zwort: Wouldn't it be great to attack all the senses at once? To have film
and music, sensurround fitted to the seats, scents filtered in through the
air-conditioning--Yee-hah! 
</P>
<P>Katie: Oh, Cousin Rodney--that's what I love about you: you're so
enthusiastic! 
</P>
<P>Zwort: It's Zwort!
