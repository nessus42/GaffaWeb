<H3>Stag Night at the Practise</H3>
<P>The other week I was working up at Abbey Road Studios. It hasn't really
changed in all the years I've known it. To me it feels like my old school, it
has an atmosphere all its own. I'm afraid that I have a somewhat eccentric
reputation with the people there. They are very kind and accommodating as
sometimes they have to be. All kinds of professional musicians use these
studios, and in the daytime you can find yourself queueing behind an orchestra
for a cup of tea and then again, come evening time there may be a berserk
Bulgarian drummer spear-fishing choc-ices in the canteen. 
</P>
<P>There are three studios, and they are referred to by their numbers. Number
One is huge--that's where all the orchestral sessions are done. We would
occasionally use it for recording a solo piano before the days of the digital
reverb; and maybe the odd battleship, as the studio has large doors at the back.
The night before a classical session the engineers set studio number One up, and
I would often go in afterwards and stand where the conductor would be, looking
out at all the phantom musicians with their music-stands, seats and headphones.
A session like that could be set up for a hundred people, many of them being
placed in soundproof boxes in order to give good separation amongst the
different instruments and voices. Film music is often recorded here, too; there
are several big, robust projectors in a room on one side, and a large cinema
screen opposite. Everywhere in number One are rolling boom microphones. These
are very large microphone-stands with wheels on. They have handles for making
the boom go up and down and the stands can put a microphone up to thirty feet in
the air. They resemble metal birds with thin legs. I would often dance with
these when no-one was about. You need a clear studio, but once you get one of
these booms rolling and jumping, you can hurtle from one side of the room to the
other, performing uncontrollable circles. The knack is to get off the hurtling
steel giraffe and make it look like you weren't doing a silly high-speed Tango
when the security guard comes in looking confused because there isn't supposed
to be anybody in there. 
</P>
<P> Just across the way is number Two studio, our favourite and the home of
many of Kate's tracks. This is the studio The Beatles are supposed to have liked
the most. It's really got atmosphere. It is quite large, and its control-room is
up a huge flight of stairs. We used this studio for shooting videos and live
television transmission. I like to sit up in the control-room on these
occasions, as most people don't even realise it's there. When I sit under the
air-conditioning outlet and press my nose against the glass and look down into
the studio, I get this feeling that is to me the essence of Abbey Road, and hard
to describe unless you've done it. 
</P>
<P> Number Three is a smaller, more modern studio that I always associate with
Roy Harper and Abbey Road's chief engineer Haydn Bendall. We've had some really
great times in there. They've got a new tape-recorder now, a Mitsubishi Digital
32-track, quite an amazing thing. This studio is where most of The Dreaming was
recorded, and indeed where I threw kangaroos at a water tank. This is an area
that some of you will remember from the past, and that I'm sure the people at
Abbey Road will never forget. Anyway, less of this past nostalgia and into the
land of dijeridu present. It's practice, practice, practice. My lips are sore,
my teeth go soft, and I'm beyond seeing wallabies, but if one is to get
anywhere, the three practices always apply. I find myself practising so many
instruments at the moment, I can never tell which one is going to be asked for,
but of course the one in most demand is that aboriginal favourite of mine. Yes,
indeed, dijeridu session-musicians are in very high demand these days. You won't
hear us on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. That's because most of our work is
secret, and so I'm not going to tell you anything about it. 
</P>
<P> I wonder if you have enjoyed the sounds of summer as much as me this year.
I've been doing some wildlife recording especially about insects and birds--it's
been quite wonderful. The other day I was recording a hive of bees. It was a
marvellous sound. I put a directional microphone in the entrance and stood about
twenty feet away in safety. I found myself very taken with them; I like the way
they dance. It's so practical and everybody pays such great attention in the
hive to follow the details of the dance; and the music that overflows from their
society has a quality that is quite unique. I have tried recording wasps and
hornets, too, but they have nothing on the bees. The only contender, as far as
I'm concerned, in the world of British buzzing insects, is the stag beetle in
flight: a bit like a Sunderland flying boat. In some parts of the world people
play music on stag beetles. You have to catch one and hold it very near your
open mouth, and as it buzzes you can play harmonic sequences by changing your
mouth's shape. Sounds fun, doesn't it? Why don't you try it some tim The things
we recording artists are asked to do are sometimes astounding. But above all
this weirdness, practice is the most arduous and rewarding. It can really drive
the neighbours crazy hearing the same tune being played sometimes a thousand
times a day, especially when things get loud. I can understand why many
musicians prefer to live in the quiet of the uncrowded countryside, and of
course stag beetles are plentiful there, and so easy to find. 
</P>
<P> I've always had a passion for recording things in the field. Many years ago
Jay, Kate and I would travel around our part of England looking for traditional
dances and music. I used to make recordings on an old portable reel-to-reel
machine before the invention of the cassette-recorder. I used to put it in a
canvas shoulder-bag so that it wouldn't look conspicuous. However, if one of the
reels got jammed, I could wind up with a quarter of a mile of tape, all
unspooling in my bag, and then overflowing onto the ground around my feet. Those
were the days. 
</P>
<P> Things are so much easier now. In fact, I am taking the opportunity to
write this very article whilst out on a rather special field-recording
expedition. Do you remember in my last article I described my supersonic bat
plunge of doom after placing my foot in a lion's mouth, etc.? Well, Kate said
that she really got off on the sound of it all, and could I do it again only
this time on tape. Why not? I thought. I've done it so many times before, a few
more couldn't hurt. As I mentioned earlier, it's all a question of practice; and
at times, when I feel as though I'm bashing my head against a brick wall, I just
remember the three practices, and most things can be as easy as falling off a
log.
