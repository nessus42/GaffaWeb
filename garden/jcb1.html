    <H3>The Game of Utsu</H3>
    
    <P>We have made up a game for letting off steam and providing good
      entertainment for anybody who might be watching it. It involves three
      people (although you can play it with just two) and will be a perfect
      indoor game for an martial-arts enthusiasts, as it will tone up reactions
      remarkably. </P>
    
    <P> Two people can play the game at a time, with a third acting as judge.
      The winner takes on the next player and so on, until only one person is
      left. The two players lie down on the floor head to head, with their left
      hand gripping the other's left hand. They are blindfolded (check they
      can't peep) and have in their right hands an Utsu stick. This is just a
      lightly rolled newspaper. The judge gives a signal for starting, and one
      player shouts &quot;Utsu!&quot;. Within ten seconds the other must shout
      back &quot;Hi!&quot;, and the first player then strikes where he thinks
      the other one is. Once the person shouting &quot;Hi!&quot; has made his
      shout he must keep still. A point is scored if the head is struck by the
      newspaper. Three points are normally played for--the winner being the
      person with the most points. The trick is to make the striker strike at
      where your voice has come from by twisting away from where you made your
      shout. </P>
    
    <P> Each exchange can last for as long as like, but it's a good idea to
      limit it. Some players will wait, listening for the slightest noise before
      striking. It's not how hard you hit that is important, but how accurately;
      and with experienced players the game can go on for a long time. Don't lie
      waiting to be hit with your face turned up--keep your head tucked in,
      because although newspapers will not damage you, getting a smart rap
      across the nose is no fun. Keep your target small and keep very quiet.
    </P>
    
    <P> The game can be very exciting and hilarious, because the looks of
      concentration on the players' faces as they listen for movement to
      indicate where they should strike puts expressions on their faces you are
      not likely to have ever seen before. </P>
    
    <P> You can take the game to extremes by introducing oriental vibes all the
      way through: bowing to the opponent and the judge, and making a ceremony
      of putting on the blindfolds and picking up the sticks, etc. </P>
