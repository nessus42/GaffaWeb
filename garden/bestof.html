<P>[The following thirteen lines were written by Kate in 1980 to accompany the
sheet-music for the collection of songs published in the book <CITE>The Best of
Kate Bush</CITE>.]  
</P>
<P>Babooshka: &quot;The games we play--boredom breeds suspicion.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Wuthering Heights: &quot;Cathy will live on as a force. I was lucky she
stopped in me long enough to write a song.&quot; 
</P>
<P>December Will Be Magic Again: &quot;Remember when you couldn't sleep from
the excitement of the Eve, and it was always white even without snow? That's
when it was fun.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Hammer Horror: &quot;Alone on a film set at night with just one spotlight.
But who is that in the shadows?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Them Heavy People: &quot;Knock, knock, who's there?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Saxophone Song: &quot;All the people in the club are babbling, but the
instrument is talking, and I can but listen.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh England, My Lionheart: &quot;don't disturb the clover that grows on the
past.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Army Dreamers: &quot;Poor old ego, trying to find a way to be butch and
brave, only to find reality is the challenge.&quot; 
</P>
<P>James and the Cold Gun: It's hot and sandy, the land is old and dry. Here
rides a man with a sheet of ice by his side.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Don't Push Your Foot on the Heart Brake: &quot;Streetlights reflecting on
black leather, on upholstery.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Breathing: &quot;Inspiring...expiring...out...&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Man With the Child in His Eyes: &quot;Even when I look into the eyes of
a man aged eighty I can sometimes see the gleeful glint of a child.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Wow: &quot;See the diamond glitter through the rock.&quot; 
</P>
