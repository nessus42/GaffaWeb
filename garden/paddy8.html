<P>[Here is Paddy's eighth article for the Newsletter. It appeared in issue
number 14 (summer 1983).]

<H3>Pad's Bit</H3>
<P>I'm a night owl. I live in London. It's so noisy, most of my working happens
towards the end of the day. The World Service of the BBC keeps me company,
broadcasting into the early hours, as was the case the other night. Sarah
Kennedy was reading a request from an Eskimo, who asked what singles Kate had
out and what was she doing? The voice of London cut through the snowflakes with
the reply: &quot;...Kate's last single was There Goes a Tenner, and now she's
back at the drawing board coming up with a new album...&quot; This image seems
quite appropriate. We've all been working on improvements, otherwise things
couldn't progress. Kate's back into her writing pattern. Long passage of
uninterrupted playing--with dance training for recreation--and all better than
ever before. Her latest material is so good that it's going to be hard to sort
out what not to include on the next album. 
</P>
<P> I've been playing one or two unusual things: harps from the African
forests, bagpipes from Northumberland, temple drums from India and, since The
Dreaming, quite a lot of dijeridu. This is due to Rolf Harris's kindness. He
made it possible by giving me some lessons and an instrument....Sometimes I play
it for so long I see wallabies. 
</P>
<P> Some people have asked me what the deep sound on the chorus of The Dreaming
is. Reference to the sleeve notes reveals the words &quot;bull roarer&quot;. It
makes a sound like a motorcycle or an aeroplane propellor. It's sometimes
described as a &quot;spirit voice&quot; A bull roarer is very easy to make from
a ruler and a string about one metre long. Make a small hole about half an inch
from one end of the ruler and tie the string on very tightly. Now take it
outside, hold one end of the string and whirl the ruler round and round your
head. It will start spinning and winding the string up like a rubber
band-powered aeroplane. After a couple of orbits the string has twisted up so
much that it releases all its stored energy suddenly by unwinding very fast, and
the result is a rhythmic growl that feels as though it comes from everywhere.
But take warning. String can snap under the extreme stresses, as did the one on
The Dreaming, and if you listen to the track you can hear it hitting one of the
soundproof screens at Abbey Road. Wait 'til we do it on stage...[We're waiting.]
I've roughly calculated that rows seven to fifteen are most at risk. But don't
worry, I'll take a spare just in case. 
</P>
<P> Back to the drawing board stuff. I'm standing in front of it now and
writing on a tiny little section of it marked &quot;Tour of Life II&quot;. I've
just written &quot;Take spare bull roarer&quot;. There is so much information
written on the old drawing board--a little bit gets added every day--that the
more we add the larger it becomes, so by now our drawing board is both vast and
complex. I'm sure you can imagine some of the things. Staves and dots plot the
routes for our musical cargo ships. Little black footprints and matchstick men
show the paths up choreographic mountain-ranges. Cave paintings and computer
graphics, next year's colours, satellite information. All this and things just
too secret to mention contribute to our vibrational data-bank. Even as I write I
can see Andrew (or is it J.?) skating over from the Newsletter section with a
huge file of your suggestions. The odd question about mammoth-tusk xylophones
and central African nose-tubes--you really do write some interesting things. I
haven't checked the pidgeon-postbox yet, that's always good for a laugh.
Actually, we've found them a very economical and discreet method of postal
dispatch. In fact this very Newsletter may have been one of the lucky thousand
to be sent this way. We're coming up with new ideas all the time, and we just
write them down on the very drawing board that is now getting mentions on radio
networks worldwide. Anyway, enough of my idle ramblings. I'm giving much too
much away and I've got to finish this kangaroo costume before our dawn jog, so
keep running up that hill.
