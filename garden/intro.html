<P>[The following article was written by Sue Hudson, an editor for the British
magazine <CITE>Hi-Fi &amp; Record Review</CITE>. It appeared in their December
1985 issue. Ms. Hudson's article may not be accurate in every detail, but it's
one of the most heartfelt brief statements about Kate to have appeared in a
mainstream British publication to date. I felt it would be a nice way to begin
this volume. Edited by

<H3>The Back Page</H3>
<P><EM>by Sue Hudson</EM> 
</P>
<P> We've been holding our breath for a long time. Three years of playing the
old songs and wondering &quot;whatever next?&quot; Would it be even weirder than
The Dreaming? Would it leave more admirers by the wayside, shaking their heads?

</P>
<P> The real fans will happily go along for the ride, even if she isn't going
the pretty way. For Kate journeys into new and exciting territories. She is an
original in a music world dominated by cover versions, regressive movements and
identikit superstars. The direct opposite of the archetypal rock star:
compulsively introvert in a world of screaming extraverts, middle-class and
deeply English amid England's all-pervasive working class American ethos, boldly
feminine in rock's macho climate. Her melodic genius and articulate lyrics make
the rest seem moronically simplistic. Her instrumentation is far removed from
the traditional guitar/drum-kit set-up and predictable synthesizer riffs.
Instead, she brews a heady mixture of musique concrete, multi-tracked chorus and
acoustic instruments from the dijeridu to the balalaika; all skillfully
appropriated to produce precisely calculated effects. Her lyrics are also
multi-diverse. After a thousand songs on the theme of
boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl or Thatcher's Britain, exposure to her music comes
as an imaginative release as we go giddily flying into the limitless
possibilities of the poetic viewpoint. Here is talk of whales, of Peter Pan,
kites, Houdini, mysticism... 
</P>
<P> Acquaintances have observed, &quot;She lives in a world of her own.&quot;
But it's a world that lives within all of us, and her songs shine light into
neglected areas of our minds. Using imagery nostalgically familiar to fellow
Englanders, her subjects come tripping from library shelves, television and
cinema screens and musty books of fairy tales, the stuff that dreams are made
of. She spins tunes that haunt, twist and turn the mind, triggering long
forgotten moods. Listening intently to her albums is an experience akin to
having a lucid and feverish dream. Jungian symbols of youth, innocence,
spiritual escape and the dark, feminine realm abound. Ghosts haunt the black
vinyl grooves. Uncanny intimations disturb the sensitive. The spirit of Peter
Pan hovers over her work, sometimes overtly, as in In Search of Peter Pan, but
also covertly, as a yearning for the human closeness and heightened awareness of
youth. The plangeant beauty of Irish and English folksong lies at the heart of
the music, working its ancient magic. Magic, too, is the rich Celtic blood that
Kate shares with so many poets and spell-weavers. 
</P>
<P> But it's not all brooding intensity. There are jokes, too, some
Ealingesque: movie-obsessed bank robbers break into <CITE>The Dreaming</CITE>,
there's a Brechtian romp through Arsenic and Old Lace country in <CITE>Coffee
Homeground</CITE> and those &quot;Darling, you were wonderful!&quot; theatrics
from <CITE>Wow</CITE>. Teasing seduction has produced some adorable songs, a
poet's sensuality perfuming the lyrics. Images of silk and lace, flickering
candlelight, white rosebushes in a storm, dusty ivy, plaiting hair by the fire,
ravish the mind's eye. 
</P>
<P> But don't imagine that her music is &quot;wet.&quot; When multi-layered
sonic collage, Kate's own spectacular vocal tricks and chant-like Oriental
rhythms combine at the ends of the more fey tracks, the effect can be as
power-packed as the heaviest metal. The use of Eastern borrowings in odd
harmonies and interlocking, unfamiliar rhythms opens up and strengthens the
Romanticism. The lyrics, too, have Oriental influences, in the shape of
Gurdjieff--a Sufic guru whose strange terminology and mystic psychology are a
recurring motif. While it must baffle most listeners, it does lend a suitably
mysterious distancing to her deeply personal songs, sharpening an image that
threatens to become too sweet. It's a mischievous paradox that, while rock at
its ultra-macho best is exhilarating and energizing, yet just at the moment when
it is most strident and loud it leaves you needing something more.  Then along
comes a shy doctor's daughter from Welling who out-screams the best, out-powers
the noisiest and tops it with the satisfying impact of musical and psychological
depth. It's almost Wagnerian. 
</P>
<P> In a sense, the music is retrospective, since it uses the English/Irish
folk idiom that went, via country-and-western, to make up rock and roll. The
blues/gospel element of Kate's &quot;rock&quot; music is very minor. The rhythms
are more often Oriental or old-European than African--waltzes, jigs and ragas.
So, to the European and the Eastern ear, Kate's music has a sweet familiarity,
especially for the British, who learn their folksongs in school and still sing
hymns and carols in the traditional settings. 
</P>
<P> Her talent was precocious. <CITE>The Saxophone Song</CITE> and <CITE>The
Man With the Child in His Eyes</CITE> were recorded as demo tapes when Kate was
still at school. The first album, <CITE>The Kick Inside</CITE> (1978), caused
tremendous media interest and is still the public's favourite. Her voice,
criticized at the time, was small and childlike, the range erratic, if
impressive. Since then it has improved enormously, deepening and gaining power
and flexibility, until now it is a great asset, individual and capable of both
subtle and stunning effects. The fleshing out of the basic material has also
improved with experience, the moods becoming more atmospherically defined, with
more sophisticated instrumentation and extrapolation of themes. 
</P>
<P> The second album, <CITE>Lionheart</CITE>, was made at the height of her
popularity and is almost extravert in tone, with a strong dash of theatricality.
Its hit-that-never-was, <CITE>Hammer Horror</CITE>, has fun with the ghosts and
ghouls that lurk in the dark corners of her more sombre songs. <CITE>Symphony
in Blue</CITE> is optimistic and self-affirming. The title track is a beautiful
lullaby for a sleeping nation. 
</P>
<P> The album <CITE>Never For Ever</CITE> came next and starts in happy mood,
with a summer night of a cha-cha-cha tribute to a new-found hero, Delius. The
philosophic <CITE>All We Ever Look For</CITE> creates a remarkable and rare
mood of reassurance and upbeat resignation, a Bush specialty. We end Side One
with a hippy tour of Egypt, but Side Two plunges straight into gloom with a
violent Western. The dark continues with the shiveringly ghostly <CITE>The
Infant Kiss</CITE>, based on Henry James's The Turn of the Screw, and the
bittersweet <CITE>Army Dreamers</CITE>, with its ingenious use of waltz time.
The end comes in the horrifying <CITE>Breathing</CITE>, a vision of the nuclear
holocaust through the eyes of an unborn child. 
</P>
<P> On to <CITE>The Dreaming</CITE>, a strange, alien album full of mysticism
and obscurantae. Its impact owes much to sheer production quality. Kate has
gradually taken over this aspect of her records since <CITE>Lionheart</CITE>,
and each LP is technically more impressive. Her voice here is forward and strong
and, on <CITE>Leave It Open</CITE>, deliberately distorted to create a surreal
effect. <CITE>Get Out of My House</CITE> is a shattering trip into madness,
with a stunning culmination which finds Kate braying like a mule amid a chorus
of Indian drum talk. 
</P>
<P> The new album, <CITE>Hounds of Love</CITE>, breaks new ground for Kate
with the b-side. This is a story -- <CITE>The Ninth Wave</CITE> -- told in a
series of songs, like a Pink Floyd concept album. Free from the necessity of
setting a fresh context for each track, the lyrics are more spare, more integral
to the music, and her talent blossoms. The strong storyline, with its
claustrophobic, mystic theme, has possibilities beyond a mere side, as do many
of Kate's ideas. Such a fertile imagination is quite capable of keeping our
interest in one situation for an hour, or longer. Her musicianship is now
skilled and inventive enough to sustain more instrumental episodes and linking
themes. And as mistress of mood, she has the right combination of talents to
stretch out beyond the limiting confines of pop into more &quot;operatic&quot;
form. 
</P>
<P> Casual listeners will miss the depth of the music. You must sit down with
the lyric sheet and find out what's going on. All the vocal acrobatics and weird
sounds click into place when you know what ideas, stories and situations they
are expressing. In most rock and pop, the music and words may be linked, but are
basically separate. Kate creates, more and more, a fusion between the two--the
sounds directly expressing the subject. This is a throwback to Wagner's
music-drama, with its leitmotifs, turning music into an idea. The Beatles
revived the technique, and bands of the hippy era like Pink Floyd carried the
banner. But only since the development of electronics, which put virtually the
whole world of sound at the fingertips of the &quot;player&quot; of a Fairlight,
has there been such flexibility to allow individuality and encourage creativity.
Kate is fast becoming a master in the use of this sonic montage, perhaps because
the ideas she is using are far more complex, have more &quot;resonances&quot;,
than those of her contemporaries. 
</P>
<P> But Kate will never be an academic artist, drily applying intellectual
music theory to the delight of a handful of peers, forging into new areas for
the sake of &quot;progress&quot;. Her style is personal, individual,
impressionistic. Like Delius, her music will always flow from poetic necessity,
breaking from the confines of tradition because expression demands it. I just
hope that she will have the confidence to follow her instincts and not be
discouraged by the music press, who in the main are baffled and annoyed by her
uniqueness. Unable to pigeon-hole her music, they turn instead to ridicule and
condescension to fill the pages. Which is a disservice to the British public
who, to their undying credit, have made Kate Bush such a popular success.
