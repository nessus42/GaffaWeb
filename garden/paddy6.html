    <P>[Here is Paddy's sixth article for the Newsletter. It appeared in issue

    <H3>Noel Noel?</H3>
    
    <P>It's December again, and how do you find me this chilly month? Well, I'm
      surrounded by my recent musical instrument projects: bagpipes, Indonesian
      mouth-harps, and a few ancient Egyptian temple instruments. There are
      little heaps of crumpled paper scattered over the whole of the floor, they
      are Christmas lists for Kate. What am I going to get her? I hear some of
      you shout something like Chocolate Elephants--come now, wouldn't that be a
      bit predictable? What a dilemma! </P>
    
    <P> I could give her something really, really weird, like a reproduction of
      a sixteenth-century royal Viennese court tartold, but believe me, even
      something as crazy as that is still predictable for me. It's not as if
      it's easy. Kate as you know is a vegetarian so any presents like leather
      coats, pork chops, etc., are out. I can just see it now...rustle rustle &quot;Ooh
      look! It's a...&quot; rustle... &quot;cabbage...Oh, thank you.&quot; You
      just can't give vegetarians vegetables for Christmas. The hours tick by,
      the piles of paper accumulate--maybe a vegetable rack, no she's got one, a
      carrot knife, a leek mulcher, or why not a turnip-condensing unit? Maybe a
      computer-aided marrow-stuffer, that might take a little too long to come
      from Switzerland, and it would sit around unused for months until marrows
      came back into season. </P>
    
    <P> Hard, isn't it? </P>
    
    <P> What about something to do with dancing? Some shoes, maybe...
      right...she doesn't wear them--says it doesn't feel natural. Maybe some
      mirrors--how can I get them down her chimney? Anyway, she's got mirrors
      when she dances with Gary and Stewart. Did you know that Gary and Stewart
      have their own dance group now--you must look out for them, they're called
      The Dance Theatre of London, and are doing shows all over the country and
      are getting lots of mentions in the press. </P>
    
    <P> Did you see Kate on Desmond Morris's Friday Night and Saturday Morning?
      Wasn't she great? I could buy her a collection of his books, but as you
      can guess, she's already read them all. [Morris is a zoologist, and has
      written numerous books about the behaviour of cats, dogs and other
      animals.] I know you all think I'm joking, and I'm just making all this
      up, and what I'm really going to do is go out and buy some sophisticated
      electronic musical gadgetry like a Digital Real-Time Quantum On-Line
      H.A.R.P. Ballistic Sequential Processor, but like all these things, there
      is such a long waiting-list, and of course--she's already got one! </P>
    
    <P> The hands on the clock creep round. I try playing the bagpipes for
      inspiration--soon the sound of broom handles and other heavy blunt
      household objects can be heard on the ceiling, floor and walls. I can hear
      voices crying things like &quot;Are you strangling a cat or something?&quot;
      and &quot;I can't stand it...argh!&quot; Ah me, it's tough trying to write
      Christmas lists. So this December the 25th, when you unwrap Santa's
      parcels to find that he has left you a new dumper-truck or a
      snake-charming kit, think of me as I try and wrap this giraffe in paper
      with &quot;Noel Noel&quot; written all over it--Kate likes giraffes and it
      fits down the chimney a real treat--well, almost. I tried earlier when she
      was out. Desmond said try the head first, but it isn't quite as easy as he
      said it would be. Nevertheless I think I have solved my problem of a
      Christmas surprise for her--just picture her face when she unwraps my
      lumpy, long, soot-covered parcel... </P>
    
    <P> Well, with this joyous seasonal image in mind, I'll take the
      opportunity to wish you all the Christmas of a lifetime and a New Year
      full of geng-gongs and sistrums. And also may I say thanks for reading
      this very important and serious article. I know some of you study my
      writings very deeply, looking for cleverly hidden meanings of great
      relevance and extreme significance, so I hope this little excursion into
      the pros and cons of ethnic intergenerational corporate celebratory
      exchange as personified by Quasi-post-Deluvian Romano-Christian followings
      has been of some interest to you. Hopefully the hardback edition should be
      available in the coming year, providing our Alaskan publishers aren't
      snowed under with advance orders. </P>
