<P>[Here is Paddy's ninth article for the Newsletter. It appeared in the
fifteenth issue (Chrismas 1983).]

<P> Sometimes it's tough working on the staff of an international newspaper. I
get a lot of pressure. This morning my editor informed me the presses had ground
to a halt and picket lines were starting to form outside the K.T. Times... and
all because I couldn't come up with a subject for this issue. I explained that
it had to be about musical instruments and...Christmas. But what a problem: what
are Christmas instruments? and how can I find out fast? I could hear distant
jeers and murmurs from outside. Looking down from the fifteenth floor I could
see angry print-workers turning away a Chocolate Elephant delivery. My editor,
having abandoned his pleading, was standing on his desk swinging a large
duffle-bag full of Newsletters round and round his head. He was practising his
power bull roarer technique, I suppose quite a sensible thing to do in
high-pressure situations such as these. I had, however, failed to notice him and
as I backed away from the window an idea struck me. 
</P>
<P> When a 65-pound duffle-bag hits you square in the head you can see pretty
little stars and in your ears you hear the sounds of bells...These are my
Christmas instruments. 
</P>
<P> When I lived in Whitechapel in the east of London, my home was very near
the oldest bell foundry in Europe. It is a wonderful place. One winter I watched
them casting hand-bells: a liquid firework display of shooting stars when the
wet bell-moulds, buried in sand, spit out hot metal. White-haired craftsmen
looking like Swiss watchmakers then take the rough-cast bell and spin it on a
lathe, cutting the final shape and turning it simultaneously. The bell actually
sings as it turns against the cutter; spiral slivers of bell-metal cascade onto
the floor; the rough outside turns to sparkling gold; the pitch of the bell
gradually rises...The art is knowing when to stop. When hand-bells are played,
six people may take two bells each, and playing their respective bells in the
right places, music appears that actually moves from person to person. It is a
totally different dimension of sound. 
</P>
<P> About this time some Christmases ago, we were in Abbey Road studios
recording December; we musicians sat outside the control-room waiting for our
various turns to go in and record our contributions. There was a lot to do: Al
and Brian's guitar duo [Alan Murphy and Brian Bath], Preston's Christmas
percussion and reindeer bells. I was working on my balalaika part and how to
sing &quot;fall&quot; backwards when Kate told me that she had managed to find
some hand- bells and they would be delivered that evening. And within a couple
of hours Thunderclap Newmann appeared with a set of bells that once belonged to
Keith Moon. He had bought them in India, and here they were. Everybody took a
bell or two and we played. The clock ticked by. One at a time the bell-ringers
dispersed to their other roles. Brian and Al went into the studio together and,
placing their amplifiers face to face, they stood on top of them and played, and
gradually, player by player, December became magic. We were working to a heavy
time schedule and, although Keith's Moon-bells didn't feature on the track,
whenever I hear December it is their sound that comes to mind most strongly.
Maybe some day we will get the opportunity to hear these bells from the stars
again. 
</P>
<P> Enough of this nostalgia, have you made your bull roarer yet? If you're not
interested, just think what a wonderful Christmas present it might make for
somebody else weirder than you. Some of the original instruments are very highly
decorated, often with exotic feathers which contribute to their fantastic sound.

</P>
<P> My present to Kate is always a problem. Last year was very successful. She
thought the giraffe was quite funny. I hope I am not sticking my neck out too
far by saying that. This year? Well, I'm not going to give the game away so
easily, although a clue might appeal to you. It's a sonorous metallic
poly-expidential kinetic di-cyclic audio-communicator, weighing 12 1/2
tons--original, don't you think? Anyway, thank you all for your wonderful
presents and letters, you are very much in my thoughts this Christmas. I hope
you are warm and safe and happy and that your rejoicings proceed free from
technical hitches and concussion. Who knows? Next year a certain big brother
might have a few surprises for you from his duffle bag of weirdness. Until then,
keep running up that hill still.
