    <H3>Memoirs of an Army Dreamer</H3>
    
    <P>The sky is white, the weather's cold and, as December appears, the
      sleigh-bells of a balalaika Christmas jingle closer. I love this time of
      year, especially as I have just been discharged from the Chocolate
      Elephant Addiction Clinic--apparently the praline levels in my bloodstream
      went up so dramatically since issue number 6 that I had to undergo special
      anti-confection therapy. Anyway, that's all behind me now, although things
      did get out of hand: I was spending all my money on Chocolate Elephants. I
      couldn't get enough of them. They even started arriving in the post. It
      got to the point where I could identify the familiar rattle of a parcel
      containing one, and I would consume it without even hesitating to unwrap
      it. How much lower could I stoop?... </P>
    
    <P>About a month ago Andrew and I hijacked a huge T.I.R. lorry in Brussels
      full of Chocolate Elephants. We took turns--one driving whilst the other
      mooched around in the back. The idea was to drive to EMI Manchester Square
      in London and use their postage-franking machine to send a Chocolate
      Elephant to all the people that have written in to us showing interest in
      these matters. Anyway, we bribed the border guards with a fistful of
      Bouchees and couple of KT sweatshirts, but by the time we got to Ostend,
      Andrew was in a state of chocolate paralysis and could be heard murmuring
      something about a Berlin bar. I was driving; the cab had filled up with
      wrappers. I could hear the rustling sounds from the real lorry driver, who
      we had tied up with some old video-tapes. He had worked his gag loose and
      was trying to convince me that all this was not a good idea. His English
      was not good, but as he chomped on a couple of Elephants that I had missed
      in the turmoil, he told me that what I needed was a jolly good haircut and
      that a short spell in the army would not do me any harm. </P>
    
    <P>Three men in uniform crouch together, their backs pressed against the
      wall. A silhouette of a huge violin with arms and legs looms above them.
      They are draped in camoufflage, black smudges on their faces,
      trigger-fingers at the ready. I am the guy in the middle, Andrew is on my
      right. He's dressed as a British Army Sergeant--he has a plastic pistol in
      his hand. Gary is on my left, he has a tin hat on his head and is giving
      me cover with his automatic. </P>
    
    <P>The silhouette gets bigger, it spins and turns to reveal Kate holding a
      double bass. These are the closing bars of Babooshka, whilst we wait to
      perform the live TV version of Army Dreamers. The scene is Veronica TV
      studios in Holland. There is a small audience of three hundred or so, and
      we are crouched down low so they can't see. They applaud as Kate rushes
      off stage to make a quick change. A d.j. is saying something about Kate in
      fast-flowing Dutch, occasionally dropping the odd Wuthering Heights and
      Man With the Child every now and then. A camera is pointed at him, its red
      light on. A couple of the audience gasp as Gary and I rush out into the
      recording area to take our positions. I must admit we look pretty mean.
      The d.j. concludes his intro., the light on his camera goes out-- click,
      click--this evening we are the singing, dancing Army Dreamers. Just over
      three minutes nineteen seconds later we are back in our dressing-room.
    </P>
    
    <P>&quot;Aha!&quot; cried Interpol as they crashed through the door. It was
      no use, the game was up: chocolate fingerprints everywhere, and a trail of
      wrappers leading all the way from the lorry in the car-park straight to
      the dressing-room marked &quot;Kate Bush Tanzers&quot;. It would never
      have occurred to me that they would mistake our prop army uniforms for the
      real thing, but as there was a NATO exercise on that weekend we convinced
      them that we were nothing to do with the band but had just dropped in to
      get Kate, Gary, Andrew and Paddy's autographs. They were very annoyed and
      drove off quickly in the direction of the Belgian border, leaving us
      somewhat surprised at our good fortune. </P>
    
    <P>But enough of all this. May I be so bold as to remove my
      chocolate-coated tongue from my cheek and take this opportunity to say &quot;thank
      you&quot; to all of you for taking Never For Ever to number one in the
      charts here in the UK; and I hope that your Christmas stockings overflow
      with what you'd hoped they'd overflow with. And when you hear December,
      the single this Christmas, I hope that, like the big animals that live in
      the jungle with large, hairy, floppy ears and long snootlike appendages
      (reputed for their even longer memories), you won't forget that we made
      this one for you. </P>
    
    <P> Paddy </P>
