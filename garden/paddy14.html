<H3>Pad's Good Food Guide to London</H3>
<P>The other afternoon I found myself in a small Albanian cafe sipping tea and
enjoying the clarinets, when I was suddenly presented with a note by the waiter.
It was from Kate. I've always admired the Albanians' sense of rhythm and timing,
it seems so unique--perhaps not to everyone's taste, but to me it often sounds
somewhat like Irish music but with some very unusual twists and turns. I read
Kate's letter. It said that she was going to be late. The band was playing some
really fast music now. The Tupan player was excelling himself by bashing out
rhythms like a machine-gun on one side of his drum and on the other skin an
intriguing, complicated slower beat that repeated every two minutes fifteen
seconds. You really need a watch to truly appreciate Albanian music. Most of
them live till they are 120 years old, so don't be too surprised if they measure
time differently from us. There was a small map on the other side of Kate's
note. It showed me how to get to a new little Japanese vegetarian restaurant. It
was about twenty minutes away. Kate was going to be there in half an hour, so on
with my raincoat and into the drizzly streets of London. Not far from Covent
Garden I thought I could hear a familiar sound that gradually rose above the
traffic rumble...the gentle jingling of many tiny bells. Was it the Hare Krishna
guys? Every now and then the odd percussive sound like a rifle-shot would ring
out. Perhaps it was some Chinese new-year celebration. As I drew closer to the
source, I imagined I'd see some huge Oriental dragon-type structure being
carried on the heads of twenty Kung-Fu practitioners, but instead I saw what
looked like a cricket team involved in some kind of formation jumping-ritual. 
</P>
<P> Every now and then they would hit each other with their bats and shout,
then back to the jumping. They all had bells on their legs; it sounded lovely.
There were a lot of people around that day, and it had started to rain quite
heavily. I concluded that this must be the reason behind the dancing cricketers,
and that they could probably stay in quite good condition by doing this when
they found themselves rained off their favourite pitch. By now the rain had
turned to hail and its pitter-patter rhythm doubled its timing and became the
thundering fast roll of a snare drum. Large hailstones were now bouncing so high
that they slowly filled my pockets. I followed Kate's little map through the
covered area of the market. There were a lot of street performers that day. The
sound of the storm beating out explosions on the roof literally drowned any
music that was being made, so everybody stopped what they were doing and watched
the mime artists. Everyone except myself... 
</P>
<P> Cue sound of large gong...I have arrived on time at the inscrutable
Japanese emporium &quot;Soto Kasi's&quot;. &quot;Hello, Mr. Bush, may I take
your hat and coat and er...ear-protectors?&quot; said the exquisitely beautiful
waitress. I said &quot;Excuse me?&quot; She removed my ear-defenders and
repeated her greeting. I said &quot;Thank you. It's very loud out there today!&quot;
She smiled understandingly and took my coat. 
</P>
<P> The music started. Two Shamisen players, a drummer and three girl singers,
wonderful. My waitress led me to a little table near the stage. I sat entranced,
all eyes and ears. She poured some tea and asked me, &quot;Do you like Japanese
music?&quot; Her English was impeccable.     I was very excited. I love the
sound of the Shamisen and Japanese Min-Yo music has some of the catchiest tunes
ever written, so I replied in Japanese something to the effect of &quot;Honourable
Madam, pray permit this humble creature to answer your question...Does not the
bright river-kingfisher or the tall, majestic crane not cravest for the Golden
Halibut of the Sun?&quot; Her smile flickered for an instant. I was thinking
that maybe I had placed the odd word in the wrong place and perhaps the meaning
of my complimentary little speech had gone adrift...when there was an enormous
crash of cymbals. I glanced at the stage. The girls had stopped singing and were
staring curiously over my shoulder. I turned and looked over by the hat-stand.
Near the door was a Japanese waiter. He was sat on the floor and was wearing a
hat made from seaweed that was slowly dripping down his face. Around him the
debris of a once-airborne vegetarian meal now lay scattered on the floor like a
delicate chain of islands in a coral sea of spinach, rice and slippery, white,
little chunks of ice that looked a bit like hailstones. How very curious. 
</P>
<P> Inscrutably the Shamisen and drummer went into a real favourite number of
mine called &quot;Long Live Eo&quot;, which is a fan dance with a fantastic
tune. Another waitress appeared to my right with a telephone on a small tray.
She placed it on the table, bowed and backed away cautiously. I picked up the
phone. &quot;Hello, Kate.&quot; &quot;Hello, Pad. I'm still at the Dance Centre.
Why don't we meet at Poona's in ten minutes?&quot; &quot;Good idea!&quot; I
said, and no sooner had I replaced the receiver and stood up when I found myself
back on the streets of Covent Garden. The storm had passed and it was sunny now,
and all the street performers were back in full swing. The sound of bagpipes was
maybe the easiest sound to pick out above the turmoil. As I got closer I could
see a bloke wearing a tartan skirt and socks jumping up and down over a pair of
very sharp, long swords. Most original, I thought, and placed my hand in my
pocket to drop a coin in his tam when I found it was full of water. Oh well. 
</P>
<P> Anyway, cue sound of finger running down a quarter-tone scale on the
sitar's sympathetic strings. Yes, I have arrived at Poona's. It's busy tonight.

</P>
<P> &quot;Hello, Mr. Bush, may I take your coat and earwarmers?&quot; Great
clouds of steam billow from my pockets. I love English weather, it's so
unpredictable. Here at Poona's there were large white rotating fans hanging from
the ceiling, and huge green palms, jasmine and rubber plants. This wonderful
Oriental atmosphere was truly brought alive by the addition of real music. The
tamboura provided the background sound like a ten-bar electric fire. The tabla
beat a bubbling pitter-patter matrix of raindrops, and the sitar...warm,
intellectual, convoluted and toothpaste-shaped sound... It was tremendous. 
</P>
<P> Over by the coat-stand it was beginning to look like a Swedish sauna bath.
A waiter laden with four or five trays of food balanced precariously on his arms
suddenly made a flamboyant entrance from the kitchen straight into the sauna.
His glasses instantly steamed up. I couldn't watch. Instead I watched the face
of another waiter who was bringing a tray to my table. His mouth dropped wide
open as his eyes followed the track of ballistic curries as they struck the fan
on the ceiling. Flying-saucer popadoms bounced off the ornately decorated mirror
surrounds. The other waiter placed his tray on my table and lifted up one of
those silver domes with a handle on it, while bits of lettuce and cucumber fell
from the ceiling and decorated the telephone that he had brought me. I groped
through the salad and picked up the receiver...&quot;Hello, Pad?&quot; &quot;Hello,
Katey, how's things?&quot; &quot;O.K., thanks. Look, I've been delayed again. Do
you know that little Peruvian restaurant off the Edgeware Road?&quot; &quot;Yep!
See you there.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Into a cab. Cabby--cheerful, chirpy, Cockney--sings jolly improvisations to
some Vaughn Williams playing on Radio 3. Cab arrives. Cue Peruvian music. &quot;Hello,
Mr. Bush, etc.&quot; Two pan-pipers, one charanga player, three
vocalists--brilliant. Kate arrives-- incredible. Order food--no problems. Food
arrives--delicious. Music plays--tremendous. The bill arrives--most reasonable.
Hats, coats--so far so good. &quot;Thank you, sir, thank you, madam, adios mes
amigos, call again&quot;--seems too easy. Put hand in pocket, feel for
ear-defenders--find a big gun and bullets instead. Oops, wrong coat. Newspaper
clippings in other pocket... &quot;Murderous Psychopath On Rampage In Edgeware.&quot;
Back in restaurant, huge gorilla of a man, sticking out of my little coat, seems
to have been rummaging in my pockets...looking for something that he doesn't
seem to be able to find. His fingers are covered in spinach and the distinctive
yellow stains of vindaloo sauce. His face is red...I am faced with a
dilemma...Should I go to that charming little Swiss bistro in Kilburn with live
Alp-hornist and yodelling trio...or should we go on to Skinks and catch the
cabaret? I wonder what your choice would be?
