<P>[Here is Kate's article for the tenth issue (summer 1981).]

<H3>&quot;On Videos and Tapes&quot;</H3>
<P>I've been lucky enough to be tucked away in the studio through all the
riots, and only catching the muggy weather in between sounds. I hope everything
has been good for you during this summerless time. We all know that &quot;things
they are a-changing.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Piecing the album together is becoming like a big musical jigsaw, and we're
only halfway through. One particular phase at Abbey Road became bizarre, as
recording plus video met at the same point in time, and at the same place. We'd
been working on two tracks in the studio, just taking the odd day and evening
out for rehearsals; and with getting in early for meetings, it was a very busy
time for everybody. [One of these tracks is Sat In Your Lap, for which the video
was taped at Abbey Road. The first single for the new album, it had not yet been
released when Kate wrote this part of her article, although it had come out by
the time the Newsletter reached fans. The other track Kate refers to is Night of
the Swallow (see below).] Some days became very unreal, as, while going for a
cup of tea you would swear you heard the sound of tinkling bells as the tip of
the brightly coloured jester's hat disappeared around the corner. And once when
I ran out into the corridor, what should whizz by but a dunce on roller-skates
chased by four bulls who were being followed by a flying book and an unbelieving
door attendant. 
</P>
<P>The video was filmed over two days, one part at a video studio, the other at
the audio studios. The former provided the quick, easy technical sides to be
performed, the latter provided the space and presence. The large parquet floor
was to be a feature, and Abbey Road's past, full of dancing and singing spirits,
was to be conjured up in the present day by tapping feet to the sound of jungle
drums--only to be turned into past again through the wonder of video-tape. The
shots were sorted into a logical order: all long shots were audio studio, all
others were video studio. A storyboard was drawn up and was very closely worked
to, being hung on the wall on days of shootings. The editing was a long,
difficult job, as it was comprised of many sections which had to be edited
together (just like the big musical one). The editor worked all day and into the
next morning with great skill and patience, and only when someone told us did we
find out it had been his birthday and he'd worked it all away. 
</P>
<P>One of the exciting things about making the video was the &quot;accessories&quot;
we used, such as the lovely costumes and props. The jerk-jacket which we used in
Army Dreamers was used again for a short sequence, and although there's a silver
wire, it feels like flying. Out of the harness and into the light of a timeless
tunnel, as a little magician's box springs to life and the room is filled with
laser and skaters. 
</P>
<P>Meanwhile the album was still in progress: we were working on backing
tracks. We used all three studios for one of them [ [ Night of the Swallow ]. It
started with feeding the drums down into the largest studio through speakers,
and with microphones positioned near to them they were brought back to the
control room of the studio we were working in, sounding very ambient. Then we
found the piano and initial drum sounds too dead, so we moved the drum kit and
musicians to another studio downstairs, where we preferred the sounds, and we
set up. After getting all the leads from upstairs connected to downstairs, there
was one very tired and worn-out engineer dedicatedly smiling through sleepy
eyes, closely tailed by an equally smiley and sleepy-eyed assistant. After all
our hard work, the backing track sounded great, and as the song is all about a
swallow flying over the water, it seemed only right to fly over to Ireland in a
big, shiny bird, into the arms of Planxty's magic. There for a day, due back too
soon, and the big bird wouldn't wait, so we worked all night. The pipes and
whistles swooped and dived, fiddles stole our souls away, and bouzoukis got us
up onto our feet and made us bolt the doors lest our souls flew away forever;
and by seven the next morning the track felt very proud of itself and there were
tears in our eyes as we heard it all back, and then were rushed back to London
on the metal-winged thing. 
</P>
<P>I went straight to the studio, and as I drooped over a hot cup of canteen
tea, my ears were full of pipes and what was yet to come--a sea of overdubs,
guitars, voices, instruments being whirled around and around, becoming an
aeroplane. And there was I, still back there, looking down at the Typhoo in my
china cup. 
</P>
<P>I hope I've managed to convey some of the wonderful things that have
happened, and I hope you catch the sun when it next pops out. 
</P>
<P>Lots of love, 
</P>
<P>Kate xx 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Thank you for the wonderful assortment of cards and presents that
you've all sent for my birthday, and I really do appreciate the fact that you
think of me. Sorry that I haven't been able to thank you personally, as I'm
really busy.
