<P>[Here are Kate's article and interview from issue number 17.] 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>This album all started last summer in my music room at home, with an
eight-track Soundcraft desk and tape machine, my piano and the Fairlight. 
</P>
<P>The first song I wrote started with a musical riff and Del programming a
Linn pattern. From that moment, the album &quot;process&quot; has steadily
rolled, and Del has been there from beginning to end. 
</P>
<P>The album has been treated as two halves: the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;
sides. The &quot;A&quot; side is five songs, the &quot;B&quot; side has a theme
linking several. When most of the songs were in some form, we moved from the
home studio to the &quot;big&quot; studio, and continued to demo the rest of the
songs. 
</P>
<P>It reached a stage where it was ready for drums, so I rang Paul Hardiman to
come and engineer, and Stuart Elliott to play on drums. 
</P>
<P>Paul is great to work with, a very good engineer: quick, and with a natural
feel for sounds. Stuart's drumming is the most emotional I know. He's always
interested in the songs and the lyrics, and has a way of creating the right mood
for the track. The most difficult thing was working out the compromises between
the Linn drum already there as the demo, and Stuart working with it, or indeed,
as in some cases, taking over completely but working to the Linn. 
</P>
<P>In some cases we keyed Stuart's sound off the Linn, it was the only way to
really make it sit. It some cases, we kept the Linn patterns and Stu worked in
some delicate toms around them. He broke plates and saucers for one track, and
became an army of military snares in another, sprinkling fairy dust hither and
thither. 
</P>
<P>The next stage was recording all the pianos. The home piano on the demos was
an &quot;upright&quot;, and not good enough quality for professional recording,
and so had to be replaced by a grand piano. Some of these tracks would be taken
to Ireland to do some work on. 
</P>
<P>We wanted a very delicate piano sound, these tracks being very empty and
sad. Paul went for a very live sound--reminiscent of Erik Satie, Chopin: the
empty ballroom after the party when everyone has gone home. 
</P>
<P>The next stage was some Fairlight, and concentration on the tracks that
would possibly go to Ireland within a few weeks' time. Rough B.V.s and lead
vocals were put down on these tracks, and copies of the twenty-four-track
masters were made by our maintenance man and cavalry in sticky situations: Jim
Jones--and a very nice chappy he is, too. 
</P>
<P>During the trip to Ireland, I hoped to write the lyrics for as many of the
songs as possible, a lot of it being little odds and ends, which are the hardest
to get, I suppose because you're so limited fitting in a couple of lines within
a context, rather than creating it from scratch. 
</P>
<P>However, the main reason for going was to work in Windmill Lane with Bill
Whelan. We met in London, and I played Bill the demos, and he started thinking
about ideas. 
</P>
<P>We agreed that we'd need a couple of weeks up front to go through all the
arrangements and sort out the musicians and studio time. Not only was Bill a
dream to work with, but he made us feel very at home, and we got to see Ireland
in a really fun way. We worked with Liam O'Flynn, a beautiful musician and
person, and Donal Lunny, whose spontaneity and ideas filled us all with awe. 
</P>
<P>Bill introduced us to John Sheahan, the fiddle player and multi-talented
musician from The Dubliners, who was like Santa Claus. He played a piece that
Bill had written, and it was so moving and he played so emotively that I started
to cry and felt silly, but what a nice experience. I highly recommend it! 
</P>
<P>One of the tracks we worked on was inspired by a discovery that Paddy had
made of a fascinating Greek ceremony that he managed to get on tape. He knew it
would get in to the inspiration centre, and that's what it did. We played the
tape to Bill, Liam, John and Donal; and Paddy, who was on his way to the West
Coast of Ireland to visit the Lakes, stayed with us in Dublin and joined in the
general fun, and as a non-stop shift of Irish musicians put the magic of their
race onto the songs, we danced and whooped in the control room. 
</P>
<P>We consumed the information from Pad's tape as much as we could. I'd only
finished writing the song the day before on Bill's piano while his wife brought
me cups of tea and biscuits (thank you, Mrs. Whelan). We used Bill
Somerville-Large as the engineer. He worked on the Irish sessions on the last
album. He has a way of bringing out the natural beauty of acoustic instruments,
and it's rare to find an engineer with perfect pitch! And we worked with a nice
man called &quot;Pearce&quot; as our assistant. 
</P>
<P>Windmill Lane is a great studio, very efficient; and they are all lovely
people. We all felt relaxed and happy, which is definitely the only way to feel
when recording and creating. 
</P>
<P>This track was built around John Sheahan. Bill conducted him, I played
chords on the piano and Donal played bodhran (a small Irish drum). We did this
in one studio, baffled off from each other. We got a good take quickly, and John
overdubbed fiddle. Then Donal overdubbed more drum and bouzouki; and then, John
playing whistle and Liam playing pipes, they jammed together on the jig that
Bill had written for the end of the track. Bill is very talented, as they all
are, and I think his arrangements and ideas are fantastic. It really is fun
working over there. 
</P>
<P>On returning to England we started again with Stuart to work on the tracks
from Ireland. Unfortunately we only had a limited time with Paul, as he was
committed for another album, but we had four clear weeks. 
</P>
<P>We started on some B.V.s, and did bits of Fairlight, and Paul's ideas for
sounds were invaluable not only then, but later on when Del came to work on my
vocals. 
</P>
<P>The next stage was bass guitars. Del played beautiful bass on some of the
tracks, knowing them as well as myself--I always find Del's ideas are so in tune
with the songs. And I asked Danny Thompson to play on one track and Eberhard
Weber to play on two of the songs. There are a few songs with no bass guitar at
all. 
</P>
<P>With Danny we used a quite live sound--you can hear him plucking and pulling
the strings in the ambient room, which we found attractive. Paul got a great
sound and balance between the sound of the bass and the ambience of the room,
and Danny got a fabulous feel for the track -- like a jungle cat, and very
moody. Danny is a very sensitive player, and again, he loves to know what the
track's about, and who or what he's meant to be; he has a real &quot;feel&quot;.

</P>
<P>Eberhard Weber came over to England for two days. I am a big fan of
Eberhard's, and it was really a pleasure to be working with him again. I'd sent
him a cassette up front, with lyrics and notes on the &quot;vibes&quot; of the
tracks, and he came prepared with manuscripts and ideas. One of the tracks was
demanding, as it required so much space: he used beautiful bowed notes that
sound like a plane, and in the other track he soars and dips like a stalking
panther...oooh, it's lovely. 
</P>
<P>Next came Paddy's bag of delights; the dijeridu, given to Pad by Rolf, was
captured, and joined the track that he'd originally sparked, so Australia joined
hand in hand with Greece, Ireland and England. 
</P>
<P>Next he played shimmering mandolins that waxed and waned. He sang, he
dijeridued, as ever waving the magic wand that only Pad can wave. 
</P>
<P>The next musician was John Williams. There was one track in particular which
I hoped he would play on. He was lovely to work with, and full of enthusiasm and
interesting stories, and it took very little time to get what he wanted. [Typo?
She probably means &quot;we&quot;.] (I've always dreamed of working with him.)
John played to a rhythm machine, which is not always easy when the track is
delicate and needs to sound light, but for him it proved no problem at all. Paul
got a beautiful sound in quite a live room and close-miked John's guitar, using
the ever favourite Neumann U87 microphone. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Paul's time was running out, and his commitment with another
album was due. It was an interesting situation. I had not really approached any
engineers, as we'd reached a stage where I needed to work on ideas and just
listen to the tracks and what we'd done up to that point. 
</P>
<P>There were still Fairlight ideas to put down, a couple of tracks 
</P>
<P>We were at a stage where I wanted to start on the vocals, to try and get as
many as possible done before I'd call in another engineer. The one outstanding
thing was a track that needed strings -- real strings. Admiring James Guthrie's
work on The Wall, I asked him if he'd engineer the session for us. 
</P>
<P>Luckily, he had a free day during a busy schedule, and I rang Dave Lawson to
confirm the date. (Dave arranged the strings on Houdini on the last album.) I
had written this song with Fairlight strings, and they need transcribing and
writing out for strings rather than a synthesiser. Dave suggested the &quot;Medicci&quot;
players,* and obviously I was into that. He thought a great deal about the
arrangement and &quot;construction&quot; of the sextet, and he decided on two
violins, two violas, two 'cellos, and was also present on the day to help out
with any changes in the scripts or any problems that might arise. 
</P>
<P>It was a big day for us, and it is always exciting working with strings, and
especially when they are such respected musicians. 
</P>
<P>It was an extremely hot, humid day, and between takes everyone would rush
outside to breath in the slightly less hot humid air before returning inside to
continue the recording. 
</P>
<P>We got a very warm, close sound, which was appropriate for the weather, and
James remained cool and calm, and the strings grew and grew, and everyone was
smiling. And I got an autographed &quot;Medicci&quot; album--it was great. James
is an extremely positive, talented engineer, and it was a pleasure to work with
him. 
</P>
<P>[*--&quot;Medicci&quot; players: I have checked all the UK musicians' union
records and found no listing for a &quot;Medicci&quot; group, but Kate's great
respect for the group makes it seem likely that she's talking about the Medici
String Quartet. The misspelling would not be the only one in the liner notes of
Kate's albums, as many fans have discovered... Working against this theory,
however, is the fact that Kate's part was arranged for sextet; but since the
six-part arrangement was apparently developed by Lawson independent of the
Medici players' own configuration, and since Kate describes how &quot;the
strings grew and grew&quot;, it seems pretty clear that overdubs were used. This
problem can best be resolved by the players themselves, of course.] 
</P>
<P>The next layer was voices. Del and I had been working a lot on voices on the
demo/masters (which were now really masters). Some of the voice sounds were
demanding, and some of the performances (especially from an emotional aspect)
were quite difficult. I really enjoy working with Del, I think especially on the
voices. I always feel very relaxed and uninhibited, which gives me a head start
compared to normal studio situations, where I'm fighting my nerves until I can
settle down. 
</P>
<P>We really did have a lot of work to cover, and in some cases I had to put
down the ideas and leave them for a few days in order to know what I really
thought about them. Coming back to them, I might want to play with them a
little--liking the basic idea, but needing to change it somehow. 
</P>
<P>The majority of the vocals were recorded using an 87 Neumann mike. Del has a
natural feel for the sounds I like, and has really good ideas, so he would get
the sound quickly, and the time would go on me getting the performances and us
experimenting with ideas. 
</P>
<P>In a couple of cases the B.V.s on the demos had just the right sound and
atmosphere, so we kept these and maybe added to them. Often &quot;demos&quot;
create problems like this, and that's why we decided to make the demos the basis
of the masters, keeping the feel, the speed, and keeping as many of the Linn
drums, Fairlights and voices as we could. 
</P>
<P>When we had covered a fair amount of ground, I contacted Haydn Bendall (who,
again, worked on the last album), and he came in to engineer. Haydn is a very
gentle, lovely person and we've been friends for years. Again the atmosphere was
relaxed, and Haydn set about cleaning up. We had lots of voices to bounce (which
means, for instance, taking four tracks of vocals and recording all four of them
onto another two tracks. Then we wipe the original four tracks, leaving us with
more to record on, and making the voices easier to handle in the mix.) We also
worked on some more Fairlight, keeping most of the original demo Fairlights
where the quality was good enough. Haydn is very excited by the Fairlight and
works with it a lot. This was nice for me, as it does take me a while to work
out the Fairlight arrangements sometimes, but Haydn is very patient and
enthusiastic, and it's just what I need in that situation. 
</P>
<P>We always have the Fairlight going through some effect or other, even if
it's just a bit of equalization and a nice echo, but it seems to need it, and it
always compliments the effect you want. 
</P>
<P>There were still a couple of tracks that needed drums to be sorted out, and
Charlie Morgan was the man for the job. I last worked with him on the Lionheart
album, and it was very exciting to work with him again. He is very open-minded
and is well up to date on all the latest drum-sampling equipment, etc., and also
happens to be a great drummer. 
</P>
<P>We worked with Charlie for two full days, and had him pop in for half days
to do some more overdubs at a later stage. 
</P>
<P>We then got into a pattern of where I would work with just Del for two or
three days a week, and Haydn would work the rest of the week compiling and
bouncing the ideas we'd worked on in the earlier part of the week. This worked
very well, as I was uninhibited at trying out the ideas with Del, and Haydn
could come in objectively to them. Quite often I was very nicely surprised when
things I felt might be a little too obvious, perhaps, were nicely disguised. It
is impossible to remain totally objective, especially when the ideas need to be
subtle--you mustn't make them too subtle or no one will hear them! 
</P>
<P>We continued to work this way for quite a long time, and then reached the
point where Haydn was again working full weeks. 
</P>
<P>Paddy came in again and did some vocal overdubs. At the end of the tracks on
the &quot;theme&quot; side, Paddy did some beautiful harmonic singing. This is
something you have to see to believe. Just hearing it might not convince some
people that it's just Pad! they'd swear that there was a synthesiser in there
whizzing through the harmonics, but it really is just Paddy's voice, and it's
quite celestial--I can't wait 'til you hear it, so you can hear how lovely it
is. 
</P>
<P>The tracks were still growing, though retaining their &quot;space&quot;, and
two tracks cried out for guitar. Alan Murphy, as I'm sure you all know, has
played some wonderful guitar on the albums, and this was no exception. We worked
one long day, and it was very exciting to hear how the tracks blossomed with
every overdub. There is a good musical communication between the two of us, and
I find that inspiring. 
</P>
<P>We wanted a very &quot;heavey&quot;- sounding guitar, so we used Al's amp in
a very live room and miked up the amp. Haydn got a frighteningly raunchy guitar
sound, and Al did the rest. 
</P>
<P>Sound effects, little pieces here and there. Lose this, lose that, create a
little space here, a little something there to help the crescendo and all the
recording is at last finished. I thoroughly enjoy working with people,
especially when they are musicians, engineers and friends of a calibre that I am
honoured to be with.
</P>
<P>
A big thank you to all of them, a special thanks to Haydn for all his work and
feedback, and a Happy Christmas to all of you. And a big thanks to you for your
communication and support--I'd be lost without it. 
</P>
<P>Lots of Love

<H3>Interview</H3>
<P>Do you compose your music with traditional written notation, or do you rely
entirely on demo tapes? And has your process of composing melodies and
harmonies, etc., changed since The Kick Inside and Lionheart? Are you, for
example, more specific in writing out a bass line now than in 1978, or do you
give more leeway to the other musicians during rehearsals than you used to? [I
wrote this question.] 
</P>
<P>&quot;My notation is very basic. I just write out the chords and lyrics, and
I rely mainly on my memory. This does make it a bit difficult when I try to come
back to a song after a few years, but I can listen to tapes and bash around on
the piano, rediscovering the past. Before the first album it was easy: I used to
practice all my songs every day in rotation, and kept them totally in my head.
But I just don't have the time any more, so I do rely on the records and tapes
to refer to chords--for live performances, for instance. 
</P>
<P>I think the process of recording has changed very much since the first
album, perhaps the biggest change being my involvement with the production. The
demos on the first album were just piano and vocal; the demos for the second and
third albums were a very big influence on the master recordings; the fourth
album was completely influenced by the demos; and the current album is the
demos. When working with musicians, I find that it depends totally on the
individual, and the communication between the two of us. I will normally guide
the direction to start with, but it's up to the musicians to make it really
happen.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you ever thought of releasing a live L.P.? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How did the session for the film The Magician of Lublin come about? Did you
help Maurice Jarre write the song or its lyrics? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Maurice Jarre asked me to sing the song, which he had already written.
The whole thing was a most enjoyable experience.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What is sung at the end of Symphony in Blue? Is it: &quot;No wonder that I
blew it&quot;? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but you've spelt it wrong: it's 'blue it.'&quot; 
</P>
<P>I am fascinated by Symphony in Blue, and wonder if I am right in thinking
that the musical inspiration was supplied not by Gershwin, as the title implies,
but rather by Erik Satie, and in particular the beautiful Gymnopedies. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it was inspired by Erik Satie's Gymnopedies (II). [Sic-- number
two (of the three) is not the one that the KT Band played in concert and on the
Kate special, but all three are very similar.]
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the single December Will Be Magic Again appear on the Single File
video? Did you make a jingle for radio stations the Christmas before last? 
</P>
<P>&quot;There was no video made for December Will Be Magic Again. Yes, I did
make a Christmas jingle for Capital Radio and Radio 1, but I never heard it
played and would love to know if any of you did.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you enjoy modern art? And if so, who is your favourite artist? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Salvador Dali.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you drive? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>How often do you get your hair cut, and do you go to a special hairdresser
for famous people? I think your hair always looks fantastic, and often wonder
whether you suffer from split ends, etc., like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I get my hair cut about every six weeks by Anthony Jacomine. I am
really pleased that you think my hair looks good, as it's still recovering from
all the heated curlers and tongs it was blasted with on various photo sessions.&quot;

</P>
<P>Is it true that some of the singles in the Single File boxed set have been
re-mixed? And if so, which ones? 
</P>
<P>&quot;None of the singles have been re-mixed, but Sat In Your Lap and The
Breathing are the album mixes, and not as on the original singles.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What is sung during Delius, after the bit where Delius is dictating to
Fenby? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Can't you tell?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Your lyrics have always fascinated me, but none more so than those of The
Man With the Child in His Eyes. I have often wondered whether you found
inspiration for this from Emily Bronte's poetry. It is her constant references
to eternity which make me wonder: for example, &quot;The Sea of Death's Eternity&quot;
parallelled with your &quot;Telling me about the sea/All his love, till
eternity.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;I find your parallel interesting, but unfortunately the only Bronte
work I have ever read is Wuthering Heights.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What is your feeling about the Church and religion? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It is a very powerful, widely influential force that has extreme good
and bad effects on people.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What kind of make-up do you use? [Well, you can't fault these questions for
lack of variety!] 
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't bother any more, I use Latex!&quot; 
</P>
<P>The song style on The Dreaming appears to be more rhythmic in nature than
your earlier, more melodic material. Is this a deliberate change in musical
direction? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Since drum machines entered my life on the third album, it's never
been the same.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why is The Kick Inside the only available L.P. on compact disk? What do you
think of the quality of CDs, and would you like to see KBV released on this
system? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe you should ask EMI why only The Kick Inside is available on CD.
I would like KBV to be out on this system so that I can tell you what the
quality is like, 'cause I haven't heard. yet!&quot; [This interview dates from
December 1984 or earlier.]
</P>
<P>
Is the Hammersmith-Odeon video any different from the version shown on TV? How
much other footage is not on these versions, and why were the other bits
excluded? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The version shown on TV is the Hammersmith-Odeon video, unless it's
been edited to fit time slots. There are about another one-and- a-half hours
that were shot that night. The video version was edited from the complete show,
which ran for about two-and-a-half hours, and we had to make it a standard
length to fit TV slots.&quot; 
</P>
<P>When you decide to tour again, will it be video-ed? Do you think the
Hammersmith-Odeon video gives a true vision of the stage show for those who
weren't there? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I dare say it would be video-ed if we did tour. I don't think the
video was a true vision at all. You had to be there to see it all. In fact, most
of it was missing. You couldn't even smell the heather in Wuthering Heights! But
for a video to do that, smellivision is yet to be invented.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Who entertained the audience while you changed costumes on your 1979 Tour?
I heard that it was a magician. Is this true? It is impossible to tell from the
video. 
</P>
<P> &quot;There was a fantastic magician in show--Simon Drake. He made things
float, glide and fly, not to mention disappear. However, most costume changes
were done very quickly over extended fade-outs and extended intros. into the
songs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>  As many of the press and album reviewers considered The Dreaming to be &quot;weird&quot;
and &quot;over-produced&quot;, etc., do you mind if the press label the new
album &quot;even weirder&quot;? 
</P>
<P>  &quot;I don't mind 'even weirder', but I don't like 'over-produced'. 
</P>
<P>  Who are your favourite band at the moment, and what has been your
favourite album and single of 1984? 
</P>
<P>  &quot;Favourite band: Killing Joke. Favourite single: 80s by Killing Joke.
I can't give you my favourite album, as I haven't really had time to listen to
any this year.&quot; 
</P>
<P>  Do the birthday and Christmas cards and presents you are sent actually
reach you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;All the ones I've received have reached me.&quot; 
</P>
<P>If you had to live in another country, where would you choose? 
</P>
<P>&quot;If I had to, I think it would be Ireland.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Which is your favourite cover version of one of your songs? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Poor Old Flea by Madame Maria Nanky.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Any New Year's resolutions? 
</P>
<P>&quot;To try and go on holiday.&quot;
