<P>[Here is Kate's article for issue number 19.] 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>Since the end of the album so much has been happening. The way the music has
been received is so rewarding. It has been very busy: promoting the album is
important, and has eaten up a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>The visits to America and Canada were lots of fun. Everyone seemed so
positive about this album. It is nice to think people in different parts of the
world are listening to ideas you might have had in the bath! 
</P>
<P>The difference in the attitudes of the journalists was very apparent: a lot
of the interviews were conversational, and their enthusiasm endless. We did one
in-store appearance in New York [Tower Records, 4th and Broadway, November 1985]
and it was a very moving experience. There were so many people there that they
went around the corner of the street. Everyone was so considerate and well
behaved that even the New York Police commented on how unusual this was. It was
wonderful to meet you all, and we were very taken by your warmth and all the
presents you gave--thank you. 
</P>
<P>The trip to the U.S.A. and Canada was very busy, and coming back to the
Convention [November 30] was one of the nicest ways to be welcomed home. It was
lovely to see you. I recognised so many smiling faces--I just wish we'd had the
time to talk as well as smile at each other. Next time, huh? [Kate actually
tried to make the next &quot;convention&quot;-- a &quot;video-party&quot; held
in London in October 1986--a more intimate occasion, but so many people showed
up that casual conversation became quite impossible.] 
</P>
<P>It looks like this album is intending to have maximum mileage in terms of
four single releases. It is interesting how &quot;singles&quot; now involve much
more time and effort--not the a-sides themselves, but the &quot;accessories&quot;
that now accompany them. A single is not even released now until the video and
the twelve-inch are ready; and with the twelve-inch is needed at least a second
b-side. Also, if time and ideas allow, all these things should be presentable. I
feel a particular obligation, with the artwork of the seven-inch and
twelve-inch, that it should at least be interesting; and the same with the
video: visuals are important, and with so many images being thrown at people
from every side, it can be difficult to come up with ideas. 
</P>
<P>John's photographs are so creative that he always seems to add a sparkle to
even the dullest moments. Videos, I feel, have moved into a different area--like
the recording process gradually pulled me in, so does the visual world. It's
impossible not to be, as soon as you become involved. 
</P>
<P>I still think some of the best videos are where the band/artist perform the
song as a singer--just that simple. I share the feelings of many people who
dislike a lot of pop videos: they're so...unstructured! But I think I've
discovered that while videos are needed to go with a single, I can explore the
medium of film-making, of what works and what doesn't. Much of what happens in a
video is dictated by the song: the mood, the subject matter; but it's a
fascinating area, and from what I can see so far, it's very similar to the
recording process. It's working with pictures instead of sound--it's a very
different beast, but still the same &quot;piecing together&quot; of a story,
images. And I'm so lucky to be in a situation where I can play with sounds and
pictures and see if there's anything in there I'm good at. 
</P>
<P>Cloudbusting was really exciting to make. I really wanted it to be like a
short film. The song was inspired by the book A Book of Dreams by Peter Reich,
which was such a strong, magical story that the plot was there and the most
difficult areas were trying to do the story and the characters justice, and
deciding how to &quot;distill&quot; all the information. 
</P>
<P>I worked with Julian Doyle as director. He was suggested to me by Terry
Gillima. Terry is one of my favourite film-makers, and I was so honoured that he
got involved; and we worked very hard for about five-six weeks. It seemed to
make sense to treat it like a film and cast actors, and I had this initial crazy
idea of usisng a very tall actor who would play the father, and myself to appear
as the small boy. It continually astounds me that I have the nerve to publicly
announce these crazes, and I'm even more surprised when they work. It seems to
be connected to a kind of faith? 
</P>
<P>The first move was to check that I'd be able to look boy-like or tom-boyish,
so we pulled &quot;The Team&quot; together. This consists of Tina Earnshaw on
make-up--she set about with foundation and stick-on freckles; Anthony Yacomine,
who designed and cut a short wig which my hair was bundled up inside of; and
Pamela Keats, who had brought a variety of dungarees, cardigans and wellies
[rubber rainboots] that completed the character; and Del gave options. I looked
a bit like Coco the clown, and someone mentioned Harpo, but we all felt with
fine adjustments we could get away with it, especially when we took a polaroid
with Anthony standing on the chair to look tall next to me. 
</P>
<P>We were all trying to think of a tall actor who would be perfect for the
part, and who else, really? We thought Donald Sutherland would be superb, and
it's still hard to believe that he actually said &quot;Yes.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Cloudbusting is one of the few videos we've made that has the right visual
content within the subject matter. It is a story, and could easily be treated as
such. 
</P>
<P>One of the things that needed a lot of work was the Cloudbuster machine. It
came out of our heads, based on vague information from the book. It had to look
larger than life--elegant, strange, aimed at the sky. And when I went to see it
in its early stages I really wondered: four cardboard tubes on wheels--eek!! But
by the last stages it looked great, and on screen it looked superb. 
</P>
<P>Another thing that needed a lot of work was the weather. We needed so much
luck to complete the shoot. We had only three days, and we demanded the weather
to change for different scenes; and somehow--we still don't know how--it did;
even to the moment when it began to rain just as the light and the film in the
camera was running out. 
</P>
<P>Hounds of Love is the third single, and trying to follow the Cloudbusting
video was extremely difficult. I still wanted to follow the approach of making &quot;a
short film&quot;, and this time we wanted to suggest a piece of &quot;Hitchcock&quot;:
a short thriller. 
</P>
<P>Paddy inspired me into a 39 Steps theme, and for the two-three weeks over
Christmas my life became this third video. It was particularly hard organising
meetings over Christmas; everyone was busy partying. At one meeting someone
turned up in fancy dress. The advantage was that I got a brilliant crew who were
free to do the shoot because it was Christmas-time, generally a very quiet
period. If you get to see the video, let us know if you spot Hitchcock's
appearance? 
</P>
<P>Even with the work over Christmas we were still in a situation where the
twelve-inch and the b-side had to be rushed. Sometimes things benefit from the
pressure, but with only a few hours to do the b-side before the cut (which had
been arranged weeks before), we plumped for a totally unaccompanied traditional
song. 
</P>
<P>The twelve-inch of Hounds of Love has been the most demanding so far. It's a
short song, with very little tuned instrumentation, so we decided to go for an
alternative lead vocal over the existing track, with a few changes here and
there--it seemed an interesting solution. Del and I re-did the vocal, the b-side
and the mixes in two days (that's some kind of record for me!) 
</P>
<P>So now, with a remixed seven-inch and twelve-inch of Big Sky, we are armed
with time, hopefully, to not rush the video; but somehow other things always
come up, and it seems no matter how long you have to get something done, time
always speeds up at the end of the process, and there you are rushing again! 
</P>
<P>Hope you're having a happy '86. 
</P>
<P>Lots of love, 
</P>
<P>Kate x 
</P>
<P>P.S.: Thank you for the great Christmas presents you sent me. I wish I had
time to reply to everyone individually, but things have been so hectic over the
last few months that it has been impossible--so I'll do it now, thank you.
