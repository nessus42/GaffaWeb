<P>[Here are Kate's article and another interview section from the fourteenth
issue of the Newsletter (written in the fall of '83)

</PRE>
<P>Dear Friends, 
</P>
<P>Since we last spoke, the weather has been incredible--it was the best July
since 1659, they say--but for me it's like 1976. Do you remember that year? It
was a particularly special year, when things were full of adventure. 
</P>
<P>I was dancing every day, and singing and writing all night. I used to go to
London by train every day. It was the time of bomb scares, and everyone would
stare uneasily at unattended bags, and the trains were full of paranoia. It was
brilliant for me--I'd get back to my newly acquired roommates, Zoodle and Pye,
who were only kittens, then, and I'd open all the windows and wail away all
night. I only got one complaint from someone who had to get up at 4:00 a.m., and
as I was creating noisily until at least that time, they were somewhat unhappy
at their lack of sleep. But only that one complained. 
</P>
<P>I feel in many ways that '76 and this year are linked together, for me. This
year I've been seriously trying to work for an album, but found that in the
first part of the year I just needed to rest, really. It's hard to say how I was
feeling after the last album, but I needed to breathe. There are always
post-album blues, but this time I think I just wanted a break, just to think and
to gather stimulus for a new direction. After the demanding lands that my last
set of songs took me to, I had to think again about where to go--maybe somewhere
a little sunnier. I can honestly say I feel so much more relaxed having had time
to put my pieces back together; have some time with my family and friends, which
I was really missing; and also to indulge in some books, films and records. 
</P>
<P>After lasting three months on Chinese take-aways during the last part of the
album, I realised food was a terribly important factor to a healthy mind and
body. So now I make sure I cook one good meal a day, and have cut out all junk
food--which is unbelievable for me. It is definitely true that convenience is
not always a good thing. Cooking, especially when you're not handling carcasses
and gristle, can be a delightful thing. I always find it a miracle to turn a few
vegetables and some flour and margarine into a complete meal--it's a bit like
the five loaves and two fish. It's times like this, when I'm doing a lot of
cooking, that I realise how glad I am and how lucky I am to be a vegetarian, to
be eating nothing but fruit and vegetables--all the wonderful colours and
textures. Of course, the big trouble with cooking is time, but I make myself set
aside the time to cook an evening meal, and I really miss it now if I'm out and
not able to devour my nutritious foods, and it'll take a while yet before I'll
be able to handle a Chines take-away. 
</P>
<P>I have also found a wonderful new dance teacher. Her name is Dyane Gray, and
she is an incredibly beautiful dancer. Not only did I feel I needed to be fit
again, but I really wanted the stimulus and inspiration that comes from true
teachers. 
</P>
<P>Having found her, and since taking more care of my body, I feel recharged
again. It's too easy to let bad food and no sleep catch up. I can't tell you how
good and happy I feel since I've taken these few steps. 
</P>
<P>As you probably know, a trip to America and Canada was due, and was
unfortunately cancelled. It was very disappointing, as I was greatly looking
forward to trying to help The Dreaming along out there. But I feel I was
probably meant to carry on with the album and perhaps also to have been able to
enjoy the first British summer for seven years. [The papers printed stories that
Kate's scheduled American trip was scratched solely because her planned mode of
transportation, the Queen Elizabeth II ocean liner, was diverted from its
schedule for service in the Falklands at the last minute. According to the news
reports, Kate simply cancelled the America junket rather than consider flying,
allegedly because of an overpowering phobia of airplanes. Although she does seem
to have made such a decision, her heavy reliance on air transportation up until
this time discredits the stories of air phobia.] 
</P>
<P>I had a really good birthday this year. In fact, it was definitely one of
the best ever. Thank you all so much for your lovely presents and wishes. It
means a lot to know you're all thinking of me. 
</P>
<P>Just a word about the compilation video that was promised in April!! (you
must be used to this by now.) Unfortunately, due to delayed business
transactions, there is still no release date, but we really do hope it will be
settled before the end of the year! (Hopefully, there will be advertisments
around the time, to let you know if we can't get an official release date to
you.) But as a sneak preview, here is a proff of the artwork at this stage. 
</P>
<P>Well, I'll return to my work, and wish you a very happy autumn. 
</P>
<P>Until our next letter. 
</P>
<P>Lots of love, 
</P>
<P>Kate xx

<H3>Interview</H3>
<P>Do you watch the chart positions of your albums and singles? Do you know
their positions before they are broadcast, or do you have to wait and listen to
the radio? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I suppose I do keep an eye on the charts to a certain extent, but
I don't know the chart positions until the day you hear them on the radio. I
usually hear via a telephone call from the record company, and they don't know
them until that morning.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Have you ever sung in any foreign language other than French? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but only once, when I was in Japan at a Japanese business
conference. I sang a well known song of their country, in their language.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Who is Tamlain, mentioned in The Empty Bullring? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Tamlain is a girl in a traditional fairy story, who is locked up in an
ivory tower.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you actually read up and research for your songs, or is itinformation
already in your head--especially Breathing? 
</P>
<P>&quot;This really depends on the subject matter of the individual song; but
in the case of Breathing, most of the information came from a documentary about
a man who had been following up the negative results of nuclear products.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On Never For Ever and The Dreaming, you are credited as playing a CS-80.
What is this? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The CS-80 is a synthesiser made by Yamaha. It has been a particularly
favourite synth. of mine, as it is one of the few that has a touch-sensitive
keyboard.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you ever go to concerts? If so, who? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I very rarely go to gigs, as I don't really have much free time; but
it's always nice to go and see artists whose music I enjoy, especially when the
shows are as spectacular as The Wall.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Who is the man on the cover of The Dreaming? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Why, Houdini, of course!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Were the brightly coloured trousers with zips and ties that you wore for the
Virgin p.a. last year and for a number of photos specially made for you, or did
you buy them? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Quite a few people have assumed that they were specially made.
However, I did buy the trousers--from a boutique called Splash.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you know of any records available featuring whale music? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I think if you look around, there have been quite a few, but I
understand that some, including The Song of the Humpback Whale, have been
deleted, so you would probably only find them in second-hand record shops.&quot;
