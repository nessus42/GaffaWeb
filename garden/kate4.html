<P>[Here is the article and story that Kate contributed to issue number 4
(Christmas 1979).]

<H3>&quot;Them Heavy People&quot; </H3>
<P>The idea for Heavy People came when I was just sitting one day in my
parents' house. I heard the phrase &quot;Rolling the ball&quot; in my head, and
I thought that it would be a good way to start a song, so I ran in to the piano
and played it and got the chords down. I then worked on it from there. 
</P>
<P>It has lots of different people and ideas and things like that in it, and
they came to me amazingly easily--it was a bit like Oh England, because in a way
so much of it was what was happening at home at the time. My brother and my
father were very much involved in talking about Gurdjieff and whirling
Dervishes, and I was really getting into it, too. It was just like plucking out
a bit of that and putting it into something that rhymed. And it happened so
easily--in a way, too easily. I say that because normally it's difficult to get
it all to happen at once, but sometimes it does, and that can seem sort of
wrong. Usually you have to work hard for things to happen, but it seems that the
better you get at them the more likely you are to do something that is good
without any effort. [In fact, however, Kate says even now that her music still
comes very slowly, generally speaking.] And because of that it's always a
surprise when something comes easily. 
</P>
<P>I thought it was important not to be narrow-minded just because we talked
about Gurdjieff. I knew that I didn't mean his system was the only way, and that
was why it was important to include whirling Dervishes and Jesus, because they
are strong, too. Anyway, in the long run, although somebody might be into all of
them, it's really you that does it--they're just the vehicle to get you there. 
</P>
<P>I always felt that Heavy People should be a single, but I just had a feeling
that it shouldn't be a second single, although a lot of people wanted that.
Maybe that's why I had the feeling--because it was to happen a little later, and
in fact I never really liked the album version much because it should be quite
loose, you know: it's a very human song. And I think, in fact, every time I do
it, it gets even looser. I've danced and sung that song so many times now, but
it's still like a hymn to me when I sing it. I do sometimes get bored with the
actual words I'm singing, but the meaning I put into them is still a comfort.
It's like a prayer, and it reminds me of direction. And it can't help but help
me when I'm singing those words. Subconsciously they must go in.

<H3><A NAME="int">Interview</A></H3>
<P>Where did you get the happy/sad face earrings in the club photo? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've had a lot of enquiries about those, and a lot of people would
like to ge a pair. I'm afraid I can't help anyone to find a pair, as I was given
them by a fan.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Do you henna your hair? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. I use henna wax. Otherwise I don't do anything special. I
sometimes plait it and let it dry to make it curl, and for the Christmas TV show
I used crimping irons, which was amazing.&quot; In James and the Cold Gun did
you refer to anyone in particular? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've had lots of letters about this, many from people called James,
with plenty of suggestions for identities of the &quot;James&quot;, but the
answer is: nobody. When I wrote the song, James was the right name for it.&quot;

</P>
<P>In Coffee Homeground, you mention Crippen. Who is he? 
</P>
<P>&quot;He was a murderer who was arrested after he had escaped from Britain
by ship, thanks to the use of ship-to-shore radio. It was the first time that
radio was used in this way, so he has a small place in history for that reason.&quot;

</P>
<P>Is it true that you live in a flat with your brothers? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I get lots of questions about where I live, usually prompted by
inaccurate information in papers. You really can't believe everything you read.
We all three live in the same house, but we each have separate flats, which are
connected by intercom for ease of communication. [Kate has since re-moved to a
house of her own, outside the city. I believe that John has also moved out, but
that the apartment building is still owned by the Bush family.] To find the
house you take the second turning on the right and keep straight on till
morning.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why did you call your cats Zoodle and Pyewacket? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Paddy says that Zoodle is a German word for snoot, and I got the name
from him. I don't know where the name Pyewacket came from--it just seemed a good
idea at the time, as they say. We actually call her Pye.&quot; [Kate may or may
not be speaking candidly here, but for the record &quot;Pyewacket&quot; is the
name of a very popular fictional cat, the &quot;familiar&quot; of Kim Novak's
witch-character in the 1958 film Bell, Book and Candle, from the play by van
Druten. Based on the wonderful atmosphere and subject of this movie, and the
really important role of the cat in the story, it seems very likely that Kate
got the name from this film, or from the play on which it is based.]
