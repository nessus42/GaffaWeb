<P>These were the addresses (air mail, one year to the U.S.) of the Kate Bush
Club Newsletter (as of the 1990 issue, Issue No. 23) and Homeground (as of No.
37) plus the names and addresses of all the other Kate Bush-related fanzines
that I know of--making a total of eighteen. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>The Kate Bush Club</H3>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>P.O. Box 120
<BR>Welling
<BR>Kent DA16 3DS
<BR>ENGLAND</ADDRESS>
<P>Subscriptions are no longer offered.  
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Homeground</H3>
<ADDRESS>Peter and Krystyna FitzGerald-Morris and Dave Cross, editors
<BR>Sharon May, Secretary
<BR>P.O. Box 176
<BR>Orpington
<BR>Kent BR5 3NA
<BR>ENGLAND</ADDRESS>
<P>Airmail subscription to U.S., one year: 12 Pounds, 10 Pence. 
</P>
<P>Note: The Kate Bush Club asks for payment in U.K. (Sterling) money. They
prefer the money in the form of an International Sterling draft, but my
experience with those is that they can now cost as much as twenty dollars extra,
on top of the already extremely high conversion rate. My recommendation is that
payment be made in U.K.  cash, which you can get at airports, or at some banks
and currency exchange offices. The commission is not much, and if your envelope
is carefully sealed and can't be seen through, it'll stand a pretty good chance
of getting there. U.S. dollars are frowned on by the KBC, but they might work if
you are very careful to pay at the current exchange rate plus at least seven and
a half percent extra to cover conversion costs. (As you know, the Dollar is
worth less and less these days.) Homeground will accept foreign currency, but
only at the going rate plus at least 7 1/2 percent.   
</P>
<P>In strong contrast to the Kate Bush Club's publishing performance,
Homeground puts out at least four issues a year, every year, plus a little
update flier when there is some important news development. Homeground still has
the feeling of a homemade publication, but it's now quite professionally printed
in black and white on good paper. It's always interesting and has become an
indispensible record of KT fandom.   
</P>
<P>The KBC Newsletter, on the other hand, is very luxurious but, as explained
above, far less frequent. Despite its slowness, it contains no more pages than
an issue of Homeground, and of course the Newsletter's infrequency means that it
can no longer be relied upon at all as a source of news. For all that, when the
club does come out with an issue, it is filled with a lot of very fine and
exclusive photography, most of it now in spectacular colour, much of it the work
of Kate's brother John Carder Bush.  
</P>
<P>TheNewsletter usually features either an introductory letter, article or
interview by/with Kate; articles by John and/or Paddy, Kate's two brothers; an
occasional note from Del Palmer; a Pen Pals page and a Swaps page; Kate's own
comic strip about the misadventures of her cats, Zoodle and Pyewacket (this was
my favourite section, now sadly suspended, perhaps due to the sad news of Zoo's
death; with luck perhaps a new strip featuring the new kittens will appear in
future issues?); a puzzle/competitions page; news bits (usually out-of-date by
the time they reach subscribers); and one-off articles, art and/or comic strips
by fans. Lyrics of non-LP Kate Bush songs may appear first here, as well.   
</P>
<P>For its part, Homeground features an exhaustive record of press, radio and
television coverage of Kate during the quarter preceding each issue, called
Medialogue; an immensely helpful ongoing series of facts, dates and biographical
information from the co-editor Peter FitzGerald-Morris, called Five Years Ago;
essays on Kate's music and related (and sometimes unrelated) matters, by fans
and the editors; comic strips; poetry; and a spot for personal notices.
Homeground, unlike the Newsletter, frequently publishes its readers' comments
and contributions. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>Here is a list of all the other Kate Bush fanzines that I know of: 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<H3>Still Breathing</H3>
<P>(successor to Break-Through) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>R. Somerville, editor
<BR>11588 72nd Avenue
<BR>Delta, British Columbia
<BR>V4E-1Z1
<BR>CANADA</ADDRESS>
<P>This is a very interesting Canadian fanzine, the successor to the now sadly
defunct Break-Through. It is published by the co-publisher of the former
fanzine, Robyn Somerville, and the only thing keeping Still Breathing from
re-attaining Break-Through's extraordinary heights is the perrennial problem of
money. As it is, an issue of Still Breathing appears infrequently and
irregularly--though it's well worth waiting and paying for. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<H3>Under the Ivy</H3>
<P>(Note: the latest issue is actually entitled Kate: an Under the Ivy
publication) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>55 Burnside Way
<BR>Dagenham, Essex
<BR>RM8-1XH
<BR>ENGLAND</ADDRESS>
<P>Recent reports are that Under the Ivy/Kate has ceased operations and
disbanded--which may be just as well, since this fanzine seems to have been
largely created as a vehicle for advertising its publishers' bootleg records. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<H3>Blow Away</H3>
<P>(the Scottish Kate Bush fanzine; may have suspended publication) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>Ms. Jackie Bain
<BR>117 Leeward Circle
<BR>Westwood, East Kilbride
<BR>G75-8NZ
<BR>SCOTLAND</ADDRESS>
<P>Unfortunately, this fanzine is also said to have ceased publication. Blow
Away contributed much to the lore of Kate fandom during its short run,
including, for example, a wonderful two-part exclusive interview with Michael
Hervieu, Kate's dance partner in the Running Up That Hill video. If indeed this
fanzine has closed down, it will be sorely missed. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<H3>N'Abandonne Pas</H3>
<P>(the French KT/Peter Gabriel fanzine, 2/3 in French, 1/3 in English) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>Fanch Oriant, editor
<BR>P. 389
<BR>75962 Paris
<BR>Cedex 20
<BR>FRANCE</ADDRESS>
<P>Though I sent the publishers of N'Abandonne Pas a large sum of French Francs
and a painstakingly translated letter of encouragement, I have seen no sign of
the fanzine since its maiden issue (No. 0), which appeared in 1988. They are, to
say the least, unreliable. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Dreamtime</H3>
<P>(the Australian Kate Bush fanzine) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>Gaye Godfrey and Warrick Williams, editors
<BR>7 Bryden Road
<BR>Carmel 6076
<BR>WESTERN AUSTRALIA</ADDRESS>
<P>This is one of the very best fanzines. Gaye Godfrey's increasingly
expressive and professional art design distinguishes Dreamtime from all the
other fanzines, and the publication does an excellent job of keeping Australian
fans in contact with one another.  Furthermore, Dreamtime is very reliable and
prompt. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Lionheart</H3>
<P>(Once connected with the KBC, now completely independent) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>The Kate Bush Club of Japan
<BR>5-6-14 Shimomeguro, Meguro ku
<BR>Tokyo 153
<BR>JAPAN</ADDRESS>
<P>I have never had any luck at all in getting a response from these folks, nor
have I ever seen a copy of any Japanese fanzine. If anyone has information to
offer, please contact the publishers of The Garden. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Kate</H3>
<P>(a fanzine, published in Dutch) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>Kate Bush Club Nederland
<BR>Postbus 2177
<BR>4800 CD
<BR>Breda
<BR>THE NETHERLANDS</ADDRESS>
<P>This is a superb octavo-size fanzine from Holland. Although printed
primarily in Dutch, its publishers are such knowledgeable and dedicated fans
that the truly serious Kate enthusiast is advised to subscribe. In a recent
issue, for example, Kate was the first to report in detail (and with great
accuracy and propriety) the sudden proliferation of early demo recordings by
Kate in 1989. There is always something of interest in the Dutch fanzine. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Watching Storms</H3>
<P>(the U.S. KT &quot;apazine&quot;--Amateur Publishing Association magazine) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>Erni Heramia, Central Mailer
<BR>167 Central Avenue
<BR>East Providence, RI 02914
<BR>U.S.A.</ADDRESS>
<P>This American fanzine is a bit different from other Kate publications, in
that it is known as an APA-zine (a publication of the Amateur Publishers'
Association). The principle of these magazines is that each subscriber is also a
contributor--in fact, fines may be levied against a subscriber if he or she
neglects to contribute a letter, article or piece of artwork within a certain
number of months. The result of this kind of obligation is an unusually thick
and densely-packed fanzine.  Another result, however, is that much of what is
published stands out more for the enthusiasm of its writers than for anything of
real moment they have to say. Still, Watching Storms is increasingly
entertaining, and there is a genuine rapport between contributors, lending the
fanzine a comforable atmosphere of cameraderie.  For those who wish to read but
not contribute, an alternate edition of Watching Storms, called Little Earth, is
available, as well. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Cariad Kate</H3>
<P>(the Welsh fanzine) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>28 Millbrook Street
<BR>Plasmarl, Swansea, SA6 8LY
<BR>SA6 8LY
<BR>WALES</ADDRESS>
<P>The Welsh fanzine is another staple of avid Kate fans. Still a little
amateurish in appearance (despite a recent move to glossier paper), Cariad Kate
nonetheless performs at a very high level each issue, and it appears at
relatively regular intervals. The publishers are very knowledgeable, and their
tone is a bit less uncritical than that of their chief independent counterpart
in England, Homeground. Well worth reading. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>The Lionhearts Society</H3>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>11211 53rd Avenue
<BR>Edmonton, Alberta T6H-OS6
<BR>CANADA</ADDRESS>
<P>This group so far only has tentative plans for a fanzine. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>After the Party</H3>
<P>(may have suspended publication) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>c/o Alan and Maura Balliot
<BR>P.O. Box 7323
<BR>Washington, D.C. 20044
<BR>U.S.A.</ADDRESS>
<P>Mainly an organ for advertising the merchandise which Mr. Balliott sells
under the company name Intergalactic Garage, this four-page flier has probably
ceased publication. However, IG does print up a one-page notice of Kate items
for sale on a regular basis, and this may be of some interest to fans. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>For the Love of Kate</H3>
<P>(long quiescent, but a fourth issue appeared in 1988) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>c/o Gillian Gaar
<BR>18770 Ridgefield Road NW
<BR>Seattle, Washington 98177
<BR>U.S.A.</ADDRESS>
<P>Since the unexpected re-emergence of this humorous fanzine in 1988 with a
single issue, I have heard nothing about Gillian Gaar's plans. Again, anyone
with information is invited to notify the editors of The Garden. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>The First and Last Forever</H3>
<P>(The Italian Kate Bush Fanzine) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>Via dei Gaspari 4C
<BR>34072 Gradisca Di sonzo
<BR>Gorizia
<BR>ITALY</ADDRESS>
<P>A single issue has appeared that I am aware of. It's a reasonably
informative re-telling of news culled from the British fanzines and newspapers,
for the benefit of Italian-speaking fans. The publisher, Tina d'Agostino, is a
poetically minded, profoundly Romantic enthusiast of Kate's work. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>The Big Sky Forum</H3>
<ADDRESS>Chelmsford, Massachusetts
<BR>U.S.A.</ADDRESS>
<P>I have seen only one issue (No. 3) of this desktop publication. Nicely laid
out on glossy cardpaper, the issue contained several highly informative and
insightful articles, including an overview of the lives of Houdini and Delius. A
promising start for another U.S.-based fanzine. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Love-Hounds</H3>
<P>(the international Kate Bush computer forum)  
</P>
<P><A HREF="mailto:love-hounds-request@gryphon.com">Love-Hounds-request@gryphon.com</A>

</P>
<P>Unlike any other Kate Bush forum, Love-Hounds does not appear in hardcopy
form (except as re-printed by subscribers on their home printers). Rather, this
computer group, which is truly international and boasts several thousand
readers, consists of inter-computer conversations revolving around the life and
work of Kate Bush. The discussions roam freely over every conceivable aspect of
Kate's art, and other artists are brought into focus periodically, as well,
usually in the context of Kate.  
</P>
<P>Love-Hounds is very frequently the best possible source for Kate Bush news,
because it numbers several reliable and dedicated English and European fans
among its intercontinental base of regular contributors. In past years
Love-Hounds has also organized Katemas parties throughout the United
States--parties held on Kate's birthday (July 30) by Love-Hounds in various
centers of the country.  
</P>
<P>If you have access to a computer and a modem, and you can afford the small
monthly fees charged by one of the public-access services which can connect you
to the group, you can become a member. Better yet, if you're enrolled in a
university or college--almost anywhere in the world--the chances are your
university already has access to Love-Hounds. Ask at your school's
computer-science department if they are members of BITnet. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>Reaching Out</H3>
<P>Cynthia Kiley 
</P>
<P>A fledgling desktop publication. The maiden issue contains a transcription
of an exclusive radio interview with Kate, dating from December 1989. The first
issue is a modest affair, but it has a stylish and colorful look, and shows
promise for the future. 
</P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H3>The Wickham Street Irregular Press</H3>
<P>(publishers of the The WSI Quarterly and The Garden) 
</P>
<P></P>
<ADDRESS>c/o Andrew Marvick
<BR>10499 Wilkins Avenue
<BR>Los Angeles, CA 90024
<BR>U.S.A.</ADDRESS>
<P>(Notice: The WSI publications are not for sale or distribution) 
</P>
<P>If you're reading this, chances are you already know what The Garden is. If
you're not familiar with us, however, The Garden is a constantly updated set of
books designed for the use of serious Kate Bush fans. The overly ambitious aim
of the The Garden's editors is to make available, in one coordinated series of
volumes, everything the dedicated fan needs or wants to know.
