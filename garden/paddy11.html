<P>[Here is Paddy's eleventh article for the Newsletter. It appeared in the
eighteenth issue (fall 1985).]

<H3>Pad's Bit</H3>
<P>By now you will already know a great deal about Hounds of Love from Kate's
letter [posted earlier in Love-Hounds], so I'll try to avoid repeating any of
the information that you may have already picked up, and concentrate on one or
two more obscure areas that could be of interest. 
</P>
<P> There are a lot of mysterious threads to untangle on this particular
record. Two years have flown by whilst weaving this latest flying carpet, so
don't expect to unravel it just like that. 
</P>
<P> It's been rather like living on a light-house in the Atlantic ocean, with
the odd supply-ship turning up laden with musicians clad in their oilskins. We
strap them into the bo'sun's chair and winch them on board amid sea fog, squalls
and showers. Through gales and driving hail these salty dogs weathered the
storms, and on hot dijeridu nights we'd hose down the oscillator banks with all
hands to the pumps and play on into the small hours. The delicate equipment,
recorders, charts, etc. are housed in their own watertight compartments, and
musicians have to pass through an elaborate air-lock mechanism in order to get
from the studio to the bridge. This is probably obvious to the technically
minded amongst you, as studios are normally airtight anyway in order to be
soundproof. This of course is not without its problems. I remember on a couple
of occasions the hissing sound from the regulator valve on my underwater
breathing apparatus caused the odd difficulty. Often when recording near the
starboard hatch the sounds of passing whales, ships and seagulls would actually
spill in through an open porthole, and these can definitely be heard in one or
two places on side two. 
</P>
<P> Often whilst drifting off in the middle of an overdub, I might chance to
see Kate up in the lamp-room, her face all lit up. What a comforting sight to
seafarers that little light can be. 
</P>
<P> When the weather conditions are correct and I am off watch, I like to spend
my time practicing my lines sat on the rocks in my oilskins, with the ocean
pounding and crashing away in the background. I like the way the waves group in
patterns in an almost predictable way. But in our part of the sea there are
often freak waves that appear after a long pause, and then there is a surging
undulation of such enormous proportions, stacking itself into the big sky and
unrolling with such huge explosive velocity that you couldn't hear what I was
saying if I were standing next to you. 
</P>
<P> But life on our lighthouse is not just weather-watching. There's making tea
for the helicopter rescue-men. Often microphone-stands have to be rigourously
maintained to protect them from salt-water corrosion, and once or twice I've had
to scrape barnacles off the hydrophone. Most studios that are used by regular
land-lubbing swabs don't have to cope with such maintenance procedures, but we
find that the sea air has its compensations, and a very jolly atmosphere
prevails. Yes, the boys are a pretty lively crew. In fact, the other day, just
before the Terry Wogan show, someone put a lobster in my balalaika case! Just
imagine that. If the BBC found out they'd be furious. You're supposed to have a
live seafood specialist in the building at all times, and they are really strict
about that sort of thing, so we had to take turns hiding it. We couldn't leave
him in the dressing-rooms and as we had very long coats on, we each drew straws
to see who'd hide him in the studio. If any of you naughty U.K. fans video-taped
the show and re-watch the sequence, you should be able to spot without too much
trouble which musician had the job of concealing the controversial
claustrophobic crustacean. [I have looked, but not spotted.] 
</P>
<P> Live television certainly has its pressures, and they're quite different
from making videos. Talking of which, you must have seen Running Up That Hill by
now. This was filmed at Bray Studios on the River Thames. Most convenient, as it
is only twenty-seven hours by launch from our light-house. It's a very
interesting place, and looks like a large hotel on a huge rubbish dump with six
big aircraft-hangar studios dotted here and there. Film people and pantomime
horses can be seen moving from make-up to their respective sets, through a maze
of prefabs, caravans and discarded props. I enjoyed being an extra that day. Any
spare moments we spent by the river practicing our knots in the sunshine.
Make-up consisted of a white guano-type preparation for the hair and cellulose
car-paint for body colour. And, with masks on our faces, we were ready for the
now familiar &quot;Quiet, lights...playback and...action&quot; syndrome. You
know the rest. 
</P>
<P> And now, well, things are really happening, and you are also playing a very
important part in the scheme of things: that is, providing that you can answer
the following questions: 
</P>
<P>What is the national musical instrument of Australia?<BR> Why haven't you
made one yet? 
</P>
<P> I'm sure you were expecting a question like the last one, and I guess that
one or two of you will be blushing with shame at this very moment, so I suggest
that you just give in to the overwhelming urge and join in our underground
network which is growning into an international pipeline since people started to
dig deeper into The Dreaming. You yourselves must be the judges of this, so dig,
jury, do, and have an original instrument to show me at the Convention this
year--that is, providing the supply ship makes it back. The British weather has
been most unpredictable. Our radio-telephone mast was blown over last night and
I've had to transmit most of this article by standing on top of the studio and
waving two flags towards the mainland. When I look through the telescope I can
just see Kate dressed in exceptionally fashionable heavy-weather gear, standing
on the cliff-top with a notepad and signalling-lamp. My semaphore is not very
good, and it's very slippery up here. 
</P>
<P> Well, shipmates, I must conclude this transmission, as it's the dogwatch at
two bells and I have a hungry lobster to feed, and a lot of brass pipes to
polish, not to mention entering the latest readings from the chart recorder into
the log. Even as I flap out this message, visibility is down to a few miles and
the only way that Kate can see me is if I climb on top of this old lightning
conductor...Is this any better? 
</P>
<P> Message ends 20.58 G.M.T.
