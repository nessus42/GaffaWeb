<H2>Early Poems</H2>
<P>[Here are seven poems which Kate wrote for her school magazine. The first
was written when she was eleven years old--just about the same time that she was
beginning to write songs. These poems were taken from Paul Kerton's biography,
<CITE>Kate Bush</CITE> (London, 1980), pp. 18-21. 
</P>
<P>Edited by Andrew Marvick. 
</P>
<P>[In these seven little poems many secrets lie waiting to be noticed by the
conscientious Kate fan. Their surfaces reveal much about a child named
Catherine. Their interiors, I believe, hold even more about the artist we know
as Kate.]

<PRE>He is pushed forward from the steps.
Glistening eyes glare from around at the dropping figure.
Silence ceases and murmers gather quickly like the grabbing of a hand.
Guilty onlookers hide their eyes from the shame that they know and forbid to reveal.
Slowly the dimness falls.
The man weeps and his forsaken tears fall,
Slipping down the trembling and battered body onto the dust.
He collapses down onto the ground.
His head bruises past the stones, scarring his tear-stained face.
He staggers to his feet, groping toward his fate.
Sharply iron pierces flesh, and the shape is raised on the hill.
Stillness overcomes the cheering spectators,
And the mocked and pride-broken lead turns in outcry.
The people form and run down the hill.
With a last glance at his betrayers
He dissolves into a limp, dumb body,
As the blood-red sun sinks into the skull of a dead man.

<PRE>I have noticed him seven times or more
But he has not seen me.
He may have seen a girl called by
My name--
But neither he nor anyone else will
Ever really see me.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>Call me and I will come,
        Across stones of memories,
And I will follow the sun.
Blare, dare--they are others caring for none but...
What of them?
        They are stones among children's hands.
Sighing, crying they, are, memories.
They are the stones.
Call me and I will come.
Call me and I shall come,
        Tomorrow.
What of tomorrow? Time rhyme.
Through gates of glass I would follow the sun,
To run, to be free, to be me
I would flee from corridors of cobwebs.
        Hold me!
        Call me!
        And I will come.

<PRE>A word could not harm me.
A stone could not bruise me.
A gun could not shoot me,
        For I am not here.
Yet I come to receive you, to hold you,
        To keep you.
For I am Death. I am here.
And I speak, yet you are dumb.
        You cannot hear
        That I am here.

But I am gone,
And you come too.

<PRE>You are a person of unknown reasons,
Reacting with movements and noises.
You may be bold, wear glasses, or have freckles,
Yet inside you there may be great feelings
Of beauty and love, fighting to appear
On the pimpled surface.
It reaches out--&quot;I love you.&quot;
A laugh, a jeer.
The feelings are trapped and you,
You--disappear.

<PRE>The globe spins,
        Dragging collisions of clutches, to the end.
Blind Joe Death staggers to the instrument
        And caresses the soft wood of the neck.
He guides the dizzy fingers through
        The mist of Melancholy melody.
Blind Joe Death grins at Fahey
        And moves the cap up the strings.
        He stops.
Blind Joe Death dies.
He falls onto the round Persian mat
And swings the needle off the turntable.
        Fahey sleeps.

<PRE>The snowlet cover wet, gently, softly,
        And she turned.
All seasons were with, before and after her.
But now they all bade farewell.
Playing with thoughts of empty echoes,
        She turned.
The swan flew with curved wing
To the reed river of reality
        And pulled her,
Calling and leaping.
She heard the waving reeds whisper her name, gently, softly,
And she fell away before me
And under the cold hand of hope.
