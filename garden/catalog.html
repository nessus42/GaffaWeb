    <P>[Here is the latest version of my list of all the Kate Bush music that I
      know of. Note that this is not meant to be a discography, but simply a
      list of every snippet of KT music known by me to be in circulation.
      Recordings are listed in _rough_ chronological order. As a reference
      point, a very brief listing of Kate's official U.K. releases to date
      precedes the non-LP list. </P>
    
    <P>A complete discography, including all foreign pressings with their
      catalogue numbers, is impracticable. EMI has many, many divisions
      throughout the world. I have seen advertisements for EMI-Singapore
      pressings of two Kate Bush records. Who knows whether EMI-Pakistan, or
      EMI-Sri Lanka, or EMI-Sierra Leone haven't pressed some Kate Bush records,
      too? If there's one thing I've learned in my years of Kate Bush
      fanaticism, it is that even the wealthiest and most monomaniacal fan
      cannot hope to amass a &quot;complete&quot; colleKTion, or compile a
      definitive KaTalogue. </P>
    
    <P>Finally, I'd like to thank Peter FitzGerald-Morris, the editor of
      <CITE>Homeground</CITE>, who has tirelessly worked over the past seven
      years to keep an organized record of the facts of Kate's career. This
      catalogue, and all of the other lists included in <CITE>The Garden</CITE>,
      could not have been made were it not for Peter's invaluable chronological
      <CITE>Homeground</CITE> series, <CITE>Five Years Ago...</CITE> and
      <CITE>Medialog</CITE>, and the astonishingly good chronology which he
      compiled for EMI/IMP Publications' <CITE>Kate Bush Complete</CITE> (a
      re-edition of which will re-appear in Love-Hounds soon).] </P>

    <H3><A NAME="demos">Non-LP Music: Demo Recordings</A></H3>
    
    <P>Very little concrete information about Kate's early demo recordings has
      ever been made available to fans. The number of songs recorded, their
      titles, even their rough dates, remain obscure. Kate has only released one
      demo recording officially, the song <CITE>Passing Through Air</CITE>; and
      has played only a part of one other demo (a song known as <CITE>Maybe</CITE>)
      on the radio. More will be said of these recordings below. </P>
    
    <P> Kate first began writing simple songs from about 1969, when she was
      eleven years old. By 1971 she had written early versions of such songs as
      <CITE>The Man With the Child in His Eyes</CITE> and <CITE>The Saxaphone
      Song</CITE>. In 1972 she recorded a large number of songs herself, at
      home, with only her own piano accompaniment. With the help of a family
      friend named Ricky Hopper Kate submitted copies of these recordings to
      several publishing houses and record companies, without result. There were
      at least thirty songs on each of these tapes. It is not yet clear whether
      there were several different collections of thirty songs each, or whether
      copies were made of a single collection of thirty; but Kate has said that
      by the time she went in to record the first album, <CITE>The Kick Inside</CITE>,
      in 1977, she had accumulated finished versions of about two hundred songs,
      so it is quite possible that those first demos of 1972-73 numbered more
      than thirty. </P>
    
    <P> It is very difficult to know how fully developed Kate's art was by
      1972. The earliest Kate Bush recording which fans can give a solid date to
      is <CITE>Passing Through Air</CITE>. But this recording belongs to a
      <EM>second</EM> group of demos. Recorded in the summer of 1973, at which
      time Kate was either fourteen or fifteen years old, <CITE>Passing Through
      Air</CITE> was a result of her first recording session with a band. This
      track was recorded at David Gilmour's home studio, under his direction,
      along with an unspecified number of other original Kate Bush compositions,
      including a song which Kate has never publicly given a title, but which
      fans have come to refer to as <CITE>Maybe</CITE>. <EM>N.B.: Some
      confusion has arisen by the similarity in title between <CITE>Maybe</CITE>--which
      may once have had an alternate title, <CITE>Davey</CITE>--and a
      solo-piano demo recording of a song which has come to be known as <CITE>While
      Davey Dozed</CITE>, or sometimes simply <CITE>Davey</CITE>. The two songs
      are completely different.</EM> </P>
    
    <P> Following the rejection of the thirty-song solo demo-tapes (ca.
      '72-73), family friend Ricky Hopper made contact with David Gilmour (of
      Pink Floyd), whom he had known during his student years at Cambridge
      University. Gilmour listened first to some of the solo recordings, and
      then had Kate perform for him in person. To his great credit, he was
      impressed. He arranged a rehearsal with Kate at his own home. With drummer
      Peter Perrier, bassist Pat Martin (both members of the group Unicorn) and
      Gilmour himself on electric guitar, Kate, singing and playing piano,
      recorded simple demo recordings of several of her own songs (probably a
      dozen or more), among which were the versions of <CITE>Passing Through
      Air</CITE> and the so-called <CITE>Maybe</CITE> which fans know today.
      (Kate has never released the latter song officially, but she did play an
      excerpt of it during an appearance on a British radio programme.) </P>
    
    <P> Ten recordings from these early Gilmour sessions briefly appeared in
      the form of an album (possibly East or West German) known as <CITE>Kate
      Bush: The Early Years</CITE>. Few people have actually seen this album,
      but Peter FitzGerald-Morris, while insisting that he does not own a copy,
      nevertheless did print the track-listing in his fanzine <CITE>Homeground</CITE>.
      It is important to remember that none of the titles in that track-listing
      has been authenticated by Kate herself. They are probably only make-shift
      titles suggested by words the producers of the album thought they heard in
      Kate's demo-vocals. In fact one title in the list is almost certainly
      incorrect. With that qualification duly made, I list the titles from the
      <CITE>Early Years</CITE> collection: </P>
    <OL>
      <LI> Something Like a Song. </LI>
      <LI> Need Your Loving. (Clearly this is simply <CITE>Passing Through Air</CITE>.)
      </LI>
      <LI> Davey. (Also known as <CITE>Maybe</CITE>, this is the same
        recording which Kate played part of on the radio once, and it should
        <EM>not</EM> be confused with another early song, <CITE>While Davey
        Dozed</CITE>.) </LI>
      <LI> You Were the Star. </LI>
      <LI> Gay Farewell. </LI>
      <LI> Cussi Cussi. </LI>
      <LI> Atlantis. </LI>
      <LI> Sunsi. </LI>
      <LI> Disbelieving Angel. </LI>
      <LI> Go Now While You Can. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>These first Gilmour-produced demo recordings also failed to interest the
      labels. In 1975, therefore, Gilmour arranged for and financed (again to
      his credit) another recording session, this time under fully professional
      conditions. Only three songs were recorded: <CITE>The Man With the Child
      in His Eyes</CITE>, <CITE>The Saxophone Song</CITE> and a new version of
      the song known as <CITE>Maybe</CITE>. The first and second of these three
      recordings were later incorporated, almost without changes, into Kate's
      debut album for EMI, <CITE>The Kick Inside</CITE>. The third of these
      recordings was a more polished version of the song which Kate played part
      of an <EM>earlier</EM> version of on the radio programme <CITE>Personal
      Call</CITE>. <EM>That</EM> version, from the <EM>first</EM> Gilmour (&quot;house&quot;)
      sessions, is presumably included in the <CITE>Early Years</CITE> LP. The
      <EM>second</EM> version has never been heard by fans. </P>
    
    <P> This new set of three demos, together with Gilmour's personal backing,
      finally succeeded in obtaining a contract for Kate with EMI. In 1976 Kate
      bought a modest piano for 200 Pounds and, according to Peter, began only
      then to &quot;screech into existence her unmistakable voice.&quot; </P>
    
    <P> Then, according to Peter, Kate went on to record two more &quot;tapes&quot;
      of demos during the months surrounding the LP sessions. Peter has not
      explained or substantiated these statements, but if we assume that they
      are true, then it would seem that another set of twenty-two demo
      recordings, which has now begun to circulate among fans in at least two
      forms, dates from about this time--i.e., ca. 1976-1977. </P>
    
    <P> These twenty-two tracks have only started to surface within the fan
      community since the spring of 1989. The first sign of their existence came
      in the form of a bootleg seven-inch EP (anonymously pressed and
      distributed) called <CITE>Kate Bush: The Cathy Demos, Volume One.</CITE>
      This EP contained four tracks, the first four of a twenty-two-track
      collection of demos, all of which featured Kate singing alone and
      accompanying herself at the piano without backup. Volumes Two and Three
      have since quietly appeared on the market, and at least one more EP will
      appear soon. </P>
    
    <P> Meanwhile, a cassette, also entirely anonymous in origin, but sometimes
      called <CITE>Fiddle</CITE> (a reference to the song <CITE>Violin</CITE>),
      became available through classified ads and at U.S. record swapmeets in
      1989. This cassette contained a total of twenty-two tracks, the first four
      of which, in vastly superior sound, appeared as the &quot;Cathy Demos
      Volume One&quot; EP. &lt;Volume Two contained the next five tracks, and
      Volume Three contained the next six after that.&gt; (The sound
      reproduction on the cassettes is noticeably inferior to that found on the
      vinyl EP.) </P>
    
    <P> Most recently, sixteen of these same recordings appeared in LP form,
      under the titles &quot;Cathy's Album&quot; and &quot;The Sensual Woman&quot;.
      A follow-up bootleg LP is rumored to be scheduled for release early in the
      spring of 1990, and it will contain the remaining tracks from the original
      collection of twenty-two, as well as a group of other unrelated rare
      recordings (about which the reader may learn more below). </P>
    
    <P> If Peter's claims about Kate's development of her high range only after
      the beginning of 1976 are accurate, then we must conclude that this
      collection of twenty-two songs dates from the period 1976-1977. Certainly
      the sophistication of Kate's compositional style, lyrics and keyboard work
      support such a dating. On the other hand, if the collection dates from
      1976 or 1977, then we must accept the notion that Kate was re-recording
      songs (such as &quot;Something Like a Song&quot;, &quot;Disbelieving Angel&quot;
      and &quot;Davey&quot;) which she had already composed four or even five
      years earlier, and which she had recorded with Gilmour during her first
      sessions with a band in the summer of 1973. This is possible, of course,
      but it also suggests the possibility that the collection of twenty-two
      songs dates from considerably earlier than 1976. Whatever the correct date
      of the recordings, they are an absolutely invaluable document of Kate's
      early talent and astoundingly precocious mastery of the crafts of
      songwriting and performance. </P>
    
    <P> With the exception of the five titles which have since been
      authenticated through their inclusion in Kate's albums, the titles on the
      following list of twenty-two songs are completely hypothetical, and in
      some cases may not even accurately reflect the songs' lyrical content.
      They are merely temporary and tentative titles which are used solely to
      facilitate identification of individual songs. In some cases I have not
      even been sure of the words I have chosen to represent the songs, because
      the sound quality of the recordings is not clear enough to enable me to
      decipher the lyrics properly. These disclaimers made, then, here are the
      twenty-two songs which make up, for want of a better group title, the &quot;Cathy

    <P>An additional six demo recordings have recently begun to circulate among
      fans, in very poor-quality audio. These recordings are of a far more
      refined and polished type, and are fully orchestrated and produced. They
      would seem to have been recorded in 1976 or 1977, and are probably among
      the many tracks which were worked on prior to the final selection of the
      thirteen songs on &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. Five of the titles are
      familiar: &quot;Moving&quot;, &quot;Don't Push Your Foot on the Heart
      Brake&quot;, &quot;L'Amour Looks Something Like You&quot;, &quot;Kite&quot;
      and &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;. They are very professional in sound,
      but Kate's vocals seem (perhaps only in hindsight) a bit constrained by
      the backing rhythm, and the tone of some of the instrumentalists' work
      sounds inappropriately lightweight for the songs, in comparison with their
      official versions. </P>
    
    <P> The sixth track from this group of demos is an unreleased song called &quot;Scares
      Me Silly&quot;. Apparently an effort by Kate to make a very pop-oriented
      tune, it is extremely bouncy and catchy, laden with melodic hooks. Its
      lyrics are fascinating, as well (they describe the challenge of retaining
      the original spark of feeling of a song during the recording process).
      Perhaps the song's carefree tone may have been the reason for its omission
      from &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, though as is often the case with Kate's
      music, the lyrics belie the song's light-hearted sound. </P>
    
    <P> Finally, there are at least two known demo versions of the song &quot;Babooshka&quot;.
      Excerpts from the demos were apparently played by Kate herself on a
      British radio programme ca. 1980 or 1982. (I have heard that she played
      demos of &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; as well, although this has never been
      confirmed.) The first demo of &quot;Babooshka&quot; features Kate on
      piano, and she has added one backing vocal during the choruses. The second
      version has a percussion pattern from an early rhythm-box, and features a
      synthesizer and, in addition to the lead vocal, at least two over-dubbed

    <P> The six demos from ca. 1976-77 and the two demos of &quot;Babooshka&quot;
      are both rumored to be included in the forthcoming bootleg album follow-up
      to &quot;Cathy's Album&quot;. This second LP will also (it is rumored)
      contain Kate's never-released cover version of &quot;Brazil&quot;, the
      title song from the Terry Gilliam film, for which Michael Kamen composed
      the orchestral score. (Don't expect to hear this version in the film
      itself--it was recorded for the soundtrack album only, after the film had
      already been released, and if it ever becomes available, it will be
      through the bootleg market.) </P>

      <LI> On Stage.
        
        <P> A four-track EP of &quot;live&quot; performances from the Tour of
          Life, featuring &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, &quot;Don't Push Your
          Foot on the Heart Brake&quot;, &quot;L'Amour Looks Something Like You&quot;,and
          a long version of &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot;. The original
          performances were taken from the May 13, 1979 concert at London's
          Hammersmith Odeon, and then re-mixed in the studio. These were mixed
          differently for the subsequent film soundtrack, so that the
          performance which is the common source of EP and film seems quite
          different in the latter version. </P>

      <LI> The official video release of excerpts from the same May 13, 1979
        date, including performances of twelve songs from the Tour of Life.
        There are many significant musical changes from the LP versions,
        including a long instrumental introduction to &quot;Kite&quot;, and an
        early version of &quot;Violin&quot; (with non-LP lyrics).

      <LI> Kate Bush--In Concert.
        
        <P> A German/Dutch TV documentary featuring a long interview and live
          performances of songs from the Tour of Life that were never officially
          released. The concert footage comes from the Hamburg and Mannheim
          shows. </P>

<PRE></PRE> </LI>
      
      <LI> Wow.
        
        <P> One of the earliest bootleg Kate Bush albums, this 2-LP set was put
          out in 1983 by a New York-based outfit. It consists of a transfer onto
          vinyl of the &quot;Hammersmith&quot; video's audio track (see entry
          no. 9), and another vinyl transfer of the audio portion of Kate's 1979
          U.K. Christmas TV special (see entry no. 14 below for details about
          this latter program). Both recordings have appeared more recently in a
          made-in-U.K. bootleg 2-LP set called &quot;Moving&quot;, as well; and
          also as two of the three records which comprise the recent U.S.-made &quot;Kate
          Bush Live in Europe '79-'80&quot; bootleg set. In addition, nine
          tracks from &quot;Hammersmith&quot; turned up as a third bootleg LP
          called &quot;A Bird in the Hand&quot;. There are several additional
          editions of these tapes to be found. </P>

      <LI> Live in Paris '79.
        
        <P> Another bootleg by the New York group, this record features part of
          the Paris concert, which was given at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees
          on May 6, 1979. The album includes some interesting versions of LP
          tracks, including the very different live arrangement of &quot;Egypt&quot;.
          The identical recording was also included as the third LP in the more
          recent &quot;Live in Europe '79-'80&quot; bootleg set mentioned in
          entry no. 11 above. This first edition is identified as being a
          production of the non-existent &quot;Fan Club of Taiwan&quot;. The
          same recording has also appeared as a bootleg audio-cassette. </P>

<PRE></PRE> </LI>
      
      <LI> Dreamtime, Bristol Concert; etc.
        
        <P> Many titles for various bootleg recordings of a number of dates
          from the Tour of Life concert series. Among these are the Bristol,
          London Palladium and Manchester dates. They feature not only songs,
          but a chant, readings by John Carder Bush, and incidental bits of
          music, all of which were heard while Kate changed costumes in between
          songs during the concert. Specifically, there are: a heartbeat passage
          preceding &quot;Room For the Life&quot;; an ethnic chant performed by
          the band in unison; two synthesizer introductions to songs; three
          brief readings by John--one known as &quot;Two in One Coffin&quot;
          (preceding &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;), the others passages of
          unidentified prose (perhaps by John); an arrangement of Satie's 1st &quot;Gymnopedie&quot;,
          which is used to frame &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;, and a short jam
          session by the KT Bush Band. Also of note is the live version of &quot;Egypt&quot;,
          which sounds very different from the LP version. </P>

      <LI> Kate.
        
        <P> This was a forty-five minute TV special which aired in England on
          December 28, 1979; sometimes called the &quot;Christmas Special&quot;.
          In addition to a couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one or two new
          vocal performances of old songs, several new and unique bits of music
          appeared on this show. They include a brief introduction, an
          arrangement of part of Satie's &quot;First Gymnopedie&quot; (as an
          introduction to &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;); an early version of &quot;December
          Will Be Magic Again&quot;; a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel
          (Kate's guest on the show--he sings &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot;),
          sometimes referrred to as &quot;Peter, the Angel Gabriel&quot;; a
          brief bit of blues piano; and a duet with Peter of Roy Harper's song,
          &quot;Another Day&quot;.</P>

<PRE></PRE> </LI>
      
      <LI> Another Day.
        
        <P> Approximately one year after taping the &quot;Kate&quot; special,
          Kate and Peter Gabriel returned to the studio to re-record this song.
          It was never released, however, and has never been heard. </P>

<PRE></PRE> </LI>
      
      <LI> Ibizza. (sic--possibly Ibiza, after the Spanish island.)
        
        <P> A song co-written by Kate and Gabriel and originally intended as
          the b-side for the single of &quot;Another Day&quot;. They were &quot;not
          satisfied with the results&quot;, however, and the project was
          shelved. Consequently, no-one has ever heard this track. </P>

<PRE></PRE> </LI>
      
      <LI> Let It Be.
        
        <P> A live performance of the Beatles song, sung by Steve Harley, Peter
          Gabriel and Kate Bush during a modified Tour of Life show, staged at
          London's Hammersmith Odeon on May 12, 1979 for the benefit of the
          surviving relatives of Bill Duffield, Kate's lighting director for the
          Tour, who had died in an accident at the very beginning of the tour.
          An excerpt from this performance appears in a very limited edition red
          plastic flexi-disc, made officially by the Kate Bush Club for the
          Japanese branch of the Club. In addition to the excerpt from the song,
          the flexi-disc includes brief spoken messages from John Carder Bush
          and Kate. A longer excerpt of the same song (but without the spoken
          messages) has recently appeared on a 1987 2-LP bootleg set called &quot;Passing
          Through Air&quot;-- the only unusual material to be found on that
          bootleg album, which otherwise consists primarily of more than usually
          illegal, poor-quality re-pressings of official EMI b-sides and
          re-mixes. In addition to songs from The Tour of Life, this concert
          featured a version of &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; with verses sung
          by Harley and Gabriel; &quot;The Woman With the Child in Her Eyes&quot;
          sung by Harley and Gabriel; Gabriel's &quot;I Don't Remember&quot;
          sung as a duet by Gabriel and Kate; and Harley's &quot;Come Up and See
          Me&quot;, sung by Harley, with Kate and Gabriel on backing vocals. A
          poor recording of a few excerpts from the Duffy concert surfaced ca.
          1987 as a bootleg live album called &quot;If You Could See Me Fly&quot;,
          an album which also included excerpts from two early demo versions of
          &quot;Babooshka&quot;.</P>

          Paul Webster. No soundtrack was ever commercially released;
          consequently, the song is only known from the nearly unlistenable film

          soundtrack LP--which, however, will probably never be officially
          released. A bootleg pressing of Kate's recording for the album may
          become available eventually, however. </P>

      <LI> Be Kind to My Mistakes (soundtrack album version).
        
        <P> Theme song which Kate wrote and recorded for the 1987 Nicholas Roeg
          film, &quot;Castaway&quot;. This version appeared on the soundtrack
          album, and is the original, full-length mix. An abridged version of
          the same recording was heard during the title-sequence of the film
          itself. See entry number 69 for further information about this song.

      <LI> This Woman's Work.
        
        <P> Theme song for the 1987 John Hughes film &quot;She's Having a Baby&quot;,
          released in February 1988. (For some months prior to its release this
          song was sometimes referred to by fans as &quot;Make It Go Away&quot;,
          because of the prominence of that phrase in the song.) Two later mixes
          of this song exist. See entries nos. 70 and 71. </P>

        <P> A track from Go West's 1987 album &quot;Dancing on the Couch&quot;.
          Kate sings backing vocals. She probably agreed to contribute to this
          track because of her friendship with the late guitarist Alan Murphy,
          who was an unofficial member of Go West at the time. </P>

        <P> Kate sings one line in a guest appearance for the &quot;all-star&quot;
          recording of a song (not written by Kate) about the dwindling rain
          forests of South America. This song was recorded for and broadcast
          during a programme about ecological issues called &quot;Our Common
          Future&quot; in 1989. As with the Zeebrugge &quot;Let It Be&quot;
          charity record (see entry 60), Kate did not participate in the group
          chorus sessions, but came in at a different time to sing her one line
          alone. </P>

      <LI> Rocket Man.
        
        <P> A plan to record a cover version of Elton John's song, as part of a
          compilation of recordings by various artists in a tribute to John and
          his lyricist Bernie Taupin, has been scratched and re-scheduled more
          than once now. As of January 1990 is has been de-activated, and there
          is no sign that the song will ever be released. </P>

          during a segment of an episode from the British music series, &quot;Rhythms

          Rupkhina's solo. </P>

      <LI> Rocket's Tail (excerpt of an early mix).
        
        <P> This extract of an early, &quot;rough&quot; version of &quot;Rocket's
          Tail&quot; is found in a segment from the British music series, &quot;Rhythms
          of the World&quot; (see number 67). During this segment Kate is seen
          at a mixing desk with Kevin Killen (?), supervising the vocal
          contributions of the Trio Bulgarka. </P>

      <LI> Be Kind to My Mistakes (remix).
        
        <P> A supplementary track on the CD-single of &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;,
          this version of the song Kate wrote for Nicholas Roeg's film &quot;Castaway&quot;
          in 1987 is drastically abridged and re-mixed. </P>

        <P> This version of the song which Kate wrote for the John Hughes film &quot;She's
          Having a Baby&quot; is a very slight remix of the original. It was
          remixed by Kevin Killen, probably in order to fit the timbre of the
          rest of the album, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. </P>
