<P>[Here is Paddy's sixteenth article for the Newsletter. It appeared in the
twenty-third issue (Fall 1989).] 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P> ...I suppose that I must have been about seventeen years old. I was working
for the English Folk Dance and Song Society in a little cupboard. We dealt with
traditional music and stuff to do with folklore and dancing. It was quite a
scene: it was the early days of the Sixties 'folk revival,', there were a lot of
guys with beards and girls in tartan dresses, the odd vicar dressed as a
hobby-horse, people would sing unaccompanied songs often with a finger in one
ear, arran sweaters, concertinas, sword-dances, portable tape-recorders,
corn-dollies, bagpipes, penny-whistles and Appalachian dulcimers... 
</P>
<P> An outside world of hevercraft and mini-skirts skimmed by, as I sold
tickets and insytruments and books to these various folk. I had a pretty good
working knowledge of all our stock and new releases, so one snowy Saturday I
found myself confused when I saw an album on the counter that I didn't recognize
and had no reference for. Its name was A Cool Day and Crooked Corn. So I placed
it on our phonograph platter and accidentally exploded an atomic bomb in my
life. 
</P>
<P> I sat there trasfixed over my Kit-Kat and cup of tea, almost wishing I
wasn't hearing this. I couldn't understand a single word, and yet this thing
seemed to be liquidizing my soul. A group of girls from New York singing in
supernatural harmony and involved in their own kind of revival: the music of
Bulgaria. [I have tracked down this record, and have discovered that, indeed,
The Pennywhistlers managed to create an extraordinarily accurate reproduction of
the authentic a cappella female vocal-group sound which more recent converts to
Bulgarian music have become acquainted with through the recordings of The
Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir and The Trio Bulgarka.
Their voices lack perhaps a little of the Bulgarians' original power, but their
elocution and musicality seem, to this amateur enthusiast, at least, very
convincing.] 
</P>
<P> By the time I had played the album continuously three or four times, the
snow was pouring down. A young couple came into the shop--if you would like the
details, the man looked a bit like a Swedish Tom Petty in an Afghan coat, which
was a rare garment in those days, and the young lady was small with short dark
hair and very beautiful. They were my first customers of the day. I said, 
</P>
<P> &quot;Hello. Isn't this music beautiful? I've just found it sitting on the
counter...&quot; 
</P>
<P> She said, &quot;It's our record.&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't know who it belonged to. I just found it here. I
hope you don't mind me playing it...&quot; 
</P>
<P> &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;No, it's our record. Look on the back. My
name is Ethel Raim, and this is my group, The Pennywhistlers.&quot; 
</P>
<P> I looked on the back and there was a picture of Ethel and her friends. I
looked straight up, and there she was, standing in front of me. We talked about
Bulgarian music and instruments. She even autographed a photo for my little
sister Kate. 
</P>
<P> You could say that I became obsessed with the album, the sound of their
voices and the shapes of the words, and long after I stopped working there
Ethel's music was my constant companion. 
</P>
<P> It opened a door into a huge world of tradition. In many ways I had taken a
finger out of my ear so I could listen in stereo; and I found myself in a
whirlpool of music, magic and marvel. 
</P>
<P> These are the bottom rungs of a ladder that stretches through time and
leads to here: The Sensual World of Kate and her sisters Eva, Stoyanka and
Yanka--The Trio Bulgarka. 
</P>
<P> This ladder is so long now that time and weirdness are insufficient for me
to give you the individual steps and influences that brought us to the point of
this unique collaboration. I hope it's a combination that will please you. 
</P>
<P> Let me tell you something else I'd like to get straight with you concerning
the title track...If you look at the credits you can see that it says that I am
playing whips on the track. This is a mistake made by some silly person that
didn't ask. I'm playing a pair of fishing rods. I wanted to get the impression
of a rich Irish lakeland, and the swishing sound of the rods should conjure the
atmosphere of fly-fishing, tweed hats and long Wellingtons. However, the idea of
whips is a long way from my original intention, so please accept my apologies,
as I feel this credit is misleading. 
</P>
<P> OK...What's a valiha? 
</P>
<P> It's the instrument on Love and Anger that starts and ends the track, and
sounds a little like a classical guitar, but it's not. It comes from the island
of Madagascar, and is a kind of box-shaped harp about four feet in length, with
strings on two sides. The strings are made from untwisted bicycle brake-cable.
There is a little wooden bridge under each string for tuning, and the strings
are plucked with the tips of the fingers... 
</P>
<P> There's someone out there that I owe a big thankyou to. We can't find your
name. We know you live in Holland, and several years ago you sent a cassette to
us of a selection of your favourite tunes, including Rosina de Peira,
harmony-singing from the Bahamas, and some Macedonian a-la-Turk ensemble
music...You must know who you are by now, and that you are an unsung rung on the
ladder, so get in touch and be recognized, and in the time in between please
accept my thanks and a kiss from my sister. [The person in question is Jan
Libbenga, a music journalist who provided a tape of a version of the Macedonian
melody which Kate subsequently arranged for Irish instruments and recorded on
the title track of her album. Unfortunately for Mr. Libbenga, he did not wait to
read the above graceful acknowledgement by Paddy and Kate, but lost no time in
publishing a mean-minded accusation in a Dutch music journal which accused Kate
of &quot;fraud&quot;.] 
</P>
<P> Other helpful folk include: Joe Boyd, Sally Reeves, Judy Greenwell,
Borimira Nedeva, Rumyana Tzintzarska, Nellie Tzvetkova, Fred Muller, Zandra
Markus, Patrick Jauneaud, John Porter, Mitra and Lubimka Bisserov [The Bisserovs
are another, younger Bulgarian female vocal ensemble who became friends with
Kate during her involvement with the Bulgarians' concerts in England and
Europe], Melanie Spriggs, Professor Lee Saunders, Jim and Haydn [Bendall] and
Ken from Abbey Road Studios, Roy and Jacqui Harper, Dave and Toni Arthur, Chris
Thomas and Ian of Audio-Venue, Guy Marriot, Dr. Smola &amp; Dr. Crausse of
Supraphon Records, Dave Clancey of Casio, Rev. Normal [this last is an inside
joke: the Reverend Normal is a character in some of Del's and Paddy's articles
from earlier issues of the Newsletter.] Thank you for your kindness and help.
