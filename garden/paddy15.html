<P>[Here is Paddy's fifteenth article for the Newsletter. It appeared in the
twenty-second issue (Christmas 1987).]

<H3>Paddy's Tower of Digital Delights</H3>
<P>On soot-black nights such as these, a traveller in the vicinity of Bush
Towers might chance to be guided by a strange and spooky pinky-blue light
flickering high up from one of the west-wing windows. And should he cast his
glance upwards he may well behold silhouetted in the frame a weird and strange
figure gazing down at him. I'm sure you won't have to stretch your imagination
too far to realise that could well be me. 
</P>
<P> Taking a break from the computer and resting the eyes from the bright
lights of the monitor, I remember a time when computers were operated by men
with white coats and spectacles. Those were the days. Now ordinary people are
processing megaflumps of data in the privacy of their own battlements.
Fantastic, isn't it? 
</P>
<P> Perhaps not to everyone's taste, but it looks like it's changing things in
a big way for today's musicians, whose data requirements are so excessive. 
</P>
<P> It looks like it's about to change the life of the strange traveller
outside who happens to be looking up at my window instead of where he should be
going. I hope there's some water in the moat--it's a bit too far down to see
clearly. 
</P>
<P> Yes, floppies spin to the hum of the disk-drives. This technology is so
versatile. I've been connecting everything to everything. It's astounding what
can be done. I've got the computer interfaced with the synthesiser, sampler,
printer, reverberation, fridge, lights, waste disposal, water heater,
drawbridge, etc. There seems to be no end to the possibilities! In fact, a
message is going up on the screen right now...it says, &quot;Attention. Intruder
in moat.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Well, how about that! It's a jolly good example of what can be done with a
few old sensors, a big bundle of wire, an old ballcock and the odd servo or two,
all interfaced to a totally brilly computer. In fact, it sounds like it's
running a bath for me right now, that's remarkable! You know, a few years ago
none of this would have been possible. To think that in a minute or so the old
microwave will plink into action and this evening's &quot;macaroni au tordu&quot;
will bubble and hiss into life as if by magic. In the past I would have been out
in the hazel copse whacking away with the old machete, then focusing the sun's
rays through some scratched up magnifying-glass, just to make a cup of tea. How
things change. And even as we speak, the robotic tea system I fixed up on
Wednesday is responding to a stream of highly complex machine-code addresses,
and a cybernetic arm lifts and rotates the spoon module. It's a little like
those ones you see in films on nuclear power stations, and it's at work right
now, which is pretty good timing as there should be a weather report from Tokyo
coming in on the modem any moment. Best to keep in touch with world meteorology
as we have the odd problem here with high winds and lightning, not to mention
the fog which can often lurk for days around the lower floors. Once upon a time
I would have been forced to watch the flight of the wild geese, tap a mercury
barometer or closely scrutinise a warty frond of seaweed. 
</P>
<P> This technology is advancing so fast, surely it's only a matter of months
before I can send Kate a fleet of Rumanian bagpipers down the telephone.
Actually I tried that the other day, but it didn't work out too well. Still,
experimentation is what it's all about, and what with this big-bang
computerisation of the stock market and me with a telephone link, I think you
could say that this is an area where a complete beginner can make quite an
impact...However, I'm rambling somewhat, and there's a little flashing display
on the screen informing me that someone has sent me some electronic-mail, and if
I just press this button...I can see it's from Kate...Perhaps you would like to
know what it says, so I'll punch in my security code, if I can remember it.
Actually, it would be better to instruct the tea-making process to stop, as
things look out of hand over there...Which is a bit difficult at the moment, as
Japan is on-line and there is an unusual whistling in the macaroni-zone... No
problem, just tab in a drop of data...and...That's odd, the boiler has stopped.
Oh well, I'll check that one out in a moment. Anyway, this technology is
fantastic and...What the hell's going on up on the roof? Maybe I should
investigate this as I haven't got round to completely finishing the mounts for
the sixty-foot diameter satellite-dish that I knocked up the other day...But I'm
sure there was something I was supposed to remember...Of course, the security
code for Kate's message.. d's I.D.:**********! enter... The monitor is
flashing...It says: &quot;Good evening, Paddy...There are two messages for you.
Please select which you would like first. You have two categories of message:
category a, &quot;Urgent&quot;; category b, &quot;Most urgent&quot;.. 
</P>
<P> Decisions, decisions...Let's try the first...select...enter: &quot;Pad,
your bath is overflowing...Love, Kate.&quot; 
</P>
<P> Perhaps I should have a quick glance at category b: &quot;Paddy, there is a
man from the Water Board trapped in the drawbridge of the west wing.&quot; 
</P>
<P> I think she's more likely playing a little joke on me, as most people know
that this wing doesn't actually face west, more a south-westerly aspect, which
is a little prone to summer gales, as I'm sure most weatherwise people would
agree. 
</P>
<P> What is that noise? Why am I asking you anyway? It does sound somewhat like
a waste-disposal unit, but on nights like this it's a bit difficult to tell...
