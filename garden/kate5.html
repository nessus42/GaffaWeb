<H3>&quot;A Could Be Story&quot;</H3>
<P>When the Shades went into Priory Street Studios to make their third album
they were working on a very tight schedule. Their first album had made the top
sixty but their second had hardly done anything at all, and now their third one
had to be good or they would have difficulty in getting another recording
contract. They felt they needed to find a Christmas single that would help them
out of their troubles, but they only had until the end of November to get this
together. Any later than that and the record company would be unable to bring a
single out--even November was cutting it pretty fine! They had decided to try
something different on the new album and had become interested again in the
music that was around in the middle 50s. 
</P>
<P>They had come across a song that none of them had ever heard of before, and
it could be the one they were looking for. The song was called I'm Riding With
Santa Tonight, by someone called Billy Smith. They decided they would give it a
very genuine Bill Haley treatment, with saxophones and lots of
shoo-bops-doo-wah-woo-bops-di-wops. 
</P>
<P>They worked on the rhythm track the first day, putting onto tape the drums,
bass guitar and some funky rock-and-roll piano, with a rough voice-track to keep
it all together. Late that night they played the various takes they'd done, to
choose the one they would keep. Half way through listening to the first take the
recording engineer started to look worried and began pressing buttons and
pulling down slide controls on his mixing desk where all the sounds were
controlled. When he was asked what was the matter, he said he was starting to
pick up interference on the track that certainly hadn't been put on there by any
of the band during the day. This was the first time he had worked in Priory
Street Studios, and he was not used to the equipment. He played back the bit
that he thought was wrong, and there was quite clearly a whining sound breaking
in on the track. It could have been a loose connection, or even one of the
band's stomachs rumbling. 
</P>
<P>They listened to all the takes, but the interference was there on each one,
and the engineer couldn't find a way of shifting it. This meant a whole day of
studio time had been wasted, and feeling pretty disappointed with their first
attempt at a comeback, the Shades slid back home in the early hours to get some
sleep before starting again the following day. 
</P>
<P>At two o'clock the next afternoon they turned up at the studio and did the
rhythm track once again. But on listening to it that evening, instead of the
interference having been cleaned off, it was now even more noticeable, and the
engineer could not understand what was happening. It put him in a difficult
situation because the band were now talking about using other studios; but he'd
been booked for the next two months to do the album, and he was determined that
was what he was going to do. After a lot of arguing and shouting the Shades were
sitting on one side of the studio and the recording engineer and his assistant
on the other and they weren't talking. 
</P>
<P>At that point the roadie who looked after the Shades' equipment came
bouncing into the studio hoping to get an earful of what had been going on for
the last couple of days. When he saw the glum faces he knew something was up,
and had great difficulty in persuading the engineer to let him hear the tape.
Eventually he was persuaded, and the roadie sat back and listened with a
critical ear. The Shades knew that he never missed spotting a potential hit
single and they often used him as a test of their music. 
</P>
<P>When the track came to the bit with the heavy interference the roadie began
to brighten up, much to the surprise of everyone else in the room. When the
track had finished, he said it was one of the best things he'd ever heard, and
how on earth did they get the amazing effects? The engineer had to say that it
was a mistake, and they'd been trying to get rid of it. The roadie said that
that was ridiculous, and he managed to persuade everybody that if they pretended
it wasn't interference but a very interesting form of synthesiser, it could be
the hook needed on the record to make it sell. So it was agreed that the Shades
would come back in the next day and put down some guitar work and talk about the
vocals. 
</P>
<P>On the third day, at the end of the evening, they played back an almost
completed track, apart from the lead vocals. Once again, the interference was
there, and once again, if anything, it seemed to be a lot more dominant. But
they had to agree with the roadie that it certainly did give the song a lot of
crackle and bite. When the lead vocal was put on and the track finished and
ready to go off to the record company for their approval--and hopefully then for
release as a single--they all gathered for one final listen. 
</P>
<P>The odd thing was that the interference now seemed to have mellowed out, and
was almost adding a very strange sort of harmony to the lead singer's voice. But
everyone agreed that the track was good, and that it could work. 
</P>
<P>When I'm Riding With Santa Tonight eventually reached number ten on the hit
parade, the Shades arrived at the Top of the Pops studio to appear for a
Christmas edition and sing their hit single. While they were waiting in the
canteen to be called up to perform, they talked with a producer friend and
mentioned that they had recorded the single at Priory Street Studios. He nodded
his head to show that he knew the studios, and then asked them if they'd had any
trouble with the ghost. 
</P>
<P>The Shades looked at each other, and went whiter than the white make-up they
wore on stage. The producer explained to them that Priory Street Studios had a
reputation for its ghost, and that at one time the owners had thought of closing
down the studio because of the electrical interference they kept getting on
takes. They had gone as far as taking out all the equipment, having it
thoroughly looked at and put back in again, but this had made no difference. In
the early 70s the Studios had been completely re-modernised, and he'd assumed
that the troubles were over, but he had heard that occasionally they still had
problems. 
</P>
<P>The Shades didn't say anything, but after doing a strong appearance--though
it was a rather shaky one--on the television, they went for a celebration party
at a friend's house. They now had a good talk about the ghost story they'd
heard, and they were all wondering whether it was the ghost that had made the
single a success. 
</P>
<P>The following day they sent their roadie off to the publishing company where
they'd found the song, with the job of looking through the catalogues and
finding anything he could about the song and the songwriter. That evening he met
them at the studio with some very interesting news. It seemed that Billy Smith,
who had written I'm Riding With Santa Tonight, recorded his first and only album
at Priory Street Studios. All the songs on the album were his own
compositions--this was quite unusual in those days, as most of the early
rock-and-roll singers in England sang other people's songs. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, just after the album had been completed he'd been
electrocuted in the Studios when something had gone wrong with his electric
guitar. The record company hadn't thought much of his album anyway, so it was
shelved and eventually completely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>The Shades thought this was a pretty good reason for a ghost to hang about
the studios and, wondering how they could best express their thanks to the dead
rock singer, they decided to put a credit on the album--&quot;Ghost Synthesiser
by Billy Smith&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Apparently there has been no more trouble with interference at Priory Street
Studios, which probably goes to show that a ghost is quite content when his
music has eventually reached his public. 
</P>
<P>-- Kate 
</P>
<P>[Perhaps it's worth mentioning that this story came out at about the same
time that Kate was working on the early version of her Christmas recording,
December Will Be Magic Again, a song that she also performed on two British
television programmes during the same period. (The song was finally released a
year or so later.) Also, Kate has commented more than once since that time on
the powerful sense of history she experienced while working in Abbey Road
Studios.]
