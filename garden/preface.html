<P>Welcome to The Garden. 
</P>
<P> If you are relatively new to the work of Kate Bush, the collection of
original and re-printed lists, texts and interviews which comprise this set of
reference books will help you to catch up on a subject which has been getting
larger and more complicated every day for the past thirteen years. Even if
you've followed Kate's music for a while already, some of the material here may
still be of interest. 
</P>
<P> For as long as it remains affordable to me, there will be no charge for
these books. If you own them, they are a gift from one Kate fan to another. I
suspect Kate would prefer it that way. Unfortunately, due to the printing and
postage costs of The Garden, which now amount to about $70.00 (within the
U.S.--as much as $120.00 for overseas air-mail delivery), I cannot afford to
make the books widely available. the next edition. 
</P>
<P> With a few exceptions, the catalogues and texts contained in The Garden
were compiled, transcribed and edited by me. Except where otherwise indicated
all comments contained in brackets ([ ]) are mine. Any comments contained in
parentheses (as distinguished from brackets) are not the comments of the editor,
but are a part of the original text. The primary function of my bracketed
remarks is to clarify points which might otherwise mislead the reader as to the
facts. 
</P>
<P> Unfortunately, however, I have a certain weakness for sharing my opinions;
weeds will appear from time to time among the flowers of even the most lovingly
tended garden. The reader is asked to pass over these with a tolerant eye. 
</P>
<P> I thank MarK T. Ganzer for his early support of the project. 
</P>
<P> Special thanks go to John Carder Bush, whose great kindness and generosity
to me one autumn afternoon at East Wickham Farm helped provide the inspiration
for these books. Finally, I would like to thank Kate Bush for planting her rare
and wonderful flowers in my mind. 
</P>
<P> Now you are invited to open the gate... 
</P>
