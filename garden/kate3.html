<P>[Here are Kate's contributions to the third issue, called the &quot;tour
issue&quot; (November 1979).] 
</P>

<P>I hope it doesn't seem too strange having a special issue about the tour
four months after it's finished. I think it's nice to have a chance to remember
it all, especially as it's been uppermost in my mind recently, as I've been
doing the mixing for the EP, which is out now. I've been in the studios a lot
recently, recording new songs for the next album, and that has meant working
with a lot of the band again, and I was really happy to work with Gary and
Stewart [Gary Hurst and Stewart Avon-Arnold, two dancers who have worked with
Kate as dancing partners over the years] again when we did the video for Top of
the Pops [the video for the live EP version of Them Heavy People. ] I hope to be
able to tell you about the songs I've been writing and recording soon. Take
care. 
</P>
<P>Love,

<H3><A NAME="hh">Hammer Horror</A></H3>
<P>The song is not about, as many think, Hammer Horror films. It is about an
actor and his friend. His friend is playing the lead in a production of The
Hunchback of Notre Dame, a part he's been reading all his life, waiting for the
chance to play it. He's finally got the big break he's always wanted, and he is
the star. After many rehearsals he dies accidentally, and the friend is asked to
take the role over, which, because his own career is at stake, he does. The dead
man comes back to haunt him because he doesn't want him to have the part,
believing he's taken away the only chance he ever wanted in life. And the actor
is saying, &quot;Leave me alone, because it wasn't my fault--I have to take this
part, but I'm wondering if it's the right thing to do because the ghost is not
going to leave me alone and is really freaking me out. Every time I look round a
corner he's there, he never disappears.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The song was inspired by seeing James Cagney playing the part of Lon Chaney
playing the hunchback--he was an actor in an actor in an actor, rather like
Chinese boxes, and that's what I was trying to create. 
</P>
<P>Making the video of Hammer Horror was the first time I had worked with a
dancer. I wanted to do something different with it, using a dancer, and I was
sitting in a hotel room in Australia when it suddenly came to me--the whole
routine happened before my eyes--and the next morning at 9 a.m. the dancer
turned up to start work. We'd never met before, and in ten minutes we were
having to throw each other around. He was so inspiring that we did the video
that same afternoon. I did it again in New Zealand, when we arrived late, so I
went straight into the routine with a dancer I'd never met before who had learnt
it from the video. It was the strangest experience--I got to the chorus and
suddenly this total stranger appeared behind me doing the routine perfectly. I
just couldn't stop laughing, and we had to do about three takes. 
</P>
<P>In the show I wanted to use the same routine, but I couldn't possibly sing
it and dance at the same time, and I thought it was important not to mime it, as
I wanted it to be a dance number, totally dedicated to dance, so I could let rip
more. It was important that everyone should know that it wasn't a cheat, so I
decided to dance to a backing track, and it was the only number in the show that
wasn't live.

<H3><A NAME="int">Interview</A></H3>
<P>Who is John Carder Bush? Where were the photographs on the &quot;Moving&quot;
and &quot;Lakeside&quot; posters taken? 
</P>
<P>&quot;John is my brother, the eldest in the family. I have one other
brother, Paddy, and no sisters. John took the photographs used on the posters,
and they were taken in Holland.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why did you leave the echoing &quot;He's here!&quot;--on the single of The
Man With the Child in His Eyes-- off the album version? And was the mix of Wow
on Lionheart different from that of the single? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was the other way round with The Man With the Child in His Eyes: I
added &quot;He's here!&quot; to the single. Otherwise, the mix of all the
singles has been the same as on the albums.&quot; 
</P>
<P>What is the noise at the beginning and end of Moving? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The noise is whale song. Lots of members have written to ask what I
think about whale hunting. Well, I'm dead against it. It would be a terrible
tragedy if those beautiful and noble animals were wiped out by our greed.&quot; 
</P>
<P>In Them Heavy People you mention Gurdjieff. Do you follow his teachings? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I've read some of his work, and recently saw the film Meetings With
Remarkable Men, and had tea with Peter Brook, the director, afterwards. Pa and
my brother John are into him seriously, and I'm hoping to persuade John to write
an article about him for a future Newsletter.&quot; [John has so far not done
so.] 
</P>
<P>Is it true that you're going to make a film called The Gold Plated Dream
Machine with the motorcycle stunt rider Eddie Kidd? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, it isn't, and I've never even heard of it. You mustn't believe
everything (or anything?) you read in the papers. Quite a lot of articles
irritate me because of their inaccuracy. It would be so easy for a journalist to
send me the copy of what they've written so I could check up on the facts--not
of their opinion, which is their own business--but on the facts; and so far, not
one has done so. Nearly every interview is distorted in some way. That's one of
the reasons for starting this club, so that I can give you the genuine facts
that you want to know.&quot;
</P>
<P>Is it true that Saxophone Song was written about David Bowie, and do you
know him personally? 
</P>
<P>&quot;The song isn't about David Bowie. I wrote it about the instrument, not
the player, at a time when I really loved the sound of the saxophone--I still
do. No, I don't know him personally, though I went to his &quot;farewell to
Ziggy Stardust&quot; concert and cried, and so did he.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Why, Oh why didn't you turn up at the Cricket match at Paddington on
September 16th, as advertised, when so many of us came just to see you? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm really upset about this. I really wanted to go. It would have been
such fun. But it shouldn't have been advertised, and it was very naughty of
whoever did it, because it was never confirmed. Again, you mustn't believe all
you hear through the media. That was the day I was making the video for Them
Heavy People, from the On Stage EP, for Top of the Pops. I'm really sorry for
those who had a wasted journey.&quot;
