<P>[Here is Paddy's tenth article for the KBC Newsletter. It appeared in the
seventeenth issue (Christmas 1984).]

<P> The early morning fog of South London is thick and murky, the traffic sound
is gone, and in a tall, silly house somewhere not far comes the sound of
elephants practising the art of continuous drinking at the waterhole of life.
Surely not? On closer inspection one can decipher subtle differences between
three thirsty quadrupeds and a lone dijeridu player. We've already discussed the
merits of this instrument, such as the ability for the player to see wallabies
after several minutes' practice. But what about the consequences of being
involved with unusual-sounding instruments such as these? My neighbours have the
distressing habit of calling in 24-hour emergency plumbers, the wild animal
squad of the R.S.P.C.A., various exorcists, a killer-bee specialist, and one of
those guys with a machine to unblock the drains. Typical of London life, really.

</P>
<P> In contrast this summer found me in a secret lakeland hidden somewhere in
the British Isles, with hundreds of lakes for my elephants to drink. I sat and
played. A few thousand curlew flew over my head. Green pastures everywhere. A
couple of miles away a dog went Woof. I played while the fish came up and 'til
the bats came out. 
</P>
<P> You know, most of the recorded Australian Aboriginal music that I have come
across has been about animals. I wonder why? What does this instrument sound
like to you? Refresh your memory with a quick listen to The Dreaming. Your
comments are invited. If any of this interests you, then find a cardboard or
plastic tube about three-quarters of your own height in length. It should be
wide enough to put your lips inside. And do just that! Then blow a few
raspberries down the tube...behold thirsty elephants. If you like this, you
might decorate your instrument with such traditional motifs as snakes, lizards,
emu, bush onions, stingrays, etc. This is usually performed in great secrecy and
this rule in my opinion should not be broken, so no bush onion-painting in
public, please, it's only sensible. Once you have done all this you are well on
your way to becoming a true weirdo, and at long last I won't be alone. 
</P>
<P> This of course is not quite true, as this Christmas shall see me
bell-ringing at the Reverend Normal's [the pseudonym of another of the
Newsletter's column-writers] parish. This is always a great time for reunions.
Our weird and wonderful friends and colleagues flock from near and far to take
their places at their respective bell-ropes where we ring unorthodox changes.
This year my former teacher, Professor Fiddlegruber, will be leading the
ringing. All our bells have names, as do all the real bells of the world. They
are written in the bell metal when it is cast. Ours have names like &quot;Big
Dong&quot; and &quot;One More Time From The Top&quot;,o to name but two. Yes,
our pealing is highly renowned and this Christmas just wouldn't be right without
a selection of carols. Such favourites as The Holly and the Curlew and December
Will Be Magic are on the top of my list. I was playing through some of them
tonight when the confused Rentokill man arrived. 
</P>
<P> I wonder how our neighbours will take to a phase of ancient Roman music.
They used to have huge water-powered organs that could be heard for nine
miles--the Romans, that is, not my neighbours. The Emperor Nero was renowned for
his performances on the Hydraulis (that is what it was called), and everybody
thought he was terrific. Times have changed somewhat since then, and it is
advisable these days to inform the coastguard prior to any experiments in this
direction that you may feel inclined to follow up. Remember, it's no joke to
have the emergency services called out unnecessarily, no matter how romantic
your intonations may be. 
</P>
<P> We started building our Hydraulis in November. Some of the longer pipes are
being concealed within the chimneys, and others just look like regular household
plumbing. We're going to compress the air in the cellar, and force it up through
the pipes at a pressure of about 2 1/2 tons per square inch. It'll sound just
great, but it won't be ready 'til March--just in time for the Ides, in fact--and
then we'll be manning the pumps and asking for volunteer slaves. Something to
bear in mind, but I'm sure you'll be hearing from us before then. 
</P>
<P> I was looking at some photographs of magnified snowflakes. Very beautiful.
And they say each one's shape is unique. As the snowflake is formed, it
vibrates, and its minute, complex, starry shape is made as it freezes right in
the middle of its solo, making a sonic pattern like sand sprinkled on a cymbal.
So this winter if it snows on me I'll be thinking of all those crystals of
sound...frozen in water and heaped up on the ground. We hope by 1986 we will be
able to record the sound of the actual crystal freezing for you. A certain
professor is researching it right now, so that's something to look forward to.
Maybe LP number six? 
</P>
<P> Finally, some of my agents have reported that one or two of you haven't
made your bull roarers yet, and all I can say is you must be really weird.
You'll feel better afterwards, and then I'll stop going on at you...
