<P>Remembering the streets of a rush-hour London, with my carrier bags and
dancing clothes under my arm--Mad people, mad things and me, a hoping heart with
no idea what was going to happen just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>Then the adventure of the gigs in English pubs, scented of summer beer.
Wondering--dancing--sweating--and waiting, waiting, waiting. My obsessions, my
teachers, my aching bones, my comforts and frustrations. So much laughing and
crying but always music, music everywhere. 
</P>
<P>And now, crashing out in traffic jams all over the world, longing for home
but waking with that same strange feeling--whether from a plane, a bed or a
dream--&quot;How come...it's happening to me?&quot; And it's only just begun:
you're carrying me into a land of the stage, a place for swallows and trapped
mice. 
</P>
<P>Since the time I saw magic made by loving bodies that moved me beyond words,
I've craved my own troupe of gypsies, my own show, the chance to take a trip
with you. 
</P>
<P>And now it's here--the best and bad times rock'n'rolled into one. The fear
and sparkle in my stomach. 
</P>
<P>Sure, it's for me--but it's for you, too. So take it--take me away with
you... 
</P>
<P>Lots of love 
</P>
<P>Kate xxxx
