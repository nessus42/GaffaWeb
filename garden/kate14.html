</PRE>
<P>It's been a very long time since I spoke to you. It was last year--can time
really keep going faster? I would like to apologise for the long gap since the
last magazine and fill you in on what's been happening. It seems that every time
I do something, it takes me longer to do. This album has taken one year to
record and I have never done anything so involved before. After all this time, I
do feel happy with the results and I just hope that you will too. 
</P>
<P>I have had a lot of help with this album. I never could have done it alone,
and each person has contributed something very special. 
</P>
<P>We worked between several studios, getting time where we could at the
studios with the facilities we required, eventually settling in at Advision
Studios, where we finished all the overdubs and mixed the tracks. We also worked
at The Townhouse and The Odyssey, and at Abbey Road Studios, where all the
backing tracks were recorded. 
</P>
<P>I used several engineers, working with Hugh Padgham, Nick Launay, Haydn
Bendall and Paul Hardiman. All of them were very important and all played major
parts in how the album has ended up sounding. 
</P>
<P>Hugh worked on Sat In Your Lap, Get Out of My House, and Leave It Open. Hugh
was a lot of fun to work with and as the first engineer on the album, he started
it off in a very productive and positive way. I met Hugh when I had the pleasure
to sing some backing vocals for Peter Gabriel, and I was very impressed with the
sounds and the creative atmosphere. Hugh has worked with The Police, Genesis and
XTC, just to mention a few. 
</P>
<P>We felt very pleased with the backing tracks and were excited at the
results; however, Hugh was too busy to continue, and so I worked with Nick
Launay, who had been trained by Hugh. Nick worked on Houdini, All the Love,
There Goes a Tenner, The Dreaming and Suspended in Gaffa. The majority of the
backing tracks were recorded with Nick at The Townhouse. 
</P>
<P>We were working through the warm summer last year, and much dedication was
required from all to stay in the studio all day without succumbing to the sun. 
</P>
<P>Nick is a very young engineer and has already worked with Public Image, Phil
Collins and John Martyn. Again there was a great working relationship and we
were all sad that Nick was too busy to continue and that the time at The
Townhouse had run out. 
</P>
<P>I moved on to Abbey Road, working with Haydn Bendall. I met him on the last
album when I was working with Jon Kelly. Haydn was co-producing Sky and I found
him a very patient and understanding engineer. Haydn also engineered Roy
Harper's last album and among many other artists, helps up and coming writers to
get their ideas securely on to tape, often securing record contracts at the same
time. Haydn worked on Night of the Swallow and Pull Out the Pin. Our assistant
engineer Danny Dawson, affectionately known as Dan-Dan, became part of the
working team on the two tracks, and it was really enjoyable. It always is fun
when you work with nice people. 
</P>
<P>The two tracks are finished and Haydn's time runs out too, so...I find Paul
Hardiman, with a lot of help from Hugh Padgham. 
</P>
<P>Paul has worked with a great variety of acts, from Slade to Keith Emerson
and Soft Cell. We worked at Odyssey Studios up until Christmas [1981], and by
then Paul and I had a great working relationship. I felt I could communicate
with him very easily and he could get the sounds I needed to hear, very quickly.
We ran out of time at Odyssey and Paul suggested Advision, studios he knew from
experience. He took me around there one afternoon on a Sunday. The studio was
deserted and we went down to a small control room that proved to have a
brilliant sound. We were sitting listening to tapes at full blast and I was
falling in love with the room when the door slowly opened and a rather anxious
looking studio manager edged around the door. He saw Paul and sighed with
relief, and explained how he'd expected a gang of thugs to be tearing up the
studio while listening to tapes of their choice-- as far as he had known, the
studio was empty. We asked him if there would be any time for us to use the
studio, and the three weeks we booked were to turn into more like three months.
Paul and I were very excited about settling in to one studio, and Paul had some
wonderful effects for sounds that he'd put away for a rainy day. I'm pleased
there was a lot of rain to come. 
</P>
<P>Although all the engineers were invaluable, Paul was of special value. He
became a constant companion during the album and I would often ask he advice,
knowing I would get an honest answer. He is also a very funny man, so he kept us
all laughing-- donning silly hats and pulling funny faces. 
</P>
<P>At Advision we met Dave Taylor--he was the assistant engineer, and he worked
with us for months until the album was finished and mixed. Dave was also the
maintenance engineer, and on quite a few nights, when we went home to bed, he
would be up all night twiddling inside machines or trying to figure out why the
digital machines weren't working. Every night we ate take-away food, watched the
evening news and returned to the dingy little treasure trove to dig for jewels.

</P>
<P>Now it's all finished, I think of the beginning. Twenty demos, ten of which
became the album. In these demos all the moods and sounds were captured, and all
the way through the album these demos were referred to. Often the session would
stop, we'd dig out the 1/4 inch tape of the track we were working on, and with
the original flavour and sounds strong in our heads, the session would begin
again. In many ways it would have been interesting to have used the demos as
masters, they were so spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>Del Palmer engineered all the demos and every night he would sit up in the
cramped little control room, getting different sounds for each track. He sat
through hours of harmonies and takes of lead vocals, replying &quot;I'm not
bored&quot; as many times as there were cups of tea, and nodding &quot;Yeah,
Kate, I think it sounds great!&quot;, a phrase to be echoed by Hugh, Haydn,
Paul--Bless you all. 
</P>

<P>Perhaps I could now walk you through the album, track by track, starting
with:

</P>
<P>I already had the piano patterns, but they didn't turn into a song until the
night after I'd been to see a Stevie Wonder gig. Inspired by the feeling of his
music, I set a rhythm on the Roland and worked in the piano riff to the high-hat
and snare. I now had a verse and a tune to go over it but only a few lyrics like

</P>
<P>&quot;I see the people working,&quot;<BR> &quot;I want to be a lawyer,&quot;
and<BR> &quot;I want to be a scholar,&quot; 
</P>
<P>so the rest of the lyrics became &quot;na-na-na&quot; or words that happened
to come into my head. I had some chords for the chorus with the idea of a vocal
being ad-libbed later. The rhythm box and piano were put down, and then we
recorded the backing vocals &quot;Some say that knowledge is...&quot; Next we
put down the lead vocal in the verses and spent a few minutes getting some lines
worked out before recording the chorus voice. I saw this vocal being sung from
high on a hill on a windy day. The fool on the hill, the king of the castle... &quot;I
must admit, just when I think I'm king.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The idea of the demos was to try and put everything down as quickly as
possible. Next came the brass. The CS80 is still my favourite synthesizer next
to the Fairlight, and as it was all that was available at the time, I started to
find a brass sound. In minutes I found a brass section starting to happen, and I
worked out an arrangement. We put the brass down and we were ready to mix the
demo. 
</P>
<P>I was never to get that CS80 brass to sound the same again--it's always the
way. At The Townhouse the same approach was taken to record the master of the
track. We put down a track of the rhythm box to be replaced by drums, recording
the piano at the same time. 
</P>
<P>As I was producing, I would ask the engineer to put the piano sound on tape
so I could refer to that for required changes. 
</P>
<P>This was the quickest of all the tracks to be completed, and was also one of
the few songs to remain contained on one twenty-four track tape instead of two!

<P>&quot;Everybody synchronize watches. Remember there's only half an hour to
do the job. We've been rehearsing for weeks, so nothing should go wrong. Let's
run through it one more time:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;I go in and distract the guard,
<BR>Frank's out the back in the getaway car,
<BR>The sign on the door turns from open to shut,
<BR>We keep them all covered, you blow the safe up,
<BR>We grab the cash, make a hasty retreat,
<BR>And tear across London using the backstreets.

</P>
<P>We sat in front of the speakers trying to focus on the picture-- a green
forest, humid and pulsating with life. We are looking at the Americans from the
Vietnamese point of view and, almost like a camera, we start in wide shot. Right
in the distance you can see the trees moving, smoke and sounds drifting our
way...sounds like a radio. Closer in with the camera, and you can catch glimpses
of their pink skin. We can smell them for miles with their sickly cologne,
American tobacco and stale sweat. 
</P>
<P>Take the camera in even closer, and we find a solitary soldier, perhaps the
one I have singled out. (Sometimes a Vietnamese would track a soldier for days
and follow him, until he eventually took him.) This soldier is under a tree,
dozing with a faint smile and a radio by his side. It's a small transistor radio
out of which cries an electric guitar. I'd swear it was being played by Brian
Bath, but how could that be, way out here on our stereo screen. 
</P>
<P>I pop the silver Buddha that I wear around my neck into my mouth, securing
my lips around his little metal body. I move towards the sleeping man. A
helicopter soars overhead, he wakes up, and as he looks me in the eyes I relate
to him as I would to a helpless stranger. Has he a family and a lady waiting for
him at home, somewhere beyond the Chinese drums and the double bass that stalks
like a wild cat through bamboo? 
</P>
<P>The moving pictures freeze-frame and fade--someone stopped the multi-track,
there's more overdubs to do.

<P>Whenever I've sung this song I've hoped that my breath would hold out for
the first few phrases, as there is no gap to breathe in. 
</P>
<P>When I wrote this track the words came at the same time, and this is one of
the few songs where the lyrics were complete at such an early stage. The idea of
the song is that of being given a glimpse of &quot;God&quot;--something that we
dearly want--but being told that unless we work for it, we will never see it
again, and even then, we might not be worthy of it. Of course, everybody wants
the reward without the toil, so people try to find a way out of the hard work,
still hoping to claim the prize, but such is not the case. The choruses are
meant to express the feeling of entering timelessness as you become ready for
the experience, but only when you are ready. 
</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P><CITE><A NAME="leave">Leave It Open </A></CITE> 
</P>
<P>Like cups, we are filled up and emptied with feelings, emotions-- vessels
breathing in, breathing out. This song is about being open and shut to stimuli
at the right times. Often we have closed minds and open mouths when perhaps we
should have open minds and shut mouths. 
</P>
<P>This was the first demo to be recorded, and we used a Revox and the few
effects such as a guitar chorus pedal and an analogue delay system. We tried to
give the track an Eastern flavour and the finished demo certainly had a
distinctive mood. 
</P>
<P>There are lots of different vocal parts, each portraying a separate
character and therefore each demanding an individual sound. When a lot of vocals
are being used in contrast rather than &quot;as one,&quot; more emphasis has to
go on distinguishing between the different voices, especially if the vocals are
coming from one person. 
</P>
<P>To help the separation we used the effects we had. When we mastered the
track, a lot more electronic effects and different kinds of echoes were used,
helping to place the vocals and give a greater sense of perspective. 
</P>
<P>Every person who came into the studio was given the &quot;end backing vocals
test&quot; to guess what is being sung at the end of the song. 
</P>
<P>&quot;How many words is it?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Five.&quot; 
</P>
<P>&quot;Does it begin with a 'W'?&quot; 
</P>
<P>It is very difficult to guess, but it can be done, especially when you know
what the song is about. 
</P>
<P>I would love to know your answers.

<P><CITE><A NAME="dreaming">The Dreaming</A></CITE> 
</P>
<P>We started with the drums, working to a basic Linn drum machine pattern,
making them sound as tribal and deep as possible. This song had to try and
convey the wide open bush, the Aborigines--it had to roll around in mud and
dirt, try to become a part of the earth. &quot;Earthy&quot; was the word used
most to explain the sounds. There was a flood of imagery sitting waiting to be
painted into the song. The Aborigines move away as the digging machines move in,
mining for ore and plutonium. Their sacred grounds are destroyed and their
beliefs in Dreamtime grow blurred through the influence of civilization and
alcohol. Beautiful people from a most ancient race are found lying in the roads
and gutters. Thank God the young Australians can see what's happening. 
</P>
<P>The piano plays sparse chords, just to mark every few bars and the chord
changes. With the help of one of Nick Launay's magic sounds, the piano became
wide and deep, effected to the point of becoming voices in a choir. The wide
open space is painted on the tape, and it's time to paint the sound that
connects the humans to the earth, the dijeridu. 
</P>
<P>The dijeridu took the place of the bass guitar and formed a constant drone,
a hypnotic sound that seems to travel in circles. 
</P>
<P>None of us had met Rolf (Harris) before and we were very excited at the idea
of working with him. He arrived with his daughter, a friend and an armful of
dijeridus. He is a very warm man, full of smiles and interesting stories. I
explained the subject matter of the song and we sat down and listened to the
basic track a couple of times to get the feel. He picked up a dijeridu, placing
one end of it right next to my ear and the other at his lips, and began to play.

</P>
<P>I've never experienced a sound quite like it before. It was like a swarm of
tiny velvet bees circling down the shaft of the dijeridu and dancing around in
my ear. It made me laugh, but there was something very strange about it,
something of an age a long, long time ago. 
</P>
<P>Women are never supposed to play a dijeridu, according to Aboriginal laws;
in fact there is a dijeridu used for special ceremonies, and if this was ever
looked upon by a woman before the ceremony could take place, she was taken away
and killed, so it's not surprising that the laws were rarely disobeyed. After
the ceremony, the instrument became worthless, its purpose over. 
</P>
<P>It's interesting how some songs attract lots of ideas--this was definitely
one of them, and because of the amount of ideas in this song, it made me
concentrate on others, so they would not be neglected or left behind. Percy
Edwards was among the ideas for this song, and he too was a real pleasure to
work with. He really is the only man who imitates the voices of animals to the
extent that he does, and is greatly respected for his talents. It is so
beautiful to watch him burst into birdsong in a studio in the middle of London.
I had images of him waking with the dawn chorus, taking part with blackbirds,
the sparrows, the thrushes... but we were in the studio with Percy, and there
was work to do, so he became sheep, dingoes and Australian magpies. The light
grew dim and we were out in the bush on a warm windy night by the light of
Percy, our fire. 
</P>
<P>Percy is a true professional, and he kept us all in awe with his wonderful
ways. He was, however, a little upset by the treatment of the kangaroos, but
after Paddy and I explained it was the only way to get the sound we wanted, he
completely understood the situation and tried to communicate to the kangas what
they had to do. The only problem was he couldn't remember the kanga word for &quot;Dang&quot;
so he worked on &quot;Boing&quot; with a &quot;D&quot;.

<CITE><A NAME="nots">Night of the Swallow</A></CITE> 
<!-- ha! private joke, sorry  VM--> 
</P>
<P>Ever since I heard my first Irish pipe music it has been under my skin, and
every time I hear the pipes, it's like someone tossing a stone in my emotional
well, sending ripples down my spine. 
</P>
<P>I've wanted to work with Irish music for years, but my writing has never
really given me the opportunity of doing so until now. As soon as the song was
written, I felt that a ceilidh band would be perfect for the choruses. The
verses are about a lady who's trying to keep her man from accepting what seems
to be an illegal job. He is a pilot and has been hired to fly some people into
another country. No questions are to be asked, and she gets a bad feeling from
the situation. But for him, the challenge is almost more exciting than the job
itself, and he wants to fly away. 
</P>
<P>As the fiddles, pipes and whistles start up in the choruses, he is
explaining how it will be all right. He'll hide the plane high up in the clouds
on a night with no moon, and he'll swoop over the water like a swallow. 
</P>
<P>Bill Whelan is the keyboard player with Planxty, and ever since Jay [Kate's
eldest brother John Carder Bush] played me an album of theirs I have been a fan.
I rang Bill and he tuned into the idea of the arrangement straight away. 
</P>
<P>We sent him a cassette, and a few days later he phoned the studio and said, &quot;Would
you like to hear the arrangement I've written?&quot; 
</P>
<P>I said I'd love to, but how? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Liam is with me now, and we could play it over the phone.&quot; 
</P>
<P>I thought how wonderful he was, and I heard him put down the phone and walk
away. The cassette player started up. As the chorus began, so did this beautiful
music--through the wonder of telephones it was coming live from Ireland, and it
was very moving. 
</P>
<P>We arranged that I would travel to Ireland with Jay and the multi-track
tape, and that we would record in Windmill Lane Studios, Dublin. As the choruses
began to grow, the evening drew on and the glasses of Guiness, slowly dropping
in level, became like sand glasses to tell the passing of time. We missed our
plane and worked through the night. 
</P>
<P>By eight o'clock the next morning we were driving to the airport to return
to London. I had a very precious tape tucked under my arm, and just as we were
stepping onto the plane, I looked up into the sky and there were three swallows
diving and chasing the flies.

<P><CITE><A NAME="love">All the Love </A></CITE> 
</P>
<P>Although we are often surrounded by people and friends, we are all
ultimately alone, and I feel sure everyone feels lonely at some time in their
life. I wanted to write about feeling alone, and how having to hide emotions
away or being too scared to show love can lead to being lonely as well. 
</P>
<P>There are just some times when you can't cope and you just don't feel you
can talk to anyone. I go and find a bathroom, a toilet or an empty room just to
sit and let it out and try to put it all together in my mind. Then I go back and
face it all again. 
</P>
<P>I think it's sad how we forget to tell people we love that we do love them.
Often we think about these things when it's too late or when an extreme
situation forces us to show those little things we're normally too shy or too
lazy to reveal. 
</P>
<P>One of the ideas for the song sparked when I came home from the studio late
one night. I was using an answering machine to take the day's messages and it
had been going wrong a lot, gradually growing worse with time. It would speed
peoples' voices up beyond recognition, and I just used to hope they would ring
back again one day at normal speed. 
</P>
<P>This particular night, I started to play back the tape, and the machine had
neatly edited half a dozen messages together to leave &quot;Goodbye&quot;, &quot;See
you!&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;See you soon&quot;... It was a strange
thing to sit and listen to your friends ringing up apparently just to say
goodbye. I had several cassettes of peoples' messages all ending with authentic
farewells, and by copying them onto 1/4&quot; tape and re-arranging the order,
we managed to synchronize the &quot;callers&quot; with the last verse of the
song. 
</P>
<P>There are still quite a few of my friends who have not heard the album or
who have not recognised themselves and are still wondering how they managed to
appear in the album credits when they didn't even set foot into the studio.

<P><CITE><A NAME="houdini">Houdini</A></CITE> 
</P>
<P>The side most people know of Houdini is that of the escapologist, but he
spent many years of his life exposing mediums and seances as frauds. His mother
had died, and in trying to make contact through such spiritual people, he
realized how much pain was being inflicted on people already in sorrow, people
who would part with money just for the chance of a few words from a past loved
one. 
</P>
<P>I feel he must have believed in the possibility of contact after death, and
perhaps in his own way, by weeding out the frauds, he hoped to find just one
that could not be proven to be a fake. He and his wife made a decision that if
one of them should die and try to make contact, the other would know it was
truly them through a code that only the two of them knew. 
</P>
<P>His wife would often help him with his escapes. Before he was bound up and
sealed away inside a tank or some dark box, she would give him a parting kiss,
and as their lips met, she would pass him the key which he would later use to
unlock the padlocks that chained him. 
</P>
<P>After he died, Mrs. Houdini did visit many mediums, and tried to make
contact for years, with no luck--until one day a medium called Mr. Ford informed
her that Houdini had come through. She visited him and he told her that he had a
message for her from Houdini, and he spoke the only words that meant for her the
proof of her husband's presence. She was so convinced that she released an
official statement to the fact that he had made contact with her through the
medium, Ford. 
</P>
<P>It is such a beautiful and strange story that I thought I had very little to
do, other than tell it like it was. But in fact it proved to be the most
difficult lyric of all the songs and the most emotionally demanding. I was so
aware of trying to do justice to the beauty of the subject, and trying to
understand what it must have been like to have been in love with such an
extraordinary man, and to have been loved by him. 
</P>
<P>I worked for two or three nights just to find one line that was right. There
were so many alternatives, but only a few were right for the song. Gradually it
grew and began to piece together, and I found myself wrapped up in the feelings
of the song--almost pining for Houdini. Singing the lead vocal was a matter of
conjuring up that feeling again and as the clock whirrs and the song flashes
back in time to when she watched him through the glass, he's on the other side
under water, and she hangs on to his every breath. We both wait.

</P>
<P>The Shining is the only book I've read that has frightened me. While reading
it I swamped around in its snowy imagery and avoided visiting certain floors of
the big, cold hotel, empty for the winter. As in Alien, the central characters
are isolated, miles (or light years) away from anyone or anything, but there is
something in the place with them. They're not sure what, but it isn't very nice.

</P>
<P>The setting for this song continues the theme--the house which is really a
human being, has been shut up--locked and bolted, to stop any outside forces
from entering. The person has been hurt and has decided to keep everybody out.
They plant a &quot;concierge&quot; at the front door to stop any determined
callers from passing, but the thing has got into the house upstairs. It's
descending in the lift, and now it approaches the door of the room that you're
hiding in. You're cornered, there's no way out, so you turn into a bird and fly
away, but the thing changes shape, too. You change, it changes; you can't
escape, so you turn around and face it, scare it away.
