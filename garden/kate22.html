<P>[Here is an interview with Kate, which seems to have been conducted by Kate,
as well, under the fictitious name &quot;Auntie Hetty&quot;. It appeared in the
twentieth issue of the Newsletter. ]

<H3>An Interview With Auntie Hetty</H3>
<P>Let me introduce myself. I'm Kate's Auntie Hetty, and I've been waiting to
do this interview for years, but she's such a busy dear, and I like to keep
myself active with my amateur dramatics. Such a lovely group of boys and
girls--so enthusiastic-- keeps them away from nasty things like sniffing glue
and listening to Sigue-Sigue Sputnik. I'm terribly into Method acting and have
just had a nice long sleep. I was playing a woman alcoholic who'd been up for
three days and three nights, so I stayed up for three days and three nights and
drank both bottles of sherry (from that lovely boy who played Bottom three years
ago in Little Hampton). It's so much more fun than acting. But I feel most
refreshed now, and as I enter Katie's front gate I notice the garden's a little
untidy-- I really must tell her about old Mr. Squashy, and I've some lovely
hollyhocks she could put by the door. 
</P>
<P>So, with a nice cup of tea, I refer to my notes, take up the old crochet
hook and begin: 
</P>
<P>Now Katie, dear, we're all so pleased about this album doing so well and we
heard a lot about a film called The Ninth Wave. Will that be your next project?

</P>
<P>&quot;The film was something I very much wanted to try. The b-side of the
album was originally written with visual ideas in mind, and I am intrigued by
the combination of pictures and sound on film. I went as far as approaching a
couple of people about the idea, but I found the success of the album and the
rate of single releases extremely demanding, especially as each single required
a video, 12&quot;, single artwork...It soon built up, and there was no time to
even think about this film. The promotion for this album almost lasted a year.
By the time I'd taken a break, the gap between albums was already becoming too
big to consider fitting in another project. I've now had a holiday and some time
to do nothing, and am in the process of thinking out some ideas to take into the
studio.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh, I see, dear. Well, you must have been very busy. Did you have a lovely
holiday? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it was...lovely.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now, you have a video E.P. out called The Hair of the Hound, and it's been
at number one in the charts, which is very nice, lovely. They must have taken a
lot of time to do. You see, I understand these things--Amateur dramatics is the
same thing, you know: rehearse, rehearse, struggle, toil, iron your costume
every night... 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really wanted to try and make videos that looked like short films
this time. I think I've always wanted to do this, but apart from one or two of
the previous videos I have not achieved it. I started approaching film
directors. I believed that video and film were two very different worlds, and
that people who made videos would be less likely to make a pop &quot;video&quot;
look like a piece of 35mm film. 
</P>
<P>&quot;All the people I approached were very kind but very busy, and I began
to realise that unless I was extremely lucky, no one that I wanted would be able
to shoot the promo. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I am a big admirer of Terry Gilliam's work--he is a great director. I
asked his advice; could he suggest people I could work with who were good. He
recommended David Garfarth, who had worked as a cameraman for him. The lighting
cameraman was Phil Mayheux-- who, interestingly, worked on the Max Headroom
special, which was superbly lit--&quot; 
</P>
<P>Max who?
</P>
<P>&quot;The video [ Running Up That Hill ] took eight weeks: six weeks'
training and choreography working with Dyane Gray, and three days shoot, plus
editing and various meetings. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Cloudbusting took eight to ten weeks, working with Julian Doyle, who
has worked many times with Terry Gilliam. He is multi-talented, and covered many
areas of the shoot, with Brian Helighy lighting for the first time--it's hard to
believe that it is his first time at lighting.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Yes it is so atmospheric, I love the story. But I'm very upset that you
didn't bring that lovely Donald Sutherland to see me. You know your Uncle Bertie
used to get quite jealous...eh, hmm, yes. Now I noticed you didn't move your
lips to the music in three of the videos--or should I call them films? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, they were all shot on film, but all eventually were edited on
video. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Apart from Running Up That Hill, which was edited totally in the video
suite, the others were edited on film as much as possible: doing all the
cuts--except the ones that need special effects: slowing down, speeding up. All
this is much quicker (and sometimes cheaper) to do on video, and with promo
deadlines video is so convenient. But it does change the quality of the pictures
when the film is transferred to video: it somehow loses its depth. But I'm sure
in a couple of years the quality will be brilliant. Video is advancing all the
time, but for me you can't beat the original quality of film, it's a very
ancient form. The advantage of video is being set loose on all the effects,
although on the E.P. all except Big Sky have been approached from a purist
film-maker's point of view: very few special effects. We deliberately encouraged
this, again trying to emphasise the film aspect. Which has a lot to do with no
lip-synch: as soon as a performer is 'singing', they become that performer doing
other things while singing. Which is great live, but on film, people acting out
events without the lip distractions have more chance of playing a character. I
found it very interesting and much more enjoyable. I'm always concerned about
the miming being as accurate as possible, and that takes a lot of concentration
and makes me behave like a singer. So without the lip-synch I could put much
more effort into a character. I felt a little nervous about it in Cloudbusting.
In Running Up That Hill it was different: no lip-synch, but I was trying to act
a dancer, and they are facial expressions I know the sensations of. But playing
a little boy, and playing opposite Donald Sutherland, I began to wonder if I was
going mad, voluntarily putting myself in these situations where I had a ninety
percent chance of looking a total absolute idiot! But if anything, Donald made
it seem extremely natural, he was just like my Dad. He could make it rain, and I
would watch him being taken away. I must say it was an extremely moving
experience, burnt strongly into my memory upon the hill with the machine and the
wind...&quot; 
</P>
<P>I had a similar experience with Sir Cecil Dill in the last performance of
Ooh, Was It Really? at Dulwich. He was playing Mortimer West, and as he rushed
on the stage with his epee in his back and said, &quot;Good God! It was him all
along!&quot; I knew I would never forget that moment, and with tears in my eyes
I said, &quot;Ooh, was it really?&quot; and down came the curtain to the roar of
applause, with that smell of old velvet--Still brings a tear to my eye. 
</P>
<P>Now, where was I? Oh, my dear, you've made more tea. I didn't see you go! 
</P>
<P>  I notice that you directed two of the videos. Did you enjoy doing that? 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was very interesting and extremely educational. I've had a lot of
encouragement from people to get more involved, and it can be difficult
sometimes to find directors who are enthusiastic about the amount of involvement
I like to put in. I found it took all my time rather than most, and the actual
shoots felt very relaxed. Cupcake, Aunt Hetty?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Ooh, don't mind if I do, dear. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I am extremely lucky to have worked with such a good film crew: Mike
Roberts was the cameraman. He's worked on The Killing Fields and The Mission,
and Billy Camp was assistant, who organised everyone and everything so
efficiently on the days of the shoot that I could almost relax. I used two
different lighting men: Hughie Johnson; and Roger Pratt, who again worked with
Terry Gilliam. The crew were so receptive, and made a very daunting, expensive
task a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>&quot;It is very like making early albums: I feel a bit disappointed with
the results, not having enough rehearsal, a big enough budget, etc., etc., but
the shoots were so much fun. It's such a good feeling to work with a big group
of people. I seem to like working with such a crowds. On both Hounds of Love and
The Big Sky shoots there was a relaxed air--both shoots involved crowd scenes,
and The Big Sky was especially satisfying. Besides a large number of performers
to fill a stage and give the effect of a live concert, we needed an avenue of
people, from the Wright brothers to two astronauts, to simulate aviation
history. The Wright brothers looked remarkably like Dave Cross and Peter
FitzGerald-Morris, and one of the astronauts looked so like Jay...We also needed
a large, enthusiastic crowd, so we asked  Dave Cross to organise some members of
the Club, and two hundred beautifully behaved people arrived on the day of the
shoot. It was very moving, they filled us all up with energy-- It made it feel
like a real concert. 
</P>
<P>&quot;All the film crew remarked on how incredible everyone was. They had
been terrified with past experiences of invited audiences, but I told them they
hadn't met the right ones. Everyone left just as beautifully--nearly everyone
with a burnt thumb from being a star in the sky holding up lighters and waving.
I'd never been in the same room with so many stars before.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh, the little angels, how lovely! Did it take long to edit those clips? 
</P>
<P>&quot;No, I worked with John Mister as film editor. On both those shoots we
worked to very detailed storyboards, and in both cases could give John a
photostat of the script beforehand so he'd know the gist of what we were working
on. Then he'd do a rough cut by himself, following the storyboard. Then we'd
work together until we were happy. He was great to work with, and both edits
were very quick: just taking them into the video suite for bits and pieces. But
it would have to be transferred to video for T.V. showings, anyway, so all ads
[sic--Does she mean 'adds' here, as inq. 'additions'?], etc., end up on video. 
</P>
<P>The Big Sky was a little more complicated. The beginning part on the
rooftops involves chromakey, where all the live action goes on in front of a
blue screen and then the various weather effects were put in at the edit. The
pieces of film with the weather were chosen beforehand and transferred to video;
they then replaced the blue screen.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That sounds awfully complicated, dear. We just roll our scenery up and down
from the wings, it's so much easier. 
</P>
<P>Now you must tell me about all these darling people you've been working
with. What was it like working with that lovely Peter Gabriel again? 
</P>
<P>&quot;I was so excited that he asked me to sing on that track-- It's such a
lovely, haunting song, and I love his work. But I do get nervous, especially
when it's something I really like. His music is very strong, and he is a great
person--I love working with him.&quot; 
</P>
<P>And those dear Big Country boys... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I like the Celtic influences in their music. They were lovely to
work with--I really enjoyed it. They asked if I'd like to do some backing
vocals, and I went in for an evening. They were really nice. It was fun. I like
working with different people. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I really enjoyed doing the Comic Relief concerts.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Oh, but my dear, the language was appalling. I'm afraid I had to write to
Points of View. I was more than a little shocked that you and Cliff Richard of
all people... 
</P>
<P>&quot;It was fantastic. I'm a big fan of so many of those comedians--they
are so talented. For me, alternative comedy is the most exciting thing coming
out of this country at the moment, and to be involved in something with them all
was really fulfilling. I felt nervous there, too, it's been a long time since
I've performed live to an audience, but they were so warm. Unfortunately the
piano pedal jammed on the first night in Breathing and I sang to the most
horrific combination of chords you can imagine, so the second and third nights
were relatively relaxed after that! 
</P>
<P>&quot;Singing with Rowan was hilarious. He's one of those people who can
make his face and body language make you laugh without him having to speak.
Again, I was so pleased that they asked me to take part. I wouldn't have missed
it for the world. I just wish I'd been brave enough to ask most of them for
their autographs-- 'Er, Ben, would you? I say, Rick, I've got this nephew...Just
sign it, don't bother signing it to him...' You know, you're meant to act
nonchalant, but I found myself starstruck.&quot; 
</P>
<P>  I did see gorgeous Ronnie Corbett and the Monty Python chappies-- Wasn't
Terry Gilliam there? 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, he was...Just so much talent. British comedy is unique and the
best.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Here, here, Gr-r-reat Britain... 
</P>
<P>I hear you sang Brazil on the soundtrack to Terry Gilliam's film. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, what a beautiful song--and I always thought it was a really bad
cabaret number, but actually it is very sad and nostalgic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Of course it is, you silly girl--One of the best tunes
ever...Br-a-a-zil-l-l-l... 
</P>
<P>&quot;Michael Kamen did the orchestral arrangements. He worked on The Ninth
Wave: Watching You Without Me and Hello Earth. He is very clever. He did the
music for the film, and was putting the soundtrack album together with Terry,
and they played me this beautiful arrangement without a voice. I'm not sure if
this piece was in the film or not, but I don't sing in the film at all. It has
such a 30s/40s feel, and Michael asked if I would sing over it--My immediate
reactions were fear and 'Yes'.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Now, just before we have another cup of tea, I want to ask you if you're
going to work with any more famous actors, because if you worked with that
lovely Peter O'Toole you could tell him to pop in and see me and have a nice cup
of tea, and we could act out one or two scenes from Romeo and Juliet...
