<H3>Some of the Photographs</H3>
<H3>Hounds of Love</H3>
<P>I thought that photographing Mr. and Mrs. Houdini on the banks of the Hudson
River in a freezing wind had been a difficult assignment: the shot had required
a long, long exposure and the wind was from the wrong direction, and when it was
right, it kept shaking the tripod. However, the sedate, elegant brief for the
cover of KBV had an element to it that all photographers are told to avoid
working with at all cost: animals. Luckily, the dogs we wanted to use are
friends of ours, so there was a good chance that they might put up with posing,
keeping quiet and leaving each other alone. But only a chance... 
</P>
<P> There had been quite a few ideas for this cover that we tried out in rough,
and then abandoned. The feel of the photo was in the air around the music that
was being finalised: colour and emotional pace became clear first. 
</P>
<P> Elaborate environments, such as forests, mountains, palaces, etc.--places
for the Hounds to run that would suit their style--were rejected as too busy.
The cover had to have a strong, full image of Kate, as it was the first for
three years, and landscapes, however beautiful, tend to dwarf people. It's fine
to use the big outdoors for bands because you can spread them all over it, but
for a beautiful solo lady it doesn't work. So we decided on a close-up of Kate
and the dogs, and a made-up background. 
</P>
<P> There was a feeling for daylight rather than studio, so we went round and
discussed it with the dogs. While Kate was chatting to them in their back
garden, I snapped away. But when we looked at the processed results, daylight
was too cold, there wasn't enough diffusion of the shades of colour and the
environment. It just didn't feel right. I had been working on a series of &quot;body
poems&quot; in which I was writing my poems on people and then photographing
them, and it seemed like a good idea, but when we tried it, apart from Kate
looking like the tattooed lady from a circus, there was much too much activity
in the small frame, and the eye just wandered around too much. But the dogs were
wonderul, and did everything they were asked to. 
</P>
<P> It was becoming clearer. We had to do it in the studio, without the
writing, and with the lights set in a delicate, pastel way. So I constructed a
rough, made sure all the cables were well pinned down and anything likely to be
knocked over out of the way, and then phoned up the dogs and asked them over for
another tryout. 
</P>
<P> We let them explore for an hour or so, and then Kate settled down on the
floor for an overhead shot. 
</P>
<P> An hour later we had managed to persuade them to lie down next to Kate. Not
surprising that they took so long, as they are not trained dogs, and couldn't
understand what all the fuss was about. I had a minute to hoover up as much as I
could before they were off again, tending to use Kate as a launching ramp for
their leaps and cavorting. 
</P>
<P> After they had left, we seriously considered trying feline friends, but
Cats of Love wasn't quite the same at all. But on looking at the shots we had,
there was potential, and we decided we would persevere. And the best thing
seemed to be to take the studio to the dogs, have another rehearsal and, if that
was a shambles, think again. Also another rehearsal would mean I could try out
more variations in the lighting and the set. So a week later I took my studio to
the dogs and constructed a scaffolding for the overhead shot; a bed of lilac net
and silks for Kate; and around her, a tent of lilac material to reflect and
diffuse. And when I looked through the lens at the little room, it looked like
an illustration from Dulac's Arabian Nights. 
</P>
<P> The Hounds had been taken out for a long run and then fed, because we
thought that if they felt dozy long enough they would want somewhere to lie down
and sleep it off. Kate did her hair in an approximation of how it would look in
the final shot, and then settled down in the tent. Up came the lights, and in
came the dogs--noses first--and after a few minutes of looking around, yawned
and went to sleep next to her. I had all the time I wanted to explore the
possibilities. 
</P>
<P> When the film was processed, it was very exciting to see how the various
elements were coming together, and how close we were getting to the album cover
that existed inside our heads. There were a lot of small points to iron out, but
they presented no problem, and I looked forward to the big day. 
</P>
<P> When it came round, Kate asked Clayton Howard, the make-up artist, and
Anthony Yacomine, the hair artist, to do their magic, so for three hours of
painstaking work they added the colours and shapes that were necessary for the
right atmosphere. I reconstructed the scaffolding and rebuilt the set, and after
lunch we were ready to go. Kate lay down in the tent, and Howard and Anthony
arranged the final touches of nuance. The materials were placed in just the
right places, and I climbed up into the scaffolding. When I looked through the
lens, it was fairyland underneath me. 
</P>
<P> The dogs, meanwhile, had been waiting in the wings, supposedly exhausted
and dying for somewhere to put their heads down. Anthony and Clayton withdrew in
a cloud of hairspray and eye-glitter, so that the dogs woulddn't be distracted
by strangers, and the word was given to let them in. 
</P>
<P> Within seconds, Kate's delicate arrangements were in tatters and a paw in
the mouth didn't help make-up. One dog would settle down and start snoring while
the other one turned her back on us all by the door and wouldn't budge. As soon
as she had been persuaded to stop being a prima donna and come alongside Kate,
the other one smelled Anthony and Clayton, and was off to meet them. We tried
for half an hour before we realised we were wasting our time, so while Kate was
being repaired, I went outside with the Hounds and had a serious talk with them.

</P>
<P> I could see their point of view, but it didn't help in getting this
expensive, time-consuming session off the ground. While they hurtled off to
chase non-existent cats that I suggested were lurking at the end of the garden
in the hope of tiring them out even more, I received the signal that Kate was
ready to go again. Apparently seeing reason, the dogs returned, and we signed
the deal with some chocolate digestives: if they behaved themselves and gave me
the photo I wanted, there was a McDonald's with milk shake and apple pie in it
for each of them. 
</P>
<P> We went back in, but it was the same thing. Looning and sulking. Then
suddenly they lay down next to Kate, and we were away. Half an hour later I had
enough photos, and could have gone on to take more, but everyone was becoming
too sleepy in the heat from the lights and the softness of the set, so it seemed
pointless. 
</P>
<P> Choosing the final photo, deciding how best to present it on the cover and
what sort of typeface to use for titles is yet another story. 
</P>
<H3>The Back Cover...</H3>
<P>This was in many ways much simpler to organise, but a lot harder to take.
Because it relates very specifically in image to The Ninth Wave, Kate had to be
in water. To be comfortable in the right clothes--in this case a Victorian
nightgown--the water had to be warm.  To get the feeling of night, sea, the
proximity of a large ship, etc., studio lighting was essential. We found some
big tanks used in the film business, but they weren't right visually--and they
would pose the problem of filling them with a couple of hundred gallons of warm
water and then getting rid of it. 
</P>
<P> We eventually located a large but shallow paddling-pool, and adapted this
so as to minimise the quantity of water we would have to deal with while
allowing enough to suggest deep sea and cold night around Kate. Because of the
large amount of electricity being used in the lights, leaks of water or big
splashes could have been dangerous, and someone was standing by the mains
throughout the session. I threw some pond weed into the now steaming water and
added the flowers to hint at the debris from a shipwreck. The logistics involved
in setting up and blending with Kate's work in the studio had left no time for
rehearsals, so Kate went straight in and I hovered around, first on a ladder,
then on the ground, looking for the right angle. And it's in these cases that
polaroid is so useful: I was able to take polaroids and show them to Kate, and
in this way we decided that I had to get in the water too in order to get the
best angle. 
</P>
<P> It was while I was printing up the best shots that I noticed that the
viewer's perception of the scene changed dramatically when I altered the natural
horizon by printing the photo slightly out of true. So actually, in the original
negative, she is obviously lying on her back in water, but in the final print
she appears to be standing or floating or running or flying. Also, this change
of perspective made the &quot;sea&quot; into a very surreal backcloth, so that
you wonder is she part of it, is she in it or what? 
</P>
<H3>Running Up That Hill...</H3>
<P>Because of Kate's keen interest in archery, combining an archer with the
images in the song seemed a strong way of presenting a portrait of Kate. Perhaps
the arrow is a message; perhaps it is Cupid's arrow; perhaps it's going straight
to the point of the relationship; perhaps...but really it's just a photograph
that makes its own statement, and you can fit anything you like to it. 
</P>
<P> The photo was taken in the studio with a background that I had painted the
night before, all thunder and sun and threatening clouds. The glove Kate is
wearing is one used in Kyudo (Japanese archery), and it is included for its
visual contrast with Kate and for its subtle colours; but the bow is being drawn
longbow style. The arrow is a Ya, used in Kyudo, and was selected over a
European one because of its length and beauty. 
</P>
<P> Again, making this photograph was a team effort. The pooling of ideas and
the inclusion of the make-up, hair, costume and technical people in the final
image made my role very much one part of a whole. By a patient searching of the
situation and an isolating of what seems best, the team produced the result. And
in the front and back of the single bag it was very easy to find angles that
worked. 
</P>
<P> The inside artwork was more complicated. After the archer shots were
completed, we headed for an outdoor location, because we wanted to use a
particular doorway that we knew of. It was two in the morning, and after we had
set up lights and the smoke machine, I wrote the lyrics from the song onto
Kate's back--and realised as I was doing it that the cold night air was going to
cause problems with the skin texture. But as it happened, by staying in the warm
until the last moment, this did not become a problem. 
</P>
<P> The final black-and-white photos I tinted by using Selenium toner (which I
would not recommend that anyone try unless they have a very well-aired and
-ventilated darkroom, as the fumes from the toner are poisonous). This gives
them a brown-purple cast that I find very pleasing.
