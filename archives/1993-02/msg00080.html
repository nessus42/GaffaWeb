&gt;A friend of mine &amp; I are starting to do our obligitory "Best of the
&gt;Year" list (we go from December to December because:
&gt;
&gt;a) To get the jump on everyone else
&gt;b) It's the most cliched, over-used idea, and if we do it real fast,
&gt;   no one will notice, and
&gt;c) December will be Magic! (again...)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, does anyone know the exact (more or less) U.S. release date
&gt;of "Little Earthquakes"?

I vastly enjoy compiling my Best of the Year lists, though I have to say
that I really resent the way magazines and radio stations turn it into
January-November, and thus I stick strictly to 1/1-12/31.  That said, I
have the exact same dilemma you're facing, as _Little Earthquakes_ is far
and away my favorite of the year, but its printed copyright date is 1991.
 After a great deal of thought, I have decided to grant it 1992
eligibility for these reasons:

1) All the singles and videos from it were released in 1992 (the original
UK CD5 of Me and A Gun being the one exception).
2) The music folio book for _Little Earthquakes_ lists the album as 1992.
3) Its my favorite debut album ever, and if it doesn't deserve an
exception, nothing does.
4) I realized that if I didn't count the album, then my 10 best song list
(I do both albums and songs) would be filled with Tori Amos CD-single
b-sides, and that seemed wrong.
5) In all previous cases where one of my favorite albums of a year was
actually released in a previous year, I felt that I clearly COULD have
got the record in its release-year.  LE, however, I was not even
peripherally aware of until 1992.

I realize that doesn't answer your question, but I'll look forward to
your list...
