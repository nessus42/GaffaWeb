&gt;
&gt;&gt;     He would like to add that although Mr. Maroney may be
&gt;&gt;quite certain that Kate herself would certainly condemn IED's activities,
&gt;&gt;IED is not, himself, so convinced. True, Kate is very upset that these
&gt;&gt;recordings have become available to the public at large--that much is
&gt;&gt;known for a fact. But Kate is also realistic enough to know that now that
&gt;&gt;these recordings are available commercially (though illegally), there
&gt;&gt;will be no stopping the zealous fan from obtaining them. Consequently
&gt;&gt;there is no reason to assume that she will view IED's entirely
&gt;&gt;altruistic distribution "scheme" with a particularly hostile eye.
&gt;&gt;It is even possible that she will forgive IED for his actions,
&gt;&gt;understanding the complex of emotions which has motivated him.

&gt;I would estimate the odds as perhaps one hundred to one against this
&gt;starry eyed vision.

I would agree.  IED's idealized (almost perfected) view of Kate Bush's
personality and artistic abilities is clouding his eyes.  And how does
IED know that "Kate is also realistic enough to know that..."?  You'd have
to really have known someone a long time to be able to predict that.

Also, artists don't always like their groupies (fans, or whatever).  Bob
Dylan, for one, has total contempt for his.  I'd think it be more likely
that an artist would be hostile to fans (i.e., fanatics)--after all, it's
they who prevent the artist from going to the supermarket to buy a loaf of
bread.

&gt;&gt;     One other comment regarding Mr. Maroney's remarks. The
&gt;&gt;hypothetical types whom Mr. Maroney describes--those whose "respect"
&gt;&gt;for Kate is so great that it prevents them from listening to seventeen
&gt;&gt;works of almost certain genius--are no doubt to be admired for their
&gt;&gt;astounding moral rectitude and their boundless respect for the rights of
&gt;&gt;the artist. Yet they are also, IED thinks, a little to be pitied. For it
&gt;&gt;is impossible for this fan, having been put so completely in the thrall
&gt;&gt;of Kate's art, to believe that the hypothetical types whom Mr. Maroney
&gt;&gt;describes can ever truly have fallen under the final, most elusive
&gt;&gt;and ultimately inescapable and irresistible spell of her magic. No.
&gt;&gt;In IED's opinion, anyone who has ever fully, finally lived amid
&gt;&gt;the limitless heights, depths and expanses of Kate's artistic realm,
&gt;&gt;could not _possibly_ resist the opportunity to look upon seventeen more
&gt;&gt;of that realm's miraculous vistas. Those who could resist such a
&gt;&gt;temptation would deserve our admiration for their virtue--but they would
&gt;&gt;also provoke our pity for the ignorance to which their self-abnegation
&gt;&gt;would subject them.

Pretty text.  But wake up and smell the coffee!  Not only did you pirate
(i.e., steal) Kate's private works, you have conspired to have them mass-
duplicated and distributed all over the United States!  You are not simply
an individual that happened to blunder upon the pirated works and keep
them for yourself.  No, you decided to go into the pirating business and
distribute them to anyone who asked.  That is, not only did you profit from
someone else's crime (the initial pirating), but you decided to join in and
become a criminal yourself.  How will those vistas look through bars?

&gt;     In any event, IED sent a letter to Kate ten days ago confessing
&gt;&gt;his crimes, and explaining in detail every facet of the whole sordid
&gt;&gt;story. The matter of IED's exoneration, pardon or condemnation,
&gt;&gt;therefore, is in Kate's hands. Please let it remain there, and IED
&gt;&gt;will not complain.
&gt;
&gt;Please be sure to post the cease and desist letter when it arrives.
&gt;The chances of Kate permanently abrogating her copyright in this
&gt;fashion are practically nil.

Post it?  How?  They don't let convicts use computer terminals! :-)
I wonder how many cancelations for the tape IED will receive now?  After
all, he has a master list of people wanting the tape--and their addresses.
That would make it all too easy for the FBI.

&gt;I am sure you consider it admirable that you have done this, but
&gt;even minimal respect for KT's interests would have demanded that
&gt;you do it *before* engaging in your criminal conspiracy.

Here, here!
