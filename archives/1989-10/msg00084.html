 To: Love-Hounds
 Subject: Moral issues
 From: IED

     Tim Maroney has made more good points, and IED doesn't disagree
with them. He can also see how Tim and others who share his point of
view might have taken umbrage at some of IED's "intemperate" language
of the past few days. Perhaps IED was just rationalizing his guilt.
     More important, Tim's posting has made IED re-think his plans
regarding this tape. So far it should be noted that no action of
any kind has been taken--not a single copy of the tape has been made
(except for a sample IED made at home and sent to Kate and John Carder
Bush for their own records), and none of the money has been touched--
no checks have been cashed.
     It's definitely a serious issue, and IED is no longer sure what
he will be doing about it. In any event, there are nearly two more weeks
to go before the July 2 deadline arrives, so there is plenty of time
to hear others' opinions and to await a possible reply from the Bush
family. If by July 2 nothing has been resolved through group discussion,
IED will make a personal decision regarding the tape project. Either
he'll go through with his original plan to make strictly non-profit
copies for those who asked in time, or he will return all the orders
without charge to anyone. In the first case he might run the risk of
antagonizing Kate Bush herself, and even of being prosecuted for copy-
right infringement. In the second case he will certainly be
disappointing a great many sincere fans of Kate's music, and indirectly
contributing to an increase in the bootleggers' profits. Both scenarios
are extremely unpleasant to imagine.
