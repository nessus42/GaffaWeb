<PRE>
I've been quiet of late, but I had to jump into this whole issue of
bootlegged recordings.

I have been known to make musical recordings of various degrees of interest.
If and when I ever become a major recording artist or just generic superstar,
and people decide that my work is _so_ interesting that they have to hear
all of it, even the stuff I decided was crap and threw in the trash can,
then more power to them.  The bottom line is exposure.  I am raving
egomaniac and I want the whole world to hear what I've been doing with
my time.  That's my personal view.  Kate's view is a bit different, and
I suppose we must respect her wishes, but then again, why are copyright laws
good and necessary things?  Anarchy now!  I don't mind if people make
tapes of my albums and give them to friends.  I _want_ them to hear the
music.  Hopefully they'll like it enough to buy the album, but if they don't
then at least they heard it.  Of course, this doesn't apply to bootlegs,
so we have to take a different approach.  It's a very tangled issue,
sadly.  I've been reading "The Beatles Recording Sessions" and it's a great
comprehensive indepth treatment of _every_ piece of tape they ever made
at Abbey Road, but it pales into total insignificance when you actually
plunk your illegally obtained copy of the first take of "Norweigian Wood"
into the player and hear it.

IED: I support you wholeheartedly.  Bootlegging is bad because these people
are making money at the expense of the artist.  Your motives are pure, and
if the world is too stupid to recognize it, then you can at least suffer
the penalties with a heart free of burden, yes?  I would be terribly interested
in seeing a copy of the letter you sent Kate.  If it is stored on computer,
could you mail a copy to me, or love-hounds at large if you think there's
interest.  Thanks.

When are we starting the "help defray IED's legal expense" fund?  We
could probably start with what's left of the "fly IED to the East Coast
for Katemas" fund from two years ago.  (What was it, Joe?  $.37, a coat
button, and some lint?)
