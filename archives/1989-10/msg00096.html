In article &lt;736@eutrc3.UUCP&gt; quoth Michel Waucomont:
&gt;Please let the quarrel about obsKuriTies II being illegal stop! I don't want
&gt;it to spoil the delight of listening to it. The knowledge that one day I will
&gt;receive obsKuriTies II and will have the privilege to enjoy this music has
&gt;improved my mood drastically. But that might change if, while listening to
&gt;it, I will have to think things like "Am I violating Copyright Laws?", 
&gt;"Did the original of this tape have a copyright notice on it?",
&gt;"Am I doing something unjust to Her?". Please don't do that. Please.

Aaaawwww.  You might have to actually think about the interests of
the artist you are insulting, as if she were a real human being instead
of a goddess?  Tsk, tsk, I feel so ashamed for disturbing your sleep.

Seriously, Mike, that's the least of your worries.  It is not at all
unlikely that KT's attorney's will require all copies to be returned
and destroyed.  In order to preserve the protection on a work of art,
it is a legal requirement that all infringements known to the holder
must be vigorously pursued.  If you fail to pursue even one, then you
no longer have the right to pursue any.  I can't say for sure that this
will happen, but it is quite possible that you will be contacted and
asked to hand over your tape.

"Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth: Now hear
  another: he has written all the old falshoods.
 And now hear the reason.  He conversed with Angels who are all religious, &amp;
  conversed not with Devils who all hate religion..."
