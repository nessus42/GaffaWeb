 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: _obsKuriTies_2_: a KuesTion of eThiKs?

 &gt; From: tim@toad.com (Tim Maroney)
 &gt; Subject: Re: IED's continued fulminations against the heretic
 &gt;
 &gt; Has it ever occurred to Monsieur Marvick that perhaps the reason some of
 &gt;us do not rush to buy his illegal bootlegs is out of respect for Ms. Bush
 &gt;and a consequent reluctance to steal from her?  Were she consulted about
 &gt;the project, I am quite sure her feelings would be anything but positive.
 &gt;He is fortunate to escape prosecution for his scheme, in my opinion.
 &gt;
 &gt;-- Tim Maroney, Mac Software Consultant, sun!hoptoad!tim, tim@toad.com

 &gt; From: Pete Hartman &lt;bradley!bucc2!pwh@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu&gt;
 &gt; Subject: obsKuriTies 1 and sound quality
 &gt;
 &gt;...Then again, maybe I just have a more forgiving ear
 &gt;after the FANTASTIC songs from the Demo sessions....
 &gt; Thank you SO much for bringing this music to light IED!
 &gt;
 &gt;-- Pete Hartman            ......noao &gt;!bradley!bucc2!pwh

     The two attitudes reprinted above--as different from each other
as two attitudes could be--demonstrate the complexity of the ethical
dilemma which these demos create. IED does not in the least deny
the power of Tim Maroney's argument. On the contrary, IED feels its
righteousness only too strongly, even as he continues on the tenebrous
moral path to which he committed himself two weeks ago. He hopes that
Mr. Maroney, and any others on this group who may share Mr. Maroney's
indignation, will take the time to consider the delicacy of this
problem before condemning either IED himself or the many Love-Hounds
who have decided to join him (albeit as recipients rather than as
co-distributors) in the current project.
     IED obtained a cassette containing a collection of previously
unknown and certainly unreleased early songs written and recorded
by Kate Bush. He was given a chance to listen to a bit of this music
before buying, and though aware of the transgression which his act
constituted, he could not resist buying the music from the unscrupulous
merchant who had offered it.
     Now, owning these recordings, IED's feeling of guilt at having
obtained them in the first place--bad enough by itself--was compounded
by a new feeling of guilt at enjoying the music _in_exclusivity_.
Granted that it was not "right" for him to own and listen to the songs
at all, was it not less right still for him to listen to them, to
enjoy them, to be enraptured by them--and not to _share_ them with other
fans as appreciative of and devoted to Kate's work as himself?
     A difficult question to answer. For although in depriving other
fans of these recordings he might possibly (and this is only a
possibility, by _no_ means a certainty) be seen by Kate to
be worsening, rather than in some measure expiating, his original
crime, he would also be acting in a mean and petty way by refusing
to allow other fans to hear his tape. Furthermore, by failing to
make the music available to other sincerely interested lovers of Kate's
work, he would also be condoning--even conspiring in--the
activities of the merchant from whom he had obtained his original
copy (at an outrageously inflated price, need it be said). For what
else but conspiracy could be called the decision to keep to himself
his copy of the music, knowing full well that by doing so he would be
helping profiteers to swell their purses from the illegal sale of the
same recordings? Having done the first foul deed (buying the merchant's
copy of the tape), would it not have been fouler still _not_ to
have found a way of sharing the music in the least expensive way,
making certain to exclude all profit motives from the operation?
     IED doesn't know how many readers of this group share Mr.
Maroney's sentiments--that IED should be prosecuted for this crime--
but perhaps there are a substantial number of you. To you IED
sincerely apologizes. Naturally, he also asks your indulgence, and
will take it as a personal kindness (perhaps one which he does not
deserve) if you will not report him to the authorities.
     He would like to add that although Mr. Maroney may be
quite certain that Kate herself would certainly condemn IED's activities,
IED is not, himself, so convinced. True, Kate is very upset that these
recordings have become available to the public at large--that much is
known for a fact. But Kate is also realistic enough to know that now that
these recordings are available commercially (though illegally), there
will be no stopping the zealous fan from obtaining them. Consequently
there is no reason to assume that she will view IED's entirely
altruistic distribution "scheme" with a particularly hostile eye.
It is even possible that she will forgive IED for his actions,
understanding the complex of emotions which has motivated him.
     One other comment regarding Mr. Maroney's remarks. The
hypothetical types whom Mr. Maroney describes--those whose "respect"
for Kate is so great that it prevents them from listening to seventeen
works of almost certain genius--are no doubt to be admired for their
astounding moral rectitude and their boundless respect for the rights of
the artist. Yet they are also, IED thinks, a little to be pitied. For it
is impossible for this fan, having been put so completely in the thrall
of Kate's art, to believe that the hypothetical types whom Mr. Maroney
describes can ever truly have fallen under the final, most elusive
and ultimately inescapable and irresistible spell of her magic. No.
In IED's opinion, anyone who has ever fully, finally lived amid
the limitless heights, depths and expanses of Kate's artistic realm,
could not _possibly_ resist the opportunity to look upon seventeen more
of that realm's miraculous vistas. Those who could resist such a
temptation would deserve our admiration for their virtue--but they would
also provoke our pity for the ignorance to which their self-abnegation
would subject them.
     In any event, IED sent a letter to Kate ten days ago confessing
his crimes, and explaining in detail every facet of the whole sordid
story. The matter of IED's exoneration, pardon or condemnation,
therefore, is in Kate's hands. Please let it remain there, and IED
will not complain.
