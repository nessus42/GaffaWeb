 Subject: p. reich book correKTion; KT merchandise news; and a new rumour

     The new edition of Peter Reich's _A_Book_of_Dreams_ is published
by Dutton-Obelisk, not "Bellisk". (Third-hand info is nearly always
wrong.) Also, there _is_ a mention of Kate on the back-cover blurb:
she is listed among several pop-culture figures who have acknowledged
the book's inspiring influence upon them. She is _not_ identified in
the photo, nor is John Carder Bush credited for his photograph. The
brief new preface by Peter Reich is a wonderfully concise explanation
of his reasons for remaining vague about his "stand" on WR's theories--
words which also serve as justification for Kate's own evasiveness.
     Two more KT posters have surfaced at West Coast record meets. One is
a new pressing of a photograph of Kate, ca. 1978, dressed in a body-suit
with a silk sash round her waist. The photo is in black and white, and
IED believes it first appeared among the photographs included in the
sheet-music book for the _Lionheart_ album. This photo was made into
a poster and sold widely about a year ago, in an edition which featured
"Kate Bush" in a sort of blueish script, diagonally, across the top
left or right corner. The new edition has no such marking, but below
the photo, in a small strip of white, are the words "Kate Bush--Wuthering
Heights" in block capitals.
     The other poster is much more interesting. It's a very high-quality
colour reproduction of a good photograph of Kate in her "2-faced" costume
from the Dr. Hook _Babooshka_ lip-synch video-performance. It's a head-to
-waist shot, head-on, showing Kate in the midst of the performance, and
it's very well done. The poster is made of good, heavy paper. The
photo is framed by a thin black line and, below the photo, by the name
"Kate Bush". The company that makes it is "Splash". An exceptionally
well designed poster. IED doesn't know what the legal status of these
things is, nor where they really were made.

KT Rumour:
^^^^^^^^^^
     IED has been told that Kate Bush is an active guest-musician on
several tracks of Roy Harper's "new" album. Unfortunately IED's source
is not a knowledgeable Kate fan, nor did he remember the title of the
album, but he says Kate's voice is unmistakable. He says she sings and
plays keyboards on several tracks, but that only Paddy Bush is actually
credited in the album's liner-notes. Kate herself is identified only as
--"Jackie Turnip"!
     IED will, with any luck, be able to hear the CD of this album
sometime this week, but in the meantime any clarification from Roy
Harper afficionados would be much appreciated.
