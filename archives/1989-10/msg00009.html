 To: Love-Hounds
 From: IED
 Subject: obsKuriTies 2 update; misK.; and KT NEWS

     Well, IED's not as mad as he was yesterday. He even answers the
latest question to be asked and answered again (for about the fifth
time).
     First, though: IED has received eleven orders for the second
tape so far. The people whose orders have been received are: Julian
West, John M. Relph, Michael J. Mendelson, Tracy L. Roberts and
James C. Mathiesen, Scott C. Crumpton, Steve Carter, Mark Semich,
Stephen D. Tynor and Peter F. Hill (x2). All came in the last two days.
Not all of the above included a return-address envelope (though some did
thoughtfully overpay to make up for the omission). Do try to provide
the return-addressed, stamped (and probably padded) envelope with your
orders, if you can. IED would rather have that little task taken care
of in advance than deal with the extra money. But it's not really
important.
     The reason Terry Gilliam is thanked in the liner-notes of _Hounds_
of_Love_ is because he helped Kate work on the storyboards for the
_Cloudbusting_ video and then, when he couldn't continue, helped Kate
to get the right crew to work with. (The video's director, Julian
Doyle, worked under Gilliam on _Brazil_, one of Kate's favourite
films.) Also, there are references to Gilliam's films in her own
self-directed video _The_Big_Sky_. And she also contracted Michael
Kamen, now a very busy and highly respected filmscore composer but
then virtually unused except by Gilliam, to provide orchestral
arrangements on _The_Ninth_Wave_; and shortly after _Brazil_ came
out Kate was invited to record her own version of the old popular
song _Brazil_ for the soundtrack album. That album was never released,
and Kate's version obviously doesn't appear in the film itself, so
no-one has ever heard it, but it's another sign of the close ties
between Kate and Gilliam.

KT NEWS:
^^^^^^^^
     In the May '89 issue of the Dutch Kate Bush fanzine _Kate_,
co-editor (and longtime penpal of IED's) Theo Haast writes about the
22 demos. As far as IED could make out (the fanzine's text is in
Dutch), Theo recently visited the U.S., and while there he obtained
a copy of the 22 demos on a cassette. Apparently his copy was from
an earlier generation, or at least a different source, because his
version came with a listing of titles. Some of his titles are definitely
wrong, but others are so apt that they suggest the possibility that some
of the titles were Kate's original ones. No way to know for sure.
     But the bigger news is that Theo's tape contained, in addition
to the 22 demos (identified as dating from 1976, quite plausibly),
an additional _6_ demos "from 1977". Of these, however, only one
is a song that fans have never heard before. Note: IED does _not_ have
these six demos, and it may be quite some time (if ever) before he
finds a copy. Anyway, here are the titles, as Theo lists them:

     The first 22 songs:
_The_Kick_Inside_
_Hammer_Horror_
_Kashka_From_Baghdad_
_Oh_To_Be_in_Love_
_Violin_
_It_Hurts_Me_ (IED's title: _Feeling_Like_a_Waltz_)
_Stranded_at_Moonbase_ (IED's title: _Keeping_Me_Waiting_)
_Surrender_into_the_Roses_ (IED's title: _Camilla_)
_Rinfy_the_Gypsy_ (IED's title: _Playing_Canasta_in_Cold_Rooms_)
_On_Fire_Inside_a_Snowball_ (IED's titles: _Hot_in_the_Ice_, _Set_In_the_Snow_)
_Dali_ (IED's title: _Ferry_Me_Over_)
_Where_Are_the_Lionhearts?_ (IED's title: _On_the_Rocks_)
_The_Craft_of_Love_ (IED's _correct_ title: _The_Craft_of_Life_)
_The_Gay_Farewell_ (IED's title: _Eddie_the_Queen_)
_Something_Like_a_Song_
_Frightened_Eyes_
_The_Disbelieving_Angel_
_Nevertheless,_You'll_Do_
_Come_Closer_to_Me,_Babe_ (IED's title: _Who_is_Sylvia?_)
_So_Soft_ (IED's title: _You're_Soft_)
_The_Rare_Flower_ (IED's title: _Pick_the_Rare_Flower_)
_While_Davey_Dozed_ (IED's title: _Davy_)

     And the six other demos:
_Moving_
_Don't_Push_Your_Foot_on_the_Heartbrake_
_Kite_
_L'Amour_Looks_Something_Like_You_
_Strange_Phenomena_
_Scares_Me_Silly_ (the "new" song)
