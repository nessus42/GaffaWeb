In article &lt;8906182333.AA23171@hop.toad.com&gt;, Love-Hounds-request@GAFFA.MIT.EDU writes...
&gt;Really-From: tim@toad.com (Tim Maroney)
&gt; 
&gt;Mr. Maroney would point out that his message was provoked, not so much
&gt;by indignation at the act itself (though that is real), but at the
&gt;continued refusal of Marvick himself "to consider the delicacy of this
&gt;problem before condemning" those of us who choose not to participate.

I think that if Mr. Maroney had read this newsgroup for any number of months
he would have understood IED's position on bootlegs and the like.  Therefore,
I have no doubts that IED has spent much time exploring the moral ramifications
of the distribution of this work.

&gt;His statements on the matter have been extremely intemperate and
&gt;deliberately insulting, implying -- no, stating outright! -- that those
&gt;of us who do not buy these bootlegs have an inferior appreciation of
&gt;KT's work.  It is primarily an emotional reaction to the nth repetition
&gt;of this self-righteous, "bushier than thou" attitude which led to
&gt;Maroney's counterattack; and now Marvick is requesting a courtesy for
&gt;himself which he has always refused to those of us on the other side of
&gt;the fence.

Are you a _fanatic_ - have you spent the time and resources that one can only
glimpse that IED has in his devotion to KT?  Although not the best emotional
argument I have no delusions about who is the "bushiest" (and it ain't you).

&gt;Mr. Maroney has stated no such thing.  He has stated only that IED is
&gt;lucky not to have been prosecuted for the crime.  This is not an
&gt;expression of his personal wishes, only of pragmatic reality.

Actually from a legal point of view I &gt;highly&lt; doubt that the demo-tapes
were/are copyrighted.  And I after reading Mr. Moroney's first post I thought
that he was implying that IED should be prosecuted - aren't we amongst friends
here?

&gt;came in the form a cease and desist letter from the Pythons'
&gt;solicitors, and he was obliged to post a network message requesting
 ^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;Perhaps you are unaware that if the Pythons, or KT, were to behave in
&gt;any wise differently, they would legally have surrendered their
&gt;copyright forever in the material.  Perhaps you are unaware that
&gt;copyright, which you have violated so profligately, is meant to be a
&gt;legal reflection of the moral right of artists to control distribution
&gt;of their material.  In any case, I repeat that to violate it shows
&gt;disrespect for the author's rights and interests.

I would highly doubt that the 'Pythons' knew/know anything about this
incident - I wonder if it were the lawyers who thought that they might
be losing $$$$$ that sent the s&amp;d letter - did the artsist have any say -
I highly doubt it.

&gt;I do not think this is as different from rape as it might
&gt;appear to someone who is not themselves an artist.  If you are looking
&gt;for parallels in history, you might consider that Dickens' hatred for
&gt;America had a great deal to do with the widespread pirating of his work
&gt;in the States.

As a writer and 'artist' myself I find this analogy highly offensive and
lacking in good taste - the whole argument smacks of the 'have you beaten your
wife lately' logic.  I could never speek for KT - but I doubt 
that she is loosing too much sleep over the matter - I think that in general
we are attaching too much significance to the matter. 

&gt;I am sure you consider it admirable that you have done this, but
&gt;even minimal respect for KT's interests would have demanded that
&gt;you do it *before* engaging in your criminal conspiracy.

Now it is you who dictate the docterine of "bushiness".

&gt;And finally, I hope you will see fit to send her a copy of both
&gt;IED's and Maroney's messages on this subject.

Why don't _you_  - you seem to feel strongly enough about the subject.

&gt;"Something was badly amiss with the spiritual life of the planet, thought
&gt; Gibreel Farishta.  Too many demons inside people claiming to believe in
&gt; God." -- Salman Rushdie, THE SATANIC VERSES

Now let me see - if I were a devout Muslim I could not question docterine -
therefore I have no choice but to condemn Salman Rushdie to death.  And if
I were a lawyer (and the demos tape was copyrighted - which I doubt) I would
have no choice but to condemn IED for his copying of it.  Do you see a flaw 
in this logic????????
