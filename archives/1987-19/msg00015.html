&gt; Subject: Breathing the gossip in...?

&gt; OK, I just looked through the most recent _Homeground_ - what's this
&gt; article on Madonna doing in it?  This fanzine is very odd.  ...  Let
&gt; me regale you with a quote: "Despite the fact that they are worlds
&gt; apart, and have a totally different set of standards, Kate and
&gt; Madonna share two very important things; firstly they are in control
&gt; of their lives - they are the bosses - and secondly they are both
&gt; determined to follow their own personal star.  Love her or hate her,
&gt; Madonna deserves your respect as a human being in control."

"Despite the fact that they are worlds apart, and have a totally different
set of standards, the common amoeba and Madonna share two very important
things; firstly they have an emetic effect on humans - they hit you
in the gut, as it were - and secondly they are both determined to follow the
musical sensibilities of protozoa.  Love her or hate her, Madonna deserves
your respect as an effective substitute for dysentery."

By a strange coincidence, the latest word I've picked up is remarkably
applicable to virtually all of Madonna's work: sterquilinian.

&gt; Subject: IED catches up on the L-Hs Mailbag

&gt; Thanks for the info re the vegetarian LP. IED supposes he could try
&gt; calling WFNX for a rereading of the address...except he's not too
&gt; sure how to find WFNX. In the Boston area? (Ignorant West Coaster,
&gt; sorry.)

Aye, Boston area it is.  This month being what it has been, I haven't
listened to the radio all that much and consequently, I have nothing
new to report on that address.  Wouldn't the KBC be knowledgeable
about such things?

&gt; About whether Kate's track is new material or not, the fact that
&gt; she hasn't written on that subject before is no guarantee that she...
&gt; ... On the other hand, the fact that this album is...
&gt; ... On the third hand, she _did_ once...
&gt;
&gt; -- Andrew Marvick

Yeah, my thoughts exactly.  I think.

&gt; Subject: DA rules OK

&gt;&gt; From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;
&gt;&gt; In order to make Love-Hounds hopefully continue at a reasonable
&gt;&gt; bandwidth, I'd like to ask for a volunteer to moderate Love-Hounds
&gt;&gt; until I have free time again.  The volunteer should probably use
&gt;&gt; Unix and be on the Internet.

Dunno if my offer made it to you, but I'd be glad to fill in, Doug.

	[ Yes, it did!  Thank you for the offer.  I just have to
	  prepare some instructions and decide how to do this best.
	  John Relph also volunteered, so you'll have to fight it
	  out....  -- |&gt;oug ]

&gt; Memo to IED re 3rd Ball video - I'll let you know when I track down a
&gt; copy.  The CD music version of the event actually only has one extra
&gt; track compared to the vinyl and it is not one of Kate's contributions
&gt; (Third World Party or somesuch if I remember).

The extra track was "Ship of Fools" by World Party.

&gt; Subject: Re: Boston stores?

&gt; Newbury Comics is horribly overpriced, often OVER list price!
&gt; However they do have the largest selection of posters, T-shirts,
&gt; calendars, books, and what-not.  (Actually, now that I think
&gt; about it, probably decent for KT paraphenalia)

Well, actually not.  About the only KT paraphenalia I've seen there
has been Vermorel's "Secret History..." and of course, the domestic
albums.  No shirts, posters, fanzines, video, or whatnot yet.

	[ Newbury Comics has had some nice KT Kollectibles on
	  occassion.  They just don't necessarily stay in stock, so
	  you have to get them while they're hot.  -- |&gt;oug ]

I'm thinking about visiting my uncle in L.A. sometime next January
(gotta use up this ticket by March, ya see); are there any stores
of note that I should visit if I do?

Christmas is but two weeks away, and 1988 only another week more,
a year which should bring forth another miraculous work from Our Kate.
Hallelujah!

p.s. The local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Movie Quotes has
brought some errata to my attention.  In my last two .signatures, then,
please replace the words "transfixed" and "parson" with "transfigured"
and "vicar" respectively.
