&gt; Anyway, I don't think of TMDR as the typical 80s synthowhiz (though he
&gt; obviously knows how to use synthesizers), but as a songwriting musician
&gt; who cares a lot about sound and arrangements.  The instrumentation for
&gt; _The Flat Earth_ features very little analog synthesis, (and rather
&gt; spare use of the Fairlight) and a lot of real piano.

Having listened to _The Golden Age Of Wireless_ incessantly for years,
I was a bit thrown when _Flat Earth_ came out.  It was a VERY radical
departure.  I have a brief interview with Dolby from an old "Rock Over
London" that I might get around to transcribing (assuming I ever finish
the Maddy Prior interview, and, hey, IED, where's the Gloria Hunniford
one anyway?  Not like I'd get to it soon anyway....  :-)

_Flat Earth_ grows on you though!  I hated the title track, but now I'm
enthralled by it.  Beautiful!  I was mostly disappointed when I went to
see him in concert and he was plugging _Flat Earth_ heavily - and all
I had heard off it was _Hyperactive!_.

OK, I just looked through the most recent _Homeground_ - what's this
article on Madonna doing in it?  This fanzine is very odd.  At least
there isn't any of that pretentious poetry stuff this issue.  I think
we need more meatier articles such as the one detailing the release of
the single of _The Dreaming_.  I don't know how many people out there
have read it, but this fanzine devotes an ENTIRE PAGE to a summary of
Madonna's career.  Let me regale you with a quote: "Despite the fact
that they are worlds apart, and have a totally different set of
standards, Kate and Madonna share two very important things; firstly
they are in control of their lives - they are the bosses - and
secondly they are both determined to follow their own personal star.
Love her or hate her, Madonna deserves your respect as a human being
in control."

This is embarrassing!!  Madonna is the lowest type of performer - she
shamelessly manipulates the media and her image to generate maximum
profit - and these bozos have the gall to term her "a human being in
control" - ok, so, she's controlling your wallet.  And to even DREAM
of comparing this cretinous populist tramp to Our Kate Of Perennial
Warmth is heresy bordering on the criminally insane!  Kate does indeed
have a totally different set of standards!  Kate is an ARTIST first
and foremost - the fancy haircuts (which Kate doesn't even have) and
exotic wardrobes (Kate ain't THAT glitzy - well, not anymore, anyway!)
are all just accoutrements that help push her ART into the public eye.
OK, OK, I think you've all got the point.  Maybe I should forward this
to Homeground.  Maybe...
