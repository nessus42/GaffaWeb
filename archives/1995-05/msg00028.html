Well, my friend, the mainstream impression is wrong. It is fostered by a 
conservative media that does not want to give any credit to feminism and 
shows it merely as a radical fringe group. That is how someone as 
intelligent as KT can be lulled into thinking that feminism is not 
something she believes in. Which, I believe, is false judging by the 
strong female-focused energy in her songs. She may not call herself a 
feminist because of all the backlash against the feminist movement, but 
she writes lyrics like one.

I"m truly sorry they feel that way, however, I believe they are in the

As do most feminists. There is not some huge feminist control group that 
decided women must be a certain way and that sex was bad, etc. Instead, 
there are radical feminists that choose to question the basic assumptions 
of our heterosexist, patriarchal society. It is these women, naturally, 
who get the most play on the media and that is because the media has two 
main purposes: to sell products and to enforce a vision of reality. In 
the media's vision, all feminists must be portrayed as radical to keep 
other women and men from finding out the ideas at the base of feminism 
because then it is possible that real social change could happen. 

 
Your experience with Feminism may be different, since certainly all

: with such knowledge you can fight against becoming irrelevant.
Well, the black power/civil rights movement also is a dirty word in many 
parts of this country. Would you agree that the media always fairly 
reports on the issues of racism and on the leaders of the 
African-American movements? Or do you turn a blind eye to the media's 
false portrayal of feminism only? Is the black power movement, by 
analogy, thus irrelevent?

: P.S. I asked a pannel of Sex-Positive Feminists what they thought

: an ideal of beauty against which most women cannot hope to attain.

True, Vogue is worse for women's self esteem issues that deal with unreal 
beauty. However, porn magazines lend to the general feeling in this 
country of women being the passive objects of male desire. Women in most 
porn are seen only through the eyes of men; they are merely things on 
which/with which to obtain male pleasure. And feminists do work against 
the negative beauty images in fashion magazines; in fact in NYC during 
Fashion show week, there was a whole symposium sponsored by NOW about the 
fashion industry.

I agree that there needs to be a wider spectrum of sexual images 
available. I am not an anti-pornography feminist, and the majority of the 
activists I know aren't either. We're too busy defending clinics and 
working to keep Daycare in the NYC budget to worry about the blantantly 
unreal and plasticized women in Playboy. 
: Of course, this does not mean that there would still not be ideals of

True, but you don't have to look at david everyday, whereas everyday women 
have to look at ads, etc. that portray a distorted body image.
Anyways, don't dis feminism unless you have something intelligent to say, 
not merely re-iterating attacks from the "mainstream" media.
BTW, the mainstream music media doesn't consider KT to be very relevent; 
does that mean we should all change our beliefs?

But don't take this as a personal attack, just an attack against media 
false information.
