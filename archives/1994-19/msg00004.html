Hi,

&gt; Actually, I was about to tell you all about it, but someone was
&gt; quicker. Good thing though: more people will see it that way.
&gt; A friend of mine (who lives in Gothenburg too, Jan) told me he
&gt; could order TLTCTC as an import from Holland, from some record
&gt; store in Gothenburg. I have avoided reading postings about TLTCTC
&gt; until I have seen it, so I didn't realize the video was already
&gt; released in some countries.
 
I would be very surprised if this store in Gothenburg would succeed
in importing this video from a country where the video hasn't even
been available. I don't know, but it seems to me that this store is
making you happy with a dead sparrow (as we put it here). As far as
availability goes, the video hasn't been released anywhere, and it
won't be until late this year, if at all this year. So they told me
at Fame, Hollands biggest music store, a few weeks ago. They keep
a close look on Kate, and have gotten hold of many rare items over
recent months, and had ordered the TLTCTC video, which of course
drew my attention.
 
&gt; I don't recall the name of the store right now, but if there are
&gt; any people living in the vicinity (read western Sweden) of
&gt; Gothenburg, interested in the video, I could always dig up the
&gt; name of that store.
 
I'd advise you to order that video, and see the egg on their face
a few weeks after that...
 
BTW They are ordering a CD of "Live in Hammersmith" now. I don't
know if that's an audio CD, as they use the same codes for Audio
CD's and Video CD's (Laserdiscs). I can ask them what's up. I
remember hearing a vague rumour here recently that an audio-CD
might be released...? ? ? ?
