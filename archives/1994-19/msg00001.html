I'm not sure it will be.  Virgin in the UK were selling Part 1 for 99p.
It was a non-returnable stock item that they wanted to get rid of.

I understand your hesitation.  The cost-benefit analysis of this two part
CD5 came very close to being negative for me.

The video mix of Cloudbusting was on the suggested track listings for
the Boxed set that IED and I sent to EMI all those years ago.  We put
everything that could be put on CD in to that letter.  I don't think
we were even met half way :-(

I wonder if EMI are putting previously successful Kate singles that have
not had a CD single release to entice new fans?  It is incredibly 
frustrating for the loyal crowd when there is material available
that still hasn't seen CD.  I especially want MWtCiHE single mix (with the
"He's here" spoken intro) and Dreamtime.  

Unless there's another CD single from TRS, Europe is without the
full extended mix of ETM.  They could have put this and the MOP 
instrumental on the TRS singles and I would have been happier.    

No one responded to my enquiry about TBS.  It is not the album mix!  
Is it the single mix?  I forgot to dig out my TWS to check that.  Can
anyone tell off the top of their head?  

I'm not sure how much longer I am prepared to be insulted by EMI.   
I have better things to spend $20+ on than a couple of songs.  
It feels rather sad to say that.  I think my enthusiasm for Kate
is waning :-(
