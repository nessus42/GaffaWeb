 I have a very large collection of Kate Bush items for sale.  For those
 of you who have known me for a long time on this newsgroup, you should
 not take it as a sign that I am no longer interested in Kate.  Rather,
 I simply need the money -- very badly!

 All prices include postage and handling within the US.  If you are 
 outside the US, email me for a price.  Payment must be COD or by money
 order, and if the latter then I must receive payment first.  If you
 have any questions, please feel free to email me at ed@wente.llnl.gov.
