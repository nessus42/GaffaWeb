Folks,

In reading over these latest Kate initiation stories, it seems like
most of you didn't like Kate to start out.  If you didn't like her
music to begin with, why did you "come back for more"?  The only
thing I can relate this to is when I was a kid and my mother tried to
get me to eat cauliflower.  I didn't like it then, and even though
I had to eat it, I don't like it now (ooo, I can see the cauliflower
flameware glowing on the horizon...).  Or is it more like the
way top 40 stations and music video programs operate:  saturate the
airwaves with a particular tune until everyone has heard it 
2.3 zillion times and buys it for whatever reason I don't know.

The first time I heard RUTH, way back when it was getting air play
on the only "modern rock" station Utah ever had, I was hooked.
I haven't been disappointed with anything I have heard from her
since.

I figure, if I didn't like it the first time, I probably won't the
2.3 zillionth time.

Here's another "Kate first experience":
My daughter, also named Kate (hmmmm...), is almost 5 and 
has always enjoyed Kate Bush.  I've been 
playing it for her since she was born.  She really enjoys listening to
Kate Bush and expressing her interpretation of the music through dance.  
It's really quite amazing to watch what she does to a particular song.
She makes quite the little Babooshka!
Back a couple of years ago, she used to SAY that SHE was Kate
Bush and would dance around trying to sing along and say, "Daddy,
listen!  It's Me Bush!"  So, if nobody has seen or heard anything
from Kate Bush lately...
