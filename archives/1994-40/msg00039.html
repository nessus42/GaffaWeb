Greetings all you KateFans. 

I just read a week's worth of Love Hounds Digests and am *totally intrigued*
with the idea of doing a Tarot deck created from  Kate images.  I have some
knowledge of Tarot symbolism and reading techniques and would be pleased to
contribute what I can.  

About the symbolism -- Pete Hartman piped in:

&gt;Those symbols are supposed to be important
&gt;at some level; you could omit them, but I doubt a
&gt;serious Tarot reader would want to use them unless you
&gt;were serious enough to be able to explain why you omitted
&gt;them.

I tend to come from a school that is fairly flexible about this.  There are
lots and lots of different versions of the cards, each with the symbols drawn
from different sources of inspiration.  There are, for example, Fool cards
without the little dog, though that is a very common image.  Other "serious"
readers sometimes use completely different decks.   (For example, my own
teacher has a set of Sandman trading cards that she uses as a deck.)  For our
purposes, however, traditional symbols are, however, an excellent place to
start. 

It might also be interesting (but tricky) to try to link the theme of the
song to which a particular Kate image be connected to the individual cards.

The biggest difficulty I see with actually DOING this is the question of how
to get folks with access to scanners and Photoshop together with folks with
access to a wealth of Kate images from which to choose together with folks
who know something about Tarot symbolism.

As IED put it:

&gt;The question is, is there sufficient interest in this proposed project to
&gt;inspire the kind of careful graphic and scholarly 
&gt;work that it would undoubtedly require?  IED would like to think so.

So would I.  I'm certainly game. 

A few ideas --&gt; 

Kate in the Lion costume for Strength.  

The four Angels from Lily in \+) would fit nicely into the Judgement card.
(It's been awhile since I've seen \+), does anyone recall if the angels also
carry trumpets?)

Lily herself might do well as The Crone, though its too bad there is no video
for Jig of Life.  ("Hello old lady, I know your face well ... It belongs to
me.")  An even better idea might be a picture of Kate's Mum.  

Musing along and wishing that I'd had better exposure to Kate imagery over
the years,
