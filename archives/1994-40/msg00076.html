I personally think a Kate Tarot would be neat--prob. useless for 
divination purposes, but as there is a modern tradition of "art" Tarots 
(such as the Dali Tarot) where the Tarot is treated as an art form more 
than a tool for divination.  As such, a Kate tarot would work (but until 
one tries to use it for divination, one will never know).  I have a small 
collection of Tarot/cartomancy cards (6 decks or so), and a Kate deck 
would be an interesting idea.

I also think that having only one or two people in charge of it would be 
best, merely from a logistics point of view.  As for Tarot cards being 
designed by many artists, there is at least one deck I know of that was 
designed that way.  I can't remember the name of it right now, but it was 
a feminist/lesbian deck and was round.  (This is NOT the Motherpeace deck 
which is also feminist and also round.)  The way I understood that they 
did it was that a few people were in charge, and they asked submissions 
and then chose the best ones for each card.  In some cases, they couldn't 
decide or thought two were equally good, so they included both in the deck.
Perhaps this system would work for a Kate deck?

As for how Kate would react, there's only one true way to find out--ask 
her.  After all, only she knows her opinions on the matter!

Personally, I think a "true believer" would only be offended if they 
considered it to be a trivializing of the Tarot--but if it is treated as 
an "art" deck, then this would not be a problem.  (How the purchasers of 
such a deck treat it is in itself another matter.)
