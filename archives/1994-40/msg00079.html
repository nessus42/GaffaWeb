&gt; You people drive me nuts with bickerening!  Karen your so stupid you think
&gt; Chris is kidding.  I think he is now serious because he is all times serious
&gt; and thinks every Love Hounds should do what he says. 

&lt;argh&gt; Look, Karen's post pissed me off, but I deleted it quick so I
wouldn't be tempted to answer.  I can't ignore this one though.  Take
your sarcasm and stick it in your AOL folder.  Chris does *not* think
"every Love Hound should do what he says" and I don't particularly like
your portrayal of him in that way.  Chris gave his *opinion* and presented
it to the group.  He has a right to do that, you know.  His opinion is as
valid as anyone else's, and certainly as valid as the Tarot folks.  Chris
has *no* delusions of grandeur that his opinion would sway anyone and no
expectations that *anyone* should or would do what he says.

Whether or not Chris went too far in trying to predict what Kate might
think about the Tarot cards isn't the point.  I wouldn't have done it
myself, but we hardly agree on everything, and we don't monitor what
each other posts.  I *do* agree that it would be nice if the Tarots
took it to e-mail, but it really doesn't matter that much because I
delete it all anyway.  My personal opinion is that Tarot is a bunch of
hooey, but I have no problems with other's beliefs in it.  I'd be more
interested in a regular deck of playing cards and/or a calandar, as
would Chris, but neither of us is out to put a stop to the Tarot idea.


Oh, and Karen, you know *perfectly well* that Chris has ALWAYS given
full and complete credit to all the wonderful people who were involved
in the Tape Tree, from Kimmo to Uli to Peter Manchester to Cynthia to
all the great people who were leaves.  You also know *perfectly well*
that it was *CHRIS* who was the one who spent hours and hours of his
time, and a few hundred bucks to put it all together.  We can't win...
we stay quiet and humble about all the time and money Chris spent,
but when 2 situations come up where it is brought up, Chris gets
blasted for trying to take all the credit.   I wouldn't be suprised
if Chris just said forget it, let someone else do it next time.

Vickie
