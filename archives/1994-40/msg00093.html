Hi,
 
Knowing nothing about Tarot at all, I am becoming increasingly
interested in the art as plans of a Kate Tarot deck are taking on
shape.
 
Then, out of the blue, &lt;chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (chris
williams)&gt; writes:
 
&gt; I usually don't concern myself too much about how Kate would view
&gt; our projects, but the Tarot cards are an especially bad idea.
&gt; There are two possible ways Kate could view this. Either:
&gt; Kate believes in Tarot: The idea of seeing a tarot deck featuring
&gt; herself as all the cards. Oh, that would be nice. I presume this
&gt; would include Death. Great, especially considering the number of
&gt; close friends of her's who have died in recent years, and the
&gt; trauma of the death of her mother.
&gt; Kate does not believe in Tarot: I don't hold out much hope for
&gt; this possibility (especially with the pernicious influence of
&gt; "Lily" in her life) but if she does not, she would be deeply
&gt; offended. Of course a real believer would be equally offended by
&gt; an "ancient art" being perverted in this way. (Note to true
&gt; believers of all stripes: This could launch a whole like of KT
&gt; religious products, sure to offend those of all faiths. KT
&gt; communion wafers. Knitted KT Love-Hounds yarmulkas.)
 
Not to forget, a KaTe Krucifix. However, I get the distinct feeling
you are telling the story of your own decision-making here. It is
clear you are a firm non-"believer", as the opposition against the
whole Tarot-project could be viewed more objectively than above. I
have read your posts for over a year now and it's clear your not
into the spiritual theme. That's fine, perfectly okay, but it makes
your comments a little too biased IMHO.
And where did you get the narrow-minded idea that Kate wants her
fans to do exactly what she wants them to do? In recent discussions
it has been made clear Kate doesn't care a "flying f-or crying out
loud" about her fans. She is following her muze.
 
&gt; Sorry Karen, but it's hardly a fair comparison. The original
&gt; tapes were produced by one person in one long night. The tapes
&gt; were then duplicated by a group of people, a job that required
&gt; altruism and dedication, but not artistic skill (not that the
&gt; tapetree tapes exhibit that much skill.)
 
So basically you're saying here that projects involving artistic
skills are nicht erwunscht on gaffa/love-hounds?
 
[...]
&gt; [The tapetree] happened in the background via e-mail. It would be
&gt; nice if the tarot-people would show the same courtesy. Stev0's
&gt; t-shirts are another good example of a sucessful project. A few
&gt; posts to let people know the status of the project.
 
Ah, so that's your real problem. Well, here's an interesting angle:
the Tarot-project does indeed take up a little more bandwidth since
people on gaffa/love-hounds need to state their ideas, and be able
to discuss them publicly. I think that should be possible, since
the project is indeed a little more complicated. That should not
make it impossible to fulfill.
 
&gt; Why don't those interested just get together via e-mail rather
&gt; than cluttering up Love-Hounds with material that is of little
&gt; interest to most, and deeply offensive to some of us.
 
"Deeply offensive" no less. Well, if you feel that way, let's get
"suspended-because-of-tarot-cards" in order ASAP.

&gt; Manteau writes:
&gt; &gt; You people drive me nuts with bickerening!  Karen your so
&gt; &gt; stupid you think Chris is kidding.  I think he is now serious
&gt; &gt; because he is all times serious and thinks every Love Hounds
&gt; &gt; should do what he says.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;argh&gt; Look, Karen's post pissed me off, but I deleted it quick
&gt; so I wouldn't be tempted to answer. I can't ignore this on
&gt; though. Take your sarcasm and stick it in your AOL folder. Chris
&gt; does *not* think "every Love Hound should do what he says" and I
&gt; don't particularly like your portrayal of him in that way. Chris
&gt; gave his *opinion* and presented it to the group.
 
Chris still has the problem of presenting his opinions as mere
"facts of life" and in the style of my elementary school teacher:
"Look, 1 plus 1 is 3 because I say so".
 
&gt; He has a right to do that, you know. His opinion is as valid as
&gt; anyone else's, and certainly as valid as the Tarot folks.
                     ^^^^^^^^^
The implications of this word in this sentence are deeply offensive
to me, and it's the bottom line when it comes to this subject. I am
not taking this personally as I'm not one of the Tarot "folks", but
it's another fine example of the mindboggling use of demeaning
language on this list at times.
I have said it before, and I will keep on repeating it as long as
necessary: a little more acceptance of each other as human
individuals on this list is much needed. And I won't draw any
further conclusions although I must admit it's tempting to write
on.
 
Disappointedly yours,
