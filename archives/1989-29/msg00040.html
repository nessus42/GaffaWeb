SUBJECT: Jessica's 12" singles                                        

	Jessica reported picking up some "lp-single sort of things" 
at Bleeker Bob's in the city the other day and didn't quite know 
what she had.  Treasure, I'd say.  Vinyl is on the way out, and 
it's worth recalling the multi-dimensional fun of tracking KB 
releases in 'the old days' of  Hounds of Love.

	Aside:  anybody else remember seeing the July or August 
1985 Schwann catalog with its pre-release listing for Hounds of 
Love as "Spinning Pups"?  I have taken to calling the additional 
songs released only on the singles "Spinning Pups" ever since.

	Anyway:  the game as she used to be played involved a pre-
album-release single, with a B side that would not appear on the 
album, and then several singles during the months that the album 
was alive and moving, again with new songs not otherwise 
obtainable.  The singles would appear in both 7" and 12" versions, 
with the 12" often offering an extended remix for dance play 
(hence the dropping out of certain lyrics, as several have noted). 

	Jessica doesn't mention whether her 12" singles were 33s or 
45s.  The UK versions of the 12" singles were 45s, and often had 
spectacular sound because of the higher speed.  I know "Hill" was 
released in a US 33rpm 12" single, but I am not sure of the others 
since I was collecting the British versions on grounds of 
production quality.

	In any case, here is the lot of the "Spinning Pups":

"Running Up That Hill," b/w "Under the Ivy".  7" is EMI KB 1.  The 
12" (EMI 12KB 1) is an extended dance version on A, an 
instrumental version on B, with "Ivy" closing the side.  Jessica 
has described the back art of the 12" ("- if I only could - I'd be 
running up that Hill -" written on Kate's bare back); the 7" has 
Kate as archer drawing the bowstring against her lips.

"Cloudbusting" was KB 2 (7")/12KB 2 (12"), b/w "Burning Bridge" 
and, on the 12" only, "My Lagan Love."  The jacket art was the 
same on both:  Kate as Peter at the Cloudbuster on the front, 
clouds and sky on the back, except the 12" included an inset photo 
of Kate from the video sessions.  The 12" version, extended, is 
called "The Organon Remix."  Kate acknowledged in correspondence 
that this was a spelling error on her part, since Reich's ranch in 
Maine was called "Orgonon," based on "Orgone" energy, with an o.

"Hounds of Love" is one of the most important of the single 
releases, because the 12" (12KB 3) presented "Alternative Hounds 
of Love," an early sketch of the song that goes in a different 
direction than the final version, and has become my favorite.  KB 
3, the 7", is b/w "The Handsome Cabin Boy," and the 12" adds "Jig 
of Life" from the album.  Cover art is a striking half face of 
Kate, left, with a dramatic sunset in the background, black and 
white but printed in a rich black/violet.

"The Big Sky" was a complicated release.  The main thing here is 
the mighty song, "Not This Time"--a major, major song--that was 
the B side.  In 7" I never saw KB 4 itself; instead I have KBP 4B, 
a picture disk with Kate, head in hands, on the front, and a 
piled-hair shot on the rear.  The 12" (12KB 4) has a small shot 
from the video on the front (Kate with binoculars on a chimney), a 
second on the back (Kate, flags, surging light, a battlefield 
romp).  The 12" version is called "MeTkeorological Mix," with the 
capital T made into a TK, and features Kate's whole family in 
various vaporous observations along the way.  "The Morning Fog" 
closes the B side of the 12".

	I assume Jessica did great to find ANY of this stuff still 
around today, and I paid nearly $8 for them in 1985-86 originally. 
It is worth checking whether they are US or UK releases.  I think 
that only "Hill" and "Cloudbusting" were US 12" singles, but I am 
not sure.  Once I realized that EMI America was lame, I stopped 
paying attention.
