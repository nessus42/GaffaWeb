Today KITS had a really tough "What's The Connection".  In fact,
nobody got it right.  Last time I told you about this game, 
"Cloudbusting" was played, and the answer was "rain".  That was easy.
This one was much tougher.

Here were the three songs played:

R.E.M. -- "Orange Crush"
The Bollock Brothers -- "Harley David -- Son of a Bitch"
Kate Bush -- "Running Up That Hill"

So, what's the connection between these songs?
Answer on the next page.




























Answer: Nicknames of NFL defensive teams.

First of all, the Orange Crush is the Denver Broncos' def. team.

Harley Davidsons are known as "Hogs" to people into motorcycles, and
the Hogs are the Washington Redskins def. team.

And finally (and the one you've been waiting for), "Running Up That Hill"
was on the album _Hounds Of Love_.  Hounds are dogs, and the Dogs are the
Cleveland Browns def. team.

Yes, the DJ said all this in perfect seriousness.
