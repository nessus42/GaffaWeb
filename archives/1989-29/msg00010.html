Hello!

A week or so ago, I was browsing through the rec.music groups
and found rec.music.gaffa . I said to myself, "Self, what's gaffa?"
Not getting an answer, I read.  I was curious that any one performer
( Kate Bush ) could evoke such a response.  I was further surprised by
the fact that I had never heard of her ( forgive me. Between working
full time and taking an MSCS at night, I've pretty much been living
in a large Lucite cube for the last couple of years ).

Well, to make a long story short; last night I bought the tape of 
_The_Sensual_World_ .  Wow ! No wonder you all seem to be totally 
enraptured by her! I'm not usually this impressed by an artist, but
this lady is fantastic! 

I'm obviously still new to this genre so I have a few questions that
I hope some one will answer for me.  First, what does "gaffa" mean?
Is that the name of the genre?  What kind of sound or song content is
considered to be typical of the genre? What criteria ( broad though
they may be ) are used to say a piece of music is or is not part of
the genre? I have seen mention here of a few other artists who are
apparently considered exponents of this genre ( e.g. Laurie Anderson, of
whom I have heard; and like ). Who are some of the others?  What type
of radio station would be likely to play this music ( rock, new-age,
etc.) ?  And does anyone know of one in the San Diego area ?

I could probably ask more questions, but I don't yet know enough about
all this to even think of what to ask.  Any info will be greatly
appreciated.  Since I assume that most of the readers here are
familiar with all of this, please e-mail any answers to me so we don't
bore anyone.  My e-mail address is:  wlp@calmasd.Prime.COM


Well, I got to go.  I have to go to the record store to look for more 
Kate Bush albums !

Thanks in advance for the answers to my silly new-commer questions.
