&gt;        I went to my local rental/second-hand CD joint and I went straight
&gt;        for the 'Bush, Kate' category of course.
&gt;        Some weird shit like the 'Red Socks' TKI and some Japanese disks. 

   That's the US one.

&gt;        But I saw two weird CDs. One was called 'Mystic Lady' and looked
&gt;        like a bootleg except it had the 'Novercia' label. Seemed like
&gt;        a compilation. But it looked cheap. It only had a single colour
&gt;        slip, no lyrics booklet. Sorry don't want it.

   Absolutely a boot. There is no "Novercia" label.

&gt;        The second one was more interesting. It was called 'This Woman's
&gt;        Work' which I thought was a massively expensive box set.
&gt;
&gt;        Anyway it contained some B-Sides and stuff I have never heard of.
&gt;        Some info perchance from the cognescenti? I wanted to get it
&gt;        but it was tatty (ripped booklet and slight CD scratches) and
&gt;        the prick behind the counter wanted AU$30 because it was
&gt;        'out of print'.

   $30 AUS is a *very* reasonable price for the box set, and hardly makes 
the person behind the counter a "prick". Now, if it was just one of the
CDs from the set, or a boot of one of them, then yes it is a bit of a rip-off.
But not much more of a rip-off then every boot out there.  

&gt;        Can I get it overseas say from the UK?

   Yeah...for $150 US.

&gt;        I have all the regular CDs what else should I get? (I have TKI, LH,
&gt;        NfE, HoL, TD, TSW, TRS). What else can I get so that I don't fret
&gt;        about her new album next year?

   Yeah...next year (cough! cough!)

&gt;        Anyway, your thoughts?

   Buy whatever Kate rarities you can right now.  The price of Kate 
stuff falls during the long period between albums, and rises preceeding
the release date.
