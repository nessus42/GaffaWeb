&gt;I really tried to be open minded about the whole Tori/Kate thing.
&gt;I went to a Tori concert and was really surprised at how rude
&gt;Tori was to the audience.  She stopped the show several times
&gt;complaining that she could hear beer bottles being kicked around
&gt;on the floor.  She also stopped the show when she thought people
&gt;were talking too loud?
&gt;
&gt;Get a grip woman!  If you play in a bar, you need to accept that
&gt;atmosphere.  It's not the same venue that the symphony plays.
&gt;
&gt;I really felt that I paid money to perform for her.  I had to show
&gt;how I could sit still and be quiet for her.  And if I was lucky,
&gt;she might acknowledge my presence.
&gt;
&gt;LR

In terms of my 3 cents worth, I have had the pleasure in attending 2 Tori
concerts this year and I found them both to be very good.  In the audiance,
I saw from children to woman/men old enough to be my
greatgrandmother/father....all enjoying the show.  

Mostly, she was playful but not disrespectful....altho both of the venues I
attended were at a theatre house and a convention center.  I actually gained
a better respect for the girl.  She put big efforts in trying to interact
with her audiance.  

I was ready to throw all my Tori albums away....very disappointed at her
latest album.  After going and seeing her live I better understood her point
at the newer songs.  Spent most the concert dancing in my seat.

I also got to meet Tori a couple times and her parents walked up to my
friend and I, for whatever reason.  Tori seemed like a nice girl...very
sweet and very American in her ways of affection.  Her parents were very
polite and cared to share a chat and a smile.  

The only negative point of all the Tori venue experiences was during the
convert that her family was there.....she laid out this most horendous
primal scream....people applaused this...I was very uncomfortable in the
fact that I forgot to bring my ear plugs.....really if I wanted to hear
aniaml screams, I'd've rather gone to the zoo.  

NTL, a fan at the concert explained it to me....as her way of stress
relieving from the pressures of having poeple there that know all of her
"secrets" sitting almost front row scrutinizing her every gesture. I
guess....besides that...she executed her songs in a knowledged perfection
and she on several occasions proved to impress upon me that she could do
more than just hit a prefect note.

I got in a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said,
"I'm going to mop the floor with your face." I said, "You'll be
sorry." He said, "Oh, yeah? Why?" I said, "Well, you won't be
able to get into the corners very well."
