<PRE>
Paddy was there performing material from his forthcoming album
"Skyscraping" with Colin Lloyd-Tucker (also making an appearance)
under the name "Bushtucker" (like it!), Del was there auctioning
collectibles with Dave (a one-off signed CD-R of the album went for
600 pounds!), and of course Kate was there, but not for long, only to
introduce the film and pick the gold disc raffle winner a second time
(it wasn't deliberate that the first one picked was invalid, was it? 8-)

The fans' performances ranged from an acoustic guitar adaptation of
RutH (believe me!) to an almost a capella Big Sky with a two-chord
electric guitar accompanyment by "Loney Planet", to an excellent
Wuthering Heights by "Rare Flowers".  The aircraft-carrier-style
elevator built into the stage was used extensively.

The "Sexual Healing" track Andy mentions is from a forthcoming Davey
Spillane album - yes, there were Uillean pipe in the arrangement! The
new US dance mix of Rubberband girl was brought along by Kate herself
on a DAT, apparently. Anybody still around when it was played?

Despite at least four different Love-Hounds quiz teams, including a
A-team of IED, Doug, Chris and Uli, the quiz was won by The Norfolk
Alchemists team again.

After going out to a nearby Chinese after the showing of TLTCTC (the
video projector wasn't brilliant, but few are, I think), those of us
who didn't have tubes or buses to catch returned, waving tickets at
shouts of "You can't go in there, it's a private party", around 10:30
and spent some time with Peter before the Hippodrome shut up shop for
the night. IED and I also met one of the Alchemists, who showed us
her prize shoebox.

And I still haven't mentioned the freebie free-for-alls (ouch!), the
new poster, the ticket poll video top 20, the US Rubberband Girl
video, The Pink Mules...

All proceeds and profits were donated at Kate's request to Great Ormond
Street Hospital in London.

Thanks to IED for the nametags and Chris for the rubberbands!

PS. Craig: you didn't miss Kate when you were getting your Skyscraping
CD, did you?
