Hi,

&gt; &gt; As for Jorn, he didn't even answer me when I publicly distanced

&gt;
&gt; Marcel, to be truthful, I didn't feel that your postings revealed
&gt; either the strength of character or the knowledge of english to
 
Thanks for both compliments... (And BTW you're wrong on both

&gt; be capable of that task, which would have required careful
&gt; reading of dozens of old postings. That you can reach the
&gt; dismissive judgment above, despite the extensive quoted evidence
&gt; I posted, confirms my intuitive judgment.
 
That's because I didn't read the "extensive quoted evidence". I
have a policy to delete things that are unasked for and shoved into
my account and my wallet, _as I explained in my previous post_.
I just skipped to the first "&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;" that came along. (I love &lt;F2&gt; in
WP)
 
&gt; I WILL DROP MY FIGHT FOR JUSTICE, IF OTHERS WILL DROP THEIR
&gt; ATTACKS.
 
Good, that's settled then. We look forward to your next post, which
will contain some interesting Kate-related stuff.

&gt; "I figured you might disagree with me, so I ignored you."
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have to strongly protest, again, the assumption that *others*
&gt; &gt; are allowed to flame me extensively on this topic, after I've
&gt; &gt; laid forth an offer to Chris and Vickie of a mutual ceasefire,
&gt; &gt; *which they have not responded to*.  When I call this group
&gt; &gt; totalitarian, this sort of one-sidedness is exactly what I
&gt; &gt; referred to.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't want people to flame you for taking a big smelly
&gt; dump, don't do it in the middle of a public park.
 
Okay, I have two words for Lazlo Nibble: SHUT UP. Jorn dropped the
issue, you do the same. Now. Everyone.
 
That includes everyone.
