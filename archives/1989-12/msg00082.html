&gt;Comments are requested on the CD-boot "Kate Bush Live At Hammersmith", which
&gt;appears to contain the audio track from the concert video plus three bonus
&gt;tracks (RUtH, This Woman's Work, and one other if I remember right).  Is
&gt;the sound dubbed off the new digital-remastered laserdisc of the Hammersmith
&gt;video?  $39 or so seems to be the asking price, and I *did* like the music
&gt;of the concert video, so if the sound is a clear and solid I will probably
&gt;pick it up . . . but should I?

I think you already know how I feel about knowingly buying a bootleg,
so I'll leave that issue alone.

My question is, is this a bootleg?  I have what appears to be a
legitimate import edition of this CD.  It claims to be from "Neutral
Zone, Digital Recordings, 140 Rue de Rennes, 75006 Paris France".  The
identifying mark on the spine and on the disk is "NZCD 89010".  It has
the usual "Compact Disc Digital Audio" logo that seems to appear on
almost all compact discs, as well as an AAD marking and a notice that
"All rights of the producer and of the owner of the work reproduced
reserved.  Unauthorized copying, hiring, lending, public performance
and broadcasting of this record prohibited."  The insert and back cover
contain high quality graphics, specifically pictures of KT, which
appear to have been reproduced from negatives.  There is not a hint of
amateurism or knock-off about the whole package.  I haven't seen any
other CD bootlegs, but the LP bootlegs I've seen were generally pretty
shoddy in packaging and bore no traceable identifying marks.

I believe this is a legitimate CD edition of the old "Kate Bush Live"
LP, with three bonus tracks.  They are, as mentioned, live 1988
recordings of "Running Up That Hill" and "Breathing", and a 1988
studio version of "This Woman's Work".

If there is a bootleg edition, it is probably a knock-off of this.  On
this edition, the sound is quite clear throughout.  I don't know what
quality it would have on a bootleg.  And finally, I purchased this
record from Marin Compact Disc in San Anselmo, a store which
specializes in import CDs, and which does not stock anything that looks
like bootlegs to me.  The price was thirty dollars, I believe.
