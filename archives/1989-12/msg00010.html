 To: Love-Hounds
 From: IED
 Subject: update of tape list; suggestion for a L-Hs Katemas present

    94. Henry T. Young    $ 6.50
 95/97. Bill Sommers      $19.50 (x3)
 98/99. Tom Le Mense      $13.00 (x2)

   101. Stephen Martin    $10.00
   102. Mark Anderson     $ 8.00
   103. Steven Zwanger    $00.00 (next time read the directions, ok Steve?)

Katemas
^^^^^^^
     Tracy has asked what Love-Hounds did for Katemas last year.
IED can't remember whether this was done last year or the year before
(IED has celebrated so many Katemases they're all a little blurry). It
was pretty much the only thing L-Hs has ever sent to Kate as a group.
(Individuals have sent her things, however, and she has been given
access to some printouts of old Love-Hounds Digests.)
     It was a Katemas card, sent by IED to Kate and bearing (in the
form of many individual labels with the signatures of the senders)
the signatures of a large group of Love-Hounds (about forty or so,
as IED recalls). Naturally there was no reply from Kate, who has
pretty drastically curtailed answering such things since the number of
gifts and cards reached into the three-trillion-per-year range about
nine years ago, but IED is confident that she saw it, and that it
registered.
     This year, however, IED has a different idea. He has had a talk
with the tape duplication service, and it looks like there will be
a reduction by 50 cents of the rate per copy (i.e., the rate will
probably be $6.00 per tape, rather than $6.50). Now, IED will be
happy to return the extra 50 cents to anyone who requests it, but
he would like at least to _suggest_ an alternative use of the money:
what if (partly as a token of the Love-Hounds' affection and partly
to assuage some of our collective guilt over this tape business) IED were
to use the extra money to arrange to have sent to Kate: a.) a bouquet
of white roses (perhaps wrapped in ivy?) via cable; or b.) a large
box of chocolates? No specific reference would have to be made to
the tape business (why dredge up unpleasant memories a second time?),
perhaps just a very simple note to let her know that the KompuTerized
KonTingent of the Lionhearts are thinking of her this Katemas?
