 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: Mainly _Watching_You_Without_Me_ secrets

     Thanks to Jennifer for noticing the errors in the lyrics-server
files for _Be_Kind_to_My_Mistakes_. IED wishes someone would dump all
the Kate Bush lyrics in the server and replace them with IED's own
far more accurate and complete file. IED is unable to do this himself,
but will gladly e-mail his file to anyone who can make the switch for    s:
him.                                                                     US

     Mark Anderson writes:
 &gt; I thought they were less "secret" than "difficult to hear".
 &gt; In fact, I've been listening very closely to this song this week (_The
 &gt; Ninth_Wave_ is truly a work of genius!) in order to verify just what it
 &gt; is I believe she's saying, and I noticed just at the very beginning of
 &gt; this song I can hear very faint voices in the background for a second
 &gt; or two...  Could these be the "secret messages" you mean?

  No. But Mark's points are all well taken and interesting, and they're
gratifying ones for IED since they are in agreement with his own!
     About "secret messages" in _Watching_You_Without_Me_, Mark:
IED doesn't doubt that you've been listening carefully to the recording:
the fact that you noticed the very low-level conversation at the very
beginning of the track proves this. But there are still a few more that
you apparently haven't caught yet. The most famous one is even the
subject of a now-very-old Kate Bush Club competition (begun in 1986, and
still not officially solved by anyone). But there are several other secret
messages in the recording, as well. Perhaps the best way to show readers
where these are is to re-post IED's "complete" version of the lyrics. Try
listening to the song while reading this version. And please be under-
standing about the still-unsolved gaps--perhaps you have suggestions?

# _Notes_on_the_above_lyrics_
#
#          #++--"It's _four_...five...six...seven...": Evidently an
#          exchange between two of the instrumental musicians on the
#          track. The first speaker ("What's that?) is asking for the
#          beat count, and the second is tapping it out for him. This
#          may be authentic studio chat, or an artful reconstruction.
#
          [*--"Don't  ignore,  don't  ignore  me...":    This "mystery
          message" immediately follows the Morse code "S.O.S." signal.
          Still undeciphered as of October, 1988, the message  is  the
          subject  of  a  continuing  Kate  Bush Club competition. The
          message is a sentence, twelve words long, beginning with the
          word  "Don't".  Backwards,   it   sounds   something   like:
          "Zwoh-nikh-noh,  zwoh-nikh-noh  nee, et-nee nong-widz-aw nee
          noy." The translation  in  the  lyrics  above  is  only  the
          editor's guess. It is not even known for certain whether the
          message is forward- or backward-directional.]

          [**--"Listen  to  me,  baby...",  etc.:  The  words  in this
          passage, and in one which follows  later  in  the  song  are
          broken  up--fractured--by some sound-treatment process known
          only to Kate.  Similar to passages from  Waking  the  Witch,
          these  lines  seem  to  contain  different words when played
          backwards. Respectively, these are: "I was here before,  you
          talked to me, you said that you didn't think it was too late
          to  help  me..."; and "Talk to me, listen to me, talk to me,
          talk to me, baby..." These words  apparently  were  recorded
          within    the    momentary   gaps   which   break   up   the
#          forward-directional recording, and like a number of other
#          important lines in the song (though possibly _not_ the
#          "competition" section), they can only be understood when
#          the recording is played backwards.
