THE HISTORY OF THE ENID
--- ------- -- --- ----

The Enid was founded in 1974 by Robert John Godfrey and Stephen Stewart
together with another musician who left the band many years ago.

Robert is the son of a farmer and he was born on the Leeds Castle estate
in Kent, England on 30th July 1947.  After a somewhat difficult early
life he settled on the idea that music would be his life.  In 1964 he
entered the Royal College of Music where he studied first with the leg-
endary Arthur Alexander and later with the celebrated British concert
pianist Malcolm Binns.

In the late 60s he became disenchanted with the prospect of a traditional
career in music and left his studies uncompleted.  In 1969 he left London
for the north of England to join the now well known rock band "Barclay
James Harvest". Robert developed the orchestral aspect of the music and
co-wrote much of the music for which BJH have become so famous.  He re-
mained in this position until 1971.

At the end of 1972 Robert recorded an album for the Charisma label en-
titled "The Fall of Hyperion".  The relationship with Charisma did not
flourish.  In 1973 he became friends with Steve Stewart and decided to
start again.

Steve was born on Christmas Day in South London.  He started his musical
life by playing the violin and it was only later that he changed to
guitar.  His musical experience has been largely acquired during his
years with The Enid though he led a very active musical life in an 
amateur sense before 1974.  Steve is responsible for all the technical
aspects of running The Lodge Recording Studio which he designed and
built.  As well as being in overall charge of production for all record-
ings by The Enid, he is the chief engineer on such famous recordings as
"Kids in America" by Kim Wilde.

The band's debut album "In the Region of the Summer Stars" was released
in January 1976 on an independant record label distributed through EMI.
The album received critical acclaim and the group toured extensively
in Great Britain.

1976 however, marked the beginning of the "punk revolution" in the UK.
The Enid were quick to recognise the value of this new upsurge in 
youthful music because it provided the vital antidote to the jaded and
stagnant state of contemporary music leading up to that time.  But
though The Enid were a radical band and still are, the individualistic
way in which they sought to contribute to the musical world was contrary
to the current trend and they were forced out on a limb.  They 'could
not' and 'would not' change their image or their music to suit the pre-
vailing reversion to basics.  Instead they continued to press on with
their course.

It wasn't until 1978 that a new album appeared titled "Aerie Faerie
Nonsense".  The intervening years had seen management upheavals and 
changes as well as internal trouble within the band.  All in all, it 
had been an enormous struggle to keep afloat during those early years;
years which were vital to the artistic development of the band.

In early 1979 The Enid signed a recording contract with Lord Grade's
record company, Pye Records, amid much ceremony.  Two albums were re-
recorded - Touch Me (1979) and Six Pieces (1980).  Unfortunately the
senior executives at Pye, who ahd taken so much interest in The Enid in
the first instance, left for greener pastures.  It soon became clear that
Lord Grade's empire was in trouble and the axe was about to fall on Pye
Records and vicariously onto The Enid.  In a paranoid public outburst
directed at Lord Grade; Robert John Godfrey summed up his feeling of rage
and his sense of neglect:-

"By now, we are all aware that The Enid is fraught with problems and 
obstacles to our continuance.  The Forces of War are gathering and they
beat against our door in yet another attempt to overwhelm us.  The aim
is to break the spirit of a group of people whose ideals are like the 
stars which guide mariners.  Their methods are those of the exclusive
self-seeker, who only likes what he knows, and who would kill the spice
of life by drowning it in a sea of mediocrity. Those who spit upon The
Enid and people like them, spit upon all people whose aspirations look
towards a full and abundant life for all mankind.  They spit upon the 
unborn child, and condemn their children and their children's children
to the Pit.  Like Cain and all those who bear his mark, The Enid shall
dwell in the Land of Nod forever."

It was this direct experience which Robert John Godrey and Steve Stewart
came to understand as the "commercial realities of the music business".
The Enid had arrived at a watershed.  When their relationship with their
record company disintegrated, their world collapsed around them -
Domestically, artistically, emotionally and even spiritually - for whilst
it is true that to have done one's best is as much as anyone can do, the
consequences of human frailty must nevertheless be faced.  Here follows
an extract from Robert John Godfrey's own account of how things were.

"Our domestic situation at the band's communal home in Hertfordshire
became disjointed and bizarre.  What had been an essentially stable comm-
unity; able to accomodate all the idiosyncrasies of life suddenly became
destroyed.  People's individual relationships broke down.  A kind of
mini holcaust of self-righteous behaviour ripped through the rooms and
passage ways of Beanside Lodge like some demented demon.  The battle for
the middle ground held by Stephen Stewart and Chris North, the band's 
drummer, was one of the most vexing experiences I personally have ever
borne.  It would be cruel and mean to elaborate or dwell upon the per-
sonal circumstances relating to each of us."

"After a long period of desperate unhappiness for us all, the band broke
up.  I personally thought that we would never venture out again.  I had
the stark vision of loneliness and despair confronting me."

"In hindsight these things are never as bad as they seem at the time.
Being able to speak from personal experience, I feel pretty sure that
bereavement and divorce fall into this category.  I now realise that the
"old" Enid could never have gone forward, and that what happened was
essentially necessary."

"A gardener might consider such a position as one which needed pruning
in order to promote the new growth in Spring.  Neither Steve nor I harbour
any bitterness or malice towards the others, even though we know that
some of them don't feel the same way about us."

"After our move from Hertfordshire to Suffolk in 1981 we lived in the
doldrums.  Martin Russell, (our bass player) stayed with us for a little 
while and eventually Chris North left as well.  Most of this time was
spent developing The Lodge Studio, now well known for its work in the 
field of pop."

"In the Spring of 1982 I became ill.  The form of illness was subtle and
not easily defined by medicine.  I was admitted to the coronary care unit
in Bury St.Edmunds with severe chest pains and a very irregular heart beat.
I spent four weeks in this hospital thinking that I was recovering from
a heart attack and that my life for all intents and purposes was over.
Filled with self-pity, I made everyone's life around me a complete misery.
This period of my life I call 'The vile period'.  I even wondered if my
life was worth continuing because the purpose of it seemed to have withered
away.  I lost my faith in God - I must have been to the edge and looked 
over."

"As it turned out, the medical profession were uncertain as to whether I
had in fact had a heart attack and they therefore decided that further
investigations should be made.  In the late summer I went into Papworth
Hospital where I was discovered to be completely fit in all manners rel-
ating to cardiology.  It was suggested that I see a psychiatrist.  I took
this advice which though helpful did not amount to much.  The real reason
behind my illness lay in something more profound.  I had cut myself off
from my destiny and repudiated my vocation.  Of course I found no purpose 
in my life.  The Enid weren't recording.  The band weren't gigging and
worst of all, I wasn't composing any more.  In October 1982 we decided to 
burn our boats."

And so it was that the band's recording studio was closed down and the
first contemporary album "Something Wicked This Way Comes", was produced
and released on The Enid label.  Robert Godfrey and Steve Stewart had
decided to take the independant route, a decision which they have never
regretted and never looked back from.  The gloom laden years of misery
and disappointment became overtaken by a new and more mature optimism.
During 1983 they toured the whole of Great Britain playing 156 shows in 
the one year, including a show stopping performance at the last Reading
Festival which earned them a standing ovation.  With a solid base under 
them, The Enid re-released their back catalogue on their own label and 
began working on their next LP.  In July 1984, King Records in Japan
arranged a licence with The Enid to manufacture the whole catalogue in
Japan.  The new double album, "The Spell", was released in the October 
of that year.  1985 saw the release of a new, revised and substantially
longer version of "Fand".

In March 1986 the band released a strange new album titled "Salome".  It
is a new vision of the story relating to that fateful night when King 
Herod finds himself tricked into killing John the Baptist.

SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES
--------- ------ ---- --- -----

A personal view by Robert John Godfrey

The subject of "Something Wicked This Way Comes" is perhaps the most 
pressing issue facing mankind.  Nuclear weapons have now presented
humanity with the means to destroy the planet.  Hitherto this could have
only been accomplished by the great being who created it.

However, we do not believe it is the artist's place to take up an overtly
political stance.  In any event most artists appear to be politically
naive.

Ambiguity is the great instrument which the composer has at his disposal.
Ambiguity stirs people's hearts and is capable of kindling the flame which 
enlightens our inner selves.  Music at its best is a spiritual language
which communicates directly with the soul.  It bypasses all other lang-
uages, races, creeds and opinions.  One thing which humanity can reason-
ably expect to share with life elsewhere in the universe is music.

"Something Wicked This Way Comes" is a poetic look at the tragedy of a
nuclear holocaust.  To dis-invent the technology which has produced
nuclear weapons is not a possibility and disarmament always leaves the
possibility of rearmament.

Mankind is having to face up to its longterm responsibilities.  The world
is a child in the process of growing painfully to manhood.  If we think
about it hard enough and stop being like the proverbial ostrich, we have
a good chance to learn to live with the monster we have produced.

Maybe our world is like a person where there is a beast inside.  We cannot
cut the beast away - rather we may learn to make friends with our darker 
self and learn to love every aspect of our nature.  If we choose to do 
that we will discover the purpose of our creator - whose by-word is Love.

I hope that this has been of interest.  If any further information is
