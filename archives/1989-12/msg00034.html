 To: Love-Hounds
 From: IED
 Subject: California Bush bash; update on Tape list and Katemas present

     First, Tracy suggested that perhaps Love-Hounds on the West
Coast could throw a Bush bash of their own this Katemas. IED is
willing, although he must add that he went to some trouble twice
before to host Katemas parties for Western L-Hs, with pitiful results.
But he notices a number of new additions to the pack since then, and
is therefore ready to try once more. Before he lifts a finger, however,
could _all_ Love-Hounds who would _really_ be interested in _truly_
showing up at a West Los Angeles Katemas party _please_ indicate
as much, either in Love-Hounds or in e-mail to IED? Thanks. IED
will prepare himself for an onslaught of hungry and thirsty Kate
fans on July 30 (a Sunday this year, no?), and will provide much
relevant video and audio entertainment IF and only if enough people
respond with interest to the idea. If only a few people seem genuinely
excited by the idea, then perhaps just a simple get-together would
be more in order.
     Now, here is the latest update of the tape projeKT list:

        Scot Allen        $ 6.50
        Antony Meadley    $ 6.50
        John Turnley      $ 8.00
        Rob Bieling       $10.00
        Stephan Greene    $ 6.50
        John McLachlan    $ 6.50
        Craig Heath       $10.00
        Colin Selleck     $ 6.50
        Michael Pritchard $ 6.50
        Dan Kozak         $ 8.00
        Bob Thaden        $ 6.50 (+ blank)
        Liz(oo) Owens     $10.00
        Julian Gomez      $ 8.50
        Mats Lifkvist     $10.00
        Serge Malev       $15.00
        Hagit Attiya      $ 8.00
        Michael Dyre      $ 6.50
        Robert Kelner     $ 8.50
        Willard Robinson  $ 6.50

     The lists posted to date include, cumulatively, all orders
received by IED as of June 30, Friday afternoon's postal delivery.
Tomorrow (Saturday, July 1) and Monday (July 3) will be the _last_
days IED will accept orders, so if you haven't sent them in yet,
_don't_bother_to_send_them_in_now!_ And don't worry yet if you're
too late for this project--in another ten days or so there _may_ be
more than 100 Love-Hounds in possession of a copy of _obsK_2_, and
it is not impossible that some of them might be prevailed upon to make
the odd copy as a favor to latecoming Love-Hounds, no?
     Finally, IED has determined that a bouquet of one dozen white
roses with ivy intertwined and a card listing all 120-odd names
can be delivered to East Wickham Farm, but the cost is (gulp!) $85.00!
The rate is $50.00 per dozen roses, with a $20.00 service and cable
fee, plus another $10.00 for the extra-long list of names (which
should be done over the phone, by hand if we want it done right).
     Now the excess $$ of the money sent in by people ordering copies
of the tape will probably not come to more than $65.00, (@ $00.50 per
person), but a number of you have very kindly said that the additional
money you sent in (above and beyond the $6.50 asked for by IED) may
be spent at IED's discretion. If any of you object to IED's plan to
use the excess to pay for more roses, will you please say so as soon
as possible so that an alternative plan can be agreed upon? Thanks.
     Needless to say, all of these plans will be cancelled if IED decides
against going ahead with the tape project after all. We'll all
just have to wait and see what decision IED's warped notions of right
and wrong lead him to make. Perhaps no-one will know for sure until
a copy of the tape (or a refund of the money) is found in each person's
mailbox, say about a week from Monday...
