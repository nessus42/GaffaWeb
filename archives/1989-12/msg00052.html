&gt;The import (from UK) CD's of Kate Bush are mastered ADD instead of the US
&gt;domestic AAD...

Alas, my _Never_for_Ever_ CD, an imported UK disc manufactured in West
Germany, is AAD -- just like the domestic version!  At least it has the
lyrics included.  By some stroke of good fortune I found it at a local
record shop buried among EMI Manhatten/America/Treasury Series discs.
I was under the impression that all of Kate's CDs were AAD.

In &lt;8907041919.AA11220@GAFFA.MIT.EDU&gt;, IED writes:
&gt;as well as one or two interesting (though not, perhaps, entirely
&gt;convincing) points about the secret messages in _WYW/oMe_.

Secret messages?  Which secret message are you referring to, I wonder?
If you mean the muddy-whispery messages Kate sings/speaks throughout
the song, I thought they were less "secret" than "difficult to hear".

In fact, I've been listening very closely to this song this week (_The
Ninth_Wave_ is truly a work of genius!) in order to verify just what it
is I believe she's saying, and I noticed just at the very beginning of
this song I can hear very faint voices in the background for a second or
two...  Could these be the "secret messages" you mean?

Again, I apologise if this has been discssed to death in the past. Until
September (only 2 months away!), there won't be a lot of _new_ material
for neophyte Love-Hounds to discuss on the net! 

Unless, of course, you're interested in:

&gt;Therefore, it's very interesting that Doug notices a theme of
&gt;hopelessness running through Kate's work.
[...]
&gt;It's a puzzle, but IED would just
&gt;like to remind everyone that Kate is _not_ writing autobiographically
&gt;in these songs.
[...]
&gt;Kate tends to take on the
&gt;personalities and to share the attitudes and opinions of the characters
&gt;who narrate the various songs she composes.

This is very true, and one of the most striking things about Kate's
work is the variety of different points of view she takes in her songs.
While it's true that a theme of helplessness or powerlessness can be
found in many songs (another example is _Suspended_in_Gaffa_).  However,
I think this is just a result of particular characters' situations *in
those songs*.

Just the opposite theme can be found in, for example, _Leave_It_Open_.
And the protagonist of _Babooshka_ is anything but a victim of fate.
Is she?  Well... maybe I'd better give this some more thought. :-)
