&gt; Earlier there was a posting of a play list of that Kansas City show that
&gt; I'm jealous we don't get here, and these songs were amoung those listed:
&gt;
&gt; New York Social Life, _New Music for the Elect..._, Laurie Anderson
&gt;
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt; Coolsville, _Strange Angels_ , Laurie Anderson
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have never heard of these songs or albums.  What have I been missing?

The first song, "New York Social Life," also appears on her five-record set
"United States I - IV" (speaking of which, *WHEN* is this going to be
released on CD?). I believe that the album listed above was a compilation
of works by various electronic artists (was this the album that also had
William S. Burroughs on it, as well as Laurie's frantic little ditty, "Dr.
Dunton" [forgive me if I screwed up the doctor's name in the title; my
brain *just* lost its pointer to that particular string :-( ]? Good stuff).

As for "Coolsville," it is a song from her latest album, which is evidently
titled "Strange Angels," *not*, as I had earlier reported, "Enormous Night"
(and *really* not, as I had even earlier reported, "Endless Night"!). In
either case, the album is made up of songs from her new stage work, "Empty
Places."

I have not had a chance to get this CD yet (we were only able to get Kate's
CD by grace of the mercy of Our Lady of Perpetual Credit, From Whom All
Blessings Flow, at 18% APR), so I'd like to ask someone who *does* have it
(or who caught "Coolsville" on the radio!): Does Laurie use her usual
menagerie of cohorts and backing players, or is this one essentially a solo
performance, as was the stage show?

                                        -Ray R.
