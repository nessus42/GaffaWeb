Hi guys!!

Singing it in the shower?  Boy, I don't wanna know what *you're* like in
the morning!!  :-)

&gt;Re: "[KT tune/album] sucks/is pathetic/isn't very good."
&gt;
&gt;Feh! to each and every one of you.

Hear!  Hear!  You hit the nail right on the head, as have several
others, when you bring up the point that judging TSW on the basis of
whether or not it's "better" than TD or HoL, or even Lionheart, fer
cryin' out loud, is pointless, meritless, and entirely subjective. 
Someone who cares little or not at all for TD will certainly feel that
TSW is inferior to it, while someone who thinks TD is the greatest rock
album ever made (bah-- we all know that HoL takes that spot, now don't
we? ;-)  ) will think that TSW, subsequently, isn't worth the paper its
cover was printed on.  Each album must be judged on the basis of whether
or not it achieved what it seemed to try to.  In the case of TSW, it
seemed to want to drown the listener in a Sensual (as it were), almost
aphrodisiacal (is that a word?) aural experience.  If such is the case,
then, IMHO, it is a terrific success.  (But I'll get into that later...)

**A** God?  **A**?!?!?!  Dammit, man, She IS God!!  ;-)


I sincerely hope that TSW breaks KT here in the States...  she has been
ignored in favor of mediocre talent and plastic pop music for far too
long, and it has always been a burr in my side that she could have made
it here long ago, if not for the fact that EMI-America wouldn't promote
her for sh*t.  (Pardon my language, but we *all* know it's the truth. 
Maybe now, CBS will give her the media boost she so richly deserves.


till later, then, folks!---
