 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Wow! You people are fantastic!

     First, THANKS to LARRY HERNANDEZ for throwing such a great
KATE BUSH BASH last weekend in San Jose. We missed Corey, Tom
and Tracy, certainly, but a great time was had by all who did
attend nonetheless. EXCELLENT JOB, Larry! And great champagne,
too!
     For the first time in years, IED finds he has _nothing_to_do_
on Love-Hounds! All the interviews and articles and reviews are
getting transcribed and posted by other contributors before he even
has a chance to set fingers to keys. It's a strange sensation!
     Additional heartfelt thanks are now due to Ed Suranyi (especially
for his transcription of the huge _Q_ Magazine interview--thanks also,
Ed and !&gt;oug, for warning IED in time not to tackle that one) and
to Daniel Vanevic (for his transcription of the NPR piece--once again
IED was saved from unnecessary labor in the nick of time--he had his
tape of the show, with Walkman and headphones at the ready, even as
he discovered Dan's transcription!).
     Dare IED hope that Steve Wallis will be inspired enough by IED's
repeated declarations of thanks and admiration to post the remainder
of the Radio One interview? And could IED be getting too spoiled for
hoping that Neil Calton will actually come through with the "Rapido"
transcription? And is it too much to wish for some hitherto-silent
but excellent English Love-Hound to scout out, transcribe and post
a copy of the new KT interview expected to appear in Woolworth's
throwaway magazine "Tracks", and the heavy-metal publication called
"R.A.W."?
     For his part, IED _will_ transcribe the _Melody_Maker_ interview
(if he's fast enough to beat Ed Suranyi or any of you other industrious
Love-Hounds), as well as a brief (half-page) interview which has
appeared in the French music magazine "Best" (translated by IED).
Both will appear in Love-Hounds this week.
     As for Love-Hounds discussions over the last twelve days: IED
had intended to comb through them and post a typically detailed and
verbose reply to issues of moment, but--and this is really hard to
accept--there's just too much of it to handle! There are now more
than 9,000 lines of junk to plow through--IED feels defeated by your
collective wordiness, folks! This has taught him that he can never leave
the fold--even for a week's vacation--and expect to be able to catch
up. From here on in, IED will have to accept secondary philocanine
status, at least until he can get to feeling back in the swim of
things.
      Tower Records Sunset (Hollywood) has _TSW_ listed as their
number-9 best-selling album in the store.
      Meanwhile, however, the single has fallen _completely_off_
the Music Week/Gallup charts in England, after only four weeks.
According to _HG_, a probable reason for this is that the radio
stations gave the record only very modest airplay, despite its
initial high sales and excellent advance publicity. (There was an
exact tally of the number of plays the song received on the major
stations over the first three weeks, and the highest number at
any one station was fourteen--inexplicable!) Most of the reviews
that IED has seen so far (two or three have appeared that IED
couldn't bring himself to buy, so expensive were the import magazines
in which they appeared, so hostile was their tone) have been luke-warm
(i.e. not pans but loaded with cynicism and condescension) at best.
At least from IED's initial impression, 1989 just doesn't seem to
be turning out to be Kate's year with the European media. But we'll
see what develops over the next month or so.
     Vickie Mapes reports to IED that a phone conversation with her
CBS-Chicago contact indicated to her the distinct possibility that
CBS does not intend to release _any_ single at all! This seems
unlikely to IED, but he thought the notice should be relayed anyway,
for what it's worth.

     A MAJOR REMINDER TO ALL INTERESTED LOVE-HOUNDS:
 The huge _TSW_ poster is still available: a "subway"-size poster
(approximately 40 x 60 inches), made in the UK on nice, heavy paper.
The poster is an "official" product from EMI, not a bootleg. It
is the same poster that one Love-Hound (Jamie?) described seeing on
an Edinburgh hoarding last week: there is no writing of any kind
on the poster, only a huge blow-up, in black-and-white, of the
photograph by John Carder Bush of Kate featured on the cover of her
new UK single _The_Sensual_World_. In the photo Kate is seen in three-
quarter perspective with her hands out in front of her, and with
sand (or dust) slipping through her fingers. The ink is black, not
the sepia-black "duo-tone" color used by John Carder Bush for the
single itself, but IED has been assured that the print is first-
rate and the darks are very rich in the poster.
     For a limited time this poster will be available, on a first-
come first-serve basis, for $20.00 POST PAID (rolled in a tube the
right size for a poster of these dimensions), from:

            "Dirt Cheap" Recycled Sounds
            Anne Winter, proprietor
            3941 Main Street
            Kansas City, MO 64111
            (816) 531-4890

     The payment should be made by cashier's check or money
order. The price of $20.00 includes DOMESTIC postage only. Any
overseas Love-Hounds should inquire directly of the proprietor
for postage costs for their country.
(Anne is _very_ sorry to have to tell the Australian Love-Hound who
placed an order that she has been unable to find a way of getting
it to him for less than $27.00. Perhaps you will want to talk with
her again, or find another means of acquiring a poster.)
     Also, there is a limit of 3 copies of the poster per order!
Please don't be greedy, let other fans have a chance too.
     Finally, IED would just like to add that neither Vickie nor
any Love-Hound is receiving one cent in commission from this offer!
What happened was that Vickie just found two copies of the poster
at this store the other day, and when Ms. Winter told her that
she might be able to get about forty more, Vickie realized that
the best thing for all parties would be to announce the availability
of the poster in Love-Hounds--thus bringing the market to the product.
     If this goes well, Ms. Winter said she would be sure to order
any future 40 x 60" KT posters in similar quantities.
     The rest is up to you, people!
