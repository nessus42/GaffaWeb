This is a transcript of the item on the BBC 2 programme Rapido about
Kate's album. The punctuation is mine, and is as accurate as I can make
it given that Kate ums and ers a lot and does not always complete
sentences. There is an unseen female announcer and Kate replying to
unheard questions.

   *************************************************************

A. The Sensual World is Kate's first collection of new songs in four
   years. Advance reports of the album have already raised a few eyebrows.

K. I shouldn't have made the mistake of saying that I felt ... I felt
   that this album was my most personal and most female so far, and
   everyone has been saying to me "What do you mean by female?"
   And it's just a feeling really, that ... it just feels more an
   expression of myself as a woman this time.

I. Much of the new LP was recorded at Kate's home studio in Kent but
   its musical contributors come from far and wide.
   They include French harpist Alan Stivell who obviously wasn't put off
   by Kate's tea-making .

   &lt; shots of Kate making tea in best British transport cafe tradition&gt;

K. I've been a big fan of Alan's music for quite a while and I thought
   how nice it would be to get him to come in and play some harp and
   about two days later this letter turned up out of the blue ...
   and I'd never met the guy or spoken to him or anything, and it was
   a letter from Alan saying that he'd really like to work with me and
   he didn't know if I'd heard his music but ... and it's like, you
   know, within a space of two days we'd suddenly come into the air ...
   and so that is how we met and worked together.

I. Among the other guests on The Sensual World are Bulgarian singers
   the Trio Bulgarka and an old friend, Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd.

K. It was so good for me to come this full circle where, as you know, Dave
   was very involved in getting my initial signing to the record company
   and I'd kinda written this song and I knew I wanted the Bulgarian
   singers to be the main body of the song. And the idea is that at one
   point in the song the character dresses up as a rocket and jumps off
   this bridge, and it just felt so right that Dave Gilmour should be
   the rocket - you know, sort of ... off the bridge. You know ... he's
   kind of the guitar hero isn't he?

I. There was a time when Kate could turn out two albums in the
   same year and then go off on a major tour. Nowadays the
   excitement of an LP release is more likely to make her disappear
   for a few years.

K. I feel that it's important for me to retreat and to ... I don't see
   myself as a famous person, as a personality. It's really just
   me pushing my work. You know, I have to kinda promote my work, not me.
   So as soon as the work has been promoted then I can go back to
   doing the work and not promoting it. So I tend not to get involved
   in a lot of areas of the business and just sort of stay quiet until
   I've got another album out.  &lt;laughs&gt;

I. Kate's debut some eleven years ago provoked an epidemic of
   weak knees amongst schoolboys and grown-men alike. Many have never
   recovered and in fact seem to get worse with each new Bush sighting.

K. Well, I think they must be completely mad. &lt; laughs &gt;
   It's extraordinary. You know, I find that even more extraordinary
   than the fact that people are willing to wait four years and
   then want to buy an album, and the fact that people still even
   bother to ask me if I'm going to tour, you know ...
   I think you're all completely mad ... &lt;laughs&gt;
   and thank you very much, but ...  &lt;laughs &gt;

   ************************************************************


So we are all completely mad ... but Kate we already knew that!

Neil
