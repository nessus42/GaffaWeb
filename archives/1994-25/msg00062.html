Jerome Chan asks:  "You mean Kate did all the music for the
Fruitopia/psychedelic ads?"

Yes, Jerome, she did.  IED personally is disappointed that the prospect of
nine miniature Kate Bush musical jewels flitting through the U.S. airwaves
has sparked so little enthusiasm in this group.  IED certainly hopes some of
you out there are monitoring round the clock in an effort to snatch these
rare bits of sonic heaven from the ether before they drift out of rotation
for good.  By the way, IED has seen eight of the nine, 
and one of the ads described by |&gt;oug /\lan seems to be the ninth, so they're
all being shown on U.S. TV, in heavy rotation. They're showing up just as
often on network TV
as on cable.

IED recently posted a detailed (though, it seems, still too vague)
description of the dilemma into which the issue of Top of the Pops "Wuthering
Heights" performances has plunged him.  
Peter Chow from Brighton (UK) replies:

 &gt; The clip in question where she's wearing a red dress is
 &gt; actually available in the UK on a 70's video compilation
 &gt; called Music Club 'Seventies Rock and Pop - 1978' on the
 &gt; 'Video Collection' label cat. no. mc2090.
 &gt; In the video she dances the same routine as the official
 &gt; promo clip but out on a moor somewhere. It ends with her
 &gt; fading in and out getting further away from the camera
 &gt; while doing that waving trick
 &gt; This is the clip that Faith Brown imitated for her
 &gt; comedy show a few months later.

 Without trying to be rude (because actually IED appreciates
 Peter Chow's effort to help out), NO, NO, NO!   The issue's 
 getting even more mixed up by this kind of disinformation.
 The clip which Peter Chow describes above is a promo, the
 first video done by Kate, called the "field" or "moors" video, or  
 the "Rockflix" video (after the production company).  It is
 *not* the Top of the Pops appearance described in Kate Bush
 Complete (although for all IED knows, the Rockflix video 
 might have been aired on Top of the Pops, as well).  Kate Bush
 Complete is very clear about the clip in question being a 
 TV studio performance, in which Kate wears a black and red
 outfit, and performs with an orchestral backing.  

 If IED is wrong about this (he doesn't have KB Complete with 
 him), could someone please correct him? Is anyone except
 IED at this point the slightest bit interested in helping him
 out of this mess? Thanks.
