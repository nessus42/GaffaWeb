Stacy,
      This is a really vague answer but when I was vacationing a couple 
of years ago near Tampa, FL I heard a women's radio show on some small 
public radio station on Saturday mornings.  It was not the NPR station 
there, but another public station down near your end of the dial.  It 
was a form of public radio because they were having a fundraiser at 
the time.   Really unusual station in that they played a format with 
every kind of music around from progressive rock, blues and jazz.  The 
Saturday womens show featured womens music, issues and had an 
interview with a pair of folk singing feminists that were playing that 
night in Tampa.  If you can contact that station, maybe they could 
provide you with some help.  I'm sorry I don't have any more exact 
info.  I live in Chicagoland and occasionally listen to NUR but not 
frequently because I live in the NW suburbs.  Good luck on your show!
