IED, KLN remembers that interview where Kate says "I could have died."  
I will look through the books I have on hand and see if I can pinpoint 
it.  I distinctly remember Kate saying she was very nervous about the 
appearance and wan't sure what to wear.  She realized when she saw the 
show later that it was the wrong outfit, and the white dress would have 
been the right thing.  She specifically mentions the stiletto heels and 
the black and red outfit and also how mortified she was to see this 
performance.  Is it possible she talked about this in one of the 
"friendly" interviews, VH-1 or one of the early ones when she was more 
forthcoming?  I can almost hear her voice talking about this which makes 
me think I HAVE heard her talk about this. 

It was definitely Top of the Pops, definitely very early, but after the 
white dress video had been made I think.

Anyone add to this?
