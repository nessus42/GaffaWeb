 This is an update of the Kate sale list I posted 6 weeks ago.  Item
 numbers that are missing indicate items that have been sold.

 I have a very large collection of Kate Bush items for sale.  For those
 of you who have known me for a long time on this newsgroup, you should
 not take it as a sign that I am no longer interested in Kate.  Rather,
 I simply need the money -- very badly!

 All prices include postage and handling within the US.  If you are 
 outside the US, email me for a price.  Payment must be COD or by money
 order, and if the latter then I must receive payment first.  If you
 have any questions, please feel free to email me at ed@wente.llnl.gov.
 Also email me to reserve an item.

 All items are at least near mint condition, except as specified.

 For your ease in finding the item you may want, the list is divided into
 several sections:

 A. 7-inch records
 B. 12-inch singles and albums
 C. Radio shows on 12-inch records
 D. CDs

 110.  I have an autographed copy of "Hounds of Love" on vinyl.  Although
       I can't personally verify that Kate really signed it, I showed
       it to Kate experts Andrew Marvick (IED) and Peter Manchester,
       and they believe that the signature is genuine.  If people
       want to bid on this, I'll take bids through the end of August.
