Someone recently posted an article where they entertained the
idea of putting on an entire dance show around "The Ninth Wave".
Sorry, I don't remember your name (My account has an annoying
habit of wiping out anything I don't save to disk).  This is an
absolutely wonderful idea!  The other KateFans who live near
me (both of them) and I have often said we would love to see
this particular project happen.  No doubt it would be fantastic
(there's certainly a lot that could be done with the selected
music :) ).  

Well, you asked for quotes from Kate about it, no matter how
general.  My only contribution (apologies if you get this same
info numerous times) comes from a 1985 interview on the HOL
from a CD picture disc. Kate says she thinks "it was an
idea I probably go a few years ago, of someone being in the
water for the night."  She only sights old war films "where
people are cast into the water, having been through quite a
heavy experience already" as her initial inspiration for the 
work.  KT comments that she wanted to "actually launch from
that,...so there's the basis of the body in the water and the
head travels off as the night goes on..."

So perhaps "The Ninth Wave" is about a drowning person who
contemplates not only her own predicament but also other
drowning instances she's heard of, like the "Fastnet:Force
10" disaster(Wonderful explanation!), the drowning of convicted
"witches", the story of a girl who was ice-skating by herself,
etc. "And Dream of Sheep" shows the terrible difficulty of 
resisting drowining, while "Jig of Life" could be a phantasmic
delusion the drowning person suffers about meeting her older
self.


Just a few thoughts.  I look forward to hearing more about it.

New love-hound and always loyal KTB fan:

Mary-Helen, aka, Faith. 
(A name created by my mother no doubt solely for the purpose of
confusing all whom I meet.)
