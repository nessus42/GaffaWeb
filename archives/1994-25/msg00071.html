Hi,
 
Something here which could lead to an interesting discussion. Read
this and think.
 
Recently I bought the new album by Seal, whose new singles "Prayer
for the dying" and "Kiss from a rose" impressed me so much I
decided to do this. Upon having the album I started to read the
long letter he wrote as sleeve notes. Here's a very interesting
piece of that:
 
"One of the most popular questions people seem to ask is: "Why
 don't you print your lyrics on the album?" Well, the answer to
 that is that quite often, my songs mean one thing to me and
 another to the listener. But that's OK because I think it's the
 general vibe of what I'm saying that is important and not the
 exact literal translation. How many times have you fallen in love
 with a lyric that you thought went, "Show me a day with Hilda
 Ogden and I'll despair", only to find that it went "Show me a way
 to solve your problems and I'll be there". I guess what I'm saying
 is that the song is always larger in the listeners mind because
 with it they attach imagery which is relative to their own
 personal experience."
 
Being someone who's very into lyrics, I started to think of my own
lyrical interpretations. I found that I do have a way of turning
the lyrics toward my own experiences.
Now, Kate's lyrics are usually printed on the albums, right from
the start (although I've heard there are versions without lyrics
available...). I imagine a lot of people start listening to Kate's
albums by learning the lyrics first... :-)
 
But for those who don't: have you done this? What are the most
beautiful lyrics you made up after listening to Kate singing
something that went... differently?
 
I won't bore you all with an example -- you can work this one out
yourselves... :)
 
Byee

PS I feel so stupid... "Comments" should've been "compliments", of
course, a few days ago...
