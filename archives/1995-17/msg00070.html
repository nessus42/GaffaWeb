Attention: my correct email address is at the moment:  
                              willker@slater.chemie.uni-bremen.de
               and NOT:       willker@chemie.uni-bremen.de


Dear friends,
A coincidence (Strange Phenomena): the same question appears twice in the
same time: see "rare recordings" by Emmy L. and "Subscription" by me.

This is the question again:
I recently got a tape with early Kate Bush songs called "The Early Years,
Demos 1976". It has nothing to do with the mysterious Early Years LP. I got
the tape from K.D.Zilske in Germany and he got it from a proffesional dealer
in the UK. I think it is difficult to follow up the story behind that. The
tape contains mostly the well known demo songs + Another Day. But at the end
of this tape is a VERY beautyful song called 

                        Turkish Delight. 

It has been recorded with full instrumentation and with relatively good
sound quality. There is some noise on it, but it is much "whiter" compared
to the Cathy demos. Therefore I think it was a professional recording. 

Before the song Kate says something like "any song is channeling or
releasing a form of energy". Maybe it´s from an interview connected with the
song? I think, it is from around 1979, maybe from TV? Kates voice is very
high on the song.  
Dear Emmy, maybe you can make a transcription of the lyrics? I am not that
familiar with English to get it. I only have:

. . . so many heavily beauties for you, 
      this is your harem . . .

I think, this question is for you, "know-all"-people from England. Maybe
someone has a more "original" recording compared to my tape?

Maybe I can make a digitalization of the song if it´s really that rare. But
it will take some time. I could also send you a tape-copy, Andrew. 

Best wishes 
          Wieland
