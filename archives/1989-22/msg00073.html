 THE SENSUAL WORLD

 Mmh, yes,
 Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth
 Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes,
 Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies
 Off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes,
 He said I was a flower of the mountain, yes,
 But now I've powers o'er a woman's body--yes.

 Stepping out of the page into the sensual world.
 Stepping out...................
 To where the water and the earth caress
 And the down of a peach says mmh, yes,
 Do I look for those millionaires
 Like a Machiavellian girl would
 When I could wear a sunset? mmh, yes,
 And how we'd wished to live in the sensual world
 You don't need words--just one kiss, then another.

 Stepping out of the page into the sensual world
 Stepping out, off the page, into the sensual world.
 And then our arrows of desire rewrite the speech, mmh, yes,
 And then he whispered would I, mmh, yes,
 Be safe, mmh, yes, from mountain flowers?
 And at first with the charm around him, mmh, yes,

 He loosened it so if it slipped between my breasts
 He'd rescue it, mmh, yes,
 And his spark took life in my hand and, mmh, yes,
 I said, mmh, yes,
 But not yet, mmh, yes,
 Mmh, yes.

 LOVE AND ANGER

 It lay buried here. It lay deep inside me.
 It's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it.
 It could take me all of my life,
 But it would only take a moment to
 Tell you what I'm feeling,
 But I don't know if I'm ready yet.
 You come walking into this room
 Like you're walking into my arms.
 What would I do without you?

 Take away the love and the anger,
 And a little piece of hope holding us together.
 Looking for a moment that'll never happen,
 Living in the gap between past and future.
 Take away the stone and the timber,
 And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.

 If you can't tell your sister,
 If you can't tell a priest,
 'Cause it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it
 To anyone,
 Can you tell it to your heart?
 Can you find it in your heart
 To let go of these feelings
 Like a bell to a Southerly wind?
 We could be like two strings beating,
 Speaking in sympathy..................
 What would we do without you?
 Two strings speak in sympathy.

 Take away the love and the anger,
 And a little piece of hope holding us together.
 Looking for a moment that'll never happen,
 Living in the gap between past and future.
 Take away the stone and the timber,
 And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.

 We're building a house of the future together.
 (What would we do without you?)
 Well, if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it,
 Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future.
 Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it,
 Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future.
 You might not, not think so now,
 But just you wait and see--someone will come to help you.

THE FOG

 You see, I'm all grown up now.
 He said,
 "Just put your feet down child,
 'Cause you're all grown up now."

 Just like a photograph,
 I pick you up.
 Just like a station on the radio,
 I pick you up.
 Just like a face in the crowd,
 I pick you up.
 Just like a feeling that you're sending out,
 I pick it up.
 But I can't let you go.
 If I let you go,
 You slip into the fog............

 This love was big enough for the both of us.
 This love of yours was big enough to be frightened of.
 It's deep and dark, like the water was,
 The day I learned to swim.
 He said, "Just put your feet down, child.

 "Just put your feet down child,
 The water is only waist high.
 I'll let go of you gently,
 Then you can swim to me."

 Is this love big enough to watch over me?
 Big enough to let go of me
 Without hurting me,
 Like the day I learned to swim?

 "'Cause you're all grown up now.
 Just put your feet down, child,
 The water is only waist high.
 I'll let go of you gently,
 Then you can swim to me."

REACHING OUT

 See how the child reaches out instinctively
 To feel how fire will feel.

 See how the man reaches out instinctively
 For what he cannot have.

 The pull and the push of it all.

 Reaching out for the hand.
 Reaching out for the hand that smacked.
 Reaching out for that hand to hold.
 Reaching out for the Star.
 Reaching out for the Star that explodes.
 Reaching out for Mama.

 See how the flower leans instinctively toward the light
 See how the heart reaches out instinctively
 For no reason but to touch.

 The pull and the push of it all.

 Reaching out for the hand
 Reaching out for the hand that smacked
 Reaching out for that hand to hold.
 Reaching out for the Star.
 Reaching out for the Star that explodes.
 Reaching out for Mama.
 (Can't we see.............)
 Reaching out for Mama.

HEADS WE'RE DANCING

 You talked me into the game of chance.
 It was '39, before the music started,
 When you walked up to me and you said,
 "Hey, heads we dance."
 Well, I didn't know who you were
 Until I saw the morning paper:

 There was a picture of you
 A picture of you 'cross the front page.
 It looked just like you, just like you in every way.
 But it couldn't be true.
 It couldn't be true.
 You stepped out of a stranger.

 They say that the Devil is a charming man.
 And just like you I bet he can dance.
 And he's coming up behind in his long
 Tailed black coat dance,
 All tails in the air.
 But the penny landed with its head dancing.

 A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform,
 Standing with your head held high,
 Hot down to the floor.
 But it couldn't be you.
 It couldn't be you.
 It's a picture of Hitler.

 He go do-do-do-do-do
 He go do-do-do-do-do
 He go do-do-do-do-do
 Do you want to dance?
 Well, I couldn't see what was to be,
 So I just stood there laughing.

 A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform,
 Standing with your head held high,
 Hot down to the floor.
 But it couldn't be you.
 It couldn't be you.
 It's a picture of Hitler.

 He go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
 He go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
 He go mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
 Heads we're dancing.

DEEPER UNDERSTANDING

 As the people here grow colder
 I turn to my computer
 And spend my evenings with it
 Like a friend.
 I was loading a new programme
 I had ordered from a magazine:

 "Are you lonely, are you lost?
 This voice console is a _must_."
 I press Execute.

 "Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired.
 I bring you love and deeper understanding.
 Hello, I know that you're unhappy.
 I bring you love and deeper understanding."

 Well I've never felt such pleasure.
 Nothing else seemed to matter.
 I neglected my bodily needs.
 I did not eat, I did not sleep,
 The intensity increasing,
 'Til my family found me and intervened.

 But I was lonely, I was lost,
 Without my little black box.
 I pick up the phone and go, Execute.

 "Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired.
 I bring you love and deeper understanding.
 Hello, I know that you're unhappy.
 I bring you love and deeper understanding."

 I turn to my computer like a friend.
 I need deeper understanding.
 Give me deeper understanding.

BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN

 With her hand in his hand,
 They were both happy again.
 You started taking sides.
 They started arguing.
 He said it was her fault.
 She said it wasn't at all.
 But the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

 Where angels fear to tread,
 You go rushing in.
 Well, I had to tell you then,
 And now I'm telling you again:

 Stay out of this
 You must not interfere
 Don't you see this is
 Between a man and a woman?

 Every day and night I pray,
 Pray that you will stay away forever.
 It's so hard for love to stay together,
 With the modern Western pressures.
 I don't want to say it,
 But I had to tell you then,
 And now I'm telling you again:

 Stay out of this.
 Oh, I know you mean to help me,
 And I know you've good intentions.
 But stay out of this.
 This isn't your problem.
 Do not interfere--you are not needed here.
 Let the pendulum swing
 Between a man and a woman.
 Don't you see? you're in the way--between a man and a woman.

 Every day and night I pray,
 Let the pendulum swing
 Between a man and a woman.
 Between a man and a woman.

NEVER BE MINE

 I look at you and see
 My life that might have been:
 Your face just ghostly in the smoke.
 They're setting fire to the cornfields
 As you're taking me home.
 The smell of burning fields
 Will now mean you and here.

 This is where I want to be.
 This is what I need.
 This is where I want to be.
 This is what I need.
 This is where I want to be,
 But I know that this will never be mine.

 Ooh, the thrill and the hurting.
 The thrill and the hurting.
 I know that this will never be mine.

 I want you as the dream,
 Not the reality.
 That clumsy goodbye-kiss could fool me,
 But I'm looking back over my shoulder
 At you, happy without me.

 This is where I want to be.
 This is what I need.
 This is where I want to be.
 This is what I need.
 This is where I want to be,
 But I know that this will never be mine.

 Ooh, the thrill and the hurting
 Will never be mine.
 The thrill and the hurting,
 It will never be mine.
 It can never be.
 The thrill and the hurting
 Will never be mine.

ROCKET'S TAIL (FOr Rocket)

 That November night, looking up into the sky,
 You said,

 "Hey, wish that was me up there--
 It's the biggest rocket I could find,
 And it's holding the night in its arms
 If only for a moment.
 I can't see the look in its eyes,
 But I'm sure it must be laughing."

 But it seemed to me the saddest thing I'd ever seen,
 And I thought you were crazy, wishing such a thing.

 I saw only a stick on fire,
 Alone on its journey
 Home to the quickening ground,
 With no one there to catch it.

 I put on my pointed hat
 And my black and silver suit,
 And I check my gunpowder pack
 And I strap the stick on my back.
 And, dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge--
 Nobody seems to see me.
 Then, with the fuse in my hand,
 And now shooting into the night
 And still as a rocket,
 I land in the river.

 Was it me said you were crazy?
 I put on my cloudiest suit,
 Size 5 lightning boots, too.
 'Cause I am a rocket
 On fire.
 Look at me go, with my tail on fire,
 With my tail on fire,
 On fire.
 Hey, look at me go, look at me...

THIS WOMAN'S WORK

 Pray God you can cope.
 I stand outside this woman's work,
 This woman's world.
 Ooh, it's hard on the man,
 Now his part is over.
 Now starts the craft of the father.

 I know you have a little life in you yet.
 I know you have a lot of strength left.
 I know you have a little life in you yet.
 I know you have a lot of strength left.

 I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.
 I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
 Of all the things I should've said,
 That I never said.
 All the things we should've done,
 That we never did.
 All the things I should've given,
 But I didn't.
 Oh, darling, make it go,
 Make it go away.

 Give me these moments back.
 Give them back to me.
 Give me that little kiss.
 Give me your hand.

 (I know you have a little life in you yet.
 I know you have a lot of strength left.
 I know you have a little life in you yet.
 I know you have a lot of strength left.)

 I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.
 I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
 Of all the things we should've said,
 That were never said.
 All the things we should've done,
 That we never did.
 All the things that you needed from me.
 All the things that you wanted for me.
 All the things that I should've given,
 But I didn't.
 Oh, darling, make it go away.
 Just make it go away now.

     Orchestra Arranged by Michael Kamen




WALK STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE

 Can't move my arms,
 Can't move my legs.
 Can't say no,
 I can't say yes.
 Can't help myself.
 I need your help.

 (We go)
 "Ooh, ooh, what do we do,
 Now we just can't move?"
 We're calling out for Middle Street.
 "Ooh, ooh, what do we do,
 Now we just can't move?"
 We hang on to every line,
 And walk straight down the middle of it.

 He thought he was gonna die,
 But he didn't.
 she thought she just couldn't cope,
 But she did.
 We thought it would be so hard,
 But it wasn't.....
 It wasn't easy, though!

 Can't say yes,
 I can't say no.
 Can't begin,
 Can't let go...
 Help me now.

 (We go)
 "Ooh, ooh, what do we do,
 Now we just can't move?"
 We're calling out for Middle Street.
 "Ooh, ooh, what do we do,
 Now we just can't move?"
 We hang on to every line,
 And walk straight down the middle of it.

 He thought he was gonna die,
 But he didn't.
 She thought she could never cope,
 But she did.
 We thought it was all over,
 But it wasn't...
 It hadn't started yet.

 And walk straight down the middle of it.
 And walk straight down the middle of it.
 "d^^^^^^^^^^ d^^^^^^^^^^", calling out for Middle Street.
 Calling out for Middle Street, "d^^^^^^^^^^ d^^^^^^^^^^^".
 Walking straight down the middle of it. "d^^^^^^^^^^^^^^".
