Some random musings:

1. PREDICTION: The video for _TSW_ will be a moderate hit on VH-1,
   but won't get much airplay on MTV (except a few plays on Mr.
   Curry's respectable "Post-Modern MTV" show.)  If a video from 
   the album will make it big among the teen crowd, it will be
   an awsome video of _Rocket's Tail_.  Challenge:  Try to compose
   your own videos of the various songs on the album.  It's fun!

2. _This Woman's Work_ makes four songs now (by my count) dealing
   with birth/womb themes.  This seems unusual, compared to other
   artists.  In fact, I can't really think of anyone else who has
   dared to sing about the topic, let alone four songs.

3. _Deeper Understanding_ seems to be about Kate (or whomever) finding
   (1) friendship and (2) knowledge through a computer.  There is
   clear reference to some sort of dial-up network.  As Ed Suryani
   pointed out to me, the choir represents the responses from the
   computer, as if it were a bunch of other people.  Others have
   speculated that it's the computer itself, but I think it makes
   more sense to think of it as other users on a net.  Sounds to me
   it could only be about ...   Love-Hounds !!!  Wow!  Kate has
   written an obvious tribute to  *us* !!!!!!!!!   :^)

4. _Rocket's Tail_ is the FIRST Kate song (from *any* album) to creep
   under my skin and "hook" me.  That's not to disparage any of her
   previous work.  Up 'til now, I've been mostly impressed by her
   work in aggregate - the songs all work together, and no single
   one jumps out on its own from the others.  But _RT_ is *awesome*!
   The combination of Kate's voice, the Trio B., Dave G.'s guitar,
   and the elusive ethnic sound (Is it Irish with Bulgarian influences
   or Bulgarian with Irish influences?) have an effect I can only
   describe as "searing".

5. Regarding _Heads We're Dancing_, I have to admit I like the theory
   presented that it is about Hitler "seducing" Europe, and their
   reaction when they "woke up".  Also, has anyone pondered the
   significance of the title sans apostrophe?  "Heads were dancing"
   could have the meaning of "Heads were rolling" (past tense).
   Sometimes it sounds like Kate is saying "were" instead of "we're",
   but I don't know enough about that zany English accent of hers.
