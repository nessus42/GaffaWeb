&gt; Could somebody explain the reference to "Our Price", please?
 Sounds like a record store, doesn't it? O, someone said that. But what is
 his problem with "the"?  Wouldn't you say "pop down to the K-Mart"?

&gt; From: Pete Hartman &lt;bucc2!pwh@bradley.edu&gt;
&gt; I saw the new video for _Regina_ (a hard "g" rather than the soft
&gt; one usually used in english) by the Sugarcubes last weekend.  I
 Can you describe it briefly for those of us who don't watch TV but
 nevertheless like to fantasize about Bjork?  :-)

&gt;	Kate's so clever nowadays she writes *and* produces her records.
&gt;    She's also got bloomin' sexy with "Sensual World" in which talk of 
  Ha, ha.           ^^^^^

&gt;    desire, touching and Kate's own breasts is rife.  But these aren't
  Well, Molly's breasts, actually.

&gt; Francisco Bay Guardian_.  Here's this week's picks:
&gt;Kate Bush--"The Sensual World"
&gt;Ian McCulloch--"Proud To Fall"
&gt;The Lightning Seeds--"Pure"
&gt;The Sugarcubes--"Regina"
   What, only fourth?

&gt; Most of the tracks on "Opel" consist of Syd singing and playing acoustic
 Thanks, especially for posting the lyrics.  Joyce's poetry is not nearly
 so interesting as his 'prose', however.

-----------------------------------
More back-and-forth with JSD:

&gt; [on _love_and_anger_:] 
Yes, yours is a more conventional interpretation. I too see strong
parallels to RUTH. I really didn't think much about suicide in relation
to the song until _after_ IED's comments about death.  I am still 
waiting to hear something from that corner...

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Fog: this is _plainly_ an outtake from "the Ninth Wave"
&gt; No, I'm being facetious again.  But there are so many musical, timbral,
&gt; and thematic links to so many songs from _The_Ninth_Wave_, that it's
But it really does sound like a _Ninth_Wave_ b-side, doesn't it?

&gt; But first, a note: I don't think it's an allegorical song, because
&gt; Kate usually is very literal minded when she tells a story.  Think of
&gt; "Cloudbusting" or "Houdini" where all the lyrics make perfect sense if
&gt; you happen to know exactly what she's talking about.  In fact, I can't
&gt; think of a single allegorical text in the KT oeuvre.  It may be late at
&gt; night however, and my memory might not be sharp as a razor...
How about, for an example near at hand, RUTH? Or _Gaffa_?
_There_Goes_a_Tenner_, while perfectly literal, is an example of a song
which we have never found a precise antecedent for, and where the lyrics
don't quite make "perfect sense" even in the most precise setting we have.
However, I suspect there is, as you suggest, some precise referrent for
the image of coin-tossing.

&gt; chicks, if you ask me, and I intend to try it out at the next
&gt; appropriate social event I'm at. ]
But try it soon! After Oct. 17, everyone is going to be doing it!

&gt; "There Goes A Tenner." I think it is relevant.  Could this be possibly
&gt; based on an actual historical event?  Wouldn't surprise me if it were.
Wouldn't surprise me either. Any Hitler experts out there?

&gt; Try: "and bow to a southerly wind"
Sounds good, even without going back to the recording.

&gt; I think it is "up" in all four lines.
I think so too; "out" made a little more sense.

&gt; Last line is: Reaching out for MAMA!!!
This one I have to go back to the tape for. Probably I just heard what
I was expecting to hear, as though this were a conventional pop record!

Basically, all of your textual corrections are well taken, thanks.
