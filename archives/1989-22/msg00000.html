As usual, love-hounds is acting screwy.  I see that my article
"Great, great news (continued)" has been posted, but not the main
article, which I called "Great, great news"!  If it doesn't get
posted within a day I think I'd better type it in again.

That's just so you people won't ask me what it's continued from.

Meanwhile, here's what I want to talk about now:

1)  Various items from the Sept. 23 issue of _Record Mirror_.

    A) A short article:

    WHERE IN THE WORLD
	 Nobody could ever accuse Kate Bush of rushing her career.  
    Instead of rushing out album after album, Kate prefers to take a
    back seat in the fast food pop race, laboring away in her picturesque
    farmhouse in Kent.
	 It's not that Kate's trying to cultivate an image as an eccentric
    musician who locks herself away from the world, it's just that she's
    a total perfectionist who will spend weeks, months, even years getting
    her ideas just right.
	 Now though, after a four year gap, Kate will follow up her 1985
    album "Hounds of Love" with "The Sensual World", out on October 16.
    The first taster from Kate's new album is the title track, released
    as a single this week.  Although it's classic Kate Bush, "The Sensual
    World" is a lot less angry and mellower than "Hounds of Love".
	 Bulgarian singing group Trio Bulgarka are featured on three of
    the tracks, such as "Rocket's Tail", and other folky influences
    include uillean pipes, a bouzouki and Kate's brother Paddy on whips.
    That's right, whips!
	 There's bad news, though.  Kate has no plans to play live.  Her
    first and last tour was in 1979 and it seems that even wild hounds
    couldn't drag her back on the road now.
	 Besides, with all the hours she needs to work on her albums,
    where would she find the time?

    There's a nice picture with this article.

    B)  A review of the single:

	Kate's so clever nowadays she writes *and* produces her records.
    She's also got bloomin' sexy with "Sensual World" in which talk of 
    desire, touching and Kate's own breasts is rife.  But these aren't
    merely shock tactics.  "Sensual" is a delicate and all-consuming song.
    It even features Paddy Bush on whips!!  Easy now.

    C)  A letter to the editor:

    WHAT KATY DID
	Hello!  So inspired was I by Gary's Fuzzbox poem (_rm_ September
    9) that I've decided to write one of my own (about Kate Bush):
    Hey folks!  She's back you know,
    Picking you up when you're feeling low
    She's so cool, she's so ace
    No one else could take her place
    She is fab, she is lush
    Of course it's none other than Kate Bush
    Go on now, listen to her groovy new track
    Boy I missed you -- welcome back!

    -- Lilly Lionheart, Tycoch, Swansea

    The editor writes:
      
      Do you think you could put this poem on tape and send it to me,
    Lilly?  No, it's not that I think it's good or anything, I'd just
    like to hear you rhyming "lush" with "Bush"!
      It seems that my attempts to stop people sending poems to the
    Letters page have failed.  If we must have them then can we have
    some about either Debbie Gibson, Neil Tennant or Simply Red please.

    There's a small picture of Kate with the caption "KATE:  the lush
    Ms Bush gives us a blush"

2) A review of the single from the Sept. 23 issue of _Kerrang_, a British
   heavy metal (!) magazine:

	She still hasn't married.  I just wanted to let you know that
   before we began:  Kate is A Single Woman, apart from that dodgy
   bassist she shares a flat with.  Hell, this even comes complete with
   a pic of her softly caressing a peach, her fingers gently kneading the
   soft fuzz of the skin, and when she sings, she sings of a deep
   sensuality that ensures that I have to wear baggy trousers when I 
   dance.  Beautiful, warm and ever lasting.  I want, I want, I want. . .

I must say I never heard Del Palmer referred to as "that dodgy bassist"
before.

3)  Steve Masters' Weekly Picks.

Every week, Steve Masters (the KITS DJ and Music Director) lists his
ten favorite songs of the week in a Budweiser ad (!) in _The San
Francisco Bay Guardian_.  Here's this week's picks:

Kate Bush--"The Sensual World"
Ian McCulloch--"Proud To Fall"
The Lightning Seeds--"Pure"
The Sugarcubes--"Regina"
Consolidated--"Consolidated"
ABC--"The Real Thing"
Depeche Mode--"Dangerous"
Celebrate The Nun--"Will You Be There"
Thompson Twins--"Sugar Daddy"
Nina Hagen--"Where's The Party"

Since these are not in alphabetical order, I think we can assume that it's
in the order of his preference.  That puts Kate at the top!
