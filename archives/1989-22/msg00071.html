why is this newsgroup so quiet these days?  and why doesn't
ed suranyi post more?

okay, seriously, i'm delighted to still have my little
promo copy in my hot little hands, as people from work
are now knocking on my door asking to borrow it (my fault,
for recommending kate's latest on our company-wide newsgroup).
i guess i'm a wimp, cuz i'm waiting for the tsw lyrics sheet 
before jumping into analysis discussions with jon d. and julian!  
however drukman, on the little i *can* discern from "rocket's
tail", suicide doesn't occur to me.  why would she want to go
*up* or skyward?  i associate this with soaring in a positive
way, not spiraling *downward* towards a suicidal death.  however,
my speculation is premature, as i haven't figured out all the
lyrics yet.  we'll see.  at any rate, i'm happy to have julian's
transcribed side won to get started with (okay i'm lazy.  so
shoot me).   so far "love and anger" is my fave.  and i must
agree with jon drukman (god, did i say that??) in that
if someone hates you, that's far more flattering that someone
feeling nothing for you at all.  in the context of ex's, that is.
don't worry jon--we aren't the clods you think.  it's just nice   
to hear that you've been in love, and experienced those softer
emotions of your female side.

i'm still rigid in my opinion that HoL is the richest, strongest,
deepest work so far.  at least i'm not alone (thanks, jon p.).
andy gough is ofcourse, off his rocker--TD is lots o' fun, but
the *best*?  come, now.  

by the way, speaking of john precedo, who inquired about a UK
release bash, why don't *you* host one, jon?  perhaps you
could get some support from dan of unisoft, who as we know,
saw the real ravens in the tower of london (hi dan!).  that
way perhaps newcomer patrik yle'n could hop over from
sweden and find out what the requirements are for gaffa
membership.

way to go steve williams for planning the texas bash!  i'm
sure everyone in texas is rich enough to afford a plane
ticket to the austin abode.  steve, please post the number
of the party when you have all the details so the west-coast
contingent can give you a ring.  you'll be able to talk to
distinguished love-hounds such as corey lofdahl, edward
suranyi, and that ied guy!  
jeff wasiliko, i noticed you're in the bay area--hope you can
make it.

remember when ied said we could expect a period of silence 
from him upon release of tsw (to give him a time of quiet
reflection and contemplation)?  is this still true, andy?
you want to miss out on the most excited, insane, wonderful
time of all on love-hounds?
