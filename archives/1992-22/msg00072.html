Hello everyone! - 
    Katemas in San Jose went well and I hope that everyone had a good 
time!  I counted a total of 29 people over the course of the day, and 
that's quite enough to convince me that there's still an interest to keep 
a good thing going.. I'd like those that did go to send me e-mail and let 
me know what you thought... and be honest.. I need criticism and 
suggestions as to what you'd like to see next year!  The whole event here 
was really last minute, so  despite whatever great, grand ideas I had for 
making the event perfect that I didn't do, I'm quite content with myself 
for doing quite a lot in a short period of time.. 

    It was great chatting with some of you who called us from other 
Katemas parties. :)  I hope that next year, we get more of a chance to 
exchange ideas  as to how we can effectively promote our events as one 
package, thereby giving us more visibility, and have a good exchange of 
creative ideas.  It would also be great to generate press releases so 
that we can get extra attention and hopefully make enough noise that Kate 
finally tours over here, or perhaps innundate Kate and her label with 
postcards inviting her to America.. :)  There's a lot that we can do 
together, I'm sure! 

   My feed for gaffa is down right now... haven't read what's going on 
out there for a  few weeks... I was watching 120 minutes on MTV tonight 
though and saw soemthing interesting. A band called the Utah Saints 
showed their new video "Something Good" , which is actually a dance song 
made up from a sample of Kate "I know that something good is gonna 
happen..."  and although I didn't really love it, I thought it was great 
that they had plenty of the video for Cloudbusting in their video. It's a 
scary thought that Kate usually gets more press out of being  in other 
people's videos than her own... and in this case, it's shades of what 
happenned with Suzanne Vega's "Mel's Diner"  .... Can we deal with a 
whole country of people humming Kate???  Quite possibly, yes!

</PRE>
