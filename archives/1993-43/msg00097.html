When I got a single-unit everything-all-in-one-with-one-disc-player, I never
thought it would make that much difference, i mostly had tapes anyway.  And,
heck, it's lazy to need to play more than one disc at once, isn't it?

Sigh.  I got TRS on Tuesday and TWW box set on Wednesday.  I would LOVE to
be able to put TRS, the two "different" TWW discs, and HoL, NfE, and TKI
(which I only have on very worn out cassettes) in the disc player...  Just
be able to zap it to where I want, probably listen to the 3 VERY new things
all over, and pick something from the others..  

I just like to sit and listen to them, so for the first 3 days I just had
TRS in over and over and over again, now I'm listening to Disc I of TWW - I
don't have anything to add to everyone else's TRS discussion, but I do want
to say that I absolutely LOVE "Un Baiser D'Enfant" - it's beautiful in
French.  The rest is wonderful wonderful wonderful, too...  :)

A question:  Does anyone know if the military-person in the Experiment IV
video who is kind of the background military-person (dies on the phone in
the hall) is the actor who plays Bertie Wooster on Masterpiece Theater?

I also wondered if anyone knew how good the Dreamtime album of the Bristol
(I think) concert is.  I guess if it's on vinyl the audio quality isn't
going to be terribly wonderful; maybe "collectible," though.  I also saw a
concert recording on disc, but I don't know what it was.  Too bad I just
spent all my allocated KaTefunds and more  (ooh ooh it's "Un Baiser
D'Enfant" again!) - I ran into all these things at a used record store i
found - as well as a marble vinyl HoL disc.  The fact that I don't have a
turntable is what mostly fazed me.

OK, babble off.  I'm in such KaTecstasy, I can't help it.

Kath
