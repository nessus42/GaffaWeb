<PRE>
Today I visited three record stores. Success all three times:

All had big posters for The Red Shoes. One had the album cover in two subway
sized posters, two had half that big Rubberband Girl posters, 3-4 each. All
three also had a bunch of blown-up CD covers (the brown part of the jewel
pack also present) and round, ca. 40 cm diameter, signs with 'Kate Bush / The
Red Shoes'.

First shop, the one with the subway sized TRS posters:

me: 'Would it be possible to get these posters? [pointing to a particular wall]
     when they aren't needed any longer?'
he: 'Yes, you're the first! I'll reserve them for you.'
me: 'Great! How long will they stay on display?'
he: 'About three weeks.'
he2:'[teasing tone] For free?'
me: 'What do you want to have?'
he: 'Warsteiner! [a famous German beer]'
me: 'ok...'

Second shop:

me: 'Would it be possible to get these posters? [pointing next to the entrance]'
she:'Well, normally we give them away on a first come first serve basis. We
     take notes. Which posters do you want?'
me: 'The Kate Bush ones.'
she:'Let's see [goes away ... comes back] They are only there for a short time
     now, so they will stay two or three weeks. You're the first. What's your
     name?'
me: 'Uli Grepel'
she:'Ok, noted...'

Third shop:

me: 'What happens to the posters if they aren't needed any longer?'
he: 'They are thrown away.'
me: 'WHAT? Could one do something so that this doesn't happen?'
he: 'Well, I can write down a note and tack it to the back of the posters. If
     you are lucky the person decorating the shop will notice the note before
     thrashing them. What's your name?'
me: 'Uli Grepel'
he: 'ok. But remember, I can't promise. Two or three weeks.'

Fourth shop:

me: [goes searching around. Finds exactly one copy of the CD. In the normal
     bin, filed under 'Kate Bush', as well as about 5 other Kate CDs. Looks
     at the price tag. Reads '36.95 DM'. Remembers to have seen '29.90 DM',
     '26.99 DM' and to have paid '29.95 DM'. Decided that this shop REALLY
     shouldn't be bothered with any longer. Went home]

So if you see posters in a shop, don't hesitate to ask if you can get them.
But please don't do so anywhere I might be near. Or at least not for posters
of Kate...

Bye,

Uli
