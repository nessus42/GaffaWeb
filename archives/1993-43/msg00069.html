I am split open with devotion, people.  Let me tell you how.

Before I begin, a couple of words...

...suzanne, could you hold a TRS button for me?  Thanks!  It's
as010b@uhura.cc.rochester.edu, or Drewcifer, or Tree of Schnopia.  Me.


Also, (to the folks on Love-Hounds) could we cool it on the TSW-bashing? 
The Sensual World introduced me to Kate and, unlike many, it seems, I adore
it.  We've heard it all before.  Let's can it.  Thanks.

Right.  Let's begin, then.

1. Rubberband Girl
	
	Catchy.  I like it.  I don't love it.  It's actually a bit obnoxious
unless you're dancing.  B-/C+

2. And So Is Love

	The verse is entirely too sparse, lyrically speaking.  In fact, my
impression is that the entire song has a splendid mood and nice Clapton
guitar, but not a lot going for it lyrically.  It sounds half-finished.  C

3. Eat The Music

	Unlike the rest of you, it seems, I actually like this song a great
deal.  I'm not bored by repetitiveness, when the rhythm is the centerpiece
of the song, as it is here.  The sheer joy of the song is what makes it. 
B/B+

4. Moments of Pleasure

	I differ from the madding crowd here as well.  I was hardly
"stunned" by this track; au contraire.  I was quite underwhelmed.  It's
growing on me, but it carries the frustration of an inside joke to which
you're not privy.  I really love the music, however, and it's a lovely,
sweet theme.  I'm just not sure I appreciate the lyrical execution. 
("Smurf, playing his guitar refrain"?  :) )  B

5. The Song of Solomon

	Ummm...underwhelmed again.  Close.  At first I found the "bullshit"
refrain to be a bit irritating...the problem is not the vulgarity, but the
contrast evoked by same.  I've really had it up to here with songs about
"shut up and kiss".  I don't know about Kate or you lot, but I find that
being worshipped with words is incredibly erotic and intimate.  If they're
bullshit, yeah, they suck, but touches, kisses, caresses can be bullshit,
too.  This title made me hope for another "The Sensual World"...I'm not
even sure I got Kate.  C

6. Lily

	Good Tree.  This is the Kate I know and love.  This is a smashing
song.  Top-notch lyrics.  Incredibly powerful music (I can't help but move
to it).  Stunning air and fire.  This is a very elemental track.  A

7.  The Red Shoes

	My favorite song on the album by far.  It's a wonderfully
fascinating story to begin with, and Kate brings spectacular musical effects
to it.  It has a beautiful, shimmering, glimmering, sparkling, rough feel,
like breaking glass.  I can't even begin to describe it rationally.  It
pulls my spine straight and possesses me.  I dance, even after the shoes
come off.  A+

8. Top Of The City

	A very interesting song lyrically.  It doesn't engage me musically
the way I wish it would.  And there is little else to say.  C-/D+

9. Constellation of the Heart

	Kate, oh Kate, why hast thou forsaken me?  I would have flunked this
song but for that wonderful chorus response section.  Had that been attached
to a real refrain, this song would have soared in my ratings, but that
stinker of a hook sunk the tune down, down, down.  D

10. Big Stripey Lie

	Not bad.  I don't find it as exciting as the rest of you, it seems. 
Wonderfully psychedelic song, though...I would love to design a video for
it.  It's very otherworldly.  A

11. Why Should I Love You

	You know, I thought I'd hate this, and I really like it.  I'm
serious, I think it's quite good, actually.  I can't really be rational
about why I like it, either, though for different reasons than before.  I
like Prince a lot anyway, although I rarely listen to his stuff.  It's
surprising how this meshed.  A-/B+

12. You're The One

	I'm not interested, thank you.  I'm never thrilled about any song
which mentions money, in general, aside possibly from "Silent All These
Years".  But seriously, I found little to engage me here.  Oh, except for
the Trio.  C-/D+


It's important to keep in mind that these are Katings, which means that
compared with almost every other recording artist these ratings should be
much higher.  I'd rather listen to Kate's worst than, say, Blind Melon's
best any day.

A few other notes: pick up the new Concrete Blonde album (Mexican Moon).  A
solid, skillful album.  It makes up for a lack of truly remarkable songs
with an array of just plain terrific ones.  Highly recommended, after just
one listen!  The new Cocteau Twins isn't half bad either, although they
usually only appear when I need ambience, when I have a headache, or when
I'm burning candles.

Ciao,
Drewcifer
