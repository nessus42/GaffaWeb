The Bush Campaign

The story of Kate Bush is unique, both for the sensitivity with which 
record company EMI has managed her career, and for the personal 
privacy she has managed to retain. As Bush prepares to release a new 
album and accompanying film, she describes how creative control is her 
prime concern, while musical collaborator and ex-boyfriend Del 
Palmer offers an insider's view of the Bush phenomenon, Story: Tony 
Horkins

If there's one thing Kate Bush's career proves, it's that there's 
something dreadfully awry about record company policy in the '90s. 
Imagine a major record company doing this today: they find a talented 
16 year-old, a bit quirky, not like much else that's happening. They sign 
him/her, but let that talent evolve over a four year period before 
releasing a single note. Over that time, they help train that protege - 
dancing lessons, singng lessons, studio time - to make sure that they're 
absolutely ready to impress. Then they let their artist pick their first 
single and watch it shoot to number one. Let's face it; in 1993, it's pure 
fantasy. But in 1974 it was a reality for Kate Bush. It's been well 
documented how Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour got to hear her demos 
and passed them on to the top brass at EMI, who promptly signed her 
up. But according to Del Palmer, Kate's long-term musical collaborator 
and former boyfriend, even in the '70s it was pretty exceptional 
behaviour. 'Someone had some real foresight there,' he recalls. 'Even 
back then, it wasn't exactly common bchaviour for a record company to 
behave that way. But they could see she had something very special...' 
Del could too after he was introduced to the teenage Bush by her 
brother Paddy - 'we were dating from the moment we met," he says. 
He'd known Paddy for some time, and was busy getting yet another 
pub band together when a friend suggested they ask Paddy's sister to 
sing. 'She just said yeah, great, I'd love to do it,' he remembers. 'At that 
stage she was up for doing anything at all. She'd already been signed 
to EMI tbe year before, and this was about nine or ten months before 
she went into the studio to record her first album. So she fancied doing 
a little bit of live work for the crack. We got a small four-piece together 
with her on vocals. and started playing around the clubs in our local 
area, in south-east London, and we were doing all covers - things like 
Heard It 7hrough The Grapevine, Knock On Wood, Soul Man- and she 
was great, singing all this stuff'. This is where the fledgling Bush 
started developing her inimitable style, both audibly and visually. 'At 
that time she'd already started singing in this very high-pitched voice, 
but she could really belt it out. I thought this girl was so slim - there 
was nothing of her - but you put her on stage and she was into the 
whole thing. We started doing some of her songs - we did the 
embryonic version of James And The Cold Gun, and she was doing all 
this stuff with the gun, out in the audience - they just loved it. She was 
a total performcr right from the word go.  Had no problem with the 
confidence aspect at all, yet she'd never fronted a band before. She was 
an absolute natural.'

Del's enthusiasm for his musical partner's work is infectious. In 
contrast, Bush herself is reserved when it comes to anything except her 
music. Ask her about the technicalities of recording using her Fairlight 
computer system and she'll tell you exactly about how her songs come 
about. When it comes to explaining the stories behind the songs, 
however, or talking about Kate Bush, the person, she is uniquely 
retiring. But when it comes to her music, Bush has spent many years 
developing a skill for getting what she wants - a skill that she's
developed into a fine art. She speaks gently and slowly, picking her 
words carefully, looking almost frail and innocent as her expressive 
wide eyes stare in wonderment. But her delicate looks and tiny frame 
belie her drive and power - not many artists of any stature get to be so 
creatively in control as Kate Bush. For her, though, it is and always has 
been the number one priority. 'I think creative control is so incredibly 
important,' she says. 'If you don't have that control your work will be 
interfered with until it's gone out of your hands. I was always aware 
that things wouldn't be how I wanted them unless I was willing to 
fight.

Kate's involvement in what was known as the KT Bush Band was 
always going to be shortlived, as Del and his other musical 
collaborators realised, but they were happy to support her until that 
moment EMI were ready to whisk her off to fame and fortune. 'Right 
at the end of that period of playing the pub gigs in that band, we did a 
session for EMI at the White Elephant on the River,' he recalls, 'which 
was her first major showcase for the whole record company. It was 
quite nerve-racking for the rest of us, but Kate just breezed on and sang 
it. She brezzed through the whole thing - it was really quite amazing.

'She always had this total self-belief in what she was going to do - 
there was never going to be any problem for her, from her own point of 
view. It was like an obsessive passion that she just had to go through. 
And in a lot of ways she's still like it now.' Of course, after that it was 
never quite the same for the KT Bush band without Katy Bush, and Del 
and Co were left stranded in temporary musical limbo while Kate was 
studio-bound. At that stage, Kate was too young and inexperienced to 
insist they play on her debut - 'she had to toe the party line a little,' says 
Del - so the producer bought his own players in to provide the 
necessary backing. However, even then Bush knew what she wanted 
and how to get it across. He may not have played on her debut LP, but 
Kate made sure Del got to design the artwork for the back of the
sleeve, and that LP number two would have his name somewhere on 
the playing credits. 'She really wanted us to play on that album, but 
politically it wasn't right/he says. 'But when the second album came 
along in '78, we were able to do a few tracks - she really stuck out for 
us. I'm really grateful for that  she's given me, personally, so many 
breaks.'

Bush is reluctant to go into details on her relationship with her uniquely 
understanding record conapany. Although obviously appreciative of 
the artistic freedom she's gained over the years she also observes: 'You 
have to fight for everything you want. Struggle is important. It's how 
you grow and how you change.'

Caught up in the first flush of success, Kate's early days were a 
flurry of activity and creative release. In 1978, both The Kick Inside and 
Lionheart  albums were released, and in 1979 she embarked on her first 
and only, and now fairly legendary, live tour. 'As I remember it, it was 
very hard work,' says Del of the tour. 'I've never worked so hard as a 
musician before. We rehearsed for six months. In the morning she was 
coming up to town for dance lessons and learning dance routines, then 
in the afternoon we'd rehearse the band for six hours, then in the 
evening we were going back for production meetings. And she's still 
doing that kind of thing now with this film she's doing. She's a 
complete workaholic and a fanatic where her music's conecreed.' Did 
she enjoy the tour? 'She really enjoyed it. It's a common fallacy that she 
didn't and that it was a bad experience for her, but she really enjoyed 
doing it. But I think what happened was, it took so much out of her, 
that it also took a little bit of her self-confidence. She then got into the 
studio immediately after that tour ended, in late '79, to start the third 
album, and she then got into producing. She co-produced it with the 
engineer she was working with at the time, and got completely into it. 
She thought, this is it, I really need to work in the studio for a few years 
and develop my own production techniques and music as a studio
musician.' And Kate realised too that she'd have to distance herself 
from outside pressures to achieve what she wanted to achieve.


'I've always been tenacious when it comes to my work,' she says. 'And I 
became quickly aware of the outside pressures of being famous 
affecting my work. It seemed ironic that I was expected to do 
interviews and television work which took me away from the thing 
that had put me into that situation. It was no longer relevant that I 
wrote songs. I could see my work becoming something that had no 
thought in it, becoming a personality, which is never what I wanted. All 
I wanted was the creative process.' 'She's the most unlikely star,' adds 
Del. 'She does not like being famous, she really does not like it. She 
wants to be an ordinary person, but she wants to make music. She likes 
the idea of people getting something from what she does, but she 
doesn't want the fame aspect. She's not the sort of person who will 
ever go out clubbing. She just works, stays at home, goes to the theatre, 
goes to see films, and when she can she goes off on holiday. But that's 
very rare.'  It's hard to imagine Kate Bush padding around the house 
with her slippers on, but even superstars have to recharge their 
batteries. 'She really just lets herself go   I don't mean she puts on 30 
stone. It's like "I'm not working any more, so I'm not going to let any of 
this stuff get into my head". She potters in the garden - she does 
gardening now - she watches TV, goes to the theatre, eats... And takes 
in a little music too... 'She doesn't like to listen to anything when she's 
working, but when she's resting she listens to lots of stuff. At the 
moment, she's really into Talk Talk - she finds a real affinity with them. 
And we had a whole period of getting into this Bulgarian music, and in 
the early days it was Irish music. Generally, there's not many modern 
bands she's into, though she likes the Utah Saints. They did a track with 
a piece of her vocal in it: they were really good about it, went throngh 
all the proper channels, asked if they could use it, gave her a royalty, 
and she thought it was great. She thonght it was absolutely fantastic
the way they'd actually used it. In fact, one time she thought it wonld be 
great to do something with them. It never came to pass, though...'

What did happen was the extended period of inactivity that lead to a 
four year gap between the last album 'l'hc Sensual World, and the 
release of The Red Shoes. Beset bv personal tragedy - the loss of many 
fnends, the death of her mother and the breakdown of her personal, if 
not professional, relationship with Del- the creative process simply 
stopped. 'I just couldn't work,' she says. 'Singng is such a deeply 
personal thing to do, I couldn't manage it.' 'There's been a lot of upset,' 
adds Del, 'When her mother died, she really couldn't work for the best 
part of a year. But she soon got the urge to get back in there again. She 
has to work.' And when Bush works, she really works. Not content 
with producing just another LP, she's timed its release with the 
simultaneous release of an accompanying 5()-minute film 'We've taken 
six tracks from the album and made a story line up from the title track.'

'It's about how Kate's a dancer and gets tricked into wearing a pair of 
red shoes, which are possessed and can't stop dancing,' adds Del, 'it's a 
bit like the old film, 'l'hc Red Shoes  (the 1948 British classic about a 
young ballerina torn between two lovers - one a struggling composer 
the other an autocratic dance impresario). It's her own interpretation 
of the idea. There's lots of dialogne, and Miranda Richardson and 
Lindsay Kemp are in it too. Kate's been busy writing the storyline and 
getting it organised.'

'It's something like Magical Mystery Tour,' Kate adds, 'But it's not like 
it at all. It's not finished I hate talking about anything until it's there. 
like talking to you about the album if you haven't heard the tracks. 
Completely ridiculous.'

Never one to explain herself when a well-turned musical phrase will 
do, Kate Bush remains something of an enigma; intensely private,
guarded to the point of introversion, but always fantastically unique.
