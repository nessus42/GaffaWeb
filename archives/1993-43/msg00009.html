Remember, kids, this is just the first listen; Kate takes time to grow
on you.  If I posted this a month from now, I would probably give everything
different (probably better) grades.

But enough chit-chat, down to business:
Rubberband Girl:  It has a great beat, and you can dance to it.  Grade: A
And So is Love:  It works!  Now that I can read the lyrics, this song
completely wipes out anything The Smiths have done; Ian Curtis would be
proud.  Such a sad song, I love it!  Grade: B+
Eat The Music:  No one dislikes it because it's "commercial".  Everyone
dislikes it 'cause it's boring.  I happen to agree.  Grade: C
Moments of Pleasure:  Words don't do this justice.  Easily the best cut
on the album.  I *DARE* you to listen to this without a tear welling up
in your eye - it can't be done:  Grade: A+ and then some
The Song of Solomon:  Sounds like a Sensual World out-take.  Trio Bulgarka
are wasted.  It does have my new all-time favorite Kate lyric, though
(Yeah, you know it:  "Don't want your bullshit, yeah/ Just want your
sexuality").  Grade: C+
Lily:  Huh?  I'll give this one time to grow on me.  I think I like it.
For now, Grade: B-
The Red Shoes:  Answers the eternal question, "What would happen if
George Clinton produced Steeleye Span"?  I didn't like it at first
listen, but it's starting to grow on me.  Grade: B
Top of the City:  Good song.  'Nuff said.  Grade: B+
Constellation of the Heart:  Commercial.  I don't mean that as an insult,
just an observation.  It's catchy.  I like it.  Grade: B
Big Stripey Lie:  GREAT song, but you knew that already.  Grade: A
Why Should I Love You?:  The only real "yuck" on the album.  Commercial,
and I *DO* mean that as an insult.  Can you say "Adult Contemporary"?  Grade: C-
You're The One:  Yet another really sad song.  The only cut where Trio
Bulgarka AREN'T wasted.  Grade: A

Overall grade: A-  (If MOP wasn't on it, it would be B+)

- Stev0 the One

"Life is sad, and so is rec.music.gaffa" - New Theme Song?
