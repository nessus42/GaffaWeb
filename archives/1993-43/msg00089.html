&gt;Just got a postcard from Opal Information. It states the following:

&gt;Brian Eno Box Sets I &amp; II
&gt;Anyone have any additional information like track listings, etc.

This has been discussed a lot on the new Eno mailing list:
Subscribe / Unsubscribe requests to Eno-L-Request@Udlapvms.Pue.Udlap.Mx

The main thing that it will contain are the tracks from the aborted My
Squelchy Life that didn't make it to Nerve Net.  I'll be buying it for those unreleased tracks.  I don't but collections with no new music.

Here's a relevant posting.  Further discussion should go to the Eno
list.

A brief release from Virgin America crosses the desk, and a bit of
interlinear reading at this point leads me to suggest that I'm pretty
sure that I know what the "unreleased" material" on Eno box 1 pretty
much *is*. I'd be happy to correct this one later, of course.

The release mentions that both "Wimoweh" and "7 Deadly Finns" are
in the box, which is said to "feature" fork from the first 4 albums,
with 6 tracks from "My Squelchy Life" rounding out the new material
on disc #3. If my memory is correct, that ought to just about bring
us up to the 40 or so minutes of "new" material in the box.

Two of the cuts from "My Squelchy Life" have already been released
for general consumption - "I Fall Up" (from the "Ali Click" single)
and "Under" (from the "Cool World" soundtrack). Additionally, last
year's WEA Christmas compilation included a mislabeled Eno track;
"Mark of Distinction" lists the track as "Tutti Forgetti", when it's
actually "The Harness."

Subtracting the singles [a questionable assumption] and subtracting also the
short piano piece "Little Apricot" from MSL - which wouldn't be on the
box - we wind up with:

The Harness
Stiff
Tutti Forgetti
Over
Everybody's Mother/Step Up (which I like quite a lot)

which might mean that we also include "Under" from "Cool World". That
might add up to a substantial number of the new tracks, might it not?

The press release also mentions that the material from "Music for Films
Volume 2" which didn't make it anywhere else will also appear on box
1 [which is nice. I'd like to have "Approaching Taidu" on CD. Now, will
they also have an attack of good sense and include "Mist/Rhythm" from
the Rarities box?].

Of course, I suppose we'll also be seeing "RAF", as well.

The liner notes are done by Paul Morley - an interesting choice, since
he used to take folks to task for their ah, lack of ideological purity
_from time to time. I was expecting Rick Poynter or perhaps (ahem) C.F.J.
Bofop....

More on this later.

With regards,
Gregory
