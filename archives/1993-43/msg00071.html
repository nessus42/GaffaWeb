Mortimer (he said I could call him that) Drewcifers:

&gt; Also, (to the folks on Love-Hounds) could we cool it on the TSW-bashing? 
&gt; The Sensual World introduced me to Kate and, unlike many, it seems, I adore
&gt; it.  We've heard it all before.  Let's can it.  Thanks.

It won't do any good, saying things like that (TSW-bashers are very vocal)
but you're not alone in loving TSW. I adore it too. Always have, always 
will. 

&gt; A few other notes: pick up the new Concrete Blonde album (Mexican Moon).  A
&gt; solid, skillful album.  It makes up for a lack of truly remarkable songs
&gt; with an array of just plain terrific ones.  Highly recommended, after just
&gt; one listen! 

Agreed again! Though I have favorite songs on all their albums, as a
whole this one is my favorite.

&gt; The new Cocteau Twins isn't half bad either, although they
&gt; usually only appear when I need ambience, when I have a headache, or when
&gt; I'm burning candles.

I'm mad at them and refuse to pay full price for this album. I'll wait
until I see it used. I made the mistake of reading a recent article and
they (Liz especially) wasted time and print space talking trash about
the album _Treasure_. Why do artists do that? It's more than the fact
that Treasure is what got me into CT, it's still my favorite album and
I love it dearly. It has to do with artists being mature enough to
accept what they've done in the past (they liked it enough to release
it at the time. If it's such a "bad" album now, it must have been "bad"
then and they shouldn't have released it if they weren't pleased with it)
and not letting critics and interviewers shape their thoughts about it.
So what if a**hole music writers keep bringing up the album as the one
that gave the band (mainly *because* of music writers) a reputation as
being an airy-fairy band? The band should be ranting against the critics,
not the album. The album was what it was, it's what they were doing at
the time, tons of people loved it, and the band went on to make other,
different albums. Most of all, trashing an album that is loved by many
people is parallel to trashing the fans who love that album. I completely
lost all respect for Phil Collins long before he became a "character"
mainly because he talked a lot of trash about the early Genesis albums
he was involved in. Maybe it is frustrating to keep hearing people
bring up the "old stuff" but when he called it all crap, it was a direct
slap in the face to me personally. What I mean is that, to me, good music
is good music no matter how old it is and he said something like "how can
anybody still like that old shit?" I loved it then, I love it now, and
I'll always love it. Not to mention that my Genesis fandom led me into
so much other music, most notably, Kate (and from her, Jane, Happy, Tori,
Sarah, and hundreds of others.)

People still listen to Bach, right? It's "old stuff" too. (No, I'm not
comparing early Genesis to Bach) I just think that artists should
think about who they're affecting when they start trashing their "old
stuff" because they're mostly affecting fans who supported them during
the time they released the album they're trashing, and fans who discover
the album(s) years later and get into the music.

Kate came way too close to trashing her early albums in a recent 
interview and it made me very uncomfortable. She doesn't have to,
intelligent people understand that those albums were recorded a
*long* time ago and that each album added to the growth process.
She couldn't have made TRS in 1978. She made TKI. It's there,
forever, and many people loved it then and many people love it
now. As far as _Lionheart_ goes, *I* love it, and I don't really
care that it was rushed and pushed. If she could have had more time,
she probably would have done some things differently. She didn't, and
couldn't, and Lionheart is what it is, as is. There *are* people who
love it, or much of it, and there's no need for her to go back and
trash it. Ah well, I just hope she keeps that "load o rubbish" kind
of talk to a minimum.

(Ectophiles, I've had conversations with Happy about this and she has
a great attitude about her early work. Not speaking for her, but I
personally doubt we'd ever read/hear her trashing her early music.)

So anyway, to end this rant, I just wish the Cocteau Twins would shut
the F**K up about how much they hate Treasure. That's all.

Vickie (who won't say a *word* about individual songs on TRS until I've
heard it a few dozen times)
