Last night I finally had a chance to listen to my new CD copy of
TKI.  I am both pleased and displeased.  A lot of the synth,
strings, and percussion bits are more readily discernable than they
were on the vinyl, I think because of the laser technology.  It
makes you more aware of the complexity of the music and more
appreciative of Kate's genius.
  Unfortunately, the disc has been completely remastered (as I think
somebody said here before).  The drums and especially the bass have
been thrust way up, to the point where on many tracks they begin to
drown out the rest of the music, thereby defeating the effectiveness
of the laser technology kudoed above.  What is especially horrible
is that KATE'S PIANO is one of the first things to go missing.  Also
the sustained guitar solo in "Wuthering Heights" that, IMO, makes
the song.
  TKI was always a little heavy on the bass (especially "Kite" and
"Them Heavy People"), but now it is ridiculously so.  To the
person who said that they listen more to the quality of the music
than to how well it was recorded:  in this case, I would love to
listen to the music, because it is so wonderful, but the mix is
getting in the way.        -- Ottis
