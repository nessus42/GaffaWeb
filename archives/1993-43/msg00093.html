Hi everyone,

My first time on this list and an exclusive rightaway! This
(translated - I figured most of you're not too good in reading
Dutch) review is from the local newspaper from The Hague,
Netherlands (where I live). 
Here it comes:
KATE BUSH 'Red shoes'[sic] - EMI
One hears so much pain on 'Red shoes', Kate Bush' first album in
five [sic] years. "I feel like life has blown a great big hole
through me", sings the English musician in 'Lily', and that a
little what happened. The recent dying of her mother Hannah, to
whom the album is dedicated, and the separation from her childhood
friend Del Palmer, who *is* still involved in the productionprocess
(en probably will be in the future), can be heard in a series of
emotional compositions. She presents a broken heart, which doesn't
leave the listener unmoved, like in the 'bare' 'Moments of
pleasure', in which her glorious voice, plunged in piano and
orchestra, uses a series of notes touched by emotions. [Bad
translation, I think. He means that the notes she sings are
sounding like they were gnawed by her tears, or something like
that]
There are references to God in the erotic 'Song of Solomon', but
the most fragile Kate can be found in 'You're the one', which deals
directly with the separation. Her feelings of despair are coloured
by the Hammond-solos of Gary Brooker, the guitar of Jeff Beck and
the weepsome backgroundvocals of the Trio Bulgarka, who are placed
less on the foreground on 'Red shoes' than on 'The sensual world',
but who are more impressive. 
Kate Bush is no longer busy making musical sketches, but paints
without lay(er)ing notes too thick. Bright compositions arise this
way, which show a rich form of 'world music' , without ever losing
the Bush-stamp. The jigs and reels in the cheerful title track for
instance, the by folkmusic of Madagascar influenced 'Eat the music'
or the multi-voiced question/answer-game in the merry
'Constellation of the heart'. 
That the musical content of 'Red shoes' is being taken care of by
the 'creme-de-la-creme' of the music industry says a lot about
Kate, but it also provides a balanced musical decorum, in which
only Prince (in 'Why should I love you') may have had too much
space.
By Hans Pi	t.

From: Haagsche Courant, 5th November 1993.

I must say this is a good review; I could've written it myself.
However, watch this space, 'cos I am reviewing it as we speak. My
thoughts on this x-cellent album will come soon, as well as an
short introduction of myself. Just thought you'd like this article
now...

Greetings all...
