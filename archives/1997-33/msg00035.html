It's one thing to appreciate a song differently, it's quite another to map
a comepletely different meaning onto a song and claim that such a thing is 
there.

By a simple coincidence of phrases, this happens to often be misinterpreted
as a reference to homosexuality, even though nothing esle about the song
suggests it.  To say that the reluctance to accept a differing interpretation
is due to homophobia is silly.  If I say that Mariah Carey's "Honey" is really
about Winnie The Pooh, even though I may beleive it, doesn't make it any more 
so, and would make me look like a loon in the process.

Deluding yourself that the song is about Peter Reich coming out of the closet
is one thing.  Calling others homophobic because of that is double delusion.

Viel Gluck!
