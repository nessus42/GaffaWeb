&lt;I don't think they are people who may feel that "Your son's coming out" refers
 to homosexuality.   As I typed last time, people should be given the freedom
 to interpret songs how they wish....I am absolutely sure that Kate Bush would
 be horrified to know that every one of her fans interpreted a particular song
 exactly the same way!! &gt;

Just curious...how can you be absolutely sure? Have you spoken to her
 personally and asked?  Not only do her printed interviews state otherwise,
 I've interviewed her three times and never encountered the "horror" you
 describe.  It's a small point, but if you're striving for authentic
 information, you're not suceeding.

&lt;... The whole point of music (including lyrics) is that every person on this
 planet has a personal feeling - or unique interpretation - about a song he/she
 hears.&gt;

Granted, everyone has an interpretation of a song. But Kate fans usually
 network with each other and read quite a number of interviews she gives to the
 media.  Therefore, they fans are exposed to Kate's thoughts on the songs she
 writes.  Since she's explained the meaning (specifically) to "Cloudbusting"
 not one but many, many times, it's evident what the song is about.  It's only
 if you haven't read anything she's said, do things become less clear.  She has
 gone on record many times that the song is about The Book of Dreams.

&lt; It is a worry that homophobia is prompting some people on this list  to send
 their self-righteous views on what the "correct" way of interpreting the song
 is.  I personally know what the song is about, and I also don't believe that
 Kate is gay, *however*, when I listen to the song I still like to interpret
 the song as though a son is 'coming out' (i.e. as gay) to his father.&gt;

Perhaps you're slanting the issues and the way you think because of your views.
  Perhaps the views you view as "self righteous" are  simply opinions that
 don't parallel your own.  You're free to think what you wish. You can believe
 anything you wish, that's what imagination is all about!
