Boris Chen was very quick in responding to my thoughts on Tori Amos, however:

I wrote:
I'm not a regular subscriber to the newsgroup, but I have been reading the
reports of Tori Amos with interest, and will probably buy her CD. 

Boris wrote:
I hope this doesn't mean that you've never listened to TA's songs. One can't
make a good assessment of someone's music by descriptions by others.

I stated I will probably buy her CD - for myself.  Obviously I've heard her
music through friends' copies.  I could hardly make an assessment based on just
reviews!!


Again, I wrote:
What a statement!  Repression?  Sorry, but this 'girl child' recalls a
childhood where all thoughts and feelings were accepted, as a form of her
growth, and she was often given help to deal with them.

Boris wrote:
I believe that Melissa was speaking about how females in general are raised in
modern culture, not about every individual case.

And that's exactly why I wrote what I did!  Everyone's perception of modern
culture, and how they've been accepted or otherwise into that culture is
tremendously different.  I felt that Melissa was making a very general
statement, and that is not always very wise.
