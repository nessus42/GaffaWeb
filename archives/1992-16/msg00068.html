&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ed asked if Tori is left-handed.  Yes, she is- and left-footed too, as is
&gt; obvious when watching her play the piano, since she hits the pedals with
&gt; her left foot.  And when she signed my CD she had my Sharpie in her left
&gt; hand... :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... if I were willing to let the "Tori's a witch" thing go even farther
&gt; than I already have, I could make something out of this, and her red hair,
&gt; too.  Many people throughout history have been burned as witches for being
&gt; left-handed and/or having red hair.  It's the mark of the Devil, you know!
Merry Met!
 
   I don't know if Tori is a Wiccan, but let me put it this way, if you 
think Blacks and other visible minorities have it hard in the States, you 
should try being a Witch or Pagan of some flavour! I am both a Pagan and a 
Witch, and can tell you about some major horror stories of how we have been 
persecuted recently (like in the past year or so even!), and how we have at 
times been denighed our basic human rights! Hey, this is not in a third 
world dictationship, this is  in the U.S. of A! About the only person who 
has publicly acknowledged that they are Wiccan is Stevie Nicks. But she and 
Fleetwood Mac are big enough that the Fundies cannot hurt them. A new Artist 
(relativly) like Tori could have her career squashed if some Fundie 
organization decided to have a "witch hunt"...even if she isn't Craft!
 
Blessed Be,
     Farrell
