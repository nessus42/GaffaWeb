Regarding some of the differences between Kate and Tori, I think
the similarities become much greater when you look at some of
the songs on "The Cathy Demos".  Besides the focus on the piano,
there is a striking similarity in some of the topics.  In particular
the feelings about religion and about sex.  For example, consider
"The Craft of Life/Love":


The Craft of Life [Love?]
 
 I tried to study it for just a while:
 All of the potions, from oysters to seducing smiles.
 But I've found it's already inside me:
 A big warm bubble of sensuality,
 There to be burst,
 But (I'm) worried about getting hurt.
 
     I know how you like to kiss.
     (I'll ask you) what you're thinking.
     Soul burns, and I don't care.
     The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish.
 
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          Oo-ooh...
 
 Tears spring to mind when I go back in time.
 All those lost bodies just seeking security.
 Jittering strangers with sweaty [smutty?] hands,
 Heavy and clever and full of demands.
 Well I'm similar to you:
 We're familiar with what to do.
 
     I know how you like to kiss.
     I'll ask you what you're thinking.
     (Soul) burns, and I don't care.
     The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish.
 
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          Oo-ooh...


and "Disbelieving Angel":

Disbelieving Angel
 
 So much for all the prayers you've learned.
 They are no help to basic needs.
 And all the worlds they've shown you
 Just make you even greedier.
 
      So what about divinity?
      I'm further away than before.
      You're like two stars colliding,
      And you're never going to hit the floor.
 
 Why should I whisper in the church?
 Because they say it's sacred ground?
 Oh, my sacrilege would do you good.
 You see, there's nothing here, I've found.

      I feel so sorry for you,
      Believing because they control.
      And of all the guardian angels
      They chose me to save your soul!
 
 Oh, I'm just trying to explain,
 I'm a disbelieving angel.
-----------------

Other songs with a sexual content  are: "Snow", and 
"I don't see why I shouldn't".    These songs seem to
reflect more of a personal aspect of Kate than her
later songs.
