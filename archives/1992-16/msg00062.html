Hmmm, strange title...

Any way... Hi all,

    About 4 months back I re-joined Australian Youth Hostels and at the time it 
got me thinking about my trip to England and the KonveTion. So I wrote a letter 
with my re-subscription saying something like how much I enjoyed my trip went to 
the Konvention and just generally had a great time. Well next thing I know my 
letter got published in the National YH journel under the title "YHA helps me 
meet Kate Bush". I thought that was pretty nice BUT now things have turned out 
even better because since then a number of people who read the mag have written 
to me saying how they are KT fans and want me to tell them all about it. I've 
gotten a number in touch with KBC, HomeGround and DreamTime but none yet have 
made it onto Gaffa. Has anyone else had the same kind of thing happen to them??

    Moving on to Tori Amos things... I just got my hands on the Winter casset 
single. I was trying for the cd5 BUT all the local dealer could find was this 
thing. It came in a plain brown box with her picture from the CD cover lacquered 
onto the top. Within it was FULL of crushed stirafoam (to look like snow) On top 
was a snowman christmas tree decoration, under that was the Winter casset 
single, under that was a free pass to the "Earth Exchange" a museam in Sydney 
and on the bottom was the Little Earthquakes casset. cost me about Aus$20.

- Graham
