&gt;Really-From: tim@toad.com (Tim Maroney)
&gt;Wilhelm Reich was one of the three main post-Freudian psychoanalytic
&gt;theorists, the other two being Adler and Jung.
  [There follows a discussion of his early (and uncontested!) work,
   wholly unrelated to orgonomy which is the only topic of discussion,
   I thought.]

&gt;Wilhelm Reich was killed for scientific heresy, and that is the part of
&gt;his story that Kate Bush deals with in her excellent song
&gt;"Cloudbusting".
   
Compare and contast with IED.

&gt; In the late 1950's, Reich was arrested
&gt;by US government agents for publishing unauthorized medical books based
&gt;on his research into orgonomy.  All his books, including his
&gt;psychoanalytic books from earlier in the century which contained no
&gt;orgonomic references, were burned.  Reich never left prison; he died of
&gt;prison sickness less than a year later.  The episode is a shocking and
&gt;disgusting one in the history of the country, and that the scientific
&gt;community did not object to Reich's execution for heresy is a powerful
&gt;discredit to that community.  To dismiss or trivialize it on the
&gt;grounds that Reich had become a crank is to endorse the execution of
&gt;heretics.

Reich was not just a crank; we do not arrest cranks -- there are not enough
jails.  Reich was proposing dangerous medical treatments.  Perhaps the case
was mishandled by today's standards, but I do not think so.
I, personally, believe more quacks should be prosecuted; witness the rash of
misery-mongering AIDS remedy peddlers.  Its even worse for cancer patients.

Reich was not even a minor martyr.

&gt;An excellent and skeptical biography of Reich can be found in the Readers
&gt;and Writers series of "Beginners' Books", entitled "Reich for Beginners".
&gt;Serious students should also examine his "Mass Psychology of Fascism" and
&gt;"The Function of the Orgasm".

Serious students of what?
(H. G. Wells reviewed `Function' by saying it is `an awful gabble of 
competitive quacks. Reich misuses every other word.... There is not a gleam 
of fresh understanding in the whole bale.')
For a reliable biography is `Fury on Earth', by Myron Sharaf.
