 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: Mailbag: _TWW_ and non-LP-trax CD

 &gt;  Give me these moments back
 &gt;  Give them back to me
 &gt;  Give me them little kisses
 &gt;  Give me your ???
 &gt;
 &gt;All right, Love-Hounds, what is it? And where can I get it!?!? The tape
 &gt;is terrible. The record the station was playing was badly scratched at
 &gt;the beginning. Thanks in advance...
 &gt;
 &gt;-- Mike

     The song is _This_Woman's_Work_, and it's found only in
the film _She's_Having_a_Baby_, and on the soundtrack album
from that movie. It's available on CD and laser-disk now, so
your station is pretty cheap to play a scratched vinyl version.
     All of the lyrics you quoted were correct except the ones
reproduced above. That part should read: "Give me that little
kiss/Give me your hand." Here, in fact, are the "complete" lyrics:


                    This Woman's Work


      Aha-ooh! Aha-ooh! Aha-ooh!
           "You'll have to wait in here."*

 Pray God you can cope.
 I'll stand outside
 This woman's work,
 This woman's world.
 Ooh, it's hard on the man.
 Now his part is over.
 Now starts the craft of the father.

      I know you have a little life in you yet.
      I know you have a lot of strength left.
      I know you have a little life in you yet.
      I know you have a lot of strength left.

           I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.
           I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking:
           All the things I should have said, but I never said.
           All the things we should have done, but we never did.
           All the things I should have given, but I didn't.
           Oh, darling, make it go,
           Make it go away!

 Give me these moments back.
 Give them back to me.
 Give me that little kiss.
 Give me your hand.

      (I know you have a little life in you yet.
       I know you have a lot of strength left.
       I know you have a little life in you yet.
       I know you have a lot of strength left.)

           I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.
           I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
           Of all the things I should have said, but I never said.
           All the things we should have done, but we never did.
           All the things that you needed from me.
           All the things that you wanted for me.
           All the things that I should have given, but I didn't.
           Oh, darling, make it go away.
           Just make it go away now.

&lt;*--'You'll have to wait in here.'  This is just a guess.
A few spoken words are audible here, possibly originating from
another part of the film's dialogue and re-used by Kate in her
recording.&gt;

 &gt;     IED: Can you post the address of EMI and the proper person to
 &gt;write to about a b-sides CD?  I think we should start a letter
 &gt;writing campaign.  I can't see any reason not to market a
 &gt;b-sides CD, even if a new album is due out.  It's very frustrating...
 &gt;
 &gt;...Let's let EMI know how we feel!
 &gt;
 &gt;-- bob

 Naturally, IED shares your feelings, bob, though he doesn't
really think such a campaign would do any good. There is one simple
reason for EMI's decision, and since it has to do with profits,
IED is sceptical about the power of fan-mail to override the
company's original decision. If a b-sides compilation CD were
released now, and then Kate put out KBVI within a month or two
following the compilation's release, EMI are afraid that the two
"products" would compete in the marketplace, and the full sales
potential of both would be stunted. There's little likelihood that
anything will change their view on that. Look on the bright side--the
b-sides abortion seems to indicate that they have real reason to
expect KBVI within the next three or four months!
     Anyway, IED spent a long time composing (no surprise to L-Hs!) a
many-paged letter to them enumerating every single non-LP KT track ever
made. He included _Brazil_, _Be_Kind_to_My_Mistakes_, _Maybe_, and some
tracks that are even more obscure. In all, he listed about thirty
different recordings that would belong on such a compilation, and
gave careful descriptions of each, including whatever information he
had about where to find the recordings, who had publishing rights, etc.
     A guy wrote back assuring IED that his letter was appreciated and
would be kept on file for consultation in the event that a non-LP CD
should be put back on the boards again in the future. If you can
think of any way of hurrying things along with more letters, all
power to you! Here is his address:

                               Steve Davis
                               Product Manager
                               EMI Records (UK)
                               20 Manchester Square
                               London W1A 1ES
                               Telephone 01-486-4488

     Good luck.
