Judi sez:

&gt;   Here are a few songs by other artists that I think would be really
&gt;neat if KaTe did a cover of them:

&gt;   "Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me" -The Smiths
&gt;                  (from Strangeways, Here We Come)

This would be neat.  I'd also like to hear her cover "Asleep," which is
one of my favorite songs (for some reason, my friends worried about me 
when I wrote the lyrics to it in huge letters on my dorm room wall a few years 
ago.  They didn't seem nearly so worried about my having the final paragraph
of _Wuthering Heights_ on my wall the next year...;-).


&gt;   ANYTHING from Songs From the Wood -Jethro Tull

Well, some of the songs, in any event.  I can't imagine her covering "Pibroch"
or "Velvet Green," or "Hunting Girl" I can imagine *great* covers of most of 
the other songs.  I'd _love_ to hear her cover "Jack-in-the-Green."

Hmmm.  What else would I like to hear KaTe cover?  "Strange Angels" by
Laurie Anderson comes to mind.  I'd also like to hear "The Other End (of the
telescope" by 'Til Tuesday (_Everything's Different Now_).  The original
has Elvis Costello on BVs (he cowrote the song) and I think I'd like to 
keep his BVs.  In fact, I'd be interested in hearing a duet between 
KaTe and Declan...  The other song I'd love to hear a cover of is Carly
Simon's "Fisherman's Song" from her latest release, _Have You Seen Me Lately_
(which, incidentally, is one of my favorite albums and everybody should
own it...:-)
