&gt;&gt; &gt; Short on goats, Richard?  Looks like you're trying to get someone's
&gt;&gt; &gt; goat here.  Perhaps Vickie will give you hers.
 
&gt;If I were a raving bitch (Hey!  I AM!), I might say:
&gt;Looks like both you guys are going ba-a-a-a-a-a-a.

Okay, call me stupid...how are Vickie and Steve acting like sheep?  Most
sheep metaphors refer to the sheep as being blind followers who have no 
lives or brains of their own.  I fail to see how either Vickie or Steve
can be said to fit into this theme based on their reactions to Richard's
post.


&gt;Everyone's
&gt;been ragging on various artists on this particlar subject, but
&gt;as soon as somebody Sacred to you guys gets mentioned, you get
&gt;all sweaty.  Lighten up, MANY artists have been made fun of in
&gt;this Kate Tribute CD thread.  Geez, you guys.  Get those
&gt;panties unwadded, they're strangling your senses of humor.

You seem to have been too busy raving (you *are* Love-Hounds occassionally-
friendly neighborhood raving bitch, aren't you?) to actually read Steve's
post.

He did not say that Richard was wrong to rag on either Jane Siberry or Happy
Rhodes.  He merely said that it seemed as if Richard was not making that
post to be witty but rather to annoy specific people--get their goats, as
Steve put it.

Yes, many artists have been made fun of.  Most of the 'jokes' were witty
and/or clever.  I didn't find either of Richard's comments to fall into
this category.  And it's not just because they both happen to be artists I
really like; I loved Angelos' comment about Madonna, and I love her stuff.
There have been a few funny comments about Sting and the rainforests.
I think Sting is a great musician, but I still enjoyed the jokes about
him.  There was a subtle dig at Sinead O'Connor that I thought was funny.

Try reading for content instead of material you can rave about.

(Who's trying to figure out what it would sound like if the Residents covered
a KaTe song...and is getting very scared at the very concept)
