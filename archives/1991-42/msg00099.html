&gt;I pulled across some Kate gifs from the archives and they are great!
&gt;Anyone know where I could get some Madonna gifs ?  I would like to
&gt;make a collage of my two heroes' gifs for my background.  Would
&gt;particularly appreciate some shots from "Vogue" and her pre-"Like
&gt;a Virgin" look.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

        You may be interested in this little Madonna tidbit.  One of my best
friends from work was on a cruise in the Carabean somewhere about three weeks
ago and was on some island.  He saw someone who he thought was Madonna, but he
wasn't sure.  He went up to her and asked her her name and she said, "well,
who do you think I am?", he said "I think you're Madonna" and she said he was
right.  He talked to her for about 5 minutes, but wasn't sure it was her until
one of her dancers came out and sat next to her.  He talked to her for a while
more and then said, "Hey, let me take a picture" and whipped out his camera. 
He said she FREAKED out and started screaming like a mad woman at him while
her dancer tried blocking him.  He put it away and yelled "Okay, okay" and put
it away.  She and her dancer ran into the resterant and slammed and locked the
door.  Everybody standing around just shook there head at him.
