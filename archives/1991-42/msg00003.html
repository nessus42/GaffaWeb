&gt;From article &lt;9111051750.AA00372@greylady.uoregon.edu&gt;, by stevev@greylady.uoregon.EDU (Steve VanDevender):

&gt; If I were a raving bitch like Richard Caldwell, I might have
&gt; written:

Really, Steve?  Do me a favor and take a peek at the post you were
replying to.  Did you happen to notice anything that read:

| Cynthia of Orlando
|
| ----
| Cynthia Rosas &lt;cynthia@bsbbs.UUCP&gt; &lt;{n8emr|nstar}!bluemoon!bsbbs!cynthia&gt;
| The Big Sky BBS (+1 614 864 1198)

I didn't think so.  Maybe you should take some sort of remedial news
reading class because that was not my post that you were replying to.
It is nearly inconceivable that you could have missed the header, the
signature and the considerable difference in style.

&gt; Seriously, Richard, were you going for a reaction?  If not, you
&gt; wrote awfully poor parody in any case.

It was a joke Steve.  Some folks even laughed.  I'm sorry you didn't 
find it amusing but you must remember that I'm working against my 
complete lack of a sense of humor.  Maybe I shouldn't have left 
the funnier bits out but I don't think this place is ready for a hardy 
helping of sacred cow on a stick.  We'll stick with the child's
portion for now.  You can let me know when you're ready for more and
I'll put on the cc list for some of my email correspondence.

Or maybe you just missed part of my original post.  Are you any better 
at finding punch lines than signature lines?
