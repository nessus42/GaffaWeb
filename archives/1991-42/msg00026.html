&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From Michael:
&gt;&gt; The cover of AVD is pretty bad as are 1/3 of the photos inside - especially
&gt;&gt; the candid ones. I don't like the photos where she is wearing a ton of
&gt;&gt; make-up.
&gt;
&gt;I agree- but what is AVD?

&lt;grin&gt;  It's obvious that your "agreement" comment refers to makeup, but
it's funny that you agree or disagree about the photos in a particular book
when your "What is AVD" question implies that you don't know which book
is being referred to...

_A Visual Documentary_

And yes, the cover is HORRID.

(btw, for anyone in DC, I noticed that the GW Tower has a few copies of this
book in stock, at roughly cover price)

&gt;&gt; videogenic? Her beauty, IMO, is only REALLY captured in her movement - but
&gt;&gt; there are, of course, many exceptions.
&gt;
&gt;...such as the cover to _The Whole Story_, and that photo at the end of the
&gt;Boxed Set (ooo, I said the dirty words! :) with her in her "Wuthering Heights"
&gt;dress, looking off into space... takes my breath away every time!

Of course, there are the two best pictures of KaTe, which are the TNW cover
and the Secret History of Kate Bush cover (which is by far my favorite
picture of her; it's unfortunate that so much of it is obscured by those
truly dirty words:  Fred Vermorel).  Is that picture available anywhere in
a larger format?  I'm particularly looking for one without the lettering.  I've
seen a postcard of it, but it was a reproduction of the cover.  Blech.

The WH picture you mention from the end of the Box Set booklet is pretty good,
but I prefer the actual _last_ picture from the booklet.  To me, it really
captures the beauty-in-motion that's been mentioned.  I have another picture
from that shoot (the Feb 1990 Musician interview), and it's nice...but not
nearly as interesting as the triple exposure in the booklet.  On the other
hand, it's a hell of a lot bigger than the tiny photo in the CD booklet 
(Grrrrr.  I love my box set, I love having the imports of the CDs instead of
a mishmosh of EMI America and EMI-Manhattan; I love having the photos and
I kinda like the case--none of my jewel boxes have any scratches or have
broken.  But why the hell couldn't they have packaged it in a REAL box with
a decent sized booklet?)

Jeff
(who just pulled out _The Dreaming_ for the first time in several weeks and
is pleased to be reminded yet again of what a brilliant album it is)
