Hi!

Jeff responds:
 
&gt; &lt;grin&gt;  It's obvious that your "agreement" comment refers to makeup, but
&gt; it's funny that you agree or disagree about the photos in a particular book
&gt; when your "What is AVD" question implies that you don't know which book
&gt; is being referred to...

Yeah, now I know to stop posting when I'm on drugs.  Affects the memory, not to
mention the syntax... :)
 
&gt; Of course, there are the two best pictures of KaTe, which are the TNW cover
&gt; and the Secret History of Kate Bush cover (which is by far my favorite
&gt; picture of her; it's unfortunate that so much of it is obscured by those
&gt; truly dirty words:  Fred Vermorel).  

Mmh, yes, the TNW cover!  The Secret History cover never did much for me- but
then again, the book didn't, either (I read that when I wasn't all that much
into Kate- one wonders if this was actually better).

&gt; The WH picture you mention from the end of the Box Set booklet is pretty good,
&gt; but I prefer the actual _last_ picture from the booklet.  To me, it really
&gt; captures the beauty-in-motion that's been mentioned.  I have another picture
&gt; from that shoot (the Feb 1990 Musician interview), and it's nice...but not
&gt; nearly as interesting as the triple exposure in the booklet.  

That's absolutely true.  It's a neat shot, but as far as losing respiratory
function, I still vote for the two I mentioned before.

&gt; On the other
&gt; hand, it's a hell of a lot bigger than the tiny photo in the CD booklet 
&gt; (Grrrrr.  I love my box set,
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ooo, somebody dares to say that around here!  I hope for your sake Chris isn't
looking!  :)  Seriously though, I love my box set too, simply because I only
had three of her albums on original cassette and the others as dubs
beforehand.  I got the set for Christmas, and it was neat to finally have it
all on CD- European pressings too, as they were bought in Germany.  I do,
however, understand why everybody is bitching about having to get the whole
thing just to get the extra two CDs, but for me, I have no complaints (except
for the fact that the instrumental to RUTH isn't on TWW II- grrr).
