&gt;I've always thought that _Mother Stands for Comfort_ was inspired by a 
&gt;1984(?) film called _Dead Zone_.  It was about a guy who got into an 
&gt;accident, woke up from a long coma, and realized he had possessed psychic 
...
&gt;film.  Has anyone else seen this film?

The film actually is based on the book "The Dead Zone" by Stephen King
(one of my (many) favorites of his). Hm, I forget exaclty when it was
first published. Anyway, I too would not be surprised at all if
"mother stands for comfort" were based on the characters of the
murderer and his mother.  It's just about two or three pages of the
book that it's mentioned (the relationship with the mother, and that
she *knew* and protected him, that is), but it's a _very_ powerful image.

Of course there are sure to be plenty of events/stories/situations
that could have been Kate's inspiration for it. It'd be very
interesting to know if this one is it though, as i'm a great fan of
Stephen King.
