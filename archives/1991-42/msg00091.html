This will be short.

With all the talk recently in gaffa about Two Rooms, I was VERY pleasantly
surprised to hear how AMAZING (wow!) Rocket Man is.
I heartily disagree with all you naysayers out there.
The Reggae-esque thing is fine.  I *love* the way she put
the words "rocket man" together without all that background stuff.
And I think she very accurately captures the mood of the song
which some of you say Elton John created but she fell short of.
It is a lovely version.

The weakest points of Two Rooms are certainly Hall &amp; Oates, and Rod Stewart.
I don't generally care much for Tina either.  But most of the rest
range from decent to very decent.  The Wilson-Phillips cover is super,
especially in the secand stanza where they hit those high notes.
I never cared for daniel that much, but I like the song alot better now
(even I'm a little shocked... is their album any good :-?)
I also like Come Down in Time, though I think mostly because I love the
song... but sting is good at that kind of thing.  And Sinead and
Michael put in worthy performances as well.  In all, well worth
the bucks.

BTW, I have gotten more comments from friends (who know I'm a Kate
fiend) about hearing RM on the radio than I can ever remember 
about any other Kate song.  This could do a good deal for her
exposure esp. if she hits us with the new album sooner than
later.  You and I and Rosabelle believe.

And to the person who said that Kate's covering Reedy River was
misguided, I say: keep listening dude and maybe some day you'll
see the light :-)  Seriously, though, LotRR is one of my absolute
faves on the TWW CDs... but *all* the songs there are superb
(except for ExIV, both versions of which have still not made me
like it.... it's really the one Kate song that just rubs me the
wrong way... I'm still waiting.)

Well, so much for brevity.
