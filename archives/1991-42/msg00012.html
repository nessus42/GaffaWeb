&gt;&gt;  A confession of a spur-of-the-moment conversation in a loud, crowded club
&gt;&gt; should not be judged by net-post standards. You were not at the convention
&gt;&gt; and, as the only report was my own, I don't see any basis for you to
&gt;&gt; characterize it as a tantrum. My statement was not judged harshly by the
&gt;&gt; Love-Hounds that were standing around Lisa and myself.
&gt;
&gt;You said that you made an ass of yourself.  You said yourself
&gt;that you got a bit frantic.  You said that Dave Cross suggested
&gt;that you write a letter of apology to Lisa.  Are you saying that
&gt;Dave Cross suggested that you write a letter of apology for a
&gt;reasonable statement delivered in a rational manner?  By your
&gt;own description it sounds like a tantrum to me.  If that doesn't
&gt;suit you we can just call it one of your turns.

While I did not witness the incident, I did meet Chris at the Convention
and he did not seem the type of guy to "throw a tantrum". I think
you have to bear in mind that Dave is British and Chris American.
The approach to making the box set statement is likely to be different.
For the typical Brit. like me, before one would raise the subject with Lisa
one would need to have been married to her for at least 5 years, and then
to do it in writing, followed by an abject apology for being so forward :-)
The American approach tends to me slightly more direct.

Personally, when we were asked to submit questions to Kate I really felt like
putting down "Why did you make us buy your albums twice?" Of course I chickened
out (not that they would have read it out anyway).

&gt;&gt;   The contents of the Box Set were entirely Kate's choice. The guy from
&gt;&gt; EMI lost Andy's list of suggestions and Dave Cross had to make up a list
&gt;&gt; overnight. Kate blythely crossed out any number of rarities that fans
&gt;&gt; would consider killing for (well, wounding at least) like "Maybe", the
&gt;
&gt; This Woman's Work is very much to
&gt;Kate's complete work what The Single File was to her singles.
&gt;
&gt;As I said, there are good, rational, criticisms of the boxed set.
&gt;Things like price (which is quite reasonable now that the initial
&gt;gouging has passed), the omission of some released tracks and the
&gt;lack of lyrics for the B sides, for example.  None of these things
&gt;make The Woman's Work a rip-off, however.

The price has not come down in the UK. In fact there has never been much
chance of getting it below list price since the major chains have ousted
most of the independent shops (at least outside of London and the major cities).
The set has to be a "rip-off" when the identical albums are being sold
 separately
in the bins at reduced prices! Even if the set is exactly the how Kate wanted it
to be the pricing in the UK was outrageous. I am speaking especially of the
CD set where a cost of c. #50 instead of c. #96 would have been more realistic
a lot fairer to the fans.

Be seeing you,
              Neil
