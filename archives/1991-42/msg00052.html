Several weeks ago we ordered the Hounds of Love and The Sensual World 
sheet music books.  While we expected to see photos of Kate in these
books, we didn't expect to see shots we'd never seen before.

The Hounds of Love book has the same pic on the cover as the album does, 
but there are several others, and a poster besides.  The poster is full 
color and is the photo of Kate under some sort of veil.  It looks like 
she's coming through a fog or mist.  There are four inset pics on this 
poster as well, all in color.  

There are 3 shots of her in a tweed jacket, 3 of the "pillbox hat" pics, 
and one very nice head and shoulders shot of her with her hair in a 
victorian style.  These are all B&amp;W.  There are a few other pictures that 
I didn't mention because I think most people have seen them.


The Sensual World book has most of the pics we've all seen for the Sensual
World, but there are three that I thought were especially nice.  The 
first of these is a color picture of Kate dressed in black pants and a 
black velvet top with gold embroidery &amp; sequins on it. As usual, she isn't
wearing shoes, and her hair looks very dark and very much like a lion's 
mane.  It's simply a lovely picture.  

In another photo (B&amp;W) she's wearing a black tank top and offering a
peach in her right hand.  Her hair is kind of wild.  No wonder Adam found 
it impossible to resist Eve's offer of the apple!

The last of my favorites is a small foldout color poster.  In this photo, 
Kate is wearing a simple black blouse and again her hair looks very dark.

We really hadn't expected these books to be such a find.  I was happy to
get the music, but the picture of Kate in the embroidered top makes the 
price worthwhile.
