Meredith, what'cha mean, "hope Chris isn't looking"? We not only love our
BoxSets, we love *both* of them! We bought the LP set fist, then Chris
got the CDset a few months later up in Canada. Sure we had complaints,
that doesn't mean we boycotted the thing. This is not as hypocritical as
we might be accused of. The LPs we bought for pure collector's value (not
that we'd ever sell it, that's not what we "collect" for) and the CDs,
well, we had to have the b-sides on CD. Plus, no matter how much we bitch,
 view is that by buying the Box Set, in whatever form, is helping to
support Kate, and give her money for the next album and tour. 

Sorry about theglitches above, bad line noise}

They still cost too much, we're not the first (or last) to say that,
and I don't blame Chris at all for voicing that opinion to Lisa. But,
we paid the price for both Box Sets knowing full well what we were
paying for. We wted them, we bought them They're sitting on the
shelf, and they look good sitting there. Actually, the LPs are right
under a poster of Kate and it looks like she's resting her elbows on
it. Cool. Anyway, we're not sorry we bought them There's no reason
in the world why we would have problems with anyoneelse buying it/them




line noise city, gotta go, bye.
Vickie
