I just wanted to second the notion that it would have added to Kate's 
considerable talents had she played live a bit more, and prehaps toured 
again.  As Len said, one tour at age 20-21 when you're new in the 
business and still finding your way, as it were, does not quite cut it.  
I have learned more about getting good sounds, what works and what 
doesn't for a given song, communicating with people, etc., from live 
performances than I could ever learn cooped up by myself demoing stuff.  
And that experience rolls back into the recording studio and makes you 
better.  Kate has chosen to isolate herself from that experience.  Well, 
she still makes great records, so it works for her, I guess, but knowing 
what live performance has done for me over the years I can't even imagine 
what she'd be doing had she not retired from the stage.

Let's face it, folks, Kate is a control freak.  Her whole creative 
process is very insulated and meticulous.  Live performances are 
controlled anarchy.  Things often misfire, and a lot of times you end up 
winging stuff on the fly.  I think this is the real reason behind Kate's 
decision not to tour.  She would rather not take the risk.

Before everybody lights up their blowtorches, being a control freak does 
not imply that Kate is a bad person, or a inferior musician.  Kate is 
unbelievably good at what she does, and I respect the hell out of her as 
a musician, singer, songwriter, and producer, or else I wouldn't be 
here.

Just one Love Hound's opinion -

John
