SPECIAL NOTE: You received this message because of your interest in
quality music. I appolagize for any bother this may have caused you if you
don't like the info. This isn't your usual junk e-mail though, this is a
calling to one serious good-time event :)

The 3rd Annual XocaToma Music Festival held in the beautiful mountains of
south central Pennsylvania is looking for A FEW MORE GOOD BANDS to round
out the days festivities.

Already scheduled to play:___________________________________________________
***JUPITER COYOTE***
Headlining the festival is none other than the boys from Macon, GA. With
over 60,000 cds sold, Jupiter is one of the hottest independant bands out
there. Their latest release, Lucky Day, got rave reviews in Billboard and
is moving like crazy. XocaToma is proud to present Jupiter Coyote.
***JIMMIE'S CHICKEN SHACK***
A long time favorite in Baltimore, these guys are rockin'! Watch for
Chicken Shack to take off big time as they are slated to play the infamous
WHFestival on June 1, 1996 at RFK Stadium. These guys are a very hype
alternative band!
***UNITY REGGAE BAND***
Another Baltimore favorite. Unity has shared the stage with the likes of
the Wailers, Eek-A-Mouse and YellowMan. Fronted by the ex-Uprising
frontman, Danny Dread, Unity delivers soulful reggae at it's finest.
***CYCOMOTOGOAT***
Cycomotogoat, a Hoboken, NJ-based three-piece power jam that often sounds
like five. Cycomotogoat mixes punk, jazz, blues and everything in between
and has played the H.O.R.D.E. Tour twice opening for acts like: The Allman
Brothers, Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow, The Dave Matthews Band, Ziggy
Marley and The Melody Makers, and The Black Crowes.This is the band that
John Popper hailed as his favorite for Rolling Stone last year.
***MEOW***
Meow is a vocal/bass/drums trio from NYC which augments its line-up with a
hired-hand guitarist and the occasional female backup singer. The group is
featured in the new "Best of CBGB" video and and have recently
collaborated with saxophonist David Murray."Meow makes the kind of music
that twists and turns from thunderous to eerie colm, yet retains its
melodic core."-Jim Caligiuri
***RYAN***
A Hagerstown, MD based alternative rock band that has a strong following
in the tri-state area. Energy and passion pound from the speakers as a
heightened sense of awareness overcomes all who listen. Ryan is returning
for their second XocaToma event after having a "kick-ass time playing for
the crowd last year!"
