&gt;  Hello,
&gt;  Disclaimer:  There are those that would be disturbed by this(nudity) but
&gt;there are those that would want to know: A skin mag titled Celebrity
&gt;Sleuth has the names Kate Bush and Tori Amos on the cover this month. 

   What's amazing is how few nude pictures of Madonna they featured.
I thought the Surgeon General sent out nude pictures of Madonna to
every US household several years ago.

   One very positive point about all this...it proves fairly conclusively
that there are *no* nude pictures of Kate. If the editors of this magazine
couldn't find 'em, they don't exist.

   Actually, I was quite surprised by the quotes they used. Somebody
there looked through the archives/Garden/Cloudbusting, as they used
the famous "I suppose the poster is reasonably sexy just 'cause you 
can see my tits" one.

&gt;  KaTe is just a copy in B+W of the poster in the skin tight workout suit. 

   It also features a picture of frizzy-haired woman holding a bass, who 
is definitely *not* Kate on the letters page, implying that this person 
is Kate. Quite silly. If my memory is clear, the image was from an early 
1970s "National Lampoon". The woman in the picture is an a-cup at the 
most.

&gt;  Tori is a photo from the Oz tour: seated on the piano bench w/out 
&gt;underwear.  Apparently mentioned in Aus. newsrags.  She *had* to know 
&gt;this would happen,IMHO.  

   I'd doubt the veracity of this picture if the booklet of her recent CD 
*didn't* feature her suckling a piglet.

&gt;  Liz Phair, Melissa Etheridge,Courtney Love and others are also present.

   One of the odd things is the *negative* comparison of Tori to Kate:
"She has to move an awful lot to be interesting; her sugary, commercial
tunes are affected affairs reminisicent to the worst of Laura Nyro and Kate 
Bush". Yeah, right...like anyone reading this magazine is the slightest
bit interested in music...
