As a fan of both Kate and Tori, I have noticed certain Eerie Similarities between these two artists.

1. Their names are both two words of four letters each, with two vowels in the same positions in the first name.
2. In the same year, each produced an album with a three word title, one word being a reddish colour: Under The Pink, and The Red Shoes.
3. The first single from Kate's album was "Rubberband Girl". The first from Tori's was "Cornflake Girl".
4. Cornflake girl drew some of its imagery from The Wizard of Oz, which features a pair of red shoes.
5. Tori's first band was called Y Kant Tori Read, which uses a letter to denote a word, as did the name of Kate's first band, the KT Bush Band.
6. The cover of one of Kate's albums featured her contorted inside a box. The cover of one of Tori's albums featured her contorted inside a box.
7. Their songs have had similar themes. "God" and "Deal with God". "Mother" and "Mother Stands For Comfort". "Me and a Gun" and "James and the Cold Gun". 
8. Tori recorded part of an album in Ireland, as did Kate. Tori claims an emotional link with Ireland. Kate is half-Irish.
9. Both accompany themselves on the piano, have wide vocal ranges and unusual singing techniques, have cultish fan groups, dye their hair red, are small-statured, and good-looking.
10. Finally, they are very nearly the only two female musicians to have newsgroups devoted to them.

Coincidence? You decide.
