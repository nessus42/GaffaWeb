&gt;Re: the joke that Violet told.
&gt;
&gt;I laughed. The people I told laughed. But the funniest part was the
&gt;reaction the joke received from the wider audience. Go on Violet, give us
&gt;another one and have us in stitches with the ensuing free- for-all to
&gt;follow ;-)

Now YOU must be joking!  I was so traumatized by the whole thing, I was
literally re-thinking ever posting anything here ever again!  Eeeeep!
Fortunately, I was reassured that most of you understand that a joke is a
joke and didn't take the thing too seriously after all, so I feel safe here
again.  I still do feel badly that anyone was upset, but I never have been
able to accept the whole
"you-can't-please-all-of-the-people-all-of-the-time" philosophy anyway, so
it really says more about me than about anyone else.  Maybe I'll tell
another joke in the future, but it will take a lot of courage, that's for
sure.
I am glad to hear that even friends of friends of LoveHounds are having a
laugh off of this one, though. :)

Special thanks to all who posted their feelings on this issue, both
publicly and privately.  Yes, even to Esther, who by her extreme reaction
only really proved that she must be one of the world's greatest pacifists,
which is not such a bad thing to be. :)  If only we could all be that
magnanimous.

Violet
