BTW:  a VRML 1.0 compliant section was
added for those of you who don't have
Netscape/Live3D.  It won't work as well
because the spin animations require that package.

&gt;Len, you have my respect! What a giant work!

Thanks Wieland.  It was a lot of work and is
my apprentice project in VRML.  Special thanks
to Wieland, David Benson, Lance Day, Andrew
Marvick and Rob Geiger for various kinds of help.  
Encouragement counted a lot because of the long hours.

&gt;I really hope, one of her friends will show KaTe what 
&gt;you've done. She'll be amazed!

Or she may sue... ;-)  That thought scares me a bit.
This sort of thing walks the boundaries of copyright
law, so if she wants it, it's hers.  Novercia can have
the whole bit as far as I'm concerned.  Otherwise,
the idea was to contribute to her cause.

&gt;I have to check it out some more, before I can comment 
&gt;on everything.  ("Everything?")

Yeah, well the nudes are hidden pretty cleverly.  ;-)

&gt;"Homeground Towers!" looks like Fort Knox to me. 

That's a side effect of using HomeSpace Builder, which
is a free VRML editor.  It's pretty  cool but it can only
do block shaped things, so one has to figure out how
to build a world that is completely square.  18 versions 
of it were done trying to figure that out last christmas.
The letters were done in another editor called Virtus.

Just so you know, Lance Day told me about the photos
of East Wickam on his homepage and offered them
for use.  I was going to attempt to model East Wickam
thinking it would be a real treat.  The problem is that
there aren't enough photos to work from that would
allow me to do a decent 3D version.  Lance's photos
are cool, but I started to run out of RAM, so I opted to
do the other things.  Now, when you go to HomeGround Towers,
(home of the Strange Twins), you are entering a Len fantasy,
again, not enough details.  I told Peter FM I was doing
this, and he said OK.  

Using Corel PhotoPaint:

1.  The sandstone walls are actually the pavement from
East Wickham's gate.

2.  The wooden roof is actually the fence.

3.  The shrubs are from the East Wickham gate.
Yes, that really is Kate's bush. (aghhh!)

&gt;Can I find all the 150 Cathy Demos here, Len? 

Magic is just too much to ask of a computer graphics
program.  :-)

When the new versions of the
software come out, I'll try to do some shockwave
and more audio.  The real problem is network
bandwidth.  This ought to be done on a
CD-ROM.  There is a snippet of RUTH hidden
in there, but it takes a long time to load across
the net.  As time goes on and I learn to integrate
Java, etc. there are some more fun things that can
be done.  However, at some point, my ISP may
get angry.  The animated strips really took some
space until I put them into gif format.

&gt;Thank you, Len! Let's follow her!

Thank you and all of the LoveHounds who
contributed.  This is time consuming, but not
hard so those of you who want to add VRML
to your kate pages, you are welcome to 
grab pieces of mine (the KT 3D symbol,
for example).  Go for it!  Then send me
links to add.
