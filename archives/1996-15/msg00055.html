KLN reports: 
"Snakes/Mna na h-Eireann", the second (Gaelic) half of which is a quite
popular  Irish poem. According to McKeown it's been put to music by several
people lately, "And Kate Bush even did it for a compilation that's coming
out soon." In case anybody cares (or better yet, can translate :), here
are the words as sung  by McKeown: 

Ta' bean in E'irinn a phronnfadh se'ad damh is mo sha'ith le n-o'l 
Is ta' bean in E'irinn is ba bhinne le'ithe mo ra'fla ceoil 
No' seinm the'ad; ata' bean in E'irinn is ni'orbh fhearr lei' beo 
Mi'se ag le'imnigh no' leagtha i gcre' is mo tharr faoi fho'd 

(To any would-be translators out there, it might help to rewrite these
words on a  piece of paper and put the "'" marks over the letters
immediately preceding them  here -- it's the only way I could type them
out. :) 

[Can anyone from Ireland please TRANSLATE this for us?]

=================================
KaTe:
...
I've just done a song for Donal Lunny who's putting an album together of 
traditional Irish music. It was fun and very challenging. 
The lyrics are in Gaelic so I will eagerly await comments from all
Irish-speaking listeners in particular. I'm sure Ma gave me a helping
hand!  
Much love to you, a very Happy Christmas and warm wishes for '96. 
Kate x  

=================================
Peter Chow reports: 
"This was quite a task as she does not speak any Gaelic. She started by
getting  some books/tapes on the language and learned to pronounce the
lyrics that way. Having recorded some roughs and practiced the lyrics,
Donal flew over from Ireland to spend a few days coaching her further on
the lyrics. He then left and she completed the track and sent him a DAT to
check if all was ok.  
Apparently, she had done very well as he only had to correct her on four
items before ok-ing the track. 
=================================
That's it.  
Best wishes 
    Wieland

PS: I'm very sorry for all the "=20" things in my Sinead-post. I have no
idea, where they come from. I hope very much, this didn't prevent you from
reading it! Just use a 'Find/Replace' tool. Thank you.
