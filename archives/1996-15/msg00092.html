&gt;   The followings is just a series of theories that may or not

&gt;(planets, constellations, etc), receiving from them its energy,
&gt;as a radio [A day of coincidence with the radio] receives some
&gt;sound wavelenghts or a jewel [mani = jewel] receives some light
&gt;wavelenghts.

&gt;   -  Among the ckakras there are "passages" connecting them that
&gt;some times are more open and some times more closed. Most of
&gt;times the "passages" among the 2 most perfect chakras and the
&gt;rest of the chakras are closed to a great extent.   

&gt;   -  The moon, through certain chakra, exerts a powerfull,
&gt;punctual, cyclical influence upon the human moods [Every girl
&gt;knows about the punctual blues], that varies according its
&gt;phases. It is strongest at full moon, weakest at new moon. At new
&gt;moon there tends to increse the opening of the "passages" among
&gt;the aforementioned chakras and the remaining ones. That allows
&gt;for the manifestation of certain Universal Law that, in turn,
&gt;tends to get in tune people holding certain affinities [ ... the
&gt;phase of the moon when people tune in; soul birds of a feather
&gt;flocks together] or, in a more technical language, sharing the
&gt;same archetypes. All of this depending on the grade of
&gt;"sensitivity" (please, note the quotation marks) of such persons
&gt;and only into a limited space and for a limited time. Here,
&gt;"sensitivity" means the capacity to receive, or to be
&gt;"impressioned" by, such archetypes. That brings about strange
&gt;coincidences that can't be explained just resorting to chance.

&gt;   Confusing?. Well, don't worry. After all, this is just a
&gt;series of theories.

&gt;   ..... Or not?.

&gt;This is all I could find, apart from the obvious reference Emmy
&gt;already pointed out. From Andrew Marvick's "The Garden":

&gt;     [The following is an interview with Kate Bush by Hot Press, one of
&gt;the few British music publications which seldom shows up in the States.
&gt;The interview was conducted by an anonymous male reporter for the
&gt;magazine in November of 1985. Edited and annotated by Andrew Marvick.]

&gt;[snip - TSB]
&gt;     "Right, well it always affects me. Every book I've read has really
&gt;affected me. It's that special, you do create a relationship, really.
&gt;And that was such a huge story...Oscar Wilde was one of my earliest
&gt;influences--his fairy stories. I could still read one of them--
&gt;definitely--and cry. Terribly tragic stuff."

&gt; Sorry to be dreary re your theory series deary, *BUT*...

&gt; Taken from Andrew Marvick's "The Garden":

&gt;     [Here are Kate's writings from the Kate Bush Club Newsletter,
&gt;issue Number 1 (January 1979). Following the article is a brief
&gt;"interview" with Kate, in which she responds to fans' written
&gt;questions.]

&gt;[snip to the interview - TSB]
&gt;    In Strange Phenomena, what do the words "om mani padme hum"
&gt;mean?
&gt;     "Club member Matthew Toreson has sent in an explanation, which he
&gt;found in an encyclopedia. It is a form of adoration of the Buddha, and
&gt;means, 'Oh, the jewel in the lotus.' Thanks, Matthew."

&gt;A quest:  woman seeks other women to jam with

&gt;Joan Galt is looking for some other women to jam with, somewhere in the
&gt;greater Washington DC/Baltimore/Frederick MD area.  Joan, who is in her
&gt;30's, is mostly self-taught (and always learning), likes to sing and
&gt;play her electric guitar.  Women of all colors, ages and types are
&gt;welcome to respond (agnostic and cynical tendencies preferred).  Note:
&gt;this is STRICTLY a musical thang!

&gt;Co-jammer requirements:

&gt;* Whacked-out sense of humor

&gt;* Must play some instrument well enough to accomplish something--
&gt;strings preferred, but woodwinds, keyboards and percussion are fine too
&gt;(unusual ok: theremins and zoomoozophones no problem).  Good strong
&gt;vocals are a plus.

&gt;* Must be willing to be totally fragrance-free for sessions (due to
&gt;allergic asthma)

&gt;* Art or design background a big plus--no lawyers or engineers, please

&gt;* Environmentally-oriented people preferred--especially ticked-off
&gt;vegans &amp; vegetarians

&gt;* No commercial aspirations--it's just for fun (but who knows?)

&gt;* Must not be afraid of "strong" language.


&gt;Joan's musical likes:

&gt;B-52's 
&gt;Gang of Four * 
&gt;Jane Siberry * 
&gt;Kate Bush * 
&gt;Peter Gabriel 
&gt;Brian Eno 
&gt;Portishead 
&gt;Alanis Morissette 
&gt;Crash Test Dummies 
&gt;Ofra Haza 
&gt;Thomas Dolby before he cut his hair off * 
&gt;Erik Satie

&gt;* but Joan was disappointed by latest recording.


&gt;All interested parties are urged to respond (*** via e-mail ***) with
&gt;location, talents and outlook on music, culture, life and the state of
&gt;the world...

&gt;This offer good for a limited time only, so act now!

&gt;&gt; As much as IED would love to share his most cherished
&gt;&gt; memories of the evening, he cannot, as he was kindly (but
&gt;&gt; firmly) asked by Del and Paddy not to describe the impromptu
&gt;&gt; post-screening party incident.  (Karen will remember, though, as 
&gt;&gt; it all happened at her place!)

&gt;&gt; John Light and Bill Wisner were there, though.  IED doesn't know
&gt;&gt; whether they were explicitly sworn to secrecy or not. . . 

&gt;You know, the whole evening I really wasn't convinced it was all
&gt;really happening to me - meeting Kate *twice* in one year just seemed
&gt;unbelievable.  We have Peter Gabriel to thank, of course; I don't know
&gt;how he managed to convince her to join that WOMAD festival but whatever
&gt;he did is enough to earn my eternal thanks.  Her set with the Trio
&gt;Bulgarka was easily the high point of a very hot, miserable day in
&gt;Golden Gate Park.  And then there was the concert Peter played at the
&gt;Oakland Coliseum a few days later.  It was a make-up show for one he
&gt;had been forced to cancel due to illness some months before.  I knew
&gt;in advance that Kate would be making a "surprise" appearance during
&gt;the show, of course; her people had contacted me beforehand to set me
&gt;up with passes.  But it was still terribly gratifying to hear the
&gt;awed cheer of the assembled crowd of 20,000 when Kate appeared on
&gt;stage for the duet in Come Talk To Me.

&gt;But getting back to the point: I also was "asked" to keep quiet.  The Bush
&gt;clan has always been very good at taking care of loose ends.  Really,
&gt;though, what happened there shouldn't have surprised any of us -- Karen
&gt;lives in a terribly small place.

&gt;&gt;Further to Vickie's note on the dangers of telling fake Kate-affair stories 
&gt;:),
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I was struck by the part of this note that said Vickie once spent some time 
&gt;&gt;on a chat channel arguing with some guy who thought Kate had a relationship 
&gt;&gt;with some punk rocker. Could this by any chance be Hugh Cornwell of the 
&gt;&gt;Stranglers?

&gt;  Actually, this was "in real life". The guy was insisting that it was John
&gt;Lydon (*way* unlikely - Johnny smells *terrible*. Kate smells very nice.
&gt;I don't believe Kate could have an affair with a man famed for never washing
&gt;his hair.) I've heard the Hugh Cornwall rumor before. IMO, this guy confused
&gt;the Cornwall rumor with the Vernoral article contrasting the the Catholicism
&gt;of Kate and Lydon.

&gt;&gt;(this part is true, not made up) I recall some stories about the time of the
&gt;&gt;first album that said Kate was indeed going out with M. Cornwell, but the
&gt;&gt;relationship broke up about the time Hugh spent a few months as the guest of
&gt;&gt;Her Majesty (i.e. in prison) for possessing some naughty substances.

&gt;    As far as we know, Kate and Del have been an "item" since the days of
&gt;the KT Bush band. So, unless they have broken up several times or she
&gt;is non-monogamous (unlikely IMO) any rumors of Kate relationships with
&gt;other men are simply BS. 

&gt;   Kate has vigorously defended her privacy. For years she kept her 
&gt;relationship with Del a public secret. In one interview she wouldn't
&gt;answer a question about "...who's yer boyfriend, then?" except to
&gt;claim that "...he's not a musician" in an appempt to misdirect the
&gt;speculation.

&gt;&gt;Reference to this rumour is made in the "Great Pop Things" cartoon (series 
&gt;&gt;that runs in the New Musical Express) that satirizes Kate's career.

&gt;    Where do you thnk the cartoonist gets his/her information? From sources
&gt;far less reliable than Love-Hounds. I answered a question in the Todd Rundgren
&gt;newsgroup about Will Powers/Lynn Goldsmith. I just typed in some stuff off
&gt;the top of my head and posted it. The poster responded that the information 
&gt;was exactly what he was looking for, and thanks. I wrote back offering more
&gt;complete information when I got back home with my copy of the record and 
&gt;the videotapes. He replied that he had to go with what he had as this was
&gt;for a column in Record Mirror and the deadline was the imminent.

&gt;   So, what I typed in was considered correct and published in the Record
&gt;Mirror. I was correct, but what if I hadn't been? What if I had typed some 
&gt;complete nonsense in an confident manner? Would I have received the
&gt;same response? Would the nonsense have become more believable
&gt;from it's appearance in Record Mirror?

&gt;&gt;Can anyone confirm/deny?

&gt;   Denying a rumor gives it more substance than simply ignoring it. Most
&gt;of the rumors of Kate-affairs are simply DJs and music writers refusing
&gt;to believe that someone as beautiful as Kate could be involved in the pop 
&gt;music business and not be playing the usual games (Mariah Carry's
&gt;marrage to the president of her label is a good example or Madonna
&gt;early relationships with club DJ's who could get her play). Kate's mother
&gt;and father were married till death did they part. IMO that tends to make
&gt;one seek the same sort of long-time relationship.

&gt;   The idea that Kate could stay with the same guy for years instead of
&gt;moving from boyfriend to boyfriend in furtherance of her carreer is
&gt;rather depressing to the average music biz hack. If she wasn't with
&gt;the same guy, they'd at least have a shot, y'know?

&gt;&gt; Was watching my Kate boot video recently (had not played it for years due to
&gt;&gt; the extreme poor quality). Well anyway there is one segment with Kate doing
&gt;&gt; Delius on stage in a kind of butterfly costume. I love this. The poor
&gt;&gt; quality gives it this dreamy/cloudy look which seems to fit the setting. The
&gt;&gt; mix also sounds different. There is a picture from this performance on Page
&gt;&gt; 11 in Kate Bush Complete.

&gt;A most excellent performance of this song.

&gt;&gt; Also on this video is Kate doing BABOOSHKA in split face make up playing
&gt;&gt; both characters of the song. Afterwards she sits down with a C&amp;W group of
&gt;&gt; guys who proceed to make complete asses of themselves. Kate looks very
&gt;&gt; uncomfortable and my skin crawls as I watch this. These guys are not
&gt;&gt; American and it seems to be their show on British tv. Who are these guys?

&gt;Sounds like the above two are from the "Dr Hook Special" aired BBC2 on
&gt;the 7th of April 1980. Well, Delius was also shown on the Russell Harty
&gt;show on the 25th of November too, as a tribute to the composer.
&gt;Sounds like you need to find someone who can copy you the LoveHounds
&gt;Collection video pair, it's on there (tape A 0:47:32-0:55:18).

&gt;&gt; I hope there are some musicians out there that can help me with this one.
&gt;&gt; When HOL first came out I was just learning to play the piano (still am, No
&gt;&gt; lessons). I love Under the Ivy and And Dream of Sheep so I wanted to figure
&gt;&gt; out how to play them,so I did. A couple of years later I found the Complete
&gt;&gt; Kate Bush. Well I had all the chords to Under the Ivy right, but one chord
&gt;&gt; on And Dream of Sheep is different than what I had been playing. "If they
&gt;&gt; find me racing white horses".
&gt;&gt; E bass with E,E6,F#m7,Bsus4. I have always played Bmaj over an E bass, not
&gt;&gt; Bsus4, and the Bmaj still sounds correct to me. Maybe my ear is not so good?

&gt;Well done for doing what you did, I'm not happy with the Complete Kate
&gt;music (which I've yet to find a real copy of), it leaves *much* to the
&gt;imagination, and not much in the way of actually dicating what to play.

&gt;On your chord issue, if other tunes are to go by, the pseudo dischord of
&gt;an Eb AND an E fits KaTes profile. Also a static bass non-progression
&gt;staying on E is far simpler than the steps going through E, F#, and a long
&gt;jump to a B, and since KaTe admits to taking the easy (so more pleasant
&gt;sounding and flowing) route in playing, I'd go for your suggestion of:
&gt;	E E6 F#m7/E B/E
&gt;instead.

&gt;Actually listening to my CD (as I *just* did after writing the previous
&gt;paragraph), you can clearly hear the static bass E all through that line.
&gt;You can also hear the high Eb going to E progressing to the next E chord
&gt;for the next line.

&gt;Trying it your (and I think KaTes) way, it fits the easier (nice flowing)
&gt;style, including the pre-emptive from E6 to F#7m, my guess is simply moving
&gt;the E to C# to go from E to E6, making the F#m7 a simpler change than I had
&gt;been trying before. Sounds "right" too!

&gt;Thank you VERY much,

&gt;			Bryan Dongray

&gt;PS I've never had a piano (or other instrument) lesson, but can play
&gt;most instruments I pick up within a short while (much to the instrument
&gt;owners dismay/embarrassment sometimes. There they are struggling for
&gt;weeks to produce a couple of notes, and within 10 minutes I'm playing
&gt;simple tunes). I don't intend to either! I guess I should do something
&gt;to improve my sheet music reading speed though. Anyway I understand
&gt;many artists have not had lessons either. I understand from a few
&gt;interviews that if they had, they would have followed the "rules", and
&gt;not produced excellent modern pieces which often break the rules, but
&gt;sound so right. Such as the above B/E which is technically dischordant,
&gt;and would not be "normally" allowed (if I understand some rules I
&gt;have read about writing music "properly" - stupid book).

&gt;by Peter Manchester (Peter? Come home!) several months
&gt;ago. 

&gt;   This interview is without a doubt one of the best Kate interviews

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Al Murphy was known to her as Smurf.
&gt;&gt;&gt;IED doesn't know where these two usually authoritative 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Kate Bushologists got their information from, but, on 
&gt;&gt;&gt;the contrary, the lyric sheet clearly has " 'S Murph", the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;contraction almost certainly referring either to "It's" 
&gt;&gt;&gt;or to "There's".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think I was to fast with my statement. Thanks for paying attention!
&gt;&gt;The only evidence for "Smurf" I could find were two LH mails deducing this
&gt;&gt;from the song, and HG 48 p. 5 where PDFM writes "Smurf". I vaguely remember
&gt;&gt;reading it elsewhere too, but can't remember where. I'm not sure
&gt;&gt;anymore. Chris, do you have any evidence for "Smurf"? I'm sorry about this
&gt;&gt;possibly false information.

&gt;   I remember the same HG. It *sounds* like she's saying "Smurf". And the
&gt;nickname "smurf" is a far better nickname than the rather pedestrian "Murph".

&gt;   Personally, I believe that she said "smurf", but that "Smurf" is a 
&gt;copyrighted name for evil little blue bastards, and she would have had to
&gt;get permission from the creator of said evil little blue bastards. So she
&gt;came up with "S'murph" as a way of wiggling out of a nasty copyright
&gt;fight. I'd imagine that she was unlikey to wish to get into one of those
&gt;after the "Sensual World" James Joyce Estate debacle.

&gt;   This is one of those questions that she hasn't been asked, and if
&gt;asked, is unlikely to answer. Is there a Level 42 mailing list or
&gt;newsgroups where Alan Murphy fans can be asked this?

&gt;Subject: Background voices on -eh- Lily

&gt;Hello friends,

&gt;Mandy "Pandy" Heath asked about the background voices of BSL:

&gt;&gt; Is it just me, or do I hear the background voices in Big Stripey Lie 
&gt;&gt; saying something like "No more funny cigarettes"? 

&gt;and Roy J. Smith added:
&gt;&gt;If you're talking about the voices at the 1:47 mark and again 
&gt;&gt;at the 2:39 mark, no, I don't hear "funny cigarettes" at all. 
&gt;&gt;Perhaps a Dreaming Plug(tm) would be of help here.  Anyone 
&gt;&gt;have one handy? 

&gt;Kerry White added:
&gt;&gt;I tried to make a Dreaming Plug, but once taped it won't fit. 

&gt;It's a bit tricky, yes. I think it only works with the big ones, not with
&gt;the small ones. 

&gt;&gt;However I 
&gt;&gt;have a surround-sound decoder, and OOP sounds are treated as back-channel.
&gt;&gt;I just turn the front-back knob to full back and crank up the volume. 
&gt;&gt;BSL at those times sounds to me like, "Big bad lie". There are a *lot*
&gt;&gt;of production levels going on, even 'back' there, and a solidly conclusive
&gt;&gt;determination can't be made,IMHO. "Don't smoke funny cigarettes" has too 
&gt;&gt;many syllables to be even close. 

&gt;You're right on everything.
&gt;I tried it with my Dreaming Plug(tm) and you can hear it much better than
&gt;the normal way. To me it sounds like "Beer that of" or so (Just what I
&gt;hear). What this could possibly mean? No idea. The first two I could hear
&gt;as "Big Bad" but "Lie"? It would fit perfect, but I just can't hear it good
&gt;enough. 

&gt;After many hard hours on lots of sites Mandy added:

&gt;&gt;Oops!!! When I said I heard funny background voices on Big Striey Lie, I 
&gt;&gt;actually meant to say Lily!! 

&gt;Hmmm, but I've already filed you under: "People who have absolutely not
&gt;the slightest idea what they are talking about."  :-) 
&gt;(But nevertheless a good opportunity to listen again carefully to "Big
&gt;Stripey Lie"!)

&gt;Okay, "Lily" then: I think you mean 2:59 and the following? Just after the
&gt;"Rrrrrh" sound? It's first: "This is my space!" What then follows: ????
&gt;It's either:
&gt;1. "Exactly. Exactly." or
&gt;2. "This is my place. This is my place." or
&gt;3. "This is left side. This is right side." or
&gt;4. "Whose at right?"(right speaker) "Whose at left?" (left speaker)
&gt;or something else... (even maybe "funny cigarettes").
&gt;I personally believe none of the above is correct. 
&gt;The other background vocal I can make out is at 3:25-3:27: some throttle
&gt;sounds then "...ex".

&gt;With the Dreaming Plug "Lily" is a trip! Really!!

&gt;Attenuator). Their newest weapon is a "Dimension-Folder" aka "George the
&gt;Wipe". (In case you're interested: It operates using isolated super-high
&gt;energy Superstrings of n+1 dimension. Coming in contact with the target
&gt;they collapse back into n dimensions and you're just - gone. Well not
&gt;completely gone, but turned into an elementary particle of less then 
&gt;1 E-39 m length, which is not very much.)

&gt;Once set out, even KaTe can't stop them anymore. 
&gt;And: They will win.

&gt;A messenger came:
&gt;"The Kateians are coming!
&gt; I've seen their cross in the west!"
&gt;...
&gt;They started the battle at dawn, taking the city by storm,
&gt;With horsemen and bowman and engines of war,
&gt;They broke through the city walls,
&gt;The Heathens were flying and screaming and dying,
&gt;And the Kateian swords were strong,
&gt;...
&gt;and when they saw East Wickham Farm,
&gt;they fell to their knees

&gt;writes:
&gt;&gt;&gt;The second syllable would be the latter half of a poetic pronunciation of
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;word "marche" (as "marche-euh", so to speak) -- a stylistic nicety that Kate
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush made sporadic use of in "Un Baiser d'enfant" and "Ne t'enfuis pas". 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It's been eight or nine years since my last class in French Literature,
&gt;&gt;but as I recall, the poetic pronunciation of 'marche' only applies when
&gt;&gt;the following word begins with a consonant or an aspirate h.  For example,
&gt;&gt;the phrase 'marche vite' (walks quickly) would be pronounced 'mar=che vite'.
&gt;&gt;However, 'marche avec' (walks with), ought to be pronounced 'marche a-vec',
&gt;&gt;since 'avec' begins with a vowel.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I hate to be nitpicky about this (as if no one were EVER nitpicky on
&gt;&gt;r.m.g.  ;) ;) ;), but surely Kate is more careful with her French 
&gt;&gt;pronunciation than this.  

&gt;   Ever since "Ne t'enfuis pas" and "Un Baiser d'enfant" first appeared
&gt;various French speaking Kate fans have been picking apart Kate's
&gt;pronunciation. As she's never lived in a French-speaking area (except
&gt;for the time at Superbear Studios recording Lionheart) we have no
&gt;idea how often she's able to use her French. I don't recall her ever
&gt;being interviewed in the language on any of the French TV shows.

&gt;   I don't know how much French she had in school. I'll have to assume
&gt;that it was no more than the average amount a typical English student
&gt;would get in a convent school.

&gt;   The only French-speaking Love-Hound who thinks differently is IED.
&gt;He is of the opinion that Kate's pronunciation is perfect and it's the
&gt;*French* who have it wrong, and need to change.
