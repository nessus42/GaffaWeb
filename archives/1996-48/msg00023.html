&gt;&gt;About a half year ago, I questioned if Kate was not a beautiful woman,
&gt;&gt;would all of you still listen to her music.  Seems as if the thread has
&gt;&gt;returned in recent weeks.  I'm sure that her good looks helps, especially
&gt;&gt;if one is to be an entertainer.  Whether you are attracted to men or women,
&gt;&gt;a pretty face is more appealing than a plain one.  I'm looking forward to
&gt;&gt;decades from now when she is crinkled as if an old apple, stumbling around
&gt;&gt;with a cane, hawking up phlegm after every sentence, to see if any of us
&gt;&gt;would still buy her records.  I sure hope we would!  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;See, yes Kate is naturally attractive, but she's more than just a pretty
&gt;face.  She's a damn good "character artist"--so many of her faces that we see
&gt;are the direct result of her creative imagination and artistic imagery.  Her
&gt;face is as unique as her music, but not necessarily because she was born that
&gt;way.  She creates her public persona and her physical features as much as she
&gt;creates her music.  And THAT is what makes Kate so utterly breathtaking.
&gt; Even when she's not "beautiful", she's stunning....(i.e., the monster of
&gt;Exp. IV).  I also look forward to seeing how her increasing wisdom and
&gt;maturity is revealed in her character.  It's sure to be a spectacular sight.

   The way she looks in "And So Is Love" indicates the depth her maturity
has given her.

&gt;Also, on the topic of Kate's possible depression....you may have a point,
&gt;Chris, but perhaps she's also just in an extended period of mourning, fully
&gt;experiencing her grief cycle, and not actually "depressed" per se.  I do see
&gt;your point, and agree with your evidence, but symptoms don't necessarily
&gt;predicate a specific disease, you know.  We're not experts.  We should leave
&gt;it up to them and let her deal with her depression without our ignorant
&gt;input, if that is indeed something she's struggling with.

   During the Convention, she was on-stage just long enough to say
"I hope you like the film" and then disappeared. But she had arrived
with Del, and he was there for quite some time. I suspect she was
in the back waiting for him during the auction.

    For interviews she adopted a "uniform" of a black leather jacket and 
sunglasses. She rarely wore sunglasses before...the only photo we 
have of her in them was an interview outside in the bright sun.
 
   It wasn't just the death of her mother. Kate lost several close friends,
over a fairly long period of time, followed by the loss of her mother. Is
"an extended period of greiving" distinguishable from depression, especially
when it covers many years? "I feel like life has blown a great big hole
through me", expresses a deep hurting beyond what I'd call normal
greiving.

   I fear that she is unlikely to get help.

   It's not like our discussion here has the slightest impact on Kate, the
hopes and fears of Love-Hounds aside. There's no evidence that she's
read the newsgroup, or that she would take it seriously even if she did.
She's aware of our existance, but I for one would be happier if she
*never* read the group. It's not for her...Kate is not a Kate Bush fan.

    But my belief that she is depressed is something I've refrained
from discussing for quite some time, but it seemed reasonable
to bring it up in the context.

&gt;Oh, and Chris...notice it was not me this time who brought up the "Is Kate a
&gt;witch" thread again?!  I'll never make that mistake again!  Enjoy.

   Heh. I was quite happy to see others defending the rationalist
position.
