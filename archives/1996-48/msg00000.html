&gt;&gt;There is my 2p.  Hope I did not offend any of you lot.&lt;&lt;

Xan


This is what I want know....who would take offense to anything that was
said?  It is a discussion on what kind of pop music someone likes or
doesn't like.  You didn't even say that Alanis was a horrible person that
would suck the life from Mother Teresa.  I don't even think Alanis would
be offended.  If I said I hate kate Bush &amp; her music, I wouldn't expect
anyone here (or KT hereself top be offended...I mean, why should she care
what I think, and vice versa, why would I care what she thought about me
and my art?  Well, I would love for her to say, "I love your writing Don,
write me a song to sing.....but anyway....) I was just proven terribly
wrong though (but, then, I knew I would be) when I went to the Tori Amos
newsgroup (that's rec.music.tori-amos I think) and posted Things I hate
about Tori.  A list os things that annoy me about Tori, and yes, I am a
HUGE Tori fan.  Nobody got it.  Nobody was able to offer intelligent
comments or was able to laugh at themselves. I was however called every
nasty name in the book. This is pop music, folks, put in in perspective,
but then again, why I am telling you all this.  I guess, I just thought
that was an odd comment to make and I am responding to it.  And there you
have it, my response to that comment.  The ravings of a lunatic.  


I hope I have offended at least one person


happy holidays

"and that, is that" said the little red horse to her rider.
