&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the interview section of the "Sensual World" video cassette there's
&gt; &gt; a short clip from "The Making of This Woman's Work" (&lt;- is the complete
&gt; &gt; film somehow/somewhere available?) which shows the whole set for this
shot.
&gt; &gt; It doesn't look like it's been flipped. You can also see a bit more of
&gt; &gt; the car, maybe someone can identify it there (i can't).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that "The Sensual World" video featuring extended 
&gt; interviews and 'Making of' footage was an exclusively Canadian 
&gt; product. I have never seen it myself, and have only the greatly 
&gt; shortened US version. With any luck, it may wind up as a branch 
&gt; of some future tape tree.
&gt; 

On the US VHS and US 8" laser disc of TSW videos, there's a very brief shot
of the studio where TWW was shot, but Kate is standing in front of the car.
 You can't tell what kind of car it is -- all you can tell is that it's
blue.  While the segment is being shown, Kate is talking about how making
videos was a natural progression and extension of her songwriting.

But on the 12" Japanese laser disc, there's an entirely different interview
and video sequence.  She tells how she scripts and storyboards all the film
sequences so everyone can visualize the intended imagery; and about how
Alfred Hitchcock is a great inspiration and influence to her and all other
film makers.

A completely different shot of the studio is shown as well.  It shows the
camera mounted on tracks, dollying to the right across the dining table,
car and stretcher scenes.  The car is in plain view -- Kate is not standing
in front of it this time -- but you still can't tell what kind it is
because it's strongly backlit by the "headlights" that appear in the final
version of the video.

After seeing this, you know that the car is real and it's truly left-hand
drive (the image couldn't have been flipped in post-production).  I can
only surmise that Kate intentionally used a left-hand drive vehicle because
it was the only way in which to make the video transitions from table to
car to stretcher seamless.
