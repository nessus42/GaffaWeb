&gt;Can somebody help me? I need to find out what film "It's in the trees,
&gt;it's coming!" is taken from, and who wrote the original story. All I know
&gt;is that it's from an old black&amp;white horror/ghost movie. Most likely
&gt;British or American. Was shown on Norwegian tv a few years ago!  A friend
&gt;of mine (and a devoted KateBush fan) was slumbering in front of the tv
&gt;when that terrified voice woke her up. Unfortunately, she didn't catch
&gt;the name of the movie. Please help!

The Gaffaweb Dictionary has this to say on the subject:

Night Of The Demon
A 1957 film directed by Jacques Tourneur, starring Dana Andrews and Peggy
Cummins, adapted from the M.R. James short story Casting The Runes.  A
classic horror film in which a professor tries to combat an evil cult
leader who can sentence his enemies to death through the use of a runic
scroll, given to his victims without their knowledge. Kate has said this is
one of her favorite films, and it has influenced her on at least two
occasions: the song Hounds of Love begins with a quote from a line spoken
in the film by Maurice Denham, and somewhat more obliquely, the film The
Line The Cross And The Curve borrows the idea that the possession of a
small slip of paper with mystic symbols can confer great power, as well as
borrowing several images and set pieces.

I think there's a bit more about this in the Dictionary, under related
entries.  The Gaffaweb Dictionary can be found, along with ever more neat
and useful stuff at Gaffaweb, the official website of rec.music.gaffa and
the LoveHounds.  The address should be given below, unless my sig is broken.
