A song about irony that contains NO irony . . . isn't THAT ironic!

Also, re: Kate and depression.  I was among the lucky people who got 
to meet her at Tower records in NYC the winter after the Red Shoes 
came out.  She seemed *genuinely* moved by meeting us fans.  She 
ignored the one-autograph-only rule and signed whatever a person 
brought.  A friend of mine was working there that day, and she told me 
that Kate stayed a good 45 minutes longer than she was scheduled to.  
Whatever her state of mind at the time, she was simply radiating great 
feelings on that particular day.

As someone who has suffered serious depression in the past, I honestly 
don't believe that Kate would have made the effort to visit another 
continent and, in particular, to make this kind of personal appearance 
if she were seriously depressed.  I also have to believe that she, as 
a person who once considered a career in psychology, would have the 
sense to get help if she were teetering on the edge.

And she does appear on the cover of TLTC&amp;TC video, and a couple of the 
Red Shoes singles, so I'm assuming she's okay.
