&gt;since someone was wondering...

&gt;       Hello and welcome to the Jane Siberry discography.  It is really
&gt;not a true discography as it contains various other information, such as
&gt;address, and a short intro to her work.  If you're new to Jane hopefully
&gt;the intro will give you a good idea of where to start, or to continue on 
&gt;the path you've started.  If on the other hand you're already a fan I 
&gt;hope that this discography will give you some info you didn't already know.

&gt;       Jane Siberry is one of Canada's premier singer-songwriters who has,
&gt;over the course of her five albums, ranged in style from folk ("Jane Siberry")
&gt;to snyth based pop-rock ("No Borders Here" and "the Speckless Sky"), to a more
&gt;lush sounding synth based art rock ("the Walking"), and finally to folk with 
&gt;country flavorings ("Bound By the Beauty" ( I hate labels but how else to 
&gt;describe...???)).  Her work is always consisently good and she has had the 
&gt;fortune to work with and assemble some of the best musicians in Canada.  
&gt;..so here we go...

&gt;  a single in Canada.]

&gt;  very subtle, but it is different.  Some of the guitar parts are slightly 
&gt;  altered. It is the same mix used in the video.  This also sometimes comes 
&gt;  with the promo picdisc of the whole album so be on the look out.]

&gt;       listenable. About ~90 minutes.

&gt;	
&gt;VIDEOS 

&gt;[I think that only "The Bird in the Gravel" is available commercially.]

&gt;*  1. CBC Documentary
&gt;       [About an hour long, various concert performances of "Speckless"
&gt;       songs intertwined with short interviews and shots of "The Walking"
&gt;       studio sessions.]  About an hour.

&gt;*  2. Promo for "The Speckless Sky"
&gt;       [Edited interview (ie. you only hear the answers not the questions)
&gt;       along with the "dairy" version (Jane walking a cow down the road 
&gt;       of the "One More Colour" video.] 
&gt;       About 15 minutes.

&gt;*  3. Film of "The Bird in the Gravel"
&gt;       An independant film directed/prod. by Siberry based on the song of 
&gt;       the same title on "The Walking" Lp.  11 minutes/B&amp;W  [this available
&gt;       commercially from Sib. Productions ((see below for address) VHS only 
&gt;       NTSC (north american) format only; US/CANADA: $22.00  Overseas: 25/1.
&gt;       Jane is not in the video,it does, however have Rebecca Jenkins, Gina 
&gt;       Steputnik, Al Cross, Don Freed and others in it.  I had earlier said
&gt;       this was in mono.  My VCR must have been fritzed I've watched on a 
&gt;       couple other machines and it IS in stereo.]

&gt;*  4. Mimi on the Beach 
&gt;       A low budget video of people walking around on the beach, a little
&gt;       surrelistic.  Jane has said in interviews that it didn't live up to
&gt;       her expectiations.

&gt;*  5. You Don't Need
&gt;       Jane walking through a sparse forest of leaf less trees and a few
&gt;       evergreens in the depths of winter.  It is almost in black and
&gt;       white with real washed out colours.

&gt;*  6. Map of the World pt. II (live-sort-of)
&gt;       "Live" performance video taken from the CBC documentary (No. 1
&gt;       above).  The audio portion sounds like it's straight off the
&gt;       album though :-(]

&gt;*  7. One More Color (non-dairy-computer graphics-gone-wild-version)
&gt;       Shot of Jane (singing of course) from about the waist up, with
&gt;       various things floating past.  It reminds me of Yes' "Leave it"
&gt;       video, if that helps at all.

&gt;*  8. One More Color (Jane walking with a cow)
&gt;       Jane walking with a cow, whilst singing.

&gt;*  9. The Walking
&gt;       Hmm...not sure how to describe this one.  Kind of like a moving
&gt;       black and white photograph.

&gt;* 10. Ingrid (and the Footman)
&gt;       This one is fun...Jane plays Ingrid, Al Cross plays the footman
&gt;       Different seens of them interspersed with "performance" footage
&gt;       of the band.  First time I've seen a piano solo played on a Hammond
&gt;       and still sound like a piano ;-).  Ends with Jane sweeping the 
&gt;       clouds away...piles of white sand arranged to look like clouds on
&gt;       a blue floor, Jane comes in with a push broom and sweeps 'em away
&gt;       (the camera is looking down on her).  a really neat effect.
&gt; 
&gt;* 11. Bound By the Beauty
&gt;       Various shots of Jane romping around a farm, interspersed with
&gt;       performance footage of the band sitting in a barn on hay bales.

&gt;* 12. The Life is the Red Wagon
&gt;       Another "moving photograph" video this time in colour.  Several
&gt;       sceens literally revolve around people, like they are a wagon
&gt;       wheel.  Also shots of "Band on lazy susan"  Jane, Ken and Teddy,
&gt;       sitting on in a circle facing outward while the camera goes 
&gt;       around them, actually I think they really are spinning.

&gt; Are there any more????
