On the album "Nothing Is Written" (Avalon Records, GHCD 3 [1991]) by the
UK neo-progressive band Galahad, there is a song entitled "Evaporation"
which I have long suspected is about KaTe. I finally got a chance to
speak to Stu Nicholson, Galahad's lead singer and lyricist, yesterday
and he was happy to confirm this.
 
Here is the lyric in question:
 
Evaporation (S. Nicholson)
-----------
 
The last time that I saw you was on stage in a video
Alive and high kicking at Hammersmith O... so good
So good
 
I can close my eyes and picture movement so serene
Beauty in full motion a true whimsical princess...
Oh yes..
 
So good, so sensual
So good, so sensual, sensual, sensual...
 
Evaporation, evaporation, where did you go to?
Where did you go?
Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
So much
 
Although a decade has passed I still think of you
It only seems like yesterday
 
I know you are no child but I can feel your innocence
When I visualise, in my mind, in my head, ooh yes!
I doubt if you'll ever know me
But it would warm so much if you did, oh if you did
You take all my breath away and send my pulse racing
Into overdrive, you do... without fail
 
So good, so sensual
So good, so sensual, sensual...
 
Evaporation, evaporation, where did you go to?
Where did you go?
Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
So much
 
Not so much as a whisper you further the enigma
Although it seems like yesterday
 
If only I could talk to you
If only I could meet you
If only we could harmonise together
If only I could sing with you
If only I could breathe you
Maybe we could harmonise together!
 
Evaporation, evaporation, where did you go to?
Where did you go?
Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
So much
Evaporation, evaporation, it's good to see you back again
in the fold
Evaporation, evaporation, I've really missed you
So much
 
Don't stay away too long
Don't evaporate
Don't evaporate...
 
 
Before rabid philocanines rush out to try to obtain a copy of this, a
couple of words of warning:
 
1. The CD is only domestically available in the UK and Japan
 
2. The music is not at all KaTian - it is much like early Genesis or
   Marillion
