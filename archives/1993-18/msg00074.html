since someone was wondering...

	Hello and welcome to the Jane Siberry discography.  It is really
not a true discography as it contains various other information, such as
address, and a short intro to her work.  If you're new to Jane hopefully
the intro will give you a good idea of where to start, or to continue on 
the path you've started.  If on the other hand you're already a fan I 
hope that this discography will give you some info you didn't already know.

	Jane Siberry is one of Canada's premier singer-songwriters who has,
over the course of her five albums, ranged in style from folk ("Jane Siberry")
to snyth based pop-rock ("No Borders Here" and "the Speckless Sky"), to a more
lush sounding synth based art rock ("the Walking"), and finally to folk with 
country flavorings ("Bound By the Beauty" ( I hate labels but how else to 
describe...???)).  Her work is always consisently good and she has had the 
fortune to work with and assemble some of the best musicians in Canada.  
...so here we go...

	[ this tape was made for members of the siberry list and other

	  (number 2 above).  the second side was gleaned from various
	  promos and the documentary film made towards the end of the TSS
	  tour.  It is 90min.  There is a 100 minute version which also 
	  contains: Something About Trains (live from mountain stage) and

VIDEOS 

[I think that only "The Bird in the Gravel" is available commercially.]

*  1. CBC Documentary
	[About an hour long, various concert performances of "Speckless"
	songs intertwined with short interviews and shots of "The Walking"
	studio sessions.]  About an hour.

*  2. Promo for "The Speckless Sky"
	[Edited interview (ie. you only hear the answers not the questions)
	along with the "dairy" version (Jane walking a cow down the road 
	of the "One More Colour" video.] 
	About 15 minutes.

*  3. Film of "The Bird in the Gravel"
	An independant film directed/prod. by Siberry based on the song of 
	the same title on "The Walking" Lp.  11 minutes/B&amp;W  [this available
	commercially from Sib. Productions ((see below for address) VHS only 
	NTSC (north american) format only; US/CANADA: $22.00  Overseas: 25/1.
	Jane is not in the video,it does, however have Rebecca Jenkins, Gina 
	Steputnik, Al Cross, Don Freed and others in it.  I had earlier said
	this was in mono.  My VCR must have been fritzed I've watched on a 
	couple other machines and it IS in stereo.]

*  4. Mimi on the Beach 
	A low budget video of people walking around on the beach, a little
	surrelistic.  Jane has said in interviews that it didn't live up to
	her expectiations.

*  5. You Don't Need
	Jane walking through a sparse forest of leaf less trees and a few
	evergreens in the depths of winter.  It is almost in black and
	white with real washed out colours.

*  6. Map of the World pt. II (live-sort-of)
	"Live" performance video taken from the CBC documentary (No. 1
	above).  The audio portion sounds like it's straight off the
	album though :-(]

*  7. One More Color (non-dairy-computer graphics-gone-wild-version)
	Shot of Jane (singing of course) from about the waist up, with
	various things floating past.  It reminds me of Yes' "Leave it"
	video, if that helps at all.

*  8. One More Color (Jane walking with a cow)
	Jane walking with a cow, whilst singing.

*  9. The Walking
	Hmm...not sure how to describe this one.  Kind of like a moving
	black and white photograph.

* 10. Ingrid (and the Footman)
	This one is fun...Jane plays Ingrid, Al Cross plays the footman
	Different seens of them interspersed with "performance" footage
	of the band.  First time I've seen a piano solo played on a Hammond
	and still sound like a piano ;-).  Ends with Jane sweeping the 
	clouds away...piles of white sand arranged to look like clouds on
	a blue floor, Jane comes in with a push broom and sweeps 'em away
	(the camera is looking down on her).  a really neat effect.
 
* 11. Bound By the Beauty
	Various shots of Jane romping around a farm, interspersed with
	performance footage of the band sitting in a barn on hay bales.

* 12. The Life is the Red Wagon
	Another "moving photograph" video this time in colour.  Several
	sceens literally revolve around people, like they are a wagon
	wheel.  Also shots of "Band on lazy susan"  Jane, Ken and Teddy,
	sitting on in a circle facing outward while the camera goes 
	around them, actually I think they really are spinning.

 Are there any more????
