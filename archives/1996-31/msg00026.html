G'day all,

"Birch, Keith" &lt;BIRCK@msmail.acgs.qld.edu.au&gt; sez...
&gt;I understand that the words at the end of the song are part of an Aboriginal 
&gt;chant she incorporated. SOrry, don't know how to transliterate them...
&gt;
&gt;K eith B irch
&gt;
&gt;________________
&gt;I have one question concerning the great song "the dreaming"!
&gt;Unfortunately I can't understand the last words of this song (spoken by a
&gt;man's voice). It's not in the leaflet that contains the lyrics :-(
&gt;Does anybody know what the man says ? Does he speak English ? 

 I should have answered this earlier... This has been one of those things 
that I've always wanted to understand. I actually asked it as my question 
to KaTe at the thrid Konvention but it wasn't chosen to be put to her 
&lt;deep sigh&gt; ... I have various books on Aboriginal language around me as 
I type... I've tired taking apart the sentence as *I* hear it and then 
flicking around various books trying to see if I can find words that 
match up. What, I *should* do is get myself off to the local Uni and ask, 
but that's probably a last ditch thing... Anyway, what do you think of 
some of these ideas.. I options for each word in the sentence, what they 
mean and the region of Australia that they come from:

First hassle is that the start of the first word is hidden by a "thump".. 
I hear it a 'k' sort of sound. What do the rest of you think?

First word
(1) Kore (women) - South Australian
(2) Coorie (spouse) - New South Wales
(3) Koori (people) - New South Wales [this actually then name Eastern 
Australian
                                      Aboriginals give for them selves. 
They are
                                      'Koori' people]

Second word
(1) Mie (girl) - New South Wales [maybe it's a sort word]
(2) Minkie (daylight) -New South Wales

Third word
(1) Na - [sorry, doesn't seem to be a word]
(2) Kina - [once again, sorry, doesn't seem to be a word]

So that's it so far... hmmm maybe I should just ask somebody who knows 
Aboriginal language much better then I do!
