&gt; Hey--I think you are all great, but you know, what a waste of space! 

Fear not restive surfer.  This one is over. 

&gt; From: gearnoise@news-e2b.gnn.com (Neal Mulvenna)

&gt; This is semi-fun, like watching two combatants play a game which
&gt; rules you are vaguely familiar, enough so to appreciate a good hit
&gt; once in a while.

See WWF tag team wrestling.  Much better outfits and cheating and
distraction of the ref is emphasized.

&gt; If style points are to be awarded, I'd give some for Len's "pig's
&gt; suckling marks".....

But ya can't dance to it, so I'd give it a 4.

&gt; From: maybe the last real beer in america &lt;woj@remus.rutgers.edu&gt;

&gt; granted, i don't like frames and don't plan on using them for anything
&gt; i write, but i don't think i should be i should be granted demigod
&gt; status by equating my meager and pointless comments with those of the
&gt; great and powerful stev0. ;)

Ok.  Would you like to be the scarecrow instead? 
Umm, but you have to let the munchkins put needles 
in your head?  Is that ok?
 
&gt; really, len, i don't grasp a single argument you offer in defense of
&gt; burkhard. writing web sites for the greater glory of KaTe does not
&gt; excuse poor style. 

I didn't offer an excuse.  As long as the browser commmunity 
creates the tools, he gets to use them as he sees fit. 
OTH, his site displays well on over 70% 
of the browsers in current use.  He at least gets 
a passing grade and a few bonus points for selecting 
a good topic.  

Support for the majority is not elitism.  Insistence on 
the lowest common denominator for others while enjoying 
the privileges of the elite is.

&gt; it's clear, as you say, that the author is under no
&gt; obligation to change his website just because some of us find it
&gt; lacking, but your condemnation of our "bashing" is perplexing.

I did a round with a fellow named Jorn 
Barger once.  His arguments and methods were
remarkably similar to those I receive here.
How perplexing can this be?  I am dishing 
back what you to a lesser extent and others 
to a greater extent are dishing out.  It's fair.

If we disagree on another review, we can do it
all again... and again.... and again.

&gt; From: "Xenu's Sister" &lt;vickie@miso.wwa.com&gt;

Wow! I haven't seen my name in print that
many times since we signed the real estate
papers for the house.

Chris doesn't have breasts?  That's odd.
