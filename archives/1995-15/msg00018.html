Kat Devlin (The Artist Formerly Known as Kat Ellwyn Devlin) will be returning
to 88s in Greenwich Village with an all-new Kate Bush show: 

Saturdays May 20 thru June 10 at 5:30 pm
$12 cover, 2 drink minimum, no credit cards 
Eighty-Eights
228 W 10th Street
New York City
Reservations: 212-924-0088.

Mickie, Kat's publicist, can be reached at Mkymaky@aol.com.

Entitled "Reaching Out", this is a follow-up engagement to Kat's stint at 88s
last fall.  At that time, I posted a review of the show on AOL and reprinted
it in Lovehounds a couple of months ago.  That review formed the basis for
part of Uli's most recent FAQ update concerning live covers of Katesongs.
 For all who either missed it previously and/or might have an interest in
attending the upcoming series of shows, following are some excerpts from the
review and a complete list of songs performed:

=====================================
Singer Does Kate In NYC

"Kat Elwynn Devlin Sings The Songs Of Kate Bush" is just that -- Devlin is an
actress and club singer and rabid Bush fan whose repertoire consists solely
of Kate material...

For her finale, Devlin saved the best for last -- a searing, chilling
rendition of This Woman's Work, which managed to dampen eye sockets as
effectively as the Sensual World original.

Devlin is more of a KB interpreter than an imitator.  She appears more
comfortable with drama and humor than with sensuality.  Feel It, in
particular, seemed somewhat forced.  Her act doesn't include Bush's patented
Hammersmith pyrotechnics -- mostly, she's at the mike stand, sometimes on the
piano (shades of SNL!), and sings her heart out.  

If you're a KB fan, and getting to NYC on one of the next 3 Mondays is
doable, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not checking out this show.
Whether Devlin has the uniqueness and authority to make it big-time might be
a valid question, but her ability to deliver the goods in the meantime to a
Kate-starved nation is, IMHO, beyond question.

PROGRAM:

1-  Running Up The Hill
2-  Moments Of Pleasure
3-  Wuthering Heights
4-  Man With The Child In His Eyes
5-  Moving
6-  There Goes A Tenner
7-  Experiment IV
8-  Under Ice
9-  Mother Stands For Comfort
10- Infant Kiss
11- Feel It
12- Symphony In Blue
13- Coffee Home Ground
14- Babooshka
15- This Woman's Work

======================================

I only wish I was able to make it this time around.  If any of you do get a
chance to go, let us know how it was!
