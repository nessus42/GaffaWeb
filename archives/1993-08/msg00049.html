Jeff Sez...
&gt;I hope there is answer to this, the QUINTESSENTIAL Kate Bush question - 
&gt;in Experiment IV the lyric says "so they told us that they wanted a noise 
&gt;that would kill someone form a distance, so ............. ??????!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;I listened to the song ten thousand times and still cant figure it 
&gt;out.HELP!

    Hmmm, off the top of my head I remember it going "... they told us all they
wanted was a sound the could kill someone from a distance, so they go ahead and
the meters are over in the red ..." As for meaning, well I don't know how many
people out there know that the British government played around back in the
50's and 60's with many different and horrible methods ending somebodies life.

&lt;personal bitch session on&gt;

    As an aside, one of the things they did was run their nuclear tests here in
Australia. As a result of our piss-poor politions here in Oz letting them do
so, we now have some rather large pieces of land that nobody we be able to go
near for the next few thousand years and many Aboriginal people died since they
weren't moved safely away from the test areas. We're still trying to get
compensation from the British government for this, or at the least get them to
clean up the mess!

&lt;personal bitch session off&gt;

    One of the ideas toyed with was the use of sound weapons. The concept, if I
remember right, was to use an ultra-sonic sound wave that would work at the
frequency of water molecules. A dreadful, non-discriminating weapon and an
extreamly painful death. Kate changed the idea from a ultra-sonic sound to just
a sound. What kind of sound can kill? She uses a mix of terrible sounds ("the
painful cries of mothers to the the terrifying scream" ) all mixed to gather
into a "killing sound".
