&gt;&gt;Off the top of my head, not in alphabetical order:

&gt;&gt;Kate Bush, Jane Siberry, Happy Rhodes, Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan,
...
&gt;&gt;Shelly Thunder, Maria McKee, Mazzy Star, Flying Lizards, Judie Tzuke...
&gt;&gt;among others...(I know I'm leaving out a couple of hundred)
&gt;&gt;In other words, all female vocals.

&gt;Are you trying to make me move to Chicago? Any plans to have your shows
&gt;broadcast in MD? :)  Wow!

Thank you! Chicago's a wonderful city, come on over...(but consult us
about what area of town to live in, because WZRD is only 100 Watts, and
Mono to boot. Most areas of town can't get it.) You could move to Kansas
City. My station there, KKFI, is 100,000 Watts, &amp; in stereo!

&gt;I give up. Pardon me while I pass out, overwhelmed...

Get out the smelling salts!!

&gt;Ok, thanks. Do you play: L7, Curve, (The) Breeders, My Bloody Valentine or
&gt;lulabox?

No, yes, no, yes, no. Grunge ain't my thing, I like Curve a lot, I have
yet to get the Breeders album (but I will), I've played a couple of MBV
songs, and I've never heard lulabox.

&gt;Do you think if I put up a *really big* antenna I could get WZRD in MD?

Get one big enough and you might be able to get WFMU out of East Orange, NJ.
My show doesn't air there (I wish!) but it's a very cool station.
Can you pick up WXPN from Phiadelphia? It's pretty cool. 

&gt;And congratulations on your soon-anniversary.

Thanks! Isn't it weird, I get all the best compliments from people who
can't hear the show. I never hear from my listeners anymore :-(.

Folks, if you have a favorite radio show, CALL AND LET THE PROGRAMMER
KNOW. We broadcast out into the void, and wonder if anyone even cares.
Plus, if it's a station that relies on listener support, give something,
anything, during that show. Even $10.00 lets someone know you care. When
I was on the air live in Kansas City, my first pledge drive was a rousing
success. My show was the top rated (according to pledges) English-language
show on the station, 3rd overall. I "made" over $1000.00. The last pledge
drive was so dismal (less than $100.00) that I don't even know why I
bother anymore. It's very different being on tape (I tape it in Chicago
and mail it to Kansas City) plus it's been moved around on the schedule,
but still....geez how depressing. Oh well, I'll stay on until they kick
me off. If, by continuing, I can turn anyone at all onto Kate or Happy
or Jane or Tori or Sarah or (see deleted list) then it's worth it.

My driving force all along is to...be e. mortal (fade out, fast forward
to the future when someone asks someone, "You're a really big fan, wow.
How did you first hear of...Kate/Happy/Sarah/whoever?" and the other
person answers "Oh, one night I was listening to this strange show on
the radio and I heard a song by ... that just blew me away so I went
out and bought an album and that's how it started.") I don't care if
they remember the name of the show or my name or anything else. If they
remember the fact that they heard it on the radio, that's good enough
for me. The music, that's all that counts. Remember the music.
