        Jeff asked about Experiment IV.  The 12 inch is on the boxed 
set, I believe, but I don't know how you can get it otherwise here in 
San Diego.  Here are the lryics: 


Experiment IV 
 We were working secretly
 For the military.
 We only know in theory
 What we are doing:
 Music made for pleasure,
 Music made to thrill.
 It was music we were making here until

      They told us
      All they wanted
      Was a sound that could kill someone
      From a distance.
      So we go ahead,
      And the meters are over in the red.
      It's a mistake in the making.

           It could feel like falling in love.
           It could feel so bad.
           But it could feel so good.
           It could sing you to sleep--
 ("I'll bet my mum's gonna give me a little toy instrument!")*
           But that dream is your enemy.

 We won't be there to be blamed.
 We won't be there to snitch.
 I just pray that someone there
 Can hit the switch.

      But they told us
      All they wanted
      Was a sound that could kill someone
      From a distance.
      So we go ahead,
      And the meters are over in the red.
      It's a mistake we've made.

      And the public are warned to stay off.


[*--"I'll bet my mum's gonna give me a little toy instrument":
This line is only a guess. There is still no certainty that real words 
are spoken here at all. Many people hear some, however, and during the 
Wogan Show performance of this song a face (possibly Paddy's) appears 
on a computer monitor during this line, mouthing something.]
