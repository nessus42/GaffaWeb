  That was me. Here's the original of my "confession."
  Thanks.

Chris here,
    OK, I confess. I wrote the Tipper piece and sent it through a friend's
account. I made a mistake in editing his .login file and his name appeared
on the post. I hope people found it amusing or at least a tiny bit thought
provoking. We were watching CNN and watched a story about the latest
attempt on the first amendment by the Parent's Music Resource Center. 
It seems that they want warning stickers to specifically mention what they
and their hench(wo)men find offensive about the record in question. Here
is the contents of the sticker in Pennsylvania:

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                 This recording may contain lyrics descriptive
                        of or advocating one or more
                            of the following:
suicide
incest
bestiality
sadomasochism
sexual activity in a violent context
murder
morbid violence
illegal use of drugs or alcohol

                                 PARENTAL
                                 ADVISORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
              The words "warning" and "parental" "advisory" are
             5" by 1" each on a sticker the same "railroad orange"
            color that credit card companys use for "final demand"
                  notices. The entire sticker is 6" by 9".


   I watched this and I thought, hey, they've just described a large number
of Kate songs! So I grabbed my handy-dandy copy of "The Complete Kate"
(no home should be without one) and went through it with a nosy, suspicious,
hateful attitude, just like a PMRC staffer would. I don't know if many Kate
fans have thought about Kate in terms that the PMRC would. On her first 
album she had themes of incest, murder, supernaturalism and lots &amp; lots
of sex. Now most of the sex in Kate's work is loving and non-violent, I don't
count on the PMRC seeing it my way. I don't trust these people to understand
that the "Hounds of Love" are metaphorical. They would just see a woman with
very little on snuggling up to two large dogs. And I'm not to clear on what
sort of violence they would consider "morbid". Would "The Wedding List" count?
I'm just pointing out that these self-appointed censors are not noted for
sensitivity to musical nuances. They don't know Heavy-Metal from Punk,
Rap from Hip-Hop, or Kate from Kylie. _No one_ is safe.

                                  Chris'n'Vickie of
                                     Kansas City, Mo.
                                        katefans@world.std.com

P.S. Susan, I wouldn't dismiss the possibility of Tipper being computer
literate out of hand. Her husband Albert Gore is one of the more
technically autute Senators around. I like his stand on home satellite
viewing rights. Just wish his wife had a different hobby.
