FYI:

  And this is nothing but rumor.  Kate is no longer with EMI/Manhatten, but
this isn't really new.  There are currently two rumors as to who she will
sign with.  For a brief time, she was with CBS just because.  I am not sure
if this was public release information or not, but here is how I found out
about her connection (however brief) with cbs:
  Our campus radio station was playing a string of KT songs when someone
called in and said "How can you play Kate after the announcement you made
last night?"  We asked: "What announcement?" -- Apparently, someone either
on our radio station or something that sounds like it, announced that Kate
had DIED!  She had succumbed to some form of cancer (presumably lung) and
had indeed passed on.  I freaked out.  A friend and myself called CBS in
New York and LA...the LA office didn't know anything about her - wasnt even
sure if she was with them.  New York admitted that she was spending lots of
time talking to their office, and was expected to sign the finals soon, but
she was not dead.  So anyway...she's fine, apparently.  BUT IT ISNT OVER!

  The latest rumor is that she is about to sign with Sire records.  Apparently,
her new album is over half completed, and is theoretically due out this 
Spring (yet I heard someone mention that it was not till Fall...).  Anyway,
she can't release till she signs....and publicizes...  

  She also did some sort of a single with someone...I am not sure who, and
I dont know if I've ever heard of the person..but it is recent, and was
just released.

  As a side note, does anyone out there have the amazing patience to enter
kate's music onto a macintosh for midi?  I have sheet music for kate, and
while Im sure that there is some sort of copyright infringement, I would
still be intersted in seeing Kate Transposed...if you are interested, or
you know have already done it, please let me know.

Scott
