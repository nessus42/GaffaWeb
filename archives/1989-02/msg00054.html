 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: The _Bitz_ interview


                      A brief interview from _Bitz_ (_Sounds_?)

     &lt;IED couldn't resist including the following mini-interview.
In the space of a single page the interviewer (naturally anonymous)
manages to be rude and offensive at least a dozen times. The author's tone
is, in IED's opinion, an archetype of the supercilious, self-important,
hyper-cynical and ill-prepared British music critic, and for this reason
alone the interview is of interest. Also, Kate reveals in this
brief piece a new caustic manner with rude interviewers, as well as
a rather spiky sense of humour. Autumn 1985. Edited by Andrew
Marvick.&gt;


                 Wowwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


     Friends. Cast your mind back a few years and you might recall
a raven-haired "beauty" with a squeaky voice being very
famous. Kate Bush, right? She had loads of hits with things like
_Wuthering_Heights_, _Wow_ and _Babooshka_
and dodgy impressionists were always on telly doing "comic"
imitations of her dancing technique (much wiggling of the arms, etc.).
     Anyway, in 1982 Kate seemed to disappear. Pouff! She was gone!
Just like that! But now she's back with a new single--_Running_Up_That_
Hill_--and a long-player is to follow. And _Bitz_, longtime
admirers of the "lady" who was renowned throughout
the globe for using the words "amazing" and/or "wow"
about seventeen times in every possible sentence, managed to wangle
an exclusive 'n' legendary interviewette.
     So, Kate, says _Bitz_,
you haven't been doing very much for about three years...
     "Would you like to rephrase that?" says she.
     Oh, dear. Seems that la Bush has actually been tres busy,
building her own recording studio, writing zillions of new songs and
being generally "creative". Whoops.
     So, Kate, now that you're back will you be treating us to
your funny dancing all over again?
     "You have a way with words, young man..."
     Oh, dear.
     So, kate do you get recognised when you're out shopping at
Saintsbury's?
     "Yes. I find it very intersting and very positive, because
I haven't actually been in the public eye for a while and people
do constantly recognise me, and they're very nice. They're
very nice people."
     What do they say to you?
     "Hello."
     Quite. So, Kate, what about TV? Do you watch TV?
     "Yes, when I can. Normally it's Saturday evenings when
I get a chance to watch the box. It's my weekly rubbish, and it
helps me unwind. It's wonderful to unwind with something visual,
like a great film, or _The_Young_Ones_ or _Fawlty_Towers_."
We've been "rapping" for some time now, and Kate hasn't
said "amazing" or "wow" once.
     "No, I haven't. I think they call it aversion therapy,
don't they? I think one changes words that one found interesting
at the time. And that was a _long_ time ago. And you chappies are _so_
fond of pulling up things that happened a _long_ time ago."
     Ahem, yes. So, Kate, what words do you find interesting these days?
     "'Interesting.' That's an interesting word...And
'boomerang'..."
     Quite...
