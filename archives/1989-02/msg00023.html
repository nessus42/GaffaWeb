I am trying to find any information regarding two books on Kate Bush.  
The two I am referring to are "Kate Bush Complete", which is apparently
a book containing lyrics to all her music, and "Kate Bush : A Visual 
Documentary", which is a biography of her.  I have been trying to locate
them for quite awhile, but cannot find any reference to them.  I finally
had to resort to calling EMI Publishing in England (after more phone
calls than I care to pay for).  I finally got a person to personally
go to a store and pay for them and send them to me if I send him the
money.  I would prefer to find them here in the US if it is easier.

Has anyone any information on these two books, i.e. the Publisher, and
the authors.  Also, is there any more literature regarding her out there.
I have tried to become a fan club member, but the one in the States, 
sponsored by an organization called "The Intergalactic Garage" is 
impossible to find.  It is supposed to be located somewhere in the 
Washington DC area, but I have already tried a phone number that was
given to me for IG, and it did not work.  I have also called Directory
Assistance in Washington DC, Virginia, AND Maryland with no luck.  I
did finally get a little information about a fan club located in Scotland,
but that was more than minimal.  Maybe I am not looking in the right
directions.  Anyone have any suggestions.  Any help would be appreciated.

Lastly, is there still an alias called "love-hounds-request"?  I have 
sent mail there several times, and have not gotten any responce as of yet.

Again, thanks for any assistance anyone may be able to give.
