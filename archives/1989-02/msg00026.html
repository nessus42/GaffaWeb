 Subject: New KT "bootleg" interview CD

     Yet another KT interview CD has come on the market. Unlike
most of the others released to date, this new CD is
an excellent product. It's called (wrongly or euphemistically)
_Kate_Bush:_The_Abbey_Road_Interview_, and it is apparently being
made in an authentically "limited" edition--at any rate, each copy
includes a serial number on the front cover.
     The cover--which is made of card-paper in the style of a five-inch-
size album cover--is beautifully designed, with pretty silver block
lettering on a dark blue background. On the front cover it simply
says "K A T E   B U S H" above a reproduction of one of Guido
Herera's _HoL_-era publicity close-ups, in full and good-quality
colour. The back has the title, the serial number (printed in black
on a white band) and a marvelously printed colour shot of Kate, dating
from a series of photos for a ca.-1979/80 UK music-weekly interview
(quite unrelated to the contents of the CD itself, but a wonderful
shot nevertheless), showing her seated on a bank of black leather couches
in a lobby, wearing a bright red dress with a butterfly brooch. Lovely.
     The interview itself is _not_ from "Abbey Road". God knows
why such a title was chosen. At any rate, it probably wouldn't have
been a good idea to identify the interview correctly, because the
actual company which owns the rights to it--UK's Capital Radio--
almost certainly had nothing to do with this product. Anyway, the
interview was really undertaken by Tony Myatt, a longtime friend
of Kate's dating from November of 1977 when Tony and Capital decided
that _Wuthering_Heights_ was such a great record, they would play it
on their station even though its release had been postponed for four
months. Their early promotion had a "teaser" effect on the British
public, and helped make _Wuthering_Heights_ the success it was.
This particular interview was, as far as IED knows, recorded by
Tony at Capital's own studios, but at the Romford Convention in November
1985 it was announced that the interview had been conducted expressly
for the convention itself.
     Anyway, the interview is one of Kate's very best, and even
though Tony's questions are frequently very, very silly, his evident
affection and respect for Kate have the effect of provoking some very
interesting and emotional answers. It's also a long interview--the
second longest that IED has ever heard/read. It lasts forty-seven
minutes. Finally, the sound is superb--almost like a digital
recording. Absolutely no hiss, though there is a very low-level
intermittent buzz from the in-studio equipment. All in all, this
CD gets an A from IED, and is recommended to anyone wishing to
hear Kate talking over a broad range of subjects with the thoughtfulness
and maturity that has distinguished her public conversation since 1985.
IED paid a rather steep $20.00 for his copy, but it's almost worth
that much.
