&gt; 
&gt; Since the last Dukes of Stratosphere album (Psionic Psunspot)
&gt; came out only about two months after Skylarking, does this
&gt; mean that we can (hopefully) expect a new Dukes album in the
&gt; near future?
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any word on when another Dukes album might
&gt; be coming out?
&gt; 
&gt; 


	Another Dukes? Got news for you; 'Lemons and Oranges' *IS* 
the new Dukes album! 

	Seriously, this record has far more in common with the Dukes 
than with regular XTC albums, which is kind of a pity. Now, I *loved*
'Psonic Psunspots', but the album is a satire, and I'd like to see
XTC put a little more into a record if they're going to release it 
as an XTC album. This thing sounds like a collection of leftovers from
'Dukes', 'Skylarking', and 'Mummer'. 

	...Sorry to get on a soapbox, but I think these guys still
have material the quality of 'English Settlement' and 'Black Sea'
in them, if only they'd quit fooling with this 60's sound. This record
just has entirely the wrong presentation for XTC. It's slick, gentle 
and a little spineless. Rough edges suit them far better; Andy's voice
works more effectivly as a barking howl than as the pretty crooning 
he's trying to do here...



	...Ok, so I guess I don't much like the new record, right?
I'll admit, I had to listen to 'Radios in Motion' to cheer myself
up after first playing it. Don't get me wrong; I don't think it's
a *bad* record; there's some great songs here. I just thing that 
the whole feel of the thing is very, very wrong....
