In his last message, michael fischer (mfischer%sbccvm.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu)
mentions that the cure has a new single out, called "fascination street" ...
which unfortunately i haven't heard.

now, my question (and comments) are as follows ...

1) yaaaayyyy!!!! ... i've heard rumours to the effect that the
   new cure album will be out late this month, or sometime in
   april ... if they have a new single out, this seems much
   more likely to be coming true in that time-frame ...
2) when you (mfischer) say that it sounds like really early
   cure and then say "pre- Head on the Door" ... do you mean
   REALLY early stuff like Boys Don't Cry/Three Imaginary Boys/i
   Seventeen Seconds/Faith?  more like Pornography?  or do you mean 
   that it's kinda like Japanese Whispers/The Top/Head on the Door?
   
   the reason why i'm being so picky about this is because i don't
   really care for much of the post-Pornography stuff (yeah, sure,
   some of it is great ... but the early stuff is MUCH better).

i guess that i'm just not too thrilled about much of the stuff
after robert smith left siouxsie and the banshees ... when he
really started wearing all the make-up and the hair and everything.
he helped to start a scene, and then he becomes what seems like
a poseur in his own scene ... 

the best thing he did since 1984 was to cut his hair back short
again ... and i just hope his new music is better than their
most recent offerings ...

of course, being the absolute total cure fanatic that i am, 
i will go and get the new album no matter what it's like ...
because who knows ... maybe it will grow on me ... Head on the Door
did ... Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me is starting to (after two LONG years)
