                Eclectic Music Survey #4 Results

Survey Posting                                      February 1990

Part 9 of 19 (Thru Bob Geldof)


Exchange

     A Canadian electronic/keyboards duo (Gerald O'Brien and Steve Sexton).
     Their first, and only, album thus far is titled "Into The Night". The
     title track of the same name was quite a hit over here (so I was told).
     Their music has been used for some television shows (Brian Orser's
     special from Lake Louise, Alberta; Barbara Walter's specials; several
     radio station (tv) commercials; and (I suspect) 48 Hours(?)). EXchange
     is definitely not "New Age". "Synth-Pop/Instrumental" would be more
     appropriate (I've seen HMV put them in the Jazz section, the New Age
     section, and the Pop section - so classifying their music obviously is
     not easy - at least for some people anyway). Some of the tracks on
     "Into..." are quite rhythmically intense and upbeat (i.e. "Into The
     Night", "Magnetic Movements", "Visions of Sin", and "Stonewalk"). "Into
     The Night" is available on CD (Penta Disc - PCD 10004), and vinyl on the
     now defunct "Audion" label. So you may have more success finding the CD.
          - Simon Lea csc458@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca

     Canadian Newage music. Their 1988 album "Into The Night" is very
     melodic.
          - Iain Smith &amp; Jonathan Habrovitsky
          jhabrovi%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Their one and only album is quite interesting. "Golden Point" is
     currently my favorite newage song. "Golden Point" has a lot of emotion
     and feeling behind it. I almost feel like there is a real orchestra
     playing the music. The title track "Into The Night" reminds me of
     something Yanni would do. Light, up-beat and moving. "Stonewalk" is
     another favorite of mine off the album. (Too bad I had to scrap a song
     I did because I thought it sounded too much like it). They have a
     definite lite and newage/electronic feel. Recommendations: _Exchange_
          - Steven Seidman sseidman@polyslo.CalPoly.EDU (The MIDIman)
Fabulous Pink Dots

     I thinkm you are thinking of the LEGENDARY PINK DOTS here... they are a
     group from Amsterdam who do weird trancey/synthy shit with Edward
     Ka-Spel's wispy vocals over the top. I like The Tear Garden which is a
     Ka-Spel/Skinny Puppy collaboration.
          - Jon Drukman jsd@GAFFA.MIT.EDU

Fabulous Poodles

     A fun band for awhile.Opened a few dates for Tom Petty on his Damn The
     Torpedoes tour.Their first American album is a compilation of tracks
     from two British albums.The pictures on their "Think Pink" album were
     taken primarily in the Atlanta area.
          - Jon Kincaid dsrekjk@prism.gatech.edu

     Inexplicably reviled one-shot wonders who encapsulated the entire
     rock&amp;roll experience with the song "Mirror Star". The rest of that album
     sounds like Kinks outtakes.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     My wife loves these guys: "Think Pink" she says.
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

Fairport Convention

     great Irish folk rock group.
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

     I've never heard an album by them, but I saw them open for Jethro Tull,
     and they were very good live.
          - Frank J. Schima francis@pawl.rpi.edu

     The original British folk-rock group. It isn't quite true that every
     British folk-rock group was a Fairport spinoff, but a surprisingly large
     number of them were (e.g.Richard Thompson, Fotheringay/Sandy Denny,
     Steeleye Span, The Albion Band). Still going strong these days, even
     though half the band are also simultaneously members of Jethro Tull,
     which sounds more and more like Fairport all the time.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     There are billions of Fairport Convention albums, almost every one
     featuring a different lineup, but unless you become a dedicated fanatic
     the only albums you need are the 1968-1971 releases when the young
     Richard Thompson was a member: "What We Did On Our Holidays",
     "Unhalfbricking", "Liege and Lief" and "Full House" are the canonical
     studio albums, and "House Full" and "Heyday" collect important live &amp;
     radio broadcast material. The 1989 album "Red and Gold" showed promise,
     but these guys need a fulltime vocalist if they want to become more than
     a Britfolk nostalgia act.
          - Ken Josenhans 13020KRJ@MSU.BitNet

Fast Eddie

     (Acid) house artist. "Jack to the Sound" was "borrowed" by Hithouse.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Fatal Flowers

     Heard a few of their songs, liked them, but they are a lot alike. A very
     "longing" sound, in my opinion; the songs I've heard seem to have to do
     with personal hardships but aren't "preachy" like some of the more
     popular stuff gets.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

Fear

     Totally zany, somewhat offensive. Their album _More Beer_ (or perhaps
     _Have a Beer with Fear_) is Animal House set to music. WARNING: do not
     take this band seriously (for instance: "The trouble with women is ...
     the mouth don't shut.") Good music for college brew parties. Try and
     find this one, it could be a cult classic.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

The Feelies

     Allegedly the inventors of what became known as the "R.E.M. sound". The
     Twin Tone/Suite Beat CD of "The Good Earth" is, sonically, the finest
     rock guitar CD I have encountered; don't know if the reissue was as
     good, and I hear the LP was very muddy. "Only Life" is also worthwhile.
          - Ken Josenhans 13020KRJ@MSU.BitNet

Brian Ferry

     Best known as the leader of Roxy Music, Ferry's two latest solo albums
     are overlooked but brilliant. Ferry is very good at producing a certain
     mood; ask anyone who's heard Roxy Music's "Avalon". Live, he has an
     interesting stage presence; he's at once the typical torch singer and a
     haunted, dangerous personality.
          - Anton C Shepps (Tony)
          rochester!moscom!telesci!ashepps%ll-xn.UUCP@cs.wisc.edu

     Black kids bussed to white schools soaked up white rock, blended it with
     inner city funk and strapped it to ska wheels. Extremely kinetic.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     Former lead singer of Roxy Music. Good singer, and good songwriter, but
     somehow his solo work was never as interesting to me as the early Roxy
     Music (the first 5 albums, before Jobson split).
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     leader of Roxy Music. Has a real weird Martian voice but his songs are
     usually pretty stupid.
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

     Ooooooooohhhhhh such very calculated emotions.
          - Wingerde van FJ fjvwing@cs.vu.nl
Fields of the Nephilim

     Progressive-rock band, I believe. Real obscure. Never heard any of their
     music, and considering how rare their records are, I possibly may never
     get to here them.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Figures On A Beach

     I love "Absolutely Fourth Street" but again, that's one of those Ivan
     Ivan things. Dunno how I'd like their other stuff.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

Fire Engines

     Edinburgh indie group from the early eighties. They started out as
     totally guitar based but eventually added keyboards. They were never
     successful enough to hit the charts (or even think about it) but they
     did evolve into Win, who have been rather more successful. They only
     released one (very rare and recorded in a single day) album 'Lubricate
     Your Living Room'. Their best work was the single 'Big Gold Dream' which
     was, IMHO, chartworthy, but needless to say it didn't make it.
          - Alan Crawford awrc%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Fishbone

     As "pop hardcore" bands go, this one isn't bad.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

     Grab yer ASS and PAAAARTYYYY!! LPs are damn fane and still manage to do
     them no justice at all . . . must see 'em live at least once before you
     die.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

Fleetwood Mac

     Adult rock. Pretty much ruled the '70s charts, making songs with more
     mature themes than Ted Nugent. Started in the late '60s as a blues-based
     outfit similar to John Mayall.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     I could never get into this band... they always seemed a bit like hair
     that hadn't been washed in a long time.
          - Paul Maclauchlan moore!paul@uunet.UU.NET

     Naff music of the first order. If they get a good snatch of melody they
     do not have a clue how to expand on it (eg "Sweet Little Lies"). It's
     advertised on TV - say no more *chuckle*
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

The Fleshtones

     Never heard 'em, but they have the greatest name of all time.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

A Flock of Seagulls

     another dull synth disco band.
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

     English band, early 80s, fairly good synth&amp;guitar playing and singing,
     extremely bizarre haircuts. Quite enjoyable to listen to, but seemed to
     disappear into obscurity after their first album. Shame.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Get a haircut, dudes!
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

     Good band. What happend to them?
          - David Caldwell macs!dfc@bikini.cis.ufl.edu

     Haircut band.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     I love their first album, but then they started practicing on their
     instruments. DONT GO TO A FOS CONCERT! The singer can't stay in tune!
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

     Their '82 lp was great. I Ran my favorite song of the year. Especially
     like the 12" with the seagull sounds. 2nd album almost as good. They're
     still around, playing big towns like Poughkeepsie.
          - Paul Mount prm@whutt.att.com

     Their first two albums were quite enjoyable. Has anyone heard their
     other albums?
          - Neil Ottenstein OTTEN@UMCINCOM.BitNet

Flying Lizards

     a joke, a guy in the studio with his wife talking into the mike. great
     versions of "Summertime Blues", "Money money", etc.
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

     Joke band known for deadpan readings of early rock classics, accompanied
     by wheezing, farting synths. Singer sounds as if English is her second
     language.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     Only heard 30 minutes of them ever. 3 saxophonists, one of them also
     plays guitar. They definitely make interesting music. Not necessarily
     good, just interesting. I must listen to more of them.
          - Christopher Waldemar Bochna cb2w+@andrew.cmu.edu

     Way-goofy covers!
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     What was her name...Jayne Cunningham? A brilliant singer. She sounded
     totally disinterested in what she was singing. Their first single was
     produced on a budget of about 5 pounds and was a big hit in 1979. File
     under Those Were The Days.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Foetus Interruptus

     one man band, jim thirwell likes to write songs of violence. strong
     lyrics over pounding syth-driven chaos. great!
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

John Foxx

     Former member (keyboard player?) of Ultravox. Not surprisingly, his solo
     work (at least the album I've heard, _The Golden Section_) sounds like
     Ultravox; if you like Ultravox, check him out.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Lead singer with Ultravox before Midge Ure. His best stuff was released
     in (guess when) 1980. "Burning Car", "Underpass". Harsh electronic music
     with surreal lyrics. "She was dressed in a white suit/She looked like a
     bride too/It's a burning car/It's a burning car". Still stands up today.
     Maybe they should be re-released..went downhill after 1980..his music
     became more "sapsy".
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     The founder of Ultravox and their original vocalist. More influential
     than successful. Foxx era Ultravox is a lot different to Ure era work,
     being a lot more experimental and avant-garde. His solo work began by
     sounding very like Gary Numan (although it was Numan who was influenced
     by Foxx and not vice versa) and became gradually more mainstream and
     poppy as time went on. Anybody know if he released anything after 'In
     Mysterious Ways'? What is he doing now?
          - Alan Crawford awrc%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Frankie Goes To Hollywood

     A band whose real strength is in their production (Horn/Lipson);
     ...PLEASUREDOME is absolutely *must-own* material and most of their
     mixes are pretty substantial.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     Someone once said they were "the band who put a smile back on Mr Pop's
     face." "Relax" spent a staggering 52 weeks in the UK singles chart, 48
     of them were consecutive, even thought it was banned. I think most of
     their success was due to Trevor Horn's production though..Holly Johnston
     had a few good tracks on his solo album (the first 3 singles) but the
     rest was dire.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     The best ever cover of Ferry Across The Mersey.
          - Paul Maclauchlan moore!paul@uunet.UU.NET

Freiheit

     Also known as "Muenchener Freiheit" - from Munich. "Keeping the Dream
     Alive" sounded much better in German..not so much like the Beatles.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Freur

     Never heard their stuff as this name, but I like Underworld.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     Second generation (83-84) technopop. A weird image and some equally
     weird (but very melodic) songs, like 'Doot Doot'. They didn't really
     achieve the recognition I feel they deserved. Does anybody know if they
     released a single called 'The Devil And The Darkness' circa October of
     either 83, 84 or 85? I can remember it clearly and I'm sure it was Freur
     but I've been unable to confirm it or find a copy (if one exists).
          - Alan Crawford awrc%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Their name was a funny squiggle which probably deterred some potential
     customers. Thus "Doot Doot" only got to number 59 in the UK in 1983. I
     have no idea what they sounded like. Stupid gimmick though.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Glenn Frey

     Ex of the Eagles. Nothing much else to report.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU


Fripp &amp; Eno

     I have one of their albums (they only have 2 together I believe). It is
     not standard music, but more like semi-melodic sounds. It is very
     bizarre and it may take a few more listens before I appreciate it.
          - Frank J. Schima francis@pawl.rpi.edu

     wonderful stuff. Try "No Pussyfooting".
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

Robert Fripp

     The anti-guitar-slinger. Suave, educated, frantic. His "Exposure" is
     quite an exploration, with moody art pieces, straight ballads, guitar
     squonk, found sound, the works. Was in King Crimson, which I know little
     about. Likes to tinker with tape loops, making sleak, shiny tones that
     drift in and out of the fog. Produced the Roches first album.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     the Beethoven of 20th century rock. Everything he touches sounds golden.
     Try middle period King Crimson - "Starless and Bible Black", "Red",
     "Lark's Tongues in Aspic". Or "Exposure", or Frippertronics.
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

Edgar Froese

     Founder of Tangerine Dream. What I've heard of his solo work (Stuntman)
     was pretty good, but I prefer his work with Tangerine Dream.
          - Alan Crawford awrc%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Stalwart Tangerine Dream member. His best solo album is "Stuntman".
          - Iain Smith &amp; Jonathan Habrovitsky
          jhabrovi%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Funkadelic

     can you say funk? george clinton is god. funkadelic is one of the most
     sampled bands by hip hoppers currently. find out where it began!
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Fuzzbox

     BIG BANG! is a fun album, thick sound and a good mix of stuff.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     Early stuff used a genuine fuzzbox, sounded a bit amateurish though. New
     stuff is slick but a bit bland. They have bigger hits with the bland
     stuff.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Their new album "Big Bang!" is such fun! Overproduced breathy girl pop,
     but such a party to listen to...
          - Jon Drukman jsd@GAFFA.MIT.EDU
G love E

     created with Ice T the song "Alice": low level Hip House
          - Hussein Yahia hussein@bora.inria.fr

Peter Gabriel

     Ex-leader of Genesis suddenly popular for the retrofitted Motown of
     "Sledgehammer". Extremely iconoclastic and deeply committed to world
     political issues.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     excellent. Try his first four albums, the ones all named "Peter
     Gabriel".
          - Chris Koenigsberg ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu

     Former Genesis lead singer. His earlier solo work (e.g "Games Without
     Frontiers", "Shock the Monkey") was interesting and innovative
     progressive music, but I have to side with the people who say that his
     album "SO" stands for "Sold Out". However,what I've heard of his most
     recent work, the soundtrack for _The Last Temptation of Christ_, sounded
     good, so maybe there is hope for him after all...
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     GREAT great great. Get his stuff.
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

     He is a major force in music today, and a good one in my opinion. His
     work with Genesis was excellent. His solo albums very good but are
     inconsistent. He doesn't have a totally great (every track) solo album,
     but how many groups can manage that. He also produces a lot of good
     music, Kate Bush would probably never have made it if not for Peter
     Gabriel.
          - Frank J. Schima francis@pawl.rpi.edu

     Like a lot of people it seems, I like his older stuff better. I think
     that "Sledgehammer" was very good but overplayed; I do like the way in
     which he says things without making them so obvious that they slam you
     on the head.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

     Most albums are different from each other, due to him choosing different
     producers for each album. My fav. is PG IV, also known as "Security in
     the US. The best introduction would be his live album.
          - Iain Smith &amp; Jonathan Habrovitsky
          jhabrovi%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     PASSION.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     Peter Gabriel is a musical genius!!! He was fantastic in Genesis, and
     his solo material is quite amazing as well. Most of his solo stuff is
     just basically straight-forward rock, but his writing style is great.
     The albums _Birdy_ and _Passion_ are just electronic music, but these
     albums are fantastic as well. Recommendations: _Peter Gabriel_ (melty
     face), _Birdy_
          - Steven Seidman sseidman@polyslo.CalPoly.EDU (The MIDIman)

     Raspy, former lead vocalist for Genesis. Unlike _So_, his music has an
     unusual flavor. Security is one of his best works.

     So was one of his best albums. I loved it.

Gang of Four

     Amazing up to "Hard",which blew.Jon King and Andy Gill supposedly are
     reviving the band,though it is doubtful they'll get participation from
     from former members David Allen(King Swamp),Sara Lee(B-52's), or Hugo
     Burnham(a&amp;r for IslandRRecords).I'm supposed to be introduced to Hugo
     sometime.Should be an interesting reunion , as Gill's solo 12" was
     horrible as well.I'm curious. Gang of Four section that REM have covered
     two of their songs live in recent years, "What We All Want" and "We Live
     As We Dream,Alone".

     Avowed communists who wanted to shake some serious booty. Some of the
     most pointed lyrics in punk linked with jarring bass and jagged shards
     of guitar.

     their first two albums were good, before their original bassist left and
     League of Gentlemen's Sara Lee replaced him.

Michael Garrison

     Anyone know where to get his albums? The one out in 86 (the one with
     Synthation Flow -- was it called Synthetic Pleaseure) is on some small
     label out of Oregon. No wonder even Tower records didn't have it. My
     copy of it - a taped record has skips and scratches. Nifty synthesizer
     stuff. Nice to know someone else has heard of him.
