 Vickie here.

         Kate was on ABC's World News Tonight this afternoon for
a few seconds! She was interviewed during a feature on the Trio
Bulgarka. Here is a complete transcript:


           ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings
                    February 20, 1990

Peter Jennings:
"Finally here this evening, listening to the world without leaving
your living room. It's called World Music and record store shelves
marked that way keep getting longer, filled with music from places
like Algeria, Brazil, Soviet Georgia. Tomorrow at the Grammy Awards
in Los Angeles another country finds a more celebrated slot on the
World Music shelf. Nominated for Best Traditional Folk Recording
from deep in the heart of Bulgaria. Here's David Enser" [?]

     [ cut to scenes of the Bulgarian countryside, with Bulgarian ]
     [ music heard in the background                              ]

David Enser:
"It is music from another time, passed on by generations of Bulgarian
women. Songs of love and renewal, sung full-throated and clear to 
carry across fields and mountains"

     [ cut to young girl singing traditional song ]

"You can hear the influence of five centuries of Turkish domination
in Bulgaria. People here say the music has helped them get through
hard times, including forty-four years of repressive Communist rule.
The music was hardly known outside of Bulgaria's mountains, until
recently"

     [ cut to Bulgarian Chorus (Le Mystere...) on stage singing live ]

"The Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir has filled
halls in Europe and America since it's record became a cult phenomenon,

     [ cut to cover of Le Mystere des voix Bulgares, Vol. 2 ]

selling 200,000 copies in North America alone"

     [ cut to black &amp; white photo of George Harrison with Trio Bulgarka ]
  
"Former Beatle George Harrison is a fan of the choir's three soloists,
who sing as a trio, and have already appeared on the American

     [ cut to opening logo of "Night Music", then called "Sunday Night" ]

television program 'Sunday Night'"

     [ cut to Jools Holland (?) introducing Trio Bulgarka, then to ]
       Trio Bulgarka singing on the show                           ]

"Now Bulgarian singers are enjoying commercial success in the West,

     [ cut to scene from commercial, with a woman diving into a pool  ]
     [ and the song (my favorite!) "Polegnala E Todora" in background ]

even helping to sell shampoo on British TV"

 {{ !KATE part KATE part KATE part KATE part KATE part KATE part! }}

     [ cut to scenes from "Rhythms Of The World", Trio Bulgarka standing  ]
     [ in front of micophone singing, Yanka Rupkina on left singing solo, ]
     [ Eva Georgieva in the middle, Stoyanka Boneva on right. They're in  ]
     [ street clothes and wearing headhones. Music is demo music from     ]
     [ "Rocket's Tail" (near the end of the song) , then cut to Kate      ]
     [ sitting at mixing console, swaying to the music                    ]

"And the Trio Bulgarka sang backup for British rocker Kate Bush on her
latest album"

     [ cut to 'twirling scenes' of "The Sensual World" video, RT demo ]
     [ music still playing in the background                          ]

"Some charge it's all a kind of cultural strip mining be Western 
musicians, but Kate Bush and others say Bulgaria's mystical sounds
will change the way western musicians think"

     [ cut to Kate, sitting in front of another mixing console. The ]
     [ opening music of the "real" RT is playing in the background. ]
     [ Kate is wearing a black top and a black jacket, a gold chain ]
     [ around her neck with a locket(?) hanging from it. Her hair   ]
     [ is long and loose and curlier than I've ever seen it before. ]
     [ She looks very serious.

Kate:
"I was devastated! I think that anyone who hears it for the first
time hears this incredibly powerful music."

    [ cut to Bulgaria again, scenes of young girls in school singing ]

David Enser:
"When we visited them recently, the girls from the music school in the
remote mountain town of Sharokaluka (sp?) were not even aware that their
special way of singing is gaining a wider audience in the West."

    [ cut to young girl soloist ]

"For them, as it was for their mothers, the music is just part of life."

    [ cut back to studio with Peter Jennings ]

Peter Jennings:
"David Enser. That's our report on World News Tonight. I'm Peter Jennings.
Have a good evening and good night."

         -------------------------------------------------


Wow!! Very short but very sweet, considering that MILLIONS of people
probably saw it! Kate was very hard to understand and I'm not even
sure I got what she said right. The "hears this" could be wrong. I
played it over &amp; over and still wasn't sure. The "devastated" was
hard to hear &amp; understand. Anyone casually watching it probably
didn't understand a word she said. She was beautiful! It's strange
that they showed TSW video with RT music playing. AND WHERE DID
THEY GET THE RHYTHMS OF THE WORLD??? It's obviously been transferred
to NTSC. AAAHHHHH!! Where did they get the interview???

DOES ANYBODY HAVE FRIENDS AT ABC?????????
RELATIVES?????????
KNOW A JANITOR??????

A friend of mine called me up and said that she thought that the
news was going to do a feature on Trio Bulgarka. I was resting (well,
being lazy) but got up to set a tape running. I'm so glad!!
I haven't watched Network News for about 10 years! We're CNN junkies.

Well, I've had enough excitement for today. Ta ta.
