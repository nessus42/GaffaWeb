Vickie here. Yet another playlist. I keep expecting to get flamed for
taking up space on the net for these. Everyone's been very nice though.
My show is extremely important to me and I'm always excited by the
knowledge that all these great artists and songs exist. I want to share
them with the world. Since I'm not syndicated, this is the closest I'll
ever get. Also, you all are constantly giving me ideas and inspiration 
and I want you to know when you do. My sincere thanks.

Judy Nylon            On-U Sound Celebration       The Dice

------------
I hadn't really intended to devote 45 minutes to Neneh Cherry but I'm
glad I did. Very few people know about her work before Raw Like Sushi.
I've only recently come across most of this stuff and I know my
collection is woefully lacking. Would anyone happen to have a more complete
Neneh Cherry discography? I know Rip Rig &amp; Panic had album(s) but I don't
have any. I'd probably never find them anyway. I imagine they're rare.

Does anyone know anything about: Queen Latifah, Pigbag, Amazulu or Judy
Nylon? I borrowed these records and had never heard them before yesterday.

Thanks!
See you next week
