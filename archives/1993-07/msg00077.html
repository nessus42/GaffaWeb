Oops! Quoting from the wrong female artist there :)

Anyhow, maybe I can help Ed clear up the question of vocal and non-vocal
music in skating. Vocal music is explicitly forbidden in competition, cf
the Canadian Figure Skating Association rules, which are the same as the
International Skating Union rules: "Free skating music must not contain
vocals".

Those who saw Torvill and Dean skating to vocal music at the 84 Olympics
saw the exhibition of champions, after the official competition is over and
you can do whatever you want. For most skaters unfortunately this seems to
mean skating around with a pained "aching in love" look on the face while
Michael Bolton or someone equally horrid wails over the PA. Too much
breathing Zamboni fumes, I expect.

Just to cloud the issue again, however, the judges seem to be getting a
little laxer in their interpretation of "no vocals". Three years ago Kurt
Browning used "Tequila" as the music for his short program, complete with
the "Tequila" interjection. And at last year's world championship there
were a number of competitors who used music with massed choirs going
"Aaaaaah" in the background. This would have been forbidden not too long
ago.

Also the Canadian Figure Skating Association is now offering tests and
competitions in artistic skating, "in which emphasis is placed on the
skaters' ability to use their skills to interpret music rather than on
their technical prowess....The skater is unrestricted as to choice of music
except that vocal music may be used at the Gold and Master's levels only".

Now to get Kate B.'s music into the next Olympics, all someone has to do is
get hold of the non-vocal version of "The Sensual World" and go for it!
