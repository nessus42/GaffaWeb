<PRE>
Someone (was it Marcel Rijs) has counted IED among an "in-crowd" here
at Love-Hounds, and IED wants to respond.  Personal acquaintanceship
with several philocanines is nearly inevitable when association with a
discussion group lasts (as IED's with Love-Hounds has lasted) some
eight years.  Veteran members of this group will remember well (too
well, no doubt) that there was a time when IED felt his phosphorous
persona to be very much under attack, in the Jornian sense.  He did
not consider himself to be a member of the "in-crowd" for a very long
time.  In any event whatever status might obtain in said crowd is
entirely illusory.  After all, what fortune is it if one gain the world of
Kate Bush fans, but lose one's Internet access (as, alas! IED is about
to do again)? 

Marcel also states that the German TV program, "Kate Bush in Concert",
had no Dutch counterpart.  In fact, there were two editions of that
program, one for the Dutch market -- it is dubbed differently than the
German original. IED (like Chris and Vickie) has seen both.

Also, Marcel may inadvertantly be misleading some Love-Hounds when he
refers to "hundreds" of full-length live shows given by Kate.  In
fact, the number was much smaller than that, and some of them weren't
even full-length (she caught a cold or the 'flu during the tour's move
from England to the Continent, and some shows were shortened). In any
event, only one video-recording has ever been confirmed, and Chris
reported accurately that the unreleased portions of that recording are
very likely to remain so.   

Marcel asks about the bootleg product(s) entitled "If You Could See Me
Fly": there are indeed two entirely unrelated recordings which go by
that title.  The first is a vinyl album containing excerpts from the
Bill Duffield charity concert; the second is one of the two CDs that
contain, between them, most of the so-called "Cathy demos" which
(according to Love-Hounds' much-valued late intelligence) Kate doesn't much
like to see on the market! This disk's companion CD is called "Passing
Through Air", which is confusing enough, too, since that was not only
the title of Kate's own legitimately released b-side (from the Army
Dreamers single), but also of a ca.-1985 bootleg multi-LP vinyl album
which contained brazenly illegal transfers of most of Kate's b-sides
to date, but no "Cathy demos".  

IED would just like to repeat for the record that Kate has, after many
years of prevariKation, come right out and said that she does, indeed, believe
in the paranormal.  Do with this fact what you will, but be aware that
the existence of the paranormal has now been positively confirmed by
She Who Really Is, and that therefore all further speculation and argument
about its existence will be superfluous.

Finally, will someone please, please video-tape Jerry Bryant's TV
interview with Kate Bush on Chicago's JBTV (Ch. 66?), or on WWOR TV
tomorrow night?  Ditto for anyone in the Boston area who is near a VCR
whenever RAGE TV (Boston Ch. 38?) broadcasts its interview with Kate.
And the same goes for the Des O'Connor show (12/22, UK TV) appearance.
IED will humbly offer his paranormal soul (or something of even greater
value, to be negotiated in private!) in trade for a copy of each.
