Monika Deol (co-host):
 'The Red Shoes' is Kate Bush's first album in 4 years.  In Toronto
 for a brief promotional tour, she spoke with 'The New Music's 
 Jannalynna (sp?) White about the album's theme of dancing shoes,
 which was inspired by the 1948 film of the same name.

&lt;cut to Rubberband Girl video, American style (chorus)&gt;

JW: I was wondering what 'The Red Shoes' represented for you on a
    metaphorical level, based on knowing that it's an old European
    story.

KB: &lt;sitting, hands folded in lap, wearing leather biker's jacket&gt;
    I, I suppose it -- on lots of levels it's, it's very symbolic, but,
    uh, I guess it's the idea of being possessed by art that I think is,
    um, is particularly interesting to me, and the idea of, um, once you
    embrace the obsession, that in a way it begins, or it can, actually,
    take control of you, uh, and I think in some ways with my work, it's
    quite often a battle between who's in charge when I'm making
    records, you know, if it's it or me.

&lt;cut to "When I slip out of my catapult..."&gt;

JW: I've seen your progression as a dancer and a singer and--
    &lt;clip from 'Moving', Live at the Hammersmith&gt;
    and I think, "God, she does it all so well," and yet I sense that
    you have a level of dissatisfaction around your dance.  Is that
    true?

KB: Oh yes, absolutely.  I think I have a level of dissatisfaction
    around everything I do, really.  I don't think I'd want to keep
    doing it if I didn't.  It's--in a way, it's, uh, the desire to try 
    and actually do something that you'r pleased with that, uh, &lt;laughing&gt;
    keeps you motivated.

(Merry Christmas, IED, we'll miss you as always.)

Peace,
