<PRE>

Before I start, I want to voice my complete annoyance at the
increasing number of totally pointless postings that have
tainted this fine Kate digest as of late.

I think its about time we have some moderation here. I'd
be pleased to post to a moderated digest, where all 
non Kate posts are simply REFUSED to be distributed.

I think a well defined charter should be agreed upon, from which 
a moderator could decide which postings are acceptable to 
distribute via the digest and those that must be rejected and
sent back to the sender.

LOVE HOUNDS T-SHIRTS:
---------------------
 What is happening here? Its summer over here in Australia and
 I was really looking forward to wearing a love hounds T shirt!

 I must stress again that the SERIGRAPHIA T shirt company in
 America does an excellent job with multicolour T shirt prints, I have
 2 Salvador Dali T shirts that are fantastic.

 I was impressed when I read about how someone mentioned 
 to Kate at the Tower Records signings that the size of the love
 hounds fan club was around 30 000 members!. 
 Maybe we should include the exact number on the T shirt?

 Lets continue on with the discussion regarding the style and design of the
 T shirt. To keep the traffic down I suggest we email all suggestions
 to ONE person who compiles them into a SINGLE post to LOVE HOUNDS. 

 I suggest that initial person to be ME:
 
    rfrost@jrc.flinders.edu.au

 else we could use whoever else was controlling the T-shirt earlier 
 (sorry I forgot your name).

PS
 Thanks to all those who posted their experiences at the Tower 
 signings! I loved them all especially the story about the girl that
 used all her money to travel to New York and had none left for
 accommodation, so she sleeped in the bus shelter!
