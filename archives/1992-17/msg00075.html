&gt;&gt;She then sang the first cover of the show--Talk Talk's "So
&gt;&gt;Far America," which deserved a lot more attention than it
&gt;&gt;received.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Huh?  I was there (and one of the six or seven people in the audience who
&gt;responded when she asked if anyone was into Talk Talk) and she definitely
&gt;sang something from "The Colour Of Spring".  I think it was "Life's What
&gt;You Make It."

Well, if she didn't introduce it, and the person posting didn't know
the titles of Talk Talk songs, I could see how her singing the mumbled
"Lifeswhachoomakeit" get corrupted, sorta.  Anyway, there's no Talk
Tal song called "So Far America" that I know of on The Party's Over,
It's My Life, The Colour of Spring, Sprit of Eden, or Laughing Stock.

&gt;Speaking of Talk Talk, does anyone know if they've done anything recently?
&gt;TCOS is one of my all time favourite albums, but their followup album was
&gt;way too weird for me.  (The one with the tree on it, I haven't looked at or
&gt;listened to it in so long I forget the title).

Both SoE and LS have trees on the cover, but I assume you mean Soe.
One man's weird is another man's gorgeous; I personally nearly cried
the first time I listened to SoE, it was so eerie, and moody, and
charged with some weird otherworldy essence.  But, as they say, IMHO.

There was a "greatest hits" compilation, I think.  There was also some
sort of dance-remix album that was done without the band's consent,
and a legal row followed, as usual.

After SoE, I think it was pretty obvious that Hollis and Friese-Green
wee NOT gonna do another "Dum Dum Girl" ever again.  That phase of the
band is definately over, and I don't compare SoE/LS to what came
before.
