Hi all,

    Well, its been an amazing weekend! I have spend weeks reading Gaffa and 
hearing how all you guys are really enjoying the Tori concerts etc.. Well, I'm 
flicking around the telly on Friday night when I hit the intro for Tori on the 
"Tonight Live" show out of channel seven in Melbourne!! I got the whole thing on 
video including the interview after she sang Winter and I'll write it up and 
send it off to RDT soon (so don't worry Gaffa).

    They didn't mention any tour so I rang the show and asked. Nobody their knew 
if she was here to tour, I started to get the sinking feeling that her vist was 
just a pro-mo thing. I thought I'd kick myself for not having at least tried so 
I asked if I could talk to her. 10 minets later, I know I'm within one phone 
transfer of her when somebody steps in and pulls the plug :-( ...So close....

    After that she appeared on some Saturday morning shows (I got them taped 
too) this included a bizzare segment where she was pounced upon by some women 
who then read the BACK of her hand!? FYI she was told she was told she isn't a 
"no person".

    Later on Saturday I picked up Drum Magazine a free publication, music guide 
etc. And there is Tori on the front cover, large interview in the middle AND the 
date of her ONE show in Sydney. It's 7:00pm TONIGHT!!! :-) 8-) I'm on my way 
with CD in hand for a signiture!!!

- Graham
