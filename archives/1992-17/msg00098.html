&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;     Last night I was flicking around through the channels and caught an add for 
&gt;&gt; the "Tonight Live" show on 7. The add said that they would be talking to Tori 
&gt;&gt; Amos (along with stunning picture of her) that night! So I wait up video in hand 
&gt;&gt; and suffer through the whole thing... NO Tori Amos!!!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;     When I rang them today they said she was ment to be on but pulled out in the 
&gt;&gt; last minute. Damm...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; You know, I actually went to be part of the audience at this show, and needless
&gt; to say was *extremely* disappointed when i found Tori wasn't going to be on. I
&gt; found out when i got there because a friend of mine works on Tonight Live
&gt; organizing guests and so on. Anyway, the penthouse pet of the year was on so it
&gt; wasn't a complete loss :)
&gt;  
&gt; Seriously though, we decided to go back last friday night when we knew she
&gt; would be on, and it was just incredible. Tori came out in these flared jeans
&gt; through all the smoke that the studio guys had set up, and sat at her piano
&gt; and began to sing...it was one of the most amazing performances i've seen...
&gt; so much emotion ...and that voice! She did a lot of breathing into the mic
&gt; between lyrics, which made you feel very close to her...like hmmm...it reminded
&gt; me in a way of the start of "This woman's work". Oh, by the way, the song she
&gt; played was "Winter" (Is that right? I dont have the album yet).

Well, I saw this on television, and I have to admit, she is very good:  she
certainly puts a lot of drama into her songs.  I wouldn't call it the most
amazing performance I have ever seen (that goes to Christy Moore!!! - but how I
would love to see Nurset Fateh Ali Khan, live!) but it is certainly ONE of the
best.

I normally don't watch 'Tonight Live' because I can't stand Steve Vizard, but
on Fridays, comedian Richard Stubbs hosts the show and he is a treat!  What the
above forgot to mention that Stubbsy did have a little chat with Tori after the 
song:  apparently she has been touring since OCTOBER!  She strikes me as a very
serious person and is cautious when humour is introduced into the conversation.
(but then Stubbsy is a bit of a galah, and that usually puts any unaquainted
American off guard).

Alas, I think Tori is in Australia strictly for a promotional tour (and an
occasional sing).  If she'll have a concert here, I will definately go.

&gt; The guy i went with brought his Tori Amos CD along and gave it to my friend to
&gt; get signed...and she signed it all right. She wrote 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;        Dave....much love...Tori Amos
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Lucky bastard! :)
&gt;

Agreed.  Imagine if it was Kate Bush or enya autographing a CD!!!  Angeles...
 
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, I'm a convert!
&gt;

Not quite, for me.  But she is interesting.
 
&gt; 
&gt;   Greg
&gt; 



Cheers,
Mik.
