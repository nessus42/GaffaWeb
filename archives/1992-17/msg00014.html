Hi!

From:	kyrlidis@Athena.MIT.EDU

&gt;a) Has KaTe ever talked about these songs? Some of them seem extremely serious
&gt;for a 16 year old. 'Playing canasta in cold rooms' is an example. It is 
&gt;quite eery.

Oh, Ron?!?!?  We need you, Ron!!!  ;)

&gt;b) In 'Feeling like a Waltz' she speaks a line in french. Does she speak the 
&gt;language? ( All the songs she has done in a language other than English
&gt;have been in french, but I am just checking )

I think she took it in school- I'm not sure, but it would seem to me that she
does feel comfortable enough with it to sing in it.  I wonder if she knows any
German- people say she doesn't, but it appears in her stuff in the strangest
places.  At the very least I'd be willing to bet she's a closet German-speaker.
There are lots of us out there. :)

&gt;Which brings me to the question that puzzles me the most. Why would KaTe want 
&gt;to go back to the piano? She wouldn't be breaking any new ground. Admittedly 
&gt;it would take away the pressure to do something *extremely new* and would
&gt;undoubtedly please fans, but imagine all the Tori Amos comparisons... :)

Ha.  Why would she want to go back to the piano?  To simplify things.  To avoid
having to learn to program the new Fairlight.  She herself feels she wrote her
best stuff on the piano, I think... I for one was glad to hear that she was
going back to it.
