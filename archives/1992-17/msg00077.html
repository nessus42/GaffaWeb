I am not I_SW@zis.ziff.com (Sam Warren).  I didn't say:
&gt;To the person who wrote in about Minnie Ripperton on The Orb album -

that's me.

&gt;Thanks a lot for sharing this information.  I bought the album, and I think
&gt;it's great.  BUT, I don't hear samplings of Minnie ANYWHERE.  You said
&gt;something about a 20 minute version.  Well, the one I have is only 7 minutes. 

you have:

Aubrey Mixes: The Ultraworld Excursions

whereas the correct album to buy is called

Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld

&gt;Strange thing, when I bought it (used), there was a sticker on the outside that
&gt;said "CD is Aubrey mixes".  So I asked what that meant and the guy told me that 
&gt;the cover was the wrong one.  This was not the album itself, but rather a disc
&gt;of remixes (by this guy named Aubrey) of songs on the album.  Maybe this would
&gt;explain why Minnie's voice doesn't appear?

I don't know about you getting a disc with the wrong cover, but I guess
anything is possible.  The remix disc has some good stuff, but the version
of A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain is devoid of Minnie Ripperton
samples, I believe.  Incidentally, "aubrey" had nothing to do with the
remixes.  They were done by:

Little Fluffy Clouds -&gt; Pal Joey
Back Side Of The Moon -&gt; Steve Hillage
Spanish Castles In Space -&gt; Youth (yeah, the same one who played bass on
                   "The Big Sky" - how's that for tenuous Kate content?)
Huge Ever Growing Brain -&gt; Cauty/Paterson
Perpetual Dawn -&gt; The Orb

I don't know why the damn thing is called The Aubrey Mixes.  Really.

&gt;Have you seen the 20 minute version on CD?

Yeah.  On the "Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld" album.  It's actually more
like 18+ minutes, but who's counting...

&gt;Does this group have any other albums?

Not really.  There's a "Peel Sessions" disc which has three tracks on it
(including "Brain"), but these are not new songs - just more remixes.

There's supposedly a new album called U.F.Orb coming out Real Soon Now.

I can't wait.
