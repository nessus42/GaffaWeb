Yeah, for the ditty on the special rerelease of HOL, I hope it does get
mentioned that HOL is what brought Kate to people's attention in the US.

I bought the RUTH single and played it to death, then got the CD.
HOL was actually the first recording in Compact Disc format I ever
bought.  I then slowly worked back through the rest of her collection
(which was great--gave me something to fill in the gaps between
releases).

&gt; Mmmmmmmm.... where to begin?
&gt; 
&gt; HoL was the first Kate Bush I ever heard.  My college roommate was a DJ
&gt; for the college radio station (WFIT in Melbourne, FL), and brought this
&gt; promo disk home one day and said "you've got to hear this stuff, it's
&gt; amazing!"  I, being completely into metal (Maiden, Priest, etc.) said
&gt; "So?"  But the songs stuck in my head, and I was familiar with the name
&gt; due to the heavy press blitz that occurred around the time TKI was
&gt; released, and also from the Benetar cover of "Wurthering Heights".
&gt; 
&gt; 12 years later, I was in a CD store and on a whim, bought HoL (along with
&gt; Black Sabbath's Headless Cross and some other metal disk to cover all the
&gt; bases).  It seemed very familiar, yet new and different.  It's still my
&gt; sentimental favorite KT album, although I think The Dreaming is the best
&gt; she's done so far.  HoL is brilliant because it retains the experimental,
&gt; wild edge of The Dreaming yet makes it accessible without compromising a
&gt; whole lot.  KT's singing is also very strong - somehow "deeper" in a
&gt; spiritual sort of way than what had come before.
&gt; 
&gt; HoL (and The Dreaming) are unique in my record collection in that you
&gt; can't just throw them on and putter around in the house or whatever.
&gt; They demand your undivided attention.  The "special effects" (this isn't
&gt; really the right word) defy description.  How did she come up with this
&gt; stuff?  Somehow I find the existence of these albums strangly comforting
&gt; - just the fact that an artist could create something like this makes me
&gt; feel better about being a human being.
&gt; 
&gt; What an honor, Peter.  Thanks for letting us throw our 2 cents in!
