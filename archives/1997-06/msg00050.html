&gt; I have heard from two rather reliable sources who have met Kate in
&gt;person that she has a large (one might say disfiguring?) scar on one side
&gt;of her face. 

Chris answers:

&gt;&gt;   Complete nonsense. Kate *does* have an adorable *dimple* on her
&gt;&gt;cheek. I've stood less than 2' from her on a couple of occasions, 

lucky man! ("how does she smell?  with her nose, you idiot!")

&gt;&gt;handed
&gt;&gt;her videotapes and things to sign. I've also seen photos of Kate working 
&gt;&gt;out, Kate putting on her make-up and various other unprepared, 
&gt;&gt;unretouched shots. From what I could see, her skin is damn near 
&gt;&gt;flawless, a classic "English Rose".

That's the description I get too.

&gt;&gt;Christ! Where do people get this stuff? 

Because under certain lighting and in some photographs, the dimple 
is very prominent.  It shows up when she smiles.  It wasn't as 
prominent when she was younger.  But if the lighting is just right 
or just wrong, it is very evident.  When one watches the interview 
for The Sensual World from VH-1, it shows.

&gt;Well, being of a skeptical nature and thinking the Mixman sounded like it
&gt;was too good to be true, I e-mailed them . . . for your enlightenment here
&gt;is the reply:

&gt;&gt;&gt;With regards to remixing from your CDs, it is impossible to do.

Strictly speaking, that is true with regards to remixing track for
track.
There is a device that allows one to filter and get rid of 
vocals, but it doesn't work very well.  You see it advertised i 
magazines still.    It is possible to isolate some 
parts of a sound using frequency filters, but you would not 
be happy with the final results.  The problem is the frequencies will 
overlap and you won't get just one instrument but portions of each.

In the old days of four and three track recording, portions of the 
tracks were mixed together and sent to one side or the other of a 
pseudo stereo image so overdubs were clearer.  Most of the Beatles 
albums are like that, so you can use your stereo pan control to 
isolate some parts of the original.

BTW:  this kind of Mixman remix control is becoming a standard feature 
for multimedia music CDs.  I think Peter Gabriel uses that.  So, if 
kate ever decides to go more hi-tech, she can do this if she likes.
There is a big art debate over reader vs author presentation that has 
aspects of that issue.
