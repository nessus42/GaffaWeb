It's hard for me to think of a song I don't like on The Red Shoes... I
think either Rubberband Girl or Eat the Music would be my least favorite,
but I don't *dislike* either one. I really like Moments of Pleasure, The
Red Shoes, And So Is Love and Big Stripey Lie (pretty far-reaching group
there). 

Tangent:  I finally got The Line, The Cross and The Curve, and I really
enjoyed it!  Some of the images Kate was playing with as a director were
really powerful.  And Miranda Richardson was great.  "And I don't see you
smilin'."  

As for this whole Tori/Kate thing... why the hells are some people so bent
on pitting them versus one another?  I love Tori.  I love Kate.  I've
loved Kate for years before Tori came along and my adoration for her has
not lessened; although it's fair to say that Tori's *superficial*
resemblance to Kate at the very beginning of the Little Earthquakes launch
caught my attention, it certainly isn't what held it.  They are very
different (although that was sure a good point someone brought up about
Jon Kelly's being the engineer on Kate's 1st two albums and Tori's first
solo album being partially responsible for any resemblance -- other than
soprano songwriter chick and piano).  Tori's great at being Tori, and
Kate's great at being Kate.  If I had to say which one was better, I
couldn't answer that.

I doubt either Tori or Kate is spending loads of time being too concerned
about what the other is doing or how they might "measure up" side by side,
so why should we?  Isn't it more fun to enjoy their music?

Both are wonderful artists, and have brought their own magic into my life.
I won't demean that by trying to make them fit into some silly comparison
chart, or by matching them together like gladiators (although that
presents an interesting mental image!).  There's room in my sensual world
for all manner of precious things.

A DediKated Love-Hound *and* Toriphile,
Susan
