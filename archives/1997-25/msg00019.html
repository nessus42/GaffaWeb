&gt; &gt; &gt;It has just been confirmed that Elton John will sing "Candle in the
&gt; &gt; &gt;Wind" during Princess Diana's funeral.  Originally this song was
&gt; &gt; &gt;written for Marilyn Monroe but he revised and personalized the lyrics
&gt; &gt; &gt;for Diana.  I will attempt to get the exact lyrics and e-mail them to
&gt; &gt; &gt;those who are interested.

Greetings Lovehounds,   

    I've found the new lyrics for Candle In The Wind in an article posted
in the newsgroup: clari.news.obituaries.    The article is as follows:

   LONDON, Sept 4 (AFP) - Elton John, pop-star friend of Diana,  
Princess of Wales, will sing at the funeral of the princess on 
Saturday. Here are the words of an adaptation of his hit song Candle 
in the Wind, written in memory of the princess. 
   The orignial hit, penned in the early 1970s, was written as a  
tribute to the late movie icon Marilyn Monroe. 
   The lyrics of the song are as follows:  

   Goodbye England's rose;  
   may you ever grow in our hearts.  
   You were the grace that placed itself  
   where lives were torn apart.  
   You called out to our country,  
   and you whispered to those in pain.  
   Now you belong to heaven,  
   and the stars spell out your name.  

   And it seems to me you lived your life  
   like a candle in the wind:  
   never fading with the sunset  
   when the rain set in.  
   And your footsteps will always fall here,  
   along England's greenest hills;  
   your candle's burned out long before  
   your legend ever will.  

   Loveliness we've lost;  
   these empty days without your smile.  
   This torch we'll always carry  
   for our nation's golden child.  
   And even though we try,  
   the truth brings us to tears;  
   all our words cannot express  
   the joy you brought us through the years.  

   Goodbye England's rose,  
   from a country lost without your soul,  
   who'll miss the wings of your compassion  
   more than you'll ever know.

...and say hi to Jerry for me.   :~(


peace and love
