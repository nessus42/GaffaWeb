&gt;is 
&gt;Rekha.  My source (a Hindu lady at work who recommended the film) says 
&gt;that Rekha has been a very prominent and successful actress in the
&gt;Indian 
&gt;file industry.  Apparently, Indian film actresses are extremely well 
&gt;trained in dance, mime, and singing.  Rekha has a role in the new 
&gt;film, Kama Sutra.  I did find a site on the Internet that sells 
&gt;Indian films including Umrao Jann.  I see the work and realize what 
&gt;Kate Bush could be capable of with that rich a tradition.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Another recommendation I'd put forward is a new film called "Fire",
which I
&gt;saw a few months ago at the &gt;theatre here in S.F.  I think it is in
English,
&gt;for those put off by subtitles.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I read the review of this on a page discussing Hindi and Indian
&gt;films.  It 
&gt;and Kama Sutra are a bit of a scandal there given the subject matter. 
&gt;I'm not sure 
&gt;if the local Indian food store that rents vids will have Fire, but I'll
&gt;be on 
&gt;the lookout for it!
&gt;
&gt;We attended the celebration of Indian Independence last night here with 
&gt;my friend from work and her husband.  The food and dress were exquisite, 
&gt;and afterwards, they all danced to music which was Indian melody and 
&gt;instrumentation (string-heavy) over a quasi extal/tintal disco beat.  
&gt;Very interesting construction as the longer the pieces go, the more 
&gt;overpowering and frenzied they become.   Long lines of mostly women 
&gt;in incredible costumes whirled and moved while striking sticks in 
&gt;common with the beat.  Incredible!  Eat the Music makes a lot more 
&gt;sense in this context than the semi-voodoo context of the vid.
&gt;
&gt;The cultural speakers and panel discussions 
&gt;were most interesting.  They all seemed to agree that the most serious
&gt;problem 
&gt;in India is corruption.  I found it disturbing that among these desi,
&gt;not a 
&gt;one mentioned what the World Health Organization lists as the most
&gt;significant 
&gt;problem:  the devaluation of Indian women.  The health statistics are
&gt;apalling.  
&gt;It is a subject even my Indian friends are uncomfortable discussing.
&gt;
&gt;len

Also check out a video called God is my Witness" and Idian film starring
Sri Devi , who looks and dances like Kate.  The first time I saw it I
freaked out and was speechless....it is obvious aftrer seeing that the
Kate really knows a lot of classical Indian dance that comes out in her
videos.
