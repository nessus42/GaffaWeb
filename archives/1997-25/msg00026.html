<PRE>
IED, like Karen, didn't receive the Digest that would have included
Krys's long posting.  Something is definitely screwed up with the
distribution of Love-Hounds these days.

By the way, IED found a way to read these MIME-encoded Digests, though
he still has no idea why they continue to come in that format.  It never
used to happen, but now it occurs at least once a week.  Nor did the change
coincide with any changes in AOL's software, so that wouldn't appear to be
the reason for the problem.

Does anyone know who our Pseudo-Moderator actually is these days?  Now
that Bill Wisner has moved to Europe, is IED right in assuming that he no
longer oversees distribution of the Digest, even though it still comes out
of the same server he used to oversee?  Bill, are you still with us?

Sincere thanks to Murray Browne for his report about Ian Bairnson's comments.
What a clever idea to find out whether Bairnson is online.  Does anyone know
about e-mail addresses for other of Kate's former/current collaborators?

During the coverage of the funeral last weekend British TV (which was carried
by A&amp;E Network in the U.S. without the insufferable commentary by American
journalists that plagued the other American stations' coverage) had an
interview with Chris DeBurgh (who was very eloquent, IED thought), and played
a video of his own new song in Diana's memory.  

This led IED to wonder whether other such British musical luminaries were
interviewed or otherwise noted in the English media whom US newspeople
wouldn't have known about.  Has any word been heard from or about Kate in all
this?  One can presume, can't one, that she had had occasion to meet the
Princess
at some point or other during the last sixteen years?
