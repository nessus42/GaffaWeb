i can't fully begin to express the immense sadness i feel at the passing of
a truly beautiful soul.  Princess Diana was a remarkably thoughtful,
generous, caring and beautiful individual who will be sorely missed by all
of us.  she not only touched Britons, but people everywhere.  it's so very
sad that in order to escape the madness of  the past 16 years you have to
leave everyone you love, and who loved you, behind.  i cannot imagine the
grief of her children.

her humanitarian efforts, like her life, should be an example for us all. 
i sat in shock and tears, then anger when i heard of her death.  i wonder
what our purpose while we're alive really is...why is it that someone who
has done so much to better the state of the world dies, when others who do
nothing to contribute to the well being of the human condition continue to
do just that...nothing.

it seemed that she had finally found true love and happiness, but those
monsters who believe that "when you are a public figure, you belong to
everyone" would not let her be.  she lived a remarkable life, and will be
remembered not for all the paparazzi crap that was written, nor for the
messy details of an all to public personal life...but for the woman she
was.  as quoted by Lord Jeffrey Archer, "...she was the brightest star in
our consolation..."

good-bye Diana.

...just being alive it can really hurt-these moments given are a gift from
time
just let us try to give these moments back to those we love to those who
will survive...hey there Diana, got a smile for me...
