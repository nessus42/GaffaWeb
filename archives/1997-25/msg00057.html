&gt; 
&gt; Greetings Love-hounds,
&gt; 
&gt;    About a month ago a bought the bootleg video called "The
&gt; Collection"
&gt; (Not to be confused with the Lovehound Collection which we all know
&gt; was a
&gt; beautiful piece of collaborative work from some of our more
&gt; distinguished
&gt; Lovehounds).   Anyway, Ther are a few items of interest in this video.
&gt; BTW, it is listed in the collector's guide on page 108...but the video
&gt; track list is inaccurate.  Obviously, the author only read the track
&gt; list
&gt; off the cover).     Most of what's on this video is already available
&gt; in
&gt; the Lovehounds Collection or Kateopia.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, here goes:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The Wedding List  (Prince's Trust Concert)
&gt;        - yes, this is the piece where Kate's dress straps snap towards
&gt;          the end of the performance.       (picture qaulity:  B)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  The Man With The Child In His Eyes  &amp;
&gt;     Them Heavy People   (Saturday Night Live)
&gt;        - picture quality:  C
&gt;

&gt;        - Kate performs live and is wearing a Tuxedo.
&gt;        - pic. quality: D
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Babooshka   (Collard, FRANCE, 1980)
&gt;        - Kate mimes to a backdrop of a winter scenery.  She's wearing
&gt; a
&gt;          green "sparkly" dress and a cape
&gt;        - Pic. Quality: D
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Suspended In Gaffa  (Champs Elysees, FRANCE, Oct. 1982)
&gt;        - Kate mimes to a backdrop of a Russian scenery.   She's
&gt; wearing a
&gt;          grey dress with "puffy" shoulders".  There's a B&amp;W picture of
&gt; this
&gt;          performance in the book "The Whole Story" by Kerry Juby.
&gt; BTW, the
&gt;          photo describes her as performing "Egypt".
&gt;        - Pic. quality: D-
&gt; 
&gt; 6.  December Will Be Magic Again   (Abba special, Dec. 1979?)

&gt; a
&gt;          red chair.

&gt; She's wearing
&gt;          black pants &amp; white t-shirt.  The 2 dancers are also wearing
&gt; a black
&gt;          mask.  The choreography is slightly different from what is in
&gt; the
&gt;          official video.
&gt;          Here, we can see a 10 shilling note animated on the screen
&gt; along with
&gt; a
&gt; 
&gt; "tenner" and a "fiver"   ...for those of you wondering what she's
&gt;          singing about...

&gt; 20. Interview  (Countdown, dutch TV, Nov. 1985)
&gt;        - Kate is interviewed in english.  Ther are dutch subtitles.
&gt;        - Pic. quality: C
&gt; 
&gt; Total running time:  1:23
&gt; 
&gt; For those of you wondering,  I found this video at a used record store
&gt; called
&gt; Second Coming  in Cambridge, boston, Mass.  (near Harvard square).
&gt; They did
&gt; have another one available for $15.00....I think...)  (I do not work
&gt; for them)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm willing to make the "new" stuff available for a future video
&gt; collection
&gt; project (like the Lovehounds Collection or Kate-opia).  Just email me
&gt; and we
&gt; can set something up.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; peace

======================
Looks like there's quite a bit on video that I haven't kept up on. I'd
be interested in where I could get anything on video that I've not seen
yet, especially interviews, and *most* especially if there's some way to
get special features such as that 1989 VH-1 special (that I only heard
about, and never got to see).

What I've seem so far is:

  The Whole Story
  The Sensual World Videos
  The Singles File
  The Line, the Cross and the Curve
