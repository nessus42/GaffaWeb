This is my fourth list of new CDs for sale. There's a few new releases, and
a few classics that have made the transition to CD. I've also spent a couple
of lines describing each item, without appearing too judgemental, I hope.
Many of these are single items, and those will be sold to the first buyer.
However, if there is a large demand for any items, there's a good possibility
that I might be able to re-order them.

All these items will be in stock by January 6. The country shown in brackets
indicates the country of the pressing, not the artist/band.

******************************************************************************
If you would like a FULL LIST of progressive rock/electronic music CDs that I
can supply, please let me know and I will e-mail it to you. The list contains
many items that have not appeared on any of my sale lists, and include CDs by
Caravan, Gandalf, Keith Emerson, Strawbs, etc.
******************************************************************************

Please reply to ...

E-MAIL : ranjit@synopsys.com (accessible through sun, pyramid, etc.)
USMAIL : Ranjit Padmanabhan, 566 Crystalberry Terrace, San Jose, CA 95129

Once I get your reply, I will send you an invoice. Shipping costs are $ 1.95
for Book Rate (7 - 10 working days), or $ 2.95 for Air Mail (2 - 4 days), on
any sized order, in the US.

***** PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE ON MY MAILING LIST *****

Be-Bop Deluxe - Axe Victim/Drastic Plastic/Futurama/Live In The Air Age/
                Modern Music/Sunburst Finish [all UK] .... $ 20.95 ea.

The whole catalog from Bill Nelson's quirky techno-prog-rock band has been
out on CD for a couple of months. The music is not categorized as progressive
in the style of mellotron/keyboard symphonics, but is more within the realm
of intelligent rock music comparable in spirit to Peter Hammill's solo
material. For those unfamiliar with Be-Bop Deluxe, _Modern Music_ or
_Sunburst Finish_ would probably be the best starting points.

Bush, Kate - This Woman's Work [8CD boxed set] [UK] .... $ 149.95
             ***** FREE SHIPPING ON THIS ITEM *****

I had ordered this from two sources to make sure that I got a personal set.
Both suppliers came through leaving me with an extra set. The price includes
Air Mail shipping in the USA, and I am open to lower offers if no one takes
this off my hands at this price. As far as the package goes, it contains all
the UK releases of Ms. Bush and 2 CDs of singles, B-sides, rarities, etc.

Echo &amp; The Bunnymen - New, Live, Rare [Japan] .... $ 22.95

I am not particularly familiar with this band, but have a sealed copy of this
CD, which was sent to me by mistake by my supplier. If no one is interested in
this, I will send it back. Correct me if I am wrong, but the vocalist has
a serious Jim Morrison influence, and the band is one of the more introspective
of the (warning - ignorant use of categorization follows ...) college bands.

Freudiana [Holland] .... $ 24.95
This is the soundtrack to an opera by the Alan Parsons Project, headed by
Eric Woolfson, and contains around 70 minutes of their new material, influenced
more by their older releases than by any of the recent stuff. It has only been
released in Holland so far, and is somewhat difficult to find here.

Hackett, Steve - Bay Of Kings [UK] .... $ 23.95

Of all the Hackett CDs, this is the hardest to find domestically. I have two
copies of this, one is spoken for, and only one remains. If you are interested
in other Steve Hackett CDs, ask me for my full CD list, which will be promptly
e-mailed to you.

Moraz, Patrick - I [Japan] .... $ 34.95

This, the much in demand masterpiece by Mr. Moraz, is now available. I had to
ask a dealer on the East Coast to hold a few for me, and he was willing to do
so if I was willing to pay his store list price, just upward of $ 30. I will
have access to the reserved copies for two weeks, and then they go back into
circulation, so please reply soon if you are interested in picking this up.
The music is keyboard-dominated rock, with a range of influences from the
symphonic to the ethereal, along with touches of Patrick Moraz' native South
American influence.

Phillips, Anthony - Slow Dance [UK] .... $ 21.95
                    Geese &amp; The Ghost [UK] .... $ 19.95

_Slow Dance_ is Anthony Phillips latest release, and will probably not be
released domestically, due to the demise of Audion. It is surely a progression
from his "Private Parts &amp; Pieces" series, and consists of more keyboards and
guitars in contrast to his stark earlier material. _Geese &amp; The Ghost_ is, in
my opinion, his work that would best appeal to fans of the "progressive"
genre, and is a CD issue of a work from the seventies.

Twelfth Night - Live At The Target [UK] .... $ 18.95

Along with the stream of eighties progressive bands that came out of UK,
such as Marillion and IQ, there were a host of groups that did not achieve
the mass popularity (so to speak) of these two. Any reasons for this are
certainly *not* apparent in their music, which is prime progressive rock,
melding the spirit of the seventies with the technology of the eighties.
Chief among these were the bands Pendragon and Twelfth Night. The former
have a few CDs available, while this is the first one available from Twelfth
Night. This is their best live recording (their best studio work being
_Fact And Fiction_), and is all-instrumental keyboard/guitar-dominant
progressive rock. I also have Pendragon CDs available for those interested.

For those of you who like the eighties style of progressive rock, there are
many new bands of interest whose CDs I can obtain. Some of them are Aragon,
Chandelier, Deyss, etc. and they are the bands who will probably carry the
torch of progressive rock (as we know it) into the nineties.

Vangelis - See You Later [CD] .... $ 22.95

A 1980 release from the synth-master, which is one of his more obscure works,
but contains the excellent "Memories Of Green" track from the soundtrack of
the film "Blade Runner".
