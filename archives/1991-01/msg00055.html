In Article 8854 of rec.music.gaffa:

 jim &lt;lester@ttidca.tti.com&gt; asked :

&gt;Ronald,
&gt;  This is unrelated to Kate, but I'm sure she would approve.  I am going to
&gt;San Diego on the 20th to see Paul Simon.  Since you're in S.D. I thought I'd
&gt;ask you a question or two:
&gt;  Where is the Sports Arena? (I don't have a city map, so there's very little
&gt;detail on the area)
&gt;  Is there anything nearby, like within walking distance?  Or is it out on
&gt;the tiles?
&gt;  Would it be a short (read quick &amp; cheap) ride/walk from the AMTRAK station
&gt;(kicking around the idea of training)?
&gt;  Any other 'local' items you would reccommend to pass a few hours in the
&gt;afternoon or post-concert?
&gt;  When is Kate gonna play there?
&gt;  Tx,
&gt;Jim

I am not sure how often Ron reads gaffa so I though I'd answer being another 
San Diego love-hound (Ron, I'll try and call you).

The Sports Arena is on Sports Arena Blvd, west of I-5 and immediately south of 
I-8. There is an exit off of I-8 for it. It is on the north side of the Blvd  
- you can't miss it and it is visible on your left from I-8 before you exit.

It's not out in the boonies and there is a Tower Records immediately opposite 
which even stocks non-parallel import CDs oooh.  There is a night club also 
right by Tower which recently changed its name.  There are a few shopping 
malls but nothing to get too excited about.  There are some restaurants in the 
area and plenty of fast food at the west end of the Blvd.  And if you like 
sleaze there are some strip joints on Rosecrans which intersects Sports Arena 
Blvd to the east. They are sailor's haunts but is probably quiet now as most 
of them are in the Gulf.

The Amtrak station is downtown and too far to walk unless you don't mind 
walking 5 miles or so.  You could ride (a bike I presume you were meaning) but 
you would need a detailed map to make it as there are freeways to negotiate.  
The bus service here is poor.

"local items" - how local do you want them.  Balboa Park and the Zoo are nice 
places to visit for a few hours and are as far from the Sports Arena as the 
Amtrak station.  Horton Plaza Mall in the heart of downtown is an interesting 
place architecturally and is fun to explore especially if you have money to 
spend :)

I would get a detailed map of the city (are you an AAA member - get the 
central SD map).  SD sprawls just like LA.  And even though it is smaller 
things are spaced out in a similar fashion.  And the car is the only way to 
efficiently get around.  I would recommend driving personally.
