&gt;&gt; While I'm on the subject, can anyone recommend any good Irish bands?
 
&gt; Will Scottish do?  A band called "Capercaillie" is really great. 

second the motion. i saw them last spring on their "sidewaulking across
america" tour and they were quite impressive. and they did "lagan love"
too! :)

&gt; They have two albums out that I know of - "Crosswinds" and "Sidewaulk".

i believe there is two more, but i cannae fer the life of me remember
the titles. 
 
another scottish recommendation: the battlefield band. much more "tra-
ditional" oriented than say the relatively modern arrangements that
capercaille does. most of their stuff is on flying fish as i recall.

&gt; The Bothy Band was the predecessor of Relativity

relativity is kinda sorta a celtic traditional supergroup. they're stuff
is okay, but i like...

&gt; and Triona (I won't try her last name) sang for them, too.

triona o domhnaill (pronouced /o-don-al/). she's also worked with a
group called nightnoise that is worth investigating. they are on 
windam hill and have two albums. the first is called _something of time_
and the second is called _at the end of the evening_. nightnoise is 
billy oskay and triona's brother michael (pronounced /mi-a-hell/).
they have also released a *wonderful* album called _nightnoise_ also
on windam hill that i heartily recommend (if only for the song "cricket's
wicket").
 
&gt; As for bands without female vocalists, Silly Wizard, Tannahill Weavers,
&gt; and any band with Phil Cunningham are good bets.
 
the fiddler for the silly wizard played violin for the boston band the
rain dogs incidentially. they put on a great show too when i saw them
last (and first).

&gt; All of these are available from Green Linnet Records in (I think) New
&gt; Canaan, CT.  They put out a catalog with pretty accurate descriptions
&gt; of the stuff they're selling.

yeah. their address:

	green linnet records
	70 turner hill road
	new canaan, ct 06840

not sure how much catalogs are though. write and find out.
