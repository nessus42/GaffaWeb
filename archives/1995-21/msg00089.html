Hi there,

I've been in my own little conversation with someone (about MIDI
downloading etc), and just to let others know, I did some close
approximations (OK no singing so I used a Calliope, the other
instrumentation IS very close). You can get them from multiple places:
	www	<A  HREF="http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz">http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz</A>
	ftp	ftp.cs.ruu.nl:/pub/MIDI/SONGS/POP
			armydrea.zip
			babushka.zip
			cldbstng.zip
		and associated .doc files too.
I can (if you want) email them, but I'll use uuencode (or btoa if you ask),
so check you have a uudecode program of some form first, sorry email
does not handle binary. I did post them a while back in the newsgroup
	alt.binary.sounds.midi
so if you were downloading from there, you will have seen them earlier
this year.

Anyway, the other person I was talking (well, emailling) with, asked me:

&gt; Will there be new files in the future at that site?  I don't think the song
&gt; from the Fruitopia commercial I wanted was there...it's the one where the
&gt; music has the beat like a heartbeat...do you know which one I'm talking
&gt; about?  Also this guy mentioned she had some albums out called "Never For
&gt; Ever" and "Hounds of Love", which of those albums contains the Fruitopia
&gt; music, if either?

My answers are:

Yes, I'm working on Wuthering Heights, but the summer weather tempts me
outside more than sitting in front of a computer screen. I'll do more
tracks as winter keeps me in more.

The Fruitopia commercial I do not believe is on any KaTe album.
I wonder if anyone knows the background into the Fruitopia deal?

Her main albums have been:
	The Kick Inside		(Feb 78)
	Lionheart		(Nov 78)
	Never For Ever		(Sep 80)
	The Dreaming		(Sep 82)
	Hound Of Love		(Sep 85)
	The Sensual World	(Oct 89)
	The Red Shoes		(Nov 93)
There have been various singles, boxed sets, videos, interviews, bootlegs,
etc, but if you collect the above albums, you'll have all but a few of
her songs.

Interestingly, if you plot of album number vs days since her first
album, shows that up until the last album she took near enough one year
longer to release each album (exception of the Dreaming, which took just
2 months longer than Never For Ever). Then a change, The Red Shoes took
virtually the same time to do as The Sensual World, so extrapolating
this fact she has levelled out to a time to release a new album (ie
once every 4 years), the next one should be out Nov-97. Luckily, the
previous analysis of when The Red Shoes would be released (which was
Nov 94, just count the years between each, they go: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
this would have meant that the next album would have been Nov 2000. But
again I say LUCKILY things have leveled off to just 4 years per album.
This is IF mathematical analysis can be done on the time taken to
produce an album. Maybe she'll surprise the calculation again and
release a year earlier again, ie Nov-1996 - yes!
