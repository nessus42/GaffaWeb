I found this in alt.tv.commercials (No, I don't ordinarily
read that group, but you don't want to know how I found it).

&gt;From: mba01@aol.com (Mba01)

&gt;I have to agree: 
&gt;I dislike Fruitopia ads, especially since these fruit-based beverages are
&gt;mostly corn syrup and water.  However, the previous writer is correct when
&gt;saying that the ads were not targeted to we who dislike the ads.

&gt;For the record, 
&gt;Fruitopia was introduced by Coke in March 1994.  It was an attempt to
&gt;enter the "alternative non-carbonated beverages" market, a market that
&gt;accounts for $2 billion in sales, and is growing by 15% each year. 
&gt;Fruitopia is reported to have had 60% of Snapple's sales in January 95, up
&gt;from 43% of Snapple's sales volume in November 94 (although, I don't think
&gt;this is total sales, but sales in the convenience store channel). 
&gt;Fruitopia's sales were about $20 million for the first quarter 1995.  Ad
&gt;spending for the year is about $30 million

&gt;The whole new-age, 60's psychedelic feel to the ads by Chiat-Day (now part
&gt;of Ominicom) and Kate Bush were probably based on Coke's research that
&gt;said that the target consumer was seeking not only refreshment for their
&gt;body, but refreshment for their mind and spirit as well (corn syrup and
&gt;flavorings?).  Although the new-age-ness of the ads has been toned down,
&gt;Coke Foods must be happy with the 60's theme, since their new
&gt;lower-calorie line of beverages will be branded as "Inner Light."
