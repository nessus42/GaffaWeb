My late entry into this thread.

I, too, was a big Rush fan before I was a KateFan. In fact, I was the 
bassist and lead singer in a band that did quite a few Rush covers. 
Twelve years later and my vocal cords still haven't recovered (...and 
echoes with the sound of salesmen ... of SALESMEN ...  aaaaahhhhh 
SAAAALESMEN!!!!)

My interest in Rush kind of died off after _Grace_Under_Pressure_ -- it 
seemed a lot of the fire and passion had gone out of their music. Ironic 
that one of the last songs they ever did that I really liked was "Losing 
It" which is a wonderful piece about fading talent. They may have done 
more good stuff since then, but I haven't been following their work.

I think there are a lot of connections between Rush and Kate and a lot of 
reasons why a fan of one would like the other. A lot of people who have 
only heard the few Rush songs that get radio airplay don't realize the 
level of originality and depth of many of their compositions. And their 
musicianship is just incredible. Geddy Lee is a bass god, and Lifeson and 
Peart are virtuosos on their instruments -- Peart must have a neatly 
quadrisected brain (completely independent action of all four limbs) to do 
some of the things I've seen/heard him do on drums.

Kate is the only other artist I have had the same "Wow! I've never 
heard anything like *this* before!" reaction as I did when I first got 
into Rush.
