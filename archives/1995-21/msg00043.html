No, Kate isn't God, nor is she a Goddess, merely a very talented woman. I
think we all saw the slightly annoying side of fanaticism when the
KateManiac showed up a while ago, then posted his poetry. I expect this
level of enthusiasm from fourteen year old girls in regard to Joey
Lawrence or someone, not Kate. And, I think we're all mature adults. Now
please allow me to rail against your musical tastes for a bit.
 
&gt; 
&gt;           Tori Amos (sorry for mentioning it, I know it's a touchy subject)

Tori's fine.

&gt;           Kate Bush

Duh.

&gt;           The Bushwackers

Unfamiliar.

&gt;           Crash Test Dummies

Ughh...that damn mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm song. They opened for Elvis and the
Attractions last year and were soundly ignored by everyone, and rightly
so.

&gt;           Corduroy

Okay...
&gt;           Depeche Mode

Haven't listened to them seriously in about six years. I always liked
"Black Celebration," though.

&gt;           Exploding Daisies

Don't know.

&gt;           Green Day

I liked Green Day because they were local, though I never liked them that
much. I now hate them, not because of their success, but because the last
time we saw Billie Joe in a bar, he decided to pee on my bestfriend's foot
(and no, she wasn't being obnoxious, she's quite beautiful and nice. Not
the sort of thing you do to a beautiful woman, you know?).

&gt;           INXS (early stuff)

Hate 'em.

&gt;           Chris Isaak

His new album is his best yet. I might be going to see him this evening,
but I fear it's sold out.

&gt;           Billy Idol (especially Cyberpunk)

I liked "REbel Yell."

&gt;           Tom Jones (and in case you are wondering, yes, the early stuff)

Yech.

&gt;           Living Colour

It's too bad they broke up.

&gt;           Manowar

Who?

&gt;           Midnight Oil

I liked everything after "Beds Are Burning." Have you heard their earlier
stuff? THis is a band that's improved a hundred percent.

&gt;           Pet Shop Boys

I hate them. They actually have one song I like, but I don't know what it
is and I haven't heard it in years. Not a big deal.

&gt;           Red Hot Chili Peppers

What I got you gotta get it put it in you?
Give it away now?
Not the most subtle seduction song.
I'm not wild about them.

&gt;           REM (early stuff)

I actually cant' listen to their early stuff anymore, because I listened
to it so much in high school that it kind of bores me (So. Central Rain
excepted). Their last two albums are fantastic, particularly "Automatic,"
which, coincidentally, I just listened to yesterday.

&gt;           Matthew Sweet

People keep telling me to listen to him. I never get around to it.

&gt;           Skunkhour

Who?

&gt;           They Might Be Giants

What's that blue thing doing here?

&gt;           Yello

That one song will forever be a Skittles commercial to me (Oh Yeah).

My own quick list of what I'm listening to that I recommend to everyone,
regardless of their tastes:

American Music Club (sadly now defunct, though lead Mark Eitzel is working
on a solo album with some other members of the band).
Bowie (listening to Low right now)
Charles Mingus
The Chieftans
Ron Sexsmith
Elvis Costello
The Pogues
Nick Cave
LIsa Germano
King Crimson
Throwing Muses
Beastie Boys.
