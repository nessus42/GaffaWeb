Hello Love Hounds,

Thanks Uli, thanks Weiland, for the advance notice of KaTe's
3 Sat appearances.

 -+) aired in its entirety with (thank you 3 Sat) no commercial
interruption.  The picture quality, being PAL, of course was
excellent.  One thing I noticed this time while watching it:
After KaTe loses the papers to Miranda, each comes back
to her in a form of foreshadowing prior to the actual occurrence.
The line (path) comes to her at the end of 'Lily', when she's laying
down and Lily says, "...the spell is broken".  The cross (heart) burns
into the sheet of music after she calls upon those she loves (MoP).
The curve (smile) is virtually omnipresent during 'Eat the Music', as
each of the dancers has a paper smile up to their mouths while dancing.

Having not seen -+) for some time, it was terrific to once again
experience the mastery of this film, especially 'ASiL'.

3 Sat later aired Bio's Bahnhof, from 1978.  It featured KaTe singing
'Kite' and 'Wuthering Heights', a literally live performance of her
'Wuthering Heights' 7 inch single, with b-side.   These were true
performances, not lip-syncs.  KaTe looked beautiful, wearing a
red, flowing dress to about mid-calf.  She had high heels (not super
high heels) on, and was wearing what looked like a red orchid around
her throat.  Her fingernails were red, and she was wearing a very thin
bracelet and micro-earrings, barely noticeable.

There was no interview shown prior to 'Kite', or between the performances.
KaTe began 'Kite' with her back turned to the audience (looked to be about
400 or so to my eye).  The band, about 20 feet behind her, were wearing
predominantly white - bell bottoms, no less.  This, I thought, was not her
finest performance, I'm sorry to say.  'Kite', while not anywhere near being
a favorite KaTe song of mine, is extremely difficult to get to sound right
in a live performance, IMHO, and she shouldn't have tried.

After 'Kite' was over, a backdrop featuring a wilderness scene - trees and
a spewing volcano - was lowered in front of the band.  KaTe went immediately
to the front of the stage and sat down for WH.  This performance was
terrific, I thought.  KaTe basically did the same dance as was in her 
original
video of the song, but she had to hold the microphone, and that was a little
clumsy for KaTe.

KaTe got a good round of applause after each song, but the audience was
very still during the performances.  After WH, Bio hugged KaTe and told
her, "Kate, that was great!"    He told her to "Remember, when you make it
big - and I know that you will - to say you got your start here..."    Bio 
tried to
get KaTe to repeat something in German, she tried, but didn't quite get it
right.  Bio plucked a rose from a woman in the audience and presented it
to KaTe.

Van
