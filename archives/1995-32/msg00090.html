<PRE>
&gt;I think this is a fascinating topic.  The amazing persona seen
&gt;in some of the videos is so different to the Kate we see in
&gt;interviews.  Is *Kate* Bush a real person - or is she a creation
&gt;of *Catherine* ?  

&gt;Does anyone actually know what her friends and family call her??
&gt;Has she actually changed her name offically?

   She has used three names: Cathy, Catherine and Kate. Her brother
John's book "Cathy" was the planned first of three books to match
the changes in her chosen name. Presumably, the "Cathy" photos cover
the period when she was using that name. She later decided to use
the complete version "Catherine." I'm not sure when the transition
to "Kate" happened. As far as we know, none of the changes have been
"official," just a person chosing to use a shorter form of their
name.

    We have heard her brothers John and Paddy refer to her as "Kate."
I can't recall her mother or father using her name in the only interview
either of them participated in. Del is on record calling her "puddin'."

    She and Paddy were apparently quite fond of making up silly names
for play when they were kids. Some of these have popped up. Once, when
she was asked "what is your favorite cover of one of your songs" in
the (no longer published) Kate Bush Club Newsletter, she replied:

    "Poor Old Flea by Madame Maria Nanky"

    I assume that this was one of Kate's play names.

    The editor of the KBC Newsletter was a a person named "Nicholas Wade."
Mr. Wade's existence has never been comfirmed. Presumably, if he exists
we might have heard *something* from or about him in all these years.

    The newsletter also featured stories by one "Enrico Baratta" (sp?).
We have no idea who Enrico was either, but his profile can be spotted
in the "Experiment IV" video.

    The people who can explain all this ain't talking.
