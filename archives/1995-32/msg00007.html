&gt;&gt; You need to go even younger than that. The baby isn't newborn, it is
&gt;&gt; *unborn* and rebelling at the idea of going out into the
&gt;&gt; nuclear-war-ravaged world. I believe the nicotine reference is just that.
&gt;&gt; The baby's mother (not Kate's mother) is alive and she smokes. ...
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I've seen the video, but the two stories are not necessarily
&gt;equivalent (and sometimes better if not, IMHO).  I *used* to
&gt;picture the narrator as an adult woman in a fall-out shelter.

   We all develop our own stories in the absence of a video...sometimes
they are even better. But the video was storyboarded by Kate, and reflects
her intentions.

&gt;It sounds to me like the narrator is saying she is breathing.
&gt;Wouldn't you agree?  If so, what does her character mean by that?
&gt;Unborn children do not breathe.  Couldn't they be "the first and last"
&gt;post-nuclear babies?
&gt;And what does she mean by "breathing my mother in"?

   But if you view "breathing" as "taking oxygon in" the fetus *does*
"breath" in sustanance from the mother. 

&gt;I must admit, it is hard for me to get a good handle on the "story"
&gt;in this song.  IED, what do *you* think?
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure we all agree on "the grand theme", the devil is in the...
&gt;
&gt;PS:
&gt;&gt; Gee, in proper html, it would actually be...
&gt;The worst thing about standards is that some people think you should
&gt;actually follow them.

   Well, *ACTUALLY* &lt;OPINION&gt;&lt;/OPINION&gt; would be proper SGML (assuming it was 
defined) but not a legitimate HTML tag (not even NHTML or M$HTML.) Yet.
