| ... while Kate is not a person at all, but a more
| advanced life form pretending to be human to spare your feelings.
| We haven't figured out so far, what HER real nature is, but it's definetely
| not purely human. I don't know the whole story...

GAD!  That's not supposed to be general knowledge.
The Rigellians hunt down anyone with that knowledge
unless the Princess (uhh,  the Queen now), forbids it.
I got the story from one Sylvester Krupnick, late of
Boise, now on the run from the Feds and the Kregar,
agents of the Sklegnar Overlord.  After the incident
at Oxfordshire, Krupnick spent some time in DC
hanging out around the Wall and living in the bushes
of the park.  I met him late one night and he told
me the whole story about the thwarted invasion by
the jello beings.  Seems Krupnick started the dammed
thing when he insulted a money droid in Boise.  The
Sklegnar thought it was an important communications
device, holy to the humans, because they all got
the little green papers with the images of their gods
on it there.  When Krupnick told it to "Piss off",
the Sklegnar shipWeb interpreted that as 
"Become warm runny water" which, as you know,
to a jello being is a pretty rude insult.  That started
the invasion that the Talosian Princess and her
exiled followers stopped at Oxfordshire... for now.

SHHH!  The bowls have ears.  And please don't
tell them her true name or true form if you know it.
Only The Teacher may reveal the history of the
royal family, and then only if the Princess has 
taught it this.  The return to the homeworld depends
on the stealth of the family and the Kregar have
instructions to capture her at any cost.  The stiletto
heels only work in elevators at close range.  Spare
feelings?  If her guardian, the Koton, finds out
about this (and there is dammed little she doesn't
see on the Internet), you will vanish!  SHHH!
