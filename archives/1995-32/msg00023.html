&gt;Basically what I meant by Tori being an introvert is that .....
[SNIP] 
&gt;Kate basically writes about ANYTHING &amp; EVERYTHING!!!!   

I agree with the general idea. I see Kate Bush and Tori Amos 
as very good complements to eachother. When I'm in the 
what-a-great-world-full-of-wonder-we-live-in mood, I listen 
to Kate Bush. When my personal demons pop up from my sub-
conciousness, I play Tori Amos.

&gt;write about her feelings very often,  Maybe she does in a round-a-
&gt;bout way, I don't know, and neither do any of you...really.  Who the 
&gt;fuck out there is going to say, I know what she means about this 
&gt;song. Yeah right, who are you, Kate?  

whoa, Now you're out of line, mister!
The majority of Love-Hounds and Gaffans have not had the chance to
say even 'hi' to Kate  (neither have I :-(   

BUT there are people here who have talked to Kate to some extent.
How can you know that she has not shared some of her secrets?


&gt;                              ....I don't even think Kate even 
&gt;knows completely about her feelings in songs.  That is not what's 
&gt;important.  What's important is what you get out of it. 

True enough.

&gt;Kate is just there, like some book on my shelf, and 
&gt;like to look at to go into another world, were all is beautiful, like 
&gt;a Tennyson poem.  It's sublime, pure.  

I've never read a Tennyson poem (maybe I should), but I agree that
Kate has this ability to make one loose onself in that other 
world/story that she's telling about.
That's one of the reasons I absolutely don't like Moments of Pleasure:
too much sentimental, and self-indulgence in sorrow(?) and emptiness.
ASIL is sad, but at least not that sentimental, and it got BLUES! 

&gt;                             ...Kate is Mary Magdalene and 
&gt;Tori is the whore of Babylon.  And neither of them should be 
&gt;chastized (by the way, I am not saying that Tori is the whore of 
&gt;Baylon, or a whore, I am ONLY making a comparison.  Do not take this 
&gt;comment out of context, I've just been reading too much Camille 
&gt;Paglia) for this or thier actions.  This is MY opinion. 

A very interesting opinion. It makes one think. 
Hmm... Yes, Tori express things that Kate is "too proper" to address.
"too proper" is the closest thing I can come up with at the moment.
(problems with Native Language versus English...)

&gt; My opinion is as valid or invalid as the nxt guy or girl. Period.

Had you written just 'valid' and not added 'invalid',
IED might had argued. ;-)

Music is like vintage wine. It keeps getting better over the years,
