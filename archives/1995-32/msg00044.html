Hi everyboy, 
Fisrt, to Mikael Jakonen (please tell me that I spelled that right...)
Thanks for your comments.  I actually enjoyed everything you had to 
say.  The second that I started to write about Kate's lyrical content 
and its interpreations, I knew I was on shaky ground.  I JUST SAID 
"Fuck it!" and wrote it (again, too much Camille Paglia).  Anyways, I 
think what you had to say was valid, that maybe Kate has shared her 
secrets, but I also said that maybe not even know what her lyrics are 
about.  Somethimes when you write something, it just feels right to 
put it down on paper, you just want to let that feeling out, and fuck 
knows where it came from.....But maybe Kate is very careful about 
what she writes, and really is sure of her lyrics.  I don't know, but 
you must admit that it brings about a interesting discussion (there 
is only one thing I hate about the 'net and its that when you write, 
sometimes a sarcastic, or not even serious remark is misunderstood.  
I hope I really didn't offend anyone with my retorts.  I do find 
discussions of this sort quite intersting though.....  I extend an 
invitation to all to write me at my address (please do not 
necessarily write to the amiling list, beacause I find that when a 
personal discussion goes on a list, it blows out of proportion, and 
all who don't know or don't really care to know what we're talking 
about get ANNOYED!!!!!.  I do not want to become the black sheep of 
this list.......

Somebody mentioned a Ninth wave movie script or something to that 
effect.... I must know more!!!!  The title actually originates from 
the Tennyson poem (which you all know) The Coming Of Arthur by 
Tennyson.  Now, I have an interview with Kate Bush done in 1985 in 
which she discusses why the seperation of the two sides.  The main 
reason that they were seperated is because that the two sides are 
like two different entities.  The passage from the poem was just 
really cool, so that's basically why she called it that.  No big 
deal.  But then again, maybe there is something more to it.  I doubt 
it.  I'll write down that segment of the interview and post it up.

Aspects of the Sensual World-  What is it!?!  I need more info....

Marcel Rijs also mentioned Tori Amos covered, what is that....

New topic for discussion: Kate on vinyl.......
I am an avid collector of vinyl especially Kate stuff.  I have all 
her studio albums on vinyl, all domestic to Canada, and a UK printing 
of "The Kick Inside" (the one with the Kate on a kite).  I also have 
the 12'' single of "Moments of Pleasure" in the poster bag.  I also 
have the 7'' single of "Love and anger" which is presented in a 
booklet with photos I presume to be of the vid....  I also have a 7'' 
picture disc of "This Woman's Work"  photo by John Carder Bush, with 
"Be Kind To My Mistakes" ("Love" has "Ken").  I am wondering the 
value of such jewels, can anyone give me an idea?  I will NEVER sell 
ANY of my Kate stuff on vinyl! EVER!  If anyone knows how to get it 
though, I would be extremely appreciative.

One last thing:  I absolutely love "Lagen's Love"... I once heard a 
cover version of it, but I can't find out who sang it though.  It was 
very distictively Irish, very Enya-like qualities (it was not sung by 
Enya or Clannad, I am positive!). 

Comments, questions, love letters or advice.... ( I have to stop 
reading Rolling Stone)
Simon
