&gt;&gt;Heart has been succesful in America, but surely anyone who has 
&gt;&gt;seen their videos know that Ann (lead vocalist) is kept carefully
&gt;&gt;hidden from the camera due to her weight, and Nancy (the pretty
&gt;&gt;blonde) is prominently featured.  Clearly, the strength of
&gt;&gt;Heart (one of their few?) is Ann's voice.  Interestingly enough,
&gt;&gt;.......
&gt;
&gt;I admit I haven't followed Heart in the past few years, but I did attend
&gt;3 of their concerts -spaced apart a few years- going back several years.
&gt;Each time I saw them live both sisters were what I'd call "wicked!"
&gt;(read immensely beautiful) with both being extremely athletic on stage
&gt;(kicking leg above head). They were some of the most energetic concerts
&gt;I've been to. If Ann has put on the pounds, it must be due to lack of touring
&gt;because she wouldn't last 5 minutes if she was overweight at the shows I saw.
&gt;
&gt;-To paraphraze Zephod Beeblebrox, they were "amazingly amazing!" :-)
&gt;

Yeah, once upon a time, Heart was great. What I thought was their greatest
strength, though, was Roger Fisher's guitar playing. Anybody who knows any
Heart can close their eyes and here it, that awesome, inhumanly wonderful
playing on "Barracuda", "Crazy On You" "Magic Man" and others. Ann's
singing is great, but they were nothing without Fisher, who, by the way,
they dumped quite a few years back. The band's decline was directly
proportional to the decline of Fisher's influence in the band and the rise
of Howard "no-talent" Leese, the only remaining male member of the bad from
its original line-up.

I'm sure Ann and Nancy (and Howard) would disagree vehemently with that
sentiment.

I've always wondered what ever happened to Roger Fisher. He never did
anything notable afterward, as far as I know. He's probably selling used
cars in Tacoma or something.
