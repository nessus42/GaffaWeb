Hello, Earth!

I was lucky enough to sneak onto IRC the other night when I downloaded this
interesting conversation:

KATE:  Hello, this is Kate Bush, famous singer, songwriter, producer,
       musical arranger, and director!  It's great to talk with all of you
       know who I am; who are you?
JORN:  My name is Jorn;  I am the only rational mind on rec.music.gaffa,
       the newsgroup dedicated to you.
KATE:  I've heard about that!  I think it's so sweet!  A very nice man named
       Uli sent me a "Frequently Asked Questions" file.  I thought that was
       so nice of him!
JORN:  But he didn't write it!  I did!
KATE:  You did?  You wrote that whole thing?
JORN:  Well, not ALL of it.  But since I claim it as my own, I don't think
       he should give it to anyone without MY prior approval!
KATE:  I can see how you think that, seeing as how most of it is yours.
       I mean, you DID write most of it, didn't you?
JORN:  Uh, well, not really... But if THEY didn't get to it before I did,
       I would have!  They're all against me!
KATE:  Who are "They"?  And why are they against you?
JORN:  All of them!  That evil Jon Drukman, and Stev0, and Vickie, and worst
       of all, that evil, evil Chris!
KATE:  What makes you say he's so evil?
JORN:  Because he won't let ME have MY way 100% of the time!  That MUST
       mean he's plotting against me!  They all are!
KATE:  So this FAQ
JORN:  You mean *MY* FAQ!
KATE:  So I take it you run this newsgroup?
JORN:  NO!!!  But I *SHOULD*!!!  Because the moderator is plotting against
       me, too!  He won't kick off all my enemies because HE'S my enemy, too!
KATE:  So let me get this straight.  You're getting all upset because 
       someone is using a FAQ that YOU didn't even write which contains
       what is (or should be) public knowledge in a newsgroup which YOU
       are a mere member like everyone else?
JORN:  You BASTARD!  You're against me, too!  YOU ARE NOW MY SWORN ENEMY
       FOR LIFE!!!!
KATE:  Sheesh, are ALL Kate Bush fans like that?  I think I'll see what
       that Happy Rhodes group is up too...

KATE has Logged Off

- Stev0 the spy

"All I wanted was a Pepsi!" - Jorn
