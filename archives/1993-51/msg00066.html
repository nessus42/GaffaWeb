&gt;CHRISW: Well every time he said anything I told everyone what a sick,
&gt;twisted paranoid he was... like the way he treated Paul...

Aw, Jorn, I feel *so* left out.  Not even one mention of how I masterminded
a two-prong attack of you by not only insulting you under my own name but
also sending anonymous slurs through Chris!  But you were *so* clever and
you saw through my deception.  It was sheer genius of you to notice that
neither the postings by alter-ego nor the ones under my own name contained
grammatical errors such as to/too/two or your/you're mistakes, and how we
"both" used two spaces after periods and colons, and how we both used the
oh-so-rare technique of using both asterisks and underscores to emphasize
words to different degrees. 

I was *so* embarassed to be caught!

Well, okay, no I wasn't.  I was too busy laughing at your "twisted
paranoia."  In fact, I think I actually saved some of your "proofs" so I
could pull them out and laugh at them...and you...whenever I needed a
pick-me-up.

Face it:  you went off the deep end.  Doing so clouded any judgement you
might have still had.

Of course, then you left.  

Unfortunately, now you're back.  You seem to have not changed.  So it goes.

ObKaTe:  yesterday, after my sister gave my father a copy of TRS for
Hanukah (he also has TKI, LH, NFE, HoL, and TSW), my sister-in-law
commented that she'd never really cared for KaTe, but that she'd been
hearing "Eat the Music" (she actually referred to it as "The one that says
something about papaya") on the radio and *really* liked it.  This, to me,
is a Good Thing.

through this but didn't really want to...)
