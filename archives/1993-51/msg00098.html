&gt;&gt;&gt;mind you, it took me a while to figure out
&gt;&gt;&gt;that Jorn was lying and you (Chris) didn't really
&gt;&gt;&gt;talk to Kate on Prodigy...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Glad you noticed. I hope everyone else did. 

&gt;Ron, I apologise for not flagging my parody more conspicuously.  Remember
&gt;that I'm writing for a broad range of readers, some of whom wll be much 
&gt;more alert than others.

Um, is that supposed to cut me to the quick?

I've told you this in private, Jorn, and I'll say it one more time
here: I really don't care one way or the other about your little tapetree
problems, or whether or not ecto is out to make your life miserable.

What you call literary parody, I call putting words into the mouths of
Kate Bush and Chris Williams.  Furthermore, given that Peter Gabriel was
*actually* on Prodigy recently, and that his appearance was widely discussed
in this newsgroup, any suggestion that Kate Bush was on Prodigy is going to
create a situation that people will believe.

You lied when you said that Kate Bush was on Prodigy.  You lied when you
said that Chris Williams spoke to her on Prodigy.  And although you did
not exactly lie when you had Kate Bush attempt to take your side, you
presumed a hell of a lot, up to and including that she might actually
care about *any* of this drivel.

As to the veracity of the words that you lyingly put into the mouths
of these two people, as I said before, I don't care.  I didn't even
mention it.  You're the only one I see here whose getting the least bit
bent out of shape over that aspect of it, which makes the issue, and you,
seem pretty irrelevant to what's going on in the newsgroup.

Ron Hogan
oh, and Jorn?
parodies usually have this
habit of being *funny*...
