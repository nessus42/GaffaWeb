Sarah McLachlan - Bio
July 14/93

Only 25 years old, Sarah Mclachlan has already reached a level of artistic
maturity that most singer/songwriters never attain.  Since releasing her
haunting debut, Touch, in 1988, the Halifax, Nova Scotia native has
fervently explored her own unique musical territory , indifferent to
prevailing trends or fads; her alternately soaring, intimate vocals and
her moody, evocative songs convey a sense of passion and honesty that is
rare in today's climate.

With the release of her third full length effort, Fumbling Towards
Ecstasy, Sarah unveils her most personal direct album to date.  The
culmination of six months in a Montreal studio with long-time producer
Pierre Marchand, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy reflects the many changes she
underwent during the two year period since her last album, Solace, was
released.   Sarah describes writing the album as "a kind of therapy",
during which she overcame many long-standing fears and concerns by
learning to articulate them in her work.  The album's title is a metaphor
for the difficult process of stripping away the parts that keep one from
achieving happiness and fulfillment.

The songs on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy examine issues of self deception and
self actualization from many perspectives.  "Possession", the albums dark
and driving lead off tracks was written from the point of view of an
obsessive fan.  It is an examination of a fans overwhelming need to
control someone he knows only through music.  Blind promises of love are
intertwined with images of desperation and violence, creating a tense and
threatening mood that is underscored by the track's propulsive rhythm and
raw guitar interjection.

"Hold On" was inspired by the documentary, "A Promise Kept", about a woman
whose fiancee discovers he has AIDS. Overwhelmed by the woman's incredible
strength and selflessness, Sarah wrote "Hold On" in a single day.  It is
an unsentimental portrait that succinctly captures the woman's courage in
the face of adversity.  "Hold On" is also slated to appear on the No
Alternative compilation album (a follow up to the very successful Red, Hot
&amp; Blue and Red Hot &amp; Dance compilations), to be released through Arista in
October of 1993.  And as with the two previous compilations the proceeds
from this project will benefit AIDS research.

Some of the songs on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy are, in contrast lighter and
more whimsical than anything Sarah has previously penned.  "Ice Cream"
which contains the phrase "Your love is better than ice cream", is a
result of Sarah's new found ability to find inspiration in happiness as
well as sadness.  "Before, I didn't want to write when I was happy," she
explains.  "It was almost as if I needed to be depressed in order to be
creative".  But part of her artistic and personal maturation has been
learning to enjoy the good things in her life.  Even so, she is still
cautious, tempering the song's celebratory spirit with the fear of
rejection or loss; "It's a long way down" she warns in the chorus.

After studying guitar and piano as a child, Sarah was discovered by
Nettwerk Records at the age of 17 while performing at her first gig with a
new wave band in Halifax.  Her Parents frowned upon the idea of her
signing a record contract, since at that point she hadn't even finished
high school.  But two years later Nettwerk presented the opportunity
again, and this time Sarah accepted the offer and re-located to Vancouver.
B.C..  The resulting album, "Touch" contained the first collection of
songs Sarah had ever written. To her surprise the album reached gold
status in Canada and suddenly Sarah was being hailed as the year's most
exciting and important new artist.

After assembling a band and touring extensively, she returned to the
studio to record her follow up. "Solace", which was released in 1991. 
"Solace" was a critical and commercial success, and catapulted Sarah to
international prominence:  Rolling Stone cited her "astonishing strength
and clarity" as a performer, while the New York Daily News exclaimed
"Sarah McLachlan will be around for a while......trust your ears."  She
supported "Solace" with an exhaustive tour, finally returning home over a
year later to begin writing the songs that would eventually comprise
"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy."

Coming off the whirlwind existence she has led during the past few years,
Sarah is learning to savor every moment of privacy and calm that she gets.
 While recording "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy", she rented a secluded house
in the woods outside of Montreal.  The solitude and lack of distractions
were unsettling at first, but the natural beauty of her surroundings
eventually became soothing and inspiring. "I love to listen to the river,"
she says, "it's the best music I've heard in years."
