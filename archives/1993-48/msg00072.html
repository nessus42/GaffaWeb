Chris here,
In article &lt;<A HREF="msg00066.html">1993Nov26.201222.19363@leland.Stanford.EDU</A>&gt; Jim C. rites:
&gt;In article &lt;<A HREF="msg00035.html">m0p2YCp-000il5C@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu</A>&gt; chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (chris williams) writes:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Actually, some of us, whenever the words "Alistair Crowley" or
&gt;&gt;or "pentagram ritual" are mentioned, think; "What are these people 
&gt;&gt;babbling on about." Let's just say that Kate believes in some silly
&gt;&gt;things. Please take it to e-mail, until you can find some specific
&gt;&gt;Kate content, beyond the fact that it was mentioned in the song.
&gt;
&gt;	Like what?  Information that Kate has ever performed such a 
&gt;ritual?  Lighten up--  "Lily" is a song by Kate that contains references
&gt;to things that are not immediately apparent.  Attempts to illuminate 
&gt;those references are perfectly appropriate here.  Please don't try and
&gt;play netcop.

   I'm not playing net.cop, I'm just pointing out that the Crowley
nonsense has consumed quite a bit of space and produced no light.
There are many better newsgroups to ask these sort of questions on, 
and most of the are not echoed via e-mail to people accessing this via
expensive services like compu$erve. The ritual is probably a
"frequently asked question" on alt.magick. Use the net properly.
Even Jorn Barger figured *that* one out. See his post on this
topic on alt.magick, where I went looking for a FAQ to send.

&gt;&gt;   I'd like to see some specific analysis of the structure of the song,
&gt;&gt;the relationship of the the parts of the ritual to the angels mentioned
&gt;&gt;or anything at all, more than simply discussing the *fact* that the
&gt;&gt;ritual is in the song.
&gt;
&gt;	Then post something to that effect.  Nobody is preventing you from
&gt;posting any sort of analysis of "Lily" that you'd care to.  In turn, please
&gt;don't try to prevent other folks from talking about what in the song interests
&gt;*them*.

   Nobody can prevent anybody from posting anything on any subject on
rec.music.gaffa. The simple fact is, none of the posters so far have
produced much relating specifically to the *song*.

   When they do, I will be among the first to applaude their efforts.

   Kate apparently believes in astrology, but an extensive discussion
of the topic, not specifically related to Kate, would be better in
another newsgroup.
