&gt;I was at her concert in Kitchener last night; pretty much the same as you
&gt;described.  I would have like to have heard more acoustic stuff, e.g.
&gt;Possession with just piano as appears at the end of the _FTE_ CD and more
&gt;with just acoustic guitar (Path of Thorns perhaps).  Less band and more of
&gt;her great voice.  Last year, I heard a short performance with just her and
&gt;acoustic guitar.  The music seemed much more intimate and emotional.
&gt;
&gt;All that being said, it was still a great concert.

Disclaimer:  I hadn't seen Sarah in concert before the one in Kitchener.

I enjoyed the concert a great deal too.  The lack of more acoustic
arrangements didn't bother me at all.  In fact, Sarah herself said
that she wanted to try more electric guitar playing (for herself,
and presumably she meant in a concert setting).

Her two guitarists are both very talented.  They had several opportunities
to showcase their abilities, which I thought was good.  In fact, there
were a handful of opportunities for the band to let loose a bit and
"jam."  I liked those moments a lot.  Percussion was good.  Bass, backing
vocals and keyboards were fine.  The keyboard guy had a face that reminded
me of Andre the Giant though :-)  A good band.

BTW, for those people still to catch Sarah on tour.  The patience
of a small group of us was rewarded when she came out to sign autographs
after the concert.  She was nice and unassuming.  Anybody know if
Possession is based on a particular incident or not?
