As has been said here, we had a wonderful Katemas in San Jose (Thanks,
Larry!  You did a bang-up excellent four-star job!)  The highlight (besides
IED's wonderful Kate Jeopardy game) was, of course, getting to hear those
four cuts from the upcoming album.  My first (and second and third) impressions:

Moments of Pleasure:  WOW!  Unbelievable!  Cross "Blow Away" with "The Fog",
then give it the power of "This Woman's Work" and "Under the Ivy".  This
has the potential to become my favorite Kate song!

Eat the Music:  A silly (and I don't mean that as a compliment OR an insult)
little number, it sounds kind of like a Paul Simon song.  The sad part is that
Paul Simon could actually have done it better.  However, for the record, this
was the song that was sticking in my head all day Sunday.

Rubberband Girl:  MMmmm, Yes!  Kate's most dancable song to date!  If you
don't like ANYTHING That Funny Symbol Guy has done, you'll hate this song.
But if, like me, you like to turn the volumn to "11" on "Ken" and bounce
off the walls, you'll love this song.

That other song who's name I forget:  A throwaway.  Not a bad song, but not
one of her better efforts.  Kind of ranks with "Walk Straight Down the
Middle".  Clapton seems to have wandered in from another song.  (Once I
read the full lyrics, I might like it better, but I doubt it).

- Stev0 the Rex Reed of Gaffa

P.S. A reminder for all Bay Area Lovehounds who WEREN'T at the Katemas
Party:  The Stanford Theatre is showing "Wuthering Heights" (the Olivier
version) next weekend.  IT IS YOUR DUTY AS A KATEFAN (tm) TO SHOW UP.
