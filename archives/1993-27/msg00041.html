First, as it just has to be,

HAPPY KATEMAS!!!

Second, yesterday I more or less doubled my video collection. :-)^10. And got
some things in really astonishing good quality. Better than I ever hoped I'd
get. Thanks M.! (Don't know if you would like to see your name here, so just M.)
Ok, M. got some videos from me too, but I still feel like exploiting M.

Third, today is Katemas, and there are radio and TV stations who are aware of
this fact. SWF-3 (Suedwestfunk 3, a South-West German radio station) brought
a small special on Kate. It was just an accident that I got it. I came from
the post office and went into my car, turned the radio on, and was treated
to Wuthering Heights. "Wow!" I thought, a Kate track on SWF-3 after a long
pause in which at least I have not heard her on the radio (I don't listen
too much to radio). After Wuthering Heights I was even more washed away. They
brought an intro to Kate (the usual stuff: Dave Gilmour 'found' her, a big
record company signed her up and let her practise some years before WH got
her out and big. And of course they congratulated her to her 35th birthday.
"Fine, they think of her," I thought. I was even more happy that they brought
a short interview after that intro. Nothing new, though I didn't recognize
it. I'm not that fit in recognizing interviews. And they had German voice-over,
Kate just barely listenable. Anyhow. The interview was a Sensual World era one,
she talked about being surrounded by machines more and more, later about how
sensual our world is and how feminin her latest album is compared to the previous
one that had all the male energy. This interview was split into three parts, with
Babooshka and Hounds of Love inbetween and Running Up That Hill afterwards.

Unfortunately I was in my car and not at home, so I could not tape it :-(, but
it was great to finally be able to listen to FOUR SONGS and an INTERVIEW
in a row on a German radio station. For the purists:

SWF-3, June 30, 1993, 11:05 am to 11:25 am CET, Germany:

- Wuthering Heights
- Intro &amp; Congrats by DJ
- Interview part 1
- interruption by traffic news - some stupid driver was going the wrong lane
  on one of our motorways. I almost thought "shit! this interview is not ready
  yet! They won't cut it off. Grrr...". But: big relief:
- Babooshka
- Interview part 2
- Hounds of Love
- Interview part 3
- Running Up That Hill

No news at all about The Red Shoes and the like :-(

Fourth, MTV Europe just has to use Her Birthday to play one of her videos
in MTV Greatest Hits. It was 'Wow' and Paul King even congratulated her
(and mentionned Dave Gilmour too). 


Bye, before it isn't Katemas any longer,

Uli
