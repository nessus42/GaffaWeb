I'm a long time W.R. fan.  I was discouraged by some of Zawinul's
less than melodic noodling around on the last couple albums (although
I found "Db Waltz" and some other stuff on "Domino Theory" great and
most of "Sporting Life" great).  For that reason, I waited quite a while
before I got the LAST W.R. album "This is This."  Although Wayne Shorter
doesn't play on a lot of the album, I find it excellent.  It's about time
that Carlos Santana does more than just show us how long he can hold a note.

On the inside of the CD (probably record too) liner notes, there are
a couple names I never saw before on a W.R. album (I have all including
the Japanese import "Live in Tokyo" from which came the second side
of "I Sing the Body Electric").  The two names I've never seen on a
W.R. album were Greg Errico (I believe he played with Santana at some
point) and Darryl Brown.  Did I miss them on an album or did they just
tour at some point with W.R.  Steve Gadd, Tony Williams, and Ralph Towner
played on albums (but didn't tour) with W.R. and I suppose the reason
they're not on the liner notes is because they were never members of W.R.
By the way, Santana is the second guitarist (besides Ralph Towner) to have
ever played with W.R.  So, any info. on what Greg Errico and Darryl Brown
did with W.R.

On another note, I spoke with Zawinul when W.R. was touring before
"Procession" and Zawinul said that Victor Bailey was going to be one
of the best.  I finally have to say that, yes, it sounds like he
was right.

Thanks,
