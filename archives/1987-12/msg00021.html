So "Be Kind to my Mistakes" was played on Pittsburgh radio, eh, David?
Maybe it's coming out as a single in the U.S. If so, it might
be much in demand overseas...

"Castaway" still hadn't been announced for release in the
near future in the States in any publication/show that IED
saw, but if the single's coming out, the movie might be
coming soon, too. Anyway, that would explain the "new Kate Bush"
reported about in Love-Hounds the other day.
But if Kate shows up in Dallas, IED will stick to his end of the deal.

Paul, "Castaway" is about a middle-aged Englishman, bored with
his city lifestyle, who puts an ad in a paper about going off to
live on a desert isle for a year with some young woman. As it happens,
a very pretty young woman answers, and the two strangers do go off
and spend a long time together alone on the island. Oliver Reed
is the man, Amanda Donahue (Donahoe?) the woman. It's directed by
Nicholas Roeg, one of Kate's favourite directors (Don't Look Now,
The Man Who Fell to Earth, etc.). Reportedly, the last words said
by the woman in the movie are "Be kind to my mistakes."

Where to get KT's twelve-inches? The ones you're missing are
"The Big Sky" and "Hounds of Love", apparently. Of these, the
former came out domestically as a twelve-inch, so you should
be able to find it quite cheaply somewhere in the Bay area.
"Hounds of Love" was only a seven-inch in the U.S., as far as
IED ever knew, so if you want the twelve-inch (understandable,
since it features a completely different vocal for the a-side,
plus a dynamite b-side), maybe you'll have to contact a mail-order
place if your import stores don't have it. Try Intergalactic Garage,
if you don't mind paying top dollar.

&gt;  B) to confuse me even further as to the true meaning of this phrase!
&gt;Whoever it was that posted the interpretation "Knocking us, knocking us,
&gt;we don't need no symphony being there..." is probably as right as any of
&gt;us.

Well, everyone hears the "knocking us, knocking us" part, but
also everyone concedes that that makes nearly no sense, and that anyway
it doesn't sound EXACTLY like "knocking us, knocking us." As for
the "we don't need no symphony being there," IED can't hear any
of that. The vowel sounds sort of parallel those phonetics, but none
of the consonants corresponds exactly with those ones. Thanks
to Mark, IED now has his own copy of the tracks at slow, slower
and slowest speeds, and is presently suffering from an acute case
of brain fever. This will NOT, however, postpone the party Friday.

&gt;I can't make head nor tail of it, although the passage where she sings
&gt;"Really see" backwards is quite pretty.  "We see you here."  Yeah.

Just so long as we're all aware that there is no "Really see" there,
it's just a co-incidence that it sounds like "Really see"... or is it???
