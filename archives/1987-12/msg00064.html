&gt;From: Joe Turner
&gt;Personal to IED:  I send my most profuse apologies as to the lateness of
&gt;the tapes I promised you.  My lack of responsibility is inexcusable.  Jon
&gt;Drukman and I are sending you a joint package today with both of our stuff
&gt;in it.

&gt;-- joe

Apologies unnecessary, but accepted anyway. Jon's tape
is nearly finished and will go out sometime very soon.

&gt;From: cs140.t2@watmath.UUCP (Mark LaForge)
&gt;Subject: Hard-to-find Kate For Sale
&gt;I currently have a couple of hard-to-find Kate Bush items for sale
&gt;and i thought that I'd give you guys first chance at them.

It's not Mark LaForge's fault, of course, but those Record Collector
prices on KT collectibles are extremely erratic. Anyway, the
Canadian colour vinyl records are much more common in North America
than in the UK, for which the RC's price-list was made.
IED would love to be able to drop $100.00 for a few pieces
of coloured plastic, but the recent Bush bash at his place cleaned
him out!

K As for the question of what we could get Kate that she could possibly T
T need, there's nothing -- she's richer than any of us'll ever be put   K
K together. But it might be nice if we sent her a Love-Hounds birthday  T
T card. Only problem is, how could everyone sign it? Look what happened K
K with the damn KompilaTion tape, now in limbo land. Anyone wanting to  T
T add to IED's L-Hs birthday message or suggest alts., let him know.    K

&gt;Also, thanks Andy for hosting the party.To those who didn't make it, its
&gt;your loss as you missed some damn interesting obscure Kate material. And
&gt;being able to oogle IED's immense Kate collection made it even better. It
&gt;was well worth the 2-1/4 hour drive each way to be there.
&gt;
&gt;-- MarK T. Ganzer

No, IED did NOT pay MarK for the above remarks! Thanks, MarK,
for your invaluable conversational assistance, esp. at the beginning,
when we were closeted alone with a particularly laconic fan.
Your presence was re-assuring.

&gt;By the way, I like the new vocal to "Wuthering Heights" (from T.W.S.)
&gt;much better than the version from "The Kick Inside" -- you can feel the
&gt;CHILL in your spine as you listen to it. The old version just sounds
&gt;so COLD that it's got rigor mortis.
&gt;
&gt;-- Niels.

You must be joking. That first version is about as expressive and
melodramatic a piece of sound as has ever been committed to vinyl.

R. Harty: Kate, we've been to Bronte-land, Shakespearean England, etc.
   Tell me, where will the arrow of your powerful intellect strike next?

Kate Bush: I think the key to art is emotion. Art is pure emotion.
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There has already been considerable discussion in L-Hs about the
relative merits/faults of the various versions of "Wuthering Heights".
A search through the L-Hs archives is respectfully suggested.

&gt;From: Dave Hsu &lt;hsu@eneevax.umd.edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;          Kate Bush is God.
&gt;
&gt;Kinda restores your faith in humanity, doesn't it?
&gt;
&gt;p.s. IED, how went the bash?
&gt;
&gt;-- dave

Yes, she is! Yes, it does! And it went pretty well, considering that
about half the people who had called to confirm never showed up. We
were only eleven at our strongest, but several people were amazingly
sharp on KTrivia. It was fun.

              Sanctus est nomina Deae! In nomine
              Filiae Catherina Christa, et Matriae, et
              Spiritae Sanctae Catherina Christa, amen.

-- Andrew Marvick (Acolyte's number K4735R, Church of Kate Bush)
