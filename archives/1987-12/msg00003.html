&gt;Really-From: ganzer%trout@nosc.mil (Mark T. Ganzer)
&gt;-------
&gt;From Dave Hsu:
&gt;&gt;...  The current method of choice is to sample the CD in stereo
&gt;&gt;at 50kHz, 12 bits with a Masscomp, and play it back at whatever speed I
&gt;&gt;feel like.  40k seems to be about the lowest usefully intelligible playback
&gt;&gt;speed.  Now, if only the speech recognition guys would finish up their
&gt;&gt;programs sooner...
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, the 20Khz sampling rate of the AKAI will only give you frequency
&gt;response to app 10Khz. Now if I had the time and equipment, this would
&gt;be how I would do it (this is reaching back to my college days of working
&gt;in a sinal processing lab as a programmer). First, I would sample it
&gt;ala Dave (although 100Khz would be preferable as you might want to drop
&gt;the range an octave or two).

Actually, I was planning on doing ~200kHz just for the hell of it, as
soon as I can find the time...plenty of disk space, and plenty of
bandwidth left.  One more final to go...

&gt; Then, do a FFT on it. Then, use some filtering
&gt;programs to remove all the garbage outside the vocal frequencies. This
&gt;would require some playing around, but picture this as playing around
&gt;with a 1024 band equalizer.

*sigh*, we're a bit low on firepower for that; the Masscomp in question
is but a 5500DP and not a 5700.  Besides, we haven't finished installing
EPI's lovely, graphics-intensive signal processing package yet.  Soon...

Hey, wait a minute...I'm leaving this lab in a week.  What am I talking
about?

&gt; Then do an inverse FFT and convert back to
&gt;analog. Just think of the equipment! Just think of the computing time!
&gt;(Apologies for technical errors, as it has been a few years since this
&gt;ME has played with such things). Or at least how about a direct digital
&gt;dump from the CD?...
&gt;
&gt;MarK T. Ganzer

Hmmm...the CDP502ES has a digital out jack (for which I have no pinout,
natch) but our Masscomp isn't equipped with their digital-in board.  I
need to replace my ailing D5 first before I try to tap the serial lines
to its converters.

&gt;
&gt;On the CD for The Dreaming (domestic), the picture of the ivy on the back
&gt;of the plastic case is completely different than the picture of ivy 
&gt;on the back of the lyric booklet.  This mildly puzzles me.

Incidentally, Paul, is tymix a Unix machine?  If so, you might consider
doing a `setenv NAME "Paul Holt"' to prevent confusion; I don't know if
this works with non-Berzerkeley mailers, though.

Don't be too puzzled...EMI needed a picture of some ivy, so they
selected a blank patch from the back cover of the LP and used that.
