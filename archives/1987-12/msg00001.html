&gt;&gt;Hey Moderatorio:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you wanna drop by the Media Lab and borrow an AKAI S900 digital
&gt;&gt;sampler, we can "unmask" the various reversed Kate-things in a matter
&gt;&gt;of seconds. Yeah, I guess it would be easy to make a tape, too. Plenty
&gt;&gt;of those around.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The sound quality will be a lot better than some reversal cassette
&gt;&gt;hack. Sampling time is 11 seconds at highest bandwidth (20KHz
&gt;&gt;sampled), and goes down in relation to length.
&gt;
&gt;...  The current method of choice is to sample the CD in stereo
&gt;at 50kHz, 12 bits with a Masscomp, and play it back at whatever speed I
&gt;feel like.  40k seems to be about the lowest usefully intelligible playback
&gt;speed.  Now, if only the speech recognition guys would finish up their
&gt;programs sooner...

Yeah, the 20Khz sampling rate of the AKAI will only give you frequency
response to app 10Khz. Now if I had the time and equipment, this would
be how I would do it (this is reaching back to my college days of working
in a sinal processing lab as a programmer). First, I would sample it
ala Dave (although 100Khz would be preferable as you might want to drop
the range an octave or two). Then, do a FFT on it. Then, use some filtering
programs to remove all the garbage outside the vocal frequencies. This
would require some playing around, but picture this as playing around
with a 1024 band equalizer. Then do an inverse FFT and convert back to
analog. Just think of the equipment! Just think of the computing time!
(Apologies for technical errors, as it has been a few years since this
ME has played with such things). Or at least how about a direct digital
dump from the CD?...

&gt;&gt;You may wonder why I offer if I couldn't care less about Kate Bush.
&gt;&gt;Maybe just as a hack, maybe just to get this discussion over with...

Hey, getting there is half the fun!...

BTW, I also had a feeling of deja vu upon first hearing the "Breathing"
narration. Now, I'm beginning to wonder whether it is even technically
correct...
