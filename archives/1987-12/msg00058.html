&gt;
&gt;Then we retired to the abode of Mr. D. Parmenter where we watched the
&gt;Hammersmith Odeon video.   "Yay!" thought I, "More Kateness!"  but what did
&gt;my eyes behold?  Something horrifying.... something cheesy.. something
&gt;STUPID!  My cry of anguish could be heard clear to Amherst.  I couldn't
&gt;believe that Our Kate Of Perrenial Warmth, my own Short Duration Personal
&gt;Saviour was going through the motions I was watching in shock on the televisio
&gt;set.  Surely the brain that gave us "The Dreaming" couldn't have possibly
&gt;come up with the idea of dressing two appallingly bad dancers up in
&gt;Violin costumes to dance around her and pretend to bonk her out at the end.
&gt;I don't know what's going on here, I suspect part of the pink conspiracy
&gt;at work, but that's another topic entirely.
&gt;
&gt;To sum it up:  it's Kate, ya gotta take the good with the bad, eh?

Come on, Jon, give her a break. That was 8 years ago. She was only 21.
Actually, it was this show that got me hooked on Kate. It was unlike
anything I had seen before and I could see that she was a f*ckin' brilliant
artist. Unfortunately, the more I watch this tape (and I have watched it
plenty) the more I see how Keith McMillan (Keef) butchered the video with
all his close-ups and double images. Also, remember that this is pre-Fairlight
Kate, and this is really the first opportunity for her to have complete
creative control over her work. So you have to look at it as a stepping stone
on the way to "The Dreaming". It was a damn ambitious undertaking for that
point in her career (preparations for the tour ran app. 200,000 pounds).
Sure the dancers in the string bass costumes
seems silly, but how else are you going to portray that song?

BTW, Andy, wasn't it Paddy who designed and made the string bass costumes?

Also, thanks Andy for hosting the party.To those who didn't make it, its
your loss as you missed some damn interesting obscure Kate material. And
being able to oogle IED's immense Kate collection made it even better. It 
was well worth the 2-1/4 hour drive each way to be there.
