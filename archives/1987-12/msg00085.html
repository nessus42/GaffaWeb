&gt;[Shit!  I missed the Legendary Pink Dots!!! Fuck!  -- |&gt;oug]

No you didn't.  They didn't play, nor will they ever play in the U.S.
If Edward's solo stuff is any indication, be glad.

&gt;Peter,
&gt; Howdy. I'm afraid after 3 or 4 listenings that I just could not
&gt;appreciate Sonic Youth.  My problem is that I have been in bands
&gt;since, say, 1966 (I'm 34), and the music that SY is playing, to
&gt;me, is not new.  It's new to this era, but it is old in terms of
&gt;whats been done before.

Wank wank wank ...

How to Spot a BOF, Lesson #3:
	When they start telling you how the music of today is `not anything
new'.  How `its all been done before'.

I had this problem with my own damn ^%$&amp;*^&amp; older brother.  Same story.
He quit college at 20 to play in bands full time in the Boston area.  Had
enough sortof-success to (a) lead a band with Billy Squier on gtr ; (b)
headline over Aerosmith in 1973 ; (c) headline over band with future Boston
bassist &amp; drummer in it ; (d) almost get a Big Record Contract in New York
(around the time of the 1st Aerosmith LP, and the Dolls era).  I made him
a potpourri tape for Xmas '79 (he was 31 then), with all the biggies of the
era.  Joy Division, Jam, Siouxsie, Buzzcocks, Clash, Public Image, Wire,
Magazine, Specials, XTC, you name it.  The beginning of the Golden Age of Pop.
Did he like it?  Naw ... `Heard it all before.  This stuff is nothing new.'
Give me a break ...

Kinda reminds me of this commercial on L.A. TV these days, for this weenie
cuntry station.  This Frankenwench gets on there and says `Rock these days.
It's ... it's ... just NOISE.  And that elevator music.  That won't do
either.  Then I heard something I really liked.  You know what's funny?
It turned out to be country.  [Looks down] Boy, have I changed ... '
Yeah, sure you've changed, DORK, you DIED musically is what happened.  Now
you're part of the 25-40 Demographic Group that fits neatly into a little
overpaid Program Consultants neat little preprogrammed universe.  Makes me
want to throw up.

BOF-ism: Just Say No.

	- Greg
