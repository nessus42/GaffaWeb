&gt;Subject: Re: "Free Speech"
&gt;From: Rich &lt;RMRichardson.PA@Xerox.COM&gt;

&gt;&gt;From: Neil Calton &lt;nbc@vd.rl.ac.uk&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does this mean that we should give free reign to the likes of nazis, the
&gt;&gt;KKK, paedophiles et cetera? Surely one has to draw the line somewhere -
&gt;&gt;though where that line is is, I admit, difficult to define.  ...
&gt;
&gt;Yes, for speech it means EXACTLY that; all those disgusting, despicable 
&gt;slime are allowed to speak.  The ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) 
&gt;as been to court again and again on this point.

Thinking about what you say (and what Dave said the other day) I will
concede that you are fundamentally right. 

&gt;I realize your 
&gt;culture is just enough different to not understand this,

No not that different really. Our National Council for Civil Liberties
takes exactly the same line as your ACLU. It is just that some of the
views that are expressed by extreme groups scare the shit out of me.

&gt;Unfortunately, too many U.S. citizens (including 
&gt;some elected office holders) don't really believe in freedom of speech when 
&gt;it comes to things which upset them.  

Agreed. Likewise in most if not all countries that claim to be democracies.
My real fear is that freedom of speech is only a reality for the
privileged or the powerful. As long as everyone gets a fair opportunity
to defend themselves then there is no need for censorship.

&gt;&gt; ... and then seeing the NF's
&gt;&gt;papers and pamphlets being sold in their local markets. ...
&gt;Yeah, this is where liberty gets hard to live with.  But then if you can't 
&gt;handle the hard parts, you can have it much easier in a regimented society 
&gt;where they take care to see that life is very orderly and peaceful (at least 
&gt;for some), e.g., Russia, Chile, South Africa, etc.  

Aargh! You were doing fine up till here! Chile ? Well things might be better
there if the CIA had not overthrown the Allende (sp?) government. South
Africa? Well life for the black population might not be so grim if 
governments like my own and yours took more positive steps to show people
like Botha that their policies are complete anathema to civilised societies.

(N.B. no personal flame or anti-Americanism intended - Mrs Thatcher welcoming
Botha to GB last year sickened me. Not for the fact that they were talking,
but for her refusal to openly condemn his regime.)

&gt;Make that libertarian vs. liberal; it's almost impossible.  It hasn't happened 
&gt;yet, on a really large scale for any length of time.  But we can only try our 
&gt;damned best and hope for some success.  

Amen to that.

Back to music:
Just found 'Filigree and Shadow' on CD for 8.49 (sterling). 74 minutes of
music - has to be the bargain of the month. Same shop also selling 'The
Whole Story' CD for 8.49. Ex-Smithers and Leigh in Oxford Street for British
readers - now apparently taken over by Virgin and having a spring sale.

P.S. to IED. Hope you have a great party.
