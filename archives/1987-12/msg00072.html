The background: This guy went out and bought Sonic Youth's "Bad Moon Rising"
based on my rec.music.misc recommendation.  I asked him what he thought of
it, and he replied:

//////////////////////////
Peter,
 Howdy. I'm afraid after 3 or 4 listenings that I just could not
appreciate Sonic Youth. My problem is that I have been in bands
since, say, 1966 (I'm 34), and the music that SY is playing, to
me, is not new. It's new to this era, but it is old in terms of
whats been done before. In the early seventies, we would get
ourselves "in the right mood" with what ever illegal substance
was available, and then do experimentation with feedback, detuned
guitars, etc... Lots of major groups did this also. Sonic Youth
is doing the same stuff, with better equipment. I do not condemn
Sonic Youth, and hold it dear to my music collection, but to me
it just is not new or innovative. But keep those reccomendations
coming, though. Clown Alley is a very interesting group. Again,
not for everyday listening. I buy at LEAST one album or CD a
week, and I love music I have no idea what it sounds like.

I thought these were interesting points.  Personally, I haven't heard
any early-70's hippie music that sounds anything like S.Y. (although I
guess the Dead's jams (the only decent music they make, in my opinion)
are somewhere in the neighborhood).  Comments anyone?
