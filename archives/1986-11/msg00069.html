O.K., go ahead and maunder on about subjects
unrelated to Kate if you want, Jimbo. IED was
in a bad mood when posting that intolerant
message. IED would like to ask one thing,
however: WHY? WHY would you want to discuss
OTHER music than Kate's? Or at least, why discuss
other music except insofar as it might be
related to Kate's in some way? This is truly
a puzzlement...

Speaking of Kate, IED just got out of the
Nuart after seeing Herzog's "Nosferatu" again.
This time he was armed with a walkman and recorded
the Czech (or Russian) men's choral passage from
the film which Kate used in The Ninth Wave.
The "folk music", as it is called in the opening
credits, is performed by a group called "Zinzcaro",
if the name is remembered correctly. (The damn film isn't
out on video in this country, apparently, so IED
can only go by memory about the spelling.) NOT
by the Richard Hickox Singers. This is especially
significant in light of the extraordinary similarity
between the two performances of the piece. On careful
listening, however, it is clear that, although extremely
similar, the two performances are definitely different.
The point where the difference is most clearly audible
is in the forte repeat of the theme: in Kate's version
the singing is a bit stronger, and the bass singer holds
his note steadily between two of the chorus's syllables.
This is not the case in the film version. Also, Kate has
treated the sound of the choir electronically in some way
-- or so it seems to IED -- whereas the film choir, which sings
unaccompanied (Kate's choir is supported by a fermata note
by a string section), is recorded in a more prosaic way.
All of this is particularly interesting because the same
thing seems to be the case with the excerpt from "Curse of
the Demon" which can be heard at the beginning of "Hounds of
Love". IED has been assured that this passage is not the
original, but a careful re-creation. Yet it is so similar that
without such assurance it would be difficult to believe.

If anyone is in contact with a German folk-music fan, perhaps
he/she might ask about "Zinzcaro"? Meanwhile IED plans to try
to track down Richard Hickox.

Incidentally, the lead actor (not Kinski, but the younger
man who plays Jonathan Harker) bears an astonishing resemblance
to the actor whom Kate hired for the romantic lead in her
"Hounds of Love" film. If it weren't for the thinning hair
of the actor in "Nosferatu", IED would swear they were one
and the same man.
