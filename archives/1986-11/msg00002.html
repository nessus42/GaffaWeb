A few brief notes:

Although I havn't had a chance to thoroughly compare them, the first difference
I have noticed between the second Japanese pressing of the CD of "Hounds of
Love" and the original British-released pressing is in the beginning of
"Running up that Hill."  One things I've always noticed (and sort of been
bugged by) is how the fairlight droning intro (when I listen on headphones,
or turn it up loudly) has a "break" in it - so instead of steadily fading
in from nothing, it sort of fades in a bit, and then suddenly increases in
volume, which was probably due to some sort of CD mastering error.
(Perhaps the engineer sneezed while holding onto the fader....)

However, on the Japanese second pressing, they must have corrected it,
'cos it fades in evenly and slowly.  (OK, flame at me for promoting KT trivia...

Secondly, the new Big Country album (oh no...) just got a rave review
by Melody Maker, which specifically pointed out "Kate Bush's ATHLETIC warbling"
and it's celtic/folk influences and overall progression from the earlier
albums.  Nyah Nyah Nyah....


Adding fuel to the "HoL" vs. "The Dreaming" fire.....
I don't have time to go into detail, but one difference between the
two albums (which helps me determine which one is "better") is that
while listening to "TD", I can never concentrate on anything but the
music, and end up somewhat mesmerized by it. However, on "Hounds"
there are times that my attention can wander.
Of course, there's more to it than this, but my friend is pestering
me to hurry up, so more later.

Hugh
