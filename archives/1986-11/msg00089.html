I just got the new Peter Murphy LP, and The Mission's newest EP...
(they must've come out within the past week or so.)

Peter Murphy's LP comes in a gatefold sleeve with artwork similar
to that on his FINAL SOLUTION EP... hmm...I forgot that that single
was available in about 4 different sleeves!  ANyway, it has crayola
art on the cover, and it's called SHOULD THE WORLD FAIL TO FALL APART.
It includes all the songs from the BLUE HEART EP, FINAL SOLUTION EP (including
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR), plus 6 other tracks.  The main musicians are
Peter Murphy and Howard Highes, and features John McGeogh, Daniel ASh,
and many other people on various tracks.

The sound of the album as a whole reminds me of a the group, Dalis Car...
(of which Peter Murphy was in).  Very little distorted guitar...I was
hoping for more songs that sounded like FINAL SOLUTION.  But otherwise,
if you love synths, programmed rythms, and a pop-ish sound...I'd
recommend it.
........................................................................

THe Mission's EP...is...good...but I am getting bored of this stuff!
It is called 'II' (SInce it's their second EP, I guess...)  It has
four tracks and 3 mini-tracks... The mini tracks are like solos by
members of the band - rather dull, if I may say so.  The first track
LIKE A HURRICANE has to be one of the worst songs by them...while the
other three are more their usual sound.  I think too many records have
been made with that standard Sisters of Mercy sound...and their music
just isn't evolving at all.  I'd only recommend this for Sisters of Mercy
fans that haven't gotten sick of them yet...  otherwise, their first single
was much better (SERPENTS KISS)...
........................................................................

By the way, is TUBULAR BELLS by Mike Oldfield available on CD?  I haven't
seen it around...tho' I just got THE COMPLETE MIKE OLDFIELD, a double-CD
set...it's comprised of four sections:1) instrumental, 2) vocal, 3) complex,
4) live... and it cost $34...
