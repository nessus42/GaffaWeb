...... I don't believe that quality is necessarily a prerequisite for becomming
classical.  Many of the non-famous contemporaries of the classics probably
were doing music as good or better than there long-lived brothers.  In many
instances, it seems, being different and setting a trend is a method by which
classical success was achieved.  In other instances (Listz for example) it
was a combination of attitudinal excitement and catchy tunes.  Personally,
I find much classical music boring, however, there are pieces I like.  
Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing if there was 17, 18 or 19 th century
music which we would prefer to 'the classics'.

Now, to extend this into the music world of the last 25 or so years.  I believe
that The Beatles will be remembered and ther music considered 'Classical' in
the 21,22, and 23 centuries (if there are any).  Notice, I also must say that
I don't particularly like the Beatles (I admit they have had their moments).
There influence on the state of contemporary music was astounding, but probably
over-publicized and not to correct.  Yes, all people when cornered usually stickthem into their lists of great influences (Kate may have liked them but I don't
see the great musical influence showing in her work, besides she's just a kid).

Twenty years ago, if this was the Beatles Digest, I think I would come across
similarly to the viewpoints of Hofmann and Wicinski in pushing alternative
musical talent.  In many ways, I don't think that digest would be composed
of people like those who make up Love-Hounds.  Remember, Love Me Do and I
Want to Hold Your Hand etc were not great musical triumphs.  Christ, Harrison
couldn't even do anything but strum back then.  Brian Epstein is to that era
as Hulk Hogan is to today.  The Beatles were probably the most hyped musical
act to hit the American music scene in the 60's.  True, their progression
from Meet the Beatles to the White Album was remarkable, but no more remarkable
than the progression of any other competent musical acts which were their
contemporaries.  I believe that the Beatles will be the classically remembered
group from the period, but, only because of the early hype and the generation
explosion of the 60s period.  For every milestone in the Beatles recording
carreer, it is possible to cite equally importan, if not more important
recordings by other (almost made its) most notably The Who and The Kinks.
and the Animals.  Most people found it strange that I prefered You Really Got
Me to Help, I can See for Miles to Strawberry Fields, and House of the
Rising Sun to any social statement made by the Beatles.  So in the year
2176, people will probably revere George, Paul Johhn and Ringo as we do those
we consider classical composers.  (A subtle difference may exist, however, in
that more information will be stored from this period due to the technological
advvannces than we have record of for the classical era.

Now to the heart of the matter.  I do not believe that Kate stands a chance
in a quadrillion of being remembered for her contributions to the 70/80
period anything like the Beatles were for their period.  That is to say, I
doubt Kate Bush will ever achieve classical status.  In fact, it is probably
true that Madonna will be more revered by the masses who secumb to what is
pushed at them as classical.  Look at it this way, we don't have a choice
as to who we are going to revere from the past centuries, the classics have
already been picked for us.  Snobbery will probably always be a virtue of
the human species and it will be thhe snobbbish aristocrats who will define
what is classical from our lifetime period.  The fact that Kate Bush is not
a household word, I believe, works strongly in her disfavor in achieving
enough memorable clout to sway the aristocrats of the 22nd century.

Concerning the ensuing battle of HoL and TD, my opinion is that I much prefer
TD because I appreciate its daring.  HoL is in a musical (as defined by
whethwewr my wife can tollerate it) sense, more appealing.  Hence, HoL gets
a hell of a lot more airplay (including MTV), has real hits, and can be
listened to by people subject to borderline schizophrenia.  The catch,
HoL is more commercial.  I believe that TD will soon appear in cut-out bins.
Annd willl be the first of Kate's albums to go 'Out of Print' (this is again
a sad commentary on our times).

--This space would have been occupied with a Paul Simon
  philosophical expression, however, Doug took the words
  right out of my VT220--
