Wow! That's what IED calls Love-Hounds: 100% KT.
Well, let's see:

&gt;Well, what happens when Kate does a duo with Bruce and plays
&gt;synthesizer with Rush?  Will they be cool people to discuss
&gt;on this newsgroup, then?  I mean, last year, you would have
&gt;said the same thing about Beeg Cuntry.

IED agrees that there is no intrinsic merit in BG, only ancillary
interest stemming entirely from their association with KT.
Whether their music is good or not is immaterial. It is enough
that they have worked with the greatest living human being.

&gt;Hey, FST do hereby thank IED for his extensive reply on Nosferatu.

Very welcome.

&gt;btw, did IED ever set those "Woh-dudes" straight?  How can they go
&gt;through the rest of their respective lives without knowing the Truth?

No, he didn't. In personal confrontational situations IED is much
less obnoxious than in phosphur. His Wisconsin acquaintances continue
to drift down the river Styx of life blissfully claiming as their own
and disseminating still further the flotsam and jetsam of KT
disinformation up against which they bump.

&gt;I understand that Hair of the Hound will soon be available.

This is great news. Does this mean that the rumor of a U.S. version of
The Single File video compilation, which would replace
some of the old videos therein with the Hair of the Hound films, is
without foundation?

&gt;...Coupled with high quality stereo sound. Hair of the Hound will have
&gt;a digitally encoded soundtrack which should make it the best all
&gt;around Kate expose available...

This also means a high quality sound copy of the
film-only remix section of "Cloudbusting". Amazing.

&gt;I'm going to try to direct-order Hair of the Hound in NTSC from
&gt;a west coast distribuitor I used to deal with.  I'll pass on any info
&gt;I get. If it becomes available soon, I'll be glad to make a VHS HIFI
&gt;copy for anybody who furnishes me proof that they purchased the disk
&gt;(should be $29.95 retail) and doesn't have a laserdisk player on which
&gt;to play it.

Thanks very much, John. Please do announce any new info on this release
as soon as you hear. One eager consumer standing by.

&gt;&gt; From: tsung@aerospace.ARPA
&gt;&gt; btw, where can I get a KB T-shirt?

&gt;You can find them every now and then in some record stores that carry
&gt;lots of obscure T-shirts.  There are some mail order places that carry
&gt;them too.  They are all bootleg type things of only okay quality.  The
&gt;Kate Bush Club was selling some *really* nice black sweatshirts with
&gt;collars and white writing in the HoL script.  The front says "Hounds
&gt;of Love" and the back says "It's in the trees... it's coming!"  On the
&gt;sleeves are the KT logo.  I don't know if they have any more left,
&gt;however.

Different KT shirts are or were available
at different places. The one which IED mentioned in Love-Hounds
was available briefly (for $10.00) at Rene's All Ears
Record Shop on Melrose Avenue, in West Hollywood about
three months ago. It quickly sold out, and none has been
spotted there since then. Joel Watkins used
to have a nice t-shirt of his own design for sale,
and Dale Somerville had a shirt made for the 1983 Winnipeg
KT convention. Both of those were advertised in various
issues of Break-Through, Dale's KT fanzine. Then there
have been four different KT shirts from the KB Club itself:
the original 1978 Lionheart shirt; the Hounds of Love
"designer" shirt (and t-shirt equivalent) which was
available for a few months through mail order, using
a form that was included in the sleeves of UK pressings of
Hounds of Love -- it was very expensive; and the two
1985 Romford Convention-only shirts -- one was the really neat
black sweatshirt with "Hounds of Love" on the front and
"It's in the trees...it's coming" on the back which Doug
mentions above (IED puts his on at the slightest provocation),
and the other a blue polo shirt with "Kate Bush Convention 1985" on
the front. In addition there was another shirt
available through Break-Through in polo-shirt style (i.e.,
a t-shirt with a little blue fold-down collar sewn onto
the top), which has a picture of the Japanese kite
from The Kick Inside on it, and "Kate Bush" printed in "Kick
Inside"-style Japanese lettering on the back. So all told IED knows
of eight shirts himself. Doug mentioned the existence of
a ninth which appropriately illustrates The Ninth Wave. But whether
you can find any of them now, who knows? You could
write to Intergallactic Garage (address in Break-Through),
but then you're paying outrageously inflated
prices, and contributing to the ripping off of hapless
KT fans, as well as the Bush family, of course.

&gt;&gt; (I'd love to have one with "The Dreaming"-style pictures on it, if
&gt;&gt; available at all).

&gt;I've never seen one.  But if you *really* wanted, you could get some
&gt;printed up yourself.  Getting the silkscreen made, however, would
&gt;probably have about a $50 overhead.

If enough L-Hs are willing to contribute, why not order
silkscreen t-shirts for Love-Hounds itself?

As for the question about a poster of the cover of "RUTH",
no, but there was a bootleg poster done of the still photo
of Kate posing in a dance position from the film with the
male dancer, which has "Kate Bush -- Running Up That Hill --
7" and 12"" on it. It's just a crude blow-up of the newsprint
ad put out by EMI in England last September, and it's on very
thin paper. Rhino Records had a bunch of them, selling for
$8.00 apiece, but that was last April. Good luck.
