To further that subtle link between Madonna and Sonic Youth beyond
the Madonna "covers" done by S.Y. mentioned recently by Hoffboy, this
timely piece appeared in L.A. Weekly (7/18) (stolen by me for the
continuing education of L-Hs):
----------------------------------------------------------------
     _True Blue_ could very well be Madonna's _EVOL/LOVE_ LP.  The spinning
nexus of reality 2 fantasy is thematically constant.  Her best songs from 
the last few years have been tied to the top with this magic thread.
_True Blue_ is a true continuation, though it's unfortunately a bit more
refined, glossed and generic.  But ... we don't care.  "White Heat," the
James Cagney tribute, is a total romantic refusal to believe in either
side of the image allove (?) it to EVOLve through her headhole: "Can you
feel the rhythm of my mind/We're not going nowhere till you have a
change of mind."  This single existential concept/decept is continually
apparent in the Sean/Sex devotional song "True Blue"; not so much in the
lyrics as in the cover portrait: What's going on here?  Will we see the
other half of this photo?  Extremely suggestive.  Only time will tell.
The fine line between responsibility/irresponsibility is important to
this function and is dealt with in "Where's the Party?": "I'm not living
in fear/I'm just living in chaos."  This is the necessary progress from
Henry Miller that 1986 demands.  2 other tunes of interest are "La Isla
Bonita," which is a warm affection to Mike Watt: "Last night I dreamt
of San Pedro ..."  And "Live To Tell," possibly Madonna's greatest, most
stirring words and music yet.  We've played this song 1,000 times and
are always transcended.  The album's dynamics (all consonant) aren't 1/2
as interesting as _Like a Virgin_ or the 1st LP, but we have yet to be
inundated to the pleasure-center pliers of repeat, so who's to say?
It's not something we worry about.

				-- Sonic Youth

This and other "reviews" (by Johathan Gold, Craig Lee, Skot Armstrong,
Belissa Cohen, Byron Coley; don't know most of them) are grouped under
the title, "Meditations on Madonna".

Fu-Sheng
p.s. who's Mike Watt?
p.p.s. anybody else interested in the KB silk-screen idea?  I volunteer
Doug to take votes. :-)
