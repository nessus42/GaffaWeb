Well, the latest issue (#23) of *Homeground*, "the International Kate
Bush Fanzine" arrived a few days ago and there's some new news:

Kate is now working on her next album.  She hopes to begin recording
very shortly and the target date for completion is sometime next
Spring (and if you believe that one, I have a very nice Orgone
Accumulator for sale, real cheap.)

A German record company somehow got hold of some of one Kate's early
demo tapes from 1973, and believed it had purchased the rights to
press it.  The album was pressed and entitled *Kate Bush: The Early
Years*.  When Kate found out about it, she took legal action and all
the pressed albums are to be destroyed.

If anyone ever sees one of these, please keep in mind that Doug will
gnaw off his left arm and mail it to you in exchange for this album.

Fred and Judy Vermorel apparantly plan to publish yet another
biography of Kate.

And these are some reviews of "Don't Give Up":

	Melody Maker: The stand-out track is "Don't Give Up"... set
	against his sombre narrative... comes Kate Bush's imploring
	counterpoint, begging him to believe in himself the way his
	family  and friends do.  Her fragile anguished performance
	gives the piece almost unbearable emotional impact...

	Sounds: "Don't Give Up", the worst song on the album, is a
	complicated analogue that winds up sounding like a James
	Taylor poem...

- Doug "Apocalypse Soon" Alan
