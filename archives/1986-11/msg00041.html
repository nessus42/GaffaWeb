Well, I can see both sides, but I think Sue's right...if it weren't for
critics, I wouldn't have bought some things sound unheard that I really
like a LOT.  And, radio stations don't have infinite bucks to buy records,
so promos are where they get them from.  Shit, critics are like music -
you gotta find one that you like (or, translated, has taste that parallels
yours).

I can see your points, Jim and Tim, about people that deserve exposure
not getting it.  And they're valid.  But, there's another level to it - 
I would wager that 80% of "contemporary" material getting released by
indie and major labels doesn't get airplay outside of major markets.
So, your points have validity up to labels such as Rough Trade, etc.,
and you're labelling people like Rough Trade major (and bad?).  Would
you argue that they're not pushing valid music?  For the most part,
I think not.  

I'd shy away from saying that if something's released on a major its bad.
It may be, but there ARE good and committed musicians making music on
majors.  Just because they're making money (or mortgaging their future)
doesn't make their music any less worthwhile.

I guess the point that I'm weaving around here is that you can't argue
black and white in music.  I buy lots of major releases, and I also buy
indie releases.  I buy what sounds good to me and what I like.  I'll
admit that my tastes are not as fringe as some people's, but I don't 
think that they're bad because of that more "mainstreamity."

Bob
