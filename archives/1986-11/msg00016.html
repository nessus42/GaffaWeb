The following is from a friend who bought HoL at my insistence (on CD,
of course)...

[sounds of KB music - "Hounds of Love"] Joe? This is Peter. Kate Bush is
God --- well, is a Goddess. Let me rephrase that: Kate Bush is a Goddess.
She's got one hell of a voice, she's incredibly good-looking, she's a great
writer, she can --- she's, she's great, she's incredible. I want to meet this
woman. I want to get to know her. I want to bear her child. Thank you for
pointing me in the right direction. I want to decorate my room with Kate
Bush posters. That is all. Call me when you get in.

I think we can chalk up another KB fan out there in the wild...

VIS A VIS _The Dreaming_ vs. _Hounds of Love_:

Get your baseball bat ready, Douglas.  When I listen to TD, I hear a lot of
odd rhythms, weird sounds, and a hell of a lot of depression and anxiety.
This isn't bad - it's a perspective that most artists don't like to deal with
(unless you're Ian Curtis or the like). When I listen to HoL, I hear a more
optimistic tone. Because of its visceral attack on my senses, I find it hard
to listen to TD sometimes - literally, it hurts too much. I find listening to
HoL a much more enjoyable experience - not because the music is easier to
listen to. The musical ideas in HoL are just as valid as those in TD, but
presented in a different style. Neither album is BETTER, they're just
DIFFERENT.

People talk of TD's "importance". If it was so important, why is it that it
never got mentioned? Why is it that I only heard about it through this digest?
If it was such a musical phenomena, like (for example) The Beatles' _Sgt. Pep-
per's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ was in 1967, why does most music sound the
same? [Dontcha just LOVE these sweeping generalisations? I do...!] The point
is, however "important" an album you all think it is, the rest of the world
thinks otherwise. NOTE THAT I'M PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE. If you shoot
me down in flames, I'll probably agree with you. But the point is valid: If
it is a landmark album, why has no-one used it as a basemark? Or have I
missed things.
