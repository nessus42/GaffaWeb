&gt;&gt;   This would seem to indicate that you haven't been reading long.
&gt;
&gt;Who cares how long anyone has been reading this group?  

   Every group is composed of varying quantities of readers, lurkers,
old-timers and frequent posters. Those who have been around the longest
tend to supply the core knowledge of the group. Many of thos most
knowledgeable post rarely post, due to the lack of new topics of
discussion.

&gt;&gt;Rec.music.gaffa is famed throughout the entire News hierarchy for
&gt;&gt;the quality and quantity of it's flamage.
&gt;
&gt;And it seems to me like you've been the cause of all of it.

    HA!! *I* am one of the *less* flame-prone individuals on .gaffa of
the past several years. I have been involved in a few flame-wars in my
time, but *nothing* compared to the giants of the past. The *only* flame
I am involved in currently is with *you*. (The disagreement with Drukman
is simple conversation, conducted at a Drukman pitch.) 

&gt;&gt;   This information can be supplied in one message a week when Kate
&gt;&gt;is promoting an album, and one message a year between albums. Traffic
&gt;&gt;like that will result in "Bogus Newsgroup" messages from newsreaders.
&gt;
&gt;So, that justifies your bullying?  That makes it okay that a lot of
&gt;posters that don't feel like being bothered with your insensitive
&gt;remarks start their posts with something like "I hope I don't get
&gt;flamed for this..."  I think that's a real shame that people can't
&gt;just put their opinions out there to be read without you venting your
&gt;spleen.  Fortunately it seems to be you who does it now, and I know
&gt;how to use a kill file.

   Good. You will miss a *lot* of useful information that way.

&gt;&gt;   Make some, but if you post them be assured that you will get flamed
&gt;&gt;*far* beyond the very mild toasting I gave you by the folks who receive
&gt;&gt;Lovehounds via e-mail and start getting 50k+ digests.
&gt;
&gt;I never said I was going to make any, try reading what I wrote instead
&gt;of just skimming for keywords.  I thanked those who made that sample.
&gt;It seems that you are just dying to pick a fight on *any* topic
&gt;whatsoever.

    I was suggesting that Gaffa is what we make of it. If you want more
sound files, make some. But read the FAQ first to find out about the
distribution on e-mail. I assure your ego that I read every single word.
I am *dying* for someone to come up with some new insight into the work
of Kate Bush. Lacking that, I answer questions, thanklessly.

&gt;&gt;   If you'd taken the trouble to read back a week of so, the vast
&gt;&gt;majority of my posts have been of the boring "supply the information"
&gt;&gt;sort. 
&gt;
&gt;If you feel they are so boring, why continue to post them?

   It's boring to repeat the answers to the same questions, over and
over again. I do so out of a sense of responsibility to the Kate fan
community - a community that Vickie and I have been a part of for far
longer than rec.music.gaffa has existed. I know the answer to the 
question, so I post the answer to the question. 

&gt;&gt;  Everyone has an equal *right* to *voice* an opinion, but to claim that
&gt;&gt;all opinions are equally valid makes the entire idea of education silly.
&gt;
&gt;I was not talking about rights here, just common courtesy.  Just the
&gt;fact that apparently not everyone holds your opinions and it doesn't
&gt;take a rocket scientist to figure out that reading this group would be
&gt;nicer without having to wade through your flame posts.

   Again, the vast majority of my posts are informational. I disagreed
with your reaction to a song that I feel that you have not fairly heard.
You reacted with what I can only describe as a somewhat snotty attitude.
The rest has been typical USENET escalation. If you'd like to reach a
truce, give me a call. (312) 508-5283.
