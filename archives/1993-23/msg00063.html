I thought I tell you all about the concert the other night. This is the only
newsgroup where I thought there might be some fans.

Setting: Robin and a piano. The Western Front in Vancouver, about 5:30 on a
hot and muggy day. The Western Front is an old wartime house/hall. Did I
mention hot and muggy, sweat was streaming from everyone. And a packed house!
I sat to her left about 10 feet away.

The first few tunes were new and/or instrumental. One song had a very
signature snipet of "London Bridges falling down", about 3 notes.

She performed most of her "singles" with occasional comments about the nature
or story of the song. Some songs ending with a squeal and laugh from her
daughter in the back of the hall. I don't know if that was planned but it
sure added extra icing to the cake and brought a smile to everyone's face.
And an old tomcat was owling around, plumped himself next to the piano,
purred and washed his face.

In a word, AMAZING, I felt like I was a friend visting her home on a hot west
ooast day.

The encore, of course, was "Rockabye". Robin commented that she hoped it
would put us all to sleep so she could go outside and get some fresh air.
After the encore she more or less shooed us all home.

Upon exiting the hall I was greeted with a cool summers rain.

:)
