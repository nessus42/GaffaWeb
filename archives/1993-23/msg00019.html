&gt;finally said something interesting:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I defer to the opinions of others when I feel that their knowledge of
&gt;&gt;the subject is greater.
&gt;&gt;think their opinions are more valid? Yes.

&gt;ah, but are their opinions *objectively* better?  no!  expertise does
&gt;not improve the worth of an opinion - an opinion has no objective
&gt;value!

  OK, here you say that an opinion has no objective value....

&gt;&gt;All opinions are not equally valid.
&gt;
&gt;i'd say that this is incorrect.  the whole concept of an opinion means
&gt;that it has no objective measurement, thus there can be no validity or
&gt;lack thereof assigned to it.  do you have some sort of tally board
&gt;where you rank the "kateness" of l-h posters and then decide based on
&gt;their Kateness Quotient how worthy of respect their opinion is?

   No. And we know each other well enough that this is a very silly
thing for you to accuse me of.

&gt;&gt;Everyone has an equal *right* to *voice* an opinion, but to claim
&gt;&gt;that all opinions are equally valid makes the entire idea of
&gt;&gt;education silly.
&gt;
&gt;says you.

   Gosh, what a wit!

&gt;&gt;Why pay big bucks to get the opinions of professors, when you could ask
&gt;&gt;anyone on the street for free?
&gt;
&gt;good professors foster a *diversity* of opinions in their classes.
&gt;bad ones impose a single viewpoint (usually their own).  ever hear of
&gt;the "marketplace of ideas"?

   I didn't say impose. But is the professor only a moderator? How can
the class not be based primarily on the on the opinions of the person
defining the curriculum (sp?). Why even have a classroom and lectures?
Why don't the students simply agree to meet and discuss everything
without the school?

&gt;&gt;My opinions about Heavy Metal have *no* validity at all. No one
&gt;&gt;should ever ask my opinion about Heavy Metal.
&gt;
&gt;and why not?  your opinion is no better or worse than anyone else's.

   OK, here you say that my opinion is as valid as anyone elses...

&gt;&gt;Given that I can accept that my opinions have varying levels
&gt;&gt;of validity, I believe everyone has opinions about many different
&gt;&gt;subjects, and that some of those opinions are going to be of variable
&gt;&gt;quality.
&gt;
&gt;well, you believe wrong things, and it is my unpleasant duty to summon
&gt;you back to the reality that us ordinary earthlings inhabit.

   ...and here you say it isn't.

&gt;i read music newsgroups and subscribe to music mailing lists all the
&gt;time because i am *curious* about what other people think about
&gt;particular records.  after a period of frequenting a group, i begin to
&gt;learn about the people behind the postings.  if you post a glowing
&gt;review of an album, it's pretty much guaranteed to be a piece of utter
&gt;crap in my eyes because i know what you're like.  on the other hand,
&gt;if i read one of Pete Ashdown's thoughtful and intelligent XDZebra
&gt;reviews, i know from past experience that my tastes are pretty much in
&gt;line with his and i will enjoy stuff that he enjoys.

    ...and here you agree that there are other people with opinions
that you value far more than mine. Which way do you want it?

&gt;i have no idea why you're playing this dumb game, chris.  is it
&gt;because you truly wish to squash the "wrong thinkers" in this group?

   Bullshit. I'm not squashing anyone, anymore than you are, anymore
than any disagreement does.
