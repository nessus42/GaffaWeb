Thanks for the info.
VW gave an interview on 99X (radio station in Atlanta that Kate
fans should stick like glue to :-] and support).
She's suffering from Multiple Sclerosis, incidentally.
She mentioned a lot of the items in the environment that are
possible carcinogens and was very educationmal without being
preachy. I didn't know diddly about her, and must confess I wasn't
crazy about the songs I heard covered (maybe the originals were
better!) but I ended up very impressed with her cause and ideas.
Musicians usually rely on each other when they have an illness, for
it is difficult to pay for insurance if you make a living as a
musician. Her fund will not only help her cover the medical
expenses incurred by her fight with MS but will also help future
musicians: she has established a trust fund to be used by those in
medical need of assistance. (SORRY for typos. I hate this keypad!)
FYI, some of the carcinogens were surprises: vinyl from new car
seats contains chemicals that seep ouyt over time...only cracked
vinyl has lost the toxic chemical, for it makes vinyl supple and
shiny. Of course, hydrogenated oils and fats and pesticides, and
BHT and MSG and chemicals. VW is growing her own plot of fresh
organic vegetables and investigating Chinese medicine (if I heard
right). Also, building materials (she reeled off a long list,
including asbestos) and other items. It was depressing. I was
impressed by her openess about her troubles and interested in her
information. Hopefully I've done it justice.
At any rate, no, it doesn't have anything to do with Kate, but it
does have a good purpose. If you like the groups mentioned, I am
sure you'll find it valuable. 
Best to you,
Malinda
