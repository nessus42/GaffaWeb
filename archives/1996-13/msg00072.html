[I want to preface this post by saying that it was actually written back on
February 19th.  I found out that Wieland was going to be gone for two weeks
just as I was going to post it that day, so I held onto it to send when he
was back, since many of the comments are about the demo lyrics.  I know
he's been back for a bit now, but my head fell off and it took me until
today to find it. :)  I hope it's not too difficult to follow.]

Wieland asked:  Violet! 'My funny little darling', are you Kate?
Violet says:  Pssst!  Maybe...  ;)

"Senora Dali" doesn't really seem so exotic, does it, considering that Dali
was Spanish?  That's why it made sense to me, anyway.  (I sort of feel also
-- personal vision only, this --  that "debris everywhere" is a reference
to the state of Dali's studio.  I mean, I know what MINE looks like, and
"debris everywhere is it!  But in no way does this opinion discount the
possibility that Kate may have had a specific painting in mind when she
wrote it.)

Wieland asks (regarding "Rare Flower"), "What about the 'of' after the
whisper?"  Well, it's just her musical phrasing of the word.  Notation of
details like this is always tough, but it's something like "whis-pa-er,"
however you would transcribe a quirk like that.  I've worked on a lot of
lyrics where people get hung up on things like that.  Most common is the
idea that every sound is a WORD.   Not always so.  (Right now, on another
list, people are getting caught up by the singer's "uh" 's, constantly
writing them down as "a".  This, for example, would make "I went to the
uh-market" become "I went to the a market."  Or "uh-Many people were
walking down the street" turns into "A many people were walking down the
street."  Sort of silly, isn't it?)

In "Davy", the line "The wall was too steep with a crack in the moment as I
held you" IS difficult to hear.  That's why it's giving everyone fits.  But
when you listen, and I don't guarantee it's right (who can?  Hello
Kate...), listen with the thought that "was too steep" is strung together
and glossed over very quickly, and "the moment" is slurred.  I always
pictured Kate holed up in the loo after everyone had gone to bed, half
asleep but determined to get it on tape.  I mean, where else would you get
a killer reverb like that?!  Incidentally, I always imagine the setting of
this song an abandoned house and the time nearing daybreak, with the sky
just beginning to lighten up, but still a deep blue-black.  I see Kate and
Davy lying on blankets on the floor of an empty room, this being the only
place that they are able to sneak to and be together in.  See, I got my
first kiss in a place like that, having left my friends behind at a party.
:) &lt;sigh&gt;

To add my own nitpicking remark to Rolf's, who made mention of lyrics to
"Feeling Like a Waltz" listed somewhere and quoted the line "L'amour--mon
choux avec un etranger:  I'm surprised by that line to begin with.  See, I
believe it's "L'amour marche avec un etranger" which is "Love walks with a
stranger" meaning of course that love is with someone somewhere, but
certainly not with her.

About boring Prince Charlie at the "Prince's Trust Gala,", I think the
funniest part is when he's talking to the reggae band guys (they're the
ones who won the contest, I think).  I always turn the sound off and do my
own voiceover.
The prince (me, in my best, most holy royal imitation):  "Oh, yes, here,
look, I'm pretending to be talking to you and acting amused.  Mmmm, ahhh,
hmmm,... OOOh, don't touch me, you sweaty, sweaty man!  Good gracious, how
I wish I were anywhere but here right now!  Please, stand back!  You're
dripping on me.  Well, I just feel filthy now, damn commoners.  Is this
enough P.R. yet?"  He really does look like he's gritting his teeth inside,
doesn't he?  Hey, what about that wonderful song that Joan Armatrading
does, BTW?  Wow.  I could hear Kate doing a cover of that. &lt;hint, hint&gt;
Oh, and about the Ian Andersson stories, maybe he isn't really so absent
minded as we think.  I mean, I do think he's probably over-dramatising the
facts, but I can completely imagine that after Kate finished her song, she
quickly exited the stage, perhaps speeding up as she hit the wings, and
being like, "Oh, my God! I thought I was going to die!  Did you see what
happened? Right in the middle, too!  God!"  And who knows, isn't it
possible that she may have gone out and done a second number?  Does anyone
know whether the entire show made it on tape?  I'm pretty sure the
"Prince's Trust" concerts last more than an hour!  Even if Kate only went
out for a bow with everyone else at the end of the show, surely she would
have done SOMETHING to temporarily fix her straps before going out again.
I do see how there could have been some truth to the story.  And I do
imagine that Kate would have been very nervous to meet the prince, also.
Quite plausible.  She has spoken before about being speechless or flubbing
up when she's met someone famous.  Why not over the prince?

Yack, yack, yack!  I know.  But this was better than posting eight
different times.  For ME, anyway.

In Kate,
Violet  xoxox
