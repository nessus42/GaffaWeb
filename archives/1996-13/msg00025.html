Hello friends,

IED wrote:
&gt;And Wieland agrees:
&gt; &gt; It IS Smurf.
&gt; &gt; Al Murphy was known to her as Smurf.
&gt;IED doesn't know where these two usually authoritative 
&gt;Kate Bushologists got their information from, but, on 
&gt;the contrary, the lyric sheet clearly has " 'S Murph", the 
&gt;contraction almost certainly referring either to "It's" 
&gt;or to "There's".

I think I was to fast with my statement. Thanks for paying attention!
The only evidence for "Smurf" I could find were two LH mails deducing this
from the song, and HG 48 p. 5 where PDFM writes "Smurf". I vaguely remember
reading it elsewhere too, but can't remember where. I'm not sure
anymore. Chris, do you have any evidence for "Smurf"? I'm sorry about this
possibly false information.

&gt; It almost broke my heart when I heard of his death, and I'm sure it broke
&gt; hers. 

&gt;From The Sun, Oct, 21st 1989:
A spokesman for Kate said she was "absolutely devastated". 

&gt;From Daily Mirror, Nov, 4th 1989:
Singer Kate Bush wept yesterday at the graveside of her former guitarist
Alan Murphy, who died of AIDS.
Chart-topper Kate was too upset to talk about 35-year-old Alan after the
service. She buried her face in her brother John's shoulder as she left the
cemetery in Great Burstead, Essex.
Among the flowers at the grave was a huge bunch of red lilies and laurel
leaves from Kate. They were signed with two kisses. 


"They kiss me with tears."
               --Kate Bush

XOXOX
