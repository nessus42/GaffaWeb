Vickie said:
&gt;The tour stuff is easliy debunked,
&gt;&gt;lest anyone take any of it seriously, but the rumours of Kate's
&gt;&gt;having an affair with Tom Waits and Peter Gabriel are something
&gt;&gt;that can quickly be spread around by casual scanners of the
&gt;&gt;newsgroup, who may not wait around to find out that they were
&gt;&gt;only part of a very funny and interesting self-group troll.

Then Stev0 wrote:
&gt;I heartily agree.  Especially since Kate's REAL Significant Other,
&gt;k.d. lang, often reads this newsgroup.

Very funny, Mr. Stev0!  &lt;whew!&gt;  Here I was feeling quite horrid, having
gotten rapped sharply across my wee little knuckles, and I decided I wasn't
going to play in the sandbox anymore.  And then you made me laugh. :)  I
was sort of wondering anyway (but didn't want to say anything for fear of
just proving myself dense), couldn't casual scanners of the newgroup make
up their own rumors and spread them around anyway, regardless of what WE do
or don't say?  I just imagined that if someone trotted along at a later
date and told somebody that Kate had dated Tom Waits, well, everyone would
see that the emperor wasn't wearing any clothes, so to speak.  It might
prove a useful way to weed out pseudo-love-hounds.  Besides, I think that
anybody with half a brain would see that this is all joking, and if they
didn't, I'd be far more worried about them playing with computers at all
than about what they would see here.

&gt;
&gt;"Kate plays with Peter,
&gt;Peter plays with Jane
&gt;Jane plays with Tori,
&gt;Tori's Happy again..."

Change the last two lines to
"Stev0 plays with Violet,
Violet's happy again..."   :)


Violet (feeling not QUITE so wicked herself any more)
xoxox

P.S. Check it out:  k.d./K.T.   Coincidence?  &lt;------ JOKE JOKE JOKE JOKE
     (WARNING:  THAT RIGHT THERE, JUST ABOVE
                THIS...  THAT IS A JOKE.) ;&gt;

           I'm taking no more chances.
