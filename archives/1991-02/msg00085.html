&gt; &gt;1000 homo djs                    1000 Homo DJs
&gt; Very homophobic name, but I've heard they're interesting industrial ... any
&gt; comparisons?

They're all gay, so I'm not sure it can be seen as a truly homophobic name!

&gt; &gt;ac/dc                            AC/DC
&gt; Baaaad ... "For Those About to Rock, We Salute You"??? please!  Mindless late
&gt; '70's pseudo-metal.

They may or may not be bad, but they certainly aren't "pseudo-metal".
Motley Crue, Cinderella, and half the bands on MTV are pseudo-metal.
The name Heavy Metal was made for bands like AC/DC.

&gt; &gt;anderson laurie                          Laurie Anderson
&gt; I haven't heard enough to really judge, but I like my singers to
&gt; sing, not ...  perform.

Don't be a narrow-minded twit!

&gt; &gt;asia                             Asia
&gt; Vaguely tolerable early '80's remnants of late '70's progressive ... actually
&gt; one of the better '70's progressive bands, with Yes and Boston.

Asia is soooo bad, I'd rather eat the puke of 100 rhinoceroses than
listen to 30 seconds of Asia.  It's wimpy and pathetic.  Barry Manilow
music is twice as interesting sounding as Asia.  Boston is almost as
bad.

&gt; &gt;beatles                                  Beatles
&gt; Yeah, they're OK ... there isn't one real album (greatest hits don't count)
&gt; that I know of that has all their good stuff on it ... 

That's because nearly every song from *Rubber Soul* on is fanatastic,
so you have to buy all their albums starting from *Rubber Soul* to get
most of  their good stuff.  And then, of course, there's plenty of
great stuff on the earlier albums too.

&gt; &gt;birdsongs of the mesozoic        Birdsongs of the Mesozoic
&gt; Sonic Geology, eh?  Yeah, their music moves about as gracefully as a hunk of
&gt; granite.

What a beautiful hunk of granite it must be!!!

&gt; &gt;brown julie                      Julie Brown
&gt; eMpTyVee at its worst ... at least she realizes how bad she is and
&gt; doesn't take herself seriously.

One of the only things worth watching on MTV.

&gt; &gt;bush kate                        Kate Bush
&gt; Probably the wrong place to say this, but WAY overrated.  She has
&gt; talent, yes, but her voice is somehow hardly ever quite right.  And
&gt; I can NEVER forgive her for ruining Peter Gabriel's "Don't give up".

Death to the INFIDEL!

&gt; &gt;butthole surfers                 Butthole Surfers
&gt; No talent.  None.  I love 'em.  Hairway to Steven** is great, though much
&gt; mellower than much of the rest of their stuff.

Incredible amounts of talent.  I love 'em.

&gt; &gt;cabaret voltaire                 Cabaret Voltaire
&gt; I've heard they're interesting industrial -- any comparisons?

Their early stuff is interesting industrial.  Their later stuff is
boring, all-sounds-the-same, industrial dance funk.

W is for WEST, who went too far north
