mjm (Mike Mendelson) says:

&gt; 3 Mustaphas 3 are a mystery band

and

&gt; I notice that NoteWorthy lists one title by 3M3 (Heart of Uncle on Ryko)
&gt; but if anyone knows about where to get any other albums by these guys
&gt; (CD or otherwise) I would be interested in hearing about it

let me add hastily that these fine balkan fellows (also only from the UK)
play with great merrily and skill and also funny until it hurts, 
particular with their quaint foreign way of tongue.  also famous for
famous sayings, like "Forward in all directions" and "Take it to the
fridge" (They actually toured with a fridge for a while...)

anyway, the wacky Mustapha brothers (and sister Lavra, who is also not
related to any of the others, just like the rest of them) are a
sight to behold, in fact a sight to drive some ways, pay a large fee, 
wait and line, and *then* behold, with great delight!  having seen them
twice, i can confirm that they wear funny hats and are also possessing
of great musical suits - er - skill.  they have three albums, all on
CD from Rykodisc (whose name is worth capitalizing!):

	Shopping
	Heart of Uncle
	Soup of the Century

buy them all -- otherwise you might not.  Hijaz 'Hank' Mustapha produced
the latest Boiled in Lead album (Orb), so you better go buy that too!
(I just saw BiL last week -- almost as good as 3M3 but fewer hats.)

also mjm says

&gt; Also, I have recently listened to music by two Kate session musicians:
&gt; Weber and Stivell.  The Harp is quite haunting and beautiful, while
&gt; Weber's music is Jazzier.  It is always interesting to listen to
&gt; artists kate likes and uses to try to assess just what it is that
&gt; attracts her to them.

Mr. Stivell has been playing almost since KaTe was born -- but as i recall
*he* came to her about working together.  i'm not sure of the history
behind Mr. Weber's involvement, but he has a serious following in europe
as a key figure in the "ECM" style of jazz.  in short, these are not
what you would normally call "session musicians";  rather, they are artist
who have chosen to work with Ms. Bush.  for me, the interest is as much
in what it is that attracts *them* to *her*... same with Dave Gilmour,
Planxty, Rolf Harris, et all -- a remarkable group of collaborators.

i too seem to have lost several days worth of posts -- i guess .gaffa
hiccuped again.

footah!
