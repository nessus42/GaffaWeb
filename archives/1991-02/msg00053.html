   Somehow I didn't think my first post would be quite like this.

   Anyway I've been sitting here in the background oh so very quietly 
thinking to myself,"you should post something........but what to post?" 
when along comes the most recent issue of Love-hounds.  And well having 
read the Fantastic Four and always liking Johnny I sez to myself, "Flame 
On!"

But actually I'll try to keep calm.  JSTURNER posts that this should be a 
forum for other artists and proceeds to attack KaTe.  Now I like a number 
of these artists he mentioned, in particular I think the Stone Roses are 
wonderful BUT...............FIRSTLY this IS a forum for KaTefans.  
Secondly, if he doesn't like KaTe fine, his loss but were his statements 
really necessary.  Its almost as if he was trying to incite something.  I 
mean there are plenty of artists I don't like but I don't go around 
trashing them.  In particular I have a little more intelligence than 
posting a remark slamming them on their own newsgroup/mailer.

I suppose I could go on trying to explain to him how he is so VERY VERY 
wrong about KaTe and give all sorts of examples of the sheer brilliance of 
her music, but what good would that do.  We all know absolutely none.

And if he had a criticism of KaTe fine but do it in a manner more adult 
like.  I mean obviously you don't discuss with a person who already has 
their mind made up.

Finally I would suggest to Mr Sturner that if he wants more alternative 
groups he try rec.music.misc or nm-list@beach.cis.ufl.edu or he if wants to 
make comments like that he try alt.flame
