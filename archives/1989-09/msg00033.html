 To: Love-Hounds (really Corey Lofdahl)
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: J. Christian Bach

     First, IED wanted to thank Corey for his very kind words to IED.
But IED can't reach Corey through his address. Since Corey asked about
an aspect of a musical discussion that took place in Love-Hounds, IED
has decided to respond to his inquiry through this group.
     Johann Christian Bach (1735-1782), one of Johann Sebastian Bach's
sons, was far better known in the latter half of the 18th century
than his father, believe it or not. In fact, the works of J. _S._
Bach have only during the twentieth century gained the pre-eminent
status we now consider their due. J. _C._ Bach was extremely well known
both in Europe and in England (where he lived much of his working life)
because he was practically the inventor of the classical style (as
opposed to the so-called Baroque style of which his father was the
supreme master). J. Christian Bach virtually originated the symphony;
prior to that time the dominant form for large pieces had been the suite.
J. Christian Bach also created the first of the melody-based (rather than
form- or development-based) styles of eighteenth-century composition,
and it's this style which Haydn and Mozart developed into what is
now probably the first kind of "classical" music that people think
of when they think of the word "classical". When Mozart begain writing
symphonies (i.e. when he was _eight_!) Christian Bach was his
greatest inspiration and his works were the model for much of Mozart's
early instrumental music.
     Only quite late in Mozart's career did he become suddenly deeply
involved in a study of Johann _Sebastian_ Bach's works, and this study
resulted in a more sophisticated contrapuntal element in Mozart's
later music. Mozart, and after him Chopin, were extremely untypical
for their time in appreciating the true importance of J. Sebastian
Bach's music, during the century following his death in 1750.

-- Andy, who is not really qualified to be lecturing on musical
   history like this, but since you asked...
