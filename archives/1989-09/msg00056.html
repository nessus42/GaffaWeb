                    The Lyrics of Kate Bush: Appendix

               Seventeen unreleased songs (ca. 1972-1977)


     These seventeen songs, which were part of a tape containing
twenty-two songs (five of which were earlier versions of songs
later included in Kate's first three albums), have never been
released. Consequently I am not sure of the words. Nor have any of
the titles which I have given the songs been confirmed by Kate. A
more complete version of these lyrics will be included in the third
edition of _The_Garden_. In the meantime, IED is risking the ridicule
which would be his due should the actual lyrics be discovered and his
embarrassing mistakes exposed.

-- Andrew Marvick


_Camilla_

 Last night you were on my balcony.
 You needn't try, know the whole story.
 Before it's too late I must get away,
 But both of us know you must stay.

     Oh, come on, Camilla,
     Surrender into the roses.
     Go back home under the posies.
     Surrender into the roses,
     Camilla, Camilla, Camilla.

 Tying, dying, flowers around the room.
 It keeps me safe, but oh! the sickly perfume.
 Well, it makes me long for the good times,
 When you were really alive.

     Oh, come on, Camilla,
     Surrender into the roses.
     Go back home under the posies.
     Surrender into the roses,
     Camilla, Camilla, Camilla.


_The_Craft_of_Life_

 I tried to study it for just a while:
 All of the potions, from oysters to seducing smiles.
 But I've found it's already inside me:
 A big warm bubble of sensuality,
 There to be burst,
 But I'm worried about getting hurt.

     I know how you like to kiss.
     I'll ask you what you're thinking.
     Soul burns, and I don't care.
     The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish.

          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          Oo-ooh...

 Tears spring to mind when I go back in time.
 All those lost bodies just seeking security.
 Jittering strangers with smutty hands,
 Heavy and clever and full of demands.
 Well I'm similar to you:
 We're familiar with what to do.

     I know how you like to kiss.
     I'll ask you what you're thinking.
     Soul burns, and I don't care.
     The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish.

          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          The craft of life,
          Oo-ooh...


_Davy_

&lt;N.B.: I am not even sure that this is the name Kate is uttering
in the song, or even whether it is indeed a name. This title has been
bandied about for years among fans, but no-one had ever reported hearing
the song itself until the emergence of new bootlegged tapes in 1989.
It does now seem clear, however, that the song which I am calling _Davy_
is quite unrelated to the song known as _Maybe_, even
though the two titles have sometimes been used to refer to
the same song. There is no lyrical or musical connection between
the two songs.&gt;

 I stayed the night in your arms.
 Over half an hour I stayed awake,
     Looking at you.

 Your face seemed radiant.
 The walls --------------,
     As I held you.

     Oo-ooh...

     ------------------------------.
     I closed my eyes -------------.
     You --------------------------.
     Hold me, oh hold me.

          Davy, Davy,
          Bending like a willow-branch.
          He rocks me like a baby.

     Oo-ooh...

 I know he loves another lady,
 But I still see him in the hallway
     Calling me.

 Oh, when we danced so closely,
 I really felt as though I was melting
     In a pool.

     Oo-ooh...

     ------------------------------.
     I closed my eyes -------------.
     You --------------------------.
     Hold me, oh hold me.

          Davy, Davy,
          Bending like a willow-branch.
          He rocks me like a baby.


_Disbelieving_Angel_

 So much for all the prayers you've learned.
 They are no help to basic needs.
 And all the worlds they've shown you
 Just make you even greedier.

      So what about divinity?
      I'm further away than before.
      You're like two stars colliding,
      And you're never going to hit the floor.

 Why should I whisper in the church?
 Because they say it's sacred ground?
 Oh, my sacrilege would do you good.
 You see, there's nothing here, I've found.

      I feel so sorry for you,
      Believing because they control.
      And of all the guardian angels
      They chose me to save your soul!

 Oh, I'm just trying to explain,
 I'm a disbelieving angel.



_Eddie_the_Queen_

 I've never seen
 Such a sad queen
 As Eddie.
 I've seen him raving,
 Maybe even in pain,
 But never
      Weeping like a baby.

     On Saturday afternoon
     He was really fine to him.
     And on Saturday evening,
     Oh, well Eddie was so pretty.
     But now his boy is leaving.

 Hey, boy, you're so young
 To be a queen weeping.
 You're just a little princess.
 Oh, Eddie, don't!
 'Cause what can I do
 But listen to you tell your story?

     On Saturday afternoon
     He was really fine to him.
     And on Saturday evening,
     Oh, well Eddie was so pretty.
     But now his boy is leaving.
     But now his boy is leaving.
     But now his boy is leaving him.

Queen, come home soon!


_Feeling_Like_a_Waltz_

 Slipping past the chimney-pots,
 Down among the ashes, away from old times--
 Why must I self-indulge in memories?
 I should be celebrating to a moving melody,

      But it hurts me, it hurts me,
      Honey, honey, it hurts me.
      And I'm feeling like a waltz,
      Growing old, old, old, old, old.

 I was firy but you put me out.
 I was always one for loving and leaving.
 I like to think I was immune to romance.
 I should be laughing at some good old comedy.

      Oh, but it hurts me, it hurts me.
      Honey, honey, it hurts me.
      And I'm feeling like a waltz--

 If you laughed at me, I'd laugh too.
 &lt;Inaudible&gt;, don't you know that I'd be really breaking.

 L'amour--mon choux avec un etranger.

 I shouldn't care, you're not my darling anymore,

      But it hurts me, it hurts me,
      Honey, honey, honey, honey.
      And I'm feeling like a waltz,
      Growing old, old, old, old, old.


_Ferry_Me_Over_

 High,
 ---------------------------.
 Alone and higher still
 She keeps her gallery.
 Distance means nothing
     To me.

          A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,
          A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...

     Debris everywhere,
     Gazing. It's amazing.
     Ferry me over,
     Ferry me over,
     Ferry me over
         The music, darling.

Deeper here
Lie hidden
Answers and treasures for him.
"Oh, I prefer absence," said she,
"My heart grows fonder
     Alone."

          A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,
          A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...

     Debris everywhere,
     Gazing. It's amazing.
     Ferry me over,
     Ferry me over,
     Ferry me over
         The music, darling.


_Frightened_Eyes_

 Just traveling on a bus
 From a friend's home,
 And all these people are looking at me.
 They're gazing out windows,
 At any English country &lt;garden?&gt;.

 But as gazes meet,
 Vacancy shows onscreen.
 But I feel inside
 The latent hysteria:
 "Why is she looking at me?"

     And as I drift from one to one I can see
     They're all like me.
     They've all got frightened eyes
     Saying what they're thinking,
     What they are doing tonight.

     They've all got frightened eyes,
     Saying, "Leave me alone,
     I'm perfectly safe here inside.
     Please don't surprise me."

 Expressionless.
 Everyone here loves cheap wine--
 We all know good taste,
 We just get too busy trying to find
 The right games to play.

 Impatient, aren't we all?
 Watching the time trip by.
 And all these people are looking at me.
 They're gazing out windows.
 They're burning out in there.

     And as I drift from one to one I can see
     They're all like me.
     They've all got frightened eyes
     Saying what they're thinking,
     What they are doing tonight.

     They've all got frightened eyes,
     Saying, "Leave me alone,
     I'm perfectly safe here inside.
     Please don't surprise me."


_Hot_in_the_Ice_

 Whenever I look out french windows
 It's always snowing outside.

 Feel your body relax on mine,
 Giving me all the good lines,
     (Uh-huh)
          All the good lines,
          All the good lines...

     Hot in the ice,
     On fire inside,
     A snowball.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.

     Hot in the ice,
     On fire inside,
     A snowball.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.

 A crystal layer of ice on our skin:
 Very numb outside but warm within.

 I bend to join our lips, but it's too cold
 To kiss and hit. Is it you I'm feeling?
          Is it you I'm feeling?
     (Yes?)
          Is it you I'm feeling?

     Hot in the ice,
     On fire inside,
     A snowball.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.

     Hot in the ice,
     On fire inside,
     A snowball.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.
     Ah, but she's wonderful,
     Set in the snow.


_Keeping_Me_Waiting_

 A long way up in light-years,
 Just a pinpoint in space,
 In a century of planetary storms,
 Stranded at the moonbase,

      The air is getting low.
      The air is getting low.

 Looking out at the roof-window,
 I've seen many strange things,
 From shooting stars to Stars 'n' Stripes--
 Thought I'd caught a glimpse of golden wings.

      The air is getting low,
      The air is getting low,
      The air is getting low,
      The air is getting low.

           I got the vision of big white dove.
           I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above.
           I'm wond'ring why the big white dove
           Is keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting.

 Looking way down below me,
 The worlds are all awhirl-whirly. &lt;Uncertain&gt;
 Won't you come along beside?
 This place waits for company.

      The air is getting low.
      The air is getting low.

 I leave my limbs behind me.
 As I'm being lifted
 Out into the--into the
 Spiritual boom-boom abyss. &lt;uncertain&gt;

      The air is getting low.
      The air is getting low.
      The air is getting low.
      The air is getting low.

           I got the vision of big white dove.
           I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above.
           I'm wond'ring why the big white dove
           Is keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting,
           Keeping me waiting, keeping me waiting.


_On_the_Rocks_

 Destiny took me in her arms and told me:
 "You're a little lost on the fall.
  You fall for all the men
  You shouldn't fall for at all."
 Ooh, I know she knows, but still I go on,
 Well, I'm a fool.

     Climbing up the atoms
     To slide down the adders
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks...

 Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,
 A burning sword.
 I'd like to cry. I look into her eyes.
 I see she -----------.
 "Ooh," she says,
 "The games are still the same, I see,
  But they've changed the names now.
  Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart?"

     Lionhearts in the asylums,
     Lionhearts tossed at sea,
     Lionhearts who've lived their lives, like Arthur.
     Lionhearts in cathedrals,
     Lionhearts at mournings,
     Lionhearts in every seed--
          But they're sown
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks...

 Somebody I couldn't see
 Tied me up and put me away,
 Here on the rocks,
 Here on the rocks,
 Here on the rocks...


_Pick_the_Rare_Flower_

 There's beauty in such a sacred structure,
 That thing that is nurtured and loved.
 It's quite an occasion.
 It's driving me crazy.

 I'm not allowed to touch -----.
 I've gotta get a hold of myself.
 I must-----doo-doo-doo-doo-doo...

     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't
          Pick the rare flower.

     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't
          Pick the rare flower.

 Walking in a Paradise or Eden,
 Oh, temptation:
 Give me one second to succumb.

 It's calling me.
 -------------- whisper.
 Magical---------------.
 I've gotta get a hold of myself,
 You see, but it ain't easy.

     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't
          Pick the rare flower.

     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't,
     I don't see why I shouldn't
          Pick the rare flower.


_Playing_Canasta_in_Cold_Rooms_

I fell in love with Rinfi the gypsy.
He said when I grew up he'd marry me,
Carry me away on his steed.

"Don't worry, my baby!
 Don't die, my funny little darling!
 I'm going away for a little while,
 And shouldn't be gone for very long."

Ooh, then I really fell for Geoffrey, our gardener.
He said he'd marry me, too.
Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool.

"Don't worry, my honey!
 Don't die, my funny little doll!
 I'm going away for a little while.
 Shouldn't be gone for very long."
 (Ooh, a very, long, long time!)

     Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,
     Playing canasta in cold rooms,
     Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,
     And in my lover's...ooh...

I met a boy who took me upstairs,
Then took me in his arms and told me
I comforted him, uh-huh.

"Don't worry, my dear,
 Don't cry, you weird little stranger.
 I'm going away.
 You probably won't ever see me again."

Oh, yes, I know, I'm always falling,
Gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes.
How could I not lie there with you?

"Don't worry, my darling!
 Don't die, my silly little baby!
 I'm going away for a little while,
 And shouldn't be gone for very long."
 (Ooh, long, long, long!)

     Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,
     Playing canasta in cold rooms,
     Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,
     And in my lover's...ooh...


_Something_Like_a_Song_

 There's something that sounds like a song
 In my garden, by the willow--
 A piper:
 "Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo..."

 I see him when I turn the lights down low,
 In my garden, wading through the pond.
 Resting so ------------.
 "Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo..."

 I've called him by every name I know,
 By every name I know,
 But he won't answer me.
 He keeps coming forward, but never moving.
 Is there no destiny here?

 It sounds like a song
 In my garden, by the willow--
 A piper:
 "Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo..."


_Who_is_Sylvia?_

 Come closer to me, babe,
 And the night will come much closer, too.
 Can't you see the light
 Drawing pictures nearer in the skies?

 What is that you whisper
 When you close your eyes?
 Come closer to me, babe.
 Is it me it's all about?
 And who is that you're always
 Calling in your sleep?
 Who is Sylvia?

     Goodnight, baby. Please
     Come on home,
     Come on home,
     Come on home soon.
          Goodnight, baby,
          Goodnight, baby,
          Goodnight, baby,
          Goodnight, baby.

 Come closer to me now,
 For I know there's something you must tell me.
 When slumber slips between your lips
 Will the secrets ooze out easily?

 What is that you whisper
 When you close your eyes?
 Come closer to me, babe.
 Is it me it's all about?
 And who is that you're always
 Calling in your sleep?
 Who is Sylvia?

     Goodnight, baby. Please
     Come on home,
     Come on home,
     Come on home soon.
          Goodnight, baby,
          Goodnight, baby,
          Goodnight, baby,
          Goodnight, baby.


_You're_Soft_

 Held in your arms in the back seat,
 Cruising down the main street,
 How can anyone have such little defense?

     You're soft.

 In between the sheets, left in limbo,
 Covered me like a pillow--
 I can hardly tell the difference.

     You're soft,
     So soft.
     To be, to be with you
     I'd leave everything.

           But I don't know how to deal with you.
           I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.
           Love would melt me like hot butter.

     You're soft,
     So soft.
     To be, to be with you
     I'd do anything.

 Walking down the street, brushing arms,
 You're moonlight dancing.
 I try hard to keep my feelings in.

     You're soft.

 Dancing to the music, so low.
 I knead you like dough.
 How can anyone be so loving

     And soft,
     So soft?
     To be, to be with you
     I'd leave everything.

          But I don't know how to deal with you.
          I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.
          You melt me like hot butter.

     You're soft,
     So soft.
     To be, to be with you
     I'd do anything.
