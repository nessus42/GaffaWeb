 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: K T   N E W S

     Kate finished the album one week ago today. It's in the can.
The album will _definitely_ be released in September. This is
straight from John Carder Bush's mouth, this very afternoon.
     No, IED is not at liberty to explain how he knows this,
he just does. He may be able to provide more details soon, however.
     (Incidentally, L-Hs is _the_ Kate Bush news source, know that? What
with this info and the complete demo lyrics and tape project, L-Hs has
all the fanzines shot to hell. We should give some thought to going into
a print edition.)
     If the pattern is the same as for earlier albums, then Kate
will take a one-month vacation around this time, before beginning
work on the preparation for the first single release. IED doesn't
have any concrete information about anything like that, however.
But this news does not augur well for a tour, at least as far as IED
can tell. Because she has already said (through _Homeground_) that she
plans to shoot the videos for the first three singles before the album
is actually released this time. IED doesn't know how she's going
to be able to do even that by September, not if it takes the six
weeks of preparation and shooting and postproduction per video that
_Cloudbusting_ and _Hounds_of_Love_ took. But again, it's pointless
to speculate.
     Anyway, everyone who was still wondering--count on it: September
it is. In fact, plan your vacations around it! With the album out this
fall, it's quite likely that there'll be an official _HG_-KBC convention
sometime around November, just like last time. Wouldn't it be _neat_
for a bunch of us American fans to go over there together?
     Anyway, it's fun to dream about these things.

-- Andrew Marvick
   P.S.: To end on an anti-clamactic note, the so-called "Abbey Road"
KT interview CD that IED described a month or so ago has now re-surfaced
on vinyl, as a 12" picture-disk. One side features a 1985 publicity shot
(often seen) of Kate in pink; the other is a nice twist on the _TKI_
official picture-disk. It's a photo of Kate in the green body-suit from
that disk, getting out of a chromium cylinder, but the shot is not
exactly the same as the one from the official disk. The program is
exactly the same Tony Myatt interview (47 minutes long) as heard
at the Romford convention and on the CD.
     P.P.S.: The latest swapmeet rumor is that volumes two and three
of the _Cathy_Demos_ are already out, but no-one had seen them yet.
Also, they were actually pressed up right here in SoCal, someplace
in the Simi Valley. Also, the 22-song tape that IED got came indirectly
from a collector in Florida. How he got it IED doesn't know.
