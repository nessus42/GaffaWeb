OTHER USES OF ULYSSES 

        There is a general Joycean feel to Kate's work, both in its 
Irishness and in the overall level of its detail and the richness and 
diversity of its reference. However, the only certain Joycean reference 
in Kate's work is the song "My Lagan Love". A more dubious one is 
Stephen's reference to "every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from 
farther out, waves and waves" in the third chapter (Penguin p.38 line 
40).  Kate and Joyce might simply be independently aware of the same 
bit of folk wisdom however.  Also, Kate has specically said she got the 
title from the quote on the back of "Hounds of Love."
        Another unlikely influence on Kate's work from Ulysses is "all 
the amount of pleasure they get off _a_womans_body_ were so round and 
white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change"  [Penguin 
ed. page 638 lines 41-2.], which is simular to "I'd make a deal with 
god and get him to swap our places" [RUTH]


        An edited version of the Ulysses passage, beginning with the 
line "I'd love to have the whole place swimming in roses" (642 line 42) 
 has been set to music (!) for soprano (!) solo and orchestra by 
Stephen Albert under the title of "Flower of the Mountain" (!). I have 
located the piano reduction of  Albert's score, which was published in 
1986 by Schirmer. It is orchestrated for 2 flutes (2nd doubling 
piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd doubling English horn), 2 A clarinets, 2 F 
horns, 2 Bb trumpets, percussion, piano, harp and strings. It runs 
about 16:00. It was first performed by Lucy Shelton at the Y in NYC, 17 
May 1986. I don't think it has been recorded.

        The recent film _James_Joyce's_Women_, which starred Fionula 
Flanagan as Molly Bloom, included a long soliloquy based on but also of 
course much different from the original in _Ulysses_. 
        The Firesign Theater used that same speech in the end of their 
album, "How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere 
At All?"? Of course, the effect is slightly *different*... the speaker 
is that perpetual flimflam artist cum used-car salesman, Ralph 
Spoilsport... I don't know if this one made it to CD, but it's 
definitely worth a listen.

        Rupert Croft-Cooke has a book entitled _The_Sensual_World_, but 
it's probably just a co-incidence.
