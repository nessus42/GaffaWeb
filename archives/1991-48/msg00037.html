Distributing Cloudbusting
-------------------------
        I'm thinking of trying some new ideas for getting Cloudbusting out to
as many people as possible with the least amount of effort and cost as
possible, as I am hoping to have it done within a month.  The main idea would
be to try to set up a "chain disk" situation, I would send out the disks to
one person (who would post it to the archives as I don't have net access),
then that person would be obligated to send it along to the next person ASAP. 
They would have to post a message saying they have the disks and that whoever
wants them should send them mail.  If nobody currently wants them, then they
would simply hold them until newer people join Gaffa and request them, (a note
could be put in the monthly post explaining the system).  There would need to
be TWO chains, as there will be at least two versions of Cloudbusting, text
and Wordperfect.  The disk format for both versions would be IBM 3 inch 720k
disks, as that is the most common format I am able to read/write.  
        So what I need is two people, one "text" and one "Wordperfect" to
volunteer to be first in the chain, these would obviously have to be people
who are able and willing to FTP the files to the archives.  Hopefully the
chain will at least be able to continue until the next Edition of Cloudbusting
comes out (after the next album?) 

        In addition, the Amiga version will (hopefully) be finished a month
after the other two versions.  So I'll need a volunteer for that, also.  I'd
also like to know - are there a large number of people out there who have the
Amiga AND the ability to FTP to and from it?  I'm trying to debate the merits
of posting the Amiga version to the net, if nobody with Amigas have net access
then I guess it wouldn't make much sense.  

        Also, Jorn has been too swamped to be able to mail out, electronicly,
Cloudbusting (text) to the people on the list he collected.  Is there any kind
sole who would be willing to do this?  I would be willing to chop it down into
&lt;100k size files, but I'm not able to do that kind of mailing here on my
connection.  The volunteer will receive the disks, which will be AUTOGRAPHED! 
:-)  (by me) 



        On a not-totally-unrelated-note.  Richard Caldwell, I understand (from
a conversation a few weeks ago) that Jorn only got ONE response from the
fanzines about the project, and I got only ONE response from them about
Cloudbusting.  Well, at least HOMEGROUND and Little Light like us.  :-)
