        WOOO!  39 New, good messages today, and good ones!  It's days like
these that makes the lean, flamy times, worth it. 

        Koodos to Vickie for her "Candle In The Wind" observations.  Her As I
was walking away from the screen after reading it (with CiTW playing in the
background) the part was she said "press" jumped out and grabbed me, and I
find it interesting that she holds on that word specifically.  Those who don't
like the song might try listening to emotion packed into that one word, and
may grow to like it more, as I have.  It's also interesting that Kate has
release a single where lonelyness is the main theme of both "sides", assuming,
of course, you accept IED's assertion that "Rocket Man" is a lonely version.  
It also may be relevant that in the song, the narrator is saying "goodbye" to
"Norma Jean", Marilyn's "real" name.  Perhaps this has meaning in that Kate
has said she changed her name (from Cathy) and life when she went on the road
to fame and stardom.  And/or there could be relevance to how Kate has said
lately that her life has once again gone through a major change. 

        I missed 120 Minutes last night (forgot, as I was too busy
Cloudbusting).  Would someone tell me they saw it, and they DIDN't show Rocket
Man.  :-) 

        Could someone tell me what the EXACT release date of the "Rocket Man"
single in Britain.  And also Scott said that it made #12 on the Gallop chart
and #8 on the Network chart.  Which is the _real_ chart, ie. the one most
people go by.  I'd *REALLY* need someone to answer these two questions as I
need the info for Cloudbusting. 

        Thanks to *ALL* the people who posted the transcriptions of the recent
interviews.  I cross-checked the three and fixed the *minor* errors to create
a hopefully clean transcription and have chopped it up and added it to
Cloudbusting Edition 2.  As I spent most of last night fixing errors I had
made in my transcriptions of interviews past, it was nice to see other people
make a few minor mistakes. :-) 

        ARG!  Just realized that I don't have any quotes for Candle In The
Wind.  Add one more to the list!  :-(

        It looks like Tom Richards is never going to give me the two
interviews he promised.  Does anybody have the promotion record for Lionheart
or the 1978 Trouser Press interview.  Thanks!
