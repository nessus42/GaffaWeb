&gt;"Don't drive too slowly."         Richard Caldwell

I'm considering moving the archives to another machine so that
I can have more stuff accessible, i'm just out of disk space there.

There *was* talk of such a thing on ecto - I forget exactly who
proposed it, a few people made comments, and *I* said (and it's what
really matters as I'm producing the newsletter - not that I don't take
pretty seriosuly the opinions and thoughts of the subscribers, but the
final decision *is* mine, and thus this ended the discussion) that:
While I don't mind and I _encourage_ discussion of other artists in
the ectozine, I don't feel we should have any part of it dedicated to
any other artist in specific. Ectozine is about happy rhodes and her
music, and any other discussion that her fans are interested in is
welcome, but i won't set aside a part for any other artist, not even
kate even if *every* ecto-person is also a kate fan (which already
happens not to be true). I suppose it is mainly because I feel it's
just not an appropriate forum - News Briefs from Love Hounds should be
sometihng on it's own, if it should be anything, or it should be
included in a Kate Bush newsletter/fanzine of some sort.


That's how i felt at the time, and it's how I still feel.
