Hi all!                                                                        
                                                                               
I went to Tower Records in Annapolis last Saturday and found a                 
copy of a video collection from Everything But The Girl.  It                   
contains (presumably) all of their videos from _Eden_ to                       
_worldwide_.                                                                   
                                                                               
I had never seen the duo except for their album covers and I was               
quite delighted to be able to see them in motion.  Tracey Thorn                
is an attractive girl IMHO, and I am glad she lost the buzz                    
haircut from the first one or two albums.  Ben Watt looks                      
relatively the same in all videos except for one where he chose                
to grow a goofy-looking (again, IMHO) goatee.                                  
                                                                               
My favorite videos are the ones from _Idlewild_ forward, with a                
particular favorite being "I Don't Want To Talk About It".  I                  
love the way it was filmed.                                                    
                                                                               
If anyone is at all interested in a listing of all clips on the                
tape, let me know and I will provide.                                          
                                                                               
Glad to see that Atlantic has enough faith in them to release a                
video collection.  Maybe they'll release EBTG's self-titled                    
album, _Love_Not_Money_ (with "Heaven Help Me" and "Kid"                       
included), and _Baby_The_Stars_Shine_Bright_ domestically on CD.               
Anyone know the feasibility of this?  The imports are quite                    
expensive and don't contain all tracks.                                        
                                                                               
                              Take care and enjoy the holidays                 
                                (however you may observe them)                 
                                     Jody Ferguson                             
                                                                               
                                                                               
P.S.  I got a Christmas postcard from Sara Hickman the other day.              
She is a great singer/songwriter from Dallas, and is one of the                
sweetest persons I've ever met.  If you haven't heard of her yet,              
you soon will.  She has two albums:  _Equal_Scary_People_ and                  
_Shortstop_.  She also appears on the _Rubaiyat_ compilation from              
Elektra, and the _Arachnophobia_ soundtrack.  I whole-heartedly                
recommend her.
