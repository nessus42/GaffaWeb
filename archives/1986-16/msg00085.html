&gt;Really-From: Susanne E Trowbridge
&gt;  &lt;ins_aset%jhunix.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU&gt;

&gt;J.D. has been on SST's mailing list from the very beginning.  In
&gt;fact, Husker Du's "Double Nickels On The Dime" was one of the very
&gt;first things he reviewed for the Post.

SUE SUE SUE, you really know how to show your incompetence. try the
Minutemen's  "Double Nickels on the Dime" and maybe Huskers "Zen Arcade".

and any critic who would compare Gone to Crimson is stupid as shit.
these bands are SOOO fucking different that it's amazing how he got the
comparison.

but then again, your still blowing bouncers and record company execs so
you can get all the wavo hip college music when it comes out so you can
be soo much more fuckin' hipper than the next person that it almost
makes me puke.  it would make me puke, but your not worth the time it
takes to puke.

&gt;Christ, Hofmann, first you whine that he doesn't review enough
&gt;progressive music, but when he does, you still find stuff to
&gt;complain about.

no, the dink is whining cause he wants to know why does every reviewer
for any big time rag always try to compare X to Y.  

And we know that JD would not have written that Gone review if the New
York Times did not write in the first place.  Sounds like JD just copies
from other people...

&gt;You may think you're cool, but some of us know better.

well, we know he's a dink, but at least he doesn't coddle to the fucking
people who think they are cool and hip and trendy and write for the city
paper or the washington yawn, and instead finds out about the REAL
underground music, and not the 'socially acceptable' underground.  

wait till the Reptile House lp comes out on Homestead, then you'll be
sucking dick to write about them....

call me MR. dickhead
