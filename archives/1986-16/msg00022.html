&gt;This is really a scream, Blore. You've been carrying on this argument
&gt;all this time, and not only do you not even own a copy of The Dreaming,
&gt;but you've only listened to it once? The Dreaming?! ONCE??
&gt;THE DREAMING???  O N C E ? ? ?  This conversation can serve no further
&gt;purpose.
 
  Actually, I've heard it three or four times, the most recent was about
six months ago, after I bought "Hounds of Love" and decided maybe it 
deserved another chance.  But that's neither here nor there.  Why shouldn't
I be able to make a judgment after hearing it once, or twice, or (in Doug's
case) half a dozen times?  I make decisions about music, books, movies, etc.
all the time, usually based on only one listening/reading/viewing/whatever.
Do I have to own a videocassette of "Runaway Train" and have watched it every
day for the past three months before I can voice my opinion?  No, I don't
think so, and I also don't think you can show that a record album is any
different from a movie in this regard.
  
  This, by the way, is exactly the reaction I expected.  How about responding
to the meat of my argument?
