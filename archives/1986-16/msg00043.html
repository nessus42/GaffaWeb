&gt;Having unfortunately found out about the Woodentops apparently just after the
&gt;Great Import Purge, the only thing by them I've been able to find is the
&gt;domestic Giant LP.  I will cheerfully go on record :-) as calling this one
&gt;of the best, possibly THE best album of the year (that I've heard).

Cheers for you, Peter.  I agree, it is THE best album of the year --
okay, I shouldn't use phrases like that, it's MY FAVORITE album of the
year.  Followed by Throwing Muses, Peter Gabriel, R.E.M., That Petrol
Emotion, Anna Domino, The Housemartins, James, and Red Lorry Yellow Lorry.

&gt;I hear of the existence of a U.S. compilation of their earlier stuff, called
&gt;"Well Well Well".  Haven't found it yet.  Is it easily available?

It's on a U.S. indie label, Upside, which means that you won't find it
in your local Sam Goody's or Record World (or your west coast equivalents).
However, it should be easy to order.  Just find a record store that
carries indie-label stuff -- there must be SOME out there -- if you
can't, please write to me and I'll get it for you here!!

&gt;(And what DOES the new 12" sound like?  I can't imagine Adrian Sherwood
&gt;producing them, after hearing what he did to Ministry.

Lots of percussion, slowed-down a bit, and very danceable.  It's not as
lighthearted as before, but I still think it's nifty.  Take that,
Hofboyy.

&gt;                        --Peter Alfke

&gt;  The other psuedo LP ("Straight Eight Bushwacker" in
&gt;the UK, and "WELL, WELL, WELL" in the US) was simply a compilation of their
&gt;singles and B-sides to that date.

Actually, "Straight Eight Bushwacker" is an import from the Netherlands.
Also, it's important to note that "Straight Eight" and "Well Well Well"
are far from complete compilations -- since there seems to be interest
in the W'tops I could post a discography.  However, I'll have to go home
and write down all the info so I can be as exacting as Greg.

&gt;Finally heard the "new" the The single a few days ago.  Heartbreak something
&gt;or other.  It sounds like Matt is taking a run at the charts himself.

"Infectious" is the newer The The single.  It's a little less "mersh."

&gt;I'll just wait for Hitchcock at the Paradise on 2 November...

I was late for history today because I was buying his new album.  It is
fab and cool.  Buy it, everybody.  A sure bet to be added to my "best-of"
list above.

&gt;Dave Juitt                 What's the matter, Eddie?

Hi, Dave!

Why don't any of my postings get into mod.music.gaffa?  Just wondering...
