&gt;Yawn.  This Hitchcok dude is perhaps the most overated piece of shit
&gt;to EVER come out of "left field".... Please, Mr. Immigration, take him
&gt;back to England where he can bore the welfare pricks to death...

Oh, shut up, Hofmann.  Shut up or I'll get somebody to tie you down and
make you listen to the Housemartins all day.

Okay, just ruin my day then -- I'm not going to be able to get to a
decent record store for another week or so!  Grr.

&gt;Subject: Yellow and Art of Noise

&gt;Are the bands "Yellow" (sp?) and "Art of Noise" the same band?  I
&gt;just heard Yellow on the radio ('FNX) and I would have sworn that
&gt;it was the AofN playing!

&gt;What gives here?

No, Yello and the Art of Noise are not the same band.  Yello are Swiss,
and they have released about five albums, of which "Claro Que Si" and
"You Gotta Say Yes To Another Excess" are my faves.  (I thought "Stella"
was a total bore.)  The Art of Noise used to be on the Zang Tumb Tuum
record label, they're British, and their latest record is "In Visible
Silence."  Max Headroom is featured on the "Paranoimia" single.  I
personally prefer their ZTT work, especially "Into Battle with the
Art of Noise."  Avoid the ten zillion remixes of "Beat Box."

&gt;Subject: New and/or Newly Discover (by me) Bands

&gt;  In order to distract myself from the Great "The Dreaming" Debate, I've
&gt;been listening to some of the following albums.  Info on origins, previous
&gt;work, etc. would be much appreciated:

&gt;   The Housemartins "London 0 Hull 4"

The Housemartins are a fun bunch of Marxist guys from Hull in Northern
England.  Their roots are in gospel and pop.  "London 0 Hull 4" is
their first LP, but they've released four EPs -- "Flag Day," "Sheep,"
"Happy Hour" and "Think For A Minute."  All have loads of extra tracks
and are well worth checking out, especially if you like the gospel
song on the album.  "Take Jesus -- Take Marx -- Take Hope."  Yeah,
right.  I like the music more than I like the message.

&gt;   Jane Siberrey (sp?) "The Speckless Sky"

Jane Siberry...hmm, imagine if Laurie Anderson had a pert and perky
younger sister.  She's Canadian, and has three albums -- don't know
what the first one's called, but #2 is "No Borders Here" and "The
Speckless Sky" is the third and latest.  Saw her live here in Baltimore
last May, on "Hands Across America" day.  Somehow, that seemed oddly
appropriate.

&gt;   While I'm at it, can anyone tell me which Smiths album has "Panic" on
&gt;it?

None!  It's only available on single.  Sire released it here in the US.
It's backed with "Vicar in a Tutu" and "The Draize Train" (an instrumental
on the 12" only).  Incidentally, the cosmetics test where they put
makeup and shampoo in rabbits' eyes to check for toxicity is called the
Draize test, so I assume there's some connection...Has anybody heard
the new Smiths 12"?  I wasn't a big fan of "Panic," so I passed it up.

&gt;Subject: Woodentops ----

&gt;For a GREAT review of the Woodentop's new LP, check out the latest Schpin
&gt;magazine.  Written by Byron Coley (ala Farced Exposure).

HAH!!!  This is perhaps the WORST record review I have EVER read.
It's not even a REVIEW.  It doesn't tell you ANYTHING about the album.
I think Spin SUCKS and I refuse to buy it...a friend of mine was reading
it and said, "oh-oh, you're not going to like this..."  And he was
RIGHT!!!!   Byron Coley is a f*cking ASSHOLE.  I would rather be
forced to stare at Rolling Stone's celebrity fashion spreads all day
than read Spin's miserable record review section.  Speaking of Stone,
their review of "Giant" was poorly written but at least it was an
actual REVIEW.  BOYCOTT SPIN!!!!!!!!!

&gt;Subject: Revised Tour dates for Skinny Puppy and Severed Heads

&gt;Be there or miss out, weenies

&gt;P.S. Sue, please try to confirm your rumors before you post innocuous one
&gt;line statements that scare the shit out of me.

Look, I'm sorry!  That's what I get for listening to the jerks at the
9:30 Club.  The guy who said it was cancelled was the same person who
refused to accept my college I.D. as a valid proof of age, which meant
I had to have a massive skull and crossbones stamped on my hand...
oh, the chagrin.  If I can talk somebody into giving me a ride to
D.C., I will be there, OK?

My parents were visiting last weekend and my dad put on my copy of
"Bites" because he thought Skinny Puppy was a "cute name."  (My dad's
favorite artists are along the lines of Linda Ronstadt and the Pet
Shop Boys.)  His verdict -- "Skinny Puppy sucks!"

By the way, did you hear that Laibach's next album will feature
cover versions of several Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond songs?

Yours for more mischief,
Sue
