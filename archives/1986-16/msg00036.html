Just a coupla corrections/refinements...
     Joe Turner mentioned that Shriekback were touring with Love and Rockets.
This is false, as far as I know.  Love and Rockets are touring with The Lucy
Show, and the Boston show with Shriekback is (I believe) a one-off.  Who
Shriekback is touring with (if anyone) I don't know, but I believe the
'Special Guests' at UMass are the Models (oh boy! -:)).
     Second, the new Woodentops LP was produced by Bob Seargent (sp?).  The
only single by them so far that was produced by Adrian Sherwood was the new
one.  Their other singles have been produced by Animal Jesus (Andy Partridge)
and Swami Ananda Nagara (John Leckie).  When people talk about the softeniing
of the band's sound on the new LP, I think it is important to note that it
is their first real LP.  The other psuedo LP ("Straight Eight Bushwacker" in
the UK, and "WELL, WELL, WELL" in the US) was simply a compilation of their
singles and B-sides to that date.  I think part of the unity of sound on
"Giant" comes from being recorded (more or less) at the same time and having
only one producer.  The eclectic line-up of the first LP is probably
more a function of being a compilation of disparate singles with different
producers and some experimental B-sides than an indication that the band
have significantly softened or compromised their sound for "Giant".  I take
the new LP as an indication of what they think a Woodentops LP should sound
like.  It flows well and (in my mind at least) forms a pretty cohesive whole
with no particularly weak songs.  I like it.  I also like all of the singles
and the B-sides, which show the more adventurous side of the band.

     In short, although I would have liked to hear a "Plutonium Rock" or a
"Why?" or a "Steady, Steady" on "Giant", they would have significantly broken
the 'feel' of the LP, which someone obviously thought was important.  I like
"Giant" alot, but I'll keep buying the singles as well for the B-sides...
