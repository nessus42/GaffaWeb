&lt; Richard van Hoesal's long posting on all kinds of stuff &gt;

Re: Laibach
Nova Akropola is a really gripping album, tho John Hogge said it's
pretty similar to the live album. How about a review of the 12", John?

Re: Melbourne underground
I'm interested in hearing industrial/noize/post-punk/hardcore stuff from
anywhere. Where do I send money, etc.?

You want reviews? You got them...

(Warning: these aren't very new! I haven't seen them discussed here tho.)


EXECUTIVE SLACKS '85 LP (cover with guys flailing around in saran wrap)
Greg Earle keeps raving about these guys so I checked this out at the library.
Guitar noise with drum machines (or monotonous drumming), kind of a relaxed
dancey Big Black. First few tracks were really boring, then there was this
acoustic guitar track (I'm not kidding) then they kick into "The Park". Yow!
Everything else is hot.

BOURBONESE QUALK 	THE SPIKE
Old Cabaret Voltaire fans who are mourning their demise (musically) can 
rejoice: the spirit of the old Cab Volt has been reincarnated in Bourbonese
Qualk. Superb rhythmic noise; they work with the same kind of material as
Hula and add their own flavor to it.

HAPPY FLOWERS		two 7"s
Write Hofboyy for his interview with these guys. Guitar noise and massive
feedback accompany songs about all the things that can go wrong when 
you're a kid. Example titles: "All my toys hate me", "The vacuum cleaner
ate Timmy", "All I got for Christmas were clothes" (on the God's Favorite
Dog compilation.) Hilarious, but the music is pretty relentless feedback
attack and not for the faint hearted. I was waiting for Hof to rave about
them since I got the scoop from him, but looks like he's too busy or sth...

NO TREND	TEEN LOVE 12"
Another oldie. When I first picked this up I was going "where have these
guys been all my life?" Superb deranged post-punk with very varied sound
and good, ummm, "post-modern" lyrics. So began my quest for more No Trend...

NO TREND	YOUR LOVE 10" with Lydia Lunch
Actually I've already No Trend before getting Teen Love, thanks to Doug...
Lydia Lunch doesn't really make such a strong impression here. The title
song is great, but the rest is not terribly outstanding. 

NO TREND	THE BEAUTY OF DEATH
The nadir. The best songs on this are already on the 10". The trademark
growling vocals with tasty guitar is still here, but again something is
missing. So what other No Trend things should I try?
