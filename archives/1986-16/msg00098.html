This is my second attempt at posting this...I sent it off nearly a
week ago, and I never saw it on love-hounds, so I thought I'd try
again.  If this is the second times you see this, a thousand pardons.

&gt;     I just saw the Woodentops live last night (Paradise theatre, 10/29/86)
&gt;and they were fantastic!  They were tight, energetic, showed and incredible
&gt;range of styles, and left me quite impressed.

Hmm, just my luck -- their biggest fan ends up seeing them on the night
they had the flu!  Foo.

&gt;GENERAL QUERY :
&gt;     1. the new THE THE album - is it out yet ?

No.

&gt;From: Greg Ward &lt;gtward%wateng.waterloo.edu@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA&gt;
&gt;Subject: Info wanted on groups/Bill Nelson

&gt;Can anyone give me information on the following groups? Discography, history,
&gt;members, etc. would be nice.

&gt;    A Certain Ratio

A Certain Ratio is a very cool band.  I saw them opening for New Order,
too.  I have loads of records by ACR (as they prefer to be called now)
but not the complete collection, so I couldn't post a thorough
discography, but I could recommend some.

Their early records are much more experimental and less "funky" than
their later stuff.  They became a heavy funk band when Simon Topping
(the horn player) left.  Recommended:

"Flight" b/w "Blown Away" and "And Then Again" 12" (with Topping)
"To Each..." LP (with Topping)
"Sextet" LP
"I Need Someone Tonight" 12"
"Wild Party" 12"
"Life's A Scream" 12" (my fave)
"Brasilia" 12"

They just released a new 12" called "Mickey Way," but it's something
you can live without.  Buy "Life's A Scream" instead.  Oh yes, all of
the above are on Factory records.  And make sure you avoid "I'd Like
To See You Again," which is hopelessly lame.

&gt;Subject: Re: Skinny Puppy/Severed Heads Tour Cancelled?  Wot?

&gt;Sue, where DID you get this idea that it was cancelled??
&gt;Inquiring minds wanna know ...

Calm down Greg.  I just found out yesterday that the concert was
not cancelled, it was simply MOVED from the 9:30 to the Roxy.  Not
too surprising.  Bands do not seem to like playing the 9:30.  (Enter
name-dropping mode) Mark E. Smith of the Fall told me he never wants
to play there again.  Bad management etc.

&gt;Woodentopzzzzzzzz?

&gt;&gt;Followed by Throwing Muses, Peter Gabriel, R.E.M., That Petrol
&gt;&gt;Emotion, Anna Domino, The Housemartins, James, and Red Lorry Yellow Lorry.
&gt;Hey, I still say `The Unacceptable Face Of Freedom' and `Atomizer' shreds
&gt;over all of `em ... oops!  where DID I put that Tao ... :-)

I lived for nearly a year with a guy whose favorite bands were Mark
Stewart and the Maffia, Skinny Puppy, early Cabaret Voltaire, Laibach,
Current 93, Whitehouse, Test Dept, Einsturzende, etc.  If there's one
thing I learned from it, it's that I like WIMPY POP GUITAR MUSIC AND I'M
PROUD OF IT!!!!!  (sorry, I'll calm down now.)   So at least you can't
say I haven't given these bands a chance, because I have.  Boy, have I
ever.  "To thine own self be true."  Just because I prefer WPGM doesn't
mean that I don't trot out my Severed Heads and CabVolt records from
time to time, though...by the way, if that other Greg (gtaylor) is out
there, I bought "Mystere des Voix Bulgares" on your recommendation, and
I love it.  Bulgarian folk music is in!!!
