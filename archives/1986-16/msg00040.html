<PRE>
I saw the Woodentops last night at the Paradise in Boston, and I would say
that they got over their flu cases they apparently had last week.  It was
really a great show, despite a slow start because of a poor sound mix.
Now, Hoffman says that "they ARE primarily a studio band," but I know that
I will have a hard time listening to my "Giant" cd after last night.  It
just doesn't have the same enegry level and intensity that they have live.

Sue, I feel they really deserve the raving you gave them before you saw
their concert last week, if it's any consolation.  It was your postings
about them that made me decide to buy "Giant" and to go see them last night
(plus hearing "Get it On" and "Good Thing" on the radio).  And I'm glad I
did!  I must admit a was a bit apprehensive after you were disappointed
with their concert in DC.

I did get annoyed at all the people who seemed to think that they were at a
cocktail party or something.  I could hardly hear the band during quiet
parts of songs because the crowd noise level was so high.  All those people
left before the encore, fortunately.

If anybody has a chance to see them, and you're wondering if you should,
stop wondering, and just go.  It should be worth it.

			    - Nancy

p.s.  is the pretty/interesting song by the Throwing Muses that gets
frequent airplay on WFNX typical of the rest of their work?  (no, I don't
know the name of the song.)
