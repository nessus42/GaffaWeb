Yes, he was here. I interviewed him for an upcoming piece in OPtion,
which I'll probably post here if interest warrants. Tried to be
a good guy by pissainting his gear up. Nice guy, knows his equipment
well (no surprises except that he was so concerned with avoiding the
mystification side of things and emphasizing the work itself. I use
almost exactly the same gear on those rare occasions I perform live,
though our work is uh....*quite* different), knows how to pitch stuff
to his audience (opened for 54-40, and so concentrated to his "songs".
Predictably, I preferred "big industry"...which was marvelous). He's
definitely a "must see" if only for his stubborn insistence on taking
Art techniques and traditions out to the clubs and winning the territory
back.

P.S. 54 40 was 54 40. Lots of gear. Played boogie for the soundcheck,
had a PA effects rack I couldn't believe, etc. They were okay-sorta 
the usual jangly garage band Orthodoxy with a little Michael Stipe
fulcrum twist on the vocals. The crowd was dressed just like the band.
O'Cayz is a great place to hear bands, though. Just wish there was a
little more Miller out there.
