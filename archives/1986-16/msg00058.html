Wow.


That's the one word review, just "Wow".  We stood there and listened to 
Robyn and Andy and Morris for close to an hour and a half, and all I can say
is wow!  A coupla comments off the top of my skull:


- He didn't feel like talking to the audience.  Made a point of not explaining
  the songs or doing any kind of witty intros.  We didn't care.

- Hitchcock is a much better guitarist than comes across on vinyl.

- Elements of Light could be Hitchcock's best shot at a 'mershally successful
  album.  Haven't heard the studio cuts yet, but if they sound like the versions
  he played last night, with the guitar breaks and rock solid percussion, then, 
  oh well, I guess he deserves a hit.

- The Egyptians "played" the song that I LEAST expected to hear. 
  It was worth the price of admission just to hear, well I wouldn't want
  to spoil it for you.  Go see it for yourself. (Hint, it's off *IODoT*)

- Peter Buck joined 'em on stage for the last two songs (Heaven and some paisley
  classic) and proceeded to completely embarrass himself.  It was evident how
  creative Robyn can be with his arrangements.  Buck did all he could do to keep
  up, but he was spending all his time trying to watch Hitchcock's fretboard to 
  figure out where he was going.  Pretty sad Pete, looked liked you had never 
  sat in on a jam with anybody before.

- Didn't do "Glass".  Did do "Man With the Lightbulb Head"

- He hushed the entire crowd as he stood under a lone spot and played
  "I Often Dream of Trains".  Every time I listen to this song, from now on,
  I'll remember the look and the tear is his eye.  Wow.


Next up, Iggy @ Metro - 11 Nov.  On deck, Peter Murphy @ Paradise - 19 Nov.
