* Neu!

I don't think you need cannabis to enjoy Neu.  I heard some of their stuff
about three or four years ago and have been scouring the record stores for
it ever since.  A month ago, in London, I finally picked up a Neu
compilation (didn't they put out just two albums ?) called _Black Forest
Gateau_ on the British Cherry Red label -- the date of issue was 1981.
There's a blurb on the back about the group's history, including the link to
early Kraftwerk.

Neu!'s music could be called ``spacy,'' but it's very basic.  Simple synth
and guitar lines waft over a steady rhythm section (the kind you hear on a
lot of Conny Plank productions).  Sometimes there are other noises like a
really pumped wah-pedal (on _Hallogallo_) or tortured, distorted guitar
chords routed through equally tortured mechanical reverb (_Negativland_).
So call it Teutonic groove.

* Woodentops

Umm, I *like* the new 12" (Everyday Living/Why).  I haven't heard the new
album, but trusted sources say that they've lessened their attack and become
more ``accessible.''  Sounds like what XTC did on Black Sea, though XTC's
compromises still rule over any AOR/progressive/CHR and quite a bit of the
gnarly.  You've got to wonder, though, why this sort of thing happens:

* Insecurity: Group likes the idea of fun pop but feels they've too far out
  there to reach their intended audience.

* Big Bad Record Company: Rough Trade ??  CBS yes, but I don't think the
  Woodentops are that high up their list...

* Change: Maybe they want to sound that way.  It happens, y'know.

I don't think Sherwood produced the album.  He did remix the 12" A-side.
