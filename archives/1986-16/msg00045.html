<PRE>
	Way back when ...
	pre 1972: single(s?) released.. forgotten the names, but redone
		  on I think  "NEU 2" (second albumn .. you guessed it)
	1972: (from memory.. )first albumn released: "HALLOGALLO"..
		  .. included fantastic heavy synth/rock/spacey/industrial
		  track called "Negativeland".. check the heavy drilling
		  sounds at the intro.. when "EISTURZENDE.." were still shaking
		  rattlers.
	1973: Second Albumn : "NEU 2".. this time very much working with 
		  recordings reused at various speeds and the like..
		  interesting, but perhaps a little "overdone(?)"...
		  side 1 starting to sound very much like LA DUSSELDORF.
	****: I know of at least one other self titled albumn which a friend
		  owns (I've got the above two..), and I do seem to recall
		  "NEU 75" from somewhere.

	( all of course in association with Conny Planck.. )

	Rother/Dinger also ~'73 started up a concurrent project under the 
	name LA DUSSELDORF. The albumn "VIVA" is an absolute must if your 
	at all into the (now almost extinct) big german "synth" sound.
	..Quick to add, not to be confused with the sort of melancholic 
	boredom that KLAUS SHULZE has been giga-overated for...
	Side two of VIVA has a great "classical/repetitive" track called
	"CHA-CHA 2000". I'm fairly sure nothing NEUw has been done under the 
	psychonim "NEU" since the mid seventies though. Later collections
	of german musics (BLACK GAT., HARMONIA etc.) were from memory just
	revamps as far as NEU is concerned. 
	... "but baby that was years ago.."

----&gt;&gt;  Can anyone chez la U.K. let me know about some of the latest Noize
	out dere. Recent "have heards/boughts" on my behalf have included -
	LAIBACH : live recordings (tape only) from Amsterdam &amp; Den Haag
		  .. I thought better than the "EUROPE '85" live albumn
		  but poor quality.. ach well. Neither are as good of 
		  course as the "NOVA AKROPOLA" albumn.. easily my favourite
		  recent "industrial" aquisit.( PANORAMA.. what a track! ..
		  warning:"poppiest" track on the albumn though -also on 12" )

	SOVIET FRANCE : latest album.. perhaps a little too clean, but makes 
		  good use of vocal noises.. I'll give it a few more listens
		  first. Again fairly non-invasive ambient stuff. Packaging
		  not quite as contraversial as previous 4.(hession bags etc.)

	SHRIEKBACK : "Big Night Music"... pretty lame compared with previous
		  albumns.. definately playing it safe with this one I think.
		  Very much for general consumption.. (speaking of which..
		  some of you guys ought take it easy on this KB stuff.. you'll
		  get warts on your hands... must say I do own (and like) TD &amp;
		  HoL )
		  ( SB = great live act still though..
		    they were in Melbourne about 1.5 months ago )

	DIAMANDA GALAS : about half of the albumn I picked up is really wet.
		  (forgotten the name just now/'ts got a picture of her on
		  the front cover with mega trashy make-up ).
		  The other half is pretty good .
		  Doesn't compare with current .93 " a visit to dogland"
		  for scaries though...

	... there's more but some other time_ besides none of the above is
	brand-spanking.

----&gt;&gt;  anyone anywhere (US?)..
----&gt;&gt;  I'ld really appreciate it if anyone can get me a discography/info
	on early PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC stuff too.

----&gt;&gt;  I've heard the latest YELLO single - not bad ( of course ),
	anyone know about a new albumn pending/released ?

-----&gt;&gt; Can someone tell me about Kraftwerk (in)-activity post
	"Tour de France".. just this deadly silence down here.

----&gt;&gt;  Anyone interested in the "Melbourne Undergrond" (?) sounds..
	especially more noize/indstrl. orientated let me know.
	I'm trying to look for some O.S. outlets for a tape. ( Probably
	won't do more than about 100 copies.. ).

-----&gt;&gt; Gimme Reviews/Reviews/Reviews...

	"This is serious mum."
	( a local DEATHPOP act with great lyrics.. )

	BORENGAJULI is coming,
	soon to a town nere you... 
	... where there's POVERTY,
	    there's PRIVELEDGE, and a KILLING in the jungle.
