Hmmm... haven't met many of those lately.  Let's see ... I was about
17 or so when I got the "My Aim is True" album by Elvis (mainly based
on the hype in Rolling Stone) and yes, Bob, he did have an "Aim" towards
"changing" pop music... he felt that rock songs had gotten too long
and with the exception of "Watching the Detectives" almost all the 
songs on "Aim" are quite short compared to the other popular albums
of the period.  I'm sure he had other ideas about pop music that he's
incorporated into the mainstream (along with his other contempos like
Nick Lowe et al.) that have been picked up by groups like the English
Beat and XTC who have passed them on to the current crop of English
popsters (the "innocents" as the Ameropress is dubbing the Woodentops,
We've Got a Fuzz Box and Easterhouse).  But, gee, Bob - personally, 
I've felt since Armed Forces that Elvis has been one BIG YAWNER and
a pretty cheezy yawner at that.  But, sure, I still "clunk on
the first three albums of his to impress my friends (what friends?)"
at oppurtune moments.  Ha ha.  I also have a bootleg from the "This
Year's Model" tour that rips. (King Bisquit Flower Hour I believe).
Despite critical raves (they also rave about ((((yyyyyaawnnn)))) Paul
Simon), I find mr. McManus exTREMELy boring and would prefer 24
continous hours of the Butthole Surfers to his whiny, retread tunes.

Sorry, guess I'm not a cool Dave Marshite Pop Theorist like you.  Oooh,
oooh, gotta go impress my "friends" now...  tim, you out there?  Doug?
Bill?  You guys iMPRESSED?  Hmm???  How about my 14 year old friends who
buy Anti Scrunti Faction records (ooh, they're so mainstream) and such.
You guys impressed???  Hey, watch it!  No, stop!  Damn... run over by
a skateboard again.  Couldn't you guys have waited until I threw my Smiths 
album out? aaaahhh....

(Anyone ever heard of Alien Farm from Moscow Idaho?  I gotta review
one of their tapes and would appreciate any input...  Same for a
industro/kitchen group called Choda...)
