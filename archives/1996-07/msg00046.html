Hi!

Bryan wrote about Wieland's Phoenix:
&gt; May I congratulate you for your outstanding effort at going
&gt; through the facts and fictions about the events, sources, and
&gt; everything else to do with the Kate Demos. I think the title
&gt; Phoenix has some excellent dual meanings, although hopefully
&gt; nothing had to be burned, just reborn.

Seconded.

&gt; You'll have to help me on PDFM, I'm fully ready to kick myself, etc.

Peter D. Fitzgerald-Morris, of Homeground fame.

&gt; By the way, my Home Demos CD has an interesting "bug".
&gt; Generally, my CD player can display track duration time played,
&gt; left, total CD time played and left. BUT when I get to track 25
&gt; and above, ie the studio outake demo tracks, no longer will it
&gt; show the individual track countdown time, only a total remaining,
&gt; as if somehow these are related, which of course they are.
&gt; Does this signify anything? Only perhaps the 5 tracks on this CD
&gt; were put on this CD from a different source, but no surprise there.

Nope, that's a limitation most CD players have somehow. Their memory
to store stuff in RAM is limited, and just very few CDs have more
than about 20 tracks. You should be able to see this phenomenon
with other CDs with that many tracks.

&gt; Personally, even though the FAQ is exceeding 100k, I think this title
&gt; mapping should be included, we'll then all have some common ground.

This is what's already in there, I guess it's what you mean...

     The Cathy Demos (23 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan)
        Twelve of these are demos of songs that later appeared on albums,
        They are available on various bootlegs.  (Anybody have an early 80's
        album called THE EARLY YEARS?).
        Tracks (compiled from various boots - none contains all.  The names
        are not officially known, so there are some songs with more than one
        name.  Some names are from a radio broadcast in Arizona [KLN], the
        matching was done by [AR]): The Kick Inside (Brother) [note subtitle],
        Hammer Horror, It Hurts Me (A Rose Growing Old, Feeling Like A Waltz),
        Keep(ing) Me Waiting (Stranded at the Moonbase), Davy (While Davy
        Dozed), Disbelieving Angel, Moving, Kashka From Baghdad, Surrender Into
        the Roses (Coming Up, Carmilla), Oh To Be In Love, Rinfi the Gypsy
        (Playing Canasta (in cold rooms)), On Fire Inside a Snowball (Snow, Hot
        in the Ice), Dali (Ferry Me Over), Where are the Lionhearts
        (Lionhearts, On the Rocks) [NOT Oh England My Lionheart], Violin, The
        Craft Of Love, The Gay Farewell (Queen Eddie), Something Like a Song
        (In My Garden), Frightened Eyes, Never The Less (You'll Do), Come
        Closer To Me Babe (Goodnight Baby), So Soft, Rare Flower (I Don't See
        Why I Shouldn't (Pick the Rare Flower), Organic Acid

     The Studio Demos (7 songs, 1977?, often listed along with The Cathy Demos)
        Most of the times these share the space on CDs, LPs, singles or tapes
        with The Cathy Demos, the biggest distinction is that the studio demos
        were done together with the KT Bush Band instead of Kate alone at her
        piano.  (Babooshka differs in style and might have been recorded at
        Dave Gilmor's studio, some comments on various bootlegs about the
        second version suggest this)
        Tracks (same comments about the names as above): Don't Push Your Foot
        On The Heartbrake, Kite, L'Amour Looks Something Like You, Strange
        Phenomena, Scares Me Silly (Really Gets Me Going), Babooshka
        (2 versions),
        There have been rumors about a 'new' old Kate song called Turkish
        Delight.  Unfortunately the song is not from Kate, but rather from
        the Japanese group Sandii and the Sunsetz [VM, WW, Homeground #32].

Bye,

Uli
