this was written by a friend of mine who would be counted amongst the
torifans when KaTe comes to judge us in Her glory. he asked me to send
it along to love-hounds. i think it is an interesting, if blasphemous,
opinion. ;) ;) ;)

&gt;From: dgk@genie.com
&gt;Subject: The Dreaming
&gt;
&gt;Always willing to entertain the possibility of changing my mind, I dragged out
&gt;Tom Weber's copy of =The Dreaming= today and played it. Latest verse the same
&gt;as the first. I find the album overdense, airless, brittle, antsy, and cold.
&gt;Brilliantly composed and constructed, perhaps, but very artificial. And if
&gt;Tori Amos released an album =entirely= consisting of songs like the studio
&gt;version of "Little Earthquakes" (which I never listen to; the piano-only live
&gt;version is a pinnacle of her work), or "God," or "Caught a Lite Sneeze," I
&gt;wouldn't like it, either.
&gt;
&gt;Tori Amos has made a series of ballads that are her equivalent to "The Man
&gt;with the Child in his Eyes" a cornerstone of her career (culminating so far
&gt;with "Hey Jupiter"). Kate Bush has never written its like again. (It's true
&gt;that "Night of the Swallow," and "All of the Love," and "Houdini," touch on
&gt;that mode; but none of them will =sit still=, and the album is three-quarters
&gt;over by that point anyway.)
&gt;And as I said in a review of piano-rockers Ben Folds Five (who are excellent
&gt;but not the least to my taste), if Tori Amos released an album =entirely=
&gt;consisting of songs like "Leather," and "Happy Phantom," and "The Wrong Band,"
&gt;and "Mr. Zebra," I wouldn't like =that= either.
&gt;One of the many things I like about Tori Amos is the variety of styles at her
&gt;command.
&gt;
&gt;And didn't she act with perfect decorum on the Regis and Kathie Lee show this
&gt;morning....
