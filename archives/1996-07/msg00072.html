&gt;I think Tori's music is OK, but not a patch on that flame.

Wimp!  Get out that nozzle and ignite it!  This flame
war is to the DEATH!  To the DEATH!

[Norman Buchwald]

&gt;"Putting The Damage On," forgettable?  Listen to it again.  

NEVER!  DULL! DULL! DULL!  SELF-OBSESSED WHINING!

&gt;Thanks to Regis's obsession with his hand stitches, there wasn't 
&gt;time for Tori but to sing only the chorus of the song once.  

Regis is a smart host.  He knows when enough is too much!

&gt;As for her posture, where does that judgement come from? 

&gt;From my chiropodist!!

&gt;I can't help but think Of MMe Reisz in Kate Chopin's "Awakening," the 
&gt;brilliant pianist who always played so well because of her awkward posture.

FICTION!!!  BAH! WE ARE A REAL RELIGION HERE!

&gt;The song's not a happy song so why would she smile? 
 
So we can see her fangs!  DOG! DOG! DOG!

&gt;And how would you like it if someone dismissed Kate's 
&gt;performance just because of a "dent"?

I'D NUKE 'EM!

&gt;I think Mozart would've dropped out of a school with such rigidity,
&gt;too.  :)

THE SMILEY DOESN'T FOOL ME!  YOU AREN'T OF THE_BODY!!!
GUARDS! GUARDS!

&gt;I've heard more whining about Tori's supposed "mediocrity" on this ng
&gt;recently.  :)

BECAUSE SHE IS!!!  PATHETIC LITTLE FAT FACE WITH CROOKED
TEETH AND FRECKLES!!!

&gt;&gt;A great success for those who think Kurt Cobain was a poet and his
&gt;&gt;widow is a musician.

&gt;He contributed some important sounds as a musician that has now been
&gt;copied to death.  

He was a poser!  A copycat and a deluded addict!  A wimp who couldn't
cope with being rich, famous and undeserving, the primary
requisites for rock stars in this age of recycled banality!!!

&gt;Courtney Love . . .Well you can be big when you're a "Professional 
&gt;Widow," I guess.  :)

SMILEY! SMILEY!  At least Courtney knows how to make a dishonest
buck and keeps her needles clean!  AND SHE SWINGS A MEAN RIGHT
HOOK!  Yeah!!! My kinda merry widow!

&gt;Huh?  A different female artist with a similar voice is what appeals
&gt;her to Lovehounds, I guess. 

HERETIC!!!!  YOU HAVE TO GUESS????

&gt; And Kate has attributes that make Toriphiles love her. 

As well they should... and on bended knee!  No sloppy seconds!!!

&gt;I don't really flame as play around.  But I don't see what's the
&gt;necessity of placing Kate and Tori on a hierarchal plane.  

You left out a CHI!  POSER! POSER!

Choose One:

1.  It gives us a reason to live.

2.  Because my life is lackluster and I suffer from arrested
development.

3.  Because somebody wins and somebody loses.  That's
life!  Get over it!

4.  Because art is a tree and somebody has got to leaf!

5.  Because it beats working!

[woj]

&gt;actually, stev0 and i were bemoaning (off-list) the lackluster KaTori
&gt;flammage. even the meaning of gaffa debates are more interesting than
&gt;this.

Get to your posts then, you nude poultry parts!

Take up arms!  Take up collections!  Take up knitting!
