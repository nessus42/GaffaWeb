Thanks Wieland "what a challange"!
But I feel I'm not the "master of the lyrics", I think Kate
is that, I just want to be as accurate as what we hear!

This one requires some discussion:

&gt; "Oh, little thing, are you looking lost?"
&gt; The vertigo, the need to lose."

This sounds mostly correct to, "a birdy" does not fit the scared concept,
whereas vertigo fits the tingly in the stomach feeling of nervousness.

&gt; They try to trip me up, the tapes begin to spin.
&gt; I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in.

I agree so far, but as you say VERY DIFFICULT to hear.

The next line, a choice:
&gt; I try to put it all in, do it for you
&gt; I try to put it on it, do it for you
&gt; I try to put it all into it for you
I go for #3, but they all sound like it, they all make sense.
This one has more changce of someone *really* having the lyrics
since it was studio produced. Perhaps we could wangle this one
out of Kate, perhaps via KBC, it IS a particularly good catchy
track too.

OK Next verse:
&gt; Swimming amid the cans,
Well I hear "Singing", but again not clear enough!

Then later, more choice:
&gt; It's like a music balance
&gt; It's like a film - such balance/colours
&gt; I always hear: It's like a moon sex balance.  :-) Wie.
So we seems to agree (mostly) on Balance.
I definately hear "film", and couln't "sex" be "such"? ie:
	It's like a film - such balance
it seems to make sense, you wouldn't say music is like music,
as an analogy, they're the same thing.

Now:
&gt; I close my eyes to the cello solo,  [? more like "our" ?]
&gt; And make the [?] music.          &lt;---- VERY VERY, VERY, VERY DIFFICULT!!
Well I hear no "our" words, and I think "the" is very clear.
If it was one word for "make the", I be happy to enterain that idea,
since it makes the next line so much more sense:
&gt; will never let me blow away.
but I hear:
	Won't ever let me go away.
again, a VERY DIFFICULT one!

Last "chorus" now:
&gt; It's recording your representative
but Scott does hear "sentative", so do I.
I suggest:
	It's recording you, they're so sensitive,
I'm assuming the two parts are just repeats, and so then next line:
	Oozing without me, filling over with secrets.
fits bother versions quite well, although "filling" could be either
"brimming" or "spilling". The first time through "secrets" does not
sound quite right, perhaps the two are different! I'm sticking with
what I have above, but I can change on "filling".

This is a HARD one to get just right, I still think this one has
the most chance of getting the real lyrics for.
