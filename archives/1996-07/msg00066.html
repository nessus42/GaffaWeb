THE LATEST NEWS

Last week Congress approved sweeping restrictions on online speech and
conduct, imposing fines of $250,000 and jail sentences of 2 years for
anyone who makes "indecent" material available in a public forum online.

This legislation threatens the very existence of the Internet as a viable
means of free expression, education, and political discourse.

Despite loud objections from civil liberties groups and the public,
the measure is part of a massive telecommunications bill that President
Clinton has already pledged to sign.  Although you should feel free to
continue to express your objections directly to the President, there are
other ways to express our outrage for this legislation.  The President
is expected to sign this bill into law during the week of Feb 5-9, 1996.

For 48 hours after Clinton signs the Telecommunications Reform bill into law,
join hundreds of thousands of Internet users everywhere to show the far
reaching impact this bill will have on all Internet users.  TURN YOUR
WORLD WIDE WEB PAGES BLACK with white lettering to demonstrate that the
Internet will not accept this kind of second class treatment from the
United States Government.

________________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

1. For 48 hours after Clinton signs the net censorship language in the
   Telecomm bill into law, TURN YOUR WORLD WIDE WEB PAGES BLACK with
   white lettering.  To know when the bill is signed, check these
   sources:

        Newsgroups: alt.society.civil-disob
        Email:vtw-announce@vtw.org (watch for mail on this list)
        WWW:<A  HREF="http://www.vtw.org/">http://www.vtw.org/</A>
        Finger:vtw@panix.com

   You can also just watch CNN; they'll announce the signing of the bill.

   To turn your pages black with white lettering, simply add the following
   tag to your World Wide Web pages:

        &lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#FFFFFF"&gt;

   Put this right after your &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags, and before any &lt;/body&gt; tags.
   To explain to people who may be confused by the color change, temporarily
   add the following link to your page:

        &lt;a href="<A  HREF="http://www.vtw.org/speech/">http://www.vtw.org/speech/</A>"&gt;My World Wide Web Pages are
                black for 48 hours to protest second-class treatment from the
                US Government for free speech.  Read about it at this WWW
                page.&lt;/a&gt;

   The Center for Democracy and Technology has also agreed to mirror a
   similar page at URL:<A  HREF="http://www.cdt.org/speech.html">http://www.cdt.org/speech.html</A>

   If your pages get lots of hits from services that cache their pages like
   America  Online, you may wish to start turning your pages black early.
   Please try and wait though until Clinton signs the bill, for maximum
   effect.

   Also, urge your Internet Provider and any Internet WWW pages you
   frequent to turn their pages black.  Send us interesting sites that
   comply to vtw@vtw.org.

        $ Mail vtw@vtw.org
        Subject: ZTV.COM is turning their pages black!

        I'm the head of the ZTV Website and I've decided to turn our
        pages black.  Thought you'd like to know.

        ^D
        Mail sent!

2. Don't forget to send Clinton a message, contact him at:

        Email:president@whitehouse.gov
        Telephone:202-456-1111
        Fax:202-456-2461


   Sample communique:

        &lt;ring ring&gt;
        You're about to sign a bill into law that imposes a terrible
        set of speech restrictions on the Internet that belong in the
        broadcast medium, not the interactive one.

        I'm turning my World Wide Web pages BLACK for 48 hours after you
        sign the bill as a symbol of protest to show how many people will
        be affected by this bill.

   It is unlikely that he will veto the bill.

3. Make a commitment become involved!  There will be several court cases
   coming up to challenge the Internet censorship legislation, as well as
   an election that will put every single member of the House, and 1/3rd
   of the Senate (most of whom voted for this legislation) onto the ballot.

   Don't let them get away with this.  Make this a campaign issue, and
   keep an eye out for legal defense funds for those challenging these
   laws in court.
