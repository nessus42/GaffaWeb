Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1994/04/24
Version: 1.0.l minus 1.0.j

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action. You can get a full copy of the
FAQ by requesting it from me (uli@zoodle.robin.de). If you subscribe to
the list Bill Wisner will also provide you with the full FAQ.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------
[head of body:]

Newer versions (in decreasing order) can be obtaine from me
(uli@zoodle.robin.de), from Bill Wisner (love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net),
from various newsgroups (rec.music.gaffa, rec.music.info, rec.answers,
news.answers) or any ftp site archiving any of these groups.

[my answer to a recent flamewar on the FAQ maintainer's mailing list:]

This FAQ may be redistributed in its entirety in any form on any medium,
even be sold.

[added line about connectivity of rec.music.gaffa]

1.2. What is Love-Hounds?

     Delphi and America Online also provide
     direct access to the Usenet newsgroups, so rec.music.gaffa should be
     availlable directly.

[time flies, a tour started, and new singles appear...]

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

     The purpose of the list is to discuss and disseminate information about
     Tori Amos and her music, and anything else that seems relevant. Due
     to the heavy load of discussion and members after the release of Tori's
     new album Under The Pink Anthony was forced to make the list digest-only,
     that is there is no bounce mail. A massive world tour is running right
     now, and the next set of singles (Past The Mission in the UK) will be
     released any day now. Watch out for limited editions, since they ARE
     limited and the first UtP one, Cornflake Girl, was quite fast sold out
     completely.

[The Sarah McLachlan mailing list has some technical problems with
subscriptions. I'd like to know if this recipe is useful and working...]

2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest

     Sarah McLachlan - fumbling-towards-ecstasy

        subscribe: listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
                   no subject, just the text

                       SUB fumbling-towards-ecstasy Your Real Name

                   the digested version is somehow broken. It might work
                   to first unsubscribe to it by sending mail to the listserver
                   containing

                       SIGNOFF fte-digest

        post:      fumbling-towards-ecstasy@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
                   or just fte@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

[It's already getting time again!]

3.3. What is Katemas?

     Any Katemas party announced for '94?

[Rumours deleted, since noone mentioned them in the past 3+ months:]

4.1. Kate Bush - her carreer and Kate as a human being

     She's born on July 30, 1958. She's not married, but you should bury all
     hopes since her bassist and engineer, Del Palmer, is her one and only
     for too many years now. Kate smokes, but is very reluctant to show this
     bad habit in public. Kate, if you ever read this: count my vote as one
     who wants you to stop! Kate is a vegetarian, though she now eats fish.
     She's 5'3" (1.60m) and doesn't have a middle name. She has two brothers,
     John Carder Bush (Jay), born 1944 - he takes many of the photos of Kate
     that appear on her albums - and Paddy Bush, born 1952, who plays many of
     the exotic instruments found on Kate's albums. Yes, she is indeed a fox.

[up to date release information, and rewordings due to being out-of-context:]

4.2. Basic Discography/Videography

     The following is directly from the latest KBC letter:
[... me again:]
     As 5th of April is already history the singles have already appeared
     on the market. Anyone seen the Australian or Canadian ones?

     A good short description of the contents of Kate's new ~50 minute film
     The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve are the lyrics to the title song of The
     Red Shoes.

[I forgot Organic Acid:]

     Albums and other major collections:

     The Cathy Demos (23 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan)
[...]
        Goodnight Baby, So Soft, I Don't See Why I Shouldn't, Organic Acid

[I forgot Do Bears... from the officially-available-but-not-in-TWW-box list:]

     This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW, 1990).
[...]
        Breathing and Do Bears... (live, from "The Utterly Utterly Live Comic 

        Relief)"

[about the Canadian version: is it still in the shops? (changed 'currently'
into 'lately' and want to know whether this is correct)]

        The French version is a re-shrink-wrapped UK version. The Canadian
        version, lately easily available and relatively cheap, does contain
        the Canadian CDs which do have thinner booklets for some of the regular
        albums that do not always contain the lyrics. The Japanese version has:

[up-to-date version of this list, remember that 'remaining' excludes stuff
mentioned before, especially anything mentioned as missing in the TWW boxed
set. I corrected some errors here, and added some stuff. Anything else?]

     Remaining officially published non-album and non-TWW items are:

     - The Magician Of Lublin
       - The Magician. Only availlable within the film together with voice

         Turkey" (Xmas Special '92))
     - Eat the Music single (US)
       - Eat the Music 12" version
     - Moments of Pleasure (UK normal/special single, cassingle, 12" maxi,

       - You Want Alchemy

[also brand new stuff:]

     Soon to appear: The Glory of Gershwin, a tribute album to Gershwin where
     Kate features with the song The Man I Love.

[SAE 3 is already out, SAE 4 is now the right one:]

4.4. Fanzines

     Kate Bush Club (KBC):

        Right now any SA[S]E should be marked "SAE 4",
        except if you already have sent an "SAE 4" to the KBC.

[new chapter:]

4.7. Experiment IV, the World Wide Web (WWW) Kate Bush home page

     There's a (start of a) WWW home page for Kate Bush information now.
     The URL is

        hhtp://www.jrc.flinders.edu.au/ExpIV/

     Thanks for Richard Frost &lt;rfrost@jrc.flinders.edu.au&gt; for setting this up.

[the X-Windows picture viewer is called xv and not XView, that's something
different:]

6.2. Other files

       To view these GIFs you will need a program for your type of computer.
       Public domain picture file viewers include CSHOW and PICEM for the IBM,
       TURBOGIF and HAMGIF for the Amiga, Giffer or QuickGif for the
       Macintosh, xv for X-Windows, and ImageViewer for the NeXT.
