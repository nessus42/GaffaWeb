In reply to this:

&gt;&gt;Record Collectors magazine there is a feature on Tori.Well it includes a
&gt;&gt;picture of Tori's Y KANT TORI READ album.The cover of the album is very
&gt;&gt;VERY similar to Kate Bush's Babooshka pic.Well I just wonder does Tori
&gt;&gt;"copy" Kate purposely or is she influenced greatly by Kate's brilliance?

&gt;Heh....Just to clarify..she is not influenced by Kate one bit! Cindy
&gt;Palmano who came up with the cover of LE, in an interview by The Caldwells
&gt;(runners of the RDT Fanzine), said specifically:

&gt;CP: Shooting time, we shot over two days. . . It was so long ago now that I
&gt;can hardly remember.

&gt;RDT: I know! I'm asking you to remember things that happened over two years
&gt;ago. I'm sure you've been asked this before, but comparisons have been made
&gt;between the U.S. Cover for Kate Bush's _The Kick Inside_ and the cover
&gt;photo of Tori for _Little Earthquakes_. Both artists are pictured in a
&gt;wooden crate.

&gt;CP: I don't know what you're talking about, actually.

&gt;RDT: I feel silly now. Kate Bush's first album pictured her in a wooden
&gt;crate...

&gt;CP: Did it?! I had no idea.

&gt;RDT: When Tori's album came out there was talk among Kate Bush fans [that's
&gt;you! =)] that it might be some sort of reference to Kate.

&gt;CP: There is no such thing as a new idea. I'll tell you where the crate
&gt;came from. What I make as part of a picture always is relevant. It's never
&gt;there without having had a thought process behind it and around it or
&gt;explored, because that's the way I work. The box wasn't there just because
&gt;it was a box. I had the box made specifically because it was a
&gt;simplifications of the idea of _Alice In Wonderland). Tori was de-scaled,
&gt;hence the tiny piano, too.

&gt;Anything that's a good idea, if it works, it doesn't matter if it comes
&gt;from a conceptual basis or if it just works. I really rate Kate Bush, I
&gt;think she's great. I'm sure that her album cover was good. Maybe I did see
&gt;it. Maybe I have seen it and maybe it did come up as a subliminal thing.
&gt;But who knows where things come from? I certainly wasn't consciously aware
&gt;of it.

 --
&gt;I hope this ends the recent last two year's controversy for a while, even
&gt;though some newbie will come later and say "Hey look..LE and TKI have both
&gt;artists in a box!" But PLEASE..Tori wasn't influenced cover-wise by Kate!
&gt;Thank you! =)

Well..erm..I just must point out that I *was* referring to Y KANT TORI READ's
album cover and not as you so mistakefuly took it The Little Earthquakes
album cover..quite a difference in fact...(probably even before C.Palmano
ever new anything about Tori)...

Also in reply to woj:I think (as some love-hounds pointed out some very
direct "similarites" in certain Tori videos to certain older Kate videos)
aren't there a little too many similarities?
