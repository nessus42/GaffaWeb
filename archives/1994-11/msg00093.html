Hi all,

&gt;&gt;Suspended in gaffa
&gt;
&gt;No one knows!  Possibly from a totally obscure movie about a couple
&gt;who have to get pregnant to win an inheritance.

    I had always thought it was about KaTe's fear/anger. For people to believe
that she and Del had a normal relationship she'd have to "prove that we're
doing it". She doesn't (or didn't at the time) want a child just yet.

&gt;&gt;The Dreaming
&gt;
&gt;The white colonizers of Australia victimize the natives, whose religion
&gt;is far wiser, with its mystical concept of another reality called
&gt;Dreamtime.

    Hmmmm.... Like any of the nations of the 'New World' we can look back at
what colonisation (invasion) has meant to its indigenous peoples and feel
ashamed. I certainly am not going to take on any blame for what my forebears
have done but I do feel obliged to do what I can to help redress past
injustice. Having said that I think I need to take you to task on the idea of a
"religion" that "is far wiser". If I could be so bold and borrow a quote from
one of my Koori friends... mate, that's white-fella talk. :-) It's not their
religion, it's their culture.. their life. I could go on for ages here, (I
started and then thought better of it). Personally, I also question the idea of
"far wiser". Different yes, even beautiful in many ways but still suffering
from the old problems of social inequality, injustice (at least to western
eyes) and sanctioned brutality.

Jeffrey C. Burka sez...
&gt;Jeff (who still sez that TNW is his favorite KaTe album)

    Way to go Jeff! I'll second that point!! :-)
