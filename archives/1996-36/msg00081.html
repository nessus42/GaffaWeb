Thank you so much for your kind words on my thesis. I, too, hope it does not 
spark the "flame-war" that repeatedly flares up pertaining to the "Is KaTe a 
Pagan?" issue. I just want to know what other people think.

Please feel free to use what you will of my work. I place no stipulation on my 
internet-published writings, other than they be properly creditied to me. I am 
honored that you see fit to include my words in GaffaWeb. Thank you!

The speculation that Lily is a member of some Order has been forwarded by many, 
and I believe that the lyrics, tone, and pulse of the song make this quite 
obvious. To which Order Lily belongs is the only unanswered question in my mind. 
The most probable candidates (IMHO) would be the Golden Dawn, the A.'.A.'., the 
Theosophists, or perhaps the followers of Annie Bessant. These groups are all 
currently active in the U.K., and they all use the LBRP, in one form or another.

(Even if Lily is a fictional character, it is entirely plausible that KaTe has 
set up Lily's "character profile" to reflect this situation...)

As for the theory that Lily herself intentionally changed the wording for the 
LBRP when she taught it to KaTe, I would find that rather impausible, even 
considering the concerns that an occultist might have about recording and 
distributing such a ritual. The LBRP is a protective ritual, intended to banish 
negative forces from the user's immediate proximity (temporal and spiritual). As 
someone who whas spent over 15 years researching, working with, and creating 
Magickal techniques, I can not imagine any negative repercussions that would 
result from the widespread implementation of the LBRP by the general public. 
However, there might be some sort of organizational or pedagogical reason to 
restrict the dissemination of the "real" version of such a ritual. Also, the 
LBRP is so widely available in print, books, and on the Web, that it is no 
longer considered a "secret" ritual, so concerns about preserving it's secrecy 
(at least for the last 20 years!) are spurious at best...

As for the idea that KaTe liked the  LBRP so much she wanted to use it in a 
song, BUT modified the structure of a centuries (if not millenia...)-old ritual 
without regard to the spiritual, Magickal, liturgical, and theoretical 
implications, that idea is well outside of my understanding of KaTe. I would 
like to believe that KaTe would respect another's belief enought to represent it 
accurately in a song. I cannot (and will not) believe that KaTe would so modify 
the LBRP with no better reason than to fit her artistic whim...
