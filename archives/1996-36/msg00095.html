Hello!

&gt;     hmmmmmmm..... Although we all appreciate Kate's recordings,  an artist can

I disagree.  Taken to the extreme...what about paintings and sculpture?

Some art is "performance art" and some is "artifact art".  Technology has made
it possible for some arts that WERE strictly performance-based to be made into
artifacts.

Do you want your stories told to you live, by a "storyteller"?  That's the way
it USED to be done, until the printing press.  Do you want your songs sung to
you live, by a performer?  That's the way it USED to be done, before recording
technology.

Well, actually we DO still have touring storytellers (not many) and performers
(not yet passe).  I recall hearing about how Mark Twain did book tours, even
after his health was poor, reading from his latest work--and I was struck by
how it was kind of a precursor to today's bands touring their latest album.
(I wonder if the world lost a book or two by him because of the toll touring
took on his body?)

The Beatles put out albums without touring.  Steely Dan put out albums without
touring.  It's not UNHEARD-OF.  And if that's how they feel, fine.  If Kate
doesn't want to tour, fine!  I'm just GLAD to get the albums!

But then, if she's playing in Cleveland any time soon, I'll be there!

My only true regret would be if too many fans left her because they felt she
MUST tour, and she was unable to afford to create and release new albums.  I
agree that not touring has CERTAINLY contributed to her lack of widespread
fame.

Actually--it occurs to me...  *IF* Kate toured, that would probably make it
even LONGER between albums!  "NO KATE!  DON'T DO IT!  PLEASE DON'T TOUR!"

I'm rambling...I'm sorry.  But I'm tired of hearing Len's "Litany of Tour".
Kate doesn't owe him (or anyone) a tour any more than she owes him a roll in
the hay.

---

To me, it's a sign of a true artist to record albums and not tour, while it's
a sign of an Old Fart to tour and not record albums.  Is the essence of that
statement clear?

Well, that's more than enough croaking out of me.
