 &gt;&gt; I can't be the only one who thinks this a terrible goof that should
not
 &gt;&gt; have been left uncorrected in an otherwise beautiful song.

[Moon]
 &gt; Just wanted to say that I agree!  Always wondered how that 
 &gt; could manage to make it to print.

[IED]

&gt;Once again, this was not a mistake, whether you agree or not.
&gt;All you have to do is listen to any of the other live recordings
&gt;of the song and you'll hear that Kate sings this word exactly the
&gt;same way as in the "New Vocal" version.  It's not a mistake, it's
&gt;just a musical change.

You could be right, but it is also a note that is flat as 
a roof shingle.  I believe you are right that the note is
intended because kate doesn't leave errors that big behind 
without some artistic intent.  That does not change the 
opinions of many, of which I am one, that it is a distinctly 
unpleasant artifact of the production.

Wuthering Heights is the classic composition in which an 
artist writes a song that they can perform best at a certain 
age with a certain skill, and that age passes and that skill 
diminishes.  We've all done it and at some point, we put these
earlier compositions away cheerful that while we did perform 
them well, we also recorded them.  Actually, I always thought 
her version of it on Hammersmith was the least well-done thing 
there, but I attributed that to the fatigue of it coming at 
the end of an incredible feat of performing.

IMO, Kate should have left WH alone but it is her song and her record,
so she can do as she wills.  It ain't my favorite Kate Bush to begin 
with although I love the video because she is such a spectacular
looker in it.  At every phase of her career, a different kind 
of beauty emerges and I am so thankful for it.  The Women of Ireland 
blows me away.  It is so good to hear her voice up front in a mix.

C'mon Cathy, find yourself a new gypsy troupe and see the world!
Don't do the Tour of Life again.  Do a tour for love.  Ours.

Can you be so satisfied that we don't matter?  We'd make a deal 
with God, woman.
