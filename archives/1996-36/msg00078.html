&gt;Actually, the only way in which IED may be called perfect is in the
&gt;perfection of his faith in the perfection of Kate Bush's art.
&gt;In this he is always and forever right -- and RIGHTEOUS!    

uh-huuuuhh..... ;-)


&gt;&gt; Oh, I just thought of another "flawed" recording....Un Baiser D'Enfant.   

&gt;Isn't it significant, though, Ron, that even here you yourself put the word
&gt;"flawed" in quotation marks -- as though you didn't really think it the
&gt;appropriate term for a Kate Bush track. :^)

d'Oh!!!!!


&gt;&gt;While Kate
&gt;&gt;sings "...avant qu'il ne soit trop tard...", BVs are singing "..before it
&gt;&gt;gets
&gt;&gt;too much..."
&gt;&gt;Had Kate been flawless, she would've redone the BVs. 

&gt;I don't know that your (or our) notion of perfection in matters like these
&gt;are fairly applicable to Kate's work.  When we look to find symmetry,
&gt;continuity, thoroughness and sameness of finish in music, how can we say that
&gt;these qualities belong in Kate Bush's aesthetic conception?  If Kate felt
&gt;there was still a place for "Gets too much!" where she left it, well I for
&gt;one don't feel qualified to second-guess her.  It doesn't qualify as a "flaw"
&gt;in my book, because the facile solution of translation of the BVs here might
&gt;not have seemed appropriate to Kate's own vision of the French version of the
&gt;song.  If we were to go through all of her recordings we might find hundreds
&gt;of bits and pieces that we could picture reconfigured, re-designed,
&gt;rerecorded.  But if we were to do that (or have Kate do it), wouldn't we be
&gt;in effect erasing Kate's fingerprints from her own work?  Wouldn't our sense
&gt;of aesthetic rightness be an incursion on her own?  Surely, 
&gt;*that* would be the real error...

too bad Kate didn't do the opposite for the english version....now that would
be interesting.   Have french harmonies in an english song and english
haromonies
in a french song...just ot mess up our minds...

&gt; &gt; Oops!   Also, her french pronounciation is flawed...again, I 
&gt; &gt; would put this under "nice try" category.

&gt;I'm sorry, but here again I cannot agree.  Remember that the character is a
&gt;British governess, educated in schoolgirl French in more or less the same way
&gt;that Kate herself was trained.  Had Kate practiced her diction for the song
&gt;to such a point that no distinction between it and that of a Comedie
&gt;Francaise actress could be detected, the drama would be undermined.

Why would the drama be undermined?  Proper pronounciation has nothing to do
with 
drama.   Drama can occur whether or not the words are spoken or sung correctly.
hmmmmmm....maybe I'm missing the point....It wouldn't be the first time.


&gt;Come on, give me another one!  You don't scare IED! :^)

OK.......BOOO!!!!!!   ;-)

Try THIS on for size:

Kate doesn't tour......therefore she is flawed!   FLAWED I tells-ya!   8-))

Silly fools!   of course she doesn't tour as KATE...she tours as this raunchy
girl called TORI AMOS.  This way she can get all her petty sexual b*llsh*t
out of her system.  Once that's done, she comes back to us as we've known her,
classy, distinctive, an original.   ;-)     Kate has even left us a number of 
clues in Tori's music and such so that the real fans will recognize her under 
that wild red hair wig.  
       - "The Kick Inside" and "little Earthquakes" album covers both have her
         pictured in a wooden box.  In fact,  Kate is on top that same wooden
         box on the Lionheart cover.

       -  "The RED shoes"...."under The PINK"   Pink being a lighter shade of
red.

       - "Rubberband Girl"...."Cornflake Girl"
  
       -  Kate holds a sword in the air on the cover of "KATE BUSH" EP.   Tori
          hold a sword above her on the cover of "Y KANT TORI READ".

       - Jon Kelly has worked for Both Kate and Tori.

       - "Cornflake Girl"'s openning notes are almost identical to "The Red
Shoes".

need I say more......     Tori is Kate or is it Kate is Tori?....
anyways...Kate is flawed.  ;-)

*OK, back to reality*

peace
