&gt; I really didn't care that it wasn't
&gt; on Gaffaweb.  I just noted that so 
&gt; I wouldn't get a lot of pointers 
&gt; to look there first.  OTH, if Don't
&gt; Give Up is there, so should be the
&gt; common ground piece.  Gaffaweb is an 
&gt; incredible resource.  It's a bit 
&gt; overdone with the personalities, IMO, 
&gt; but its for fun I'm told, not 
&gt; scholarship.

   I really don't understand this bit. Gaffaweb not for
scholarship? That is it's main purpose! A quick glance
at the table of contents will confirm that.

Credits 
     Who we are. 

   From the first, when it became the new home to The Garden, it
was intended as a haven for serious KateBushological study. The addition
of Richard Bensam's dictionary, Weiland's carefully edited and annotated
collections of LoveHounds posts and Uli's discography (very much a
work in progress, and when finished will probably be the most complete
discography ever assembled.)

   Vickie mistakenly apologized for Gaffaweb not being finished. It
will never be "finished" as long as LoveHounds exists. 

   Right NOW Gaffaweb contains several megabytes of *text*, in addition
to the hundreds of images. It would take a long time just to read it all.
The "Reaching Out" section grows daily, as Vickie keeps putting up
more interviews and reviews. Her ultimate goal is to include *every*
magazine and newspaper article ever printed about Kate.

   I've been involved in this quite a bit (I did the majority of the HTML
for "The Sensual World" and "Passing Through Air") and I assure you,
it's been a *huge* amount of work.

   As far as "being overdone with the personalities", Gaffaweb is not
simply about Kate...it's the Love-Hounds/rec.music.gaffa site. It
is intended to reflect the personalities of the people who make up
Love-Hounds...if you want an impersonal view of Kate, visit the 
lovely Sony site.

   Once again people, it's <A  HREF="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/">http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/</A>
