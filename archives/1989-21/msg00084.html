 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: KT NEWS

     The October 7 issue of _New_Musical_Express_ contains a
new interview with Kate Bush! It's a reasonably detailed interview,
and Kate as usual deflects a large number of questions, replying
with some candour (for her) but with more enigmatic, non-specific
information. At the end of the regular interview section she is
asked to give "explanations" of each of the eleven songs on the
new CD, and she does. In the interview proper she discusses the
Joyce issue in detail (regarding _The_Sensual_World_ lyrics), and
changes (developments) in her attitude toward life. It is a fascinating
interview, and the writer, Len Brown (who also covered Kate's
work with Trio Bulgarka in _NME_ last year), is very respectful
and appreciative of his subject, interjecting a minimum of silly
journalistic non sequiturs during the article. Kate's face appears,
in an extreme close-up in colour, on the cover, and inside there
are one new colour shot and three new black-and-white photos, all
by Kevin Cummins. All in all this is as good an interview as has
ever appeared in one of the three major oversize British music weeklies,
and for this IED is grateful.
     IED will begin transcribing the rather long piece immediately,
and it will appear as soon as possible in Love-Hounds, so keep eyes
peeled.

-- Andrew Marvick
   P.S.: IED has also discovered a _second_ new poster. Like the
first one IED just described (and which is available through Dirt
Cheap, in Kansas City), the new one is 40 x 60 inches, and features
the exact same photograph (the cover of the UK 12"). But unlike
the first one, this version also has writing: down the right side
are the words "KATE BUSH    THE SENSUAL WORLD" and along the bottom
"Her new single". The lettering is similar to that used for the
single itself, but is printed in orange rather than gold ink. Aside
from the writing, there is no difference between the two posters.
