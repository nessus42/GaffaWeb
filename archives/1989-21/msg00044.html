TSW was played twice today on KITS.  (Interestingly, KFJC didn't have
the single yet when I talked to "Holden Caulfield" on Monday.  Usually,
they're out in front.)

This afternoon, after playing it, Roland West said, "Kate Bush and 'The
Sensual World' -- her new double-edged or double-grooved twelve inch which
is a real bizarre thing -- but then again, she's one bizarre artiste."

Then, this evening, Steve Masters invited listeners to phone in their 
favorite new "modern rock" song, and he would play the top three
vote-getters at eight o'clock.  (Today is a "new music Wednesday.")
Naturally, I immediately called and asked for our heroine.

Well, not only did the song get into the top three, but here's what
Steve had to say about it:"

"That is the MOST requested song tonight here at "Live-105":  Kate Bush
and her latest, "The Sensual World".  Now, I got a really great letter
from Edward. . .he lives in Livermore. [That's me, obviously.  He clearly
didn't want to try to pronounce my last name.] He wrote me that that song,
Steve, by the way, is based and inspired on Molly Bloom's speech at the 
end of _Ulysses_ by James Joyce.  Thank you very much, Edward, for such
a lovely letter.  And, Kate Bush, the album should be out really soon,
too.  They're saying in a week or two, so we'll look forward to that."

Is that fantastic or isn't it?

I'm beginning to wonder about CBS Records' judgment in not making this
song the first single.  

I have a new .signature file, but in case it doesn't work, you know I'm
Ed.
