My version of the lyrics, as I hear them (except for TSW posted by others):

---------------------------------------
It lay buried here
It lay deep inside me
It's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it

It could take me all my life
but it would only take a moment to
tell you what I'm feeling
but I don't know if I'm ready yet
You come walking into this room
like you're walking into my arms
and what would I do without you?

Take away the love and the anger
and a little piece of hope holding us together
looking for a moment that'll never happen
living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
and a little piece of rope won't hold it together

If you can't tell your sister
and you can't tell the priest
it sits so deep you don't think that you can speak about it
  to anyone
and you tell it to your heart
can you find it in your heart
to let go of these feelings
that [abountoloseveryouind] ???
it'll be like two strings beating
speaking in sympathy
"what would we do without you?"

two strings speak in sympathy
"what would we do without you?"

Take away the love and the anger
and a little piece of hope holding us together
looking for a moment that'll never happen
living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
and a little piece of rope won't hold it together
We're building a house of the future together
"what would we do without you?"

Well if its so deep you don't think that you can speak about it
just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future
Well if its so deep you don't think that you can dspeak about it
don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future

You might not
not think so now
just you wait and see
someone will come to help you
---------------------------------------
you see, I'm all grown up now
he said "just put your feet down child, because you're all grown up now"

just like a photograph, I pick you up
just like a station on the radio, I pick you up
just like a face in the crowd, I pick you up   [out]?
just like a feeling that you're sending out, I pick it up   [out]?

(but) I can't let you go
if I let you go you slip into the fog

this love was big enough for the both of us
this love of yours was big enough to be frightened of
it's deep and dark like the water was
the day I learned to swim
he said "just put your feet down child"

just put your feet down child
the water is only waist high
I let go of you gently
then you can swim to me

if this love is big enough to watch over me       [wash]?
big enough to let go of me without hurting me

like the day I learned to swim
"cause your all grown up now"

just put your feet down child
the water is only waist high
I let go of you gently
then you can swim to me
---------------------------------------
see how the child reaches out instinctively to feel how fire will feel
see how the man reaches out instinctively for what he cannot have

[we pull on the push alone] ???

reaching out for the hand
reaching out for the hand that extends
reaching out for that hand to hold
reaching out for the star
reaching out for the star that explodes
reaching out for love

see how the flower leans instinctively toward the light
see how the heart reaches out instinctively for no reason but to touch

[   ] ???

what we see
reaching out for love
[no/now] ?
---------------------------------------
You talked me into the game of chance
it was '39 before the music started
when you walked up to me and you said "hey, heads we dance"
well, I didn't know who you were until I saw the morning paper

there was a picture of you
a picture of you across the front page
it looked just like you
just like you in every way
but it couldn't be true
it couldn't be true just a double stranger

they say that the devil is a charming man
and just like you I bet he can dance

coming up behind with his long tail [that could]? dance 
oh, tails in the air but the penny [ ..will take]? dancing

a picture of you in the middle of the form
standing with your head held high [you walked]? up to the floor

but it couldn't be you
it cannot be you
it's a picture of Hitler

you go "doo, doo, do you want to dance?"
well, I couldn't see you close to me so
I just stood there laughing

a picture of you in the middle of the form
standing with your head held high [you hopped]? up to the floor

but it couldn't be you
it couldn't be you
it's a picture of Hitler

heads we're dancing

do you want to dance?
---------------------------------------

Corrections, of course, much appreciated!
