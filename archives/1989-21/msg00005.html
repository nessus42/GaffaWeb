&gt;Subject: Re: Yet more boring stuff about English
&gt;Summary: which is more interesting than &amp;)oug and IED arguing

&gt;Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt; writes:
&gt;&gt;Regarding "correct" spelling, there was not even such a thing as
&gt;&gt;correct spelling in English until the invention of the printing press.

&gt;As someone else pointed out, English spelling wasn't reasonably
&gt;standardized until LONG after that.  Printing presses became widely
&gt;used around 1500, and in the early 1700's people were still complaining

I don't remeber who "someone else" was, but I do remember that |} took
credit for it! In a later posting he said (and I paraphrase) "As I have
already pointed out, there was no regularized spelling in English until
the 1700's."

&gt;From: "Daniel S. Efran" &lt;de0t+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
&gt;4.  Is Kate's Ninth Wave related to Sting's (Love is the) Seventh Wave? 

As others have observed, the direct reference is to Tennyson, but the
belief that the largest waves breaking on a beach are separated by eight
smaller ones goes back further, indeed to folklore.

&gt;5.  Is there anybody on here who hasn't bought Enya's Watermark album
&gt;yet?  If so, go buy it immediately.  Some of it's in English &amp; some isn't,

Look, I don't mean to pick on you individually, but that is such a typical
attitude among English speakers. "Some of it's in English &amp; some isn't" just
reads like a joke, as if Kate said "Hi, I'm Kate Bush -- and you're not!"
Just for the record, the other prominent languages on the album are Latin and
Irish Gaelic.

&gt;"Every little thing she does is magic, everything she do just turns me on." 

Hey! This song sounds like the start of _DU_ (can I be first to call it that?)

&gt;P.P.P.S.  To me, saying that the new KT album is more like the first
&gt;side of HoL than the second just means it doesn't have many songs about
&gt;dead or dying people.

Please put a :-) on it. _Some_ people might not know you were kidding.
