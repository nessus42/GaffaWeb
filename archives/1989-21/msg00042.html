&gt; What makes you think the writer was familiar with Kate's work?

I already told about this.  The interviewer talks about how he had
been an admirer of Kate's for a long time.  When *The Dreaming* came
out he didn't like the album, but as he listened to it more and more,
it grew on him until he decided it was Kate's most inspired work to
date.  This is *obviously* someone who is familiar with *The
Dreaming*.  If "Nice to Swallow" is a mistake, it is clearly not the
mistake of the interviewer, but rather of the typesetters.

&gt;&gt; It took a long time to do but I think there are some very
&gt;&gt; intense songs and the ones I like best of all are 'Nice To
&gt;&gt; Swallow', 'Houdini', and 'Get Out'.  All in all, I was very
&gt;&gt; proud of this record.

&gt; Note that not one but two song titles are misquoted, and there is
&gt; no reason for misquoting the second one.  Perhaps one could argue
&gt; laziness on the part of the writer, or a typographical error, or
&gt; even a desire for brevity on Kate's part, though I find that
&gt; suprising.

You are being kind of silly.  Kate said "Get Out" because it is her
shorthand for "Get Out Of My House".  Musicians almost often have
short names for their songs with long names.  Do you think they like
saying while working on an album, "Now let's work on 'Get Out Of My
House' for a bit"?  No, they'd rather say, "Now let's work on 'Get
Out' for a bit".

&gt; To my mind the above does not show any great knowledge of _The
&gt; Dreaming_ or indeed of Kate's work.  And Doug says that this is the
&gt; entire extent of the interview's comments on _The Dreaming_.

I never said any such thing.

&gt; Where does he say that he has listened to _The Dreaming_ many times?  Or
&gt; that he is familiar with Kate's work?

In the interview, as I previously mentioned.  It's partly an essay and
partly an interview.  The interviewer also gives a short history of
Kate's career.
