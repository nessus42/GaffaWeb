 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Special notice for Love-Hounds

     First of all, Vickie Mapes of Kansas City, Missouri would like
to thank everyone who called her KT preview number (816) 561-0846
during the last ten days--she received more than 70 calls from fans
all over the world, and she enjoyed the many messages you left on
her machine after hearing the pre-recorded message.
     Also from Vickie comes news of the availability to Kate Bush
fans of a NEW POSTER. This poster is a huge, "subway"-size poster
(approximately 40 x 60 inches), made in the UK on very good paper.
The poster is an "official" product from EMI, not a bootleg. It
is the same poster that a Scottish Love-Hound described seeing on
an Edinburgh hoarding last week: there is no writing of any kind
on the poster, only a huge blow-up, in black-and-white, of the
photograph by John Carder Bush of Kate featured on the cover of her
new single _The_Sensual_World_. In the photo Kate is seen in three-
quarter perspective with her hands out in front of her, and with
sand (or dust) slipping through her fingers. The ink is black, not
the sepia-black "duo-tone" color used by John Carder Bush for the
single itself, but IED has been assured that the printing is first-
rate and the darks are very rich in the poster.
     For a limited time this poster will be available, on a first-
come first-serve basis, for $20.00 US POSTAGE PAID (rolled in a tube the
right size for a poster of these dimensions), from:

            "Dirt Cheap" Recycled Sounds
            Anne Winter, proprietor
            3941 Main Street
            Kansas City, MO 64111
            (816) 531-4890

     The payment should be made by cashier's check or money
order. The price of $20.00 includes DOMESTIC postage only. Any
overseas Love-Hounds should inquire directly of the proprietor
for postage costs for their country.
     Also, there is a limit of 3 copies of the poster per order!
Please don't be greedy, let other fans have a chance too.
     Finally, IED would just like to add that neither Vickie nor
any Love-Hound is receiving one cent in commission from this offer!
What happened was that Vickie just found two copies of the poster
at this store the other day, and when Ms. Winter told her that
she might be able to get about forty more, Vickie realized that
the best thing for all parties would be to announce the availability
of the poster in Love-Hounds--thus bringing the market to the product.
     If this goes well, Ms. Winter said she would be sure to order
any future 40 x 60" KT posters in similar quantities.
     The rest is up to you, people!
     One final message: Vickie's radio program, "Suspended in Gaffa"
(or is that Gasfa?), is on Kansas City's KKFI (90.1 FM), every
Saturday night from 10 p.m. to midnight. She has been previewing
the album for the last three weeks. Her show often affords valuable
insights into Kate's work through comparisons of her early songs
with her more recent ones. And Vickie also plays contemporary recordings
by a vast range of new female artists. It's highly recommended. And
if you do tune in and like the show, let Vickie know--she's always
trying to organize midwest-based Kate fans and get them together.
