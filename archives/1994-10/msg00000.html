&gt;I was wondering whether anyone can help me?  A friend just borrowed my
&gt;copy of "The Red Shoes" and on return asked me what the lyrics "The
&gt;case of George the Wipe" in 'Moments of Pleasure' referred to.  I guess
&gt;he thought I'd know, being English.  Unfortunately I was stumped. 
&gt;Anyone got any ideas?

   Nobody has any idea, and Kate hasn't said (or hasn't been asked.)
But this last round of interviews has been almost 100% content-free.
In almost every one, she has answered the standard questions in a 
very closed-mouth way, and the interviewers have indicated that there
were many questions that she simply refused to answer. Maybe (if she
appears at the Convention) this is one that she will answer.

   The best place to start looking would be the last six years of
comedy shows on British TV. Her love of "alternative" comedy (The
Young Ones, The Comic Strip, Black Adder, etc.) is well known.
She credited The Young Ones on _The Sensual World_ and appeared
on one episode of _The Comic Strip_ and wrote the music for another.

   I wouldn't plan on knowing though...when asked directly (in the
Kate Bush Club newsletter) what was said at the end of a particular
song, her reply was "Can't you tell?" She likes to keep a particular
amount of mystery to her work.
