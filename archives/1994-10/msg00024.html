  My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe
in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family
are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie". It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me
the recipe and they said with a small frown, "I'm afraid not."
Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe?  With a cute
smile, she said, "Yes."  I asked how much, and she responded,
"Two fifty." I said with approval, just add it to my tab.

  Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from
Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00.  I looked again and I
remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
for a scarf.  As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it
said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00."  Boy, was I upset!! I called
Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was
"two fifty," and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie
recipe.  I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill
and they said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were
this expensive so not just everyone could duplicate any of our
bakery recipes....the bill would stand.  I waited, thinking of
how I could get even or even try and get any of my money back.

I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to
have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to see to
it that every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from
Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do
this." I said, "I'm sorry but this is the only way I feel I could
get even," and I will.

  So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few
copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.
(Recipe may be halved.):

2 cups butter                  4 cups flower
2 tsp. soda                    2 cups sugar
5 cups blended oatmeal**      24 oz. chocolate chips
2 cups brown sugar             1 tsp. salt
1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)  4 eggs
2 tsp. baking powder           3 cups chopped nuts
2 tsp. vanilla                        (your choice)

  Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix
together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda.  Add
chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.
  Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.

** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.

Have fun!!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story..
************************************************************
  That's it. Please, pass it along to everyone you know, single
people, mailing lists, etc.....
