&gt; I have surprised--nay, asTOnished--to see numerous postings about
&gt; Tori Anus, many even combining comments about her and about Kate
&gt; in the same paragraph.
 
Well, welcome to the club, I'd say. Wasn't I the one who was
"asTOnished" to see all sorts of comments on Bjurk (bluwaaah) six
months ago? Well, yes. It's just a fact of life that this newsgroup
isn't talking much about Kate at all. I mean, I'm still  not sure
whether the new single is in the UK shops right now, since _nobody_
wrote about that. All I've heard is two months of "Red-Shoes"-
bashing, and then it was done. There are no KaTeFans anymore, it
seems.
 
[...]
&gt; My conclusion is that I must be missing something, since so
&gt; many of you seem to have become devotees of Tori. But what truly
&gt; blows my mind is the continual mention of her in this newsgroup.
&gt; How can people with outstanding taste (Kate goes over the heads
&gt; of so many people) be so enamoured of this bloated wench? Is it
&gt; just because she's a solo female piano-based singer/songwriter,
&gt; a la Kate?
 
Well, at least Tori has talent, which is more than I can say for
Bwork. But it does belong to the _highly informative_ Tori Amos
mailing list. (_really-deep-thoughts-
request@gradient.cis.upenn.edu_)
 
While not on the subject: are there any Happy Rhodes CD-singles,
bootlegs, other stuff?
 
My conclusion is that you are missing somethings, as I do: Kate.
Whatever happened to her? Must we change this newsgroup into
rec.music.leftovers ?
 
Finally, this irritates the hell out of me: the theme park where
Kate performed way back when, is called:
 
DE EFTELING
 
and it's _not_ based in Amsterdam, but in
 
KAATSHEUVEL
 
. Try to pronounce that for a change.
 
Praying for some Kate info....
