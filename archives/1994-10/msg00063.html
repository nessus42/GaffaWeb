It's also bloody Gallup's rules as well, at least I think it's still
Gallup - I seem to recall reading somewhere that they'd lost the
contract or something like that. Anyway, (as quite a few of you will
know) a single isn't included if it has more than 4 tracks, although I
think remixes of the title track aren't included. A two part single, or
an ordinary/limited release, gets round this and both will count towards
the charts. So if you're a particularly prolific artist, like the T
word, you can have umpteen B-sides and still count as a single. However,
EMI do seem to be bandwagoning here... KaTe is many things, but
"prolific" is not one of them. :-)

Does the 12" have different tracks this time? That annoyed me with MoP -
I don't normally buy vinyl, Tom Lehrer notwithstanding, but they had to
go and put a different track on the 12"...
