&gt;Someone asked about The Line, The Cross, The Curve:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If it is out, how is it?
&gt;
&gt;chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (chris williams) answers:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The opinion seemed to be:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Kate is not a great actress
&gt;
&gt;Actually, it's hard to tell.  She maybe had three lines of actual
&gt;(spoken) dialog in the whole film.  When singing, even the best dramatic
&gt;actor looks like William Shatner.

   See: Jack Nickolson in "Tommy."

&gt;Agree.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It was much better than "Cats" and they want to see it again and again.
&gt;
&gt;I never saw "Cats" - isn't that that musical by Andrew Dice Webber, 
&gt;writer of offensive musicals? - Wait, no, that was - oh, nevermind...
&gt;However, I do want to see it again and again.

   It's from a bit from the first season of Saturday Night Live.
A TV ad for a stage magician, and all the people in the ad were saying
the exact same thing with a glazed expression. "I loved it. It was much
better than Cats. I want to see it again and again." Show my age.

&gt;One point I'd like to bring up - during "And So Is Love", we see a
&gt;bird flying around the room, but then the bird dies at the end (this
&gt;seen, apparently, is also shown in the video for ASiL).
&gt;
&gt;My question:  Did the (real) bird really get killed?  Or did Kate (the
&gt;real, live director, NOT the character she was playing) just HAPPEN
&gt;to have a dead, stuffed bird lying around?  Does she have a friend who's
&gt;a taxidermist?  My point:  For someone who's as animal-rights as Kate is,
&gt;killing off a bird (or even exploiting an already-dead bird), even for
&gt;the sake of art, seems someone out-of-character.

   I don't know if Kate can be described as an "animal-rights" person,
exactly. She doesn't eat meat, and encourages others not too, but it
seems to be more a personal position than a political position. Reports
that she has added fish to her diet would seem to indicate that she
is less than rigid about it.
