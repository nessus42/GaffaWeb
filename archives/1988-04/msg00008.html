                     A Chronology of Kate Bush's Career

     This chronology is basically a revised and slightly enlarged
version of a chronology by Peter Fitzgerald-Morris, the editor of
_Homeground_, "The International Kate Bush Fanzine". Peter's
chronology was included in a book of sixty-six of Kate's songs
entitled _Kate_Bush_Complete_.
     That book is an absolutely essential part of any serious fan's
collection.  It may be more valuable for its chronology than for its
transcriptions of the music. The latter, unfortunately, are not an
improvement over earlier editions, offering only the basic melodies
notated in drastically simplified form and punctuated at intervals by
shorthand chord indications. _Kate_Bush_Complete_ also includes an
edition of the songs' lyrics, and it marks an improvement over earlier
available printed versions.
     The book was originally edited by Cecil Bolton and published by
EMI Music Publishing, but it is widely understood that virtually all
of the research for the chronology and the lyrics was undertaken by
Peter FitzGerald-Morris. Much of the information which appeared in
Peter's _Kate_Bush_Complete_ chronology had appeared, in instalments
over a period of five years, in issues 1 through 25 of the fanzine
_Homeground_.  In _Kate_Bush_Complete_ the chronology was entitled
_Retracing_All_the_Scenes:_An_outline_of_Kate's_career_to_date_.  The
following version, which draws from several sources in addition to the
FitzGerald-Morris chronology, is by Andrew Marvick. It is still
woefully incomplete, however. Some events have been omitted simply
because it is not known in which year they occurred, and other events
which are recorded here remain rumour and have never been
substantiated by Kate.
     IED has done a little editing here and there, in most cases just
in order to clarify the language, or a fact. Peter's tendency to
portray Kate's work and intentions as perhaps a bit more activist or
"challenging" than they may really be, and to describe Kate's
commercial and critical successes in the rosiest possible light, has
not been corrected in this edition. It seems a reasonable luxury for
Peter to allow himself, considering how much work he put into this
project.

_________________________________________________________________________


                       _Kate_Bush:_A_Chronology_of_Her_Career_

July30,1958

     Catherine Bush born at Bexleyheath Maternity Hospital, South East
London.


1958-1969

     Kate has an ordinary childhood in a loving and supportive family,
immersed in music, art and literature.  &lt;This is the first of several
statements that indicate the conservative and protective tone of
Fitzgerald-Morris's chronology, which seems to have been designed at
least partly with an eye to defending Kate against various kinds of
criticism in the past.&gt;


September 1969

     Kate starts at St. Joseph's Senior School, Bexley.  She is
obliged to take up the violin, as all pupils have to learn an
instrument. She plays well, but does not enjoy it.


1970

     Kate's brother Paddy needs someone on piano to accompany his
violin playing. Kate's father shows her the C Major chord and she
begins to play.
     Kate follows her elder brother John and begins to develop her
poetry. Her piano playing is an outlet for her frustration.  She is
heavily influenced by an interest in Greek mythology.


1971

     Kate begins to set her poems to her own chord formulations.
Embryonic versions of songs such as "The Man With the Child in His
Eyes" and "Saxaphone Song" begin to emerge.


1972

     At the suggestion of Kate's family, Ricky Hopper, a friend with
music business connections, tries to place "demo tapes" of Kate's
songs with a record company, with a publishing deal in mind. At this
stage Kate considers herself more of a writer than a singer. These
original tapes have over thirty songs on each.  &lt;An unfortunate
wording, since it may mean that there was one collection of thirty
songs which was duplicated, and of which one copy was sent to each
publisher; or that there were actually several different thirty-song
collections.&gt; All the major companies are approached. None accept.
Kate's songs are described as "morbid", "boring" and "uncommercial".
     Kate feels that she cannot pursue a career in music and considers
the alternatives: psychiatry or social work.
     Unable to help further, Ricky Hopper makes contact with Dave
Gilmour of Pink Floyd, whom he knew at Cambridge University. Gilmour,
who at this time is spotting for talent that he can assist, is
persuaded to listen to the demos and then to hear Kate perform.  He is
impressed, and agrees to help.


1973

     Kate records at Gilmour's home studio. The backing band is
Gilmour himself on guitar, and Peter Perrier and Pat Martin of Unicorn
on drums and bass, respectively. The songs recorded at this stage
include "Passing Through Air" (later to surface on the b-side of the
1980 single "Army Dreamers") and "Maybe", originally called "Davy".
     &lt;Again, a bit more detail would have been welcome here. There is
no mention of how many songs were recorded during these recording
sessions. Incidentally, an excerpt of this version of "Maybe", which
presumably first appeared on Kate's original demos, was played by Kate
during a radio programme called "Personal Call". It should not be
confused with the later, professional-quality version of the recording
which was made the following year (see below).&gt;
     The new demos are again circulated to record companies with no result.


1974

     With no progress in her musical ambitions, Kate seriously
considers a career in psychiatry.
     Kate takes her "O Level" examination and obtains ten "Pass"
grades, with best results in English, music and Latin.


1975

     Gilmour decides that the only way to interest the record
companies in Kate's talent is to make a short three-song demo to full
professional standards. He puts up the money.


June 1975

     Kate goes into Air Studios in London's West End, with Gilmour as
producer, Andrew Powell as arranger, Geoff Emerick as engineer. The
three songs recorded are "Saxaphone Song" (also known at this stage as
"Berlin"), "The Man With the Child In His Eyes", and "Maybe".


July 1975

     Kate takes her "mock A Level" examinations.
     While Pink Floyd are at Abbey Road Studios recording
_Wish_You_Were_Here_, Gilmour plays the three-track demo to Bob
Mercer, then General Manager of EMI's pop division. Mercer is
impressed and negotiations are opened.
     The deal takes some time to conclude. It is much discussed at
meetings between Kate, her family, Gilmour and EMI.


1976

     Kate gets a small inheritance, and decides to leave school to
concentrate on preparing herself for a career in music.  She buys an
old honky-tonk piano for 200 Pounds and begins screeching into
existence her unmistakable voice.
     The EMI deal begins to take shape. A publishing contract is
settled first.


July 1976

     Kate finally settles a recording deal with EMI.  The contract is
for four years, with options at the end of the second and third year.
Kate receives a 3,000-Pound advance.  EMI are content for Kate to take
time to write songs, sharpen her lyrics, train her voice and generally
have time to "grow up".
     Kate pursues her dancing, first at the Elephant and Castle, South
London. But after seeing Lindsay Kemp perform in _Flowers_, she
attends his classes at the Dance Centre in Covent Garden.  After Kemp
goes to Australia, Kate trains with Arlene Phillips, choreographer of
_Hot_Gossip_.


1977

     During the first year of the contract Kate makes two further demo
tapes. She resists EMI attempts to "commercialize" her songs. She
pursues her dancing. She moves away from home and into a flat in a
house owned by her father in Lewisham, Southeast London, with her
brothers as neighbours.


March 1977

     "Wuthering Heights" is written at the full moon.


April 1977

     Kate's brother Paddy forms a band with his friends Del Palmer,
Brian Bath and Charlie Morgan. Kate is asked to be the vocalist, and
the band adopts the title of the KT Bush Band. Starting at the Rose of
Lee public house in Lewisham, and then in pubs and clubs in and around
London and the Home Counties over a three-month period, the band
perform a varying set consisting mostly of rock-and-roll standards.
("Honky Tonk Women", "Heard it Through the Grapevine", "Come
Together", "Sweet Soul Music", "Satisfaction", etc.), although
latterly Kate sings "Saxaphone Song" and "James and the Cold Gun" from
her own repertoire.


August 1977

     Kate is finally called in to record material for an album. The
producer chosen is Andrew Powell, and the backing band are half of
Pilot and half of Cockney Rebel. Though the songs recorded are all
Kate's own material, her role is confined to vocals, some
piano-playing and some simple piano arrangements. It is decided to use
eleven songs from this session and two from the 1975 Gilmour demo on
the album.


September 1977

     EMI want to release "James and the Cold Gun" as the first single.
Kate wants "Wuthering Heights", and she gets her way.


November 4, 1977

     The original release date for "Wuthering Heights". At a late
stage Kate asks EMI to change the artwork on the picture-sleeve from
the "pink top" photo to Del Palmer's photo-concept of "Kite".  She
gets her way, and all the campaign materials are altered.  By the time
the new campaign material is ready, Christmas is approaching and EMI
are unwilling to launch their new artist into the pre-Christmas
maelstrom. The release date is put back until the new year. Many demos
&lt;i.e., promos&gt; of the single have already been sent out to radio
producers. EMI tries to retrieve them to prevent premature airplay.
Eddie Puma, producer of London commercial station Capital Radio's
_Late_Show_, and Tony Myatt, the presenter, admire the record so much
that they decide to play it, and continue to play it throughout
November and December. Other radio stations follow. "Wuthering
Heights" is an airplay hit two months before release.


1978

January

     At a three-day sales conference for EMI International delgates,
Kate sings live &lt;song or songs unidentified&gt;, and Bob Mercer predicts
that she will be one of the major talents of the future.


January 20, 1978

     "Wuthering Heights" is finally released. Kate does her first live
radio interview on Tony Myatt's _Late_Show_.
     Airplay for the single rapidly builds on British commercial
radio, on Radio Luxemburg, and on BBC Radio 1.


February 7, 1978

     "Wuthering Heights" enters the "official" BMRB chart at number 42.


February 9, 1978

     Kate makes her first-ever television appearance in a disused tram
depot in West Germany, for the famous _Bio's_Bahnhof_ on WDR-TV. She
sings "Kite" live, backed effectively by the KT Bush Band, and
"Wuthering Heights" to a backing tape. The backdrop, which is supposed
to represent the Yorkshire moors, includes a volcano.  Following her
performance the host, Dr. Alfred Biolek, carries on an entirely
one-sided conversation in German with Kate.


February 14, 1978

     The single moves up to number 27. Having cracked the magic "Top
Forty", the gates open and Kate appears on...


February 16, 1978

     _Top_of_the_Pops_. She performs in high heels and slacks. Kate
says later, "It was like watching myself die...a bloody awful
performance."  &lt;Kate actually appeared on the programme twice to
perform the song, the second time wearing a white gown similar to that
worn for the "official" video, with similar video effects. An excerpt
of this performance was shown later on the programme _Ask_Aspel_.&gt;


February 17, 1978

     Kate's first album, _The_Kick_Inside_, is released,
and a huge promotional campaign is unleashed.


February 21, 1978

     The single moves up to number 13.


February 25, 1978

     Kate performs live on BBC TV's _Saturday'_Nights_at_the_Mill_
singing "Moving" and "Them Heavy People" and giving a brief interview.
     The first major interviews appear in the music press, and Kate is
the subject of intense media attention. She begins preparing for a
live tour, projected for mid-year.


February 28, 1978

     The single moves up to number 5. Kate is said to be the most
photographed woman in the U.K.


March 2, 1978

     The Keith ("Keef") MacMillan-directed video for "Wuthering
Heights" is shown on _Top_of_the_Pops_. It is the second video for the
song. The first, made by Rockflix in an (unidentified) outdoor
setting, is rejected for British promotional use, although it is used
in other territories.


March 7, 1978

     "Wuthering Heights" is number 1 on the British singles chart,
displacing Abba. The press turn it into a nationalistic celebration.
EMI celebrate with a champagne reception for Kate, and dinner in
Paris. She celebrates by buying a 7,000 Pound Steinway piano. The
single celebrates by going silver in the U.K. (250,000 sales).
     The single remains an number 1 for four weeks.


March 16, 1978

     On the same evening as her second "number 1" appearance on
_Top_of_the_Pops_, Kate is interviewed on the BBC TV current-affairs
programme, _Tonight_.
     Mickie Most asks Kate to appear in the pilot edition of his new
pop-rock television programme _Revolver_.  She is introduced by Peter
Cook and sings "Them Heavy People" (which EMI want to release as the
follow-up single) live. The programme is screened on May 20, 1978.


March 25, 1978

     Kate starts a four-day promotional trip to Eire, appearing on the
top show in the Irish ratings, "The Late Late Show".
_The_Kick_Inside_ is released in the U.S.A., unchanged except for an
inappropriate U.S.- and Canada-only front-cover design, unauthorised
by Kate. This is sometimes known the "mirror" or "hands-on-face"
cover.  This cover continues to be used by Harvest, EMI's distributor
for Kate's recordings in Canada, but it was discontinued in the U.S.
in July 1978 when Kate's contract was transferred to the newly
launched EMI-America label.
     The album's reception in the U.S. is somewhat quieter than in
Europe and England. &lt;To put it very mildly!&gt; Capitol-EMI wait for FM
radio-play to determine a likely single.


April 4, 1978

     "Wuthering Heights" moves down to number 3. _The_Kick_Inside_
reaches its chart peak at number 3.
     Kate is off to Europe to promote single and album in the
Netherlands, West Germany (a second time) and France. In Amsterdam
Kate makes a 25-minute promotional film of six tracks &lt;Peter
inexplicably writes "seven", though only six tracks were filmed&gt; at
Die Eftelung, a gothic horror theme-park. Her visit is commemorated by
a new gravestone. She performs on the _Voor_de_Vuist_Weg_ television
programme. In Germany Kate appears on the television programme
_Scene_78_. Other guests that night include Dr. Feelgood and The
Boomtown Rats.
     Tour plans are put back to the end of the year.


May, 1978

     Kate makes her first promotional trip to the U.S.A. and Canada,
(although she gives no performances and makes no U.S. television
appearances), and then takes a short holiday.
     "Wuthering Heights" goes gold in the U.K. (500,000 sales). Kate
presents the disk to Tony Myatt. For four years it hangs in the foyer
of Capitol Radio's London base.
     EMI allow Kate to have her way over the choice of the follow-up
single in the U.K. It is to be "The Man With the Child in His Eyes",
which Kate had always wanted to be a single, as she felt it showcased
her real songwriting talent. It is less of a novelty, and more of a
standard. Dave Gilmour (executive producer on the track, which
actually dates from the June, 1975 demo-sessions) is also pleased. In
Japan, the U.S. and elsewhere the follow-up later in the year will be
EMI's first choice, "Them Heavy People".


May 28, 1978

     The second single is released in the U.K. Airplay and sales are
very good.


June, 1978

     Kate goes to Japan to participate in the 7th Tokyo Song Festival.
She She performs "Moving" (which is the debut single in Japan) live
before an audience of 11,000 at the Nippon Budokan. The television
audience is nearer 35 million. The single is boosted on its way to
number 1 in the Japanese chart.  Kate wins the Silver Prize jointly
with American group The Emotions &lt;!&gt;.
     During her visit to Japan Kate makes her only television
advertisement, and her only endorsement for a commercial product -- a
spot for Seiko watches.
     On her return to Britain Kate has under four weeks to get
material together for her second album. She does not like being under
such pressure. In the time available, three new songs are written, and
a number of old ones are revamped. These songs, making up the basic
material for _Lionheart_, are demoed in a studio designed by Paddy
Bush and built out of the royalties from "Wuthering Heights".


July 1978

     Kate is the best selling female albums artist in the U.K.  for
the first quarter of 1978. "Wuthering Heights" has been number 1 in
the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand (five weeks), and Australia; and
"top-ten" in Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa,
Denmark, Sweden and Finland.


July 4, 1978

     "TMwtCihE" reaches its chart peak in the U.K. at number 6. _TKI_
is re-released in the U.S.A. on a new label--EMI-America--and with a
different and inappropriate cover, now sometimes referred to as the
"country-western" or "Tammy Wynette" cover. "Wuthering Heights" is
finally released as a single in the U.S. There are some good notices,
but Kate is considered by radio programmers to be "too bizarre" for
the American market.


July 7, 1978

     Kate travels to Superbear Studios in Nice, France to record her
second album. She had had good reports of this studio from Dave
Gilmour, who recorded his first solo album there.  The recording is a
much-needed break for Kate. In the sunshine and the mountain air she
recovers from almost six months of solid promotion, and pursues her
real vocation, making music.


August, 1978

     It takes ten weeks at Superbear to record twelve tracks, of which
ten are used for the new album. Kate has definite aims for this album.
She sees her first album as having affected the senses. _Lionheart_.
is to be aimed at the guts. In this she comes into some conflict with
Andrew Powell, who is again acting as producer.  She is allowed more
of her own way in the studio, and after applying some pressure, she is
able to bring the KT Bush Band in to play on some of the tracks. Kate
is credited as assistant producer, but _Lionheart_ is the end of the
road for the Bush-Powell partnership.


September 5, 1978

     Kate debuts one of the tracks from _Lionheart_ on a U.K.
children's television programme, _Ask_Aspel_. She later explains that
she wanted to sing _In_the_Warm_Room_, but felt that it was too risque
for a children's show. She sings "Kashka From Baghdad", a song about
two gay lovers, instead.
     As the album takes longer than expected, Kate is recalled to
London by EMI to do some prior promotion. At her own request, Kate is
interviewed by a diverse collection of publications ranging from
_The_Sun_, to _Vegetarian_ and _Vogue_ (the last featuring Kate in
photographs by David Bailey).


October 11, 1978

     From completing the final mix of the album, Kate is straight on a
plane for Australia, where she is to preside with that month's teen
pop sensation Leif Garrett over the Tenth annual TV Week _King_of_Pop_
Awards before a live audience of 1,000 in a circus tent, and a
television audience of two million on the Nine Network.
     Kate also performs live on the television programme _Countdown_,
debuting the routine for "Hammer Horror", devised in her hotel room.
"Hammer Horror" is planned as the first single from the new album.


October 17, 1978

     Kate moves on to New Zealand, specifically Christchurch, for a
television special. There she again performs "Hammer Horror".
     The live tour is put back to February 1979.


November, 1978

     Julie Covington, who has known Kate and her family for many
years, releases an album including her own cover version of "The Kick
Inside".
     Kate promotes the new album in the Netherlands, Germany and
France, although there is no record of any television appearances
dating from the trip.


November 7, 1978

     "Hammer Horror" enters the British singles chart at the
unexpectedly low place of number 73. &lt;Contrary to usual record-company
theory, saturation of the market place with new, rushed product nearly
immediately after the success of a debut album is more often than not
a poor business move, and usually does as much damage as good to the
artist's budding popularity. The mediocre sales of _Lionheart_ should
not have been surprising to anyone.&gt; _Lionheart_ has its international
launch at the 14th-century Ammersoyen Castel, two hours' drive from
Amsterdam. 120 guests, from EMI Europe, Canada and the U.K., and
including disk jockeys Tony Myatt and Kenny Everett, as well as Dr.
and Mrs. Bush, attend the reception. After dinner, in the grounds of
the castle, Leo Bouderwijas, the President of the Association of Dutch
Phonographical Industries, presents Kate with the prestigious Edison
Award for the best single of 1978. Kate is also presented with a
platinum disc for sales of the album in Holland.


November 8, 1978

     Kate flies back to the U.K. for a private buffet at The Venue for
the presentation of the _Melody_Maker_ 1978 Poll Awards. In the first
year of her public career Kate has been voted Best Female Vocalist and
Brightest Hope of 1978.


November 10, 1978

     The international release of _Lionheart_.

November 17, 1978

     Kate performs "Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake" on
_The_Leo_Sayer_ _Show_, on BBC TV. She is off on a personal appearance
tour of British record shops.


November 21, 1978

     "Hammer Horror" reaches its chart peak, number 44. _Lionheart_
enters the album chart at number 36.


December, 1978

     Kate is off to promote in the U.S.A. for the release there
of "The Man With the Child in His Eyes".


December 9, 1978

     Most importantly, she performs two songs on the U.S. NBC-TV
programme, _Saturday_Night_Live_. This is the only live entertainment
programme on U.S. television, and is the most influential programme
for the pop music market, as well as the most important American
showcase for "alternative" music.  Kate performs "The Man With the
Child in His Eyes", seated on a piano, to the accompaniment of veteran
rock keyboardist Paul Shaffer; and "Them Heavy People", in a raincoat
and Fedora hat.  Nothing remotely like it has ever been seen on
American television before.
    She is invited by Eric Idle, who is host of that edition; and she
is visited by Mick Jagger. Paul Simon drops in to watch her
performance.
     Kate does press and radio promotion and moves on to Canada for
more of the same. She is known to have made no other North American
television appearances during this trip, however.
     Back in England the Kate Bush Club, the official fan club,
is formed.


1979

January 6, 1979

     Kate is voted Best New Artist of 1978 in the _Record_Mirror_
annual poll.
     Kate is guest of honour at the San Remo Song Festival in Italy.
This is screened in most of Europe, but not in the U.K.
     Preparations for the live tour begin in earnest. Kate's own
concept is to combine poetry, music, songs and dance in an entirely
new way. Her dance ideas and training will be supervised by Antony Van
Laast, of the London Contemporary Dance Company (who had appeared with
Kate in the video for Hammer Horror). Kate will be backed by a
seven-piece band, the core of which will be Paddy Bush (mandolin,
backing vocals), Del Palmer (bass), and Brian Bath (rhythm guitar) of
the KT Bush Band, supplemented by Alan Murphy (lead guitar), Kevin
McAlea (keyboards, saxaphone), Ben Barson (keyboards), and Preston
Heyman (drums).


January 20, 1979

     Kate appears on _The_Mult-Coloured_Swap_Shop_ on BBC TV, and is
interviewed by Noel Edmonds and via a phone-in by the viewers.


February, 1979

     Kate records the title song "The Magician" (music by Maurice
Jarre) for the film _The_Magician_of_Lublin_.
     Penny Allan, a women's-column feminist for _The_Guardian_,
lambasts Kate for "cultivating a childlike voice and encouraging her
audience to act like voyeurs."


February 17, 1979

     "The Man With the Child in His Eyes" enters the U.S. _Billboard_
Hot Hundred, the first of Kate's singles so to do. It remains there
for four weeks, peaking at number 85.


February 18, 1979

     Kate travels to Leysin &lt;Lausanne?&gt;, Switzerland, to take part in
a mammoth European television co-production.  The results are carved
up into three television shows, and it is planned that Kate will
appear in two. For the first, an Easter _Abba_Special_, she records a
routine for "Wow".  At the rehearsals the camerament and journalists
break into spontaneous applause, and the press coverage verges on the
hysterical. For the second programme, a Christmas programme to be
called _The_Winter_Snowtime_Special_, she records a version of
"Wuthering Heights" barefoot in the snow of the Swiss Alps. (The
latter film was never aired.)
     On her return to Britain Kate goes into Air Studios in London
with Jon Kelly, the engineer on _The_Kick_Inside_ and _Lionheart_, to
determine the possibilities of working as a co-production team on
Kate's next album.
     The video for "Wow", the next single, is made at Wilton's Music
Hall in East London, directed by Keef MacMillan.


February 27, 1979

     Kate takes part in BBC Radio 1's first-ever phone-in programme,
_Personal_Call_, answering listeners' calls for 60 minutes and jamming
the Broadcasting House switchboards.


March, 1979

     The tour rehearsals switch from Covent Garden and WoodWharf
Studios, South London, to a film soundstage at Shepperton Film
Studios, so that the dancing and the music can be put together.


March 4, 1979

     Kate attends the Capital Radio Annual Awards dinner at the
Grosvenor House Hotel to receive the accolade for Best British
Newcomer and Best British Female Vocalist.


March 5, 1979

     The video for "Wow" is shown on television for the first time on
_The_Kenny_Everett_Video_Show_. The tickets for the tour go on sale
the same day (except for certain venues, which are to cause much
embarrassment by jumping the gun).


March 6, 1979

     Kate is interviewed on the Thames-TV programme _Thames_at_Six_
about the upcoming tour and the new single. (This may be the same
programme on which Faith Brown's parody of the "Wuthering Heights"
"field" video is shown, with Kate's reaction afterward.)


March 7, 1979

     As part of a new Arts programme on BBC-2 TV called
_Musical_Chairs_, a documentary recording the making of the "Wow"
video is shown.


March 9, 1979

     "Wow", Kate's fourth single, and the second from _Lionheart_, is
finally released.
     Kate is training to the pitch of an Olympic athlete for a tour
that will last a month and a half, with Kate on stage almost
continually for two and a half hours for most evenings during that
period. (Only the Copenhagen, Hamburg and Amsterdam dates would be
shortened, due to illness.)


March 20, 1979

     The tour is now completely sold out. Extra dates are announced at
the London Palladium, the Birmingham Hippodrome, and the Manchester
Apollo. These are also sold out in days.
     Kate is meanwhile maintaining absolute secrecy on the style and
content of the show.


March 22, 1979

     The chart position of "Wow" is such that it is listed to be shown
on _Top_of_the_Pops_. Kate has no time to record an appearance, and
the BBC refuse to screen the video, a certain section of which they
consider unsuitable for their younger viewers. Kate records another
performance and leaves it to the BBC to cover up the offending
gesture.  They do, and the clip is shown.
     London's Rainbow Theatre is taken over for the final dress
rehearsal before the commencement of the tour. Despite very tight
security, a free-lance photographer obtains entry and takes photos of
the performance. He is discovered before he can escape. He is ticked
off by Kate, and his film is confiscated.


April 2, 1979

     The tour playdate at Pool Arts Centre in Dorset. The performance
is a total success, but is marred by the death of lighting engineer

packed up.


April 3, 1979

world of rock...Kate Bush is the sort of performer for whom the word
'superstar' is belittling." (Mike Davies, _Melody_Maker_.)
     "Kate's dream-machine techniques are by far the best I've ever
encountered on a British rock-and-roll (sic) tour." (Sandy Roberts,
_Sounds_.)

     The Oxford New Theatre date.
     "Yeah, Kate Bush...You're amazing." (M.V.B., _Oxford_Times_.)


April 7, 1979

     "There is no doubt that such a performance merited nothing less

April 10, 1979

     The first Manchester Apollo Theatre date.
     "Oh yes, Kate Bush is amazing...Her stage performance evaporates
all doubts and adds a totally new theatrical dimension to the rock
medium." (Roy Kay, _Manchester_Evening_News_.)

Minister, James Callaghan, who, fighting Mrs. Thatcher in the 1979
election campaign, is looking for all the support he can get.


April 11, 1979

     The second Manchester Apollo Theatre date.

Rock and Pop Awards for 1978. She is presented with the award for Best
Female Vocalist.


April 12, 1979

     The Sunderland Empire date.

(Robin Denselow, _The_Guardian_.)

literally--stunning." (Thorsen Prentice, _Daily_Mail_.)
     "A triumph of energy, imagination, music and dance."  (Susan
Hill, _Melody_Maker_.)

     The second Hammersmith Odeon date.
     This is the concert which was video-taped and recorded for both
the video release and (with later over-dubs) the _On_Stage_ EP.


May 14, 1979

     The third Hammersmith Odeon date, and the final date of the tour.
     Kate declines the offer to sing the theme song to the James Bond

right for her.

undisclosed reasons the release is postponed.


November 30, 1979

     A new recording of Lesley Duncan's "Sing, Children, Sing" is

the single are to go to the U.N. _Year_of_the_Child_ fund.


December 21, 1979

     _The_Winter_Snowtime_Special_ is aired on BBC TV.  This is the
second of two films for which Kate had contributed performances on
February 18, 1979. However, the original film of Kate singing
"Wuthering Heights" while walking barefoot in the snow is not
included. Instead, a hastily filmed video for "December Will Be Magic
Again" is aired on the programme.


December 28, 1979

     _Kate_, a forty-five-minute television special, is screened on
BBC TV, featuring songs old and new. Some of these were filmed during
live television-studio performances, others were videos prepared in
advance and featuring studio recordings in more or less the same form
as their album counterparts.  Among the songs performed are "Violin",
"Egypt", and "Ran Tan Waltz" (which would emerge as the b-side of
"Babooshka").  In addition, one or two small pieces of incidental
music are recorded specifically for the programme, which includes a
guest appearance by Peter Gabriel, and a duet by Gabriel and Kate of
Roy Harper's song, "Another Day".


1980

of working with rhythm boxes and the Fairlight CMI.

for a Dr. Hook special to be screened on BBC TV the following month.


April 11, 1980

     "Breathing" receives its world debut on the BBC Radio 1 review programme
_Round_Table_. The reviewers are literally stunned.


April 14, 1980

     "Breathing" is released. The video, which includes a scene of a
nuclear explosion, is controversial enough for the BBC to disallow it
from being screened in its entirety on _Top_of_the_Pops_.  (Note: This
is PFM's interpretation. More likely they just felt that it was too
long for that programme's format. -- AM)
     Kate tapes a long interview for German television for use in a
forty-five minute documentary comprised of discussions of Kate's
career with her family and excerpts from the Hamburg and Mannheim live
shows, to be called _Kate_Bush_in_Concert_.


April 25, 1980

     Kate appears on the BBC TV programme _Nationwide_ again, this
time to be interviewed about her "protest" song. The controversial
part of the video is screened for the only time on British television.
(Again, this may be misleading: _Nationwide_ simply played the entire
video, for a programme devoted devoted to the subject of nuclear
disarmament. -- AM)


May, 1980

    Edited parts of the "Breathing" video are shown twice on
_Top_of_the_Pops_.


May 10, 1980

     The Kate Bush Club holds its first convention at the Empire Ball
Room, Leicester Square in London. Kate attends.  The edited version of
Keef MacMillan's recording of the May 13th concert is given its first
public showing.
     After working twenty or more hours a day, Kate finishes
_Never_For_Ever_.  Its release is put back, however, until September.
Kate takes a badly needed holiday.


June 23, 1980

     "Babooshka" is released. Because the technicians at the BBC are
on strike, the video cannot be shown. "Babooshka", however, is Kate's
most successful single since "Wuthering Heights."
     Kate takes a few weeks out to rest from her exertions on the
album.


August, 1980

     Kate puts down the first ideas for a new album, beginning the
two-year project that would produce _The_Dreaming_, which remains to
this day the single greatest piece of twentieth century music. (OK, so
this chronology was transcribed by a Kate fanatic. Surprised? -- AM)


September, 1980

     Kate promotes the forthcoming album (_Never_For_Ever_) in Germany
and France. In Germany she performs the famous "Mrs. Mop" version of
"Army Dreamers" (on the programme _RockPop_), one of three quite
different visual presentations that Kate prepared for the song.
     Back in London, Kate attends a concert by Stevie Wonder. The
effect is profound, and on the following day Kate puts down the first
full demo version of "Sat In Your Lap", the key to her next album,
_The_Dreaming_.


September 8, 1980

     _Never_For_Ever_ is released. Kate undertakes a very heavy
promotional schedule.


September 11, 1980

     The album's head is wetted at a huge party for dealers in
Birmingham. Kate is meanwhile engaged in a personal appearance tour,
signing albums in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester
(where she kissed over 600 fans), Birmingham and London (where the
queue awaiting her stretched over 100 yards outside the record shop
and down Oxford Street).


September 16, 1980

     The album _enters_ the official chart at number 1. Kate Kate is
the first British solo female artist ever to _reach_ the number 1
position on the British album charts.


September 22, 1980

     "Army Dreamers", the third single from _Never_For_Ever_, is
released.


October, 1980

     Kate resumes writing and making demos for the next album.


October 4, 1980

     Kate is voted Best Female Singer in the _Melody_Maker_ poll for
the third consecutive year.

for the long-delayed "December Will Be Magic Again" single), Kate
leaves for the Netherlands and Germany to make more promotional
television appearances. She gives lip-synch performances of both "Army
Dreamers" and "Babooshka".
     Kate moves on to Italy for a song festival, at which she again
performs "Babooshka".


November, 1980

     Kate writes an article for the magazine _Woman's_World_, entitled
"How Can You Eat Dead Animals"?
     Meanwhile she returns to the studio to record the single version
of "December Will Be Magic Again".


November 17, 1980

     "December Will Be Magic Again" is released. No promotional video
is made for this single.
     Kate is working with Peter Gabriel. They record a new version of
Roy Harper's song "Another Day", for a projected single. They also
attempt to co-write a song for the b-side, and a song called "Ibiza"
results. (Note: PFM spells this "Ibizza", but this is probably an
error.  "Ibiza" is the spelling for the Spanish coastal resort town.)
They are not satisfied with it, however, and the project is shelved.


November 25, 1980

     Kate appears on the BBC TV chat programme
_The_Russell_Harty_Show_ for an edition dedicated to the composer
Frederick Delius.  She is interviewed with the cellist Julian Lloyd
Webber and Delius's assistant and collaborator Eric Fenby. Following a
screening of part of Kate's _Dr._Hook_Special_ video of "Delius",
Fenby suggests that the composer would have seen it as "a very
gracious tribute."


December, 1980

     "Babooshka", which, outside the U.K., has been the lead single
from _Never_For_Ever_, is an international hit, reaching "top ten"
status in most countries in Europe, as well as Australia and Canada.
Kate's music has still made little impact in the United States,
however.  Her second and third albums have not even been released
there, although a small but fiercely devoted cult following cause a
vigorous trade in imports.
     Meanwhile Kate tapes an extensive interview at her home for an
American (possibly Canadian? -- AM) television production company
which is preparing a series of programmes entitled _Profiles_in_Rock_,
with interviewer Doug Pringle.


December 30, 1980

     The first of two special forty-five minute programmes is
broadcast on BBC Radio 1, in which Kate plays and discusses with DJ
Paul Gambaccini some of her favourite music by other artists.  This
programme is devoted to traditional and classical favourites.


December 31, 1980

     The second forty-five minute programme is aired over BBC Radio 1,

artists.

three songs are put down before Nick Launay takes over as engineer. In
a session that lasts until the end of June more backing tracks are
laid.
     Kate is tempted by the offer for her to play the Wicked Witch in
the Children's TV series _Worzel_Gummidge_, but she is already too far
involved in the album and has to turn down the offer.

success..." (Sunie, _Record_Mirror_)


July 27, 1982

     The single "The Dreaming" is released to excellent music press
reviews suluting Kate's creative courage. The single is stifled,
however, by the radio producers and presenters, particularly on BBC
Radio 1, who will not play it. The plans for a twelve-inch version are
aborted.


August 1982

     Despite no daytime airplay on Radio 1, "The Dreaming" enters the
singles chart, but peaks at number 48.

Garden Piazza to be interviewed briefly about her new album.


September 13, 1982

     The album _The_Dreaming_ is released. Written, arranged and
produced by Kate around the rhythm box and the Fairlight CMI.  The
radio programmers and most of the British reviewers are mystified.
The album demands more of them than they can give.


September 14, 1982

     Kate makes a personal appearance at the Virgin Megastore in
London's Oxford Street. The queue again exceeds 100 yards in length.
     Kate procedes by train to Manchester, using a specially cleared
goods car to rehearse for a video for the next single. In Manchester

Gaffa" is released in all other territories. "Tenner" is the "lost
single".  It is not promoted and gains no airplay on radio. It is the
only single of Kate's not to enter the official chart. "Suspended in
Gaffa" is, however, a great success, going top ten in most European
countries and in Canada &lt;? Top ten?&gt; and Australia.


November 13, 1982

     EMI-America releases _The_Dreaming_ album, which enters the
_Billboard_ Top 200, the first of Kate's albums to do so. The album
begins to get a crop of very good U.S. reviews praising its
creativity.  The album is pushed by spots on U.S. college radio, and
towards the end of the year airplay begins to pick up. Kate begins to
expand her small cult folloing in the U.S. to attract a wider
audience.


1983

January 1983

     _The_Dreaming_ is in the top ten of "U.S. progressive radio
stations" for 1982. &lt;Is this a _Billboard_ chart listing, or just a
guess by PFM?&gt;
     Kate is under great pressure to tour to make up for the lack of
obvious single success in the U.K. A tour is in fact very seriously
considered, but finally not pursued. Kate decides that she will, after
some time off, press on with another album.


May 1982

     Kate's book _Leaving_My_Tracks_ is shelved indefinitely.


June 15, 1983

     EMI-America releases an eponymous mini-album of five tracks (six
in Canada) to continue the momentum in the U.S.A. At the last moment a
scheduled promotional tour by Kate of the U.S.  is cancelled, due to
engine failure on the Queen Elizabeth II.  &lt;And, obviously, Kate's
unwillingness to consider alternative means of transportation!&gt;
     Realisation of a long-planned project begins with the
construction of Kate's own full standard studio, initially equipped
with 24 tracks, then expanded to 48. Construction and equipping is to
take six months.


July 1983

     The U.S. mini-album enters the Billboard Top 200.
     "Ne T'enfuis pas" (coupled with "Un Baiser d'enfant") is released
in France and Canada.


August 1983

     Attempt by Conifer, a leading record importer, to release "Ne
T'enfuis pas" in the U.K. This is prevented by EMI, but leads to
ill-founded speculation that Kate is to be dropped by the company.


September 1983

     Kate begins some writing and demoing for the next album.


November 1983

     To continue the buzz in the U.S., EMI conceive the idea of
touring the _Live_at_Hammersmith_Odeon_ video around the American
colleges. 32 venues are set up, with a competition for the college
radio programmers for the best presentation. The prize will be a trip
to the U.K. to interview Kate. One college hires an art gallery and
combines the event with a wine tasting. Another invites 700 guests,
including the local state Senator, and the then Speaker of the House
of Representatives "Tip" O'Neil. The debut date of the tour is held on
the fourth floor of the Danceteria in New York, where the College
Media Society are meeting.


November 21, 1983

     "Night of the Swallow" is released as a single in Eire.


December 1983

     _The_Single_File_ video compilation is released. Kate makes
personal appearances in Kingston and Holborn.


1984

January 1984

     The new studio being more or less ready, Kate begins work on her
fifth album, directly demoing the songs and building on the original
demo rather than re-recording.


January 16, 1984

     Kate helps launch the Sky Channel, the first satellite TV station
in the U.K.


January 23, 1984
     _The_Single_File_ box set of singles is released, further
fuelling rumours that Kate is to leave EMI.
     EMI-America release _Lionheart_ and _Never_For_Ever_, and begin a
heavy back-catalogue promotion under the theme "Looking Back to See
Ahead".


February 1984

     _The_Single_File_ video is the best selling music video in the
U.K. for two weeks.


March 1984

     _Lionheart_ enters the Billboard Top 200 in the U.S.


June 1984

     Kate begins overdubs -- which have become the biggest job in
Kate's recording process -- on the new album. This time overdubs and
mixing will last nearly 12 months.

June 1985

     Kate's fifth album _Hounds_of_Love_ is completed.


August 1985

     Kate appears on the BBC TV programme _Wogan_ to perform "Running
Up That Hill". The single is released the same day, two years and ten
months after the flop of "There Goes a Tenner".  Media attention and
airplay is immediate. A twelve-inch version of the single is released
-- Kate's first use of that format.
     In the U.S. EMI-America organise a large convention of regional
sales representatives in New Orleans to prepare for their largest
attempt to break Kate in the American market.


August 13, 1985

     "Running Up That Hill" enters the British singles chart at number
9. It garners enormous airplay and critical acclaim.  It peaks at
number 3 and is Kate's biggest single success since "Wuthering
Heights", far exceeding "Babooshka" in sales.
     In the U.S. the cable music channel MTV shy away from using the
promotional video for "Running Up That Hill", considering it to be too
erotic. &lt;This is absolute nonsense. They obviously didn't like it
because Kate didn't do any lip-synching and because it wasn't garish
enough for their horrid, smarmy, miserable format.&gt; Instead they use
the _Wogan_ performance. It remains on moderate rotation for two
months.


August 22, 1985

     Kate appears on _Top_of_the_Pops_ for the first time since 1978,
performing "Running Up That Hill".

     "Running Up That Hill" is a massive international hit, being top
ten in most of Europe, Australia and Canada.

York news programme _Live_at_Five_, and tapes an interview for later

interviews. She is also interviewed by Love-Hound |&gt;oug Alan.
     A track from the new album, "Hello Earth", is featured as
background music for a scene in the then-top-rated U.S. TV series
_Miami_Vice_.
     From New York, Kate travels to Toronto where she tapes another

various Canadian programmes, including the evening news to
_Much_Music_, _The_New_Music_ and _Good_Rockin'_Tonite_.
