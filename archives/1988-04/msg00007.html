   i don't think the question is whether kate has a melodius, passionate,
or powerful voice (although she screeches like hell) , but whether she is
innovative in the use of her vocal talents (or lack thereof). the answer
here must be 'yes'; she makes noise in a most dinstinctive style, which in
and of itself deserves recognition in _this_ age of music (or lack thereof

Nim, while you might be amusing and interesting on Politics,
you have absolutely NO taste in MUSIC.  The Alarm is one of THE
MOST BORING, repetitious, stadium-oriented bands to pose under

the popularity of U2 (without whom they would have FADED into
the OBSCURITY they so RICHLY deserve LONG AGO.)--
And they didn't even play "The Stand".  *hmph*

You've got to be kidding me!  Two no talent, absolute garbage acts!
ANd you say KATE can't sing?  Why don't you all just admit that you
are wimpy little faggots who can't stand to hear REAL vocal
performances.  Admit you can't understand the words.  ADmit you have
absolutely NO FUCKING IDEA as to what she's talking about and don't
like it even if you did.  Admit you have small weenie minds that
can't accept that someone out there is smarter than you.  That's
what it boils down to.  I have no idea, really, what Kate's song
"Suspended in Gaffa" is about and it drives me nuts!  But I love
it anyway!  I'd much rather listen to something that makes me think
a bit instead of some whiny brained imitative and highly derivative
brat (ie: mike peters of the Alarm) singing stuff that is so OBVIOUS
it makes me want to gag.  As for the Alarm7's so called concert,
it was pretty hilarious when Peters went out into the audience and
lambasted the radio in 1988 for having "no guts, no fire" when he
is the NUMBER ONE CRIMINAL in that respect!!!  What delicious irony!

Why is it that so many people like to label "music" with incoherent lyrics
and lame, if any, harmonic qualities as "avant-garde" or "thought-provoking"
or any other term to denote something deep and meaningful?  If I write a
program to spew random sentences but make sure there's something anti-
establishment every once in a while, would that be deep and meaningful?
No, it would just be babble.

Bush's so-called songs. It is utter gibberish that only appeals to
"intellectual" snobs like Shockeye because they can't understand (there

yes, those who claim to be smart because they can analyze the song in their
english-major heads...  if it weren't for kate bush and their other art-fag
interests, where would they be able to show off their extensive vocabulary.
i mean, it must be so fun to pretend to be intellectual and discuss the
meaning of kate's lyrics...is it any wonder that most kate-followers
are english majors?

'well, i believe that in this song kate is trying to express the feeling
of being rammed up the butt, which her screeching emphasises...  and the
blah-blah symbolizes a (adjective) (adjective) (adjective) (noun) (verb)

I think the issue here is not lack of inteligence of non-Kate fans,
but closed-mindedness. Kate is different. Kate's music is very
intricate and complex. It is very easy to write her off as shit
if you don't REALLY listen, and become familiar with her depth.
There is just to much to accept at one time. Many repeated
listenings are necessary. I was a devout Kate-hater for a long
time. The first time I heard "The Man With the Child in His Eyes",
I thought it sounded like The Carpenters.
   The point is, Kate is very much an aquired taste. In my opinion,
it is one which is very much worth aquiring.

As I seem to recall, it was I who introduced you to Jarre's music.
And don't insult him by giving him a girl's name.  It's spelled
"Jean-Michel", where "Michel" is the french equivalent of "Michael".
The way you have it works out to "Michelle".

Whether or not Metallica tackles "big" subjects in their lyrics is
not as important to me as the style in which these subjects are
presented.  Any yokel can sing about that stuff, but to do it well...
Ah, that's a different subject entirely.  The Great Witch Goddess
(and I'll continue to call her that regardless, for that she is,
and so she shall remain) has mastered the trick - check out the lyrics
to "Breathing" - the same old anti-nuke stuff but rendered from the
point of view of a child not yet born.  Dead brill.

And Ellid, it was indeed Dolly Parton that Peter Gabriel wanted for
"Don't Give Up".  I don't think Kate particularly suits that tune,
myself.  There is a much better duet between the two of them in "Another
Day" - widely available on bootlegs everywhere.

   I hear all the time from the "art-fags" that if one
   listens to music that a lot of people throughly enjoy
   like Top 40 or what not, then you have no culture,
    taste, raison d'etre. Well maybe it hasn't even occurred
    to them that maybe, just maybe, it's good.
        "Art-fags" tend to be a ludricrous as MENUDO, who
    kick out band members after the age of 16.

    A similar bunch of elitists are the "progressive-rockers"
    who are into "Genesis","Rush","ELP" etc. Who always likes
    to argue who is the best drummer, best guitarist etc.
    I don't think that these dinosaurs are too much better then
    the typical elite artfag music that spew out onto the airwaves.

     It is not criticism of these bands, which I like, not because
     the have the best guitarist or keyboardist, that I'm getting at.
     It's the attitude that well I listen to "high quality" progressive
