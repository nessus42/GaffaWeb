     Recommended: Miharu Koshi, _Echo_de_Miharu_ (Japanese-only CD).
                       A collection of cover versions by Koshi,
                       this CD includes novelty tunes by Mozart and Verdi
                       as well as some great arias like "How Much
                       Is That Doggie in the Window?", all arranged
                       and produced by Koshi and Haruomi Hosono with
                       Fairlight CMI IIIs, etc., in Hosono's eccentric
                       all-synthetic style. There is also a new song by
                       Koshi herself, sounding much as she did on
                       her self-penned albums _Tutu_ and _Parallelisme_.
                       Note: A second Koshi CD is available, called
                       (appropriately enough!) _Boy_Soprano_. A report
                       on it will appear when the disk finally arrives.

     Gary Numan: _Telekon_/_I, Assassin_.
                      This is the last of the long-promised series
                      of CD reissues of Numan's older releases,
                      comprising nearly all the tracks from his
                      fourth and sixth albums. _Telekon_ marks the
                      final statement in Numan's second style, which
                      is typified by his two biggest hits, "Are Friends
                      Electric" and "Cars". Its only clear stylistic
                      departure from the earlier albums _Replicas_ and
                      _The Pleasure Principle_ is in its rhythm sound:
                      the drums are tuned and recorded for a bit more
                      presence and depth. _I, Assassin_ is the first
                      of the white funk-influenced albums which evolved
                      out of the experimental (and probably the best)
                      fifth LP, _Dance_. All of Numan's albums since
                      _I, Assassin_ (four to date, not counting the two
                      live double-LP sets which have appeared since
                      _Berserker_, or the twenty or more non-LP
                      tracks since 1983) are little more than
                      solidifications (not to say petrifications)
                      of the _I, Assassin_ style, so much so that they
                      now represent a more or less "corporate" Numan
                      sound.
                           An interesting detail: This CD's four-month
                      delay is now apparently explained -- it runs
                      to more than _78_ minutes, which, though not
                      a record, still must have taken some creative
                      planning. (There's supposed to be an 80+ minute
                      CD out by Mission of Burma, and an 83-minute CD
                      is already underway, too. If they'd only find a
                      cheap way to press both sides we could have
                      2 1/2-hour programs on individual disks. But by
                      then Philips will probably have put their
                      erasable CD on the market.)

-- Andrew Marvick

   (who does not mean to suggest that the music of Koshi and Numan can
   be compared with Kate Bush's music, or even that it's paticularly
   good -- he just thought somebody ought to at least acknowledge their
   existence, since no serious attention has ever been given to either by
   the American press. Speaking of which, when's the last time you saw
   an article on Tony Mansfield, Peter Godwin, Data, Gina Kikoine, Krisma,
   Polyrock, Susan, Sandii, Sandra, Telex, or Jacqui Brookes?)
