Radio station KFJC's "The Ninth Wave - a Kate Bush Special" aired from
8-12 p.m. on May 19th from the Foothill College campus in Los Altos,
California.

There was really not much new here.  The four hours consisted of
Kate's songs in a more-or-less chronological order, with emphasis on
B-sides or live versions to give the listener "something new."

Out of the four hours, the only new thing I heard was the live version
of "Breathing" from the Comedy Relief album.  There were also some
bits of Kate interviews interspersed with the songs, mostly talking
about the song just played or music in general.  A copy of each of
Kate's albums were given away over the course of the program.

Myself and some other Love-Hounders called into the DJ (named Holden
Caufield - J.D. Salinger lives) often to correct him or give him
additional information.  He had somebody else with him in the studio
who was more knowledgeable about Kate than himself, so one wonders why
he was hosting the special.  He said he had been a fan of Kate's for
only a couple of years, and was not too familiar with her earlier
works.

Not much happened. except for the shock value of hearing "Leave It
Open" coming across the airwaves...
