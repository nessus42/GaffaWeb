Someone asked about Colourbox recently; here's what I know about
what they've released:

"Breakdown"  12" b/w "Tarantula"   (version I -- out of print)
"Breakdown"  12" b/w "Tarantula"   (version II)
Mini LP (no title but it contains "Keep on Pushin'" and "Nation")
self titled LP
self titled LP packaged with extra disk  (Canadian pressing)
"Moon is Blue" 12" b/w  "Keep Me Hangin' On" (*)
"Punch" 12" b/w ?? plus another version of "Keep on Pushin'" (*)
"Say You" 12" b/w ?? (*)
"Baby I Love You So" 12" b/w "Looks Like We're Shy One Horse" + ??
"The Official Colourbox World Cup Theme"  12" b/w second version of
   the same + "Philip Glass"

(*) -- These songs are remixes of tracks from the self titled LP.

Some of the 12" stuff is/was available on 7" 45's but I haven't tried
to collect them so I know very little about that.  Also Colourbox has
a very nice song on the 4AD collection "Lonely Is an Eyesore" called
"Hot Doggy".  There is also a weird Canadian double 12" out with
remixes of 4 songs from the self titled album.  It's on the
Polydor/Vertigo label but I don't remember the songs as I'm at work
and the records are home...  Since this is from memory I could easily
have missed something.  Corrections and/or additions welcomed.

Two more things I just remembered, there was a Canadian
(Polydor/Vertigo) cassette tape of Colourbox songs that came out
recently.  It wasn't the self titled album, but had a bunch of songs
from it.  Sort of a "greatest hits" type thing.  I only saw it once
and didn't get the stock number.  Anyone else know anything about the
beast?  The paper in the cassette case was black with white
lettering.  While we're on the subject, what's the deal with Canada
and Colourbox?  Why does Polydor/Vertigo put out extra material for a
British band??  I'm glad they do, but it does seem odd...  The second
thing is that Steve and Martin Young of Colourbox were part of
M/A/R/R/S (now defunct I believe) that produced "Pump Up the Volume".

One last thing -- I've also gotten my hands on (thank you John...) a
copy of a US promo release of the Breakdown 12".  It claims to be the
second version but is quite different.
