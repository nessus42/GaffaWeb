 STOP PRESS:
 ^^^^^^^^^^

     The latest issue of _Homeground_ includes one highly significant
bit of information. According to their more or less inside informants,
Kate intends to film videos for the _first_three_ singles _before_
releasing the album.
     If _that's_ not a strong indicator that Kate plans to mount a
TOUR OF LIFE II, IED doesn't know what is. (OK, maybe an announcement
by Kate with a list of venues and dates might be stronger, but this is
Kate Bush we're talking about here, not Michael Jackson. You gotta use
your imagination.)

      [	Come, come now, IED!  We all know that Kate will never ever
	again do a live tour and that hoping and planning for one will
	lead to nothing other than depair and the shattering of all of
	one's hopes and dreams.  On the other hand, if Kate should
	perchance ever just happen to do another tour, won't it be a
	pleasant little surpise?

	Now, back to the issue of Kate making the videos in advance.
	What this means is that last time around, the record company
	must have pointed out that the timing of singles caused by
	Kate's delays in making the videos, was awful.  For example,
	in the US, the record company wanted to follow up the success
	of "Running up that Hill" with "Hounds of Love".  But there
	was no video.  They released it without the video, but it went
	no where.  Finally, when the video was ready, EMI-America
	had already given up on it.  -- |&gt;oug ]

&gt;  Subject: Mainly non-musical I fear

&gt;     Well I did not see anything on May 1st! Oh, it means something
&gt; different to you guys. Being an ignorant limey I had to go and look
&gt; this up.

     Sorry about that. (By the way, the above unsigned message IED
assumes was from Neil Calton?) Over here Labor Day falls usually about
September 1.

&gt; Do you mean that only news of it will come or that the actual small
&gt; black piece of plastic will appear?

     IED was being cautious, hence the hedging phrase "news of a new
single". As a matter of fact, his prophesy has already been fulfilled.
In the new issue of _Homeground_ (of which more later) which IED just
received yesterday, Peter, Krys and Dave announce that a new single
and/or album should appear before year's end.  If you call that
"news", IED is safe. IED, however, is a bit more optimistic than
_Homeground_, and hereby sticks his neck out and says that a release
date for a new single will be announced by the end of September.

      [	If we recall the days of yore, there has alwas been a period
	when all announcements have said that the album will be out in
	six months.  This period has lasted for up to a year and a
	half.  I'll start believing things when I see an announcement
	for a single in two weeks.  -- |&gt;oug ]

&gt; Does anyone know of a forthcoming collaborative project featuring
&gt; Kate? I was on the phone the other day with the radio on in the
&gt; background. I vaguely heard the DJ mentioning a long list of names
&gt; when suddenly Kate's name was mentioned. Naturally, the ever present
&gt; KT daemon in my head immediately swapped my attention over to the
&gt; radio, but the only other name I heard was Dave Wakelin (of the
&gt; Beat) and no mention of what the project was. Frustrating in the
&gt; extreme!

Sounds pretty straightforward: _She's_Having_a_Baby_ is being released
in the U.K., and you heard an announcement about the soundtrack album.
Dave Wakeling (also of General Public, btw) recorded the title track,
and Kate's song _This_Woman's_Work_ is also included.  She did not
collaborate with anyone on that project, however.

&gt; Anyway, it is good to have Love-Hounds back after a long absence.

Hear, hear!

&gt; I trust Eddie is fully recovered. I was beginning to believe that
&gt; the non-arrival of Love-Hound bulletins was somehow connected with
&gt; the arrival on my desk of a brochure featuring on its front cover a
&gt; blue pentagram with the letters IED in the middle, advertising the
&gt; 1988 UK IT Conference. Surely a misprint for KT I thought!
&gt; Unfortunately, it really was IT. However, I am sure the "other" IED
&gt; will one day come over and reclaim the moniker that has been usurped
&gt; by these English wastrels and chair a KT conference.  Will the real
&gt; IED please stand up?

     IED makes no proprietary claim to the initials, but he _would_
enjoy chairing a KT conference in the UK. Do you know of any institutions
that might be willing to foot the travel expenses?
