PART ONE

	I recently came across two works of John Carder Bush.  I was
able to obtain a copy of one as follows:

	Bush, John Carder, "Control:  A translation", Rushden,
	   Northamptonshire, Eng.:  Sceptre Pr., 1974.

	        When God comes at me
		do I bow the stallion's legs
		or meet him with flared nostrils?

		When Man comes at me
		do I rein in the stallion,
		or let him meet the hooves?

		When Woman comes at me
		do I let her take the bridle,
		or turn away the head?

		When Animal comes at me
		the stallion stalls at simplicity:
		I cannot make him face attack.

		When I come at me
		the stallion bolts:
		I find him nuzzling the reflecting water.

		When I
		and stallion
		blend
		the grass gets cropped.

	I was unable to obtain a copy of another work.  Perhaps someone
out there could post it?  It's only a couple of pages.

	Bush, John Carder, "The Creation Edda:  A poem", Frensham,
	   Surrey, Eng.:  Sceptre Pr., 1970.

	Libraries with copies:  UCLA
			        Harvard
			        SUNY @ Buffalo

-------------------------
PART TWO

	While in England a few months ago, I FINALLY made a pilgrimage
to Welling-East Wickham (home of Our Lady of Song, or at least her
parents).  Not wishing to be an obnoxious geek fan, a clicked off a
few shots of East Wickham Farm, then walked around Fanny-on-the-Hill,
Plumstead Cemetary, and Bostall Woods.

	When I got off the train at Welling, a woman and a girl also
got off.  By their relative ages, I assumed the girl was the woman's
granddaughter.  Maybe it was my state-of-mind, but the woman looked
like Hannah Bush, Kate's mum.  I've only seen a couple of pictures of
her, but this looked like her.  But I couldn't place the girl.

	So here's the question: Are Jay or Paddy married?

		[ I don't think Paddy is married.  John is married and
		  has children.  -- |&gt;oug ]

It had never occurred to me before, but they're certainly old enough.

-------------------------
PART THREE

	Finally got a copy of "Kate Bush Complete".  Who writes out
the scores?  I recall Kate saying that she rarely writes out her
songs, but plays it by ear.  So are these the product of someone
listening to them over and over and over...?
