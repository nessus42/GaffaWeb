&gt;
&gt;Hiya Karen,
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to be a nuisance &amp; I don't want to make a habit of this sort of
&gt;thing, but I'm finding it absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to get anything to
&gt;appear in rec.music.gaffa - I used to be able to up until March (if
&gt;briefly), and then no more - I would be most grateful if you could pass
&gt;on the following for others to read, perhaps, if you would be so kind?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
&gt;Mike H
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;Greetings Kate worshippers,
&gt;
&gt;[**and if you've seen this before please excuse me for repeating
&gt;myself**]
&gt;
&gt;(As someone quite rightly pointed out that's godDESS, please try to get
&gt;the gender right chaps, though I know what you're trying to say.)
&gt;
&gt;I have been lurking on and off for a bit since my more recent messages
&gt;seemed to fail to get through (they did work once upon a time. Maybe
&gt;my software has forgotten how to do it properly) So this is also a test
&gt;of sorts.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;SNIPPET&gt;
&gt;This year Kate's birthday falls on a Wednesday, at which point she will
&gt;be 39 (eek!), although you can be sure she'll still look at least 8
&gt;years younger &amp; sexier than ever. (No chauvinism intended.)
&gt;&lt;/SNIPPET&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;MAIN&gt;
&gt;In response to the recent comparing of people's ages, it's worthy of
&gt;note that where the KBC newsletter often carries new pen-pal
&gt;announcements/introductions, the age of these persons (quoted in
&gt;brackets) is invariably in the range of 17 - 25, while 30+ is
&gt;comparatively rare.
&gt;
&gt;Myself being of an age where I had already started my second job when
&gt;Kate first burst upon the scene I find this all very pleasantly
&gt;surprising. Gosh, I mean to say there must be loads of you that have
&gt;completely missed out on that initial first time ever experience, almost
&gt;20 years ago, when out of nowhere we were suddenly &amp; heavily saturated
&gt;with KB (all down to EMI of course).
&gt;
&gt;I've been trying to remember who else was around at the time - in
&gt;England at any rate - Gary Neumann, The Pretenders certainly, and
&gt;Blondie of course (i.e. Debbie Harry), Gary Glitter was possibly still
&gt;hanging on, and we'd not long seen the last of The Bay City Rollers.
&gt;Punk was starting up. At this point however the UK charts were dominated
&gt;by ABBA. ABBA were always in the top 10 and seemed to have something new
&gt;every other week. They were never off the BBC's Top Of The Pops (this
&gt;long-running programme was starting to show its age even then).
&gt;
&gt;THEN, late one dark and dismal British Autumn, Capital Radio (serving
&gt;Greater London &amp; surrounds, &amp; still a very new station at that time)
&gt;began playing Wuthering Heights (this was nearly 3 months before the
&gt;actual release of the single in January '78). It was - baffling. Bizarre
&gt;&amp; quirky. Certainly got all our attention though. I never really took to
&gt;it immediately, mainly because Capital were playing rather too often. In
&gt;fact they were playing it to death. To be perfectly honest it was
&gt;getting on all our nerves.
&gt;
&gt;Eventually of course we got to see it performed on TOTP. Baffled again.
&gt;Personally I found the choreography embarrasing to watch at the time,
&gt;although I had to admire her courage for doing it. (I'm older &amp; wiser
&gt;now &amp; have learned to appreciate it more.) Best of all though she had
&gt;finally knocked ABBA off their perch with this thing, which was
&gt;generally appreciated by all.
&gt;
&gt;The one that did it for me though was The Man With The Child In His
&gt;Eyes. I came home from work one evening &amp; turned on Capital as usual. It
&gt;came up and my jaw hit the floor. Rushed out for the album - the rest,
&gt;as they say, is history...
&gt;
&gt;One lasting memory is watching her live on BBC's Saturday Night At The
&gt;Mill - she did 3 songs from TKI, one of which was Rolling The Ball -
&gt;captivating stuff. It would be nice to have kept a video of that, except
&gt;of course in those days you couldn't get a VCR for less than 600 pounds
&gt;(&gt;2mths salary before taxes for the poor civil servant that I was then).
&gt;
&gt;I felt there was something of a hiccup in '83 with The Dreaming, which I
&gt;didn't like at all, it was too different. Much later though I made a
&gt;determined effort to get into it more &amp; now it's one of my favourites,
&gt;although it still helps if I'm in the right mood for it.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;SNIPPET&gt;
&gt;I'm glad I turned it around like that because it was a few years later
&gt;when I found out that she had made herself quite ill while doing that
&gt;album. She was doing it all by herself, except she hadn't got her own
&gt;studio yet. Studio fees were anything up to 90 per hour (English pounds
&gt;that is), and it was taking so long that she kept running out of the
&gt;time booked for each one. At one point she could only get the use of one
&gt;in the South of France. It must have been all very stressful. Each night
&gt;she'd finally be thrown out of the studio at something like 11:30pm, but
&gt;snatching the tapes first to take them home and fiddle with them some
&gt;more until 3 or 4 in the morning, if not later. At the same time she was
&gt;trying to survive on a diet of little more than chocolate. She is quoted
&gt;as saying that it got to the point where she would wake up the next day
&gt;and simply not be able to move. (I could be completely wrong but I get a
&gt;strong feeling that something of this particular experience is hinted at
&gt;in Walk Straight Down The Middle.)
&gt;
&gt;She finally went to see daddy, who used to be a doctor, &amp; who was
&gt;horrified to see the state she was in. He diagnosed nervous exhaustion.
&gt;The album had long been finished but was not received well, &amp; she also
&gt;found she couldn't stand the noise &amp; bustle of London any more &amp; had to
&gt;move out. Not least because EMI were also after her saying (about TD)
&gt;"This isn't quite what we were expecting (i.e. it's crap); what else
&gt;have you got?" (unfeeling swine!).
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately for them she was in no fit state to do anything else for
&gt;at least 6 months. EMI were forced to change their minds in the end
&gt;though - the Americans loved TD. You still do, don't you?
&gt;&lt;/SNIPPET&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have been working on a short series of Windows desktop pictures if
&gt;anyone is interested. More details shortly (give me about 2 weeks or
&gt;so).
&gt;
&gt;I am attempting to send this message several different ways so if you
&gt;see several other copies then ignore them.
&gt;&lt;/MAIN&gt;
&gt;
