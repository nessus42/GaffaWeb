&gt;   In 1978, at the age of 27 I was watching Sat Night Live and the rest is
&gt; and has been history.  I audio taped the show (for the comedy) and had
&gt; that "treasure" until Katetopia came along.

My experience:
I am not really shure, I think it was in late 1987, I took a tape from the  
public library next to my school, It was HOL. I was 15/16 years old.
At this time, I was a fan of Mike Oldfield s music, but very diappointed  
about his works at this time.
Time to hear something new, I decided. Kate Bush was to me a known artist,  
Cloudbusting, HoL, RutH were present in the bavarian broadcasting service  
in the mid80ies.
But the 9th wave was totally different from what I exspected.

Then I saw TKI on Tape, and of course I took the tape and a adventure into  
my childhood began...some songs sounded pretty familiar, others did not  
but I liked them.

I would describe myself as a political thinking human being, and I think  
the new romance - approach is even more interesting than a plain protest  
song. AD on the NF ist to me are very impressive song, other songs contain  
political contents as well
And "Wuthering Heights" itself is political, because it is a protest  
against the role a woman had to play in the 19th century.

The Breathing ist to me a historical song of our time, it describes the  
angst people had in the early 80ies.


There would be more to tell,


but this time I have to end.
