&gt; I just wandered into your group this week, and I'm glad to see we're
&gt; all still here, this world of people who can't forget Kate when she
&gt; goes missing.
&gt;
&gt; I am 45.  Yes, way old.  And I first heard Kate after work one day in
&gt; early 1978, the day the Capitol Records rep laid her album (on
&gt; Harvest,
&gt; it was) on my desk with all the others that week.  It wasn't anything
&gt; Capitol was trying to push (dummies then, dummies now). I noted Dave
&gt; Gilmour's name and the presence of much of the Alan Parsons Project,
&gt; and I liked the cover.
&gt;
&gt; At home, I put it on and listened to it a couple of times, stunned as
&gt; that whole wonderful, colorful, emotional program played through.  I
&gt; thought I might have been hallucinating or something.  It was so
&gt; unexpectedly beautiful.  I fell in love, with this kid piano player.
&gt; She wrote the best love letters you could ever hope to read.  She sang
&gt;
&gt; like no one else.
&gt;
&gt; Kate's a phenomena, a comet, rare and bright.  And still, just a
&gt; person, simple like all of us.  Sure, I'd part with a month's salary
&gt; to
&gt; sit in a club, anywhere in the world, to hear her play in a trio,
&gt; solo,
&gt; whatever.  Sitting in an airport coffee shop to listen to her tap her
&gt; fingernails on the tabletop across from me would be a wild thrill.
&gt; But, she makes great records, and she doesn't want to tour.  C'est la
&gt; vie.
&gt;
&gt; That rush from "Kick" up through "The Dreaming" was breathtaking, and
&gt; like all truly fine things, she improves with age.  She's my favorite.
&gt;
&gt; I'll always be cheering for her, as she goes her own way.  Go, Kate!
&gt;

---Almost exactly my own feelings!
(OBTW would you believe I'm also a 45-year-old)
(Actually, I don't know if Kate's improving with age any more--in the
last 10 years. But I'll wait a little longer before making up my mind.
Or maybe it's time for a little career redirection. I think it'd be a
blast to see in a starring role in a full-length film. But that's
probably not her style.)
