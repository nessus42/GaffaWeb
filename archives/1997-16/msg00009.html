&gt; Well I'm a lurker also.  I got into Kate in 1984, when I was a freshman
in
&gt; college and heard  RUTH for the first time.  I also like Babooshka, which
&gt; seems to be on everyone most hated list.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm lucky enough to have a radio station in Philadelphia that will play
Kate
&gt; regularly.  WXPN for all other Philly people.  They probably play Kate 4
to 5
&gt; times a week which is pretty good considering that their is so much music
to
&gt; play.
&gt; 
&gt; And finally Leigh Perkins asked if anyone was a musician.  I play a
little
&gt; guitar, bass and keyboards, but I don't know if that makes me a musician 
:-)
&gt; 
&gt; Ken
&gt; 
Babooshka a "hated" song!?  Perish the thought.  It's one of the songs
(heard over the store sound system) that convinced me to buy my first Kate
album.

To this day definitely part of my top ten Kate songs.  Love the video too. 
And the poster.  Love the outfit. Make that both outfits. 

Kate in chain mail with a sword.  Kate in leotards with a bass violin.
Sigh!!!!!

And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before.
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady.
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him.
Just like his wife when she was beautiful.
He shouted out I'm

All yours Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka - ya ya
