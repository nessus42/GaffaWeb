In an earlier posting, Mark Semich said:
&gt;Every album she has released has been accompanied by reactions along the 
lines of, "What is *that*?,' "Too weird," "Nobody could ever like that," 
and "Just who does this woman think she is, anyways?"

I only wish Kate would release songs that were 'too weird.' I love Kate 
for her weirdness and creativity. It's just that lately she has been 
resorting to mediocre musical cliches. EtM is just too damn repetitive. I 
love the 5 bars or so that are endlessly repeated. And usually I can 
listen to a song hundreds of times before I get sick of it (in the case 
of KaTe, a few thousand). But in the course of EtM, she manages to get me 
_hating_ that phrase, just because there's nothing else to the song. 
Lyrically, EtM is simply not extraordinarily. This is the woman who wrote 
songs like 'Room for the Life', "Cloudbusting" and the album TD. Or who 
gave us the depth of TNW. Lyrics like 'A song of seeds, The food of love' 
are trite. Samantha Fox could have written these lyrics, for all their 
originality.

What it comes down to is that I love KaTe most when she's being her 
strangest. (BTW, Waking the Witch is one of my favorite songs). Every 
artist has her down days/down songs. Not all of TSW is bad, just like not 
all of TRS will be bad. KaTe just chose a mediocre song for the new 
single, which is all most of us can discuss right now for lack of advance 
copies (envy to those who have them). Nevertheless, bad KaTe is still 
KaTe. It is still better than 90% of the music out there. I just hold 
KaTe up to higher standards than I do, say, Madonna. (although even 
Madonna has some high quality songs...Just listen to most of Like A 
Prayer, the album)
