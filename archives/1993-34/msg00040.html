hello folks,

first time posting here!  = )  here it goes....

from The Network Forty/Sept 10, 1993

"Eat The Music"

To satisfy your appetite &amp; quench your thirst, Kate Bush
offers a sugary special advance CD-Pro in anticipation of
her upcoming release due in early January.  W/ a rhythmic
African flair, "ETM" is sweet sultry vocals w/ tribal 
sensations.  A horn section &amp; multiple backing vocals 
boisters a full-bodied sound.  In addition to the 1st single,
"BSL" is a passionate song indicative of her style.  &amp; 
somewhere in the world, Elton John will be cheering
Bush's version of "CITW".  KB is currently finishing
a film project she is starring in &amp; producing.

from The Hard Report/Sept. 10, 1993 - issue #342

(on cover running down right hand corner is their 
hot/new releases - "ETM" is pictured under "Triple 
Ace" (Adult Alternative Airplay/Albums)

on page 27 - AAA charts this review appears under 
the heading "Triple Ace"

Kate Bush, "Eat The Music". Columbia

The 1st single from the forthcoming KB album -- Wait a
minute!  There isn't 1 Triple A station out there that 
needs me to tell them about KB.  Let's face it, if KB 
isn't a staple artist on your station, you're in the
wrong format.  KB is always at her best, and this release 
is no exception.  WXPN's Mike Morrison agrees, "KB is an 
automatic for this format&gt;  From what I've heard from this 
record, it could be her best yet.  She is a core artist
for my station."  WMMM's Sybil McGuire is convinced,
"We all like Kate.  The lyrics are incredible.  Talk about 
sexy!  And all that fruit on the cover!  It's got a nice 
techno beat, but it's not so techno that it's too much for 
Triple A."   

(accompanied by a small black &amp; white photo of the EP cover)

note that other artists on the AAA chart:  U2 (#1), 
Tim Finn (#2), The Story (#5), Sweet Relief (#15), Squeeze
(#23), Pete Townsend (#29), Los Lobos (#33), Cranberries (#35),
Jane Siberry (#37), and Happy Rhodes (#50) &lt;--  HEY VICKIE!!!
(on their Focus AAA, Happy is listed #43 up from #47 last wk)

also listed on page 61 --

KB's 7th album, "TRS", has been confirmed for an October 4th
release via EMI.  Guests on the album include NIGEL KENNEDY,
ERIC CLAPTON, JEFF BECK, &amp; PROCOL HARUM's GARY BOOKER and 
British comedian LENNY HENRY.  Henry sings a section of 
"WSILY", which was co-written &amp; produced by Bush &amp; PRINCE.  The
full track listing for the album is as follows: "RBG" (Bush's
new single), "And So Is Love", "ETM", "Moments Of Pleasure",
"Song Of Solomon", "Lily", "TRS", "Top Of The City", 
"Constellation Of The Heart", "BSL", "Why Should I Love You",
and "You're The One".

and for Vickie &amp; other Happy fans.... 

page #30 of the same trade magazine...

Happy Rhodes, "RhodeSongs," Aural Gratification

If you were unfamilar w/ HR prior to release of "Equipoise,"
here's your chance to catch up.  "RhodeSongs" includes a little 
something from all of Happy's past releases, plus some previously
unreleased acoustic versions. WMMM's Sybil McGuire commented, "HR
is one of our favorite artists.  Big, huge, enormous David Bowie 
fans are not going to like the cover of 'Ashes to Ashes,' but we 
think it's incredible.  Happy's vocal range is amazing.  She has 
got the most deep, resonant voice, &amp; then she stretches her 
range all the way up there.  When it sounds like KB is singing, 
it's HR.  We're hoping she can come &amp; do an unplugged for us in
the studio."  WNCW's Greg Hils added, "Usual, mystifying stuff.  
It's really great to see some acoustic versions because they're
just as mystifying."

now some info re: TRS --

from the special advance copy (which hopefully becomes mine 
after the rock music director listens to it!!!!  they're having
fun taunting me w/ it!!! = (  )

"Ordinary words cannot describe the artisty of KB.  Ever since 
her breakthrough in 1978 w/ the hugh international hit "Wurthering
Heights," Kate has done nothing short of dazzel &amp; amaze, &amp; reinvent
what we might call rock music, especially rock music so daringly
created by a woman.  W/ every release, Kate has nurtured her sound,
her talents, making music so astonishingly refreshing &amp; new that 
it simpl overwhelms the listener.

Kate's 1st release for Columbia Records was 1990's "TSW."  That
release feaatured the hits "L&amp;A" &amp; "TSW", and the album was a 
#1 alternative record.  The "L&amp;A" video was an MTV Buzz Bin clip.

"TRS" is the title of Kate's latest project.  Written &amp; produced by 
Kate herself in her private studio, "TRS" is Kate's most personal
record to date.  Taking nearly 3 &amp; 1/2 years to make, it is a 
brilliant piece of music.

Kate has also spent a good part of the summer on 1993 making a 
film based on "TRS," called "The Line, The Cross, The Curve."
The film will contain 6 videos for these songs on the album:
"ETM", "TRS", "ASIL", "Lily", "MOP", and "RRG".


the cassette was black with the red shoes (see back cover of
"ETM" CD) image.  the listing of songs went as the above
Hard report mentioned.  

IMHO (after only listening to the tracks once - before they
pry it out of my fingers -- needless to say lots 'o clawing
went on....)  my favorites were: "MOP", "SOS", "Lily", "TRS",
"BSL" and "TOTC" -- w/ "MOP", "Lily", &amp; "TRS".  

w/ the "ETM" &amp; "RBG" controversy raging, my .02  -- "ETM" 
wasn't that good, but it tends to grow on U - either that or 
it just sounded better framed within the other tracks.  "RBG" 
would be the more ideal US release so I don't know why they 
picked "ETM"???   beats me.  "ETM" isn't what our "rock" 
programming would play &amp; that's where she's always aired in 
the past.  I don't think it is much of an "alternative" 
release -- meaning college rock/alternative (Cure, Smiths,
Curve...) station.

and again -- all of this is my opinion.  so please be nice
I'm new here!!  = )


well, that's it.  hope I haven't driven everyone loony. sorry
it was so long, next time it won't be that way!  ; )

peace,

suzanne
