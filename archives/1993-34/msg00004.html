&gt; 48 seconds... that's all Paul King showed of the new Rubberband Girl video on
&gt; MTV First Look. Why didn't they show the complete thing? Why? WHY?!???

The first 3 mins were shown on The ITV Chart Show in the UK on Saturday.

&gt; Now to the video: Kate looks great, she's dancing with some male dancer

Stewart Arnold, I think - he's supposed to be in the film, and the
video is part of the film.

&gt; But it's true. No. It's not enough: She looks gorgeous! In the background
&gt; a lot of musicians play a various mixture of instruments, as far as I could
&gt; see Prince was not inbetween them, even if he was audible on BVs and guitar
&gt; in the 48 seconds they showed. Well, probably Prince was too busy with his

The musicians: there's a brass section of four, three guitarists, a
bassist and a drummer (mostly out of shot). I didn't recognise any of
them.

I don't think Prince had any direct involvment with this track -
still sounds as if he influenced it though. I think all the bvs could
actually be KaTe.

&gt; Actually the male dancer behind her leads her arms and legs through the dance.
&gt; Almost like if Kate were a GIRL puppet fixed with some RUBBERBAND to him.

Yes, for the first verse or so, Stewart (assuming it is he) is holding
KaTe's arms and they perform the same steps in unison. Then, when KaTe
sings "When I step out...", he collapses on the floor and she steps
over his arm. Then they do a more physical sequence involving a bit of
falling over and rolling on the floor. The choreography is
remininscent of the RutH video, with maybe a little of the Them Heavy
People vid too.

Starting from the beginning, the whole video seems to be set in the
dance studio shown in the RbG cover art.The musicians are standing
around at the sides of the studio, and KaTe and the male dancer walk
in to shot in front of them as the camera pans and wheels above the
studio.  KaTe is wearing a grey top, baggy dark blue sweat pants (I
think that's what you call 'em), a black cardigan and something else
tied round her waist (must be a cold studio 8-). No straightjackets to
be seen! Her hair looks as if she's just washed it. She never looks
directly at the camera (this is supposed to be a proper movie after
all), nor does she smile much.

During the instrumental break, there is a slow-motion sequence of KaTe
boucning on an out-of-shot trampoline. Then all the guitarists parade
in front of the camera, one of them pretends to do the solo bit....and
then we cut to the next video.....

Anybody seen the Eat the Music video yet? (I presume there is one?)

Chart news: RbG has entered the Gallup singles chart at #12 and the
MRIB chart at #7. Going to be bigger than Rocket Man anyway...we could
be talking about TotP appearances...
