hello again!  = )

shorter post this time.

Ian (the rock director) said that while he was talking
w/ his Sony rep she had mention they were reconsidering
the US release date for TRS - this time in November.  = )
(previously he told me they had moved it to Jan., didn't
believe him til I read it on Gaffa - the entire station 
likes to taunt me about KaTe &amp; assorted KaTe items).

I rather believe him.  He said she'd let him know if they
decided to move the release date up - she also mentioned 
the CD was done BUT not why they decided to release it
in Jan., did Ian say it had something to do w/ the video???
can't remember.

anyways, as soon as I learn more I'll post (unless someone
beats me to it.  = )


also, we had the CD come in -- just forgot the bands name --&gt;
male/female - she was in This Mortal Coil, needle droped
&amp; remember thinking rather nice (unfortuantely,  do a 
jazz shift sooooo I won't be able to play it) and was hoping 
another would come in.....

peace,

suzanne
