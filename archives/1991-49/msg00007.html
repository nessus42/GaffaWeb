&gt; What, how could you possibly know?  Listen, Jim, I'm a doctor
&gt;not a computer program.  We've gotta get out of here...

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; No need to rush, there is exactly 43.2 minutes remaining until
&gt;the scheduled beam-out point. 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?  I'M SUPPOSED TO BE RESCUING
&gt;YOU!  Jim, what's going on? 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;Brace yourself, Bones, we are not only back in time but we have
&gt;traveled to an alternative universe.  

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; Not this again, as if being stuck in a computer system isn't
&gt;bad enough.  Does Spock have a beard in this universe, too? 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;No, he doesn't.  In this universe and this time we are not real
&gt;people but are characters in a TV show.  There are many other
&gt;differences as well...

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; I'm a doctor, not a blender!!

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes: 
&gt;What was that? 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; Oh... ah, nothing.
 
&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;Well, as you know we had accidently traved through a portal back
&gt;in time and into this universe while beaming down to a planet. 
&gt;Our consiousness's were placed into a computer system entitled
&gt;"The Love Hounds Computer Network."  After we had suffered
&gt;through, what seemed at the time, seemily endless messages,
&gt;Spock released a computer virus that was intended to be passed
&gt;from computer to computer until it reached the Enterprise in our
&gt;time, when it would release a message giving Scott instructions
&gt;on how to beem us back through the portal that brought us here.
&gt;       However, this is not what happened.  The virus reached the
&gt;future, but, in this universe, Scott was not there.  Indeed, The
&gt;Enterprise and it's crew did not even exist, at least not as we
&gt;know them.  The entire galaxy was different.  Fortunately the
&gt;people in that time intercepted the message and brought us
&gt;forward in time themselves, to the future of this universe.

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; Why?

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;Simply because, as they put it, it was the nice thing to do. 
&gt;They were able to show us around, while they searched through
&gt;the ancient computer systems with their Past Time Viewers until
&gt;they were able to find information about you coming to rescue
&gt;us.  They then sent us back here. 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; But we don't have any machines capable of viewing the past like
&gt;that. 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;In OUR universe, but in this universe their future is full of
&gt;many strange and wonderful things. 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; I haven't been able to make any sense of the messages here or
&gt;to understand what these people are talking about.  I've never
&gt;heard of Kate Bush.  Does this computer system also exist in the
&gt;past of our universe? 
        
&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; Yes, it does.  Though things are subtly different between the
&gt;two universes, especially when it comes to the people.  In our
&gt;universe, Vickie is happily married to Richard and Chris is
&gt;married to Melissa.  IED is a real person and Andrew Marvick has
&gt;never heard of Kate, having missed that fateful day...   Ron
&gt;Hill is well known for "Wuthering Heights - Pat Benatar in her
&gt;Own Words", (this is particularly ironic since his
&gt;"Cloudbusting" book, in this universe, will become the holy
&gt;book of the people of Gaffan II).  Also, in our universe, no one
&gt;has heard of Cynthia, though Sinead O'Conner makes frequent,
&gt;flaming appearences. 
&gt;       However, Kate Bush's life up to this point in time is
&gt;virtally the same in both universes.  Kate enjoys a healthy and
&gt;productive life, making wonderful albums, and subtlely changing
&gt;the world.  You probably are not aware of it, but Gorbachev has
&gt;long been a secret Kate Bush fan. 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; No, I didn't know that. 
        
&gt;       SPOCK: It won't become well known for several years. &gt;We
have also been told of the future of Kate's life in OUR
&gt;universe. At a 1994 Kate Bush convention she met Ken SaintJohn
&gt;and instantly fell in love.  The next several months would prove
&gt;to be the happiest time in Kate's life, but unfortunately that
&gt;happyness was short lived as Ken was tragically killed when his
&gt;Amiga exploded after he tried to plug the American machine into
&gt;a British socket.  Kate couldn't live in the country that had
&gt;caused her love's death, so she moved to America where she 
&gt;quickly became involved with and then married to talk show host
&gt;Howard Stern, to whom she dedicated her disappointing 1996
&gt;album, For The Love Of Stern.  Although she was said to be happy
&gt;with Howard, she still longed for Ken, and drew strength from
&gt;this pain when she launched her triumphant 1998 Tour Of Life II
&gt;which was the first to use virtual reality musical techiques,
&gt;which were based on ideas of Ken.  
&gt;       It is then that the story again takes a down turn.  She
&gt;then joined Howard's talk show, as the "featured" singer, and
&gt;the two remaining albums she released consisted mainly of the
&gt;bad cover versions she sang on the show.  Both of these albums
&gt;are banned (by punishment of death) on Gaffan II.  Her future
&gt;after 2004 is unknown in our universe, due to the turbulance of
&gt;the times, and this gave rise to innumerable "Kate is alive" and
&gt;"Kate is Suspended in Animation, Somewhere" stories, for which
&gt;there is no evidence, though Oliver Stone XV did make a smash
&gt;film based on this theory. 
&gt;       Of course, this is the future of OUR universe, which is very
&gt;different from what will happen in THIS universe.  In fact, I
&gt;have discovered that the exact point of divergence is the point
&gt;when Ken and Kate met.  If it were not for that meeting, the
&gt;history of our universe, in all probability would have been much
&gt;sunnier. 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;Ironic that one meeting with one person could make such a
&gt;difference. 

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; Indeed it is, Captain. 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; So what happens in the future of THIS universe? 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;In 1997 she releases her album entitled, simply, Love.  It is a
&gt;concept album about what happens after The Ninth Wave, when the
&gt;woman goes to tell the world what she has learned.  It is not
&gt;particularly popular at first, since it is mainly one long
&gt;song, but when she takes it on the road in The Tour Of Life II,
&gt;the world is changed forever.  Later, when contact with the
&gt;Romulans is reached, the album is sent as the first subspace
&gt;message, and The Romulan War never happens and a peace treaty is
&gt;worked out almost immeadiately.  Even the Klingons mellow
&gt;somewhat.  The humans and other races make great leaps and
&gt;become thousands of years advanced from where we are in our
&gt;universe.  Ironically, the only conflict left in the galaxy is
&gt;on Gaffan II, where The Round Uppers often fight The Round
&gt;Downers over whether the 45.5 minute album should be considered
&gt;a 45 or a 46 minute album.  The ritualist flame-thrower-wars can
&gt;be quite messy.  But we don't have time for The Whole Story. 

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; Ha, ha.  The Whole Story, that's funny, Jim!  :-) 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; Spock, this is increadible, I've never heard you laugh before! 

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; Since I've heard Love, I've realized that you can't be overly
&gt;logical and overly uptight about everything.  Look what's
&gt;happened on Gaffan II!  :-)

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; So, you've heard the album? 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK:) writes 
&gt;Indeed, we have.  Indeed that is one of the reasons they sent us
&gt;back to meet you.  We have brought with us a high quality sample
&gt;file of the entire album, and we intend to bring it back with us
&gt;in the hope that it will help our universe as much as it helped
&gt;this universe.  Our universe will just get it a few hundred
&gt;years late.  When people understand what has happened, I have
&gt;the feeling that the name Ken SaintJohn will be cursed
&gt;throughout the galaxy.  Ironic that what started out as a minor 
&gt;mission will bring peace to the entire galaxy. 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; But that can't be, I've seen some of the "Star Trek" message
&gt;sections, and they talk about "The Next Generation" in which our
&gt;universe is run by self-righous, uptight morons! 

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; I too have seen the information about that show.  I find it
&gt;highly illogical and I think it is very unlikely we will end up
&gt;like that.  I never would have beleived the Romulans in the
&gt;episode "Re-Unification" and everybody knows we've already
&gt;found a cure for baldness.  Captain, the beam-out time is in 20
&gt;seconds. 

&gt;????@????.com (KIRK) writes:
&gt;Okay, Spock.  C'mon McCoy, when we finish playing the album for
&gt;you, we'll show you how to find the Kate Bush symbol hidden on
&gt;the cover.  

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; You know what, Bones? 

&gt;????@????.com (MCCOY) writes:
&gt; What? 

&gt;????@????.com (SPOCK) writes:
&gt; She really is.
