The labels are really coming in now. Fu-Sheng's is especially
beautiful. This was one idea that really worked out. The L-Hs
KompilaTion Tape seems to be another, thanks to L-Hs' hero of the
hour, Peter E. Lee! Three cheers to him for his splendid efforts.

MarK T. Ganzer was just wondering with IED the other day about
whether the format chosen by the first KonTributor would tend
to influence that of those who follow his/her entry, and it looks
as though the answer is 'yes' -- for better or worse. IED apologizes
if he set a bad trend; there was no conscious intention on his part
to shape the offerings of other L-Hs. He does believe, however,
that for those who are interested enough to begin with, there's enough
of each excerpt in IED's collage to suggest the character of the
whole piece. Different strokes, etc. About listing all of his entries:
IED will do so if you want, but anyone who might duplicate one of those
pieces in less truncated form should not be inhibited by the fact that
a tiny snippet appeared elsewhere.

Oh! One other thing -- Kate Bush is God.
