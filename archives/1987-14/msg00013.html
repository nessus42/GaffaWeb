Kate Bush began exploring Eastern modes of thought during her
visit to the guru Majjasahatta at the beginning of 1988. Upon her
return, she returned to her old haunt in Abbey Road, but began recording
in separate studios. The word passed round that Kate was the "mind",
Catherine the "heart", KT the "soul" and young Cathy the "body" of
Kate Bush. Unfortunately for her fans, the different members of their
idol were not working together much; and the old competition between
her two principal songwriters, Kate and Catherine, was no longer a
healthy one.
   If the next album -- a plain-covered double-LP (single CD with
one track missing) called, simply, "The Bushes", released in
mid-1988 -- tended to confirm that there
was increasing tension and alienation among the
four Bushes, still there was no doubt about the overall
quality of the music: it was smashing! Now, however, the truth was
out. Kate was said to have had so little respect for KT's songs
that she seldom even bothered to show up at her sessions.
    Needless to say, KT, who had grown increasingly dissatisfied with
the policy of only allowing space for two of her songs on each album,
was not happy with this new, more overt expression of disinterest on
Kate's part. Of Catherine's work, Kate later said, "All she ever
wrote is 'Wuthering Heights', and now she's just another 'Kite'!"
Even Cathy, always the most willing of the four to patch things up and
get back to a collaborative working routine, had had just about
all she could stand. The atmosphere seemed ripe for change.
Thereafter, it would be increasingly difficult for the four of them
to work together...

-- Mrs. Hudson
