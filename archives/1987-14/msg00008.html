To answer Dave Feltrow's question: the Orgonon Press was indeed made an
object of Government censorship, as a consequence of the FDA's
victimization of Wilhelm Reich and his assistants during the
1950s. There is an excellent (though very long) book on this
particular aspect of Reich's life and career, called _Wilhelm Reich
and the FDA_, if IED remembers correctly. The case was a long and
complicated one, initiated, as far as can now be ascertained, by
suspicions that Reich's theories about the psychological benefits
of the "complete" orgasm were resulting in illegal sexual practices.
This suspicion eventually resulted in a federal charge against Reich
of transporting his "orgone boxes" across state lines. Reich resisted
the charges, and was convicted of several such "crimes" after failing
to utter a word in his own defense. There were a great many fascinating
incidents surrounding the case -- Reich's assistants, for example, were
fiercely loyal to their mentor, and were reported to have carried
loaded pistols into the courtrooms. The crimes are generally understood
to have been smokescreens to cover the true grievances which the
government had against Reich, namely that he was a degenerate nut
who was stirring up trouble in the area, encouraging the moral
corruption of minors and misleading the public into thinking they
could improve rather than damage their health by sitting in one of
Reich's "boxes", which were, in reality, absolutely harmless chambers
made of metal and various kinds of fabric. In addition, it didn't help
matters that during his European career he had written a series of papers
advocating the institution of communistically based psycho-analytical
treatment centers for the masses, causing near-unanimous condemnation
of his later work by the rest of the psycho-analytic community.
The Orgonon Press was eventually shut down, but not before having
published several volumes of Reich's (and his followers') papers.
These are available at many university libraries in the country today.
