First of all, Love-Hounds, remember:

There's still time to get your signature stickers in to the
central Katemas-card compiler/mailer: Send a sticker of your
own manufacture to: Andrew Marvick, 10499 Wilkins Avenue,
Los Angeles, CA 90024. Come on, now, people, make a little
effort to show Kate you care about her. Think of all she's done
for us.

&gt;Instead, "Tokyo Joe" is a very polished bit of --- JAPANESE
&gt;DISCO.  Recorded in 1985, it features a lot of vocal work from
&gt;Sakamoto's wife, Akiro somebody-or-other, and as IED has mentioned in

Could have told you not to buy that one, Rob. Sorry. _Tokyo Joe_,
_Favourite Visions_, his first electronic LP, _The 1000 Knives_
(although that has some very good stuff on it),
as well as the early Hosono LPs/CDs like _Happy House_,
all of Takahashi's early records with the Sadistic Mika Band,
even his own first solo LP, _Saravah!_ -- they're all very, VERY
dated sounding, ultra-seventies, heavy with Little Feat L.A.-rock-fusion
influence (Bill Payne even plays on some of the stuff) and
that stupid syndrum sound.

By the way, you didn't have to go to Hong Kong for the Dalis Car
and _Dreams of Reason Produce Monsters_ CDs. They've both been in
stock here in L.A. for a long time now. Next time, just ask. (Oh!
He didn't go to Hong Kong just to get the CDs? Oops.) Never mind.

To Shelli Meyers:
You're not a hosehead, Shelli. The holy day is July 30. In
the first years of Kate's fame a big deal was made of the fact that
Kate's birthday was the same as Emily Bronte's. Heavy.

Thanks again to Peter E. Lee for his amazing organizational efforts.

There will be a Katemas party in L.A., too -- in a pig's eye!
IED's had enough of that crap!

Mike M., IED herewith complies with one of your requests by
posting the KT discography below. As for the lyrics to her songs,
since you're going to buy CDs of all her albums (aren't
you?), you don't need a transcription here. Besides, Henry Chai,
MarK T. Ganzer and IED are too busy transcribing KT interviews for
you guys.

---&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;---

    Catalogue of Kate Bush's Music (last updated 6/30/87)

For those who have requested a re-posting of the "discography", here
is an updated edition. Note that this is not, nor was it ever, a complete
discography, but simply a list of every snippet of KT music
known (by IED) to exist. Recordings are listed in ROUGH
chronological order. A quick, from-memory (ie. fallible) discography of
Kate's official releases precedes the non-LP list.
A complete discography, including all foreign pressings
with their catalogue numbers, is impracticable. EMI has many, many
divisions throughout the world. Who knows whether EMI-India hasn't
pressed some KT records, for example? If there's one thing
IED has learned in his nine years and three months of Kate Bush
fanaticism, it is that even the richest and most monomaniacal fan
could never really amass a "complete" collection.

I. Basic official discography (for notes on the b-sides, see the
non-LP-track discography after this section):

II. Non-LP Kate Bush music:

1. "Maybe": one of Kate's earliest recordings with the KT Bush Band,
made (as far as is known) in the summer of 1973, when
Kate had just turned fifteen; she played about two verses
and one chorus of the tape once during a British radio
interview.

2. "Passing Through Air": One of the b-sides to the "Army Dreamers"
single, it was recorded in 1973, at "Dave (Gilmour)'s house".

3. "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" (with spoken introduction): the
only distinction of this original UK single mix is a strange
spoken introduction in which Kate repeats the words "He's here!"

4."On Stage": a four-track EP of live performances from the Tour of Life,
featuring "Them Heavy People", "Don't Put Your Foot on the
Heartbrake","L'Amour Looks Something Like You", and a long
version of "James and the Cold Gun".

5. Live at the Hammersmith Odeon": the official video release, including
performances of twelve songs from the Tour of Life.
There are a few interesting musical changes from the LP
versions, notably the long instrumental introduction to
"Kite" and the early version of "Violin" (with non-LP lyrics).
"Kate Bush -- On Tour": a German/Dutch TV documentary featuring footage
of performances from the Tour of Life that were never officially
released.

6. "Wow!": one of the bootleg albums (this one a 2-LP set) put out by
an American outfit; it includes a transfer onto vinyl of the
"Hammersmith" video's audio track, and another vinyl transfer
of the audio portion of Kate's 1979 UK Christmas television
special (both of which were re-released as part of the recent
"Kate Bush Live in Europe '79-'80" bootleg 3-LP set.)
(Also, nine tracks from "Hammersmith" turned up as a third
bootleg LP called "A Bird in the Hand").

7. "Live in Paris '79": yet another bootleg by the same New Yorkers,
this record features part of a live performance apparently
done in Paris, and includes interesting versions of a few
LP tracks. This record was also included as the third LP
in the recent "Live in Europe '79-'80" bootleg set mentioned
above. It is falsely identified as being a production of the
non-existent "Fan Club of Taiwan".

8. "Kate Bush": the only title of a UK bootleg audio-cassette which
includes virtually the entire two hours of performance from
a 1979 concert in Bristol, England. This tape features
chants, readings by John Carder Bush, and incidental music,
all of which was heard in between Kate's songs
during the concert. There are two strange ethnic chants;
two synthesizer introductions to songs; two readings by
John -- one known as "Two in One Coffin" (preceding
"The Kick Inside"), the other a passage of unidentified prose
(probably by John) about children, which precedes "In Search of
Peter Pan";  and a long jam session by the KT Bush Band. Also
included is the alternate (live) version of "Egypt", which
sounds very different from the LP version.

9. "Kate": This was a forty-eight minute television special which aired
in England at about the time of the Tour of Life.
In addition to a couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one
or two new vocal performances of old songs, several new and
unique bits of music appeared on this show. They include
a brief introduction, a performance of part of Satie's
1st "Gymnopedie" (as an introduction to "Symphony in Blue"),
an early version of "December Will Be Magic Again",
a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel (Kate's
guest on the show), a brief bit of blues piano, and a
duet with Peter of Roy Harper's song, "Another Day".

10. "Let It Be": a live performance of the Beatles song, sung by
Steve Harley, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush during a one-off
London benefit concert. This appeared in a very limited
edition red plastic flexi-disc, made officially by the
Kate Bush Club for the Japanese branch of the Club;
in addition to the song, it includes a brief spoken
message from John Carder Bush and Kate.

11. "Kashka From Baghdad": a live solo performance done on a British
television show called "Ask Aspel" in early 1979.

12. "The Wedding List": a live performance done during the Prince's
Trust Concert a few years ago; Kate is backed by Phil
Collins on drums, Pete Townsend and Midge Ure on guitars
and BVs, and Mick Karn on bass.

13. "The Empty Bullring": the b-side to the "Breathing" single.

14. "Ran Tan Waltz": the b-side to the "Babooshka" single.

15."Army Dreamers" (single mix): does not fade out, as it does on the LP.

16. "December Will Be Magic Again": the 1981 Christmas single; this
song was written much earlier, and was performed on European
television ca. 1979/80 in an arrangement featuring bongos.

17. "Warm and Soothing": the b-side of the "December Will Be Magic Again"
single.

18. "Sing, Children, Sing": a benefit single by Leslie Duncan, with
Kate (virtually indistinguishable) singing in the all-star
back-up chorus.

19. "You (The Game, Part II)": a duet with Roy Harper of his song, on
his album The Unknown Soldier.

20. "Flowers": a duet with Zaine Griff of his song, on his 1982 LP
Figures. This song was a tribute to the dancer/mime/choreographer
Lindsay Kemp, with whom Kate and Zaine had studied together
for a time, ca. 1975/77.

21. "No Self-Control" and "Games Without Frontiers": two tracks from
Peter Gabriel's third solo album, on which Kate sings
backing vocals.

22. "The Magician (theme from "The Magician of Lublin"): a song from
The film "The Magician of Lublin" starring Alan Arkin, it
featured the music of Maurice Jarre (lyricist unidentified).
No soundtrack was ever commercially released; consequently,
the song is only known from the nearly unlistenable film
print itself (dialogue blots out most of Kate's vocal).

23. "Sat In Your Lap" (rhythm track only): this track, isolated from
the complete mix, was heard briefly on a British television
documentary "Looking Good, Feeling Fit".

24. "Sat In Your Lap" (single mix): different in sound (especially
the rhythm and relative prominence of lead vocal track) from LP
version.

25."Lord of the Reedy River": the b-side of the "Sat In Your Lap" single;
original song by Donovan, who sings (unidentifiably) BVs.

26. "Dreamtime": the b-side of "The Dreaming" single; an instrumental
version of "The Dreaming", very similar to the LP track only
without the lead vocals and with a longer, different ending.

27. "Ne T'Enfuis Pas": originally the b-side of the "There Goes a Tenner"
single, it was later remixed (the rhythm sound brightened
and the lead vocal moved further up in the mix) for French
and Canadian release as an a-side.

28. "Un Baiser d'Enfant": the b-side of the remixed "Ne T'Enfuis Pas",
this is a French-language version of the Never For Ever track
"The Infant Kiss".

29. "Running Up That Hill" (instrumental): identical to the LP version,
except for the missing lead vocal track; featured on the
twelve-inch single.

30. "Running Up That Hill" (re-mix): an extended re-mix of the original
recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.

31. "Cloudbusting (The Organon Mix)": an extended re-mix of the original
recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.

32. "Cloudbusting" (the film soundtrack): an extended version of the
original recording, with an insert of new music.

33. "Hounds of Love (Alternative Hounds)": an extended re-mix of the
original recording, with completely different vocals.

34. "The Big Sky (Special Single Mix)": a seven-inch version of the
original recording, with a slight remix and a different opening.

35. "The Big Sky (The Meteorological Mix)": an extended re-mix of the
original recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.

36."Under the Ivy": the b-side of the "Running Up That Hill" single.

37. "Burning Bridge": the first b-side of the "Cloudbusting" single.

38. "My Lagan Love": the second b-side of the "Cloudbusting" single; an
a capella recording of the traditional Irish folk-song.

39. "The Handsome Cabin Boy": the b-side of the "Hounds of Love" single;
another traditional Irish folk-song.

40. "Not This Time": the b-side of the "The Big Sky" single.

41."Experiment IV" (extended re-mix): featured on the twelve-inch single.

42. "Experiment IV" (film soundtrack): includes a remixed insert.

43. "Brazil": a cover of the old popular song, not included in the Terry
Gilliam film, but promised for inclusion in the soundtrack LP, which
will probably never be released.

44. "Be Kind to My Mistakes": Theme song for the Ken Russell film
"Castaway". Film released in U.S. Aug. 29.

45. "Make It Go Away": Theme song for the John Hughes film "She's
Having a Baby", scheduled for release in early 1988.

46. "Don't Give Up": a duet with Peter Gabriel of a song from his
album So.

47. "The Seer": a track from Big Country's 1986 album of the same name;
Kate sings backing vocals.

48."The King is Dead": a track from Go West's album Dancing on the Couch;
Kate sings backing vocals.

49. "Let It Be": 7" and 12" single by Ferry Aid, including vocal by Kate.

50."Running Up That Hill" and "Let It Be" (live), probably to be included
on the soundtrack LP for Amnesty International's "The Secret
Policeman's Third Ball", scheduled for release in the fall of 1987.

51. Note also a "New Vocal" version of "Wuthering Heights", actually an LP
track, since it is featured on Kate's greatest hits LP, The Whole Story.
