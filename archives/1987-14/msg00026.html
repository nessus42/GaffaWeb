&gt; Can anyone point me to information, interviews, etc. about the
&gt; Roches?


Whatever you find out I would appreciate it if you could pass the
information along to me. I am a Roches fan(atic).

In case you need it, the basic information is:

The Roches are 3 sisters (Maggie, Terre, and Suzzy [they don't give
out their ages or phone numbers) with as close to perfect voices as is
humanly possible (I have seen them in concert 3 times. The last time,
May 15, 1987, they seemingly had a bad night, but the first two times
their voices were transcendent -- records do not do their voices
justice). They have their individual styles which have evolved from
more folk/folk-rock into more modern-pop-type sounds. Their music and
poetry are definately not mainstream. Nonetheless, I find the
combination of their poetic, musical, and vocal talents extremely
compelling.

The records (I know of) released to date are:

 Seductive Reasonings (Maggie and Terre only, on Columbia)
 The Roches    (on WB)
 Nurds         (on WB)
 Keep on Doing (on WB)
 Another World (on WB)
 No Trespassing (only four songs, released last December on Rhino)

They also sang one song on the Phillip Glass album ``Songs from Liquid
Days''. I have this one on CD. The CD did not capture the complete
splendor of their voices either.

In the late 70's they appeared on Saturday Night Live once. You can
catch them singing the Hallalujah Chorus on one of the hour-long SNL
reruns. In 1983 they appeared on the Sound Stage program. That program
consisted mostly of music, but it did have some small interviews with
Terre and Suzzy interspersed. I have both on VHS format tape.
Unfortunately, the sound quality of each program is fair to poor.

As I said above, I would appreciate any info you can pass along to me.
