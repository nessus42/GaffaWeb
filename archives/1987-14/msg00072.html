&gt;In the latest issue of Billboard, one of the columns
&gt;reports that an "Elton John/Bernie Taupin 20 year Tribute Album"
&gt;is in the works which will consist of a bunch of big-name UK
&gt;artists doing covers of their songs. The first cover they mentioned
&gt;was a cover of "Rocket Man" by Kate to be included on the album.
&gt;
&gt;-- Hugh

This is mind-fuckingly good news, Hugh, thanks for your eagle eye.
(IED looked over the same issue but missed the news.) IED gathers
that no mention was made of a release date?

Added to IED's master KompilaTion Tape List:
Steven L. Sheffield
514 Windsor St., Santa Cruz, CA 95062

But Peter E. Lee has been organizing the real lists. Better ask him.

&gt;From: seismo!hadron!inco!pauls (Paul Stygar)
&gt;This is not to start a "Let's embarass IED" bandwagon:

Didn't think it was.

&gt;The other day, in a place far away,  there were dozens of
&gt;Kate Bush discs,  quite a few not on IED's list.
&gt;At Yesterday &amp; Today in Rockville, Maryland:
&gt;
&gt;26.    Suspended in Gaffa/Dreamtime (instrumental version).
&gt;27.    Hounds of Love/Burning Bridge  (Canada EMI).
&gt;28.    Hounds of Love/Hounds of Love (1985 DJ promotional disc).
&gt;       No. 28 (labelled NOT FOR SALE), was $4. The two versions were
&gt;       3:01 and 3:44 (extended version), different from the extended
&gt;       version (about 3:46) on IED #20 which is credited "mixed by
&gt;       Del Palmer".
&gt;29.    Interview Picture Disc (Limited Edition) BAK 2006.
&gt;       No. 20 was a 12-inch disc packaged in a clear vinyl cover,
&gt;       ($10 each at Y&amp;T) with a color picture of Kate on the a-side
&gt;       and another picture on the b-side, both with very very hazel
&gt;       brown eyes.

     Please don't take offense by the following explanation of why
IED is not embarassed about these omissions at all. Longtime Love-Hounds
will be very familiar with IED's compulsive record-straightening habits:

     The "discography" in question begins with a note which says
very clearly that the intention is to list all of Kate's MUSICAL
RECORDINGS, and NOT all her records. So, for example, only original
UK releases of singles and LPs are listed, unless a foreign release
features a recording which is not available as an English release
(such as the French single for "Ne T'enfuis pas", which
includes the track "Un Baiser d'enfant"). None of the records you've
listed has any actual music on it that isn't contained in one or
more of IED's listings.

     To be specific:

&gt;26. Suspended in Gaffa/Dreamtime (instrumental version).

     For No. 26 on your list, the
a-side is from the LP, the b-side was originally the
b-side of the UK single for "The Dreaming".

&gt;27. Hounds of Love/Burning Bridge  (Canada EMI).

     No. 27: The a-side is an LP cut again, and the b-side first
appeared as a UK b-side.

&gt;28. Hounds of Love/Hounds of Love (1985 DJ promotional disc).
&gt;    No. 28 (labelled NOT FOR SALE), was $4. The two versions were
&gt;    3:01 and 3:44 (extended version), different from the extended
&gt;    version (about 3:46) on IED #20 which is credited "mixed by
&gt;    Del Palmer".

     No. 28: This one requires a fuller explanation. The a-side IS the
LP track, identical in every respect, and also the same (as far as
anyone has been able to tell) as the seven-inch UK single version.
The timings of both this US a-side and the original LP track are the same
-- the difference is probably only on the label, but it is also possible
that the U.S. promo version fades out a second or so too soon.
     Regarding the "extended" b-side, you're not kidding when you say
it's different from Del's official "Alternative Hounds" re-mix! You've
got the timings wrong there: "Alternative Hounds" is somewhere around
4-and-a-half minutes long, as IED remembers, not 3:46 at all: there
is a much longer rhythm introduction, and an extra two bars precede
the coda.
     Also, this U.S. "extended" mix is just that: some
EMI-America engineer's sleazy US radio-mix of the same official LP cut,
with the first verse tacked on after the last chorus of the original,
almost certainly without Kate's supervision or approval -- she has no
control over US promotional releases. IED saw no reason for
including that mix in a list of KATE's recorded works.

&gt;29.    Interview Picture Disc (Limited Edition) BAK 2006.
&gt;       No. 20 was a 12-inch disc packaged in a clear vinyl cover,
&gt;       ($10 each at Y&amp;T) with a color picture of Kate on the a-side
&gt;       and another picture on the b-side, both with very very hazel
&gt;       brown eyes.

     No. 29: This is not music at all, but just one of a great many
interviews which must be the subject of a separate, future list, not part
of the present list of musical recordings. Anyway, the bootleg record
which you describe has already been discussed in some detail
in past Love-Hounds.

&gt;IED #15 (Running up that Hill) was present in pressings from UK, Spain,
&gt;France, Italy, Canada, Japan ... (with lyrics on the cover in Kanji
&gt;and English).

     This is precisely why IED said he wasn't trying to make up a
real "discography": for all we know, there is also a Pakistani
pressing of that same song, but since we have no confirmation,
an authoritative, definitive discography is impossible. But we
can be certain that if a Pakistani pressing does exist, the actual
recording on the vinyl is no different than that on all the other
countries' pressings, so it has no place in IED's list.

&gt;With all these Kate items,  why can I never find a Beta version
&gt;of the Whole Story video?  I've seen laser discs and lots of VHS.

When you say you've seen laser-disks, do you mean you've seen the
laser-disk of The Whole Story??? That's a very recent, extremely
expensive (because of the present yen-to-dollar rate) LVD which IED
has had on order for nine-and-a-half fucking weeks with no hope in
sight. If you can confirm, IED would be forever in your debt, Paul.
He'd even get hold of a Beta version for you...

&gt;&gt;Is it OK to mention the version of Wuthering Heights on Pat Benatar's
&gt;&gt;CD Crimes of Passion ...(so Bush-like I stillllllllllllll think it's KT
&gt;&gt;herself) ?
&gt;
&gt;     {   Blecho!  Barf!  Ick!  No!  -- |&gt;oug   }

You are surely joking about not being able to tell the difference,
right? PAT BENATAR sounds like KATE BUSH?? Are you MAD? Benatar's
version is professional, even strong, but it entirely lacks the
heart and soul of Kate's original. "Wuthering Heights" is the first
supernatural phenomenon in the history of popular music. Pat Benatar
just brings it down to our own sordid, mortal level again. It's
pathetic.

And NO, it does NOT belong on IED's list!

&gt;I think I'll go on a Books-which-have-Kate-songs-based-on-them reading binge
&gt;because I want to and I haven't read anything for a while.  I guess I
&gt;might read _Turn_of_the_Screw_ next, or possibly _Wuthering_Heights_,
&gt;and then maybe something about Delius.  Hmmmmm...
&gt;
&gt;-- Paul Holt

In that case, IED will shortly post Kate's own list of recommended books,
which first appeared in an old Newsletter.
