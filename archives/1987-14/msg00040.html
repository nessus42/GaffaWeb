I am slowly returning from a state of Dementia Katiis Extremis that
was the result of trying to integrate the Keyboard-Totally Wired
interviews, and thus finally have chance to catch up with the
discussions. But things sure seem quiet in this group recently.

&gt; A source whose identity cannot be revealed by IED but whose info is
&gt; entirely reliable has learned that as of three days ago, Kate
&gt; had finished writing the music for twelve songs, but hadn't
&gt; done the lyrics for more than one or two. That's it.

&gt; -- Andrew

Progress!! If my impressions of how she writes is correct, this means
that she has at least some of the instruments down on tape for each of
the 12 songs, and probably has bits and pieces of lyrics for the other
10 or 11 songs. This means that KBVI is farther along than it sounds!
I would estimate that this means a June-Sept '88 release. This is all
based on comments in the Keyboard and Swales interviews that she
writes in the studio now, and it goes onto tape early in the writing
process, and the fact that with her own studio, the demos are now the
masters also. I know Andrew is concerned about KBVI being different
enough from HoL, but this would still make it 3 years since the last
new LP. The difference this time around is that we have had a few new
songs and "The Whole Story" to keep us going. And with what she was
able to do rather quickly in "Be Kind to My Mistakes", I am truly
excited with the possibilities of what the new album
