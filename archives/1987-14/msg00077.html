&gt;Just for the old boy's slow wits' sake, Neil -- What exactly is a "namecheck"?

It's getting your name mentioned on the radio, in a magazine, in a speech or
whatever.

Once again thanks are proferred to our hard-typing scribes IED and MarK T.
for the interviews. If they keep coming at this rate I shall be shamed
into hunting through the detritus in my attiKT to see whether I can find
any old articles. Anyway much appreciated lads.

15 days to cross the Atlantic - even Richard Branson's balloon beat that.
High speed computers? What price SDI?

A question: does anyone know the name of the song that Pamela Stephenson
did on `Not the Nine O'clock News' which was a Kate Bush take-off? All I
can remember is that in the lyrics Pamela went on about people buying her
records not for the music but because they wished they could "get inside
my leotard".

Be seeing you.

      [	Here are the lyrics (as heard by me) to the Pamela Stephenson
	song in question:  -- |&gt;oug

		OH ENGLAND MY LEOTARD
		(To be sung roughly to the
		 tune of "Them Heavy People")
		----------------------

	I was into yin and yang and half of yoga
	Ginsing and carroway seeds and being a non-smoker
	My carrot quiches were better than the board's were
	And they were thicker than two short ones
	People bought my latest hits cause they like my latex tits
	Everyone is trying hard to get inside my leotard
	Went to my hairdresser to have a hairdo
	He asked if I him knew "A la Recherche Tete-Temps Perdu"
	That's how I was introduced to Gollette, Cocteau, and Marcel Brust
	Now whole food cookery is just a sideline
	La la la la la ...
	I went to Cairo and I read the Gnostic
	A corporate form of joining the original cop-boutique ah
	Cause I cuff psychosis berries
	And a fibonacci series
	Studied acupuncture and the bible
	Opened the windows in my mind
	"It's not your mind -- it's your body they're into"
	My business manager said
	He said I need an intellect like I need a 
	Hole in the, hole in the, hole in the head
	Though I'm an honorary member of Mensa now
	I'm going to try and keep up the pretense some how
	Would you buy my latest hits because you like my latex tits?
	And you're all trying hard to get inside my
	     [...Music changes to "Violin"...]
	Leotard, leotard, leotard
      ]
