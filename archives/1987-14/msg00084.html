Well well well!!!   Seems that good ol' Second Coming Records in Harvard
Square (Boston's scaled-down Greenwich Village) is stocking bootlegs again,
and people everywhere are rejoicing.  Seems a bootleg pressing plant in
Looooooozeeana got busted, and there wuz this BIG scare, but it's keesh
now, so don't sweat it.

Wot I got:  Peter Gabriel's "Family Snapshot".  It's a "Plays Live" lookalike,
EXCELLENT sound quality, and has the following track listing:
      A: Across the River / Intruder / Not One of Us / The Family and the
         Fishing Net / Humdrum
      B: Shock the Monkey / Milgram's 37 / Family Snapshot / Solsbury Hill
      C: San Jacinto / On the Air / Biko / Kiss of Life
      D: I Heard it Through the Grapevine / Animal Magic / Strawberry Fields
         Forever / Me and My Teddy Bear / Have a Wonderful Day in a One-Way
         World / Bully For You

Yes.  Strawberry Fields Forever.  Heard it Through the Grapevine.  Seriously.
Tracks I, III, and IV on side D are studio tracks. The rest is live and
good quality.

Here's Dan Parmenter to tell the class what he brought in:

Greetings Gentle Sentients, it seems that this bootleg-buying
expedition was indeed fruitful.  I picked up a Mike Oldfield
Bootle called 'Mirage'.  Or was it?  It looked like a Bootleg, yet
the quality was astonishingly good.  Included are a rather nice
selection of tracks - all live.  Oldfield live is a very
pleasant experience indeed, as evidenced by this album and the
earlier, legitimate, 'Exposed'.  Anyway, the tracks:
A: Taurus 1/Sheba/Mirage
B: Platinum/Tubular Bells
C: Incantations Parts III and IV/Punkadiddle/Conflict
D: Ommadawn.

Very nice indeed, different from all other live Oldfield, but equally
lovely.

All in all a lucky outing.  We're going back.
