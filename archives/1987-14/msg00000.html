Notes on the new Canadian TV interview with Kate Bush:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lori Brown really did do her homework. She's
serious, low-key and respectful, and her
questions are probing and well constructed.

This interview marks
the first time one really gets to see and listen to Kate Bush HERSELF,
without all the careful make-up, photographic touch-ups,
flattering lighting, etc. She is no longer a beautiful young girl,
by any means; and to IED, at least, this comes as a wonderful revelation.

Instead, Kate emerges as a real, adult human being -- good-looking,
to be sure, but also definitely a little overweight, her face pale and
a bit puffy, with noticeable rings under the eyes. She no longer seems
to have much relation to the early (ca. 1978) Kate at all. She herself
talks about her old persona almost as though it were a distant memory.
No longer is there any chameleon-like assumption of
a heavy South London accent during interviews. Her tone is very
dry and flat, her English seems much more like her brothers' (close
to BBC), and she no longer seems to be intent on maintaining a sweet
and polite disposition. Above all, this interview gives a very strong
impression of Kate's intelligence and mature artistic identity.
It's very refreshing to see the REAL THING for once.

This is the interview that every new fan should see before any other --
perhaps before seeing any of Kate's videos, even. It should dispel any
ideas that they may have been getting from the old music or from all the
media-hype that surrounds Kate, to the effect that she is a frail young
"Pre-Raphaelite beauty," and will instead force them to face the truth
about Kate Bush the adult artist. Despite a few such purple phrases, Lori
Brown and her crew have produced a superlative piece of video-journalism
and the best bit of Kate interview on tape, by miles.
But it could also be something of a shock
to those fans who were more taken by the image than by the brilliance
of her recent work.

There is one extremely significant passage in the interview itself, which
will appear in L-Hs at any moment courtesy of Henry Chai's posting of the
second part of his transcription: Kate says, in explaining the RUTH video,
that it was her "farewell to dance", and that it marks the end of her
interest in using dance as the primary vehicle for the expression
of her visual ideas -- the new dominating interest being film.
Which bodes very well indeed for
her art in the future, but discourages hopes for a tour (or for her
return to top physical condition) any time soon!

Watching Storms:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maiden issue of "Watching Storms", the first-ever Kate Bush "apazine",
was also received yesterday. Love-Hounds is mentioned by its editor
Ernest Heramia, whose ambition is eventually to unite the Love-Hounds
with the Storm-Watchers, and arrange a group charter to England.
Comments on the idea, anyone?
