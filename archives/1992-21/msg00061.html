Here is the info you need to attend! Please try to follow this as best as 
possible so that we can all have a great time! 

1st: If you haven't already done so, call me if at all possible to RSVP 
for the event!   Many of you have e-mailed and I expect a good tunout and 
a lot of fun for all involved, but I request an RSVP so that we can plan  
out what you can do to help Katemas!  There is no charge to attend, of 
course, but the rule of the day is PARTICIPATION!  I expect everyone to 
do something, no matter how small, to help the event succeed, since the 
success of the event is ultimately dependent on you and our fellow 
Katefans.  We need more Katestuff to be brought, including magazines, 
posters, rare recordings, and various collectables! As in previous years, 
we will have the excellent collection of videotape and raw footage of 
Kate amassed by Ed Suranyi ( Thanks Ed! ) and we will see the 1st 
appearance at Katemas of our humble moderator, Bill Wisner!  If you have 
the Katestuff, bring it! We can use it, and no matter what it is, it will 
be appreciated!  
    We are also having a potluck at the event, and expect to have lots of 
great food and beverages! (  alcohol allowed! )  I expect everyone to 
contribute to this as much as possible by letting me know when you RSVP 
what you can bring and then following through! I especially encourage 
anyone's special dishes to be brought and I will provide a BBQ for those 
that want to use one!  We have the cake, plenty of plates, cups, and 
utensils, etc.. so far, with much more to be brought still!
    Also, for those that are without transportation, don't despair! There 
will be carpooling to the event, and since fans are coming from all ovet 
the area, you can quite likely get a ride!  Call me if you need a ride 
and I will try to get you one.. drivers that carpool those that need 
rides will earn extra brownie points and not need to bring food! ( Yumm.. 
anyone want to bring brownies though will get extra extra brownie 
points!)

2nd: ( About time!) Call anytime within reason, but I would especially 
suggest between 5-9 pm as being good hours.  I can answer my phone at 
most any hour however,  but be nice and allow me and the others in the 
house the chance to sleep in...  If you get the machine, leave your full 
name, phone number, address, e-mail address, phone #, and also let me 
know if you either need to or would be willing to carpool, what katestuff 
you can bring, what food or beverages you can bring ( give me options, as 
someone else may be bringing it already ) and any other information as 
needed. I cannot return long distance calls just for economic reasons, 
but I will be sending out flyers and e-mail, and calling if absolutely 
needed. 

3rd: Tell your friends that like Kate to come too! The more, the merrier, 
and if there are enough people, I may move the event to a larger place, 
such as a restaurant or nightclub. We will have PSA's running on college 
stations as well, so we expect some extra people from that that otherwise 
wouldn't be aware of the event. 

4th: The date of the event will be August 1st and the location is 
tenatively set for 76 Pierce Ave, Downtown San Jose. Take the downtown 
exit, make your way to Santa Clara St, go to Market St. which is where 
East Santa Clara becomes West Santa Clara. Go South on Market 6 blocks 
until you come to Pierce on the right-hand side going south. Turn on 
Pierce and it's about three houses up on the left-side. If the event has 
been moved, I will have many flyers available on the front door with 
directions and it will more than likely be within a mile of the house.

Thanks for muddling through this long letter - and remember, it all 
starts with a call... 
Thanks-
Mark ( 408 ) 287-9530
