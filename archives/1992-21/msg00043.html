<PRE>
I will be hosting a Katemas party in downtown San Jose this year, and we 
expect quite a crowd! It will be on Saturday, August 1st either at my 
house, or, depending upon the # of people that RSVP, at either a banquet 
room or a nearby club.  In order for this event to succeed and for me to 
co-ordinate the event effectively, I would appreciate an RSVP, preferably 
over the phone, since it's a quicker means of exchanging ideas.  I also 
hope that everyone, whether they are going or not, will invite fellow 
Katefans and pass along this information. Plenty of fans don't have 
computers, and I am interested in getting the event's turnout as large as 
possible, while still keeping the crowd fans of Kate. I might even have 
some messages on local college stations running, since I have friends and 
they would do so for free.  This event's success, as have the ones in the 
past, relies heavily on the individuals attending to make the whole thing
work.  I request that everyone that comes please let me know what they 
can contribute, no matter how small. The event will have food and 
beverages ( alcohol allowed ) and this will be a potluck, so anything 
will be appreciated greatly.  I also need rare videos to show, posters, 
magazines, rare recordings, Katezines, and other Kate related material.
Also appreciated would be live music, collectors interested in selling 
Katestuff, and I would especially appreciate the donation of doorprizes!
Please RSVP by phone, if possible, as soon as possible, so we can make 
this event a great success! If you call long distance and I am not 
available to take your call, please call back, since I cannot return 
long-distance calls to everyone. 
Looking forward to hearing from you! -
