Tried to post this a week ago, but it seemed to have died en route...
Try again...

I stopped at a local used record store the other day and spied The Single 
File box set sitting there.  Though I could not buy it, I had fun 
inspecting it and saw that everything was intact, including the booklet, 
and was in very good condition.

So I told the guy behind the counter about gaffa, and he decided to hold
the box for anyone in this newsgroup who would be willing to pay the best 
price for it.  I guess that means whoever bids the highest price gets the 
box.  If anyone wants to talk to him about it, the owner's name is Greg, 
and he can be reached at (503) 274-0690 in the daytime.  Keep trying, he 
is not there on some days, or leave a message.  BTW, he is a Kate maniac, 
so even if you can't afford the box he probably would be fun just to say 
hello to.  Oh, yeah, the store's name and address:
EEEK Records
1016 SW Taylor
Portland, OR 97205

I am NOT getting ANY $$$ by posting this, it's just a public service.  
Though I am not a regular reader/poster on gaffa, I am a bit loyal to it 
from appreciating Kate.  I hope this post helps some desperate person in 
need of that particular item.  

BTW, though I do not know this Greg very well, I know that they have 
never ripped me off nor any of my friends when I have shopped there.  
Still, if there is any trouble, just email me and I'll go yell at 'em for 
ya. :-)   I doubt  that it would be necessary...

good luck...
elana
