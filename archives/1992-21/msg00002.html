Yes, that's right...Wuthering Heights the musical is now abailable in your
local record store.  No KaTe on this one, tho'.  As far as I can tell, this
version (the first full musical of the story) has not been performed anywhere. 
It seems to have been commissioned by the Bronte Society, and includes songs
such as 'Wuthering Heights' (not the same one) and 'Cathy!'.  I've only
listened to it once so far, and i'm not really impressed.  I would expect a
musical with Heathcliff as one of the characters to be much more emotional and
dark and heavy.  The woman who plays Cathy, Lesley Garrett, has a high voice,
although much more operatic than KaTe's.  The liner notes do contain one
reference to KaTe:
	There have been 7 major films between 1920 and 1991 and in addition
	there has been a ballet (1982), and opera (1967) and numerous 
	adaptations and plays, including several for television - and not
	forgetting Kate Bush's song "Wuthering Heights" which topped the
	charts!
Almost as an after thought...humph!  Anyhow, I wouldn't really recommend this
for anyone but lovers of Broadway musicals (or West End Musicals to you London
types...).  Me, I'm a big fan of them, which was what i was doing in the
section in the first place.  It took Steve VD to remind me that it was a KaTe
connection!  To me, it was merely a new musical of one of my favorite novels.
BTW:  They give an address for The Bronte Society...if anyone's interested,
send me e-mail.

Which leads me to mention that I had a wonderful 4th of July.  Steve was in
Atlanta for the Peachtree Road Race, so we got a chance to meet in person.  I
think everyone at the holiday picnic was a little confused, though, when they
asked how we met!  :-)  So welcome back home, Steve, and congratulations again!

Well, the month is now officially July,...sigh...can it possibly be?  Counting
down the days 'til KaTemas &amp; counting down the years 'til the new album!  :-)

(ps.  ignore the .sig---i've been too lazy to change it.  I'm now pleasantly
ensconsed in Atlanta, and the e-mail address is still the same one, but i'm no
longer threatening atlanta...now i've become the reality.)
