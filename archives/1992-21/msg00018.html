COMPILATION BOOTLEGS

        by Andrew Marvick (IED), Evan Walsh, and Ron Hill

        This is a compilation of various messages from Love-Hounds, done by
Ron Hill who takes responsibilty for any errors that may have occured during
editing.

        These bootlegs contain compilations of material officially released. 
This makes the material more ethically dubious and illegal then the other
boots, which normally contain material not available on official releases. 


        "Passing Through Air" (the LP, NOT to be confused with the CD of the
same name, which is entirely different), is a two-record set and includes a
lot of Kate's b-sides and re-mixes, plus the video mix of "Cloudbusting", and
the edit of "Hounds of Love" which Kate used for the lip-synch performance of
the song for the 1986 BPIs -- misidentified in the album listing as a "live"
version. Also misidentified is the "Meteorological Mix" of "The Big Sky" as
"The Astrological Mix"; a mistake not apparently motivated by bootlegger's
caution, since all the other tracks are clearly identified as the official
releases they once were.
        There is only one piece of truly valuable new music on this two-record
set (or new to IED, anyway): the last track on the album is the live version
of "Let It Be" from about 1980/81, which Kate performed with Steve Harley and
Peter Gabriel, and which appeared on a Japanese Fan Club flexi-disc. However,
the present recording is twice the length of the "official" version, fading
out much nearer to the end of the performance. The original source for this
performance is the same cheap in-audience tape which was used by the KBC for
their flexi-disc.
        The cover has a close-up of the photo used for the U.S. Hounds of Love
LP poster (Kate kneeling with a Turkish fez on her head).

        Track Listing: 

        Side 1 
        Cloudbusting (Video Mix)

        Not This Time
        Big Sky (Astrological Mix) [Sic]

        Side 3
        The Wedding List (Live)
        Running Up That Hill (Intrumental)
        Hounds Of Love (Alt Mix)
        The Empty Bullring 
        Dreamtime

        Side 4

        Passing Through Air 
        Lord Of The Reedy River
        Warm And Soothing

        _Backsides_ is available in LP and CD format.  Track listing: 
SIDE 1 :December Will Be Magic Again
        Warm and Soothing
        Ran Tan Waltz (ouch!!!)
        Full House
        The Empty Bullring
SIDE 2 :Burning Bridge
        Not This Time
        The Handsome Cabin Boy
        Under The Ivy
        The Big Sky (Metorological Mix) 
                           ^ [Their spelling]

        The only interesting thing is the record it was pressed on top of.
'Maria Stanmore Sings' . After The Big Sky you can hear the end of the song
which was previously on that side ('Patrick Moores Dream'). You can hear
something anyway - I'm just presuming. It's on Pink Frost Records (Maria
Stanmore Sings, that is). There is no identification of the bootlegger or the
country of origin. The only inscription on the runout groove is on side 1: 'MS
1 A 1J' and a '3' and on side 2: 'MS 1B J' and a '2' but these were probably
on the original record.
It has a white paper insleeve and a white outersleeve with a quite small
picture of KaTe at a piano by a window, very probably East Wickham Farm,
wearing flip-flops and a waistcoat and slacks, looking at the camera. The
picture is similar to one in (I think) Vermorel's 'Princess ...' book but the
shot is from a different angle (right angles to her) and not blurred. I have
never seen it before.
        On the outer sleeve the only words are 'Kate Bush', 'Back Sides' and
the track listing. The sound quality is normal commercial LP quality.


        _The_Can_ (1991) is a LP compilation of Kate's session work with other
artists and rare versions of other songs.  It comes with a T-shirt (some
versions), sticker, and bootlet.

        You (The Game Part II) (Roy Harper)
        Flowers (Zaine Griff) 

        Side 2
        Sister And Brother (Midge Ure) 
        Once (Roy Harper)
        The Seer (Big Country)
