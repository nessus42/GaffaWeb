&gt; Quite a while ago (over two years) someone mentioned a British
&gt; a cappella group called the flying pickets.  They do covers of
&gt; such songs as "only you" (yaz), "heard it thru the grapevine", 
&gt; "psycho killer" (particularly interesting since the bobs also
&gt; do this one), "tears of a clown", "you've lost that loving feeling",
&gt; and others.  I found a CD by them (W.German pressing) called "Lost
&gt; Boys" which has all these songs, and others.
 
Well! Guess what I'll be looking for next time I'm in an import shop...
 
&gt; This again goes to prove that if you wait long enough, you'll
&gt; find everything on CD.  While we're on the subject, I have just
&gt; joined an a cappella group and am particularly (though I've always
&gt; been) interested in a cappella groups, esp. ones that are off
&gt; the beaten track and creative (like the bobs). I've heard of many
&gt; (including the nylons, manhattan transfer [who often are accompanied
&gt; by instruments], roches [ditto], all the ones on spike lee's PBS
&gt; special and spike &amp; co. album) but would love to hear of others.
&gt; It seems that many colleges have groups that are often great, but
&gt; little known outside the local area.

I'd like to find "Cadillac Heaven" by what I think were the 
Baltimores (any friends in rec.music.dementia who could be of
assistance?). 

&gt; (Cornell, for e.g. had the hangovers and Cayuga waiters; UofIllinois
&gt; had one too;  I have a friend who was in the Oberlin group
&gt; (the obertones) and I have a tape of theirs; etc.). 

If I had went to MIT, I would have loved to hear a group with the 
funniest (and most appropriate, considering the place) name I've 
ever heard: The LogaRhythms.

&gt; There are also
&gt; isolated instances of traditional-instumentation artists who have 
&gt; selected songs/albums of a cappella work (e.g. Todd Rundgren, a 
&gt; capaella, Billy Joel (longest time), and even Huey Lewis (naturally), 
&gt; etc.).

"Naturally" was performed a couple of years ago by the emcees 
of IU Sing, a mini-musical competition among the Greek houses
and dorms.
