[a pretty good response to Judi regarding the usage of the term 'queer']

&gt;I'm assuming that's what was meant by "queer positive".  Though I don't see 
&gt;what that should have to do with someone's music, unless they're outwardly 
&gt;gay-bashing.

What it has to do with music is that Ron, who posted the original request
for info, has a radio show on which he plays only queer positive music.
It's not terrible different from Vickie's radio show playing only female
artists (though I imagine it's harder to find folks you can play).

What would Vickie do if she heard a song but honestly couldn't tell if
it was a man or a woman singing?  This happened to her with Riz, or whatever
his name is--she had decided that the singer had to be a woman until
she talked to him.  Same thing happened to me when one of the local stations
was playing Natalie Archangel's "Don't Heal Clean" or whatever it's called--
the first 8 or so times I heard it, I missed the DJ saying who the artist
was, and I'd decided that it was probably a man.  It's not just a question
of playing music by people who _sound_ like women, or a question of playing
music by people who aren't known to be queer negative.

&gt;Which network is Dennis Miller on, and at what time?

Dennis Miller is a syndicated show, and as such it appears at different times
on different networks around the country.  In DC, Dennis Miller is on channel
20 at 12:30am.

DAMN!  I just remembered that channel 20 was not working on the cable system
this morning.  I hope it's back by midnight!
