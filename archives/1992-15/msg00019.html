Just picked up the new issue of _B-Side_ (Apr/May); in addition to 
nice articles Single Gun Theory and Dead Can Dance (my main reason 
for getting it), I found this review by Sandra Garcia:

TORI AMOS
Little Earthquakes (Atlantic)
-------------------------------
Supposedly when this album was first heard by the powers that be at 
Atlantic they claimed they heard enough to understand that they didn't 
understand.

There's complete irony in that situation.  For Tori Amos makes music 
that carries such a strong sense of understanding that those who don't 
understand must be completely out of touch with emotions that many 
people, in particular women, deal with every day of their lives.

The best way to really describe Tori's sound is to actually listen.  
&gt;From breezy cabaret sounds mixed with dark lyrics to truly heart wrenching 
emotional epics, words don't accurately capture what she conveys in this 
album.  Her voice has been compared to Kate Bush and Sinead O'Connor.  
Perhaps in technical prowess but the force that sets Tori Amos apart is 
the feeling that instead of using her voice as a technically exotic 
instrument, she uses instead the emotions behind her voice.  The result 
is a sound that can move you to tears with great ease.  Her exquisite voice 
sounds genuinely moved by what she is singing.  And when she is accompanied 
by her own sensitive, passionate piano personality, the music is multi-
layered, as the emotional content matches note for note.

There's been a swell of hype about this artist.  For once, it's deserved.  
Tori is a welcome addition to the ranks of women who sing from the heart 
and from the soul.  But her music seems to go deeper than most, touching 
a deeply universal chord within many through her words.  It's deeply 
haunting music with the odd twist of quirky humor thrown in to let us know 
it ain't all bad.  We can still find a smile after all to haul us up.

The British music press found her first.  Let's make sure the American 
public isn't lagging too far behind in the race.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


...and only a week to go until her Seattle date.  I'm really, *really* 
looking forward to this.
