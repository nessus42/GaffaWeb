Hello,
I'm new to the discussion list. Is there anybody else from Germany?

With pleasure I found out that so many participants are enthusiastic about
Tori Amos. After I've listened to her album the first time she's got the start
of Kate. I've seen Tori in Hamburg on March, 3 - it was indescribable (I
subscribe to Meredith Tarr).
I sat in the first row in Tori'S field of vision and I was paralysed every time
she looked into my eyes. After the concert, when the audience was gone, except
for some fans and two photographers, she came out again, sat at the piano and
began to play, while the photographers took their pictures. In the bachground
stood her manager, saying "Tori, come on, that's enough|", but she didn't stop.

Which singles are published in UK, USA, or elsewhere?
In Germany are available
           - China / Sugar / Flying Dutchman / Humpty Dumpty,
           - Winter / Angie / Smells Like Teen Spirit / Thank You.
The "Winter"-single contains cover-versions of Rolling Stones, Nirvana, and
Led Zeppelin. But the most impressive interpretation was her live-version of
"Whole Lotta Love".

I'm on edge for Kate's next album. What does she think about Tori? Will she
react and play more piano-songs? I must confess that I was a little bit
disappointed by her latest single "Rocket Man / Candle In The Wind" (both
Elton-John-songs). It sounds a bit listless and uninspired. Maybe Kate should
collaborate with another producer and come out of her seclusion|?

Last Friday, I saw a very impressive concert of Sally Barker in Osnabrueck.
(Does anybody know her?)
She played some excellent sentimental ballads and had a very good band
(feat. Martin Ansell on guitar and Les Sampson on drums).
