As I continue my studies in Medieval history I've come across a rather 
interesting metaphor, which Dante makes particular use of in his first book 
of the Divine Comedy (the Inferno). In his work Dante makes it known that he 
has strayed from THE PATH and as a result finds himself at the BOTTOM of a 
hill. He wishes to regain the PATH and venture back UP THAT HILL. Now, this 
is all taken to mean that Dante has strayed from God and that he must find 
his way back up to God thus his entire journey through through the Infeerno, 
Purgatorio and Paradiso. Once knowing this, Kate's song Running Up That Hill 
becomes a bit more clear atleast as to why she chose the line "running up 
that hill." It would appear (to me anyway) that Kate is familiar with this 
metaphor (either through Dante or simply by religious training at school) 
and then used it to illustrate that the woman seeks God. If the character 
wishes to make a deal with God she would first need to find God and the way 
to do that would be by RUNNING UP THAT HILL.
  With all that said and done....any other opinions?
I don't think Kate has ever mentioned why she uses that particular line.
