Hi, I recently got another request for the poll.  I guess the space 
available on the gaffa newsgroup may not hold much bulk on some people's 
servers?  Or some new contenders for the Lovehounds mailing list?  
Anyway, I'll post this once every week and a half to catch anyone out 
there up.  You can post your results, mail them to me, Norman Buchwald 
(jbuchwald@huey.csun.edu) or to Robert Little (rlittle@moran.com).  
Thank you!  You have until November 15th, but please respond sooner!  
Also:  The Kate Bush Cover question is directed towards song Kate has 
covered, but go ahead and answer album cover as well, almost everyone 
has.  We'll tabulate those, too.
 
&gt; While the "polls will close" on November 15th, we'd like your results 
&gt;ASAP (we do not want our mailboxes overloaded on the 16th, and have votes 
&gt;be uncounted because they never got to us.)  Also we both would not mind 
&gt;any other volunteers to help tabulate this.  
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;&gt;Oh no!  The polls have hit the Gaffa list now (or maybe the newsgroup was 
&gt;&gt;finally free from them) but what a delightful opportunity for anyone out 
&gt;&gt;there who felt that they never had anything to say to finally 
&gt;&gt;participate.  No, no one's going to count this poll (then again, you 
&gt;&gt;never know), but here's the tough questions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1)  What is your top ten list of Kate Bush songs?  (No, that's not fair. 
&gt;&gt; I'll rephrase the question).  What is your top twenty list of Kate Bush 
&gt;&gt;songs?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;2)  What are your three favorite Kate Bush videos?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;3)  If you could only have one Kate Bush album or mini-album which would 
&gt;&gt;it be?  (This Woman's Work does not count.  Sorry!)  You can include 
&gt;&gt;bootlegs, demos, etc.  Oh, I think I'll be a bit mean.  Hounds Of Love 
&gt;&gt;and The Ninth Wave have to be seen as separate mini-albums on this 
&gt;&gt;question!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;4)  If you could ask Kate one question, what would you ask?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;5)  What is your least liked Kate Bush song?  (the song that you love, 
&gt;&gt;but just not as much as all the others.  I'll be fair)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;6)  What is your favorite Kate Bush cover?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;7)  What is your favorite Kate Bush guest appearance (i.e. "Don't Give 
&gt;&gt;Up," "Sister and Brother," etc.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;8)  How much would you pay to see Kate Bush in concert?  (For people like 
&gt;&gt;me who reside in the States, keep in mind that the only performance she 
&gt;&gt;ever had in the U.S. (that I know of) was on Saturday Night Live in 
&gt;&gt;1978!)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;And if you haven't had enough being interrogated on the net, name some of 
&gt;&gt;your favorite artists, maybe your favorite novels, fiction writers, 
&gt;&gt;poets, etc. and all your other raves, so we can all understand the common 
&gt;&gt;psychology, let me rephrase that, since I already suspect the results.  
&gt;&gt;Uncommon psychology of the Love Hounds.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;                                                       Peace,
&gt;
&gt;                                                       Stormin' Norman
