Many apologies for the Non-Kate KonTent - but these magazine spam  
attacks are *extremely* annoying and I wanted to get this out.  This is  
some info about the attacks that has recently been forwarded around:

Subject: Re: Final SPAM FollowUp From Me

        Gentle Readers one more time:

        First, my thanks to the many of you who wrote me with your
thanks, ideas and suggestions. I could not possibly begin to acknowledge
all the mail.

        I want to point out that this list and its providers do NOT
CONDONE SPAMMING OR RETRIBUTION BEYOND THE LAW.  Courteous Email messages
are fine requesting a cease and desist, but nothing more.

        What we know now, is that Janet Dove and Patricia Eng are
neither; they ACTUALLY are Kevin Lipsitz.  Here is a .signature we found
of Kevin Lipsitz which you may want to file away for reference.
Obviously, kjl.com is his own site; his own machine. Complaining to
'postmaster@kjl.com' will probably not do much good :-)


&gt; Kevin Jay Lipsitz, President   :-)
&gt;
&gt;                    KRAZY KEVIN MAGAZINE CLUB,
&gt; THE INTERNET DIVISION OF COLLEGETOWN MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES:
&gt; "Managing Magazines for Cost-Conscious Busy Professionals, Students,
&gt;    Educators and Regular Consumers Internationally Since 1973."
&gt;                        krazykev@kjl.com

Note he has the nerve to call himself "The Internet division of
Collegetown Magazine Subscription Services" ... busy professionals, busy
students ...just like Janet Dove and Patricia Eng, right?

        Remember that you can contact Kevin to discuss his approach to
mass marketing by phoning 718-967-1234. Listening to his greeting on that
line alone is worth the phone call. You can probably find him at:

        350 Richmond Terrace #5-P
        Staten Island, NY 10301

or at least the people there will know how to contact him. The phone
there is 718-442-3260.  Also, 718-967-1144 is supposed to be a fax
machine he uses.

        You'll also want to inquire from authorities in New York State
and Staten Island (local government) regards if his business is
registered properly. And don't forget inquiries to the Staten Island
postmaster as well.

        You know, based on what I'm hearing in the net.rumor mill
amongst the Administrators and pundits that track this stuff (and the
same was true for Canter &amp; Seigel last year), this guy spoofs up some
Email and reaches 9 million AOL users, 1.75 million Compuserve users, and
Lord knows how many millions of straight Internet users with his mass
mailing at a price that is microscopic compared to what he would have
paid to do it on the WEB, which would be microscopic compared to what he
would've paid to use the U.S. bulk mails.  In so doing, rumor has it that
he gets back something like 20,000 subscription requests and another
40,000 catalog requests ... all for which he collects $3.50 and $.75 each
from the Magazine Company he MOONLIGHTS for.

        DINE N' DASH on the INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY.

He dined on a feast of millions of users, most unsuspecting that this is
unacceptable behavior, and dashed away with what, $100,000.00 !?  Is it
any wonder that others will try this?  What a return! And folks, the
Internet should NOT sit still for it.  Why?  Because in the end, someone
has to pay for all that Internet traffic.  And it wasn't HIM.  So write
your Congresspersons, let's consider some legislation (ugh, if we dare
:-), or something to put some teeth into the consequences of deciding to
shake up the Net for a few grand.

        Final note on Jeff Slaton:  he is apparently employed by (of all
companies) US-West in Albuquerque, but US-West has put him on leave at
this time, and he has been out of the office for awhile. His supervisor
and others there have apparently received _lots_ of correspondence and
phone calls regarding Jeff, so there is no need to bother them further.
As an aside, his social security number was issued in Wisconsin. Perhaps
he grew up there.

        NOW, how about getting back on topic of this List Service...
Technology &amp; Law...like maybe something about the new criminal element on
the InfoBahn, and how to address it? ;-)  Seriously, I think there is a
lot to be said without being overly passionate regarding the whole notion
of the role of the Government, Federal Law, State Law, and regulation as
it applies to crime on the InfoBahn.  Hey, it was at the close of the
last century that laws were finally tough enough to curtail stagecach
robberies. :-)  And we're about to embark on the 21st.

        Later
        Gregory Miller
