&gt;Peter, your priorities are at cross purposes. You feel that
&gt;those short stories of Kate's aren't very good -- stories that
&gt;Kate obviously dashed off at one sitting each. Then in the same
&gt;breath you say that you wish she would "hurry up" with the next
&gt;album! The LAST thing you -- or anyone who appreciates
&gt;Kate's music -- should want is for her to hurry up!

Anticipation...it's making me wait...

&gt;But they ARE interesting from the point of view of the
&gt;student of Kate Bushology. The imagery and the prose style are
&gt;particularly illuminating, in relation to various songs. And parts
&gt;of each are really quite effective, not for their story content but
&gt;for their creation of atmosphere. The same has been said of a number
&gt;of less than successful stories by some of the best short story writers
&gt;in history. Some of Poe's "horror" stories which fail to horrify, for
&gt;example, are nonetheless much admired for their effects of atmosphere and
&gt;power of language, both of which qualities are present to some degree in
&gt;Kate's little stories, as well.

Sigh, it required the sensibilities of the French to bring Poe back
into the eye of the 19th century English-speaking world.  And yet, no
matter how hard I try, there are those who still refuse to accept Our Kate
of Perennial Warmth as their personal savior...meanwhile, Richard
Clayderman remains the best-selling "musician" on the face of the earth.
There Ain't No Justice.

The stories?  Hmmm...the first one was a bit too fairytale-ish for my
tastes, but the imagery in the second story is remarkable for a rush
job.  Barter system: I'll ignore the abundance of "It..." and "I..."'s
in exchange for more descriptions of these little shopping scenes and
the like.

&gt;The second annual Love-Hounds Katemas party went off Friday evening
&gt;with about 20 or 30 people in attendance.  Many thanks to Dave Hsu,
&gt;Doug Alan, Michael Knight, Jon Drukman, etc etc etc for bringing food
&gt;and helping out.  The Bush Bash was a great success and I, for one, am
&gt;looking forward to next year's.

The First Cambridge Love-Hounds Bank thanks you for doing business with
us.  We'll be out to repossess your home, KaTian treasures, and ten
pounds of grapes soon enough.  Have a nice day :-)

And maybe next year, I'll be sufficiently civilized as not to bum a
ride off |&gt;oug just as he's leaving.  Sorry 'bout that.

&gt;For thoose who are wondering: the house was clean and spotless at 10am
&gt;the next morning, leaving nothing for any suspicious parents to worry
&gt;about.

You obviously didn't check in the...oh, never mind.

Kate is God!  Cooper-pairs are history!  I'm beat!
zzzz,

-dave
