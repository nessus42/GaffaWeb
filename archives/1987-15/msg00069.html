Unlike those worthy lovehounds IED and MarK T. I have not found any old
interviews with Kate, so you will have to make do with this piece
of archetypal Melody Maker writing from Dec. 1985 (author not named),
which formed part of their review of the year (RUTH was 2nd best single).

   Apparently adored beyond common reason by the more positively addled members
   of the Maker's legendary critical phalanx, Kate Bush beamed down from
   whatever peculiar orbit of inactivity that had possessed her for the past 
   three years to deliver a new single in August. "Running Up That Hill" was
   lush, exotic, mysterious and almost singlehandedly justified Radio 1's
   perilous existence.

   The success of the single set spines tingling with anticipation for the
   inevitable album, which duly followed in September. Disappointment, however,
   was in the air. "Hounds of Love" was unfortunately dogged by the
   otherworldly Kate's determination to extend her musical vocabulary and
   produce something impressively significant. Thus, the second side of the
   LP was devoted to an elaborate conceptual piece, "The Ninth Wave". Even
   her most ardent critical paramours were forced to admit that this
   unwieldy epic stretched both the patience and credibility of the listener.
[the MM bozos obviously did not consult any real fans for their opinion - nbc]
   "A blurred metaphysical overview of the meaning of life," was Colin Irwin's
   [who?] kindly description of a work that took as its principal themes magic,
   death, spiritual existence and reincarnation but failed, eventually, to
   make much sense of anything.

   Happy enough, however, in her hippy nirvana [Eh!], Kate made plans to 
   translate her musical extravaganza in to a full-blown video production,
   but with no plans to take the show on the road, it would come as no
   overwhelming surprise to the committed Bush-observer if she suddenly
   beamed back out of sight again. If this proves to be the case it would
   leave the multitudes bewailing her absence and the hearts of the majority
   of Maker males cracking like old bones.

Obviously an attempt by someone not very familiar with Kate's work to write
a "clever" piece but having to resort to all the old cliches and stereotyped
ideas about her e.g. hippy, sex symbol, otherworldly et cetera. 

Be seeing you.
