I can't say that Kate is a GOD either. Kate is an unique artist 
who I believe deserves alot more credit that she is getting (esp.
here in the states). I think that we can say that Kate has 
influenced many people and artists. You're right there are several 
other artists and groups out there. As much as I love Kate, I 
can't listen to her stuff 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I would be 
loosing out on so much other stuff. Anyone doing that is selling 
themselves short. I've learned alot from Kate's music both from 
the techinical aspects of her writting and from the views that 
Kate writes about. I've started to listen to a bit more folk music 
now. I listened to Jazz, classical and popular before I heard 
about Kate. 

I'm glad to see that you have seen personal growth. I think alot 
of us have. Perhaps those people who call Kate GOD have seen this 
growth also. But its still great to hear a different mix of a song
just to see how it has progressed. I think we've seen a little bit 
of us in Kate. The whole mysticism that surrounds Kate is what 
makes her GOD to some people. Take that away and she's just like 
the rest of us with talents that we admire. I can say that I don't 
NEED Kate, but enjoy the talents of hers that I don't have.
