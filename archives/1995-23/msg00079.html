&gt; It's not junk.  It's manchapuriata, but I've been able to figure out
&gt; most or all of how to convert it back into the .pdf. (Got to dash
&gt; and do some other stuff before I learn whether the job is done.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Look, mate.  Will you stop posting binaries in here?  Upload to an
&gt;&gt; FTP site, by all means, or post them to a binaries group.  But refrain
&gt;&gt; from effectively mail-bombing the group.  Have a little consideration
&gt;&gt; for those that pay for their own news feed.
&gt;
&gt; This is really unkind.  Bergstrom is trying to make available
&gt; something that most of us would like to have, and the attempt has
&gt; clearly involved significant effort on his part.  If you =had= to
&gt; slam him, couldn't you have done that with direct email?
&gt; 
&gt; _I_ didn't want 1.4 megabytes of uuencoded and BASE64 data for a
&gt; document I can't use coming into _my_ personal mailbox.

Right.  Now, tell me where I said that it was =appropriate= for him
to post the uuencodings.  Can't?  That's because I didn't.

&gt; Apparently you are ignorant of the nature of
&gt; rec.music.gaffa/Love-Hounds.

Nope.  I know what it is, and I know English, and I know logic.
You've fallen down somewhere with respect to the last two, and have
made an absurd inferential leap in your interpretation of my
remarks.

&gt;                               rec.music.gaffa is not just a
&gt; mailing list, it's a mail-news gateway.  So when this moron
&gt; posted and REPOSTED that gigantic file, it meant that every
&gt; mailing list subscriber got either a 1.4M digest or 1.4M of loose
&gt; mail as a result.

He neither was nor is a moron.  You aren't a moron either, but you
certainly have a problem.

&gt;                    This is unacceptable.  The people who didn't
&gt; want that gigantic piece of junk shouldn't be forced to swallow
&gt; it because thre are a few people who did,

No one said that they should.  Try again, or shut up.

&gt;                                           and anyone who is
&gt; ignorant enough to post binaries to a mail-news gateway deserves
&gt; to be flamed into unconsciousness.

Bull____.  Everyone starts out ignorant.  He made a mistake in the
course of having invested a significant effort trying to be helpful.
The appropriate response was quick, firm, polite email -- not flames
to rec.music.gaffa.

          It's always Dark.  Light only hides the Darkness.
