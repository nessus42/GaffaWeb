From: jw@math.mit.edu

&gt;   Anyway, the guy said that the domestic version of _Hounds_of_Love_
&gt; rates a 9.5 out of 10, so he doubted that any import would be
&gt; noticeably better. (He also gave 9 or better to domestic CDs of TWS,
&gt; NFE and TKI (for initial-hounds)), but _Lionheart_ fell short, 6.5
&gt; or something. Oddly enough, no number for _Dreaming_, he said maybe
&gt; it wasn't widely available (!)

Hmmm. I have TKI, HoL, Lionheart on the imported label (EMI) while my
copies of NFE and The Dreaming are on the domestic (EMI America)
label. Both domestic CD's have a very good sound quality. I was
concerned about both at purchase time but I ended up pleasantly
suprised. Of the imports, TKI exhibits some hiss but the clarity in
the vocals leads me to believe that this is more a problem of the
recording equipment in that era than a problem with using an inferior
copy of the original master tape. TKI on EMI is still very good.  When
I say there is some hiss I am being somewhat picky.

While I haven't heard the domestic Lionheart CD I can say the the
import is excellent. It is at least as good as the sound quality of
the domestic copy of NFE that I have (which by the rating above would
put it at a "9 or better") This is easy for me to remember since this
is my favorite Kate CD and I rarely get out of the house in the
morning without listening to at least 5 songs off of that CD.  (I
notice that most people here seem to favor The Dreaming. Am I the only
one picking Lionheart above her other works?)

      [	Polls consistently show *Lionheart* to be the least favored of
	Kate's albums by far.  It's also Kate's least favorite because
	it was very rushed.  -- |&gt;oug ]

BTW, does Kate belt it out during the chorus of "(Don't put your foot
on the) Heartbrake" or what! After hearing here daintily (sp?)
singing the chorus to "In search of Peter Pan" it was somewhat of a
suprise to hear her cut loose on "Heartbrake" just a couple of songs
later (the first time I listened to the CD).
