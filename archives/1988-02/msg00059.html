     Thanks for the info re the martello tower on the cover of the
Temple of Truth Kate Bush bootleg. IED will check it out tonight, but
it sounds like that's what it is, all right.
     Regarding Kirsty MacColl: She's not just some bimbo of Steve
Lillywhite's, nor even "just" his wife. She's a British recording
artist and songwriter in her own right, with some six years of
releases to her credit. Her first single was the self-penned "They
Don't Know," from about 1979 or so. A cover of the song was later a
big hit for Tracey Ullmann -- unfortunately, since MacColl's recording
is much, much better. M.'s own biggest hit came a couple of years
later, with another self-written record called "The Guy Who Works at
the Chips Shop Down the Corner," or something like that (Neil Calton
might be able to help out here?), and IED has a vague memory of a
third record with a song with "Elvis" in the title...
     She also put out an LP in England a few years ago; perhaps
there's more than one by now. Anyway, it's light, sixties-influenced
pop music, but expertly written and performed, for the most part, and
certainly good enough to merit her being defined as more than an
appendage to a record producer.
     Re Monsoon: After the official break-up of Monsoon, Chandra
released at least three albums of additional material (increasingly
self-penned) under her own name (Sheila Chandra), but all of which was
performed and produced with the original Monsoon team. And there is
now a Dutch-made compact disc compilation of some of her best tracks
(though not all of the Monsoon-proper hits are included). It's
excellent.

-- Andrew Marvick, who still remembers (vaguely) what it was like to
   be under the sad delusion that there were other living musicians
   worth paying attention to besides Kate Bush.

P.S.: The Ballad of Lizzie Wan

(Note: This is one of more than seven different versions of the
ballad. Kate has identified this ballad -- under the title "The Ballad
of Lucy Wan" -- as the source for her song "The Kick Inside".)

 1. Fair Lucy sitting in her father's room,
    Lamenting and a-making her mourn;
    And in steps her brother James:
    O what's fair Lucy done?

 2. It is time for you to weep,
    Lamenting and a-making your mourn.
    Here's a babe at my right side,
    And it is both mine and yourn.

 3. O what will you do when your father comes home?
    Dear son, come tell to me.
    I'll set my foot into some little ship
    And I'll sail plumb over the sea.

 4. O what will you do with your house and land?
    Dear son, come tell to me.
    I'll leave it here, my old, dear mother;
    Be kind to my children three.

 5. O what will you do with your pretty, little wife?
    Dear son, come tell to me.
    She can set her foot in another little ship
    And follow after me.

 6. Back home, back home will you return?
    Dear son, come tell to me.
    When the sun and the moon sets in yon hill,
    And I hope that'll never be.

A longer version will follow soon.
