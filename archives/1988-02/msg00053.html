Hi.

   Boy, did I receive a suprise tonight!  It all started several years
ago...

   Tonight I bought TD's Golden Age of Wireless CD.  A couple of years
ago, a friend had made a copy of his TD:GAW CD (to tape) for me.  So,
I decided to finally buy the CD for myself.  But the version I bought
tonight is *quite* different from his version.  I then remembered him
saying that there were several versions released; one had _Puppet
Show_ &amp; _Urges_ on it in place of some other songs (or something like
that).  Well, the copy I got tonight has all the songs that my tape
has (She Blinded Me With Science; Radio Silence; Airwaves; Flying
North; Weightless; Europa &amp; The Pirate Twins; Windpower; Commercial
Breakup; One Of Our Submarines; Cloudburst At Shingle Street).

But, there are big differences:
	(1) SBMWS starts off different: Instead of the normal/popular
		version where the intro goes 'up' the scale, the intro
		goes down, much like the later chorus.  Thus, the intro
		is shorter.
	(2) SBMWS seems quite shorter (is it??)
	(3) SBMWS does not have the drums at the end (how disappointing! :-(
	(4) Airwaves has a different line or two in the middle of the song
		(I've been working on things as I'm listening to it, hence
		 I'm not paying a lot of attention to the differences).
	(5) Other songs seem to have more (and less) background noises, etc.

   Here is a description of the cover of the CD:

   Given that the paper insert is 4 3/4 x 4 3/4 inches, there is a
drawing of a magazine cover (The Golden Age of Wireless) in the
middle.  It measures about 3 x 3 3/4.  To the left of the mag cover is
a faint image of a man in a wheel chair with a nurse
standing_behind/pushing the wheelchair.  To the left is a bust
(statue) of someone.

   On the back (which has a medium-dark green border with and
tanish-green insert with the songs listed on the insert) there are
numbers:
	CDP 7 46009 2      (DIDX 251)

   The CD is put out by Capital with "(P) 1982 except *(P) 1981,
Original Sound Recordings made by EMI Records Ltd.  (C) 1983 EMI
Records Ltd."
 
   Sooo...  Can anyone help me?  Do I have a new, corrupted (:-)
version of the original releases?  Or do I have an older CD??  How can
I distingiush my CD from the other version(s)?  Where can I get the
other version???

   Please e-mail me the replies since (due to local events) I will not
be reading the newsfeed (rec.music.gaffa) often.  If there is heavy
interest, or reply, I will summarise and post.

   Thank you very much.

Jon Scheer
