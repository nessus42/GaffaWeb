Dear People,

  This is my first posting. I am a Kate Bush fan, obviously. She is my
favorite singer at this time (although Tori Amos is gaining ground....
and it would help Ms. Bush if she released a new album soon.) I am not
as fanatical about my love of her music as a lot of people, but I do
very much enjoy it.

  I started listening to her my freshman year in college. I had The
Whole Story and Hounds of Love. The Whole Story was an incredible album,
although I didn't like Hounds of Love. (In fact I had only listened to
the first side for about the first year that I had it.) One day I listened
to Hounds of Love and it knocked me on my ass. That was the "changing point."

  I bought most of her other albums with in a few weeks. (I think Lionheart
was the last album that I bought of hers.) Within a year of "discovering"
Kate Bush, The Sensual World was released. Needless to say, I bought 2 
copies on the first day (one for me, one for my girl friend.) It became our
album. So much emotion. Also needless to say, our relationship did not last,
and we broke up. A year or so latter I saw the video to 'Love and Anger'.
Kate talked before it and said that she really didn't know what the song was
about, but I knew. This would have to be my favorite song.

  I love Kate Bush's music. I don't love her (although I do have 4 posters
in my room, one being a wall sized Sensual World poster.) I don't have
everything that she has ever released. I love to talk to people about what
they like about her music and her. I think that it is interesting how people
think that things that happen in a singers life affect or don't affect their
music. I am of the opinion that everything that happens in a persons life
affects their music. Major or minor. This is because they express who they are
through their music. And who they are is the sum total of what has happened
in their life. So I do like to hear about the people.

  If I happen to ask things that have already been asked before, or say things
that are obviosly wrong, please don't shove it back in my face. I have only
read one interveiw of hers a long time ago, I don't bring my CDs to work, where
I have a computer and I don't have a very good memory for specifics. Take
these things into consideration please.

  I have only been reading the postings for about three days, so I don't know
people or what you talk about very much, so be patient with me.

  I would like to make a comment before asking a couple of questions though.
Chris Williams: please think before you post. Brian (?) was asking a question
an honest question. If you have had "fan"tacies about your "heroes" don't
automatically think that everyone else does too. If I were to ask if Kate
Bush belongs to the National Rifle Ass. would you automatically think that I
have fanticies about Kate carrying a berreta. Even though, in your eyese, I
am a larve (I would write it in smaller letters but my computer doesn't do
that) doesn't mean that I or anyone else can ask honest questions. And if
you think that it is none of my business to know whatever it is that I asked,
just say so, don't attack mine (or anyone elses character.)

  Keep in mind that most Kate Bush fans are pretty nice, caring people.

  Sorry for the steam outlet.

  Now for the possibly stupid question (which are probably in the FAQ, but
I haven't been able to down load them yet):

  When is her new album coming out? I read in a paper that it was supposed to
be out in the Spring, but spring is almost over and no album...

  Is she actually going to tour? (maybe catch a grey hound...)

  Hope they weren't to stupid...
