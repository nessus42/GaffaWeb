        Burning Desire - This is another bootleg CD from the 
Hammersmith soundtrack.  The sound quality is bad, it sounds like being 
copied from
an vinyl disc with all it's scratches... It is the worst sound quality 
of
Hammersmith bootleg CDs.
        It's cover shows a color photo of Kate in a red dress, posing 
as in the Babooshka video, holding a double bass. On the left side of 
the photo, written black on yellow, there is the title of the album: 
'Kate Bush - "Burning Desire" - Limited collector's edition'. The 
inside of the one-sheet-'booklet' shows a newspaper-quality b/w photo 
of Kate's head. The CD itself doesn't mention it's contents, remember 
the discussion about 'Back Sides': On it there is the following: 'Alive 
And Well - Vintage Radio Network - Produced by: David Heinz, Recorded &amp; 
Mixed by: Sheila Banrnes - Basic I, For Promotion Only, Not For Sale'. 
The backside of the CD shows three newspaper-quality b/w photos from 
the American Kick Inside photo session with Kate in a box, then 
'Recorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon, London 5/13/79', then a track 
list with two additional spaces ('Heart Brake' and 'Lion Heart'), then 
'(R) 1989 Swingin' Pigs Records, A Trademark Of Swingin' Pigs S.A.R.L, 
Luxembourg /S.R.L. Italy'. Below that the following: 'There are few 
artists out there who can manage to deliver starkly 
original,non-derivative material and still approach mainstream 
accessibility. Kate Bush Is One Of These Rare Artists.'


LIVE CDS

        _Kate_Bush_Live_ (or _Live_At_Hammersmith_1979_). (1989) By its 
physical make-up IED strongly suspects that it is a product from the 
same group who have been putting out the now-famous Beatles 
_Back-Track_ and _Off-White_ CDs. The package of this KT CD is a normal 
jewel-box, with a hard-card cover (folded over once), and four colour 
photographs of Kate on the front. The track listings are almost 
completely accurate and are clearly set out. The photo/track- listing 
card is very sharply printed and glossy. Also on the cover is a red 
official KBC "KT" symbol--though of course this is _not_ an official 
producet. 
     The CD contains fifteen tracks. The first twelve are simply the 
same old _Live_at_Hammersmith_Odeon_ audio-track, though this time it 
has been very well lifted from the new Japanese edition of the 
laser-disk, which features a digital re-mastering of the original 
analog tapes. Track thirteen is the live performance of _Running_Up_ 
That_Hill_ from the _Amnesty_International_Secret_Policeman's_Third_ 
Ball_:_The_Music_ CD. Track fourteen is the live performance of 
_Breathing_ from the _Comic_Relief:_Utterly_Utterly_Live_ CD. And track 
fifteen is the track _This_Woman's_Work_ from the _She's_Having_ 
a_Baby_ soundtrack CD. The three extra tracks are re-mixed so that the 
applause from the end of the _Hammersmith_ tape fades into the applause 
from _Running_Up_That_Hill_, and ditto for _Breathing_. The only error 
in the track-listing is in the identification of the two live tracks as 
both coming from 1988. Actually both are from at least a year earlier. 
No big deal. The sound of all these tracks is exceptionally good even 
for a legitimate release, and unheard of in the history of Kate Bush 
bootlegs. Nevertheless, its price may be considered very high by many 
fans, especially those who already have these recordings in their 
original, legitimate configuration.
        Front cover:  four color pix, including a second take from the 
pose used for the US cover of "The Kick Inside" and three others most 
likely from those sessions.  Inside face:  the famous EMI publicity 
photo for that album.  Cropped, some (ref. Vermorel p. 62).
        Cover Title:  Kate Bush Live.  Title on disk:  Kathy Live from 
Wuthering Heights (Neutral Zone [Korea] NZCD89010), AAD.
        Back photo, the still used for the "Hammersmith" video and the 
KTBand logo.  Correspondence address:

        _Performed_Live_In_London_1979. (1991) The hammersmith film 
soundtrack, good but not as good as _Kate_Bush_Live_.  On it's cover it 
is simply 'Live In London', but you could identify it easier by saying 
that it is the 'Super Golden Radio Shows No. 013 - Kate Bush - Live in 
London'. It's 'order number' is  'SRGS 013'. 
        The front cover of this CD shows, similar to every other SRGS 
CD I have seen, a picture of the artist, a dark grey border with pink 
'SUPER GOLDEN RADIO SHOWS No 013', orange 'KATE BUSH' above and 'LIVE 
IN LONDON 1979' below the picture.  The picture is a quite greenish 
photo that shows Kate in a costume that reminds of the Wuthering 
Heights performance on the Hammersmith video, but it isn't!
        This bootleg is, as many others, made in Italy. They even state 
the following:
        'We bring to the attention of the performing artists, 
components of the musical group, as indicated on the back side of the 
album cover, that upon publication of the present phonographic 
recording, the deposit of a sum for each copy made as fair 
consideration has been made on their behalf and/or on behalf of their 
assignees as provided for under article 80 and following L. 22/4/1941 
no 633. Important notice: This record is not authorized by the 
performing artist.'

        This text is on the inside of the booklet that gives a list of 
all other SRGS boots available. I wonder if the 'deposit of a sum' 
exceeds one penny...

        Notes: Recorded live in concert 1979
        On the cover is the note - 'We apologize for the non excellent 
quality of the recording, which has been realized with sixties amateur 
equipment'.
        Comments:   Although the above note implies that this is a 
bootleg the CD is listed in German import catalogues under the number 
(036-092).  The quality is very good except that in a couple of places 
a 'surface noise' can be heard, as though this is a digital copy of a 
record. This noise is minimal and does not distract from the well 
edited performance. It sounds like if it has gone through an equalizer 
to lift the higher frequencies (or through a dynamic extender). Or as 
if it originally has been recorded with some kind of
dolby without removing that.
        The picture on front of the cover shows a motive that I 
immediately recognized as a Kate-motive, even if it is not Kate at all. 
It is a girl with a 'steep' haircut, looking at a flying bird, wearing 
a chain around the neck and some kind of 'Kite'-wings.


    'Kate Bush - Wow' - GDR CD 9213 (Great Dane Records, Italy, 9/92)  
The contents is the usual Hammersmith video soundtrack, medium to good  

quality. It has not gone through a dynamic expander like 'Feel It 
Live'. The booklet shows a white-on-violet 'Kate Bush' in the top inch, 
the rest is a picture of Kate in her green costume, dancing in the 
red-cushioned 'wheel', there's a blue 'Wow' in the lower right corner. 
The back of the CD and the booklet shows a picture of the 'Hammer 
Horror' performance,  the inner side of the booklet shows two more 
pictures, page '2' shows Kate, sitting on a chair with the back of the 
chair in front, the background shows red (or white illuminated with red 
light) spots on a darker background. Then there's a four side list of 
other live boots, then another picture of Kate, flying in the arms of 
Gary Hurst and Stewart Avon Arnold, performing 'Kite'. All four 
pictures are not the best quality, quite dark and reddish- 
violettish... 
        The track list is a little bit irritating, track four is just 
'Strange', track eleven is 'On England My Linearity'. Furthermore, they 
say that it is recorded 'live in Amsterdam, Holland, Avril 29, 1979'. 
This is not right, it is the well-known Hammersmith soundtrack. At 
least Kate was in Amsterdam on April 29, 1979... The durations of the 
tracks is not listed correctly too, so it is propably best to ignore 
any text that is written on the CD or in the booklet. 


        Kate Bush &amp; Peter Gabriel - Angels On Earth - This is a bootleg 
CD with the Xmas special soundtrack. Unfortunately, it's sound quality 
doesn't go above the quality of my video of the show. It's cover shows 
a scene that looks like from the German 'In Concert', showing the live 
performance of 'Room For The Life', Kate sitting in the big round red 
cushioned 'wheel', with Stewart Avon Arnold and Gary Hurst turning that 
big wheel, but the photo is not in good quality. Above the photo is 
'Kate Bush' and 'Peter Gabriel', below 'Angels On Earth'. The backside 
of this one-sheet-booklet is a list of other 'The Grand Pick'-records 
and the same text piece about depositing a sum as on the 'Performed 
Live...' CD above. In addition they state that 'The quality of this 
record is not equivalent to recent standards.' The disc itself has 
green-on-white printing on it. There is a track listing where Peter 
became the author of 'Just Another Day'. Wasn't 'Another Day' a Roy 
Harper song? Additionally there is 'Kate Bush &amp; Peter Gabriel - "Angels 
On Earth" - Live in Europe 1979' on the CD, it's "order number" is TGP 
139, and it is '(P) 1991 by THE GRAND PICK Records, ITALY'.
On the back there is 'Live In Europe 1979', the same track listing as 
on the CD.


        Butterfly Kisses (1993) - Contents: 
 
        1. wuthering heights (this is apparently from some tv program - 
i can think
 of two possibilities, though i do not know which this is from - i had 
never heard this recording of the song before, however.
        2. the wedding list (prince's trust gala concert, 21 july 1982) 
This particular cut is apparently dubbed from vinyl (which is a 
disappointment to me, since the track is readily availiable on video in 
hi-fi sound), probably from the PASSING THROUGH AIR vinyl bootleg. 
Sound quality is still pretty good.     3. the man with the child in 
his eyes (unidentified tv performance, possibly from saturday night 
live, but i'm not sure.) 
        4. them heavy people (unidentified tv performance - features 
backing vocals by a woman who does not sound like Kate at all.) 
        These cuts appear to be from a tape source, possibly a bootleg 
video. 
Sound quality is about what you would expect if someone dubbed Kate's 
SNL performance with a typical VCR of that time period. 
        5. under the ivy (the tube) This version appeared on the vinyl 
bootleg "Under the Ivy Bush". The cut on the CD appears to be from a 
tape source, however. The sound quality of this cut is very good. 
        6. breathing (comic relief concert, 4/6 april 1986) 
        7. do bears ... in the woods (comic relief conerts, 4/6 april 
1986 duet with rowan atkinson.)  Taken from a vinyl copy of the 
"Utterly Utterly Live-Comic Relief" album. 
        8. running up that hill (the secret policeman's third ball, 2nd 
night - with david gilmour on guitar) Taken from a vinyl copy of "The 
Secret Policeman's Third Ball" 
        9. the long and winding road (sound in s, japanese tv, 23 june 
1978)   
        10. she's leaving home (sound in s, japanese tv, 23 june 1978) 
        11. moving (unidentified tv performance, possible 7th tokyo 
song festival, 
18 june 1978)
        These last three cuts are taken from the 7" bootleg single 
"Live In Japan". Some surface noise is audible, but the recording is 
still very listenable.  Note that the CD lists 'moving' before 'the 
long and winding road' and 'she's leaving home', but actually appears 
in the order listed above.  The bootleggers apparently played side 2 of 
the aforementioned single first and copied down the side 1 to side 2 
order in the track listings. 
 
        The rest of the cd is all tracks taken from the German TV 
documentary of the tour (entry 47 in The Garden video listing): room 
for the life/strange phenomena/violin/in the warm room/kite/wuthering 
heights. 
        Some of these tracks on the CD have incomplete intros and/or 
conclusions, 
probably stemming from the omission of the interviews. Sound quality is 
pretty good and seems to be from a tape source. 
        the packaging is decent: the cover is KaTe done up in the 
violin getup that she wore in the bbc special. inside the jewel booklet 
(which is more a pamph- 
let, i should say) are three black'n'white shots of KaTe in a dancing 
leo- 
tard and tights - maybe i'll digitize them sometime. 
        as i mentioned before, sound quality is fair to good as 
bootlegs go. strong recording levels were used, so that is a good sign. 
don't expect to hear crystalline sounds if you buy this, but it is not 
muddled beyond reconition either.
