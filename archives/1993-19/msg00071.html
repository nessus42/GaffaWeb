&gt;well - there are not too many files missing on MY computer. Completing my 
&gt;archive is something that I wanted to do for a long time now. But
unfortunately
&gt;I have no ftp access from @home - in no direction :-(. (And I am NOT going to
&gt;email these 80 or so Megabytes (unpacked) to anyone. Hey! What about a
CD-ROM?)
&gt;Let's talk about the text file format. I could offer TeX, PostScript, plain 
&gt;ASCII, rtf (w/out hypertext and pictures, then it could be read by many
&gt;MS-WINDOWS applications as MS-Word). Of course there's also the possibility
&gt;to put it on the ftp server in several formats, but that would a) increase
&gt;space usage and b) increase difficulty in maintaining it.

chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu replies...
&gt;  When Ron Hill finishes his various projects (Cloudbusting, Deeper
&gt;Understanding) we could create a really wonderful CD-Rom. I believe we
&gt;could assemble a standard data format and then we would only need a
&gt;interface script for each platform. I don't know the name of the spec,
&gt;but there is one format that is supported by DOS, Mac, Amiga, UNIX and
&gt;NeXt for text files. The entire projects, and the complete archive could
&gt;easily fit on one CD-ROM, along with indexing information for each
&gt;format, with room for plenty of pictures and a few important sound
&gt;files.
&gt;   I'll start checking out the tools used to create Windows "Help"
&gt;files. It seems to be an OK semi-hypertext format.   

    Yes YES -YES-!! This has been a pet idea of mine as well! I always thought
a fitting tribute to 10 years of gaffa would be to produce a CD-ROM containing
ALL 10 years. CD-ROM's are great in that they (currently) use the 'ISO 9660'
file access standard. All personal computer platforms have CD-ROM drivers that
can read the this standard. All you need is to have the actual gaffa text (in a
standardised 'news' format) stored in a data section, and then have reader
applications for each of the standard PC platforms in another section such that
ANYBODY could read, search and print the data in the normal way. There could be
a section for 'The Garden', 'Cloudbusting' and 'Deeper Understanding' with data
stored in simple text and maybe standard WP format, once again acorrding to PC
platform. Piccies and sound would be just cream on the top!! We're looking at
having about 600Mb of space to burn on a CD-ROM. How much bulk does the
archives take up at the moment? How about the IED and Ron Hill projects?
