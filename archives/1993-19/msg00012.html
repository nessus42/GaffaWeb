Hi

I've made out two new (?) coverversions of Kate's songs. Well at least
they seemed new to me, but perhaps you know them already.

Here they are:
Running up that Hill                    - by "TILT!"
The Man with the child in his eyes      - by "Dark Orange"

Let me start with the RUTH cover, it's so awful. Argh, it almost killed
me, really. I can only describe it as a industrial-darkwave-hardcore
version. Someone yells out the lyrics above a stomping rhythm. Only the
keyboard melody sounds familiar which is played by a noisy brass synth,
as far as I remember. Everyone who loves Kate has to burst out in tears
when he hears this. I'd say one could hardly do it worse.
The song appears on "Tilt!"'s 1991 album 'aliens &amp; orgams' released
by german goth-label 'danse macabre'. Distributed by EFA. (You can
forget the label as well as the band)

The Man with the Child in his eyes version by german Wave-Pop Band
"Dark Orange" may be better, but still not very good. 
What they did is, they tried to copy the song  1:1. Only the female 
vocalist reminds me more of Juliane Regan of All about Eve than of Kate. 
Not very impressing nor bad.
The Man with the Child in his eyes appears as a bonus track on Dark Orange's
latest CD-Single called 'Sounds of Silence' out on german label
HYPERIUM/Rough Trade. It was a limited edition and is not available anymore
except for mailorder. If you need the address, mail me.
HYPERIUM also released the song on a CD-Compilation called 
'KODEXtonkunst NR 2' (out on KODEX/Efa) sold out, but still 
availabe via mailorder I think.

I think, man with the child is Kates most covered song, am I right ?
The best cover is done by HUE AND CRY if you ask me. Really wonderful.
What do you think ?
How about putting together a list of all the Kate-coverversions with
notes where and when released ? Or has this already been done ? 
Anyway, I didn't find it in the archive. 

                                        Bye, Michael.
