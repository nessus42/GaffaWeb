KATE INFO 
 
At a fan club convention in November 1990, Kate announced that she 
hoped to have a new album finished by the end of 1991, and that she was 
planning to "play some dates" at the end of 1991, her first 'tour' 
since her only tour 
in 1979.  Del Palmer told a fan it might include some in the US.  In 
her latest interview (December '91) Kate said her album might be out 
the "middle to later part" of 1992, though now, of course, we're hoping 
we can expect it in 1993.  :-(  The tour is as far as anyone knows 
still in the works, but of course the album must be finished first.  
Eric Clapton definately plays on several of the tracks.
        Kate's buoyant cover of Rocket Man finally arrived October 22, 
on the Elton John tribute album "Two Rooms", and a CDsingle with Kate's 
cover of "Candle in the Wind" as B-sid' is out in the UK.  Kate also 
made a video for "Rocket Man" (not commonly seen yet in America) and 
performed the song on Britain's Wogan program.  

Fans of Kate were saddened by the news of the passing of her mother on 
Valentine's day, 1992. 
 
Kate's earliest band was called the KT Bush Band, (KT being readable as 
Katie), and all her albums have had a KT emblem hidden somewhere on the 
cover.  It can also be seen in the _Army_Dreamers_ and _The_Big_Sky_ 
videos.  (The initials KT can also be seen in the _Army_Dreamers_ 
video.)  With the release of the This Woman's Work boxed set in the UK, 
Japan and Canada, she introduced a new version of the symbol, 
integrating a  
"K" and a "T" with the                    _O_ 
biological symbol for woman.               |&lt; 
 
        FAQS AND MOST COMMON ANSWERS: No, she's not married, but she 
has a longstanding Significant Other: Del Palmer, her bassist.  Yes, 
she smokes, and we all hope she'll stop.  Yes, she's a vegetarian, 
though she now eats fish.  5'3", no middle name.  She has two brothers, 
John Carter Bush (Jay), born 1944-- he takes many of the photos of Kate 
that appear on her albums-- and Paddy Bush, b. 1952, who plays many of 
the exotic instruments found on Kate's albums.  Yes, she is indeed a 
fox.
        No, she doesn't hate to tour, just can't find the time between 
making albums and videos.  Yes, she appeared on Saturday Night Live in 
1978, but the tape you can purchase of that show has her edited out!  
Yes, that's Donald Sutherland in the Cloudbusting video.  No, we don't 
have her home address!
        Well, at the end of "Hello, Earth" the German words are: 
"Tiefer, tiefer, irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht" This means: 
"deeper, deeper, somewhere in the depth there is a light."
 

Albums: 
        The Cathy Demos (Twenty three bootleg gems ca. 1975-1977??)  
Five of these are demos of songs that later albums.  Available on 
various bootlegs.  (Anybody have an early 80's album called THE EARLY 
YEARS?)  There are also six "Kick Inside demos", which include an 
unreleased song "Scares Me Silly".  Also there are two Babooshka demos 
and various other songs on boots. 
        The Kick Inside (TKI: passionate and girlish, includes her 
British megahit Wuthering Heights, 1978)  
        Lionheart (LH: rushed, rewarmed TKI is still absolute genius, 
1978)  Now in special $80 "Lioness At Heart" edition, which includes 
t-shirt and album sized photo-book.
        Never For Ever [There is a box set for this as well]  (NfE: 
Kate begins producing, ascends into the sixth level of enlightenment, 
1980)
        The Dreaming (TD: The Seventh Level of Enlightenment. Too naked 
for more timid souls.  Play it... LOUDER! 1982) 
        The Single File (Boxset of 45's, *tres* collectible. 1983) 
        Hounds of Love (HoL: One side delectably bright, one side 
deliciously shadowy.  The shadowy side is a never-filmed movie of a 
drowning woman's last hours in the sea.  Does she survive?  Kate says 
so, your mileage may vary. 1985) 
        The Whole Story (TWS: compilation-cum-video, 1986) 
        The Sensual World (TSW: Her "most feminine" album, whatever 
that means. Noisily engineered.  Some love it, some don't quite love 
it, especially "Reaching Out".  1989) 
        This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW).  Not released in the U.S.A.  
 Awefully pricey, and no lryics or credits on the extra disks.  
Includes extra disks I and II: 
        Almost all B-sides, dance-mixes, and other incidentals are 
collected on the extra disks, but not all.  Major songs missing are: 
Dreamtime (The Dreaming instrumental/remix), Running Up That Hill 
(instrumental), The Sensual World (instrumental), Be Kind to My 
Mistakes (original soundtrack album version, much longer than and very 
different from the single re-mix, most like it better), The 
Confrontation (instrumental from the Comic Strip film, GLC)
        Doesn't included any previously unreleased material or session 
work with other artists.  Great music though, yeah! 1990)  

        The Japanese version of this boxset has: 
--no stickers (umpteen almost-identical KTfems symbols - tell us if you 
think of something to do with em?), 
--more/bigger books in Japanese with non-canonical lyrics in English, 
--the Japanese album-covers for TKI and NfE, and 
--the mythical "better-sounding CDs" (tell us if you believe this). 


        Official video tapes are:
    Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1981).  TV special of Kate's only 
concert tour, unfortunately it contains only one hour out of the two 
and a half hour show.  The missing footage has never been seen, aside 
from one showing at the 1985 Kate Bush Convention.
        The Whole Story (1986). Contains most of Kate's videos up to 
1986.
        The Single File (1983).  Contains all of Kate's video up till 
1983. Similar to The Whole Story, but contains five videos not on The 
Whole Story (the earlier "Wow" video, Hammer Horror, Them Heavy People, 
Suspended In Gaffa, There Goes A Tennor) and lacks the newer videos.  
Not available in the U.S.A., but it is available on import from Canada.
        The Sensual World (1989). Contains videos from that album and 
interview footage.  The American version contains much less interview 
footage then the British version.  The British version is the complete 
1989 VH-1 special.
        The Hair Of The Hound (1986) is now out of date, as The Whole 
Story contains everything on The Hair Of The Hound. 

                There are also more then a hundred "underground" 
videos, which are traded amoung fans and are shown at Katemas parties 
and the like.  These are primarily television performances and 
interviews. 

Printed books on Kate are numerous, more details about and corrections 
to
these books are available in the archives:

        Kate Bush - A Visual Documentary (1988).  Probably the best 
liked book overall.
        Kate Bush Complete - "Official" book containing the sheet music 
to all of Kate's songs up to 1986.  Also contains separate lyrics, a 
great chronology, many photos, and a discography.  
        Cathy (1986) - Book of photos of Kate as a child, by her 
brother, John Carter Bush.  No longer available. :-(
        The Illustrated Collector's Guide To Kate Bush (1991) - Book 
with details and pictures of all kinds of Kate Kollectables, fun even 
for non-collectors.  To order send $13.95 to C-SIDE RECORDS, PO BOX 
8456
CLEARWATER, FL  34618.  Phone 1-813-461-4327.  C-SIDE is also a good 
place to get all kinds of Kate stuff, be sure to get on their mailing 
list.
        Kate Bush - The Whole Story (1988).  Despite appearances, not a 
sanctioned book, and certainly not the whole story.   Positive, but 
contains numerous factual and publishing errors.  For "The Whole Story" 
on this book, see Andrew Marvick's review in the archives.
        Kate Bush - The First Twelve Years [1992].  Homeground says: is 
another collection of newpaper and magazine cutting covering the years 
from 1978 in two volumes selling for about L12-00 in Britain and L15 
postpaid to America.  Details can be obtained via the fanzine Never For 
Ever.   [See below]
        Kate Bush - With Love (1988).  Reprints of Kate-related 
articles, interviews, and reviews, some positive, some negative.  
Interesting mainly to see how the music press has reacted to Kate over 
the years.
        Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop) 
(1983). Intellectual (as opposed to intelligent) book abut Kate's 
family history,
story, and fans.  Commonly available, but only recommend for the 
photos.
        Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia by Fred and Judy Vermorel 
(1980?), not so good.  Hard to find. 
        Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography (1980) by Paul Kerton, 
positive but error-prone book.  Hard to find.  Was also available in 
German.

        After being on love-hounds for a few months, most fans find the 
fanzines rarely have information they have not already heard.  The most 
common fanzines are the Kate Bush Club (KBC) and Homeground.   The KBC 
unfortunately only seems to come now when there is a new album out, but 
is always worth the wait as it has original articles by Kate and her 
family and lots of great photos.  KBC,  PO Box 120,  Welling Kent,  
DA16 3DS,  UK 
        Homeground comes out almost regularly and has news, great 
articles, stories, and drawings.   Homeground, PO Box 176, Orpington, 
Kent, BR5 3NA UK 
        Never For Ever is another long-establish fanzine.  28 Millbrook 
St, Plasmarl, Swansea  SA6 8JY Wales

        Kate's session work for other artists include:_You_ for Roy 
Harper, _Sing, _Children,_Sing_ for Leslie Duncan (Kate is scarcely 
identifiable), _Flowers_ for Zaine Griff, 
_The_Man_With_the_Child_in_His_Eyes_ for Ray Shell, _The_Seer_ for Big 
Country, _The_King_is_Dead_ for Go West, _Sister_and_Brother_ for Midge 
Ure, _Do_Bears_Sh..._in_the_Woods?_ with Rowan Atkinson (from 
_The_Utterly_Utterly_Live_Comic_Relief_ album) , and _No_Self_Control_, 
_Games_Without_Frontiers_ and _Don't_Give_Up_ for Peter Gabriel; plus 
her performance of the Maurice Jarre/Paul Webster song _The_Magician_, 
which is only barely audible in the background of the Alan Arkin movie, 
_The_Magician_of_Lublin_.   Also, the title track for the movie 
_Brazil_, which was recently finally released on the soundtrack album 
to the movie. Also, _The_Spirit_Of_The_Forest_ benefit single and the 
title track for Roy Harper's _Once_.
