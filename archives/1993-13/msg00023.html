&gt;}What's so attractive about brooding about the past?  That's all
&gt;}Tori seems able to do. 

This is a teensy bit judgmental.  I think most open-minded people would
agree that writing about past experiences and inventing fictional situations
are equally valid forms of art and/or literature.  Both Kate and Tori create
highly imaginative art, regardless of basis.  BTW, was Tori dead in the
past?  If not, I doubt "Happy Phantom" is entirely autobiographical....

&gt;I can't claim to know the reasons why Kate doesn't sing about
&gt;herself in a direct, personal manner.  My own theory is that she
&gt;has lived a very sheltered, cushy life, growing up in a
&gt;reasonably well-off doctor's home in a family of artists, so if
&gt;she sang about her own experiences they'd probably be pretty
&gt;boring.  Instead she brilliantly takes things she sees in the

That's why MY writing tends not to be very autobiographical.  I simply don't
have much interesting history to write about.


&gt;}No, Robyn Hitchcock is a self-admitted Syd Barrett wannabe.  
&gt; 
&gt;Really?  woj, is that right?  (He runs the Robyn mailing list and
&gt;is one of his hugest fans, Jason, so I'm sure he can confirm or
&gt;deny this for sure...)

Two things: first, Robyn Hitchcock is a brilliant artist in his own right. 
I missed the first part of this discussion, but if the purpose of the above
statement is to belittle Hitchcock as derivative, I'm afraid you've got a
flamewar on your hands.  Robyn Hitchcock is an INCREDIBLE songwriter and an
excellent guitarist (and not the WORST singer in the world), and no artist
works in a vacuum; they've all got influences.

Second, how do I get on this mailing list?  RH is my favorite male artist,
and I'm a RABID fan waiting to discuss the new CD, Respect.

&gt; 
&gt;}It is quite obvious that Kate greatly influenced Tori Amos.  If
&gt;}you can't see that, there's no point in trying to explain it to
&gt;}you.
&gt; 

Not only is this irrelevant to...well, anything, really, it's also sort of
authoritarian.  Sounds like the kind of arrogant, elitist, rude, numbskulled
remark I might have made on soc.motss prior to this week and my
"reformation"....


&gt;}I have no problem with Tori stealing some ideas from Kate's
&gt;}early years.  
&gt; 
&gt;What?  If you are implying that Tori "stole" her themes of sexual
&gt;oppression and religious guilt from  _The Kick Inside_, then
&gt;you'd best get your medication adjusted.

I'll second that.

&gt;As for originality, please send me a list of all the artists
&gt;she's exactly like- I'd love to hear them sometime.

I'll second THAT as well.


&gt;Comparing Tori Amos to Kate Bush is like comparing apples and
&gt;oranges.  As woj said, they are both females who sing in the
&gt;upper registers and play and compose on the piano, but the
&gt;similarity ends there.  End of story.

Meredith, you've said it all for me, and quite eloquently as well.

My work here is finished before it's begun!
