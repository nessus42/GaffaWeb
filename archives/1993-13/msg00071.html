&gt; Lazlo Nibble presumes, presumptuously:
&gt; No they're not.  They are completely *im*plausible.  They are an
&gt; abstraction, based upon your own individual reaction to music, that
&gt; you've blown up into an utterly-unsupportable-outside-of-your-own-personal-
&gt; experience series of assumptions and suppositions which you're attempting
&gt; to map onto the rest of the world.

Oh, thanks for clarifying that.  Forgive my momentary insanity.  ;^)

(Notice, all, the assumption that detailed arguments are irrelevant, and 
truth or falsehood are *known* by the elite and cannot be challenged.)

&gt; As opposed to the egotism that presumes that your personal experiences and
&gt; perceptions are necessarily universal and that we're just disparaging you
&gt; because we're bullheaded "scientismists" who refuse to see Pure Cosmic
&gt; Truth As You Understand It?  Sheesh.

Oh, I remember now: "I am a Fluke of the Universe, my experiences are 
meaningless next to the pronouncements of the last few generations of PhD-
egos, I don't deserve any respect for anything I might say, but should be 
immediately bashed into silence for the good of all.  Ah, men..."  Was *that* 
the mantra the great Maharishi assigned?

&gt; Because Known Science hasn't been able to reliably reproduce any evidence
&gt; of so-called "subtle perception" that isn't sufficiently explained by
&gt; trickery or coincidence.  And there are plenty of people looking. 

Huhm, locked mind^H^H^H^Hdoor.  Oh well...

(Alan Watts had a fine title for one of his books: On the Taboo Against 
Knowing Who You Are.  Notice, all, how these self-appointed enforcers are all 
roused to venomous defense of their denial-systems, and show *no* sign of 
giving the tiniest thought to my arguments, or even reading them 
carefully...)

&gt; (What
&gt; you think this has to do with Americans, per se, escapes me.  In my
&gt; experience Americans are no more or less likely to fall for this sort of
&gt; silliness than anyone else.)

Americans are who I know.


Kate content?  Absolutely!  Her whole career and philosophy is about waking 
up to other dimensions.  Her own attunement beyond the narrow window of 
consensus reality is where her genius finds its roots.  And the rampant 
Denialism in the world is more than likely the major villain behind her 
recent timidity about publishing.

I can't think of a likelier group than the 'Hounds to appreciate what I'm 
saying.  I'm not inclined in the least to let myself be backed down by a 
handful of tyrannical boors.

You t.b.s are a blight on human reason, and your fury is sheer territorial 
ego, pompously imagining that you have a right to decide what experiences are 
granted respect, and which are drenched with contempt.  Well, piss on you 
back!  This is an *arts* forum, your preconceptions carry no weight here, 
please shove your scientism up your bloody butts.  I assert my freedom and my 
rights!

Yours in love and anger, j
