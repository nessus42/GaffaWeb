Not that anybody really needs reminding, but here's the record:

1- Carmilla [afterlife]
 
Last night you were on my balcony...

Well, it makes me long for the good times,
 When you were really alive.
 
2- Hot in the Ice [ESP]
 
Is it you I'm feeling?
          Is it you I'm feeling?
          Is it you I'm feeling?

3- Nevertheless, You'll Do [astral projection]
 
 You've never driven through a red light,
 Or let your mind leave your body.
 
4- On the Rocks [visionary inspiration]
 
 Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,
 A burning sword.
 I'd like to cry. I look into her eyes.
 I see she -----------.
 "Ooh," she says,
 "The games are still the same, I see,
  But they've changed the names now.
  Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart?"
 
     Lionhearts in the asylums,
     Lionhearts tossed at sea,
     Lionhearts who've lived their lives, like Arthur.
     Lionhearts in cathedrals,
     Lionhearts at mournings,
     Lionhearts in every seed--
          But they're sown
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks,
          On the rocks...
 
 Somebody I couldn't see
 Tied me up and put me away,
 Here on the rocks,
 Here on the rocks,
 Here on the rocks...

5- December Will Be Magic Again [ESP]

 December will be magic again.
 Light the candle-lights
 To conjure Mr. Wilde
 Into the Silent Night.
 Ooh, it's quiet inside,
 Here in Oscar's mind.

6- Strange Phenomena [you name it!]
 
 Soon it will be the phase of the moon
 When people tune in.
 Every girl knows about the punctual blues,
 But who's to know the power behind our moves?
 
      A day of coincidence with the radio,
      And a word that won't go away.
      We know what they're all going to say.
      "G" arrives--"Funny, had a feeling he was on his way!"
 
 You pick up a paper. You read a name.
 You go out. It turns up again and again.
 You bump into a friend you haven't seen for a long time,
 Then into another you only thought about last night.
 
      You hear your sister calling for you,
      But you don't know where from.
      You know there's something wrong,
      But you don't want to believe in a premonition.
 
           We raise our hats to the strange phenomena.
           Soul-birds of a feather flock together.
           We raise our hats to the hand a-moulding us.
           Sure 'nuff, he has the answer,
           He has the answer
           He has the answer, be-duh-be-duh-be-duh-be-duh...
           "Om mani padme,
            Om mani padme,
            Om mani padme hum."

7- Wuthering Heights [afterlife]
 
 Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,
 On the other side from you.

8- Feel It [ESP]
 
 Keep on a-moving in.
 So keep on a-tuning in.
 Synchronise rhythm now.

9- Them Heavy People [spiritual practice]

 They arrived at an inconvenient time.
 I was hiding in a room in my mind.
 They made me look at myself. I saw it well.
 I'd shut the people out of my life.
 
 So now I take the opportunities:
 Wonderful teachers ready to teach me.
 I must work on my mind. For now I realise:
 Everyone of us has a heaven inside.
 
 They open doorways that I thought were shut for good.
 They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu.
 They build up my body, break me emotionally.
 It's nearly killing me, but what a lovely feeling!
 
 I love the whirling of the dervishes.
 I love the beauty of rare innocence.
 You don't need no crystal ball,
 Don't fall for a magic wand.
 We humans got it all, we perform the miracles.
 
10- Symphony in Blue [???]
 
 When that feeling of meaninglessness sets in,
 Go blowing my mind on God:
 The light in the dark, with the neon arms,
 The meek He seeks, the beast He calms,
 The head of the good soul department.
 
11- In Search of Peter Pan [romanticism]
 
      They took the game right out of it.
      They took the game right out of it.
 
      When I am a man
      I will be an astronaut,
      And find Peter Pan.
 
      Second star on the right,
      Straight on 'til morning.
      Second star on the right,
      Straight on 'til morning.

12- Full House [spiritual practice]
 
           (You've really got to)
           Remember yourself.
           You've got a Full House in your head tonight
           (You've got to, you've got to)
           Remember yourself.
           Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight.
 
 My silly pride
 Digging the knife in.
 She loves to come for her ride.
 Surely by now I should know
 I can control
 My highs and my lows
 
 By questioning all that I do,
 Examining every move,
 Trying to get back to the rudiments.

13- Hammer Horror [afterlife]
 
 Who calls me from the other side
 Of the street?
 And who taps me on the shoulder?
 I turn around, but you're gone.
 
 I've got a hunch that you're following,
 To get your own back on me.
 So all I want to do is forget
 You, friend.
 
14- Blow Away [afterlife]

 One of the band told me last night
 That music is all that he's got in his life.
 But where will it go?
 Surely not with his soul.
 Will all of his licks and his R'n'B
 
      Blow away?
      Blow away
      Blow away
 
 Our engineer had a different idea
 From people who nearly died but survived,
 Feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here,
 And went to a room that was soon full of visitors.
 
 Put out the light, then, put out the light.
 Vibes in the sky invite you to dine.
 Dust to dust,
 Blow to blow.
 Bolan and Moony are heading the show tonight.
 
      Hello Minnie, Moony, (Bill), Vicious, Vicious, Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny.
      Please don't thump me,
      Don't bump me,
      Don't dump me back there.
      Please don't thump me,
      Don't bump me,
      Don't dump me back there.
      Please don't thump me,
      Don't bump me,
      I want to stay here. 

15- Breathing [ESP]

 My radar send me danger
 But my instincts tell me to keep
      Breathing,

16- Sat In Your Lap [spiritual practice]
 
 Some grey and white matter,
      "Give me the karma, mama!"
 I'm coming up the ladder,
      "A jet to Mecca,"
 I'm coming up the ladder,
      "Tibet or Jeddah,
 Up the ladder...
      "To Salisbury,
       A monastery,
       The longest journey,
       Across the desert,
       Across the weather,
       Across the elements,
       Across the water!"

17- Suspended in Gaffa [visionary inspiration]

        "I caught a glimpse of a god, all shining and bright."
 
        "We all have a dream...maybe."
 
        "Mother, where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes."

18- Leave It Open [psychic vulnerability]
 
 My door was never locked,
 Until one day a trigger come cocking.
      (But now I've started learning how,)
 I keep it shut.
 
      Harm is in us.
      Harm is in us, but power to arm.
 
 Narrow mind would persecute it,
 Die a little to get to it.
      (But now I've started learning how.)
 I leave it open.

19- The Dreaming [other dimensions]

      "Dree-ee-ee-ee-ee-
       A-a-a-a-a-
       M-m-m-m-m-
       Ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-
       I-i-i-i-i-
       Me-me-me-me-me,"
 
20- Houdini [afterlife]
 
           "Rosabel, believe!"
 
 You
 And I
 And Rosabel believe.

21- Get Out of My House [vibes]
 
They come with their weather hanging 'round them,

22- Cloudbusting [fringe science]
 
 I still dream of Orgonon.
 I wake up crying.
 You're makin' rain...
 
      But every time it rains,
      You're here in my head,
      Like the sun coming out--
      Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.
      And I don't know when,
      But just saying it could even make it happen.
 
23- Watching You Without Me [astral projection]
 
      You can't hear me.
      You can't hear me.
      You can't hear me
      Here in the room with you now.
      You can't hear what I'm saying.
      You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?
 
 Can't let you know
 What's been happening.
 There's a ghost in our home,
 Just watching you without me.
 I'm not here.

 "Don't ignore, don't ignore me,
Let me in and don't be long."

24- Hello Earth [astral projection]
 
 Watching storms
 Start to form
 Over America.
 Can't do anything.
 Just watch them swing
 With the wind
 Out to sea.
 
25- The Fog [ESP]

 Just like a station on the radio I pick you up

 Just like a feeling that you're sending out, I pick it up...
