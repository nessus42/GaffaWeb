RE: Sound Filter software

&gt;As an aside, you can use this technique to analyse say, the frequency
&gt;spectrum of the piano part, and then remove that from the track -
&gt;fun, but ultimately not very useful!  It is also _very_ slow on my
&gt;machine, taking over 1 hour real time for 1 minute of recorded signal.

Actually Craig, I can think of fourthosandmillon ultimate uses for this program 
in relation to Kate's work!  First off to isolate many of her mysterious BVs 
that we cannot yet decipher because of competing instruments or voices going at 
the same time.  

Is the slowness a ram or processor limitation?  Can you get access to a higher 
power machine and see if the thing runs faster?

I am changing over to Mac platform, so wonder if anyone knows of a similar 
program for Macs?  

Does anyone remember "The Conversation" with Gene Hackman?  I've wanted to do 
that same kind of processing to certain of Kate's songs for years.

RE: CATHY Demos

While internal distribution of the demos in Love Hounds would drop the 
bootleggers out of the picture, I have to wonder if we wouldn't be doing Kate a 
grave disservice.  It is one thing for us to share videos available over the 
airwaves that she meant us to see, but quite another to redistribute these 
recordings that Kate has made clear she did not want circulated.

I am ambivalent on this, as I would dearly love to hear and have at my disposal 
a copy of her before-Prince "Why Should I Love You", or the legendary and 
mysterious "Early Years" album, the many songs that didn't make it onto The 
Dreaming (20 songs?), the 200 other songs she wrote in her youth.

Andy is quite right that EMI and Kate should put their heads together and issue 
a recording of these things.  It could be combined with that picture book we 
never got about "Catherine", since she was writing most of those early songs 
during the period of time that middle book was to be about.  

BUT, WE'RE GETTING A NEW SONG!  (imagine a series of Bulgarian style yips)
