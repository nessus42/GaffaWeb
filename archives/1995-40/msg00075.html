<PRE>
To follow on Uli's very thoughtful discussion of the varying quality of the
various versions of the Cathy demos:

I would be willing to bet that at least SOME of these versions are the best
that you are going to get. Speaking as someone of the same age group as Kate,
who was dickering around with various home recording techniques (although no
one is ever going to clamour for the release of my demos!), the technology and
quality that was available then was light years worse (and more expensive) than
what is available today.

These demos (I 've heard the vinyl 2-record set) sound very much to me like the
quality of what a lot of people, without access to professional (expensive)
recording studios, would make as submissions to record cos. for possible
signings. So...it could be that what EMI has, or what they received from Kate
originally, is exactly what you hear on the Cathy demos. I don't know much
about transferring tape to CDs and remastering, but I honestly wonder how much
of this could be "cleaned up" if the original version is such low quality.

I seem to recall, however, that David Gilmour paid for Kate to make a
"professional" tape, and some of that ended up on The Kick Inside. Are there
any songs from that that haven't been released? 

Cheers, Fiona
