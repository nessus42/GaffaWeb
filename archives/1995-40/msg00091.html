Fiona says the Cathy demos might never sound any better,
but the issue is whether a good copy can be made from 
the best available source (the five "Cathy's Demos" 
seven-inch EPs), rather than the noticeably worse-sounding
sources that were used for all the currently available CD
editions.  Certainly, though, Fiona, your point is well
taken -- these recordings will never sound exactly 
"professional", though the performances are peerless.
Many fans, however, have not heard the sound of the EPs, 
and would be surprised to hear how good they sound compared
to all the other editions.

As for the "professional" demo arranged for by Dave Gilmour:
this is tricky, because there were two "sessions" connected
with Gilmour. The first resulted in several home recordings
featuring a live band of some of Gilmour's friends, of which
the track "Passing Through Air" is one. The second resulted
in three more elaborately arranged and carefully recorded 
tracks, of which the LP cuts "Saxophone Song" and "The Man
With the Child In His Eyes" are two.  The third track from 
that session was a version of the song "Maybe" (or "Humming"), 
of which part of an *earlier* recording was played once on 
the BBC Radio programme "Personal Call" in 1978 or '79. The 
later, more polished version of that song has never been released.

Anyway, this is the way IED has interpreted the bits and pieces
of vague information he has picked up over the years regarding 
the demos.
