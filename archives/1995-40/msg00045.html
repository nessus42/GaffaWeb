I thought this was a good time to re-advertise the names as read by
the DJ of the Phoenix demo tape broadcast apparently off a "real"
cassette (I believe). So skipping all the obvious later production
released ones and ones where the title matches, we have:

Phoenix broadcast		Bootleg Demos		Often referred to as

It Hurts Me			A Rose Growing Old	Feeling Like a Waltz
Stranded at the Moonbase	Keeping Me Waiting	Keeping Me Waiting
Surrender into the Roses	Coming Up		Camilla
Rinfi the Gypsy			Playing Canasta in Cold Rooms
On Fire Inside a Snowball	Snow			Hot in the Ice
Where Are the Lionhearts	Lionhearts		On the Rocks
The Gay Farewell		Eddie the Queen		Eddie the Queen
Something Like a Song		In My Garden		Something Like a Song
Come Closer to Me Babe		Goodnight Baby		Who is Sylvia?
So Soft				You're Soft		You're Soft
Rare Flower		Don't See Why I Shouldn't	Pick the Rare Flower
While Davy Dozed		Davy				Davy
Dali				?				?
?				Ferry me over		Ferry me over

It seems that the words of "Ferry me over" has:
	High,
	Can't see you.
	You've seen your "Dali"			or is that "Darling"
	Alone and higher still
of course the DJ may have said "Darling".

I personally use the Phoenix broadcast name, since he was reading
from the cassette box, perhaps Kates own hand writing!

Hope the above helps you write your own CD insert sheet.
I have my own for my "Home Demos" CD, I also included some images from
the Cathy book, besides the lyrics, matching appropriate images with
songs, where I could. Unfortunately, 8 sheets of paper folded over
becomes fairly thick and only just squeezes in the CD slot. I also
have yet to find a stapler that can reach the 4 inches to staple
nicely the spine. It's all only black and white too. Quite nice though
according to my friend.

I agree with your liking "Something Like a Song", it IS up there in
my mind with "Under the Ivy", "Moments of Pleasure", "Infant Kiss",
and "The Kick Inside". "While Davy Dozed" is similarly excellent.
I've also amused about the "tiny fish" too! I guess this relates
to another good phrase "every girl knows about punctual blues",
I've always assumed this to be "non-punctual" worries, but perhaps
it is just referring to PMS, which seems more reasonable.
I also love how she says "Give me one second to succumb" in "Rare Flower".
I prefer "Lizzy Wan's story" to "that old mythology". Neither really to
me particularly in the beat to that line, but in thinking what could
have gone there, I have no idea what would have fitted.

On my CD in the 2nd Babooska (with the beat machine), what does she say
in the last verse? I have:
	And when he laid eyes on her,
	He got the feeling that he knew her well.
	Uncanny how she
	Can take him back onto a piece of mars.
	And saying things that make him want to laugh.
	Just like his wife before she freezed on him,
	Just like his wife when she was beautiful.
the problem line is the Mars line!
It doesn't seem to make sense or fit in, anyone have better ears that me?
