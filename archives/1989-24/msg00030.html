In article &lt;4031@blake.acs.washington.edu&gt; you write:
&gt;Really-From: donley@blake.acs.washington.edu (Erik Olson)
&gt;
&gt;OK, here's a poser:  What does the "secret message" mean on the end of
&gt;"Are we dancing now?" -- you can hear by turning up the volume real high at
&gt;the end of the song, footsteps and then Jane's voice saying "Wolfgang?"
&gt;
&gt;   - Eo

Wolfgang is Jane's dog (as in "Everything Reminds Me Of My Dog").  I believe
he is an Irish wolf hound.  He is listed in the thank you notes on BBtB
and possibly others.  He also appears in the song "Above The Tree Line"
from Jane's first album _Jane_Siberry_ (1981?).  I think the "secret message"
is Jane asking Wolf if he'd like to go for a walk ("git along little doggie" :-)

Speaking of Jane's first album, I believe someone was asking about it a few
days ago.  I bought this album in Toronto shortly after I bought (and fell in
love with) _No_Borders_Here_.  Jane paid for the recording of this album by
working as a waitress (hence "Waitress" on NBH).  It was recorded in the
basement of her parents house in suburban Toronto  (Their neighbours told me
this when I happened to sit next to them at Jane's TSS concert in Toronto).
The album itself is much more folkie than her later efforts but it's just as
quirky and therefore is endearing nonetheless.  As far as the availability
of this album goes, I think I still see it occassionally in the bins in
record stores in Toronto but I doubt we'd see a re-release of it.  Jane didn't
even perform anything from it on the TSS tour.

Also, someone (I think Gary Dare) posted in rec.music.misc that Jane studied
that the Ontario College of Art.  While that may be (I hadn't heard it before)
she also has a B.Sc. in Microbiology from the University Of Guelph.  Hence the
scientific references in her lyrics ("flying through the air like crazy atoms",
"like atoms in a model" and "it takes forever if you go by inertia").

All I said is, "Why are you so fat?
If you don't want to be and all that.
No big deal,
I just want to know."
	Jane Siberry "This Girl I Know" from _Jane_Siberry_
