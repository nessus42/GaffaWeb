&gt;Really-From: JONES%RPIECS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu
&gt;                     The absolutely GLORIOUS laugh between _Love and
&gt;                        Anger_ and _The Fog_

Having the CD finally answered the question that's been bugging me
ever since hearing the album: namely, does the laugh belong to the
end of "Love and Anger" or the beginning of "The Fog"?  The answer is,
it's the beginning of "The Fog."  And what a fantastic song that is.
It broods and brews and bubbles and brims with ominous intensity.

&gt;                     The POWER of the vocals in _Reaching Out_

Oh, but what a waste of good lungwork.

&gt;                     The funky little rhythms at the beginning of
&gt;                        _Heads We're Dancing_

I am firmly convinced that the percussive hits are supposed to represent
the dance that Kate and Hitler were doing.  The little reversed whooshing
hit sounds like the turnaround at the end of a tango.  Anybody else think
so?

&gt;                     _Deeper Understanding_

WHY are there bird sound effects at the end of this song?  Did the
protagonist suddenly get out into the real world?  I really wish there
wasn't a happy ending.

&gt;  To perfectly honest, I just about cringed the first time I listened to
&gt;_Rocket's Tail_.  There was just something about it that I hated.  But
&gt;never fear, you Hounds out there.

This is what makes love-hounds so interesting.  The first time I heard it
I had to stop the tape and take deep breaths.  It was a (to quote
S'Express) SCREAMING ORGASM of sound!  Completely brilliant.

&gt;This album is pretty different
&gt;from _Hounds_, but that certainly doesn't make it WORSE.

The thing that makes Hounds and Dreaming better albums for ME PERSONALLY
is the amazing amounts of contrapuntal rhythms and melody lines.  |&gt;oug
Alan summed it up best to me by saying: "On _TD_ and _HoL_ you had
thousands of things all working against each other.  On this album, you
have thousands of things all pushing together."  I guess I just like
conflict.

&gt;P.S.  Someone commented earlier on the "lameness" of the front picture.  I
&gt;      really disagree.  The lack of color forces you to search elsewhere
&gt;      in the photo.  You can't look away from those eyes, but if you do,
&gt;      you see and can almost imagine the velvety feel of those rose petals,
&gt;      can see the creamy slice of bare shoulder.  It's a very seductive
&gt;      picture; what could better convey the idea of sensuality/sexuality?

That was me.  The problem is that the jewel booklet is really badly
printed.  The cover photo is passable, but the inside printing sucks
the grand wazoo.  Also, the photo really needs to be seen larger to
have any impact.  I cut up the cardboard box that came with it, but
to make it not look stretched, they cropped it so "the creamy slice
of bare shoulder" is missing.  I still like the single cover better.
It has more resonance.
