Jeffrey C. Burka responded when Fiona asked:

&gt;&gt;At the risk of fanning the flames even further, I'd like to have 
something
&gt;&gt;clarified. Intergalactic Garage sells copies of a videotape that Kate 
Bush's
&gt;&gt;brother has specifically asked not be circulated. Vickie sends out 
tapes
&gt;&gt;of music by female artists which presumably are covered by copyright,
&gt;&gt;royalty agreements for reproductions, etc. Why is one OK and the other 
not?

&gt;&gt;a)  Vickie gives them away, IG sells them.  While neither is legal, I'd 
still
&gt;&gt;have to say that one is more ethical than the other (and you can guess 
which)_
(material deleted)
 &gt;&gt;The end result is that IG sells items that will not encourage people 
to buy other &gt;&gt;items.

&gt;&gt;Vickie givesaway tapes that encourage people to run out and buy things, 
thereby &gt;&gt;supporting
&gt;&gt;the artists she's conceivably 'ripped off' through the act of copying. 
 
&gt;&gt;Once again, both are illegal (material deleted).

OK.  Enough said.

While I'm working on my rebuttal to Vickie and my TORT of response to IED 
 :- ) , I thought it paramount to step on this thread immediately!!!!

INTERGALACTIC (IGG) does not sell bootlegs! (This in itself will cost me 
lots of business :-)  Given, a few items have crossed the pages of  the 
INTERGALACTIC GAZETTE over the years, but as a rule they were pieces of 
merit that surfaced in collections purchased. (And be forewarned: Maura 
does have agood memory  for those who would point a condeming finger and 
have also called looking for certain forbotten titles!!!)

Furthermore - although 'someone' was selling the John Riemer tape, it was 
NEVER  IGG. In addition, inspite of the implications in Vickie's post, 
IGG DOES NOT sell reproduced tapes. If you have ever seen such a listing 
in an IGG catalog, please correct me.

Furthermore, IGG was formed and exists to promote Kate Bush, the artist 
and singer/songwriter. We do not carry items that do not promote her 
career, artistically or commercially.

A recent bootleg surfaced that contained B-sides of Kate material. Some 
ot this material was available on Kate still has in print. Some of the 
material was drawn from CHARITY PIECES that Kate had contributed to.  
Worse yet, the piece was released on several colors of vinyl. COLLECT 
THEM ALL! IGG never did carry this shoddy shoddy piece of work and never 
will.

I agree that there are items out there that do Kate's career harm.

But please, don't ever accuse IGG of knowingly selling such items.
..
Other mis-perceptions about the goals and methods of IGG I will correct 
in subsequent postings in the near future :- )

Meanwhile - It's a beautiful day outside! Get away from that CRT and have 
some of it!!

PS Loreena's 4 CDs are now in in good stock: Elemental; To Drive the Cold 
Winter; Parallel; and the original Canadian version of the Visit!
