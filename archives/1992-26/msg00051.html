The following is a review of THE ILLUSTRATED COLLECTOR'S GUIDE TO KATE
BUSH that appears in the Oct. 2, 1992 issue of GOLDMINE. I thought
it might be of interest to some people on the list. The review
is by Gillian G. Gaar.

____________________

        Given Kae Bush's populatrity, it's surprising that it has taken so
long for a book like THE ILLUSTRATED COLLECTOR'S GUIDE TO KATE BUSH
to be published. Happily, this oversight has been remedied, and this
book should be invaluable to all Kate Bush collectors, no matter what
size your collection.
        The first half of the book primarily covers the basics: Bush's
albums, singles, CDs, and laser discs. Listings are given in a
straightforward manner, with the original UK release date given for
each album and CD (the only sections in the book where this is done),
along with catalog numbers for each country's release of an item, and
track listings for CDs and singles. Each entry is accompanied by at
least one photo, several in the case of variations (particularly common
among the singles). Godwin also offers useful information on how to
distinguish original items from reissues.
        The second half is what will probably make most serious collector's
mouths water as they peruse the wealth of Bush-related promo items,
interview discs, and bootlegs (rated as to sound quality) that are
availiable. Leaving no stone unturned, Godwin also has sections listing
videos, print items, and a comprehendsive listing of Bush's TV appearences
and the various guest appearances she has made on other artists' releases.
        The guide is so thorough, the few quibbles relate to the book's
layout and presentation. Since the book is too short to merit an index,
it would have been nice to have had headings listing the section and
year at the top of each page for quick reference. Another proofreading
eye might also have caught the number of typos/spelling/punctuation/spacing
errors that run through the book (and even on the back cover). The book
itself could have been assembled with more care; my copy's spine is
already coming apart. And a few more explanatory notes would also have
been useful; Godwin writes that THIS WOMAN'S WORK boxed set has been
"often criticized" but doesn't say why (the price? the quality of the
vinyl? the fact that it wasn't issued in the U.S.? all - or none - of the
above?), and doesn't quite clear up the status of the initial U.S. release
of LIONHEART (was it initially limited and then withdrawn? in a single
pocket or gatefold sleeve?).
        Godwin readily acknowledges the obsessive eye of Bush fans and
invites them to write in with any omissions they see (this collector
has two, although nothing especially exotic: the U.S. "Experiment IV"
12-inch and 7-inch singles), which presumably means we can look forward
to an update. Until that time, the first edition of THE COLLECTOR'S GUIDE
TO KATE BUSH is a must have for the Kate Bush collector.

Yeah, I second the good review. It's a really nice book. With all of those
boxes coming out, and hopefully a new album out soon, an update might
not be too far off. :)
