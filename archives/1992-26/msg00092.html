        On Saturday, September 11, I went to the San Diego STREET 
SCENE, which is basicly where they rope off a couple of square blocks 
downtowna and have about 10 stages going all the time, with a total of 
like 50 bands a night!  I managed to see little bits of about 10 bands. 

        One of the first was a band from called OUTBACK, which featured 
a real live Didgeridoo player, the first one I'd ever seen.  People 
seemed real interested in the instrument, I was like "the expert", 
despite the fact I'd never even seen one!  I saw the guy who played it 
later taking to a woman, and said "nice Digeridoo'in", but 
unfortunately he was more interested in the woman.  

        I then saw Tom Scott. a sax player who's played with just about 
everybody, and used to be band leader for Pat Sajak :-).  He was cool 
anyway.  I then saw a little of the Dirty Dozen Brass band (cool), 
zoomed past the Gospel Tent, saw The Tom Tom Club (too crowded, and no 
too interesting, to me), and saw Tom Mayall and the Blues brakers.  
        
        I then saw Sophie B. Hawkins, which I believe a lot of people 
here like.  It was a very trippy, sexual experience.  Half of the 
audience seemed to be acting like she was a God or something (like we 
would act around Kate perhaps :-).  She was incredibly wild on stage, 
at one point one of the guitarists rubbed his guitar on the inside of 
her leg, and then brought it up, and she grabbed it, and, well, this is 
a "family" newsgroup so I won't go on.  There was the woman who looked 
kinda like a Mexican Geena Davis (ALERT: GEENA DAVIS'S NEW MOVIE 
OCTOBER 2) standing behind me worshiping, and at one point I felt these 
hands rubbing my shoulders, and then going down my back.  I was 
thinking something like, "Hm, I didn't know these things happened at 
concerts.  :-)  After about a minute, I figured I better see who she 
was.  I turned around and it was some drunk gay guy.  "I know you, I've 
seen you at ...", he breathed into my face.  (I think he was trying to 
say "Price Club").  After making me sick with his breath several times, 
he finally stomped off.  

        What was amazing about the whole Street Scene was the fact that 
with all the different bands and groups of people, everyone got along 
and was friendly and there wasn't any problems.

        Next week it's NEIL YOUNG (ACCOUSTIC) and then the week after 
BRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEE, anyone wanna see 
Bruce with me, as I may have an extra ticket.
