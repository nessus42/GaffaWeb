I finally got my UK copies of MOP and TRS1 &amp; 2 after procurring them for
a lot less than the $30 I would have paid if I had madly dashed out to get
them the day my local stores got them.   And I must admit I'm glad I paid
less than half price for them.  

Albeit based on just one listening I am severely underwhelmed.  SaLD is 
so different in many ways from the album.  It lacks Kate's signature.
I wonder if this track was not worked on like the album material and thus
is still not fully developed.  The vocal tune remind me of some of her other
songs and the instrumentation is so blah.      

I can't comment too much on YWA but the scream invokes the idea of someone
tightening their hands around Kate's throat.  Is that really her voice or
is it badly recorded?  

It is disappointing to get some already available tracks when there are still
some that haven't seen the light of CD (Man with the Child in his Eyes single
version, Dreamtime, MOP instrumental etc).  I like the Video Mix of 
Cloudbusting a lot.  Glad to have it.  Where does that version of The Big Sky
come from - it's not the LP version?  

I realise some of these things have probably been asked or answered before.
Please forgive me if so, I don't have too many chances anymore to cruise 
the Internet and threads roll of the end into obscurtiy fairly rapidly.  

BTW after last years tragedy my wife and I have been blessed with a second 
son, Trevyn, born 30 March.  He's one reason why my time on the Internet
is reduced :-)   He'll never replace Jory who died from brain cancer
last year, soon after the release of TRS, but he has helped distract us from 
our sorrow.
