SARAH McLACHLAN SUMMER 1994 NEWSLETTER


After spending the last 3 and 1/2 months out on the road touring, Sarah
finally had a chance to get reacquainted with her own bed during the month
of June.

The second leg of the Fumbling... tour proved to be a great success.  The
show was reworked, with the most notable changes being to the lighting
(which garnered its own rave reviews) and the addition of "Ice", "Ice
Cream", and "Fear" to the set.

The focus for the past tour was primarily the U.S. where she played smaller
venues (average size:  1200 seats).  In customary Sarah-fashion, the shows
sold out quickly and were met with enthusiastic responses.

The tour wasn't all touring, however.  Sarah and her band filmed a video
for Pay Per View in Montreal and Morin Heights at Studio Nomade.  It
features live footage of the Montreal concert, a "behind the scenes"
interview with both Sarah and Pierre Marchand, and footage of an
"unplugged" session in the studio. It was broadcast in Canada on April
29th.  The entire broadcast will be released on video by Nettwerk in the
fall, and the "unplugged" session will also eventually be released as an
EP.

Although Sarah had a chance to relax during her break in touring, she also
filmed a video for "Good Enough".  It will be released with the single in
July. The single will feature the album mix, a re-mix, an "unplugged"
version and a cover of Joni Mitchell's "Blue".

For those of you who are anxiously awaiting a Sarah video compilation and a
songbook, we have good news for you!  Sarah's been at work compiling both
of these.  The songbook will contain all the songs from Fumbling..., "Vox",
and "Ben's Song" from Touch, and "Lost", "Path of Thorns (Terms)", "I Will
Not Forget You", and "Drawn to the Rhythm" from Solace.  Look for it in all
North American music stores by the end of August.  We are compiling a video
compilation which will include all of Sarah's videos (Canadian &amp; U.S.
versions) as well as behind-the-scenes and live footage, interviews and
other such things.  It will be released in the fall.

After Sarah finishes her North American tour in September, she will be
heading to Europe where Fumbling... will just be newly released.  That tour
will finish by Christmas and allow Sarah another chance to revitalize
before she heads off to tour Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.  Whew!
HowUs that for a busy schedule?!

Did you know that Sarah is the subject of her own Internet list or that you
can obtain graphics and sound files and other information about her
electronically? For more information, you can contact us at
nettwerk@mindlink.bc.ca or nettwerk@aol.com.
