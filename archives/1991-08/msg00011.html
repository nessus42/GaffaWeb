<PRE>
First I will dispense with formalities:
The new Happy Rhodes CD will very soon be available for order
from Aural Gratification.  The cost is $13.99 + $2 P&amp;H.
If you would like to reserve a copy, you are instructed to mail
your order to Albany and as soon as they're ready, they'll send you one.
Vickie informs me that the production has gone off without a hitch and
so the ETA of April 1 looks like it will be made good.  Happy Rhoding!

Now, as I further take on the persona of Vickie Mapes (much as Andy
takes on that of iED), it is at Concierge Mapes suggestion that I
present the following, shall we say, concept(?).

Vickie wants me to be convincing with this, but I guess I am not
a full believer in it yet for a variety of historical and personal
reasons.  Nonetheless, it would certainly be interesting if 
Happy Rhodes was Kate's "opening act".  In fact, what Vickie suggests
(she spoke of some guy named Charlie having the original idea) is
to go a step further and actually stage a *MAIL CAMPAIGN* to Kate
to take Happy Rhodes under her sleeve when (\if) she tours.

Vickie lists several reasons that this would work/be a good idea,
among them that Happy is a virtual an unknown; that her music is
commensurate with Katery; that Kate likes helping prospective
greats get their break (returning the favor?); that we would all
like to see Happy; that Kate will likely get to call her own shots
and *could* probably pull it off; and that this would be better than
a foisted opening act that Kate didn't really care about.

Now, the philosophical elements of this proposal I will merely touch
on (and these are my concerns).  First, would Kate even want someone
to open for her?  Has she ever had anyone open for her before (i.e.
10 years ago)?  Second, could Kate truly be convinced that Happy
*should* open for her (does she read her mail :-)?

Well, I believe it could be done, assuming Kate has enough time to
think it through and get fully acquainted with Happy's music.

So Vickie wants us all to write letters to Kate to this effect.
The question is, what do other LH's think about this idea?  Would
you write letters?  Would you like to se Happy open for Kate?
Would you like to see *anyone* open for Kate?  (I'm still mixed
on this myself.)  Do you think there is any chance that Kate would
do something like this?

Let's talk about this before we jump in...

I will  be mailing Happy lyrics to Vickie, who it looks like will
in turn communicate them to Happy.

Boy I sure hope they get that phone back soon!
