This may have been made clear by my reply to Ron but I'll try to give
a bit more detail.

GEnie is an information service much like CompuServe that is offered
by GE. It offers access to non-computer related "Round Tables" or
message bases at a flat rate of $4.95 per month.  That includes access
via a local phone number in most areas.  

&gt; Second, what is the GEnie "Kate Bush discussion group", and
&gt; how big is it? 

There is a music "round table" which contains a rock "category" which
in turn contains the Kate Bush "topic".  All of the messages in a
topic are kept in a sequential file that you can page through.  When
you reply to the topic your message is appended to the end.  Crude but
effective.  We have accumulated something like two or three hundred
messages over the last six months.

&gt; And third and most important, why is someone with
&gt; as much to KonTribute to Love-Hounds as Dawn (L.PAULLIN1) stuck 
&gt; in GEnie instead of being let loose in the rich ether of
&gt; Philocaninia? 

Net access is a strange and wonderful thing.  Most of the users of
GEnie are personal computer users many of whom really have little or
no idea that something like "the net" exists.  Even once informed
of it's existence most have no idea where or how to obtain access 
(assuming it's even available in their area).  For some there
remains a technical barrier even if access is available.  The
operation of typical news reader software is not intuitively obvious
to many PC users (or human beings in general for that matter).

&gt; Can you do nothing to get her out of GEnie (along
&gt; with any other woefully misdirected Kate fans who are stuck there
&gt; with her) and into Love-Hounds--asap? 

I doubt that I can rescue the entire group but I will at least attempt 
check the public access UNIX listing for systems close to the heaviest
contributers.

It's worth noting that I am making Love-Hounds postings available on
my public BBS to anyone who cares to peruse them.  Posting ability may
follow if volume should warrant.  

&gt; Meanwhile, if it's any 
&gt; comfort to her, her posting made two more sales for Samuel M.
&gt; Key/Charles de Lint, and one for Emma Bull. Thank her again for
&gt; IED.

I'll pass the word along.
