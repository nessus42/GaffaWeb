About a year ago Kate was #1 on the College charts.  I had never heard 
of her.  I really had no interest in her.  But, after noticing that
she had her own newsgroup I became real curious.  Right before
I went on spring break, I stopped in Sam Goody and noticed her album
 (TSW) was on sale.  I had never bought anything before without knowing at
least one song on it.  I decided to give it a chance.  I brought
it home with me, and I just did't care for it.  About one month later,
I was studying and I wanted to put some music on.  I thought I'd
give it another chance.  No response.  A couple weeks later I tried again.
This time, I read some of the lyrics as I listened.  Suddenly "Deeper 
Understanding" became very appealing.  I started listening to the one song
many times.  I'd usually give "Between A Man and a Woman" a chance, but
it still didn't do it for me.  Well, I brought the tape home that
summer and by then I was in love with the whole album.  I went to
a store near me and bought Lionheart.  After one listen I decided, I
must have bought the wrong album.  This didn't sound the same as the
Kate Bush on TSW.  Naturally, I didn't like it.  After four listenings
I couldn't stop playing it.  My tape player was on non-stop
Lionheart and TSW.  Then I saw an old article on Kate in Rolling Stone.
They specifically named Lionheart as her worst album.  I was shocked, so
I bought yet another.
     By the end of the summer I owned HoL (The Best) and TKI.  I didn't
want to get too much Kate too fast, for I didn't want to run out of 
material.  I started reading Gaffa when school started again, and
here I saw everyone raving about The Dreaming.  So, I avoided it.
Instead, I bought Never For Ever, which I couldn't really appreciate.
I saw The Whole Story video collection, and Army Dreamers and Breathing
just knocked me out.  Suddenly I discovered the real value in my tape.
I finally gave in and bought The Dreaming, and actually loved it on
my first listening.  I have a strange taste in music, so no one I 
know believes me that Kate is awesome.  Well I guess I'm now a 
big Kate fan, but no where near most of you Big League fans. I
don't know where to find a bootleg, and certainly can't afford
a boxed set.  But one day I shall...

"Oh come on, you've got to use your flow.
 You know what it's like, and you know you want to go.
 Don't drive too slowly, Don't put your blues where your shoes should be.
 Don't push your foot on the heartbrake." -- Kate Bush
