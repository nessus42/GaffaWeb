&gt;&gt;Well, consider the fact that...okay, the opinion (mine) that LE is a much
&gt;&gt;more *perfect* album than anything Kate has ever done.

&gt;As you've surely noticed, this is a minority opinion around here.

Weeeeelllll, not a minority of one, anyway.  Kate's had some lame songs on
every album so far; Tori's produced an album with no lame songs. And I know
that some people here do agree with me on that.

&gt;&gt;Yes, perhaps she
&gt;&gt;wrote herself out on this album.  So what?  Quality, *not* quantity, is what
&gt;&gt;makes genius.

&gt;&gt;Ten good albums do not necessarily surpass two great albums. 

&gt;Depending on the level of "goodness", think they _can_ surpass a fewer
&gt;number of better albums.  I dunno about you, but I can't listen to the
&gt;same thing over and over and over and over and over and over again.  There's
&gt;as _reason_ I own close to 300 CDs.  And with the _variety_ in KaTe's work
&gt;I'm more likely to be in the mood for any one of her albums at any given 
&gt;time than I am to hear LE. I listened to LE more this year than any single
&gt;KaTe album.  But I've listened to more KaTe than Tori.  That's why this whole
&gt;discussion strikes me as ludicrous at this point in Tori's career.

It depends on whether you're saying this as a music listener or a detached
music critic (and by critic I do not mean "journalist").  There's something
to be said for both points of view.

However, BTW, ten good albums *do* surpass two great albums and four crappy
albums.  But there's a difference between that inequality and the above
equality.

&gt;The way I see it, KaTe is a certified genius.  Tori *may* be the same; she
&gt;may have had a flash of brilliance which quickly faded.


&gt;&gt;Age makes no difference whatsoever.  Experience does.

&gt;Age and experience, for most people, are tightly intertwined. 

Key word: most.  See below.  And experience is what counts; the two may have
a direct relationship but they are not interchangeable.

&gt;&gt;I definitely agree that LE is more impressive than TKI

&gt;LE was written with 10 years worth of life experience more than TKI.

Correction: LE was written with 10 years worth of age more than TKI. 
Experience cannot truly be measured in years; I know teenagers who have
experienced more in their lives than eighty-year-olds.  It's not just how
long you live, it's how you live.  I think that number should be
reconsidered in terms of difference in experience as well.

&gt;&gt;However, I agree that enjoyment of music is entirely subjective...I have
&gt;&gt;albums by artists who I find utterly lacking in musical quality, but I still
&gt;&gt;enjoy listening to them.

&gt;You're buckling under to canonical concepts of musical quality that I find 
&gt;outdated.  As an example, many, many people might listen to The Pixies
&gt;and call them horrid noise with a leadsinger who can't hold a note.  But
&gt;the emotions that they call to mind for *me* make them just as important
&gt;as a lot of more commonly accepted artists.  I don't think there's any
&gt;universal music that appeals to everyone, no matter how classical perfect it
&gt;is.  The world is too big now, with contributions from too many societies
&gt;with too many ideas of what music should sound like.

Um, no, I'm not "buckling under" to anything.  The Pixies *are* horrid noise
with a lead singer who can't hold a note.  They are also quite brilliant. 
When I said "musical quality" I was referring to people like The Thompson
Twins, or Madonna.  I still listen to them; I just don't consider them
musically gifted.


&gt;&gt;Again
&gt;&gt;we have the quality vs. quantity thing; if you set me down with a Fairlight
&gt;&gt;and all the resources at Kate's command, I think I could probably dish out
&gt;&gt;some pretty amazing stuff too.

&gt;This is pretty arrogant, don't you think?  

Nope.  I didn't say it would be as good as Kate's music, I just said it
would sound pretty amazing.  If you set a monkey in front of that stuff you
might get some interesting output, too.  When you enter a relatively new
frontier, everything sounds fresh and exciting.

&gt;&gt;Let's face it; when you're working with
&gt;&gt;non-traditional instruments, you can make things sound really inventive.

&gt;You can also make things sound really shitty because you don't understand
&gt;how to use diverse sounds together to weave that sonic tapestry to which
&gt;I've referred.  It's not just a matter of sounding "inventive" because you've
&gt;got a sound nobody's heard before; it's a matter of using that sound 
&gt;*correctly*.  I shudder to think how many people have used that orchestra
&gt;stab now--but "The Dreaming" is, I feel, one of the most *proper* uses of
&gt;the sound.

True, but it doesn't take as much talent to use new equipment and sound
original as it does to use a piano and sound original.  Kate's genius, I
think, lies more in her songwriting and lyrics than in her use of
instruments.

&gt;&gt;It's harder to sound original on piano; Tori does it, Kate doesn't.  I
&gt;&gt;wonder just what Tori would come up with if she had Kate's set of sounds to
&gt;&gt;work with.

&gt;I don't know how well it would work for Tori to try KaTe like productions.
&gt;It might work exceedingly well, it might not.  While I don't think that
&gt;most of the arrangements on LE are original, they are mostly appropriate.  
&gt;I do know that a number of people I know didn't care for  Tori until they 
&gt;saw her live _without_ the trappings of a full-blown production.  For those 
&gt;people, the arrangements on LE _obscured_ Tori to the point of insignifiance.

I wouldn't give Tori that stuff either, just because I don't think her songs
would really *need* to make use of them.  Kate's artier; she would be
confined by conventional instruments.  And I don't know what you mean by
LE's arrangments not being original; methinks you need another listen. 
Also, tell those people who thought the arr'ments obscured Tori to listen
again too.
