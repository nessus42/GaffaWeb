&gt;&gt;fault, just like TKI wasn't KaTe's fault.  But I really don't think Tori
&gt;&gt;has demonstrated a total capacity for musical invention higher than KaTe's,
&gt;&gt;merely a better ability to write on/play piano.
&gt;
&gt;Well, I have to disagree here.  I think Tori's arrangements were the first
&gt;thing that drew me to her...LE's sound is so fresh and appropriate that even
&gt;if her arrangements aren't original they sure as hell sound that way.  Again
&gt;we have the quality vs. quantity thing; if you set me down with a Fairlight
&gt;and all the resources at Kate's command, I think I could probably dish out
&gt;some pretty amazing stuff too.  Let's face it; when you're working with
&gt;non-traditional instruments, you can make things sound really inventive. 
&gt;It's harder to sound original on piano; Tori does it, Kate doesn't.  I

Well, I'm afraid I have to disagree with your apparent premise that elaborate
equipment can improve the quality of a musical composition. If you can't
write well, no amount of technical wizardry will disguise the fact. I do *not*
think it is fair to imply that Kate's perceived originality stems from her use
of the Fairlight -- indeed, the Fairlight is a somewhat cliched instrument
these days. It's really her musical vision that sets her apart for me -- her
ability to compose truly groundbreaking material like The Ninth Wave or
anything off TD. LE is a great album, but it doesn't demonstrate that Tori
has the same breadth of ability that Kate possesses. Perhaps later albums
will.
