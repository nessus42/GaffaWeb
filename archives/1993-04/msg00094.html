  Got my latest shipment of Sarah paraphenalia from Nettwerk and they sent
along a newsletter, part of which I'll now type in.  Any [snide remarks]
are mine, all mine.

SARAH McLACHLAN EXPERIENCES SOME HARSH REALITIES

  In October, Sarah travelled with Terry David Mulligan(Much Music) [sounds
pretty harsh already!] and World Vision, a relief and development agency, to 
visit projects in Thailand and Cambodia.  The purpose of the trip was to give 
Sarah a first-hand experience of poverty in the Third World and introduce her 
to the work that World Vision is doing.  While in Thailand, Sarah visited the 
Emergency Home for Distressed Women and Children, a project run by a woman 
lawyer in Bangkok to provide shelter and vocational training to women.

  The next stop was to see health care workers in action amongst prostitutes
and village fishermen, two focus groups who are prime carriers of the AIDS
virus.
 
  Cambodia was the last and most difficult part of the journey.  Cambodia
may be the least healthy country on the earth as health care workers were
purged during the reign of terror of the pro-communist faction Khmer Rouge.

  This program will air on January 16th in most places (17th in others) to
coincide with World Vision 30 hour famine on February 19th-20th.  It will
only air in Canada at this time but if you want to contact World Vision to
give support or get information the number is 1-800-***-****.  [I've left
out the number to avoid having a million Sarah fans clogging up their phone
lines.  I called this yesterday and was put through to someone in the 30 hr
famine dept.  The only additional information they could add for now was that 
it would be shown on Much Music, which I had already assumed.  When they get
more information to me, I'll pass it along and post the number for those who
wish to make a donation.  That might not be until after the holidays though
since I'm going away on Fri.  Those who get Much Music (at least those of you
who watch it regularly :-) might also see something about the show on there.]

ATTENTION SARAH McLACHLAN FANS: if you're looking for rare tracks there are
four places you can find them.

1.  Philip Glass who writes contemporary classical music, has Sarah singing
on his new album due sometime in the new year.  The tracks' lyrics were 
written by poet Alan Ginsberg and the piece is called "Tree Stump" from the
album HYDROGEN JUKEBOX. (WEA) 

2.  Our Donovan Compilation known as ISLAND OF CIRCLES contains the song
WEAR YOUR LOVE LIKE HEAVEN sung by Sarah and the track BARABAJAGAL on which
she does the "Lite &amp; Fluffy" vocals amongst other folks.

3.  The totally intense cover of GLOOMY SUNDAY is on the Sarah's DRAWN TO
THE RHYTHM CD single.  [totally intense?  Now that's an understatement if
ever there was one!  And "the Sarah's" is Nettwerk's doing, not mine.  Let's
see, there's "the King", "the Boss" and now "the Sarah" :-).]

4.  WHAT LIES BEYOND (TWO BIRDS FLYING) is on the Nettwerk SOUND SAMPLER III.

  Sarah McLachlan's Limited Edition Live EP is now out so don't forget to 
pick up a copy before it becomes a hard to find item.  This EP is unique
because it contains Sarah's tour book that has been reduced to sleeve size.
Sarah will be back in the studio working on new material in January [YAY!!!]
with the new album out sometime next fall. [YAY AGAIN!!!  Wanna bet she beats
"the Kate"?  I hope not, but us Kate fans are so cynical you know :-)]

Happy Holidays!
