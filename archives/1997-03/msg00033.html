Hi folks,

   I'm on a ESPRIT's mailing list.  I thought some of you might be interested
in the Kate Items they're selling.    (I'm not associated with ESPRIT)   :-)

For those who think this is a spam, I apologize for the wasted bandwidth.


peace

   balance to use against a future order.
  All posters are sent separately in a tube so please calculate
   the postage separately.
  For unusual items please contact us for a quote.
  For Double CD's, 12' Double Packs etc please count them as
   two separate items when calculating the postage.
  WE DO NOT SEEK TO MAKE A PROFIT FROM THE POSTAGE WE CHARGE
   ALL WE ARE LOOKING TO DO IS COVER OUR OWN COSTS.

***** PLEASE NOTE We cannot generally answer detailed questions
about the items in this catalog. This is because some people have
taken to using us as a Free information service rather than as
a Mail Order Company and although if we are not busy we do
not mind this, we would rather spend our time helping genuine
customers find the items they are looking for.
However if you have just a few sensible questions we are of 
of course happy to help in any way that we can. ******
