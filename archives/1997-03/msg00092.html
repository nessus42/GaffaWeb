Hello all,

Well , guess who's been away for the last 2 months ?
I just had to sort out about 350+ love hounds emails ....
could only glance through them I'm afraid. The latest news seems to 
be the following (did I miss much else?);
1) Kate's sculpture honouring Billie Holiday
2) The upcoming Special Edition of HoL
3) A teletext news item mentioning Rolf Harris and a "fun" project 
involving film ??!!

Anyway, anyone who can bring me up to date on these ...much 
appreciated . It seems that the old "Kate really is touring" 
gag/rumour is doing the rounds ...awww ! With the growth of this 
internet thing and more and more newbie Kate fans gatherin' round the 
Gaffa-campfire ...is it really fair ? (snigger)

Some Irish news !A real blast from the past this time.
On the Sunday just before Christmas Day , RTE 1 television screened a 
programme of Delia Smiths Cookery Course filmed in (I think), late 
1979 and of course featuring Kate chatting to Delia about Vegetarian 
cooking !!!
I had known about the existence of this programme and often wondered 
about it . I was very lucky to grab a tape and record it . A 5 minute 
slot was filmed with Kate and Delia sitting outside a very summery 
East Wickham farm with a spread of foods in bowls &amp; plates before 
them . Kate was so charming and pleasant and shy and all the words 
which always describe her !The food was prepared by her John Carders 
wife (Kates' sister-in-law).
I recently found mention of Kate and 3 of her  recipes in the accompanying 
Cookery course book in a friends house .....
Also , on the Satellite TV station NBC Superchannel last week there 
was a feature on the show "The Ticket" about the launch of the 
War-Child exhibition .Brian Eno, Bob Geldof and several others were 
interviewed in the gallery but I only caught the end of this feature 
and I definitely saw Kate in the background wearing a long light 
brown coat "mingling" with a group of people !

Sean :-)
p.s. Can any other Irish fans on Lovehaounds please get in touch ?
It would be nice to chat . Also hello to Greg Gilligan ! 

</PRE>
