I am truly astounded and delighted with each passing day to discover
that I am not the only person in this country to have discovered Kate
Bush's brilliant music.  My name is Frank Cwiklik, I am from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, U.S.A., and I am attending Carnegie-Mellon University
College of Fine Arts with a major in Directing (Drama).  Much of the
inspiration for the plays and films I have been writing and directing so
far have come either directly or indirectly from KT's staggering music 
(I have written a film about my experiences in the ROcky GHorror Picture
Show fan club that, if I make it, will prominently feature KT's music as
background;  I'm damn surprised she hasn't yet written a film score-- or
has she?).  Her work has made me laugh, cry, shiver, and just plain make
me "so happy to be alive"  (Pull Out the Pin).  I have all of her albums
so far except Kick Inside, which I intend to buy simultaneously with
TSW.  
   My entries to this bboard will likely seem sort of naive at times,
but I grew up in a neighborhood where The Cure, Led Zeppelin, and
Anthrax (God ghelp us all) reigned supreme, and the only KT fan-addicts
around were me and my girlfriend (and she got the habit from me!). 
Subsequently, my knowledge of her work and life are sketchy, but
workable.  If anybody out there could give me a complete chronology of
everything she's released to date (in the States and in the U.K), for
exapmle, I would be mighty pleased and eternally grateful.
   I have heard Love and Anger, and I think it's wonderful.  I read the
one comment here on the board about the cover photo-- sounds slightly
reminiscent of Dreaming, doesn't it?  (then again, that's probably
another obvious statement-- but I'm new to this!)
   I am drooling in anticipation of TSW, I am hungrily hnting down a
copy of The Singles File on VHS (I have Whole Story and Live in Concert
already--I love 'em!), and I am anxious to hear more form all you KT
fn-addicts out there!
   Someone please send me back a message about this bboard, about the
U.S.A. fan club (there has to be one!), and anything, anything, anything
about Kate and her work!
   Here's to talking with you all again!
