&gt;Really-From: "Daniel S. Efran" &lt;de0t+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry if these have been answered already, but...
&gt;1.  In Breathing, they say "We are all going to die
&gt;_without.....(something)_"
&gt;What's the end of that line?  They do it quite a few times.  

You're hallucinating.  That _is_ the whole line, according to
my ears and my CD booklet.

&gt;2.  Has Kate _ever_ been seen on a stage in the United States?

Badly phrased!  I live in the US, and I watched the tour video, so I
guess she's been seen on a stage in the US.  To answer your question
the way you intended it: she was on Saturday Night Live a million
years ago.  Does that count?

&gt;3.  Is there a poster of the Kick Inside cover?

I've never seen one.  There may well be.  Which cover do you mean?
There are four different ones that I can think of.

&gt;4.  Is Kate's Ninth Wave related to Sting's (Love is the) Seventh Wave? 
&gt;If so, what's the reference to?  (I assume it's literary)

Hell No!  It's from Tennyson's "The Coming Of Arthur" according
to the back of the album cover.

&gt;5.  Is there anybody on here who hasn't bought Enya's Watermark album
&gt;yet?

Yes.

&gt;6.  Is Kate Bush the female Peter Gabriel or is Peter Gabriel the male
&gt;Kate Bush?

Neither.  They are the same person using a lot of makeup and special
sound processors on their vocal tracks.

&gt;7.  Either way, couldn't the two of them have come up with a better song
&gt;than Don't Give Up?  Two of the most imaginative (read: strange)
&gt;songwriters of the century collaborate to produce one of the least
&gt;interesting songs either one has ever written?  I don't get it.

The female vocal part was originally written for Dolly Parton.  She
didn't do it at the last moment, obviously.  Kate stepped in.  Check
out the Bush/Gabriel duet "Another Day" (if you can find it!) if you
don't like "Don't Give Up."  Also, I'm sure you _do_ know that Kate sings
backup on "Games Without Frontiers" and "No Self Control," both on
PG's 3rd LP.

&gt;8.  Has anyone heard Kate's guest vox on the song Sister and Brother on
&gt;Midge Ure's album Answers to Nothing?  It's pretty cool.

Dunno.  Never heard it.  Ure gives me hives.

&gt;9.  Does anyone know of any other KT guest vox that are worth having?

I may draw flames, but I like her appearance on "The Seer" by Big
Country.  She kicks ass, as she always does.

&gt;10.  Can anyone help me think of a tenth question?  I guess nine is
&gt;enough--one for each wave.

You didn't ask what the significance of "gaffa" was!
(NB: Do _NOT_ ask this question.  People will not like you if you do.
The line above was a rare example of my frivolity.)
