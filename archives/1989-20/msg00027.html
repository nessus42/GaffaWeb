Hello again, all Love-Hounds everywhere!

On my local commercial radio startion (Capital Radio), there was an interview
with Kate herself. Considering there are a LOT of people out there who don't
listen to this station, I thought that I'd post a transcript of it. It was
actually on the air about a week and a half ago, but with holidays and
the time it took me to transcribe it...anyway there was some interesting 
stuff on it.
All the attempts at punctuation are mine - but bear in mind before you flame
me that it was off the radio.

Oh well, read it and mentally digest......
--John


Announcer: ...but in the last four years since the "Hounds of Love" album,
   Kate Bush has been working on a new album - "The Sensual World". David
   Jensen was given a rare opportunity to catch up with her in her North 
   London Home.

KT: It's not a pleasant experience for me the fact that it takes so long, 
   but I can't do anything about it. So much work just seems to go into it
   for me until it is finished. I just had to keep taking breaks, so I'd take
   maybe six months off rather than just a couple of weeks, just to get away
   from it. 
DJ: Why did you call the album "The Sensual World"? 
KT: An album title is a very difficult thing. It's got to say, hopefully,
   something about the mood of the album, but also be an interesting enough
   phrase or title to catch people's attention - and that felt about the 
   best one, really, to call the album.
DJ: Church bells signal the start of "The Sensual World". What gave you 
   the inspiration for that?
KT: The original words for this song were taken from Molly Bloom's speech
   at the end of "Ulysses" by James Joyce, and I couldn't get permission
   to use the words. The original words were all about going back to a time
   when her husband proposed to her, and so the wedding bells were like the
   start of the whole song.
DJ: Your songs on this album are complex, aren't they? Unlike previously,
   I mean when you started out; it's easy to remember, it seems like
   yesterday when "The Kick Inside" came out, and the songs were more 
   straightforward. But with each successive album you've become more, I
   guess "progressive" or you've been more adventurous. Is that something
   deliberately that you're doing, or is it just a consequence of growing
   with your music?
KT: I don't know. I mean, I think really that art should become simpler 
   rather than more complicated; and in a lot of ways it worries me that
   I think this album is quite a complex thing, and I think that most people
   will have to listen to it DEFINITELY more than twice just to maybe even
   get a sense of it. That's hard for me to understand, because I just don't
   HEAR it like that, and ideally I would like the music to be an easy
   experience. But I think people's music is a reflection of that person;
   and in the same way that it takes me such a long time to make an album,
   I think it's all a process of me growing and that's just the way I am.
DJ: After four years, are you apprehensive about how it willl be recieved,
   or are you pretty confident?
KT: At the moment, I feel like I'm about to be hung. You know - will I get
  off, or will I be hung?
