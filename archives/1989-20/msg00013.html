 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: Kate-echisminimism; and Phone message news

     Jon Drukman, you don't know what the f*ck you're talking about.
Doug _did_ indeed state--as a fact--that Kate had made that statement
about _Nice_to_Swallow_ herself, in jest. When he said that, IED
denied that she had said that. It was _then_ that Doug qualified his
statement with the equivocating remark he re-posted as "proof" of
his intellectual caution yesterday. IED, unfortunately, does not
keep records going that far back, so no doubt Doug will choose to
disbelieve me (since IED has disbelieved Doug many times in the past,
this may well be poetic justice), but there is no doubt in IED's
mind that Doug's original reference to the "Nice to Swallow" nonsense
was that "Kate once said" this.
     It is true that Doug deserves some credit for finding the "quote".
However, IED has now followed suit and checked the same source himself.
What did he discover? Well, mainly that, contrary to Doug's say-so,
the magazine in question is typically _loaded_ with errors of English!
(This should not come as a surprise to readers of Doug's own postings.)
It is therefore not the _least_bit_ improbable that a similar error was
made by the editors of the magazine in this case. More likely still is
that the interviewer simply misheard Kate saying "_Night_of_the_Swallow_"
and wrote it out as "_Nice_to_Swallow_". Since the editing on that
rag was not very good, and the chances in any event of anyone on the
editorial staff noticing that a Bush title had been misrepresented were
slim, it is _extremely_ likely on the face of it that the words were
simply one of many errors that slipped through.
     But we have far more than that to support that hypothesis! IED is
_sick_and_tired_ of idiotic claims to the effect that such a "joke"
is "in character" with other remarks Kate Bush has made. IT IS NOT!
No one has ever implied, Doug and Jon, that Kate is a prude. Obviously,
she is not! The point is not whether she is afraid of using so-called
"censorable language" or sexual imagery. The point is whether she would
make a crude, vulgar, _self_-denigrating_ joke of her _own_serious_
work! And the answer is, so far as we can tell from the millions of
words on file from her to date, _NO_SHE_WOULDN'T_. She _never_has_!
     Douglas and Jon, however, have already long since shown to this
group that their own crude and vulgar sense of humour renders them
utterly incapable of distinguishing a straightforward, descriptive use
of language (as in "Because you can see my tits") from a powerfully
poetic, imagistic use of language (as in "The sheets are soaked by
your tiny fish") from a crude, gratuitous and utterly uncharacteristic
bathroom joke like "Nice to Swallow". Thankfully, most of the rest
of Love-Hounds _can_ see the differences, so with luck we can go
on to another subject now.
     Vickie of K.C., MO wanted IED to forward her thanks to all
the Love-Hounds (more than 35 of you at last count) who called her
Kate Bush telephone-message number over the last couple of days.
She wants IED to re-iterate, however--even stress--that all callers
are urged to leave a comment or two after the message ends (after
the beep), and even if they don't want to leave their names, could
they say where they are calling from? Thanks. The telephone number,
again, is (816) 561-0846. It contains a special experience for all
those who are still waiting for Kate's new album. Enjoy!
