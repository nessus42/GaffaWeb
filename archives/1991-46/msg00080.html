Hi Folks!

Graham asks:

&gt;Just a quick question. I was e-mailing with another friend of mine and as
&gt;is my wont in these things things got round to KT. He knows what kind of
&gt;fan I am so he asked me what her favourite colour was. I was stumped!!
&gt;Normally this wouldn't worry me as I head for the book shelf and my
&gt;collection KT stuff, NOTHING.
&gt; 
&gt; 	So what is it?

I don't know, but I thought that I could look it up, too. Not true. I found
a gossip story about Kate in a Dutch music magazine. It's not much, so I
translated it. I wonder if they asked Kate the question, or if they made
up the answers. Can anybody verify the answers?

I got the page from a friend of mine, and didn't ask for the issue number
or the date. These data or not available, sorry. Anyway, it must have been
about five years ago. Kate 'says'(?) that she has a steady friend for seven
years (Del), maybe that's a clue?

Magazine: Popfoto
Status:   Gossip magazine about pop artists. Not considered to have good
          interviews or reviews.
The article' has a large photo of Kate, with some general data at the side
of that photo. Besides it, is a column with text. BTW Have a look at the
date of birth!
----------
Full name:               Catherine Mary Bush
Place and date of birth: 31 July 1958, Welling, Kent.
Sign of the zodiac:      Leo
Hair colour:             Red brown
Eyes colour:             Brown
----------
No, Kate Bush is not fond of talking about her private life. So, there isn't
much known about her 'little person'. That's why Popfoto listed the 15 
most ardent questions about Kate below...

Where do you live at this moment?
- I've got two houses. One in London and one in the country side. I don't
  tell you where...

Do you have a boyfriend?
- Yes, I've got a relationship with Del Palmer for seven years. He's the
  sweetest boy in the whole world!

Do you have kids?
- No.

Which instruments do you play?
- Violin, piano and Fairlight synthesizer.

What was your first group?
- The KT Bush Band, still my permanent accompanying group. My brother Paddy
  plays in that group as well.

What education did you have?
- St Josephs Grammar School and a professional dance education from Lindsay
  Kemp. Just like David Bowie, by the way.

What's your favourite drink?
- Mineral water. (Boring, isn't it?)

And your favourite diner?
- Vegetarian.

Do you have hobbys?
- Yes, music and dance, of course. But I'd like to read as well.

What was your happiest experience in your life?
- My first number one hit, Wuthering Heights.

And your saddest?
- Maybe that it took three years, before I got that number one hit.
[I think this must have been made up. I don't think she would say
 something like this.]

Do you have a big wish?
- I would love it to play the main role in my own film!

How would you describe your character?
- Home-loving.

What do you really love to do?
- Shopping in second-hand shops.

What do you detest?
- Questions about my intimite private life
----------
But still, you don't have your favourite colour. Maybe this will make it
up with your friend?


Ben.
