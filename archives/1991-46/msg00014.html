Ben responds:

&gt;Jeffrey C. Burka says:

&gt;&gt; Gabriel has 4 albums officially titled _Peter Gabriel_ (in the U.S., the
&gt;&gt; 4th of these was called _Security_).

&gt;Yes, thank you, I know that.  That's the *reason* I was making fun of
&gt;Stephen Golding listing "Peter Gabriel - Peter Gabriel" in his top
&gt;ten list, it was ambiguous for exactly that reason.

Now, now, musn't make snappy comebacks until your reading comprehension goes
up a bit.

First off, Stephen Golden, not Golding.  But that's minor.

It was *not* Stephen Golden's top ten list.  It was Angelos Kyrlidis' DIDs,
as were printed in the latest edition of _Pulse_, Tower Record's in-store
magazine.

&gt;&gt; Uh, am I the only one who finds this slightly ambiguous?? 
&gt;
&gt;You say:
&gt;&gt; Probably
&gt;
&gt;Why, did *you* know which of the four albums was being referred to?

Why, yes, in fact, I *did* know which PG album Angelos listed in his desert
island discs--and no, he didn't tell me, nor did I pick it up in a different
newsgroup/mailing-list, nor did I even read it in Pulse.  I learned this
from reading r.m.g.  The album being referred to was Melt, '80, "The one with 
KaTe on it," or whichever title you happen to use when you talk about it.

On a slightly different subject, what is the correct word for multiple self-
titled works, and are there any artists other than Gabriel who have released
such things (I'm not counting Chicago, who specifically number their albums
as part of the titles)?
