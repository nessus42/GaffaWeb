    82. Countdown: a brief interview on the Dutch (N.B.: not the Australian
show of the same name) TV programme, fall 1985.
     Kate is on her guard, vague in her answers and even a little prickly. She
does mention that she would enjoy working with Bryan
Ferry, but otherwise pretty much keeps her own counsel.

[Transcribed by Ron Hill.  Above note by IED]

        I: [??? What would you be doing] if you weren't a singer or a dancer
or a actress, do you have any idea? 
        K: No, I don't at all.  And I think it's very interesting that this is
such a favorite question of people.  I mean, do you know you'd be doing, if
you weren't interview...
        I: Yeah, as a matter of fact I'd be working at a gas station,
probably. 
        K: Would you?
        I: Yeah. 
        K: Sincerely? 
        I: Would you come and buy gas from me? 
        K: Yeah, I might. 
        I: [Both laugh] Okay.  If you could a duet... if you would want to...
Would you want to do a duet with anybody? 
        K: Yes, I mean, there are lots of people.
        I: Yeah? 
        K: Yes. 
        I: Name a few. 
        K: Well I think the trouble with those kinds of questions is as soon
you're put them, all these names just disappear from your brain.  But
definitely, I mean there are people I admire tremendously.  Like I'd loved to
work with Bryan Ferry, his voice is superb.  And, well Peter Gabriel, it was a
great honor working with him, I'd love to work with him, again.  And all the
other names totally escape me, at the moment.  [Both laugh]  Yeah. 
        I: Okay, Kate.  Thank you very much for this interview.  Once again,
you're very welcome to Countdown, if you're ever in Holland.  And, of course,
to my gas station. 
        K: Great! 
        I: Thank you. 
        K: See you there.
