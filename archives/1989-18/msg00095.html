<PRE>
First of all, I'd like to point out something to those who say that
both IED and I might be right on the issue of whether or not Kate is
refering to going through water to avoid hounds in the line "I'll be
two steps on the water".  We CANNOT both be right.  I say that it has
this meaning IN ADDITION to whatever other meanings it might have.
IED says it does not have this meaning at all.  We cannot both be
right since our statements are strict negations of each other.

&gt; In this particular case, however, we have _Kate's_own_words_ to the
&gt; contrary--and they were elicited by !&gt;oug himself! This whole
&gt; ridiculous controversy is simply another instance of !&gt;oug's and
&gt; IED's fundamental difference of opinion on the larger question of
&gt; whether Kate's own explanations carry more or less weight than her
&gt; fans' interpretations.

Mr. Marvick, you are being completely inane and pig-headed yet again.
Kate made no such statement contrary to my interpretation, and your
insistence that she did is ludicrous, if not a downright lie.  If Kate
had thought my interpretation was not what she intended, she would
have said so.  She had no qualms at other points in the interview in
disagreeing with me, and I don't see why this part of the interview
should have been any exception.  What Kate said is that she picked
"two steps" because it "suggests that you intend to go forward".  This
does not contradict my interpretation at all.  In fact, it rather
nicely agrees with it.

How I see this section of the song, is that Kate is saying that she
needs her lover to help her overcome her fear of love (i.e. take off
her shoes), and then she can complete the process of running through
the water.  This will make the hounds dissolve (the hounds being her
fear), and once she no longer sees love as a pack of hounds, she can
face it for the wonderful thing that it is.

I also think that this section may certainly have other layered
meanings, which is why I asked Kate about it.

If IED is so certain of his interpretation, will he please do us a
favor and explain what water has to do with facing hounds?

Also, I point out again, that if IED is so sure of himself, why is he
so unwilling to take me up on the bet I have repeatedly offered.  He
seems to have even backed out of the merely verbal part of the bet
(the part about him admitting publicly that he doesn't really know as
much about Kate Bush as he will have everyone believe).  Why is this?
Because he knows that on issues where the matter CAN be proven or
disproven, that he WILL be disproven yet again.

&gt; But that line comes at the climax, more or less, of the song, and as
&gt; such it seems more likely to IED that the meaning Kate intended was
&gt; what she said it was and no more, since that would be the only way
&gt; for the song to be consistent with the straightforward resolution as
&gt; depicted in Kate's own self-directed video.

It doesn't come at just the climax of the song, Mr. Marvick.  It
occurs throughout the song.  Furthermore, you seem to have ignored
that in the video, even though near the end Kate has accepted love by
voluntarily putting on the handcuffs, the protagonists are still on
the run, even at the very end of the video.
