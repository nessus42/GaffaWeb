 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Mailbag

 &gt;&gt;     Listen to Vickie Mapes's radio programme, "Suspended in Gaffa" ,
 &gt;&gt;next Saturday, October 16, at 10 p.m., if you live in the Kansas
 &gt;&gt;City area. Last Saturday, October 9, Vickie gave the song its U.S.
 &gt;&gt;debut, and next week she will have a fuller preview of the new
 &gt;
 &gt;    OK, how to the rest of us get into a time warp to go forward into
 &gt;October Like you?

     Oops! Thanks for bringing this error to IED's attention. He apologizes
for the error--seems he has oKTober on the brain these days. He meant
_September_ 9 and 16, of course.
     For the record, though, the U.S. single, _Love_and_Anger_, _is_ coming
out, in 12" form, on October 1. A rep for CBS in Chicago said they had
been listening to the album over the weekend, and that there weren't any
tracks that they would call "U.S. single-type material", so IED guesses
they chose _Love_and_Anger_ as the least _un_American of the bunch. Album
date: October 9.

 &gt;   andrew, i sometimes wonder what this newsgroup would be like without
 &gt;your delightful, child-like bursts of enthusiasm.  perhaps lizooshka
 &gt;and i can start an ied fanzine...

     Well, IED can guess that at least a few Love-Hounds feel that
they could to cut down considerably on their daily reading-time
without Andrew's bursts. On the other hand, they'd also never have
learned much of anything about Kate Bush. It's a plus-and-minus
situation, IED concludes. Glad to see Tracy doesn't mind his
occasionally overbearing foibles, however.

 &gt;to larrylovehoundextrordinaire and ied for their latest treasured
 &gt;possessions!  ied, you devil you.

     Ssshhh!

     And _she_ thought she couldn't cope, but she _did_."

   P.S.: See? She _really_is_.
   P.P.S.: About Jim A.'s request for a biography of Kate--Naturally, you
are to disregard the moronic crap someone posted about your query yester-
day. If you want to learn the details about the life of Kate Bush, you
are encouraged to read the chronology which is contained somewhere
within Love-Hounds's voluminous Archive. Or you can seek out the book,
_Kate_Bush_Complete_, which is available in oversize paperback at
very few bookstores. Or you can e-mail IED, who will forward a
far-too-lengthy Kate-vita to you, providing you have a compatible
address.
