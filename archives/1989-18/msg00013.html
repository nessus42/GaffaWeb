 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Special Notice

     This is a pitch to all Love-Hounds who value Kate Bush's music, and
their own souls.
     When the new single, _Love_and_Anger_, comes out on CBS Alternatives
Records on October 1, EVERYBODY PLEASE GO OUT AND _BUY_10_COPIES_ of it
immediately!
     IED doesn't know if everybody reading this forum fully appreciates
this, but Kate's future plans in America, as well as her new U.S.
record label's future promotional plans regarding her new record and
subsequent singles, AND all possibilities of a Tour of Life II, will
LARGELY DEPEND upon RECORD SALES VOLUME.
     The Love-Hounds, collectively and individually, are in a
unique position, due to their extremely broad national demographic
distribution, to HELP PROMOTE THE NEW RECORD! If every one of us
Love-Hounds makes even a small effort to SPREAD THE WORD and
BUILD MARKET INTEREST, Kate's American career could take off at
last. So please, everyone, let's get out there and do a little
grass-roots work on Kate's behalf, okay? Give it some thought,
please, people.
     A couple of specific suggestions: you could visit your nearest
major chain record outlet--you know, the big boring Top-40 retail
stores like Music Plus, Sam Goody, Wherehouse, etc.: the names
change from state to state, but they're always exactly the same
whichever town you're in, and more and more they seem to be owned
by the same conglomerate--and repeatedly drop a word in the store's
main buyer's ear about how important it is that Kate be well stocked
and displayed. Give them any ideas you might have about how they might
display the promotional artwork for the album, and try to communicate
your enthusiasm to them, somehow or other.
     Also, consider writing a letter to your local newspaper, alerting
them to the imminent release of Kate's new album, and how great it
would be if they had an early, full-length feature review in their
arts section on Kate's career and the latest work.
     You could also suggest that they try to get a telephone interview
with Kate, and do a real feature based on the interview.
     And what about dropping a postcard to Kurt Loder at MTV, asking
him to push Kate's video for airtime. You could mention that you
remember and appreciate his excellent review of _The_Dreaming_ for
_Musician_ magazine back in 1983. Someone who seemed to understand
Kate's talent as well as he did in that review might be persuaded
to do some good for her at MTV, providing her fans let him know
that they're interested.
     Naturally, you could also do a lot of good by soliciting the
various rock radio stations on Kate's behalf. But you can _also_ make
a mark by _writing_ the station manager a letter. It's amazing
what effect a nicely typed letter can have sometimes, even when a
bunch of phone calls seem to fall on deaf ears.
     And speaking of writing letters, one place that could _really_
benefit from written reminders of the size and involvement of Kate's
fans in America is CBS Records itself. Unfortunately, CBS is a huge
conglomerate, and not all signs of their plans for Kate have been
auspicious ones. Some of their reps seem to be almost totally ignorant
of Kate Bush, even though she's been signed with them for more than
a year and a half now. Call them up! Write them letters! Send them
cards! LET THEM KNOW YOU CARE!
     IED apologizes for his domineering tone in this posting (and
in many others which have preceded it), but he hopes you will be
able to consider the content and ignore the language. Please,
everyone, remember Kate this October--it's the only hope any of
us have of getting to see a second Tour, and that should be
motivation enough.
