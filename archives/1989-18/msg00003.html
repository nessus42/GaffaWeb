Tony Levin played with Peter Gabriel on every PG release
including bootlegs except Peter's latest "Passion".  Tony
and Jerry played on Fripp's "Exposure" recording which
actually came out on CD for a while.  Tony was an integral
part of the 1980-1984 King Crimson lineup, on bootlegs,
"Discipline", "Beat", "Three of a Perfect Pair" and videos.

Tony Levin was in Yoko Ono's band, I think back in 1980 ish. 
He played on several Carly Simon records, a Frida (ABBA)
album and played with Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) on
at least one soundtrack and something else.  He played with
Robbie Robertson I think.  He played on  Pink Floyd's
latest studio recording but didn't tour with Floyd.
He played on some songs from two Roches recordings
"The Roches" and "Keep On Doing".  He played on Bryan
Ferry's "Boys and Girls" recording.  Being a studio-ish
musician, I know but can't think of several other
recordings he's played on.

WIth Bill Bruford, Bill and Tony played on one song on
Al DiMeola's "Scenario" recording, and the pair played
with David Torn and Mark Isham on Torn's "Cloud About
Mercury".  Bill toured with Torn but Tony didn't.
Bill was beyond awesome on the Torn tour, mindblowing.
Tony was last seen recording with Anderson, Bruford,
Wakeman and Howe and IS touring with them as
I type this message.  Tony does justice to Squire's work.

Tony Levin also invented the seatbelt.

Sorry I don't have a good scoop on Jerry Marotta.

Jerry, Tony and Robert Fripp along with one or two
other unidentified musicians were rumored to have
rehearsed in preparation of a reformation of King Crimson
back in 1987, but I think this rumor evolved from
mistaken identities in David Sylvian's rehearsals
when he toured back then, in which none of the
people I just mentioned actually toured with Sylvian.

Fripp very recently played as "Fripp/Fripp"
somewhere in England as a friend who was planning
to see it told me a couple weeks ago.  "Fripp/Fripp"
apparently played in Paris in May, and is thought
to consist of Toyah Wilcox (who someone claims
is Fripp's wife hence...), a crafty guitarist playing
Stick and a drummer who Fripp has played with
before but I can't remember if it could possibly
be Jerry Marotta.  None of this is confirmed.
