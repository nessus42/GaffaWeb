Hi all,

recently I asked about a list of all (known) Kateollectibles. Almost no
response was availlable. So now I will make a start. That is a start after
some basic ground. Since yesterday my 'Illustrated Collector's Guide To KB'
arrived and since this is a pretty good source I will only give my additions
to the ICGtKB: (about 90 items!)

- the book itself - surely, 'The Illustrated Collector's Guide to Kate Bush'
  is a colecitble by itself.
- Rocket Man / Candle In The Wind / CITW instr.:
  - Collector's Edition:
    U.K. Digi-Pak CD single and an 8x10 Portrait Lithograph, signed and 
    numbered by the Artist (mine is 617/2000).
    This one comes in a 8+x10+ card fold, the litho is printed on this cover
    too, it is a very nice drawing of Kate's head. 
    The digi-pak in the collector's edition unfolds in a different way than 
    the digi-pak of the CD single that I've got. Even the pictures are
    ordered in another way and the CD looks different. C.E: black with silver
    printing. 'Normal': violet with white printing. The 'normal' one is made
    in Germany, the C.E. one in UK.
  - German CD single:
    see above, the order number is 866 311-2
  - US Promo CD (Rocket Man only):
    This CD is labeled read-on-white and obviously a promo item of the 
    John/Taupin album. My CD came in a thin jewel pack without cover, a
    big sticker with 'promotion copy - not for sale' (black on white) is
    stuck directly on the CD (ugh!). Unfortunately this sticker covers the
    order number of that CD. It is manufactured by Polygram/Polidor.
  - Australian Cassingle (Rocket Man / CITW:
    This cassingle (866 310-4) plays both tracks on both sides. Thanks to 
    Katrina for the tape!
- A Lioness At Heart
  I think we all know (of) it by now. There is a numbered (ltd. to 1000), a
  limited (to 2500 or so) and a third edition. The limited ones come with
  T-Shirt, all of them come with Lionheart CD, colorful photobook, postcard
  and a beautiful 12" hard cover.
- Running Up That Hill (12" maxi single, usual contents):
  EMI Electrola 1C K 060 - 20 0758 6 (Germany)
- Cloudbusting (12" maxi single, usual contents):
  EMI K 060 - 20 0898 6 (Holland)
  This one has a slightly different cover - There's a white frame around the
  (usual) picture, both on front and back side. It's sleeve is much thicker
  card paper than the UK issue and it is open on the top side, not on the
  right side.
- Hounds Of Love (12" maxi single, usual contents):
  EMI Electrola 1C K 060 - 20 1056 6 (Germany)
- The Big Sky (Single Mix) - 12" promo SPRO9701, US, both sides are the same,
  33 1/3 rpm.
- The Big Sky (12" maxi single, usual contents):
  EMI Electrola 1C K 060 - 20 1209 6 (Germany)
  The german TBS maxi single has a "printed sticker" on it, saying 
  "Maxi-Single, 45 RMP"
- The Big Sky (same as above, except: The A-side label is blank - only the
  red circle of general copyright restrictions is there)
- (just a correction)
  Experiment IV (12" maxi single, usual contents):
  EMI K060 is not a very good description - you could say "it is a maxi single
  from EMI" and there would be no further information. It's complete order
  number is K 060 - 20 1545 6. Mine is made in Holland, the French order number
  is also printed on the cover (PM 212 - 20 1545 6). The vinyl itself only 
  gives away that it is made in the EEC...
- The Sensual World (12" maxi single, usual contents):
  My UK version of this has the double groove on side A without being a promo
  version. Usual number EMI 12EM 102.
- Interview disc:
  Kate Bush - Just Saying It ... Could Even Make It Happen
  Made in England - Cloud Bus 10
  This one is especially well designed - it is a 12" vinyl picture disc that
  actually has a picture cover - so there are 4 different, big color pictures
  with that one.
- The Secret Policeman's Third Ball (vinyl LP, usual contents):
  208 608-630 (Virgin, Germany)
- The Secret Policeman's Third Ball (cassette):
  408 608-630 (Virgin, Germany?)
- (just a correction):
  AMIGA - this could not be the title of the album, because AMIGA is the
  usual label of East German LPs. You wouldn't call the Mini EP Kate by
  'Kate Bush - EMI America' (or Canada...;-). I don't think it is a pirate.
- Peter Gabriel - Cv video discs:
  I have this one on a 12" PAL CDV and have seen it on an 8" PAL CDV.
  (unfortunately I have no CDV player...) This CDV is made in UK for (at least)
  Germany (it is labeled partially in German). It's order number is 080 512 1.
- Kate Bush - The Whole Story video disc:
  I have this one on a 12" PAL CDV. It is made in UK for Europe (partially
  labeled in English, German, French and (?) Spanish). It's order number
  is 080 504 1.
- The Kick Inside (Canadian vinyl LP):
  mine has another order number: SW-11761 (as US release) but the same cover.
  Is it a re-release?
- The Kick Inside (German vinyl LP):
  There is a re-release with a 'Fame - special price'-sticker on it. It has
  a different order number (1C 038 - 15 7656) and a very poor dust protection
  paper insert - there are 'ads' for other LPs by other artists on the Fame 
  'label'.
- The Kick Inside (German vinyl LP);
  I don't believe the 'Including Hit-Single "Wuthering Heights"'-sticked LP
  is the original German edition - I have one without that printed "sticker".
  (same order number).
- Lionheart (French vinyl LP from Sonopresse):
  Mine has a different order number: 2S 068 06859
- Lionheart (German vinyl LP):
  Again, there is a 'Fame'-version of it: 1C 038 - 1575471
- Lionheart (German vinyl LP):
  And there is the non-Fame version, and it is not the half-speed-mastered one
  (1C 064-06 859)
- Hounds of Love (vinyl LP, Holland):
  nothing special, 062 - 24 0 3841
- Hounds of Love (UK vinyl LP):
  I have one with a 'double cover': Both cover halves are there twice, sticked
  together.
- The Whole Story (UK vinyl LP):
  Mine has a sticker: "KBTV 1 - Includes her greatest hits: WH (new voc), RUTH,
  Baboo., TMWTCIHE and the new single Exp. IV".
- The Sensual World (German vinyl LP):
  Order number: 064 - 7 93078 1
- Never For Ever (German vinyl LP):
  Order number: 1C - 064-07 339
- The Dreaming (German vinyl LP):
  Order number: 1C 064-64 589
- Hounds of Love (German vinyl LP):
  Order number: 1C 062 - 24 0384 1
  This one has a printed "sticker": "Incl. Single-Hits: RUTH, Cl-B., HoL, 
  Big Sky" (The 'The' before 'Big Sky" is really missing!)
- The Whole Story (German vinyl LP):
  Order number: 1C 062 - 26 1201 1
- Let It Be (Ferry Aid 7" vinyl single):
  There is a Dutch one: CBS 650796 7 (AID 1)
- Ne T'Enfuis Pas - Un Baiser D'Enfant (French 7" vinyl single):
  This one is NOT only availlable as part of the UK single file box - I have
  a French single with that song combination (5099 1 65152 7)
- Running Up That Hill - Under The Ivy (German 7" vinyl single):
  order number: 1C 006 - 20 0757 7
- Running Up That Hill - Under The Ivy (UK promo 7" vinyl single)
  This one is in a gatefold sleve and has two further pictures. KB1. I don't
  know if the status as a 'promo' actually holds since it is only printed on
  the seller's stickers, not on the sleeve or the disc itself.
- Cloudbusting - Burning Bridge (German 7" single)
  Order number: 009 - 20 0899 7
- Experiment IV - Wuthering Heights (new vocal) (German 7" single)
  Order number: 1C 006 - 20 1533 7
- Love And Anger - Ken (German 7" single)
  This one is also available as a German gatefold single with 4 page booklet
  in the middle (a few pictures). Same order number as the UK one: EMG 134.
- Love And Anger - Ken (UK 7" single)
  and this one exists without a gatefold sleeve: EM 134
- Interview Discs:
  - The 7" Colour pic disc "Bush 7P" on p. 82 of the ill. coll. guide is
    also availlable as a white label test pressing with the pictures on
    a loose sleeve (only folded, not sticked)
  - There is another 7" interview pic disc named "KB 3" with two b/w photos
- Cassettes:
  All albums (incl. the Canadian Mini-EP) are availlable on cassettes.
  The Kidk Inside in (at least) the following versions:

- Hounds of Love (US CD)
  Mine is from EMI America, order number CDP 7 46164 2 / DIDX 1100
  Interesting about this one is that the text 'Kate Bush' and 'Hounds of Love'
  on the cover is not centered above/below the picture, but it is on top right/
  bottom left. The text on the side of the jewel pack is big letters in
  a Helvetica-like style, blueish-green 'Kate Bush', pink 'HoL', blueish-green
  'Emi America/CDP 746164'.
- The Whole Story (US CDs)
  One is from EMI USA, the other from EMI America. The American one has the
  additional order number DIDX 1099, both have CDP 7-46414-2. The side of
  the jewel box shows 'KB' and 'TWS' in the same colors as the above HoL,
  but the American one has 'EMI AMERICA CDP...' in blueish-green, the US one
  has 'EMI CDP...' in black on it. The CDs themselves do not differ, they are
  both from EMI America.
