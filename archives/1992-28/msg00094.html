&gt;I have a question that I know someone here can help me with--I have read about
&gt;Happy Rhodes on this bulletin board before, and one night late, I heard an
&gt;interview with her on public radio.  So I know she exists (or they? is it the
&gt;name of a group or an individual person?), BUT no one I know has heard
&gt;of her (and my friends know a lot about music).  I've also been unable
&gt;to find anything by her in a couple of record stores that have a wide 
&gt;selection of music.  Can someone help me with this?  I feel like I'm living
&gt;an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Where is this woman??

Nope, you're not in the Twilight Zone. She exists and lives in Albany, NY.
Post again if you didn't get my e-mail with the pertinent information.

The Public Radio show you heard was called _Echoes_ and I was just getting
ready to post this when you wrote. Glad you heard the show!

 ---------------------------------------

For anyone who likes to keep track of Kate references, this is part
of an interview with Happy Rhodes that aired on the syndicated
radio program _Echoes_. This was heard in quite a few places
around the country.

========================================================================

I'm John D. Liberto [?] and you're hearing Echoes.

Happy Rhodes has been compared to Kate Bush, and her music has that
magical resonance that permeates Bush's best work.  Despite her name, 
though, her early music depicted an unhappy life, populated by 
tormenters, aliens and hidden traumas.

With her first CD, Warpaint, however, Happy Rhodes switches gears with a 
richly textured, outward looking music of affirmation.

&lt;Part of interview deleted&gt;

========== Wuthering Heights, KT ========== (this begins playing)

Interviewer:

...listeners can find solace in her music. 
Rhodes found comfort in the music of Kate Bush,
the British singer with whom she's often compared.
Happy Rhodes readily admits the influence.

Happy:

    There's a certain feminine piercing angelic quality that I like.
    Granted in the last four albums, the earlier four albums,
    I sounded very much like Kate Bush...

========== Would That I Could, HTR ========== (begins playing)

  ...because when I was in my very formative songwriting years
  from 15 to 17 years old I was listening to Kate Bush and singing 
  along with her records.  That's how I learned to sing basically.
  Before that it was Queen. And you know they all have those really high,
  high ranges. That'll do it.

&lt;Rest of interview deleted&gt;

===========================================================================

This next one is from an interview on WXPN with Helen Light.

...

Helen Light:

Well, now go into Happy Rhodes 2. This is "Let Me Know, Love" and it
definitely has a feel of Kate Bush. Are you, any way, have you gotten into
Kate Bush at all?

Happy Rhodes:
Big, big Kate Bush fan and it shows, and, you know, so sue me, I sound
like her. (laughs)

HL: So it shows, so here we go. At 88.5 WXPN, Happy Rhodes.

["Let Me Know, Love" plays]
