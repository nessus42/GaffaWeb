In article &lt;9209280834.AA12422@relay1.UU.NET&gt; you write:
&gt;
&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I spent a very gabrielized weekend with the brand-new US. I listened to
&gt;it five or six times and here are my impressions.



&gt;CAUTION:
&gt;Those of you who want to have a surprise shouldn't read further!

Last week a local station played a two-hour special on Peter. It
was recorded in a studio in Hollywood with an audience of fans.
The interviewer (Red Beard, I swear, that's what it sounded like)
asked questions, but the audience didn't get to ask any.      

A few songs from _US_ were played, as well as some older songs.
The impression I got was that they were trying to stick to the
more "mainstream" and better-known songs. 

Here are my impressions of the new songs played. Dirk, it seems our
tastes are *very* similar. (My favorite older solo song is "San 
Jacinto" - what's yours?)

&gt;Come talk to me - a copy of Biko, with bagpipes  :-(

:-| to this one, I reserve judgement until I hear a properly
uncompressed and loud version.

&gt;Love to be loved - the highlight of US (IMHO), very melodic  8-)

Yes. Of the songs I heard, this was my favorite.

&gt;Blood of Eden - the successor of Don't give up, with the difference that
&gt;                Sinead only does the backing vocals in the chorus
&gt;                (reminds me to Paul Simon). Another highlight  8-)

I was *so* pissed off that this didn't appear on the _Until the End of
the World_ soundtrack. Now I'm happy again.

&gt;Steam - the soul/funk version of Quiet steam, a copy of Big time :-|

I didn't like this one at *all*. :-(

&gt;Only us - very inapproachable, like The family and the fishing net  :-)
&gt;Washing of the water - a gospel-like piano ballad, could be from PG1 :-)

These weren't played.

&gt;Digging in the dirt - no comment  :-)

Well, I love this song. it's even better after seeing the video at least
once, to get a deeper feel for what the song's all about.

&gt;Fourteen black paintings - similar to We do what we're told  :-)

Not played. Can't wait to hear it.

&gt;Kiss that frog - maybe the rockiest song he ever did, with distorted
&gt;                 guitar and organ and harmonica  :-|

:-( but maybe it will grow on me.

&gt;Secret world - a floating song with a U2-like guitar  :-)

I liked this one quite a bit.

A record store 2 blocks away from where I work is opening early to sell
the CD. It will be on sale too, so I'm going to pick it up on my way
to work. It will be *torture* to have it in my possesion all day long
and not be able to listen to it!!

&gt;Dirk
&gt;(now waiting for the new Kate Bush and Happy Rhodes albums)

You bet!!

&gt;Has anybody heard the new Judie Tzuke album Wonderland? It's great! :)

I saw it in a store, but it cost $24.00 :-( so it will have to wait.
Any comparisons to her other albums?
