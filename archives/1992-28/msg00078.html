&gt; I would like to know about the bonus-recordings that appear on the CD-box
&gt; This Woman's Work. In the box, I've heard, there is two CD:s including
&gt; unreleased material by Kate. What songs appear on these bonus discs?

All the material on the two discs has been previously released on vinyl.
The only stuff previously on CD are the b-sides from the singles off the TSW
album.

The songs include most of the official EMI b-sides, the extended mixes
from the HOL 12" singles, the Live on Stage EP + December Will Be Magic.
In toal there are over 100 mins of music on the 2 discs but a few tracks
did not make it (e.g. Dreamtime).

&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't think of buying the box, because I have all the CD:s already 
&gt; and I don't want to buy second copy of all these albums.
&gt; Is it possible to get these additional discs separately? 
&gt; Are they worth buying?

Many of us were in this position when the box was released.  Some of us bit
the bullet and paid over the price for the set while others didn't.  
There were hopes that the 2 discs would be released separately, especially
in countries where the set was not officially released (UK, Japan and Canada).
It does not look as if this will happen.  

If you buy the set you can always sell your duplicate CDs.  I managed to sell
all my European CDs to subscribers to this group for what I regard to be 
a fair price.  There are some wonderful songs on the 2 discs, with many people
thinking many of them are better than album tracks.  If you think you can
live without them, or don't have the money, it may not be worth it. For some
though it was an essential acquisition despite the cost.  The Japanese version
has lyrics to the b-sides songs unlike the UK version + other differences
outside song selection.    

I hope you are able to make the right decision for you and that this info 
helps.  I have seen copies of the Japanese set but thought the UK version
was long since gone.
