              Re:     EQUIPOISE
                      ---------
                   State of Balance

All my life, I've found relating to animals an effortless thing. 
I know that I have oceans of compassion for them, mostly because
I've always believed they were innocent and pure.  It was always
easy to care about a being, when you perceived that being as a
blameless, simple creature of nature.

I was also painfully aware that I didn't hold the same compassion
for human beings.  The death of an animal has always had a more 
profound effect on me than the death of a human.  Somewhere along
the way, I decided this needed to change.  I am, after all, a
human being.  This began a long thought process for me, trying to
figure out how I can be so judgemental of humankind...why did I 
have such a fatalistic attitude about my own race?

During the year of 1992 (the time of the writing of the album), I
came upon many revelations about the way I relate to humans.  The
most important is as follows;

In order for me to be truly at ease with people, and humans as a
race, I first must be at ease with myself.  I am the microcosm of
all humanity.  If I refuse to see the darker aspects of myself, 
then I automatically condemn those with the same traits.  If I
refuse to acknowledge that I have certain weaknesses, then I
automatically alienate those people with similar weaknesses.  If
I take no pride in my own honesty, kindness and humor, then I
certainly won't be able to appreciate those characteristics in
*other* people.

I finally realized that everything I considered to be "unfavorable"
about my personality, was exactly what I needed to *embrace* and
*accept*.  We're taught to supress all things ugly and to deny
any personal idiosyncrasies or "deviant" behaviors.  In doing so, 
we remove ourselves from humankind and furthermore, we invalidate
the existence of every human being.

I believe now, that a more perfect *state of balance* can be
achieved, by accepting and embracing the *DARK* as well as the
*LIGHT* in ourselves.  One doesn't exist with the other, and
true compassion for humanity doesn't come from a constant
squelching or "stomping out" of the darker aspects of ourselves.
True compassion comes from understanding.  This new personal 
knowledge colors my life now, and did, throughout the year of
1992.  Thus, the title _EQUIPOISE_.


Thanks so much to everyone for listening.  I hope this new album
has at least a little something to offer you all.

                                         PEACE
                                        
                                           Happy Rhodes
                                           January 25, 1993
