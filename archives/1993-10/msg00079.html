nbc@inf.rl.ac.uk sez:
&gt;As woj has volunteered I will let him do the track listing. 

gee, thanks. :)

it's still this week, so i'm still in the clear...here, y'all KaTe KolleKTor
sKum, is the track listing on the bootleg cd _butterfly kisses_.

1. wuthering heights (this is apparently from some tv program - i can think
   of two possibilities, though i do not know which this is from - i had
   never heard this recording of the song before, however.)

2. the wedding list (prince's trust gala concert, 21 july 1982)

3. the man with the child in his eyes (unidentified tv performance, possibly
   from saturday night live, but i'm not sure.)

4. them heavy people (unidentified tv performance - features backing vocals 
   by a woman who does not sound like Kate at all.)

5. under the ivy (the tube - neil said this was not available on anything 
   other than video bootlegs, but i believe that is incorrect. if i'm not
   mistaken, this also showed up on the _passing through air_ vinyl bootleg,
   though i'm not sure of this.)

6. breathing (comic relief concert, 4/6 april 1986)

7. do bears ... in the woods (comic relief conerts, 4/6 april 1986 - duet with
   rowan atkinson.)

8. running up that hill (the secret policeman's third ball, 2nd night - with
   david gilmour on guitar)

9. the long and winding road (sound in s, japanese tv, 23 june 1978)

10. she's leaving home (sound in s, japanese tv, 23 june 1978)

11. moving (unidentified tv performance, possible 7th tokyo song festival,
    18 june 1978 - another new track for my ears.)

the rest of the cd is all tracks taken from some unidentified tour of life 
concert: room for the life/strange phenomena/violin/in the warm room/kite/
wuthering heights.

the packaging is decent: the cover is KaTe done up in the violin getup that
she wore in the bbc special. inside the jewel booklet (which is more a pamph-
let, i should say) are three black'n'white shots of KaTe in a dancing leo-
tard and tights - maybe i'll digitize them sometime.

as i mentioned before, sound quality is fair to good as bootlegs go. strong
recording levels were used, so that is a good sign. don't expect to hear
crystalline sounds if you buy this, but it is not muddled beyond reconition
either.
