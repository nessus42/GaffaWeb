[Here are some more "Experiment IV" possiblities..]
[Taken from sci.electronics]

&gt; Sheer rumors?

In article &lt;818@neoucom.UUCP&gt;, wtm@neoucom.UUCP (Bill Mayhew) writes:

&gt; While this isn't exactly electronic, the Germans in WW II
&gt; experimented with a battlefield device which burned propane in a
&gt; quarter wave stub.  The energy released by the combustion process
&gt; generated a lethal shockwave that vibrated the enemy to pieces.  The
&gt; weapon was not terribly useful due to its poor directionality.

	Bell Labs and Western Electric conducted extensive research in
the military applications of sound during the latter 1930's and during
WW II.  Some of this research is still classified.
	One project which became rather public was called "Project
Whistle".  This work was begun in the late 1930's, and one of its
efforts was to investigate the acoustics of sirens and develop devices
which were more efficient.  At the time, sirens were only 1 to 2
percent efficient with respect to acoustic energy versus total energy
input.
	While one compelling reason to develop powerful sirens was use
as an air raid warning device, the other classified reason was for
their use as a potential weapon.  By 1941 a truly mamouth siren was
constructed and mounted on a flatbed truck.  It used a turbine air
compressor powered by a 100 hp gasoline engine, along with another 20
hp engine to operate the rotor in the siren.  This "siren" developed a
frequency of 440 Hz which was - believe it or not - virtually a square
wave.
	Tests and acoustic measurements were "quietly" conducted at a
remote area in New Jersey, until a public test was ready.  In early
1942 the siren was parked on the Manhattan Bridge in NYC and tested.
The siren was so loud that it produced something like 90 dB at TWO
MILES.  Now that's LOUD!  90 dB is at the begining threshhold of ear
damage for prolonged exposure.
	This siren was later mass-produced (on a small scale, though),
and was called the "Chrysler-Bell Victory Siren".

	Out of curiosity, do any Bell Labs people out in Netland know if
any of these sirens still exist?

In regards to article &lt;2297@kitty.UUCP&gt; From larry@kitty.UUCP (Larry Lippman):

Sounds like Jericho to me.
