<PRE>
     Thanks for the reminder re Robyn's new fanzine, and the
interesting note about IED's alma mater recognizing Kate Bush. Can we
hope for a review of the program from someone in the area? And maybe
Doug could let them have access to a few of the more esoteric audio
bits?

      [	It wasn't all that great.  They played most of the songs from
	her albums, some of the newer B-sides, and interview bits from
	those unofficial interview picture-disks.  I don't think they
	were true fans, since when I called them up to invite them to
	come over sometime and watch all my rare Kate Bush videos,
	they didn't seem very interested.  -- |&gt;oug ]

     Daniel, IED doesn't recommend that you pay that kind of money for
the "Don't Give Up" CD, although it might _eventually_ prove to be a
worthwhile investment at that price -- nothing on it that wasn't
already on the album CD, though, so what's the point? Not so the
"Cloudbusting" CD. And it has always been more expensive and harder to
find. So, o.k., here's the news: CD Banzai has a mint-condition copy
of the "Cloudbusting" CD for sale for US$50 ($48 cash). If you are
that desperate, you could send IED the A$s and he'll send it out to
you -- if it's still there. ($50 is actually a good price compared to
what some crooks have been asking.)  The problem is, now that it's
been mentioned in L-Hs, it probably won't be there by the end of the
day. They really are rare.

     As for where one can find KT bootlegs in Colorado, the only
advice IED can give is that you check the listings in _Goldmine_ each
week. They always list the date and place of the next record-swapmeet
in every state. Failing that, there was also an ad in the last issue
for _Under the Ivy Bush_ from the following dealer, for $20.00 plus
$3.00 postage:

Ken Barker, Bayside Pkwy., Fort Myers, Florida 33901, Phone: (813) 337-0898

     To those who missed the last posting of the "discography": IED is
working on an updated list of KT's complete music, and it will appear
as soon as it's ready.
     Doug, why do you say that Kate is unlikely ever to tour again?
IED, for one, is now quite confident of a tour, even within the next
eighteen months, including at least a couple of U.S. dates.  The
latest Newsletter sure gives all the right indications.
