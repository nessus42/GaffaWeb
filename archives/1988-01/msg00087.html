   In response to IED's question about a gang trip to Europe to hear
KB tour, I reply, as eagerly and only slightly more slowly than |&gt;oug
(who has an unfair advantage here)

    * Sign me up. *

    My enthusiasm is tempered in two directions:
   
    *) I read somewhere that Kate was unlikely ever to tour again.

       ("Somewhere" was in Love-Hounds, natch, where it has repeatedly
        been stated in no uncertain terms.)

      [	It is I who says that Kate is unlikely to tour again.  That's
	just my opinion, however.  I wonder what makes IED think she
	is likely to tour in the near future?  -- |&gt;oug ]

    *) It would depend to large degree on timing.

       (I am _always_ looking for excuses to nip back to England,
        which I seem to manage about once every 18 months or two
        years. I already have it halfway in mind to go summer 1988
        and (unless my friends' marriage plans alter) summer 1989
        as well. Plans could always be nudged a month or so in either
        direction by ultra-special events like a KB tour. 
           On the other hand, work does tend to interfere with
        romantic visions of hopping the Atlantic. So it depends.)

    Do we have even a first-order guess as to the time-frame here?
Like when would the album be coming out? Like when will we know when
the album is coming out?
    Even, when will we know when we will know when the album is coming out?

    (I sort of want to hear it, see...)
