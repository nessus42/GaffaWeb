The Sugarcubes' lead singer is named Bjork, as is easily evident from
the current gushing over them in any random copy of Melody Maker.  Is
it a coincidence that your `my favorite single of 1987' also happened
to be MM's as well?

I hope when Victor O'Rear said

&gt; Bleeker Bobs: 7663 Melrose Ave, LA
&gt;	Another small store with nothing interesting.

that he meant `with nothing interesting as far as Kate Bush goes'
because otherwise he's full of sh*t.  Unfortunately, what they *do*
have that is `interesting' is also vastly (and sometimes laughably so)
overpriced, so it remains on their walls (would you pay *$125* for the
recent Soft Cell 12" `Where The Heart Is/It's a Mug's Game'?  Didn't
think so ... ) This is made doubly frustrating by the fact that they
have stuff which no one else has, so there's no competition, but you
wouldn't ever lower yourself to paying their outrageous prices just to
get it, even though you can't get it anywhere else.  Arggh ...

For those of you in the Boston area reading this, you should support
Ground Zero, at 512 Mass. Ave. in Cambridge (just a few blocks up the
street from the Central station).  Good mix of Industrial, Rap, Fast
Reggae, and On-U sounds.  Heard Executive Slacks, a;Grumh..., Jah
Wobble, Eek A Mouse, PTV, etc. in the course of an hour or so.  The
DJ, Diego, is this jolly black guy who loves equal parts Homeboy house
music and Euro-industrial, and he also is the Music Director for
Emerson College's radio station.  There was a blurb about him/it in
the Globe Calendar section last Thursday.  He's a cool person, and
clubs like his basically don't exist (for the most part) out here, so
give him your support.  Plus, I met this lovely alluring sensual
oriental lass, and ... and ... *sigh* ...  :-)
