Here is the interview from the new Kate Bush Club newsletter.

Q. How is the new album going?

A. Well, as usual it is slow but I keep writing new songs as I feel the
   urge and I now have lots of songs but most of them have pieces missing
   or sparse lyrics and sorting these things out takes a lot of time.

Q. How are you approaching this album, is it different from the last one?

A. Again I am working straight onto master tape in out home studio, as I
   get ideas I put them onto tape.. sometimes this causes more problems
   because I'll like parts of it and not others but I try to re-do as little
   as possible.. I like to try and keep the performances quick and
   spontaneous, it's the sorting out of these performances afterwards
   and the rethinking of structure or arrangements that take the time.
   Each musician changes the feel of the track dramatically and it's
   important to keep the track moving in the right direction and to
   communicate what is wanted whic in my case is achieved through
   images, humming lines and letting the musicians do what they feel
   is right and saying if I don't like it.. it seems to have worked so
   far and I always find musicians so imspiring.  Quite often they'll
   put an edge to the track that gives it greater potential so I sit
   and rethink bits again.  The tracks continually change and yet the
   original "feeling" goesn't seem to.. I'd like to think that by
   putting the initial "muse" onto tape.. we've captured it's soul..
   so that whatever we put on top of it, it is in essence the same.

Q. Are you using a lot of synthesizers, if so, which ones and how?

A. I'm using the Fairlight again and a DX 7 but a lot of the songs
   have been written on piano initially and it does definitely give
   the songs a different flavour from those written on Fairlight.  A
   lot of rhythms are arranged by Del and we tend to keep bits and
   replace a lot with real drums.. but still keeping his "feel", but
   there are a few tracks which are just synthesized drums.. it's
   whatever works but I am using a lot of real instruments on this
   album.  I really like working with musicians, they approach things
   from a different angle.. they have fresh ideas.

Q. When will the album be finished?

A. Umm......

Q. When do you think it will be finished?

A. Umm......

Q. Have you been doing other projects besides the album?

A. I've been mainly concentrating on the album and catching up on my
   life a bit but I did write a song for a film by an American
   Director.. John Hughes.  The piece from the film is extremely
   moving an I really enjoyed writing to it.. Let's hope when the film
   is released (hopefully some time in '88) that you get to see it..
   the director has a very distinctive style (he directed "Breakfast
   Club" ..which I really like) and I think this, his lates film
   "She's Having A Baby" is well worth a watch.

Q. You also appeared at Peter Gabriel's live concert at Earls Court...

A. Yes, it was very much a last minute decision.. Peter had asked me
   and I wasn't sure if I was brave enough to perform unrehearsed in
   front of such a large crowd.. it is such a beautiful song to sing
   but the reception from the audience was overwhelming.. I couldn't
   hear what I was singing.. so if anyone reading this was there that
   night.. sorry if I was a bit out of tune and if you were one of
   those people.. thanks for an incredible experience, I don't think
   I'll ever forget that welcome.  It was a fantastic concert and I am
   again very honoured to have been involved in Peter's work.

Q. I know you like animals and I hear you keep cats.. I wondered how
   many you have?

A. I used to have 2 cats.. Zoodle and Pyewackit but I'm afraid that
   Zoodle died earlier this year.. I was very upset but she was
   eleven and had a good life.  She was a beautiful cat.  Pyewackit is
   absolutely fine although she missed Zoodle at first.  A few months
   ago we adopted a stray, feeding her and letting her live in the
   garage and she had 3 kittens.  We now have the 3 kittens, they are
   called Rocket, Sparky and Torchy and although Pye didn't like them
   all at first.. they all get on really well now and we find them
   cuddled up on a chair together when we get in.. they're such good
   company for her and they all have such different personalities..
   it's so entertaining just sitting watching them play.. it's bringing
   out the kitten in Pye, I've noticed her springing across the floor
   and leaping onto ledges that are far too small for her.. she does
   things she hasn't tried for years and seems to be enjoying it all.
   I guess we're all young at heart.. but sometimes it takes something
   to rediscover it!


Well, that's it.  Our own computer digest also gets a brief mention on the
letters page.  Bradley Whitehead in Australia mentioned us to them.

P.S. Hope the folks at the Kate Bush Club don't mind me deseminating this
info.
