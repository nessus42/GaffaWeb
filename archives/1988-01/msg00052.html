  Thanks to David Hardy for the posting about the "Kate Bush Orgy" on
WHRB" last Friday (Sept. 22).  I'm not a fanatic as you all are so I
was delighted to get to hear the non-album works.  (I have the
albums).  "My Lagan Love" was a revelation!  Why on earth doesn't she
do more like that?

      [	"My Lagan Love" was entirely done, including the writing of
	 the lyrics (by John Carder Bush -- the melody is
	 traditional), in a few hours.  I think Kate feels a song
	 doesn't merit being put on an album unless she spent a month
	 working on it.  -- |&gt;oug ]

I'd certainly buy an album consisting of such songs.  Also, the live
version of Cold Gun was different enough from the album to be really
interesting.

  As for the rest, I don't understand the reason for artists putting
out singles.  It seems like it must be a money decision.  By making a
slight variation on a song, the fanatics will have to buy it.  By
putting another non-album song on the other side the semi-fanatics
will have to buy it.  The rest of us, who like her in moderation,
never get to hear these new songs.  The only single I ever bought
contained "Under the Ivy" (one of my favorites) and I bought that one
mostly because of the cover picture.

      [	There's another reason: Kate puts songs that she thinks
	aren't good enough, or polished enough, or appriate enough for
	an album, but which she thinks some people might be interested
	in, nonetheless, on single B-sides.  It makes sense.  Why
	waste that B-side putting on something that's on the album
	anyway?  -- |&gt;oug ]

  The only complaint I have about the show was that they never said
what interviews they were playing excerpts from or when they were
done.  When she talked about specific songs, I assumed the interviews
were just after that album came out, but there were many generic
questions and no hint of when they were asked.  (except I assumed she
was younger when her voice sounded higher).  Did anyone recognize the
interviews?

      [	I think they were all from that serious of unofficial
	picture-disk interview records that are semi-widely available.
	-- |&gt;oug ]

  All in all a good evening.  Too bad I don't get that station with enough
signal strength to receive it in stereo.
