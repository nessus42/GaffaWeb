Some interesting facts about Kate Bush

o Kate Bush was a musical prodigy - her first album, "The Kick Inside",
  was recorded when she was only 4 years old.

o Kate is the shortest musician in Europe - a mere 18" tall!

o Although Kate has been popular in England, she was unable to get airplay
  in America due to the FCC's Minimum Hieght Regulations.  This law was
  made in 1942 to keep Japaneese off the airwaves, and was not overturned
  until 1986, which allowed Kate to get her first American hit single.

o Ms. Bush is in charge of all aspects of her live shows - From the choosing
  of the band members to the choreography to running the lighting board to
  being usher.

o Yes, Kate Bush *IS* related to Vice President George Bush.  However,
  George is the sole memeber of the Bush clan never to appear on any of
  Kate's albums.

o If you play the last line of "Leave it Open" backwards, you can distinctly
  hear Kate say "Paul has been dead for years."

o Kate is heavily influenced by liturature.  For example, "Wuthering Heights"
  is based on a novel by Harold Robbins.

o Film is another large influence for Kate. Example: "Hammer Horror" is an
  ode to American International Films.

o If you listen carefully to the second verse of the title track of "The
  Dreaming", you can hear Paul Hogan drinking a Foster's.

o The second side of "The Hounds of Love" is a concept piece about the
  endless arguments of pimply white males over which Kate album is better.

o Kate has been married for three years to Jerry Lee Lewis.

o Kate Bush, due to both her seasickness and her fear of flying, refuses
  to go to amusement parks.

o The album "The Kick Inside" was released with 517 different album cover
  designs.

o IED owns all of them.

o Last but not least, Kate is doing the soundtrack to a film by Nicholas
  Rogue, based on his very popular computer game.
