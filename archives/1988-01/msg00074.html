     |&gt;oug describes "My Lagan Love" as having been written
by one of Kate's brothers.  Is it not, then, the traditional
Irish song which begins

     "Where Lagan stream sings lullaby
     There blows a lily fair
     The twilight gleam is in her eye
     The night is on her hair"

?

     I remember learning this song from a big folk-song book
called _Songs of Man_ in the late 60s sometime.  I have never
heard Kate's version of it, but I had assumed that it was the
same song.  (I can give you most of the lyrics to all three
verses for further verification!)

      [	The melody of Kate's "My Lagan Love" is a traditional Irish
	folk song.  I believe that over the years many different
	lyrics have been sung with the tune.  Kate found out only
	shortly before she was to record "My Lagan Love" that the
	lyrics she had been planning to use, were not traditional, but
	rather were owned by someone.  She therefore got her brother
	John to throw together lyrics for the song (Kate probably
	isn't too good at throwing things together at a moment's
	notice).  John used to be a professional poet.  -- |&gt;oug ]


     On "The Morning Fog", Kate sings about telling her mother,
father, brothers, and loved one how much she loves them.  I
propose the following assignment of dedications to people of
the songs on the first side of _HoL_:

	"RUtH":		Paddy
	"HoL":		Del
	"The Big Sky":	JC
	"Mother":	Mother (!)
	"Cloudbusting":	Father

     I think this works quite well!  (With the possible exception
of "TBS", in which I can't see too much of a connection with JC.)
However, others may differ, or perhaps IED or some lesser authority
(such as Kate :-)) may have stated this before.

     BTW -- hello from the Old Country, from a Love-Hound who
recently moved from the west coast of Canada to the east coast
of Scotland (closer to the ONE TRUE LIGHT :-)).

p.s. RIP for my tape of _The Golden Age of Wireless_, which was
     discovered to have died last night.  When TMDR started singing
     in a bass voice on "Weightless" I regretfully concluded that
     the tape had stretched somehow!
