        SHE RECENTLY TOOK HER FIRST AIRBORNE FLIGHT TO GERMANY FOR A 
TELEVISION APPEARANCE, AS THE SINGLE, APPARENTLY, HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS 
WHATEVER THE GERMAN EQUIVALENT OF "PICK-OF-THE-WEEK" MIGHT BE. 
        It was mind-boggling, SHE SAID EUPHORICALLY, IN REFERENCE TO 
FLYING.  I really want to do more of that...  WONDER HOW SHE'LL FEEL 
ABOUT IT IN TWO YEARS TIME.   (1978, The Blossoming Ms. Bush)
 
        I think people have got the impression that I am carried on to 
a plane screaming, at the moment, and have to be knocked out so that I 
can cope with the journey.  I don't like flying, but it's really not 
that bad, and I do fly if I have to.  If there is another way of 
travelling, I quite often prefer to go that way; but if you have to fly 
and it's the quickest way to get somewhere, then I do.  (????, ?????)


        WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN LAS VEGAS?  THAT'S AN UNUSUAL PLACE TO 
VISIT?
        I was there with a guy from the record company just for a
day, and it was really just an opportunity to see the place while
he had business matters to deal with.  It is an extraordinary place.  
Instead of saying "How you doing?", everyone says, "Feeling lucky?"  
It's like a strange oasis stuck right in the middle of the desert away 
from everything.  We took a flight in a small plane over the Grand 
Canyon, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences I've ever 
had.  The Canyon is totally enormous, and we were so tiny - I've never 
experienced that kind of vertigo before or since, and with all the air 
pockets, we went up and down, up and down.   (1987, KBC 21)


        THEY SAY ABOUT YOU ALSO THAT ALTHOUGH YOU'VE BEEN SELLING 
REALLY WELL IN ENGLAND FOR SEVEN YEARS OR MORE, YOUR EXPOSURE HERE WAS 
ALMOST NON-EXISTENT.  AND PART OF IT WAS THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE 
TO FLY, YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE TO GRANT INTERVIEWS, SO THEY COMPENSATED 
A LITTLE BIT BY BOOKING YOU ON THE QE2.  WHAT HAPPENED THEN? 
        Um, that trip was canceled.  As far as I know the boat just 
didn't make it that year. [THEY BOTH LAUGH].
        MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. 
        But I don't think that anything has actually prevented me from 
coming to America.  It's not that I haven't wanted to, and although I 
haven't flown for the last couple years, it hasn't stopped me going 
anywhere.  And I'm here now! 
        YES, I FIND IT PHENOMENAL THAT ALTHOUGH YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO 
MAKE IT HERE FOR THAT TOUR BECAUSE THE FEAR OF FLYING OR THE DISLIKE OF 
FLYING AND THEN THE QE2 HAS MECHANICAL PROBLEMS AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT 
OVER HERE.  BUT YOU SENT A VIDEO TAPE, A ONE HOUR VIDEO TAPE.  AND TELL 
ME WHAT THAT DID FOR YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR CAREER HERE. 
        Are you talking about the tape of the show...
        THE ONE HOUR TAPE THAT YOU SENT OVER HERE IN LEU OF THE TOUR 
THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.
        Well that tour was actually in '79.  And it's not something 
that I personally sent over, I think it was very much something that 
the record company were doing, hoping that that would sort of get some 
interest in the music.  And I think the tour is something that did 
generate a lot of interest in people and the video of the tour is not 
as good, I don't feel, as actually having seen the show.  But people 
seem to like it.   (1985, Live At Five)
