&gt;special reason.  Long before the release of the album, even
&gt;before the promo tapes arrived at US radio stations, Love Hound
&gt;extraordinaire Larry Hernandez (L-H) phoned long distance and
&gt;played HWD for me from a horrible recording on his telephone
&gt;answering machine.  (How it ended up there at that time isn't
&gt;mine to tell.)  A most powerful experience, that being my first
&gt;KonTact with the album we'd all been anticipating for years.

&gt;Maybe that's why the hissy, muddy sound of that song doesn't
&gt;faze me.  Whenever I hear it, I hear that original faint version
&gt;over the phone lines, one of the best things I'd heard in years.

That's funny, and familiar too. Many of us first heard the song
"The Sensual World" for the first time by calling a phone number
set up by EMI Canada and hearing "Hi, this is Kate Bush and this
is The Sensual World." Then the song played (but faded out before
the ending) and you heard a beeeeeeep. This was before the single
was even released. A lot of people spent a lot of money to hear
the song over and over. I even called the number when I was live
on the air and aired the song/message. I think I can safely say
that I was the first DJ in North America to play the song on the
radio....:-)

That was before we were on the net, but had contacts through
IED &amp; Ed. We put "deeper Understanding" on our answering machine
and IED posted out phone number. We got a lot of calls, and I
still have those tapes.

ps, hey Steve, talk abounds in Ecto about Ingrid Karklins. Write up a
story and send it along.....ecto@ns1.rutgers.edu
