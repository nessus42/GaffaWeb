Saurav Misra sez...
&gt;re the recent thread about Kate and comic books...
&gt;I remember someone posting about a connection between Tori Amos and
&gt;Neil Gaiman, writer of THE BEST COMIC SINCE MOEBIOUS' ARZAH....
&gt;namely, The SANDMAN. Oops, I'm sounding too fanatic...
&gt;anyway, whoever that was, could you reiterate? Danke!

    Could this have been my post of loooong ago? I don't know how they came to 
meet up exactly but Tori has got to know Neil Gaiman well. In her own words she 
"tries to catch up with him for a lunch or dinner whenever we're on the same 
continent". Like anybody else who reads the Sandman series (it'll be coming to 
an end soon :-( ) she was taken with it. I think that sitting down with Neil 
Gaiman for a meal would be fasinating since the guy can engage/enthral you in a 
conversation on ANY topic. Anyway, if you'r a Toriophile then you'll know that 
she mentions him and the Dream King (Sandman) in the song 'Tear on Your Hand'. 
He paid her back for this complement in issue #41 of Sandman by writing in her 
music into the background of a bar scene and saying hi to her in the letter 
column page later on.

    Also it is rumoured that the character Delerium of the same comic is based 
around Tori. Neil had already scripted Delerium before he ever met Tori but 
since they met the character has been changing. Except for the fact the Delerium 
normally has blond hair and Tori normally has red they are starting to look more 
and more alike. I asked Neil about this one I met him in June this year and he 
confermed that early Delerium had nothing to do with Tori BUT said we'd have to 
make up our own minds with the current version. A sort of "I can't conferm nor 
deny that" answer... 

    That do? Oh, don't forget that the Death mini-seris, "The high cost of 
living" will be out soon as well.
