1992 Innocence Mission Poll is now going on. Last year we did it, and the
results were pretty amazing. I'll post those results at the end of this
message.

Anyhow, for this year's poll, things will be a bit different, but not by much.
For starters, instead of having a poll for just both LP's and the overall
ratings, we are also adding a non-lp chart. So 4 ratings this year.

Here's how we are going to do it. Send in a list via post to gaffa or
email to me at : mus0eka@cabell.vcu.edu with your list of all the IM
songs you've ever heard. Including non-lp songs, in the order that you
like them the best. Just one list. #1 will get 100 points, #2 99 and so
on. Then I'll separate them into their sub-categories and rate them accordingly.
For example:

#1 And Hiding Away
#2 Curious
#3 Beginning The World

 would end up...

Umbrella                 Debut                 Overall
100 - And Hiding Away    100 Curious           100 - And Hiding Away
99  - Beginning TheWorld ---                   99  - Curious
					       98  - Beginning THe World

etc...

so...that's how it works. So send in your lists...Non-Lp songs do NOT
constitute covers. For example, do not rate: "Both Sides Now," "Birds,"
"Running Away." "I Need Thee." If there are any others I'll let ya know.

"Shadows" is an IM song despite Amy Grant singing it, so do rate that song
if you wish since there is a recording of it. IM songs that were not recorded
by IM but other artists do not count either. Such as "I Belong" and "Don't
Face The World Alone."

That's it...
here's last years list.

Innocence Mission TOP 10 LISTS!
 
Voting: Each person submits a Top 10 List of Overall songs comprised
        from both LPs. The #1 song receives 10 points. the #2 song
        receives 9 points, etc..for scoring on the OVERALL List. The
        Innocence Mission and Umbrella Lists are scored by their
        location. So if perhaps "And Hiding Away" is #3 on the overall
        list, but #1 on Umbrella, then it scores 10 points on the
        Umbrella List. When ties occur, the one with the MOST votes
        wins (ex. 28.5 had "5" voters vote for that song, and 28.4 had
        "4" voters vote for that song).
 
        You may CHANGE your LIST at anytime. Just submit it to me.
