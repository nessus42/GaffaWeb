Hey, Kyle, now THAT's the spirit!

&gt; From: kyle@CS.UCLA.EDU

&gt; OK, I have a question for you, which is a more versitile instrument?

&gt;	a) a guitar
&gt;	b) a drum

What kind of guitar and what kind of drum?  For the typical cases, a
guitar is a more versatile instrument, in that you can use a guitar as
a drum, but not vice versa.  However, for most purposes, a drum is
much more suitable as a drum than a guitar is, so this doesn't mean we
should get rid of drums!

&gt; The answer in my opinion is very dependent on what one values in an
&gt; instrument and one's personal cultural experiences.

No, it isn't.  A guitar is capable of making a wider range of sounds
than a drum is.

&gt; Are you going to tell me that the only valid way to evaluate these
&gt; instruments/voices is relative to Classical European culture?  Take
&gt; a few moments to consider before you answer.

&gt; Now, think about Kate VS. Elvis.

Well, this is a pretty strange analogy, since Elvis C's music is much
more closely secured to western music than Kate's is.

&gt; My point is that they are entirely different instruments and such
&gt; direct comparisons do not prove anything.  In addition, I would say
&gt; that you have been taught to think of a violin as a "better"
&gt; instrument than a "banjo".  AN insturment (or voice) should NOT be
&gt; judged only in relation to its application to Classical Music.

Well, *I'd* never say a violin is a *better* instrument than a banjo
for all purposes.  But it *is* a more versatile instrument.  i.e. If
stranded on a desert island and I could only have one instrument, I'd
take a voilin, because with a violin I could make a wider range of
sounds.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy, I'll have to agree with you here.  One should not listen to
&gt;&gt;&gt; her music with expectations, but rather with reservations.

&gt;&gt; And why's that Kyle?

&gt; Because I find her voice quite annoying at times!

That's your hangup.

&gt; From: wicinski &lt;wicinski@nrl-css.arpa&gt;

&gt; ya know what - I heard that throwing muses demo tape awhile ago ,
&gt; and liked it to no end.  but i heard the album yesterday and i
&gt; really hated it.  real bad.  too bad.

Well, Wicinski, this is conclusive proof of your continuing
degeneration.  Throwing Muses album is only slightly different than
their demo tape.  A while back you had good taste, and now it's gone,
gone, gone...
