Re: Mark Grossman's "new hounds" posting

&gt; So, 1st question:  does anybody have a catalog no. for The Single File?

Another question that is answered in the inside cover of The Whole Story.
What was it, Doug, KBS1, or something like that? Can't remember off-hand.

&gt; Does anyone else out there think as I do that she peaked on
&gt; The Dreaming and that (the videos of) her old stage shows were
&gt; embarassing?

You use the term "think" very creatively...
As to the first opinion, yes, Douglas does. He has, however, been
shown in myriad past discussions the error of his reasoning on this
and other vital points. Regarding your second comment, see Patrick
Swales's interview with Kate, Del and Paddy, finally published in
unabridged form in the latest issue of Break-Through.
Swales described to Kate feelings similar to your own
about her style of stage performance, and Kate answered him
far more effectively than IED can answer you. Let him merely aver that
in his opinion nearly all of Kate Bush's creative output, whether on
stage or on record or on film, can be "embarassing," but why is this
bad? IED believes that the nakedness of Kate's kind of artistic
expression often makes the experience of the spectator/listener/viewer
an excruciating one. That is a large part of what makes her art as
powerful as it is. Whether embarassing or not, however, nothing that
Kate ever did on the stage was without artistic motive, and every
movement was born of the sincerest and richest aesthetic impulse.
