ERRATUM:

IED recently reported that there was no
sign of an imminent Kate Bush video release
in the United States. This was false.
The video version of "The Whole Story"
WILL be released domestically, on NTSC
Beta and VHS, in January 1987 by MGM/UA
Home Video. Not sure yet about a possible
laser disc version. This information was
part of yet another full page advertisement
for "The Whole Story", this time in the latest
issue of Optic Music, the music video trade publication.

Music Plus, a big hit-music and video retail chain in
California (and elsewhere), is airing a radio commercial on
KROQ advertising "The Whole Story" and nothing but
"The Whole Story", featuring extracts from "Running
Up That Hill" and "Experiment IV".

For any Kate fan planning to buy any of the recent
bootleg LPs that are now turning up in numbers in
independent record stores throughout the country,
be forewarned that there is nothing new in any of them.
"A Bird in the Hand" is nothing except a poor quality
mono transfer of the audio portion from nine of the twelve
songs performed by Kate in "Kate Live at the Hammersmith Odeon".
The three-record set known as "Kate Bush Live in Europe 79 - 80"
consists of: 1.) a true stereo transfer to vinyl of the whole
of "Live at Hammersmith Odeon"; 2.) a transfer of the television
sound track from Kate's 1979 Christmas special (the same TV-hum-filled
audio track heard on the various video copies), which originally
appeared along with 1.) as a two-record set called "Wow"; and 3.) a copy
of part of a 1979 Paris concert, which previously appeared in 1984 as a
single bootleg LP, purportedly by the (non-existent) Kate Bush Club of
Taiwan. All of these records were pressed by the same bunch of people,
under several label pseudonyms, most often "Rock Solid Records" and
"International Records" of New York.

For the interest of Japan fans, "Quiet Life" was
finally released on CD in Japan (November 21).
If it shows up here, expect to pay anywhere from
$21 to $36 for a copy -- the new Riuichi Sakamoto
single live CD "New Media Bahn" appeared here
recently at $36 a pop, all because of the dollar-to-yen
ratio. New Japanese vinyl releases now go for $21.00 at Tower.

For the interest of Peter Gabriel enthusiasts, "PG Plays Live"
has now been re-released here on CD, this time as a 2-CD set,
in order to include the two or three tracks that were
excised from the original CD -- so think of it as costing
an extra $13-15 for a couple of extra live songs.
