Pterodactyls at the Brewery

Well I saw Birdsongs of the Mesozoic in Raleigh, NC the other night.  A
truly amazing show and quite a relief from the jangly, guitar bands that
are so prevalent in this area.  The sound quality in the club was good
and the band members were up for a good show.  Birdsongs, for anyone who
doesn't know, consists of an electric pianist, guitarist, and two
synthesists with everyone playing percussion (acoustic &amp; electronic) at
some time or another.  A lot of the pieces were high intensity and
demanded you're entire attention.  Maybe this could be called industrial
chamber music.  I could have sworn they were heavily influenced by very
early Kraftwerk (meaning a double album import I have - not the
techno-pop they're famous for), but the guitarist had never heard of the
early Kraftwerk.  He mentioned Fripp and Frith as influences.  Their
songlist included Shiney Golden Snakes, Ptoccata, Theme from Rocky &amp;
Bullwinkle, Final Motiff, Lost in the B-Zone, Excavation No. 32, The
Beat of the Mesozoic Part I, and Scenes From a...  Some Ace of Hearts
promo man was there selling records.  He knew Doug Alan as "that guy who
thinks Kate Bush is God".  I didn't bother to explain to him why she is.

Hello Subs

When I saw the spelling of the German phrase in the Ninth Wave here in
gaffa it didn't look quite right to me.  A friend listened to the album
for me and translated the following:
                    ~            ~
Tiefer, tiefer, ergrund[en,st?] fur nach tiefer. Hinter ist ein Licht.
Deeper, deeper, sound (dive) still deeper. Behind is a light.
