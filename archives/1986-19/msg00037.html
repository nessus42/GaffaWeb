&gt; [Mark Grossman:] I was hoping for the singles... what a shame.

Well, you still may be able to pick one up at a used record store or
at a record convention.  The catalog number, like Andy said, is KBS 1
on EMI Records (England).

&gt; [*Hounds of Love*] just doesn't quite have the kick inside, the
&gt; whiplash mise-en-scene of the all-holy Dreaming.  Maybe her
&gt; adolescent _weltschmertz_ is burning off?

Probably.  What's *weltschmertz*?

Regarding *Kate Bush Live at the Hammersmith Odeon* ...

&gt; But the staging was SO self-indulgent...  kind of like a 6th
&gt; grader's R&amp;R fantasy of the school play.  I could see the effort
&gt; that went into it, but it just made me blush.

Maybe, but that's one of the things that's so wonderful about the
concert.  It really is unique.  It's true that there's a fine line
between perfection and sillyness, and at this time Kate was still a
developing talent, zigging back and forth through both regions, but
over all, the amount of inspiration totally dwarfs everything else.

Also, I'm not sure if "self-indulgent" is really the word you are
looking for.  In the U.S., perhaps such a show would have been
self-indulgent.  British culture is apparently a bit different,
however.  Her concerts were incredible successes.  Everyone loved
them.  This concert tour was the first time that many people started
to take Kate seriously.

&gt; Maybe the later video is different... I haven't seen it.

Well, yes of course.  The *Singles File* contains videos for the first
five years of Kate's career, while the concert tape only represents
the first two.  The videos that are from the same era as the concert
tape are rather similar.  The videos from *Never for Ever* and *The
Dreaming* are much different and progressively more mature.
