First a reply to John hogge:
&gt;Like I've said before, I don't know much about the punk/hardcore groups.  If
&gt;you know of any good groups treading similar ground to say Scratch Acid, Uzi, 
&gt;Phantom Tollbooth, I'd appreciate hearing about them.  (Or is everyone off
&gt;studying for finals?  Geez, what geeks...)

You may want to check out the Prevaricators, a group from Richmond - their
latest album, Detente, is a good start - about the best blending of sax I've
ever heard with this type of genre.

Also, just about everything I read this weekend had a rave about Antetiem but
I've never heard anything by them, so don't take my word...

Christmas/The Pontiacs Brothers at the 8x10 Club in Baltimore.

So, this was well worth missing Ruin for - Christmas is yet another enigmatic
band that plays undercover thrash.  Don't know how they ever got booked
at this normally blase' joint (well, they did have the Lyres here a coupla
months ago) but who was I to argue with good taste?  Personally, I hadn't
really toked up totally to this Christmas album, had a tape copy and I 
don't know, never really got a chance to listen to it - My loss, as they proved
themselves live even though the audience smelled bad, (the bassist comments
after one song: "Okay, you've had your fun, now it's back to the frat house")
They mix some pretty harmonies (a la It's a Beautiful Day) with well-rehearsed 
dynamics and about two zillion geetar hooks to come up with the best
country thrash that Tex and Chris D. could never do - despite how many
bottles of Jack they drank for the Divine Horseman album.  Talked to Liz, the
drummer, afterwards and she told me all creations were the product of
Mike Cudahy's insane and absurd attitude (remember that the holiday, Christmas 
got it's roots in the celebration of the 10 days left in the solar year after 
the lunar year where all rules were dispensed with) but I think she was under-
selling her and Dan the bassist's peculiar contributions - either that or
Cudahy has a fine future in front of him producing bands if he can
exploit other people's talent to such a fine extent.  Tried to rip off
the glossy promo picture for a friend but the stoned out bar owner caught
me and I had to do some pretty fast talking.

(went outside to grab a "pit beef" sandwich which are sold out on the
street - with the slab of beef just sitting in the hot coals ... mmm, 
mmm, good)

The Pontiacs played a bit longer and to wider recognition.  Ol' Ward Dotson
pretty much kept mum except for the occasional improvs he'd throw into
songs all of a sudden usually suprising the rest of the band.  The singer,
Matt, formerly of Middle Class, has really upped his stage prescense (sic)
to make up for his unspectacular vox.  Best cover of the night was their
version of the Grateful Dead's "Brown Eyed Woman" and the best original
was "Doll Hut" off their new album (not the one called "Doll Hut") with
the gnarly, sixtieish art-deco cover (even has the little arrow that says
"stereophonic sound" like on your Mom's Kingston Trio recs). In case
you're unfamilar with the Pontiacs sound, suffice to say it ranges
from The Band to the Rolling Stones to The Gun Club to modern day hardcore.
The best "roots" band I've ever seen - mainly since they aren't apeing Elvis -
they are rewriting Elvis.

P.S. I'VE GOT A BOOT, SHHHH... AND LOTS OF PIX.

New Offense Newsletter is out with a in-depth interview with Ivo of 
England's 4 A.D. label - a must for all fans.  Also, an interview with
Crime And The City Solution as well as scads and scads of record reviews.
And of course, we can't forget the "abrasive" letters (not rec. for
NME readers) from the normal cast of characters.  3$ (and well worth it)
to The Offense Newsletter, P.O.Box 12614, Columbus, Ohio, 43212... ask for
#70 and tell him Jim Slime sent you.  He'll understand.

Hey, Earle, are we supposed to believe that Skinny Preppy and Severed 
Synths are rock bands or what?

number?
