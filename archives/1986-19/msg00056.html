Hi folks,
	I'm new to the list and have a review to present to you...

	Some of you out there may know Greg Earle.  Well I went and checked out
his club (Club NichtoPhobia) this past Saturday night and well it SUCKED!!
How many ways did this club suck??  Let me tell you....

	1. The sound was awful!   Took these guys half the night to get the
	   tunes going, and they never did get it quite right.

	2. Art Wimp Fags, Trendies, and Wavos!
	   Looks like Trainor and I were the only ones who hadn't burnt out
	   on some "art" scene.  Must every "scenester" were black?

	3. Boring Boring Boring...
	   Just about everyone there was over 25.  Which of course means that
	   everyone there is an intellectual faggot!  I mean they listened to
	   the Music like it was "good" or something.

	4. If your going to play disco...
	   Don't play that "soulfull" depresed white people trying to be
	   black shit!  I'm tired of hearing "Trendoid's in black" performing
	   Black people's music.  If you wanna play Black music play some
	   "Funk", "Hip Hop", or "GoGo"!

	5. No HARDCORE??!!
	   I asked Greg Baby to put on some HardCore, But NOooo....  I guess
	   this crowd was too stoned/Old to understand a little Energy.

	6. Greg Earle
	   So whats the story bud?  You guys just wimps or what?  How about
	   getting some "real" bands to play, rather than some fools with
	   a flute, who sound like they been playing together for 2 or 3
	   days.

	In closing I would like to say that Peace is happiness, Love is war,
and Donations to the Fund for Kyle will be accepted.

Joe Slime
