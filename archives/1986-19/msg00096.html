The latest issue of Homeground (No. 25) has come out,
and, in IED's humble opinion, it marks a new level of efficiency
on its editors' part. Homeground, for those who don't already know,
is the oldest and most in-the-know of all the Kate
Bush-related fanzines. It is published in Kent by
a group of dedicated longtime fans of Kate who have
earned her trust over the years, with the effect that
they appear in her promotional films (their latest is
"Experiment IV") and organize her official conventions
and video parties with her.

Homeground No. 25 tells the story of the making of
the film for "Experiment IV", and includes a full and
well organized listing of articles, reviews and television
appearances about or by Kate during the past couple of months.
There is also a new episode of "Kosmic Kate" by Steve the Duck;
a fascinating little piece of investigative journalism a la
"Sixty Minutes" which exposes a recent sleazy KT bootleg merchandising
scheme conducted by Homeground's British Johnnie-come-lately
competitor, Under the Ivy; a description of the recent video-party
which Kate co-hosted (along with Homeground) for four hundred
fans last month, together with a couple of photos; and the usual
news, swaps and letters pages. Altogether a far more level-headed
and low-key KT zine than Break-Through, despite the many fine points
of the latter.

And if you're reading this and thinking, "What is the big deal
with this Kate Bush adulation?", FIND OUT! If you're thinking,
"Why doesn't IED type out the whole magazine, I can't get
enough!" then now's your chance to put your money where your
love of Kate is! Homeground is now available
from import distributors to magazine stands and
record stores throughout the U.S.A., so tell your neighborhood
shopkeepers to start carrying it! If you live in the Los Angeles
area, check Rene's, Poo-Bah's and Moby Disc Records; they have all
had copies in regularly this year.
