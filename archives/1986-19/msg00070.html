     The following message was sent to our radio station (WMUA Amherst).  It
outlines a very real threat to the availability in this country of live
performances by international musicians who are not mega-stars, and even
some who are.  Feel free to post it on any pertinent forum - the only way
to stop this from happening is to let people know about it so that they can
in turn voice their opinion.  No author was credited for the message.

     Over the past few years, many of us have been disappointed on occasion
when performers from other countries have had to postpone or cancel concerts
because they were arbitrarily denied the H-1 permits they needed to work in
America.  Recently-proposed regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service could make this a more frequent occurrence, and therefore could have a
significant impact on the types of live music available to us in this country.

     In the August 8 "Federal Register", the Department of Justice's
Immigration and Naturalization Service proposed new regulations governing the
granting of H-1 permits to members of the entertainment industry.  This
proposal would require that performers seeking admittance to this country
demonstrate their "preeminance" either by having sustained international or
national acclaim, or by being recognized by experts in the entertainment
industry for excellence in a unique performing art, be sponsored by a
non-profit organization, and be coming to this country for one period per year
of 60 days or less.

     To be considered preeminent, a performer will have to present evidence
that he or she :

     --has performed and will perform as a star or featured entertainer
       in a major production.

     --has achieved national or international acclaim, as evidenced by
       reviews in major publications.

     --has appeared in establishments which have a distinguished
       reputation.

     --has achieved extensive commercial success.

     --has recieved recognition from organizations, recognized critics
       or other experts in the field.

     --has commanded and now commands a high salary or other
       remuneration for performances.

     Obviously, these regulations could have a significant impact on what kinds
of live performances are available to us in the future.  It is easy to see that
many performers will be hard pressed to demonstrate that they have achieved
commercial success, or to prove that they earn high salaries when compared to
performers in other fields.  It is also apparent that it will be difficult for
performers to build a significant American following, and survive economically
while doing so, when restricted to a single U.S. visit of 60 days or less per
year, under the sponsorship of a non-profit organization.

     If you feel strongly about maintaining the environment of cultural
exchange which has been growing over the past few years, and about preserving
your right to choose the kind of live music available to you, please write
TODAY to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, address below, and to your
Senators, letting them know how you feel about this issue.  We have all been
fortunate to have experienced the music of other lands and cultures through
visits from traveling musicians.  It is essential that we act now to assure
that this free exchance of music will continue.

     Comments should be addressed to :
          Loretta J. Shogren, Director
          Policy Directives and Instructions
          Immigration and Naturalization Service
          425 Eye Street, NW
          Washington, DC
          20536

     Please let people know about this!
