Well, Nancy, Doug has already posted a strong
and effective answer to your question, but
IED's opinion is slightly different. There may
be some KT fans who originally disliked her
voice, but not many. Certainly alot of first
time listeners are "shocked" by it -- and,
as in Doug's case, they are likely to be
shocked at least twice, once by the late
sound, once by the early sound -- but for
the most part, the ones who remain KT fans
are people who LIKE the shock of the new.
If their reaction to the power of Kate's
vocal style is initially a sort of contemptuous
dislike, it is highly unlikely that they
will ever really come around to the see the light.
It is also no great loss to the rest of us, since,
as Doug says, they probably prefer music that conforms
to the worst conventions of pop.
To IED's ears, at least, the sound of Kate's voice
on "Under the Ivy" is the most profoundly beautiful sound
ever created. This is a good test song: if your friend
doesn't respond in a positive way to her voice on that
track, you might as well give up.
IED has been regularly presenting Kate's music to
a friend of his (yes, he does have one)
for nine years now, and although he doesn't actively
dislike it, he has never heard in it what IED hears.
Alot of people are just beyond hope.

There is an actual still photo from the film for
"Experiment IV" in the Dec. 13 issue of "Smash Hits"
(or was it "No. 1"?). Kate's hair is blonde.
Several British comedians are said to appear in
the film, along with Del and Paddy.

-- Andrew
