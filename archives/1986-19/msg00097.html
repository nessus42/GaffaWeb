This is my virgin posting to Love-Hounds.  Hope I sent this to the right
place.

There were many good independent record releases this year. Of these, there
were some great compilations of indie material.

Sub Pop 100 - this is the best compilation that I've ever heard.  The person
who put this together really knows how to arrange music.  This album flows
so smoothly, even when the music gets rough and raw.  It features tunes by
Scratch Acid, Sonic Youth, Naked Raygun, Skinny Puppy and Savage Republic.
It's a successful mix of hardcore and industrial sounds.  If you can't find
this album at your favorite record store, it's available by mail order for
$7.  (I don't have the address with me now.)  BTW, the Skinny Puppy song here
is the only song I like by those thin creatures (think that "Bites" is awful).

NME C86 - this is a good collection of new indie music from England.  There
are 22 songs by 22 different bands on this single LP.  The only problem is 
that all are guitar pop bands.  And it does get somewhat monotonous with the 
lack of variety.  But, all in all, it is a good exposure to the indie scene in
England.  Highlights are songs by Mighty Lemon Drops, Soup Dragons, The Wolf-
hounds, Shop Assistants, Half-Man Half-Biscuit, We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're
gonna use it, The Wedding Present.  (Sue T. - I think you'd like this album)
The Wolfhounds are my favorite band on this album.  Check out their "Anti-Midas
Touch" EP.  The music is similar to The Fall but crisper and cleaner.  Also 
much more thoughtful and intelligent than The Fall (it's not hard to beat The 
Fall in that department!).  There are five songs on the EP and about that many 
styles explored.

Pay it all back, Vol I - a collection of music from the On-U Sound label.
I remember a discussion many months ago about Adrian Sherwood and his output.
Well, here is a compilation of material from his pet record company and I 
believe Adrian Sherwood produced everything on it.  About half of the album
is heavily produced reggae, which I don't find too exciting.  There are a
couple of pieces by Mark Stewart &amp; his Maffia to keep things interesting 
though.  There is also an instrumental here by a group called African Head
Charge which could fit perfectly on the new SPK album.  Best part about this
album, it is VERY cheap.  I got it for 3 or 4 pesos.

Some non-compilation records I've enjoyed this year:  
	That Petrol Emotion "Manic Pop Thrill" LP (guitar pop but not wimpy)
	Wolfgang Press "Standing Up Press" LP
	Savage Republic "Ceremonial" LP
	In The Nursery "Twins" LP (thanks Greg E. for the tip) 
	Ciccone Youth "Burnin' Up/Into the Groovy" 7" (avail. on 12" now)
