Well, in the past couple of weeks, I've gotten over two dozen
pieces of e-mail from people wanting me to return to this list.
What can I say?  I'm eternally grateful for your words of support
and I've decided to come back.  A little tentatively, maybe, but
from now on I'll just turn the other cheek and be stronger for it.
Besides, I'm getting abuse in rec.music.misc now too :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I listened to the CD of "The Whole Story" over the weekend, and
found it very strange to hear those familiar songs out of context!
Can I ever get used to hearing "Babooshka" by itself, without
fading gracefully into "Delius"?  A nice package, and undeniably
great music, but I think I'll leave this one to the Kate-novices
and stick to my beloved LPs (and CDs)...

My latest record acquisitions:
The Fall, "Hey Luciani" 12" -- so hummable, so pop!  Brix Smith
continues on her campaign to make the Fall more 'mersh, and as
usual, the result is VERY pleasant listening.  More power to her.

The Close Lobsters, new EP -- "Fey," he said.  "I *like* fey
music," I said.  More pure pop for now people; if you like
the Pastels, Talulah Gosh, Mighty Mighty, etc., why not?

Clan of Xymox, new LP -- Just picked the thing up, and I've only
had the chance to listen to side one.  The jury's still out,
therefore, but it doesn't seem to have the punch of album #1
(when they were, I believe, just plain "Xymox.")

Duran Duran, "Notorious" LP -- Will you all scoff at me if I say
that this is totally brill?  The CD's all digital and sounds
fabulous.  It's funky, it's happening, Simon LeBon has learned
to sing.  Take my word for it.

Swiss Chamber Orchestra, Grieg's "Holberg Suite" and "2 Elegiac
Melodies" -- Heartbreakingly beautiful.  Conjures up all the
moods of my beloved Scandinavia.

Robert Cray, "Strong Persuader" LP -- "Blues, feh," I said.  "I
don't *like* the blues."  Then I heard this album.  It's a truly
exciting piece o'vinyl, more pop/rock than blues really, and Cray
has a smooth and wonderful voice.  Call your favorite alternative
station and request "I Guess I Showed Her."  You'll be persuaded too.

A Certain Ratio, "Force" LP -- If you have any recent ACR records,
you know what to expect.  Tightly played British whiteboy funk,
that is.  My father (who's in his early 50s) borrowed it and
thought it was very cool.  Don't let the fact that he also thinks
Bananarama and the Pet Shop Boys are the tops dissuade you from
checking it out.

Does anybody out there have the new 400 Blows record?  How about
We've Got A Fuzzbox's "Bostin' Steve Austin"?  (Who he, anyway?)
Enquiring minds want to know!

Tara,
-Sue

ps. To dsc: Please write again and send a uucp address so I can reply!
