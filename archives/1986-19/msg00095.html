so beware.

reviews of shit I've bought weeks ago, but have been stuck since our
machines are flaked out on too much intellectualizing...

Big Black - The Hammer Party

If you really want to find out what BB is all about get this. re release
of first two eps, Lungs and Bulldozer.  better than atomizer in parts.
shows what can be done on a four track.

Killdozer - Burl

Jim and John are on target - these guys will be trendy on the wavo 
music circuit in the upcoming months.  this is hot. kicks british
death rockers herion-sodden-asses back to england. buy and die. 
another cool thing to come from Madison.

Frank Zappa - Jazz from Hell

what can you do with a synclavier is what this should be called.  not
bad, good zappa, reminds me of 1986 meeting Uncle Meat or Burnt Weeny
Sandwhich. 

Membrabes - Songs of wank 

For some reason, Cosley screwed up at Homestead and signed some English
haircut band.  it sucks.  I'm not even going to review it i find it so
boring. 

Peter Gabriel - Big Time 12"

good, cool extended mix.  not too much added, just the usual sythn mix.
flip side has special mix of in your eyes in case your missed the 7"

Kraftwerk - Musique Non Stop 12"

cool diggable tune, but I'm waiting for their Japenese versions of songs
(ala Computerworld). 

Eugune Chadbourne - Corpses of Foreign Wars

great stuff, with help from some of da dude from Violent Femmes. Great
anti-war covers and originals.  Someone already grabbed it from my
collection so I can't remember too much.

Kate Bush - The Hole Story

I give a C+ for being a good intro, and allows people to get two cuts
from the Dreaming on CD.  I guess if you own one.  still I don't like
the songs are laid out on the album, I prefer each individual album to
the compilation.

Egg Hunt - We all Fall Down 7"

Rock and Roll Dischord Style. What every stoned out wavo with black
clothes should own.

The Bridage - Dividing line

Boring. Real Boring

advice of the year: buy big black, butthole surfers, killdozer, and
poison idea. distrust all bands from england.

ya know what - I heard that throwing muses demo tape awhile ago , and
liked it to no end.  but i heard the album yesterday and i really hated
it.  real bad.  too bad. 

for a GREAT AMERICAN femal band, check out Scrawl from Columbus. on a
few compilation tapes with Great Plains, Gibson Bros (featuring Chet
Howland, newest Schpin writer), Drak Arts, and RC MOB.

doug sezs he's getting the dickhead fan mail, which is ultra cool and
super bad since we will be meeting in a beltsville bar.  I will then
drug him and brainwash the poor boy.  then kyle will take over as the
next Hitler (you listening bro?)

and not ONE single mention about the rag lady....
