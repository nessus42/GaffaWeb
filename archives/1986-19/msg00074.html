Here's the latest message from my reluctant friend.  He enjoys reading the
responses everyone has been sending.  Maybe I can talk him into joining the
list, and he can respond directly.

From:     Kevin C
Subject:  Responses re Kate

Dear Kate,

I heard from a few of your fans.  It is amazing how extreme a fan or two can
get, especially those who don't seem to know anything about creativity
first-hand.  They make me recall Nietzsche, who said something to the effect:
"There are always members of a party who are so extreme that they make others
lose faith in the cause..." (Friedrich said it better than I'm remembering).

Anyway, you've got quite an enthusiastic fan club, Katey dear.

The first one I heard from was IUD, who referred to himself only in the third
person, and whose response was somewhat off the wall -- I wanted to know why I
should fall in love with you, my sweet siren, and he simply provided a paean
of his own adoration.  I suppose: "Those who can't, preach".

I also heard from a person named |&gt;oug, who is also ardently vying with me for
your affection.  I think he actually understands his own response to you a
bit, and that's nice.  He was supportive to my cause (fool that I was to wear
my heart out on my sleeve, and that for a songstress whose voice I didn't even
quite like yet!) This lad quoted Harlan Ellison wittily in your defense, for
reasons that were extraordinarily obscure to me until I remembered that
"LoveHounds" is a mailing list about you, not Harlan.  Actually, the Ellison
quote re love-hounds put me in mind of a repartee from the Firesign Theatre:

	Nick:  Some fancy layout you have here, Nancy --
	       What's this, your boudoir?
	Nancy: Oh no, these are the kennels...
	Nick:  Puttin' on the dog, eh? ...

Finally, a M. LeFebvre responded to my querulous love-letter to you by noting
his own experience of encountering you -- and he had named my own experience
precisely!  I too first "got into you" with "The Man with the Child in His
Eyes" and "Wuthering Heights", and it is precisely the abrupt movements into
your "little-girl voice" that troubled me (the less so now, my dear
woman-child).

I suspect there still must be some hidden agenda, however.  Why, after all,
did M. LeFebvre decide it was reasonable to finally sit down and try to listen
to you anyway?  That's my big question -- what motivates one into the groove,
if one starts off from more or less mainstream (e.g., even the Style Council
or Fine Young Cannibals, never mind Pat Benatar and Madonna...)?  What gives
one that push?  Is it ultimately "peer pressure" -- i.e., seeing that the
people we like like you?

Or is it those wonderful eyes, Katey darling?

--Kevin
