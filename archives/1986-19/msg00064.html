&gt; [Kevin C:] Dear Kate, [...] I happen to think that you miss a few
&gt; times in Running Up That Hill, especially near the end when the
&gt; "other noises" come in; your usual adeptness at orchestration flags
&gt; there (Elvis wouldn't have missed on that one).  Anyhow, it was
&gt; okay.

Ack!  The end, when the "other noises" come in is the best part!  The
part where many Kates are singing in tongues in the background gives
me multiple orgasms every time I hear it.  Elvis could never do
something this awesome.

&gt; I think the real thing I meant about your voice is this: if you just
&gt; put on one of your songs in a random room, the effect is dissonance.
&gt; The sound of your voice is grating and unpleasant GIVEN THE
&gt; EXPECTATION ONE HAS THAT AUDIBLE MUSIC WILL BE ORGANISMICALLY
&gt; APPROPRIATE.

Well, Stravinsky said "Consonance has no place in modern music."  That
may have been a bit of an overstatement, but it was the right thing to
say at the time.  Consonace and dissonance are like ying in yang.  In
order to have perfection, you have to have the right amount of both.
Dissonace is just as important as consonance.  The problem with most
heavy metal music isn't that it's too dissonant.  It's problem is that
it's too consonant!  And way too simple.

One of the reasons why Kate's best songs are the best songs in
existence is because they are, at the same time, both beautifully
melodic and excrutiatingly dissonant.

I have to agree with IED that I enjoy being shocked by the new and
this is one reason why I kept listening to *The Dreaming*, even though
at first I found it much more irritating than "enjoyable".  I *did*
find it *intriguing* right from the beginning.  *The Kick Inside*,
however, I didn't like at first.  I didn't find it particularly
interesting -- I just found it annoying.  The only reason I continued
to listen to it is because it was by the same person who did *The
Dreaming*.  I eventually came around.

 know what love is.  A boy loves his dog."
