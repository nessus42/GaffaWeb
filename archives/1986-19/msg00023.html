	The review of Other Music is for Bill Hsu, who sent me the catalog
number in exchange for a promise of a review...here you go, Bill.  Hope you're
not too disappointed; I found them distinctly irritating.

	Anyway, here's some reviews that I also sent to rec.music.misc, so
don't bother reading them here if you've already seen them there.

	Well, it's been awhile since I've posted any reviews, mostly due to
a fairly oppressive class load.  Now, since finals are over, I believe I'll
indulge myself in a little creative criticism...

ADRIAN BELEW: Desire Caught By the Tail
	Former King Crimson guitarist creates another solo LP after having
	worked extensively with Laurie Anderson.  Although Belew is known
	for being able to coax the most incredible variety of sounds from
	a Strat since Hendrix, that's about all this LP showcases - noises.  
	Musical construction and tonal centre are conspicously absent on this 
	work, having been abandoned for a collection of screams, grunts, squeals
	and elephant roars.  It reminded me of the second side of "Three of a 
	Perfect Pair" without the melodies.  It's hard to recommend this album 
	to anyone except die-hard Belew fans (of which I was a member until
	this LP).

ART ZOYD: Musique du Ballet "Le Mariage du Ciel et de L'Enfer"
	The soundtrack of a Roland Petit ballet which was performed in Milano,
	Paris and Marseille in '84 and '85, "Musique..." is an interesting
	classically influenced piece which is typical of French art farts
	Art Zoyd.  Interesting music, sounding at times similar to Philip
	Glass, but with more tonal variety and less repetition, although there
	certainly is plenty of repetition here.  A fair amount of vocal work
	similar in style to the sort of stuff you hear on Magma records, but
	at a listenable pace.  Recommended if you're a fan of the European 
	art rock scene.

JON HASSELL: Power Spot
	Trumpeter Hassell's latest release, although the recorded material
	apparently dates back to late `83 - early `84.  This is definitely
	Hassell's most "musical" work; the melodical constructions are more
	finely defined here than in his earlier works, with a greater amount
	of definition between titles.  The material is interesting without
	becoming boring, and the background rhythmical structure is very
	intricate (consisting of polyrhythmic percussion) and amazingly
	well-played.  Increased use of synthesisers results in a more
	mainstream-sounding work; in addition, the production is outstanding.
	Highly recommended to fans of Hassell's work (or anyone, for that
	matter, who enjoys listening to Eastern-influenced polyrhythmic
	music which rides on the rock-jazz-"New Age" border).

J. GREINKE: Cities in Fog
	Greinke puts together a very Eno-esque sonic landscape using synths,
	tape loops, and the occasional well-processed guitar.  Great background
	music for film soundtracks...reminded me of "Music for Films".  It's
	not quite solid enough to stand on its own, though -- too much synth
	wash and not enough melody makes for boring tunes.  The title is quite
	apt though since the music DOES invoke elaborate imagery.

OTHER MUSIC: Incidents Out of Context
	I knew I was in trouble when I saw the cover...five people who strongly
	resemble investment bankers sitting around a table eating various
	electronic components with chopsticks.  I thought from the description
	in the "New Music Distribution Service Catalog" (from whom I purchased
	the LP) that this work from the Bay Area group Other Music would be
	worth its salt, but unfortunately I was led astray.  Picture your
	next door neighbor's kid playing with a xylophone and one of those
	cheapo Radio Shack synths that only play wide-open bell tones and
	you'll get a good idea of what these guys sound like.  It's amazing
	how INCREDIBLY BAD a pure bell tone sounds; apparently the folks in
	Other Music either don't know how to program a synthesiser or they
	LIKE the sound of doorbells.  Perhaps it's the fact that the synths
	are out of tune with the metallophones, or maybe it's just the boring
	tonal construction.  In any event the album sounds like a seventh
	grader's project for Music Lab. 


	PS I'd like to take this opportunity to push the NEW MUSIC DISTRIBUTION
	SERVICE, from whom I ordered three out of the five works reviewed above.
	Their catalog is extensive and their shipment impressively quick
	(I got my order about ten days after I sent it in...a 10 day turnaround
	for a cross country trip is pretty impressive!)  If you're a fan of
	"alternative" music I STRONGLY URGE you to write them (500 Broadway,
	NY NY 10012) or call (212 925 2121).  Their prices are more than
	fair and their title selection varied and impressive.  Give them a
	shot...at least send away for their catalog.
