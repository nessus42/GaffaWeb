Greetings Radio Junkies:

	Recently while bemoaning the state of the "new rock" radio shows
on my local "non-commercial" radio - someone hit me with the concrete
balloon of "well, MR. Smarty-Pants, if you know so much, why don't you
do a radio show".  Unfortunately, time and circumstances don't allow me to do
this ---- totally.  So what I've done is put together a 90 minute 
cassette with the same format of a radio show - i.e. fade-ins, mixes
and announcements of song titles.  I'm calling the little monster -
Nihilius Fililius, a bastardization of the latin term for bastard... no,
I don't include any of my rants on tape, just a simple listing of the
songs and any pertinent information.  I try to keep the mix fun by
including such spoken word pieces as "German Recipe" by Alex Thibault
and some bootleg recordings from Henry Rollins and Wanda Coleman as
well as excerpts from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy radio show.  The
music includes stuff from Wendy O'Williams to Pere Ubu.  From such
up and comers as Scrawl and Firehose to such old standbys as the Butthole 
Surfers (actually some well recorded bootleg instrumental).  Anyway, 
I plan to keep the thing real organic with updates every month or so
and am sending out about 10 promotional copies (all out of my pocket)
to zines and publications as well as placing free ads wherever I can.
The "cost" to anyone is merely a blank C-90 tape (or $3) and return postage/
SASE.  I also encourage anybody with bootlegs or their own recorded
materiel to send it for trade and possible inclusion in future "Nihilius
Fililius" -  I keep the mix about 50/50 betwixt vinyl and cassettes (that
includes vinyl recordings I have on cassette) mostly because that is
the set-up I need to do the nifty fade-ins and fade-outs.  There is one
set showcasing woman with Nina Hagen ("White Punks On Dope"), Wendo O
("Sex Junkie"), Scrawl, Wanda Coleman poems, The Avengers (rare live
rendering), The Dils, and Pussy Galore (well, they have a female bassist)
that came out really well.  I'm working through a POBox in order to
forestall any legal action - POB 491, Greenbelt, MD, 20770 - but as
goes with out saying, any reproduction is for promotional use only.  In
the future, I'd like to create a review section which short 
snatches from albums played while the recordings are being reviewed.  Also,
I'm incorporating found noise and as much spoken word as I can (without
becoming too ponderous).  Still, I provide reference points (there's
a recording of "search and destroy" as well as a Red Lorry, Yellow Lorry
recording included) so people won't get too lost in the new and unfamiliar
sounds.  So, if you're interested in any of the stuff you see raved about
here but were not willing to part with your well-earned Gelder, this might
be the thing for you - or if you just want to hear some rare recordings of
your already fave bands mixed in with the "old" stuff, then I'm looking forward 
to hearing from you - and am hoping you won'treport me to the police :=)=   

James.
