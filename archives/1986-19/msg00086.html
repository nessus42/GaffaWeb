&gt;&gt; And who/what does Kate sound like?  I've been able peg her everytime
&gt;&gt; I heard her.
&gt;
&gt;Kyle, Kyle, Kyle....  There's a lot that could be argued with in
&gt;almost any of IED's postings, but you've found nearly none of it and
&gt;have decided to just rant instead.  It is clear what IED has been
&gt;saying.  To paraphrase, Kate's voice is a pure, versatile instrument
&gt;which she often plays with a distinctive style.  Elvis Costello's
&gt;voice, on the other hand is a distinctive, limited instrument.


OK, I have a question for you, which is a more versitile instrument?

	a) a guitar
	b) a drum

The answer in my opinion is very dependent on what one values in an instrument
and one's personal cultural experiences.  Are you going to tell me that the
only valid way to evaluate these instruments/voices is relative to Classical
European culture?  Take a few moments to consider before you answer.

Now, think about Kate VS. Elvis.

&gt;&gt; And what does a Stradavarius reflect?  You're starting to sound like
&gt;&gt; an Ethno-centric European.  You know Hitler would have agreed with
&gt;&gt; you.
&gt;
&gt;Almost a glimmer of point here!  Amazing.  I still think it would be
&gt;safe to say that a Stradavarius is a more versatile instrument than a
&gt;banjo.

My point is that they are entirely different instruments and such direct
comparisons do not prove anything.  In addition, I would say that you have
been taught to think of a violin as a "better" instrument than a "banjo".
AN insturment (or voice) should NOT be judged only in relation to its
application to Classical Music.


&gt;
&gt;&gt; Andy, I'll have to agree with you here.  One should not listen to
&gt;&gt; her music with expectations, but rather with reservations.
&gt;
&gt;And why's that Kyle?

Because I find her voice quite annoying at times!

&gt;Your entire posting is indicative of the lack of reasoning and
&gt;expressive abilities that is so typical of those who malign Kate Bush.
&gt;In the future postings, please try to exhibit some of those properties
&gt;that separate us humans from the lower life forms.

I have NEVER maligned Kate Bush (I own quite a few of her albums), so why
do you accuse of such.  She is an interesting "artist" and I like SOME of
her work.  What relation is there between my comments on IED and my
appreciation of Kate's work?


And just what qualities do you think I should exhibit?

	Must I refer to myself in the third person?
	Worship before the "perfect" Kate?
	Speak only in glowing tones about Kate?

My we are sensitive!!
