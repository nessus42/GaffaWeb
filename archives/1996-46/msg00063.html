Hello all!
  I've been sick for the past couple of days, so i haven't been able to 
read rec.music.gaffa, but i came back today to find myself quoted in 
about a dozen places. It was nifty. And i'm mostly better now, so that's 
good. Okay, on to the point(s).
  So far it's been really cool reading all of your responses to my 
questions, and i feel like i have more of an understanding. Honestly i 
was afraid that someone would think i was trying to be rude, but no one 
did. That was nice.
  The Whole Story. There used to be a video place around here which had it 
for rent. I probably shouldn't even say this, since i don't know if they
still have it, but tonight i will call and check that, and if they do 
then i will drive all the way across the city to rent it, and i will make 
a copy for myself, and then if anyone else wants me to make a copy, 
perhaps i can set up a video tree. The next time i am in school (which 
would be Monday) i will post something to tell you if i got the video. 
Then, if you want a copy, email me. Or you could email me now, but then 
if they don't have the video it will be a letdown.... Remember, this is 
NTSC format only.
   I had something else to say but i've forgotten it now.... Oh well, 
maybe later. I'm off to a Biology final. Eew.
