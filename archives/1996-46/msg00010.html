   I know i shouldn't get into this. I know it's a tired old subject so 
PLEASE forgive me, please. BUT! I'm not picking a fight! That's 
something! Anyway....
   I'd have to disagree with you about the emotions. Tori's music seems 
pretty sincere to me. When i first got Little Earthquakes, way back when 
it came out, i listened to it and then i listened to it again and then i 
cried all night. I think the other albums are harder to understand than 
LE, but no less sincere, though i can see how you would think that. 
Something like, "She puts all this energy into sounding hurt, so she 
won't have to put as much energy into writing better lyrics." I can see 
that, but i still disagree.
   On another note, i would love to like Jane Siberry, but her voice just 
gets on my nerves! I've heard a couple of songs in which is doesn't, but 
most of the time i just have to stop the cd or turn the radio off. I'm 
trying my best, though.

  And one more thing. Please don't take this the wrong way, everyone, but 
is it a sign of respect to call someone a God or Goddess? It seems to me 
that to do that is to deny the person the right to be a human, and to 
have a bad day, and to make mistakes, and to be real. I'm not saying that 
anyone should stop (i wouldn't presume), i just want to know the thought 
processes behind that. 8)
