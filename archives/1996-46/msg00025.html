Hello all from another Kate fan who has been recieving the Love Hounds
digest for a few months now. I bought The Dreaming back in 1985(?) or so
and loved it but was scared by it ( I was 22 yrs old). I thought the
backwards cuts were subliminal and who knows how evil. The Dreaming
still affects me powerfully today but I am no longer scared by it. (I
guess I am less superstitious now, also less ignorant.) Learning more
about Kate and buying Hounds of Love, then The Sensual World has been a
wonderful experience for me. Thanks for helping me understand more about
the most talented Kate. I hope to learn more and understand more because
I --like so many of you, it seems-- have a deep respect and admiration
for the gal. The only video I have seen is "The line, the cross and the
curve," which seems to be something rarely mentioned on this list. I
think it is pretty good and recommend it (although I have no other Kate
videos to compare it to).  Any words of encouragement or recommendations
on what to buy would be welcome.

The main reason for posting is to try to put in words some of the
sublime and possibly inexpressible reactions invoked in me by Kate's
music: 

I love The Dreaming's ~sense of power~ and ~strength of purpose~. I
think it inspires self-confidence in me, while still putting me in awe
at the amazing spiritual/ supernatural world which people seem to be so
oblivious to most of the time.

Hounds of Love is still something of an enigma to me. I had high
expectations of it (thanks to this list). I had heard A Deal with God
before (running up that hill), so I knew it was good. HOL is good
"therapy" for someone learning to stop denying or repressing emotions.
The songs are varied in mood, coming and going as they please and no
more able to be grasped than a strong emotion. They are meant to be
felt. Everytime I get through The Ninth Wave --which seems to me to have
a theme of something like several different lives in the reincarnation
of a soul, unless I am reading too much into it-- and the beautiful,
wonderful but short song called the "The Morning Fog" plays, I just want
to stay there in that place forever. Often I play it more than once
after the end of the album. But successive playing of it is not the
same, just comes close. Its like being after all the other, darker songs
in the ninth wave makes it more powerful. 

Finally, The Sensual World seems like so much less of a "theme album"
than the other 2 I own. I am always impressed upon hearing it. But it
still hasnt "made its imprint" on me like the other 2. I have only
listened to it all the way through 4-5 times. Its harder for me to
absorb because it seems like ~Each Song~ has a lesson for me. SO much
ground to be covered.

Perhaps I should have let it suffice to say that her composition,
lyrics, and voice combine to be deeply meaningful and powerful, invoking
emotions and insights otherwise unavailable to me.

Anyone else care to fill in the blank? Kates music invokes.....
