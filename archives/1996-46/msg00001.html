&gt;I was just re-watching the video and it occurred to me that as Del puts
&gt;Kate in the car and then gets in and "drives"...it's a left hand drive
&gt;car...was this video shot in the states?  it seems odd for it to be L.H.D.
&gt;if it was shot in the U.K. even though it was probably only a set...
&gt;
&gt;there's no word of it in the credits...just curious if anyone might know.

Exsqueeze me?  That's not Del Palmer who stars in the video.  It's that man
who's appeared on Black Adder as CAPT. Darling.  Tim Mc..something or
other.
It's probably L. H. D so that he doesn't have to run all the way around the
car to put her in then run all the back.

I think Tori is great.  Okay, she was influenced by Kate - she said so- but
there's only so far influence will take you before you have to do it on you
own.

Did that make sense?

What I'm trying to say is that Tori can be influenced by Kate but that
doesn't mean that all of her songs are a credit to Kate's genius - Tori has
branched out in ways far different from Kate and their works are now so
diversified that they are no longer fair bases for comparison.
