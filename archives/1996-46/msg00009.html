   i liked There Goes a Tenner a lot. I think it could have been much 
better if they had put just a little more time into the set, and a little 
less into making those silly computer effects. Of course, that's me 
speaking from ten years later, and special effects have gotten so much 
more refined since then.... I didn't like Suspended in Gaffa the first 
time i saw it, but the second time around i decided that it was 
definitely pretty cool, if not a high point in Kate's film career. 8) So 
i guess they're not so bad, considering when they're from, but i still 
think Kate could have done a better job with her ideas for the videos, 
even if it was the 80's.
   Now, the Hounds of Love videos and the Experiment IV video, they're a 
completely different story. I LOVE those! I haven't seen them in years 
because i can't find the Whole Story tape anywhere (grr!). Sigh. Does 
anyone know where i can find a copy (NTSC)?
  Talking about videos is fun.
