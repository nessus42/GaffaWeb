I'm a HUGE Ritchie Blackmore fan (from way back when I was a whole lot
younger and thinner).  He's right up there with KaTe on the all-time fave
list (and about as stylistically opposed as it can possibly get!).

In nearly 20 years of enjoying both of these incredible talents, it never
once occurred to me that either one had ever heard of the other -- let
alone listened to their work.  Now, I find out that Ritchie is a Kate
fan!!!!!

On his web site, Ritchie Blackmore's WWW Experience, fans were recently
asked to e-mail a question to him.  He answered 75 of them, and the replies
are available in text and wav audio formats on the site.  (God I wish KaTe
would do something like this!)

Anyhow, one of the questions was: "Who was your favorite keyboard player in
Rainbow and why?".  Ritchie replied:

"I would say David Rosenthal. Very easy to get along with. He was pitch
perfect. The man was absolutely amazing. I don't know if you remember Kate
Bush, but I played him a Kate Bush song on my cassette and he could work
out the chords instantly and they're not simple. Kate Bush being one of my
favorites back in those days. This is no mean task especially by ear
without consulting an instrument at the time..."

Is this too cool or what?!?!?  Just had to share it...

Check out Ritchie's site at <A  HREF="http://www.webstars.com/webstars/ritchie/">http://www.webstars.com/webstars/ritchie/</A>
(Not in the same league as Gaffaweb, but then again, what is??)
