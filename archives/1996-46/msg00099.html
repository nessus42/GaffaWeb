I'd personally list it as Kate/Tori (but, it's a long story}

When I talk about Tori to Kate fans, of which I'm definitely one (which
makes me feel awful lonely in the US, so it Kate discussions don't happen
as much as I like), I invariably get the "Tori's just a derivative of Kate"
line.  My deepest apologies to all you who think this way, but I just don't
see it.

The similarities, both are women who play the piano and have amazing
voices.  Uhhh, that's about it.  Sure, there aren't many other musicians
who fit that description, but rip-off or tribute do (does?) not two
qualities make.

First of all, they're two different generations of musicians.  Can anyone
imagine Tori hanging out with David Gilmour or Kate with Trent Reznor? 
Second, Kate's worldlinesand experimentation, while they may someday show
up in Tori, are her major contribution to music.  In fact, for this reason,
Laurie Anderson is more akint to Kate than Tori is.  Listen to things like
Jig of Life or anything off of Sensual World,
listen to how easily Kate slips into whatever role she wants to in songs
like Peter Pan or Pull Out the Pin, most of all read her lyrics, and try
imagining Tori being as similarly "chameleonesque" (&lt;--made that word up
just now, sorry).

Secondly, imagine Kate trying to play piano like Tori does
(im-freakin-possible).  Kate's a wonderful musician, but Tori's a demon in
the same league as  Keith Emerson.  Kate's playing, while  of the highest
artistic quality is slower, more methodic, and definitely less schooled. 
And even though Kate uses the music to its highest effect (and man does she
know how to arrange expressive pieces), Kate's no Tori.

As far as the voices go, I defintely prefer Kate's voice, no question. 
Kate's quality of making everyone who hears her think she's singing to them
seems to me one of the post-modern wonders of the world.  I'm sure that
there are many people who've found Kate at the lowest times of their lives
and been pulled back from the edge just by the sheer goodness of that
voice.

Tori's voice is completely different, not necessarily inferior mind you,
but like from the other side of the planet.  Her lyrics are also an
entirely different species from Kate's.  While Kate seems to draw a person
in and sometimes twist a small enigma into their brain "Who's Lily?" 
"What's Gaffa?" "WHY WON'T SHE TOUR?",  if you sit down and read the
lyrics, most enigmas of Kate's don't need to be answered, the songs speak
for themselves, and the enigmas are lillte itches.  It's these little
translucent phrases and lines that helped there come a time like now when
Tori can be opaque.  While there might be one line in a Kate song that
leaves you guessing, there's hardly a line in any of Tori's that doesn't.

THe biggest difference between the two--and the one that seals it beyond
any doubt...is the perspective of their songs.  It's hard for me to imagine
Tori coming up with anything approaching Lionheart in it's galvanizing if
sappy sentimentality.  While Professional Widow or Me and a Gun would NEVER
NEVER NEVER come into Kate's mind and have her say,"Yes, I think that's a
song I want to do."  Period.

If you want to fight over which one's better, that's fine, but it's dumb. 
However, trying to link Tori to Kate's coattails (or any other part of
Kate) is vaccuoo...vaccuuou...it sucks.

There, my rant is done, love and blessings to you all
