Re:  Another Day

I would like to get a copy of the Lovehounds video 
with the rare footage of the christmas special.
This sounds like most of the vids I've never seen.
Somewhere, I'd love to see the original Saturday 
Night Live performance.

&gt; gets on my nerves! 

I've taken Kate's recordings to several DJs over the years, 
most of them women.  They all had the same reply:  "her 
voice gets on my nerves".  I suspect it 
is a personal thing.  Alannis Morrisette's voice gets on 
my nerves.

&gt;Please don't take this the wrong way, everyone, but 
&gt;is it a sign of respect to call someone a God or Goddess? It seems to me 
&gt;that to do that is to deny the person the right to be a human, and to 
&gt;have a bad day, and to make mistakes, and to be real. 

I agree.  Further, were it me, it would scare the hell out of 
me because people who discover their gods are not can be 
rather disappointed and retributive.  Sometimes it is better if not 
harmful, to let them go on with it.  We could stop and say, all 
godWorship is harmful, but I think observation contradicts it.
My opinion is as long as Cathy is not harmed, Kate is up to it.

&gt;I'm not saying that anyone should stop (i wouldn't presume), i just want to know the &gt;thought processes behind that. 8)

I can't speak for others. Perhaps surrendering so much 
love to a stranger might be more acceptable if the stranger is 
superhuman because one can always say, it is beyond one's control,
and accept that love is not returned.
  
Surrendering so much to a human by choice, well, that is what 
human love is, isn't it?  Maybe that is scarier for some.
