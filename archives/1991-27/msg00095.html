In article &lt;9108022216.AA15537@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt; Andy writes:
&gt;    Jorn Barger writes about Tom Richards's news that he will soon
&gt; (how soon, do you know, Jorn?) be coming out with a new book about
&gt; Kate Bush, co-written with Robert Godwin.  Do you know what publisher
&gt; will be putting out this book? Whether there has been any attempt
&gt; to consult with Kate herself before publishing? And what about con-
&gt; sulting with Love-Hounds for some free proof-reading?

I asked 'within 12 months?' and he said, for sure.  I don't think it's
going to be a name publisher, just a homebrew.  Why would Kate care?
I'll ask Tom about proofreading when I next call, but that may be
months, so feel free to approach him...?

&gt;    What about the Mankowitz box CD of The Kick Inside, Jorn? Do you
&gt; know whether this will be an official EMI release? Will there be
&gt; similar editions of Kate's other albums?

Apparently, yes, official.  If it sells, there's gotta be sequels.  (And
when I checked, I found I'd misremembered the price for the Revolver
box-- only $70, so not unthinkably pricey.)

&gt;    Then you write: "Larry H. mentioned in May that a new can was
&gt; supposed to be coming with a tee-shirt and 'new material'."
&gt; What do you mean, "can"? A CD in a can? On what label? Is this
&gt; official Kate Bush material? What do you mean, 'new material'?
&gt; Only guest-vocals by Kate on other artists' records? Do you refer
&gt; to Larry Hernandez, or some other Larry H.?

I can't picture the can business, myself!  It's 'unofficial' but I'm
pretty sure new to the 'unofficial' cd market.  The Comic Relief stuff
I think is also supposed to be on there.  Larry Hernandez posted about
it back in May or so, but it's been shelved and revived since then.
Somehow it's all supposed to be packaged in a can.

(I saw a new CD of the Cathy Demos in WaxTrax yesterday for $38.  It
appeared to include all the good stuff except Organic Acid on one CD.
I forget the title, but the cover art was a drawing of Kate, not a photo.)
