                   The Goldmine collectibles article, 1991

     [The following article, annotated by Andrew Marvick, appeared
in the August 9, 1991 issue of Goldmine, a periodical geared
toward record collectors.  The article was written by Gillian Gaar,
a longtime Kate fan (of sorts) who first got the  attention of
other fans through her shortlived comic fanzine, For the Love
of Kate.  The present article was written with the assistance of a
well-known dealer in Kate Bush merchandise, Tom Richards of C-Side
Records.  Such credentials would lead one to expect a first-rate
article, but alas! such is not the case.  There are a number of
factual errors in the piece, and a terrible lack of organization.
Nevertheless, it is of considerable interest to collectors, since
it is the most recent assessment of the relative value of Kate
Bush-related merchandise to have appeared in a mainstream
publication since 1989.]


                           Kate Bush Collectibles

                               by Gillian Gaar


     Though Britain's Kate Bush has been a highly successful
commercial artist from the release of her first single, Wuthering
Heights, in 1978, her track record in the U.S. has been
surprisingly minimal in comparison, with only her fifth album,
Hounds of Love, and the accompanying single Running Up That Hill
cracking the American Top 40 (both peaking at No. 30).  When Bush
finally left EMI-America (she remains on EMI in the U.K.) and
signed with Columbia Records, there was speculation that perhaps
this corporate giant would be able to break Bush in the states,
where she maintains a strong underground following.  But these
hopes did not come to fruition; 1989's The Sensual World just
missed the Top 40, peaking at No. 44 in Billboard, and the single
Love and Anger didn't chart at all (though it did reach No. 1 in
Billboard's "Modern Rock" chart).
     Still, it's unlikely that this lack of chart success will make
any diference to collectors, for Bush's collectibility as an artist
has remained undiminished by the cool reception her work has
received in this country, a collectibility that extends to
virtually anything with a Bush connection, and this article will
take a look at a wide range of collectibles.  It's not unusual for
items to change hands at prices in the hundreds of dollars, and
early items continue to increase in value--even Bush's debut
single, which hardly qualifies as a "rarity", being a No. 1 gold
single in Britain, can command as much as $40.00 in its original
U.K. picture sleeve. [Actually, the original picture-sleeve issue
of this U.K. single is in fact very hard to come by, and a copy in
mint condition could bring a great deal more than $40.00. AM]
     In fact, as very few Bush songs can be considered rarities,
collectors have tended to focus on the variations in the releases,
particularly the singles, where the variations are limitless,
encompassing different song pairings, covers, etc.  Some of the
more interesting and unusual releases of this type include the
Polish "postcard" singles (Moving, Saxophone Song and Strange
Phenomena, all from Bush's first album, The Kick Inside); the
Canadian Wow on yellow vinyl and the promo of Symphony in Blue on
blue vinyl (from Bush's second album, Lionheart); a British promo
flexi-disk with excerpts from Never For Ever, Bush's third album;
the Breathing single (from Never For Ever) with a sleeve featuring
Bush in a "bat" pose released in France, and Germany reversing the
colors from the British white-mushroom-against-a-black-sky to black
on white on its version; and Babooshka (also from Never For Ever),
released as a blue flexi-disk in Russia (there are allegations that
this is a pirated disk).
     The songs Ne T'En Fui Pas and Un Baiser D'Enfant are rarities
of a sort, having only been released in France, Canada and the
U.S., though the original mix of Ne T'en Fui Pas appeared on the
flip side of There Goes a Tenner in the U.K.  In Canada, Ne T'en
Fui Pas (also spelled "T'enfuis" on some releases) [The latter is
the correct French spelling. AM] was paired with Dreamtime (an
instrumental version of the title track of The Dreaming [Kate's
fourth LP]) and Un Baiser D'Enfant (a French-language version of
The Infant Kiss from Never For Ever) had Suspended in Gaffa (from
The Dreaming) as its flip.  Both songs also appeared on the mini-
LP, Kate Bush, in Canada, and were paired together on a single in
France; Un Baiser D'Enfant only appeared on the U.S. version of the
mini-LP.
     Most people in the U.S. were probably introduced to Bush when
she appeared as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on
December 9, 1978, singing Them Heavy People and The Man With the
Child in His Eyes from The Kick Inside.  The Kick Inside had
originally been released in the U.S. on EMI's Harvest label in
March 1978 (February 1978 in the U.K.), with a cover matching the
Canadian release, picturing a wide-eyed Bush clutching her head.
The album was later re-released on the EMI-America label in July
1978 with a new cover, featuring Bush lounging in jeans and red
knee-high socks, with the same shot appearing on the Wuthering
Heights single-sleeve [actually this shot was not exactly the same
as the LP photo. AM], released as a single at the same time (it had
been released in January in Britain).  Neither Wuthering Heights
nor its follow-up, The Man With the Child in His Eyes, performed
well in the charts, with The Man With the Child... eventually
peaking at No. 85.  Wuthering Heights was reissued in 1986 on EMI-
America's Silver Spotlight Series label b/w Babooshka.
     But though these U.S. singles in their original sleeves can
sell for upwards of $40, the real rarity from this period is Self
Portrait: The Kate Bush Radio Special.  This seven-inch promo disk
had Bush introducing and discussing four of The Kick Inside's
songs, along with two album plugs. [This is actually a twelve-inch
LP record, not a seven-inch record, and Kate discusses more than
just four tracks from the album. It is clear that the author has
not seen the item herself. AM] Packaged in a sleeve which also
featured the second U.S. album cover, prices for this record start
at $200 and can go as high as $500.
     The Kick Inside was released in at least six different covers
worldwide (with variations in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Japan,
Argentina and Yugoslavia), on gray vinyl in Holland, and on CBS's
Portrait label in Israel.  In 1979 it was also released as a
picture disk in the U.K. in a limited-edition run (which sources
have at anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000).  This disk was later
reissued, with the first run worth $150 and the second $90.  There
are several ways to distinguish the original pressing from the
second: the cover on the original has a round brown sticker
identifying the record as a picture disk, and the record itself has
a thick black rim and the words "Remember Yourself" scratched in
the run-out groove.  The second pressing has an oval sticker on the
cover, a thinner black rim, no message, and the words "Manufactured
in the U.K. by EMI Records" stamped in the run-out groove.
     The release of The Kick Inside was also backed up by heavy
promotion, and among the many television appearances Bush made was
a series of performances shot at the Efteling Gardens near
Amsterdam in Denmark [sic!], with Bush miming to six of the album's
songs.  Though not commercially available, the show has made the
rounds in collectors' circles on video.  Video collectors have
proven to be remarkably adept at preserving Bush's appearances on
the tube, which frequently had her performing alternate versions of
songs with "official" video releases.  Her U.S. TV appearances have
been infrequent, though aside from Saturday Night Live, she has
appeared on Night Flight, MTV and VH-1. [The subject of Kate's
television appearances and their collectibility is an enormous and
separate one.  The glancing reference here to one or two individual
video clips is frustrating and confusing. See Andrew Marvick's more
detailed listing of some 110 different Kate Bush video clips, in
the computer resource, The Garden. AM]
     Another unusual appearance in the wake of The Kick Inside was
a commercial Bush filmed for Seiko watches in Japan, which also put
together a special promotional package which featured pictures of
Bush limited to 25 copies.  Another sought-after release from Japan
is a Japanese fan club's seven-inch record released in 1985 on red
vinyl [N.B.: this was originally a red flexi-disk, not a hard vinyl
release. AM], with a live version of Bush performing Let It Be and
a message from her photographer brother John Carder Bush.  [The
live version is actually from a crude in-audience tape and is
drastically abridged; in addition to John Carder Bush's message,
the original also included a brief message from Kate. AM] This
record has been counterfeited, but can be distinguished from the
original by its accompanying poster sleeve, which folds out into an
information sheet on the original and a color poster on the
counterfeit (which is also on green vinyl).  A boot purporting to
be Japanese, though it is not of Japanese origin, is also in
circulation, with live versions of The Long and Winding Road, She's
Leaving Home and a charity single version of Let It Be. [This
information is all mixed up. The single in question does not
purport to be of Japanese manufacture, but it does indeed contain
television soundtracks of performances Kate gave in Japan in June
1978. The b-side contained the two Beatles covers mentioned above,
but the a-side featured Kate's own song Moving, as performed by her
live during the Seventh Tokyo Song Festival. The reference to the
song Let It Be is also inaccurate, in that the version of the song
in which Kate participated during her appearance on Japanese
television in 1978 was not the same as the recording of the same
song which was released in Britain in 1987 to aid the families of
the victims of the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster.  Although Kate did add
vocals to that recording, neither it nor the Japanese version has
ever appeared on a record with the other two Beatles covers. AM]
     In between the release of Lionheart in November 1978 and Never
For Ever in September 1980, Bush organized her only concert tour to
date, the 1979 Tour of Life. (The tour booklet has since become
another in-demand collector's item). Bush's first video, Kate Bush
Live at Hammersmith Odeon, and the EP, Live On Stage, preserved the
live performances; EMI Home Video has recently reissued the
Hammersmith Odeon video (also available on laser-disk in Japan).
     The EP exists in a variety of formats, and began life as a
promo set of two 45s in a gatefold sleeve, with a green sticker
over the "33 1/3" notation on the cover, and is worth $125.  The
first commercially available copy was a single 33 1/3 disk packaged
in the same gatefold sleeve, but with one of the pockets glued
shut: it's worth $30.  The second pressing, worth $15, was
available in a single sleeve.  The promo set was also broken up
into two singles for jukebox play, worth $30 in plain sleeves, or
as a pair in a single non-gatefold sleeve, worth $15.  The four
songs have appeared in a variety of formats, including a Portuguese
twin-pack, a twelve-inch disk in France and Holland, twelve-inch
and seven-inch disk in Japan and Canada, and a German seven-inch.
The song Them Heavy People fromthe EP was also released in the U.S.
as a promo disk.
     The first Bush boots were released in the wake of the tour,
though with only one tour to her credit, the boot market was
initially limited to the same set of songs being performed at
different venues.  Wow, a limited edition boot on red vinyl, is
said to be the first Bush boot, a double LP featuring material from
the live show and a '79 Christmas special, with an appearance by
Peter Gabriel singing Here Comes the Flood and, with Bush, Roy
Harper's Another Day (this is another show popular in video
collectors' circles).  Other Bush boots draw on material culled
from live TV appearances, guest shots at charity shows, or non-LP
b-sides.  There are also a large number of interview disks, though
many are the same interview re-pressed on different-colored vinyl.
     The existence--or non-existence--of a record entitled The
Early Years has generated a great deal of speculation among
collectors.  The record is supposed to be an official German
release featuring early demos Bush did with Pink Floyd' David
Gilmour, who brought Bush to EMI.  One story says the record was
withdrawn after release; another claims the record is a bootleg;
and a third theory suggests that the record doesn't actually exist
but is really an East German album entitled Amiga (actually the
name of the record label), a compilation of songs from Bush's first
three LPs.  The author of a Bush article in the U.K. magazine
Record Collector claimed to have seen a copy of The Early Years
"for about five seconds--long enough to say that it looked like an
official release, but not to memorize the song titles." [Gaar
should have known that a far more authoritative and reliable
source, namely Peter FitzGerald-Morris of the British fanzine
Homeground, has confirmed the existence of the album, and has even
published the titles of its ten tracks.  Peter insists, however,
that he does not own or have access to any copies of the album now.
AM]
     Whatever the truth is about the record, Bush demo material has
definitely surfaced on two different sets of releases.  The Cathy
Demos is a set of three EPs, each pressed on a different color
vinyl (red, yellow and green), limited to 600 copies each, and
containing a total of twenty-two songs--some of these early
versions of tunes later officially released, but most of them
unreleased songs, a goldmine of material for Bush fans.  [This is
inaccurate in two respects: first, there are five EPs in the Cathy
Demos collection; and second, they total twenty-three tracks, not
twenty-two. Apparently Gaar has once again relied only on hearsay,
and has not actually seen the records herself. AM]  Six additional
songs appear on Cathy's Album: Home Demo Recordings, and Cathy's
Album Too, with speculation that the six new songs are the Early
Years material, as they feature a backing band (the other 22 songs
are simply Bush and her piano).  [Once again, Gaar is misleading
her readers.  The two albums she refers to, which together comprise
only 22 of the 23 solo-piano demo recordings found on the five EPs,
also feature six additional recordings featuring Kate with back-up
by an electric band.  Five of these six tracks are songs which
later appeared (in more polished performances) on Kate's first two
studio albums, and none of the six are in any way related to the
ten tracks found on the (now untraceable) Early Years LP. AM]
Cathy's Album also had a limited-edition run of twelve copies,
numbered and titled The Sensual Woman. [These two albums are
probably the work of Tom Richards, a dealer who helped Gillian Gaar
with the material for this article.  The early title is simply a
sticker on the same album known as Cathy's Album.  The fact that
two of the nine photos accompanying Gaar's article are pictures of
these two products indicates the influence of Gaar's collaborator
Richards. AM]
     The first Bush books were also issued after the tour, with
Paul Kerton's Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography, and Fred and
Judy Vermorel's Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia both published in
1980.  Fred Vermorel produced another volume, titled The Secret
History of Kate Bush (And the Strange Art of Pop), which came out
in 1983; all three books are now out of print.  [The last of these
three is still widely available, and there is no sign that it is
out of print. AM]
     Perhaps as a reaction against such biographies (many fans find
the Vermorels' efforts particularly sleazy), the Kate Bush Club,
which began in late 1978, has made an effort to present members
with an excellent product; the newsletters are professionally
produced and feature a large number of photos of Bush (mainly taken
by her brother John) and articles from the Bush entourage
(including Kate, who profiles her new material at length on
release).  They have also offered exclusive items, such as the
limited-edition prints issued at the time of Hounds of Love's
release in 1985, limited to 1,000 and autographed by Bush. (This is
not correct. The prints were available not through the KBC but
through mail-order forms found only in initial U.K. pressings of
the album. AM]  (The KBC's address is P.O. Box 120, Welling, Kent,
DA16 3DS, England.)
     When The Dreaming was released in 1982, it was also released
in the U.S., which hadn't bothered to release Lionheart or Never
For Ever after the failure of The Kick Inside and its accompanying
singles.  Some sources say that Lionheart was released in the U.S.
and then withdrawn; the song Wow did appear on a sampler featuring
upcoming EMI-America releases, and Lionheart and Never For Ever
were eventually released in the U.S. in 1984 in non-gatefold
sleeves (the original releases were in gatefolds).  Though no
single from The Dreaming (which reached No. 157 in the Billboard
charts) was officially released, Suspended in Gaffa was released as
a twelve-inch promo, and the video was plugged into rotation on
MTV. [I have never seen such a promo twelve-inch, nor have I ever
heard that MTV aired Suspended in Gaffa's video at any time. AM]
     A promo EP featuring four songs from The Dreaming was also
released; a Canadian sampler issued at the same time (appropriately
titled Kate Bush Sampler) featured nine songs spanning Bush's
career.  EMI-America also released a test pressing of The Dreaming,
limited to five copies, each pressed on a different color of vinyl.
     And one of the more notorious boots borrowed Dreamtime for its
title: it was a tree-LP set of Bush's 1979 show at the London
Palladium, with cover artwork taken from a European Penthouse
spread of a nude model named "Kate" who bears a slight resemblance
to Bush; the spread had appeared shortly after Bush's arrival on
the music scene in 1978.
     Meanwhile, Sat In Your Lap, There Goes a Tenner and the title
track were released in Britain as singles of The Dreaming (Sat In
Your Lap had been issued as early as June 1981); Suspended in Gaffa
was released in Europe, and Night of the Swallow was released as a
single in Ireland, capitalizing on the involvement of Irish group
Planxty.  One of the most sought-after Bush singles, a counterfeit
copy was produced to satisfy "customer demand", and with the first
pressing of the single going for $125, it's worth looking at how
originals differ from the counterfeit.
     The first run comes in a glossy picture sleeve, and there is
no "-A" in the matrix number on the run-out groove.  The second run
has a matte (non-glossy) finish to its stiff sleeve, and the third
run has a thin paper sleeve with a white band down the left side
edge; both second and third runs have "-A" in the matrix number.
Counterfeit copies have a poor xerox-quality sleeve, with a
blackish tint as opposed to the original's brown coloring. [It's
important to note that the original's artwork was printed with a
deliberately grainy resolution, so that the relatively poorer
resolution of the counterfeits may be difficult to discern without
the benefit of direct a-b comparison. AM] The singles can be worth
up to $125, $85 and $50 for the first, second and third runs,
respectively.
     In 1983, the mini-LP, Kate Bush, was released in the U.S. and
Canada (reaching No. 148 in the U.S. charts), with the Canadian
version issued on six different colors of vinyl.  [Also note that
the Canadian version contained six tracks, the U.S. version only
five. AM]  In 1984 a boxed set, The Single File, was released, with
an accompanying video and laser-disk (which actually were released
in late '83).  The boxed set contained all of Bush's British
singles, from Wuthering Heights to There Goes a Tenner; the live
EP; and the Ne T'En Fui Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant single; with a
booklet containing song lyrics.
     Promo editions and the first commercial edition of the set had
a limited edition number in the booklet, and promo copies were also
autographed by Bush; the second run was unnumbered, but even it can
command as much as $100 [actually as much as $250! AM], while the
numbered sets can run $200 [Bleecker Bob's has asked for and
received $300 for less-than-mint-condition copies of these. AM] and
the autographed sets $300 [I have never seen one of these for sale,
but I estimate that $400 or even $500 might conceivably be obtained
for a copy in mint condition. AM] The set was criticized at the
time of its release for the poor quality of vinyl used, and to
compound the problem sets have been broken down, with the singles
then passed off as originals.
     There are a number of ways to distinguish original singles
from The Single File releases.  Originals have glossy sleeves as
opposed to the matte finish of the reissues [This is not always the
case, as with the original semi-matte finish of the original
release of The Man With the Child in His Eyes, for example. AM],
and they are also marked with "G&amp;L" on the sleeve.  Various
messages were scratched in the run-out groove of the originals,
which are missing on the reissues, except in the cases of Breathing
and There Goes a Tenner (some sources add Army Dreamers to this
list).  The reissues also use LP mixes of the songs instead of the
single mixes, especially noticeable in the endings of Babooshka and
Army Dreamers.
     Hounds of Love, released in 1985, received a big marketing
push in the U.S., which extended to promotional items: there were
even 100 Hounds of Love football jerseys produced, numbered 1
through 100.  A special promo pack was available in the U.S., U.K.
and Canada, which contained the album, bio and photos in a white
folder tied with a purple ribbon: the U.S. version can be worth
$150, the Canadian version--which substituted an interview album
for the Hounds of Love LP--$300, and the U.K. pack, autographed by
Bush, also worth $300.
     Initial runs of Hounds of Love were available on gray marbled
vinyl in the U.S. (there was even a "marbled cassette" version) and
pink vinyl in Canada. [The latter is far rarer than the former, and
brings much higher prices. AM]  Running Up That Hill became the
first Bush single released in the U.S. since The Man With the Child
in His Eyes, and it was Bush's first twelve-inch single to boot,
with an extended mix of the song and an instrumental version on the
flip in addition to Under the Ivy, the b-side on the seven-inch;
the U.S. promo limited itself to the single and extended mixes of
the song.  The twelve-inch Running Up That Hill in the U.K. was
released in a gatefold sleeve [Incorrect: only the U.K. seven-inch
pressing came initially in a limited-edition gatefold sleeve. AM],
and the U.K. cassette version of the Hounds of Love album also
featured the extended re-mix of the song.
     The title track and The Big Sky were also released as seven-
inch singles in the U.S., with The Burning Bridge and Not This Time
on their respective b-sides.  Hounds of Love was also a twelve-inch
promo single, with an extended version of the song [this was an
unauthorized extension of the original LP mix, with no input from
Bush herself, and released on in the U.S. promo. AM], and The Big
Sky was a commercially-available twelve-inch.  Hounds of Love, The
Big Sky and Cloudbusting were all released as seven- and twelve-
inch singles in the U.K., and The Big Sky was also released as a
seven-inch picture-disk.  A video titled The Hair of the Hound was
released with videos of all four Hounds of Love singles, and is
available as a laser-disk as well.  The picture from the U.K.
sleeve of Hounds of Love also adorned a Spanish interview picture-
disk, which was later withdrawn.
      1986 saw the release of The Whole Story (Bush's "Greatest
Hits" compilation), and Cloudbusting was finally released in the
U.S. in seven- and twelve-inch versions to accompany the album's
release, though only the twelve-inch contained the extended mix of
the song (the U.K. twelve-inch featured The Burning Bridge and My
Lagan Love), and the seven-inch had The Man With the Child in His
Eyes on its b-side.  There was also a promo-only CD released with
the single and extended versions of Cloudbusting, plus The Man With
the Child... and Sat In Your Lap.  The new single from the set was
Experiment IV, released as a seven- and twelve-inch single in the
U.S., with Wuthering Heights (featuring a new vocal) on the b-side
and December Will Be Magic on the twelve-inch, matching the U.K.
versions.
     The Whole Story also spawned a video release [of the same
name] which included the Hair of the Hound videos; Experiment IV;
Wuthering Heights (original vocal); The Man With the Child in His
Eyes; a new version of Wow; Breathing; Babooshka; Army Dreamers;
Sat In Your Lap; and The Dreaming.  EMI Publishing also released
Kate Bush Complete, one of the nicer and most comprehensive music
books, with the words and music to all of Bush's songs through
Experiment IV, along with an extensive chronology, discography,
videography and many photos.
     Though Bush did not release another album until 1989, the
intervening years had her making a number of one-off appearances at
charity events, as a backing vocalist, or on soundtracks.  She had
previously sung the title song for the U.K. film The Magician in
1979, and Brazil from Terry Gilliam's film of the same name (which
didn't make the final cut). [This is incorrect: Kate was asked to
sing a version of the song to an orchestral arrangement by Michael
Kamen intended for inclusion on a soundtrack LP made after the
release of the film.  The recording postdated the film itself by
several months. In any event, it was never released. AM]  Though
she turned down the chance to sing the theme song for the James
Bond film Moonraker, she did contribute Be Kind to My Mistakes for
Nicholas Roeg's 1987 film castaway (soundtrack on EMI) and This
Woman's Work for John Hughes's '88 film She's Having a Baby
(soundtrack on IRS).
     Bush's first appearance on a charity single was on Lesley
Duncan's Sing, Children, Sing, a benefit single for the U.N. Year
of the Child Fund, released on CBS.  She sang Breathing, and Do
Bears Sh... in the Woods?, a comic duet with Rowan Atkinson, at a
benefit show for the Save the Children Fund and Oxfam in '86, with
an album, Comic Relief, released on the WEA Records label; there
was also a video release (U.K. only).
     She sang Running Up That Hill at the 1987 Secret Policeman's
Third Ball, with its soundtrack released on Virgin, along with a
video release.  The booleg What Katie Did for Amnesty International
also features material from the show, and the boot Passing Through
Air [N.B.: the vinyl double-LP set, not the newer CD, which latter
features Cathy demos. AM] has her singing The Wedding List at one
of the Prince's Trust charity concerts.  She also appeared on the
1987 benefit single for the Zeebrugge Ferry Disaster Fund, joining
an all-star cast singing Let It Be, released on The Sun newspaper's
own label. [Additional charity performances by Bush which have
appeared in one form or another include the twelve-inch all-star
single Spirit of the Forest, to benefit the rain forests of South
America; and the Bill Duffield benefit concert bootleg. AM]
     A number of Bush songs have appeared on various compilations,
mostly U.K.-only, though The Man With the Child... did appear on
the EMI-America Spinning Pups compilation, and Breathing also
appeared on a Greenpeace charity album on A&amp;M.  Bush has also
provided backing vocals for a number of artists, most notably Peter
Gabriel, on Games Without Frontiers and No Self Control from Peter
Gabriel III, released in 1980 on Mercury; and dueting with him on
Don't Give Up, from 1986's LP, So, released on Geffen (this song
was also released as a seven- and twelve-inch single, and Bush
appeared in the video, featured on Gabriel's CV compilation).
[Actually, that compilation included two different videos for that
song, in both of which Kate appears. AM]
     Other guest appearances include Flowers, on Zaine Griff's LP,
Figures, released in 1982 on Polydor; Them Heavy People, performed
by Ray Shell on a 1981 single on EMI; You: The Game, Part II from
Roy Harper's LP, The Unknown Soldier, released in 1980 on Harvest;
The Seer, the title track of Big Country's 1986 Phonogram LP; The
King is Dead, on Go West's Dancing on the Couch LP, released in
1986 on Chrysalis; Sister and Brother, from Midge Ure's 1988 LP,
Answers to Nothing, also on Chrysalis; and an appearance on Roy
Harper's latest LP, Once.
     With the release of The Sensual World LP in 1989, Bush had
moved to Columbia in the U.S.  After deliberation, Love and Anger
was released as the LP's sole single in the U.S., on cassette only,
with Walk Straight Down the Middle, available on the CD and
cassette versions of the album.  Love and Anger was also released
as a CD-only promo in the U.S. (as were The Sensual World and This
Woman's Work). The Sensual World was the initial single release in
the U.K., followed by This Woman's Work and Love and Anger.
     All three were also available as twelve-inch singles; The
Sensual World featured an instrumental version of the song on the
flip, and the a-side, which had a special "double-groove" playing
either the extended version or the instrumental version, depending
on where the needle came down, along with Walk Straight Down the
Middle.  This Woman's Work was also released as a seven-inch
picture-disk, with Be Kind To My Mistakes [a re-mixed and edited
version of the soundtrack song.  AM] on the flip, and I'm Still
Waiting on the twelve-inch.  Love and Anger's seven-inch (in a
gatefold sleeve) had Ken (from the Comic Strip film, GLC) on the b-
side, with two other GLC numbers--The Confrontation, and One Last
Look Around the House Before We Go--on the twelve-inch.  The
singles were also available as CD-singles.
     A CD promo-pack for the album was released in the U.K. and
Canada, with CD and cassette versions of the release.  The U.S. was
given the chance to catch up on non-LP b-sides through the release
of a CD titled Aspects of the Sensual World, which featured the LP
and instrumental versions of the title track; Be Kind to My
Mistakes; I'm Still Waiting; and Ken.  The Sensual World: The
Videos was also released, with videos of The Sensual World, Love
and Anger and This Woman's Work, interspersed with interview
footage of Bush discussing the songs, taken from a VH-1 special;
the video is supposed to be set for release on laser-disk later
this year. [The laser-disk had been available in the U.S for more
than six months when Gaar's article went to press! AM]
     At the end of 1990, the boxed set called This Woman's Work, an
anthology of her recordings from 1978 to 1990, was released in the
U.K. on CD, cassette and vinyl configurations.  The set was not
released in the States, due to the rights for Bush's work being
split between EMI-America and Columbia.  For U.S. Kate fans who
have had to rely on import services for years to complete their
collections, this came as little surprise.
     The set contained all of Bush's albums except The Whole Story,
and included a "rarities" collection, featuring Bush's b-sides and
assorted other tracks (two CDs in the CD boxed set).  The set still
remains incomplete as far as including every Bush track: the
instrumental b-sides to The Dreaming and Running Up That Hill [as
well as The Sensual World. AM] were missing, along with the single
versions of Babooshka and Army Dreamers from Never For Ever.  The
set did include the tracks from the Live On Stage EP, the Ne T'En
Fui Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant single, a booklet of color photos and
stickers.
     Recently, two new Bush books appeared on the market, both from
Britain: Kerry Juby's The Whole Story and Kevin Cann and Sean
Mayes's Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary.  There are also a number
of fanzines, the most comprehensive being the semi-official
Homeground (P.O. Box 176, Orpington, Kent, BR5 3NA, England).
There are three operating in the U.S.: Watching Storms (167 Central
Avenue, East Providence, RI 02914), The Big Sky Forum (Scott Marcy,
17 Donna Rd., Chelmsford, MA 01824) and Lone Star Lionhearts (c/o
Sunset Sam Prods., 13414 Capitol Stn., Austin, TX 78711).  [See The
Garden for listings of several other U.S. publications, as well as
more than a dozen fanzines worldwide. AM] There is also a Canadian
'zine, Still Breathing, an offshoot of the controversial Break-
Through (11588 72nd Avenue, Delta, British Columbia, V4E 1Z1,
Canada).
     At the 1990 Kate Bush Convention, sponsored by Homeground and
held at London't Hammersmith Palais, Bush announced her plan to
tour at the end of 1991, in the wake of her next album's release,
also set for this fall.  Given Bush's past manner of working, even
the most devoted Kate fan can't help but be skeptical about whether
these projected dates will be met, but the announcement that Kate
is even considering a tour is a piece of news that her fans will
certainly find welcome.
     With such a strong cult following clearly evident in the U.S.,
and with prices on any Bush material continuing to rise, it's clear
that Bush has solidified her position as one of the most
collectible artists today, and the purchase of nearly any Bush item
is a wise investment for the future.
