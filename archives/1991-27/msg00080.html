 Michael Scott expressed disappointment that the video of Wuthering
Heights on The Whole Story is the same as that on The Single File.
IED may have been unclear when he mentioned (two years ago or so)
that the original video for Wuthering Heights, produced by a company
called Rockflix in February 1978, featured Kate outdoors in a field
(or moor, if you're charitable), wearing a red dress and performing
basically the same routine as in the Single File/Whole Story video.
The Rockflix video was an "official" video, but it was used mainly
in Europe, not in England. The more familiar video, with Kate in a
darkened studio and wearing a long white dress, was directed by Keith
("Keef") MacMillan shortly after the Rockflix production was
completed, and it was decided that Keef's version was a better
promotional tool for the English market. As far as IED is aware
the "moors" video by Rockflix has never been commercially
released anywhere, and is only known to fans through low-grade dubs.
Sorry, Michael.

   Jorn Barger writes about Tom Richards's news that he will soon
(how soon, do you know, Jorn?) be coming out with a new book about
Kate Bush, co-written with Robert Godwin.  Do you know what publisher
will be putting out this book? Whether there has been any attempt
to consult with Kate herself before publishing? And what about con-
sulting with Love-Hounds for some free proof-reading?
   What about the Mankowitz box CD of The Kick Inside, Jorn? Do you
know whether this will be an official EMI release? Will there be
similar editions of Kate's other albums?
   Then you write: "Larry H. mentioned in May that a new can was
supposed to be coming with a tee-shirt and 'new material'."
What do you mean, "can"? A CD in a can? On what label? Is this
official Kate Bush material? What do you mean, 'new material'?
Only guest-vocals by Kate on other artists' records? Do you refer
to Larry Hernandez, or some other Larry H.?

-- Andrew Marvick (IED)
   P.S.: Thanks, Peter, for your own kind words, and for your
resonant observations about Larry's terrific party. Same again
next year, IED hopes! (Perhaps sooner, if Kate's revised target
date for KBCVII should turn out--by some fluke--to be an accurate
one, and we all find ourselves the recipients of a new Kate Bush
album before next July 30! Doubtful...)
