&gt;From article &lt;9108011846.AA06638@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt;, by IED0DXM@MVS.OAC.UCLA.EDU:
&gt; 
&gt;      First a note to all those who contributed to the White Rose Fund
&gt; this year: IED has checked back a couple of times with the florists
&gt; in Welling, who confirmed that the envelope containing everyone's
&gt; messages for Kate did indeed arrive in time to be included with the
&gt; huge bouquet.

Thanks once again for your efforts, Andy.

&gt;      A question for Richard Caldwell: Where did you ever see an
&gt; "explicit" request from Kate that the Cathy Demos not be released?

Actually I think I said that the request was from the "Bush family" 
but the item in question was actually printed by Homeground.  You 
yourself said that the item was presumably published at the request 
of the Bush family and I agree. I would be interested to know if you 
have changed your view on that.  

Further, the item does go so far as to say that Kate herself was 
"highly upset" about the release.  Perhaps calling this "explicit" 
is overstating the case but it would really be counter-productive 
for the Bush family to be too vehement on these issues.  

&gt; Not that IED disagrees with you about the willingness of some Kate fans
&gt; to rationalize their hunger for bootleg material. It's just that as
&gt; far as IED was aware, Kate's reaction to this whole business has been--
&gt; silence.

While I have never encountered any specific remarks from Kate herself,
I doubt that Homeground would characterize her as "highly upset" if
that were not the case.  Has anyone ever asked her about these directly?

&gt;      By the way, Richard, one Love-Hound recently posted that the
&gt; new issue of Little Light had come out.  

Actually I think you may have seen my report of LL's story about the
album delay and possible single.

&gt; IED was wondering (to second
&gt; Vickie's question) what the Cleveland convention's message from Kate
&gt; said.  The message _was_ reproduced in the latest issue, as promised,
&gt; wasn't it?

While I think it is perfectly reasonable to expect that they should
have produced it, unfortunately they did not.  I'm not sure that they 
ever specifically promised that they would.  Still, the only valid reason 
I could see for them not to have provided the information prior to this
time was that they wanted to save it for Little Light.   That is
certainly the impression they gave me.  

I have sent mail to the people at LL and AATHP asking them to please
post the text of the message to the group as soon as possible.  In 
fairness to them some of the stories in this issue seem to have been 
severely edited for space reasons.  If the quote was edited out for 
space reasons or because its general content is now old news, I think 
it was poor judgement.
