<PRE>
Vickie here.

Thanks for the _Personal Call_ Ron, it's pretty close to me because it
was the first spoken word interview I ever heard (the first time I had
ever heard Kate speak) when I got it in 1982.

Ya ha ha! Besides the playing of "Maybe" of course, this is always my 
favorite part of _Personal Call_:

&gt; Ed: Very positive, are you Jim? 

&gt; Jim: Ah, yes.  Hello Kate! 

&gt; K: Hello. 

&gt; Jim: There's just one thing I'd like to say just before I start
&gt; talking to Kate.  I'd like to, on behalf of myself and my family, thank
&gt; Radio 1 for making it possible that we are able to speak to Kate tonight.
&gt; And I praise God, you know, because there is only one and He's in charge 
&gt; of all of us. [Kate Laughs] And I'd like to thank all the BBC and the
&gt; trouble that they've gone to in putting on this program.
  
&gt; Ed: Thank you.  You're not the head of Radio Scotland are you?

&gt; [Kate laughs]

&gt; Jim: Ah, well you've heard of Brother Jim?  

&gt; Ed: [Laughs]  Anyway Jim.  Thanks for your call. Was there anything
&gt; you wanted to ask Kate?

&gt; Jim: Well, I would like to ask Kate... Well I believe I already 
&gt; have the answer... I would like to ask Kate if she believes in God?

&gt; K: Believe in God?  Well I think there are a lot of Gods and I
&gt; certainly believe in my God, but I wonder if it's the same God as yours.

&gt; Jim: Well, I believe that it is.  Do you believe in the Lord Jesus
&gt; Christ?

&gt; K: I believe in him, but he's not the one I live my life by, I must admit.

&gt; Jim: We, as Christians, we do believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and I know
&gt; know for a fact that if you believe in God and he has it written that the
&gt; only way to him is through the Lord Jesus Christ then I believe that your
&gt; God is the same as mine. 

&gt; K: So do I.  I believe if you believe in anything... I mean if God is
&gt; really... I hate to say this because it sounds blasphemous, but God is in
&gt; fact some kind of label for people to put all their belief and love into.
&gt; And I think that if people put all their belief and love into other people
&gt; and what they're doing, then I think you do find it, I think you do reach
&gt; an aim.  

&gt; Ed: Alright, Kate.  Thank you Jim for your call! 

&gt; Jim: Well, um...

&gt; Ed: No, um we've got loads of calls on the line so I'll have to cut
&gt; your short there.  But that you very much for your interest. 

&gt; K: Thanks, Jim! 

&gt; Ed: There he goes, alright back to you Sue. 

Kate says some pretty darn silly things in the show, but this was really
cool. Such a diplomat! I still rank PC up there among interviews just 
because she gives lots of interesting tidbits, such as Kashka's origins,
not having a middle name and the above. Not to mention it's the *ONLY*
time "Maybe" has ever been heard. Thanks again Ron.

Oh, was it mentioned that _Personal Call_ was BBC's first ever radio
call-in show? For Kate to be chosen as the first guest was quite wonderful!
