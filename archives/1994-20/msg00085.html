<PRE>
       THIS IS THE LAST CALL FOR "THE LOVEHOUNDS COLLECTION," the Summer 1994 
Tapetree.  

       As described in last Sunday's Announcement (July 10), it consists of 
two two-hour tapes' worth of Kate Bush broadcast appearances between 1979 and 
1993, including the complete 1979 Christmas Show "Kate," the De Efteling 
videos, and many of her very best interviews, including the very rare 
unedited "Night Flight" interview from 1985.  All have been mastered by Chris 
Williams from 3/4" PAL sources to SVHS, and all dubmasters of the set have 
been made on professional equipment from the SVHS submaster by Tom Estes.

       The collection is available only as the complete two-tape set, and if 
you are interested, **THIS IS THE WEEK TO ACT**!!  Instructions below tell 
you whom to contact depending on where you live.  One person is the 
designated contact for each country.  You email that person, who will reply 
with detailed instructions on how to proceed, and will assign you to the most 
convenient subdub person for your location and technical needs.  In general, 
what you will do is send a self-addressed stamped return mailer, together (in 
most cases--see specific directions below) with two blank tapes, to that 
subdub site.

       NO ONE WHO HAS NOT RECEIVED A SUBDUB ASSIGNMENT BY MONDAY, JULY 25, 
CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE TAPETREE!  If you have not received an assignment by 
that date, so that you can send off your return mailer and blanks that day, 
then there is virtually NO chance that your tape can be made and returned in 
time for Katemas--which is the target date for the Tapetree to be completed.

       Besides the symbolic value of concluding the exercise by that date, 
everyone should be aware that one of the things that makes it manageable for 
the people in the production side of the Tapetree to participate is the 
*finite time* that they dedicate to the project.  Indeed, as of this writing 
several of our smaller subdub sites are saturated and closed, and others will 
close this week, even before July 25.

       SO IF YOU WANT THESE TAPES, ACT NOW!

WHAT TO DO

       Determine whether you reside in Canada, the US, the UK/Europe (PAL 
only), or Australia.

*      USA:

              All Tapetree Leaves in the USA will be assigned to subdub sites 
       by Cindy Loiselle, who will centralize and rationalize the process 
       according to your technical needs, the copy capacity of the various 
       sites, and geographical proximity.

              Email to Cindy Loiselle at:

                     cindy@aai.com   &lt;NB:  This site does *not* respond to 
                                     FINGER&gt;

       stating (i) the technical specs for the kind of tape you want (SVHS, 
       VHS, Hi8, Beta), stereo or mono; (ii) the State you reside in.

              Cindy will reply by sending you the surface mail address of the 
       subdub site to which you are assigned.  You will then send two blank 
       T120 tapes in a self-addressed, *stamped* return mailer to that 
       address.  Please be considerate and use decent quality tape.  Your 
       return mailer should carry *stamps* for the postage required for the 
       level of service you prefer.  Metered postage stickers are strictly 
       speaking only valid on the date they are issued.

              I strongly recommend that you buy a #5 padded mailer for your 
       return mailer, and use 2nd day Priority for both legs of the journey. 
       The two tapes plus mailers and inserts do come in under the 2 lb 
       weight limit, so the postage is the basic Priority stamp @ $2.90.  For 
       the outgoing trip to your subdub, you can use a large manilla 
       envelope, a #6 or 7 padded mailer, or perhaps easiest, one of the 
       Priority Mail envelopes available at the Post Office.

**     CANADA

              The Tapetree has virtually unlimited capacity in Canada due to 
       the generosity of David Zimmerly and the company he works for, who are 
       allowing him to use professional equipment to dub directly from a 
       BetaCAM master provided by Chris Williams.  David is on vacation until 
       July 25, but will reply to email starting this Monday or Tuesday, July 
       18 or 19.  Indicate whether you need SVHS, Beta, or 8mm mono, in email 
       to David Zimmerly at:

              am672@FreeNet.Carleton.CA

       Because David is using professional, high capacity company equipment 
       (with his boss's blessing) and needs to be sure that only quality 
       blank stock runs over the heads, FOR THIS SUBDUB SITE ONLY there is a 
       special procedure.  Once David has sent you his surface address, you 
       will send him an SAS return mailer with postage for two T120 tapes 
       (plus the weight of the mailer and five sheets of paper).  But 
       *instead of mailing him blank tape stock*, you will send him a money 
       order for $16 &lt;Canadian obviously&gt; to cover the cost of blank tape and 
       time on the pro dub machines.  Please use money orders or other demand 
       instruments (certified checks, bank drafts, etc.), not personal 
       checks!  And not cash!

***    UK/EUROPE

              Cheers for Adrian Neal, with whom we have been able to lash 
       together a subdub site for the UK and PAL users in Europe (with extra 
       effort by Chris Williams--thanks, Chris).  Adrian's tapes are due 
       there Wednesday, July 20, so it is not too soon too contact him if you 
       haven't already:

                     aneal@cix.compulink.co.uk

       We don't at present have the capability of making SECAM copies; anyone 
       who can make SECAMs from NTSC or PAL should contact Adrian or me 
       immediately.

****   AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND

              Many thanks to Graham Dombkins for being available to serve the 
       tapetree needs in Oz.  Graham has high capacity, but can only make VHS 
       mono.  If you want stereo, you'll need to have NTSC playback 
       capability and to be willing to buy the postage both ways to use one 
       of the North American subdub sites.  Otherwise, send email to Graham 
       at:

              GRAHAM.G.R.DOMBKINS@msm.bhp.com.au

       He will reply with the surface mail address to use, and after that the 
       same procedure as in the US will apply:  you will send him your two 
       blank tapes in a SAS return mailer.

       Reports reaching me at this halfway point indicate people are happy 
with the tapes.  You wanna be happy?  Act NOW!
