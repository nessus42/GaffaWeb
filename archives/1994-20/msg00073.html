Being new to the list I thought that I should explain the details of
how I came to be enthralled with Kate's music.

When I was in eighth grade, a Canadian video show called _Video Hits_
showed the video for "Running Up That Hill" on their Friday request
show.  This was right around the time that _The Sensual World_ came
out.  She had been getting alot of press from _Rolling Stone_ because
of the album, but I had still never heard a thing by her.  When I heard
Running up that hill I fell in love with the song.  I went out that
very weekend and bought a tape of _The Whole Story_ and was instantly
disappointed.  I hated Kate Bush.  I was in eighth grade and my world
revolved around Madonna and George Michael-- Kate Bush just didn't cut
it.  The only songs that I liked on the entire album were "Running Up
That Hill" and "Army Dreamers" and "Wuthering Heights" because Pat
Benatar had done it on her _Crimes of Passion_ album.  Beyond that I
hated the whole thing.  I went through four years of only listening to
"Running Up That Hill", which I had copied onto another cassette, and
that was it.

Then, last summer, I became enthralled with Tori Amos.  _Little
Earthquakes_ spoke to every emotion I was feeling at the time, and I
began to ravenously listen to anything with Tori's name on it.
Somewhere in there I began to remember Kate, and I stumbled across the
CD of _The Hounds Of Love_ one day and bought it on a whim.  All of a
sudden Kate clicked for me.  _The Hounds Of Love_ was quickly folloed
by a CD copy of _The Whole Story_ and then _The Sensual World_.  _The
Red Shoes_ came out and I bought it on the same day that the Columbia
House order of _Never Forever_ came in.  Over Christmas Break I found
_The Dreaming_, _The Kick Inside_, and _LionHeart_.  I also have found
the US CD singles for "Eat the Music", "Rubberband Girl", and the UK
singles of "Moments of Pleasure" and "The Red Shoes (I and II)".  I
love Kate now.  She fits perfectly into my current musical tastes in
which George Michael is a geek who takes himself to seriously and
Madonna's main value is her ability to shock.  Kate has a new and fresh
way of looking at things that really energizes her music and she keeps
me hooked.  This weekend I am journeying into Canada to track down
_This Woman's Work_ and anything else that I can manage to find.  Long
live Her Majesty The Cloud Buster and may we all live to become
Rubberband People!!!!!!

Carlton
