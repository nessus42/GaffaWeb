       I mention that this tracklist is `abbreviated' because all Leaves 
(distribution copies) will come with 5 printed sheets, with cut-out outlines 
and fold lines, that provide:
 
       a)     A tapebox top and edge title sheet, with photos, for each of 
       Tape A and Tape B

       b)     A tapebox back tracklist with realtime counter index for each 
       track, for each of Tape A and Tape B

       c)     A slip-in brochure for each of Tape A and Tape B, compiled and 
       adapted and, in a few places &lt;flinch!&gt; corrected by yours truly, 
       providing full historical details and comments by Andy Marvick from 
       The Garden.

You have to do your own cut-and-paste on these, but hey:  "we all sing" on 
this one!

WHAT TO DO

       Determine whether you reside in Canada, the US, or Australia.

*      USA:

              All Tapetree Leaves in the USA will be assigned to subdub sites 
       by Cindy Loiselle, who will centralize and rationalize the process 
       according to your technical needs, the copy capacity of the various 
       sites, and geographical proximity.

              Email to Cindy Loiselle at:

                     cindy@aai.com

       stating (i) the technical specs for the kind of tape you want (SVHS, 
       VHS, Hi8, Beta), stereo or mono; (ii) the State you reside in.

              Cindy will reply by sending you the surface mail address of the 
       subdub site to which you are assigned.  You will then send two blank 
       T120 tapes in a self-addressed, *stamped* return mailer to that 
       address.  Please be considerate and use decent quality tape.  Your 
       return mailer should carry *stamps* for the postage required for the 
       level of service you prefer.  Metered postage stickers are strictly 
       speaking only valid on the date they are issued.

              I strongly recommend that you buy a #5 padded mailer for your 
       return mailer, and use 2nd day Priority for both legs of the journey. 
       The two tapes plus mailers and inserts do come in under the 2 lb 
       weight limit, so the postage is the basic Priority stamp @ $2.90.  For 
       the outgoing trip to your subdub, you can either use a #6 or 7 padded 
       mailer, or perhaps easier, one of the Priority Mail envelopes 
       available at the Post Office.

**     CANADA

              Canadian participants have one additional consideration.  The 
       Tapetree has one VHS stereo site ready to go right away (Tippi Chai), 
       but with relatively low capacity.  If for one reason or another it is 
       urgent that you get your tape ASAP, then email Cindy Loiselle at the 
       same address:

                     cindy@aai.com

       and indicate that you are in Canada.  Cindy will put you in contact 
       with Tippi Chai on a first-come, first-served basis, up to his site 
       capacity.  Follow the same procedure as outlined for the USA:  send 
       him two blank T120 tapes in a self-addressed stamp return mailer, with 
       postage for the level of service you require.

              If you can deal with getting your tape just before Katemas, the 
       Tapetree has virtually unlimited capacity in Canada due to the 
       generosity of David Zimmerly and the company he works for, who are 
       allowing him to use professional equipment to dub directly from a 
       BetaCAM master provided by Chris Williams.  David is on vacation until 
       July 25, but can reply to email starting July 18 or 19.  If you need 
       SVHS, Beta, or 8mm mono in Canada, or if you want to get your copy 
       from a BetaCAM submaster and can deal with the delay--or if you wanted 
       to get an early copy via Tippi Chai and Cindy Loiselle reported him 
       closed--send email to David Zimmerly at:

              am672@FreeNet.Carleton.CA

       Because David is using professional, high capacity company equipment 
       (with his boss's blessing) and needs to be sure that only quality 
       blank stock runs over the heads, FOR THIS SUBDUB SITE ONLY there is a 
       special procedure.  Once David has sent you his surface address, you 
       will send him an SAS return mailer with postage for two T120 tapes 
       (plus the weight of the mailer and five sheets of paper).  But 
       *instead of mailing him blank tape stock*, you will send him a money 
       order for $16 &lt;Canadian obviously&gt; to cover the cost of blank tape and 
       time on the pro dub machines.  Please use money orders or other demand 
       instruments (certified checks, bank drafts, etc.), not personal 
       checks!  And not cash!

              If you want to get your copy through David Zimmerly, go ahead 
       and send email right away.  Just be aware that he will not reply until 
       after July 18, and that he will make his production run July 25.  
       While waiting to get his address back, you can get your tapes, 
       mailers, and money orders ready.

       AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND

              Many thanks to Graham Dombkins for being available to serve the 
       tapetree needs in Oz, and to Chris Williams for making an ad hoc 
       master to PAL.  Graham has high capacity, but can only make VHS mono. 
       If you want stereo, you'll need to have NTSC playback capability and 
       to be willing to buy the postage both ways to use one of the North 
       American subdub sites.  For PAL, however, you'll have the advantage of 
       a direct mastering from 3/4" PAL originals that have not gone through 
       conversion.  Send email to Graham at:

              GRAHAM.G.R.DOMBKINS@msm.bhp.com.au

       He will reply with the surface mail address to use, and after that the 
       same procedure as in the US will apply:  you will send him your two 
       blank tapes in a SAS return mailer.
 

END OF ANNOUNCEMENT

       Note that while the Tapetree schedule has been set to ensure that all 
Leaves arrive by Katemas, *you have a lot to do with that by the level of 
postal service you pre-pay for the SAS return mailer!*  All of us in Dispatch 
and Production will do our level best to turn your tapes around quickly, but 
we won't be able to add postage to upgrade your return service.  Especially 
for the USA, the $2.90 for Second Day Priority is a good investment.

       I hope I have been clear enough to avoid confusion.  But if anyone 
anywhere doesn't understand what to do next, feel free to email me directly.

       THIS TAPETREE CLOSES MONDAY, JULY 25, 1994.  No one who has not been 
assigned a subdub site by that date can be served.  There will be one BRIEF 
second Announcement of the Tapetree Sunday, July 17.  If you are reading this 
and are interested, *save this message now*.

       Let hundreds of lovehounds rejoice together on Katemas 1994!
