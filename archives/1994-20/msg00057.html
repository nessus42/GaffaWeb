Speaking of dreams . . . I've had several.  Once I dreamed that I walked 
into a record store in my old neighborhood and they had hundreds of 
totally unknown Kate singles for $1.00 each.

When I woke up I went to the store and they actually had a sealed, marble 
HOL w/stickers for $5.99.  They had bought out the stock of a record 
store that went out of business; this stuff had been in storage for five 
years.  Unfortunately someone at a party opened the album up and put it 
on the turntable, even though the CD of HOL was sitting right there 
staring them in the face.  Fortunately I caught them about midway through 
RUTH and returned the thing to its sleeve.  I could have died.

That same record store was where I found the Cloudbusting promo CD for 
$1.75.  This was before I was a diehard and I didn't know what it was; 
neither did they.  

Another Kate dream involved diving in the Caribbean.  I'd been living on 
a yacht with some friends and scuba diving for weeks.  We were near some 
small island whose only use was as a convention center.  A fishing boat 
came by and told us Kate was giving an interview and talking with fans at 
this convention center.  We swam over but missed the whole thing.  I sat 
down at the conference table in my wetsuit and suddenly an echo of the 
whole conference replayed itself for me, except everyone was slightly 
transparent like TV ghosts. (television, not transvestite)

So I got to see Kate anyway, in my dream, once removed from live.  Weird!

Anyone else out there?  Let's do a book . . . who cares who dreams about 
Madonna.
