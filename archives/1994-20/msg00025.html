                      ANNOUNCING:          &lt;BRAH DAH!&gt;
                                      
                         THE SUMMER 1994 TAPETREE:
                                      
                     ** "The Lovehounds Collection" **
                               Tapes A and B


       Quietly, cordially, and efficiently over the weeks since the London 
Konvention, the Summer 1994 Tapetree has been taking shape, and with great 
pleasure I hereby make the Official Announcement!

       The four-hour two tape compilation video, "The Lovehounds Collection," 
is the fruit of perhaps the mightiest intercontinental collaborative project 
ever accomplished by this newsgroup.  The concept emerged over the past year 
in conversations and correspondence among Chris Williams, Andy Marvick, Uli 
Grepel, and myself, and now--with notable assistance from Tom Estes and Cindy 
Loiselle, plus eleven others who are serving as subdub sites--it is presented 
for your enjoyment.

       Copies are available in SVHS, VHS stereo, VHS mono, Hi8, Beta, 3/4", 
and--in Oz--PAL.  There are two sites in Canada, eleven in the USA, and one 
in Australia.  An adaptation of last year's procedure should be clearer, 
easier, and more efficient.  All of you who participate should have your 
copies by Katemas.

THE LOVEHOUNDS COLLECTION

       Many of us have four, five, even six or more tapes that include 
various TV performances, lipsynchs, and interviews that Kate Bush has done 
over the years.  Most of these are of low video and audio quality, are full 
of redundancies, or were slapped together in haste (e.g. last year's Aspel 
Tapetree).  This time we wanted to bring together the most essential and 
entertaining of these clips (e.g. Kate with Sue Simmons on "Live at 5" NOT!), 
arrange them nicely (e.g. another "87 versions of Wuthering Heights" NOT!), 
and circulate them in the highest possible technical quality.

       What we've come up with is not perfect in any of these dimensions.  
But it is very, very good.  Any of you think you have seen it all?; there are 
going to be several things here you have never seen.  And the quality on the 
things you *have* seen is going to turn your cherished prizes into blanks for 
time-shifting old movies.

       Everything in the following abbreviated tracklist has been mastered to 
SVHS (also BetaCAM and PAL VHS) by Chris Williams from 3/4" PAL sources on 
professional equipment.  All dubmastering has been from the best SVHS 
submaster, on professional equipment, by Tom Estes.  Half of the 13 North 
American subdub sites are working from SVHS dubmasters.  Leaves on this tree 
are going to be, in effect, about one and one half generations away from 
master quality.
