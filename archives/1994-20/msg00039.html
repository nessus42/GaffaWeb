<PRE>
       Enquiring email was already arriving before Tuesday's Lovehounds 
Digest brought a post from Marcel Rijs &lt;mfgr@sara.nl&gt;:

&gt; Hey!
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds interesting... the video tapetree I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; BUT
&gt; 
&gt; Has Europe disappeared???
&gt; What happened to Europe!????
&gt; 
&gt; EUROPE's GONE!

       True enough.  Europe and the UK &lt;be kind to an amurican if I write 
"Europe `and' the UK"&gt; were absent from the Tapetree Announcement, whose 
procedure portion began:

&gt; WHAT TO DO
&gt; 
&gt;      Determine whether you reside in Canada, the US, or Australia.

Not just Marcel quickly found that they could determine None of The Above.

       Here's why:  Chris Williams spoke to the issue,

&gt;    We didn't have any volunteers from Europe or the UK to serve as the
&gt; dubbing site. It doesn't make any sense to try to make PAL and SECAM
&gt; copies in the US to send across the Atlantic Ocean. 

       Functionally, it really is that simple.  The initial call for subdub 
participants in the Summer 1994 Tapetree that I posted in early June yielded 
two sites in Canada, one high-capacity site in Australia, and eleven sites in 
the USA.  Neither Tom Estes nor I received any volunteers from Europe/UK.  
Tapetree distribution is not like marketing; we went with what we had, and 
didn't beat the bushes.

       Speaking for myself, however, I think we had a blind spot.  I 
interpreted the apparent lack of interest from UK/European lovehounds as an 
indication that in PAL areas, these things were not that rare and more or 
less flowed like water.  Now better informed, thanks to several UK colleagues 
who have stepped in with offers to help fill the vacuum at this late date, I 
am happy to report that steps have been taken to FILL THE HOLE.

       For those of you who have determined that you do *NOT* live in the US, 
Canada, or Australia, but rather in UK/European PAL/SECAM lands:

        * * * * WATCH THIS SPACE FOR IMMINENT ANNOUNCEMENTS! * * * *

Two PAL sets of "The Lovehounds Collection" are being generated so that 
UK/European lovehounds can be part of the Tapetree and its promise of 
delivery by Katemas.  Arrangements are being lashed together even as I write, 
with the expectation we can announce a UK/European email address before the 
end of the week.

       Please be assured that your absence from the map of the Announcement 
was not because you were thought to be a Void, but rather a Plenum.  
Everything we in the peripheral places have organized ourselves to circulate 
*originated* in the UK and has been preserved in Europe.  Stay tuned:  you 
are not forgotten or abandoned!
