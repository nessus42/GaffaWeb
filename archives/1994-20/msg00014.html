Can someone recognize any of following lyrics? Any guess/info VERY 
appreciated...


Song #1:

Some store; I'm not going back there any more
I wandered in, don't think I'll do that again,
No; I don't think I'll do that again
I swear; Look at me crosseyed, 
And I don't know what to do
No; I don't know what to do...
Crazy...

Some store; I'm not going back there any more
I wandered in, don't think I'll do that again,
No; I don't think I'll do that again
I swear; Look at me crosseyed, 
And I don't know what to do
No; I don't know what to do...
Crazy....

Song #2:

I could get a peace of me,
from a parentry,
Nothing ever spoiled on me.
You brought this, you deepshit,
Nothing ever spoiled on me.

Bad cloud storms around my house,
Does whatever it pleases;
It teases me

What the hell;
Never was a bare at one,
Till you stepped in,
Never drive my halters on the line,
This hairdo's truly evil,
I'm not sure it's mine.
You're so tall
It's like I claim the waterfall

Bad cloud storms around my house,
Does whatever it pleases;
It teases me

What I said was get me a drink, all right?
What am I supposed to sit,
And look at you all night
All girls cry; like I said I don't know why

Bad cloud storms around my house,
Does whatever it pleases;
It teases me

Never was a bare at one,
Till you stepped in,
Never drive my halters on the line,
This hairdo's truly evil,
I'm not sure it's mine.
You're so tall
It's like I claim the waterfall


Song #3:

Who are you, I can't remember your name,
Where am I, what was I gonna say,
What's the time, what day is it today,
I feel fine, I'll probably be okay..

Have a ????, and have spaghetti ????
Mommy is back, she's gonna tuck you into night
Mommy is sorry, she gave you such a fright,
Mommy is home, she's gonna be alright.

Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
She's talking to herself,
Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
She's gonna go to hell.

Reailize she's in a different place,
Realize her lack of social grace,
She can take the smile off his face,
He wants to take her
somewhere she'll be safe.

Set the table, dancing on the table,
Clearer place, because she is unable; mable.
He looks at her and wanders where she is.
She smiles a little, and tells him she is his.

Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
And take her far away,
Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
Check up that lady,
The devil made her hair.


Song #4:

Hot ????
Move things
I write on his wall
I have no mind at all
Hot things
Move him

I write on his wall
I have no heart at all

I think she's a pretty little fool,
She holds me down, she flows.
She has a back like Marie.
I think he's a crazy bastard,
Drives me home, he goes,
You have a back like Marie
You have pearls on your eyes,

And you use your burning
to wrap yourself
And you use your fever
to hide yourself away,
And you use your sweating
to keep me down,
And you use your heat
to have me,
And you use your fire 
to be stronger than me,
And you use your flame 
against me.

I won't come back like Marie

These pearls on my eyse,
These pearls on my eyes, 
They make me blind

I write on your wall
I have no eyes at all.
