Hi,
 
&lt;s0pdfm@assam.exnet.com (P D Fitzgerald-Morris)&gt; writes:
&gt; &gt; Complete, should be true). In the Garden it's stated she only
&gt; &gt; performed WH twice on TOTP though - so that would be a mistake.
&gt; &gt; It should be at least 3 times if what PDFM claims is true.
&gt;
&gt; My friend, I don't "claim" anything. Kate appeared four times on
&gt; TOTP when "Wuthering Heights" was at no.1. She appeared at
&gt; leastonce  before. The "red slacks" performance was her first
&gt; ever appearance BEFORE the single was no.1. I saw it!
 
Hmmm... do I detect some irritation here? Please don't take my
"claim" quote too harshly - it's just that, as they say, "seeing is
believing"... And I didn't ever see it!

&gt; re:  Dr. marcEL rIjs's LaudAble Notes About totp wh; &amp;hg52
 
I always goT the capS NOTes ied usEd but this one is A mySterY to
me... :)
 
&gt; The obvious explanation of the problem Marcel has so deftly put
&gt; before the philocanine community is that IED's entries in The
&gt; Garden for TotP performances of WH are, indeed, *wrong*. (There
&gt; are, alas! many other such inaccuracies in that nevertheless
&gt; worthy text.)
 
...Which every LoveHound should read and own IMNSHO!
 
[...]
&gt; Not just two TotP appearances were made by Kate Bush in early
&gt; 1978 -- there were at least four, and it seems probable that
&gt; there were five!
 
That's nice to know, but not a very comforting thought... :-} (We
must track it all down...?!)
 
&gt; Peter's description of a red-trousers version is certainly
&gt; accurate, although as far as IED knows there is no available
&gt; video-recording of this first appearance.  As Marcel correctly
&gt; supposes, this version dates from before the single had reached
&gt; No. 1 on the charts. There are probably four more TotP
&gt; appearances (in addition to airings of the official video). Of
&gt; these, IED has seen two, one of which (possibly appearance No. 4)
&gt; shows Kate standing in a long, more or less plain black dress.
 
...on a round platform (pedestal ;) surrounded by astounded
teenagers then not yet contaminated by housemusic and MTV? That's
one I have.
 
&gt; The other (perhaps appearance No. 2, only part of which is known
&gt; to IED) has Kate in a white dressing-gown, and looks a good deal
&gt; like the official (post-Rockflix) video.  This is the version of
&gt; which an excerpt was later shown on the 1978 Ask Aspel
&gt; appearance. Of the two remaining TotP appearances, IED hopes and
&gt; believes that one or both of these were among the two versions
&gt; that were recently aired in a re-run of TotP (referred to by
&gt; Marcel above). One (perhaps TotP appearance No. 3?) features Kate
&gt; seated at the piano while singing the song.
 
That's another one I have - which completes my WH - TOTP
collection.
 
 
&gt; IED has no definite information about the fifth appearance, if,
&gt; as seems likely, it occurred.
&gt; IED would greatly appreciate from Marcel a detailed description
&gt; of the two TotP versions which were recently shown again on TV in
&gt; Europe.
 
Those were the two you mentioned. BTW they were aired on UK Gold
which is only available in the UK and to European citizens with a
satellite dish and - I think - a decoder.
 
&gt; Still another live clip of this song from the 13/14 May 1979
&gt; (Hammersmith) concerts may have been shown in June 1979 in a
&gt; Dutch television film called Countdown Special, although as this
&gt; programme has still not been seen or heard by IED, he cannot say
&gt; whether the song was included.
 
"Countdown special" was in fact a popmusic program called
"Countdown", and if this info is right they would've made a special
program about Kate Bush. I will check with the responsible
broadcasting organization.
 
&gt; And, finally, as far as IED knows, Kate may have performed the
&gt; song during her (as yet untraced) appearances on Voor de Vuist
&gt; Weg and the 1978 San Remo music festival (televised in Italy).
&gt; Btw, what does Voor de Vuist Weg mean?
 
My sister (she's 6 year older than I, she should remember) is quite
sure she did "Wuthering Heights" at the "Voor de vuist weg"
program. Berend already explained about the title (thanks, B. ;) as
did I a few months ago.
 
&gt; Thus, in total, certainly thirteen, probably at least fourteen,
&gt; and possibly as many as sixteen different performances of
&gt; Wuthering Heights have been committed to video-tape.
 
?that's a lot. we should, kNowing all this, be able to comE a long
way uPon comPiling the official lovehounds kAte bush video
cHronology. do leT's.
 
of course I am aLso LookIng forWarD to the next EditIon of the
garden.
