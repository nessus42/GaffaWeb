       ELUSIVE KATE BUSH FILM to be SHOWN IN SHEPHERDSTOWN, WV

KATE BUSH's *The Line, The Cross, and the Curve*, A Film Starring Kate
Bush, Miranda Richardson, and Lindsay Kemp (35mm UK 1993 55 minutes
written/directed by Kate Bush)

Last year British singer-songwriter Kate Bush produced a theatrical
film to amplify the themes contained in her 1993 SONY album The Red
Shoes.  Unfortunately, although this film has appreciated extended
runs in the United Kingdom, it has essentially been shown only at film
festivals in the US.  Intergalactic Garage, long time supporter of
Kate Bush's work and of her North American fans, has arranged for a
showing of this film at The Opera House Movie Theater in
Shepherdstown, WV.  The Opera House Movie Theater, with its
state-of-the-art projection system and 2000 Watt JBL/Dolby
SurroundSound system, will allow Kate Bush fans to see and hear this
work - which is full of song and dance - as never before possible in
this country - and in the fashion Kate Bush intended when she chose
35mm rather than VHS video as a medium.

The film stars Ms Bush, critically acclaimed British actress Miranda
Richardson (The Crying Game), and legendary dancer/mime, Lindsay Kemp.

WES JOHNSON, popular disk-jockey of WHFS, the Washington-Baltimore
Megalopolis' major alternative radio station, will host the 5 pm
showing.

SONY MUSIC has provided several high-quality limited edition
lithographs of the cover of Kate Bush's The Red Shoes and other
collectible goodies for door prizes at the 5 pm show.

Nearly 8 hours of Kate Bush's hard-to-find music videos and rare
performance videos will be shown on Saturday at other locations in
Shepherdstown. (TBA) There is no charge to see the videos.

This event will be enjoyed by anyone who likes progressive British
rock.  It should be of interest to film buffs.  The Upper Potomac
Hammered Dulcimer Festival will be occuring in Shepherdstown this same
weekend, making a real bonus for the music buff who comes to
Shepherdstown.

When:       5 PM September 10, 1994

Where       Opera House Movie Theater 
            131 W. German Street 
            Shepherdstown, WV
            (Just 8 Miles North of Charles Town, WV, 
            site of the 1994 Wash.-Balt. Area Lollapalloza)

Tickets     Tickets available from Intergalactic Garage by phone at 
            (304) 876-6818 or at the Opera House box office.
            All Seats $10 (additional showings may be available)
        
Shepherdstown, the oldest town in West Virginia, is a historic
district situated on a bluff above the Potomac. It is cosmopolitan in
nature, offering many interesting opportunities in dining, lodging,
recreation and entertainment.  Shepherdstown is easily accessible from
I-70 and I-81.

Intergalactic Garage is a world famous collector's record store with a
store front in the Shepherdsown Historic district. This company was
created in 1982 to provide a mail order source for Kate Bush music for
North American fans. Subsequently, Intergalactic expanded to support
the fans of many other European singer/songwriters and is currently
one of the best sources in North America for recordings that are not
available in the mall stores.
