In a previous article, steve.b@TQS.COM (Steve Berlin) says:

&gt;
&gt;Yes, Kate has aknowledged us (proof:  Look at the back of the Official
&gt;Love-Hounds T-shirt, plug plug), but am I the only one who gets the impression
&gt;that she thinks of fans as something that's insignificant at best and an
&gt;annoyance at worst?

I don't think "insignificant" is the right word --I think she probably
genuinely appreciates that her fans find some thing in her music worth
listening to.  After all, that's why she puts it out here, right?  I don't
think "annoyance" is right, either.  From all the interviews I've seen and
read, she's just too gracious a person to be annoyed by people who are so
smitten by her and her work.

The word that comes to my mind is "embarrassed."  My guess is that she finds
a lot of the intensity generated by her "fandom" is way over the top
--people "worshipping" her, publishing "diary" style responses to her
albums, making the study of "HER" and her music a mainstay of life... I get
the impression she finds it all a little too cloying.

I think I heard that, when asked if he was aware of an internet group that
discussed his work, elvis costello said something to the effect that they
sounded like "a bunch of nasty little trainspotters."  I can't imagine KB
expressing a sentiment like that, but it seems to me that most famous
songwriters have had some regrets about their most ardent followers --I know
I've seen Dylan and Neil Young mention it. 

As each year goes by without a Kate Bush tour, the mania among her most
fervent admirers grows stronger, which I expect puts her off all the more. 
My guess is that personal letters pleading for a tour (or for some more
personal kind of favor) only make her dread the prospect all the more.

Just my uninformed speculation.  Of course I don't know the woman as
intimately as many contributors to this list do.  No doubt they'll
straighten me out.   :)
