Uli responds to the brave, manly anonymous poster:
&gt;Hi Whoever!
&gt;
&gt;(why anonymous? You aren't the first one asking these questions!)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I remember some controversy with John &amp; Yoko, and (I belive) Judy
&gt;&gt; Collins appearing nude on album covers and insets. On "The Whole
&gt;&gt; Story" Kate is photographed from the shoulders up... are there any
&gt;&gt; other photos of her around?
&gt;
&gt;Of course, but no nude ones... ;-)

    Nude photos may well exist, but no one will ever see them. The _The
Whole Story_ photo may have been topless and cropped, but she was
probably wearing a tube-top. The photo was by her brother John. This
is a obvious advantage of having your photo taken by a member of your
family; no sneaky "candid" photos getting out from holes in the dressing
room.

    Kate has no interest in either exploiting herself or letting others
exploiting her. I personally do not believe that an artistic nude photo
*is* exploitation, only when it is without the consent of the person
being photographed. My family had a summer cabin in what we used to
call a "nudest colony." I understand that there is some new "PC" term
for the same thing.) So I grew up without the standard US belief that
nudity, in and of itself, is obscene or exploitive.

    She *has* considered nudity if it was artistically necessary. In
planning the _Breathing_ video, she mentioned that they had considered
doing it in the nude. Logical, as she was playing a baby in the womb.
But she said that "...it would send the wrong vibe." So she played the
part in a flesh-colored body suit wrapped in a plastic pseudo-placenta.

    Her opinions may have changed, but I suspect that she would appear
nude if some future film project of hers required it. But never to
sell records or gain publicity as many have done (no naming names.)

&gt;&gt; I remember reading an article about KB bootlegs; someone released 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; a 3-LP set from one of Kate's concerts, and the inside "art" of the
&gt;&gt; album-cover was a penthouse centerfold titled "Kate", evidently
&gt;&gt; they found a Kate-lookalike to pose for an issue released while
&gt;&gt; Kate was touring...
&gt;
&gt;Right.
&gt;
&gt;I think Kate once said she wouldn't do such photos.

   It was in a UK edition of _Penthouse_. They really tried to create
the wrong impression; the model's name was "Kate Simmons" and "...a
doctor's daughter." It did not appear in the US edition, further
showing that it was an attempt to cash in on "purient interest."
  
   BTW, before the advent of Princess Diana, Kate was apparently "the
most photgraphed woman in Great Britian." It's kind of amazing that
more paparatzi photos of her do not exist. Apparently, she does not
go to beaches and (after the "light stand bondage" photos) choses
who she lets photograph her carefully. She has become far more
protective of her "private self" in recent years. But Kate Bush
the artist will consider things that Kate Bush the person never
would. Whatever it's other flaws, that part of Fred Vermoral's
book "Princess Of Suburbia" is right on the mark.
