ied originally wrote this up last year, but with the recent releases of a 
number of additional bootlegged items, i thought i'd repost the my updated
list for your reading pleasure. thanks to ied for the stuff i originally
didn't know about...

-----

_wow_ : a two-record set containing a poor stereo dub of the hammersmith
odeon video's audio track and a mono dub of the bbc tv special _kate_ (one
on each record). this is probably the first KaTe booTleg, appearing in 1982 
or early 1983.
 
_moving_ : beautiful re-packaging of _wow_. equally poor audio though.
 
_live in paris_ : single lp containing excerpts of the paris concert.
 
_live in europe '79-'80_ : re-packaged three record set containing the three
lps that made up _wow_ and _live in paris_.
 
_a bird in the hand_ : a single lp containing excerpts of the hammersmith
odeon video (nine of the twelve tracks on the video)in poor stereo.
 
_temple of truth_ : single record containing excerpts of an unidentified
tour of life show.
 
_under the ivy bush_ : collection of dubs from tv performances and a few
excerpts from the mannheim and hamburg dates of the tour of life.
 
_dreamtime_ : a two record set containing a complete recording of one of
the london palladium dates. probably the best audio of any of the concert
bootlegs (barring the hammersmith cd dub). best known however for the nude
photos on the back, purported to be KaTe, but in fact, are kate simmons, a
penthouse model (damn bootleggers).
 
_if you could see me fly_ : single lp containing excerpts from the bill
duffield concert from 1979, features steve harley and peter gabriel (or-
ganized to benefit duffy's family following his death early in the tour).
also included two early demos of "babooshka."
 
_live in manchester_ : two record set featuring virtually the entire man-
chester concert, albeit in poor audio.
 
_live in bristol_ : two record set containing the entire bristol concert
as well as some bits of john cardnder bush's poetry. nice package, poor
audio.
 
_live in amsterdam_ : a single lp containing most of the aborted amsterdam
concert which was cut short due to KaTe's flu attack.
 
_moving_ : not the same as the aforementioned bootleg of the same name. this
7" ep contains KaTe's performance of "moving" at the seventh tokyo song fes-
tival in june of 1978 and her partially pre-recorded, partially live perfor-
mance of "the long and winding road" and "she's leaving home" (from japanese 
tv in 1978).
 
_burning desire_: a very poor transfer of the hammersmith video to cd. has
a nice portrait of KaTe on the inside of the jewel sleeve though.

_kate bush live_ : an excellent dub of the hammersmith show from the 
japanese laserdisc of the concert. also features her performance of "breathing"
from the comic relief concert in 1986 (from the video), "running up that hill"
the secret policeman's third ball (from the cd) and "this woman's work" from
the soundtrack of the movie "she's having a baby".
 
_the early demos_ : a largely mythical album containing ten recordings from
the first set of demo sessions with david gilmour. from these sessions, the
song "passing through air" was culled from release as the b-side from "army
dreamers." this album has never been seen by any love-hound, although
homeground editor peter fitzgerald-morris does produce a track listing.
 
_the cathy demos_ : a series of five 7" eps containing twenty-two demo 
recordings made by KaTe herself dating from probably around 1973. these demos
have become to be known as the "cathy demos."
 
_fiddle_ : a cassette containing all of the demos that appear in the _cathy
demos_ series of eps, excepting "organic acid".
 
_cathy's album_ : a single lp containing sixteen of the twenty-two tracks of
the _cathy demos_ eps. also released under the title _the sensual woman_.
 
_cathy's album too_ : the follow-up of the above record. contains the remainder
of the cathy demos through vol.5 (again excluding "organic acid") as well as
the so-called "kick inside demos". these were probably recorded as demos for 
that album and featiure the poppy "scares me silly" (mis-titled "really gets
me going".
 
_if you could see me fly_: a direct transfer of the _cathy's album_ lp to cd.
as such, audio is not any better. also includes the two "babooshka" demos in
equally so-so audio.

_passing through air_ : a two record set containing dubs of various b-sides
and remixes straight from the official emi singles and 12" singles. also
contains the performance of "let it be" by KaTe, peter gabriel and steve
harley at the bill diffield concert in 1979, the performance of "wedding
list" at the 1982 prince's trust gala concert from 1982 and "hounds of love"
from the 1985 british music awards. audio quality is poor to fair.
 
_backsides_ : a single lp containing a number of b-sides dubbed from the
singles. a british recording, the majority of these records may have been
seized in a bootleg bust overseas. audio is very good.
