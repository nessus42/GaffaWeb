<PRE>

After having picked my copy up yesterday I have the following to relate.

The box is quite attractive - black with gold writing and the new KT symbol in 
red.  I am not sure of the purpose of the stickers.  Are we supposed to put 
them on things so that other Katefans will spot them and make themselves 
immediately known?  The booklet is of high quality glossy paper and the photos 
are superb.  The album CDs are all UK EMI pressings except TD which is a 
Nimbus pressing.

The non-album discs are 46+ and 66+ mins long respectively.  The sound quality 
is wonderful after living with tapes of vinyl.  "Passing Through Air" is not 
as good as the other cuts in this respect but that is to be expected.  I am 
left wondering why the other 5 tracks were omitted from the set yet "Walk 
Straight Down the Middle" is repeated on the b-sides as well as TSW.  There 
was clearly room on disc 1.

I am glad I got my copy so quickly but wince when I realise I payed about $2 
for every minute of new to CD music.  For the KTneophyte it is ideal.  I am 
still peaved that I now have two import copies of all her albums.  I will 
compare sound quality and later decide whether to sell my separate discs.

Now I just have to try and pay off the credit cards.  That doesn't keep me 
awake at night yet.  I hope the Japanese set does not have more tracks.  That 
would make me simply livid with EMI.

I still prefer the version myself and IED offered.    

Till Later,

Derek
