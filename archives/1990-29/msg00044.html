val nozick asks about his name is alive.

hnia is made up of warren defever providing instrumentation and two friends
of his doing vocals: karin oliver and angela carozzo. also, for shows, two
other folks, known only as jymn and melissa, help out too.

they started out as warren and angela recording a cassette in 1987 that 
was pretty much ignored. this was in high school. in college, he met karin,
recorded some more which was also ignored. finally, they were noticed by
ivo watts-russell who eventually took it upon himself to remix their work
himself since warren was pretty much a technical know-nothing at the time.

warren says "it's like a fucked up minimal orchestra trying to play really
ethnic foreign folk music, arranged classically by an irresponsible youth,
and performed sloppily with guitars, voices and tape loops in a suburban
home in the middle of america."

he also adds "i mean, he took it all apart and didn't put it back together
again, i guess", with regards to ivo's remixing methods...

i guess they do shows in the michigan area on a random kind of basis. it'd
be nice if they did a real kind of tour though - i don't feel like going
to the american heartland to see them...

discography:

	"righteousness and apostrophe"		cassette	1987
	"his name is alive"			cassette	1987
	"i had sex with god"			cassette	1988
	"eutectic" (collaboration with fishcats on comission from
		harbringer dance company, detroit)		1989
	_livonia_				lp/cd/cass	1990

-----

on the prefab sprout debate. i picked up the new one about a month ago
and listened to it once. maybe i should listen again - yeah, i think i'll
go do that now...

-----

for those of you in the nyc area into 4ad bands, lush will be playing at
maxwell's on the 28th and the pixies will be playing at the ritz on the 30th.
see you all there - well, at maxweel's for certain...

maxwell's that is.

woj
