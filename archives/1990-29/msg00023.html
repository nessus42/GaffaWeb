well, it came. there it was sitting on my doorstep as i got home from
work today. pretty non-descript looking: just another package for mr
ups truck driver. but a heck of a hefty sum for me ($160) and a mess of
good feelings. opened it up, lifted it out of the box, took it out of
the shrinkwrap and studied it. interesting packaging. the damn lid
makes it unweildy on the shelf, but who cares? finally saw these sticker
things that everyone has been clamoring about. whoopee. popped in the
b-sides discs. enjoyed. was it worth it? yeah, i think so. it's nice to
have the majority of the b-sides in one place (well, two discs anyways).
it's nice to have the emi releases of the cds finally. but i just didn't
feel all that excited about the set now that i have it. i really wish
that emi had taken ied and derek's letter into account. i really wish
that many of the missing tracks had made it on. i really wish it was 
cheaper. i'm not remorseful, but i think i feel about it the same way
ied felt about the sylvian set. a happy kind of content, but wishing for
more. ever the american way, eh?

someone mentioned percy jones. he cancelled the show he had scheduled a
week before here in the nyc area. i was royally annoyed. drukman - you 
gotta see this guy or hear him. yow! hot bass player (plays custom five
string - interesting trivia if not musically pertinent). jones used to
be in brand x for thoise who don't know. he has a new album out called
_cape catastrophe_. it's a chronicle of teh last four or so years he has 
been touring as a solo act supported by synths. he has a "new" album of
stuff that has been collecting mold on the shelf coming in january
called _propeller music_ and sometime later next year, an album of new
material with a new trio.

um. yeah. right. carry on...

woj
