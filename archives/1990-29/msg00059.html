The Boxed Set :

Prices in the San Diego area :
$199.99, Off the Record, San Diego
$159.99, Lou's Records, Encinitas
$174.99, CD Sounds, San Diego 

Unfortunately I got to Lou's after I purchased the set from CD Sounds from 
which I ordered the set.  But, I did find the UK CD single of TSW meaning I 
don't have to get the US "Aspects.." disc (I avoid US pressings) for the TSW 
instrumental.

Off the Record had two copies of the box still (not surprising at that price).

So far I haven't had a chance to really compare the sound on the box CDs with 
my different import pressings of TKI(Nimbus), LH(Nimbus), NFE(Polygram Germany 
?) and HOL(EMI Japan).  I'll let you know how it turns out.       

I too am disappointed in the presentation of the box.  This is far from what 
IED and I proposed.  I feel royally screwed.  I can't believe Kate really 
supported this minimalist approach.  At least I have the b-sides on CD but I 
am still annoyed.  The same phenomenon is happening with other sets e.g. Soft 
Cell's 12 inch singles on 10 CD singles for $115. All could have fitted on two 
full length CDs.  What is the point of view of the record companies?  I am 
sure they depress sales and annoy people with such approaches.

If You Could See me Fly :

Woj, I am having difficulty getting email to you (it bounces after 4 days) 
hence this broadcast.

I dearly want a copy of this.  So far I have seen one copy, in LA, and they 
wanted $69.99 for it. I was incredulous.  Can anyone get me a copy?  San Diego 
stores are not carrying boots as there have been a number of police (Tower 
sponsored) raids lately.  I am willing to pay up to $30, plus the postage and 
packing.  If someone can help me I would really appreciate it.  Contact me by 
email.  Thanks.  I might even go up to $35.

To all of you going to the convention :

Have a great trip. I'll look forward to your stories.  I apologise in advance 
for the disgustingly filthy London Streets.  It is quite shaming.  If you 
don't look down you'll have a wonderful time (as long as you don't trip over 
something and fall flat on your face:-). 

Cheerio for now,

Derek
