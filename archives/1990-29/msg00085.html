[really nice apology deleted]

Aw shucks, you're the first person never to give me any guff about
this.  Is that a tear I see reflected in my monitor screen?

&gt;And no, I don't have all 
&gt;the instances at my fingertips; but I still think that "number of 
&gt;choreographical realizations" is a valid perspective on Kate's investment in 
&gt;her work.  She has often commented on the importance of visualization in her 
&gt;songs, both as a whole additional way to get them across, and in what she 
&gt;tries to do with live performance.

I'm not sure if I would, in the end, use "number of choreographical
realizatons" as a valid yardstick - the fact is, when Kate was a
younger, less-well-established artist, she had to get out more to
"sell the product."  (Note quotes indicating term is approximate, for
you damned purists out there.)  Nowadays, she's famous, everyone will
buy her album the instant it comes out, so she doesn't have to do the
hard sell.  Do you agree?  In other words, it might not be laziness or
decline, it might just be a case of "I don't have to hassle, so why
bother?"

&gt;Is it really misleading to set the four 
&gt;videos from TD and HOL (to stay with agreed facts) alongside the three from 
&gt;TSW, as evidence of declining invention or enthusiasm?

See above paragraph and ask yourself the question again.

&gt;I remember complaints 
&gt;in this very forum, both about the strength of the new videos, and about 
&gt;getting only three with the purchase as against four with "Hair of the 
&gt;Hound".

I, for one, would rather have one really great video than ten
half-assed ones.  I consider "Love and Anger" to be a half-assed
video.  Chris Williams' comments about the lighting being so stupid
that it MUST be a parody do not ring true for me.

&gt;&gt;Wow, it's been ages since I've gotten into a pointless and hostile
&gt;&gt;debate about katefaKTs!  Somebody help me, I'm having flashbacks...
&gt;
&gt;Mr. Drukman's independent-mindedness, sharp ear, and breadth of musical 
&gt;interest are one of the key strengths of this group.  I have always taken the 
&gt;tone of his flames to be affable pugnaciousness, and it was in that spirit 
&gt;that I set out to clarify my admittedly reckless hyperbole.  I've learned 
&gt;from the exchange; I am sorry if he's really hostile.

Affable pugnaciousness?  More like snide sarcasm, with wicked and
cynical overtones, covering up for a heart of pure marshmallow.  I,
like everyone else, went weak in the knees when I first heard that
creaky, wobbly, hissy tape of TSW.  Maybe my blinders just came off
faster. 

Of course I'm not really hostile.  You want to see REALLY hostile?
Dig up some old love-hounds archives (any file numbered under 30
should suffice.)  This is free love and hippy shit all the way, man.
Pass the peace pipe.
