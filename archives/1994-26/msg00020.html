<PRE>
Despite the claims by Cindy Palmano regarding the cover shoot quoted by
Kevin, it is simply unreasonable to argue (as Palmano nevertheless does) that
there was no influence, particularly when one acknowledges, as any reasonable
person must, the many other obvious signs of direct and indirect influence of
Kate Bush's songs, vocal inflections, vocal stylings, piano arrangements,
performance demeanor -- even clothing and hairstyle! -- that are evident in
those of "Tori Amos".  IED challenges anyone who doubts this to compare Kate
Bush's 1978 live performance of Kashka From Baghdad from the Ask Aspel
program, with Ms. Amos's live performance on the old Letterman show, and then
try to say that Ms. Amos wasn't influenced -- and strongly -- by her elder.
  

IED would venture to guess that Chris Williams remembers, just as does IED,
the last time Palmano's denials were related to Love-Hounds by Kevin.
 Chris's point was that the denial of any influence of the American cover
design of The Kick Inside on Palmano is untenable, and dishonest.  IED agrees
completely, and extends the accusation to Ms. Amos herself, since she was
clearly a partner in the conception both of cover design and of her own music
and performance style.  IED takes no position on whether either Palmano or
Amos is completely conscious of that influence, but he believes that they
ought to be, because, whether conscious or not, the influence is very real.

Please note, anyone concocting flames, that IED in no way impugns the quality
of Ms. Amos's work.  He ventures no opinion on that.  He simply declines to
accept the contention that that work is not, at some level, at least,
substantially influenced by the work of Kate Bush.  It's a matter of the
honesty of the artist, not the integrity of the art.  If it should turn out,
however, that Ms. Amos has indeed fully credited Kate Bush as the paramount
influence on her own work, then IED will humbly apologize to her and to all
her fans, and wish them all well.  There's certainly no dishonor in being a
leading member of the school of Kate Bush!  IED hopes Ms. Amos understands
that.
