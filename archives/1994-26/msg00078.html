Hi,

&gt; On AOL I am currently telling the KateFans there about FTPMail.
&gt; I had made this directory of most of the files on ftp.uwp.edu
&gt; which I'm sending to the Kate Folder there, when I thought it
&gt; might be of interest to the general public.  So here it is.
&gt; [Directory for ftp.uwp.edu Note: In all the following directory
&gt; listings, "..." should be replaced by /pub/music/lists/gaffa/
[etc, etc, etc....]
 
Does anyone have all these files &amp; directories downloaded? If so,
I'd like to close a deal with you... I'd like to get some
diskettes... :-)
Can anyone help me? I need KateInfo!
 
 
Now, on to the anAmosity discussion:
 
I had a rather pleasant encounter with a friend from Germany
yesterday and we were talking about how bad the Kate reference
turns out to be these days. KateFans scorn Tori and vice versa,
which is not a good thing, as they are as talented as eachother,
each in different ways.
You should've seen my reaction when i caught up with a week of
Love-Hounds and found the whole Kate-Tori discussion.

&gt; I enjoy these debates only up to the point where they become

Same here!
 
[...]
&gt; I get angry at the suggestion (in any form) that there is only
&gt; enough room on this planet for one female singer, and that anyone
&gt; who follows after is, of course, a clone and a rip/spin-off.
&gt; Kate may be God to some (she is to me) but there are *many*
&gt; wonderful female singer/songwriter/musicians, and there's plenty
&gt; of room in the world for them all.
 
Then &lt;IED0DXM@aol.com&gt; writes:
&gt; &gt; How it could be claimed her performance style comes from
&gt; &gt; Kate.It's just ludicrous!
[...]
&gt; He is a fierce, though humble, subscriber to the ancient Greeks'
&gt; broad concept of guilt and personal responsibility, by  virtue of
[blah blah blah.... ;) ]
 
Well, also following the Greeks, I'd like to state that I subscribe
to their beliefs that there was more than 1 God.
Tori is as much as Kate is. They both really *are*.... :-)
 
(Happy is another one, BTW, as is Kim... And Milla could turn out
to be one too...)
 
A little more tolerance wouldn't be too much to ask, now, would it?
 
Finally: Does anyone know if the new Tori single has been released yet?
