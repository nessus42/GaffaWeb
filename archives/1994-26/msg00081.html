	i normally lurk...but this is getting a bit crazy.

	i agree whole heartedly with vickie...there is room for more than 
one talented female singer...please lets have a little open mindedness.

	i must put my 2cents in... IED mentions that tori should acknowledge 
kate's influence...what makes IED think that she hasn't?

	i have ON TAPE an interview, during tori's little earthquake tour, 
in which the radio interviewer asks her what she thinks of kate and if 
she has influenced her...tori says that there definitely an energy there 
that has influenced her.

	now this is probably not the acknowledgement that i am sure a lot of 
lovehounders want...."tori: yes i love kate bush...i wanted to be just 
like her...everything she does i mimic..." but instead it is tori 
acknowledging that kate has been one of many influences...

	kate broke new grounds with her music, i doubt that artist 
like tori would have made it big (or at least had as an easy a job 
doing it) without her...

	 but i think that tori and kate are not as similar as everyone 
professes.  i mean lets THINK a little please.  easy comparisons are 
not hard to do.  gee tori plays a piano, kate played a piano...they 
both are female singers with tremendous voices...wow add water and 
there you have instant comparison.

	how about comparing tori to Nine Inch nails? tori has said that 
pretty hate machine was all she listened to while recording little 
earthquakes.... she even acknowledges it in one of her songs (tear in 
my hand i believe).  it maybe hard to see at first but listen to tori's 
lyrics and then listen to PHM.  it can be seen.

	  tori hates comparison's to kate nowadays.  i think that it is 
people who keep bringing it up (hello!!! recognise this?) that have 
turned her off.  if any of you out there have older siblings who went to 
the same school...y'all will undrestand all too well.  "oh you are just 
like your brother...."  i mean a person wants to be a person...not a 
comparison!  please...lets let it be.

	now don't pigeon hole me as a pro tori fan.  i will be the first to 
tell you that i appreciate and love kate WAY more than tori...i think 
that tori has to grow a little.  not to say that i didn't think that her 
first two efforts were tremendous.  i will just say that i still am 
waiting for tori to put out something comparable to say the dreaming, 
or hounds of love (though LE came pretty damn close)

	in the meanwhile i will listen to both of them...along with a wide 
range of other female (and male) singers who both play the piano and 
don't play the piano and enjoy both knowing that despite what you all think...
they are completely different.

	by the way recently tori did a kate bush cover (i think it was 
running up that hill) in one of her concerts.  if that is not 
acknowledging her influences...then i don't know what is. 

	and for those of you who haven't heard of happy rhodes...check her 
out.  SHE freely acknowldeges the kate bush influence on her music, 
while havbing her own unique style.  her "best of,"  _rhodesongs_ 
includes her "feed the fire" acoustic TRIBUTE version where she sings a line or 
two from kate bush's running up that hill (make a deal with god).  okay?  happy? 
then check it out.

	by for now.

	irvin (who like vickie is missing RDT a whole lot)
