Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1994/08/25
Version: 1.1.j minus 1.1.h

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action. The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only. You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de). If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ. If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------
[The chapter "2.4. Kate-talk, our very own version of IRC" is gone. If
anyone needs it desperately I can reinsert it or send it to you. With
IRC being available everywhere there's no real need for Kate-talk
anymore.]

1.   General

1.1. What is rec.music.gaffa?

     9 years ago |&gt;oug /\lan thought it was time to create a discussion
     round about Kate Bush and her absolute artistic genius.

[Happy birthday gaffa!]

2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?
  

     Now there's also the USENET newsgroup alt.music.ecto, but unfortunately
     it still doesn't get wide distribution. Bug your system administrators
     to carry it! The mailing list and the newsgroup are not connected like
     Love-Hounds and rec.music.gaffa, they're separate entities.

[new paragraph]

     How to get Happy's CDs:

        CD's (prices in US currency)
        Title                   Order #         Price

        Building the Colossus   AGCD0029        13.99  (new album out now!)

[new album]

2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest
  

     Bobo In White Wooden Houses - White House
                   [this mailing list is basically a German language list, 

                   though English discussions are also welcome]

        subscribe: white-house-request@wupper.de

                   subject "subscribe"

        post:      white-house@wupper.de

[a new one]
  

3.3. What is Katemas?
  

     In 1994 there were parties in San Francisco (California), Wellington (New
     Zealand), Bellingham (Washington), Albuquerque (New Mexico) and Columbus
     (Ohio). Anywhere else?

[yes, anywhere else?]  


4.2. Tours

     There's a video tape ("Live at Hammersmith Odeon") and a 4 track EP from
     the tour. The video unfortunately only contains half of the show. The
     recordings of the rest had some technical problems and the result wasn't
     up to par with Kate's standards. The video (right now only the PAL
     version) is also available in a video+CD double pack, so Kate finally has
     an official live album. The only other source are vinyl bootlegs
     which all are of a very bad sound quality, since they were done from the
     audience with late 70's equipment. There are plenty of CD pirates from
     the video tape. Since there is now an official CD of this, please consider
     buying it, especially if you do own one of the bootleg copies.

[new stuff changed a lot here...]

4.3. The Convention
  

     It has really happened to us!

[yes, but it's already 1/4 year ago, so I moved this from the beginning
of the FAQ to this position]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     The latest set of singles is The Man I Love in the UK (CD5, 7", cassingle)
     which appeared on July 18th in the shops and on July 25th in the British
     charts (#27 and out, which brought an airing of the video in MTV Europe's
     Hitlist UK).

[further inexistant chart positions added]  


     Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1981/1994):
        CD of the official video tape (see below).
        Tracks: Moving, Them Heavy People, Violin, Strange Phenomena, Hammer
        Horror, Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake, Wow, Feel It, Kite,
        James And The Cold Gun, Oh England My Lionheart, Wuthering Heights

[the latest album just isn't The Red Shoes anylonger!]

     Official video tapes/laserdiscs:

     Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1981):
        TV special of Kate's only concert tour, unfortunately it contains only
        one hour out of the two and a half hour show. Now also available as
        CD+video double pack (PAL only).
        Tracks: Moving, Them Heavy People, Violin, Strange Phenomena, Hammer
        Horror, Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake, Wow, Feel It, Kite,
        James And The Cold Gun, Oh England My Lionheart, Wuthering Heights

[which is also relevant in the video section]

     Soon to come (hopefully): The Line, The Cross, and The Curve - the new
     50 minutes film around 6 songs from the new album The Red Shoes. Latest
     rumours say 'October'. Let's hope!

[keep your fingers crossed!]
  

     The song "Sexual Healing" which was supposed to appear on the Davy
     Spillane album titled "A Place Among the Stars" now hasn't appeared
     on said album. Hopefully it will find a different way to get published,
     so that the playing on the '94 Kate Bush Convention won't stay the only
     time we could hear this.

[bad luck this time]

     Also soon to appear: the US dance remix of Rubberband Girl which was also
     played at the Convention. It is said to be not very different from
     previous stuff. (Haven't heard it.)

[anyone a better description?]

     Gaffans in the US: Look out for Frutopia TV commercials! Kate wrote the
     music to these 9 different spots.

[and record 'em!]
