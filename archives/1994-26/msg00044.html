IED received the following e-mail message from Allan Balliett of
Intergalactic Garage, in regard to the upcoming screening of The Line, The
Curve, and the Cross in the Washington, D.C. area.
Love-Hounds may remember IED's flamelike objections to the high price
($10.00) that is being charged for admission to the event.

Although the following missive constitutes a blatant attempt to cast an ad
for the screening in the guise of a personal e-mail message to a private
party, IED was amused by the zeal with which Mr. Balliett set about his
campaign to ingratiate himself with his critic, whom he apparently feels it
is worth his while ingratiating!  Anyway, IED admits that he was mollified,
so, in the interest of a full hearing of both sides, here is Mr. Balliett's
message:

Subj:  KATE'S MOVIE
To:      IED0DXM


Andy!

How are you doing?

K---- suggested that I contact you and ask for help in pulling this Kate
Movie Event together.  I understand there has been some grousing about the
cost of the tickets. The price was suggested by Brad Gelfond, Kate's manager.
Kate takes a percentage of the ticket sales and the theater ownder takes the
remainder. THere is NOT ONE PENNY earmarked for IGG in the ticket sales. At
this point, there is no guarantee that our expenses will be paid either. (I
hired the artist to do the
flyers (very collectible, allow me to send you one (ok, several ;-)) and
spend a fortune on printing. The tickets have Kate's picture (from SONY) on
them and have a collectible stub. And it goes on.

I had hoped to get the 35mm print of Cloudbusting to show. (ANDY THIS IS ONE
HELL OF A THEATER!! Don't foreget that if deciding whether or not to come -
its walls are covered with JBL speakers and it has TWO MONSTER speakers
behind the
screen + 2000 watts of power! I can't wait!! 

Anyway - I would like to arrange for a hall to show videos in all day
Saturday. I do need videos to show, however. Its not that I don't have them,
its that I can't find them (o, you've heard that one before?) And it would be
nice to have
the best of prints and the most recent of clips. Can you help us and the 1000
people who will attend these shows? (ANDY! The theater only holds 135
people...does anyone know that? That's one reason why the tickets are so
expensive! There are fixed expenses and the ownder is suspicious that not
that many people will come to a special intereste event like this...can you
blame him? ANDY! THere is a Tuesday shwoing for press and friends of the
industry. It is free! Can you get any reporters to come and see the film and
review it? SONY doesn't care!!!

FRUITOPIA - I've faxed CHRIS BOZMEN (?) and laid out the scenario -
picturesque colonial mainstreet, turn of the centurty Opera House, 1000 Kate
Bush fans, 1000 Appalachian Dulcimer Festival attendees (did I mention that
there is a
dulcimer festival in town the same day?), 3000 resident students, etc WHERE's
THE FRUITOPIA TRUCK? Where's the MTV NEWS Camerman? This is a Kate Event!
Kate has made FRUITOPIA commercials interesting! Where are they going to find
a better Fruitopia and Kate photo-op?

That aside, I'd love to have the commericals on video to show and the scores
on tape to play during 'intermissions.'

Does this sound like fun or what? I'd appreciate it if you would help us,
Andy. I think Kate fans, new and old, will have a quality experience here in
Shepherdstown on Sept 10.
Take it easy!
