hi Y'all, 

	I've probably said this before, but come on folks, arguing over 
the merits (or as some would say, lack thereof) of a Kate song?

	De gustibus est non disputandem!  taste is just not to be 
discussed without getting into a very VERY heated discussion, and usually 
ends up having little to do with the subject at hand.  Why bother?  We 
all agree that there are some songs of her goddesship that are not as 
great as others, so why do we bother to argue over them?

	As I have already posted my credits and credibility here I will 
only state (once again) that I am a reviewer, musician, writer and 
critic, composer and sometimes conductor.  I have studied lots o'types of 
music, from 1000BC to the present (and beyond).  Yes, there are katesongs 
which are "better than" Passing through Air, ok?!  But there also credits 
and kudos due that song as well (drewicfer, i will not pass judgement on 
thee, but, you would benefit from a better handle).  The verse part of 
that song, is rather beautiful and wonderously constructed and as with 
many of her earlier works, kinda' makes one wonder what key she really had 
in mind when penning this.  The chorus?  Oh well, except for the fact 
that it is almost unplayable on guitar, the chorus is shall we say, "cute?"
Often upon hearing it I think that It really belongs to some other song.  
And the same can be said regarding other kateworks from the same era.  I 
mean, gosh, she was how old when that was written, 16, 17?  My own pieces 
from that time period are testaments to a music student's excesses (key  
and timing changes galore!).  Kate is only 13 months older than I; I know 
where she's coming from.  I graduated high school in 1977!  the #1 album 
that year was saturday night fever!  Am I proud of that fact?  Do I ever 
mention at parties that I knew how to "hustle" and "bus stop."  If you 
quote me on this I'll deny it.  

	Please can we come to a consensus about not arguing the merits, 
ad infinitum, ad nauseam, of one song?  Kate is an impressive embodiment 
of the Goddess.  Not everything she does, smells like roses.  Some smell 
like wisteria in late spring, some like fuscia of high summer and some, 
like the smell of humus from the forest floor.

	(Gosh, my high school english teacher would be proud of me!)

ps:  I think we should let Tori Amos mature a bit more, ere we go 
deifying her. -bg
