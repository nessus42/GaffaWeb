This is in response to yesterday's posting which referred to Kate's
"You Want Alchemy" as "crap".  I also have the European single of "The
Red Shoes" and I think that the track in question is actually a very
good song-- so stick your opinion in a cloud and bust it.

Onto other buisness-- I finally found _This Woman's Work_ this weekend
(Canadian version) and I was wondering if it was possible to find
versions of _Never Forever_, _The Dreaming_, and _The Hounds Of Love_
that have lyrics in the booklet?  I especially like the songs on _The
Hounds of Love_ but I have trouble understanding all the lyrics and am
therefore eager to find lyrics to this album as well as the others.

I've also managed to get my (hopeful) boyfriend interested in Kate, so
add yet another to the legion.

I was wondering if anyone else on the list has heard of Ani Difranco.
She is a folk-rock artist based in Buffalo, New York who sings alot of
songs with a strong feminist message.  She's been around since 1990 and
already has six albums.  I think she is really an excellent artist and
I have every album that I have been able to find by her.  (I have been
told that she has a strong Canadian following.)  She performed at my
college this past spring and her stage presence is electrifying.  She
emanates a warmth to her audience that none of the other performers
that have come here have been able to match.  Her music seems
wonderfully vibrant and alive.  If anyone wants any information about
ordering her music, please e-mail me and I will post it to the list.

Well, that's about it for now.
