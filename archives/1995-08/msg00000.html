&gt;Did Kate ever release a video for 'There Goes a Tenner'?  It seems to me
&gt;that there was a video released when the album came out, that was shot
&gt;on a train...am I right?

   There is a video to _There Goes A Tenner_. It was included on the 
_The Single File_ video collection. It was left off of _The Whole Story_,
and has been somewhat forgotten. It was not shot on a train...
  
   ...but there might be a bit of confusion, especially if you were
at the 1984 Canadian BushCon. Kate was asked by the two pin-heads
hosting _The Old Grey Whistle Test_ about the video for _The Dreaming_
that she had just shot. They were most interested that she had traveled
to the video studio to shoot it in a "guard's van." (Some of of railroad
car.)

&gt;Was there originally a video for 'Running Up That Hill' that was not the
&gt;dance piece that is so common?  I seem to remember a video clip of Kate
&gt;standing near a podium with the band behind her.

   The dance piece is the real video. The other one was an appearance on
the Terry Wogan TV show. eMpTyVee didn't like the real one for some 
reason, and asked for something else. So the version with her dressed in 
brown, behind a podium was the one played on MTV when the song came out.

&gt;Does anyone know where one could pick up a copy of the television
&gt;special done several years ago, in which Kate and Peter Gabriel sang a
&gt;duet?  It was released in England right around Christmas time...maybe in
&gt;1980.

   You need to get the Love-Hounds Collection. This special is on there,
in high quality, with 3 more hours of fine rare Kate video. Just ask.
