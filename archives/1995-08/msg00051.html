<PRE>
  Please accept my apologies for not having any real KATE
content to this post.  Thank You.

  Some of you have discussed (complained) about receiving
stuff that may not be appropriate to this discussion
list (ie. the Tori Bootleg list).  Has anybody out there
also receive the SAME article like two or even three
times?  I've received an article by Llovich THREE times.
(I'm sorry to have mentioned you specifically, it's nothing personal
:-)...there were others as well).  
Perhaps it's just MY e-mail server that's fouling things 
up for me.  But perhaps it's the Lovehounds mailing list
server that's sending it to me three times or maybe the
lovehounds server is sending it to everybody 3 times.

  Before I start investigating my own e-mail server, is
there anybody out there that has the same problem as I
am?  If so, please e-mail me PRIVATELY so we don't interfere
with the rest of the Lovehounds.  BTW, I'm currently
subscribed with "bounce mail" as opposed to "digest". 

My point here is that receiving tha same article 3 times 
is just as annoying as receiving an unrelated article.

peace

ronny

PS  ....while writing this post, I have received the EXACT 
    same post from Llovich AGAIN!  (4 times total)
