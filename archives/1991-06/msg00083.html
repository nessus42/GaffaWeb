[This is a first imperfect attempt at collating some facts for a monthly
post.  Please help me fill in the blanks.]

Rec.music.gaffa is a 5-year-old newsgroup dedicated to the artistic genius
of Kate Bush.  "Gaffa" comes from her song "Suspended in Gaffa" (on
_The_Dreaming_), and (according to Kate) refers to gaffer's tape, or duct
tape, used to keep people from tripping over electrical cabling.

Rec.music.gaffa is run as a moderated group only because submissions to it
are forwarded to an extensive mailing list of people without net access,
who form an informal fan club called "Love-Hounds".  You can mail
submissions, without fear of censorship, to:

love-hounds@eddie.mit.edu

To subscribe to the mailing list [and here I begin to lie hopelessly,
because this is what I tried and it hasn't worked] send a message
containing the single word "SUBSCRIBE" to

love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu [what's wrong with this, please?]

The big event of 1990 was the Kate Bush Fan Clubs Convention, November 17
at London's Hammersmith Palais, celebrating the release (in the UK, Canada
and Japan) of the "This Woman's Work" boxed set, containing all her albums
in conventional form, along with two CDs (or three LPs) of B-sides and
alternative mixes.  Of the 1300 convention attendees, some 50 were
Love-Hounds, many from the US and Australia, meeting face to face for the
first time.  Kate spent an hour answering questions submitted by audience
members, and announced that she hopes to have a new album finished very
quickly, having begun composing at the piano again.

She also claimed she's planning to "play some dates" at the end of 1991,
possibly including some in the US.  (Old Kate-Hounds are protecting
themselves from disappointment with a wait-and-see attitude, having heard
all this before.)

Kate's earliest band was called the KT Bush Band, (KT being readable as
Katey), and all her albums have had a KT emblem hidden somewhere on the
cover.  With the boxed set she introduced a new version of the symbol,
integrating the astrological symbol for Venus (ie, the biological symbol
for woman).

All five years of rec.music.gaffa/love-hounds-digest can be ftp'd from the
love-hounds archive at hayes.ims.alaska.edu (137.229.30.200) in directory
/pub/love-hounds/archives
Song lyrics, interviews, etc are in
/pub/love-hounds/kh on the same host.
GIF files are also available.(???)

For those without FTP capabilities, Richard Caldwell has started a BBS that
offers the GIFs and current r.m.g postings.  The Big Sky BBS can be reached
24 hours a day at 614-864-1198 (1200 or 2400 baud).
