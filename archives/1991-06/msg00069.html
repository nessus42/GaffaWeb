I have just received a letter from Peter at Homeground in response to some
Lovehounds print-outs I have been sending him. He says they are
"becoming increasingly more useful" to them. So keep submitting those
articles everyone!

Peter also says:

"Greetings to all of those Lovehounds who came to Homeground Towers. It was
great to have you all. Just a pity (1) that Andrew couldn't make it and
(2) that we couldn't find a proper fish and chip shop.

"To Ron in San Diego is the photo of the overloaded car on the way?
If it is no worries""

That was written on the 3rd Feb - so I expect the photos have now
arrived. There are also messages for Andrew and Vickie which I will
send by email.

General Kate news from Peter: They hear that tour preparations are
continuing, though there is no sign as yet of an official announcement.

&gt;Subject: "Leaving My Tracks"
&gt;
&gt;The book is called _Popular Music Since 1955_, written by Paul Taylor,
&gt;and published in 1985.  Our library has the American edition published
&gt;by G. K. Hall &amp; Co.  It was originally published in Britain by:
&gt;So now what somebody in England should do is write to Paul Taylor,
&gt;care of this address.  I'd do it myself but it would be much faster
&gt;and cheaper if somebody there would do it, since both the publisher
and author are there.  If the Homeground people read this, they
&gt;might want to try this.

Ed's certainly come up with a fascinating piece of information. I will
be sending some more digests to Peter at Homeground this week
and will include Ed's article amongst them.

&gt;Subject: Imports and stuff...
&gt;    Finally, I wanted to know if the people at Homeground
&gt;in the U.K. have an E-mail address. Does anyone know? I recently
&gt;wrote to them regarding a subscription to the magazine, and
&gt;mentioned to them that they could E-mail me if they had the
&gt;technology.

There is now an official HOMEGROUND PC - a Commodore PC20. They will
be using this to manage the subs., mailing labels etc. They do not
have access to the Net though it is something they would like in the
future.

Be seeing you,
	Neil
