&gt;Well, sorry to break the bad news to all the Kate Bush fans, but Sinead
&gt;won the alternative music grammy award, despite the controversy.
&gt;

I don't think that anyone was expecting anything different, even though IMHO
Sinead was the LEAST deserving of ANY of the nominees . . . especially in
light of her continued crying about the commercialism of music, wiping her
eyes with her left hand and collecting money with her right.

&gt;I was extremely disappointed by this year's awards. Here are some of the
&gt;reasons:
&gt;a) Roy Orbison won for best song (or record?) of the year for a song written
&gt;27 years ago...That's a disgrace. There was so much good music out in 1990
&gt;but these guys didn't notice.

I agree completely!  Joe Cocker was also nominated for "You Can Leave Your
Hat On" which is 3-4-5 years old at least.  I thought the Grammys were for
NEW music.  If not, then why doesn't HoL win best album every year? :^)

&gt;c) Mariah Carey won several awards. 

The sad thing is that she actually deserved at least one of them . . . if
we are reserving the Grammys to "new" artist.  Just an indication of the
state of new artists joining the fold.  She does have a very powerful voice,
even though it is being utterly wasted singing throw-away pop music.  I'd
love to hear her sing "Only the Lonely" or "Nobody Knows the Way I Feel this
Morning".

&gt;HOWEVER:
&gt;a) On a good note Metallica won best metal award for their cover of Queen's
&gt;'Stone Cold Crazy'. YEAH!
&gt;b) Vernon Reid of LIVING COLOR was wearing a Sinead O Connor T-shirt. YEAH!

 c) At least Wilson Phillips didn't win anything! (Or did they, and I missed
    it?!?)

I think that Gary Shandling put the whole thing best when he said, "And for
you guys serving in the Gulf, we'll be sure to get lots of close-up shots
of Mariah Carey and Chynna Phillips."  And then a close up of Chynna, blushing,
with Carnie Wilson looking at her.  Beautiful!
