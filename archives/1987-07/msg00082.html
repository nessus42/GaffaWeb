Well, here's my version, forward *and* backward.  Be warned that I seldom
get anyone to agree with my transcriptions (sigh).  The following stuff
is a reply I typed in last October or earlier, and I think I tried to
post it but was having mailer trouble.  Note that I did have a backward
copy to listen to, courtesy of a co-worker called "Gnome".

========================================================================
 if impatient, hit n-key now.  Recycled posting begins here.
========================================================================


OK, after much listening to my backward cassette last night (my ears
still hurt, from turning up the volume on my earphones in a vain attempt 
to get better signal to noise ratio), I hear the following for the whole track:

(note that &lt;&gt; brackets are where I'm *particularly* uncertain of my
interpretation, even more than the usual level of error.  So don't
take any of this as my insisting that these are accurate...)


========================================================
Backward...
========================================================
{end}
...hear me leaving 	...You can't hear me
{chopped:}
  talk to me, listen to me, listen to me, talk to me, 
  talk to me, baby &lt;I don't want you to leave, but you don't listen to me&gt;
{"cymbal crash"}
...You can't hear me
{chopped:}
  I was &lt;here&gt; before, you talked to me, 
  &lt;you said that you didn't think it was too late to &gt; help me  
  &lt;you could&gt; help me 

{fwd stuff, incl seagulls}

{I really think this is fwd, not bkwd:} 
      (w/r/l)eee... seee leeen  { total of seven times }
{or "we see you leave", but it isn't clear to me at all}

Mawww nee naw nihnawnee.... neh, eee nawnkeenuhs, nawnkeenuhs 
Mawww nee naw nihnawnee.... neh, eee nawnkeenuhs, nawnkeenuhs 
Mawww nee naw nihnawnee.... neh, eee nawnkeenuhs, nawnkeenuhs 

{fwd}

{SOS is a palindrome}

you wont hear me

{amoung fwd stuff, maybe "I can not", but I think I'm imagining it}

{remaining stuff is fwd}

{begin}

========================================================
And forward... 
========================================================

{begin}

{the following included because deviates from record liner notes}
You won't hear me
You won't hear me
You won't hear me saying 
You won't hear me saying to you

{Note that "saying" sounds on the track almost like "singing"
or even "sekking"... irrelevant slurring?  And I'm not sure about
liner's "can't", could be "don't" or especially "won't"}

Can't let you know...
	 ...		{etc, as in lyrics on record liner}

You won't hear me
You won't hear me
You won't hear me 
You in the room with me     {especially note this deviation from record liner}
You can't hear me saying 
You won't hear me saying to you

Can't let you know...
	 ...		{etc, as in lyrics on record liner}

{S O S}

Sun ihk nawn, sun ihk nawn-ee-een, ed &lt;n&gt;eeee... naw n' naw nee naw'
Sun ihk nawn, sun ihk nawn-ee-een, ed &lt;m&gt;eeee... naw n' naw nee naw'
Sun ihk nawn, sun ihk nawn-ee-een, ed &lt;n&gt;eeee... naw n' naw nee naw....n

Release yea 
{repeated for a total of seven; I seem to hear "ree-lee-syee" 
every time except once when the Y is missing, ie  "Really see"}

{compare the following to inclusions in Wake; same lines different order}

You didn't hear me come in...	{or "cummin'"?}
{chopped:}
  help me baby help me baby 
  don't &lt;do it&gt; it's too late
  listen to me LISTEN to me 
  talk to me &lt;at all, and really&gt; listen &lt;to me&gt; 

Nih-vee ehneck rinee { see later line }

{even more heavily chopped:}
  listen to me LISTEN to me baby
  help me HELP me baby 
  talk to me TALK to &lt;me&gt; 
  please please TALK to &lt;me&gt;  {desperate voice}

Nih-vee ehneck rinee { following line, backward}
...You won't hear me leavin'!

{end}
================================================================

Pardon me assaulting you with the obvious, but I wanted to point
out that while some backward portions turn out quite predictably,
the apparent effect of reversing the "chopped" part is totally
at odds with what you would predict by cataloging the phonemes 
and then listing them in reverse order.  I think she has made an 
incredible discovery here.  Well, it blows me away, anyway.

Apparently she has a way of putting both fwd and bkwd phonemes
into the same burst in a way that allows each to be ignored when
played the opposite of its intended direction.  Stunning idea.


================================================================


[postscript April 2, 87; note also that certain of these lines or
some very similar appear in Waking the Witch;  I'll include just 
the fragment of my Wake transcription that applies (of course, I
don't expect anyone to agree with that either....)


[&lt;a&gt;:K, choppy, from Watching You Without Me]
  listen to me LISTEN to me baby
  help me HELP me baby 
  talk to me TALK to me 
  please please TALK to me  [desperate voice]

/"Deus et deu dominummmmmm "/x4

[distorted voice, as an impatient guardian] oh child, child,

[&lt;a&gt; (because voice and emotion corolate), Kate, speaking urgently and at first 
very rhythmicly; progressively more desperate...]:

&lt;a&gt; Listen to me he lets me by &lt;buy&gt; the (formagistidden?)  ahh!!  
				&lt; where Magic's hidden?&gt;
&lt;a&gt; help me! listen to me LISTEN to me 	&lt;c&gt; Red red roses

OK, so I don't hear the same as other people do.  Could have to do with
this full house in my head tonight.....
