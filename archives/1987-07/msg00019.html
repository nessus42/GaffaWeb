Thanks, Erik. IED had been wondering about that line at
the end (it's said twice) for the past eighteen months,
but (JEEZ WHAT A MORON) he never thought of listening to it
backwards! The actual line is recorded forwards, isn't it?
That is, it sounds as though Kate learned the backwards
phonetics and recorded them normally, because it doesn't have
that weird suction-like sound to it...

IED just sent off a letter of sulking complaint to the
Kate Bush Club, telling them to cut this nonsense out and
just tell us the fucking answer. It's getting to be ridiculous.
He went through the last three Newsletters with a f.-t. c.,
looking for clues to the solution (for the "Leave It Open"
mystery track, the relevant Newsletters were peppered with
the word "weird"), but could discover nothing at all. One
person has got the first six (of the twelve) words, and a couple
of others have figured out "the fourth, fifth and sixth".

After prolonged listening, IED has had to reject the
suggestion: "Don't need no symphony to be there", or any
variant thereof. It's possible to see where you hear that,
but the consonants are completely different, and the "to be"
isn't there at all.

It could just be more complicated than anyone has guessed
so far: there is definitely a BACKWARDS rhythm track going
on at the same time as the regular one. It's very soft,
but it's there. Now, why is it there?

Non-KT news:
IED got a look at the China Crisis "CD single" yesterday:
it's a little teensy-tiny CD (3 1/2 inches), with four tracks
on it, otherwise just like a normal CD, and packaged in a normal
gatefold British single sleeve, except smaller than a seven-inch
gatefold. As an import, it cost $8.99 in the store where IED saw it.
Peter Gabriel has one out now, look for it soon in your import
shops: "Big Time" will have the extended version, plus the
Womad track "Across the River" (?), plus the new track "Curtains"
-- necessary on CD, since the vinyl version is TERRIBLE.
These CD singles are going to become very common in the next year.
