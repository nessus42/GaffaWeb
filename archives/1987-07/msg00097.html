&gt;
&gt;I turned to classical and jazz music app. 10 years ago because I was bored
&gt;with the "one verse and a chorus ... and you've as good as heard the whole
&gt;thing" style of mainstream music that is written to the lowest common
&gt;denominator to sell the most records (to an audience that can't sit through
&gt;a 6 minute video in which nothing happens, even though the video is entirely
&gt;appropriate to the music!!).  I guess you could call that "elitist".

Now that you mention it, that's part of what I should have mentioned in my
previous posting about what I really do and don't like.  I still listen to
rock, off and on, but I find I have to channel hop a lot to escape the
one verse and chorus drivel.  Sometimes I end up giving up and listen to
classical for the rest of the drive.  Other than lack of content, I am
bothered by lack of melody, as in The Smiths.  But there are *some* intriguing
story-songs, such as Ghost Train ("Card-sharking shooting each other for a
comfortable seat", "He gets hard of hearing in the cabin when the weather's
fine")... not KT quality, but amuzing.  Likewise the one (don't know name
of song or group) about "don't pull me out, I'm just floating".  But on the
whole, too much formula schlock.  I agree with Mark, KT is good partly
because she puts more story in her songs.  (Otherwise, I'd rather rock were
instrumental; why spoil nice guitar licks with idiotic repetitive verses?)

&gt;It's interesting that some of my favorite classical music is Holst's
&gt;"The Planets" and  Rimsky-Korsekov's "Scherezade" ,pieces that try to
&gt;"paint a picture" with the music. When I first heard Kate's music,
&gt;this same "visual" quality stood out. I have not heard anybody in the
&gt;popular music field do this as well. But I guess that makes it too
&gt;"artsy" for some people.

That's a good way to put it.  I wonder if anyone more familiar with
'alternative' rock can come up with some other 'paints a picture' artists
in addition to KT, even if not of her caliber?  Open invitation.

Mail welcome, but my mailer seldom cooperates when I try to reply.
