	[oops, I think that was "really from" IED]
&gt; Ironically, her
&gt;contribution on Gabriel's "Don't Give Up", now a U.S. single,
&gt;will probably only alienate many American listeners, since it
&gt;emphasizes the European "precious" side to her voice -- not a good thing
&gt;in any case with U.S. listeners -- in  a song which was clearly
&gt;designed to reflect and appeal to American culture (or lack thereof).

What?  You *are* kidding, aren't you?  Clearly?  Reflect?  Appeal?

None of the above.  It struck me as reflecting British depression over
high unemployment in Brittain.  Not in the US.  I didn't think about its
style at the time (I was in Brittain on business when the single was
released there last Nov or Dec), but as I recall it doesn't sound the
least bit designed to *either* reflect or appeal to us Amurikans.  (Nor
to offend, for that matter).  Just a quaint ballad on a topical subject,
remarkably gentle considering the topic.

&gt;It is very revealing that Gabriel originally hoped to have
&gt;Dolly Parton for the female vocal. Both she and Kate share, in
&gt;some broad category of confessional balladeering, a certain
&gt;tendency to affectation and exaggerated emotion; but Parton's
&gt;can be embraced by Americans because of its hick familiarity,
&gt;whereas Kate's may be rejected by them because of its exotic,
&gt;or "furrin", touches. However, we'll see.

Perhaps it is more that DP appealed to him as a motherly (yes, despite
all the jokes about her figure's affect on males, I'm refering to her
personality) character to sing counterpoint to his character's lament;
KT sounds more like the lamenter's sister or wife, but still fits the
context of the song: fragile, sharing the humiliation of her brother/
lover/friend, but bravely keeping a stiff upper lip in the uniquely British
way.  And trying to say that people are more important than things ("You
still have us....")

Is it just possible that he didn't write the song to appeal to purchasers,
but to affect listeners?  Perhaps even literally what the title (and the
female lyrics) say?   Nahhhh....  couldn't be.  Idealism is passe' in
1987, especially in this netgroup.

By the way, I was shocked that KT would play 2nd fiddle to anyone, until
I realized that she carries the message in that duet, not he.  Has she
collaborated with anyone else I should know about?  I'm meaning to pick
up some PG tapes now that I've heard (and seen) 2 or 3 samples of his
work; anyone else of similar caliber? (no, I'm not interested in musical
terrorists and intentionally offensive superpunks, thanks.  Don't they
deserve a seperate mod group for their equally offensive fans to hang
out in???? I'm tired of them trying to slamdance my sensibilities).

But enuf of my drivel, more of yours please.
