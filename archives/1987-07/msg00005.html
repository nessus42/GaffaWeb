Big Black/Breaking Circus/Rifle Sport
1st Ave Main Room  3/22

(Yes, its the notorious set for _Purple Rain_)

Missed Rifle Sport, my date was late

One guy (drummer?) for RS doubles in Breaking Circus.  Absolute show
stoppers.  Although I've both of their records, it was the first time I'd
seen them live.  Much MUCH MUCH better live than on vinyl.  Although their
post-punk/speed metal sound comes across on their discs, it takes a live show
to release the WALLO'SOUND.  First time in many moons that the typical blase
"I wear but black and I'm soo bored" crowd expected and demanded an encore
by someone other than the headline gp.
	
(Special notices to Joe Slime &amp; Bill Hsu -- I heartily recommendboth of their
recordings, especially the recent 2nd one.  They are in the midst of a tour,
so if they roll your way, drop $3 and prepare to enjoy yourselves.)

Their East Coast leg got "rave" reviews in the _Village Voice_, _NY Times_,
all the usual press.  The [yawn] inevitable comparisons to other MPLS 'thrash'
bands HuskerDuReplacementsSoulAsylum were no surprise and as ridiculous as they
were predictable.

BB (literally) exploded onto the stage by blowing off a brick of firecrackers.
AS Riley, Albini and Durango launched into "Big Money" (feisty rock critic
cliche) their guitars and percussion machine drowned out the pyrotechniques.

They did most of the material off of "Atomizer", with standouts being
"Bazooka Joe," &amp; "Fists of Love."  The band did "Jordan, Minn" for an encore,
with the following highlights.  Albini introduced it as "...a song aboutsuburb -- 'Hopkins, Minnesota.'"  For the record, Jordan is a small town about
60m S of Mpls, while Hopkins is a MPLS suburb proper.  I don't know if Albini
was wanking on all of Mpls proper, the place whaere the band (allegedly) crashes
when in town, or if he simply fu**ed up.  Any insights?!?  "Jordan..." dissolved
into a mental masturbation exercise for Albini, as he played with feedback FX,
even after DR &amp; SD had left the stage for a good 4 mins.

A very LOUD and very wEiRd set...

STAY TUNED FOR ANOTHER fIREHOSE review!
fIREHOSE/Descendants 3/25
Husker Dozzzzzzzze (yawn) 3/30, 3/31

Q:  While it has been touched upon in the past, can any of you KB fans shed
opinions/serious info as to why she has never "caught on" in the US?
Think of the arguments this will spawn!
Prepare for volumuous IED postings!
