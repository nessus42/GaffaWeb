Crowded House at the Bottom Line, NYC

A FANTASTIC SHOW!

I'm not sure if this band is still (or ever was) considered alternative,
but whatever the label,  they were terrific. The main singer/songwriter
is Neil Finn, previously of Split Enz. He is helped by Paul on drums
and Nick (? Faulty memory and my album is not within reach ) on bass. Together
they clown around, like Paul making beautiful music on Neil's guitar
strings with his drumsticks. They did all of their album, but modified the
songs really skillfully, rocking harder than ever on the uptempo ones.
They also did a bunch of new material which was even better than the stuff
on this album. One memorable moment was when Neil's monitor was giving him
trouble. He wanted to play any old song so the sound man could check it
out, so he broke into the Sex Pistol's Anitchrist. The rest of the band,
as well as the audience, chimed in. 

A new Cure album is due out soon. I heard one track which was good, but
the name escapes me. 10,000 Maniacs are currently recording in L.A.

Sonic Youth is at Maxwell's in Hoboken on April 23 and 24. Lydia Lunch
at the same spot April 5th. (YUCK) Stranglers April 16 and Mission UK on
the 24th at the Ritz. In May the Ritz is having many dates of Squeeze   
and China Crisis.
