but just some blantant attacks on people's pysche's...

I don't see why your so upset ms. turner cause some people seemed
to be enjoying themselmves at the throwing muses show.
just be lucky you could stand close to the stage and watch them.  what will
you say when they become wavo polular and you have to pay 14.00 to see them
in a place where you HAVE to sit down in a little chair and not move 
(i.e., the husker du syndrome).

Iggy Pop, the Bayou

Iggy's been opening for the Chrissie Hynde road show, but he played
this fairly small club(200 people or so) on a week's notice.  Even
though you had to pay almost 15.00, this was a hot show.   The crowd
was s cross between haircuts and leather jackets (the Bayou is a kick
ass rock and roll club).  last christmas when I was in new hamspter, I saw
Iggy on MTV, and talk about looking like a weak dude.  pretty
wimpy I thought then, and was expecting the same.  no way, this guy
was into it for this show.  He's not wimping out with age, just 
ripping up places.  Still the same, somewhat thinner, more healthy than
before though he does look like an AIDS outpatient.  his back up band is 
old, not sure who they were, but one guy kinda looked like Fred
Williamson.  hard to say. By the end of the show, when he started
cranking thru stuff like "Search and Destroy" and "TV Eye" he was lying 
on the stage,  or singing from the middle of the audience, where these
totally intense females were copping feels like mad, and like the
man, Igg took it all in stride.  The only odd part was these dick bouncers
who were positioning themselves in the middle of the crowd to make
sure no one had too good a time, which gave everyone an excuse to
flail more wildly. no matter, he probably won't do too many club
shows for awhile being on the road and all, but you know what you 
have to do when he does though.
