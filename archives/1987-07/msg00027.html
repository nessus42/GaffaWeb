Pixies / Throwing Muses @ The Paradise, Boston

Pixies were loud and raucous, varied tempos, catchy melodies.  Played
about 13 songs,  audience liked 'em.  Not too bad at all.

Muses came out.  I had seen them about a month ago at UMass/Amherst, and
thought that they were good, but very distant from the audience.  This show
was MUCH different.  Kristen Hersh was smiling, making eye-contact, talking
to the audience, etc.  The band was decidedly less catatonic than they were
at UMA.  They did knock-up versions of "Hate My Way", "Vicky's Box", "Rabbit's
Dying", "Fish", "Stand Up", "Fear", "Green".  They only did one encore, owing
to a slightly late start; I was disappointed at this, since they had done about
3 encores at UMA.  The room was PACKED to the brim.  This was their last date
until the fall (summer will be spent recording the new album in the UK), so
if you haven't seen 'em, you've got a long wait.  SEE THEM, though, since
they are a GREAT band, especially live.


One thing about this concert, though, that absolutely PISSED ME OFF to no
end was a group of people who thought that it would be really REALLY a great
idea if they decided to slamdance to every song, even the slow ones.  Where
do these people get off, ramming themselves into every person within a 20'
radius and then acting hurt when they get asked politely to stop it?  There
were about 10 people to my left annoying the 50 people surrounding them.  I
did NOT pay $7.50 to get repeatedly shoved and eventually land my fist in
someone's face.  Neither did they pay to get punched.  We all came to hear
the band, or so I thought... these people were content to scream wildly and
slam into each other (and the rest of us).  If it were a hardcore show, I
would understand; hell, I'd join in!  But it wasn't.  Some people just never
get things straight, I guess.  I dunno, does this sort of thing happen all
the time at clubs??  These people had serious attitude problems.

Me (after being slammed into): Go away.
Obnoxious slamdancer: Hey man, why don't you smile?
Me (smiling): Go away.
O.S.: Didn't you come here to move? Didn't you come here to have fun?
	If you smiled and had fun ---
Me: I *was* having fun until you careened into me.  You are annoying people.
	Please stop it.
O.S.: (stupid look) (bounces away from me into three women enjoying themselves)

The Paradise officials were about ready to can the lot of them, but I guess
they decided it wasn't worth their energies, since the show was going to be
over soon.   It just annoys me that these people don't think about their
actions.  I guess they think they're so CHILL that anything they do is OK
cuz they're just so CHILL.  What wastes of human bodies.  Flame off.
