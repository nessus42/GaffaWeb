&gt;WCVT-Towson
&gt;is the present local station, and is good at times, but either their library
&gt;is tiny or their station manager is narrow-minded, because they lapse into
&gt;commercial nuu muusik :-) quite often.
&gt;                                        -Grey

CVT's library is not huge, but really stupidly organized (whatever
happened to alphabetical order?). They also have a rule that you
have to be a Towson State student to be a DJ, which cuts down on
the local pool of people with cool taste. I almost applied to TSU's
grad program chiefly so I could do a show, but finally decided not
to. I did do a guest spot with D.J. Ennis, the music director, who
admittedly doesn't have the most progressive taste in the world, and
tried to stay away from conventional new wave. Due to the Students
Only Rule, though, I probably won't be back. Grr.

&gt;Let's admit that the bigger record companies (including SST) are out to
&gt;manipulate non-commercial radio into becoming a commercial entity.  The
&gt;FCC ought to make a set of rules outlawing people on payrolls to record
&gt;companies to run non-commercial radio stations.
&gt;jim

I think banning the likes of CMJ and Rockpool would produce
satisfactory results also. The decline of college radio has plenty
to do with the rise of these two rags.

&gt;Anyone want to recommend me some DAF?  I found some at Newbury Comics
&gt;(Cambridge) a while ago, and wanted to try some but didn't know
&gt;which album would be good as an intro/sampling of their stuff.
&gt;Are all their lyrics in German?
&gt;Name:      G. T. Samson

Yawn. Didn't somebody ask this two months ago? Everything save
"1st Step To Heaven," their latest disc, is in German. Go out
and buy "1st Step" and "Gold Und Liebe." Caveat -- my brother
declared "Gold" to be "about as interesting as a wet sock," for
whatever that's worth.

&gt;That's why Bruce Springsteen is so popular: his
&gt;voice oozes intelligence and sophistication.
&gt;Ditto Mick Jagger, Huey Lewis, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, Louis Armstrong, The
&gt;Bee-Gees, Chrissie Hynde, Pee-Wee Herman, Simon LeBon, etc.: Americans
&gt;wouldn't put up with these people if they had dumb voices.
&gt;-- Andrew

Okay, you can put down the Boss, Mick, even Chrissie.  BUT DON'T
INSULT PEE-WEE AGAIN!!!! The P-Man Rules! Has anybody managed to
get all the lyrics from the opening song, by the way?

&gt;I'd be more interested in hearing how Kate does in OTHER countries besides
&gt;America and England?  How about some of you Norwegians or Japanese
&gt;filling us in?  Or whomever...

She does very, very well in Sweden. Canada too.

&gt;Also, (this will sound disquietingly naive), where do people see all these
&gt;obscure videos?  (Obscure in this instance being anything the big M doesn't
&gt;play, i.e. not so obscure).  Do people go to clubs that often, or is there
&gt;another outlet?
&gt;allyn

MTV's 120 Minutes (Sunday at midnight) is a good source, but clubs
are the best source...in D.C., the 9:30 Club has a "video happy hour" most
afternoons.

&gt;Someone named Stacey Q has done (had done for her, more likely) a cover of
&gt;"You Just Keep Me Hanging On".  I liked Colourbox's better.  Cindi Lauper
&gt;squeaks "What's Going On", Love and Rockets did "Ball of Confusion" ...
&gt;what IS going on?

Are you sure this wasn't Kim Wilde? She just released a version of the
old Supremes hit (a fave of mine, since it was #1 when I was born).
Cover versions have always been trendy. Look at the Beatles' first few
LPs. R.E.M., incidentally, will soon be releasing an album of cover
tunes (including 3 Velvet Underground songs and an Aerosmith number).

&gt;I played "Help Me Somebody" from Byrne/Eno's "My Life In the Bush of Ghosts",
&gt;for a friend of mine. She said the "It's so high, you can't get over it...
&gt;it's so low, you can't get under it ..." part came from the Temptations song
&gt;"Psychedelic Shack".  Does this radio preacher Byrne and Eno recorded listen
&gt;to the Temptations, or vice versa, or what?
&gt;                        --Peter

Aw, c'mon. Those lines are from an old spiritual called "Rock'a My
Soul" that's about a squillion years old. "Rock'a my soul to the
bosom of Abraham, oh, rock'a my soul..."
