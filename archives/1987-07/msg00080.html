Goodness, could I have actually scooped IED on a bit of Kate news,
or did I miss something?  I just spoke to a fellow Katefan
who works in the movie biz. He'd seen a trade screening of the
new John Hughes production, "She's Having a Baby," which will
open 19 June. And there was a brand new Kate song playing over the
credits! I don't know the title (aargh -- sorry!). Maybe John
Hughes isn't as bad as I've thought...

Loads of thanks to Karen Weiss for her fascinating rundown of the
women's music scene in D.C. and elsewhere. Any word on a vinyl
release from Betty? They seem to have quite a following now...

For those confused by my "$69-A-Day" guide that appeared earlier
this week (yeah, I know, "who has $69 a day to spend on records") --
it was based upon a feature in the L.A. Times, in which Robert
"Brooce Is God" Hilburn tells you what to buy if you only
have $25 a month to spend on records. But seriously, no matter how
much money you have to spend, I cannot recommend Julian Cope's
"Saint Julian" highly enough. It is a wonderful pop album, the kind
that makes you feel like dancing around the living room..."Saint
Julian" is, well, divine!

THE PRETENDERS, Capitol Centre, 3/30
Even though I was one of the five or six people in the world who
actually liked "Get Close," there was something vaguely sad about
this concert. I'd never seen the Pretenders before, but watching
Chrissie [the only true Pretender -- the new guys are only, uh,
pretenders] run through "The Adultress," "Precious" and "Message of
Love" just made me aware of the ghosts of the original lineup.
The new stuff worked much better, especially the gorgeous "Hymn
to Her," but I found myself wishing that I could have caught
the band the first time 'round. I arrived too late to see opener Iggy
Pop, but Chrissie did kiss the stage in tribute to him. Touching, eh?
The show also had the worst sound I've ever heard at a Cap Centre
gig, which is saying a lot.

Now, who IS Zwort Finkle?
