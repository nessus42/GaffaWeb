Hi Leigh,

You must listen to TRS more! &lt;grin&gt;  Kate would never disappoint.  On my
initial listen I was not nuts about the record.  But then I began to
like it a lot on subsequent listenings.

Dan

&gt; 
&gt;      Hi Dan, Hi Ron
&gt; 
&gt;      Dan - I have to agree with Ron as far as TRS is concerned - every
&gt;      other KB CD I have is practically worn down to the plastic, except
&gt;      TRS.
&gt; 
&gt;      In TKI, LH, TD, HOL and TSW I cannot find a favourite nor a hated
&gt;      track.  However, no matter how many times I listen to TRS, I find it
&gt;      cold and staccato in places (so sue me).  I'm afraid indifference has
&gt;      taken me on this one.
&gt; 
&gt;      Slatings one at a time please.
&gt; 
&gt;      Leigh

&gt; Ron,
&gt; 
&gt; I have to disagree with you on The Red Shoes and The Sensual World.
&gt; Comparing the Cure material to the The Sensual World?  Check out the
&gt; vocals on Eat the Music; they are sublime.  I trust Kate's judgement.  I
&gt; am at her mercy.

&gt; &gt; My own preferences? (Everyone else seems to have a list.):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   1. Hounds of Love--possibly the most delightful musical surprise I
&gt; &gt; ever had (late November 1985). After hearing RUTH on the radio a couple
&gt; &gt; of times, I patiently waited until the CD came out, and took a chance on
&gt; &gt; it (never heard anything else by Kate).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   2. The Dreaming--OK, this is not for everybody, I know, but I connect
&gt; &gt; to it on a level I can't explain. Funny thing is, the criticisms I've
&gt; &gt; heard of TD ("Dark, brooding...") are almost opposite to what people
&gt; &gt; said about HOL (from "Rock's eternal kid", as one Rolling Stone reviewer
&gt; &gt; called her)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   3. Never For Ever. The material isn't as moving as on the above two,
&gt; &gt; but it certainly has some amazing vocal demo moments ("Violin" is
&gt; &gt; nothing if not impressive singing, from a purely stunt/technical
&gt; &gt; standpoint).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   4. TKI, LH These have their moments, but that high, "drunk little
&gt; &gt; girl" voice--well, a little goes a long way.
&gt; &gt; Some of the lyrics on TKI are pretty obscure too--although I know that,
&gt; &gt; with Kate, once you get the idea what a song is about, often it all
&gt; &gt; suddenly pops into focus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  5. TSW--Again, some really beautiful parts, but I think the influences
&gt; &gt; on her were not the best for creating her best music--Why didn't she
&gt; &gt; just front for the Cure for a few years, it might've had the same
&gt; &gt; effect?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6. TRS--I don't get this one at all, except as (1) a reach for
&gt; &gt; commercial appeal, and (2) a reaction to themes of despair and death,
&gt; &gt; prompted by her mother's death (but only in places).
