&gt;
&gt; That's funny. I don't get much out of the song either.

Hmm, this song is quite important to me .. maybe a matter of
interpreting more into than it is ...

&gt;     Ironic don't you think that the christian faith should adopt such a
&gt;     paganistic ritual - maybe it was done to gain popularity with (us)
the
&gt;     heathens!!

well,  christians made the date of christmas as it is because of the
winter solsitice. the pagans had these great celebrations that the
christians couldn't partake in because, well, they were christian, and
couldn't celebrate the solsitice. so they decided to celebrate christmas
then, also for the purpose of converting the pagans. most of our holidays
are pagan anyways. look at halloween. so i really wouldn't be surprised if
they took on that custom too. =)

&gt;
&gt; I don't know if that was meant by Kate, but now I know where the lyrics

I know that song too, of course (from the "Secret wish" album).
But it stroke me as I saw the picture of Kate and recalled the
poem by Poe....

&gt;What, you may ask, is the connexion between the recent Luc Besson film "The
&gt;Fifth Element" and Kate Bush...
&gt;
&gt;It so happens that the female lead in the film, Milia Jovovich (who plays,
&gt;appropriatly enough, the supreme being), is by chance also an aspiring
&gt;singer, with an album already out (Divine Comedey by name, if I remember
&gt;rightly) and she claims Kate Bush to be one of her major influences.  I
&gt;have heard but a snippet of this album via the net, but what I heard (a bit
&gt;of a song called 'reaching from nowhere') did indeed ring of Bushness.
&gt;Possibly worth a listen.
&gt;
&gt;Mike Lacy
&gt;
The album is called The Divine Comedy, it came out in 94 or 95, and
it's a great album.  I don't really see any Kate influence though.
Milla has her own talents, none borrowed...everyone should check this
album out.

&gt; Interesting note about Christmas . . . the sentimental family celebration
&gt; we think of as so traditional is of fairly recent origin.  In the late
&gt; 1800's Christmas was a rather wild time.  In New York the streets would
&gt; fill with drunken "wassailers" who got out of hand and made it dangerous to
&gt; go out at night.
&gt;
&gt; There was a conscious attempt at the time by both city government and local
&gt; businesses to sweeten these drastic Christmas revels into a more
&gt; family-oriented -- and more consumerist -- holiday. This also coincided
&gt; with the growth of a more enlightened attitude towards children, who were
&gt; coming to be seen less as miniature workers and more as budding people.
&gt;
&gt; One direct result was our now favorite Christmas poem, The Night Before
&gt; Christmas, which was purely designed to promote a nicer holiday -- but with
&gt; some of the loveliest occasional poetry an American has come up with.

The way I heard it, the author was a minister who regularly wrote poems
for his children, with *no* intention of publishing them.  This poem was
one of those, and he was mortified when it became public.

A useful object lesson for us all (esp. me).

     Hi Kira

     It's funny, I always found this song to be almost the opposite, the
     reaction of someone hurting emotionally who needs to find a place to
     hide that they know and trust.  Some of us run to under the stairs -
     some go under the ivy.  (Incidentally, we have a local area called
     Willingham Woods where Ivy (Helixia) grows rampant, in amongst it are
     thorny wild roses - pink and white!!

Er.. my take on it? It's about love, and sex.  Go on, "under the leaves..
go right to the white rose"  it is rather suggestive.

Mebbe that's just me.

        Kira
        who once danced an interpretive modern dance to "Under the Ivy"
in dance class, in senior year in high school, in 1986. It was a silly
dance in a dress from Pier 1 that was supposed to look like a Greek chiton.
And I was in *luv*, for the first time, that year, with my best friend,
who occasionally seemed to return my feelings. This may have something to
do with my interpretation of the song.

     Hi Don

     the line "the green on the grey" is a possible indicator of a
     graveyard, this may not be as far fetched as it seems - East Wickham
     farm looks across to Plumstead Church and the common.  I wonder if
     this was somewhere to hide from everyone!! - there's alot of
     gravestones that are covered with ivy there - what think you??

Hi,

in anticipation of Kate's birthday, german music channel
Viva II will air a one-hour special on Monday, July 28
at 20:00 MESZ ("Vinyl-Xtra").
I wonder how that will look like, I always thought they've
got only three Kate videos.

VH-1 will also play some Kate videos on July 30, between
16:00 and 18:00 ("Cafe VH-1").

ciao,
Rolf
