&gt;     There are actually quite a few different versions. I'd count them,
but I'm
&gt; writing this on a train.
&gt;
&gt;     When I get home, I'll be making some master tapes, and a new round
&gt; of dubbing will commence. Two people have volunteered to do dubs.
&gt; Details will be announced soon. Is someone willing to volunteer to
&gt; coordinate? I travel too much to keep up. All it takes is a little time
&gt; and e-mail.

Chris,

Thank you for reminding me of the Dr. Hook version.  I've seen it.  "I'm
sitting on the good side!" &lt;g&gt;

Yes, she is stunning there as well.

Great rendition of Delius comes out of that show as well.

&gt;Having joined the list somewhat late in life, and reading with great
&gt;interest the account of IED's Katemas party, I was wondering how many of
&gt;you here have actually MET IED, in person, and what the experience was
&gt;like.  Anybody with a 4'x4' poster of KT is certainly worth his own poll.

Well, Chris and I have never actually met IED, but we
have met Andrew Marvick quite a few times. I guess
IED was always too haughty to come out and say hi. :-)

Andrew though, is one of the nicest people you could
ever hope to meet. He's a Kate Bush fan extrodinaire,
and a wonderful human being.

I do believe Chris and I have the honor to have been
the first Love-Hounds to meet this lovely fella in person.
It was the end of 1983 and we already knew of Andrew from
the old Kate fanzine "BreakThrough". Chris and I took a
trip out to San Diego and while we were in SoCal we took
a brief trip up to Los Angeles to meet Armando Gallo, and
to attend a wonderful Kate fan party. That's when we met the
man in the flesh. If we hadn't been endeared enough by him,
he clinched it when he pulled out a video of "There Goes
A Tenner" which none of us had seen.

Ah, memories of the days when fandom thrills came in bits
and pieces, a single here, a video there, another *ALBUM!*,
another fan who feels the same way you do met, a snippet
of a press mention. All things that made/make the world seem
even more beautiful at the moment.

We've met Andrew many times more since that first meeting.
most recently at last year's Katemas. We've been in and out
of touch through the years, but he's the one who urged us
to get on the net and he was our go-between before we
actually did. In over 13 years of friendship, he has never
been anything but a kind, gracious, and patient friend, who
has always forgiven us even when we've been our most flaky.
He's a sweetheart, he is, and I love him dearly.

Hi all.

I have been amazed by the detail that this newsgroup goes into Kate's
songs, and I have been somewhat embarrassed about my misconceptions
about certain of them.

The most striking is the meanings behind The Ninth Wave that I had
shortly after it came out.

I thought it was about a probable (at the time) disaster with the space
shuttle. (please don't laugh)

Right in the beginning of 'Hello Earth', I could have sworn that it the
background NASA voices talking of a Columbia SS launch ended with the
repeating of the word "Malfunction". I even wrote it down as I heard it
then.
"Columbia now nine times the speed of sound."
"Roger that, and I've got a solid TACAN lock on, uhh, TACANs two and
three"
"Our tracking data, NAV data, and pre-planned trajectory are all
one..(garbled):"
KT: Hello Earth...
        BGV: "Malfunction."
KT: Hello Earth,
        BGV: "Malfunction"

I took the rest of the song to be about the view of a
spectator/supporter of the space program, whose view of the adventure of
space travel is very personal and romantic. After the intro and the
second 'Just look at it go..' the song descends into a dirge, as though
the rising and building song of the anticipation of a launch is suddenly
and unexpectedly ruined by disaster.

        The end of the dirge climbs slowly up, as if in determination not to be
dissuaded by the shock. Then the spectator seems to gather herself to
describe the event, somewhat sadly;
Hello Earth/ hello Earth../ watching a storm start to form/
Over America, can't do anything, just watch them swing with the wind/
Out to sea../ (a picture of the horrible blast cloud of Challenger
floating out to                 sea fills my mind at this verse.)
All you sailors! (Get out of the waves, get out of the water!
All lifesavers! (Get out of the waves, get out of the water!
All you cruisers! (Get out of the waves, get out of the water!
All you fishermen, race for home!
Go to sleep, Earth.
I was there at the birth,
Out of the cloud burst the head of the tempest. (again, the spectre of
Challenger's
                                                deathcloud fills my mind here)
Murderer! Murderer of {it all}[?]
                                  (as in accusation of the 'blame game' that
                                   always goes on in popular culture when
something
                                   unfortunate and tragic happens)

(then the song seems to move to the view of an astronaut for a moment)
Why did I go?/ Why did I go?

(again the dirge, while the small tone of the piece seems to reach up
again, as though denying the finality of mourning, ending with a sound
of sonar, which conjured up images of the desperate search for survivors
with submarines.)

Go to sleep, little earth... (I read that 'sleep'ing referred to a
ceasing of the
                              adventure of reaching beyond our planet; a
wishful and
                              ultra-romantic view of space travel that I shared;
                              a view that says that space travel is the
only true
                              universal reach for fulfillment for the
entire Earth.)

As I would listen to the rest of the Ninth Wave, I kept on hearing
references to both the effort of space travel, its romantic and
idealized conception in many people's minds, and the tie-in to the
hum-drum Luddite world's reaction to a possible disaster.(I tune in to
some friendly voices, talkin' 'bout stupid things.)
Dream of Sheep seems to me to be a song about the situation of a
survivor out in the sea, who waits for rescue..
Under Ice, seems to be a remembrance through the night in the cold
water, about the survivor's childhood, and meshes it with her
surroundings as searching goes on.
Waking The Witch seems to be an introspective by the survivor, who by
this time is despairing of her situation, despairing as to question why
such a thing happened to her, as she suffers from exhaustion and
visions.
Watching You Without Me, seems to be a sizing up of her mortality, as
she wonders how her loved one waits for her to be rescued, and wonders
how he'll get along if she dies.
Jig Of Life - this one convinced me that the underlying theme was that
of the striving for this dream of exploring and adventure, how it
touches something within all of us, that we were made to move out,  to
give to our children and their children some measure of hope from our
lives. The first voice seems to be that of the ideal of reaching space
personified, that the Goal Itself is singing to her, not to let the
dream die, because the dream belongs to the future, and that the dream
is an old memory, always driving the race.
        The second voice is the poetry of the dream; the frontier, the newness
and possibilities presented by the dream, the voice of futures
un-guessed at.

Like I said, don't laugh. It seemed incredibly well put together as an
interpretation at the time.

Then Challenger blew up. Unfortunately, I got visuals for my musings
about the
songs.

Oh well. Tell me what you all think of this take on TNW. (even though it
is completely wrong, I know.)

&gt; I have a CD player that holds 200 CD's and often let it play songs at

&gt; then the Band Aid, song "Feed the World", which reminded me of a
&gt; question that I  have often wondered. Does Kate sing on "Feed the
&gt; world", and if so is there any specific part where her voice is
&gt; predominant, or at least noticable? I know that I, as a very long and
&gt; loyal Kate fan(atic) could be chastised for not knowing this, and
&gt; should
&gt; be able to recognize her voice, but please humour me. Kindest reagrds
&gt; to
&gt; all. Phillp Holbrook


...I have an interview disc where, I distinctly remember, the topic of
Live Aid came up, and Kate said that she would have loved to have been
asked, but wasn't. There was no indication that she was particularly
upset about this, and no hint was given by the interviewer or the
interviewee as to why she was not invited. Could've been any number of
reasons, I suppose, most of them perfectly understandable.

Also, for you Bay Area Perro Des Amors, "The Innocents" is
playing this weekend at the Stanford Theatre (hey!  You'll get
this message just in time to realize it was last week!  or month!)

Also Also, speaking of Bay Area, will there be a Bay Area Katemas
this year?  Haven't heard a peep from The Usual Suspects.
