Wouldn't Elvis be about 68 years old?

Does anyone REALLY want to see a 68-year-old Elvis?  Brrr.

For those who are interested, here are the full details of the film, as
listed
in the Radio Times:

  The Comic Strip Presents...
  Les Dogs
  Last show in the series.
  At the point of death in a motor accident, businessman Victor relives a
  ten-year affair with a beautiful bride.
  Bride (Angela) ... KATE BUSH
  Groom (Jeff) ... DANNY PEACOCK
  Bride's mother ... MIRANDA RICHARDSON
  Groom's mother ... JULIE T. WALLACE
  Groom's father ... TIM MCINNERNY
  Best man ... ADRIAN EDMONDSON
  Victor ... PETER RICHARDSON
  Leader on TV ... KEITH ALLEN
  Danny ... STEVE O'DONNELL
  Brother-in-law ... CHRIS MALCOM
  Man shot ... JIMMY FAGG
  'Les Dogs' singer ... KEVIN ALLEN
  Waiter ... GARY BEADLE
  Head waiter ... GEORGE KAHN
  Written by PETER RICHARDSON and PETE RICHENS
  Directed by PETER RICHARDSON
  Executive producer MICHAEL WHITE
  A Comic Strip presentation for BBCtv

It's interesting that Kate is given lead billing even though she
really only has a bit-part and hardly says a word.

&gt;    Ironic don't you think that the christian faith should adopt such a

When it comes down to it, most of the major Christian festivals are just
thinly disguided pagan ones.  In fact, they didn't even bother to come up
with a new name for Easter (it's named after the pagan goddess Eastre).

He does exist.

He writes a mean round of Kate Bush Jeopardy.

If you want to find out what IED is like, come to the Katemas Party in San

&gt;

And let's not forget our favorite pagan holiday, December 25th.  It's the
alleged birthday of the goddess Mythra -- Christianity "borrowed" the
date back in 300-something A.D.

Being in space is not what causes time to slowdown.  It is under going
acceleration with regard to a given frame of reference.

&gt; Remember the Theory of Relativity? A man who travels into space returns
&gt; a younger man than a man of the same age who stays on Earth. Thus, as
&gt; long as Ron remained in space from the moment he heard Wuthering Heights
&gt; in 1978 at the age of 18, until he returned this year at the age of 35,
&gt; it is feasible that he is ''younger.''
&gt;         My question is, how did he keep track of all the KB material
&gt;after 1978
&gt; if he was in Space all that time?

Er.. my take on it? It's about love, and sex.  Go on, "under the leaves..
go right to the white rose"  it is rather suggestive.

Mebbe that's just me.

        Kira
        who once danced an interpretive modern dance to "Under the Ivy"
in dance class, in senior year in high school, in 1986. It was a silly
dance in a dress from Pier 1 that was supposed to look like a Greek chiton.
And I was in *luv*, for the first time, that year, with my best friend,
who occasionally seemed to return my feelings. This may have something to
do with my interpretation of the song.

&gt; Last time I checked "Kate Bush Complete" it specifically said "ship"...

I believe this would fall under "editorial license" by the book's
author.  "Ship" makes no sense.  Prior consensus is the book is
wrong.

Still waiting to check the new HoL for "Columbia"/"Well, we are"...

Hey there fellow Kate fans.  I was reading a newspaper article the other
day which mentioned Kate Bush.  HOwever, in the article, she was referred
to as the "sadly deceased" Kate Bush.  Tell me this is not true.  I've
been out of the loop for a while, so this is the first time I've heard
anything like that.  Please clarify.  RG

This line always makes me think of Winston Churchill's funeral barge on
