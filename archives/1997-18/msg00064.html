Hi all,

I just got around to picking up the EMI HoL reissue from my personal CD buyer.

At the same time, I got:

Glen Matlock - "Who's he think he is when he's at home?"
-- Awesome popish punk by the Sex Pistols' founding bassist (he wrote
"Pretty Vacant") and the bassist in the wonderful Rich Kids (former Rich
Kid Steve New plays guitar on the record, as does Derwood Andrews of
Generation X) and Specters.

John's Children - "Smashed! Blocked!"
-- Mind-blowing psycho/psychedelic mod/pop '60s group with T. Rex's Marc Bolan.

The Creation - "How Does It Feel to Feel"
-- Singles collection of '60s psychedelic/mod maximum r&amp;b (with the
Faces/Stones Ronnie Wood on guitar on "The Girls Are Naked") band. "Our
music is red - with purple flashes," explained guitaris Eddie Phillips (who
was asked to join The Who during the Creation's rise). You think Jimmy Page
invented playing a guitar with a violin bow? Nope. He started doing it
after hearing Phillips do it on the "Making Time" single.

The Professionals - "The Professionals"
-- Post-Sex Pistols work from Steve Jones (guitar) and Paul Cook (drums).
Fun, goofy, loud, loutish, punk/pop.

The Yardbirds - "...where the Action is!"
-- Two-CD set with 27 songs from BBC sessions, plus 8 from a live show in
Stockholm in '67. Any Yardbirds record with "Goodnight Sweet Josephine" I
gotta have! Plus two blistering covers of "Most Likely You'll Go Your Way",
plus all the usual hits.

David Bowie -- "The Dearm Anthology 1966-1968"
-- Runs the gamut from swinging London pop like "Love You Till Tuesday" to
hippy weirdness like "Rubber Band" and the original version of "Space
Oddity."

The Jam - "Direction Reaction Creation"
-- 5 CDs. 117 songs. All you need is this and the "Extras" CDs and you're set.

Next trip to the record store will be for more NEW stuff (only the Glen
Matlock CD is of new stuff).

&gt;&gt; &gt;I have a CD player that holds 200 CD's and often let it play songs at

&gt;&gt; &gt;random, and my player played Back to Back songs, "Army Dreamers", and
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;then the Band Aid, song "Feed the World", which reminded me of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;question that I  have often wondered. Does Kate sing on "Feed the
&gt;&gt; &gt;world", and if so is there any specific part where her voice is
&gt;&gt; &gt;predominant, or at least noticable? I know that I, as a very long and
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;loyal Kate fan(atic) could be chastised for not knowing this, and
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt; &gt;be able to recognize her voice, but please humour me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, that was Tori Amos.

&gt;
&gt;I have to say that this sounds improbable. You really mean that? Live
&gt;Aid was--if my memory is correct and we're talking about the same
&gt;event--in 1985. I never heard about Tori Amos until 1991, and I doubt if
&gt;she was well-known outside her local environment much before that. Am I
&gt;missing something here?

Yeah...the part where you said "please humour me."

&gt;KT: Hello Earth,

&gt;

What you're hearing as "malfunction" is actually a man's voice saying
"hello earth" just after Kate sings it -- try listening on headphones.

Like you Brian, I also took to staying in on a beautiful Saturday afternoon
to watch VH1's marathon of "The history of all videos - ever", as it was
billed, as I was terrificly curious to see which videos of Kates would be
played.  I came in toward the beginning of the B's, which took hours on end
in and of itself, as many long forgotten, insignificant bands were dusted off
and brought out of the basement for this special marathon.  Then, just as my
investment of time was about to pay off, here came the C's.  I was ready to
spit fire, I tell you.  No Kate ?  How could the Goddess of Music be
overlooked, even by those uptight VH1 dolts ?  Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.....

Hi!

Sorry to waste the bandwidth, but I can't think of anything else to do.

I'm trying to send a reply to Winter (enzo1@enzo1@idt.net), but no matter
how I permutate your reply-to address the message bounces as "user unknown"
or "unknown host name" or some other "fatal error".  Please e-me again if
you see this, and let me know what your real e-dress is!!!  Thanks... :)

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am very new at Louve-hounds things but a long time devoted Kate
&gt; fan. I read about all the messages about the early demos. I am desperate
&gt; to find those. In France, i still can't find the remasterised
&gt; HoL yet. So for the demos i think it's impossible. Are they part
&gt; of a "special demos album" or did you guys found this in strange ways? 3-)
&gt; And, there is the songs Ne t'Enfuis Pas and Un Baiser d'Enfant. Kate
&gt; sings in my language and i never heard this !!! Again, could you please
&gt; help me to make my ears smile (...), you'll make a french man happy...
&gt;
&gt; Paix, amour et kate
&gt; Stephane

Hi,
if no one replay to you write back to me and I will recording all the
demos and "NTeP" + "UBdE" for you, OK?

Ciao,
Tina
