Hi,

I am very new at Louve-hounds things but a long time devoted Kate
fan. I read about all the messages about the early demos. I am desperate
to find those. In France, i still can't find the remasterised
HoL yet. So for the demos i think it's impossible. Are they part
of a "special demos album" or did you guys found this in strange ways? 3-)
And, there is the songs Ne t'Enfuis Pas and Un Baiser d'Enfant. Kate
sings in my language and i never heard this !!! Again, could you please
help me to make my ears smile (...), you'll make a french man happy...

Paix, amour et kate

Hi Leigh,

You must listen to TRS more! &lt;grin&gt;  Kate would never disappoint.  On my
initial listen I was not nuts about the record.  But then I began to
like it a lot on subsequent listenings.

Dan

&gt;
&gt;      Hi Dan, Hi Ron
&gt;
&gt;      Dan - I have to agree with Ron as far as TRS is concerned - every
&gt;      other KB CD I have is practically worn down to the plastic, except
&gt;      TRS.
&gt;
&gt;      In TKI, LH, TD, HOL and TSW I cannot find a favourite nor a hated
&gt;      track.  However, no matter how many times I listen to TRS, I find it
&gt;      cold and staccato in places (so sue me).  I'm afraid indifference has
&gt;      taken me on this one.
&gt;
&gt;      Slatings one at a time please.
&gt;
&gt;      Leigh

&gt; Ron,
&gt;
&gt; I have to disagree with you on The Red Shoes and The Sensual World.
&gt; Comparing the Cure material to the The Sensual World?  Check out the
&gt; vocals on Eat the Music; they are sublime.  I trust Kate's judgement.  I
&gt; am at her mercy.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My own preferences? (Everyone else seems to have a list.):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   1. Hounds of Love--possibly the most delightful musical surprise I
&gt; &gt; ever had (late November 1985). After hearing RUTH on the radio a couple
&gt; &gt; of times, I patiently waited until the CD came out, and took a chance on
&gt; &gt; it (never heard anything else by Kate).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   2. The Dreaming--OK, this is not for everybody, I know, but I connect
&gt; &gt; to it on a level I can't explain. Funny thing is, the criticisms I've
&gt; &gt; heard of TD ("Dark, brooding...") are almost opposite to what people
&gt; &gt; said about HOL (from "Rock's eternal kid", as one Rolling Stone reviewer
&gt; &gt; called her)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   3. Never For Ever. The material isn't as moving as on the above two,
&gt; &gt; but it certainly has some amazing vocal demo moments ("Violin" is
&gt; &gt; nothing if not impressive singing, from a purely stunt/technical
&gt; &gt; standpoint).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   4. TKI, LH These have their moments, but that high, "drunk little
&gt; &gt; girl" voice--well, a little goes a long way.
&gt; &gt; Some of the lyrics on TKI are pretty obscure too--although I know that,
&gt; &gt; with Kate, once you get the idea what a song is about, often it all
&gt; &gt; suddenly pops into focus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  5. TSW--Again, some really beautiful parts, but I think the influences
&gt; &gt; on her were not the best for creating her best music--Why didn't she
&gt; &gt; just front for the Cure for a few years, it might've had the same
&gt; &gt; effect?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6. TRS--I don't get this one at all, except as (1) a reach for
&gt; &gt; commercial appeal, and (2) a reaction to themes of despair and death,
&gt; &gt; prompted by her mother's death (but only in places).

Summary: My Computer - Kate with Prince

I recently borrowed the latest Prince CD 'Emancipation' and Kate sings
background vocals on the third CD - a song called 'My computer'. Prince
acknowledges Kate 'Thanx Kate'

The inspiration behind this song must have been from 'Deeper
understanding'

Overall, its a good song. Its worth checking the song out, even if you
are not a prince fan

Some time ago I read that Kate preferred her demos of 'The Dreaming'
to the finished product. Can anyone out there help me find a copy of
these. I check lists from time to time, but nobody seems to have them.

Please, someone, anyone, tell me to calm down and keep things in
perspective. Over the fourth of July weekend, VH1 presented a marathon,
"The Greatest Videos Ever."  I waited hours to see Kate and guess what? No
Kate.  A marathon rife with the big names and the countless no names but
no Kate.  What is the problem here?  WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?  Should I be glad that Kate wasn't among so much
mediocrity?  Somehow, that doesn't make things better.  I though VH1 liked
Kate.   ARGGGHHHH!

&gt;
&gt; vampyre@tarheel.net


Wow...is it possible Kate was inspired by "A Flea In Her Ear?"
for Babooshka? We know that she's taken inspiration from movies
before, so why not a play?

It all fits -- from the "pseudonym to fool him" and the "scented
letters" to "arranging a place to go."

My favorite line in the play comes when Mme Chandebise, who
wants to see if her husband "will fall for her incognito" rents
a seedy hotel room to catch him:


Mme Chandebise: Oh, we won't be needing the bed.

Hotel clerk: Pervert.

Yeppers! I have one album _Everything Could
Be So Perfect..._ which I adore. My favorite
songs are "Intermission (the gods are bored),"
and "The 1000 Colours Waltz" (songs that I
played on my radio show and added to tape
compilations numerous times over the years).
It's hard to describe the music, she's like a cross
between Edith Piaf and Carmel, with a dark,
husky, powerful voice and a subtle sense of
humor. How would you describe her?

Do you know anything about her? Do you know
what she's doing now? Do you know how many
albums she has? I know nothing. I bought the
LP on the advice of a friend who bought it just
because she liked the looks of it, and then I
re-bought it on CD (a Japanese import) a few
years ago.
