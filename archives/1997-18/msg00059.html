&gt; When it comes down to it, most of the major Christian festivals are

&gt; goddess Eastre).

[I'll keep this short, since Pagan topics are semi-off-topic here,
unless they pertain to KaTe--if you want to continue this discussion,
take it off list or to a Pagan forum. I wouldn't post this at
all, except bad etymology is one of my pet peeves, so you'll
have to suffer through this post. *grin* Thanks!]

Actually, that's only true in English and some other Germanic
languages, though not all--the word for Easter in Dutch is "Pas,"
for instance. The word for "Easter" in many languages comes from
Passover, the Jewish holiday that is the direct precursor to Easter
(since the Last Supper was a Passover Seder). Even in English,
there's the word "Paschal" meaning "Easter-time." Passover is around
the time of the Spring Equinox (and is probably originally an Equinox
festival, with historical "justifications" added later, since most
Jewish holidays are originally seasonal in origin), so some Germanic
speakers used their name for the Spring Equinox festival for Easter.
(The bunnies and eggs are probably Pagan in origin, though.) This is
similar to "Yule" being a name for Christmas; Yule was originally a
12 day Germanic feast.

For years I heard this line as "the green on the grave" -- rather than "on
the gray" -- and this conjured up *exactly* the image you describe.  And it
is SUCH an archetypal Kate image, to go hiding in an ivy-strewn graveyard,
that I still suspect this is what she had in mind.  She does seem to be
singing "on the grey" but we can't rule out the possibility that it was
originally written as "grave" and she changed it later.  To avoid an
unnecessarily morbid connotation?  To keep from revealing too personal an
image?  Whichever, it obviously didn't work well enough.  :-)

I have a CD player that holds 200 CD's and often let it play songs at
random. This afternoon I was working at my PC while playing CD's at
random, and my player played Back to Back songs, "Army Dreamers", and
then the Band Aid, song "Feed the World", which reminded me of a
question that I  have often wondered. Does Kate sing on "Feed the
world", and if so is there any specific part where her voice is
predominant, or at least noticable? I know that I, as a very long and
loyal Kate fan(atic) could be chastised for not knowing this, and should
be able to recognize her voice, but please humour me. Kindest reagrds to
all. Phillp Holbrook

No, that was Tori Amos.

&gt; 1st album bought: The Dreaming
&gt; Why: Cool cover. I'd seen The Kick Inside when I worked in a record shop
&gt; in 1979 but didn't make the connection on first glimpse of tD. I was
&gt; interested in dreams at the time &amp; that photo sure looked like one.
&gt; Those drums starting off Sat In Your Lap practically made me a fan right
&gt; there.
&gt; Kate albs I own: all except for Red Shoes (has she made anything since?)
&gt; Top three in order: tD, HoL, NFE
&gt; Top three tunes in order: Get Out of my House, Gaffa, Jig of Life (this
&gt; list would likely change daily)
&gt;
&gt; I came looking for this group because I'm reading The Night Is Large by
&gt; Martin Gardner, with an essay about the guy that Cloudbusting is
&gt; apparently based on. (And I'm sure someone here has made the connection
&gt; between Cloudbusting and Hawkwind's Orgone Accumulator, right? &lt;g&gt;) What
&gt; a crock! Has Kate ever talked about him? I'm curious about her take on
&gt; this rainmaking machine of his.

I have always assumed that "Cloudbusting" was a thinly disguised
re-telling of Wilhelm Reich's story -- and his orgone energy machine.
