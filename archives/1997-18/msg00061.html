I read in a book that Kate was traumatized by the death of a stage hand
on her only tour.  He fell through a hole in the stage down some 50
feet.  I don't think Kate would be traumatized by skin.  After all she
did write Sensual World!

&gt; &gt; The reason why Kate never intend to tour again is that she is
&gt; &gt; traumatized for live. Do you remember the live-performance of 'The
&gt; &gt; Wedding List'? The hilarious annex embarrassing but very professional
&gt; &gt; resolved appearance were Kate's spagetti-straps spring loose. I have
&gt; &gt; noticed that every live-performance after this one, Kate wears a lot
&gt; &gt; of clothes (never bare arms again and a jacket for the security).
&gt; &gt; What do you think of this.
&gt;
&gt;     You mean the one where she almost exposed herself to HRH Prince
&gt; Charles?
&gt;
&gt;     Actually, I think her more conservative clothing choices are more
&gt; due to fashion (who wears spaghetti tops in this day and age? Other
&gt; than Tori, that is.) I also think she is self-conscious about her weight.
&gt; Some of the charity events and Wogan appearances happened during
&gt; periods when Kate would be in the studio drinking tea and munching on
&gt; Kit-Kats...several years of sitting in one place can have the effect of
&gt; of putting on a few more pounds than the vicious hacks of the UK
&gt; music press will "allow".
&gt;
&gt;     As Kathleen Turner said: "After a certain age, you can either keep
&gt; your face or your body". I'd hate to see Kate destroy her face in a
&gt; vain attempt to maintain the body of a 19 year old...a la Jane Fonda.
&gt;
&gt; Myself, I don't care what weight she is...as long as she keeps producing
&gt; music. But I hope that isn't why she's stayed off the road.

Hello in there,

Don't you think that You want alchemy and show a little devotion are
much better songs then the songs on TRS (except Moments of pleasure
ofcourse). The B-sides songs are often of a better artistic quality
(Under the ivy, Burning Bridge etc..)

&gt; For those of you interested, there is a webpage dedicated to the Lilith
Fair at
&gt; Nettwerk's site (www.nettwerk.com).  It contains a schedule of each show's
&gt; artists and on which show they'll be appearing.  I am disappointed to hear
&gt; that Sarah was not impressive.  She has been incredibly so in the past!

Better yet, go directly to www.lilithfair.com.

I went to the Salem, Oregon show.  The venue was very disappointing.  The
line just to get in was 45 minutes long.  They didn't allow people to bring
water bottles in with them (yet sold bottled water at the concessions).
The concessions area was too narrow and blocked the main thouroughfare
between the stages.

The music, though, was pretty good.  The early acts were too short (1/2
hour ea.).  Suzanne Vega was one of these, and seemed to treat the whole
thing as kind of a lark.  She didn't have a full band backing her and
didn't seem to have the energy that I've seen/heard in other performances.

Sarah McLachlan definitely had the best sound, but no-one matched the
energy of Paula Cole (who credits HoL as one of her inspirations).

My first post so I have a lot of catching up to do.
Talk talk is one of the few 80's bands I will admit to listening to still,
along with:
ABC
Aha
Dexy's
til tuesday

Rest of my list would include:
Aimee Mann
Heather Nova
Sarah McLachlan
Sheila Chandra
Rose Chronicles (Canadian on Nettwerk Records)
Dubstar
Beth Orton....etc....the list could go on forever

Age poll thing (albeit a little tardy with my response):
I'm 30 discovered Kate at about age 12 in '79 on the Kenny Everett Show
which they use to play on some Canadian TV station. Fell in love and awe
immediately
Fave album would have to be HoL followed closely by the Dreaming

My Top Five (for today):
1. Night of the Swallow
2. L'Amour Looks Something...
3. Burning Bridge
4. This Womans Work
5. And Dream of Sheep

Gawd, that was difficult (and long...Sorry)
Cheers,
scott

&gt;
&gt; in anticipation of Kate's birthday, german music channel
&gt; Viva II will air a one-hour special on Monday, July 28
&gt; at 20:00 MESZ ("Vinyl-Xtra").
&gt; I wonder how that will look like, I always thought they've
&gt; got only three Kate videos.
&gt;
&gt; VH-1 will also play some Kate videos on July 30, between
&gt; 16:00 and 18:00 ("Cafe VH-1").
&gt;
&gt; ciao,
&gt; Rolf

Will this be in Europe only? Or is VH-1 formatted uniformly
throughout the world? Seeing a Kate vid broadcast in the US just
seems like too much to hope for...the last one I saw was the
wogan version of RuTH on empty-V circa 1985. No, really.  :-(

Hello all.  Just a point I'd like to clarify.  I think the post on the
origin of December 25th is incorrect.  I don't know of any goddess
Mythra.  Rather, there is a Persian god Mithras, a sun god, who was
adopted by the Romans during the empire.  The Romans also had a
festival, known as the Saturnalia (in honor of the god Saturn).  This
festival began about December 17 and lasted a week to 10 days.  During
it, gifts were exchanged and masters switched places with their
servants.  This also has some bearing on the adoption of December 25 as
Christ's "birthday."

Any other classicists on the list?  Someone referred to a Greek chiton
so I know there must be at least one other!@!

&gt;Hey there fellow Kate fans.  I was reading a newspaper article the other
&gt;day which mentioned Kate Bush.  HOwever, in the article, she was referred
&gt;to as the "sadly deceased" Kate Bush.  Tell me this is not true.  I've
&gt;been out of the loop for a while, so this is the first time I've heard
&gt;anything like that.  Please clarify.  RG

   Kate is alive and well and working on her next album tentatively entitled
"It'll Be Ready When It's Finished, Dammit!"

Neither Kate (nor Tori) perform on this track, though Kate did
provide a short solo for Ferry Aid's "Let It Be" and an even
shorter one for Spirit of the Rainforest's "Spirit of the
