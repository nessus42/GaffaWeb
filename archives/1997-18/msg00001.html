I read in a book that Kate was traumatized by the death of a stage hand
on her only tour.  He fell through a hole in the stage down some 50
feet.  I don't think Kate would be traumatized by skin.  After all she
did write Sensual World!

&gt; &gt; The reason why Kate never intend to tour again is that she is
&gt; &gt; traumatized for live. Do you remember the live-performance of 'The
&gt; &gt; Wedding List'? The hilarious annex embarrassing but very professional
&gt; &gt; resolved appearance were Kate's spagetti-straps spring loose. I have
&gt; &gt; noticed that every live-performance after this one, Kate wears a lot
&gt; &gt; of clothes (never bare arms again and a jacket for the security).
&gt; &gt; What do you think of this.
&gt; 
&gt;     You mean the one where she almost exposed herself to HRH Prince
&gt; Charles?
&gt; 
&gt;     Actually, I think her more conservative clothing choices are more
&gt; due to fashion (who wears spaghetti tops in this day and age? Other
&gt; than Tori, that is.) I also think she is self-conscious about her weight.
&gt; Some of the charity events and Wogan appearances happened during
&gt; periods when Kate would be in the studio drinking tea and munching on
&gt; Kit-Kats...several years of sitting in one place can have the effect of
&gt; of putting on a few more pounds than the vicious hacks of the UK
&gt; music press will "allow".
&gt; 
&gt;     As Kathleen Turner said: "After a certain age, you can either keep
&gt; your face or your body". I'd hate to see Kate destroy her face in a
&gt; vain attempt to maintain the body of a 19 year old...a la Jane Fonda.
&gt; 
&gt; Myself, I don't care what weight she is...as long as she keeps producing
&gt; music. But I hope that isn't why she's stayed off the road.
