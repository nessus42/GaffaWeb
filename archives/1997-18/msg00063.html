Last episode, Matt sez:

&gt; And a non-Kashka observation: On side 1 of HOL, we hear "It's you and
&gt; me" as a theme.  "It's you and me, Daddy" (and also on the b-side
&gt; "Burning Bridge" "It's you and me baby, against the world!").
&gt;
&gt; I just realized today the contrast with the OTHER side, "Under Ice":
&gt; "It's ME!"

THIS is why I love Kate Bush.

Something will just leap out and make its presence known, when you least
expect it.

Deliberate?  I say possibly maybe.

Hello,

Can anybody tell me on which bootleg I can find 'Organic Acid'?
I've bought 'Cathy's home demos' and that the only song I'm missing.

Several years ago I heard a version of 'Shame shame shame' sung by
Kate at a KTfriend of mine. Unfortunately I've no contact with her
anymore? Does anybody got that number?

Ans does anybody got a copy of the song that is used in 'The Magician
of Lublin'?

Friendly greetings,

&gt;
&gt; Hmm, this song is quite important to me .. maybe a matter of
&gt; interpreting more into than it is ...


Don't let the interview throw your devotion to this song. Kate
is often demurely obstinate when speaking about particular
songs. I suspect that, as beautiful and poignant as this song
is, that it's actually one of her "pets."

Someone else wrote that they thought this song was sexual in
nature. I've always thought so too. The directive to "go under
the ivy etc." seems almost to be a non-sequitur from the
tormented lyrics...as if she's simply indulging in an escape.

Hi!

Kira posted:

&gt;In addition to Kate, here is part of a very long list of music I listen to:
&gt;
&gt;Ingrid Karklins

Yow!!!  It's rare to see someone I don't know who lists Ingrid in the
rotation in their CD player.  I just saw her perform yesterday evening, in
fact: at a teeny-tiny living-room-like venue in Middletown, Connecticut
called The Buttonwood Tree.  She's on her way to Latvia, and stopped over
on her way from Austin just to play there.  It was stunning.  Her new
album, _Red Hand_ will be released this fall, and judging by the songs I
heard last night, it's going to be *amazing*.

Are you aware of her mailing list?  (Apologies if you're on it and post
constantly and I just haven't noticed. :})  E-mail me if you want more info.

&gt;Happy Rhodes

Yay!  :)

&gt;Anonymous 4

Double yay!!!  Medieval music is my secret passion.  Yum.

&gt;Jane Siberry (but not as much as I used to)

NYC 'Hounds may be interested to learn that Jane will be performing at
Irving Plaza this coming Friday night as part of the Intel New Music
Festival.  Whee.

&gt;Caroline Lavelle

I hear she plays on Loreena McKennitt's new album which has been recorded
but won't be released until the end of the year.  &lt;slaver&gt;

What an amazing list.  Are you aware of the ecto list?  Just wondering...

&gt; &gt;Unfortunately for them she was in no fit state to do anything else for
&gt; &gt;at least 6 months. EMI were forced to change their minds in the end
&gt; &gt;though - the Americans loved TD. You still do, don't you?
&gt; &gt;

Well...*I* do, but I don't think The Dreaming was much of a
commercial success here -- at least not to the degree that would
make EMI eat their words.

It's possible that -- since it is such a huge market here, and
since TD was only the second album released (behind TKI) -- that
EMI did make more money from American than from UK sales. I
think TD sold in the tens of thousands (60,000?) in the UK. An
album could very well sell that many copies here without even
appearing in the charts.

I do think TD was reviewed well here. I do remember Kate herself
noting that. In some interview or other, she mentioned the harsh
reviews in the UK and being surprised that the American reaction
was much kinder. She was surprised because, musically,
Americans are not big on the experimental and different.

I also remember one great review (wish I'd saved it) in "Song
Hits" magazine which described TD as "not exactly rock music"
but hastily added that audiences "should check this out!"

TD was my first Kate album. I was dismayed to hear its weird
textures upon my first listen (when I'd chanced a whole $8 on
it!). "How could someone so obviously talented vocally be so
misguided musically?" I thought. That "hackles on the cat
STANDING" line was as powerful a belt as anything my then
favorite, Pat Benatar could offer. But the rest of it...yech!

But then it grew on me...and grew and grew! I listen to Kate so
often now, that it leaves the hackles on some of my friends
STANDING!

And, BTW, it wasn't the review which prompted me to buy the
album. It was Benatar's cover version of WH, written by some K.
Bush, that made me want to investigate. I wonder if I would've
ever run across Kate otherwise.

&gt;listen to the red shoes album

   Not quite complete. Squiggle-man (who we call "Skippy" round
here) did colaborate with Kate on "Why Should I Love You" on
"The Red Shoes". But most recently Kate returned the favor with
vocals on "My Computer" on his "Emancapation" triple-album.

   Note: don't buy this record for Kate's vocals...you need
IED's ears to pull Kate's vocal out.

delius2@aol.com (Delius2) asks about "up yours ugly":
&gt;anybody know why that is etched on the 7 inch picture disk single of "This

   It's a line from "The Young Ones", one of Kate's
favorite TV shows. Why Kate inscribed it on the record
is one for the ages.

   Heh...I'd like a copy too!

   Actually, Kate had stated that she had to work very hard
re-creating the "feel" of the demos in the final studio version.
She beat this problem by building her own full-fledged studio,
replacing the demo studio where she built the demos of The Dreaming.

   All albums after that have been built onto the master tapes
from her first inspiration.

   As far as demos of "The Dreaming"...not a chance! Kate has
control of all her master tapes, and since "Hounds Of Love"
everything has remained in her control. Nothing (to my knowledge)
has slipped out.

&gt;I am very new at Louve-hounds things but a long time devoted Kate
&gt;fan.

   Welcome! We're glad that you're here.

&gt;I read about all the messages about the early demos. I am desperate
&gt;to find those. In France, i still can't find the remasterised
&gt;HoL yet. So for the demos i think it's impossible. Are they part
&gt;of a "special demos album" or did you guys found this in strange ways? 3-)

   All the demos are bootlegs. The only pre-"The Kick Inside" song that
Kate has released is "Passing Through Air"...and she played "Davey"
on a radio show.

   The history of the Demos can be found on Gaffaweb at:

<A  HREF="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/phoenix/">http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/phoenix/</A>

   Gaffaweb is a web site built by a group of Lovehounds, and
features a dictionary of Kate words and people, loads of pictures,
interviews, reviews, archives of posts, a discography and videography
and more.

&gt;And, there is the songs Ne t'Enfuis Pas and Un Baiser d'Enfant. Kate
&gt;sings in my language and i never heard this !!! Again, could you please
&gt;help me to make my ears smile (...), you'll make a french man happy...

   Actually there's been some debate about Kate's usage of the French
language. It would be interesting to hear from a native speaker.

   For a very short period of time, I have MP3 versions of these two
songs on a web page at:

<A  HREF="http://www.wwa.com/%7Echrisw/music/">http://www.wwa.com/%7Echrisw/music/</A>

   This will not stay up long, and is not intended as a replacement
for purchasing Kate's music. But these two songs are not available
commercially except on the "This Woman's Work" box set.
