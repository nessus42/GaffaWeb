     Late news comes from EMI in the UK that EMI are considering the
release of some of Kate Bush's "oldies" singles on CD.
_International_Compact_Disk_Exchange_, better known as _ICE_, reports
in its latest issue that a spokesman for EMI said the company was
exploring the possibility of entering the CD-3 arena through the
release of oldies singles by EMI artists, including Kate Bush and
David Bowie. The company had not set dates yet for such releases,
however, and they had not yet decided whether the CD-3 format (3" CD
single) was the right way to go, because they were concerned by
reports from consumers of CD-3 adaptors jamming in some players.
Presumably, however, once EMI decide what format to adopt, one or more
of Kate's early singles will be among the first CD-singles they
release.

   P.S.: In much less important CD news, a Dutch CD label has
just released Riuichi Sakamoto's _B-2_Unit_ LP on CD. This album
was one of several YMO solo projects which, inexplicably, have
never been released on CD, even by the Japanese. The sound of this
CD is extremely good. Now with a little luck Takahashi's _Neuromantic_,
_What,_Me_Worry?_ and _Wild_and_Moody_ LPs, and Hosono's _Philharmony_
will start showing up on import shelves at last...
     Other albums that IED wishes the stupid record executives would
have the sense to put out on CD:

     Bill Nelson: _Getting_the_Holy_Ghost_Across_ and its attendant EP,
                  _Living_for_the_Spangled_Moment_;
     Monsoon: _Third_Eye_;
     John Foxx: _Metamatic_, _The_Garden_ and _The_Golden_Section_;
     New MusiK: _From_A_to_B_, _Anywhere_ and _Warp_;
     Susan: _Do_You_Believe_in_Mazik?_ and _The_Girl_Can't_Help_It_;
     Sandii and the Sunsetz: _Heat_Scale_ and _Dreams_of_Immigrants_;
     Miharu Koshi: _Tutu_ and _Parallelisme_;
     Ippu-Do: _Night_Mirage_ and _Live_and_Zen_;
     Masami Tsuchiya: _Rice_Music_;
     Data: _Elegant_Machinery_;
     Peter Godwin: _Correspondence_;
     Ultravox: _Ultravox!_, _Ha!_Ha!_Ha!_, and _Systems_of_Romance_.

     What IED can't understand is why these and hundreds of other
older rock/pop LPs haven't been put out on CD. There's plenty of
capacity at the plants now, and even the least successful pop LP
(3,000 to 7,000 units sold) does better than probably half of the jazz
and classical CDs that come out, so some profit is virtually
guaranteed in every case. So what is the fucking problem???
     Sorry for airing this dirty laundry, but if not in Love-Hounds,
where?
