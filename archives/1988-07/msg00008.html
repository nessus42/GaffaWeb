     Following are the Constitution and By-laws of the Wickham
Street Irregulars (WSI).


                         CONSTITUTION

_Article_1_

     The name of this society shall be the Wickham Street Irregulars.

_Article_2_

     Its purpose shall be the study of the Sacred Works.

_Article_3_

     All persons shall be eligible for membership who pass an
examination in the Sacred Works set by officers of the society, and
who are considered otherwise suitable.

_Article_4_

     The officers shall be: an Inquisitor, a Mother,
and a Cold Gun.
     The duties of the Inquisitor shall be those commonly
performed by a President.
     The duties of the Mother shall be those commonly
performed by a Secretary.
     The duties of the Cold Gun shall be to telephone down for
ice, spirits, waldorfs, Kit Kat bars, chocolate eclairs, and whatever
else may be required and available; to conduct all negotiations
with waiters; and to assess the members pro rata for the cost of
same.

                             BY-LAWS

 1. An annual meeting shall be held on July 30, at which the canonical
toasts shall be drunk; after which the members shall drink and eat
at will.

	[ Oops, it look like this made it out a little too late for
	  this year...  Sorry 'bout that Andy...  -- |&gt;oug ]

 2. The current round of drinks shall be bought by any member who
fails to identify, by title of song and context, any quotation from
the Sacred Works submitted by any other member.
    _Qualification_A_. If two or more members fail so to identify,
a round shall be bought by each of those so failing.
    _Qualification_B_. If the submitter of the quotation, upon challenge,
fails to identify it correctly, he/she shall buy the round.

 3. Special meetings may be called at any time or place
by any one of three members, two of whom shall constitute a quorum.
    _Qualification_A_. If said two people are of opposite sexes,
they shall use care in selecting the place of meeting, to avoid
misinterpretation (or interpretation either, for that matter).

 4. All other business shall be left for the monthly meeting.

 5. There shall be no monthly meeting.


                     ADDITIONAL NOTES

 1. The examination is incomplete as of this writing. When completed,
the examination will be made available to all readers of Love-Hounds
who may ask for it. All those who send IED correct solutions -- but
they must be correct in every detail -- will automatically become
members of the Wickham Street Irregulars.

 2. Those who solve the examination will then be notified of the time
and place of the first annual meeting.

 3. The first order of business for the first annual meeting will be
the choosing of an official toast. It has already been suggested that
the first health be drunk to "Emily".  Succeeding sentiments have been
put forward for "_The_ Man (Del Palmer)", "Dennis", "Kashka", "Emma",
"Peter", "Alfred", "Werner", "Rolf", "Eberhard", and anyone or
anything else one might care to name.

     That is all.

-- Andrew Marvick, Acting Inquisitor, pending review by
   a quorum of the WSI.
