&gt; [Brian Berns:] learn to spell, Mr. Philosophy Degree

Well, Mr. Berns, I congratulate you on your remarkable editing
abilities.  To be able to spot a minor typo in my comment and point it
out to everyone -- my, such keen observation must be an arduous task!
Unfortunately, I think your much appreciated efforts will be
misinterpreted by most people.  You see, most of the unwashed masses
see such nitpickery as the surest sign that the speaker has nothing
substantial to say.

As to your concerns that MIT may have been negligent in granting a
degree to someone who cannot even tell the difference between
"answers" and "answer's", I understand your concern.  MIT was just
about to take my degree back, but I managed to convince them that it
was only a typo -- a slip of the finger -- and that I would be more
careful in the future.  I hope that you will also allow this second
chance.

Some professors and students here are trying to overturn the policy
that perfect spelling is required for a degree.  They say that
spelling is pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things and that it
descriminates against those who are dyslectic.  Now, I'm somewhat
dyslectic, but I will have nothing of this.  Both you and I know that
it worth spending every waking moment to prefect one's spelling.  The
effort does not result in wasted brain cells -- rather it results in a
better understanding of the universe, man, and his place in it!

&gt; This has got to be the silliest idea I have seen in quite awhile.
&gt; Do either of you honestly think even Kate would agree with this?  Am
&gt; I to believe that anything besides blind devotion to every note is
&gt; going to be denigrated by the Twin Twits of this group?

Your concern about us is very justifiable, Mr. Berns.  Both IED and
myself are quite stock raving mad.  We always take ourselves 100%
seriously, and never speak in jest.  Something should be done about
us!  Funny thing is, I think that comment from IED was in response to
something by me where I criticised one of Kate's songs.  Me criticize
something by Kate!  I just can't fathom what got into me.  Pardon me
while I go stick my head in the Bassomatic...
