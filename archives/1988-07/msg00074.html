<PRE>
     First off IED would like to thank |&gt;oug for altering his format
for rebuttals. In the long run it benefits the persuasive potential of
both his and IED's arguments, since each is printed in toto, and has
the chance to sway the readership (if there actually is any at this
point, which is highly doubtful) in its own way and at its own pace.
     Second, meeting his side of the bargain, IED will try to be
briefer than normal, which means he won't go answering each point of
|&gt;oug's.
     Third, it would seem silly for IED to deny the power of |&gt;oug's
most recent argument. Obviously "Gaffa" is sometimes used as a term
for "gaffer's tape". When IED said that it was possible that it meant
something else, he should have made it clear that the use of the name
"Gaffa" left the door open for additional, supplementary
interpretations, but not _exclusive_ alternative interpretations. IED
still has seen nothing from you or anyone else that would preclude the
possibility that Kate deliberately used the term in a way that gives
it a kind of implied _place_ function. (As |&gt;oug likes to say as a
defense of _his_ interpretations of Kate's songs even after they've
been repudiated by Kate herself: "Yeah, but it still _makes_sense!_")
     Fourth, |&gt;oug has _still_ offered no conclusive evidence for his
interpretation of the line "Out in the garden there's half of a
heaven." IED is still waiting to see if |&gt;oug catches on to the other
quite different interpretation of the whole reference to the "garden"
in Kate's songs, but so far |&gt;oug seems caught up in the "8-track
studio" interpretation. However, IED is feeling appropriately humble
today, what with his recent humiliation at |&gt;oug's most recent
posting, so he won't come out and say 8-tracks couldn't possibly
figure into it...maybe they do. One thing's for sure about that line,
though, |&gt;oug--it has another meaning as well, and a quite specific
one. IED has recently come into a bit of knowledge (about another
related KT song) which has reminded him once again about the depth,
obscurity and inaccessibility of Kate's use of some symbolic objects
and places in her lyrics. Since it's not directly relevant to this
subject he won't go into it here, but it leaves him in no doubt that a
_lot_ more is probably going on in songs like "Suspended" than either
|&gt;oug or IED is aware of.
     Fifth, IED believes he may be able to track down Kate's comments
on the term "Gaffa" himself, so there's no need to make a bet on
it--he hasn't found it yet, but it looks as though |&gt;oug may be right
about that, too. Again, however, Kate's explanation of that term--as
with most of the other intriguing words in her recent lyrics--tends
only to unravel the outermost layer of mystery surrounding it, and by
no means exposes the roots to the air.
     Humbled but unvanquished,

-- Andrew Marvick

   P.S.: How do you like that? _After_ writing the above, in which IED
suggested that "Gaffa" -- as _capitalized_ by Kate -- might _also_ be
intended to serve some kind of _place_ function, I now read in the
latest Love-Hounds Digest a note from Craig Polson (thank you
_very_much_, Craig!) a possible specific support of _just_
_this_very_point_! So "Gaffa" is a Japanese term for a useless,
miserable place, eh?? How do you like that, |&gt;oug??? And don't say you
can't see how Kate would know of such a Japanese term. We both know
the extent of a certain Bush's involvement in that culture.
     (Newly gloating, IED signs off for now...)
