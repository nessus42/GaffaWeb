&gt; &gt;  Well, once again we've got a thread going that isn't really appropriate
&gt; &gt;to the group, and it's looking like it won't die for a while.  At
&gt; &gt;least it's not on the "personal attack" level (yet...).  

Wrong Ben ,looks like Ken is more than willing to stoop!

&gt;  1) Maybe you should read the group if you can talk this long on the subject.
&gt;  2) Multiple threads are permissable in other newsgroups, not just gaffa.
&gt;  3) Censorship and the PMRC have absolutely nothing specifically related to
&gt;       gaffa, besides the fact that we're talking about music, which is one of
&gt;       the major targets of censorship.  There's pornography and video ahead
&gt;       of it.
&gt;  4) There are those of us who, while paging through their mail box, skipping
&gt;       your lengthy letter, were longing for their Little League bat back at
&gt;       home, with evil and punishable-by-law thoughts running through their
&gt;       heads.
 
Ken, 
1) Maybe, then again, maybe not.
2)  Yeah, so?
3) So it ain't specific. so what?  Censorship and related
topics affect all sorts of media, and apparently there is some
interest by gaffa-ites as well as others.
4)  Why don't you get a real life and learn how to delete or
skip over what bores you or is beyond your comprehension?
There were also those of us who found the discussion quite
interesting.  ALMOST as interesting as how to pronounce Jane
Siberry's name!  

Nothing wrong with that, I'm just saying that until there's
more solid Kate happenings, various thing s are being
discussed, light and serious, and there's nothing wrong with
that.

&gt;      I can't say that this discussion isn't constructive, but what I can say
&gt; is that it neither belongs here at this level of verbosity, nor does the
&gt; subject matter fit in the albeit wide purposes that gaffa/love-hounds serves.

Ooooh, somebody died and left you DICKtator!

&gt;      Talking about varying musical artists is fine, as it has a great chance
&gt; of being devoured by at least part of the gaffa audience.  Unless I'm just
&gt; some bozo with an odd perspective on logic (not,) I figure the string should
&gt; be moved.  It'll get a lot more constructive input, and you can type away
&gt; without fear of a Louisville Slugger emblem implanted backwards in your
&gt; forehead.  ;-)
 
Trust me, I or Ben or ANYBODY can type any damn thing they
please without ANY fear of a Louisville Slugger emblem on
their heads or nary a scratch from your razor sharp (not) wit
;-)

&gt; &gt;  Y'll who aren't interested are, as always, free to hit the 'n' key.
&gt; &gt;Let's try to keep the word "censorship" in the titles of these
&gt; &gt;threads, folks, so people can block us out if they want to.
&gt; 
&gt;      It goes to love-hounds as well, and the digest isn't as kind to blocking
&gt; out.  Being a list subscriber, I'd like to ask you to take that into very
&gt; careful consideration.
 
Could you take your oppressive pompous ass attitude into
consideration as well?  Probably not...

&gt; &gt;learn something.  Or go back and re-read my posts, you'll learn less,
&gt; &gt;but you might learn something! ;-&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;      Oh, I've learned something.
 
I'll alert the media.

&gt; &gt;Well, I'm quite willing to continue to argue about this, so feel
&gt; &gt;free to refute me, folks.  Just remember the word "censorship" in
&gt; &gt;the header and maybe we won't get flamed by the others too badly.
&gt; 
&gt;      Just remember the words "love-hounds mailing list" and "long fly ball
&gt; over the left field fence" and we'll all be happy.     
 
Just remember You don't tell others what they can and can't do,
and we'll all (except maybe you, Ken) be happy.

For the record, I think it's been very interesting to see what
folks think about labelling and censorship, etc.  Ken, if it's
too complex for you, maybe you should try bugging off and
leaving the discussion to others, while happily using your
delete button. 

Ben, I say, go on with your bad self, honey!  Write on this as
long as the spirit moves you.  If the discussion stays alive,
it's apparently cause it's a subject people are interested in.
If not, it will die out.  Either way, it _will_ eventually die
out anyways.  So, Ken, darling, take my advice..pull down your
pants and sliiiiide on the ice! (Courtesy of a M*A*S*H
episode)

Cape Fear tonite!  Ooooh, DeNiro as a maniac - Yow!

Love,

Cynthia
