&gt; &gt; I have had the unique experience of being both physically and psychologically
&gt; &gt; sexually violated in my life (on different occasions, needless to say).  Afte
&gt; &gt; my body healed, I found it considerably easier to get over the physical one,
&gt; &gt; because I could point to a tangible wrong that someone had done me.  It took
&gt; &gt; me a lot longer to figure out I didn't have to sleep with someone because the
&gt; &gt; were pressuring me to and I was lonely.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, in that situation I let me hurt me.  But those kind of hurts are 
&gt; &gt; still harder to deal with in many ways.

&gt; &gt; Don't assume that because I have a penis that I can't possibly understand
&gt; &gt; the weight of the words I use.  It annoys me.

&gt; Whether or not you have a penis has nothing to do with the fact that 
&gt; the idea you're expressing is disgusting and sexist.  It's disgusting to 
&gt; me because regardless of your experience, there is no comparison between 
&gt; being forcibly raped and this mythical "psychological force".  
&gt; 
&gt; Since psychological pressure cannot force me to do anything, any pain
&gt; that I may feel as a result of the pressure is due to a weakness in my 
&gt; own character, and not because psychological pressure is so irresistible. 
&gt; If anything, pressure of this sort increases my will to resist.
&gt; We make our own choices.  Claiming that some of these choices are the
&gt; result of psychological force is a way of conveniently avoiding personal 
&gt; responsibility.
&gt; 
&gt; I felt your remarks were sexist because you said that a woman can
&gt; try to deflect a penis headed toward her vagina.   By talking
&gt; specifically about the rape of a woman by a man and then downplaying that 
&gt; as being less harmful than "psychological force", your comments sounded 
&gt; extremely sexist to me.  That sort of statement supports the notion that 
&gt; women would not be raped if they would only resist.  Resistance can be 
&gt; effective, but many times it is not an option.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't understand how your remarks might have given me this 
&gt; impression, then perhaps you don't understand the weight of your
&gt; words after all.
&gt; 
 Melissa that was excellently stated, and it didn't even dawn
on me that Larry's remarks were indeed sexist, (though I don't
think he realized why) but you've made a very enlightening
case.   I think you are right on the money!

Larry, I am terribly sorry for what happened to you, I'm sure
that was extremely traumatic and painful.  Nonetheless, on the
point of physical/psychological, I must  say that Melissa has
made a compelling and very well thought out argument.  I
think, that you're remarks, while not intentional, were indeed
sexist, as Melissa, in a very insightful and intelligent
manner, pointed out.  I am a bit taken aback, because
sometimes sexism is so sneaky, so hidden, that we don't even
realize it.  I did not agree with Larry's original assertion,
but when the sexist aspect was brought up, it was like a light
blinked on.  Usually, I'm one of the first ones to see sexism
in the language or attitude of others, even in myself, I hope.
I missed it this time, but it sure was there.  Thanks,
Melissa.
