It might prove educational to make a short-essay survey out of this
discussion and see where people go with it.  (Keep answers to less than
100 words or so.)

Do you think recordings should be labeled with warning stickers based
on the lyric content of individual songs?  Why?


If a record company chooses not to label its recordings, do you think
an independent agency (government, private, or perhaps a particular
store) should do so?  Why?


What sort of content would merit a sticker?


Do you think that such labels, if applied, should be printed on the CD booklet
or cassette insert as a permanent part of the package so that the warnings
can still be seen on used recordings or do you think that the label should be a
sticker that will not mar the album art.  


Do you think album art (eg the new U2 cover) should be stickered in addition
to song content?


If you think labelling should be done in certain circumstances, how 
should the labels be worded?  


Do you think that stores should be provided with lyric sheets that people 
could read to determine what the lyric content of a recording is?  In addition
to or instead of labelling?


Do you think certain kind of music should be labeled and others not?  Which
should be and which not and why or why not?


Do you think that a rap album like those made by 2 Live Crew or the Geto Boys
should be labelled?

Do you think that heavy metal albums by groups such as W.A.S.P. or Napalm Death
should be labelled?  (a song title:  "Animal:  Fuck Like a Beast")


Do you think that punk bands such as The Sex Pistols or th Dead Kennedys should
have their albums labelled?  (titles:  "Bodies", "Too Drunk To Fuck")


Do you think that industrial albums by bands such as Whitehouse or Throbbing
Gristle should be labelled?  (titles:  "Hamburger Lady", "Slug Bait")


Do you think that Country music albums should be labelled (song title: "The
Rodeo Song")


Do you think that classical opera albums should be labelled in all cases or
only where the libretto is in English, or not at all?


Do you think that alternative of dance music should be labelled?  (title:
"Let's Go To Bed")


Do you think that Kate Bush albums should be labelled (titles:  "The Infant
Kiss", "Waking the Witch")?



		
		Just wondering what people think, if and when they do,
