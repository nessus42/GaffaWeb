Naa, more like Ba-dum*prick*

&gt;      Did you notice that I posted once?  Protests?  I posted a request that
&gt; the discussion be moved.  It wasn't, and I didn't really care that much.  It
&gt; took Cynthia over a week to respond.  Over a week for what she posted, which
&gt; makes me hope she spends a lot of time on papers or debates.
 
No, I'm at the mercy of machine gaffes, somehow, the digests
got all bunched up and came to me all together, but late.
While I wait, I try to spend as much time as I can screwing.
But thanks for pondering.

 Ben had said to Ken:
&gt; &gt;*much* bigger breach than anything anyone else on this thread has done.
&gt; &gt;(BTW, I should say your original article never reached my site, I only
&gt; &gt;got Cyn's quoted version, so perhaps you did say something intelligent
 And Ken sed:
&gt;      Yes, maybe I did.
 
I saw the whole post.    Naaaaaaaaaaa.

&gt;      And willing to flame me for an edited version of my post.  Why don't you
&gt; find out exactly what I said before telling _me_ what I said.
 
Ben flamed you for what you _did_ say.  Your stupid
Louisville Sluggo comments.  I simply relayed the quotes.  He
saw an accurate account of what you said, and responded to
those particular comments.  

To: Ben - I don't have time to requote it all, but let me say
the 2 Kens theory was quite clever.  You've said a couple of
times now that I responded in a rather "abusive" manner to
Kenny #1 's comments.  Abusive?  Why, you smooth talker, you!
:-)

Ha - I thought that was Jon Drukman!
