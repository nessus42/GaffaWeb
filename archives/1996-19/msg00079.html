&gt;I know history. I am a direct Pilgrim descendant. My family has been in

&gt;By "censorship" I meant as in a wider scope, not specifically certain
&gt;posts, etc. The IDEA of censorship in any way or shape or form -
&gt;especially in this medium - is abhorrent. You mean to censor ideas that
&gt;don't suit YOUR world view. You do this by attacking (flaming) anyone who
&gt;shows an interest in spiritual devotion , whether Christian or "pagan."

&gt;Get a grip. Get some oxygen. Get a life.

Hi NinthWaver,

For once I'm in agreement with you. Thanks for saying what you said. Chris is a
knowledgable fan and I'm usually perfectly happy to have him and Vickie around
(as I'm usually perfectly happy to have you around, sorry if it seems otherwise
sometimes.), But this time I thought his message was much harsher than called
for and really could see how the original poster would be offended. The way he
comes down so hard on anyone who discusses Kate's religious beliefs is not
exactly censorship, but it does create a "chilling effect" to use the legal
term. People are hesitant to discuss a topic if they feel like it is going to
involve them in a big flamewar.

Vickie, I know Chris is a nice guy, but everyone, including me (especially me?)
is capable of acting like a jerk on occasion. Nobody is wrong all the time and
nobody is right all the time.

&gt;No fantasies. Just a suggestion, a possibility, an interest in something
&gt;other than the merely secular. Might she -? Is she -? Could she -? Make
&gt;life more interesting. And nothing any human being FEELS - especially
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;deeply - is "petty" or "inane."
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Agreed. To think that Chris and Vickie hold my religious beliefs in such
contempt hurts me, not because I seek a lot of approval from others -- I don't
-- but because I've corresponded with Vickie on a number of occasions and think
of her as a friend and I am sorry she has such dislike and, IMHO,
misundertanding of something that is so important to me. I still like you
Vickie, please don't take that as an attack.

I can go on and on about how Christianity is not a matter of blind faith but a
matter to which I have given very deep thought. I was not born or raised a
Christian, but became one as an adult after long deliberation. I don't want to
proselytize any more than that.

There are lots of religious references in Kate's music, and I would like to feel
free to discuss them on gaffa without being ridiculed. The question "Is Kate a
Witch?" doesn't offend me any more than "What is gaffa?" Yeah, to the old-timer
it may get a little tiresome, but it behooves us to treat it with good humor.

Stu

P.S. Go on. I can take it. I can flame with the best of them. Check the
archives. :-)

P.P.S. I think what Wieland meant about the reversal of roles in Lily being
explained by /+) is that in the movie, Kate is "through the looking glass." Left
is right and right is left, so the ritual is performed backwards! don't know if
it was actually meant that way, I'm as inclined to believe she made a mistake.
But it is a convenient and fitting explanation.

Mmm, do you think he had a beautiful smile?          |               |\
