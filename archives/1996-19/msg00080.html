In an earlier post, Vickie typed:

    I'm going to be traveling to Philly to see Happy Rhodes in concert, and I
    don't want a flame war to cast a pall on meeting fellow Love-Hounders who
    are Ectophiles, as has happened before. It's just not worth it. 

Well, Vickie, to you and all of you who recommended Happy Rhodes, I have a 
first impression for you:

    Wow...

now, my second impression:

    Wow!

This is incredible...  I've yet to listen deeply to the lyrics (I listen at 
work usually) but the rhythms, melodies, structures... hell, everything blends 
and creates a synergy unlike almost any other I've heard.

I picked up RhodeSongs (I think on your recommend, Vickie) and from the moment 
I hit play I've been engrossed all day.  These songs hit my like the best of 
Kate - thoughtful, intricate and so well balanced that if any one component 
were missing it wouldn't have near the same effect.

Thanks again...

the simply-amazed one

p.s.  The following is meant for Vickie - the rest of you can read but it is 
meant for her.

Vickie,  I know it is extremely hard to watch people 'beat' on someone you care 
about.  While the initial posts were a bit, um, forceful, they in no way 
deserved the treatment by those sporting for a bloodfest.

I have a bit of advice.  Since you don't know me at all this advice is worth
zilch or less to you, but I must like to see my own typing so I'll do it
anyway.

As hard as it may be, ignore personal attacks.  Delete'm, scroll past'em, do 
whatever you can to NOT acknowledge them.  From my personal experience, when 
you acknowledge a flame as a flame (especially publicly), you encourage these 
potentially nice people to react like cretins and froth at the first orifice 
which comes to mind.  But, of course, you know this, having been around the 
electronic community for at least a week or two....

Oh well...

I wish you and Chris all the best and please remember that we are only human
after all, much to my dismay.

And for anyone else who is still reading, flame me privately - I won't respond 
to flames posted to the list.
