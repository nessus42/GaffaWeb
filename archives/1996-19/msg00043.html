It does no good to flame questions on
Kate and ThingsOutThere:

1.   Kate did this to herself.  That rumor was
one I heard too.  It is one of the oldest and most pervasive
rumors about Kate Bush.   She has the indirect and direct
references in her music.  She answers
all questions on the subject vaguely.
In short:  part of the image, part of the
publicity mill, part of the career.  
If it is part of her life, we
don't know because we don't know the
woman.  Peter Fitzgerald-Morris is as
close to her as anyone on this list,
and he has said her beliefs were
her own mixture.  That she is conversant
on the subject of comparative religions is true.
So are a lot of us, particularly the artists.
To study religion is to study human
reflection on being and its relationship
to the universe.  "alas, poor yorick" etc.

2.  Animistic religions are no stranger
than ones based on a Triple-Omni
assertions (omniscient, omnipotent,
omnipresent) of invisible being.

3.  Religion by direct affirmation 
(Moses talks to God in person)
or indirect affirmation (Priest
says Moses says he talked
to God in person) are both
non-provable.  They
cannot be subject to proof
unless first proposition is accepted
and verified which cannot be.
Faith accepts that without proof.

4.  Where religion is a source of
tolerance and well-being, it is
a practice of live.  Where religion
is a source of  violence and dissolution,
it is a practice of death.  Where religion
is unpracticed, it is a fairytale or
anthropological study.  The practicioner
chooses.

I like the alienBit better.  It's funnier
and she can deny it until someone
catches her levitating the cats.
See my Web page later this week
for "proof". ;-)
