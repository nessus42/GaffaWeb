&gt;&gt;  A couple of Kate's other favorite frightening films:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The Haunting (the door bulging in was a major image for _Get Out Of My
&gt;&gt;       House_).
&gt;
&gt;And don't forget The Shining as inspiration for this song, too.  Although
&gt;it's not a terribly great film, some of the images were truly amazing, like
&gt;the blood flooding the corridors.

   Surprisingly, she credited the book rather than the movie. At the time
of the interview she said that she doesn't tend to read a lot of fiction. She
said that this was one of the few books she has read that scared her.

&gt;Watch "The Company of Wolves" for a psycho-sexual fairytale gone very
&gt;wrong.  I especially tell all women they must see it, if only to be able to
&gt;see the "wolves" when they are upon you. ;&gt;  The sets for this are pretty
&gt;eerie, too, and this haunts me as much as Fearless Vampire Killers.  These
&gt;are two movies I find myself going back to again and again.

   Great film. For a Kate connection...the main advice given to the heroine
by her granny is "never trust a man who's eyebrows meet in the middle."

   In _The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve_ Miranda Richardson's eyebrows
do exactly that.

   Is this an old Irish or English superstition, of did Kate get it from the 
film?

&gt;And let's not forget the fabulous "Wicker Man," which has none other than
&gt;Mr. Moving himself, Lindsay Kemp, in the smallish role of the tavernkeeper.

   It was a very odd experience showing this video to the Pagan housemates 
of one of my oldest and dearest friends. This was long before VCRs were
popular, and _The Wicker Man_ was among the first 100 or so pre-recorded
VHS movies.
