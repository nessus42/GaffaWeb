In a post to "LoveHounds", Chris Williams said:

&gt;&gt;&gt;P.P.S. To any other "witches" out there, bite me, ok? I have no more
&gt;&gt;&gt;interest in your beliefs than I do christianity. At least those who
&gt;&gt;&gt;grow up in a religion have some excuse for possessing a set of
&gt;&gt;&gt;beliefs. Adopting a religion as fashion is nauseating.

My kind sir, I'll have you know that Neo-paganism is in no way a fad or
fashion, at least in regards to it's practice in the USA and the UK.
According to polls in the USA, there are between 40,000 and 100,000 people
who's religious beliefs could be catagorized as neo-pagan (this figure does
not include established Eastern religions, or Native American religions...)

As a practicing Pagan (for 15 years), a member of MENSA (148 IQ) and a
thinking member of the Human Race, I am shocked and offended by your
callous, rude, and intollerant behavior.

Although I agree that any discussion about KaTe's religion is bound to be
fraught with speculation and spurious information, the topic is as valid as
discussing the religious beliefs of ANY historical entity that has effected
our culture, even when we don't know the facts.

The ancient Celts, Sumerians, Egyptians, and Etruscans all effected
European culture, and very little concrete documentation on their religions
exists. However, we (as scholars, speculators, and thinkers) CAN and DO
speculate as to the religious and sacred practices of these folk. We CAN
derive SOME theories from the songs, poetry and literature of these people.

I believe these same techniques can be applied to this discussion of KaTe...

As for needing an excuse to practice a religion, I make no excuses for my
beliefs. I love Nature, and Life, and I plan on dancing and singing like a
banshee this weekend with my Pagan friends in the hills of West Virginia,
at a celebration of Beltane...

Also, I would be careful about telling Pagans to "bite you". Pagans are
know to suck, nibble, and bite as well, and often do so with great passion
and fervor...
