&gt;Subject: Re: SHE's A GENIUS -- *** AGAIN *** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;From: jsd@gaffa.UUCP (Jon Drukman)
&gt;In article &lt;1990Mar8@eddie.mit.edu&gt; henrik@EDDIE.MIT.EDU (Larry DeLuca) writes:
&gt;&gt;I didn't want to skip to the end, so I listened to the whole thing -
&gt;&gt;and then, after that "Yeah!".  "&lt;pause&gt;...&lt;LAUGH!!!!!&gt;"
&gt;&gt;And it's not on the 7"!!!! (Which ends with the "Yeah!").
&gt;&gt;Now, they credit the 7" as having the mix that appears on _The Sensual World_,
&gt;&gt;and the 12" as "...original version available on ... _The Sensual World_",
&gt;&gt;so, in some sense, that would seem to indicate that the original intent
&gt;&gt;was that the laugh belongs either A) with "The Fog", or B) just as a
&gt;&gt;bit of banding between songs, but ...
&gt;See, I am VINDICATED!  I just KNEW it, deep down inside.  And now you
&gt;people have NO EXCUSE not to believe me, ever again.  Because I was
&gt;right.  All along.  Despite silly photos in silly KBC newsletters.
&gt;Hey guys, it says on an OFFICIAL EMI KATE RELEASE that putting the
&gt;laugh on the end makes it NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION!  Suck on THIS,
&gt;planet of noise bimbo!

Absolute codswallop. How can being totally wrong be seen as a vindication?
You clearly have a long and successful career aheadof you as a politician.
Perhaps you don't remember what you wrote back in December.

&gt;Subject: Re: The Laugh
&gt;&gt;[nbc]In fact, it's obvious to anyone who isn't Dan Quayle that it belongs
&gt;&gt;[nbc]at the end of "Love and Anger".
&gt;I am not Dan Quayle (at least I wasn't last time I checked - let me
&gt;have a quick peek... nope, definitely do not have tapioca between my
&gt;ears so I can't be him...) and I don't agree with you.  The laugh is
&gt;the perfect introduction to "The Fog." A giggle at a half-remembered
&gt;childhood foible, like being scared of the water.  A piquant chuckle
&gt;of bemusement over the naivete of youth.  Of course, we're not like
&gt;that anymore, but cast your mind back... (cue Fairlight whistles).
&gt;See what I mean?  Perfection.

Now the presence of the laugh on the Love and Anger 12" clearly
proves it has absolutely nothing to do with The Fog. Whatever the
labels say about mixing (I do not have then yet to check the wording
or whether anything else in the mix is different) the laugh has been
placed with Love and Anger. Therefore you (and many others) were wrong.
So why not admit it - you know you will feel better afterwards :-)

Be seeing you,
	Neil
