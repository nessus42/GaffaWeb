 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: MisK.

   First, the UK _Love_and_Anger_ seven-inch is out, both in a regular
glossy-card sleeve and as a special limited-edition gatefold with
colour-photo pages inside. The front cover of both is the same: a
solid black field with a small "letter-box"-style still from the
video in the middle and white serif capitals saying "KATE BUSH
LOVE AND ANGER" on top. The b-side of both is the same: just "Ken",
the theme song from the Comic Strip episode called "GLC" (Greater
London Council--thanks, Neil). The gatefold edition has a close-up
of one of the whirling Dervishes seen from behind on both the front
and back inside covers. Over this photo are the lyrics of _Love_and_
_Anger_, half on one side and half on the other. Stapled into the
gatefold are three or so additional pages featuring photos from the
video shoot. All the photographs are by John Carder Bush. All in all
this is a lovely little extra for a Kate Bush single, and IED was
pleasantly surprised by the quality. There is no secret message in
the runout grooves of the single, and the label is generic EMI stock.
     IED should be getting the twelve-inch and CD-single versions of
this single, featuring two extra tracks from the Comic Strip episode,
sometime today or tomorrow, and he will update the group as soon as
he has seen/heard them. Until then he will not comment on the new
music, except to say that Kate clearly recorded it quickly and solely
for the purposes of the telefilm. He'll also say one other thing:
_Ken_ features a (Fairlight) horn section. Echoes of _Sat_In_Your_Lap_?
     In other Kate Bush-related news, IED has received three new
Kate Bush fanzines in the last two days.  1.) The latest _Dreamtime_
(the Australian fanzine), which is very nicely put together as usual
but which unfortunately contains virtually no news since it is
necessarily a bit out of date.  2.) The fifth (Vol.2, No. 2) issue of
Tracy Robyn Somerville's excellent (and still improving) Canadian
fanzine _Still_Breathing_, which is dominated by the first part of
an ambitious song-by-song runthrough of Kate's work to date, plus photocopies
of record covers, snapshots, posters, fans' self-portraits, and a first-rate
cover by Paulina Stuckey. 3.) A brand new fanzine (yes, that's right, _another_
new Kate Bush fanzine--this makes number 19--at least) called _Reaching_
_Out_, which is published (on a home PC and dot-matrix printer) by Cynthia
Kiley of Newtonville, Massachusetts. IED doesn't know how he came
to get on Cynthia's mailing list, but he is grateful for the chance
to see the fledgling effort. The cover is a color computer-reproduction
of a detail from the _Babooshka_ "warrior"-outfit photograph, and is
visually arresting. The issue is also _very_ valuable and _much_
appreciated by IED for its transcription of a _recent_phone_interview_
with Kate. IED's guess is that this is a transcription of part of a
conference-call interview which was set up by Columbia Records, Kate's
record company in the U.S, during her visit to New York. In it, a
large number of radio dj's joined in and asked Kate questions. IED
may learn more about this interview soon, but in the meantime, he
will try to transcribe it for Love-Hounds' edification and entertainment
soon. Brava Cynthia, wherever she is--are you a Love-Hound, Cynthia?
