In article &lt;9003050924.AA23932@world.std.com&gt; katefans@world.std.COM (Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City) writes:
&gt;Susan writes this about new vocal "Wuthering Heights":
&gt;&gt; Furthermore, the strident voice of the original recording seems much
&gt;&gt; more appropriate to the little virago that I've perceived Kate's
&gt;&gt; Cathy to be.

I think that whether or not people like the "new" vocal or the
"classic coke" vocal take depends on whether or not they've read the
book/seen the film or something.  Unfortunately, I've done neither,
thus for me the song is merely a piece of music, and I infinitely
prefer the new one because it is a vastly superior production job.
Those drums go BOOM!

People who know the story know that Cathy is a ghost at this point,
and thus they like that annoying banshee-screech little girl voice
that Kate used on the first version.

And, I find myself in the very strange position of agreeing with IED,
for once!

&gt;IED responds:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Kate does _not_ sing a "wrong" note here! She has simply
&gt;&gt; embellished--very deliberately--the F-natural of the earlier
&gt;&gt; "Cath-" syllable so that it begins with a grace note of G-flat.
&gt;&gt; There is _no_ question that she did this deliberately. Not only
&gt;&gt; does it _sound_ good (_not_ "wrong"); but she has actually sung the

I don't know how well trained the people are who are listening to this
new version and hearing gaffes.  I'm not the world's greatest
musician, but I have a pretty good ear and it sounds fine to me.
Better than fine.  Perfect!  IT is in no way, shape or form a wrong
note.

&gt;Sorry IED. Susan, I agree with you wholeheartedly!! It sounded "wrong"
&gt;to me the first time I heard it and I winced. It still sounds wrong to
&gt;me and I still wince. Even if it's *supposed* to be right, who can tell?
&gt;IED can. Good for him. Even if it's *supposed* to be right, I still find
&gt;that note embarrassing and it completely ruins the song for me, even
&gt;though, up till then, I really like what she does with that version.

Well, Vickie, you're crazy!  Why wouldn't someone be able to tell
whether or not a sung note is "right"?  Are you saying there is no
objective standard for whether or not a note is appropriate?
Certainly in the pop form that Kate has chosen to work in, there is a
bit of right and wrong!  Maybe if Kate were just free-jazz scatting
all over the place then we'd allow her a bit more leeway, but she's
doing a pop tune.  There are right notes and wrong notes.  Nothing
wrong with the one she's hit in Wuthering Heights...
