Neil Calton, is of course, a tremendously nice guy, and a very
valuable love hound, however, his brain seems to have cracked from the
strain.  Let's take this nice and slowly, so everybody understands
exactly what's going on here.

First, we had Larry's report:
&gt;&gt;In article &lt;1990Mar8@eddie.mit.edu&gt; henrik@EDDIE.MIT.EDU (Larry DeLuca) writes:
&gt;&gt;&gt;I didn't want to skip to the end, so I listened to the whole thing -
&gt;&gt;&gt;and then, after that "Yeah!".  "&lt;pause&gt;...&lt;LAUGH!!!!!&gt;"
&gt;&gt;&gt;And it's not on the 7"!!!! (Which ends with the "Yeah!").
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, they credit the 7" as having the mix that appears on _The Sensual World_,

Hello, just thought I'd interrupt here.  THE 7" DOES NOT HAVE THE
LAUGH.  IT IS THE VERSION THAT IS ON TSW.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and the 12" as "...original version available on ... _The Sensual World_",

I don't know if they don't have ellipses (those three periods in a
row) over in England, or if they mean something different, but the way
Larry has arranged them indicates to me that the legend on the 12"
single informs the reader that the version that they are holding in
their hands, WITH THE LAUGH, is NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION.  In other
words, it has SOMETHING ADDED - SOMETHING ALIEN, SOMETHING THAT DOES
NOT BELONG.  Could that something possibly be THE LAUGH?  You bet!

&gt;&gt;&gt;so, in some sense, that would seem to indicate that the original intent
&gt;&gt;&gt;was that the laugh belongs either A) with "The Fog", or B) just as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;bit of banding between songs, but ...

Please read Larry's comments here.  He is agreeing with me.

&gt;Absolute codswallop. How can being totally wrong be seen as a vindication?
&gt;You clearly have a long and successful career aheadof you as a politician.
&gt;Perhaps you don't remember what you wrote back in December.

I have a flawless memory.  And I have never changed my stance on this
issue.  Here's the relevant text that I wrote all those years ago...

&gt;&gt; The laugh is
&gt;&gt;the perfect introduction to "The Fog."

&gt;Now the presence of the laugh on the Love and Anger 12" clearly
&gt;proves it has absolutely nothing to do with The Fog.

There are none so deaf as those who clutch at straws.  Clearly, this
is not the original version of the song anymore, is it?  Call it a
remix, call it a "special single version," call it what you will, this
is NOT the song that appeared on TSW.  Why, in my very own remix that
I have been touting on Love-Hounds these past weeks, I threw in the
laugh!  But I did it full well knowing that I was injecting alien
material into the song.  You might as well claim that since I threw in
Neneh Cherry then that is part of the song as well.  In fact, you DO
make that ridiculous claim.  Here it is:

&gt;Whatever the
&gt;labels say about mixing [...] the laugh has been
&gt;placed with Love and Anger. Therefore you (and many others) were wrong.
&gt;So why not admit it - you know you will feel better afterwards :-)

Never.  I am right.  That is the whole of the matter.  I think I need
to have another victory lap, in fact.  Here we go:

&gt;&gt;See, I am VINDICATED!  I just KNEW it, deep down inside.  And now you
&gt;&gt;people have NO EXCUSE not to believe me, ever again.  Because I was
&gt;&gt;right.  All along.  Despite silly photos in silly KBC newsletters.
&gt;&gt;Hey guys, it says on an OFFICIAL EMI KATE RELEASE that putting the
&gt;&gt;laugh on the end makes it NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION!  Suck on THIS,
&gt;&gt;planet of noise bimbo!
