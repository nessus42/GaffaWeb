Jon Drukman emulsifies:
&gt; [look mom, no flames.]

bless ya, my bro...

&gt; &gt;Maybe *emotions* in the brain and body (and breathing) *do*
&gt; &gt;have distinct, someday-scientifically-mappable *rhythms*, so that people
&gt; &gt;can move *into* phase (if their emotions have the same cycle-length) or
&gt; &gt;out of phase (when they don't).
&gt; 
&gt; i'd buy this.  anyone who has spent a magical day with a lover where
&gt; you're both "in tune" knows this phenomenon.  and similarly, when you
&gt; get into a heated fight with that same person two days later and you
&gt; say, "i just don't UNDERSTAND you anymore!" you are observing the
&gt; phenomenon in reverse.

(Jonathan... I'm starting to *like* you!  ;^)

&gt; &gt;So when we listen to emotional music, ***maybe*** our emotional rhythms
&gt; &gt;naturally move *into* phase with it, the better to savor it at full
&gt; &gt;intensity,
&gt; 
&gt; this is also acceptable - to a point.  "emotional music" needs some
&gt; defining, for instance. 
&gt; ...The Future Sound of London - the song "Papua New Guinea" is
&gt; extremely moving, for me.  [...]   it
&gt; evokes a mood of wistful longing in my brain that is incredibly
&gt; clear-cut.  and it is definitely more than the sum of its parts...
&gt; [...] FSoL just *hits that certain spot* in my head.

*There's* the real artist... *feel what you feel*!

&gt; as it stands now, your statement makes it look like there are ways to
&gt; measure musical compositions' "emotional impact content."

Track down Manfred Clynes's "Sentics".  He tried to find archetypal *graphs* 
for different moods.  (I can't judge his success, however.)

&gt; &gt;and our *brainwaves*, or the slow rhythms of our breathing, or
&gt; &gt;our heartbeats, or a billion other sorts of rhythmic biological signal,
&gt; &gt;really maybe might *gently color*, in a perfectly *asimovian* way ( ;^),
&gt; &gt;the physical fieldstrengths thruout the room, including necessarily the
&gt; &gt;*read* mechanism of the stereo as it plays, to any least infinitesimal
&gt; &gt;degree *sufficient to leave a mark*...
&gt; 
&gt; well, i was with you up to this point.  i'm sorry, but i just can't
&gt; believe this.  the reasons are numerous and have been brought up in
&gt; this forum many times in the past.

Feh!  *Nobody's* asked me to clarify my 2-way vs non-2-way distinction...
If you consider *every* possible kind of media for sound (or any message),
you can certainly arrange them from the most to the least "2-way".  So
*looking into someone's eyes* is the most 2-way, or loving touches, and
spying on someone who can't see you but feels your gaze as a prickle is
many steps down, and the angels on the subway in "Wings of Desire" were
almost CD-like (tho pained souls felt soothed by their loving attention).

A phonograph needle *does* scratch an infinitesimal record of your room-
sounds as it plays.  (Atoms are *tiny*.  Don't prejudge what may some-
day be recoverable!)  Ditto the tape's readhead.

&gt; &gt;(But CDs, see, being digital, can't take *any* mark, unless it's
&gt; &gt;imprinted thru a zero toggling into a one, or back, which, *by design*
&gt; &gt;almost literally *never* happens... )
&gt; 
&gt; you seem to be lacking some fundamental knowledge of how a CD player
&gt; works.  if you read up about ADCs and digital filters and error
&gt; correction, i think you'll find that a CD almost *never* plays back
&gt; the same bit-pattern twice.

But the nature of digital is powers-of-two, and that random toggle may
add 1 to the amplitude, or 32000.  It's *not analog*!!!
