Oooo!  It got awfully quiet around here all of a sudden!  *grin*  I guess
everybody went to their rooms :-)

Anyway, this is for the Happy Rhodes fans on this list:  God, I hate it when
you're right!  I got Warpaint on the weekend and liked the first two songs
so much (I was really busy taking a course so I only actually got to listed
(sorry, listen) to the first two songs) that I went and bought Rhodes I for
a comparison.  I'm really impressed.  I'm still working through Warpaint
though.  Needs a few listenings.  

Okay, so her voice resembles Kate's occasionally, but I don't see where you
would have difficulty telling them apart and while I really do like her
writing, I don't think she's a patch on Kate where poetry is concerned.  The
melodies of Waking up and especially the chorus of Feed the Fire, which I
can't stop singing, have really caught me though.

Can someone settle an arguement for me?  My SO thinks Happy is a Native American
and I don't recall this being the case.  Can anyone clear that up?  Also is
the Warpaint album meant to be a concept album regarding Native issues?

And on still another wholly un-Kate related point...  I have been searching
for months now for the cd _Lament_ by Ultravox to no avail and have now heard
that it may actually be out of print!  *Sniff*  Does anyone know of where I
can get a copy of this?  Second-hand is fine as long as it's in good condition
of course.  Thanks!
