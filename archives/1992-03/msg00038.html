        The song after that is "Hello Earth," and this is the point where 
she's so weak that she relives the experience of the storm that took her in 
the water, almost from a view: looking down on the earth up in the heavens, 
watching the storm start to form - the storm that eventually took her and 
that has put her in this situation.
        This track features orchestral arrangements by Michael Kamen.  It 
was wonderful working with Michael.  He's a very receptive person to work 
with, and the orchestral arrangements that he did for the tracks I felt were 
very atmospheric.  It was wonderful for me to watch the layers of this song 
go on one by one.  It initially had to be written with the verses 
symbolizing the storm's gradual buildup, and the choruses having a great 
sense of space and atmosphere - and this I always hoped to be a male choir.  
When I first wrote "Hello Earth" I was very much inspired by a male choir 
that I'd heard in Herzog's film Nosferatu.  And the verses are a very 
different piece of music.  It was all designed so as hopefully to link, 
eventually, with this male voice choir which would take us to a very 
different place in the song.  They really are meant to symbolize the great 
sense of loss, of weakness, at reaching a point where you can accept, at 
last, that everything can change.   (1985, KBC 18)
 
        And, uh...I watched this film called Nosferatu, directed by, um... 
Herzog.  And it's beautiful!  And there was this one piece of music that 
just haunted me, to the point where I just - I had to use it in the song.  
It was exactly what I wanted to say at this point in the music.  And it 
was...sort of building the song around that piece.  It was a traditional 
piece that, um...I think, uh... was either Russian or Czechoslovakian... 
Um... is a Russian piece [laughs] and... uh... It's just so haunting.  I 
mean it's a very holy piece of music, in a very pure sense...   (1985, 
Homeground)
