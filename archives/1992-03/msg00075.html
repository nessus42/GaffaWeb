Geez, can you say "hypersensitive"?  Katefans tend to be amongst the most
fanatical out there.  I should know - I am one.  Yes, I own all of Kate's
albums (Hell, I even own Lionheart.  Hell, sometimes I even LISTEN to it!)
My point it that to be obsessed with any one thing - be it Kate, religion,
politics, etc. IS NOT A GOOD THING.  (If you think the folks in Lovehounds
are bad, you should read alt.tv.simpsons - they have folks there who
transcribe EVERY EPISODE, and who study each episode and make ASCII maps
of the Simpson's floorplans - but I digress).  Anyway, what irked me was
when I saw looking at an issue of Homeground at the local Tower Records,
and saw the drawings of Kate - I had seen them before, but suddenly it
struck me - where have I seen this type of thing before?  Then I realized -
I saw this depressing kond of stuff at every Science Fiction convention I
have gone to, at every art show.  Here were artists who had considerable
talent who were frittering this talent away on one of the Big Three
categories (If you are lucky enough to have never seen an art show at an
SF convention, 95% of the artwork are either Woman with Large Breasts holding
a sword, Woman with Large Breasts with a unicorn, or Woman with Large
Breasts with a dragon).  Nothing wrong with making a drawing or two of your
favorite musician (A certain Lovehound who shall remain anonymous has a
housemate who is not untalented wasting HIS talent with "sensitive"
drawings of Kelly Bundy - which proves there are worse things than Kate
to draw).  One final note - in some book that people are too damn fanatical
about who's title eludes me at this time some guy says "Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone" - if I weren't a KateFan (tm) - a badge
I wear with honor, thank you - I wouldn't be reading rec.music.gaffa first
thing in the morning.  All the typos in it (or in this one, for that matter
are the product of a brain who is not awake for which I can take no
responsibility.  Therefore, I can sincerely say to anyone who was offended
by my previous posting - plllltttt!

food, anyway?" - A lifeless dweeb
