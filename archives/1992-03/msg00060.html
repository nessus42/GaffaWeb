Really from: Tippi Chai

I got the Box Set Biographical Notes from David Koehler. (Thanks David!)
When I first looked at it, I thought it was identical to the "Chronology" 
from _Kate Bush Complete_.  However, a quick comparison reveals that 
while many entries are almost exactly the same, each work contains info 
that the other one doesn't.  So I guess I *DO* have to translate 
the whole thing.

Before I saw it, I was hoping it won't be written in long complicated 
proses.  Was I relieved to see that it's in point form!  However, the 
transliteration of English proper names into Japanese is really giving me 
a hard time.  Luckily a lot of the info is already in _KB Complete_.  
Otherwise, I'd never have known that "BAKKUSUREEHEESU" is Bexleyheath!

I'm going on vacation for 3 weeks staring Jan 27 (back to Hong Kong for
Chinese New Year; Kung Hay Fat Choy!*)  I'll do the bulk of the translation
then.  Meanwhile, here are the first few entries to whet your appetite.

The [?] marks mean I'm unsure about those re-transliterations.

===============================

===============================

I'll leave y'all hanging there.  Expect the rest of it in a month or so.
