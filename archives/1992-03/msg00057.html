[Description of limited-edition RM single deleted]

|&gt; The portrait is in charcoal by "Hannah". It looks like a youngish,
|&gt; fairly thin faced KaTe - I don't think it's copied from any photo that
|&gt; I've seen. It's not the most amazing likeness of KaTe I've ever seen
|&gt; (it needs the lines around her mouth and more shading round her
|&gt; cheeks to be instatnly recognisable) but it's quite pretty.
|&gt; 
Y'know, this reminds me of why I *don't* read "Homeground".  Those fine
charcoal and pen-and-ink drawingings done by oh-so-sensitive &gt;arteests&lt; do
not make me think "Oh, this is a very sensitive likeness of Kate."  Instead,
it makes me think "Oh, here is someone with clearly too much time on their
hands."  Kinda the same reaction when I see someone type in a 500-line 
interview.  That over-worked cliche G.A.L. is still most appropriate.  Y'know,
I think there are three stages of KaTe Fandom:

1)  The Kate Fan - owns HoL, THS, maybe TD.  Would not recognize them by those
initials.
2)  The KaTeFan(tm) - owns all KaTe's albums, except for maybe "Lionheart".
Possibly has a poster, maybe a few GIFs, the more hard-core in this KaTegory
might own "The Secret History Of..." or "An Illustrated Biography".  Maybe has
copied a video or two off a KaTeFanaTiK.
3)  The KaTeFanaTiK - owns all the albums, including import pressings.  Owns
most, if not all, back issues of "Homeground".  Owns all singles.  Has at
least three posters.  Owns every Katebook he (gender implication intentional)
knows of, including "The Whole Story".  Has bought every Kate Video (as 
opposed to copying them off someone else).  Types in 10-year-old KaTe interviews
in R.M.G.  Is proud of the "sensitive" drawing he did of KaTe.  If he could,
would get into fisticuffs over the meaning of "Gaffa".  Never heard of half the
bands in Billboard's Top 10.  Basically is to Kate what a Trekkie is to Star
Trek.

P.S. - I'm not accusing Scott (the person who wrote the posting the artical
that inspired me) of being a lifeless dweeb - I'm accusing "Hannah".
