Vickie here. 

First, about the new Wuthering Heights. OK, I will say that Kate
did what she did with that note on purpose. I still don't have
to like it. (Really, it's the *only* thing about the song that
bugs me!) I promise I'll listen to it again...someday.

Second,

In article &lt;9003031638.AA26947@imagine.ADMS-RAD.Unisys.COM&gt;, bill@ADMS-RAD.Unisys.COM (Bill Oswald) writes:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any advice on finding out ahead of time what MTV and VH-1 are going
&gt;&gt;    to play and when?

John replies:
&gt;      Don't know about that, but I always find they play some of the
&gt; best stuff after midnight (pacific time, anyway).  I think that's
&gt; when I've seen the two Kate videos, although sometimes they sneak
&gt; into the daytime lineup.  In general some of the less mainstream
&gt; (i.e. _not_ Bon Jovi) stuff is played in the 'off hours'.

MTV showed "Suspended In Gaffa" at something like 4:00am on a Tuesday
morning. And I know someone who actually saw Jane Siberry's "Mimi On
The Beach" (the *entire* thing) on MTV at 3:00am-ish. Anytime, day or
night, it's STILL excruciating to sit through dozens &amp; dozens of crappy
videos to find the gems. In a way, I'm almost glad Kate's off the MTV
120 Minutes college chart so now I won't feel obligated to sit through
1 hour and 55 minutes of boyz with guitarz to see Kate. Now I'll just
tape the show and fast-forward it to see what token woman or two they've
managed to stick in. Re women: I don't want domination, I just want

                       EQUALITY!
  

Third:

Ed did this (BIG woofs to him):

&gt; Below are the results of my poll.  I got 94 responses (thanks,
&gt; everybody!), and 29 different songs were listed.  Quite a few
&gt; people told me that this was a difficult choice, something I 
&gt; can definitely agree with!  A few people weren't completely
&gt; clear about their choices; they listed several songs and the reasons
&gt; why each should be considered.  In those cases I tried to pick the
&gt; one most suited for my purpose:  The song that first grabbed your
&gt; attention and made you realize that this was an artist worth learning
&gt; more about.

It's all well and good to have this list. Lists are nice, sure. But! I
want to read the stories behind some of these choices. Why not? I figure
Love-Hounds is for:
a) passing along and learning about Kate-related information
b) communing with other people who feel the magic
 So lets commune OK?

I especially want to hear from:

Sat In Your Lap -- 5
Waking The Witch -- 3
Night Of The Swallow -- 2
Under Ice -- 2
Jig Of Life -- 2
Hello Earth -- 2
Suspended In Gaffa -- 1
Get Out Of My House -- 1
Watching You Without Me -- 1
Love And Anger -- 1

Though all the rest of you ARE important to me too! I know this will take 
up a lot of space in gaffa and some people won't be interested and Julian
will throw away his Digests and all that but I for one am intrigued at
the thought that 5 people heard Sat... and decided to delve deeper into
the world of Kate. You 3 Waking The Witchers-hey, tell me about it. And
you Get Out Of My House person you. I want to meet you in person! You poor
Sensual World &amp; Love &amp; Anger folks have a LOT to catch up on! So what are
you doing for the next 4 years? Don't be intimidated-go for it-Kate's WORTH
any time and effort you may expend.

Coup'la short stories-one of my listeners was somewhere (don't remember
where) and a friend of a friend of his was listening to a Walkman. He
noticed that she was very intensely listening and got closer. She noticed
him and took off the headphones and he heard the middle Witch-trial portion
of Waking The Witch. He asked her what she was listening to and she said
"Kate Bush-Hounds Of Love." Without hearing any more than that bit coming
through those tinny headphone speakers he went out and bought HOL, then
all the rest! 
2) The day after my very first show aired, a listener went out and bought
every one of Kate's albums! He'd never heard of her before! 

It's people like those two who've given money to the station and made my
show the 3rd highest-rated show on a 100,000 watt radio station! (#1 English-
language show, since #s 1 &amp; 2 are Hispanic-oriented)
Bless their hearts!

ps: I'll be spending all day Sunday answering mail,  responding to other
posts and various other  so lots of things will come in Monday.
In the meantime: Ken D. I got your letter! Joy, I got yours too. 
I will answer you I promise.
jsd-got yours but we can't figure out, since you're at MIT and our mainframe
is, I think, at MIT (it's in Boston anyway), why your letter went to
Georgia and Michigan first! I HAVE played Colourbox.
To Preston-Shona Laing is from New Zealand and I would have played her
except that I got a tape with a new New Zealand band-Look Blue Go Purple.
It was sent by a netlander so I just had to play it. Besides, I liked it a
lot and I've played Shona many, many times since her LP came out.
To James Smith-Every photo I've ever seen of Sherine (Big Pig) she looks
black to me (At least partially). She even looks black in the video to
"Breakaway". I was going to play Big Pig as an Australian choice in my last
show but I had to axe them due to time constraints. No snub intended!
Everyone else-be patient. THANKS for the support! See you Sunday (or Monday)
