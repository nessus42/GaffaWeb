In a previous article, bhutchin@pen.k12.va.us (Bradley N. Hutchinson) says:

&gt;If you're interested in other views of the Knights Templar and
&gt;other conspi, you may wish to look for fiction by Robert Anton
&gt;ilson and non (?) fiction by the same.  He also wrote a play
&gt;ccalled _Wilhelm Reich in Hell_.  Wilson is always entertaining
&gt;and even, at times, enlightenin.  He's even mentioned in the
&gt;new Tom Robbins' novel _Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas_.

	That's Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea, and the Novel is
_Illuminatis!_. RAW also has a quasi-sequal out called Schrodinger's Cat.
He has widly publicized the mistreating of Wilhelm Reich, and has gone
through Reichian Theorpy. Most of his non-fiction stuff comes out on
Falcon Press, his fiction, DELL. He is also a follower of Eris, the Greek
Goddess of Chaos,and thus Patron of Computers...as are many of the
Net.Gods here. Why do you  thinkg that the default port for TCP/IP is 23,
the Holy Number of the Ancient Illuminated Seekers of Bavaria, of which
RAW claims to be one of the heads. It is also 2+3=5, the Holy Number of Eris.

	And, just to evangelize a bit...here are the 5 laws:

                THE FIVE COMMANDMENTS (THE PENTABARF)

The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the Fifth Year
of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun
deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a
mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks &amp; 11 hours of intensive
scrutiny he
discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing
it upside down.

                         KNOW YE THIS O MAN OF FAITH!

I - There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. There is no
Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And
every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm.

II - A Discordian Shall Always use the Official Discordian Document Numbering
System.

III - A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off
Alone &amp;
Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday; this Devotive Ceremony to
Remonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom
(no meat on Friday), of Judaism (no meat of Pork), of Hindic Peoples (no meat
of Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal), and of Discordians (no Hot Dog
Buns).

IV - A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the
Solace of Our Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.

V - A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing What he reads.

IT IS SO WRITTEN! SO BE IT. HAIL DISCORDIA! PROSECUTORS WILL BE
TRANSGRESSICUTED.


Hail Eris!
