&gt; That whole business about the guy stalking Sarah McLaughlin is too too 
&gt; creeepy.  Brrrr!  Did anyone catch the article about Kate earlier on in 
&gt; the Red Shoes release that talked about the weird mail that is sent to 
&gt; the old apartment she lived in?
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently the woman who lives there is named "Cathy" and people send 
&gt; mail to Cathy at that address.  She opens them to find their from a 
&gt; variety of weirdos, including someone who claims that Catherine Earnshaw 
&gt; (the fictional character) is a living person and he can produce her if 
&gt; Kate is interested.
&gt; 
&gt; Weird.  As I remember that gave me the creeps, too.  Does anyone remember 
&gt; what article that was?

It was this one:

DAFT AS A BUSH

        Nick Coleman

Kate Bush - what's she like, eh, with her wailing voice, whimsical words and 
penchant for throwing wild Terpsichorean shapes? Suitably intrigued by her 
new album and accompanying, film, Nick Coleman tries to suss out the bird in 
the Bush.

I have a friend who lives in the house Kate Bush grew up in. It's an old 
and creaky Victorian house and my friend inhabits the attic, which was 
converted into a flat some time in the '80s when the house was sold. My 
friend's name is Catherine and she gets loads of post.

[...]

My friend Catherine has never opened any post addressed to Kate Bush. 
There was, however, a letter that came addressed merely to 'Catherine '. 
So Catherine opened it. Inside was a lot of stream-of-consciousness stuff 
about dreams, and about how the writer was watching Catherine. So 
Catherine snorted, noted the postmark and forgot about it. Then another 
letter arrived, identically addressed, from the same postal region; then 
another, and another, each of them increasingly weird and disturbing. 
Sometimes three would arrive in a day. And it so happened that on the 
day that Catherine decided to go to the police, a letter arrived that 
included a reference to Catherine's poetry and music, neither of which 
are big with Catherine. Also, the letter included the appellation Kate.'

[...]

Other post addressed to Kate Bush arrived which went unopened. Then 
one day a letter came for the attention of Catherine Earnshaw. This 
being ambiguous, Catherine opened it just to make sure. Inside was a 
note from a Harley Street doctor indicating that Catherine was fit as a 
fiddle. This was good news. Unfortunately, Catherine had not been to 
see a Harley Street doctor. She hastily sent the letter on to Bush's record 
company, blushing at her daftness in not remembering immediately that 
Catherine Earnshaw is the name of the storm-tossed tragic heroine of 
'Wuthering Heights '.

===============================================================================

I'm somewhat sceptical about Mr. Colemans tales since "the house Kate
Bush grew up in" wasn't "sold in the 80s" and I'd be surprised if the
Bushes rented out the attic....
