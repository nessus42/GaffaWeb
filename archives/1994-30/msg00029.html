In article &lt;35b32n$g1a@master.cs.rose-hulman.edu&gt;, williasr@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (williasr@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu) writes:

&gt;Before the album came out, I had almost no knowledge of Kate Bush, save  
&gt;seeing her name in a few different books on music...Upon actually hearing  
&gt;Eat the Music and Rubberband Girl, I decided to go out and buy the album.
&gt;I was far from disappointed.  These days, to find any album which is  
&gt;reasonably consistent, and includes songs that are rather touching is a  
&gt;rare occurence.  

Hey, wow, TRS was the first Kate album I bought.  It was a pure
impulse purchase - I was in a record store just browsing and they
were playing TRS as it had just been released.  The very first
track I heard was "Why Should I Love You?" and it wasn't until I
found myself bouncing up the aisle in time with the music that I
realised what an impact it was having on me.  I just *had* to get
the album, purely for that one track. 

&gt;
&gt;The first time I listened to the album, the one song that stood out from  
&gt;the rest was 'Moments of Pleasure'.  I ended up putting that song on  
&gt;repeat play and just listening to it over and over...It was really  
&gt;touching, but not knowing exactly what it was about I could accept that  
&gt;there was at least a little bit of humour in it...at least it always  
&gt;lightened the mood to hear 'Every old sock meets an old shoe' which might  
&gt;be deep and profound...but still seemed a bit absurd.  Don't get me wrong,  
&gt;the song does really touch me.  I suspect a lot of people can identify  
&gt;with the lines 'just being alive, it can really hurt...', and the emotion  
&gt;in Kate's voice defies words.

Well of course, having got TRS home and played it a few times I,
too, discovered "Moments of Pleasure".  My reaction was slightly
different; I see no humour in the "sock" line, in fact I find it
*very* poignant - "And I can hear my mother saying ....".  The
whole song is so intensely personal, I don't know how Kate could
be so courageous as to share it with the rest of the world.  I find
only one drawback with MOP - I can't listen to it anymore because
of the effect is has on my emotions.

I should take this opportunity to pluck up the courage and say
that, err.., &lt;sheepish grin&gt;, TRS is the *only* Kate album I have. 
Yeah, go on, flame away...  I *know* I should buy the rest and I
will very soon.  It's just that there are so many *good* artists
around and my funds are not unlimited.  In mitigation, I do have
some of her singles; does that count?  No; didn't think it did. 
Sorry! :-)

   Ray (pondering on what a really bad person he must be to not
        have every album Kate has made.)

BTW Why, oh why, did it take 4 days for me to get the original
article???  Rhetorical question; the Net's falling apart.
