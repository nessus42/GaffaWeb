&gt;&gt;Drewcifer, who thinks every human should own at least one Kate Bush album

&gt;Any _one_ in particular?  Just curious.  I mean, if every single person in the
&gt;whole world should have at least one of Her albums, which one would be most
&gt;appropriate?  My vote goes for the obvious, HoL.  Although TC is certainly
&gt;Her most challenging and "interesting" work, I honestly believe HoL is the
&gt;most fully realized and well-rounded of her albums.

&gt;Anyone?  Anyone?

You know, I've tried and tried to pick just one, and I can't do it for the
life of me.

TKI is full of amazing songs, but not as powerful and as rich in sound as
the later stuff.

L is very colorful but the overall picture is weaker than the other albums.

NFE is brilliant, and possibly my favorite album, but I think I'd miss the
raw power of TD and some of TRS if I had only that one to listen to.

TD is incredible and rich and powerful and a cornucopia of ideas, both
musical and lyrical.  The trouble is that it's also very abrasive in places;
I'd opt for a sound in between NFE and TD, that's raw but not grating,
beautiful but not subdued.

HoL is a work of genius, and maybe KaTe's most cerebral album in ways.  It's
not as colorful, though, as its predecessors, and it's difficult to separate
the songs from each other.

TSW is full of chills and deep, dark sounds, but the low spots haven't been
this low since L.  Also, the humor and playfulness of some of the earlier
work is all but absent.

TRS is bright, bold, and energetic, but not as solidly "artistic," whatever
that means, as the mid-canon albums.

Taken as a whole, KaTe's work is without parallel.  But I can't disintegrate
the collection.  One album is better than none, but the whole is so much
more than the sum of its parts.

Mind you, all of this is my personal opinion, and I'm only interested in
wasting my time arguing over it to a point.
