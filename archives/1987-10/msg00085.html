("No shit, Sherlock...")

Here is a transcription of the lyrics to "Be Kind to My Mistakes" as
best as my aching ears will allow....

"Be Kind to My Mistakes"

	(It is this that brings us together)
	(It is this that brings us together)

	It's all right, darling
	We can do this together
	It's all right, darling
	I can think of nothing better
	I don't know you, and you don't know me
	It is this that brings us together

	(It is this that brings us together)
	(It is this that brings us together)

	I don't know what you are lookin' for in me
	I don't know what I want, but my heart is needy
	In [my or your eyes], in your mind
	We'll find all we're meant to find
	In your life, in my life
	There are secrets too dark to let out,
	To let go out, to get over

	That's all right, baby
	Oh, that's all right by me
	Cause, it's all right now
	Just let me say pleee-ease, pleee-ease,
	pleee-ease, pleee-ease
	Be kind, be kind to my mistakes
	Be kind, be kind to me

The phrase in the brackets [] is very run together and impossible to
separate even at greatly reduced playback speeds. Probably Kate's
way of allowing multiple interpretations of the song by filling in
the blank yourself. Still, this song was much easier to transcribe 
than "Not This Time". 

Speaking of "Not This Time", |&gt;oug (remember him?) posted a transcription
of the lyrics to this song last year. After trying to do it myself, I
have to admit that his version sounds a lot closer to the real thing
than mine does. As for "Delius", I haven't even tryed that yet.

After the diversion caused by BKtmM, I am back to trying to figure out
the hidden message in X4 (if anyone still gives a shit about that).
I have become quite convinced that this
phrase and the "Five, Experiment 4, Experiment 4" heard later in the
12 in version are meant to be comments being made by people running
the experiment. However, my previous interpretation "I get blasts from
too many instruments" appears to have been blown out of the water when
I greatly reduced the playback speed (dropping the vocal app. 2 octaves)
and started hearing 12 syllables (vs. 10 I previously heard). The phrase
"...too many instruments" still sounds clear though. I think I'll give
this up until it becomes a puzzle in the Kate Bush Club newsletter and
start working on "Watching You Without Me"...

"I don't know why I build a mountain, every time
 And here I am wondering why I'm doing it again..."
