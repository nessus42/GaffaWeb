William Tsun-Yuk Hsu:
&gt;Interesting observation: many of the bands passing thru are not playing
&gt;New York City. People who've played here in the past three weeks: 
&gt;Snakefinger and the Vestal Virgins,...

Snakefinger did make it to NewYork.  Interesting show he puts on, it's
all one elaborate joke.  Perhaps the inclusion of Eric Drew Feldman in the
band reminded me of Beefheartian distortion.  What Beefheart does to R+B,
Snakefinger does to jazz and pop.  Fun Stuff.

Snakefinger was the final act of a four "band" show.  Big Stick started
things off by offending me and boring the skinheads.  Third-rate
thrash with ridiculous costumes.

Next up was From Here to Infinity.  This is 2 members of Sonic Youth
moonlighting.  They do electronic mix distortions of prerecorded tapes.
Quite interesting.  They got surprisingly good crowd response too.

Wiseblood.  I was looking forward to seeing this band despite poor
reviews, and a warning from the Voice that its just "One guy with a
synthesizer and one with a microphone."   Well, at least I expected
the microphone to be turned on.  Instead, Clint Ruin did a strip-tease
lipsync to a completely prerecorded soundtrack.  He's cute, but I was
not entertained.

After Wiseblood, the crowd took to the exits.  Half of those remaining
left during Snakefinger's first song.  An amazing transformation took
place.  A crowd of young suburban skinheads turned into an over 30
crowd of misfits in Residents t-shirts.  The misfits won this night,
they got the better show.
                               Tom Dube
