No KT news today, since it's already been announced by a couple of
Love-Hounds that The Whole Story video is now in shops across the
country; and that it is on the Sony (PMI) label. Perhaps it'll show up
as one of their 8mm tapes soon, too; but there's no sign of a
laser-disk yet, either Japanese or domestic. The quality of these
video-cassettes is hard to take after being spoiled by disk --
the resolution is TERRIBLE, and the sound, although pretty good,
has drop-outs all over the place. Even the sticker on the cassette
was slapped on crookedly. You can really see what a slapdash
product it is.

Now, the mail-bag:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Billy Green's posting was very helpful and much appreciated.
To answer your questions:
 1.) The new "Wow" video was Kate's idea. She said that
     she had never been satisfied with the original video
     for that track (directed by Keith MacMillan, aka "Keef"),
     and had always wanted to do a better job. Also, the Tour
     of Life, she felt, was a major part of "the whole story",
     and she wanted to have something to reflect that. Finally,
     she said that because she had been hesitant about releasing
     another video compilation which incorporated large parts of
     earlier video releases (entirely EMI's idea, and they were
     apparently going to go proceed with or without her participation),
     the addition of a new version of "Wow" would give fans
     who already had "some of the older videos" something more
     than just "Experiment IV" to watch on "The Whole Story". Kate's
     feelings about the whole project were definitely mixed from
     the beginning, but she tried to make the best product that
     she could, given the time limitations. All of this comes from
     Kate's "Zwort Finkle" interview, which was posted a few weeks
     ago in Love-Hounds. (That interview, in IED's opinion, was
     actually "conducted" by Kate herself.)

 2.) Yes, the video-mix of "The Big Sky" is different from the
     LP and twelve-inch mixes. It's actually the same mix as
     the "Special Single Mix" of the song (released only in
     the seven-inch format), and was apparently Kate's idea
     of a radio mix. Anyway, your description of it is correct:
     the only major difference is in the beginning of the song
     (the first four measures), which lack the heavy drum
     rhythms of the LP mix. Perhaps Kate felt that the single
     would work better with a less aggressive beginning, since
     it wouldn't be heard directly after the powerful ending
     of "Hounds of Love" as it is on the album. There
     may also be some slight change to the rhythm mix in the
     rest of the single, but IED isn't sure -- the fidelity
     on those seven-inches is so low that he can't trust his ears.

 3.) Why didn't they put all the videos on The Whole Story, you ask?
     A damn good question, one with an obvious answer: to make more
     money. As a result of leaving a few videos off of the new
     collection, many fans will still want to get The Single File. It's
     actually amazing that the whole of The Hair of the Hound was
     included -- Kate may have insisted that all five of her most
     recent videos be put on. Who can say?

 4.) Thanks for the re-assurance about Beta availability. IED
     picked up his Beta copy today at Tower.

 5.) Your question -- Why hasn't anyone thought of releasing the
     b-sides, etc. on CD? --  is one that IED has asked himself many
     times. A couple of weeks ago he even posted the
     hypothetical track-listings for two new KT CDs in Love-Hounds.
     One would have all the re-mixes. The other would have all the
     b-sides plus "Maybe", "The Magician", "Be Kind to My Mistakes",
     "Another Day", "Brazil" and "Make It Go Away". Something like
     this could actually materialize sometime in the next two years
     or so: EMI do plan to release two CDs of all the non-LP Beatles
     tracks starting early next year. Maybe they'll realize that there's
     money to be made from a similar pair of CDs for Bush fans during
     the painfully long wait between HoL and KBVI.

Why the name "Love-Hounds"? Ask |&gt;oug, who has actually
POSTED something about Kate recently! Maybe that's an
indication that he's finally come to his senses and realized
that real life is not as important as vicarious experience.
Hey, |&gt;oug, how come you like Roger Miller so much?
I mean, "King of the Road" is a catchy tune, but no masterpiece. Of
course, there is  "Dang Me", "Kansas City Star", and IED's favourite
of all:

"You can't rollerskate in a buffalo pool,
 You can't rollerskate in a buffalo pool,
 You can't rollerskate in a buffalo pool,
 But you can be happy if you've a mind to.

"All you gotta do is put your mind to it,
 Knuckle down, buckle down,
 Do it! do it! do it!
 Oh! You can't rollerskate in a buffalo pool
 But you can be happy if you've a mind to.

(What? Not THAT Roger Miller? Huh? Birdsongs of the what? Oh...)

NEVER MIND.

Ranjit: We'll make a straight trade, then. Your samples of
the mystery tracks (Experiment IV, Waking the Witch and the whole of
Watching You Without Me) backwards and forwards at real-time
and slowed-down speeds, for obsKuriTies. Your address needed, however.

An amazingly interesting posting from Ed Simpson deserves some
careful answers.

&gt;They seem to have been recorded
&gt;forward and then played backward during the mix down (not the other
&gt;way around as IED suggested).

As "Bob Eubanks" is wont to say when one of the newlyweds' starts
rabbit-punching her mate: Woah, there! Ease up, now, ease up!
IED suggested the inverse method for the "Leave It Open"
"mystery" track, and as a possible, partial solution to the main
"competition" mystery track from "Watching You Without Me". But
since he had never even heard the other backwards tracks till
Phil Stephens pointed them out in Love-Hounds recently, he certainly
didn't mean to say that he knew how they were made. He's inclined
to agree with you, though, that they are probably simple backwards
maskings, but the method she developed for scattering the sounds
and synching them with the gaps in the forward-directional
scattered-vocal track is still a complete mystery to this listener.
Phil was right, though: at least some of the messages are definitely
there.

IED doubts the accuracy of your changes to the liner
notes' lyrics, especially your line "You in the room with me."
It sounds like "Here in the room with me now."

About "X4", IED, too, hears John's first word as "Five", followed
by "Experiment IV". This adds still another mystery to the whole
business. If directing videos was "Experiment III" (according to
the "Zwort Finkle" interview), and making deadly musical weapons
was "Experiment IV", then what were Experiments I, II and "Five"?

The "Psycho"-like "ee-ee"s in the second weird scatter/echo
section of "X4"  -- are you sure it's actually Kate's voice
making that particular noise? It sounds more like the violinist,
or maybe some kind of Fairlight-sampled sound, to this listener.
But it is, as you imply, almost certainly a deliberate reference to
"Psycho" and Bernard Herrmann.

John Carder Bush went to law school, and may even have
a solicitor's degree. At any rate, he does review much of
Kate's business, but at the time of the video documentary
of which you speak, Hilary Walker was still officially Kate's manager.
Also, that television show, although originally German-made,
was later broadcast in Holland without the constant voice-over
translation into German. This is probably the version you saw,
since the original German version is nearly unwatchable due to
the blotting out of the Bush family's words.

IED assumes that the Kate Bush video party in Roanoke was
organized by Mike Weaver. Is this true? IED has been trying
to get Mike to logon to Love-Hounds, but with no luck so far.
Maybe you could tell him what he's missing?

About "Ran Tan Waltz": the "video" version clarifies the story
somewhat. The song is sung by the husband, whose wife is neglecting
her motherly and wifely duties and apparently cheating on the husband.
Naturally, Kate plays the part of the old husband: hence, the beard.
The ethnic associations of the story and the song are still unclear
to IED, however. Does anyone know what "Ran Tan", which presumably
refers to sex on the sly, means? If so, in which language does
it mean it in? The costumes in the video look sort of Hassidic to
IED, but that wouldn't make any sense, would it?

"The Kick Inside" videos are from a group of six called the
"Efteling" special. IED thought it was Dutch, not properly
Scandinavian. The video for "The Kick Inside" is interesting
for its references to the story in the old Celtic song "Lucy
Wan" and to the pictorial quotations of the Arthurian/Tennysonian stories
of Elaine and of The Lady of Shalott, both of which were much illustrated
in nineteenth-century British art.

The video of "The Infant Kiss" was, in all probability, the
extremely well-made version by longtime Kate fan Chris Williams
of Kansas City, Missouri. That video was so good that it was
shown at the official Kate Bush Convention in Romford, 1985;
and Kate loved it so much that she called Chris and Vickie
up to thank them. It includes precisely the bits of the film
("The Innocents") that Kate had been most affected by as a child.

The bass player on the Prince's Trust Gala was Mick Karn,
formerly the bass and sax player for Japan, now a very fine
solo artist. Incidentally, that old Prince's Trust tape has
just been released again domestically.

Steve, the Saturday Night Live appearance (tell your friends they
don't know what they're talking about) was unfortunately edited
out of the show for the syndicated "Saturday Night" comedy series.
So your best chance of getting a copy would be through trading
with fans for a miserable twentieth-generation copy.

Arrgghh! Thanks for the warning, bd. IED will try to keep his grammar
up to snuff. (How humiliating!)
About Dave's thoughts on the Wickham Street Irregulars, IED can
see that this was an idea before its time. (Harumph.)

Greg Samson's rumour about KT and PG is without foundation.
Don't you agree, |&gt;oug? It's you she's having the affair with, right?

As for the different The Kick Inside covers, come to the
West Coast Love-Hounds party next month if you want to see them!

Finally, a note to Mark Ganzer: Although he may have seemed to reject
your theory about the "X4" message, IED is not really all that
certain about the accuracy of his interpretation. You may have a
closer transcription than he, after all.

-- Andrew Marvick
   Los Angeles party now planned for sometime around the 22nd of May.
