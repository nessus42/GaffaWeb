First of all, IED would just like to mention to the
various L-Hs who have said that they had sent tapes
to him, that he has not actually received any tapes.
It may be that
he put a typo in his address or something, but anyway
he has no Gabriel, KT or backwards tapes yet.

Second, the West Coast Love-Hounds Laser-disk
party is definitely happening on Friday, May 22nd,
beginning at 8 p.m. The address is 10499 Wilkins
Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90024. Telephone (213) 474-5208.
All of Kate's videos will be shown, in Laser-Vision with
digital audio; plus as many of Kate's other television
appearances as time allows for. Refreshments, too! If you're
interested in attending, please post to IED or Love-Hounds or
give me, Andrew, a call.

The Baker Street Regulars were a group of street children
who performed errands, undertook detective legwork and
kept their ears to the grapevine for Sherlock Holmes in
the Arthur Conan Doyle mystery stories. The Baker Street IRregulars,
who publish The Baker Street Irregular Quarterly,
are a modern group of Sherlockian "scholars" who maintain
a very high standard of interpretive and creative analysis
of the Holmes canon. The work varies from serious, rather
dry facts-and-dates-gathering to wild, tongue-in-cheek
show-pieces which are presented in stuffy academic
prose, often heavily footnoted. Many eminent writers
and public figures have belonged to the BSI, including
the mystery writer Rex Stout, who once presented a paper
to the BSI which argued elaborately in favour of the preposterous theory
that Holmes was a woman.

The first single from the forthcoming Go West album
is now out, but Kate's track is not on the single.
Can't be long, now, though.

Can someone tell IED what words Kate sings in the fourth line in
BKtmM (the line directly following the second "It's all right,
darling")? Also, what is she singing in the two lines which
precede the line, "We'll find all we're meant to find"?

In fact, there are quite a few individual lines or words
in Kate's songs which continue to elude IED's understanding.
Does anyone think he/she really knows all the lyrics to
"Not This Time"? What about "Delius"?

Incidentally, the British war movie "The Cruel Sea" was on
cable over the weekend. This is the movie which Kate mentioned
was a specific visual stimulus for The Ninth Wave. It's an extremely
good movie, very anti-war, with no glamourization of any kind, and
several really horrifying scenes of chaos in battle. There are
three or four places in the movie where sailors are seen floating
helplessly in the ocean in the night and early morning, and they
really do have a tremendous impact. A lot of unsettling shots of
the ocean waves throughout, and great understated British acting.
Dynamite screenplay by Eric Ambler; but the score had no musical
connection with Kate's work, as far as IED could tell.
