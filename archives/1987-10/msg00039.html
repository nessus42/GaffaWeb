&gt;Really-From: Dorito Breath Trowbridge  &lt;ins_aset%JHUNIX.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu&gt;

&gt;Your posting was completely worthless and utterly rude. It was
&gt;just mindless flaming from somebody who obviously have no conception
&gt;of what Husker Du are about. Grant Hart and Bob Mould write very
&gt;sophisticated, often very catchy pop songs and then make their music
&gt;subversive by playing as noisily and grungily as possible. Actually,
&gt;"Warehouse: Songs and Stories" is much slicker than, say, the primal
&gt;"Land Speed Record." You can't call them punk, but that's obviously
&gt;where their roots are.

translation:  before they weren't very accessible, but now they write
pop songs and they are accessible, and therefore I like them and they
are great because they are accessible.

&gt;Well, some of us really appreciate the SOUL and FEELING and ENERGY
&gt;in that "noisy" ol' junk. That's why some of us love the Volcano Suns
&gt;and the Lyres and Sonic Youth and fIREHOSE and Throwing Muses. They
&gt;don't play with the polished professionalism of FM favorites, but
&gt;some of us wouldn't want them to. As for the rest of you, these bands
&gt;are easy to ignore unless you listen to college radio (I'm surprised
&gt;that Joanie had the Huskers on her show, but I suppose it's because
&gt;somebody at Warner Bros. pulled a few strings). You can go through
&gt;life without being aware of the Fall and Christmas, but we
&gt;"alternative" folks can't avoid the top-40 -- stores, restaurants,
&gt;movies, car radios are constantly blaring it.

translation:  some of us dweebs have souls and feelings but only if we
are told by NME and melody maker what the bands are we should feel
about.  we also find the trendy record labels and attach ourselves to
the accessible band enimating from these labels. Huskers sold out, we
know that, but rock critics call it "becoming accessible" (funny, huh?)

&gt;I wasn't offended by Pat's statement; I disagree with it, but there
&gt;was nothing inflammatory or mean-spirited about it. Yours was
&gt;just a crude, extended put-down of Husker Du and their fans. It's
&gt;one thing to say "I think T-Bone Burnett sucks" (which I do), and it's
&gt;quite another to say "T-Bone Burnett is such a no-talent, completely
&gt;worthless performer, I can't understand how anybody in their right
&gt;mind could ever like that crap," etc. etc. Note the difference?
&gt;Note the "I think" in the first example? Note how the second
&gt;example insults the performer AND the fans?

my turn:  "I think JD Constantslime is a no-talent worthless piece of
human flesh that should be allowed to put pencil to paper and I can't
understand why anyone would want to suck his dick."  I'm so proud of
myself....

god
