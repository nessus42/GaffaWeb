first of all why doesnUt someone forward the list of addresses to
labovitz (bdmrrr!psc!jsl@seismo.css.gov) so the dude can send it
out to the next person.  If one the first two people were INTelligent
enough (and they arenUt)  they might of included a list with the
damn tape, but no.......

So Mr. Kirsch has got his tongue firmly entrenched in the ANUS of
ms. trowelbridge.  Are you trying to get third-hand promos from JD
(which sue has to of course blow in order to hear the latest
woodentops and and and...)

mr ied seems very confused by what gender he is since he was confused
by mr slopmanUs ranting of white drunk hetro males.  pay no mind
to him, heUs trying to find the proper white supremist brethren
for his cat to marry....(and if you really want to know the scoop
on white hetro males, talk to rossi, he leads them all)

since mr. kirsch seems so intent on knowing WHY i would hate a
black-clothed wavo english band full of dried up wankers then let
me tell you....they really really suck. they used to be just stupid
and english, now they are old, stupid, and english. and they
especially deserve to go to the gas chamber when you could turn on
your all so trendy music wankervision and see their RvideoS (Rbut
but but,S the wanker stammers, Rthey didnUt sell out they, they
just became more accessibleS) and therefore deserve a gun to their
head and bunch of the RbrethrenS beating the haircuts out of them.
I have better things to do with my time like listening to Diver
Down from Van Halen and cranking it up and wondering why this cult
shit that people are wanking about is really a bunch of bullshit
cause they canUt really come close to zepplin if they fucking tried
since no but noone is gonna be able to imitate bohnam.

speaking of OLD and IN THE WAY, listen to the new david bowie album
and see for yourself how decrepit the dude is (I mean ANYbody who
would get peter washed up frampton to play guitar on their album
is hurting, though the songs all sound stupid and he was even the
cause for fucking up the latest iggy album.

Eugune is coming back to dc in may, so Hsu if you are really a
bonehead and miss the buttholes, then check out eugune at space
where you can stand in front of hofmann and he can gob beer spit
on the back of your jacket.

(all of this is true) wank
