&gt;   A quick round of congratulations to Humble Pseudo-Moderator Emeritus

&gt;   to tell the world.)

Uh, oh!  Now that that word is out, I won't be chased by all those
Humble Pseudo-Moderator Emeritus groupies anymore.  Ah, well....  It
doesn't matter because now I am living in marital bliss in Winchester,
Mass.  Thanks for the good wishes!

I want to comment on the idea brought up by several people of active
moderation.  The problem with this is that it requires a lot more free
time than most people have (if they have a life).  I tried doing
active moderation for a while, and I was always way behind on the
articles.  Old timers will probably remember these days with fear and
dread.  I think I still have a pile of articles lying around somewhere
that I unfortunately never got around to posting.  I wonder if I
should post them after all these years for yucks....

I'm sure someone could do a top notch job of active moderation, if you
could find 1,000 people willing to pay $50 a year for the service.
Sign me up.  It would be worth $50 to me.  I think it might be hard to
find another 999 funders, though.

Another small tidbit (I think this has been mentioned before, but I'll
mention it again): A couple of weeks ago I picked up at Tower Books a
British magazine called something like ".net", and it came with a
little paperback book on the Internet as a free bonus.  The little
book has on its cover a collage of images taken from WWWeb sites, no
doubt, and the most prominent image is one of none other than our
beloved Kate.
