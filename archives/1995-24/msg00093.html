Many thanks to Bill  and Jessica for sharing their home with us!  In spite of the rather 
terrific heat, we had a great party.  Bill downloaded the new Fruitopia commercial that 
has been made available at Click3X home page and we got to see that -- a nice piece of 
music by Kate.  Karen-Bob sez check it out.  Interestingly enough, Click3X  logo is a pair of 
Red Shoes!  Dorothy's, not Kate's . . . click your heels together three times and say "There's 
no place like home . . . there's no place like home."  

Our already warm Katemas was heated up by a truly exciting session of Kate Bush 
Jeopardy which was accomplished with much arm waving, laughter, indignation, and 
judgement calls -- and was so close we nearly tied.  In the end everyone won and prizes 
were passed round, just like the Caucus Race in Alice in Wonderland, except no-one 
choked.  

We also viewed the laser discs of TSW, TSF, TLTCTC on Bill's special ProScan 
letterbox-format giant television, a truly magnificent piece of equipment that warmed the 
cockles of my heart.  With the push of a button a letter box image fills the letterbox shaped 
screen, which was as big as some theaters I've been in!  

Our viewing of TLTCTC raised some interesting points about this movie . . . I'm beginning 
to think there is more here than meets the eye at first.  Worthy of more discussion than it 
has had in the past, that's for sure!  IED may have some commentary about this.

I am personally grateful, and think I can speak for Andy and John, at the warm reception 
to our humble attempt at taping.  (Actually, Andy's taping with input from both of us.)  
And especial thanks to the many folks around the world who continue to share their tape 
collections.  Real credit has to go to the folks who thought up the whole concept of tape 
sharing in the first place . . . we all know who you are and &lt;smooch!&gt;

John will be asking for volunteers this week to help with getting the free copies made for 
everyone who wants a tape.  Watch for his posting on that.

As usual it was wonderful to see old friends and a joy to meet new ones.  Happy Katemas 
everyone, and Happy Birthday Kate, where ever you are.
