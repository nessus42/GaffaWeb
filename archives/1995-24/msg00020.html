(Pardons to those who'll see this more than once.  At least this is
the short version.  No, there's no Jane, Milla, Kate or Sarah content
but I hope I'll be forgiven)

Please don't write my sysadmin.  Please write *me* if you're angry at my
posting this.  
------------------


Hello...I know that at least a couple of people might categorize this
post in the Land of Spam, but I consider it more of an important
informational post.  Some will be interested in it and some will
not.  I was interested when I saw it so I hope I'm not wrong in
thinking that others will be too.

I'm sending this to some music groups because Tori Amos is involved
and I know she has fans scattered around in these groups.  In a 
separate crosspost I'm sending it to some of the abuse newsgroups
because even people who don't know of Tori Amos might be interested.

One question a few people might ask is if this RAINN thing is really
legit.  Some of you know me and of my past and some of you don't.  For
those who don't know me all I can do is ask that you trust me when I
say that not only is RAINN legitimate, it works.

I can say that it works because I used it myself and I'm probably
alive because of it.  I'm not just trying to sound melodramatic, it's
the truth.  At the end of this next part I'll talk more about my
personal experience (I won't add it to all the crossposts though, to
save on space) and it can easily be read or skipped at will.  I don't
have any connection with RAINN except as someone who used the service
at a time when I really needed it.  I'd hate to see it go away and
not be available for others who desperately need it.

Please consider giving RAINN support.  Thanks for your patience.

Subject: TORI's Hotline May Go Under
Date: 21 Jul 1995 17:38:27 -0400
Organization: America Online, Inc. (1-800-827-6364)

HOTLINE FOUNDED BY TORI AMOS ABOUT TO GO UNDER
AMERICA'S ONLY NATIONAL RAPE HOTLINE IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF  FUNDS

The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), a non-profit
organization based in Washington, D.C., operates the only national hotline
for victims of sexual assault. The hotline was founded last summer by Tori
Amos.  Tori also chairs RAINN's advisory board.

When victims call the toll-free hotline (800-656-HOPE) they are
automatically connected to a trained counselor from the rape crisis center
closest to them; presently 599 rape crisis centers nationwide participate
with RAINN to provide services to victims.  The hotline provides callers
access to counseling 24 hours a day, from 48 states and the District of
Columbia.    

Since RAINN began last July, the hotline has provided the critical help
needed by thousands of rape victims.  In fact, the response has been so
overwhelming that funds are running out.  In order to keep the hotline up
and running, we need to raise $120,000 in the next few weeks.

In its few months of existence, RAINN has already helped more than 15,000
victims of sexual violence.  

Many calls to RAINN are from children being molested by someone in their
household; before RAINN, they were afraid to get help because a call would
show up on their phone bill.  

Many more cannot afford a call to a rape crisis center hundreds of miles
away; before RAINN, help was effectively unavailable.

Now that a national rape hotline has finally been established, we want to
continue this service that is so necessary to so many people.  We have the
potential to help many more thousands of rape victims, but we must raise
the money to do so. 

We know how inappropriate it is to appeal for funds in this newsgroup, and
we apologize in advance.  If the need wasn't so urgent, we wouldn't be
doing this.

Please help us.
