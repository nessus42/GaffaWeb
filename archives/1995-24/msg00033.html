Hi!

Just when I thought I had all of Kate's bootleg CDs... ;-)

But finally it's one with 'new' material!

&gt; Collaborations  must have just hit the market.  I picked up a copy for
&gt; $25 and it was definitely worth it.  It takes songs that I've been
&gt; looking for , mostly from the Can bootleg series, I think, or just the
&gt; original versions.  The track listing is as follows:

I hope it's not just from The Can, since my copy of The Can warbles wildly.
Sounds like the whole in the middle of the LP isn't really in the middle.
And despite that, The Can only has
- Bongo version of December Will Be Magic Again
- Be Kind To My Mistakes (soundtrack version)
- Sing Children Sing (but no Rainbow Games)
- You (...)...
- Flowers
- Sister And Brother
- Once
- The Seer

It's a bit strange that The King Is Dead has been taken from vinyl, since
it's available on CD as well. On an official CD even.

&gt; 1. Sing Children Sing - with Lesley Duncan.  from vinyl.
&gt; 2. Rainbow Games - B-side to above.

Does Kate contribute to Rainbow Games as well? This would be the first time
I've heard about that! (It even *is* the first time I hear the name of the
b-side...)

&gt; 3. Another Day

I presume this is from the Christmas Special 'Kate'?

&gt; 4. The Man with the Child in His Eyes - With Peter Gabriel - sounds like
&gt; it s from the _Angel s on Earth_ boot.

Does Peter Gabriel change the lyrics to 'The Girl with...'? And is there
some other male vocal on there? And is the sound quality barely listenable?
Then this should be the live audience recording from the Bill Duffield
benefiz concert previously only available on the vinyl bootleg LP 'If You
Could See Me Fly'. And it's not only PG and KB performing there, Steve
Harley is also in there.

&gt; 5. The King is Dead - with Go West - from vinyl

Again, why vinyl? I bought the CD years ago and didn't have too much
trouble locating it.

&gt; 6. Once - with Roy Harper.
&gt; 7. Don t Give Up - live with PG.  Same as _This Woman s Live Work_ version.
&gt; 8. Let it Be - trades vocals with David Gilmour (who also plays guitar).

I've not yet heard the Secret Policeman's Third Ball version of Let It Be,
is this it? Or is it the one from the Bill Duffield benefiz concert?

&gt; 9. Flowers - with Zane Griff - from vinyl
&gt; 10. You (The Game, Part III) - with Roy Harper
