Anders, while you have some interesting points, you seem to not know the
real reason we get so bloody irate when people post giant weird irrelevant
messages to Love Hounds. 

Many or most of us get Love Hounds in DIGEST form.  What this means is 
that you get one e-mail message every day with all of yesterday's 
additions to Love Hounds in it.  You can't skip the off topic messages.  
You have to scroll through them, one slow page at a time.

Believe me, scrolling through thirty pages of magazine lists is not my 
idea of a joyful, fun way to spend my afternoon.  If I had the option of 
just skipping this fecal matter from flatulent camels, I would.

Therefore, we are trying to figure out ways to keep giant weird 
irrelevant messages out of the digest.

If the digest is automated, perhaps there is a way to limit the size of
the messages it includes for delivery.  For example, when our foul and
fleabitten magazine friends inevitably strike again, if the "digester"
knew that a file more than X kb in size was not to be included, it would
skip that one.  This would also solve the problem of well meaning and
innocent folks posting graphics files to the group.  These are always
enormous and would get screened out, saving the poster the hell of having 
all the Hounds of Love baying at their heels.

Of course, I have no idea if any of this is possible.

Anders, I'm not singling you out, it just seemed like a good opportunity 
to bring everyone who doens't know about the digest up to speed.  

P.S. Telling the systems operators about the magazine ads seemed to 
work.  Those accounts got closed and I got nice thank you's from the 
folks involved.  They don't want people using their computers for crap 
any more than we want to get it.
