Hi!

Wow, I was finally able to read a Digest all the way through for the first
time in over a week!  When they're over 25 screens, I give up.  I hope I
haven't missed anything important.

Anyway, amidst all this talk of moderating and restricting access and dividing
the list from the newsgroup and all, I just want to add an experience I had
the other day.  I got spammed via e-mail by someone who had gotten my name
from "USENET postings", which means postings to love-hounds since the list
is gated to the newsgroup and I have avoided USENET like the plague for many
years.  I contacted the offending party's postmaster and the matter has been
taken care of, but it rather surprised me that I got on the spam list, since
I'd never thought it would happen that way.

I really have no opinion on whether or not to keep the list and the newsgroup
mated like they are, but I thought I would mention my wonderful spam experience
just to make the rest of you aware.

Sigh.  Call me elitist, but it was *so* nice when hardly anybody knew about
the Net...

ObKaTe:  An interesting alternate universe story would be based on the premise
that Kate Bush had never released an album.  Where would music be now if that
hadn't happened?  Would Sarah McLachlan be writing gospel tunes?  Would Happy
Rhodes only have a two octave range?  One thing's for sure, the music press
would have nobody to compare female musicians to once they ran out of Joni
Mitchell. ;&gt;
