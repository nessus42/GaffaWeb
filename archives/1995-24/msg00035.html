[I am resending this, as I never saw it appear in the digest (and neither
 did Stev0]

This morning, Silk Cut (the cigarette people) sent me a glossy magazine
(it has a sort of "jet set" theme with a side order of quirkiness). I
suspect this is an attempt to circumvent the likelihood of an imminent
UK government ban on cigarette advertising.

There are a lot of full-page photographs with tenuous connections to
the minimalist text (in fact, it reads rather like a graphical web page).
To get to the point - in the middle of a travel feature, there is a
full page photo of a Netscape browser displaying Stev0's T-shirts page!
(with the prominent "Useless Site of the Week" logo).  Good love-hounds
will know that the first entry on the page is for the r.m.g. T-shirt
(the on-screen links indicate that the user has read the shirt's page,
but not the link to the newsgroup:-)

Getting still weirder, there is an offer at the back selling T-shirts
with one of three photos from the magazine on them - one of these is
Stev0's page!  I think he should have one, then it can be added to the
T-shirt page self-referentially :-)

The offer appears to be open only by post within the UK - the shirts
are &lt;pounds&gt;3 including p&amp;p.  Stev0, let me know if you would like
me to buy you one!

Disclaimer: I have no connection with Silk Cut other than smoking their
cigarettes and approving of their occasional motor sport sponsorship.

I had considered just mailing this to Stev0, but it seemed of wider
interest.

ObKate: Kate is known to have smoked Silk Cut (and probably still does).

Spare me the "advice" about how Kate or I should give up smoking because
it's bad for us - we already know that.

Another disclaimer: please don't start smoking Silk Cut just because
Kate does; I didn't.  (This reminds me of the Beavis &amp; Butthead
"these are not role models" spiel which annoys me so much, but I thought
I'd better put it in anyway).
