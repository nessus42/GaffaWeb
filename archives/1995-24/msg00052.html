Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1995/07/26
Version: 1.3.n minus 1.3.d

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

Sorry for the slight delay again, but now I'm *almost* though my email
backlog.  I hope everything works right with the 'real' FAQ, since I
upgraded my news system (that is, I installed a different one from
scratch).  Someone please tell me if no real FAQ comes along rec.music.gaffa
(remember - love-hounds doesn't get it, and it uses a different and as such
possibly slower way to reach your site than regular postings to gaffa like
this one).

-------------------8&lt;-------------------

1.4. Pictures?  Soundfiles?

     Right now there's a strict rule on love-hounds/rec.music.gaffa that we
     do not want any binaries posted to the group at all.  Tell us about them,
     ask where to put them, just do not post them.

[Don't worry, Dennis, this is just a reminder for everyone, not only for you ;-)]

[any late entries?]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     The Studio Demos (7 songs, 1977?, often listed along with The Cathy Demos)
[...]
        There have been rumors about a 'new' old Kate song called Turkish
        Delight.  Unfortunately the song is not from Kate, but rather from
        the Japanese group Sandii and the Sunsetz [VM, WW, Homeground #32].

[unfortunately no new Kate here]

     Cover versions of Kate's songs:

     Running Up That Hill
        Kat Devlin - (no recording available)
            (concert: Kat Elwynn Devlin Sings The Songs Of Kate Bush) [DR2]
            (concert: Kat Sings More Kate) [MT]

[the second entry is new]

     Songs about Kate Bush:

     Herve Christiani - Kate Bush
        (single 'Radio Bonheur / Kate Bush', album 'Il Est Libre Max')
            The song 'Kate Bush' is about a girl who has listened to Kate's
            records through a whole winter and then leaves her boyfriend.
     Jade Fashions - Babbittry Revision
        (12" maxi single 'Babbittry Revision / Pretty Boys In Pink')
            Babbittry Revision has 'very Kate-related lyrics'.
     Primus - Year of the Parrot
        (album 'tales from the punchbowl)
            The song contains lines 'I've seen the likes of Kate Bush and Van
            Morrison / teaching the parrots to sing' [AR2]

[new subsection]

4.11.Kate Bush World Wide Web (WWW) pages

     Ultimate Band List Kate Card
        <A  HREF="http://american.recordings.com/WWWoM/cgi-bin/ubl?card+1032">http://american.recordings.com/WWWoM/cgi-bin/ubl?card+1032</A>

        This page links to all the above URL's and several other Kate-related
        recources on the Internet (including rec.music.gaffa).

[address change]

     Ultimate Band List
        <A  HREF="http://198.147.111.1/WWWoM/ubl/ubl.shtml">http://198.147.111.1/WWWoM/ubl/ubl.shtml</A>

        This is the 'mother of all musical web pages', by far the best general
        source for music information on the web, because it lists almost all
        other resources, including the above Kate Card.

     Fruitopia commercial
        <A  HREF="http://www.click3x.com/spots/fruitopia.html">http://www.click3x.com/spots/fruitopia.html</A>

        This is the 1 minute commercial used in film theaters.  The page might
        not be up permanently. [AR]

     The Red Shoes discography
        <A  HREF="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~st">http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~st</A>

        This is Scott Telford's compilation of The Red Shoes related releases.

[three new entries]

5.1. The Cathy Demos / The Studio Demos

[change in section name from 'Home Demo Recordings']

5.6. Hounds of Love

     Cloudbusting:
        There is no such thing as a song called Cloudbursting (regard the
        spelling), and there is no remix of Cloudbusting called The
        Meteorological Mix, despite of what EMI America wants to tell us.
        EMI UK isn't really better, for the real spelling of what the world
        knows as the Organon Mix should have been Orgonon Mix (Orgonon was
        the name of Reich's home/center in Maine, Orgone energy was Reich's
        subject of studies). [IED]

        The song name comes from hunting clouds, not from breaking them, and
        the remix called Meteorological Mix is from The Big Sky. There are
        two remixes from Cloudbusting: The Orgonon Mix and the video version.

[new paragraphs. I hope I got it all right...]
