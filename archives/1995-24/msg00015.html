This is a reminder annoucement about the Katemas party in western
Massachusetts.  Although the party is appearing regularly in Karen's list,
the original announcement was in the digest containing the multiple script
files and some folks' mailers might have rejected it.

Especially for Jonathan and his "DW"....

  ** Katemas party in Belchertown, MA, Sunday, July 30th, 2:00 pm **

            The Katemas party with something for everyone!

Yes, we'll have the usual KaTefest downstairs -- videos and laser disks,
CDs and vinyl, plus a few collectible goodies to "ooh" and "ahh" over.
I've got a few extra treats and surprises planned as well.  But we'll
devote the upstairs VCR to "alternative" programming.  Browse through our
extensive video collection (several hundred tapes) or bring your own!
We'll set up the badminton net (weather permitting), or you can grab a
board game.  We'll even provide directions to nearby attractions, shopping,
etc.

Food?  Of course!  We finally got a grill last night so charred edibles and
their accompaniments will definitely be available (barring major
thunderstorms, of course).  I've been known to whip up a mean cookie or two
in my day, as well.  I'm sure there'll be more.

What else?  Who knows!  That depends on you.  It won't be a party without
Katefans so I need to know you're coming.  Please RSVP by Thursday, July
27th so I can plan (but feel free to decide to come at the last minute, I
just need a rough idea ahead of time).  That's (413) 323-6330 (with a very
flaky answering machine, if you're not sure if it took a message, try again
later) or cindy@aai.com.  And it'd be great to know that folks are coming
so I don't feel too rejected (whimper), so letting me know earlier is even
better.

Belchertown is a reasonable drive from much of southern New England, less
than two hours from most points.  I expect Boston-based LoveHounds to be at
Nancy's shindig, but surely we have more LoveHounds in other parts of New
England?  Directions available by phone or email.

So tell your DW that we'll take care of her, too, and bring some of that
Ben and Jerry's to share, Jonathan :-)

Cindy Loiselle

(And those going to woj and meredith's part should *definitely* go see
Boiled in Lead that night!)
