Hi,

I just got back from the San Francisco Katemas party (Actually,
I just got back from answering all my voice mail and email,
but you don't care, do you?)

Anyway, this was my forth consecutive Katemas party (and fifth
one in total), and each year they just get better and better
(which is pretty good, considering the first one was damn good,
and all the others were excellent 4-star bashes, too).

IED made a wonderful compilation tape, pretty much a sequel
to The Lovehounds collection called "Katetopia:  Total Kate
Intergration".  Other folks will soon talk about how YOU can
get a copy.  It's only one tape, but what a tape!  Wonderful
titles parodying the Fruitopia commercials, the commercials
themselves, the wince-worthy appearance on the Japanese
answer to Top of the Pops, wonderful parodies of Kate done
by Faith Brown (and not just the Wuthering Heights bit,
though we see part of that) and Not the Nine O'Clock News
(the infamous "Oh England, my Leotard" sketch).  These are
just some of the highlights on this tape, but I'll stop now
because I can see you drooling all over your keyboard and
it's disgusting.

I tried to log into TinyCRWU to go to the Katemas Party room
I set up, but surprise surprise, TinyCRWU was done (Saying
"TinyCRWU is down" is kind of like saying "Today has the letter
"a" in its name.")  Bill (Did I tell you the shindig was at
Our Humble Psuedo-Moderator's place?  And what a wonderful
place it is, too) logged into the Web and we saw the Katemas '95
pages (Oh, note to Richard Frost:  San Francisco is in CA, *NOT*
MA).

Speaking of which, we got a call from the folks at the Belchertown,
MA Katemas party (Which I enjoyed since I used to work there in
my first "real" job).

IED had his annual Jeopardy game.  Unlike last year, which was yours
truly against the rest of the room (and I would have won, too, if I
didn't blow it in Final Jeopardy), we had a number of bright folk
spewing answers left and right (of course, most of these folks were
at last year's party, too.  Either they got brighter or I got
dumber....naaah...)  We wound up with two teams (One side called "This
side of the room" and one called "That side of the room").  That Side
of The Room won because IED cheated in Final Jeopardy.  The answer
was "The names of three Fruitopia Commercials", and while he gladly
accepted ours of "Summer Solstice" and "Fighting Fruit", he didn't
accept "Summer Solstice in Japanese".

Prizes were awarded to all (including a lucky couple of folks who
got some Lovehounds T-shirts I coincidently just happened to get
ahold of just last week).  I got a copy of Katetopia - if anyone
in the South Bay has video tape-to-tape capabilities (I don't) and
wants a copy, email me, OK?

We then watched TLTC&amp;TC, noting new things yet again (Which if no
one else - Hi there, IED - posts the new theories, I will).

The party pretty much officially ended after that, with IED, myself,
and three others going out to a wonderful Thai restaurant where we
noticed all these Kate references (including these delicious spring
roll type things the restaurant called "The Dreaming Roll", or something
very similar to that).

"How do you cope with interviews in countries where they don't
speak English?"

"I've learned to say "Wonderful", "Fantastic", and "Marvelous"
in 37 different languages."
