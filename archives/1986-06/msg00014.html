Subjects: Depressing Music, KB question.

Re: Depressing music...

     While we are still on the subject of depressing songs (i.e. those that
make you feel like garbage), I thought I'd contribute a few of my 
favorites:

	-Song: When You Smile (off of _Days_of_Wine_and_Roses_)
	-Group: The Dream Syndicate
	-Remarks: boy, this one just makes me feel lousy.  The intro is a
		bit of distorted guitar into a dark sounding bass line. 
		Actually it's pretty hard to describe, so I'll just list 
		the lyrics to the chorus:

			When you smile,
			I don't know what to do,
			Cause I could lose everything,
			In a minute or two,
			And it seems like the end of the world,
			When you smile.

		Real cheery, huh?  Good one to play when your out with a
		new girl/boyfriend!

	-Song: The Pillow (off of _Geoffrey_Morgan_)
	-Group: UB40 
	-Remarks: this one has repetetive music that works well with the
		"basic" (read "simple") lyrics.  The song is about a
		prostitute lying on a white bed reflecting her life just
		before she slits her wrists as day breaks.  Makes you 
		feel a little better about your own life.

	-Song: intro to International (off of _Dazzle_Ships_)
	-Group: OMD (Orchestral Maneouvers in the Dark)
	-Remarks: not really a song, but rather a very dark introduction
		to an instrumental.  The intro is an actual broadcast 
		of a news announcer telling of a girl whose two hands had
		been cut off at the wrists by former Somoza guards.  The
		next line reads "The secretary general of the UN had this
		to say:" at which point the music starts.

     Now that we've discussed depressing music, I propose (and I hope this
doesn't start to big of a trend) another topic: the most sensual, arousing,
and erotic (though not necessarily explicit) songs you enjoy.  I stress that
I don't quite mean Prince saying "I sincerely want to f**k the taste right
out of your mouth" to music (note: those are actual lyrics), just music that
would be right for a nice sensual evening with a lover (especially music
that makes you want to spend a nice sensual evening with someone).  So how
'bout it?  List your favorites!


Re: The meaning of KB's Cloudbusting...

   Please don't flame me if this has already been asked (OK, flame me anyway),
but what exactly is KB singing about in Cloudbusting?  I've been wondering
for quite awhile, and it really sounds like she is singing about a girl 
whose had an incestous relationship with her father.  There are several 
lines that (I think) support my answer:  "Oh God Daddy, I won't forget.",
"...to be a threat to the men in power" [i.e. the Govt.'s taking him to
jail because of the relationship], "Your son' coming out" [no explanation
needed].  Please don't think me a demented person; I might be looking at 
this too simplistically.  However, others at my house (where the latest
album is played nearly incessantly) also agree.  I'd appreciate it if 
someone enlightens me to this matter.
