Echo &amp; the Bunnymen/the Church at the Aragon Brawlroom, Chicago:

Great show!! The Church played a tight, yet somewhat murky set.
I was pleased that they played some of their old stuff- " Is this where
you Live" was just too good. 

Bunnymen sounded totally clean for about an hour and a half, 4 encores.
Ian's voice was never better. Played a few too many songs off Ocean Rain.
Although, the highlight of the evening was when I yelled "play Thorn of
Crowns" and they did! Great version of "Do it Clean"--"I am the garbage
can man"..etc. Did the Doors' "Soul Kitchen" for an encore- Ian was very
much into it and almost sounded like Jim Morrison(not Exene). Also did
"Paint it Black". Light show was cool..and I usually don't like them.
During "Killing moon" they had a backdrop of lit stars, foggy blue lights.
Neato! The drummer was VERY powerful, the place was shakin' especially
during "Rescue", "Villiers Terrace"..Anyway, you get the picture.. it
was a great show.  Only bad thing was hen they mentioned "Pretty in Pink"
Arghhhhh! I wish that movie would go die somewhere.

As far as music for a sensual evening..gosh, I dunno...I go to Purdue
where people think you can get pregnant from holding hands...but
I prefer making my own rather than listening to someone elses.

Red Lorry/Yellow Lorry coming to Chicago, April 20th I think.
Kraut in Indy tonite(must miss it)
Siouxsie in Chicago(either Metro or the Vic) on either april 24th or
May 24th. Sounds pretty f.cked up to me.

Fly high and avoid the radar.....Terri
