First of all, despite the fact that I really hate these CD discussions
(maybe it's just 'cause I don't have one and I'm jealous), I thought
I would answer some questions about the availability of certain
disks.  JOY DIVISION's disks are indeed limited pressings; maybe I
should buy mine now in case I get a player!  CABARET VOLTAIRE's
"Crackdown" is on CD, as well as "Arm of the Lord."  COCTEAU TWINS
currently have the American disk, "Pink Opaque," out on CD, with
more to follow from 4AD.  (This year is gonna be a big one for 4AD
CDs, apparently, with Colourbox, Xymox and more on the way soon).
BAUHAUS's recently released compilation will be released as two
separate CDs with extra tracks.  LOVE AND ROCKETS' debut LP will
also be released.  There, now go buy them, you lucky people.

For my money, the best Cabaret Voltaire album is...none!  Now wait
a minute, I love the band, but I think they've yet to release a
"perfect" album.  I think their 12"s are generally much more
wonderful than the LP stuff, particularly their "James Brown" and
"Sensoria" 12"s, vastly different from the versions on "Micro
Phonies."  I think I'd recommend "Crackdown" to the novice CV
fan, as well as those 12"s.  And I'd play "Taxi Music" for anyone
who calls me when I'm on the radio and requests the Pet Shop
Boys' "West End Girls" or Falco's "Rock me Amadeus." :-)
Oh yes, the 12" of "I Want You" is another must buy; the version
on "The Arm of the Lord" is sadly truncated.  

Isn't Peter Gabriel taking a risk calling his album "Good"?  If
it's not, (forgive my heresy) can't you see all the headlines
saying "'Good' -- Bad?"  Rather like the suggestion of a friend
of mine to write a one-word review of the Cult's "Love" -- "Hate."

RED LORRY YELLOW LORRY live, 9:30 Club, last Saturday.
----------------------
Unfortunately, I arrived too late to catch more than 3 songs of
Stranger to Stranger, but what I heard was excellent.  One person
told me that the rest of it had sucked, another raved.  Then came
the Waiting.  I figured RLYL would take the stage at about 12:45,
and I was right.  They were WONDERFUL, playing everything from
"Paint Your Wagon" and one oldie, "Elevation."  You should have
seen the hostility in their eyes.  They're mad, and they're not
gonna take it any more, and they're gonna take it out on us.  What
a band this is for masochists who want to be glared at for the
length of the show.  I don't know what they're mad at, but the
furor seemed to add power to the music.  Amazing power.  Each
song was a short, jagged burst of energy.  

Everyone in the room was furious when they walked offstage after
a mere 30 minutes of playing (and you think the Jesus and Mary
Chain are bad!), and naturally there were loud cries and stomps
for an encore.  RLYL grudgingly did two separate ones, playing
amazing renditions of "Hollow Eyes," "Chance" and one I didn't
recognize.  Total -- 40 minutes of music and plenty of standing
around, running into friends and watching the weirdos at the
club (what were those two people doing there who looked to be
about 50 years old?).  Still, I'd do it all again tonight...
Should you go see them when they play *your* town?  By all means!

By the way, Depeche Mode's "Black Celebration" is wonderful,
the lyrics are actually semi-intelligent (it's Martin Gore's
vinyl adaptation of "1984" -- read your lyric sheet, especially
"Matter of Time" and "Stripped"), and the music is much more
interesting than usual.  Check out the Philip Glass homage on
Side 1.  *I* think it's their best, most consistent album yet,
but a lot of people disagree with me.  If your fave stuff by
DM is "Master and Servant," "People are People," etc., you may
not be wild about "Black Celebration."  But I am.  Already a
certain bet for my best-of-86 list.  

The Pet Shop Boys' "Please," on the other hand, is a disappointment.
Any agree/disagree?

Finished at last,
-Sue
