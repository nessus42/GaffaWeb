The dude I talked with in London saw the Saturday evening Comic Relief. I
guess Kate was comfortable enough after Friday to do something different.
Who knows. I'll try and have my friend tape the April 26 broadcast, but I
can't promise anything.

"Sid and Nancy: Love Kills" has come into more legal ties that will delay
the film's progress even more. Because no music clearances were obtained for
a promo film, John Lydon (who has recently come into possesion fo the legal
rights to the Sex Pistol's back catalogue) has more ammo to stop the film,
whic he hates with a vengeance.

{} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {}

Coming LP's: Cocteau Twins' "Victorialand", to be released April 14. Nine cuts,
and it plays at 45rpm. Riiight.

Later.
