I realize that this is going to be a frustrating comment for Kate lovers/
Madonna haters (esp. Doug). but ...

While I was entertaining several guests the other night (obviously people
with limited musical exposure) I put HoL on in my prefered order of
music on cassette.  Apparently, when I was out of the room a discussion
ensued which brought these people to the conclusion that ...

HoL is the newest ****MADONNA**** album. 

I didn't realize this until later in the night when someone asked me what
the name of the Madonna album I played was.  It took a long time for me
to figure out what they wanted to know, but I finally concluded that
HoL must have been what they were referring to.  I played a bit of the LP
for them, and, shure enough, they thought Kate was Madonna.

Now, my wife who likes commercial music, hates HoL, is neutral about
Madonna, and likes Tom Waits has agreed that when someone asks her who
Kate Bush is, she'll respond "Some synthesizer type who sounds a lot
like Madonna".

Personally, I don't see a lot of similarities but I am listening to the
*TEXTURE* most of the time.  But, this morning I heard a Madonna tune
and I agree, there is a vocal similarity with some of Kate's more
commercial stuff on HoL. (sigh).

About Starless and Bible Black .. I believe that there is a track
entitled Starless on the last 'real-Crimson' album 'RED'.  I also think
(but I might be mistaken) that Ian McDonnald (sp?) from the original
(Court Crimson King) lineup was featured on that track.  Furthermore,
hasn't the 'new' crimson also done a track called Starless and Bible Black
II or something on the second or third album.  Anyway, I just wanted to
point out there may be more than one Starless which was referred to.
All of which reflect different aspects of Fripp's musical personna.
