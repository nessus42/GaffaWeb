Re: net.music article on "Satanic" :-) influences in Waking the Witch

*SIGH* Once in a while some misinformed types pop up to bitch about
satanic messages in backward vocals. Since Doug has already posted 
a remarkably restrained reply and there was a good article in old
love-hounds archives on this, I won't rant and rave but here's a
semi-humorous thought I had:

People get upset about backwards satanic messages influencing 
poor innocent kids. If you read up a little on occult practices
of the past (I'm no expert on this), you'll find that often the
text used in a Black Mass is some BIBLICAL text SPOKEN BACKWARDS.
Using this logic :-), if speaking a text backwards reverses
its good/evil polarity :-) :-) :-), people should be HAPPY about
backwards satanic messages!! Hey, they're backwards, so they
must have good connotations!!!

&lt;Tongue placed firmly in cheek here&gt;

So what people should REALLY worry about is backwards religious
messages in music. Make sure your little brothers and sisters
are not buying good Christian music just to play them BACKWARDS
on their sophisticated speech-analysis equipment or K-mart tape
players. THEY MAY BE WARPED FOR LIFE!!! Better yet, buy them
stacks of Kate Bush, Robyn Hitchcock, Butthole Surfers, Sonic 
Youth, etc. etc., and make sure they only listen to the things
backwards. This way they'll grow up to be god-fearing, conservative,
conforming pillars of strength in their respective communities
(sly Tuxedomoon paraphrase there:-).

I was thinking of putting some backwards readings from the Koran (or Q'uran)
(in Arabic, of course) in the track I'm doing with Doug. Now
would that have been evil and subsersive because it's a religious
text played backwards, or subconscious evangelism to all you
backwards-Arabic speaking masses? What a dilemma...
Well, I'm glad I messed up and mixed in something different;
it's still in Arabic, but I can't tell if it's backwards or forwards,
and it's probably from the Koran.
