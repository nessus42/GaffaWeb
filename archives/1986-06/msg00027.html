Hi! You don't know us, but we've been watching you................
My name is Terri and he is Andy and that is we, and we are too lazy
and scared to send mail by ourselves. Maybe we will get over this soon.
But in the mean time bear with we.

We are stranded at the cultural void of Purdue and are eternally
grateful for this wonderful look into the real world where everything
is NOT John Cougar. Whoops forgot his last name.  Anyway, we are treated
like mifits here, but we have fun regardless. We learned of all this
through Bill, so everyone can give him credit for our survival.

About our music tastes; I'm a little bit country and he's a little bit
rock 'n roll, yes we are Osmond fans. Just kidding! I get into just about
anything: anything Bauhaus related, Hitchcock, Sonic Youth,....Ctwins,...
...Fall...even Kate Bush...Cure, Wayne Newton(just seeing if you are still
reading this), etc. etc..Bloodsport, Effigies, Xcleavers, Math Bats(great
band that my friend plays in), Love Tractor...and so on and so on..
As for Andy: he "listens to anything but Madonna, Huey Lewis, John Cougar
Hall and Oates(YUK), and Styx", prefers Zeppelin, Doors, REM, old Stones
Jesus and Mary Chain, Sonic Youth, Bunnymen, Church, DK...and so on and so on.

The only constructive thing we have to say is a small update on the
concert situation in the Midwestern Hell Hole:

Jesus and Mary Chain: Pronounced "Heh Zeus and Mary Jane Girls" here.
Cabaret Metro, Chicago...OK show, not a crowd pleaser band, also too
short(Beth fell asleep..she was pleased). Bloodsport opened..Pretty
good..crowd was pleased. Mr Ried dropped his guitar a few times, strummed
it even less, other Ried did not face audience. Was obviously fascinated
by the wood grain on his amplifier. We were in the balcony and they were
all higher than we were..

Husker Du: Pronounced "Hoosier Do" here. 
Sherwood, Indianapolis(and you may ask yourself "how did i get here?")
Math Bats opened, local band from Indy, friends of mine from Purdue.
They are definitely influenced by the Furs, Cure. Another local band,
Soul Asylum, opened. Another Husker Du-like band with a tinge of REM,
Doors. Husker Du only played about 35 min! What they playec was pretty
awesome until their voices gave out due to the cold and flu season.

Replacements: Pronounced correctly for a change by everyone
somewhere in Indy
Math Bats opened...I missed it but heard that both band 
were in fine form.

the Fall: also pronounced correctly
Century Hall, Milwaukee
Some f.cked metal band opened first and was laughed at.
Killdozer from Madison opened secondly, and was liked by all.
Couldn't believe such screechingly loud vocals could be produced by
such a scrawny lead singer. Sounded like Sonic Youth with a male Janis
Joplin doing vocals. The Fall was loud as hell and even inspired some
stupid bitch to do some pretty heavy duty aerobics. It was fun. Mike E.
was kind of scary(Andy didn't think so), but then again I had no sleep
before the show so my Mom would have scared me also. Andy's Mom does
scare him.

Echo &amp; the Bunnymen with the Church
Aragon Brawlroom, Chicago
Coming up wed 4/9
We're all excited!

I am sure we have bored you all enough by now, but we are so happy to be
doing this instead of doing EE.

Another note, I am graduating from this pit and moving to Providence, which
is like another planet to me. I have only lived in the Abyss and on the West
Coast. Help me!!!! If anyone can give me some info. on this area I will 
send them a Purdue post card with the golden girl on it. How can you resist?

None of the above concert garbage was in any order whatsoever.

We are having a giant party on Grand Prix Weekend, which is a stupid go-cart
race here, April 24th at Andy's. Screw the race...listen to tunes and drink
beer. You are all invited to experience life in an Abyss.

Will you all be our friends?

"You cannot justify any of this. It is like a giant stone tablet was
 dropped in your back yard..."

          -Professor Bass, Electrical Engineering at the Abyss

With all seriousness we enjoy this love-hounds thing.

   Bye for now.............Terri and Andy
