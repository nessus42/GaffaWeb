&gt;Really-from: Bill Hsu

&gt;The reviewer probably has the stereotyped view of Kate Bush being
&gt;an over-romantic songstress trying to write art music rather than the
&gt;multi-faceted and complex talent she is.

 I wouldn't worry about it, the reviewer (J.D. Considine) has had his
head up his ass for the last 10 years.  No correct that, he has had his
head up David Lee Roth's ass for the last 10 years.

&gt;Of course I don't mind Kate's occasional pretensions. Heck, it's fun
&gt;being pretentious...! :-)

Yeah, just look at me.  Or better yet, look at J.D. Considine.  

OK, Sue, before you start fuming ask J.D. why he and the rest of the
"established" music press ignored one of the best "new" groups of the
80's during a recent swing through town.  I'm talking of course about
7 SECONDS.  If J.D. is so interested in political music (as his recent
Musician article on the MIDNIGHT OINKS, er, OIL) indicated why did he
ignore this great force in Rock and Roll.  Been hangin' out with Dave
Marsh too much is my guess.  (Oh, by the way, Sue, I like reading your
articles in the City Paper but how come the Washington City Paper is so
much more "with it"?)

Bark,
Hofmann
