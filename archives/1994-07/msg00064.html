Last-modified: 1994/02/26
Version: 1.0.h minus 1.0.c

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action. You can get a full copy of the
FAQ by requesting it from me (uli@zoodle.robin.de). If you subscribe to
the list Bill Wisner will also provide you with the full FAQ.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.

0.   The Convention

     The Homeground staff is right now planning another Kate Convention in
     London. Right now it seems as if the date will be May 8 1994, but PLEASE
     DO NOT YET BUY PLANE TICKETS AND DO NOT YET RENT HOTEL ROOMS, since the
     date isn't confirmed yet and already has changed once. Further details
     will surely be availlable soon from Homeground.

     See you in London!

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

[Under the Pink is out now, so a little update was appropriate.]

     The purpose of the list is to discuss and disseminate information about
     Tori Amos and her music, and anything else that seems relevant. Due
     to the heavy load of discussion and members after the release of Tori's
     new album Under The Pink Anthony was forced to make the list digest-only,
     that is there is no bounce mail. A massive world tour is about to begin
     soon, and the next set of singles (Pretty Good Year in the UK) will be
     released any day now. Watch out for limited editions, since they ARE
     limited and the last one, Cornflake Girl, was quite fast sold out
     completely.

2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest

[I added this new mailing list since it seems to be relevant.]

     Sarah McLachlan - fumbling-towards-ecstasy

        subscribe: fumbling-towards-ecstasy-request@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
                   or just fte-request@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

                   or just fte@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

4.2. Basic Discography/Videography

[The Red Shoes is Kate's latest album, yes, but it's not any longer brand
new, so a small update was appropriate]

     Right now there is no information availlable whether there will be a third
     single for Kate's latest album The Red Shoes or not, and if then when.
     There's also still no release date for The Line, The Cross, And The Curve,
     the 50 minutes film that Kate has made. Right now four videos from The
     Red Shoes have appeared: two versions of Rubberband Girl ('UK' version
     with Kate in the dance studio, 'US' version with Kate wearing sunglasses),
     one for Eat The Music and one for Moments Of Pleasure. All of them except
     the US Rubberband Girl are from the film that features 6 videos in total.
     The US video for RbG features a few scenes from the film.

     A good short description of the film contents are the lyrics to the title
     song of The Red Shoes.

     Moments Of Pleasure is the first Kate Bush single that is NOT availlable
     on 7" vinyl (but there is a poster bag 12"). Guess this again marks the
     end of an era. (In the UK only four different formats will count as a
     single release for chart counting, and in this case there were two CDs,
     the 12" and the cassingle.)

[This has been added at the end of the basic discography and looks a bit
out of context here, but in the full FAQ it isn't.]

     There are also quite a lot of cover versions, most of them of Wuthering
     Heights, The Man With The Child In His Eyes or Running Up That Hill.

4.3. Printed books

[added]

     Moving -- A collection of poems (1993, issued on March 16)
        (Japanese title: KEITO BUSSHU SISHUU  MOVING)
        Shinko Music Publishing / ISBN4-401-61329-5 / 2,600 yen
        This Japanese book is in A5 size, has 256 pages, lyrics of 79 of Kate's
        songs with English original and Japanese translation, a discography
        up to the TWW box and a few photos (only the cover pic feat. Kate).
        It's said to be based on Kate Bush Complete. (thanks to Yamamoto Sozo)

5.6. Hounds of Love

[the paragraph about Nosferatu was added]

     Hello Earth:
        At the end of "Hello, Earth" the German words are: "Tiefer, tiefer,
        irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht" This means: "deeper, deeper,
        somewhere in the depth there is a light." They are not spoken by
        Kate, but by Gabi Zangerl, a friend of Kate.
        The choir part of this song was inspired by Werner Herzog's film
        Nosferatu that features a very similar chant. Neither Herzog's crew
        nor Kate nor anyone else has been able to find the real source of
        it. Some references go to east Europe, but even that isn't sure.

5.9. Miscellaneous

[an error was corrected]

     December Will Be Magic Again
        This is originally a single on its own, but has now been used in almost
        too many singles as a b-side (Experiment IV, Moments Of Pleasure (UK)),
        and is quite often used on Christmas samplers by EMI. One of these
        featured an alternate ('bongo') version of the song.

6.   The Archives

[Bill told me that uunet doesn't like uploads at the moment]

     There's also an incoming directory [which may not work].

6.1. Previous messages from love-hounds

[November is not any longer 'almost up to date', and there is an explanation]

     All previous messages from love-hounds can be ftped from the archives,
     residing in yearly directories under .../archives. Often the archives
     are a bit behind reality (last November right now), uunet often refuses
     uploads nowadays.
