I;ve just bought a copy of the December issue of Q (yes, I know its almost Marchbut thats what happens when you live on a tiny island at the ass end of the 
world) and I was very suprised at the way she felt about her earlier albums.
The interviewer asks:"Which of your old songs make you wince?"
To which Kate replys:"My God, loads. Absolutely loads. Either the lyrics not 
thought out properly [?] or its just crap [??] or the performances werent well
executed [?!?!?].
One of my favourite Kate songs is Oh England (a view shared by the reporter)
but Kate describes this song as making her "just want to die".
Many of you enjoy Kates earlier albums especially The Dreaming , understandably,however Kate does not share your point-of-view.
Of The Dreaming, Kate says "I look back at that record and it seems mad.I heard
it about three years ago and couldnt believe it.Theres a lot of anger in it".
Kate seems to feel that her earlier albums (TKI &amp; LH) dont work as albums 
because of Kates innocence and naivity as a writer at the time these albums
were produced.However I believe that it is exactly this youth and vitality
that gushes out of these albums that will forever keep them fresh and new
and will stop them becoming second-rate and old-hat.
Kate cannot use this excuse for the next two albums (NFE and TD) as even then 
she was becoming more the business woman in control of her career and less the
gigling school girl getting borne along on the tidal wave of her own success.
these albums show a great deal of courage and experimentation and the raw 
feelings that are expressed through these albums seems incredible compare to 
the drab, recycled cliches of todays pop music.However Kate herself seems 
somewhat embarrassed when it comes to this creative period of her life.
I have to ask myself why? Has she forgotten why she wrote these albums.
Has she forgotten the feelings and emotions which drove her to write these
powerful lyrics and create such wonderful imagery through her music.
I wonder does she REALLY feel uncomfortable about her earlier work or does
she think that she SHOULD feel uncomfortable about it in the light of todays
wishy-washy, un-confrontational music.
Although I love The RED SHOES it really just doesnt compare to Kates earlier
work and despite any reservations that Kate herself has about her recording
history, I would love to see her re-examine herself and get back to the
powerful emotional centre of her music and the real soul of Kate Bush.
                                                          Phil
