Here is a little something I made up during the height of TRS discussion, 
because it is not always easy to say why you like a Kate song, or how you
can describe one...


( The following is being provided in the hope that it will assist in the
  numerous Kate discussion/arguments, etc., present not only on 
  Gaffa/Love-Hounds, but throughout the globe wherever the enlightened
  reside and possible converts exist.)


	In order to assist in understanding the music of Kate Bush, there 
are several common elements which should be recognized.  They assist in 
analyzing and discussing the Wonderful music of Kate, providing common 
labels and units of measurement.  In addition they can also illuminate, 
providing direction in the classification of the music of Kate Bush.  
They are known as the Tenets of Kateness (ToK).  There are, however, so many
diverse attributes to Kate Bush's music that they should not be considered 
exclusive.  It is quite doubtful that any individual could fully enumerate 
them.  It is envisioned that this list will be continually amended to as
we continue enjoy the music of Kate Bush, be it the discovery of new music,
or the rediscovery of the existing music.

	The first 4 tenets enumerate the most common facts of Kate music.
Tenets 5 through 14 describe the numerous attributes of Kate Music, with 
examples included to illustrate.  Since many Kate songs combine various 
attributes they are listed more than once.  Again, by no means should the 
examples be regarded as exclusive.
