In the recent discussions about other female vocalists of note, I've been a
bit surprised to see no mention of Julia Fordham. Does anybody have any views,
either for or against? Does anybody know of any albums beyond the eponymous
one and "Porcelain"? 

Regarding Happy Rhodes, thanks for the overseas price information for ordering
her CD. Having been turned on to Jane Siberry thanks entirely to Vickie's
championship I'm keen to hear something of Happy. I shall be ordering the CD 
real soon now.

As far as Jane is concerned, I can sympathise with those who are less than
bowled over on their initial exposure to her music. When I first listened to
the copy of "Bound by the Beauty" I'd bought on the strength of Vickie's
endorsement I was very disappointed and couldn't understand what all the fuss
had been about. She sounded to me then rather like a second rate Joni
Mitchell. But after hearing the album half a dozen times over a couple of
months I found certain songs had wormed their way into my conciousness and I
was hooked. Now my only disappointment concerning Jane is that "Bound by the
Beauty" seems to be the only one of her albums to have been released over
here. Is that right?
