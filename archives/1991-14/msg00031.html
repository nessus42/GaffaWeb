&gt;&gt;...Prince has lined up several directors already for 
&gt;&gt;his next few videos, and among the names mentioned was...Kate Bush. 
&gt;&gt;&lt;jaw drops to floor with resounding ka-thunk!&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Er, was that your jaw, or Princes's jaw? :-)  I know you didn't mean to
&gt;come across that way, but the first thing I thought when I read that 
&gt;sentence was "S**t, the very thought of "Prince" coming anywhere near 
&gt;to "lining up" Kate.  HA!"  ...

Hee hee... well, actually, I was trying very carefully (and obviously
failing) to *not* comment on Prince and his music.  I have very mixed
feelings about P, loving some of his early stuff, hating a lot of his
later stuff, but finding bad stuff among the good and good stuff among
the bad... Aarrgghh!  All that's IMHO, of course.

What I was really a bit agog about was that Kate was directing *anyone*
else's video besides her own.  (I'm not aware of her having done so for
anyone else in the past; or did she direct one of the versions of Peter
Gabriel's "Don't Give Up"?  Some other videos?)

I hope the song she gets to direct is, indeed, one that she feels good
about.  I'm certainly looking forward to seeing it.  Though it couldn't
possibly match a work featuring her own music!;-)
