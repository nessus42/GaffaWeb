Larry Yaeger (welcome!-you'll liKe iT here) reported:

&gt;...Prince has lined up several directors already for 
&gt;his next few videos, and among the names mentioned was...Kate Bush. 
&gt;&lt;jaw drops to floor with resounding ka-thunk!&gt;

Er, was that your jaw, or Princes's jaw? :-)  I know you didn't mean to
come across that way, but the first thing I thought when I read that 
sentence was "S**t, the very thought of "Prince" coming anywhere near 
to "lining up" Kate.  HA!"  I don't remember if this had been reported
here yet.  Bob Davis (a radio dj) told me this last week; he said that 
it had been reported in an industry rag.  If I can get him to get that 
issue or make a copy, I'll post it.  I must admit to not having heard 
many of his songs, but I understand that Prince wrote that song that
Sinhead had a hit with, and it was the type of story that I'm sure Kate
could weave into a typically unforgettable visual experience.  She 
must have appreciated the song, and that speaks highly for Prince. 

There can be no question...
