Good to hear you liked the vids....my personal favorite on the
Whole Story would definitely be Experiment IV.  Though you can;t
beat the hilarity of some of the earlier vids on TWS.  I was on
the floor the first time I saw Babooshka.  Speaking of Babooshka
you might want to watch exactly WHAT she does with the bass in
her little dances with it....is it a bass or a metaphorical man??
Yes it is a little crampy on style BUT she Is an "old scarf."


All:

Well I was just lucky enough to catch a Lifetime (cable tv) show
about _Women_In_Rock. I frantically put in a tape hoping insanely
that they would say something about Kate.  Much to my chagrin they
didn't....oh well....but it was a pretty interesting piece none the
less.  Though they went with the more obvious artists...they did
have interviews with a few obscure artist like Exene Cervenka 
(ex. X)...and Tracy Ullman (????).  All in all though it didn't
mention the goddess it was pretty interesting, especially the bits
concerning the lack of good women writers, producers etc. (why
didn't they mention T&lt;ate??? - I kept yelling this at the t.v.)!!!
If you get a chance to watch this, I would give it a gander.

After putting a desperate plea into rec.music.misc asking about possible
tour dates, I was inundated with mail telling me about rec.music.gaffa...
(Thanks guys!)

So for the last few days I have been busy learning how much I don't know
about Kate and how my collection of tapes (I have all the albums...) which
I thought was extensive enough, is but a drop in the ocean of Kate's material
that is available.
I have *never* seen the bootlegs which everyone seems to have!!

At the moment I'm busy trying to read two or three weeks of back messages, so I
think I'll head off and do that...keep up the good work, I'm in awe!!

I don't know if this has been done before, but I thought it would be a kind 
of neet idea.  Here is a word find about Kate Bush.  In case you don't 
remember word finds from when you were little, you try to find words hidden 
in the puzzle, written horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; forwards or 
backwards.  This puzzle contains the titles to 25 songs Kate is in (ie, 
she's not necessarily the ONLY person singing in the song, nor is every song 
in this puzzle written by Her).  There are also a few bonus words and 
abbreviations.  To make this more fun (I hope?), I won't reveal the names of 
the 25 songs yet.  So, print this out and try it out, and tell me wot you 
think of it!

Suranyi):
&gt; In article &lt;1991Apr17.174249.7362@cbnews.cb.att.com&gt; you write:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In any case, the message was not on tape, it was written down by Jeff
&gt;&gt;as given to him over the phone by Kate herself.  The phone call was a
&gt;&gt;last minute response to _numerous_ unanswered registered letters.  If
&gt;&gt;they were going to commit fraud they wouldn't need to dub anything,
&gt;&gt;they could just make it all up.

Ok, at this point I have to sheepishly correct myself -- or rather
Jeff and my wife, Missy have corrected me -- the message itself came
recently via Novercia, the phone conversation was evidently back in
December.
 
&gt; All we need, to clear this up, is a complete transcript of the message
&gt; to the Ohio convention.  The reason Vickie is suspicious is that what
&gt; we've heard of this message so far sounds the same as the Winnepeg 
&gt; convention.  Some phrases are identical, in fact.  If we could get
&gt; a complete transcript we could easily decide.  If Vickie is wrong
&gt; I'm sure she will apologize.

The message will be in the upcoming issue of "Little Light."  Jeff
wants it to appear there first and I think that's reasonable.  In the
mean time, if anyone would care to post a copy of the Winnepeg message
I can tell you whether it sounds at all similar to what I rememeber
from the Cleveland show.  Or perhaps I'll use my wife's memory just to
be safe.  I'm not sure why anyone would expect the messages _not_ to 
have a lot in common considering the similarity of the occaisions.  

&gt; Have you read the spring issue of _Little Light_?  While it's true
&gt; that they have some legitimate complaints, they cover it up with
&gt; tons of garbage of their own.  To summarize:

Yes, I have.  I'm glad you recognize that they have some legitimate
complaints.  Hopefully my next message will be able to clear up some
of the 'garbage'.

&gt;   Could use some help/suggestions on a touchy situation. 
&gt; 
&gt;   My new husband is not a KaTe fan yet, altho I plan on working on
&gt; converting him. Any suggestions on particular songs/albums/whatever
&gt; to start with? I've been thinking of some of the "milder" stuff off of
&gt; Hounds of Love and The Sensual World. For instance, "Hounds of Love",
&gt; "Cloudbusting", "The Morning Fog", "Love and Anger", etc.

I've never had to _try_ to convert Missy to anything (right Missy? :-).
Either she naturally picks up on it (Kate) or she just doesn't like it
(Caterwaul).  If I were going to try I'd probably program the CD
player to play just the tracks that seem like the sort of thing she
likes.  In the case of Caterwaul Missy doesn't care for the vocals so
I'd end up playing about one song on each CD.   

Maybe if you tell us what artists your husband does like folks here
who like similar stuff can let you know what Kate stuff appeals to
them.  If this involves Elvis you could have a problem. :-)

I feel the same way. Ok, so The Ninth Wave suite is wonderful, but when

In article &lt;1991Apr17.174249.7362@cbnews.cb.att.com&gt; you write:
&gt;From article &lt;9104171426.AA00211@chem.nwu.edu&gt;, by stern@CHEM.NWU.EDU (Charlot
te Stern):
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The latest from our incommunicado love-hound in Chicago, Vickie, is
&gt;&gt; that she and Chris suspect that Kate's message at the Ohio con was a 
&gt;&gt; dub of her message at the Canadian BreakThrough con several years back.
&gt;
&gt;Very nice.  Basically Chris &amp; Vickie are saying that they believe the 
&gt;folks at AAHP and _Little Light_ or perhaps more specifically Bill 
&gt;Barwick and Jeff Medkeff are frauds and liars.  What, pray tell, are 
&gt;they basing the this slur on?  
&gt;
&gt;In any case, the message was not on tape, it was written down by Jeff
&gt;as given to him over the phone by Kate herself.  The phone call was a
&gt;last minute response to _numerous_ unanswered registered letters.  If
&gt;they were going to commit fraud they wouldn't need to dub anything,
&gt;they could just make it all up.

All we need, to clear this up, is a complete transcript of the message
to the Ohio convention.  The reason Vickie is suspicious is that what
we've heard of this message so far sounds the same as the Winnepeg 
convention.  Some phrases are identical, in fact.  If we could get
a complete transcript we could easily decide.  If Vickie is wrong
I'm sure she will apologize.

&gt;Jeff told me this himself and I see no reason not to believe him.
&gt;Do C&amp;V have any reason not to believe it other than their irritation 
&gt;with Jeff and company for calling out "Homeground" on some of their 
&gt;nonsense?  
&gt;"Don't drive too slowly."                 Richard Caldwell

Have you read the spring issue of _Little Light_?  While it's true
that they have some legitimate complaints, they cover it up with
tons of garbage of their own.  To summarize:

1)  They complain that Homeground is hypocritical for not mentioning
the BBC "banning" of "Army Dreamers" during the war.  I pointed out
that there hasn't been an issue of Homeground published since
the war started, so this criticism is ridiculous.

Subject: Wow

Wow.  I just got some more of Ken Saint Johns pictures.  The first disk and a
half are 14 pictures from the Box set booklet (the larger ones, some of the
smaller ones are really to small to digitize).  The third disk is all the
photos from cathy, about 4 or more per page.  They are rather small but of
good quality.   
I should be able to post these when I post the disk versions of cloudbusting
in hopefully less than two months.  These will probably be already available
by then.   
        I myself am working on a cathy project.  I have all the photos scanned
in on 640x480 16 grey scale photos with the FULL picture taking up the left of
the picture.  I have not given them out yet as I have to clean em up a little
more (like removing my finger holding em down!) and also I intend to add the
text from the book to the RIGHT of the photos.  It should fit just perfectly. 
I am having some problems doing this as I am trying to add black text to a
white background which doesn't look so good on a interlaced amiga screen, so I
will have to find a combo with less contrast.  
        I have also discovered that I am pretty terrible typist, when simply
typing in something off a book. If anybody has "cathy" add wouldn't mind
typing it in (its really not so long) let me know and then it could benifit
Ken's project, my project, and could be posted for anybody with archives
access to read.  Its not in print anymore so this should be helpful to those
of us who don't have the book (I borrowed it!). 
        Also I MAY be asking for voluteers to type in anything that isn't
already in The Garden that I might need.  I am not totally sure if there is
something as I don't have one of the garden files yet, but there may be.  
 
        MAC users: GOOD NEWS!  It looks like I may be getting the full
development system for HYPERCARD 2.0.  It was offered to me today, and I
should get it in less than a month.  The people who offered it now owe me a
favor so I am pretty sure I will get it (funney how that worked out :-). They
also told me about a good book on it so I should be able to get that and do
it.  THey are giving it to me in Amiga AMAX Mac emulator format so I will be
able to run it on my system.  Its on SEVEN disks so it may be clumsey to work
with but what the heck.  If you don't have Hypercard 2.0, you may want to get
it.:-) 
 
        I have heard that some of my messages REPEAT lately again.  This
shouldn't be on the ones I send directly to the net, like this one.  If
anybody sees more than one copy of THIS MESSAGE, please let me know.  
 
        I am still not sure if all my private messages get through, so if you
have sent me a message lately and haven't got a response, let me know.  I
usually reply right away so.....  

        Well I off to the mountains for a day or two so talk to you later.

Subject: Re The Whole Story Video


judi says:
&gt; Thanks for being so patient, understand, and helpful with this "greenie"
&gt; love-hound.....

thank *you* for your great posts!  some thoughts on the videos:

WH: i'll grant that the effects look kinda tacky to our MTV-jaded eyes,
but there is a sorta teenage Romantic vision that i find charming.
(no condescension intended;  if KaTe was self-conscious about her
dancing -- or singing -- the video and the song would be awkward
instead of wonderful...)

TMwtCihE:  this video (and the Saturday Night Live performance) disturb
me.  By itself, the song is as innocent as _WH_, but the skin tight
(and skin color) suit, along with KaTe's sensual movements (and possible
drug reference on SNL) present a very different mood.

BREATHING:  i have no literal reading for the "emerging from the water"
bit, but it does echo the birth imagery (cf baptism), and the odd colors
underscore the general theme of pollution...  "Truly BRAVE woman," indeed.

WOW:  am i alone in liking the Singles File video?  i recall someone
complaining about the dress -- but given that this song is slightly
self-mocking, the return to flowing Romanticism is appropriate.
on the flip side, the live performance is great.  if i wasn't used
to being patient with KaTe, i'd be awfully anxious about this up-
coming tour.  she *is* going to go through with it, right?  right?!?!

RUTH:  devastating.  my favorite video, from anyone. it incorporates
dance, music, and striking visual imagery, in a fashion unique to
the video/film medium.  a perfect foil to the "realistic" but equally
wonderful CLOUDBUSTING...

ARMY DREAMERS:  judi finds this a bit "campy".  i see her point, but i
love the irony between the gentle waltz, slow-mo explosion (wee, there
goes KaTe!), and biting lyrics.  dream-like, and certainly original.

THE DREAMING:  "Also- where can I get an outfit like KaTe's..."
apparently, these Dune/'stillsuit' outfits came off a rack at some
store or wardrobe.  i've seen the identical outfit in british science-
fiction shows, though i can't remember exactly where...

BABOOSHKA:  "Again- Man, that chainmail outfit!"  so, anyone have an
explaination for this outfit.  i recall KaTe mentioning that she sometimes
has to have a drink or three before singing something out-there (like
_Waking the Witch_) -- i have this image of a tipsy KaTe being convinced
to wear the chainmail bikini instead of the demure robes she had picked
out...

THE BIG SKY:  as a big production number, i prefer this by far to 
_Love and Anger_.  fits the song perfectly, IMHO;  an explosion of 
giddyness.

judi, just wait 'til you see the Live at Hammersmith video!  *sigh*

footah!

&gt;tended to get a bit confused as to who was who as I didn't know what it
&gt;was about!

   Judi!  How could you say this!  HoL is my favorite video!  The first time I
saw this I didn't know what to expect (since the song has no real story line)
but as I watched the video it was so beautiful I felt like I was going to
cry.  I don't think that it does make a lot of sense as a story line; it's
just more a collection of images that represent the emotions and desires that
KaTe is singing about.
   I like this video so much that now HoL is one of my favorite KaTe songs.
Every time I hear the song I'm reminded of the video and I just love it.

&gt;&gt;   1.  I just got the current Live at the Hammersmith video and
it
&gt;&gt;seems  to me that either a) the dance routine for Hammer Horror
was shot
&gt;&gt;later  or  b) a tape was played for KaTe's vocals.  Can  anyone
tell me which
&gt;&gt;is  the  case?    I don't hear any applause at the end  of  the
song, but i'm not
&gt;&gt;sure  that  the video version of the song exactly  matches  the
Lionheart version
&gt;&gt;either.   Was the actual stage routine for "Hammer Horror" like
the video?
&gt;&gt;At any rate, it had to be a spectacular show.

&gt;The  dance  routine was live and the music/vocals were from  the
album.

As  mentioned  elsewhere, this is NOT correct.  The  music/vocals
were
re-recorded.

In a television documentary about the Tour of Life, Kate is shown
having a
discussion  during  the planning phase of the tour  with  another
person and the
point  is  being  made that any of the recorded portions  of  the
concert would
have  to  be re-recorded by the band to prevent hassles with  the
musician
union.

At  any  rate, I doubt that Kate would have used the album  music
even if she
could. She also stated in this program that her intention for the
tour was
to  make the music "better" than what was on the albums, and that
the
live arrangements had more "punch" to them.

I  don't remember the name of this documentary off hand - IED (Hi
Andy!) or
someone else can probably fill in the details.

I guess that I should have said that the dancing in Hammer Horror was live
and the music/vocal was prerecorded (not off the album)

something like this:

not knowing what on earth there was to know,

Subject: Re: PMRC/Little Light/Homeground inanity (LONG)


&gt; From: ed@DAS.LLNL.GOV (Edward J. Suranyi)
&gt; 
&gt; I just received my first issue of _Little Light_, the new American
&gt; fanzine put out by The American Association of Them Heavy People.  It's
&gt; their third issue:  Spring 1991.  And boy, was I shocked!
&gt; 
&gt; Do you remember Chris's joke posting about the PMRC's list of Kate's
&gt; songs and how filled they were with obscene imagery?  

I'm sure you know this but just to keep things clear for those just 
arriving I'll point out that there was never any "PMRC list of Kate's
songs" beyond the one Chris posted as a joke.   I'm not even sure that 
Chris originally associated it with the PMRC.  Unfortunately I can't
seem to locate it in the archives so I'm not sure.  (Pointers to the
appropriate file would be appreciated.)

&gt; PDFM) told Vickie that a previously unknown American fanzine took it
&gt; seriously, so they wrote to the PMRC.   Well, _Little Light_ is that
&gt; fanzine.  In the new issue, they are really angry about having not
&gt; gotten the joke!

Actually the thing they're unhappy about this issue is Homeground's
backhanded dismissal of the whole issue in HG #40.  A simple correction
without a repetition of the same sort of accusations that people
took exception to in the first place could have laid the whole thing 
to rest.

&gt; In fact, out of the 20 page fanzine, six-and-a-half pages deal with
&gt; this issue!  The very first letter is from a person named David Bricker,
&gt; Attorney-At-Law, who says:

[details of PMRC's potential legal recourse]

But note that this was a letter and not an editorial.  I'm sure many
folks can tell you the lawyers are apt to write such letters without 
much provocation.

&gt; The editors of the fanzine publish PDFM's letter to the PMRC in full,
&gt; as well as his reply article in _Homeground_ #40.  However, in the
&gt; latter, they put several (sic)s in for no reason that I can gather.

If HG had extended the same courtesy to the PMRC the whole issue could
have been dropped.  The 'sics' in the article were for the most part 
associated with errors that appear in Homeground #40 (I checked
HG #40 and I can list them if you like, they're pretty trivial but 
they're clearly errors).  Unfortunately an over-zealous editor evidently 
corrected these errors in the text of "Little Light" article,
rendering the meaning of the 'sic' unclear.

&gt; They make fun of his British spelling "Centre" in the PMRC's name.

No they didn't.  They did place a 'sic' after the "Centre" but the
"(sic: We're British and we spell it the British way!)" remark was 
_exactly_ as it appeared in HG #40.  Should we consider this to have 
been HG making fun of the American spelling? 
 
&gt; After that, they have an article called "Cen-sor-ship Defined",
&gt; in which they describe the history of the PMRC and the stickering
&gt; campaign.  Some of it isn't too bad, but there are several stupidities
&gt; in this article.

I'd be interested to hear what you think are the stupidities in the 
article.  I thought it did very good job of laying out the censorship 
fights that have occurred over the last five years and how more than 
anything they show that the system works.  It seems well researched so
I'd be interested to hear about any errors you think it may contain.
I think you'll have to admit that this sort of in depth treatment is 
far better than the repeated yammering about the imminent collapse of 
American freedom that HG has been engaging in.
 
&gt; I was boiling mad by this time, so I sat down and wrote a letter,

[ the following are excerpts from the letter...]

&gt;      First of all, I'd like to explain the true history of this matter.
&gt; You quote Peter Fitzgerald-Morris's reply article in Homeground #40.
&gt; After making a slur about their British spelling (how on Earth can they 
&gt; help but spell words the way they were taught in school?), you quote 
&gt; him: "The document actually originated in the US computer network
&gt; "Love-Hounds" (sic) . . ."  What's wrong with this, for heaven's sake?
&gt; This is in fact what the computer mailing list is called.

In HG #40 it's 'Love-Hounds", with mismatched quotations.  It is, of
course, LL's fault that the typo was corrected as well as a 'sic' added
but it wasn't their intention to be snide.  As I pointed out before, the
editors of LL said nothing about the British spelling, that was in HG.

&gt;      A person who shall remain nameless here posted the original message
&gt; to love-hounds about a year and a half ago.  It was quite clearly meant
&gt; to be taken as a joke -- hundreds of people saw it on the computer net
&gt; and nobody complained.  

I don't think this is correct.  I seem to recall one or more persons
on the net flaming this post.  Again, I can't find any of this in the
archives but I'd be interested in checking.  

&gt; Unfortunately,
&gt; they left off the signature which subtly hinted that the message was
&gt; a joke.  Even so, it's hard to believe anyone would take it seriously.

As LL pointed out, they weren't the only ones.  The fanzine "Still 
Breathing" evidently misunderstood it as well.

&gt; In Jeff and Bill's [they are the editors -- Ed] welcome letter, they say
&gt; that Little Light was the "first [newsletter] (anywhere) to report the
&gt; news of Kate's long-awaited second tour."   Well, love-hounds reported
&gt; this two days after she made the announcement at the convention.)

Are you saying that their claim is incorrect?  I hardly think Love-Hounds
can be considered a 'newsletter' for this purpose.  If you want to include 
electronic communications media we lost out to the phone by just under two 
days.

&gt;      To go on, in "Cen-sor-ship Defined" you say that the fact that "Army
&gt; Dreamers" has been removed from BBC playlists during the war shows-up
&gt; "Homeground's essential hypocrisy of going after Americans while ignoring
&gt; their own, government sponsored 'censorship'."  For heaven's sake, the
&gt; last issue of Homeground came out in December, and the war started in
&gt; January.  In other words, there hasn't been an issue of Homeground
&gt; published since that action of the BBC!  How could there possibly be
&gt; a comment about it?

Here I agree with you, the BBC playlist question isn't really
pertinent until after HG have had a chance to comment on it.  It will
be interesting to see what HG has to say about it.   I'd also be 
interested to know if there are any real examples of British censorship 
fights that have been ignored by HG while they continue to harp on 
American issues.

&gt;      In the same article, you say "Homeground is spreading the persistent
&gt; rumor that MTV wouldn't play "Running Up That Hill" in its original form,"
&gt; and you contradict them.  Well, I'd sure be happy if you were right, but
&gt; you're the first person I've ever heard say this.  I know they showed 

Later you add...

|      Well, I have a correction to make.  All my sources tell me that
| the real video *was* played on MTV -- exactly once, on August 20, 1986.
| This was because the video had been nominated for an MTV award, as you
| correctly stated, so they had to show it once.  This showing was
| advertised in Billboard in a full-page ad as a "special screening".

In HG #40 in the "Five Years Ago" section PDFM says...

 "...the video was soon a hit of its own in all the territories where
 the single was gaining airplay.  Except one.  In the US the cable
 channel MTV refused to use Kate and Michael.  You can pick the reason
 from the following list of possibilities: (1) it was too erotic (2)
 Kate doesn't lip-sync.  It was of course merely a coincidence that the
 campaign against the sexually explicit nature of (some) rock music led
 by the PMRC was first having it's impact on timid programmers at this
 time."

HG has been repeating this same story for five years when it's
easily shown as false.  Whether it was played one time or every
fourth play as LL claims, MTV did show the video.  This continued
implication that MTV's "timid programmers" didn't show the original
version of the video because of pressure from the PMRC is pretty silly
when you consider that not only did MTV show the video, they actually 
showcased it and nominated it for an award.

It's about time that HG either showed some proof of this allegation 
(beyond rumors spawned by their own innuendo) or dropped it for the 
baseless speculation that it is.

&gt;      Look, I agree that PDFM's comments about the PMRC do not reflect
&gt; complete understanding of the situation.  In fact, I wrote to him about
&gt; the similar comments he made about the k. d. lang controversy.

I'm not particularly worked up about this and when I talked to Jeff
about it it was clear that he's not pulling his hair out over it, either.

However, the fact is that HG was patently unfair to the PMRC by placing
their name on this joke document.  As a "parody of attitudes displayed
in the current rock music censorship battle" it was just fine.  
Unfortunately, the parody falls flat when you attribute it to a specific 
organization that makes it a policy not to engage in the sort of 
judgements that were being made light of.

Again, a simple retraction or even an honest airing of the PMRC's
position could have laid the whole thing to rest and would have left
HG readers better informed, as well.  Instead HG chose to question 
the sincerity of the PMRC's response, saying in effect that it was for 
only for public consumption and implied that the PMRC was somehow 
responsible for the state stickering laws that they were actually lobbying 
against.

It is telling to note that throughout this LL has given a full airing
of the views and issues on both sides while HG has failed to even reveal
the name of the  newsletter in question (LL).

All that said, I hope that LL will not dwell further on the issue
(except perhaps for printing letters and making any necessary
corrections).

We of the Parents Music Resource Center have recently had the music of one,
"Kate Bush", brought to our attention. Previously we have looked at the
"music" of such groups as "Ratt", "Twisted Sister" and "Mr. Frank Zappa".
This latest menace to the youth of America from a foreign land is more
pernicious than all the rest. The following is a list of Miss Bush's song
lyrics that we believe need warning labels:


All We Ever Look For: Explicit references to breasts, wombs, tombs and drugs.
All the Love: Death.
And Dream of Sheep: Drugs, specifically poppies - the source of opium.
Army Dreamers: Death.
Babooshka: Infidelity.
The Big Sky: Sacrilege.
Blow Away: Death and sacrilege; the very _thought_ that Keith Moon and Sid
              Vicious could be let into Heaven!
Breathing: Anti-Nuclear propaganda.
Burning Bridge: Arson.
Cloudbusting: Quackery.
Coffee Homeground: Poisoning.
December Will Be Magic Again: Glorifying a known homosexual (Oscar Wilde).
Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake: Suicide.
The Dreaming: Alcoholism.
Egypt: References to demons and possible references to the female sexual
          organs.
The Empty Bullring: Death and mutilation. Sacrilege.
Experiment IV: A sound that can kill; the avowed goal of every Heavy Metal     
           band.
Feel It: A dirty, dirty song.
Get Out Of My House: "Devil Dreams", Human transmogrification into animals.
Hammer Horror: Occultism.
Heads We're Dancing: "They say the Devil is a charming man.." It isn't even
        _backwards_! Appalling!
Houdini: Occultism, French Kissing, Sacrilege.
Hounds Of Love: Bestiality?
The Infant Kiss: Definite Pedophilia. This song is beyond redemption.
In The Warm Room: Another dirty song, this one about prostitution.
James And The Cold Gun: Gunplay. Alcohol. Gambling. Sex.
Kashka From Baghdad: Homosexuality and voyeurism.
The Kick Inside: Incest, suicide and Godless mythology.
Kite: Demonic entities; vis. "Beelzebub".
L'amour Looks Something Like You: Sex, sex and more sex. "...that feeling
        of sticky love inside".
Leave It Open: Burglary, Satanic backwards messages.
The Man With the Child in His Eyes: Possible pedophilia.
Mother Stands For Comfort: Murderers.
Night Of The Swallow: Criminal activities.
Ne T'en Fui Pas: We don't know French, but it _sounds_ dirty.
Not This Time: Profanity (we think...)
Oh England My Lionheart: Death, Kidnapping, Sacrilege.
Pull Out The Pin: Violence and drugs (Hashish).
Ran-Tan Waltz: Alcohol, infidelity and a slang reference to the male organ.
Rocket's Tail (For Rocket): We couldn't figure this one out, but we don't
              think we'd like it if we could.
Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God): Sacrilege, plain and simple. God
              does not make _deals_!
Sat In Your Lap: "Some say that Heaven is hell..." Hum-m-pfh!
Saxophone Song: Reference to bowels.
The Sensual World: This song is beyond redemption. Based on a pornographic
        novel by James Joyce.
Strange henomena: Menstruatioen, occultism.
Symphony In Blue: Death and sex; need we say more.
Them Heavy People: Yet more sacrilege.
There Goes A Tenner: Criminal activity.
Violin: Yet more satanic references.
Waking The Witch: Where to begin?
Warm And Soothing: Alcohol.
Watching You Without Me: Occultism.
The Wedding List: Murder and revenge.
Wow: Homosexuality.
Wuthering Heights: Occultism.

  Please help us protect the morals of the youth of this God-fearing country.
Almost as shocking are the covers of her records. We would say more about
them but we are having trouble getting them back from our examiner.

&gt;Are you saying that their claim is incorrect?  I hardly think Love-Hounds
&gt;can be considered a 'newsletter' for this purpose.

Think of Love-Hounds as an electronic newsletter that publishes daily
and has very lenient editorial standards.

  Sorry to everyone who got the impression I didn't like the Hounds of
Love video. Let me correct myself- I like the video just fine. I just
don't understand it very much. Bill said he liked it as a string of very
fine images rather than as a tight story. In view of that explanation, the
video is much more enjoyable.

Also- I got quite a few private e-mail replies in response to my crack about
KaTe's chain mail in the Babooshka video. Rather than trying to respond
privately to those, which would take a while, let me say this: I'm 5'5",
red-brown hair like KaTe's, hazel eyes like KaTe's, lips not quite as full
as KaTe's, small nose like KaTe's, pale skin like KaTe's, etc. BUT! I'm
too skinny and nowhere near as well-endowed as KaTe! So.... I'll keep on
dreaming.... (actually, I DO own a brass chain-mail halter, but don't dare
wear it in public...)

&gt;&gt;At any rate, it had to be a spectacular show.       
&gt;
&gt;The dance routine was live and the music/vocals were from the album.

If you're referring to the Hammersmith show, you're wrong.  The music/vocals
were specially re-recorded with her live band so as to avoid Musicians
Union hassles.  Somebody already said something like this...

&gt;I have only seen a very short clip of the Hammer Horror video, which appeared
&gt;to be the same as the Hammersmith routine.

They're similar, but not identical.  The Hammer Horror video features a

Well it looks like I may have bagged my first Kate fan.  I went over to a new
friend's house in the mountains and I brought him a tape of Hounds or Love
backed with the Whole Story and a couple of songs from the Sensual World.  I
was over there about 8 hours and we seemed to spend the greatest amount of
that time talking about Kate-related subjects, like me explaining what the
songs were about and the like, and he was very interested, asking questions
and everything.  It also ends up that he used to know the people who are
giving me the physical therapy right now, and also that he used to be a fairly
serious W. Reich student, having read much of his stuff AFTER he started
getting into the unusual ideas later in his career, and he was quite
knoledgeable about the legal trouble he got himself into.  He also had the
idea (and he said it was only an idea) that he may have had alziemers dease
(before they called it that of course) due to the general sloppyness of his
later research, or at least that he might have had some sort of problem.  All
in all an interesting day!

In the May Issue of VOX magazine there is part eight of the VOX Encyclopaedia
of Rock,this includes Kate under the b section.This is what they say word
for word about her:
  KATE BUSH
Precocious teenage singer/songwriter/pianist who shot to fame in 1978 when her
first single,'Wuthering Heights' topped the charts in Britain,Australia and
elsewhere.Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour had shown an early interest,and
encouraged EMI to sign her as a schoolgirl to give her time to mature before
recording.
Her debut Number 3 album The Kick Inside contained another hit,'The Man With
The Child In His Eyes'.Lionheart late in 1978 made Number 6 and included 'Wow',
a Number 14 single untypical in its weakness as a song but provoking as ever a
showcase for her remarkable high-pitched voice.
Her shows involved elements of mime and ballet,but tours became fewer and
farther between:her only live recording remains an EP,'On Stage'(1979).Never
Forever in 1980 entered the LP chart at Number 1:the peak of her fame.It
included the far-sighted 'green' single 'Breathing' and the Number 5 'Babooshka
'
The Dreaming in 1982 was her first self-production and the only Top Three LP
that year by a British female singer in a chart full of Duran Duran and Culture
Club:concerned with Australia's Aborigine culture,it included Rolf Harris on
didgeridoo!Hounds Of Love topped the chart two years later(including the Number
3 single 'Running Up That Hill') and was her first US Top Thirty LP.The Whole
Story compilation gave her a third  UK Number 1 LP in 1986:it included a versio
n
of 'Wuthering Heights' with a new vocal.
Bush collaborated occasionally with Peter Gabriel on his albums,as well as
demonstrating a sense of humour in Charity and Comic Relief appearances.She
described her most recent album,The Sensual World(1989),as 'an expression of
positive female energy':it was inspired like 'Wuthering Heights' by literature
(James Joyce's Ulysses) and encompassed even more exotic and ethnic elements
than usual including Bulgarian vocalists Trio Bulgarka.The title track was a
hit single,but the album was blocked from the chart summit by Phil Collins.This
Woman's Work a box set issued in 1990,included all her recordings and was
highly acclaimed.
Kate Bush's all-round talents are likely to keep her visible for the forseeable
future-but she remains determined to do it at her own speed.




Well there you go!!
Incidentally Trio Bulgarka's vocals are being used on a Make-up advert in the
UK at the moment.

Hi all,

After finally getting to read the PMRC post that has been debated
recently (thanks Jeff), I would have to say that anyone taking it
seriously needs to relax a bit.  Although I don't (in general) agree
with anything the PMRC says or does, I will give them enough credit
to say that at least they TRY to sound logical.  Of course, they're
usually not, but this letter was clearly satirical, and Little Light
should have realized that.

Just my $.02.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I sent it in through a friend's account to cover my trail. Most folks
on .gaffa responded in the manner intended; i.e. amusement. A couple of
well-meaning, but credulous love-hounds responded with concern that our
beloved would be the target of a witch-hunt by senator's wives. I confessed
to reassure these people that it was, in fact, a joke.

    Apparently the joke spread far further than the confession. Love-hounds
who found it funny printed it out and sent it to other people, including
the Home-Ground gang, who printed it a couple of issues ago. Some severely
humor-impaired people in Ohio read this and took it upon themselves to
_write_ the PMRC to protest the non-existent witch-hunt. The PMRC wrote
Home-Ground to state that they had nothing against Kate Bush. HG published
a disclaimer the next issue defining the word "parody" for those unfamiliar
with the concept.

    I would presume that the story ended there, except that Ed tells us
that the Ohio crew is the same bunch who put on the recent convention and
is publishing this new fanzine. In their most recent issue they
start squeaking about lawsuits and insulting the fine folks at HomeGround,
apparently in a tizzy about being made fools of due to to the Tipper piece
and their over-reaction to it. Oh God. It sounds like the same sort of
socially retarded behavior infesting Science Fiction Fandom (see Dameon
Knight's "The Futurians") has leeked over into the Kate-speaking world.

&gt;  Well, I picked up my copy of The Sensual World Videos, and have watched it
&gt; about 6 times now. Just wanted to share what I thought/felt about them, and
&gt; am curious to know if anyone else agrees/disagrees with me.
&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;
&gt;  Anyway- while I greatly enjoyed the video for "Love and Anger", as of yet
&gt; I don't find anything truly outstanding about it. Am I missing something?
&gt; I couldn't find any real relationship between the dancers and what I
&gt; perceive the meaning of the song to be. The scepter was a nice touch,
&gt; tho- made "The Great Goddess KaTe" appear very regal, even in the simple 
&gt; black jumpsuit.
&gt; Also, while I greatly enjoyed the appearance by Dave Gilmour (another 
&gt; favorite of mine- coincidence?), I found the scenes of KaTe dancing before &gt; 
the band to be missing something. Don't get me wrong- the woman has a very &gt; se
nsual power when she moves. It's just that this video didn't really 
&gt; connect for me. If I'm missing something obvious (or even not-so-obvious), &gt; 
somebody please clue me in!

    Last year Vickie and I came up with a theory. Here's what we posted...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This should stir'em up some. Here is our interpretation of the Video for 
"Love And Anger". Just the video.

The parts in {}'s are from Chris. The Parts in []'s are from Vickie.

Video starts with a:
BLURRY SHOT
    {Not much meaning here. Just a blurry shot of the skirts of the Sufis.}

Next Kate is:
IN THE SPOTLIGHT
     {This is it. The record that's going to "break her" in America. All
eyes are upon her.}  

In her hands are:
JEWELRY
     {Could it be a rosary? She is on her knees, is she praying? For what?}
 
She is:
SHOWERED WITH GOLD
    {As she will be, metaphoricaly, if she succeeds in America, the last
holdout in the "civilized" world. We feel this video is the direct result
of a conversation with CBS record executives.}

She drops her:
JEWELERY
    [Possibly "pearls before swine"?]

She spins with her:
HEAD DOWN, ARMS OUTSTRETCHED
   ["Here I am, do what you will"]

She is handed the:
CROWN JEWELS
    {Not all the crown jewels, just the Orb and Septre, but definitely
the British Crown Jewels, symbolic of her Britishness.} 

In come the:
BALLET DANCERS
     {The Ballet Dancers may represent what CBS thinks of her recent videos,
serious and hoity-toity. They may have told her to "loosen up" and stop
taking herself so seriously.}

And she:
STANDS THERE
   {As everyone knows, in American rock videos, she singer just stands
there while dancers rush around, trying desperatly to create the illusion
that the singer is dancing, as in videos by Kim Karnes, Rod Stewart, Elton
John and others. God forbid that the singer actually try to dance, as in
Sting's "We'll Be Together". Kate, as we all know, can dance very well,
but she tried that with "Running Up That Hill" and that video was bumped
in favor of a TV show in which she was safely behind a podium.} 

Then the ballet dancers:
FADE AWAY

Then Sufi Dancers or:
WHIRLING DEVERISHS 
     {Don't you just love them. I do.} [ditto]

The ballet dancers come back and:
TAKE THE CROWN JEWELS
     {Or her Britishness, as CBS may be trying to do.} 

Causing Kate to:
VIBRATE VIOLENTLY
     [Free &amp; easy, loose, "Americanized"]

And start:
GOING BACKWARDS
     {Being told to pander to the American market would no doubt be a 
[huge] step backwards for Kate at this point in her career.}

The camera pans left to a:
ARCH-TYPICAL "AMERICAN ROCK VIDEO"
     {Dave Guilmor with a wind machine in his face. This video is exclusivly
for the American market. Peter Fitzgerald-Morris tells us it hasn't been
shown in England. Near as we can tell CBS picked this song as the first
single and asked her for "a video for the American market" and she must have
thought "Hmm.. a video for America? Well I guess we'll just have to make an
American video." So she made as American a video as she could.}

Our heroine gets:
CARRIED IN FEET FIRST
      {As she well would have to be. This type of video is known the
well-known, and much dreaded, "Band-in-a-Box"}

And starts to:
GYRATE WILDLY
    {Near as I can tell this is something between The Pony and The Frug.
I think Joey Heatherton invented this one on Hullaballoo.}
[no one has commented on the "hullaballoo" dance moves she made in in the
Dreaming video-same influences at work]

Surrounded by:
CLICHED SHOTS OF BAND MEMBERS
     {Possible award winner for Most-Cliched Visuals on the MTV Music Video
Awards (a hotly contested catagory). The worst lighting I've seen in years.
Par lamps on a straight truss on a chase!! This *cannot* be anything other
than a JOKE, the lighting equivilent of a guitarist running his/her hand up
and down the neck of his/her gee-tar (Kate called this action "obviously
wanking away up there")(see: Heart or any Heavy Metal). Take it from me, the
lighting is dumber than a box of rocks. On purpose. Kate's videos are always
well and subtly lit.}

Until she:
THROWS THE GOLD GLITTER AT THE CAMERA
     {With a manical grin on her face. Watch it in slow motion.}

Thus ends Kate's funniest video. I've broken it down for ease of commenting
by other Love-Hounds. We've run this past Doctor of Katebusholigy Peter
David Fitzgerald-Morris of "Homeground" and he found it amusing and very
likely given Kate's sense of humor. Remember this is Kate we are talking
about, Our Lady of the Oblique Reference, the one who puts lyrics in her
songs that even her most ardent fans cannot decipher, the one who hides
secret symbols on her records, the one who once answered a simple question,
"what kind of makeup do you use?", with, "oh, I don't use makeup anymore,
I use latex!". Comments welcome.


                                  Love, 
                                      Chris'n'Vickie
                                      [or Vickie'n'Chris]

[notice how the title can be turned into Love an' Danger? No special
significance, I just think it's neat]

I was browsing the local CD store the other day and noticed a "compilation"
disk titled "16 songs for a really cheap price."  The thing that caught my
eye about this disk is that the 1st song is "Be Kind to my Mistakes" by
KaTe!!  Next to the song's title were the words "(Not the Album Version)."
Is there another (different) version of this song?  Does anyone have the
album (or song) I'm talking about and is it worth buying?  Let me know,

There is NO "album" version of "Be Kind To My Mistakes", at least
from CBS's point of view.  This compilation (called _Theodore_, by
the way) contains the same version of that song that is on _Aspects
of the Sensual World_, and the British "This Woman's Work" CD single.

The song was originally from the movie "Castaway", and a longer version
of this song (some would say the REAL version) exists only on the
soundtrack for this movie.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack is extremely
difficult to find -- it was never released in America, and even in
Britain it is fairly rare.

In article &lt;m0jTf7d-0001jwC@nike.paradyne.com&gt; you write:
&gt;A Peter Gariel boot "The Angel" has a song with Kate Bush singing with
&gt;Peter called "Another Day".  I know this song is performed by either

This song was written by Roy Harper, and the original version
appears on one of his albums, I believe.  The version on this

is a guest.  There were plans to release this Peter/Kate duet
as a single, but they fell through.

[Richard Caldwell makes some pretty good points I'd like to respond
to.  There are certain things I'd like to apologize for.  Can you
get in touch with the _Little Light_ people and apologize for me
for those things I admit I was in error about, Richard?  Thanks.]

&gt;Actually the thing they're unhappy about this issue is Homeground's
&gt;backhanded dismissal of the whole issue in HG #40.  A simple correction
&gt;without a repetition of the same sort of accusations that people
&gt;took exception to in the first place could have laid the whole thing 
&gt;to rest.

I guess so.  Actually, what I remember most about that was Chris
complaining to me that they didn't credit him!

&gt;But note that this was a letter and not an editorial.  I'm sure many
&gt;folks can tell you the lawyers are apt to write such letters without 
&gt;much provocation.

So true.  But that letter, which is just about the first thing in
the fanzine, gave me an unpleasant taste right from the start.
I hope I didn't imply that the views expressed in this letter were
those of the editors.  I never even mentioned this letter in my
letter to _Little Light_.

&gt;&gt; The editors of the fanzine publish PDFM's letter to the PMRC in full,
&gt;&gt; as well as his reply article in _Homeground_ #40.  However, in the
&gt;&gt; latter, they put several (sic)s in for no reason that I can gather.
&gt;
&gt;If HG had extended the same courtesy to the PMRC the whole issue could
&gt;have been dropped.  The 'sics' in the article were for the most part 
&gt;associated with errors that appear in Homeground #40 (I checked
&gt;HG #40 and I can list them if you like, they're pretty trivial but 
&gt;they're clearly errors).  Unfortunately an over-zealous editor evidently 
&gt;corrected these errors in the text of "Little Light" article,
&gt;rendering the meaning of the 'sic' unclear.

Oh, I see.  I didn't realize they had CORRECTED the errors.  That's
why I couldn't understand all the (sic)s.  So I apologize for my
misunderstanding here -- although I think it's usual correct
to either correct errors, or use sic, but not both.

&gt;No they didn't.  They did place a 'sic' after the "Centre" but the
&gt;"(sic: We're British and we spell it the British way!)" remark was 
&gt;_exactly_ as it appeared in HG #40.  Should we consider this to have 
&gt;been HG making fun of the American spelling? 

You are absolutely right, and I humbly apologize.

&gt;&gt; After that, they have an article called "Cen-sor-ship Defined",
&gt;&gt; in which they describe the history of the PMRC and the stickering
&gt;&gt; campaign.  Some of it isn't too bad, but there are several stupidities
&gt;&gt; in this article.
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested to hear what you think are the stupidities in the 
&gt;article.  I thought it did very good job of laying out the censorship 
&gt;fights that have occurred over the last five years and how more than 
&gt;anything they show that the system works.  It seems well researched so
&gt;I'd be interested to hear about any errors you think it may contain.
&gt;I think you'll have to admit that this sort of in depth treatment is 
&gt;far better than the repeated yammering about the imminent collapse of 
&gt;American freedom that HG has been engaging in.

Here, I actually agree with you.  By stupities I meant the two things
I specifically mentioned that try to shed a bad light on Homeground

&gt;&gt;      A person who shall remain nameless here posted the original message
&gt;&gt; to love-hounds about a year and a half ago.  It was quite clearly meant
&gt;&gt; to be taken as a joke -- hundreds of people saw it on the computer net
&gt;&gt; and nobody complained.  
&gt;
&gt;I don't think this is correct.  I seem to recall one or more persons
&gt;on the net flaming this post.  Again, I can't find any of this in the
&gt;archives but I'd be interested in checking.  

Really?  I don't remember this.  But I can't be sure until the archives
are checked.

&gt;&gt; In Jeff and Bill's [they are the editors -- Ed] welcome letter, they say
&gt;&gt; that Little Light was the "first [newsletter] (anywhere) to report the
&gt;&gt; news of Kate's long-awaited second tour."   Well, love-hounds reported
&gt;&gt; this two days after she made the announcement at the convention.)
&gt;
&gt;Are you saying that their claim is incorrect?  I hardly think Love-Hounds
&gt;can be considered a 'newsletter' for this purpose.  If you want to include 
&gt;electronic communications media we lost out to the phone by just under two 
&gt;days.

First of all, I'm not really saying that their claim is incorrect.
But someone else has posted that love-hounds could be considered
a newsletter, in which case we certainly beat them.  In this paragraph
I was only trying to indicate why a subscription to love-hounds would
be worthwhile for those who have access -- we get the news faster than
any other medium.

And, actually, two days is longer than it really took.  I'm sure that
some British posters posted the news immediately.  But I didn't get
back to check for two days.  I said that because that's the longest
it could possibly have taken.

&gt;&gt;      To go on, in "Cen-sor-ship Defined" you say that the fact that "Army
&gt;&gt; Dreamers" has been removed from BBC playlists during the war shows-up
&gt;&gt; "Homeground's essential hypocrisy of going after Americans while ignoring
&gt;&gt; their own, government sponsored 'censorship'."  For heaven's sake, the
&gt;&gt; last issue of Homeground came out in December, and the war started in
&gt;&gt; January.  In other words, there hasn't been an issue of Homeground
&gt;&gt; published since that action of the BBC!  How could there possibly be
&gt;&gt; a comment about it?
&gt;
&gt;Here I agree with you, the BBC playlist question isn't really
&gt;pertinent until after HG have had a chance to comment on it.  It will
&gt;be interesting to see what HG has to say about it.   I'd also be 
&gt;interested to know if there are any real examples of British censorship 
&gt;fights that have been ignored by HG while they continue to harp on 
&gt;American issues.

Ah, we agree 100% on this.

&gt;&gt;      In the same article, you say "Homeground is spreading the persistent
&gt;&gt; rumor that MTV wouldn't play "Running Up That Hill" in its original form,"
&gt;&gt; and you contradict them.  Well, I'd sure be happy if you were right, but
&gt;&gt; you're the first person I've ever heard say this.  I know they showed 
&gt;
&gt;Later you add...
&gt;
&gt;|      Well, I have a correction to make.  All my sources tell me that
&gt;| the real video *was* played on MTV -- exactly once, on August 20, 1986.
&gt;| This was because the video had been nominated for an MTV award, as you
&gt;| correctly stated, so they had to show it once.  This showing was
&gt;| advertised in Billboard in a full-page ad as a "special screening".
&gt;
&gt;In HG #40 in the "Five Years Ago" section PDFM says...
&gt;
&gt; "...the video was soon a hit of its own in all the territories where
&gt; the single was gaining airplay.  Except one.  In the US the cable
&gt; channel MTV refused to use Kate and Michael.  You can pick the reason
&gt; from the following list of possibilities: (1) it was too erotic (2)
&gt; Kate doesn't lip-sync.  It was of course merely a coincidence that the
&gt; campaign against the sexually explicit nature of (some) rock music led
&gt; by the PMRC was first having it's impact on timid programmers at this
&gt; time."
&gt;
&gt;HG has been repeating this same story for five years when it's
&gt;easily shown as false.  Whether it was played one time or every
&gt;fourth play as LL claims, MTV did show the video.  This continued
&gt;implication that MTV's "timid programmers" didn't show the original
&gt;version of the video because of pressure from the PMRC is pretty silly
&gt;when you consider that not only did MTV show the video, they actually 
&gt;showcased it and nominated it for an award.

I stand by my statement in this case.  First of all, I would not 
call playing the video ONCE, almost a year after the single came
out, a real contradiction of the basic fact that MTV ignored it
totally when it counted.  I do not know how it was nominated for
an award, but they only played it that one time AFTER it had been
nominated.

Second, it was most certainly NOT Homeground who started this "rumor".
It was the American fans who were puzzled by MTV's refusal to play
the real video.  I agree that it most certainly was not the PMRC
(which didn't even exist back then, I think) that pressured MTV not to
show that video.  IT WAS MTV AND EMI-AMERICA THEMSELVES WHO DECICDED
THIS!  I agree that it was wrong for Homeground to mention the PMRC,
which clearly had nothing to do with it.  So the basic facts are
correct as Homeground stated them, it's their speculation as to the
cause that's wrong.

But this wasn't in the _Little Light_ article, so I wasn't responding
to this speculation of Homeground's.

I personally do not believe that the reason they decided not to show
it was because it was "too erotic", although from what I
understand this is the reason EMI-America gave themselves.  (I
may be wrong here.)  I think it's the second reason:  EMI-America
thought they would not be able to break a new artist (which Kate
was in America, for all intents and purposes) without a lip-sycning
video, and MTV agreed.  A year later, Kate HAD broken at least
in certain circles, so they probably felt it was all right to show
the real video.

&gt;It's about time that HG either showed some proof of this allegation 
&gt;(beyond rumors spawned by their own innuendo) or dropped it for the 
&gt;baseless speculation that it is.

Exactly which allegation do you need proof of?  That the choice
of video was inspired by PMRC-related concerns?  This, I agree is
wrong.  That MTV ignored the real video for all practical purposes?
The proof is right here in the love-hounds archives, among other places,
where NOBODY saw it.

If you want to be technical, yes, we were all wrong because MTV did
show it once.  But there must still be a reason WHY they didn't
show it at all when the single was out.  I mean, from most people's point
of view, the difference between showing a video once and never is
insignificant.

&gt;However, the fact is that HG was patently unfair to the PMRC by placing
&gt;their name on this joke document.  As a "parody of attitudes displayed
&gt;in the current rock music censorship battle" it was just fine.  
&gt;Unfortunately, the parody falls flat when you attribute it to a specific 
&gt;organization that makes it a policy not to engage in the sort of 
&gt;judgements that were being made light of.

As you may now be aware, since a couple of people have posted the
original article, the PMRC reference was in Chris's original article.

I was trying to sort out the mess that is my bedroom the other day and
got as far as the CDs, tapes etc. It occured to me that there is a
decided bias in my collection...

Where are all the men?

Consider the following artists

KT, Laurie Anderson, Toyah Willcox, Suzanne Vega, Danielle Dax, Jane
Sibbery, Janis Joplin, Tanita Tikarum, Sally Barker, Sinead O'Connor,
Michelle Shocked, Enya.

Now, try and construct a similar list of men...

Peter Gabriel, Fish, David Bowie, Chris DeBurgh, David Silvian, BB
King ...

And that's just about it. I suppose there is Roger Waters, but he is
well out of his class in this company IMHO.

Since I am not yet willing to give up on my half of humanity, I assume
there are loads of male artists out there I have never come across
simply because I lean heavily on r.m.gaffa for hints and we seem to
have a decided bias towards women here.

So, can anyone help me end my blatently sexist buying practices? There
must be some Gaffaish male artists out there.

	No composers -- for similar reasons.

`Inanity' is right. Is KT news really so thin on the ground that all

fact that some people can't detect humour when it slaps them in the

Can you give a good description of the concert? How was long it?
Was the bassist playing an upright or "regular" bass? Any interesting
in-between song chatter? Was Edie as great as ever?
BTW - where are they touring? Somehow I doubt that they will make it to
Nova Scotia....  :(   oh well.

hmm...most of the male  (non-band) artists I listen to are primarily
instumentalists:

Joe Satriani, Jaco, Pat Metheny, Stu Hamm, John Patitucci, Jimi Hendrix...
Michael Hedges, - all guitarists and bassists. err...there is always Sting,
but I don't listen to him much.

When I was in junior high a friend taped me Sparkle in the Rain, by Simple
Minds - I liked and lost it. I bought it again and it is incredible! ...but
they are a group...

that's all I can think of now.

Latest Album <A  HREF="News:A">News:A</A> release for the end of this year is hoped.
Latest Tour:'At the Convention in November 1990 Kate expressed the hope that
tour dates would be announced early this year.That has not happened,but it is
apparent that preparations are still going ahead behind the scenes.CBS in the
USA have been primed,and at least one major US promotions firm  has claimed it
has already been asked to handle the merchandise,though we think that might be
a teensy-weensy bit premature!Contacts have been reported with the Henson
Creature Shop in London-and the mind boggles as to what that implies!The
official position remains as stated by Kate at the convention-that if all goes
to plan the dates are likely to be at the end of 1991.'
Irish Music Programme:As I mentioned the Series starts on 26th July on BBC2,a
record though will be released on 21st May,and book on 30th May.Homeground
says she will appear in at least one of the shows,I can't wait!The possibility
of new music is mind-blowing!
Finally Homeground has joined the world of computers,you will now have a sub
number like the KBC.This will be put on your snazzy address label.

Well the Residents have been around for quit some time and as far as I know
thye're identities are not publicly known (thogh on one of they're albums
there is a picture of four guys on the cover but not them)

When  they play live they wear costumes ( at first they would just wear a big
eye over thy're heads until one got stolen). Check out they're appearance on
NIGHT MUSIC.

They're music is mostly experimental electronic and computer generated stuff
that you'll either love or hate depending on the song. They claim it's because
they have no musical training and it was the easiest type of music to make.

They have quite afew albums. My three favourites are:

The Commercial Album --- about 40 1 min. songs (fav:Moisture)
...Play John Philip Sousza &amp; Hank Willaims --- just what it says (fav:
                                               Kawliga - uses baseline
                                               from Billie Jean)
The King and I----about 15-20 Elvis Presley covers

Don't get the idea that there a cover band though, but when they do cover
something it's usually quit good.

I can't remember the record label they're on off the top of my head. Try
Ryco for some.

hope this has been usefull.

The type of music depends a lot on the album, though it all classifies
as experimental.  For instance, the _Duckstab_ CD contains a bunch of tracks
from an EP (can't recall the name of it) of Residents-style nursery rhymes
(including "Old MacDonald" and "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star") on which 
all of the "instruments" were purchased at Toys R Us. 

&gt;They have quite afew albums.

(a bit of an understatement; I believe they have released more than 20 
albums since their first release "Meet The Residents" in '72 (I think))

&gt;My three favourites are:
&gt;The Commercial Album --- about 40 1 min. songs (fav:Moisture)

This album features lots of guest artists, many of whom aren't credited.
The only one I can think of off hand is Andy Partridge of XTC.

&gt;...Play John Philip Sousza &amp; Hank Willaims --- just what it says (fav:
&gt;                                               Kawliga - uses baseline
&gt;                                               from Billie Jean)

This is actually "American Composers Volume II:  Stars and Hank Forever."
There is also a Volume I, "George and James" with George Gershwin tunes on
one side and James Brown on the other.


&gt;I can't remember the record label they're on off the top of my head. Try
&gt;Ryco for some.

A bunch of their stuff is on Ryco.  Sometime before _The King and Eye_
they were signed to Enigma, which also released their latest (and my
personal favorite) album, _Cube-E, Live in Holland (the history of American
Music in three e-z pieces)_.

I got to see The Residents perform Cube-E last November in Chicago.  It
was beyond words, but the best I can do is "performance-art-from-hell".
The album details the history of american music, starting with cowboy-folky
stuff (I don't want to classify it as country/western, 'cause it wasn't
really c/w as we know it now), moving to soul/blues, and then into Elvis,
who is eventually killed by the British Invasion.  It's an incredible
piece. 

_Cube-E_ includes quite a few Elvis covers, much as they appear on _The King
and Eye_.  I personally find that _The King and Eye_ gets a bit tedious,
just because there are so bloody many covers.  

Anyway...

    Phew!  For a while I thought the subject line of the original article 
meant "Yes, that's right, Kate Bush Concert Dates."  I figured I would 
have heard of the tour before it actually started.  I gave Ticketron a 
call and found out who really was playing in Cleveland on 29-April.  
Apparently the subject line meant "Here are the concert dates for Yes".

    I guess I can stop hyperventilating now.

Hi!

Did anybody buy Jane's last album? I love her and saw her in Toronto at the end
of the Speckless Sky tour in 85(?).  I'm on a budget now, being married and
having a kid kind of crimps your album buying power, and want to know if it's
good before I shell out bucks for it. 

All opinions considered.

HI Folks!


I recently acquired the KaTe bootleg CD which includes the duet that KaTe
and Peter Gabriel did on British TV of Roy Harper's "Another Day".  I
am completely blown away by this song.  I've been looking for the lyrics
in the archive, but they don't seem to be there.  If anyone out ther in
netland has the lyrics, could you send them to me, please?

By the way, the first time I heard this song was a the 1990 KonvenTion
when they showed a video of it from that TV program. Truly amazing

Diamanda Galas...i'd say pick up her new album PLAGUE EN MASS... or
something like that. all of her stuff is good though.

Residents: funny how no one ever mentions THIRD REICH AND ROLL which
is pretty much what i'd call Industrial noize music. and it's very
very very old. recorded in the early 70's i believe. amazing. i think
if i remember correctly, the point of the album was to show how
fascist the recording industry can get. also, how easily the listening
public can get sucked into liking something if it's billed as a "HIT!!!"

and now for some gaffa stuff. a question: did Kate ever do a recording
on the John Peel show or that other show for the BBC? if so, can it
be found anywhere? just curious really. also, what's going on with
those booklets for This Woman's WOrk Vol I and II from the box set?
is someone still printing up cool liner notes and stuff?

The subject line says it all.  After hearing all of you rave about the
Hammersmith Odeon concert video, I happened upon it at a local video store.
Not just any video store mind you, but a LASER video store. Yep, it's true.
I found a Japanese release of Hammersmith on laser. Did I buy it instantly?
Yes. Did I pay through the nose? Yes. Do I care? Nope! Seriously, I'm very
impressed with it, and the picture quality is excellent by videotape standards,
but only fair by laser standards. I bought it mostly since I hadn't seen it
anywhere else, and certainly not on laser. Got hit for about $50. The clerk
said that the only reason they had it was that the owner is a fan, and bought
a copy especially for himself. He bought the second while he was buying the
first just for kicks. Serendipity at its best, eh?

This would be "theodore: an alternative music sampler".  It has as the first
song, "Be Kind To My Mistakes" by Kate Bush (NON-ALBUM CUT).  Since I only
have two of Kate's albums, I couldn't say if this version is any different
from any other version she has recorded.  In any event, the album is quite
good for the price ($7) so I heartily recommended it.  Along with Kate, you get
the likes of Public Enemy (quite a contrast from Kate, eh?), B.A.D., Shawn
Colvin, Indigo Girls, Living Colour, Poi Dog Pondering, Toad The Wet
Sprocket, and a bunch of other groups from the Columbia/Epic stable.

The Sensual World, Hounds Of Love and more). KT sat in a wood chair

Sorry to bother you with this...

I can get my hands on a Kate Bush CD which supposedly is a bootleg.

Title: Backsides
Released by: Observation Records.

It has several tracks from b-sides of singles, so I'm told...

Has anybody more info on this one?
(Does it contain any previously unreleased material?)

&gt;Does anyone know the origin of this show/interview ? 

This was originally filmed by/for VH-1, a sister-channel of MTV, about a 
year ago.  VH-1 was doing a series of interviews with various artists; they
were all of good quality.

The making-of segment was for "This Woman's Work."

Clips of that video show up in the American videotape "The Sensual World:
The Videos."  I believe that the entire interview is included with the
British version of this videotape.

Geez.  Wish I'd been able to record the thing when I saw it.

     I don't know about the resemblance to the Shaft theme, but what about
the clipped horn riff that echoes "Batman"?  Wonder if Kate was up to some-

 Yes, I've seen this sampler, it's called Theodore ---I think it is mostly
Epic artists (although this wouldn't explain the presence of Kate). It's
well worth getting, there is some neat folkish stuff on it (Indigo girls,
Shawn Colvin) and some harder stuff, Public Enemy , live Living Colour, etc.
Having never heard the'original'"BKtmM", I couldn't say if this version is
a different one, but one thing's fer shure...this is the only CD ever released
with both Kate Bush and Prong on it!---- Excellent!!!

   Hi, everyone. IED is sorry to have been silent during the last week.
Seems while he was away a lot of fuss was stirred up by this woefully
suspicious and spectacularly humorless new bunch of "fans" out in Ohio.
IED can only express thanks to Ed Suranyi and Chris Williams for
showing the kind of patience with these people that IED is incapable
of. At the risk of offending others out there, IED is compelled by
conscience to say that, in his opinion, anyone who could possibly have taken
Chris's piece seriously--is seriously deficient. IED fully supports 
"Homeground" in its coverage of this issue, and in fact he thinks this
"new American fanzine", as well as the PMRC, got fairer treatment
from "Homeground", Ed, Chris--and above all, Kate!--than they deserve.
Love-Hounds--and any other party, for that matter--could probably
manage to extort an acknowledgement from Kate on tape if they went
about it as relentlessly and obnoxiously as these Ohioans evidently
saw fit to do. But even Love-Hounds has some sense of decorum. 
   To answer a couple of questions posed by other Love-Hounds: first,
Kate's brother John Carder Bush _does_indeed_ appear in a Kate Bush
video--two, in fact. Have another look at the astronaut(s) in "The
Big Sky"; and check out the staff at that lovely little shop,
Music For Pleasure...
   As IED interprets the video of "Hounds of Love", Kate (who
directed the clip herself) wanted to make a tribute to Hitchcock's
British films of the 1930s, particularly "The Thirty-nine Steps".
Far from having no story, "Hounds of Love" is an organized little
tale of love and trust. In the beginning Kate's heroine is a demure
and withdrawn loner, visiting a museum (of a rather odd sort--perhaps
a museum of science and industry?). (By the way, keep an eye out for
Hitch himself in this early scene.) The hero, who plays Robert Donat's
character (or a parallel thereof) in "The Thirty-nine Steps", comes in
looking for a way to escape the clutches of the law. He clamps Kate's
character to his wrist with handcuffs and rushes off into the night 
with her, with the authorities hot on their heels. The reference here
is to Richard Hannay's ploy of fettering Madeleine Carroll to him
with a pair of handcuffs, whereupon he takes her off with him 
into the night, on the Scottish hills and dales. They
take refuge at a pub (or dance hall of some kind) where a conga 
dance is taking place--a typical Hitchcock crowd scene. By the end 
of this scene Kate's character, who was initially resentful of the dangerous
stranger, has warmed to the freedom from solitude and convention that he
represents, and (following the hero's recapture and momentary second
escape from the police) she herself snaps the handcuffs back on
between them before she leads them out into the darkness to renew
their flight. The video also recalls (at least in the outdoor scene 
and the first few seconds of the video itself, before the song begins)
the introductory reference to the movie "Night of the Demon" (aka
"Curse of the Demon"). Also note Paddy's dual role (at the museum
and in the public house), and a great many other fascinating little
details worth discovering. IED's personal view is that this video has 
been badly underrated, and it's about time it got the attention it merits.
   Ron Hill: Your friend suggests that Wilhelm Reich might have
suffered from Alzheimer's disease or "some &lt;other&gt; kind of problem"
during the last years of his research? Well, he certainly 
suffered from a problem--namely, severe clinical psychotic delusions.
His last papers deal primarily with the activities of unidentified
flying objects, the proliferation of blue orgonotic energy rays and any
number of equally lunatic subjects. What is so remarkable--even beautiful--
about these late writings, given their patently insane arguments, is the
appearance they give of being thoroughly documented. (That 
most of Reich's footnotes are self-referential by this	
time is understandable--outside of the Orgone Institute there
weren't too many independent scientific experiments being conducted
on the effects of Deadly Orgone Radiation!)
    Just a note about "Be Kind to My Mistakes": the original
version, which appeared on the soundtrack album of the movie
"Castaway", is considerably different from the version which came
out as a b-side in support of "The Sensual World" album. The early
version is a little rougher, a little more "live" in sound quality,
and is a good deal longer in playing-time. Kate edited out some 
twenty-four bars of music (not verses, but instrumental passages) when
she prepared the recording for release in 1989/90. There are some 
wonderful moments of playing by Kate's musicians on the original, 
and the extra length gives the song a much different atmosphere 
than its later CD mix. On the other hand, the "dryer" sound
of the CD version, as well as some tinkering with the rhythm
track, make it fascinating to listen to as well. 
   Finally, a big thankyou to Andy Semple for his news about _HG_ #41.
As wonderful as it sounds (about Kate's continued plans to concertize,
and about the plan to put out a single by year's end), IED cannot help
but remind himself and others that _we_have_heard_this_sort_of_thing_
_before_! Nevertheless...

Subject: Gooch's query

IED doesn't know the actual value of your "Japanese 45", Gooch, but
be advised that your yellow-vinyl edition is not the original version
of that disk. The _actual_ record, as put out by the Japanese fan-club
(now apparently defunct and succeeded by a different group in Japan),
was a simpler affair: a red flex-disk with a white sleeve. On the disk
where a label ordinarily would go was a KT symbol in silver. The
disk had John's spoken message first, followed by Kate's brief
message, followed finally by the excerpt from the live performance
of "Let It Be" from a fan's in-audience (i.e., pirated) Walkman 
recording of the benefit concert for Bill Duffield. (The other 
singers on that track are Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel.) A longer
version of that same recording appeared on the old two-record LP
set called "Passing Through Air" (not to be confused with the 
current CD with the same title), and also on the hard-to-find
bootleg LP "If You Could See Me Fly" (not to be confused with the
current CD with _that_ title!), which included several other 
songs from that benefit concert, as well.

-- Andrew Marvick
   P.S.: Hi, MarK! Hi, Larry! Good to see you both in the group.

   P.P.S.: It's a little premature for IED to make a firm commitment,
unfortunately, but odds are in favor of IED being able (as well as
willing, which latter goes without sayin) to host a Katemas party
at his home in West Los Angeles on or around July 30, 1991. IED will
consult with all concerned persons as soon as possible, to see if
this is an acceptable loKation...
   
   P.P.P.S.: She may very well be...

I've come to think that women writers/singers are just BETTER than
most men . . . but the a man that I listen to as regularly as women is
Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Could just be a local bias, since I'm from Austin,
but I'll stick by it.

Interestingly enough, my CD collection is biased in favor of men, by
just a little bit; I just listen to the women more often, even excluding
Her CDs.  Thinking back, as far as I can remember, the last 13-14 CDs
I have bought have had female singers most/all of the time.  The last
male singer I can remember buying is (yup) Stevie Ray.

There are, in fact, two versions of Be Kind To My Mistakes.  HOWEVER,
the really good version is ONLY available on the soundtrack to the
movie "Castaway."  Every other time this song has been issued, it has
been in what some clever L-H termed the Reader's Digest Abridged
Version.  This version is truly annoying, if you know the original,
because it takes out most of the intro/outro/bridging material and
otherwise castrates an amazingly wonderful song.  I don't know what
prompted Kate (or whoever) to do this - after all, if "I'm Still
Waiting" can run 4.5 minutes, why can't "Mistakes," which is a far far
superior song?

Anyway, the compilation you were looking at is called THEODORE and it
has the lame-o short version of BKTMM.  Save your money and try to
find the Castaway soundtrack instead.

(Sorry to rant, but I really really really loved this song until it
was butchered.  This is probably the one and only issue that Chris &amp;
Vickie (TM)(R)(C)(P) agree with me on.)

a shopping mall to get fitted for a tuxedo because I am going to be in a
friend's wedding.  While I was there I wandered into a music store.  I
didn't think I was going to find anything I wanted because it looked like
all top-40 stuff, and Madonna was playing over the in-store stereo.

I walked over by the music videos and I saw Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith!
I couldn't believe it!  I have been looking for that video for a while.  Most
places don't have it and say that they can't order it.  I had almost given up!
I snatched that baby up quicker than I could count to one.  I watched it
over and over.  It is marvelous!

Yes, I bought it.  I love her, too.  _Bound By The Beauty_ is a must-have
for anyone who enjoys wonderful music.  What made Jane's last release all
the more gratifying was a relatively intensive promotion (and tour :-) 
which included a very collectable VH-1 special on her.  Ed and I were
quick enough to get a table right at the front at Jane's appearance 
in SF last year.  It was an unforgettable experience.  Kind of like

&gt;      {Dave Guilmor with a wind machine in his face. This video is exclusivly
&gt; for the American market. Peter Fitzgerald-Morris tells us it hasn't been
&gt; shown in England. Near as we can tell CBS picked this song as the first
&gt; single and asked her for "a video for the American market" and she must have
&gt; thought "Hmm.. a video for America? Well I guess we'll just have to make an
&gt; American video." So she made as American a video as she could.}

The _Love_And_Anger_ video was shown in the UK on ITV's "Chart Show" on
Saturday Feb 24 1990, the single having been released the week before. 
There may have been other showings but that but this one was reported
by Steve Wallis here on Love-Hounds.

&gt;     There were a few comments from |&gt;oug and Jon Drukman, but otherwise
&gt; folks seemed to like it.

As I think I remarked at the time I think of it as a just a bunch of
contrasting pairs like "love and anger", the orb and scepter, the 
dervishes and ballet dancers and the first and second parts of the 
video.

somebody (i forgot who) asked about _backsides_. he stated it was a cd.
as far as i know, this bootleg is lp only.

but in any event, i wouldn't bother getting it as it is nothing more than
a collection of some b-sides which are, of course, now available on the 
_this woman's work_ box set's two miscellaneous cds.

&gt; How much are Laser Disk Players? There are some computer animation discs that

Pioneer CLD-980 combi-players can be had for well under $400.  This 
is a minimal CD/LD player but it has everything you need in simple CD 
or LD player.  

Anyone who wants to be watching his KT videos five to ten years from 
now would do well to consider an LD player.  The ravages of time on a 
on a five to ten year old videotape are not pretty.

Unfortunately, KT LD availability seems limited.  The eight inch LD of
_The Sensual World_ videos is widely available and the _Live at the
Hammersmith_ disc is available as an import.  The rest have been
reported available as Japanese imports but I've yet to locate them.
(Pointers wecome!)  One person told me on the phone that _The Whole

1) The Residents have their own label, Ralph Records.	

2) It appears that they have numerous guests on many LPs. I talked to
Penn Gillette (sp?) at the intermission of a Penn and Teller show
here in D.C. and he talked about playing on a couple of their songs.
When asked who else he knew of to play with them, he responded "You
wouldn't believe me." For what it's worth.....

3) Try "Third Reich'n'Roll".

4) Great group. Really enjoy the threads !

Just a quick note about the new This Mortal Coil album, which I thought a few
people out there might be interested in. It's called 'Blood'.

I have the CD version which is 76 minutes long, containing 21 tracks, the tape
seems to be the same, i think the LP is a double but I haven't checked

The content is quite similar to Filigree &amp; Shadow, so if you liked that then I
recommend you get this. Several of the same artists are involved, notably
Dierdre Rutkowski who sang all the best (IMHO) songs on F&amp;S.
I've only heard it twice so far, but I like it a lot already, definitely 
recommended to anyone with 'taste'.   :-)

I might try transcribing the lyrics at some point, if anybody is interested or
would like to help (I'll probably need it) then get in touch. I intend to
produce a CD booklet in the same way as several others have with other LPs.

Anyway, thats all for now, a fuller review may follow if anybody wants it.

Hi, Richard!  I hope there's no hard feelings about the spat we're
having -- I mean nothing personal towards anyone, I assure you.

In any case, as I'm sure you know "Love and Anger" was the first
American single, and she made the video for it long before there
was any thought of releasing it as a single in Britain.  So Chris's
(tongue-in-cheek?) remarks are still vailid.

Kate never did a recording on the John Peel show.  She has performed
(lip-sync, always) on several BBC TV shows, but not much recently.
In fact, for _The Sensual World_ she did "This Woman's Work" on
Wogan, but nothing else.

hello all...just got back from germany and am slowly readjusting to the grind
again. i've got a few tidbits to share first though:

- meredith says hi to chris, vickie, andy, ed and everybody else. 

- there seem to be two new bootleg cds available. one apparantly is a double
  cd set that duplicates the two already released demo cds. i am not yet sure
  what the exact set list yet, but i will know wednesday and fill you all in on
  title, track list, etc.

  the other cd has been listed in the past two issues of goldmine as _london
  1979_ in the ad from cd connection in heidelberg (unfortunately, i was only
  in munich and prague, so i didn't get to look into this while over there). i
  do not know if this is another hammersmith cd or if it might be one of the
  london palladium shows. i will try to find out though as soon as i can.

- in munich, i met the guy who owns the #00 hounds of love jersey (the jersey
  of which 100 were made numbered from 00-99). the guy is not a KaTefan at all.
  he's just saving it for a day when he needs the cash.

- however, said guy is not a total asshole as he kindly gave me a copy of what
  he said was a promotional cassette that KaTe recorded for the release of _the
  kick inside_ (in germany, i would presume). the most interesting thing about
  this tape (besides KaTe's utter idealism which i will transcribe for you
  momentarily) is that the songs that are on it *are not* the same versions
  that were released on the album. the differences are subtle, but they are
  there: different instrumentation, diffrent mixes, etc. 

  so for you reading pleasure, i now produce a transcipt of said tape:

-----

[a stripped down version of "the kick inside" is played. KaTe's voice seems
less full than it does on the lp - i haven't fully compared them yet. it fades
after the first verse and is used as a backing track for the following words.]

"hello everyone. this is KaTe bush and i'm here with my new album _the kick
inside_ and i hope you enjoy it. the album is something that has not just
suddenly happened. it's been years of work because since i was a kid, i've
always been writing songs and it was really just collecting together all the
best songs that i had and putting them on the album, really years of
preparation and inspiration that got it together. as a girl, really, i've
always been into words as a form of communication.  and even at school i was
really into poetry and english and it just seemed to turn into music with the
lyrics, that you can make poetry go with music so well. that it can actually
become something more than just words; it can become something special. 

"the way i've always worked is to be with the piano. i never write songs
without the piano - it's always me and it and we communicate. and i always
write the words with the tune - they seem to come together and it's very much a
thing of moods. if the chord i'm playing is telling me something, then the
words will come from that. if it is a minor feel, it will be a sad song because
minor chords are very sad things. if it's a major chord, it will be a slightly
maybe, rockier, happier song. 

"what happens is that i sit down and i start playing the piano and it's the
progression of chords that comes out that actually leads to the song. until i
sit down at the piano and have no idea what's going to happen. sometimes,
before i go there, maybe i'll have an idea that i've picked up from a film or
just from talking to someone about something i've never known about before.
you can find inspiration can click in so many different ways: it can be
something completely out of the blue that you'll suddenly think 'i really want
to write a song.' i think that's how it works though. i think art is about
spontaneous feelings and feedback of people, objects, whatever. it's just a
continuous process of creation. 

"the song 'the kick inside', the title track, was inspired by a traditional
folk song and it was an area that i wanted to explore because it's one that is
really untouched and that is one of incest. there are so many songs about love,
but they are always on such an obvious level. this songs is about a brother and
a sister who are in love and the sister becomes pregnant by her brother. and
because it is so taboo and unheard of, she kills herself in order to preserve
her brother's name in the family. the actual song is in fact the suicide note.
the sister is saying 'i'm doing it for you' and 'don't worry, i'll come back to
you someday.' this is it."

["the kick inside" is played.]

"'i'll send you love to zeus
  oh by the time you read this...'

"that was the song 'the kick inside' off my new album released on emi. i hope
you liked it. this is KaTe bush speaking"

[commercial break?]

["feel it" begins and fades]

"this is KaTe bush again. i think maybe the reason i write songs is maybe i
need to my express myself. that i need to be heard by people, maybe just to
feel that i am someone for some reason. but i don't really think it matters why
as long as what i'm doing has some purpose and if it, in any way, makes other
people feel happy, which is all i'm into. i really hope that listen to the song
will enjoy it and have fun. 

"for me, age is very nebulous concept. it's something you can't really label on
people. you meet people are maybe sixty years old are like a kid. 

"i think life is all about your attitudes and how you actually see things.  i
was lucky enough to be born into a family that consists of very observant
people. they're very aware of people's motivations and why they do things.  i
think i'm very lucky because a lot of that has rubbed off on me. since i've
been a kid, i've always been aware of observing people and trying to observe
myself and why i do things. it's such an incredibly fascinating process the way
people work, i can't help but be inspired by all that goes around me. it's just
incredible.

"i think i was very lucky cos when i was a small child, my brothers were
extremely musical. they were into traditional music: english and irish folk.
they were always playing stuff on the record players and had their own bands
and go around the clubs. i got quite involved with it. i would sing along with
them and sing harmonies. i think it was important cos when you are very young,
your mind is so open for new stimulus and direction. i think it was given to me
then, so i didn't really have to spend maybe ten years finding out what i was
here for. i think that's been an important part of my life.

"my other musical influences really have been things from the radio, ob-
viously, because what you listen to are the things that are going on. and
again, what my brothers were playing on the radio. at a later stage, i started
seeking out my own stimulus and that came from people like, um, especially
billie holiday. she was a really important thing to happen to me. her voice
just really did things to me. so emotional and so tearing.  i still can't get
over how incredible her voice was and her presence. i'm into more progressive
people, i guess, like david bowie and roxy music and steely dan. i think they
are a very underestimated group, especially in england. they really are an
important musical influence. and nearly anything really. i love so much music.
i think that's the amazing thing about it: music can go into every corner of
every room. there's so many different styles of music. everyone is great in
their own right - it's just a matter of personal taste, really.

"i think also one of the most amazing things about music, especially for the
last twenty or thirty years, is the fact that we've been able to pre- serve it
on record. so it's no longer someone jamming in a little club in the thirties
in a little smoky place. it's an eternal process. you can lis- ten to people
that have died maybe twenty years ago. you can see them on the television. you
can see them moving and young. they are no longer there.  you've captured that
moment, purely through mechanical things, which is really quite ironic because
music is such a pure emotional thing to be captured on such a mechanical modern
contraption. but it's the only way we can do it.

"this next song's called 'wuthering heights' and it's my single in england.
it's from the novel called _wuthering heights_ - you probably might know it
better as the film. it's about the end of the film where cathy has actually
died and she's coming back as a spirit across the moors to come and get
heathcliff again. and it just struck me very strongly because it shows alot
about human beings and how if they can't get what they want, they will go to
such extremes in order to do it. this is exactly what she did. she wouldn't
even be alone when she was dead. she had to come back and get him. i just found
it really amazing."

["wuthering heights" is played.]

"well, that song was 'wuthering heights' and this KaTe bush talking to you and
i hope you're still with us and having a good time. that was from my new album,
_the kick inside_ on emi records."

[commercial break?]

["feel it" begins again and fades again...]

"this is KaTe bush again. 

"i think probably one of the most amazing things about the music scene today is
the fact that music is purely one aspect of it. it is in fact a very large
commercial business. this is why it is so hard for new unknown people to get
into to - because it's a money-making business. a lot of companies are into
creating formulas that will actually make the money for them and it's hard for
people who have got something new to get through. but then again, there are the
people in the companies who are aware of this and i think that that's where the
magic lies because if you get through to them then you're all right. 

"for me, the most important thing is my music. that's what i'm here for. i
think it's important that you realize that it is a business because you can't
just play your music and shut yourself away becasue you have to communicate
with your audience becasue they're the people that you're doing it for. you
just have to compley with all the rules."

"i think an interesting thing i happening in the music scene at the moment - i
think from the beginning of this year, especially in england. it was purely
because of punk. it was a very quick dynamic thing that happened and i think
its purpose was in order to bring new things out of it. we now have a sort of
thing called new wave, which has come from punk, but it's not like punk at all.
it's rich in interesting lyrics, completely different attitude towards music.
there are very interesting lyrics that are based a lot more on reality than a
lot of things have gone before. i think that's the trouble with a lot of music
that was happening: things were becoming purely romantic bubblegum. just
talking about boy meets girl. the great thing about music is that it's a
message. you actually have the power to convey a message to people to let them
know about something they didn't know about before. i think that's an
incredible responsiblity on behalf of the artist. i find myself very aware of
that and i often wonder if i am doing any good, but i know it's my purpose.
it's what i must do.

"i do love singing other people's songs. i have done. but i feel that that is
in fact cheating becasue there are so many good singers around who sing other
people's songs and there aren't as many songwriters in comparison. for me, my
only reason i sing is becasue i write the songs and i feel because i've written
them and i know what they're about, i'm the one that can convey the message the
best. but, i don't really consider myself a singer. i'm a singer/songwriter,
but only because i write the songs.

"maybe another interesting thing about this album is that two of the tracks,
'the man with the child in his eyes' and 'saxophone song' were recorded about
three years ago. this was in fact my initial plunge into the business, as they
say, with the help of dave gilmour from pink floyd. i managed to get through to
him through a contact of my brothers' and at that time he was looking around
for unknown talent. he came along and heard me and we put some things down and
he put up the money for me to make my first demo in a proper recording studio
with arrangements. i owe to him the fact that i got my contract and that i'm
where i am now. two of these original tracks that we had on the demo are on the
album, so maybe that helps with the variation.

"the inspiration for 'the man with the child in his eyes' was really just a
particular thing that happened when i went to the piano. the piano just started
speaking to me. it was a theory that i had had for a while that i just observed
in most of the men that i know: the fact that they just are little boys inside
and how wonderful it is that they manage to retain this magic. 

"i, myself, am attracted to older men, i guess, but i think that's the same
with every female. i think it's a very natural, basic instinct that you look
continually for your father for the rest of your life, as do men continually
look for their mother in the women that they meet. i don't think we're all
aware of it, but i think it is basically true. you look for that security that
the opposite sex in your parenthood gave you as a child.

["the man with the child in his eyes" is played.]

["l'amour looks something like you" is played and faded.]

"this is KaTe bush again with my new album, _the kick inside_ on emi. there are
thirteen tracks on this album. when we were getting it together, one of the
most important things that was on all our mind was, that because there were so
many, we wanted to try and get as much variation as we could. to a certain
extent, the actual songs allowed this because of the tempo changes, but there
were certain songs that had to have a funky rhythm and there were others that
had to be very subtle. i was very very greatly helped by my producer and
arranger andrew powell, who really is quite incredible at tuning into my songs.
we made sure that there was one of the tracks, just me and the piano, to,
again, give the variation. we've got a rock'n'roll number in there, which again
was important. and all the others there are just really the moods of the songs 
set with instruments, which for me is the most important thing, becasue you can
so often get a beautiful song, but the arrangements can completely spoil it -
they have to really work together.

"i think one of the really interesting things was compare live work with
actually recording. it's such a completely different process, because when
you're gigging, which i did for a little while with my band, the KT bush band,
we were just doing pubs around london. we were singing other peoples' songs -
rock'n'roll songs. it's really different because you feedback off the audience.
you can see their faces. you can tell if they hate you or if they love you. all
you're trying to do when you're on the stage is to  excite them, get them to
have a good time and enjoy it. with the album, it's a very different thing
because that's a piece of plastic that people, hopefully, will listen to again
and again. so you have to make it a very different kind of thing, it has to be
purely for the ear, to allow people's imaginations to just move on their own.
we just tried to do this by the arrangements and harmonies. there are so many
of those things that you can't do live because you, obviously, can't overdub
your own voice three times when you're singing live. you can't put harmonies in
- you get other people to do it. the thing actually about playing it live is
that in fact we weren't doing any of my songs - we were just doing other
people's rock'n'roll numbers, becasue in fact, in the pubs in london, unless
you're well known that's the only way you get people to listen to you. they
need to know the songs and they need to be able to drink their beer and dance.
and with the album, i was trying to initiate my songs, which is a completely
different thing, and i was amazed at how lucky i was getting people to listen
to me. i've been very lucky.

"this next song is called 'strange phenomena' and it's all about the
coinsidences that happen to all of us all of the time. like maybe you're
listening to the radio and a certain thing will come up, you go outside and it
will happen again. it's just how similar things seem to attract together. like
the saying 'birds of a feather flock together' and how these things do happen
to us all the time. just strange coincidences that we're only occasionally
aware of. and maybe you'll think how strange that is, but it happens all the
time.

"well, i hope you've enjoyed all the tracks we've been listening to. it's been
great to be with you all - i hope that you're all well and happy. they're the
tracks of my first album and i'm working on my second one at the moment in
france. i hope you like that one too and maybe i'll come back again sometime
and tell you all about that one."

["strange phenomena" is played.]

[there follows a number a short bits that are separate from the main interview.
probably there were to be used as shorts between songs on the radio or as
intros to her songs when they were played...]

"this is KaTe bush speaking. on the whole, i listen to very few lady singers. i
identify myself much more with male singers, especially male songwriters. but
the people i really admire: billie holiday, she's in a right of her own. david
bowie, i think he's an incredible songwriter. bryan ferry i think is an
imnportant writer. the other people i do listen a lot ot are steely dan. and i
think the main common denominator for the people that i like are that they are
songwriters. they all seem to be either male groups or male single
personalities who write their songs and sing them. and i think this is why i
tend not to listen to females as much becasue the few that do get this together
i don't find particularly interesting. joni mitchell stands on her own. i think
joan armatrading too - she's special. but on the whole, i think i just identify
more with male songwriters."

"hi everyone - this is KaTe bush. the things that i hope for the future are
that i continue to write songs and sing and that they progress. that they
become more purposeful - that they have a purpose there all the time. one of
the most important things to me is that i expand as a human being. so really
any other sort of other levels that would take me onto a different plane, i'm
welcome to if it's right. i'd love to get into the film media sometime, but i
don't know if i as an actress can act. i don't think i could. i don't know.
i'll just wait and see what comes and hope that i can expand and grow."

- recall that this was recorded sometime in 1978 or so. keep this in mind when
  reading what she said. it's most interesting to compare it to what she says

I lost Michael Graham's original post, but he wanted to know
about the Edie Brickell concert.  They came onstage at a few minutes
past nine, and left just after eleven.  I don't have a song list,
but they played many of my favorites.  The bassist used an upright bass,
and there were two drummers -- or rather one drummer and one percussionist.
The band was REALLY tight!

This was almost the end of the tour.  The went down to L.A. this weekend.

&gt;From article &lt;9104192050.AA19655@das.llnl.gov&gt;, by ed@das.llnl.GOV (Edward J. 
Suranyi):
&gt; [Richard Caldwell makes some pretty good points I'd like to respond
&gt; to.  There are certain things I'd like to apologize for.  Can you
&gt; get in touch with the _Little Light_ people and apologize for me
&gt; for those things I admit I was in error about, Richard?  Thanks.]

I wouldn't mind doing so Ed, but I don't really talk to the folks at
_Little Light_ all that often.  They will probably see your message
here since they get to see most LH posts as provided by an AAHP member
who has BITNET access but there's no guarantee.  My suggestion would
be to write still another letter to let them know that some of the
misunderstandings in your previous letter have been cleared up and
offer them a dissenting viewpoint for their letters column in an
upcoming issue.  You may have to be quick about it since they seemed
to be moving along toward the next issue last time I talked to them.

&gt;&gt;I don't think this is correct.  I seem to recall one or more persons
&gt;&gt;on the net flaming this post.  Again, I can't find any of this in the
&gt;&gt;archives but I'd be interested in checking.  
&gt; 
&gt; Really?  I don't remember this.  But I can't be sure until the archives
&gt; are checked.

I checked (now that I have the exact date) and no, nobody flamed.  A 
couple of folks seemed to take it about half seriously and only Chris 
knows what showed up in his mail box.  The point is, however, that 
the people who complained are not isolated -- as some would have us 
believe -- to a few "humor impaired" people near Cleveland, nor did 
they all fall for the joke.  Yes, some _Homeground_, _Still Breathing_ 
and _Little Light_ readers from all over the country and perhaps that 
world took it seriously but others counted it as just one more instance 
of HG's "American censorship" squawking than they were willing to sit 
and listen to quietly.  You may count me among the latter.

[Convention news]
&gt; And, actually, two days is longer than it really took. I'm sure that
&gt; some British posters posted the news immediately.  But I didn't get
&gt; back to check for two days.  I said that because that's the longest
&gt; it could possibly have taken.

Actually it took roughly forever but that's probably just how it
seemed to someone who was checking news every five minutes! :-)

&gt;&gt;HG has been repeating this same story for five years when it's
&gt;&gt;easily shown as false.  Whether it was played one time or every
&gt;&gt;fourth play as LL claims, MTV did show the video.  This continued
&gt;&gt;implication that MTV's "timid programmers" didn't show the original
&gt;&gt;version of the video because of pressure from the PMRC is pretty silly
&gt;&gt;when you consider that not only did MTV show the video, they actually 
&gt;&gt;showcased it and nominated it for an award.
&gt; 
&gt; I stand by my statement in this case.  First of all, I would not 
&gt; call playing the video ONCE, almost a year after the single came
&gt; out, a real contradiction of the basic fact that MTV ignored it
&gt; totally when it counted.  I do not know how it was nominated for
&gt; an award, but they only played it that one time AFTER it had been
&gt; nominated.

Sorry but this is wrong.  You will find in the archives (I believe
it's file 0010) that Doug reported that MTV was showing the promo
video in early January 1986.  There's no telling how long they had
been showing it prior to that.  Remember also that MTV had a 30 day
exclusive on the Wogan version (according to Doug) so it would make
perfect sense for them to play it instead of the promo for that reason
alone.   Not long after that thirty days was up the video for 
Cloudbusting was released and that was played for a while.  When they 
returned to playing RUTH late in the year it seems likely that they 
were mixing the two versions (as LL says) and that Doug finally sighted 
the promo video in early January.  _Not_ a almost a year later.  

There is no evidence that MTV "refused" to show anything.  It is
apparent from the archives that EMI-America decided that the
promotional version of _Running Up That Hill_ was "unsuitable" for
American audiences.  (Later they would change their mind and decide to
provide both videos.  Very clever, since they'd already given MTV an
exclusive on the Wogan version).  Before Doug even saw the video and 
based on a English friend's report that it was "like _Hammer Horror_" 
Doug assumed that "unsuitable" meant "too erotic."  As soon as Doug saw 
the actual video he changed his mind immediately.  It was obviously
not too erotic so he speculated that EMI found it too "artsy fartsy."
Unfortunately the "too erotic" idea seems to have taken on a life of
it's own.

I would be interested to hear from Doug whether my interpretation from
the archives is consistent with what he recalls.

&gt; Second, it was most certainly NOT Homeground who started this "rumor".
&gt; It was the American fans who were puzzled by MTV's refusal to play
&gt; the real video.  

It was not my intention to say that they did, only that they had been
repeating this unsubstantiated rumor for five years.  Even going so 
far as printing in a book as fact.

&gt; I agree that it most certainly was not the PMRC
&gt; (which didn't even exist back then, I think) that pressured MTV not to
&gt; show that video.  

The PMRC came into existence during roughly that same time frame.
They had little political clout until the commerce committee hearings 
and showed no real interest in videos in any case.  It was
Rep. Paula Hawkins who raised that issue during the hearings.

&gt;&gt;It's about time that HG either showed some proof of this allegation 
&gt;&gt;(beyond rumors spawned by their own innuendo) or dropped it for the 
&gt;&gt;baseless speculation that it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly which allegation do you need proof of?  

That MTV refused to play the promotional video for RUTH because they
considered it to be too erotic.   All the evidence indicates that EMI 
selected the Wogan video (I even have an interview with Kate where 
she seems to confirm this) because they felt that the promo video was 
unsuitable for the U.S. market.  There is nothing to suggest that 
"unsuitable" meant "too erotic".  It makes perfect sense that MTV would 
play the Wogan version for no other reason than that they had an exclusive 
on it right up until just before the release of _Cloudbusting_.

No problem, Ed.  You've been completely reasonable.  

&gt; In any case, as I'm sure you know "Love and Anger" was the first
&gt; American single, and she made the video for it long before there
&gt; was any thought of releasing it as a single in Britain.  So Chris's
&gt; (tongue-in-cheek?) remarks are still vailid.

Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear.  I didn't mean to imply that _Love &amp;
Anger_ wasn't chosen for the American market.  It clearly was.  My

video was never shown in the UK.

  AATHP is pleased to announce the expansion of its fan
club functions in cooperation with Columbia Records/Sony
Music Distribution Inc. For the first time, AATHP is
accepting memberships {as opposed to Little Light
subscriptions only- J.T.} and will begin publishing
a second, more fan-oriented newsletter. For details,
SASE's to AATHP Memberships, PO Box 221, Cuyahoga
Falls, Ohio 44222. AATHP members will receive, directly
from Columbia, pre-release mailers alerting them to
the imminent release of Kate Bush recordings.
  AATHP is also expanding geographically. We are in the
midst of organising several local chapters where our
subscribers have felt a need for organization on the local
level. For information about them or about starting them,
contact AATHP Chapters, above address (send SASE).
  Futhermore, the next AATHP sponsored fan convention will
be held on August 1, 1992, in or around Cleveland. It has
been the suggestion of several Love-Hounds correspondents
that the most appropriate time for a Kate convention is
her birthday or one of the near weekends. We thank you for
your advice, and happily follow it.
  For fans in the NE Ohio area, we will also be hosting
a video party on August 24, 1991. We couldn't swing a
date close to Kate's birthday, but we are doing the video
party partially because of interest at the convention, and
at the suggestion of some Love-Hounds people. Thanks again!
For information on this, contact the above address.
  Lastly, we'd like to thank all of you who have contacted

Subject: Life is beautiful today!


Today I went to that radio focus group I told you about a couple of
weeks ago.  I didn't get to personally tell a radio programmer to
play more Kate, but it was interesting anyway.

First, we filled out a survey about which radio stations we listened to,
and what we want from radio stations.  Then came the meat:  We listened
to ten-second snatches of 350 different songs, and rated them on how
familiar they were and how much we liked them.  This survey was clearly
sponsored by KITS; nearly all the songs were ones I'd heard on that
station.

Yes, they did include Kate:  "Running Up That Hill" and "Love And
Anger".  I gave them both a score of 6  (meaning I was familiar
with the song, and it was a favorite).

There was a girl sitting next to me, and we got to talking afterwards.
Her tastes and mine seemed vaguely similar, so I made the key remark:

"I was really glad they included some Kate Bush in this."

And she said --

"Yeah!  Every time she came up, I wrote '6' right away!"

Turned out she's a Kate fan!  She said that she's never met a guy who's
a Kate fan before!  All the other Kate fans she knows (of which
there are very few, apparently) are girls.  So I said I know lots
of guys who are, and I told her about Katemas, and about my enormous
collection, and she seemed VERY interested.

So we exchanged telephone numbers and, well, things are looking great!
I'm SO happy!!!!!!!!!!

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.2 PL16]

After all the talk here on her, I decided to get one of her CDs, to
find out what it was all about.  I bought _The Divine Punishment and
The Saint of the Pit_.  After listening to the first half of _Punishment_,
I only have one word.

Terrifying.

I don't think I've been so scared (or riveted) since puberty taught me
what a wonderful thing my gonads were.  This is the first time that I've
ever experienced anything that made me feel I knew what Hell was really
like.

This woman has an amazing talent.  I'm not yet sure if I like it, but there
is no denying the reality of her recordings.  I eventually shut it off, both
because I felt I had to digest the album in smaller chunks and because my
girlfriend was looking at me like I was nuts.  (She didn't like it.)  When
my fists unclench I'll listen to the rest.

One question:  are all of her recordings religiously based?

I'm sure some of you have noticed the mentions of Jane in rec.music.misc over
the last day or two. This reminded me to finally getting around to something

Can anybody over in the States or Canada get hold of all of Jane's CDs ?
I'll quite happily pay you in advance for them, but since they don't seem to
be available over here I think it is the only way I'll ever get them.
I seem to recall somebody once posting a mail-order address for a retailer.
This would do fine.
I should probably mention that I do actually own BBtB, and having seen Jane
three times in her five nights in England (Thanx Bob for the tickets  :-)
I want to get the rest. I figured it was about time I finally commited myself
to the expense.

Also, does anybody know what happened to the Siberry mailing list ?
Is it still alive ?
If so, could somebody please forward my address to the moderator
thanks

Excuse my ignorance, but what is the "Wogan version" of RuTH? Is it the live
version she did along with HoL? (BTW where, why and when were these performed?
)   the live RuTH has Kate on stage in a black dress, with Del on guitar??
and a drummer, for HoL Del is on keyboards. 

I'm confused, but not quite dazed.

Kevin House writes

&gt;Just a quick note about the new This Mortal Coil album, which I thought a few
&gt;people out there might be interested in. It's called 'Blood'.
&gt; 
&gt;I have the CD version which is 76 minutes long, containing 21 tracks, the tape
&gt;seems to be the same, i think the LP is a double but I haven't checked
 
Yes the LP is a double - with nice packaging on the records as usual.
Here's a review I posted to the 4AD listserv group (which everyone should join!
)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
DAD1005 This Mortal Coil - Blood 

Well as always with a 4AD product - describe the packaging first! The outer 
sleeve photo is a lot less subtle than the previous covers - very striking &amp; 
very in focus - the back cover has a room where the wall contains many photos 
from the various TMC covers.

Well what's the music like? Well - overall the LP is warmer in feel, with many 
of the songs being string based - the opening moments are soft washes of synth 
before moving into typical 4AD territory. The first vocal track 'Mr. Somwhere' 
opens with a synth that sounds frighteningly like The Farm for about 2 seconds 
but then it changes in Caroline Crawley of Shelleyan Orphan's perfect English 
summer voice over string backing and acoustic guitars - actually more SO than 
TMC in style.'Andialu' is Bill Nelson/Eno style atmospherics &amp; closer to old 
style TMC - sort of Acid,Bitter &amp; Sad style TMC (in fact much of Blood reminds 
me of that track - I wonder if many of the instrumentals were recorded at this 
point - it could account for the wide variation in styles).'With Tommorow' is 
more 'Filigree &amp; Shadow' - treated piano, and multi-tracked voices.'Loose 
Joints' is T.M.C. go dance (in a way you'd associate with Xymox or Wolfgang 
Press though!) it sounds like a danced up version of the centre portion of 
Acid, Bitter &amp; Sad. 'You &amp; Your Sister' shows Kim Deal displaying a more 
sensitive side, joined by Tanya Donnely on b/vox - like Mr.Somewhere this track
 
is quite 'warm' sounding.

I can't be bothered to review every track, but personal highlights of the other
 
sides are 'I Come &amp; Stand At Every Door' which is quite celtic (with Louise &amp; 
Dierdre Rutkowski, &amp; Tim from Frazier Chorus) - kind of Clannad or Mike 
Oldfield (yes - think of the b/vox on 'Five Miles Out'). 'Bitter' IS from Acid,
 
Bitter &amp; Sad, extended to it's full version. Several Times is quite 'It'll End 
In Tears' style.'Late Night' on side 3 I don't like - as much as I adore 
Caroline Crawley's voice it won't work a Syd Barret song, though she does 
justice to Mary Margaret O'Hara's 'Help Me Lift You Up'.
Elsewhere we get doses of unexpected AOR guitar playing - no TMC haven't sold 
out! It just comes across as unusual given the backing.

I can't really say whether I actually LIKE this yet, as TMC usually takes a 
while to grow on me (the stand-out tracks always hit me instantly), but it 
sounds fine from the first 2 listens &amp; I don't hesitate to reccomend it to all 
TMC fans.

J.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

After a few more listens I've decided my favourite tracks are I Come &amp; Stand At
Every Door, Mr.Somewhere, and You &amp; Your Sister, and the whole thing sounds
better, though as usual some of the instrumentals tend to grate if I'm not in
the mood. Some of the guitar soloing really is quite excessive BTW.
There's a big interview in this weeks Melody Maker which I'll summarise on the
4AD list (plug plug plug).

&gt;I've come to think that women writers/singers are just BETTER than
&gt;most men . . . but the a man that I listen to as regularly as women is

Possibly, but here's some thoughts on the matter. I sat down &amp; worked out my
favourite song-writers, whether in groups or not, and it turns out that most
men are in groups, and most females are solo artists. But wait I thought....

Surely Suzzane Vega &amp; Kate Bush use a core of musicians on most of their LPs
that is their 'band', and many of the 'bands' I like use enough session/guest
musicians to not count as bands at all. Then you've got Roger Waters late perio
d
Pink Floyd stuff, which was really Waters solo(not my fave band, but an example
)
There's also a few one-man bands like Another Sunny Day, or Brighter, or The Hi
t
Parade (Ok the last two are duos now) (who are they all, you ask - ah, that
would be telling) where one person covers themselves with a group identity.
What about The The (Matt Johnson).
Then you've bands that are collections of great songwriters, like the Blue
Aeroplanes, or the Fieldmice, where any of the songwriters could easily make a
solo career too.

And it occured to me - marketing! - basically it's easier to sell a female
singer/songwriter (which is why I guess they have more prescence as a label
is more likely to sign something marketable), whatever their qualities as a
songwriter. In fact I'd guess it's easier to market a solo artist without her
band, than as a band with a female lead member. What about the 'Patti Smith
Group' - anyone remember the one's who weren't Patti Smith? Blondie - remember
the 'Blondie is a group' advertising campaign? and who still associates the 
word with Debbie Harry?
Still - I can't really come up with a contemporary male Bush  (OK George Bush! 
but you know what I mean) or Mary Margaret O'Hara yet,  whether they are in gro
ups or not,but that's probably because they write from a very feminine perspect
ive.

Subject: pologIE Da ied--mi struggo da rimorso! mi struggo da rimorso!

   As Pinkerton confessed to Sharpless, so IED does to the "AATHP" et al.
Sorry for being unreasonable about this PMRC business. IED admits that
personal insults about deficiencies in humor were uncalled for. Sua culpa. 
He remains baffled, nonetheless, at the apparent fact that some people
were unable to perceive that Chris's piece was a joke. 
   On the larger issue of the AATHP itself--IED confesses to having been 
--again unreasonably--reluctant to welcome this new entity into the 
ranks, for several unrelated and admittedly less than fully rational
reasons.
   First, it seems, frankly, a little like overkill to this Kate Bush
fan, to see yet another group coming out with still another Kate Bush
fanzine. Just to mention KT mags in the U.S. alone, there's Love-Hounds;
Watching Storms (which is run by the so-called "American Kate Bush 
Society"); The Big Sky Forum; Reaching Out; Kevin Hendryx's new 
Lone Star Lionhearts; Gillian Gaar's For the Love of Kate; After  
the Party; and the list goes on...IED admits that he doesn't think
it's particularly constructive to continue this splintering of Kate
Bush fan groups throughout the country, when (in his opinion) so much
more might be done by consolidating forces into one organized entity.
   Second, by whose criteria is Scott Shepard (sp.?) a "world famous
Kate Bush authority"--as the AATHP's flyer advertised--and not simply
a Kate Bush fan like the rest of us, albeit one who likes to do a lot
of dealing?
   Third, IED admits taking offense at this bizarre resentment of
_Homeground_--which, incidentally, has been _more_ than open in its
criticism of British censorship for years and years (note, as only
the latest example, their frankly critical description of the BBC's
recent policy of "suggesting" that certain songs not be played 
during the Gulf war). Far from U.S.-bashers, the _Homeground_ crew
have been, in IED's view, extraordinarily willing to welcome Americans
into its enclave. They routinely report on the U.S. Kate scene,
publish a large number of letters, articles, even artwork from U.S.
fans, and keep on very friendly terms with a number of American 
fans beyond the domain of _Homeground_ itself.
   Finally, perhaps IED _should_ be slower to anger when hearing about
fans bothering Kate for endorsements. Nevertheless, it does seem at
least a little bit tacky of this group of Ohio fans to go about  
systematically heckling Kate Bush over the phone--by one Love-Hound's own
account _many_ times, right up till the last moment--just to extract
from her what could only have been (and by early reports was) a  
forced, unenthusiastic, rote endorsement of their activities?
   So, these were the feelings which produced IED's initial, overheated,
even unwarranted remarks about the AATHP. IED would love to start from 
scratch, shake figurative hands and continue in peaceful coexistence from 
here on out. Perhaps some kind of coordination of Katemas activities could even
be arranged.
   Which reminds IED--the location of the California Katemas party has
_not_ been decided yet. See announcements here as soon as possible.

Well Jorn, it may have bounced for you, but I still got it!  Anyway, rather
than send it directly to me, will someone please repost it to Love-Hounds

Hound who missed saving it before it expired on his system-I thought I had
saved it, but couldn't find it.  Since there may be more of us who could 
use it again, will someone please post it to Love-Hounds.

Hi Lionhearts!

It is a distinKT honour to announce the 1991 California Katemas party,
to be held at my house at 567 Boxleaf Court, San Jose, CA. (95117), 
exact date to be determined.  Since Kate's birthday falls on a Tuesday
this year, maybe the weekend before (either Saturday the 27th or 
Sunday the 28th) might be the right time.  But we'll coordinate the 
date with other parties to be held elsewhere as soon as possible.  
Personally, I'd like it to be on Saturday so that people needing to go 
to work on Monday (and coming from out-of-town) won't have to rush 
back home, but I am flexible.  

I've talked this over with IED (by email) and Ed Suranyi, and they both
plan to attend.  This in itself guarantees KuiTe a time to be had by all!
Special attractions this year will be the Kon pics (thanks to RON HILL!),
the _This Woman's Work_ boxed sets (UK, Japanese, UK vinyl), my KTISGOD
license plate (now SIGNED BY KATE!) which should arrive by then, as well
as the usual veritable plethora of rare Kate video, posters, magazines, 
KonvenTion memorabilia, and who knows what else.  Maybe even Jon Drukman!


More detailed plans to follow just as soon as we get it all firmed up.  I
Kan'T wait!  

She really IS!

&gt;Sorry but this is wrong.  You will find in the archives (I believe

Holy cow, you're right!  How on earth did I miss this?  And why didn't
anyone who had access to MTV back then speak up?
Here's the relevant quote from Doug:

 Empty-V is also now showing the real video for
RUTH (at least the last time I saw it, it was the real video), but
they've taken it out of their rotation, so it's probably not being seen
very much anymore.

Mike Scott (of The Waterboys).  Forget the fact that they've re-released
"The Whole Of The Moon" and that its been a big British chart success. (Its a
excellent song, particularily its lyrics, which has been cheapened by
being re-released).  I recommend the two albums _This Is The Sea_ (which
contain _The Whole Of The Moon_) and _A Pagan Place_.  Their last two
albums are good but not as good, IMO.

&gt;   As Pinkerton confessed to Sharpless, so IED does to the "AATHP" et

&gt;Sorry for being unreasonable about this PMRC business. IED admits 
&gt;that
&gt;personal insults about deficiencies in humor were uncalled for. Sua 
&gt;culpa. [stuff deleted]
&gt; IED would love to start 
&gt;from
&gt;scratch, shake figurative hands and continue in peaceful coexistence 
&gt;from
&gt;here on out. Perhaps some kind of coordination of Katemas activities 
&gt;could even
&gt;be arranged.

Hoorah!  Let's be friends, dammit!  I was afraid I was witnessing the
schism of the Greek from the Roman Church, or sumpn.

The more local Kate groups and zines the better, by my (little) lights!  If
some groups seem a bit overzealous, well, let's tell 'em where we think
it's at, but be sure they know we're all still... Sisters in Kate???

Regarding the overzealousness, I have to say I feel some rankling envy that
AATHP seems to have scored a late-comer's coup with Columbia.  I can't
believe Columbia means to shut anybody out, though.  Can we establish
contact with the relevant parties there and find out how we can get equity?

From: the pragmatic romantic &lt;REWOICC@ERENJ.BITNET&gt;
Organization: fegmaniax anonymous, inc
Subject:      a retraKTion, a new bootleg and more sTuff

first, upon more careful and closer listening and comparison to the original
tracks, i must retract my earlier statement that the songs that appeared on
the promotional cassette for _tki_ i recently transcribed are alternative
mixes. they are not. rather, the recordings of the songs are not particularly
good - the treble is much too high and the bass much too low. this gives them
a certain quality that one does not hear on the official releases that fooled
my ears. i also plead that i was not quite awake the first time i hear the
tape - it was about 2 am in the morning. and you all know how first impres-
sions are...

second, as i mentioned on monday, i took a look at that new bootleg cd that
appeared in the shop yesterday. it is called _practice makes perfect: piano
demos no.1_ and duplicates the contents of _cathy's album_ and _cathy's album
too_. unlike the chapter one cds (_if you could see me fly_ and _passing
through air_), this cd does not contain the two "babooshka" demos or "another
day" (the duet with peter gabriel from the bbc special). there are only two
advantages to this cd as i can see: 1) it has all of the cathy demos to date
(excepting "organic acid") on one cd and 2) the packaging. the cover is a
**beautiful** (and i mean **beautiful**!) drawing of KaTe done with pastels.
i think that the drawing alone is almost worth the sticker price (and may
eventually be the reason why i will purchase this item). the back cover has
another pastel drawing: a small "KaTe-in-a-dunce-cap-holding-the-world" pic-
ture that is also quite cute. final recommendation: definitely a colleKTor's
item. if you already have the demos on cd, don't bother. if you don't and
want to get them, this is the item you want to buy as it has all of them (with
said exceptions) in one place. and if nothing else, the packaging is **magni-
ficent*.

still searching for the elusive _london 1979_ cd...will report when i know
more...right now though, it seems the only people who know about it is the
cd connection folks in hiedelberg and i don't have a phone number for them
yet...

and just for amusement's sake, suzanne vega appears on the forthcoming grate-
ful dead tribute album called _deadicated_. i listened to her track on mon-
day as well and it sounded pretty good.

finally, one other thing. while auf deutschland, i picked up copies of the
two albums by a band called rainbirds. if you are at all a fan of catchy and
excellent pop music, i highly recommend them. katharina frank has a way with
lyrics that many native-english speakers lack (she sings in english though
they are from berlin) and her voice is quite nice as well. they have two re-
leases so far on polydor called _rainbirds_ and _call me easy say i'm strong
love me my way it ain't wrong_. i do not know if they have been released in
america on polygram, but they should be: the song "blueprint", which was a
very large hit in germany back in 1987, would increase the listenability of
american top 40 radio by at least tenfold. :)

        I just got the new Homeground, what a relief after all the current
controversy!!!  I was happy to see that the pictures came out better than my
4x6 pictures, though some of my 8 1/2 x 11s came out almost as well.  The
pictures of mine that were included are the "car" photo and the picture of
Kate getting the award. 
     Anybody else think that the drawing of Kate on page 27 is one of the BEST
ever?  I also was happy to see the pictures from the "BIG SKY" shoot", which I
had never seen before.  At last pictures from the making of the GREATEST VIDEO
EVER!!! 
        YES the girl on LA was the NUDIE on Castaways.  The full scoop is
available in the latest PEOPLE magazine, which I only read, and didn't buy (No
Kate articles!)


        Does this news of he San Jose Katemas party mean that there won't be
one in LA or San Diego. :-(  San Jose is a bit far for me!!!  I repeat my
monthly request for any SAN DIEGO love-hounds!!!! I know there must be some
out there!!! They don't keep GAFFA here for just me!!!!! 

        IED: Its interesting that you say that W. Reich's later work was
well-organized.  My friend said just the oposite: that it was not well
organized, but contained at least some possibly inovative ideas and the like. 
I will have to ask him more about this, as he seemed really informed so it
seems strange that his opinion seemed oposite of yours.

From: rhill@pnet01.cts.com (Ronald Hill)

        Having just received my first issue of Little Light and then a few
days later received the current Homeground I feel that I really must comment
on the current controversy.  I should point out my prejudices in the matter. 
I have a subscription to Little Light in exchange for the future Cloudbusting
and a "Greatest Hits" set of photos.  On the other hand, I have been a reader
of Homeground for several years, and went to the convention and was able to
meet both Peter and Krys at their home (see the current issue).  
        A few small points, first on the subject of the reactions to the
"PMRC" article.   Little Light's editor's (and some readers) were willing to
believe that the PMRC would list, for example, Saxophone Song, as having a
"reference to bowels".  They then went and reacted in very strongly ways, as
in writing a letter to the PMRC.  I won't debate the reasonableness of this,
as that has already been debated.  But I find it strange that after believing
the PMRC capable of these incredible statements these same people went on to
defend much of the PMRC's actions with such passion.  On the other hand, if
the reaction to the article was shared by as many people as LL says, then
perhaps a statement of regret over this from Homeground may be appropriate. 
It seems to me that, however, HOMEGROUND may not be fully aware of the size of
re-action, as most of us also were not until the latest issue.  It also seems
to me that the editors of LL probably have a larger sense of the re-action as
they probably got mostly letters from people who agreed with them. 
     More disturbing, to me, then is the somewhat anti-British parts of the
magazine.  In the line "...tell us that Army Dreamers had been removed from
BBC playlists during the way, and they show-up Homeground's essential
hypocrisy of going after Americans while ignoring their own, government
sponsored 'censorship.'"  what bother's me is that they didn't say "their own
government's" (as in: What are these BRITISH people doing commenting on
American affairs).  Combined with the fact that they chose out of all the
letters they say they got to print they printed (out of two on the matter) a
letter that made fun of British spelling and that they also made fun of the
British spelling in saying that the Homeground people had a "great sense of
Humour [sic]" - seemingly a double insult to their sense of humor and
spelling.  It should be pointed out that Kate is indeed British and that she
has, in fact, commented somewhat on American actions (I.E. Pulling Out The Pin
and in several interviews).   It should also be pointed out that their
comments ("errors" and all)  are shared, and probably gleaned from, many
Americans including most of the rock press.  Also these comments are no doubt
reflective of many people outside the U.S.  In any case these comments,
especially, are in no way deserving of the kind of spiteful remarks that were
given in the Little Light magazine, the kind of response given in the "Going
Deep South" article in the current Homeground.  
 
        Which brings me to my main, and only really important point.    What
bothers me is not the opinion's stated in the magazine- after all everybody is
entitled to their opinions and to their mistakes (before being corrected)- but
the tone of the whole thing.  At worst Homeground is guilty of printing
something without realizing the controversy it would cause, and then not fully
apologizing.  They did call the people who mis-read the article "humourless"
but even this seems lessened by their closing remarks "Calm down chaps and
give us a grin."  Does these "sins" really make them worthy of such comments
as: 


HOMEGROUND - The international journal of poetry and bleeding hearts with an
excellent page of Kate news and outstanding artwork, as well as a great sense
of humour (sic). 

...it would be a mistake to argue with people whose opinions we have no
respect; the surest sign that you haven't any sense is to argue with another
who hasn't.  [BUT BY THE CONTENT AND EDITING OF THE MAGAZINE AREN'T THEY???"]

We have friends, but they have not been made by silence of pussyfooting (if we
have enemies, we will not placate them).  We may not be a loved newsletter ...
but we are a respected one. 



And much of the rest of the issue consist of not-so-subtle attacks on
Homeground. I enjoy Kate and the discussion of Kate because it seems to very
much avoid (and indeed be "against") this type of spitefulness and pettiness. 
     After the 60s "rock" music, to me, went in two directions - the serious
and spiteful (either as a reaction to or a twisting of the 60s itself) and the
happy and shallow.   Kate's music is among the few to really "rebel" against
this attitude by being "serious" and yet still being basically "happy" and
positive.  Kate and her fans have proven that you can discuss very charged
issues without resorting to pettiness and spitefulness.  This to me, is truly
reflective of what was best about the 60's.  The other side is a reflection of
why, in, some ways, the 60's ultimately failed, as young people then had the
good reaction towards each other, and the negative towards those older.  It is
also a reflection of to much of life today.  I don't wince at it, and am not
immune to it, but I don't want it in the discussion of Kate, which should be,
and always have been, done in a tone that is reflective of Kate.
     I have never minded the heated discussions of Kate's work on Love-Hounds
and other places, but they have never reached this level.  And they are not
done in such a well-thought-out, spiteful way.   Putting in down like this
reminds me of what Kate has said about her music "It's going to be like that,
you know, forever".
        The Homeground people have given all of us so much, and the news
section of LL is full of stuff that came straight from the convention.  Could
they, for this ONE thing, really be deserving of this type of treatment.  
        As I touched on earlier, I wonder if they considered what Kate's view
on this might be.  Leave aside the fact that Kate knows, has worked with, and
presumably likes, the Homeground editors.  Leave  aside Kate's possible
reaction to the "British" comments.  Does anyone really think Kate would agree
with the TONE of a newsletter like this?   I suspect her reaction would be the
same as most people who read it (including also, I suspect, many of the people
who were "fooled" by the article to begin with, yet maybe recognized the fact
that they shared at least part of the blame.).  I think that reaction might be
one of simple disappointment and sadness that this appeared in a Kate Bush fan
magazine.  This reaction is the reaction of myself and the one fan that I
showed this to. 
        I will continue my subscription until it runs out, hopefully it will
take on a more positive note.

Subject: Photo descriptions (AGAIN!) 

1990 Kate Bush Convention Photos  
-------------------------------- 
SIXTH VERSION - UPDATE 04-25-91   
  
 
         
      What follows is my attempt to describe the photos from the convention. 
Since some people have and some people haven't read my previous descriptions
of my experience and some people were and some people were not there when
these photos were taken, I will assume that you don't know anything and try to
describe each picture as well as my *limited* memory will allow.  If anybody
has more info please send me a message and I will try to repost this file with
the updated info (does anybody have a transcript?).  Each new paragraph
describes the next photograph.  Special thanks to Ray Russel for help me sort
em out!  Thanks to Jorn Barger, Andrew Marvick, Andy Semple, and Gregory
Bossert for more info on group shots.  
      This version marks the photos available as GIF and IFF files on Genie
and, hopefully, the Love-Hounds computer network archives.  These photos are
perceded by an astrick with the name of the file as in * FLOWERS.GIF.  These
files are mainly 640x400 16 color photos done off of 8 1/2 by 11 enlargments
so that the quality is quite good.  They are also available as IFF files,
please contact me directly.    
          
        Outside, waiting for the doors to open.  
        The stage.  Many of these early photos came out slightly too dark.  
Sorry.   
     The room starts filling up  
        Introductions   
        Auctioning off Kate's coat.  (I didn't win!)   
        The view from behind me.   
        The first band.  Kinda a rock-dance band if I remember.   
        Crowd shot in front of me. (Only in a few sets, I had a couple of misc
 shots that I didn't want!)  
        Another performer (notice I have now snuck into the middle!, I was 
right behind all those rude people who stood up.)   
        Shot from behind me!  See any faces you know????? I was going to type 
a rude comment about somebody, but it might be someone you know so I won't!  
        Another performer, I believe this was the one that did a great version
 of "Infant Kiss" (but don't quote me!).   
        Del Palmer.   
        Del auctions off a tour badge.   
        Dancers.   
        One of the Kate videos.   
       * PADDY.GIF.  Paddy Bush.   
        Jorn Barger coming off the stage after winning a signed video.  He and
 I had made an agreement that if one of us won we would take a photo of the 
other one on stage.  Jorn won, using a ticket that I had gone and bought for 
him!!  I was so upset that I forgot to take his picture until after he was 
coming off stage!  In the background is Neil Calton accepting his award.  
        Setting up the couch   
        Here she is!   
        Kate looks around.   
        Kate plops down!  Right after this is when she made her too-cute  
gesture of leaning forward with her hands on her knees.  I didn't get it. 
ARGH!!!   
        Kate makes a fist??   
        Kate reading some questions.   
        Kate.  
      * SMILE.GIF. Kate smiles.  I would like to think , but don't know, that
she is smiling in response to the audience applauding.  At one point fairly
early she was talking about how she didn't like her first two albums as much
as the later ones.  I shouted out, "Well we love them anyways!" which got
everybody cheering.  As far as I remember, that was the only time that
everybody  applauded in response to something shouted out, and I THINK I got a
photo  right after.  This might be it.

        Kate   
        Kate goes "em?"   
       * FLOWERS.GIF.  Kate gets a gift from the LOVE-HOUNDS.  Kate 
 "thank you".   Following is Andrew Marvick's description: 
        Particularly magical to IED was the photograph of Kate  
at the very moment when she held in her hands the official Love-Hounds  
bouquet (four dozen white roses with a big card saying "TO KATE FROM  
THE LOVE-HOUNDS--USA AND THE WORLD" on it)--in fact, Ron's shot  
perfectly conveys the moment when Kate must actually have been reading  
the card itself (she is looking at the card in the cellophane)--and to  
add to the magic, projected on the video-screens behind Kate is a view  
of the bouquet from another angle, on which can be read the letters  
"FROM THE LOVE-H--"! The shot also shows Dave Cross, who has just  
handed the flowers to Kate and explained who they were from! Just one  
of Love-Hounds' several small but not insignificant moments of glory,  
folks! And all you philocanines who were unfortunately unable to  
attend were in the thoughts of those who could be there. Thanks again,  
Ron, for the great pictures.   
        Kate drinks   
        I think at this point is when she announced the tour.  I am not sure
exactly but she got the flowers, announced the tour, sang, and then left and I
THINK that is what is happening here  
        Kate smiles   
        Kate clears her throat  
        BLURRY.   
        Kate applauds?   
        Kate singing (I think).   
        Kate singing   
        Kate singing  
        Kate smiles as she finishes sings   
        THE CROWD GOES WILD.   
        Kate gets ready to go   
        Kate gets told that she has a surprise waiting for her.   
        Turns around sees the platinum album for the Sensual World.   
       * KATEAWRD.GIF. Kate shows off her prize and thinks "I'm such a lucky
goil" (this is speculation). This is one of my favorites.  This appears in
Homeground 41. 
        Kate with record.   
        Kate sits. DARK  
        Kate thanks record man.   
        Kate sits!   
        Gets up to go.  
        Kate gathers her loot and thinks "wow, I hope I get this much great 
stuff at the tour!" (this is speculation).   
        Kate blurry.   
        Kate REALLY blurry   
        Kate kisses us thinking "this is for that guy who shouted 'we love 
them anyway'" (this is wishful thinking).  
        Kate leaves, out of our lives until the tour.   
          
        * DEL.GIF.  Del Palmer came back after Kate left and signed autographs
for a few people.  I asked him "can I get a photo of you smiling since I don't
have any photos of you smiling".  This busted him up, and he posed for this
shot.  Probably my favorite picture.   
        Del signing autographs.  I asked him if the tour would be playing the 
U.S. and he said they would be playing five shows.  I asked him if they would 
be coming to San Diego, and he said they would only be playing the five shows.
 I gave him my "I love San Diego" T-Shirt, which has a listing of reasons to 
come to San Diego, and asked him to give it to Kate.  I heard later that she 
got it and liked it, but couldn't figure out what all the reasons meant!!!!!  

        A pictures of Ray Russel (fellow San Diego Kate fan).  I only included
 this in a few sets.   
       * LOVENAME.GIF. Love-Hounds united and strong!  Following is Jorn's

        Picture of the above photo being taken.   
        McDonalds shot (only in a few sets).   
          
        The day after the convention a few of us were lucky enough to go to 
the Home of the couple that runs the Homeground fanzine.  These are a couple
of shots on the way.  
        A couple of us waiting for the car to arrive!   
        Our hero! (me)   
        The car arrives.  
        Together at Peter + Krys's house.  I am the one taking the photo.  
Following is Jorn's description:       
  
and at homeground central, starting at the center and working in a clockwise 
spiral around the room:   
   
vickie, ed, chris, nigel kennedy(? uncertain:^), krys, pami, paul, jorn, larry
 (in infamous, reviled black-bart-don't-do-drugs sweatshirt), dave cross,
peter.   
   
dave emceed the Con (he's older than 15, though in this photo you can't tell),
 and paul and pami host the yearly "wuthering hike".   
   
        KATE IN BLUE OUTFIT. AHEM.    
        A couple of more shots of Kate walls.   
       * CAR.GIF. Love-sardines.  This  should be in the next HOMEGROUND.  The
last issue asked "How many Love-Hounds can you fit in a car"  and said that
they would be printing the answer in the next issue.  We got  stuck at the
train station cause the train took off earlier than we were told  and one of
the two-cars driving us there had left!  So we all tried to leave  using just
the one car!  I offered to go in the trunk, but they wouldn't let  me! (I'm
experimental!!).  Anyways, three of us, me + Vickie + Chris, ended up 
spending the night.    This appears in Homeground 41. 
        The next morning at the train station.   
        Waving goodbye.   
  
  
Later that day, I went to a Beatles exhibition in London, and then the next  
day headed out to walk around Welling for a while.    
        2 Shots On the train to Welling   
        Shot of a park near where Kate lives.  I walked around for a couple of
hours to get the feel of British city.  I am normally not able to walk for 
very long without feeling pain and then a bad limp in my left hip, yet on this
 day I didn't feel any pain there at all!!  Excitement, Kate vibes, or ?????  
        Another park near where Kate lives.   
       * FARM.GIF. The public area behind Kate's family farm. (This is the
photo with all the green grass for those with only a few pictures) I didn't
exactly know where I was at first, then I met a nice lady who casually
mentioned that Kate Bush lived over there!  Kate's house is the white one in
the middle.   
       * EASTWIK.GIF.  Our hero (me again). This is a self-portrait, holding
the camera out in front of me.   
  
That's all the photos. I only stayed near the farm for a minute or two.  I 
felt like I was imposing, even though I was on a public street, and was kinda
hoping nobody would see me.  The funny thing is as I was walking back towards 
a pub on the end of the street, Kate and Del drove by!!! I only saw them for a
 second, and wasn't sure it was them at first, but now I am.  They probably 
didn't see me.  Anyways afterwards I went to the pub where I talked to a 
female pub-keeper and she told me I was the most normal "Kate Bush gazer" that
 she had ever seen!  That was a scary thought!!!  The next day I went to
Liverpool to see the Beatles sites, then to Wales to see the place where the
Prisoner was filmed, and then I came home.  A thousand bucks poorer, but
richer in many other ways, as they say.   
  
        I hope you all enjoy these.  I am no John Bush (either in my access to
Kate or my talent!) but I think these are not bad.   
 
 
Apart from the photograph 
They'll get nothing from me 
Not until they let me see my solicitor

&gt;
&gt;How could Kate Bush be related to Madonna's new movie?

Um, didn't I hear about some film (perhaps a reworking of _Wuthering Heights_?)
the soundtrack of which features (already existing) songs by various artists
including KaTe and Madonna?

Isn't Madonna going to be in the next Woody Allen movie - I guess he wanted a
challenge. Hopefully she will have a tiny part and Diane Keaton will star,
with Mia Farrow as supporting actress. Allen, would, of course, play the main
role. Somehow I don't see Kate fitting into this...unless she has changed
direction and is singing old jazz tunes.  :)

If you REALLY like Woody Allen films, mail me.

For me what Diane Keaton is on the screen is sort of what Kate is through the
speakers.

Last time I asked about a Kate Bush bootleg CD...
Well, I have it in my hands at the moment. (Makes typing very hard.)


Here's the info:

Title: Back Side
Label: Observation Records
Cat#:  OB 002
Year: 1991

Tracklisting:

	1	December will be magic again
	2	Warm and soothing
	3	Ran tan Waltz
	4	Full house
	5	The empty building
	6	Burning bridge
	7	Not this time
	8	The Handsome Cabin Boy
	9	Under the Ivy
	10	The Big Sky (Meteorological mix)

The 12"/7" Vinyl records were used as masters for this CD. The singles they
used had lots of scratches...

All titles except 4 were released in the boxed set on the bonus CDs.
Track 4 is the original track from one of her older records.

Are there more Kate Bush bootlegs around? What's their price etc. etc.

&gt;Can anyone tell me if there are any other albums by T'Pau besides 'Bridge of

&gt;love the lead vocalists' voice and when I was in Tower Records this past week-
&gt;end, all they had in stock was 'BOS'.

WOW! Another KaTefan who likes T'pau too! (does that make two of us?)

T'pau have released two albums (in the UK at least): "Bridge of Spies"
(which I heard was just called "T'pau" in the US coz somebody screwed up
the artwork between here and there) and "Rage". The good news is that
after more than two year's silence, a new T'pau album ("Promise") will
be released in the UK on June 3rd. Dunno if/when it will be released in
the US.

Despite the fact I've got five KaTe albums, on as purely subjective and
personal basis, my favorite album is still "Bridge of Spies". Carol
Decker (lead vocalist) isn't (of course) in the same league as KaTe,
but she makes up for it with her wonderful energy and power. And I
always thought T'pau's production was always great - nothing like as
imaginative as KaTe's (again, of course) but very competent indeed.

"Now, right or wrong they never walk alone,
 How lucky are the few who know where they belong"
 - T'pau, "Friends Like These".

Believe it or not, I've been in contact with Jeff of _Little Light_,

position of "official representative of Love-Hounds to CBS."  As soon

&gt;Subject:      a retraKTion, a new bootleg and more sTuff
&gt;
&gt;second, as i mentioned on monday, i took a look at that new bootleg cd that
&gt;appeared in the shop yesterday. it is called _practice makes perfect: piano
&gt;demos no.1_ and duplicates the contents of _cathy's album_ and _cathy's album
&gt;too_. unlike the chapter one cds (_if you could see me fly_ and _passing
&gt;through air_), this cd does not contain the two "babooshka" demos or "another
&gt;day" (the duet with peter gabriel from the bbc special). there are only two
&gt;advantages to this cd as i can see: 1) it has all of the cathy demos to date
&gt;(excepting "organic acid") on one cd and 2) the packaging. the cover is a
&gt;**beautiful** (and i mean **beautiful**!) drawing of KaTe done with pastels.
&gt;i think that the drawing alone is almost worth the sticker price (and may
&gt;eventually be the reason why i will purchase this item). the back cover has
&gt;another pastel drawing: a small "KaTe-in-a-dunce-cap-holding-the-world" pic-
&gt;ture that is also quite cute. final recommendation: definitely a colleKTor's
&gt;item. if you already have the demos on cd, don't bother. if you don't and
&gt;want to get them, this is the item you want to buy as it has all of them (with
&gt;said exceptions) in one place. and if nothing else, the packaging is **magni-
&gt;ficent*.

I wonder how bootleggers can have CDs made.  I mean, it takes a lot of 
capital to build and equip a CD plant--maybe CD manufactures take small
special orders and don't investigate exactly what music they're reproducing.

Subject: con message

Chris here,

    Ocasionally we are able to find a bottle to stuff our mail in, and 
toss it out into the electronic ocean.

    In re: The "Kate Message" played at the convention. Did it sound any
thing like this?

        "Hello. This is Kate Bush."

        "Firstly, I think I should say that I am really honoured indeed
        that this event is taking place here to-night. I believe that some
        of you have come a long way, too, and that means a lot to me. I
        hope that none of you will feel that you journey's been wasted."

        "I'm talking to you from my studio and we've just started recording
        the next album. It's due to be released in the autumn and I'll be 
        working throughout the summer to get it finished. It's almost to
        talk about music before it's been recorded properly, but I could
        say that this album is different again from the last one. Perhaps
        it's more positive, but that's for all of you to say really when
        you hear it."

        "Several of the musicians featured on the last album will be playing
        on this one and we're recording out in the country so we'll have
        a good atmosphere - relaxed. When we know the actual release date
        I'll obviously let you know."

        "And thank-you, again. Good-bye."


    This message was sent by Kate to the 1984 Canadian Bush-Con. I edited
out the references to Dale Sommerville. I'd hope that they didn't play this
message, trying to give the impression that Kate sent it to them. I fear
that this may be the case. A couple of undisputable facts about Kate:

    She doesn't respond to people trying to commercialize her.
    She doesn't usually respond when she is working on an album.

    As I said, I hope I'm wrong.

Subject: another day

Vickie here. Someone asked for this awhile back and if anyone posted
it I didn't see it. My apologies if this is a repeat.


                        Another Day      written by Roy Harper

Peter:
      The kettle's on, the sun has gone another day.
      She offers me Tibetan tea on a flower tray.
      She's at the door, she wants to score,
      She dearly needs to say,

Kate: 
      I loved you a long time ago, you know,
      where the wind's own forget-me-nots blow
      but I just couldn't let myself go
      not knowing what on earth there was to know.
      But I wish that I had,       
      'cos I'm feeling so sad
      that I never had one of your children.

Peter:
      And across the room inside a tomb
      a chance is waxed and wanes.
      The night is young, why are we so hung up
      in each others chains.
      I must take her, I must make her
      while the dove domains
      and feel the juice run as she flies
      run my winds under her sighs
      as the flames of eternity rise
      to lick us with the first-born lash of dawn.

Kate:
      Oh really my dear
      I can't see what we fear
      sat here with ourselves in-between us.

Peter:
      And at the door we can't say more
      than just another day

Kate:
      And without a sound
      I turn around
      and I walk away.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, it's a bit obscure, but still very moving. For those who haven't
seen the video from the Kate Christmas Special, here's a discription:
When K&amp;P did this live, they sat opposite each other at a kitchen table,
in character, wearing the most bored, ho-hum, who cares, expressions on
their faces. Between them, on the wall like a framed painting, is a video
screen showing the characters as feeling, hurting, anguished human beings
also sitting at a kitchen table. It's interesting. The foreground characters
are acting the way a lot of people act when they're hurt. Put on an act and
pretend it doesn't affect you. The background characters are acting out the
emotions that the foreground characters are keeping bottled up. Pride keeps
the couple from saying "I'm sorry" and trying to work it out. Love is lost.
It's all very wasteful and sad.

Subject: Dan Welch's Female Singers (Jane Siberry)

Vickie here. I'm taking full advantage of my ability to post because
it may be weeks before I have another chance. Maybe not, but you never
know. Dan Welch was looking for female singers and lots of people
posted interesting answers. I never did get around to posting anything.
Silly me, since it's my passion and (unpaid) profession.
I HAVE to respond to this though:

&gt;   - I was surpisingly disappointed in Jane Siberry.  The album of
&gt;     hers that I found was _No_Borders_Here_, and I thought it was
&gt;     not really that inventive, more weird-for-the-sake-of-weird
&gt;     like Laurie Anderson (another non-favorite of mine).  Did I
&gt;     choose the wrong album?

Do you really get no enjoyment from songs like "Extra Executives",
"Symmetry" or "Mimi On the Beach"? Doesn't "Dancing Class" or "You
Don't Need" move you in any way? Have you listened to "Map of the
World (Part 1)" on headphones? Have you tried to listen to the lyrics
to any of the songs?  Please, please, please try again.

Jane is subversive. Female vocals are my passion, yet we had two
of her albums around the house for months before I really paid
attention to them. The albums were _The Speckless Sky_ and _No Borders
Here_ and I thought they were "pretty normal" (!) and even though a friend
tried to get me to pay attention to the song "Vladimir-Vladimir" I wasn't
interested. Like you, I thought it was just "weird for weird's sake".

Then I saw a video interview with her and realized how interesting &amp;
smart she was. I then went back and REALLY listened to TSS and NBH.
My GOD! I couldn't imagine what was WRONG with me that I hadn't
heard the sheer brilliance of her art. I listened to the albums over
and over again and they just kept getting more amazing. The music, the 
lyrics, her voice...she's a true genius and why I failed to realize that
I don't know. The point is, I missed it at first and I thank the Gods
of Good Music that I finally did hear what had escaped me before.
By the time _The Walking_ came out I was a true Janefan and knew that
it would be great, but when I first heard it...I shook my head in awe.
It's a timeless masterpiece on (nearly) the same level of The Dreaming.

All of Jane's albums are brilliant, you just need to give them a chance.
You need to be open to the magic I suppose. If it should hit you, you'll
hear all the little nuances &amp; subtle inflections of her voice, the odd and
wonderful things the musicians are doing within the odd and wonderful songs,
how she packs her all songs with insightful slices of wisdom and humor.
Jane writes the best lyrics this side of Kate Bush. Some are halarious,
some are excruciatingly sad, some are downright obscure. All are thought-
ful and thought-provoking.

There's so much to be found in every single one of her songs. Yes, even the
early ones. _Jane Siberry_, _No Borders Here_, _The Speckless Sky_, _The
Walking_, and _Bound By the Beauty_ are all full of truly great songs
that will amaze and delight those who are willing and able to appreciate
them. Perhaps, like I was, you're not "ready" yet. Keep trying. Jane is 
intelligent, wise, funny, emotional, interesting, and very, very talented.

Subject: Not This Time

Vickie here. I tried to find my original post about NTT but couldn't
find it. As long as the subject is fairly current, I'd like to jump 
in again with my interpretation, mainly because to me it's a song
with a very important social and emotional message.

IMHO, it's a song about a battered woman who can't seem to break
away from the husband/lover (?) who's treating her so badly. She
finally comes to a decision that she must make the break to save
herself.
 
As with most Katesongs, we have to fill in our own details on background
information and situations. The lyrics I hear are slightly different from
either Peter Manchester's or Kate Bush Complete. 


       Not This Time 
       Kate Bush

&gt;       Oh with a mind that renders everything (in)sensitive
&gt;       What chance do I have here?

If the word is "sensitive" then she's talking about herself. She is a
person who sees things in a gentle way and the relationship she's in
threatens to make her into a hard and cynical person. If the word is
"insensitive" (which is what I hear), she's talking about _him_, but
the meaning is the same. How can she remain true to her gentle nature
while she's with a man who doesn't know the meaning of the word "gentle"?
  
&gt;       Put an end, put an end
&gt;       Put an end to every dream

She might as well forget any dreams she has of a decent and happy
life as long as she's in this relationship. _He's_ putting an
end to all her dreams.

&gt;       When you're near I fear you
&gt;       And I forget myself

The word is definitely "fear"..I hear it very clearly. Listen
closely to how she sings the word. Quavering..the character is
scared. She has to forget all about herself and become totally
subservient when he's around, or else she'll get beaten. Of course,
she might be abused no matter how she acts.

&gt;       Not this time baby
&gt;       Not this time
&gt;       Not this time baby

She's trying to get up the courage to leave him for good. Here she's
still a bit timid and unsure, though the second "baby" has a slight 
hard edge to it. Almost cold and calculating.

&gt;       I dunno why I give in but I do every time
&gt;       And here I am a'wondering why I did it again

She's always given in to his demands, she's always been meek and she's
always gone back to him. For the first time she's questioning what's
wrong with her that she can't stand up for her own rights.

&gt;       Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh
&gt;       Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh
&gt;       Toor-ee-ohhhhh must I say
&gt;       To keep me going, to keep the shit away

This Irish phrase is sort of a personal mantra. Perhaps it reminds her
of good times in the past. Probably from before she met this jerk!

&gt;       I don't know what it is
&gt;       Every time you're near
&gt;       I fear you
&gt;       And I forget myself
&gt;
&gt;       No, not this time baby
&gt;       Not this time you won't
&gt;       Not this time
&gt;       Not this time darling

He'll never abuse her again, she's finally made up her mind.
She's finally gotten up the courage to leave him and start her life anew.
The relief in her voice is apparent and the shouts of jubilation are 
almost chilling in their intensity.

&gt;       C'mon, we all sing 

Simple lyrics don't convey all that's going on in the last half of
the song. Her voice gets stronger and more confident, and there
are lots of voices swirling about. Actually, sometimes I hear the
shouts of jubilation at the end as screams of insanity and a possible
alternate interpretation is that she can't stand his beatings and abuse
anymore and kills him in a fit of passionate self-preservation. The
line "Not this time you won't" supports this. Who knows? Maybe Kate saw
_The Burning Bed_ right before writing this song.

Whatever, it's way too short and I love it.


Well, I think I'll go back into hiding for a few more weeks...

Subject: Re: Kate-Kate-Kate-Kate...

Vickie here. I've missed out on lots of great discussions, but
I'd like to at least get my thoughts in on this one.

Jeffrey writes:

&gt;&gt; Brian writes:

&gt;&gt; Look, I like Kate too, but she's not the only game in town.  
&gt;&gt; I was hoping I'd get turned on to something new, or at least
&gt;&gt; discussions on a *variety* of artists.
&gt;&gt; Here's an honest suggestion: expand your horizons.

&gt; b)  I've been turned onto more music by more varied artists than from all 
&gt; the other music newsgroups I've read combined.  This includes artists like
&gt; Happy Rhodes, Jane Siberry, Concrete Blonde, and a bunch of others I
&gt; can't think of off hand, but that I would never have known existed if it
&gt; weren't for r.m.g and the people who populate it (thanks, Vickie!).

You're welcome...my pleasure!!

Brian, really, you just need to keep reading and expand your own
horizons. Everyone here is into a wide variety of artists and many of
them get mentioned at one time or another. Certain ones, like Happy Rhodes
and Jane Siberry tend to get emphasized more (by me, certainly) because a 
lot of Katefans (like Jeffrey) are looking for music and lyrics that
comes close to reaching the same level of intelligence, emotion, beauty
and wisdom as Kate's music.

Your turn of phrase is interesting. "...not the only game in town."
One of the nicest things about rec.music.gaffa is that most people who
hang out here don't see music as a game. We're very serious about music.
Some readers are musicians but most of us just know that life is too short
to waste on listening to bad or mediocre music. Music is not a mindless
entity to us. It's a very important part of our environment. We're not
humorless sourpusses either. We like fun music and we like to have fun
while listening to music. If sometimes we sound a bit "over-the-top" it's
because we can't always contain our enthusiasm. And why should we? We're
in a newsgroup/mailing list where it's fairly assured that a large majority
of the readers feel the same way we do. There's a LOT to be enthusiastic
about, why not shout it out?

In my job I'm around music cynics all day long. They're all nice people,
but most have no or bad taste in music. Some think good music is so
impossible to find that they don't recognize it when they hear it.
One fellow, whose job it is to buy alternative music, actually said that
Dead Can Dance was "decent, not great" when I asked him his opinion.
It's really kind of depressing. I work around (not "in") the music
business and yet I've found very few people who actually really love music.
It's a business, it's a product, it's a unit, it's a tool on the way to
market shares, it's a game. It's anything other than something to make 
you laugh, cry, feel pain, anger, love, hope. That music can actually mean
something important in their lives is alien to most of the people I meet.

It's always so refreshing to read gaffa and "come home" to people who
really know and understand that emotions and intelligence are important and
appreciated. Brian, if you've opened a door and entered a world that's too
emotionally complex for you to understand, don't close that door.
Just leave it open a crack and let some of it seep out. Maybe, when you're
ready, you can join us again with a better appreciation of what we're all
about. We're not kooks who mindlessly worship the Goddess incarnate (though
of course, she really Is :-) and shut out everything else. 
We're people who have figured out that music can touch our hearts and
speak to our minds and keep us endlessly occupied with details and
puzzles, opens doors to literature, art, history, politics, sooths us
when we're in sorrow or unhappy, makes us laugh when a laugh is needed,
makes us cry when tears can be theraputic. That's just for starters.
Kate's music can do all of those things for us. Few other artists are 
capable of inspiring so much. There are others (see Jane &amp; Happy posts) but
as Kate herself says: "It is this that brings us together" and for us
it's Kate Bush's music and rec.music.gaffa. It's all really very simple.

Have a GOOD music filled day!!

Subject: Belated Kate Story

Vickie here. I'm coming in a bit late on this discussion, but I have a 
chance to post and I'm taking it.

I became a fan in mid-1981. I had been a fan of Peter Gabriel since 1973.
When his 3rd LP came out I saw the name "Kate Bush" in the credits
(for B-VOX? I didn't know what the hell that was, though I later figured 
it out) but I had no idea who she was. Just a session singer, thought I.
I was penpals with another Genesis fan (I was, up to and including "Abacab")
and she asked me what female singers I was into. None, I had no albums
by females in my record collection, unless Jefferson Airplane counts.
And Fleetwood Mac. I had no albums by solo female artists though.
She sent me a compilation tape with 3 different artists and I put the
tape in and pressed Play:

1) Sally Oldfield-What a pretty voice! Nice. Yes, I like it.

2) Lene Lovich- WHAT IS THIS??? I had never heard ANYBODY like Lene
   before in my LIFE!!! I had never heard anyone doing anything
   weird and silly with their voice before. Her swoops and screams
   and trills and yelps were all new and fascinating to me. It was
   great and I kept rewinding and playing her over &amp; over again.
   I was sure the artist on Side 2 couldn't possibly be anywhere
   near as interesting, even though she'd played with Peter.
   Oh well, I'll turn it over and give a quick listen, then I can
   come back to Lene. Have to get some Lene Lovich albums tomorrow.

3) Kate Bush-ohmygodwhatisthis???????? Well, 30 seconds into the first
   song, Wuthering Heights, and I knew I'd begun a love affair that
   would last me the rest of my life. Words cannot describe....
   Needless to say, Sally &amp; Lene were totally forgotten.
   I played WH over &amp; over &amp; over again and I was actually afraid to
   listen to the other songs because I was sure they would be an
   awful let-down after the sheer brilliance of WH. I shouldn't have
   worried though. They were wonderful of course and the next day I
   went out and bought TKI &amp; Lionheart. I couldn't find N4E though
   my friend sent it to me the next week. I played this tape for
   EVERYone I came in contact with, but no one was interested. I was
   desperate for information about her but had no way of getting it.
   Then my friend sent me a Record Mirror with a cover story on Kate.
   Sat In Your Lap was just being released in England and the article
   was about that. It went into background information too and I was
   astounded to learn that she was very well known in England and the
   rest of the world.  I wrote a letter to Record Mirror and asked them
   to please print my name and address in hopes that sympathetic Kate 
   fans would send me the fan club address (the KBC had been mentioned
   in the article) and give me some more information about Kate. RM did
   print my letter and the first response I got was from a non-fan who
   offered to obtain Kate items in exchange for American bondage magazines!
   Uh, I never wrote him back. The next day I got a second letter and it
   was from Peter David Fitzgerald-Morris. It seems I'm the first American
   fan he'd had a chance to contact. After that I got a flood of letters
   from Kate fans. It was amazing. Everyone was so nice! I immediately
   learned that Katefans are the sweetest bunch of people on the face
   of the earth. I got a job as a truck driver (yes-the "Big Rigs"-I was
   probably the only truck driver in America rolling down the interstates
   to the tunes of "Wuthering Heights", "Army Dreamers" etc.-Kate kept me
   awake many a night) and lost contact with most of them. I didn't meet
   another Katefan in person until I met Christopher in December 1982. 

If anything, my level of love and respect has grown over the years.
The more I found out about Kate, the more in awe I was of her. Everything
about her is so wonderful. Her music (first and foremost), her lyrics,
her artistic integrity, her videos, her voice, her philosophy, her looks,
her childhood, her devotion to her family.....everything about her!

She's my hero!

Favorite album: The Dreaming (Forever &amp; Ever, Amen!)
Favorite songs:  Sentimental-Wuthering Heights, Other-Night of the Swallow
Favorite B-sides: Under the Ivy, Dreamtime, Walk Straight Down the Middle
Favorite Cathy Demo: Tie between Davey &amp; Frightened Eyes
Favorite video: Sentimental-Wuthering Heights, Other-whatever I'm watching
Least favorite album: Don't have one. Whenever I try to make a list like
                      this, Lionheart always ends up at the bottom and, 
                      since I DEARLY LOVE that album, I think like this:

                       The Dreaming
                      The Ninth Wave

                Lionheart           The Kick Inside

            Hounds of Love         The Sensual World

                        Never For Ever

I'm trying to make a circle, or a clockface, something like that.
Anyway, nothing ever gets put last, because all of her albums are
perfect at different times in different moods. They change places
within the circle, only TD remains my constant favorite, followed closely
by TNW.

Subject: Happy-Kate fan - Why buy?


Vickie here. We're using a borrowed phone to post these. We'll get
our mail (i.e. digests), but won't be reading them until after this
is posted. Forgive me if I sound a bit out-of-date.

Re: Happy Rhodes
I just can't keep quiet about this woman. I'm glad to see other Love-Hounds
singing her praises too. I can rave about Happy until I'm blue in the face
but seeing raves reinforced by other KB fans will let people know that I'm
not just making it all up!

In case questions like these are going through anyone's mind:

Why should Kate Bush fans be interested in Happy Rhodes? Why should
Kate Bush fans spend money on Happy Rhodes?

1) Because Happy is herself a Kate Bush fan. Kate has had a deep and
   profound infuence on Happy. The vocal influence is there, though
   Happy was born with the voice she has. Her high voices do often
   sound like Kate's, but it's usually not intentional. She can't
   help it. I say "usually" because there are a couple of songs where
   Happy tried _on purpose_ to sound exactly like Kate. This was done
   as a homage, though. I never thought I'd ever hear anyone imitate
   Kate's high voice successfully, but on the songs "Would That I Could"
   and "Don't Want To Hear It" from _Ecto_ she gives new meaning to the
   word "uncanny" and I've played them for people who swore they were
   unreleased Kate tracks! Happy's low voice is nothing whatsoever like
   Kate's, though many people have likened it to Annie Lennox's.
   Anyway, Happy truly loves Kate's music and she has a deep respect
   for the woman behind the music. Much more can be written about this
   subject at another time. Mainly what I wanted to say here is that 
   Happy is a true Katefan and we should do all we can to support and
   encourage her. Happy is talented enough to become a major artist
   and we can be there every step of the way. Which leads me to:

2) The music is EXCELLENT!! Katefan or not, I wouldn't be pushing her
   so hard on people if I didn't believe in her music. She's not an
   uneven artist with a few great songs, a few good songs and um, lots
   of potential. No, Happy is consistently great. She has released 5
   albums, all amazing. That's 75 songs, none of which I could do without,
   though there are a couple on the early albums I'd love to see re-recorded
   with different instruments. The first four albums were recorded on
   shoestring budgets. She was so strapped for money that she couldn't
   afford to hire any other musicians. Everything you hear is Happy. She
   plays guitar, keyboards and synths, sings and even engineered some of
   the songs herself. It's all done so well that you'd never know. She
   played, recorded and mixed so brilliantly and cleverly that I had no
   idea that she was all alone until Kevin told me. 
   Happy and Kevin saved and borrowed money to make _Warpaint_ as high
   quality an album as they possibly could. She still wrote, arranged,
   played keyboards &amp; percussion and sang nearly all the voices for all
   of the songs, but this time she was able to hire a few other musicians
   to play on some of the tracks. They knew it would cost them a lot of
   money to put out CDs, but they thought it was worth it and were able to
   raise enough money to hire Dr. Toby Mountain to do the digital master-
   ing at Northeastern Digital Recording outside of Boston. The CD sounds
   great because they scrimped and worked (a couple of Happy's most recent
   jobs were working in a gift shop and waitressing at an Italian restau-
   rant!) and saved and borrowed to be able to make it so. Those of you
   who bought Happy's tapes in the last year and a half can be proud in
   knowing that you had a part in paying for _Warpaint_. 
   
  Happy is 25 years old. She has already made 5 musically valuable albums.

Think about it...

Happy's Dreaming/Walking/Security album has yet to be made. She's only
just begun. If _Warpaint_ dies, she wouldn't give up music, but she'd
have to waste precious creative time paying off debts, struggling to
pay common bills (rent, car payments etc.) and then saving money again
to make her next album. It would be tragic! It would be our loss.
Do I want Happy to have a hit? Hmmmmm. Actually, YES! I can't see it 
happening, because I don't think any of the songs on _Warpaint_ are
"commercial" enough to get anywhere near the Top 40, but I have to say
that I hope I'm wrong. Anyone who might sniff and sneer at the thought
of having a hit song would do well to remember that...

Kate was able to make _The Dreaming_ because she had a hit with "Wuthering
Heights"....Jane was able to make _The Walking_ because she had a hit with
"Mimi On the Beach"....Peter Gabriel was able to make _Security_ because
he had a hit with "Games Without Frontiers"....

These hits generated enough money and power to enable K/J/P to do things
their own way without interference in their creative visions.

Poverty and obscurity make great song subjects but don't help artists.
Happy is the kind of artist who, if she did have a hit, would pour the
money back into her work (charities too--she's a big supporter of Amnesty
International) and would hire and help other musicians.

   "I took a little back road to fame. I'm still traveling now, but I'm
   free of shame"  from "All Things" by Happy Rhodes

We can help her get there and be proud of the artist we're supporting.
Buy her tapes. Buy her CD. Write publications and ask them to review
_Warpaint_. Call radio stations and request Happy. Right, they'll never 
have heard of her but it will get her name circulating. Make sample tapes
of various songs and pass them out to friends (if they like what they 
hear and want more they'll have to buy them.) Call record stores and ask
if they have Happy in stock. Again, they'll never have heard of her but
a moment's puzzlement will make more of an impression than never hearing
her name at all. Perhaps you could even get some record stores to carry
at least her CD. We can start a grass roots movement to get the name
Happy Rhodes out to people who've never heard of her. We do have power
in numbers and we're nationwide and international. We can't have much of 
an impact on actual sales until Happy gets a distribution deal and _Warpaint_
is fairly easily available, but we can spread her name around. Hey, look
what word-of-mouth did for _Dances With Wolves_! 

*** Until you've heard the music for yourselves, you have no incentive to
support Happy *** 

To get Happy's tapes and the new CD, write:

Aural Gratification
P.O. Box 8658
Academy Station
Albany, NY  12208

Tapes are $9.99 + $1.50 p&amp;h
The CD is $13.99 + $2.00 p&amp;h

Sure, this is an ongoing (I'll never stop :-) "commercial" plug,
but I'll say it again....

I'd never do this if I didn't believe in Happy's music. The music is
what counts...it's really what's important here. Supporting Happy gives
you lots of great music to listen to now and enables Happy to continue
to make great music for us to listen to and enjoy in the future! I know
her well enough to know that she'd never "sell out" and get boring.
As a matter of fact, one of the reasons Happy has had so much trouble
getting a record contract is that she won't compromise her terms. They
include releasing _Warpaint_ as is. In other words, she wouldn't re-record
it to please a record company. She demands full creative control on all
future recordings too and she wouldn't add or cut something from an album
just because a record company told her to. Happy would prefer to remain
obscure than to jerk around her art at the whim of a record company suit.

Why am I pushing Happy so hard when there are so many musicians out
there who deserve help? Sure it's a personal thing--I'll admit it.
I confess....I'm a Happyholic! I can't get enough of her music. I listen
to her over and over and over again. Each listen is better than the last.

One of the most amazing things about Happy's music is that it may seem very
simple upon casual listening, but the songs grow on you. Then, no matter how
many times you hear them, you'll never burn out or get tired of them.
You're always discovering something new. Not in a complex, technological
way (though there's plenty to be discovered in Happy's guitar and synth
arrangements), but rather, emotions and textures. Songs will affect you
in different ways at different times. Such reasons are why Happy has
earned an honored place beside Kate and Jane in my esteem!

Let's see, if Kate=God and Jane=Jesus then I guess that makes Happy
the Holy Ghost!! It fits--in terms of "obscurity," Happy makes Kate
look like Madonna and Jane look like Sinead O'Connor in popularity. This
is why I'm fervently dedicated to shouting her praises and getting more
people to give her a chance. It's so hard when her music is only available
via mail order. A lot of people (myself included) are allergic to mail
order. Apathy sets in. It's so much easier to peruse the racks of the
local record stores and pick up albums than to send off for something.
All I can say is that, if you will take the time and effort to send off
for Happy's tapes and CD-not to mention spending the money, you will not
regret it. You will be rewarded with music that will last a lifetime.

Larry said it best...timeless and priceless. I couldn't have picked
any better words to describe Happy's songs. 

Remember too...she's a fellow Katefan!

&gt; Since it'll be a little while till we can get there (did I mention I hate
&gt; having classes all the time?) I wonder if anyone has noticed any of Happy's
&gt; music for sale there.  I've seen a lot of posts about mail-ordering her
&gt; things, but is it possible to buy from Tower?  Please e-mail me any
&gt; information.

I WISH!! Believe me, when Happy's music is carried in Tower it will be
cause for all Happyfans to celebrate non-stop for at least a month!

One of the main things I want to stress to people is that Happy is now
working at a "kitchen-table" level. Aural Gratification is a home
operation. We're the ones who can make a difference in getting Happy's
name out to people. Any gains made at a national/international level
will be exciting and wonderful. We have the chance here to follow her
career as it develops and to help her and cheer her on.

Happy released _Rhodes Vol. I_ in 1986. I "found" her mid-1988. Most of
you are just now discovering her and the time will come when other fans 
will be envious of us for having come in so early. I'm serious. Hell, I'm
envious of those in Albany who've been fans since 1986 and got to hear 
_Vol. II_, _Rearmament_ and _Ecto_ when they were first released! It's so 
great to "be there" when albums are brand new. The problem from now on
will be the excruciating wait between albums in the future. The nice thing
is that we already have 5 wonderful albums from Happy to keep us satisfied.

It would be awful if Happy never got any recognition outside the Albany
area. As I said in my other post, I'd love to see her get a hit just so
she can quit struggling to pay the bills and concentrate all her energy
on her music. If that didn't happen, I'd still like to see her get past
obscurity and be at least as well known as say, Jane Siberry is in America.
Jane is very well known in Canada but is considered a "cult" artist here.
Still, most people who are knowledgable about good music have at least
heard of her. That's a decent goal for Happy fans to strive for. Buy the
music, get familiar with it and then tell eveyone you know about it. Spread
the word.

&gt; My Happy-Rhodes CD "Warpaint" arrived in the mail last Saturday.
&gt; For all you doubters out there, I strongly urge you to buy it. I
&gt; haven't yet ordered her cassette tapes, but I will now.  I sure
&gt; wish all her material were available on CD.. she is a very
&gt; talented artist.  The following is a track list of her CD album:

&gt; 1.  Waking up - 4:06
&gt; 2.  Feed the Fire - 4:33
&gt; 3.  Murder - 4:54
&gt; 4.  To Live in Your World - 3:30 (my personal favorite)
&gt; 5.  Phobos - 5:13                 ^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^
&gt; 6.  Wrong Century - 4:22
&gt; 7.  Lay Me Down - 3:51
&gt; 8.  Terra Incognita - 4:33
&gt; 9.  All Things - 4:48
&gt; 10. Words Weren't Made for Cowards - 5:20
&gt; 11. Warpaint - 6:13
&gt; 12. In Hiding - 3:10

It will be interesting to see if your favorite changes. Mine keeps
changing. First it was Lay me Down, then it was All Things, then
In Hiding, then Feed the Fire, then Terra Incognita. Ask me again next
week! All the songs are so good that it's easy for one song to obsess me 
for a while, then I move on to the next one to discover and cherish. 
For instance, when I finally got around to reading the lyrics to Feed the
Fire, and realized (from my conversations with Happy) that it was inspired
by Kate Bush (among others), I was obsessed with it for nearly a week, and
kept rewinding it to play it over and over. My current favorite is Words
Weren't Made for Cowards. It's a truly great song. Though the lyrics tear
at my heart, it's sure to stay my all-time favorite from the album.

&gt; the master tape.  I took the chance and ordered the CD sight unseen
&gt; (well, unheard if you want to be acurate) and I'm astounded by her
&gt; music.  I can't believe that a major record label hasn't jumped on
&gt; this woman yet!!  With her talent, she's sure to be a major artist.

We can only hope so. Tell everybody you know and play the music for them.
If they like it, her name may stick in their brains and they can go on
to tell other people about it. We can start the ball rolling for Happy.
As far as a major label deal, I don't want her to have one unless they'll
leave her alone and let her make the music she wants to make. Artistic
freedom is much more important to Happy than fame and fortune, though
fame and fortune would certainly help let Happy make the kind of music 
she wants to make. 

&gt; can post that.  For those of you who have both the tapes and the
&gt; CD, how to they compare??  Are the tapes near as good as the disk?
&gt; Which is your favorite?

Larry posted a WONDERFUL response to this that I can't top, so I'll just
agree with him that ALL of the tapes are worth getting and that you're in
for many, many treats! It should be telling that you're hearing different
things from different people about which early album is a favorite. For
me it's Ecto &amp; Vol. I (depending upon which one I'm listening to at the
time), for Larry it's Rearmament, for Michael Mendelson it's Vol. II. That
should tell you that they're all "Must-Haves" and it's impossible to 
pick one over the other. You probably understand by now that the early
tapes don't compare in sound quality with _Warpaint_ because of the limited
budgets involved. Once you hear them though, you'll see that it doesn't
matter one little bit! The sound quality isn't bad, just different, and
the songs are so good that you'll soon (hopefully) not even notice.
 
Larry says:

&gt; you have budget constraints.  I'm kind of sentimental towards
&gt; _Rearmament_, myself.  And _Rhodes Vol. 2_ is also a must-hear which
&gt; has been intimated by some as Happy's "weakest" album.  Funny that one
&gt; of the most beautiful, heart-wrenching songs ever written
&gt; ("The Revelation") just so happens to be on that album.  They don't mean
&gt; "weak" in the traditional music reviewer's sense, I'm certain.  It's more
&gt; like _Vol. 2_ is "great," as opposed to the others being "wonderful."
 
No, not weak. Not at all. Not with songs like "Come Here" "The Revelation",
"Where Do I Go?", "Noone Here", "To the Funnyfarm", "Asylum Master" plus
the other 7 great songs. Weak? Who said weak? Not me! I (at one time)
would have called _Rearmament_ weak, but I've seen the light Larry, I'm
sure you'll be happy to know. I came to appreciate the album more when I 
was listening on headphones while pouring over Jeff's lyric sheets. It's so
odd. For the most part, I really liked most of the album before, but
something about it really came across strong while I was looking at the
lyrics. The "magic" finally hit me. I've been listening to it over and over
again. I can't get enough of songs like "The Perfect Irony", "For We 
Believe", "Friend You'll Be", "I Have A Heart", "Because I Learn", "Rhodes
Waltz", "Ally Ally Oxenfree", and MOST especially "'Till the Dawn Breaks"
which has become my new favorite on that album. The other songs are all
great too. I've put aside (for Happy) my distaste for the word "baby" and
gained new respect and love for the song "Baby Don't Go" and also realized
that the ONLY way to listen to the song "Dreams Are" is through headphones.
The two characters interact via your brain and it's a wonderful feeling!

I can even listen to "Box H.A.P" and "The Issue Is" without gagging now.
The synth sounds she used on those particular songs used to irritate the
hell out of me, but I found out that she's a huge Wendy Carlos fan so
their use makes more sense to me now. To be honest, I'd still love to see
those two songs re-recorded sometime. The songs really are very good and
Happy's voice is utterly beautiful.

Michael writes lots of nice stuff about the early tapes, plus:

&gt; If you haven't already ordered your copies, I'm not exactly sure how you
&gt; have been living with yourself on a day to day basis.

Yeah! What he said! (she says as she's rolling on the floor with laughter!)

&gt; As for the possibility of producing the earlier work on CD, she said
&gt; there was a good chance Ecto would get done (eventually) but that the 
&gt; other 3 might be made into a "best of" project.  PLEASE NO!!!!  There are
&gt; no songs, at least on I and II, that bear omission!

Yeah! What he said again! (Thanks Jeff) This "Best of" business will be
addressed. How can you pick a best of when all the songs are so good?
If Happy were really going to do such a thing I'd want to make sure I got 
my opinions in. I could pick the songs I'd want to see included, but it
would certainly be painful to have to leave any off.

By the way, in case I've forgotten to give this information...

For those interested:
To get Happy's tapes and the new CD, write:

Aural Gratification
P.O. Box 8658
Academy Station
Albany, NY  12208

Tapes are $9.95 + $1.50 p&amp;h
The CD is $13.99 + $2.00 p&amp;h

Albums:
Rhodes Vol. I  1986  \
Rhodes Vol. II 1986   |- A GOOD year for Happy fans in Albany! 
Rearmament     1986  /
Ecto           1987
Warpaint       1991
75 very excellent songs are on these 5 albums.

All are well worth the price. The first three will most likely become
collectors items, especially if she goes ahead with that CD project.
(still far in the future though, if it happens at all)  

I think that's all for now. DAMN, I can't wait till we get our phone back
on! The recession hit our household pretty hard but at least we have it
much better than a lot of folks. Chris hasn't worked since December, but
he's doing free-lance computer-graphics training and I still have my job
so we're keeping the rent paid and the electricity on. There's little chance
of our becoming homeless so our situation is far better than many unfortunate
people. The phone bill had become too much of a burden and was a luxury we
couldn't afford, so it was cut off. Once Chris has a regular job and we
pay the three months we owe, we'll be back on line.
 
Till next time we get access...

Hi, 

I posted this yesterday but I haven't seen it so I am trying the e-mail route.
I hope some of you find it interesting. So here goes...
----------------------------
Kate Bush is mentioned several times in the article on Alek Keshishian, the
director of 'Truth or Dare', in the most recent Rolling Stone. This guy
did a pop opera performance piece based on 'Wuthering Heights' at Harvard,
and his work there was considered so good by Madonna, that she decided to hire
him for her movie. According to the article during the time when WH was 
performed at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge 'no Kate Bush records
could be found in the greater Boston area'. So he probably did a good job.

Has anybody seen this production, or is it available on video? Was there any 
discussion about it in 'gaffa' when it happened?

Thanks for any info,

Angelos

For me what Diane Keaton is on the screen is sort of what Kate is through the

I was just on the phone with some folks in California who publish tour
posters. While chatting, I asked the innocent question "do you have any
Kate Bush posters for sale?" expecting a quick, sorry no, we only do US
stuff......

The answer? Well, it surprised me! How about:

	"You know, funny you should ask that, 15 minutes ago, we were
	comissioned to do a Kate Bush poster."

Now, knowing that they are in the business of TOUR posters. I will let
you draw your own conclusions....

The person I talked to said, there are no further details at this time.
I told them I want to buy a Lithograph of this poster whatever it is
going to be. I also mentioned they may get tons of phone calls if I
tell everyone this &amp; it was requested that I go ahead and tell but
please don't say who they are just yet. (They want to get the details
worked out....)

More details as soon as I get them....

I've finally got (big thanks to Judi, here) two of KaTe's bootleg CD's
"Passing Air".. err, I mean "Passing *through* Air" and "If you could
see me fly!"  This is great!! I haven't had the chance to listen to new
KaTe songs (new to me, anyway) since I got her boxed set.  The recording
quality isn't that great, as there are lots of snaps, crackles and pops,
but I just pretend that I'm eating a bowl of rice krispies when I'm 
listening to it and everything is ok.

I don't know if anyone else is trying to find this, but I've been looking
around the SF Bay Area for both disk for quite a while now.. to no avail.
So where do they show up, you ask??  Of all places, Tuscon, Arizona!!
In any case, a store there "PDQ records and tapes" (881-2681) apparently
got six copies.  I haven't any idea whether or not any are left, but
Judi was nice enough to pick them up and mail them to me.

I also got (again thanks to Judi) the poster of KaTe where she is in tights.
If you've seen it, I'm sure you know the one I'm talking about.  In any
case, I've taken it in to the local frame-up shop to have it mounted and
framed!  Not much beats waking up to a picture of KaTe on the wall..

We all speak too quickly at one time or another.  Likewise, while I've
been trying to make only measured responses I am sorry if anyone has
felt personally insulted.  I suspect that the best we can hope for is 
to be kind to one another's mistakes.

I certainly agree that Chris's joke was to me quite obviously a joke.
I suspect, however, that the joke may have lost some of it's 
conspicuousness in the translation from The Net to print. 

&gt;    First, it seems, frankly, a little like overkill to this Kate Bush
&gt; fan, to see yet another group coming out with still another Kate Bush
&gt; fanzine. 

For the most part I agree.  Still, I think as long as there is no
single journal widely recognized as voice of American Kate Bush
fandom there will always be room for one more. 

The ideal situation would be to have a single official fan club and
newsletter: The Kate Bush Club.  Chapters in each country could
contribute their own pages of local interest.  Sadly the KBC  
can barely seem muster the activity necessary to maintain it's 
own existence, let alone support the entire fan network.  I have to
say that at this point The KBC should either make the commitment and
get the help it needs to be proper fan club or officially pack it in.

&gt; Bush fan groups throughout the country, when (in his opinion) so much
&gt; more might be done by consolidating forces into one organized entity.

I agree completely and it sounds like The AATHP is making just such an
attempt.  Unfortunately, I suspect that some and perhaps many factions
will chafe at notion of allowing themselves to be organized by persons
from between the coasts, an area that had until recently been considered 
a vast Kate Bush desert.

&gt;    Second, by whose criteria is Scott Shepard (sp.?) a "world famous
&gt; Kate Bush authority"--as the AATHP's flyer advertised--and not simply
&gt; a Kate Bush fan like the rest of us, albeit one who likes to do a lot
&gt; of dealing?

I don't know about "world famous" but he had a lot of rare and
wonderful stuff and he sold some of it at prices that I could just about
double.   Perhaps there is something to be said for living in a vast
Kate Bush desert.

&gt;    Third, IED admits taking offense at this bizarre resentment of
&gt; _Homeground_--which, incidentally, has been _more_ than open in its
&gt; criticism of British censorship for years and years (note, as only
&gt; the latest example, their frankly critical description of the BBC's
&gt; recent policy of "suggesting" that certain songs not be played 
&gt; during the Gulf war). 

I must admit that Homeground really isn't my kind of magazine.  There
are a few too many flights of fancy in there for my taste.  Still, I
didn't have any problem with Homeground in general until fairly
recently.  I felt that some of the items that were intended to deal 
with U.S. news reflected a rather casual attitude toward the facts.  
These reports too often appear to be the effusive recounting of just 
what they've been told by a rather opinionated and -- in some cases -- 
poorly informed source.  

That was particularly so with issue #40 which contained no less than 
three instances of this.  I personally found issue #40 bothersome in
this regard well before I learned the specifics of the flap with
_Little Light_.  I could have set this all aside in an instant were it
not for the fact that issue #40 gave me the distinct impression that
HG is not willing to give those who disagree with them any forum for
disagreement.  Perhaps that will change, I haven't received issue
#41 as of yet.  Still, the fact that HG could not be bothered to allow
the PMRC or LL any space for an honest airing of their positions will
leave me always wondering if I'm getting the whole story from HG.

&gt;    Finally, perhaps IED _should_ be slower to anger when hearing about
&gt; fans bothering Kate for endorsements. Nevertheless, it does seem at
&gt; least a little bit tacky of this group of Ohio fans to go about  
&gt; systematically heckling Kate Bush over the phone--by one Love-Hound's own
&gt; account _many_ times, right up till the last moment--just to extract
&gt; from her what could only have been (and by early reports was) a  
&gt; forced, unenthusiastic, rote endorsement of their activities?

This may be a misunderstanding caused by my own poor recollection and
reporting of what I was told at the convention.  It was, after all, a
busy day.  Hopefully I've got it right now.  

In fact nobody at AATHP called about the convention greeting, their 
request was sent in writing to The Kate Bush Club.

Call me old fashioned but I view it as part of The KBC's task as an 
'official' fan club to act as a buffer between Kate and the tons of 
fan correspondence that she must receive.  Maybe they don't see it 
this way but I think that includes a certain responsibility to respond 
in circumstances like these, even if its just to say, "Sorry, Kate 
can't be bothered with your silly request right now, she's off getting 
her face licked for another episode of The Comic Strip."

They sent several letters with no response from The KBC.  Before long 
responses started arriving from other artists.  Not wanting Kate to look 
bad they tried making contact through a friend at Columbia.  This friend
made the contact with Novercia and thus the message was delivered (on 
paper, not on tape as some have seemed to assume). 

&gt; IED would love to start from 
&gt; scratch, shake figurative hands and continue in peaceful coexistence from 
&gt; here on out. Perhaps some kind of coordination of Katemas activities could 
&gt; even be arranged.

Sounds like a fine idea to me.  I doubt that we'll ever agree on
everything but we can at least agree to disagree. 

I'm sure they'd like to co-ordinate Katemas but I think the video 
party they are planning has been moved out into August due to 
scheduling conflicts.

Thanks for giving this further consideration after your initial
reaction, Andy.   I think Kate Bush fans everywhere have a common
interest that is much stronger than any individual differences in
opinion that we may have and your message reflects that.  It is 
this that brings us together.

I'm afraid I'm responsible for starting this misguided rumour that the
"Running Up That Hill" video was too erotic for the U.S. market.  I
made this assumption years ago before the video was released in the
U.S. when an acquaintence of mine, who had seen the video long before
I was able to see it, told me that it was like the "Hammer Horror"
video (which is far more shocking in its eroticism than the "Running
Up That Hill" video).  This comparison of the RuTH video with the
"Hammer Horror" video, combined with the knowledge that EMI-America
had told me that there were problems with "suitability" of the RuTH
video, led me to conclude that the video was too erotic for the
American market.  I passed on this news and my assumption (though I
told him it was only my assumption, and not a proven fact) to Peter
Morris of Homeground via a phone conversation.  He has apparently
continued to pass on this rumour ever since.

The truth of the matter, however, was told by John Carter Bush at the
Kate Bush convention in November of '85, so Homeground should also be
aware of the accurate reason for the U.S. consorship of the real video
for RuTH.  It *is* true that MTV refused to play the real video for
RuTH.  Their refusal to play the real video lasted for the period of
time that the song was in rotation on MTV.  During this time they
played only the Wogan TV clip.  Once the song was taken out of
rotation, they started playing the real video in altrenation with the
Wogan clip.  The reason for their refusal to play the real video,
however, was not due to any eroticism in the video, but rather due to
the fact that the video was not lip-synched.  MTV has (or at least
had, at the time) a policy that "breaking" artists who have not yet
achieved popular success in the U.S. market, must appear to sing in
their videos.  MTV took this complaint to EMI-America, which took the
complaint to the Bush family, which decided to send EMI-America a tape
of the Wogan appearance to placate the philistines in the U.S.  MTV,
now happy with a video which fit nicely into their pigeon-hole for
"breaking" artists, promptly put it into rotation.  EMI-America
distributed both videos to other TV stations, giving the stations the
choice of being either philistines or bastions of taste and culture.
A year later, MTV, in their infinite wisdom and hypocracy, nominated
for best video by a female artist Kate's real video that they had
previously refused to show.

I hope this sets the record straight!

I'm so happy to hear this!  Makes all those hours of backing-and-forwarding
with my walkman, hunched over the keyboard, worthwhile!  I know that seeing
the lyrics (or even just fragments) has increased my appreciation of so
many songs. 

wrt "Friend You'll Be," I was listening to it last night (wasn't even
paying much attention, as I'm studying for finals), and I heard the
first line of the song perfectly clearly.  I have no idea why the
words escaped me every time I tried to transcribe it.  As I recall, it's
"I'm influenced by my friend," or something very close to that (I didn't
write it down)

&gt;I can even listen to "Box H.A.P" and "The Issue Is" without gagging now.
&gt;The synth sounds she used on those particular songs used to irritate the
&gt;hell out of me, but I found out that she's a huge Wendy Carlos fan so
&gt;their use makes more sense to me now. To be honest, I'd still love to see
&gt;those two songs re-recorded sometime. The songs really are very good and
&gt;Happy's voice is utterly beautiful.

I never found the synth sounds on these annoying at all.  Maybe it's because
Happy's vocals and lyrics are so beautiful.

Just a point of interest:

Vickie has mentioned that Happy is now 25 (actually, when will she be
26?  In the letter she sent me in August, she said she was 25).  If you
put two and two together, you realize that Happy's first three albums
came out when she was ~20.  Roughly KaTe's age at the time of the release
of TKI and LH.  Except, of course, that Happy hadn't had the support of
EMI and established musicians like Gilmour for several years.

  Hi folks!

  Thanks, Vickie, for your numerous and lenghthy post concerning Happy
Rhodes. I'd been curious about her stuff as so many love-hounds had
been raving about her thru the digest, but wanted to wait to make a 
purchase until I knew a little bit more about her. Your posts made up
my mind: I'll HAVE to give her stuff a try. Sounds like this will be a
really outstanding find. Any suggestions as to what to try first? 
(Unfortunately, my budget does not allow me to go whole-hog and get it
all at once...)

  A public THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to Lee Hounshell. We traded
a few items lately, and I definitely feel I got the better end of the deal.
I traded him the KaTe in leotards poster for tape copies of "This Woman's
Work" vol. I + II from the boxed set and a vhs tape of Live At Hammersmith
that he made from his laserdisc. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS STUFF! This was the
only way for me to get my hands on these obscure items without buying the
boxed set and the laserdisc, which is impossible for me due to lack of funds
and the lack of a laserdisc player! Lee, I am forever in your debt...
also, he let me tape "Passing Through Air" and "If You Could See Me Fly"
before I mailed the CDs I had purchased for him. I've only had contact
with Lee thru e-mail and once on the phone, but boy, what a SUPER guy...
to me, Lee is the epitome of a true "love-hound" should be. Hope the rest
of you folk that I haven't met yet are just as great.

  If anyone else is in desperate want of "Passing Thru Air" and "If You
Could See Me Fly", a place here in Tucson has the CDs for $35 each. Let
me know, and I'll see if we can work it out to get them for you. Others,
tho, have mentioned on the net that they can get them for $25 or so...
that sounds like a better deal if they can get more that one copy.

  Also- I have received a couple of flames concerning my KaTe vs. Madonna
joke. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend anybody. It was simply a ha-ha-
funny concerning my own personal opinion. Personally, I think KaTe is
beyond words, and Madonna is a overly-commercial female vocalist who fits
nowhere in my personal tastes. But, I realize there are many who DO like
madonna, and I didn't mean to offend anyone. So sorry- 'nuff said.
Now that that is cleared up, PLEASE QUIT SENDING ME HATE MAIL! 

  One last thing- if anyone has the addresses for "Homeground", "Little
Light", and the "Kate Bush Fan Club" and could pass them on to me, I'd
really appreciate it. I had them at one time, but seem to have misplace
them.

  One MORE last thing- I received the new Burning Airlines catalog the
other day. It has some interesting KaTe t-shirts, posters, buttons, and
postcards that may be of interest to neophyte KaTe collectors like myself.
Their address is:

Subject: The Rolling Stone Kate reference


I found the Kate reference in the May 16 issue of _Rolling Stone_
that people have been talking about.  It's on page 56, in an article
about Alek Keshishian, who directed "Truth or Dare", Madonna's latest
film.  Here's the complete mention:

     "He also has no trouble speaking up, as Madonna and her staff
learned.  'Can you put on something less offensive than Styx?' Alex
asks the waitress, a bubbly sort with a Glaswegian accent, who is
startled at the request.  'A place like this hould have on some Kate 
Bush, low level.'
     "It was Kate Bush, in a sense, who helped Alek get his chance with
Madonna, but Kate Bush had not been his first diva.  Cher had been Alek's
first, at Harvard.  It happened in 1985, when the Hasty Pudding Club voted
her Woman of the Year.  Alek, producer of the award show, drew
baby-sitter duty.  Cher's first words to him off the plane were 
'_Parev, inch-bess-yes_' -- 'hello, how are you,' in Armenian.  They
got along famously.
     "With Kate Bush, Alek says he made Harvard history.  As a senior, he
spent $2000 producing _Wuthering Heights_ as a pop opera, with music by
Bush, Billy Idol and Madonna -- the first time a theater piece had ever
been approved as a senior thesis in those hollowed groves.  'He liked
dance music, and Madonna was the queen of the dance divas and had a killer
personality,' a school friend says.  'But she was part of his art at that
point, one of the characters in this grand design of his.'  While the show
was in perfromance at the American Reperatory Theater, a reviewer called
it 'Robert Wilson meets MTV.'  Alek says, 'You couldn't buy a Kate Bush
album anywhere in greater Boston after that.'"

Subject: Pulse!, May 1991


The new issue of _Pulse!_ (May 1991) just arrived at Tower Records,
and there are several mentions of Kate:

1)  A review of the Hammersmith video in the Music Video column.  In fact
the headline reads "Videos from pioneers Gabriel and Bush cause for
celebration."  After discussing Peter Gabriel's _POV_, Barry Gutman
writes:

     "Also a long time coming was the recent rerelease, at an affordable
price, of _Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon_ (EMI Video/19.98 for
videocassette).  This 52-minute performance was videotaped 12 years ago,
only two albums in Bush's careeer; her talents as a dancer, choreographer
and mime made her a natural pioneer in the then-fledgling home-video music
industry.  Video is, in fact, the best medium through which to appreciate
Bush -- even today.
     "I often can't decipher her high, veddy English trill without a
lyric sheet.  But whether reading along or not, it's very easy to appreciate
her bewitching countenance, fluid body English and bold, dramatic,
strikingly imaginative conceptual skills.
     "Clad in an array of costumes, including trenchcoat, harem pants,
black leathers, cowgirl suit and sleeveless gown, Bush twirls through
several numbers from her first two albums, supported by two male dancers,
an illusionist/mime, two backing vocalists and a seven-piece band.  She
hasn't toured since this show was shot, and it's not hard to see why --
such a production, at least as lavish as a small-scale musical comedy,
would probably be too expenive to tote around the world.  Rumor has it
that Bush may, in fact, tour in support of her next album.  Meanwhile,
this and her other home video release are highly recommended -- even
more so than her albums -- to newcomer fans as well as the already
converted."

2)  In Yvette Cadeaux's fanzine column, there's a paragraph about
_Lonestar Lionhearts_, the new American fanzine!  This is very surprising
because Tower has never carried this, although they've carried
_Homeground_ for several years now.  Anyway, here's what she says:

     "_Lonestar Lionhearts_ is a lovely Kate Bush journal, edited by
Kevin Hendryx in Austin.  Issue #2, with its black and white glossy
cover photo of the sensual siren in a meditative pose, contains news on
conventions, pen-pals, concerts, videos, reissues, ad infinitum.  And,
as a bonus, you'll also learn
everything-you-never-bothered-to-want-to-know about Suzi Quatro.  And if
you, like me, can't make the connection between Quatro and Kate Bush,
better subscribe to _Lonestar Lionhearts_ before you make a bigger fool
of yerself than you already have.  Send $16 for one-year sub to:
P.O. Box 13414, Capitol Station, Austin, TX 78711."

3)  Someone has mentioned Kate in her Desert Island Discs again.  Andrea S.
Grill, of Washington, D.C., lists:

"5. _The Kick Inside_ -- Kate Bush.  So movingg, so textured and so so
sexy."

For the record, the other nine albums on her list are:

1. Blue -- Joni Mitchell
2. Ella in Berlin/Mack the Knife -- Ella Fitzgerald
3. Dirty Mind -- Prince
4. Greatest Hits -- Louis Armstrong
6. Big Joe Rides Again -- Big Joe Turner
7. Blood on the Tracks -- Bob Dylan
8. Suzanne Vega -- Suzanne Vega
9. Easter -- Patti Smith
10. Shadows on a Dime -- Ferron

Nobody ever seems to post overseas details.
Until then I'm afraid I'll just have to remain ignorant. I suppose I
could write to Happy and ask but if somebody already knew and could
post... remember a fair proportion of regular posters here are outwith

Nice to communicate with you again Vickie. Hope you're able to

Through a "strange phenomena" I ftp'd 0054 and the first article dealt with
The Sugarcubes (my favorite BAND). It dealt with IED's review and what a
great band they are live. (I later read the original "review" where IED
compares them against Kate for some reason)

Anyway...I was just wondering if any of you reviewed their second
album when it came out about 1 1/2 yrs ago.

Organization: fegmaniax anonymous, inc
Subject:      booTleg cds

john vosten informs us that _backsides_ (which had originally been released
as a bootleg lp) is now out as a cd as well. most interesting sez woj...

he also asks what other bootleg cd of KaTe's exists in the world. i know of
the following:

_burning desires_ - a rather poor transfer of the audio track of the hammer-
smith film to compact disc. as the sound is quite poor, the best thing about
this is the picture of KaTe on the backside of the jewel case insert - she
looks much like an english school girl.

_KaTe bush live_ - a rather excellent transfer of the audio track of the
hammersmith laserdisc to cd. sound is crystal clear and quite wonderful. also
worthwhile for the inclusion of the performance of "hounds of love" from the
secret policeman's third ball, the performance of "breathing" from the comic
relief shows (although, unfortunately, the duet with rowan atkinson, "do bears
... in the woods?" is not) and the soundtrack mix of "this woman's work".

_if you could see me fly_ and _passing through air_ - two cds that contain
the cathy demos and the _the kick inside_ demos. sound quality is so-so, but
that is a function of the original recordings made by KaTe. the two discs
were released by chapter one records in, i believe, germany. _if you could
see me fly_ has the two demos of "babooshka" and _passing through air_ has
"another day" from the bbc special, _KaTe_.

_practice makes perfect_ - the newest cd that i know of. conatins all of the
cathy demos and the _the kick inside_ demos on one cd (excepting "organic
acid"). has a beautiful drawing of Kate on the jewel insert. no additional
tracks though.

prices will vary from place to place. for instancee, _passing through air_
has been spotted for $15 in germany, $25 on the east coast of the states and
$80 on the west coast. depends primarily on the legal pressure in the area,
the location relative to where it was imported from and the greed of the shop
owner.

andy gough asks about the label who released _practice makes perfect_. as i
recall (i haven't bought this yet), it is a french label called berklee. i
think though that this is a cover-up as that label is, from what i under-
stand, a "legal" one. i will check on this if you wish...

as for andy's questions regarding bootlegging cds, i'd like to point out that
it is much cheaper to make cds now than lps and that many production houses
do not care what is on the cd as long as they get paid. even the cost of run-
ning your own production plant is not that astronomical either. i have heard
of a small place in philadelphia that will press a short run (say 1000) of cds
for very little money. the problem with bootlegging lies not in pressing the
music, but obtaining it (unless it is concert footage which is easy to come
by).

Well, I was intrigued by all the recent talk about Diamanda, so picked up
The Plague Mass on Saturday and listened to it on headphones while my
husband watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on TV (talk about a weird
experience!).  She's really something, all right, but I found the whole
experience to be much more like performance art than music - are any of
her other albums more musically inclined or are they all like this?

&gt; Do you really get no enjoyment from songs like "Extra Executives",
&gt; "Symmetry" or "Mimi On the Beach"? Doesn't "Dancing Class" or "You
&gt; Don't Need" move you in any way? Have you listened to "Map of the
&gt; World (Part 1)" on headphones? Have you tried to listen to the lyrics
&gt; to any of the songs?  Please, please, please try again.
&gt; 

OK, Vickie, I'll listen again, I promise, just COME DOWN OFF THAT LEDGE!

I should have mentioned that "Extra Executives" was, in fact, the only
song on the album that I took to right off, but that could be the effects
of working for a large company.  I really get a kick out of "He took a
course in sales -- he's never been the same."

I have, recently, listened to the album a few more times, and it does
grow on you a bit.  The main complaint I have about Jane is that she has
a pretty wimpy voice.  The singers that capture me are the ones with
powerful voices. Bjork from the Sugarcubes is a good example--her voice
sends shivers up and down my spine and various other things.  Diamanda
Galas does the same thing.  Well, with her, it's more like goosebumps
than shivers, but you get the idea.

&gt; Jane writes the best lyrics this side of Kate Bush.

This, I'm highly skeptical of.  But hey, everyone's got their favorites.
(My shameful secret -- I like Patsy Cline.  Don't tell anyone, OK?)

&gt; Perhaps, like I was, you're not "ready" yet. Keep trying.

After listening to Her for several years now, I don't think that there are
very many closed doors in my musical mind any more.  We'll see.

Angelos says:
&gt; Kate Bush is mentioned several times in the article on Alek Keshishian, the
&gt; director of 'Truth or Dare', in the most recent Rolling Stone. This guy
&gt; did a pop opera performance piece based on 'Wuthering Heights' at Harvard,
&gt; and his work there was considered so good by Madonna, that she decided to hir
e
&gt; him for her movie. According to the article during the time when WH was
&gt; performed at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge 'no Kate Bush record
s
&gt; could be found in the Boston area'. So he probably did a good job.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody seen this production, or is it available on video? Was there any
&gt; discussion about it in 'gaffa' when it happened?

yeah, i saw it.  it is certainly *not* on video (at least, not one you could
buy), this was very much a student production.  *big* budget for a student
production, mind you, but that's harvard univ. for you... (envious?  you bet!)
i have done sound design for productions at the loeb theatre (home of the
A.R.T. and many a high tech./low content Robert Wilson style performance), 
and they have a serious sound system, lights, etc.

so anyway, the _WH_ production told the Bronte story in mime/dance, with
*loud* and glorious music in the original recorded versions.  Heathcliff
was represented by Sting, and Kathy by KaTe, of course.  the middle of
the story drifted a bit, as H. and K. left the moors for the big city, 
and turned into Billy Idol and Madonna, respectively.  (hey, Judi, there
you go!)  the set was magnificent:  WH (the house itself) was represented
by a several story tall staircase that looked about to fall over.  the
lighting was beautiful, if a bit heavy on deep blue fills and lurid
colored spots.  the dancing was pretty good -- some powerful group numbers
that were clearly inspired by RUTH (which *was* played on V66, boston's
much lamented indie video channel...).  many people were confused by the
show, since there was no live music or speech.  i was pretty impressed --
i saw it twice in a weekend, and dragged a bunch of people to it the
second time.  of course, what i liked was hearing KaTe at 100+ db.  
i'll have to dig up the program to give an exact list of songs, but the 
ending was _Hello, Earth_ followed by _WH_, and it was pretty much
devastating.  i'm astounded that Madonna would have heard of it or been
so impressed by it -- but i'm glad the Mr. Keshishian is doing well.
maybe a documentary on Kate will be next!?  well, maybe not.

&gt; "no Kate Bush records could be found in the Boston area"

wrong wrong wrong.  he must have been mispelling "Bush" or something; i managed
to find all the albums at Newbury Comics, and Second Coming had the UK _HoL_
before the american release was available.  or, he could have asked me... ;-}

&gt;I wonder how bootleggers can have CDs made.  I mean, it takes a lot of 
&gt;capital to build and equip a CD plant--maybe CD manufactures take small
&gt;special orders and don't investigate exactly what music they're reproducing.

Bootleggers do NOT build their own CD plants.  Nor did they ever build
their own record pressing facilities back when vinyl was all the
rage.  If you really want your very own 80-minute compilation of Kate
on one CD, and are willing to shell out big bucks for it, do the following:

Rent a DAT machine, or (if you want to avoid the conversion fees) a
Sony U-Matic digital tape deck.

Play the Kate songs you want onto your DAT or U-Matic.  Note the SMPTE
indexes (hour, minute, second and frame) at which the tracks start and
end.

Prepare some camera ready copy.  You probably won't want to shell out
for more than a generic four-panel thing unless you've got MAJOR
dollars to produce a real booklet with.  On the other hand, you could
just go for a cardboard sleeve and skip the jewel box entirely.  I
don't know what the savings are, so I'll assume you went for the jewel
box option throughout this article.

Go to a CD pressing plant.  If you made a DAT master, tell them you
want it converted to Sony format.  They might do the SMPTE indexing
for you, but I don't know...  Give them your artwork and $3000.

Come back in a week.  You'll have 1000 copies of your new
masterpiece waiting.  Do not sell them, that's terribly illegal.  You
could give them to your friends for a small donation though.  You *DO*
have 1000 friends, right?

(In other words, you can get 1000 CDs made for about $3 each.  I don't
know of any places that will press less than 1000 at a time, but there
may be places which will charge less than $3 per disc.  There are, of
course, discounts for larger orders, which makes the $15 per disc
price of the latest Top 40 swill particularly odious, and the $22 per
disc price of the cool imports unbelievably nauseating.)

       The song originally appeared on Roy Harper's album Flat Baroque and
Berserk. The writer is listed as "H. Ash", who is credited with writing about
half the songs (Roy Harper is credited for the rest).  I suspect H. Ash is a
pseudonym for Roy, but others more knowledgeable may contradict me.  
       The original lp is all folk songs, sometimes with string arrangements
(by David Bedford, i believe) with one rock and roll track, "Hell's Angels" and
one live track--the 12-minute long "i hate the white man", which is probably
the best song on he album, though the album as a whole is good.  
       The bootleg Wow! has a pink sheet that mentions the song as being by
"H. Asch and R. Harper". I didn't get it, so i haven't heard the KaTe version.
The lyrics Vickie posted seem identical to the original, excepting that the
original was sung entirely by Roy.  The duet is an interesting innovation, and
the video concept seems great.

Hi,

I bought a CD player yesterday and NATURALLY I had to buy 'The Dreaming'
(although I have it on LP, in Greece..). To my surprise, the CD came with 
NO Lyrics. Just a stupid leaflet with no info whatsoever. Is this the 
rule or is this just my luck? My LP, has an insert with all the Lyrics, 
and some other info, if I remember correctly. I know I can get the Lyrics
from the archives, but I am frustrated at how cheap Record companies are.
I bought the HoL tape a year ago for ($3.99 at some bin) and it had
all the Lyrics! Are all KaTe CD's like this? 

Oh, by the way I now understand why most people rank TD as their favorite.
I guess I didn't pay the necessary attention when I listened to it back 
in the old days.

The short answer:  if you can help it, never buy a Kate Bush CD released
on EMI Manhattan.  They're cheap pressings and don't have lyrics booklets.
If you can manage to find an EMI America release, grab it.  It you can manage
to find an EMI (UK) release, kill for it.

I take it you bought an American copy.  EMI-America put all of Kate's
old albums into a cheaper line a few years ago, so with rare exceptions
none of her EMI-A albums come with lyrics anymore.  I say "with rare
exceptions" because it's still sometimes possible to find the first
pressings of these albums in stores; these have the lyrics.  Here's
the key to finding these first pressings:

1)  They DON'T say anything like "Price Buster" or "Budget Line", or
anything like that.

2)  They DON'T have a cut-out in the generic cardboard longbox through which
you can see the CD.  Instead, there's a picture of the album on the 
longbox itself.  Only _The Whole Story_, out of all the EMI-A albums,
always comes this way -- but that album NEVER had the lyrics.

If you want to avoid costs, record an RDAT digital cassette at 44.1 kHz.
Place start IDs at the beginning of each track
send it to someone with a Gotham Audio SPOT 90 CD-R recording system
(or similar).

a quote from United Audio Corporation:

Record CD from client's master tape (R-DAT)

	1 copy $195
	2-9 copies $160 each
	10-20 copies $120 each
	(from the same master tape)

	if you supply them with a 48kHz R-DAT, Reel to Reel or PCM-F1
	master tape, the R-DAT costs $12 for the sub master.

	If they add the start IDs, $35 more

	if they edit, $50/hr

Based on other quotes from various places, this is about average. 

To do 1000 discs, it costs about $2500 for the pressing with full

       It was great to hear from Vickie Sunday (April 28), who has been in 
some danger of dwindling to a legend while she and Chris don't have regular 
network access.  As always, her account of her take on "Not This Time" is an 
important contribution, and I appreciate the help.  I'm aware that this is not 
everybody's favorite song, but I'll admit to feeling some vindication in 
discovering that she has taken it seriously too.

       It is sound method to test one's version of a lyric against an 
interpretation of the song, and in general I find hers successful.  

&gt;IMHO, it's a song about a battered woman who can't seem to break
&gt;away from the husband/lover (?) who's treating her so badly. She
&gt;finally comes to a decision that she must make the break to save
&gt;herself.

       I feel it's too strong to take the person in the lyric to be a battered 
woman (or even necessarily a woman), but certainly the song addresses a 
conflicted love and the difficulty of extricating oneself from it.  I don't 
think the "fear you" needs to be taken as physical fear; for me it is more 
evocative if it is about the power of a love that has become obsessive or non-
reciprocal to be crushing or stifling for oneself.

       Whatever the interpretation, Vickie's efforts with the song have put us 
a position to decide on the authentic lyrics as sung.  I continue to think 
that has importance beyond this particular instance.  So:  to be done with 
this one, first I write the three versions in circulation, with judgments 
about their differences; then I write the version those judgments suggest.  I 
give them parallel formats for comparison.  In the few places where the 
evidence is not yet clear to my own ears, I adopt a two-out-of-three prevails 
rule.

&lt;Vickie's version&gt;       &lt;KBCOMPLETE's version&gt;    &lt;My version, recent post&gt;

  (in)sensitive            insensitive               sensitive
What chance do I have    What chance do I have     What chance do I have to 
  here?                    here -                    be here

       It's "a" mind; 'with a' and 'with the' are very close, but 'a' 
is more natural.  It's also "do I have here"; I was misled by the fact 
that the here is pronounced almost as two syllables--hee-ere.  As to 
sensitive/insensitive, it's up for grabs.  KBCOMPLETE prints sensitive 
in the lyrics section, insensitive in the music; Vickie can't call it, 
but points out it works with her interpretation either way.  I am going 
to stay with my version, attributing it to the singer, not the other.  
At most there is a continuation of the glottal 'ng' of 'everything', 
not a new syllable.

Put an end, put an end   Put an end Put an end     Put an end, put an end
Put an end to every dreamPut an end to every dream Put an end to every dream
When you're near I fear  When you're near - I fear When you're near I feel  
  you                      you                       you
And I forget myself      And I forget myself       And I forget myself

       OK, two to one in favor of 'fear', and I'll go with it.  But 
only because it is more clear in the next stanza, and consistency is to 
be expected.  I still can't stop hearing 'feel' here.

                                                   
Not this time baby       But not this time baby    Not this time baby
Not this time            Not this time             Not this time
Not this time baby       Not this time baby        Not this time baby
                         Not this time             

       The last reprise of "Not this time" is backup vocals, not lead.

                                                   
I dunno why I give in butI don't know why I give inI dunno why I give in but 
  I do every time          but I do every time       I do every time
And here I am a'wonderingAnd here I am wondering   And here I am a'wondering 
  why I did it again       why I did it again        why I'm doing it again

       It isn't "I did it again"; it's "I'm doing it again."

Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh    Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh     Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh
Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh    Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh     Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh
Toor-ee-ohhhhh must I sayThat's what I say         That's what I say
To keep me going, to keepIt keeps me going and it  To keep me going and to  
  the shit away            keeps the ship away       keep the shit away

       Vickie is right that there is a final "toor-ee-oh," but then 
it's "that's what I say," with the 'what I say' thrown by very quickly. 
Vickie and I agree against KBCONPLETE that it's "TO keep," etc., but 
she misses the "and," which is very distinct.

I don't know what it is  I don't know what it is   I don't know what it is
Every time you're near   But every time you're nearEvery time you're near
I fear you               I fear you                I feel you
And I forget myself      And I forget myself       And I forget myself
                                                   
No, not this time baby   No not this time baby     No, not this time baby
Not this time you won't  Not this time you won't   Not this time out
Not this time            Not this time darling     Not this time
Not this time darling                              Not this time

       Vickie is alone in being right on this passage.  The "darling" 
is a stunning growling howl, easy to miss as a word.

                                                   
C'mon, we all sing       C'mon we all sing         C'mon, we all sing
                                                   
(Refrain)                (Refrain)                 (Refrain


       Integrating the results, what follows strikes me as presentable for a 
definitive version of the lyrics for this song:

.............................................................................
&lt;Love-Hounds version:  thanks to |&gt;oug Alan, Vickie Mapes, Andrew Marvick, Ed 
Suranyi, Larry DeLuca&gt;
.............................................................................

NOT THIS TIME
Kate Bush

Oh with a mind that renders everything sensitive
What chance do I have here
Put an end, put an end
Put an end to every dream
When you're near I fear you
And I forget myself

Not this time baby
Not this time
Not this time baby

I dunno why I give in but I do every time
And here I am a'wondering why I'm doing it again
Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh
Toor-ee-ah Toor-ee-oh
Toor-ee-oh that's what I say
To keep me going and to keep the shit away
I don't know what it is
Every time you're near
I fear you
And I forget myself

No, not this time baby
Not this time out
Not this time
Not this time darling

C'mon, we all sing

(Refrain)

Tower in Atlanta has had the Hammersmith video in the past, but I'm not 
sure that they do right now.  In any event, you should call them and 
order it.  It would only take a week or two for them to get it for you 
if they don't have it, and they will set it aside for you if they do.

to note an error I made in transcribing the "final" perfect version of NTT.  I 
stipulated in the blow-by-blow that Vickie had the last stanza right, but then 
didn't correct the second line (should be "not this time you won't," instead 
of my "not this time out").  I'm hoping to get this into the same issue of the

Subject: Monthly post for rec.music.gaffa

Rec.music.gaffa is a 5-year-old newsgroup dedicated to the sublime artistic
genius of Kate Bush.  "Gaffa" comes from her song "Suspended in Gaffa" (on
_The_Dreaming_), and (according to Kate) refers to gaffer's tape, or duct
tape, used to keep people from tripping over electrical cabling, and
metaphorically, apparently, to a frustrating sort of limbo-dimension:

"Suddenly my feet are feet of mud/ It all goes slo-mo
I don't know why I'm crying/ Am I suspended In Gaffa?"

Rec.music.gaffa is run as a moderated group only because submissions to it
are forwarded to an extensive mailing list of people without netnews
access, who form an informal fan club called "Love-Hounds". (The mailing
list was r.m.g's original format, when started by |&gt;oug /\lan so many years
ago.)  You can mail submissions, without fear of censorship, to:

love-hounds@eddie.mit.edu

To subscribe to the mailing list, send a friendly message to the
"moderator", Bill Wisner (who's actually in Alaska), via:

love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu

Love-hounds celebrate Kate's birthday (Katemas) each year on July 30, with
parties all over the world (she was born in 1958).

The big event of 1990 was the Kate Bush Fan Clubs Convention, November 17
at London's Hammersmith Palais, celebrating the release (in the UK, Canada
and Japan) of the "This Woman's Work" boxed set, containing all her albums
in conventional form, along with two CDs (or three LPs) of B-sides and
alternative mixes.  Of the 1300 convention attendees, some 50 were
Love-Hounds, many from the US and Australia, meeting face to face for the
first time.  Kate spent an hour answering questions submitted by audience
members, and announced that she hopes to have a new album finished very
quickly, having begun composing at the piano again.

She also claimed she's planning to "play some dates" at the end of 1991,
possibly including some in the US.  Old Kate-Hounds are protecting
themselves from disappointment with a wait-and-see attitude, having heard
all this before, but hints and rumors are building weekly, pointing to the
possibility of a genuine World Tour!

Kate's earliest band was called the KT Bush Band, (KT being readable as
Katie), and all her albums have had a KT emblem hidden somewhere on the
cover.  With the boxed set she introduced a new version of the symbol,
integrating the astrological        ( )
symbol for Venus (ie, the           -|-
biological symbol for woman).        |&lt;

Topics of interest to love-hounds include other alternative female artists,
and Kate-related others like Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper.  Many new
discoveries have been brought to our attention by Vickie Mapes (of
Vickie'n'Chris), whose radio show "Suspended in Gaffa" focuses on
alternative female artists, airing Wednesdays from 7 to 8pm on WZRD in
Chicago (88.3 FM), and Saturdays from 10 to 11pm on KKFI (90.1 FM) in
Kansas City.  Vickie is especially big on Jane Siberry, the
soon-to-be-superstar Happy Rhodes, and Victoria Williams.

Another welcome fixture in the group is the numinous curmudgeon "IED", Andy
Marvick's self-parody as the ultimate "true believer" Katefan.  IED has
acted at times as the flame-wielding bouncer of the group, but has mellowed
of late into the simpler role of a supremely well-informed and selfless
devotee of the cause.

I said I'd post these when I got around to typing them in so here they are
Unfortunately (isn't there always some bad news) they are not complete.
Below you'll find all of the lyrics that I have so far managed to figure out.
The underscores indicate bits I haven't got yet, and {} are bits I'm not sure 
about. Besides that, I'm bound to have made a few mistakes, and in particular
the second half of one of the songs is missing because I got sick of trying to
work it out and forgot to have another go. The reason I'm posting these 
unfinished is to try to convince somebody else to finish the task. Please send
any suggestions as to the missing bits or corrections or comments in general
to me. I do hope to complete these and produce the Postscript source, but I'm
a bit busy at the moment. I also offered to post a full review - sorry that'll
have to wait also :-(
BTW [] indicates backing vocals (well quiet anyway)
And without further ado -

THE LACEMAKER

dreams are like water, colourless and dangerous

MR. SOMEWHERE

day comes up sicker than a cat
something's wrong face that

mr. somewhere missing somewhere never did figure just how much

boat from the river takes you out
'cross the other side of town, to get out, to get out
you take the tide, any tide, any tide
like there isn't gonna be any tide

mr. somewhere missing somewhere never did figure just how much
missing somewhere never did figure just how much

a world like tomorrow wears things out
it's hard enough to get what's yours for now
and the hardest words are spoken softly
softly look, no hands upon

mr. somewhere missing somewhere never did figure just how much
missing somewhere never did figure just how much

now the milkman beats you to the door
that was once a home, home no more
mr. somewhere, missing somewhere couldn't get the calendar to stop
missing somewhere, never did figure just how much
missing somewhere, never will admit just how much

ANDIALU

WITH TOMORROW

it was more like a dream than reality
I must have thought it was a dream while you were here with me
when you were near I didn't think you would leave
when you were gone it was too much to believe

so with tomorrow, I will borrow
another moment of joy and sorrow
in another dream, and another
with tomorrow

so with the sun there won't be time just to look behind
there will be reasons not exclusions for my _________ mind
there was so much I was told, it was not real
so many things that I could not taste, but I could feel

so with tomorrow, I will borrow
another moment of joy and sorrow
in another dream, and another
with tomorrow

LATE NIGHT

when I woke up today
and you weren't there to play
then I wanted to be with you
when you showed me your eyes
whispered love the skies
then I wanted to stay with you

inside me I feel, alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be a very special thing to me

when I lay still at night 
seeing stars high and light
then I wanted to be with you
when the rooftops shone dark
all alone saw a spark
spark of love just to stay with you

inside me I feel, alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be a very special thing to me

if I mention your name
turn around on a chain
then the sky opens up for you
when we grew very tall
when I saw you so small
then I wanted to stay with you

inside me I feel, alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be a very special thing to me

inside me I feel, alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be a very special thing to me

Hi folks,

  Ok, the quick and dirty do-it-yourself CD booklet insert for _This
Woman's Work_ is ready for beta-testing and final corrections.  If you
would like a copy of the PostScript source for the booklet, please send
me an e-mail message (no posting to Love-Hounds/rec.music.gaffa please)
and I'll send it to you right away.

  Also, if you have any 7" singles from _Hounds of Love_ or _The Sensual
World_, please check the inner grooves for secret messages and send any
you find to me.

which was released by HBO, I think (2-3 yrs old).  Does anyone know if this

&gt; Not that I believe in voting, and not that I wouldn't vote for you, Ed, if
&gt; it were put to a vote, but as far as I can see the only official anything
&gt; we acknowledge right now is our pseudo-moderator.

Another title that was bestowed rather than voted. :-)

&gt; and the voice said, more or less, "well, sod off then!"  which actually
&gt; seemed rather valid: we have always been elitist in spite of ourselves, and
&gt; really owe it to fandom to make an effort at outreach, thru some kind of
&gt; edited hardcopy something-or-other available by subscription?

The real question is whether we really have much of anything to offer
in that format.  Our strength is that we get information to those who 
can receive Love-Hounds faster than any other media and we have a large 
knowlege-base that any participant can easily tap into.  Seems to me 
that any attempt to put this on paper loses most of its utility.   
Perhaps the closest you could come would a be a monthly single page 
newsletter with just news briefs and quick questions and answers.
I think this would be useful but who would spend the time required for
such an effort?  &lt;the sound of hundreds of Love-Hounds taking one step back&gt;

For my part I've tried to make Gaffa more accessable by making it
available instantly for any modem user willing to make a LD phone 
call (614-864-1198).  That may not seem like much to grizzled USENET 
veterans but its considerably more hassle free than all but your 
most liberal public access sites and it is considerably more novice-
friendly than your typical news reader (IMO).

&gt; my rankling envy again: who's this jeff to hand out official connections?

I'd say someone who bothered to try to make the connections in the first 
place and is willing to share them.  I get the impression that some folks 
guard these kind of sources jealously.  After all, if they don't have some
exclusive source of information, what are they doing besides repeating
what the other fanzines/newsletters have said? 

Originally I didn't really think an official contact inside Columbia
could be of much use.  But Columbia did a pretty good job with 
material from _The Sensual World_ and advance notice of things
like the Aspects... CD-5 would be nice.  Beyond that an official 
connection to Columbia would allow us a more direct route for feedback.  
What better way to lobby for a B-sides only collection for the US?

Excellent information there.  I'm rather puzzled at why anybody would
spend $2400 on 20 discs when they can get 1000 for $2500.

&gt;If you want to avoid costs, record an RDAT digital cassette at 44.1 kHz.

Is this generally the accepted standard now?  I thought the Sony
PCM-F1 format was the preferred one.

Considering the great Love-Hounds bootleg frenzy of April 1989 (could it
have been only two years ago?) I doubt that many people here are in a
position to criticize your discretion.  

Of course you should at least go buy the Hammersmith video.  It's
available where-ever fine video tapes are sold for a mere $20.  The
B-sides are bit stickier.  You really should get them legitimately but
it is quite expensive since it can only be done by buying all the
singles (difficult and expensive), buying the Single File (expensive
but nice), or buying the boxed set (expensive but nice and on CD).  
Lobby for a boxed set for Christmas, you'll want them on CD anyway.

The PCM-F1 format is still preferred by anyone who doesn't have the new
1-shot disc recorders. The new machine pretty much automatically takes
an RDAT and builds the TOC on the fly then makes the single disc. This
disc can be used to make the actual master for mass duplication. These
machines are relatively new, I think they didn't start coming out until
the end of last year and the prices have only gotten low enough for
smaller studios to start buying them.

Subject:      oops! (thanks ed)

as is often my wont, my fingers typed something that i did not mean to type.
indeed, the _KaTe bush live_ cd contains "running up that hill" from the
secret policeman's third ball, as ed correKTly stated, not "hounds of love"
(which, indeed, was not performed there). for those of you who are wondering
though, the 1986 bpi awards performance of "hounds of love" is avaailable
on the *lp* bootleg _passing through air_ (not the *cd* of the same title).

on another note entirely, i borrowed a few cds from our local library yes-
terday. one of them was a collection of short pieces composed by delius per-
formed by the northern sinfonia of england. while i am woefully ignorant of
what period his work belongs to, i must say that i enjoyed it quite a bit.
his music has a very rural or pastoral feel to it - indeed when i looked at
the titles of the pieces, they most often had to do with seasons or nature.
recommended that you check him out...if you haven't already that is (now,
do you all think we could convince nigel kennedy to record some of delius'
work?).

speaking of violin players, a small plug for kim angelis. she has one release
so far called _violin voyager_. i have forgotten the record label (i think it
is rom records), but i have certanly not forgotten the music! laced with gypsy
influences, _violin voyager_ is a mad trapsaise (is that a word? it is now!)
of a woman and her violin. most enjoyable as well (now, if we could only get
her and nigel to do a violin duet...).

jon: you have forgotten the "youth bass storm" mix of "the big sky" that you
brewed up for me...that reggae mix of "sat in your lap" sounds enticing tho.

The CD was Fl 50,- in the shop. There's this store in Eindhoven, Holland

It sounds like they used the vinyl records to master this CD...

Even though the packaging of the re-release is different, as I've
mentioned before, the video performance itself is identical.  I bought
a new copy just to see if there were any changes.  Aside from some 
labeling changes at the beginning and end of the video, it is utterly
unchanged.  You may have gotten mixed up because we've said that
the video doesn't include the whole live performance, but all versions
of the videotape are equally lacking in this respect.

Subject: Homeground #41


In epilogue to the Homeground/Little Light discussion I should point
out, in all fairness to HG, that they did at least print two items in
their latest issue that express an alternative view of their remarks
on U.S. "censorship" efforts.  This is a welcome step toward a more
broad view of these issues.  

Still, while the items they've chosen to include do point out some 
alternatives to HG's attitude toward these issues it's unfortunate
that they've made no effort to correct some mistaken impressions that
they've given in the past.  (Ed, I'd be interested to hear whether your 
letter about their "k.d. lang censorship" item garnered any response at 
all.)

I hope that this means that HG will in the future be more cognizant of
their "international" moniker and realize that it entails having a
better understanding of the events in other countries and a greater
respect for the wide range of opinions represented by the citizens of
those countries.  It's a shame that it took such a flurry and row to 
elicit some small recognition of this.  

It should also be said that (as Andy has already pointed out)
Homeground does give fair coverage of the _Army Dreamers_ "censorship"
issue in this their first issue since it occurred so Little Light owes
them a retraction on their remark about that.

I note that in this issue they point out that the supposed re-release 
the _The Singles File_ [sic] by "Cello Video" may in fact be a bootleg.
I've been saying that it is definitely a bootleg for almost a year.

Why do they talk about a bootleg album and then turn around and issue
a stern warning about the illegality of a bootleg video?

Someone mentioned the feasibility of Homeground access to
Love-Hounds now that they're computerized.  If the U.K. computer 
market is anything like in the U.S., modems are extremely cheap and 
surely one our U.K. Love-Hounds has the clout to finagle a news or 
mail account.  I'm sure they'd find themselves out of disk space 
quite quickly given access to the Love-Hounds archives.

I wonder if they could make just the news section of HG available at 
a discount?

&gt;"Don't drive too slowly."                 Richard Caldwell

Well, it wasn't really an entire letter.  It's just that in my
last package of American clippings (sent in January), I included,
as usual, a short letter.  In one paragraph I questioned tentatively
their comments about the k.d. lang affair, as I got the impression
they did not understand the situation fully.

No, they didn't comment about it, but then they rarely comment
about anything I tell them.  It really doesn't bother me.  I don't
expect everything I write them to make its way into print.  Sometimes
they'll have a news story or a quote that is clearly based on 
something I told them, and they credit me.  That's good enough
for me.  Quite a few times I've sent them news items about radio
play which they have printed, but with slight errors.  I would
dutifully correct the error in my next letter to them, but
they've never printed a correction.  In these cases I really
wouldn't expect them to.

Subject: Kate on MTV


Has anyone else noticed that Kate has been appearing regularly on 
MTV lately?  My wife, Missy, did.

Ok, so it's only for about a quarter of a second. 

Ok, so it's only about six frames of the back of her head.

Ok, it's only a tiny piece of the _Don't Give Up Video_ inserted in a
mantage of video clips on an MTV promo.  

On the other hand you could say that MTV has just censored all but 
six frames of the video for being too erotic.

&gt;I think this would be useful but who would spend the time required 
&gt;for such an effort?  

I'm also thinking something like this, and am wondering if we could at
least offer it to people like Tom of C-side who might staple it in with his
price list, and the other zines who could extract what they liked?

The point is that if we're going to feel miffed when clubs like AATHP beat
us to the punch on stuff, then we ought to try to share our resources with
the 95% of US/UK/&amp;c katefans who have no access.

(Side issue: is it possible to get the digest thru Compuserve, Prodigy,
etc?  How?  Can we make an effort to get the word out in all the zines how
people can do this?)

Would anyone volunteer to be an 'outreach information officer'?

I think we do need a designated interface to CBS, and Ed is fine by me. 
I'd like to think we could get some promo stuff for the various local
Katemas parties, first-notification on tour/album/etc news, and RESERVED
SEATING AT CONCERTS, pleeeeeeeease!

But we hardly deserve this so long as we're so inherently undemocratic,
imho.

Couldn't somebody do a little semi-non-profit side-business selling xeroxes
of lyrics, etc?

   I am glad to post my first article to GAFFA, but before I start
 I would like to thank the following people in helping gain access to
 this wonderful group as I had trouble posting earlier seeing I did
 not know the address of this moderated group:

    -    Rick Thompson ( .. answered many questions that are
                        'common knowledge' to readers of this
                         group .. thanks Rick!!)

    -    Neal Caldwell

    -    Shannon Bell 
    
    -    A person called 'hannon', I am sorry but you did not supply
         a signature with your full name, and I could not get 
         your full name from the mail header.

         (Thanks for the VERY detailed descriptions of the videos
          that are avaiable for KaTe Bush)

  All of the above replied to my original post in the newsgroup, 
  'rec.music.video', thanks for your helpful replies!
                     
  My questions begin:

     As I live in AUSTRALIA, I would like any love-hounds that are over
  here to send me "snail mail" addresses of Australian KaTe
  fan clubs and places that deal with Kate related material (videos,
  T-Shirts / posters etc).

     Could some American KaTe fans pease mail me lists of places that I
  could order KaTe T-Shirts / Posters etc.

     I live in Adelaide, so I would prefer local mail addresses if
  possible, and is there a fan club in Adelaide, if so I would
  like to attend an 'Aussie KaTemas' this year!

     I have had some trouble looking for KaTe's latest video, 
  "The Sensual World - The Videos", if anyone in Australia has this
  please email me where to order it from. 

     On a final note, does anyone know if the "rumoured" world
  tour of KaTe will include Australia .... possibly Adelaide? (I wish!)

  Thanks!

  New KaTe related .sig under construction.. B-)  &lt;= Tell-tail signs of
                                                      KaTe KonverT!
