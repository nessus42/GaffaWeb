     Here is an easier(?) way to play cassette tapes backwards.  The explana-
tion may not be totally clear when reading it, but I think it should be clear
enough if you do it with the tape in front of you.

1. Record the music on a cassette you don't care too much about, since
   this process may cause the tape to be slightly misaligned when finished,
   resulting in balance problems.  Use a cassette that is held together by
   screws, not the really cheap ones that are held together by glue.

2. Rewind the tape so it is all on one reel.

3. With a small screwdriver (the kind used for eyeglass screws), remove the
   five screws that hold the cassette shell together.

4. With the cassette shell on a flat surface, top half up (i.e. the half with
   the screw holes in it), carefully remove the top half.  The tape reels are
   now exposed; observe how the tape is threaded through the lower part of the
   cassette shell.

5. Pick up the reel that has all the tape on it, being careful to hold it at
   its edge so the tape doesn't unwind from it.  Flip this reel over and
   replace it on the same hub.  Now the tape feeds off the inner side of the
   reel instead of the outer side.

6. Re-thread the tape so that it is not twisted, and is properly seated in the
   cassette shell.  Now the tape looks exactly as before, except the full reel
   is feeding from inner side.

7. Replace the top cassette shell and replace the screws.

8. Put the cassette in a player and wind all the tape from the full reel onto
   the empty one. (The capstans will be turning in opposite directions during
   this process.)

9. Now the tape is reversed and can be played normally as many times as you
   wish.  You cannot record on this tape, since the oxide is on the wrong side
   and the erase head of the player is not strong enough to erase through the
   thickness of the tape.  Also, the sound when playing is somewhat muffled,
   but it's good enough to make out backwards words.

To restore the tape to normal, repeat the same process; however, there may be
a slight, lingering alignment problem as noted above.
