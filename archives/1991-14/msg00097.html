&gt;   moment (in terms of pure music magic, that is), but I have to wonder 
&gt;   if they'll ever sell th at that price.  

you'd be surprised at the ammounts of people i find who don't seem to
see how that could be expensive. don't ask me how, but they all shop
at Circular Motions...2:)

&gt;2) The fact that they were even there.  I've never seen boots at CDW
&gt;   before.  I'm sure someone there knows that they are boots, as well. 

actually, they've had boots before. i bought two Joy Division boots
from them (for $20 ea.) a year or so back. every once in a while, Chris
finds someone selling them and orders a few. i know he knows they are
bootlegs. what i don't understand is why he's started hiking up his
prices lately.

&gt;   I remember there being a sign stuck to each saying something like:
&gt;   "These songs are not typical CD quality.  No refunds or exchanges."

the reason why he puts such a vague message on is because they've been
in trouble with the feds before for plain old paralell importing. remember
about two years back? they got hit and scared for a while. they're
more cautious now. they figure that if you know about the bootleg, then
you know what you're looking at and if you don't, then that's just
as well for them.
