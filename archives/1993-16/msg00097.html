this was already posted on ecto, but it might be of interest 
to gaffa, as well....

hi all,

i've had a very frustrating couple of days  and my attempt to get
gabriel tickets just kinda topped the whole thing off.
when i got to work, i got on the phone and started calling the ticket
agency: busy, redial, busy, redial,.... finally i got through, and
i said, "do you have gabriel tickets?"

Ticket Agent: certainly.  where would you like to sit?
Brni: well, where do you have tickets for?
TA: we still have some seats in the first few rows.
B: REALLY??!!??!
TA: how many would you like?
B: two. by the way, how much are they?
TA: oh, i can let them go at $175 each.
B: uuuuum... uhhhhh.  how much were the tickets on the first level?
TA: those are only $100 each.
B: i see.
TA: how much were you interested in spending?  there are seats farther back...
B: never mind.  its not worth it. 
click.

fuckers.  ticket agents have now become the legal scalpers of tickets,
because when the venue's box office doesn't open until 1/2 hour after
the tickets go on sale, the ticket agents can get all the best seats and
then charge anything they damn well please for them  (you know they only
paid the regular price, no matter where the seats are, but they sell them
for $175!!!!!!).  in the past, the best seats always went to the real
fanatics who would camp out overnight to get tickets.  now, the bests
seats, like everything else, goes to the people with the most damn
money.

uli, you can complain all you want about postal prices in deutschland,
but at least you don't have to pay $100 to get seats to a gabriel
concert that you will need to bring binoculars to be able to see anyways,
and where the sound will have turned to mush long before it ever gets
to you.

i've seen gabriel every time he's come to town since '83; i saw the security
tour, the second security tour, the so tour, and the second so tour (twice).
now that pete has hit the "big time" however, i can't go because i can't 
afford the damn tickets.

the music industry sucks wet farts out of dead pigeons.
