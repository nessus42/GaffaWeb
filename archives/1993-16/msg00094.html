FILES AVAILABLE  
 
All past messages of rec.music.gaffa/love-hounds-digest can be ftp'd 
from the love-hounds archive at ftp.UU.NET [137.39.1.9] in 
/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/archives.  Song lyrics, interviews, the Garden 
and Cloudbusting, etc are in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb on the same 
host.  
 
There are innumberable GIF (picture) files available including pics 
from the 1990 Kate Bush convention, which include pics of Kate's house 
and a Love-Hounds group pic (lovename.gif).  Also, there are pics from 
the Cathy book (cathy??.gif), pics from the This Woman's Work booklet 
(TWW??.gif), pics from the 1979 Tour of Life booklet (page_??.gif), and 
uncounted more. 
 
To view these GIFs you will need a program for your type of computer.  
Public domain picture file viewers include CSHOW and PICEM for the IBM, 
TURBOGIF and HAMGIF for the Amiga, and Giffer or QuickGif for the 
Macintosh. 
  
GIF files are also available in  
/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/pix/gif [and gif.new, gif_footah,  
gif.saintjohn, pix.hill, gif_tour_program, gif.newer, gif.fenger]  
  
If you've never used ftp, you use a program on your UNIX system called  

FTP.  You connect by typing:  
ftp ftp.UU.NET  
Log in as "anonymous", and use your username as your password.  
To change directories type:  
cd usenet/rec.music.gaffa  
"dir" will get you a directory, "get" and the filename will retrieve 
the file.  If you "cd" again into "archives" or "kb" you'll find the 
main goodies, with "pix" being another subdirectory within "kb", and 
"gif" and "gif.new" within "pix".  (When downloading gif's, set your 
transfer type to binary by typing  
binary  
at the "ftp&gt;" prompt.)  
 
Two priceless resources for Katefans have recently been made available, 
both of which are much more interesting then anything published:  
        "The Garden" is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference 
material on Kate, [availible in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden] 
including a detailed chronology of her life and career (much more 
complete then anything available anywhere else) [GARDEN01].  Also, a 
listing of all known Kate recordings, videography (which includes both 
official videos and the television appearances), and an extensive list 
of fan magazines  [GARDEN02].  ALL of the lyrics (including background 
voices) to ALL of Kate's known songs (including unreleased songs) 
[GARDEN04].  All of John's and Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and 
articles for the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles  

for the KBC [GARDEN05, GARDEN06].  Also included are about sixty 
interviews [GARDEN07 through GARDEN10]. 
        "Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words" is Ron Hill (the 
keeper of this monthly post)'s compilation of almost 200 interviews, 
sorted by song, story, and subject order, forming the closest we may 
ever see to a full-fledged Kate autobiography.  It is available in 
regular text format, or in Wordperfect 4.2 format, which makes use of 
Wordperfect's underlining, bolding, and italizing, ability, and 
contains an extensive index.  It is also available in MacWrite II, 
PostScript, and Word 4.0 versions.  (Eventually the extra unedited 
interviews will be added into The Garden).  
        There are also a series of Cloudbusting GIF (picture) files, 
which are located in love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/gif [APPARENTLY THESE 
ARE TRASHED].  A title page [CTITLE.GIF and a larger version, 
CTITLEB.GIF], a title page for Part II [CSTORY.GIF] and part III 
[CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen [CREDITS.GIF], and a pic of 3 inch 
disk label [CLABEL.GIF, and a b&amp;w version CLABELBW.GIF].  There are 
also pictures for most of the albums which show the picture of Kate 
from the album cover next to a listing of songs [titles begin with 
"O"].  There are also "alternative" pics for some of the albums, which  

show pictures SIMILAR to but not identical to the album covers [files 
begin with "A"].  There are also "full" pictures for some of the albums 
[titles begin with "F"], which are the raw, uncropped, pictures. 
        Cloudbusting is available in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbus
ting.  The text version is in /love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/text.  
Filenames are cloud0.txt, cloud1a.txt, cloud1b.txt, cloud1c.txt,  
cloud2a.txt, cloud2b.txt, cloud3a.txt, cloud 3b.txt, cloud3c.txt, 
cloud4.txt, cloud5.txt, clouds.txt.  It is also available compressed 
with ZIP in /love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/zip as filenames cloud045.zip, 
cloud1.zip, cloud2.zip, cloud3.zip.  
 
        A third, in-progress book, also by Ron Hill, will be "Deeper 
Understanding - A collection of Kate Bush articles" which will compile 
the "best of" the Love-Hounds as well as a few articles from fan 
magazines and lots of published reviews.   It'll be about five megs in 
size. 
 
 
If you don't have FTP (file transfer ability) you can still get the 
files by using an FTP mail server run by DEC.  You send it a list of 
commands and then it sends you the files as regular mail messages, so 
anyone who has the ability to send and receive private mail can use 
this.  If a file is larger then 60k it will be send as more than one 
message.   
        If you want to GET binary files (GIF picture files, Wordperfect 
files, or anything that's not straight text)  it will send you the 
files in a special text format called UUENCODED, you will need a 
program called UUDECODE for your computer to decode these.  Note that 
this is not always the most relible way of getting files, ie you may 
have to do it several times.  
        To start off using this, send a message to 
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, the first message should read simply HELP -  
don't bother with a subject line as these are ignored.  You will be 
sent back the basic commands and some examples, read this carefully (as 
much as you are able to understand).  Here are some specific examples 
for accessing the love-hounds archives, don't type the parts in 
brackets [].  Note that when typing in file names, upper and 
lower case are important!  
 
-&gt; Connect to the archives and get a directory of some of the main  
areas: 
 
reply [your address]       [this may or may not be needed on all  
                            messages for your system] 
connect ftp.UU.NET         [connect to the file archives] 
chdir usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb [change to the main area, only one  
                                 CHDIR per session] 
dir                        [get directory of main area] 
dir garden                 [get directory of GARDEN files] 
dir cloudbusting           [dir directory of Cloudbusting directories] 
dir pix                    [get dir of pix directories] 
quit 
 
  
-&gt; Connect to the Cloudbusting section and get some text files: 
 
reply [your address] 
connect ftp.UU.NET  
chdir usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbusting/text [change to  
                                        Cloudbusting subdirectory] 
get cloud1a.txt          [GET a file]  
get cloud1b.txt          [GET another file, can GET only 10 at once]  
get cloud1c.txt           
quit 
 
  
-&gt; Connect to the GARDEN section and get some GARDEN files: 
 
reply [your address] 
connect ftp.UU.NET  
chdir usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden [change to garden subdirectory] 
get GARDEN01                [GET first GARDEN file]  
get GARDEN02                [GET another file, can GET only 10 at once] 
 
quit 
 
 
-&gt; Connect to pix.hill and get love-hounds picture: 
 
reply [your address] 
connect ftp.UU.NET 
chdir usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/pix/pix.hill 
uuencode                             [specify UUENCODE format] 
binary                               [specify BINARY format] 
get LOVENAME.GIF 
quit 
 
 
For those without FTP capabilities or the patience to figure all this  
out, the BBSes list above offer the GIFs and many of the other files  
too.
