Hi,

as I've already told you I've gotten hold of the rockflix WH video. Let
me first cite IED's video list in THE GARDEN:

&gt;     1. "Wuthering Heights" (Rockflix version): This is the earliest 

&gt; record of Kate Bush on video. A promotional film made in February 1978
&gt; (perhaps even earlier), it features Kate alone on a heath (representing
&gt; the Yorkshire moors, presumably), lip-synching to the record while
&gt; dancing and miming. She wears a red dress, and  looks extremely young.
&gt; This clip was the one which most European nations saw as support for
&gt; the single in 1978, but in England a later version directed by Keith
&gt; MacMillan (see entry below) was preferred. It is also the Rockflix
&gt; video which was later parodied by Faith Brown, to Kate's own delight. 

&gt; 

&gt;      7. Wuthering Heights: the "moors", or "field" video, directed by
&gt; Rockflix in February 1978. This was the first video ever made by Kate,
&gt; as far as is known. It was originally intended for English television
&gt; broadcast, but was eventually rejected in favor of the in-studio video
&gt; directed by Keith "Keef" MacMillan. In this version Kate simply
&gt; lip-synchs the vocal while performing her choreographic routine. She is
&gt; dressed in a red dress, and the setting is a large open field or
&gt; meadow. Trees are visible in the distant background. At the conclusion
&gt; of the video Kate's figure slowly recedes into the background, through
&gt; a simply time-lapse special-effect.

Now I have two questions:

1. are the two entries above describing the same video? And if not, which 

   one is the video I've got - the video fits for both descriptions.
2. Looking at the grass of the 'moors' you can see the color green. Grass
   isn't green in normal Februaries, at least not in Europe. So the video
   should really be from a time much earlier than Feb. 78. I suggest 

   Autumn 1977, since that would allow to promote the first planned
   single release date that was also autumn 1977. Any opinions?

Bye,

Uli
