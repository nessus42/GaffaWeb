&gt;Was shown a copy of "The Sensual World", signed by Herself.  I was proud
&gt;of myself for thinking hard about three minutes (really it was delaying
&gt;about three minutes) before purchasing it.  It had just arrived in the
&gt;store that morning and I did not want to risk losing it to another
&gt;buyer if I thought about it longer.

&gt;My question is, are there other people out there with autographed
&gt;albums (my was framed already) of Kate or any musician that can tell
&gt;me if this is a valid and valuable item and how to verify that
&gt;	a) It is REAL (It really LOOKS like Kates sig)

If there's anything with an "i" in it (such as "hi") Kate has tended
in the past to use a circle instead of a dot. I could tell by looking,
even if there isn't an "i" but otherwise, I wouldn't know how to describe
her writing.

&gt;	b) what the usual price is
&gt;	c) and if the values on these ever rise...

Dunno. Dunno. (Does it matter anyway? If it's valuable to *you* that's
all that counts.) We have a Japanese HoL, 4 photos, a letter, an envelope
and one of my radio show flyers all signed by Kate. She sent us 2 photos
and a note (the photos were signed separately, one to Chris and one to
me) and addressed the envelope herself. The third photo was a giveaway
prize at BushCon'84, and is the only one that wasn't directly from her
to us. The HoL was signed at the NYC Tower Records signing in 1985. The
4th photo was signed outside a radio station during that same promo tour
(it's especially dear to us because it's also signed by the photographer,
Armando Gallo, who cropped and blew it up to 8x10 just for us.) The flyer
was signed at the KonvenTion in 1990. That one was a fluke though. I sent
it backstage just to be given to Kate, but she thought I wanted it signed
so she did and sent it back out to me. Hey, that's ok, I just sent her
another one to keep :-).

We'd cut ourselves into tiny pieces before we'd sell any of those items.

&gt;P.S. She hangs with my other autographed album, who is Annie Ross.

Want to get her airplay in Chicago &amp; Kansas City? E-mail me.
