&gt; &gt;3) Pull out the pin
&gt; &gt;People who hated "Hanoi Jane" Fonda probably shouldn't know about this song, 
&gt; &gt;sung from the perspective of a Viet Cong soldier hunting Americans.  I'll 
&gt; &gt;always see it in terms of the heroine of Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket", 
&gt; &gt;which actually ties into the Kate-Cloudbusting-WilhelmReich connection, 
&gt; &gt;because *Kubrick's* title evoked Reich's psychoanalytic distinction between 
&gt; &gt;'fascists' whose bodies are rigid with character armor, and loose, healthy 
&gt; &gt;characters who still remember how to *shimmy*...!
&gt; 
&gt; Inspired.  Overinspired, but inspired.
&gt; For one thing, there are *no* loose, healthy characters in FULL METAL
&gt; JACKET who still remember how to shimmy.  Everybody in that film,
&gt; including the Matthew Modine character, is tainted and corrupted by the
&gt; war.  Modine does actively struggle against that, most notably by his
&gt; sarcasm and his peace button, but he also ultimately buys into the system.
&gt; Any shimmying elements (Nancy Sinatra, the Surfing Bird, the Mickey Mouse
&gt; theme) are subverted towards the war.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, in the one scene where psychoanalytic paradigms are drawn, Modine
&gt; specifically invokes Jung, not Reich.
&gt; 
&gt; And you know, the more I think about it, name any character in any
&gt; Stanley Kubrick film loose and healthy enough to remember how to shimmy.
&gt; I honest to God cannot think of a one, except *maybe* the little girl
&gt; on the videophone in 2001, and she's only there for a minute or two.
&gt; 
&gt; Full Metal Jacket, btw, means that one is carrying all of one's
&gt; ammunition, in that over the shoulder style war films fetishize.
&gt; But the film isn't so much about the fascism of that pose, but
&gt; the absurdity of it, and of war.  If it draws upon any school of
&gt; thought, I'd have to say it draws upon absurdism.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is not to suggest that there is nothing in what Jorn says;
&gt; there is a glimmer, but more from what he puts there than from
&gt; what is in the film itself, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; ObKate-- I always thought Cloudbusting would be a great closing
&gt; credit theme for a movie version of Richard Bachman's novel "Roadwork."

FYI, to clear up a incorrect definition, "Full Metal Jacket" is
the type of ammo used by the US ARMY for rifles and machine guns.
Vincent D'Nofrio (sp), the harrassed private in boot says as much
while loading his rifle just before shooting the drill sergeant.

Being an ex-Army person, myself, in Soldier of the Year Competitions,
I know this by rote, ie- 
	Q: What is the M-16 rifle characteristics?
	A: The M-16 rifle is a semi automatic or automatic
	   rifle. It has an effective range of 300m...etc...
	   It fires a 5.56mm _full metal jacket_ round...

Now that important fact is cleared (like somebody _really_ gives a s**t
that I pounced on this...the important question...

Two and a half years ago, while on a trip to SF, I ventured into
a record shop.  They also sold autographed albums and other asst.
musical stuff.  

Was shown a copy of "The Sensual World", signed by Herself.  I was proud
of myself for thinking hard about three minutes (really it was delaying
about three minutes) before purchasing it.  It had just arrived in the
store that morning and I did not want to risk losing it to another
buyer if I thought about it longer.

My question is, are there other people out there with autographed
albums (my was framed already) of Kate or any musician that can tell
me if this is a valid and valuable item and how to verify that
	a) It is REAL (It really LOOKS like Kates sig)
	b) what the usual price is
	c) and if the values on these ever rise...
I genuinely hope that this causes some people out there pea-green
envy! :-)

Thanks for any info that can be given.....

P.S. She hangs with my other autographed album, who is Annie Ross.

I idolize Annie second only to Kate, and lo and behold a friend of
mine spends Xmas every year with her (they live in the same apt.
building).  I had an old Lambert Hendricks and Ross album and he
had it signed for me....What more could I ask for out of life than
personally meeting her or Kate in person?
