Hi,

I just came back from Aschaffenburg where Ilka and I visited the Suzanne Vega
concert. It was really a good concert, only a little bit short - about 90 minutes.
Oh yes - there was another group performing for about 45 minutes before
Suzanne Vega, called 'The Graduates'. Good, but not my kind of music. Suzanne's
show was - as I said before - a good concert, compared to last week's Peter
Gabriel's good show and concert. I have to admit that I'm relatively new into
Suzanne Vega, and as such am not able to give a list of what she played, but
I think much of the new album and her greatest hits - what else would you 

expect?

The venue in Aschaffenburg - the 'Unterfrankenhalle' is not very big, if you
want you would be able to get about 1500 to 2000 people in it. If you do not
use the curtains you are able to produce another let's say 3000 seats around
the center place, but they didn't let us sit down ;-). The concert was
not sold out, so it wasn't too big a crowd here. We (Ilka and I) wouldn't 

have been able to recognize millions of people behind us - we were at
center stage, first row, within 2 meters of Suzanne's place - GREAT!!! 

:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-).
No wonder we were able to reach that place: I was the second spectator 

entering the hall, only topped by Ilka who was first. And we did arive 

about 20 minutes before opening.

Now, Ilka, I think this time you saw everything that was to see, didn't you?
No complaints about 'I'm too small, can't see anything'?

After the concert we were searching the stage entrance, waiting for Suzanne
coming out. There were about 15 people waiting outside, and after some
quarrelings with some 'official people' who said 'Suzanne just can't give
autographs today' and about 15 people who didn't give up and kept waiting
Suzanne appeared - very, very shy. I would say she's the exact opposite of
Tori in this case. I think if you say something a little bit too loud to
her she might faint. Of course she has the right to do so, but anyhow
- we got our autographs...

So, I have to get this out such that it has a chance to reach the internet
before Ilka has a chance to spoil my message. (This is at least valid for rdt 

readers).

Bye,

Uli
