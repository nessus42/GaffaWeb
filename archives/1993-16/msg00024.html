&gt;   I thought MTV wouldn't play the original "Running Up That Hill"
&gt;   (the grey leotard/masks version) because it was too risque, e.g.
&gt;   people grabbing each other in a non-violent way (gasp)....I don't
&gt;   disbelieve Doug's version via J.Carter Bush, but to me this sounds
&gt;   like the same sort of excuse MTV gave when they wouldn't play
&gt;   Michael Jackson, e.g. "not enough people listen to him" when the
&gt;   real reason was that he was bl**k....

This "too risque" rumour is one that *I* actually started with
absolutely no foundation.  Unfortunately, once you start a rumour it
seems to gather a life of its own.

This rumour started when someone (I can't remember who) who had seen
the video told me that it was rather erotic.  I had not seen it yet,
so I envisioned something a bit more risque than the actual product.
Later, but still before I was able to see the video, I heard that MTV
refused to play it.  Thus, I publicly posited that MTV had censored
the video because it was too erotic.

Once I saw the video, it became obvious that no one who could sit
through the dozens of of scantily clad women and ersatz sex acts per
hour that typifies MTV could hardly be offended by Kate's innocent
video.  Therefore, I became more determined to get to the truth, which
is why I asked John Carder Bush.  Of course, the truth makes much less
exciting folklore than the original tawdry hypothesis, but it also
makes much more sense in light of mundane U.S. corporate
sensibilities.
