&gt;Andrea asks
&gt;&gt;Hands up for all who would leave their continent to see Kate in concert
&gt;&gt;if she were not performing on your own ...... How far would you travel..
&gt;&gt;My SO (whats a SO??) and I were talking and agreed that we would drop
&gt;&gt;everything and fly to England even for one night if we knew in advance
&gt;&gt;we had tickets waiting.
&gt;
&gt;II would definately consider going to another continent to see Kate 
&gt;in concernt, however, WHAT continent would be a major factor
&gt;in my decision.  If it were England for example I would certainly
&gt;consider it.  I would go for much longer than one night though If
&gt;I were going to spend the money on airfare.  Also I wouldn't drop
&gt;everything (just most everything) and I agree, I would DEFINATELY
&gt;want tickets ahead of time.
&gt;
&gt;Eric France makes a very "possible" comment
&gt;&gt;Hmmmmm...maybe we could all chip in a charter a plane......
&gt;
&gt;That is not only a neat idea - going to a Kate concert with a great
&gt;group of Love-Hounds but, A VERY REAL IDEA.
&gt;
&gt;If Kate were going to be in concert and enough People from the
&gt;same contry (AMerica for ex) wanted to go a Charter might be possible.
&gt;
&gt;K.Stauffer
&gt;
Seriously, it would have to have either one pick-up point, or perhaps 
two stops across the country, but a chartered plane might work out well!
I would love to see her...I would need a little time to prepare, and 
hopefully to be ready to spend a week or two where-ever the blessed 
event would be, but I would go *anywhere* to see her (at least once).

I don't suppose you'd fly through Albany, but I could catch your plane 
in NYC if I had to...

Later
Dennis
