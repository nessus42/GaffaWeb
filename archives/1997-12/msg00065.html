&gt;&gt; &gt;but I would be _really_ curious as to why you don't like it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I went back and listened to it yet again after posting...just to make sure.
&gt;&gt; And, yes, I can say quite confidently that I find "The Ninth Wave" to be
&gt;&gt; the biggest load of pretentious nonsense since "Tales of Topographic
&gt;&gt; Oceans" by Yes. I feel like someone is forcing me to listen to the audio
&gt;&gt; portion of a bad art movie without at least letting me be distracted by the
&gt;&gt; visuals. Obtuse dialogue and obscure production may impress the
&gt;&gt; impressionable, but I find it to be hopelessly self-indulgent.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know what's going on here, but at least you're consistent.
&gt;You don't like what I consider the masterpieces of my favorite female
&gt;artist and group!

That's okay. You probably don't think Iggy Pop's "Raw Power" was one of the
pinnacles of art in Western Civilization.

&gt;&gt; Contrast this with the wonderfully well-realized combination of songwriting
&gt;&gt; craft, production and performance in the five songs in "Hounds of Love"
&gt;&gt; sequence.
&gt;
&gt;The worst problem with the HoL side is that, on an admittedly outstanding
&gt;day, more than one of today's "popular" artists could have produced similar
&gt;work.

Similar quality work? Yes. Similar work? No.

&gt;TNW, however, is uniquely a product of the gift of genius that is Kate.

I'll agree with that. With the gift of genius, there are undeniable
liabilities.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It pretty effectively encapsulates _everything_ I like about KB's
&gt;&gt; &gt;music - it's simply a beautifully, beautifully realized work of art.
&gt;    (Amen!)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think TNW allows KB's worst tendencies for pretension run wild for
&gt;&gt; far too long.
&gt;
&gt;Have you watched _The_Line,_the_Cross_and_the_Curve_?  (Now there *I*
&gt;go! At least you won't be hanging alone.)

Thanks.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I would cautiously
&gt;&gt; &gt;propose that it is one of those things that transcends such oppositions as
&gt;&gt; &gt;good/bad;  i.e. you may not _like_ it, but you still recognize its merit,
&gt;&gt; &gt;correct?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry, but I don't recognize its merit. I think TNW is something we're
&gt;&gt; supposed to be kind about, right?
&gt;
&gt;No.
&gt;This group uniformly (until now :) recognizes the genius of TNW.
&gt;(Actually, since I don't know how you feel about using smileys,
&gt;I would guess you are joking here.)

I would guess that some people on the list are afraid to express an
unpopular opinion.

&gt;&gt; &gt; just wondering - I hate to just _assume_ that you are a pod
&gt;&gt; &gt;person!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm a singles person. I think KB's best work is when she makes
&gt;&gt; herself accessible in the more structured environment than the
&gt;&gt; less-disciplined album setting.
&gt;
&gt;One more thing... How did you like Pink Floyd's _The_Wall_?

I haven't thought much about Pink Floyd since Syd Barrett was kicked out.

&gt;And then...

&gt;&gt; &gt;i could argue that the 'hounds of love' side has a thematic quality to it
&gt;&gt; &gt;also,

&gt;&gt; It would most likely be an unsuccessful argument, however.
&gt;
&gt;Yet it is long-standing doctrine in this group.

Okay. You string the videos for "HoL," "Cloudbusting," "The Big Sky" and
"RUTH" together and tell me that there's a thematic quality. If you can
make that stretch, you must be the Rubberband Guy. They're just five songs
that didn't fit into "TNW" fiasco.

&gt;Let me close by saying I don't see how someone can consider Kate a
&gt;uniquely gifted artist (and I haven't seen Don make that claim) and
&gt;not appreciate TNW.

She's obviously a uniquely gifted artist. For me, TNW encapsulates the
aspects of her music I find most troubling. You're free to revel in her
self-indulgence. I like it better when she reaches out.

&gt;But then, I like much a what Tori Amos has done, until BfP.

Oh. I think TA is horrible.

Quick, completely true story: My wife comes home one day. She says, "I
heard this song on the radio. I think it was Kate Bush, but it wasn't very
good. Does she do a song called 'Cornflake Girl'?"

- Don
