&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm relatively new to the list, have been subscribed for about three
&gt; months, but haven't really had much to say. It's always great to see
&gt; others on the list has to say because it gets me that much more
&gt; interested in the performer, more informed, or educated when I didn't
&gt; have the time to research - or money for the zines :(.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, a while back, someone had posted their top five favorite songs by
&gt; K.B. and I was glad to see what had come about. I myself couldn't put
&gt; together quite the comprehensive list as some of you had, due to the
&gt; fact that I only have three of these magnificent pieces o' work that we
&gt; all comment about. But if I had to narrow it down, my favorites, for now
&gt; come off of the "The Sensual World" album. That's mainly due to the fact
&gt; that it is my first experience with Kate, and my, what an experience.
&gt; #;)
&gt; 
&gt; I then shifted myself to some research on some of her earlier music. I
&gt; had found out four years ago, that Pat Benatar (another of my faves) had
&gt; a covered of a Kate tune. That's when I decided that I had to hear the
&gt; original.  WOW!!!  was my response, what an experience. She was great
&gt; then, and hasn't seemed to lose her maturity since.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't bought any other albums other the three I have right now, can
&gt; assist me in my purchasing probs? btw, the three I have: TSW, The Kick
&gt; Inside and The Red Shoes. I have seen some others out, but was hesitant
&gt; (or fell toward my current listening taste.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; el mew
&gt; she pads, paws...,
&gt; pads, paws and claws.
&gt; 
&gt; 

If you can find it and can afford the money get the box set.  You will get
everyting through The Senuous World plus 2 cd's of b sides and remixes.

The price is steep, about $150, but it's worth it to have a comprehensive
copy of the material.
