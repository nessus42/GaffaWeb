Interesting, all these top fives that are being posted. 
	For every album that Kate brings out, I always find myself completely
besotted by the majority of songs on the album. But there is always one
song on an album that I find disappointing, annoying, or simply paling
against the other magnificent works on the same disk. Thus, here is my
list of the disappointing songs on each of her albums. Before I present
this list, my humble apologies to all KB fans who find their favourite
songs on this list. I would, however, be interested to hear from other
fans as to which songs of hers they found disappointing too.
	Here goes:
	KICK INSIDE: Them Heavy People. I have always found it too
nursery-rhymish. It is also the only song on that album that sounds as
if a 16-year-old wrote it (as opposed to the rest which sounds as if it
were written by a person who had lived 16 lives).
	LIONHEART: Hammer Horror. Cute lyrics but the melody does nothing to
me. However, a great find would be the version she did of this when she
came to Australia in 1978/79 to promote the album. She performed the
song on COUNTDOWN with a masked male, who proceded to throw her around
and generally try to scare the shit out of her. Without that video,
though, I find the song dull. It sort of plods, doesn't it?
	NEVER FOR EVER: All We Ever Look For. Hasn't really stood the test of
time. A little sophmoric, too. ''But we never do score'' sounds as if
poor Kate was at the end of her tether with that chorus and didn't know
what to do. Stubbing out her 45th cigarette for the day, and popping her
fifth chocolate bar down her mouth, she threw up her hands, yelled ''sod
it!'' to Del and scribbled down the ''score'' line. DEFINITELY the song
she was alluding to when she asked us to be kind to her mistakes on the
boxed set.
	THE DREAMING: Suspended In Gaffa. I find the shrieking back-up vocals
annoying after the 125th ''I want it all''.
	HOUND OF LOVE: Sorry, this one I cannot and refuse to choose a weak
song since it is a masterpiece. Though if someone were threatening to
pull out my fingernails while flaying me alive, I would suggest Mother
Stands For Comfort.
	SENSUAL WORLD: The Fog. After what I think is a weak second song, Love
&amp; Anger, comes this song which almost delivers a fatal blow to the
album. Then the rest of it picks up. I guess it's coz Sensual World is
one of my all-time favourite KB tracks that anything that follows must
concede defeat. By the way, isn't Rocket's Tail simply brilliant at the
end?
	RED SHOES: Eat The Music. Whatever possessed her to even consider this
as a single? Uninspiring rotating melody coupled with very average
lyrics.
	That's it. There are other parts of songs of hers I find not up to
scratch ... that rather cliched ''sometimes a new-born baby cries'' bit
on I'm Still Waiting ... the wide-eyed revelation that she was dancing
with Hitler in ''Heads We're Dancing'' (wow, as if we hadn't guessed)
... the ''push and pull'' of Reaching Out (sort of pushed that concept
to the limit already with The Dreaming) ... and the Trio Bulgarka
wearing out their welcome on Red Shoes ... but such bits are outweighed
by other shades of brilliance within the songs.
	Best wishes,
	Andrew
