    Well somebody compared the Innocence Mission to Kate and I'm a big fan
of a band that has been compared favorably to IM so does that mean I
can compare them to KAte?  I will anyway.  They're a band called OVER
THE RHINE and they are on IRS records.  Their lead singer, Karin
Berquist has an incredible voice and in the past 5 years she has
served as kind of a "surrogate Kate" for me since she is as about as
close to the real thing as I'll ever get=(
   Sorry you wonderful people across the pond, but IRS hasn't released
their records "Patience" or "Eve" over there yet but they have toured
in England and fell in love with the place.  Nothing will ever replace
Kate in my heart, but Over The Rhine's music (intelligent lyrics, haunting melodies,and Miss Berquist's voice) have helped me pass the time between Kate releases.
-- BTY Whatever became of the RED SHOES Tour?  I remember in an old
issue of Homeground that at a KATE convention just prior to the
Release of Red Shoes that KAte announced that she might tour to
support it.  Also I have had friends swear that she did perform in LA around the time ofHOL. Vicious lies I say, designed to send me into spirals of depression but any truth to them?
