Hi,
 
OOh, I'm really behind on my mail. Happens when your phone bill
gets too high, I guess...
 
Anyway, on April Fools day, Uli wrote:
 
&gt; There's no such thing as THE rectangular box of TRS, since there
&gt; are at least three different ones, in addition to the heart
&gt; shaped one. For the discography I'd like to have some more
&gt; information about the boxes and the contents of them, so if
&gt; anyone can help out, I'd be grateful forever. Here's what I
&gt; know/suspect about:
&gt;
&gt; Kate Bush Shoe Box
&gt; CD+ CD by EMI, rest ?
&gt; I/NL        CD: 7243 8 27277 2 9/F: PM 520,
&gt;
&gt; I: 072/UK: CDEMD 1047
&gt;     black shoe box with red printing &amp; drawn picture of ballet
&gt; shoes, red insert, black T-shirt with red printing &amp; pic (same as
&gt; box), black button with gold printing &amp; pic (same as box, but
&gt; without 'Shoe Box'), insert has a certificate (ltd. ed. of 1500)
 
I don't think I ever saw this one, but since Uli owns this one,
I'll have to assume it exists... :-)
 
&gt; the heart-shaped box
&gt; I have in fact seen it, even held it in my hands, but it was
&gt; still shrink-wrapped and way to expensive to buy. The box is
&gt; rumored to contain some size 4 1/2 dance shoes. Anyone got this?
 
I saw this one at the record fair in Amsterdam last Saturday. I
didn't buy it, since it was way too expensive (some $75) and very
uninteresting. I only saw the two red shoes, nothing else. It was
filled up with some black foamy stuff, and tied with a red ribbon.
I don't think it even contained the CD.
 
Things get kinda fuzzy when Uli mentions:-
 
&gt; red shoe box
&gt; I also did hold this one in my hands, but don't know more about
&gt; it for the same reasons as for the heart-shaped box. Again, it's
&gt; rumored to contain some size 4 1/2 dance shoes. Anyone got this?
[...]
&gt; US ltd. ed. special pack
&gt;     this box was rumored to come out, though I haven't seen
&gt; anyone mentioning to have seen it. It was supposed to have some
&gt; bonus tracks on the CD. Anyone got such a thing? [it was even
&gt; supposed to be an official item]
 
I saw neither of these, I think. However, there _is_ an
"unofficial" 'Red shoes' box, which isn't mentioned. It's black on
the outside, and contains small red shoes, the CD, and a
certificate of "authenticity". It was shown to me in 1993 in a
record shop in Rotterdam, and, as you can imagine, again I wasn't
interested.
 
Uli continues:-
&gt; UK promo shoe box
&gt;     It could be seen on the telly when Ray Cokes interviewed Kate
&gt; on the phone for MTV [Europe] Most Wanted show. It contained some
&gt; very small red dance shoes (like made for a doll, smaller than
&gt; babies' feet), the CD and some info sheets. Anyone got this?
&gt;
&gt; UK promo shoe box
&gt;     this one was given away as the price for the KompeTition on
&gt; the Konvention in London in 94. Unfortunately none of the winners
&gt; was close enough for me to beg for a look into the boxes... Maybe
&gt; this one is the same as the last? Anyone got this?
&gt;
&gt; UK promo shoe box
&gt;    this one is supposed to contain the CD, as well as a VHS video
&gt; (Rubberband Girl UK video, Moments of Pleasure from Aspel &amp;
&gt; Company), as well as a biography and a pen. ltd. edition of 1000.
&gt; Anyone got this?
 
That's three mentions for one item! At least, I think so. What Ray
Cokes showed the European audience was the official EMI promo box
I held in my hands at a record fair in Amsterdam back in October
1993. For the contents I quote a piece from the UK "Record
Collector" magazine, published October 1993:
 
-------------------------
"THE RED SHOES" PROMO BOX
 
Sure to form part of any future rarities listing is the promotional
shoebox designed to whet critics' appetites for Kate Bush's lastest
album.
This 1,000-only collectible, which is shoebox shaped (size 4-and-a-
half, of course, as per Kate's feet), is still being manifactured
as we go to press, but word has it that it will include a special
fountain pen; a video, which will probably feature the "Rubberband
Girl" excerpt from the "The Red Shoes"  film, A CD of the album;
and a biography printed on parchment paper, neatly tied with red
ribbon.
-------------------------
 
Note that...
...I don't know what a "fountain pen" is, but it was black, and
tied with a red ribbon.
...I didn't see the video, but it could very well contain both the
RBG clip and the Aspel performance, I vaguely recall the dealer
mentioning something like that.
...Next to the things mentioned above, there was also a slide
contained in the box, with a picture of Kate dressed in a black
dress, and, of course, the small red shoes Ray Cokes tried on as
earrings... :)
 
I didn't buy this beauty of a box, due to the going rate of 400
Guilders, some $225. It will undoubtedly be worth even more now.
 
Hope this info clears up some Red Shoe Box confusion.
