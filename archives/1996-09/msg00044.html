Hi Love Dogs, someone sent this to me and I thought everyone would get a
kick out of it.

&gt;                HORROR MOVIE SURVIVAL GUIDE
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    * When it appears that you have killed the monster, *never* check
&gt;&gt;      to see if it's really dead.
&gt;&gt;    * If you find that your house is built upon or near a cemetery, was
&gt;&gt;      once a church that was used for black masses, had previous
&gt;&gt;      inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some
&gt;&gt;      horrible fashion, or had inhabitants who performed necrophilia or
&gt;&gt;      satanic practices in your house move away immediately.
&gt;&gt;    * Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke.
&gt;&gt;    * Do not search the basement, especially if the power has just gone
&gt;&gt;      out.
&gt;&gt;    * If your children speak to you in Latin or any other language
&gt;&gt;      which they should not know, or if they speak to you using a voice
&gt;&gt;      which is other than their own, shoot them immediately. It will
&gt;&gt;      save you a lot of grief in the long run. NOTE: It will probably
&gt;&gt;      take several rounds to kill them, so be prepared.
&gt;&gt;    * When you have the benefit of numbers, *never* pair off and go it
&gt;&gt;      alone.
&gt;&gt;    * As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open portals to Hell.
&gt;&gt;    * Never stand in, on, above, below, beside, or anywhere near a
&gt;&gt;      grave, tomb, crypt, mausoleum, or other house of the dead.
&gt;&gt;    * If you're searching for something which caused a noise and find
&gt;&gt;      out that it's just the cat, *leave the room immediately if you
&gt;&gt;      value your life.*
&gt;&gt;    * If appliances start operating by themselves, move out.
&gt;&gt;    * Do not take *anything* from the dead.
&gt;&gt;    * If you find a town which looks deserted, it's probably for a
&gt;&gt;      reason. Take the hint and stay away.
&gt;&gt;    * Don't fool with recombinant DNA technology unless you're sure you
&gt;&gt;      know what you are doing.
&gt;&gt;    * If you're running from the monster, expect to trip or fall down
&gt;&gt;      at least twice, more if you are of the female persuasion. Also
&gt;&gt;      note that, despite the fact that you are running and the monster
&gt;&gt;      is merely shambling along, it's still moving fast enough to catch
&gt;&gt;      up with you.
&gt;&gt;    * If your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic
&gt;&gt;      behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes,
&gt;&gt;      increasing hairiness, and so on, get away from them as fast as
&gt;&gt;      possible.
&gt;&gt;    * Stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which are
&gt;&gt;      listed here: Amityville, Elm Street, Transylvania, Nilbog (God
&gt;&gt;      help you if you recognize this one), the Bermuda Triangle, or any
&gt;&gt;      small town in Maine.
&gt;&gt;    * If your car runs out of gas at night, do not go to the nearby
&gt;&gt;      deserted-looking house to phone for help.
&gt;&gt;    * Beware of strangers bearing tools such as chainsaws, staple guns,
&gt;&gt;      hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawnmowers,
&gt;&gt;      butane torches, soldering irons, band saws, or any device made
&gt;&gt;      from deceased companions.
&gt;&gt;    * Listen closely to the soundtrack; and pay attention to the
&gt;&gt;      audience, since they are usually far more intelligent than you
&gt;&gt;      could ever hope to be.
&gt;&gt;
