Hi -

I was just at my local Tower (ooh, THERE'S a surprise!), and
I spied with my little eye - a copy of the book "Kate Bush Complete".
Yeah, I'd seen it before, but the $20.00 price tag always stopped
me from buying it.  Well, kids, I saw it on sale there for only $9.00!
Naturally, I grabbed it.  Sorry, it was the only copy there (that I
saw), but everyone here might want to run down to their local
Tower to see if they have it, too (while you're there, pick up
a copy of "Boys for Pele".  Pick up two, because if you're like
me you'll wear out the first one from the laser cutting into the
CD in the player so much).

But I digress.  The book.  It's printed by EMI Music Publishing,
so I guess it's official (although how much say Kate had in to
it - if any - is questionable).  It has a nice intro from Peter
Fitzgerals-Morris of Homeground (and Lovehound) fame;
then, in no particular order:

All the lyrics up to and including Experiment IV; INCLUDING
THE B-SIDES!

All the music for the above!  (Too bad I can't read music...)

A great discography, Including info I haven't seen in the FAQ
or even The Garden, including how well each album sold.
OK, I know someone's going to ask (Uli, get ready to cut'n'
paste some more), so here they are:

The Kick Inside - Triple Platinum
Lionheart - Gold
Never For Ever - Platinum
The Dreaming - Gold
Hounds of Love - Double Platinum

Wuthering Heights - Gold
Babooshka - Silver
Running Up That Hill - Silver

(When the book was published, "The Whole Story" was
still on the charts, so that's where it ends).  I have no
idea what "Platinum", "Gold", and especially "Silver"
mean in Britain, but there you have it.

Oh, it also has a nice chronology (From where I assume
IED got a lot of his for The Garden), and TONS of
great photos (mostly from videos; however painful
they are to watch when they're moving, they do get
some nice stills).

- Stev0 the complete

"Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow, Unbelievable"
 - How I thought the lyrics went, until I got this book
