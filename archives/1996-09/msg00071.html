    HOW MANY LEVELS THERE ARE IN THE SONGS OF KATE? (Sphinx
questions)

   I have discovered 3 different levels. It's possible there are
more.

   The first one, - the most obvious level -  is basically
EXTERNAL, this is, it is based in facts external to Kate,
although "dressed", so as to say, with her fantasy.

   The second level, instead, is PERSONAL. It deals with some
personal experiences of her, NEVER in a TOO explicit way, often
in a disguised way, specially when she referes to both people and
places linked more o less intimately with her.

   The third level is difficult to label. The words that would
describe it are currently very degradated. They are lost its
original meaning. In this level she transmits fragments of a
very, VERY old knowledge.


   A case in point: "And Dream Of Sheep".

- First level: The tale already explained for Kate in some
interviews.

- Second level: Concealed in a very clever way by means of
"Lawful inexactitudes" and also through this short of message by
radio recorded in a very low volume, in sentences such as "come
to Elliott Institute".

- Third level: Contained in words such as "sheep", "sleep",
"poppies", "seed", etcetera. And in sentences such as "...they
smell like sleep".

   The levels are interlaced. The very same word or sentence may
have a meaning in a level and another one in a different level.
