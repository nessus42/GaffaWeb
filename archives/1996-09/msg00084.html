  Perhaps I've been working on the Kate Bush Web Page too much 
lately: installing a search engine; hassling with perl scripts 
to build a guestbook and the Talk to Kate page; putting up the 
Kate Bush Web; and hundreds of lines of text, photos and 
movies.
  Too much, really.
***
  I had this dream this morning. I was able to go to a Kate 
concert. The music was beautiful, haunting, surreal. When it 
was over, I realized that there were t-shirts available, but I 
had no money.
  I raced out of the concert hall, back to my house (early 
de-construction, kind of like the houses in Eraserhead). I got 
$20 and made it back to the hall wearing only a pair of pants 
and a long coat; I remember thinking I'd left my shirt at home 
so I could put on the t-shirt immediately.
  The hall was empty. The salesman gone. I was about to leave 
when the scene shifted. I was outside, again in an 
Eraserhead-type setting. There was a shattered building behind 
me, and a large yellow schoolbus in front.
  The schoolbus was Kate's touring vehicle, and she was 
holding court in the building behind me.
  I looked around and saw Kate.
  Then I realized that everyone, male and female, looked like 
Kate. Some were brothers and sisters. Others were roadies. 
There were very young Kates (9-10 years old) and more mature 
Kates (35-50).
  But there was only one real Kate.
  Kate didn't talk to me in this Dreaming, but her much 
younger look-alike sister did. She got me the t-shirt, white 
with orange flames and the words "LoveHound".
  I stashed myself and the t-shirt in the bombed-out building, 
and listened to Kate (though she still never spoke) and her 
court.
  I woke up, but I can't find the t-shirt.
***
  Yep. Definitely spending waaaaayyy too much time 
programming. I need a break. I think this time I'll just 
listen to The Red Shoes and not try to figure out how to get 
it online.
