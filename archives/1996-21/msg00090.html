&gt;BTW, for any Loreena McKennitt fans in the Montreal area, she'll be
&gt;playing at Place des Arts in Montreal on July 1st  as part of the
&gt;Jazz festival.

for completeness sake, here is the full details on loreena's plans for
live performances straight from the horse's mouth.

&gt;From: Karen Shook &lt;karen@quinlan.demon.co.uk&gt; 
&gt;Subject: Quinlan Road tour update
&gt;
&gt;Dear Old Ways listmembers,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you to those listmembers who have posted information about dates. If
&gt;we do 
&gt;not update you first it is because we are waiting until all details are 
&gt;confirmed, to make it more convenient and informative for you.
&gt;
&gt;I'm absolutely certain I will have to repeat all this eighty times (then again, 
&gt;it shows that people are interested!) but I hope you will try to read the 
&gt;following information carefully to save wear and tear on my typing fingers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;                   Loreena McKennitt tour dates 1996
&gt;
&gt;1. Loreena is not doing a "tour" per se. She is working on a new album and she 
&gt;will do a full tour -  yes, probably including your town or somewhere close
&gt;- in 
&gt;1997 when the new album comes out.
&gt;
&gt;2. She is doing four (or possibly five) dates this year, accompanied by her 
&gt;band, in the month of July. I have no reason to think that there will be any 
&gt;other dates or that she will suddenly play in Dallas, or Dublin, or Dusseldorf.
&gt;If she does, I will put it on the website. I do not think it is likely that she
&gt;will.
&gt;
&gt;3. Here are the dates. Please check your local papers for details of tickets 
&gt;and showtimes and venue address. I cannot, unfortunately, give you exhaustive 
&gt;information about every aspect of the dates. I do not,  for example, have 
&gt;detailed information regarding the street address of your nearest ticket sales 
&gt;office or the like.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;JULY 1 - MONTREAL, QUEBEC, CANADA - Place Des Arts capacity 2,900
&gt;         This appearance is part of the Montreal Jazz Festival. 
&gt;
&gt;JULY 2 - POSSIBLE SECOND DATE, Montreal, Quebec, Canada - Place Des Arts
&gt;         This possible second date is as yet unannounced and unconfirmed.
&gt;
&gt;JULY 6 - ISTANBUL, TURKEY - Open Air Theatre, Harbiye, Istanbul cap. 3,950
&gt;         This appearance is part of the Istanbul Jazz Festival
&gt;
&gt;JULY 9 - ATHENS, GREECE - Lykabetus Theatre, Athens capacity 4,000
&gt;         This show is being promoted by local agent RealMusic
&gt;
&gt;JULY 27 - SPILIMBERGO, ITALY - Folkest '96
&gt;         Loreena's appearance is part of this well-known folk/diverse music
&gt;         festival. It is an outdoor appearance.
&gt;
&gt;JULY 28 - CATANIA, SICILY, ITALY - Chiostro Instituto A. Gioeni - capacity 6,000
&gt;         Loreena is appearing as part of the Estate Catanese week-long arts 
&gt;         festival. Tickets 20,000 and 25,000 lire. Promoter is Modena 
&gt;         International Music. 
&gt;
&gt;4. Those *were* the dates. I do not expect that there will be any other dates 
&gt;this year. Please remember that I try to answer your correspondence promptly
&gt;but 
&gt;I receive between 30 and 50 e-mail queries a day, and that's only a tiny bit of 
&gt;what I have to do in a day. Once again: these are the only dates this year. 
&gt;Please check local listings for further details if you are considering
&gt;attending 
&gt;any of these concerts.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Karen Shook
