Thanks Tippi for the info w.r.t. CFNY.  I've been so busy of late that I
haven't been able to tune in or keep in touch.  B.T.W.  The OCR was
successful.  Sorry for the delay.

Just finished listening to "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy".  I think its Sarah's
best album yet.  I still think she "suffers" from a kind of "musical sameness"
throughout all of her material but she has enough GEMS that do stand out.
Possession, Mary, Circle, Ice Cream and Fear are all excellent.....especially
Fear. The current trend of 60's music which has invaded the music of many bands
is present throughout FTE.....but it is a much more successful fusion than with
other bands I've heard. FTE hints at even better things to come.....highly
recommended.

Strange Phenomena?  I had the weirdest dream w.r.t. Kate touring.  This "tour"
was in the future....20 years or more.....and it was a "tribute" thing...like
Beatlemania.  However, it was more theatrical, dark and serious...almost like
a moody interpretation of Kate's music by another singer.  Unfortunately,
this "production" ended when I woke up....before the singer began!  I just
remember seeing "previews" of set designs, interviews and costumes.
I did not dream of the real Kate and it appears that her popularity had not
increased over years....a feeling I got from the would-be-Kate. The production
was the culmination of a personal goal to bring Kate's music "out" again.

Les
