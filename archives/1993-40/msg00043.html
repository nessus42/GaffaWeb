&gt;Our National Stereo radio station (5-FM) just played the title track
&gt;in full, what a treat.
&gt;
&gt;Interesting (and I haven't seen anyone else mention it) was the
&gt;lyric (roughly): "This line, this curve, this cross" about 3/4 way
&gt;through the track.  Reference to the movie, naturally.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone heard this track enough times to actually transcribe
&gt;lyrics?? All I've seen to date were the 4 tracks Jorn posted way
&gt;back in July.
&gt;
These should be at least semi-accurate ...

Oh she moved like a diva [?] do
I said I'd love to dance like you
She said just take off my red shoes
Put them on and your dream will come true
With no words, with no song, you can dance a dream with your body on
And this curve, it's your smile
And this cross, it's your heart
And this line, is your path
Oh it's going to be the way you always thought it would be
There's going to be no illusion
Oh it's going to be the way you always dreamt about it
There's going to be really happening to ya
Really happening to ya
Really happening to ya
Oh the minute I put them on
I knew I had done something wrong
I had [?] for the dance had gone
It's the red shoes, they can't stop dancing, dancing
And this curve is your smile
And this cross is your heart
And this line is your path
Oh it's going to be the way you always thought it would be
There's going to be no illusion
Oh it's going to be the way you always dreamt about it
But it's really going to be happening to ya
She's gotta dance
She's gotta dance
She can't stop 'til her shoes come off
The shoes do, have voodoo
They're going to make her dance 'til her legs fall off
Yeah
See her come tumbling down
'Til her feet start kissing the ground
Feel her arms are open out
See her eyes are lifted to God
With no words, with no song
We're going to dance a dream and make the dream come true
I'm going to dance a dream and make a dream come true
She's gotta dance
She's gotta dance
She can't stop 'til her shoes come off
The shoes do, have voodoo
They're going to make her dance 'til her legs fall off
Call a doctor, call a priest
They're going to wing her up like a helicopter
Really happening to ya
Really happening to ya
You've got to dance
You've got to dance
You've got to dance, yeah
