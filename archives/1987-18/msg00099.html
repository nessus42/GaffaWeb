NOTE: Re-post to Stanzel.

 &gt;  From: Allen Reneer
 &gt;  To: Love-Hounds
 &gt;  Reneerb@BYUVAX

 &gt; Why has the group been so quiet lately?

&gt; Although a silent member of the group I am none the less an avid Kate fan and
&gt; have really enjoyed this group.

     A fair question, which deserves an honest answer. For the past few
months, IED, at least, has been giving much less time to the group
than formerly. The main reasons for this were the chronic delays
in distribution (which Doug has explained since), and the general
drop in interest in discussing Kate Bush in Love-Hounds (in favour
of lengthy postings of "XTC" track-listings, etc.). During this same
period, IED naively participated in what was supposed to be an improved
alternative group for serious Kate discussions. Except for some
excellent postings from marK T. Ganzer, the experimental secession was a
waste of time.
     So, IED hereby gratefully returns to the fold, and henceforward
will concentrate on Love-Hounds chat. He humbly asks the group's
forgiveness for his ill-conceived wanderlust, and promises to give
the marriage another try.

 &gt; Subject: posting
 &gt;
 &gt;a big THANKS to Andrew Marvick for that amazingly complete listing
 &gt;of Kate's stuff...I am going to bust it for all I have to get hold
 &gt;of those b-sides.   Regarding the bootlegs that were mentioned, I
 &gt;know that the sound quality of the one recorded live in Bristol is
 &gt;poor...are any of the others any better?  Does anyone know?

     Well, a big YOU'RE WELCOME from IED backatcha, Pete. And thanks,
also, for drawing the errors to his attention. It always helps to have
a second proof-reader, especially for free. It's gratifying to see that
IED's lists are getting a careful inspection, too.
    About the bootlegs: First, if you're after the b-sides, keep an
eye peeled for the _Passing Through Air_ 2-LP boot, unless you really
must have original pressings. The audio is not bad, but it is a definite
notch or two below the original twelve-inches, etc.
    Second, IED only knows the Bristol boot's sound via its original
cassette version (ca. 1984). In that form, the audio was very poor
indeed. If, as you say, the very recent 2-LP vinyl edition contains
a live version of "Egypt", and that track is really from the Bristol
concert, then it may be worth the money for that track alone --
it's very different from the official studio version, as Doug has
mentioned before. Heretofore, that version of "Egypt" has only been
known to IED through two terrible recordings, one from the Paris tape,
the other from the unreleased video footage from the Hammersmith film,
shown only once, at the Romford convention in 1985.

 &gt;I have seen references to "Coffee Homeground", a Kate fan magazine...
 &gt;How does one subscribe?
 &gt;Thanks all responders!
 &gt;
 &gt; --  Pete Hartman

Sounds like you heard of _Homeground_, "The International Kate
Bush Fanzine", which was started by three loyal English Kate fans
at the end of 1981, and which just put out its twenty-eighth
invaluable issue. _Homeground_ is the longest running and most
important Kate 'zine (outside of the KBC Newsletter, of course).
One year's sub., airmail to the U.S. runs about 11 Pounds. Their address is:

 _Homeground_
 Peter Fitzgerald-Morris, Krystina Fitzgerald and Dave Cross, editors
 P.O. Box 176
 Orpington
 Kent BR5 3NA
 England

Thanks to jw for his notes re Joyce, and to Michael Knight for his
appreciative words, too. Kevin G. probably won't be getting $150
from the Love-Hounds anytime soon, so meanwhile, Kevin, you can
order a copy of _Kate Bush Complete_ through "The Music Machine",
a U.S. mail-order business that advertises in every issue of the
_Goldmine_ record collectors' magazine. Their ad is always on either
the front or the back inside cover. Their price for _KBC_ is $18.00
plus postage, which is a bit high, but not beyond reason.

&gt;I will say that what I could make out of that version makes me very
&gt;interested in trying to find the 3-lp set mentioned in hopes that
&gt;it, taken from "official" video releases, will have a much higher
&gt;audio quality.  (I can't stand an album that sounds like it was made
&gt;on a portable tape player with those cheesy condenser mikes....)

Don't get your hopes up. The source tapes for _all_ of the bootlegs
of the Hammersmith concert, "Kate" TV special, Bristol concert
and Paris concert are the same, no matter what edition the boot.
If you have any version of all of the above, there is no reason at
all to go wasting money on the _Live in Europe '79 - '80_ 3-LP set.
And yes, it is depressing.

-- Andrew Marvick
