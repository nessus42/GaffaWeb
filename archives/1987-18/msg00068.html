Here is a nearly complete listing of Kate Bush's recorded music, Pete.
I hope the info you seek is findable among all the detail and laser
commands. Sorry about the length, Doug, but I can't send to Pete direct.

-- Andrew Marvick

.ce Catalogue of Kate Bush's Recorded Music
.pf

.ce Compiled by Andrew Marvick (last update 10/08/87)

     &lt;Here is the latest version of my list of all the Kate Bush music
that I know of. Note that this is not meant to be a
discography, but simply a list of every snippet of KT music
known by me to be in circulation. Recordings are listed in
.bf ital;rough
.pf
chronological order. As a reference point, a very brief listing
of Kate's official UK releases to date precedes the non-LP list.
     &lt;A complete discography, including all foreign pressings
with their catalogue numbers, is impracticable. EMI has many, many
divisions throughout the world. Yesterday I saw an advertisement for
EMI-Singapore pressings of two Kate Bush records. And who knows whether
EMI-Pakistan and EMI-Peru haven't
pressed some Kate Bush records, too? If there's one thing I've
learned in my nine years and six months of Kate Bush
fanaticism, it is that even the wealthiest and most monomaniacal fan
cannot hope to amass a "complete" colleKTion, or compile a
definitive KaTalogue.&gt;

II.
.bf ital;Non-LP Kate Bush music:
.pf

 1. "Maybe". One of Kate's earliest recordings with the KT Bush Band,
this track dates from 1973, when Kate was fourteen or fifteen. It was
recorded at David Gilmour's home studio, under his direction, along
with an unspecified number of other original compositions, including
"Passing Through Air" (number 2 on this list). "Maybe" was originally
entitled "Davy". An earlier version of this song may have been part of
Kate's first-ever collection of demos, which were recorded a year or
more earlier, and submitted to record companies without success. This
version, too, failed to interest the labels, and in 1975 Gilmour
arranged for a third recording session, during which a more polished
version of this song, together with the now well-known tracks
"The Man With the Child In His Eyes" and "Saxaphone Song", were
recorded, and used successfully for obtaining a contract for Kate
with EMI. "Maybe" was never officially released, but Kate
once played about two verses
and one chorus of the first Gilmour version during a British radio
interview.

 2. "Passing Through Air". One of the b-sides to the "Army Dreamers"
single, it was recorded in 1973, at "Dave (Gilmour)'s house".
(A rumour persists, largely thanks
to an article published in the April '87 issue of the UK magazine
.bf ital;Record Collector,
.pf
that a dozen or so of Kate's early demo recordings -- featuring songs
that have never been officially released -- does exist, and that limited
quantities of the record, pressed in East Germany a couple of years ago,
survived EMI's clampdown on the release. Another rumour still circulates
that a bootleg LP of Pink Floyd recordings features a few of these demos
on one side.
There is still no evidence of the existence of such records,
however: no fan has ever reported
seeing or hearing any of the demos, and no bootlegs have surfaced,
making their actual existence appear to be very
doubtful.

 3. "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" (with spoken introduction). The
only distinction of this original UK single mix is a strange
spoken introduction in which Kate repeats the words "He's here!"
which was added just prior to the song's release as a single in 1978.

 4. "Kite". Sung live on German television (host Dr. Alfred Biolek) in
early 1978, with the KT Bush Band supplying live backup.

 5. "Wuthering Heights". Sung live on German television in 1978, with
a pre-recorded backing track.

 6.
.bf ital;On Stage.
.pf
A four-track EP of "live" performances from the Tour of
Life, featuring "Them Heavy People", "Don't Put Your Foot on the
Heartbrake","L'Amour Looks Something Like You", and a long
version of "James and the Cold Gun". The original performances were
taken from the May 13, 1979 concert at London's Hammersmith-Odeon,
and then carefully polished in the studio. Significant differences are
thus detectable between the less elaborately re-mixed film soundtrack
and the EP mix.

 7.
.bf ital;Live at the Hammersmith Odeon.
.pf
The official video release,
including performances of twelve songs from the Tour of Life.
There are a few interesting musical changes from the LP
versions, notably the long instrumental introduction to
"Kite" and the early version of "Violin" (with non-LP lyrics).

 8.
.bf ital;Kate Bush -- In Concert.
.pf
A German/Dutch TV documentary featuring a long interview and live
performances of songs from the Tour of Life that were never officially
released. The concert footage comes from the Hamburg and Mannheim shows.

 9.
.bf ital;Wow!
.pf
One of the first bootleg Kate Bush albums, this 2-LP set was put
out in 1983 by a New York-based outfit. It consists of a transfer onto vinyl
of the
.bf ital;Hammersmith
.pf
video's audio track (see entry no. 7), and another vinyl
transfer of the audio portion of Kate's 1979 UK Christmas television
special (see entry no. 12 below for details about this latter program).
Both recordings have appeared more recently in a made-in-UK bootleg 2-LP
set called
.bf ital;Moving,
.pf
as well; and also as 2 of the 3 records
which comprise the recent U.S.-made
.bf ital;Kate Bush Live in Europe '79-80
.pf
bootleg set.
In addition, nine tracks from
.bf ital;Hammersmith
.pf
turned up as a third
bootleg LP called
.bf ital;A Bird in the Hand.
.pf
There are very likely
additional editions of these tapes.

 10.
.bf ital;Live in Paris '79.
.pf
Another bootleg by the New York group,
this record features part of the Paris concert, which was given at
the Theatre des Champs-Elysees on May 6, 1979. This record includes some
interesting versions of LP tracks, including the very different live
arrangement of
"Egypt". The identical recording was also included as the third LP
in the recent
.bf ital;Live in Europe '79-80'
.pf
bootleg set mentioned
in entry no. 9 above. This first edition is identified as being a
production of the non-existent "Fan Club of Taiwan". The same
recording has also appeared as an audio-cassette.

 11.
.bf ital;Kate Bush.
.pf
The only title of a UK bootleg audio-cassette which
includes ninety minutes of performance -- all but five songs -- from the
April 9, 1979 concert from the Bristol Hippodrome. This tape features
a chant, readings by John Carder Bush, and incidental bits of music,
all of which were heard while Kate changed costumes in between songs
during the concert. Specifically, there is a heartbeat passage preceding
"Room For the Life"; an ethnic chant performed by the band in unison;
two synthesizer introductions to songs; two readings by
John -- one known as "Two in One Coffin" (preceding
"The Kick Inside"), the other a passage of unidentified prose
(probably by John) about children, which precedes "In Search of
Peter Pan";  and a long jam session by the KT Bush Band. Unfortunately,
one of the songs omitted is the live version of "Egypt", which
sounds very different from the LP version.

 12.
.bf ital;Kate.
.pf
This was a forty-five minute television special which aired
in England on December 28, 1979; sometimes called the "Christmas
Special". In addition to a couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one
or two new vocal performances of old songs, several new and
unique bits of music appeared on this show. They include
a brief introduction, a performance of part of Satie's
1st "Gymnopedie" (as an introduction to "Symphony in Blue"),
an early version of "December Will Be Magic Again",
a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel (Kate's guest on the show --
he sings "Here Comes the Flood"), a brief bit of blues piano, and a
duet with Peter of Roy Harper's song, "Another Day".
Approximately one year later Kate and Peter returned to
the studio to re-record this song, and they also co-wrote
a song called "Ibizza" (sic -- Possibly "Ibiza", after the Spanish resort?)
They were "not satisfied with the results", however, and the
project was shelved.

 13. "Let It Be". A live performance of the Beatles song, sung by
Steve Harley, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush during a modified Tour of Life show,
staged at London's Hammersmith-Odeon on May 12, 1979, for the benefit of the
surviving relatives of Bill Duffield, Kate's lighting director for the Tour,
who had died in an accident at the very beginning of the tour.
An excerpt from this performance appears in a very
limited edition red plastic flexi-disc, made officially by the
Kate Bush Club for the Japanese branch of the Club. In addition to
the excerpt from the song, the flexi-disc includes brief spoken messages
from John Carder Bush and Kate. A longer excerpt of the same song
(but without the spoken messages) has recently appeared on a new
2-LP bootleg set called
.bf ital;Passing Through Air
.pf
-- the only unique material
to be found on that bootleg album, which otherwise consists primarily
of more than usually illegal, poor-quality re-pressings of official EMI
b-sides and re-mixes. In addition to songs from The Tour of Life,
this concert
featured a version of
"Them Heavy People" with verses sung by Harley and Gabriel;
"The Woman With the Child In Her Eyes" sung by Harley and Gabriel;
"I Don't Remember" sung as a duet by Gabriel and Kate; and
"Come Up and See Me", sung by Harley, with Kate and Gabriel on backing
vocals. Unfortunately, none of these tracks has yet come into
circulation.

 14. "Blow Away". A live performance given at the London Symphony
Orchestra's 75th anniversary concert, November 18, 1979.

 15. "Kashka From Baghdad". A live solo performance given on a British
television show called
.bf ital;Ask Aspel
.pf
on September 5, 1978.

 16. "The Wedding List". A live performance done during the Prince's
Trust Concert on July 21, 1982. Kate is backed by Phil
Collins on drums, Gary Brooker on keyboards, Pete Townsend and Midge Ure
on guitars and backing vocals, and Mick Karn on bass.

 17. "The Empty Bullring". The b-side to the "Breathing" single.

 18. "Ran Tan Waltz": the b-side to the "Babooshka" single.

 19. "Army Dreamers" (single mix). Unlike the LP mix, this version does not
fade out.

 20. "Them Heavy People", a cover version recorded by EMI artist
Roy Shell on February 21, 1981, to which Kate contributed backing vocals.

 21. "December Will Be Magic Again". The 1981 Christmas single, this
song was actually written much earlier, and was performed both on the
.bf ital;Kate
.pf
program (see entry no. 12), and on Abba's
.bf ital;Winter Snowtime Special
.pf
on December 21, 1979 (in an arrangement featuring bongo drums).

 22. "Warm and Soothing". The b-side of the "December Will Be Magic Again"
single.

 23. "Sing, Children, Sing". A benefit single by Leslie Duncan, with
Kate (virtually indistinguishable) singing in the all-star
back-up chorus, released November 30, 1979.

 24. "You (The Game, Part II). A duet with Roy Harper of his song, on
his album
.bf ital;The Unknown Soldier,
.pf
recorded in February, 1980.

 25. "Flowers". A duet with Zaine Griff of his song, on his 1982 LP
.bf ital;Figures,
.pf
recorded in June, 1982.
This song was a tribute to the dancer/mime/choreographer
Lindsay Kemp, with whom Kate and Zaine had studied together
for a time in 1976.

 26. "No Self-Control" and "Games Without Frontiers". Two tracks from
Peter Gabriel's third solo album, for which Kate recorded backing vocals
in January, 1980.

 27. "The Magician (theme from
.bf ital;The Magician of Lublin)."
.pf
A song from the film
.bf ital;The Magician of Lublin
.pf
starring Alan Arkin, it was recorded by Kate in February, 1979, and
featured the music of Maurice Jarre and lyrics of Paul Webster.
No soundtrack was ever commercially released; consequently,
the song is only known from the nearly unlistenable film
print itself (dialogue obscures most of Kate's vocal).

 28. "Sat In Your Lap" (rhythm track only). This track, isolated from
the complete mix, was heard briefly on a British television
documentary called
.bf ital;Looking Good, Feeling Fit,
.pf
which aired August 6, 1981.

 29. "Sat In Your Lap" (single mix). Different in sound (especially
the rhythm and relative prominence of lead vocal track) from LP
version. This version was actually begun in September, 1980.

 30. "Lord of the Reedy River". The b-side of the "Sat In Your Lap" single.
Original song by Donovan, who, the rumour goes, contributes backing vocals
(unidentifiably).

 31. "Dreamtime". The b-side of "The Dreaming" single. An instrumental
version of "The Dreaming", "Dreamtime" is very similar to the LP track except
for a longer, different ending and the absence of lead vocal tracks.

 32. "Ne T'Enfuis Pas". Originally the b-side of the single release of "There
Goes a Tenner", it was later remixed (the rhythm sound brightened
and the lead vocal moved further up in the mix) for French
and Canadian release as an a-side.

 33. "Un Baiser d'Enfant". The b-side of the remixed "Ne T'Enfuis Pas",
this is a French-language version of the track "The Infant Kiss", from
the album
.bf ital;Never For Ever.
.pf

 34. "Running Up That Hill" (instrumental). Identical to the LP version,
except for the missing lead vocal track. Featured on the
twelve-inch single.

 35. "Running Up That Hill" (re-mix). An extended re-mix of the original
recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.

 36. "Cloudbusting (The Organon Mix)". An extended re-mix of the original
recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.

 37. "Cloudbusting" (the film soundtrack). An extended version of the
original recording, with an insert of new music.

 38. "Hounds of Love (Alternative Hounds)". An extended re-mix of the
original recording, with completely different vocals.

 39. "The Big Sky (Special Single Mix)". A seven-inch version of the
original recording, with a slight remix and a different opening.

 40. "The Big Sky (The Meteorological Mix)". An extended re-mix of the
original recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.

 41. "Under the Ivy". The b-side of the "Running Up That Hill" single.

 42. "Burning Bridge". The first b-side of the "Cloudbusting" single.

 43. "My Lagan Love". The second b-side of the "Cloudbusting" single,
this track is an a capella recording of the traditional Irish folk-song.

 44. "The Handsome Cabin Boy". The b-side of the "Hounds of Love" single,
this track is a Fairlight-backed recording of another traditional Irish
folk-song.

 45. "Not This Time". The b-side of the "The Big Sky" single.

 46. "Experiment IV" (extended re-mix). Featured on the twelve-inch single.

 47. "Experiment IV" (film soundtrack). Includes a remixed insert.

 48. "Breathing" (live), and "Do Bears Sh... in the Woods?", from the
album of the April 4/6, 1986 Comic Relief shows, called
.bf ital;Utterly, Utterly Live.
.pf
Kate accompanies herself on
electric piano for "Breathing", and sings the comic song "Do Bears
Sh... in the Woods?" with British comedian Rowan Atkinson.

 49. "Brazil". A cover of the old popular song, not included in the 1985
Terry Gilliam film
.bf ital;Brazil,
.pf
but promised for inclusion in the soundtrack LP, which,
however, will probably never be released.

 50. "Be Kind to My Mistakes". Theme song for the 1987 Nicholas Roeg film
.bf ital;Castaway.
.pf

 51. "Make It Go Away". Theme song for the 1987 John Hughes film
.bf ital;She's Having a Baby,
.pf
now scheduled for release in early 1988.

 52. "Don't Give Up". A duet with Peter Gabriel of a song from his
album
.bf ital;So.
.pf

 53. "The Seer". A track from Big Country's 1986 album of the same name.
Kate sings backing vocals.

 54. "The King is Dead". A track from Go West's 1987 album
.bf ital;Dancing on the Couch.
.pf
Kate sings backing vocals.

 55. "Let It Be". 7" and 12" single by Ferry Aid for the survivors and families
of the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster. Kate sang three lines of the song, in
a separate studio session unrelated to the rest of the recording.

 56. "Running Up That Hill", "Let It Be" and "We Shall Be Released" (live),
performed for
the soundtrack LP for Amnesty International's
.bf ital;The Secret Policeman's Third Ball.
.pf
"Running Up That Hill" is included on the official soundtrack album, and
"Let It Be" may also be available on a bootleg seven-inch single. In
addition, a film of the concert is scheduled for release in 1987, which
may include all of Kate's performance.

 57. "Wuthering Heights (New Vocal)". Actually an LP track,
track, since it is featured on Kate's compilation LP,
.bf ital;The Whole Story.
.pf

 58. "Under the Ivy" sung live at Abbey Road for the 100th
edition of the Tyne Tees TV programme
.bf ital
The Tube.
.pf

 59. "Rocket Man", a cover version of the Elton John/Bernie Taupin
composition, to be included in a forthcoming twentieth anniversary
album in tribute to the songwriting team.
