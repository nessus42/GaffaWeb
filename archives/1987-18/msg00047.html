IED has a tiny bit more concrete information to give you all as a
guideline for this topic, through the courtesy of the new issue (#28)
of _Homeground_, "The International Kate Bush Fanzine". 
     It says that according to people "close" to Kate (i.e., probably
Del or Paddy, with whom the _HG_ crew are quite chummy now, IED thinks),
there are now seven tracks in a "nearly complete state", and
"many" of these seven are "'up-tempo'".
     So now, folks -- give your imaginations free reign. IED is waiting
to read your ideas: What's _KBVI_ going to be like?
     A couple of other interesting bits of news in this issue of _HG_:
     First, they confirm the existence of several new bootlegs, and
although they try to make it sound like none of them is worth
owning, in fact one of the latest, a two-LP set called _Under
the Ivy Bush_, contains some absolutely exclusive stuff, namely
_demo_ versions of "Babooshka" and a couple of other tracks from
that era! Interesting, eh? Plus it may contain the live "Under the Ivy".too.
     Also, they confirm the existence of a new 7" bootleg single containing
the Policeman's Third Ball "RUTH" backed with "Let It Be" from the
same concerts. Worth having.
     The other tidbit is in the _HG_ "Medialog" section: They
list a recent UK airing of a _50-minute_ interview show with
Kate "at the Palladium" (IED guesses the Amnesty concerts? Can't
remember off hand). So there's some good new video out there.
     There's also an interesting new article by Peter Fitzgerald-Morris
arguing that there is a mini-suite, so to speak -- a kind
of proto-_The Ninth Wave_ -- in _The Dreaming_, which is
comprised of "Night of the Swallow", "All the Love" and "Houdini".
The link is thematic, not musical. (In fact Peter almost never
seems to consider the _music_ in his otherwise frequently
fascinating theoretical analyses.) This article is based
on a very intriguing (though in IED's opinion far-fetched) thesis,
to the effect that _TD_ is actually extremely auto-biographical,
and is in fact an album about a traumatic break-up of a romantic
relationship, which is "mended" in "Houdini". Peter makes the clear
implication that Kate had a big break-up with Del in '80,
and then apparently they made up later. And that consequently
Kate used this experience as the foundation for the songs on _TD_.
He says this interpretation is clear if you "listen with an
open heart"! But he may also have some inside information which
he chooses to keep from us. IED is dubious, frankly. What do you folks
think?
     Sorry for the scarcity of verbiage from this quarter, but IED
has been in lengthy discussions re Kateian matters with private e-mail
parties, and anyway he hasn't seen much sign of sincere Kateian
fervour in Love-Hounds in the past couple of months. You all
seem much more interested in "XTC" and their ilk these days.
     In case IED is wrong about this, and there are some of you
out there who still know which way is up, here's a proposal for you:
A friend of IED's has a PAL copy of the new "Secret Policeman's Third
Ball" video-cassette, and is looking for people who'd be willing
to go in on the cost of a digital transfer to NTSC. If enough
of you are interested, it could come down to something like $20 per
person. Hope to hear from you soon. If interested, please contact
IED personally at &lt;IED0DXM@UCLAMVS.BITNET&gt;. Thanks. That is all.
