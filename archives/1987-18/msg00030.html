     First, a note to Fu-Sheng. IED has a reply message for you, but
can't seem to get it through to you via the address you gave him.
He'll keep trying, however. Meanwhile, IED hopes you start receiving
Love-Hounds again soon.
     Thanks to Neil for all the info re "She's Having a Baby". It's
interesting to hear about the Captn. Beefheart Tribute LP. IED would
wager that Kate would contribute if she knew about it!  Esp. since
she's already (supposedly) contributing to a tribute LP for Elton
John, who doesn't need the moral support half as much as C.B.
     Also thanks for the info re Syphilis/Syphilus. What you say
indicates that even if Kate was referring to the shepherd, she must
still have had the disease in mind, eh? So did Delius have syphilis or
not? Anyone?
     About the "X4" video's similarity to "Raiders", nobody has
actually written about it in L-Hs as far as IED knows, but MarK T.
Ganzer has pointed out the connection very explicitly to IED in
private a couple of times. IED agrees that "Raiders" is a clear
influence for the basic special effect, the movements and the
expression on Del's face. As for the specific appearance of Kate's
angel/monster character, however, IED thinks Kate is making a
reference to Kim Greist's dream-angel alter ego in "Brazil". She's got
exactly the same kind of gold wig, make-up and gauzy veil, and she
hovers in the same way, with the breeze flowing around her.

&gt; Frankly, I'm a bit upset: I just heard that Pat Benatar did a version of
&gt; "Wuthering Heights". Sigh. Is nothing sacred?

&gt; -- Pete Berger

     Nope. And get this. A lot of people first learned the song
through Benatar's cover (mostly Americans) -- and they PREFER it to
Kate's!  Aaahhggh! (Shout of sheer terror.)

&gt;The music for "The Bride Wore Black" was by Bernard Herrmann.

     This was part of Truffaut's plan to make a film that followed
Hitchcock's cinematic style as closely as possible. No surprise that
of all the Truffaut movies, Kate singles out his most explicit tribute
to Hitchcock.
