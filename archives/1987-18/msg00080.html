&gt; Memory says that Kate describes AtL as an exposition constructed
&gt; around the answering-machine snippet; is Del's the last voice?  To
&gt; wit, where are the subtle, personalized references one would expect?

I had heard somewhere (I believe it was from someone who should know)
that "All the Love" was written after the death of someone who worked
for her (a stage hand from a tour perhaps?). With this is mind the
song points out the casual way in which people say good-bye, certain
they'll see each other again, when in fact sometimes they don't.

	[ "Blow Away" was the song which Kate wrote in response to the
	  death of a stage worker.  Whether or not someone died to
	  help inspire "All the Love", I know not, but it seems to me
	  and Kate says that thge song is about the sad fact that
	  people often don't tell each other how they feel about each
	  other.  -- |&gt;oug ]

What do my fellow LoveHounds think of this interpretation? And before you
flame me and accuse me of Kate-blasphemy, please remember that I'm just 
passing on what I've heard, I didn't think of this myself.

If I can bring up a different point. Has anyone (in the US) had any luck
getting a copy of "Kate Bush Complete"? I've taken the info supplied
by some nice soul in Love-Hounds to various bookstores who say they'll
talk to their managers and get back to me. Nothing yet. I even found a
Kate-phile who works in a bookstore, and she was unable to get it. Any
clues on how to get it would be most appreciated. I got a better idea.
How about if everyone in the States who wants one sends me, say $150. I'll
buy a round-trip ticket to England and get copies at the bookstore at 
Heathrow. Honest. No, really.

Kate loves you
(but not nearly as much as she loves me)
