About the problems with Love-Hounds distribution and finding a new moderator:
     Afraid IED doesn't qualify for the job (too computer-ignorant and
inadequately wired), but if he can help anyone out in some subsidiary
capacity, please let him know. Infinite thanks to Doug for all his
hard work over the past (gulp) two years, and let's hope this is
_not_ the end of the Alan/Love-Hounds era. Maybe the following will
inspire the Love-Hounds to rekindle their philocanine passions:

KT NEWS:
~~~~
IED just received a letter from none other than Robyn Carstairs
Somerville, who now signs off as T.R. Somerville. In it she
announces the beginning of a _new_ Kate Bush fanzine, to
be based in her present home in Delta, British Columbia. It
will be called _Still Breathing_, and will be _exclusively_
about Kate Bush -- no born-again Christian shit or anything like it.

_Still Breathing_ will come out in volumes (of three issues each)
rather than in yearlong subscriptions, presumably because Robyn
realistically anticipates occasional delays in publication. Three
issues cost $9.00 (Americans are asked to send postal money orders).
Subscriptions available from:

_Still Breathing_
11588 72nd Avenue
Delta, British Columbia V4E-1Z1
Canada

In further KT 'zine doings, IED was faced with a minor dilemma
the other day when he discovered (through ridiculously convoluted
means) that Alan Balliot, the eKsploiTation king, would be
publishing IED's list of KT music in the next issue of his
own Kate fanzine, which may or may not be called _After the Party_.
Furthermore, he had had no intention of even letting IED know
of this intention! Since the only edition that A.B. had of this
list was now hopelessly outdated and contained not only a large
number of omissions but also two or three errors of fact, IED
was naturally somewhat annoyed. In the end, Balliot was so
determined to use the list -- with or without the author's consent --
that IED had to settle for the inclusion of an over-the-phone-dictated
disclaimer. From here on in, let's hope Balliot will show a little
more respect for the fans he makes so much money from.
And by the way, all the best to A.B.'s wife Maura, who at last hearing
was three weeks overdue.

There are TOO MANY Kate Bush fanzines, folks! It's getting to be
ridiculous. So many little splinter groups, some of which compete
for copy and at least two of which are run by highly capitalistic
entrepeneurs of bootleg merchandise, tend to keep the worldwide
KommuniTy broken up and isolated into little splinter groups, instead
of banding the communal Gardeners together, so to speak. With this
in mind, IED proposes an early wish for the new year: May all the
fans -- Lisa of the KBC included! -- try to take a little more
initiative in enlarging the _union_ of fans in 1988.
