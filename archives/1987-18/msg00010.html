     |&gt;oug, this is sad news, but IED understands and sympathizes.
(Really, he does!) He now realizes that you're doing all you can, so
please forgive the earlier flames.
     About "Gaffa": IED is happy to admit that he was apparently
completely wrong about this word. Since according to our Swedish (Wow!
We've got a Swedish Love-Hound!) contributor Gaffa is a familiar
nickname for gaffer's tape, it looks as though the meaning of that
song is at least a little bit clearer. There still remain one or two
oblique references in that track, however -- at least oblique to IED,
now properly (but only temporarily) humbled by his comeuppance at the
hands of wiser L-Hs.

&gt;      The "field" video was the second video she did for this song
&gt; (the first was for her initial Top of the Pops appearance, in which
&gt; she said she felt like she was slowly dying), but it was dropped for
&gt; promotional use in favor of the Keith McMillan-directed version.

     This is probably correct. Unfortunately, the exact date of the
"field" video is still unknown. Here's the whole story about "W.
Heights" on video. First, "field" is our mutual misnomer, since the
landscape in that video was meant to look like -- and may actually
have been -- a Yorkshire moor, which is slightly different and much
more atmospheric-sounding than a mere field. It was probably the third
of the video performances to be shot and screened. The "Top of the
Pops" "video" (which IED has still never seen) was actually just a
lip-synch performance, not a real video, and it was the second of
those. She had performed the song before cameras for the first time on
February 7, 1978, on the German TV show "Scene 78", more commonly
called "Bio's Bahnhof", in honour of its host, a bald, middle-aged guy
called Dr. Alfred Biolek. This is the version for which a curtain
designed to look like Germans' idea of the Yorkshire moors was set up
behind Kate: its most prominent feature was a large red volcano.
     Anyway, the _TotP_ performance was a few days later, on February
16th.  Sometime during this period (exact date not known, and quite
possibly before the "TotP" lip-synch) the Yorkshire moors video was
shot, not by Keef MacMillan, but by a company called Rockflix. This
version was, as you say, MarK, rejected for UK promotional use, but
was used in Continental Europe.
     Then, on March 2, 1978, Kate shot the "official" indoor video for
the song under Keef's direction, wearing a white gown and dancing
against a black background. This, the fourth "Wuthering Heights" on
film, is the one included in _Single File_ and _The Whole Story_ video
compilations.
     Next, she performed the song in Amsterdam's Eftelung Gardens as
part of a "seven"-song (though IED only counts six) film of songs from
the album. This was in April of '78.
     Directly after Amsterdam Kate performed on Holland's _Voor de
Vuist Weg_ TV show (IED doesn't know which songs, but possibly "W.
Heights"). Then from there she went back to Germany to appear again on
_Scene 78_, (this time without Biolek hosting), where she performed
"Wuthering Heights" once again, and this time with noticeably more
confidence. (The Boomtown Rats were also on that show.)
     Then there's the May 13, '79 Hammersmith Odeon version, and the
version included in the German/Dutch special, Kate Bush in Concert,
which used footage from the April 28 Hamburg and May 8 Mannheim
concerts, which brings the total known video versions of "Wuthering
Heights" to at least eight, possibly nine.
     IED hastens to add that most of the above clarifying info comes
directly from the new Gospel According to Kate (and Peter
Fitzgerald-Morris), _Kate Bush Complete_.

&gt; When you do it could you include all the usual information for us to
&gt; order the book? I checked with my local book store and was unable to
&gt; find it in Books In Print or Forthcomming BiP. If you could please
&gt; include the ISBN number, the publishers address, and the complete
&gt; title as it appears on the title page. That should be sufficient to
&gt; order. By the way, I couldn't find EMI as a publisher, do you know
&gt; what EMI/IMP Books full name might be?  Thanks!

&gt; Kate Bush is GOD! (R)

&gt; -- Victor O'Rear {hplabs!hp-sdd, akgua, sdcsvax,nosc.mil}!crash!victoro

Yes, she is! Here's all the stuff you wanted to know about the book,
Victor:

_Kate Bush Complete_, edited by Cecil Bolton, with special thanks to
Peter Fitzgerald-Morris (IED should think so! He wrote every word in
the book, as proved by twenty-seven issues of his fanzine
_Homeground_, from which much of the chronology was compiled).

Published by EMI Music Publishing Ltd (C) 1987
138 Charing Cross Road
London WC2H 0LD

EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS:
International Music Publications
Woodford Green
Essex IG8 8HN
England

Price: 6 Pounds, 95 Pence.

ISBN Number: 0 86175 413 1

     But Victor, before you go ordering it through the mail, check
around at your import stores. It's going to start turning up in U.S
stores pretty soon. Also, it's now available through The Music
Machine, a U.S. mail-order firm located (if memory serves correctly)
in the W., D.C. area. They're charging $18.00, IED believes.  Also,
Intergalactic Garage (those bank-robbers!) will certainly have it by
now, too. Of course, you might save some money through direct mail
with EMI/IMP. Music Machine's ad is in the new _Goldmine_.

&gt; PPS I'm overjoyed to hear about that new songbook. Sixty songs? Wow!
&gt; I CAN'T WAIT!!!  Glad this forum exists to clue me in on such
&gt; things!  Blessed Be.  -- Phil (prs@oliveb)

     Yes, indeed. Actually, the book has the lyrics and music to
sixty-SIX of Kate's sixty-eight songs to date. ("Maybe" and "Be Kind
to My Mistakes" are the only omissions.)

&gt; [...] who has all of the Flying Lizards' albums, as well as Suburban
&gt; Lawns' only album and only EP (did they all die after "Baby"?).

&gt;    -- Billy Green

     Well, Billy, IED only has F.L.'s first LP, but he certainly has
complete S. Lawns. A great admirer of Sue Tissue's work, IED attended
more than ten of their concerts in the early Eighties. The rest of the
band were of more ordinary (though respectable) talents, but Tissue
was a really fascinating performer. She usually went pretty much
unnoticed in the background playing keyboards until the third or
fourth song of the set, letting the men in the group take the
limelight with their proto-Oingo-Boingo-style vocals (ho-hum). Then
she would walk to the front mike, and newcomers in the audience would
get extremely disoriented FAST. Jeez, she was great.
     Anyway, she actually has done a solo album of her own since the
break-up of the band following _Baby_. Don't get your hopes up,
though. It was a highly Eno-influenced ambient album of piano loop
music, called _Musique de Salon_, or _Salon Music_ (IED forgets
which). It's excellent, but rather unremarkable. She also contributed
vocals on a University of Berkeley Music Department tape a while back,
but unfortunately I've never been able to identify or track that one
down.

Oh, my janitor.
Oh, my genitals.

-- Andrew Marvick
   (Yes, that's IED, acknowledging the existence of music
other than Kate's, folks!!)
