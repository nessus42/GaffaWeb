I don't think we're facing a return of the "'Reaching Out':
Genius or Garbage?" debate of last fall.  When I made a couple of
postings on the subject back then, I didn't think "Reaching Out"
was particularly great; since then, I've become much more
sympathetic to the song.  That's the interesting thing about
Kate's music--I tend to learn to like it better the more I listen
to it.  I used to be sort of unexcited about "Night of the
Swallow", too, but now I'm picking up more interesting things in
it.  Not that everyone will learn to like every Kate Bush song,
but I seem to be able to, which is I suppose what makes me a
Love-Hound.

I spend a lot of time listening to "Suspended in Gaffa" and then
listening to it again.  I was interested to see the official
lyrics, which had a few bits I hadn't understood but which fit;
however, I still can't agree with the offical version of the
first whispered phrase.  I hear:

"I caught a glimpse of a god
 He's shining the light" (instead of "shiny and bright")

Now hopefully this won't start a flame war in itself, but unlike
the cases where the official lyrics fit what I was hearing better
than what I had originally thought I heard, I can't make the
official version fit there.

I finally got a chance to hear "Be Kind to My Mistakes", "I'm
Still Waiting", and "Ken" enough times to form an opinion on
them.  I really really like "I'm Still Waiting", which has a
really strong emotional appeal for me, although not for exactly
meshing with my life.  "Ken" was obviously something of a lark.
I transcribed the lyrics for a friend, and could post them here
if anyone is interested; I actually went so far as to try to
transcribe the various non-verbal parts too ("Waaaaaaaaa-ohh!
Hup!" is the first line in the transcription).
