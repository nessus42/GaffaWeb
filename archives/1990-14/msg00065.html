<PRE>
Vickie here. I'm so depressed. Last night was our Fund Drive and I came
out of it all a total mess. I'm so depressed. Oh please, please, please,
if you listen to Community or NPR or any kind of station that relies on
listener-support and there are specific shows that you like, please subscribe
or give whatever you can without making the programmer beg and plead for
it. It's the most horrible thing in the world. First knowing that most of
the people are turning you off once they hear the first pledge pitch.
Second having to ask those people left to give money. It's HORRIBLE! I'm
not cut out for it at all. Last time I did great (came in 3rd!) but this
time it was the most dismal experience of my radio "career" (no career here,
I don't get paid). I'm so depressed and I have to do it again next week.
Woe is me. Anyway here's my playlist even though I was somewhat brain-damaged
during the show.


                          Suspended In Gaffa 112
                            (Horrorshow Pt.1)
                           Playlist for 5-5-90


    * Artist *                           * Song *
             * Album *

1.  Suzanne Vega                         The Queen And The Soldier
             Suzanne Vega
(I started with a Suzanne Vega set so I could play 4 songs in a row without
having to say anything. Pledge Drive? What Pledge Drive? btw, woj--eez 4 U)

2.  Suzanne Vega                          In The Eye
             Solitude Standing
(Dark, like my mood. Chilling lyrics. Who said that Suzanne only writes
happy-go-lucky folk songs? Whoever it was--they should listen more to the
lyrics. A song about looking your murderer in the eye so your image will
be forever burned into his memory isn't something you'd sing at sing-a-longs)

3.  Suzanne Vega                           Fifty-Fifty
             Days Of Open Hand
(Perfect for the folks at alt.suicide.holiday. About.....yes.....suicide!)

4. Suzanne Vega                            Rusted Pipe
             Days Of Open Hand
(I only got this on Friday so I haven't had a chance to listen to it closely.
These two songs stood out for me. Rusted Pipe is the one that Shawn Colvin
sings backup on. I think anyone who likes Suzanne anyway will like this LP)

5.  Two Nice Girls                          Sweet Jane (With Affection)
             Two Nice Girls
(A combination of Lou Reed's song and Joan Armatrading's Love and Affection.
It works! This album is uneven but any band that thanks (in the credits)
people like Nina Simone, The Shaggs, Throwing Muses, Dory Previn, Young
Marble Giants, The Slits and The New Cristy Minstrels (among other giants)
plus do a straight-faced bent cover of Jane Siberry's "Follow Me" is a band
that I'll support, you bet! They have a new album that I don't have yet)

6.  3 Mustaphas 3                            Awara Hoon
             Heart Of Uncle
(The woman Lavra sings on a few songs. This is one of them. I REALLY like
this group but how can they use so many traditional instruments yet still
sound as if they're using cheezy synths most of the time?)

7.  17 Pygmies                               Icarus
              Captured In Ice
(1985 incarnation of the band. I'd love to read a bio about them. I know
nothing. Interesting, alternative. I like them but I can't describe them)

8.  10,000 Maniacs                            Gun Shy (acoustic version)
              You Happy Puppet CD
(Thought I could get into a "numbers" mood but it didn't work. This is a
truly excellent version of the song. Just Natalie on vocals and Laura
McWilliam on violin)

9.  Collection: D'Arnell~~Andrea               Aux Glycines Defuntes
              un Automne A Loroy
(Anyone speak French? I don't, I just try my best with pronunciations.
Drives my French major listener nuts! This is real nice, though I don't
like every single song. I said last week that they're France's version
of Beautiful Pea Green Boat, which doesn't help much if you've never heard
BPGB. Sorry! Beautiful/Ethereal/Violin/Cello/Female vocals/French lyrics/
Bits of hard-harsh guitar/ something like that. I don't know if they'll be
important, influential or if this album will hold up, but I like it for now)

10. The Sundays                                Can't Be Sure
             Reading Writing &amp; Arithmetic
(This was a request but I like it, so fine. 

11. Mary Margaret O'Hara                        Not Be Alright
             Miss America
(Another request. No problem!)

12. Throwing Muses                              Mexican Women
             House Tornado
(I heard that the band wasn't happy with this album. I don't understand
why. I love it! I'm going to devote a whole show to them when the new
album comes out)

13. Najma                                       Jo Tere Ishq Mein
             Ghazals by Najma
(Another request. A fellow called and said he was was flipping the dials
last week and heard me playing Najma. He'd NEVER heard anything like it 
before in his life and immediately fell in love. I played 2 Najma songs
for him tonight and he didn't even pledge :-( so go figure)

14. Tish Hinojosa                                West Side Of Town
             Homeland
(I just bought this CD and I like it a lot. It's sort of Mexican-influenced
country. Very good. Vocally she has to have been influenced by Nanci Griffith
but, if true, it's definitely a homage, not a rip-off. Interesting lyrics)

15. Elizabeth Cotten                          Vastopol
             North Carolina Folk Songs
(She was born in NC in 1895. Started playing guitar and banjo at 8. Gave it
up at age 15 to get married and worked as a housekeeper for most of her
life. In the mid 1940s she started working for the Seeger family. A few years
later she started playing guitar again and began to remember the songs of her
child/girlhood. Died in 1987) 


16. Tetes Noires                               Pour More Water On Her, George
             Clay Foot Gods
(VERY uneven album. I can't recommend it. The songs I like though, I like
very much. This seems to be (can't make out all the lyrics) a fun, upbeat,
40's swing-style anti-Wet T-Shirt Contest song)

17. Jane Siberry                                Dancing Class
             No Borders Here
(Wonderful song. Wonderful album. Wonderful artist)

18. Kate Bush                                   Under The Ivy
             Running Up That Hill 12"
(Wonderful song. Wonderful artist. Yes IED, the Universe DOES revolve
around this song :-) 

19. Najma                                        Har Ek Ranj Mein
             Ghazals By Najma
(Again. He called back to thank me but still didn't pledge :-( so why am
I going to play Marta Sebestyen for him next week? sigh...aim to please)

20. Julee Cruise                                  Into The Night
             Floating Into The Night
(Dedicated to all the Twin Peaks fanatics. Chris &amp; I are among 'em!)

21. Dulce                                         Tsiketa Kuni Barassara
              Women Of Africa
(The only song on this album that I really, really like though a few others
are fairly OK. This is a compilation album and it looks as if they all have
cheezy synths in common. Maybe they just use the same one and keep passing
it back and forth. Take away the synths and most of the songs would be great.
Btw, I have nothing against synths if they're used well and subtly. Not
the case on this album. Bummer is I paid $25.00 for it (CD) in Chicago!)

22. Aster Aweke                                    Sebubu
              Aster
(She uses synths on a few songs but has enough sense to lose them on the
very best ones. This cost $25.00 too but is worth it. She lives in America,
has been for the past 8 years, yet the CD is an import. Only two times in
my life have I ever been furious at Peter Gabriel. When I heard he left
Genesis (before I heard the circumstances, after which I felt better) and
when I found out that he had the chance to pick up Aster for his Real World
label and PASSED!! Sends my head spinning just thinking about it. He doesn't
have ANY (not one! nada! zero!) female artists of Real World. Grrrrrrrr!!!!!)
(OK, OK, *THAT I KNOW OF*. Chris made me put that in just in case it's our
local record store's problem and not Real World's)

                ---------------------------------------

Great music. Lousy, horrible forget-it-ever-happened night at the studio.
IT'S SOME SORT OF COSMIC OXYMORON, I do believe.

sigh....
