&gt;Really-From: gb10@gte.com (Gregory Bossert)


&gt;Whoops, me again.  I knew I was going to ask something...

&gt;Please forgive me if I'm dregging up old topics, but in the few
&gt;months I've been following the adventures of the Love-Hounds, I've
&gt;seen very little mention of KT's studio, or indeed the whole technical/
&gt;production end of her genius.  IM-not-always-so-HO, Ms. Bush is one of
&gt;the best producers around; along with Del, Paul Hardiman, Kevin Killen, 
&gt;Hayden Bendall, Brian Tench, et al. she has created not just astounding
&gt;music but almost perfect recordings of that music.  This is all the more
&gt;worth noting in the viciously sexist music business, where women are allowed
&gt;to sing, maybe write songs, but good lord keep 'em away from all that
&gt;technical stuff.  SO, that said, a couple of questions:

&gt;	Are there any recent articles on KT's studio, etc.  I just dug
&gt;out the Keyboard interview, and that's way back in '85!
In last KBC - magazine there was a very good article about microphones and woofers they use, you really should read it! It is written by Del Palmer.

Paddy has a computer, I dont know more about it and its capacity.

&gt;	Anyone know if she's got a personal computer?  I've got a strong
&gt;personal interest in this;  I was one of the principal designers of one
&gt;of the leading MID sequencer programs for the Mac (Mark of the Unicorn's
&gt;Performer -- actually, I just designed the version 3 revision).  I know
&gt;Macintoshes are still relatively rare in the UK.  On the flip side, Jane
&gt;Siberry, Laurie Anderson, Wendy Carlos, Clannad + Enya, er -- let's see, 
&gt;oh, Martha and the Muffins (?!), etc use Performer, and I had this idea
&gt;that maybe Kate would, you know, buy it and need some help from an expert
&gt;and... Hem, well.  I really ask because Fairlight, the Australian 
&gt;manufacturers of Kate's main ax, went out of business and support for the
&gt;Fairlight machines has become flaky.  Admittedly, Fairlight has revived
&gt;in the last few months, but they are moving out of the keyboard/sequencing
&gt;market into the trendy post-production/audio-for-video market.

&gt;Does anyone have Performer/MIDI File sequences of any of KT's songs?
&gt;I've got a pretty atrocious "Wuthering Heights" (you shudda heard the
&gt;tape we made!).  I'd be happy to trade sequences (I've got some Depeche
&gt;Mode songs I'm pretty happy with...)

&gt;Two Disclaimers:  I no longer work at Mark of the Unicorn, so don't
&gt;blame me if you got problems with them...

&gt;Sorry for the misspellings, it's late. ("I did not eat, I did not sleep")

&gt;Footah!
