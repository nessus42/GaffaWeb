Hullo, 

A while back I wrote:

&gt; Kate Bush (TSW was a let down, well in particular Reaching Out ack-gasp!,
&gt; The Fog is kind of ho-hum, Deeper Understanding is also ho-hum.  I 
&gt; guess I'm still expecting another Dreaming or 9th Wave.), 
 
Unfortuneately some people took major offence at it.  It was in no way 
written to start a flame-war-discussion, I was just giving my view on 
TSW. I should've said some good stuff about it too but at the time I was
feeling rather negative (as I am inclinded to anyway).  Well there are 
in fact things I think are phenomenal Walk Straight down thw middle, and
Rockets tail in particular.  Well any way it seems that i've permenantly 
severed some relationships with this post.  This totally s*cks because it
wasn't meant as the slam it was percieved as.  But people can make there
own choices about how they react to such and there is nothing I can really
do about it.  The direct apologies that I've sent have yet to be answered,
I'm beinning to wonder if they ever will be.  It's been a great week!!
(much sarcasm implied)

Anyway I also plead with you no flames please, I've yet to see any so I
don't think there will be any but just in case.
