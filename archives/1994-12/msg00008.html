In article &lt;m0pvB4D-000AF8C@zoodle.robin.de&gt;, uli@zoodle.RoBIN.de (Ulrich Grepel) writes:
&gt;Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
&gt;Last-modified: 1994/04/24
&gt;Version: 1.0.l minus 1.0.j
&gt;
&gt;This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
&gt;month's FAQ.
&gt;
&gt;If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
&gt;is all you will get without further action. You can get a full copy of the
&gt;FAQ by requesting it from me (uli@zoodle.robin.de). If you subscribe to
&gt;the list Bill Wisner will also provide you with the full FAQ.
&gt;
&gt;All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
&gt;additional comments in []s.
&gt;
&gt;-------------------8&lt;-------------------
&gt;[head of body:]
&gt;
&gt;Newer versions (in decreasing order) can be obtaine from me
&gt;(uli@zoodle.robin.de), from Bill Wisner (love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net),
&gt;from various newsgroups (rec.music.gaffa, rec.music.info, rec.answers,
&gt;news.answers) or any ftp site archiving any of these groups.
&gt;
&gt;[my answer to a recent flamewar on the FAQ maintainer's mailing list:]
&gt;
&gt;This FAQ may be redistributed in its entirety in any form on any medium,
&gt;even be sold.
&gt;
&gt;[added line about connectivity of rec.music.gaffa]
&gt;
&gt;1.2. What is Love-Hounds?
&gt;
&gt;     Delphi and America Online also provide
&gt;     direct access to the Usenet newsgroups, so rec.music.gaffa should be
&gt;     availlable directly.
&gt;
&gt;[time flies, a tour started, and new singles appear...]
&gt;
&gt;2.2. Who is Tori Amos?
&gt;
&gt;     The purpose of the list is to discuss and disseminate information about
&gt;     Tori Amos and her music, and anything else that seems relevant. Due
&gt;     to the heavy load of discussion and members after the release of Tori's
&gt;     new album Under The Pink Anthony was forced to make the list digest-only,
&gt;     that is there is no bounce mail. A massive world tour is running right
&gt;     now, and the next set of singles (Past The Mission in the UK) will be
&gt;     released any day now. Watch out for limited editions, since they ARE
&gt;     limited and the first UtP one, Cornflake Girl, was quite fast sold out
&gt;     completely.
&gt;
&gt;[The Sarah McLachlan mailing list has some technical problems with
&gt;subscriptions. I'd like to know if this recipe is useful and working...]
&gt;
&gt;2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest
&gt;
&gt;     Sarah McLachlan - fumbling-towards-ecstasy
&gt;
&gt;        subscribe: listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
&gt;                   no subject, just the text
&gt;
&gt;                       SUB fumbling-towards-ecstasy Your Real Name
&gt;
&gt;                   the digested version is somehow broken. It might work
&gt;                   to first unsubscribe to it by sending mail to the listserver
&gt;                   containing
&gt;
&gt;                       SIGNOFF fte-digest
&gt;
&gt;        post:      fumbling-towards-ecstasy@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
&gt;                   or just fte@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
&gt;
&gt;[It's already getting time again!]
&gt;
&gt;3.3. What is Katemas?
&gt;
&gt;     Any Katemas party announced for '94?
&gt;
&gt;[Rumours deleted, since noone mentioned them in the past 3+ months:]
&gt;
&gt;4.1. Kate Bush - her carreer and Kate as a human being
&gt;
&gt;     She's born on July 30, 1958. She's not married, but you should bury all
&gt;     hopes since her bassist and engineer, Del Palmer, is her one and only
&gt;     for too many years now. Kate smokes, but is very reluctant to show this
&gt;     bad habit in public. Kate, if you ever read this: count my vote as one
&gt;     who wants you to stop! Kate is a vegetarian, though she now eats fish.
&gt;     She's 5'3" (1.60m) and doesn't have a middle name. She has two brothers,
&gt;     John Carder Bush (Jay), born 1944 - he takes many of the photos of Kate
&gt;     that appear on her albums - and Paddy Bush, born 1952, who plays many of
&gt;     the exotic instruments found on Kate's albums. Yes, she is indeed a fox.
&gt;
&gt;[up to date release information, and rewordings due to being out-of-context:]
&gt;
&gt;4.2. Basic Discography/Videography
&gt;
&gt;     The following is directly from the latest KBC letter:
&gt;[... me again:]
&gt;     As 5th of April is already history the singles have already appeared
&gt;     on the market. Anyone seen the Australian or Canadian ones?
&gt;
&gt;     A good short description of the contents of Kate's new ~50 minute film
&gt;     The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve are the lyrics to the title song of The
&gt;     Red Shoes.
&gt;
&gt;[I forgot Organic Acid:]
&gt;
&gt;     Albums and other major collections:
&gt;
&gt;     The Cathy Demos (23 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan)
&gt;[...]
&gt;        Goodnight Baby, So Soft, I Don't See Why I Shouldn't, Organic Acid
&gt;
&gt;[I forgot Do Bears... from the officially-available-but-not-in-TWW-box list:]
&gt;
&gt;     This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW, 1990).
&gt;[...]
&gt;        Breathing and Do Bears... (live, from "The Utterly Utterly Live Comic 
&gt;
&gt;        Relief)"
&gt;
&gt;[about the Canadian version: is it still in the shops? (changed 'currently'
&gt;into 'lately' and want to know whether this is correct)]
&gt;
&gt;        The French version is a re-shrink-wrapped UK version. The Canadian
&gt;        version, lately easily available and relatively cheap, does contain
&gt;        the Canadian CDs which do have thinner booklets for some of the regular
&gt;        albums that do not always contain the lyrics. The Japanese version has:
&gt;
&gt;[up-to-date version of this list, remember that 'remaining' excludes stuff
&gt;mentioned before, especially anything mentioned as missing in the TWW boxed
&gt;set. I corrected some errors here, and added some stuff. Anything else?]

&gt;     Remaining officially published non-album and non-TWW items are:
&gt;
&gt;     - The Magician Of Lublin

&gt;     Kate features with the song The Man I Love.
&gt;
&gt;[SAE 3 is already out, SAE 4 is now the right one:]
&gt;
&gt;4.4. Fanzines
&gt;
&gt;     Kate Bush Club (KBC):
&gt;
&gt;        Right now any SA[S]E should be marked "SAE 4",
&gt;        except if you already have sent an "SAE 4" to the KBC.
&gt;
&gt;[new chapter:]
&gt;
&gt;4.7. Experiment IV, the World Wide Web (WWW) Kate Bush home page

&gt;
&gt;     Thanks for Richard Frost &lt;rfrost@jrc.flinders.edu.au&gt; for setting this up.
&gt;
&gt;[the X-Windows picture viewer is called xv and not XView, that's something
&gt;different:]
&gt;
&gt;6.2. Other files
