Sorry for the bandwidth, I'll keep this brief, but *lots* of people
could have attested I wrote the original FAQ, and that Ron offered to
take it over later.  Chris *used* to know this very well (I'm looking
for a quote where he acknowledges it).  

I've now gotten a copy of Chris's response to my "so much hate"
message-- there's so many falsifications that I will be *briefly*
addressing several others, here, shortly.

To check these references in the archives from a well-connected Unix
site, type:

ftp ftp.uu.net
cd usenet/rec.music.gaffa/archives/1991 [or 1992, etc.]
binary

and then "get Mail40.Z" (or whichever number).  When the file is received
you use "uncompress Mail40.Z" to uncompress it.

Here's the first posting of the FAQ, from Mail40.Z:
===
Date:   Wed, 30 Oct 1991 11:15:10 -0800
To:     love-hounds@eddie.mit.edu
From:   barger@ils.nwu.edu
Subject: ***MONTHLY POST FOR NEWCOMERS (new, controversial!)***
 
Rec.music.gaffa is a 5-year-old newsgroup dedicated to the sublime,
peerless artistic genius of Kate Bush.  "Gaffa" comes from her song
===etc.

Surprisingly, despite my fears (reflected in the title), there were
almost no objections to this first version.

Here's Ron's first reposting, from 1992 in Mail03.Z:
===
Subject: Monthly post
From:   rhill@netlink.cts.com (Ron Hill)
Date:   Mon, 13 Jan 1992 22:23:26 -0800
Organization: NetLink Online Communications, San Diego CA
 
Several people have asked questions lately, so I'd thought I'd repost the
monthly post, as I haven't seen it.  If you are new, READ ON!
 
[skipping down to where Ron later added the 'fox' line:]

FAQs: No, she's not married, but she has a longstanding Significant Other:
Del Palmer, her bassist.  Yes, she smokes, and we all hope she'll stop.
Yes, she's a vegetarian.  5'3". Albums:
[etc.]
===

Chris, will you acknowledge this, for once?  Will you apologize???
