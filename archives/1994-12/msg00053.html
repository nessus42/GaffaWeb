&gt;&gt; A load of crap
&gt;&gt;Once upon a time... there was a weirdo named Jorn.  Jorn was an oddball.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That's funny, I thought this was a Kate Bush discussion group?!

You may think it's funny, but there are people here who take this 
seriously.
Jorn is desperatly trying to explain why that flamewar ever took place, or
at least trying to tell us HIS point of wiew. Haven't KaTe in several
of her songs expressed her whishes that people should be more open-
minded? Why can't you let Jorn send a single posting without being
sarcastic? I think it's childish, but then: That's me...
I admire Jorn's attempt to make you understand his point of wiew.
To try to open his heart to you fellas (a bunch of people who keep
judging a person from his doings in the past, instead of watching
for changes in his character) must really be hurting.
No one can accuse Jorn of being perfect. But the very same thing applies to 
Chris, Steve0, Vickie, and even ME!    (just to mention a few.. ;)
For a long time I thought myself to be perfect, but then I realized that
a perfect man still needs friends.
I find Jorn's and Chris' personal quarrel amusing. But when they do 
post other subjects I do respect them both. But that doesn't mean that 
I always agree with them.
