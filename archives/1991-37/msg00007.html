&gt;&gt; I think the point is well made that people make KT into a divine being.
&gt;&gt; IF you don't thnk that is the case, then say the reasons why, or
&gt;&gt; if you believe her to be a divine being, then say why.
&gt;
&gt;NO ONE here *truly* believes Kate is a "divine being" so how could anyone
&gt;tell you why they think so? All this "KTISGOD" and "She Really IS" stuff
&gt;is a *JOKE*, of course.

Of course. I was just using a little hyperbole in a way. I don't expect
anyone here to think she is somethine other than human. What I was refering
to is the worshipful attitude that is a common emotion people have with
rock stars that they admire a great deal. They become their idol.
I am not saying that's bad or good, and I was certainly not trying
to say that you are or are not one who believes that KT can do no
wrong (sorry if it seemed I implied that).

&gt;
&gt;I've been a fan for over 10 years and I _like_ The Sensual World. Believe
&gt;me, there are plenty of things that Kate's done that I don't like, yet,
&gt;because I like TSW, I could be accused of worshiping an idol, a god, instead
&gt;of a human being. I like most of the videos that have been trashed in these
&gt;pages recently. I haven't said anything (busy elsewhere, don't you know)
&gt;but if I spoke up to defend them, or say why I liked them, I might be labled
&gt;by some as a "Kate can do no wrongoid" which is not true.

I like TSW as well, though, of course, you have read my opinions about
some of her videos. Trash me for trashing her videos, by all means.
A difference of opinions often times makes for interesting discussions.
(though often dreary arguments) :)


&gt;Tell me, why do *you* think this:
&gt;
&gt; "...people make KT into a divine being"?
&gt;
&gt;What makes you say that? No flame war wanted, I want to get back to a
&gt;reasonable discussion. I'm just curious.
&gt;
Well, if I haven't explained myself, just to reiterate, I think that it is
a common practice in general among many people to idolize their
favorite rock star, artist, actor, author, dead person, etc. KT fans
are no exception. I won't say who I think do this, since I don't know,
I don't know anyone here, really. Not enough to know their inner
emotions. 


Funny thing is, I was reading some of the archives of past posts, and
I came across a vicious arguement by a guy calling himself IED (always
in the third person for some reason), and |&gt;ave (I think it was).
Anyway, they made this past flame war sound like a friendly chat.

Most of the time, I find that flame wars are 80% misunderstanding.

There it is...
