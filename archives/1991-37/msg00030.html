Auntie Vickie here.

Dear Jonathan, you said:

&gt; Pick an artist, any artist.  Adore them beyond all belief.  Cherish the
&gt; albums that exist. 

But hon, what if the albums are worth cherishing? Is it OK then?

&gt; Find all the rarities.  Buy posters. 

Only from Tom at C-Side.

&gt; Adorn your clothes with pins and badges. 

All mine rusted :-(

&gt; Play your rare b-sides tape at inopportune moments to people who don't
&gt; care 

Nah, I'd never play Kate for anyone who wasn't interested first. Well, I do
play Kate on my radio show, but that's different.

&gt; When the next album comes out, proclaim it sophomoric drivel and moan that
&gt; things aren't the way they were in the old days.

Why, this sounds so familiar. But, I expected you to say "When the next
album comes out, proclaim it the best thing since swiss cheese and moan
about those who can't hear it" :-) Did your system glitch or something?

&gt; Has anyone noticed that the unfocused imagery in Love And Anger reflects
&gt; the pointlessness of that song's lyric?

Why no, I hadn't noticed that at all. The lyrics and the video mean 
something to *me*. You don't like it because it has no meaning to you.
Fair enough.

&gt; Someone has to dare to question, to criticize.

No problems. I've done my share of criticizing. Remember when we joined
together in truly heart-warming unity to decry Kate's butchering of
"Be Kind To My Mistakes" - ah the memories...

Attitude and respect, that's what I was talking about recently. I ruined my
point by being catty and insensitive and disrespectful myself. Maybe next
time I'll have a better attitude about it all and not let my goat get
gotten. 

&gt; You just have to expect that we're going to continue to pick them apart
&gt; and ridicule you for being incapable of critical thought, led around by
&gt; your heart rather than your brain.  If you don't want that happening, 
&gt; don't post. 

I already said I wouldn't, at least, not today. 

&gt; Maybe your skin isn't thick enough

It's true, it isn't. Thank God (whatever you perceive that to be..Cosmic
Muffin or Kate Incarnate :-)

Vickie

ps, how'd you like those Harlequin Romances?
