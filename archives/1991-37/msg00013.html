&gt;Hmm, flow, eh? This is a toughy.
&gt;Well, the songs get progressively harsher (maybe that's
&gt;not the right word. Faster? I think you know what I mean). TMwtCiHE
&gt;is ballad like, WH is medium, JatCG is rockish. They all have a common
&gt;theme of different men. A gentle man, a gothic man, a man with a
&gt;death wish. (see the progression?)

Sure, I see a progression, but not a gentle flow that carries you around.

I guess what it comes down to is that I'm more interested in the way the
music carries through the three songs as opposed to a progression in the
way the lyrics deal with disparate yet vaguely related themes.

&gt;is that they're very different and yet they all blend together perfectly
&gt;well. WH is like a perfect little segue for the other two songs, while
&gt;standing beautifully on its own. It captures the beautiful bitter-sweet
&gt;magic of _Moving_ and SP, in its(they're) fluid melodies.

Hunh?  What do Moving, Strange Phenomena, and Saxophone Song have to do
with the three you were originally describing?

(on a side note, I love the segue from "Moving" into "SS."  For a long
time I had trouble remembering where one song ended and another began.
Very similar to Laurie Anderson's "Let X=X" and "It Tango."  It was ages
before I sat down with the lyrics and figured out when one song became
the next)


&gt;What drug use, prostitution, the occult? Well, I guess the person in
&gt;the "Big Brass Bed" may be a prostitute -- dunno. 

drug use:

a)  "I just took a trip on my love for him"  While one might argue
over whether or not drug use is implied by this line, KaTe's choreography
during the SNL performance leaves no doubt...

b)  alcohol abuse:  "The boys in your gang are knocking whiskey back" and
"It's not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud"

prostitution:

"Remember Genie, from the casino
 She's still a-waiting in her big brass bed"

occult:

The narrator of "Wuthering Heights" is the ghost of Cathy Earnshaw Linton,
come back to haunt Heathcliff; she has come back from the "other side" and
wishes to grab his soul away.  Obviously Satanic.

(go read the book; you won't regret it and it'll just make you love the
song even more...)
