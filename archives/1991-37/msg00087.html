        Ed asked about Kate's "Key lines" quote from the abbey road add.  It's
directly from the book mentioned below, so I've reposted this: 

I found some quotes from the Fanzine For The Love Of Kate #4 about ABBEY ROAD
studios.  If anybody has this book, please transcibe any more quotes from Kate
that might be there or photocopy the pages and I'l do it. 

ABBEY ROAD 
----------
        KATE FIRST VISITED ABBEY ROAD WHEN SHE WAS 15, TO ATTEND A PINK FLOYD
SESSION FOR THEIR WISH YOU WERE HERE ALBUM.  "I was absolutely staggered and I
really thought I would never be able to record in a place like Abbey Road,"
SHE SAID, BUT SHE EVENTUALLY RETURNED IN 1979 FOR THE RECORDING OF NEVER FOR
EVER.  "Being on your own in Studio 2 is a fascinating experience," SHE SAID
IN BRIAN SOUTHALL'S BOOK ABBEY ROAD.  "I felt tremendous vibes in there, both
positive and negative.  You know it's built on key lines (invisible force
fields such as those found at Stonehenge) which means there are very powerful
forces at work.  I even thought of coming in in the evenings just to write but
it would have been an enormously expensive way of writing."
