&gt;&gt;Rifle clicks?  I've learned yet another thing from Love-Hounds.
&gt;
&gt;The discussion of this topic started about two weeks ago and
&gt;originally concerned some people's attempts to explain a trivial
&gt;concept, ie., reproducing any sound on your latest record.

Wrong.  It originally concerned someone wondering what that particular
percussive sound was.

It *is* an interesting part of the arrangement, if not an integral part
of the song, and it makes a lot of sense to have it.

&gt;Why does it seem so strange for KaTe to have taped a bolt
&gt;click, or possibly dragged the Fairlight out for a sample?
&gt;Didja ever hear the Beach Boys song "409" that starts with a
&gt;revving engine?  Brian Wilson simply miked his car engine and
&gt;captured the sound on tape.  And this was in 1963.

Again, I don't remember anything like this being discussed.  There was
some joking about things KaTe might say while *recording* such samples,
if, indeed, she recorded them herself.  However, no one is trying to 
bestow a KaTe Is God award simply because she included this sound in her
song.  

&gt;I'm in an adventurous mood of late, could someone please
&gt;recommend the queinessential (sp?) Cocteau Twins' cd?
&gt;What are they like?  Same for Lush, anyone got some thoughts
&gt;on them?

"quintessential"

The quintessential Cocteau Twins CD depends on who you ask.  I don't remember
ever seeing a whole mass of people agree on a single album.  Having only 
heard 3 or 4 of 'em myself, I'm not qualified to say.  Lush, on the other
hand, has only released one album so far, though they've put out lots of
EPs (in fact, isn't _Gala_ a compilation of 3 EPs?)
