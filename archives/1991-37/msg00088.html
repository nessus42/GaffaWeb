Yo! vickie@chinet.chi.il.us (Vickie Ann Mapes) raps:
&gt;Auntie Vickie here.

I think my poor spinster aunt has been using polyurethane in an unventilated
room again.  How else could you explain...

&gt;Why, this sounds so familiar. But, I expected you to say "When the next
&gt;album comes out, proclaim it the best thing since swiss cheese and moan
&gt;about those who can't hear it" :-) Did your system glitch or something?

Your sarcasm detector is broken, auntie v.  You can borrow mine if you'd
like.

&gt;&gt; Has anyone noticed that the unfocused imagery in Love And Anger reflects
&gt;&gt; the pointlessness of that song's lyric?
&gt;
&gt;Why no, I hadn't noticed that at all. The lyrics and the video mean 
&gt;something to *me*. You don't like it because it has no meaning to you.
&gt;Fair enough.

It doesn't mean anything to anyone with more than five functioning brain
cells.  Even Kate admits she's got no clue what it's about.  I think the
video is the outward projection of that inner confusion.  And it's crap.  I
don't buy the parody angle, not for a second.

&gt;No problems. I've done my share of criticizing. Remember when we joined
&gt;together in truly heart-warming unity to decry Kate's butchering of
&gt;"Be Kind To My Mistakes" - ah the memories...

I'm trying very hard to control myself, but this is pushing me to the
limit.  Let me turn on the sarcasm generator: "ooh, vickie, you are SUCH a
rebel."

&gt;Attitude and respect, that's what I was talking about recently. I ruined my
&gt;point by being catty and insensitive and disrespectful myself. Maybe next
&gt;time I'll have a better attitude about it all and not let my goat get
&gt;gotten. 

I think part of the problem is that it's REALLY fun to bait people with
tendencies to fly off the handle, eg: you.

&gt;ps, how'd you like those Harlequin Romances?

I have absolutely no idea what you are driveling about.  Have you been
inhaling nitrous oxide without mixing in a good percentage of oxygen again?
