KEn Expounds:
&gt;
&gt;     Another fun reading day in the land of love-hounds:
&gt;     First, Boris' comments:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;     You have no right to believe what you believe.
&gt;&gt;I hope this is a joke.
&gt;
&gt;     Actually, it was a point you missed.  I wanted Cynthia to think about
&gt;how she felt after someone told her that.  I felt in my so humble opinion that
&gt;she should at least be aware of what she was, uhm, "dishing" out.  She seems
&gt;to be taking offense to something she insists Jorn should not take offense to.

No one was saying that Jorn sholdn't take offense. But what I think,
and what other's may thing, is that Jorn shouldn't act in that manner.
Criticism(even bad) is expected. Should one never love, since that
puts him/her in a position to get hurt?
&gt;
&gt;     Don't worry.  It's Jorn that would find it personal.  I certainly have no
&gt;evidence to the contrary that would suggest he didn't have that right.

Not anyone I know, is advocating denying rights. (except for hwat I thought
you said above) This whole "I feel that you can't feel that I shouldn't feel
this way is wrong" is snowballing increadibly.
&gt;
&gt;     Who are you taking out to your Junior prom this year?

OOOHhhh. Now didn't you just a few likes up say that one should not
demean another's character?

&gt;Cynthia writes:
&gt;&gt;were totally sincere.  I simply found it to be written in a
&gt;&gt;style that struck me as adolescent and idol-worshipping, as
&gt;&gt;opposed to it being a mature piece.  That you can't accept
&gt;Ken responds:
&gt;     Read what you write once in awhile.  You'll become numb to the sensation.
&gt;

Double OOOhhh.


&gt;     If you're not making a personal attack, what the hell _are_ you saying?
&gt;You seem to be claiming the right to an opinion and denying any personal/
&gt;character references in your intentions, while a knife drips blood in your 
&gt;ther hand.  This isn't grade-school recess, Cynthia.  Tact is a virtue here,
&gt;both for others and for your own good.

Tact, eh? Triple Ooooh.

Are you the leader of the GLC? :)
