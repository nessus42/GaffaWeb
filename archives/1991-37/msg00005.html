&gt;	2.  "James and the Cold Gun" isn't exactly contiguous with
&gt;	"Wuthering Heights".  When the albums were conceived, mastered,
&gt;	and released, the only formats available at the time (CD and Cassette -
&gt;	I don't think there were any 8-track version of _The Kick Inside_)
&gt;	had side breaks.  

Good point...I hadn't even thought of this.  (It just goes to prove that
"my" three songs are a better choice...;-)


&gt;	5.  I thought that she was representing the two facets of her
&gt;	personality in the "Babooshka" video - cold, analytical wife
&gt;	dressed in black, mourning a marriage already over in all but the
&gt;	legal sense and dashing, daring mistress who is erotic, exotic,
&gt;	and exciting.

Yes.  This is how I've always interpreted this video.  But Chris has a point--
she's *scary* when she's wavin' that sword around!  

&gt;	7.  Most likely the rifle bolt was a sample that came with the
&gt;	Fairlight.  

This is interesting.  So many of the Fairlight sounds seem cliche now
(as so many Love-Hounds like to point out) like the orchestra hit.  I
don't think I've heard any other recordings beside _AD_ that have anything
that sounds like that rifle bolt.  Of course, it's certainly possible/easy
to fiddle with the sound, but even so I guess I would have expected to
hear something like that...on the other hand, I'm sure there were lots of
presets or otherwise widely distrubted samples that never got popular.

&gt;	I
&gt;	know for a fact that the original Fairlight included (among other
&gt;	things) digeridu samples, waterfalls, and orchestra hits.  Why
&gt;	not a rifle bolt click?

Well, you must admit that the digeridu sample is hardly surprising, since
the Fairlight was invented in Australia...

It's interesting that you mention the waterfall sample, as I had never
heard that it was one of the Fairlight "samples." (while I'm here, thanks
to Chris for the explanation of how the Fairlight analyzes a sound and
then resynthesizes it).  A year and a half ago, I wrote a paper defending
the use of computers and such as tools within the creative process.  
Grasping for ideas and knowing my professors would be clueless, I wrote
something about interpolating the sound of a waterfall across the range of
a keyboard.  I'd never heard this done, but knew it was possible, and it
fit nicely with what I was writing... ;-)
