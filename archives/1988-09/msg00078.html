&gt; 
&gt; Recently when chatting with a colleague, who considers herself a
&gt; devotee of female musical artists, I expressed my enthusiasm for the
&gt; works of Kate as well as Sinead O'Connor and Shona Laing. She then
&gt; remarked that she recalled seeing Kate perform in a most provacative
&gt; manner on Saturday Night Live sometime during 1978; to wit, she
&gt; remembers Kate striking rather suggestive poses while playing the
&gt; piano. This, of course, did not surprise me considering the visual
&gt; G.
&gt; 
&gt;       [ Kate performed two songs.  She performed "The Man With The
&gt; 	Child In His Eyes", while sitting on a piano played by Paul
&gt; 	Schaeffer.  She did her usual Kate moves.  I wouldn't call
&gt; 	them "suggestive", but they were perhaps sensuous.  She also
&gt; 	performed "Them Heavy People" standing and doing a KT dance.
&gt; 	-- |&gt;oug ]

Sorry to differ, but as I recall the songs were "The Man With The Child
In His Eyes" (performed in trenchcoat and fedora while seated on the 
piano) and "Wuthering Heights".  I distinctly recall Kate's full use of
her vocal range on "Wuthering Heights", and since the vocal style is so
different between WH and THP, I don't think it could have been THP.
Since all of this occured 10 years ago this October, I MAY be mistaken. 
But I don't think so. If anyone out in net-land taped this show 
maybe they can decide this.
