 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: ranjit's 11/27 posting

     _Kate_Bush_:_Live_at_Hammersmith_Odeon_ was available
on both Beta Hi-Fi and VHS Hi-Fi, at least a couple of years
ago when IED last checked. However, the sound on IED's copy of
the Beta Hi-Fi version was hissy and dropouty. Not all were
that bad, however, IED has been told. Whatever the case, the
best solution is to get the laser-disk, which is available
for about $50-60 from Japan only. The latest re-release of
the disk features an absolutely stunning new digital re-mix.
Naturally, the picture is infinitely superior as well. And
all this goes for the _TWS_ laser-disk, too.
     As for the "crummy" quality of some of Kate's videos
(IED assumes you mean the early ones), be charitable: remember
that the first video was made in early 19_78_, which is really
amazingly early for any video at all. Second, all of the first
videos were shot in one day, with scarcely more than one or two
days' preparation. They were all shot on video, and directed
by a very unremarkable talent, Keith "Keef" MacMillan. And they
were all done for peanuts compared to current videos. Finally,
all of Kate's early videos were essentially little more than
video-recordings of dance routines. But those routines are
extremely interesting in themselves, and they add immense and
important insight into the under-meanings of the songs--whether
they're good dancing or not.
