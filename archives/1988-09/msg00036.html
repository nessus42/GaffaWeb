 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: MisK.

 &gt;I'm surprised that IED, in his review of Homeground 32, didn't mention
 &gt;their quashing of the rumours that KBVI will be based on Dr. Who, that
 &gt;it will be called "An Unearthly Child", and that Kate will be appearing
 &gt;in the series (I should hope not, considering the travesty it's become
 &gt;lately).  Now, it's my impression that those rumours were started right
 &gt;here by our very own |&gt;oug in his April Fool posting, so it was a bit mean
 &gt;of them not to credit the source! (loved the idea, by the way - I even
 &gt;believed it until about halfway through the article!).  On Debi Bowes'

     IED _did_ quash that rumour the day it was first posted in L-Hs
(long before the _HG_ mention). He observed that the original, ostensibly
printed in _The_Guardian_, was dated April 1st.

 &gt;As for Debi Bowes's artwork:
 &gt;yes, they are traced from photos, but the centre spread is a very
 &gt;good "collage" of various images around the theme of Lionheart - I liked
 &gt;it a lot.

     IED didn't mean to criticize the mere fact that photographs were
traced to create Ms. Bowes's artwork: when dealing with portraiture,
short of the presence of the live model, photography is obviously the
most effective source for re-creating the likeness of the subject.
     It is more the bland and slick commercialism of Bowes's imagery
that offends IED's eye. He has little criticism to make of her
technique--certainly if her work is to be considered in comparison
with that of most of Kate's "artist" fans. But the higgledy-pigglety
arrangement of public images related to Kate but without any
apparent formal or narrative _inter_-relation, together with the
pretty, facile mode of application and sweetly colour-matched washes,
are not to IED's taste. Naturally, this is only a personal opinion.

 &gt;Finally, I have a few requests:  I keep coming across references to Kate
 &gt;and Terry Gilliam's excellent film "Brazil" - what exactly was Kate's
 &gt;involvement in this?  (I nearly bought the video in an effort to find out,
 &gt;but I managed to resist laying out 15 pounds just to satisfy my
 &gt;curiosity!).  I also keep hearing about the rare and fabulously expensive
 &gt;Canadian interview disc - since this is so difficult to obtain, would it
 &gt;be legal to get a cassette recording of it?  Does anyone here have it
 &gt;anyway?  Lastly, anyone know if it's possible to get a video of the
 &gt;December 1979 BBC TV special "Kate"?

     Kate's contribution to _Brazil_, the film, is non-existant.
She became involved only after the film had been released, when Michael
Kamen, the composer of the score and arranger of the pop standard that
inspired the film's title, invited Kate to contribute her own cover-version
of the song. She did so, but that recording is not heard in the film, and
the soundtrack album for which she originally recorded the song has never
been released.
     You would have to be more specific in describing the nature of the
marbleized vinyl for IED to help you in assessing its value.
     Lastly, very very crude copies, many generations removed from the
original, can sometimes be found through trade with other Kate fans. The
_Kate_ special has never been commercially released on home video in any
country, however.
     Many thanks to Barth for the detailed information about the
contents of _If_You_Could_See_Me_Fly_, which IED had only heard
the vagues description of hitherto.
